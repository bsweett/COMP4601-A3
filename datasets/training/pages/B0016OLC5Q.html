The only thing I knew is that Sean Penn was directing and having been very impressed with his gut-wrenching, if incredibly downbeat, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005BCKG">The Pledge</a> I was pretty much guaranteed to like this film. My guess turned out to be extremely correct.<br /><br />Alexander Supertramp (that's Emile Hirsch as McCandless folks) is a man with no attachments. Having been raised in a loveless household by parents who only wish for him to 'or-din-ary' things he entertains them as far as graduating college but escapes to the country as soon as the diploma is in his hands.<br /><br />His dream is to explore the land with no ID, no money and no chance of being found by those who might want to interfere with his mission of reaching peaceful seclusion in a remote corner of Alaska. Along the way he touches many lives, some brief, some profound and gains experience and character that some might never have even if they lived to a hundred.<br /><br />Sean Penn's photography and affection for nature give this film an overall gorgeous look. It is surely one of the most uniquely composed films of the year. He reminds me a lot of Clint Eastwood as an actor who can also direct fine movies and encourage impressive performances out of his cast. Pretty much everybody here is on top form, even Vince Vaughn manages to shake off the taint of those tawdry 'frat pack' comedies and play a genuine character for once.<br /><br />But Hal Holbrook as old Ron Franz really is a standout. I've never seen a more heartfelt or touching performance in so long. It's a real shame he was conned out of the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. I think it's great that Sean Penn brought Holbrook (now 82) back for such an important and thought-provoking role. If you don't shed a tear for him then you have no soul.<br /><br />Don't con yourself out of a good movie. It may have a limited release but Into the Wild is a film worth taking time out to see. Since I live in the UK, the story of Christopher McCandless (which appears to be some sort of true urban legend in America) is not well known here. I guess that having no expectations of the film made me enjoy it on the right level.</p></br><a href="../users/A331OF34UX4Y1K.html">A331OF34UX4Y1K</a><br/><p>Leaving aside the two following endless controversies: how much the movie was many different or not of the book; and how much what he did was sheer stupidity or sheer idealism, I think what we have ia a very good movie.<br /><br />Well edited, great soundtrack, well acted all the way, incredible photography. As a movie, plain and simple, I think Sean Penn did a great job.</p></br><a href="../users/A387BD735MI50R.html">A387BD735MI50R</a><br/><p>I knew what the general subject of this film was going in. What I hadn't been prepared for was how much of this young man's emotional journey paralleled that of so many people I've known. You'll also likely to be surprised to see your friends, yourself, in this rebellion.<br /><br />Of course, the people you've known probably didn't go quite so fatefully far in distancing themselves from all the cluttering "stuff" of urban society. But surely, we're all acquainted with young people who vanished into their own worlds, at least for a while - leaving their parents to anguish over their whereabouts. And this movie will probably also make a lot of viewers realize how many young people they've known who, like Chris McCandless, silently suffered from, resented, and actually loathed, the essential lack of love between their parents - who rebelled against their parents' fractured, messy marital backgrounds. "Into the Wild" underscores the often-repeated wisdom that the greatest gift parents can give their children - is not things, and in fact not even first-and-foremost a doting love of those children - but an abiding love for each other.<br /><br />Clearly though, McCandless cut family ties without being sufficiently prepared to survive in the wilderness. More than his lack of knowledge about hunting for animals and edible plants, he had an unfortunate lack of knowledge about Thoreau, the spiritual mentor whom he was following into solitude. When I myself was once rhapsodizing about Thoreau's philosophy, a friend of mine deflated my admiration slightly by telling me that Walden was actually just a stone's throw away from Thoreau's family house, and that Thoreau's mother came out to his cabin frequently, with meals and cookies she'd baked for him - and probably also to do his laundry. I wanted to shout at the screen to McCandless to heed this seldom-mentioned aspect of Thoreau's retreat into nature. Thoreau was definitely working with a net.<br /><br />Despite the tragedy though, this movie is truly life-affirming. In contrast with so many movies made now where there is really no one to like - here everyone is a hearteningly decent, likable person. McCandless didn't encounter one sociopathic serial killer on the road - almost unheard of in recent decades. Hal Holbrook does an exceptionally brilliant, touching turn as an older man who briefly serves as a way-station for McCandless. Although Holbrook's role is barely more than a cameo appearance, it's a portrayal that will undoubtedly stick in your memory as one of the most poignant ever captured on film.<br /><br />The whole movie is brilliantly photographed. Director Sean Penn never allowed any artiness to interfer with the sheer natural beauty of McCandless' journey.</p></br><a href="../users/AAU7CAQIN5BAE.html">AAU7CAQIN5BAE</a><br/><p>that aching to see something tangible...that yearning in your belly that somehow ignites with passion, honor, happiness, sadness and all the other emotions one can muster?<br /><br />When the mood is just right and the world beckons you like an incantation, there is some surreal voice that grabs you by the collar one idle Sunday, as you are sitting alone for the first time in some years, eagerly awaiting one of your favorite stories from nearly a decade ago, now on the big screen in front of you, and you have to go to the potty so bad, but you are afraid to move from your seat as you dont want to miss a beat? Some aura prevails in the theatre and you want to just jump up and scream into the air, and cry and laugh and rejoice and make the world a better place, because it is, and it can be and the masterfullness of Penn brings the joy of Chris McCandless' life like I think perhaps few could. I am down with the nay sayers who say the film lacked this or that or whatever word stock and bantering, boring, 'streamlined' prose they want to use. The songs were so perfect for the settings they were in, and Vedder's voice added to the overall impact of the outcome of the film, just littered with emotions, and the sweeping lucid cinematography that we were welcomed to ignited the viewer to want to walkabout almost immediately. The songs were searing! The very close and introspective views of nature, instead from long angled shots were truly well done. Also the physical change in Hirsh was brilliant, especially at the end there when he took his shirt off in one of the scenes and to see the transformation from him a bit o' baby fat throughout, then eating organic and of course his eventually demise where he ate the wrong plant, was very well done, and I was having flashbacks to Bale in 'The Machinist' for a bit, albeit not as grotesque.<br /><br />Bill Hurt is always brilliant. I love his voice, his presence, there is just something about him ya know, something intrinsic that he just has a way with the ensemble he works with. To not say that Chris also had some mental instability, arguably would be doing the film an injustice, and I think Penn really brought that out in some scenes where Hirsh's mind was just littered with ideas, idealisms, and a million thoughts screaming out in the dark. Through all Chris's pure love of the wild, he must in turn have been screaming inside.<br /><br />In a time where films seem to lack anymore creativity in a tangible sense, 'Into the Wild' comes from nowhere and lands a punch on our hearts, and for me at least, it is surely needed in a time when we all seem to be searching for something more. In saying that I am reminded by a few lines I remembered from my youth, and I apologize for any inaccuracies as its from memory: "Nature gives you the impressions as if there were nothing else contradictory in the world; and yet, when you return back to the dwelling place of man, be it lofty or low, wide or narrow, there is ever somewhat to contend with, to battle with, to smooth and put to rights" [Goethe]<br /><br />And in that we find Chris McCandless. A shining star in an often weary world.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>Based on a true story. After graduating from Emory University, top student and athlete Christopher McCandless abandoned his possessions, gave his entire $24,000 savings account to charity and hitchhiked to Alaska to live in the wilderness. Along the way, Christopher encounters a series of characters who shape his life. This movie is  beautiful, deep, true, adventurous, sad, occasionally funny, real, at times very touching. Chris McCandless lived a whole, remarkable, life.

First of all, cast off all of the things you don't need, then work along here and there, pick up what you need to survive in the wild, and then go there...and live.<br /><br />This isn't a "My Side of the Mountain" type of sanitized storyline. It's about an inexperienced young man that knows how to work and knows how to learn, going into the wild alone, finding food, and surviving (or not- you have to see the movie to find out).<br /><br />This is not a show for the younger crowd.

Based on Jon Krakauer's reconstruction of McCandless' journey from his diary, from letters, and from notes found after his death at age 23, IN THE WILD has been transformed into a Waldenesque film by Sean Penn who provided both the screenplay and the direction.  While some may argue the very loose technique of relating this story, few will come away form this film untouched by the sheer dreamy valor of a youth determined to find his own connection to the meaning of existence.<br /><br />The bright McCandless (Emile Hirsch) graduates from Emory University and faces a celebratory dinner with his wealthy but dysfunctional parents (William Hurt and Marcia Gay Harden) and his adoring younger sister Carine (Jena Malone).  During the stilted and revealing dinner Christopher declines his parents' gift of a new car and instructions on how to proceed with his life of success, instead electing to leave it all behind and secretly set off on a personal journey to live in the wild. Stripping himself of worldly possessions he begins his road trip with the ultimate destination being Alaska. Along the way he encounters various people: Wayne Westerberg (Vince Vaughan) who offers him work harvesting grain and camaraderie; Jan and Rainey (Catherine Keener and Brian Dierker), two middle-aged hippies who offer him a sense of family; Tracy (Kristen Stewart), a 16-year old who offers him physical love Christopher cannot condone; a Danish couple he encounters while rafting; and the elderly Frank (Hal Holbrook) who has no family and lives alone making leather trinkets, eager to 'belong' to the young man whom he sees as needy yet courageous.<br /><br />Christopher's journey pretty much covers America and Mexico, from the plains and farms to the homeless streets of Los Angeles to the splendors and natural cruelties of nature in Alaska.  His struggles survive are balanced by his inebriation with the wonders of the natural world untouched by society. Yet in the end he faces his own dissolution into the dust of nature alone.<br /><br />Hirsch immerses himself in this physically demanding role and manages to hold onto our hearts all through his journey.  The flow of the story is at times discordant with the over voice narration by Jena Malone and the insertion of bits and pieces of quotations that aren't pieced tightly together enough to avoid sounding superficial.  Yet the supporting cast is very strong, including a brilliant little cameo by Cheryl Francis Harrington as a social worker with heart.  The photography (Eric Gautier) is stunning and the musical score, courtesy of Michael Brook, Kaki King, and Eddie Vedder, fits the mood through the film. And throughout the film Sean Penn has the restraint and taste to keep the story vital without ever making it maudlin.  A very fine film. Grady Harp, March 08</p></br><a href="../users/A27H9DOUGY9FOS.html">A27H9DOUGY9FOS</a><br/><p>When I read Jon Krakauer's "Into the Wild" approximately ten years ago, I was mesmerized by the tragic real-life tale of Christopher McCandless. But as much as I loved the book, I never even thought about a film adaptation. Maybe that was shortsighted of me. Recounting McCandless's life and reconstructing it with minimal data and much introspection, "Into the Wild" succeeded as a cautionary adventure of idealism gone awry. Much of McCandless's life was lived alone and much of his story was pieced together though brief encounters or recovered writings. So what was a thoughtful portrait on the page never really seemed like it would translate to the screen--certainly not with the same impact. Luckily, though, Sean Penn thought otherwise. Adapting and directing Krakauer's fine book, Penn has fashioned a sad, funny and exciting film with tremendous emotional resonance.<br /><br />An affluent and likable young man, McCandless graduated with honors from Emory University and then set a course to redefine his life. Abandoning his family, friends, and material possessions--McCandless assumed the pseudonym of Alexander Supertramp and set off to explore the world in its most innocent form. Living off the land and experiencing nature, fellow travelers, and much adventure--McCandless was looking for a modern day utopia and sought to discover his real self as he cast away the corruptions of modern life. Touring the country for two years, McCandless's exploration was to culminate in an Alaskan sojourn--where he would commune with "the wild." His aspirations can be viewed as both admirable and delusional--but that is part of the complexity of McCandless's life. As much as you want him to succeed, you realize there can be no happy ending with the expectations he has in place.<br /><br />Penn's "Into the Wild," thus, depends on evoking a McCandless that you will care about--either because you commend his pursuit or because you want him to come to his senses. And it really works in combination. In a dynamic performance, Emile Hirsch transcends his previous work and becomes a full-fledged leading man. Hitting all the right notes, Hirsch creates a character who evokes our sympathy, our frustration, and even our laughter. McCandless meets a lot of companions on the road, and Hirsch makes it easy to see why he was so accepted. A great role--Hirsch meets all the emotional challenges and also makes a physical transformation that is a both startling and powerful. His great work is matched by a roster of big names including Vince Vaughn, William Hurt, Jena Malone, and Marcia Gay Hardin (among many others). But Catherine Keener and Hal Holbrook are real stand-outs--their adoptive relationships with Hirsch both challenge him and make him understand (eventually) that life is not meant to be lived alone.<br /><br />If there is any flaw in the film, it exists in the book as well. We can only know so much about McCandless from the resources available. He had a heightened sense of injustice particularly when it came to the "untruths" or perceived wrongs perpetuated by his family. Nothing presented, however, can explain how his relatively normal dysfunction blossomed into such an extreme world view. This secret is in McCandless's mind alone.<br /><br />"Into the Wild" works as a character study and a gritty drama, but also as an adventure. The scenery and photography are breathtaking and the action sequences are well executed. There is much genuine warmth and humor in the film as well. It was a fully satisfying film experience, to me, and has many quiet moments that have stayed with me. Highly recommended for serious adult audiences.

(who,who? who, who?)<br />It seems the hero of this beautiful and sad film did not get the chance to find out, nature killed him before he made it.<br />Don't blame nature alone, the man clearly had a death wish and provoked the danger that beat him in the end.<br />A young man from a well to do but not entirely harmonious family decides to drop out and become a hippy, a tramp, a hobo, a hermit. He hates society but finds friends wherever he goes. Well, apart from Alaska. He hates the concept of 'people', but people seem to love him and hate to lose him. In other words, he is one heck of a selfish monster, this nice guy.<br />He calls himself Alexander Supertramp and even makes a half-hearted and obviously brainless effort at getting new ID papers with that name. Purpose is to make himself unfindable to his folks. He ends up as an Alaskan hermit in an abandoned old bus wreck.<br />His mind is formed by Thoreau, Jack London, Tolstoy. The time is early 90s. I have not read the book, which was a 'non-fiction bestseller', so I would not know if the movie could have been better. As it is, I liked it a lot.</p></br><a href="../users/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ.html">A12X2J7AVZ04IQ</a><br/><p>Even at 2? hours, this film commands attention, thanks largely to the care and vision of director/screenwriter Sean Penn. Despite his checkered past in Hollywood (bad-boy image, married to Madonna, etc.), I've been a fan since his directorial debut, "The Indian Runner", introducing the world to Viggo Mortenson. Smart move; great film. There is little I can say that hasn't been said. The episodic nature of the narrative is a good thing; Mr. McCandless certainly found the adventure he was seeking, and his reflections and flashbacks fill in most of the holes. It's brilliantly acted, and the top-notch cast, most relegated to short screen time, fulfill the requirements. Most impressive of all is the focused, centered and determined performance of Emile Hirsch. There's not a glitch in the committment of his character. His resemblance to Leo di Caprio is profound. Certainly, everyone thinks, at one time, to get away from it all. Mr. McCandless certainly had that idea, and ran with it. Unfortunately, it wasn't well imagined for him,  and his dream was not fruitful.Some might think that re-imagining yourself would be productive, but there are too many factors involved that must be considered: love, memories, friends, accountability; it's presented well, and non-judgmental. A true adventure; alas, no heroes.</p></br><a href="../users/AJRFZ0VZ0LD26.html">AJRFZ0VZ0LD26</a><br/><p>Every human being has been thru a rebellion phase in our lives.  We rebel against our parents, teachers, social norms.  We challenge the authority of any kind with idealism, or simply spite.  Some people in doing so, dye their hair, pierce their tongue, visit ashrams in India, or simply put prolonged time in serving PeaceCorps or other humanitarian organizations.  Young Christopher McCandless, main protagonist of this film and Krakauer's best selling novel relinquishes his earthly possessions, gives away his money, abandones his identity and sets of for a two year track across country.  He survives by tending to odd jobs and living in the wilderness until his fateful decision to head to Alaska.  He meets some amazing people along the way, but rejects them all.  What struck me about the young man is that he adopts the same emotional shallowness that he has tried to escape from his own parents.  In his embrace of nature and wilderness, he ends up finding his final shelter in a deserted bus that ultimatey becomes his grave.  One cannot but notice that young Christopher McCandless at his very end, becomes what he has tried altogether to escape. Wheather or not we have money and comfortable lives, without human tenderness, love and emotional connections, we are simply empty shells.  We all have to find our way to define happiness but in the process we are responsible in not hurting people who deeply care about us simply we are in pursuit of our own longings.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>For a little while, I've always thought of the idea of going out into the world and experiencing all that there is to experience before tons of mortgage payments, careers and fears of being laid off and whatnot would overwhelm. It's not so much wanting to be "free" and live life without barriers but rather to get out there and see as much as you can before you settle into a life like everyone else has. The film, based on the book of the same name, tells the story of one who wanted to be free and not dragged down by materialism and unnecessary things without realizing the most important things at the same time.<br /><br />The film tells the story of Christopher McCandless, a smart man recently graduated from university where he longs for a life that's more basic and natural than new cars and careers. After donating all of his rather extensive savings and burning the rest, abandoning his car and changing his name to "Alexander Supertramp", he goes on a 2 year journey that takes him all over America before he makes for his goal of Alaska where he spends his days in an abandoned bus and where his body was later found.<br /><br />One thing that always bugs me about these "biopics" is that the film casts the subject in such a positive light that anything negative gets dismissed or at least excused because of their "genius and influence". While I can relate to the idea of just wanting to live and not be saddled by getting a job so I can move out so I can get to university and work 20 years for a job I don't love, his reasonings and viewpoints are a little bit naive even. In one scene after being told to get a career, he says no because it's a "20th century invention" which to me sounds more like rebellion against The Man rather than something he felt his soul/spirit needed. So it's more a story you can appreciate and maybe even get inspired by but it's not let's say Gandhi in its power.<br /><br />The film though is quite gorgeous in how it was shot and a lot of its cinematography is quite picturesque and helps sell the idea of just being out there on your own. The music, supplied by Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder, is also a notable mention and it wasn't as intrusive or wrong as I thought it was going to be. Another praise I got to give is to Sean Penn who, to be honest, I never liked as an actor, preferring loudness and overexaggerated movements to help sell his character. But as a director here, he's more restrained and even has a good sense of pacing which for some reason is a big problem with some directors lately.<br /><br />Like Zodiac and the Diving Bell and the Butterfly, Into the Wild was criminally overlooked by the Academy and proves not all the best films get to be the top 5 nominated. I wouldn't say this film was or is anywhere near my favorite film of last year, but I sure enjoyed it a lot.</p></br><a href="../users/A39IBJB2PBVC7I.html">A39IBJB2PBVC7I</a><br/><p>Into The Wild, Sean Penn's adaptation of the Christopher McCandless story; runs 140 minutes but feels more like 200.  Indeed, when the giant grizzly shows up at his bus I was praying it would put him, and us, out of our collective misery.  (Note to Hollywood, basing a movie on an interesting true story does not automatically guarantee an interesting movie.)<br /><br />What the film does do convincingly is reaffirm the idea that - despite considerable acting skill - Sean Penn remains a very simple-minded man drawn to naive, two-dimensional explanations for multi-faceted, complex questions.  What McCandless did is remarkable, what's remarkable about this movie is that it fails to provide any insight at all into why he did it.<br /><br />To risk life and limb, to renounce the advantages of bourgeois society, to abandon family, to live a life so solitary monks would think it odd - demands intense motivation.  We are offered the obligatory bait of Thoreau, but Christopher isn't running into the embrace of nature, he is fleeing the company of men.  We're thrown a scrap or two about contempt for the hypocrisy of society and worship of all that is material.  But Chris is only too willing to ride rails, hitch in cars of all types, and nestle into a hunter's cabin (bus) that has been well outfitted.  We understand most vividly what he actually is as he negotiates the soft underbelly of L.A. at night - he's a bum.<br /><br />Unfortunately for the story, Emile Hirsch is affable and charming - which helps perpetuate the myth that Chris is some well-intentioned social misfit having a bit of soul-searching adventure.  For this story to make any sense at all, that can't be true.  If the story had had human interaction, we might have gotten to know him.  (As Sean Penn's incredibly heavy hand points out at the end of this film, the happiness Chris seeks can only be found in sharing with others.)  But even on those rare occasions when we have the illusion of contact, (Holbrook, Vaughn, Keener), Chris is an emotional succubus, unwilling to share anything truer about himself than the word, "Alaska."<br /><br />Although we never see them, three forces drive Chris.  The first is an intense anger, even hatred, lurking beneath that boyish smile - hatred for his parents, his father in particular, and ultimately, self-loathing.  (How else can we explain his willingness to let them agonize about his fate?  He wants to hurt them.)  Next is a staggering narcissism - his self-seeking is done in a void, as if all other people are merely extras in his movie.  Last is an addictive attraction to self-destruction, his self-destruction is an orgasmic narcotic, and it is also an act of revenge.  Hirsch and Penn are equally to blame for this failure.<br /><br />What's best about the movie - the Alaskan scenery and other jewels of cinematography - is also what's worst, it's a lovely distraction.  The quest that Chris allegedly embarked upon does not lead into wild nature, but into the wild heart.  Make it out of there alive, and you've got a real movie.</p></br><a href="../users/ATXL536YX71TR.html">ATXL536YX71TR</a><br/><p>The true story of Christopher McCandless, a young man who leaves a hefty scholarship to Emory U.in 1992 puts a new face on the old saying,"Go West,young man,go West!"<br /> Sean Penn has taken Jon Krakauer's book and boiled it down to one theme: the finding of self-knowledge through forsaking all.Not since St.Francis of Assisi left all his wealth and familial bonds to serve Christ in  BROTHER SUN,SISTER MOON has come a film where one man leaves all,not to follow Christ in this case, but to undertake his own "spiritual journey" as he experiences life with nature and people on his way to Alaska.<br />Emile Hirsch is so perfect in this role,that his charm and innocence are refreshing.Hirsch IS McCandless or "Alexander Supertramp" as he knights himself.The film is told from several perspectives:McCandless',his sister's (Jena Malone) and his parents (an amazing Marcia Gay Harden and stoic ol'William Hurt).Everyone is affected by Chris' decision.Penn shows us from what Chris is running from and to where he is running which will eventually lead to his death.Between those polar opposites,is a heartfelt tale of a man in love with the universe.That's not a spoiler.It was a well known newspaper fact when this story broke.Still we will root all the way as Chris tries to survive over 100 days in wilderness alone.He will lose, but we will win from an example well set by a young idealist who "grabbed all the gusto" and "went out in a blaze of glory!"<br />The film clocks in in over two-and-a-half hours,so hunker down for an interesting journey INTO THE WILD.<br />Also starring Catherine Keener,Vince Vaughn (a surprising excellent performance) and Hal Holbrook as an old "leather tramp" named Ron.It is Holbrook's role, though, that is the real pro-acting of this film.It's a small role, but the noms will come.</p></br><a href="../users/A24KZBAAUTC83R.html">A24KZBAAUTC83R</a><br/><p>If anyone would dare give this heartwarming, heartrending, beautifully shot movie a bad review - they have no heart.<br /><br />Sean Penn's Into The Wild is a tour-de-force in showcasing a real-life young man's desire to lose himself into the wilds of Alaska. Although he comes from a wealthy family, and is college educated, young McCandless finds a soul-searing pull that no one understands - but himself.<br /><br />An unwavering desire to leave civilization behind, due in part to his families morbid background while growing up, but with a strong bond of love from his sister, young McCandless still feels the need to find his destiny in the Alaskan wilderness.<br /><br />Beautifully shot in fantastic locations, Sean Penn also captures much more of the human heart in this strong, although somewhat tragic tale of the human spirit. I felt the highs and lows of this young man's journeys, from finding people to help heal, to finding first love in the strangest of places, this movie will take viewers on a journey of one young man's self-discovery, filling the vacuums of different people's hearts, and in various beautiful ways, that anyone with half a heart can't help but feel.<br /><br />Sean Penn truly captured on film the raw emotions that lie within us all. The beauty, and the beast that lies just under the surface, but which few of us truly understand, nor usually act upon.<br /><br />Into the Wild is a masterpiece in so many ways: from its acting to its cinematography, it is a true portrait of a young man's life that few people can truly call upon themselves to actually do that they most desire to dream about - leave the thin veneer of civilization behind and lose themselves into the beautiful but deadly landscapes of the wild.<br /><br />This remarkable film deserves every penny and accolade it got. Actually, it deserved much, much more. A film like this is rarely made, actually able to capture the raw essence of numerous people's lives of all its wide varieties.<br /><br />If the ending of this film doesn't draw strong emotion in you, full of its tragic but beautiful way, then you truly do not know what it means to be human.<br /><br />After seeing this film, Sean Penn has proven to me he is as good - if not better - than such huge directors such as Spielberg and the like.<br /><br />A must see for people who really should honor this fantastic young man's life.</p></br><a href="../users/A39IY0JU5JI69G.html">A39IY0JU5JI69G</a><br/><p>I didn't know anything about the film when I got it...other than it was directed by Sean Penn.  So I watched it with a completely open mind.  I didn't even know that it was based on a true event, until the final closing credits.<br /><br />I was quickly drawn into the story.  Emile Hirsch is a very attractive, sympathetic actor and I was rooting for the hero early on.  His encounters with folks he met along the road underlined my liking for him.<br />He was kind to everyone, gave the old guy in the phone booth a quarter, refused to take easy advantage of the cute teenage girl, and read all the right books.  His adventures before Alaska make up the best part of the film, in my opinion and I understand that these were based on letters from folks who had actually met McCandless.  Apparently he was a charismatic guy who made a big impression on people.<br /><br />Once he gets to the wilderness and walks in, I had the feeling this wasn't going to end all that well for him.  But I hung in there, cheering him on, even as he kept taking in his belt.  Surely, such a sunny personality as his would find a way to triumph over adversity, one would think..<br /><br />So, when the end came...not a pretty ending, nothing heroic, I was left feeling strangely empty.  Not sad, no tears, just...nothing.  The fake "spiritual" scene of the guy looking up at the light in the sky didn't do it for me....I found that sort of a cheap trick on the part of the film maker.<br /><br />Reading the number of critical reviews here helped me realize why I was so strangely unaffected by what should have been an extremely moving film.  I am a multi-Kleenex movie watcher but I couldn't muster one tear for this guy.  I didn't really see him as inconsiderate and lacking in love, as a number of reviewers here did.  I really understood (I thought) how his background would drive him to such desperation.  It just seemed so pointless in the end.  Did anyone learn anything?  Well, maybe, as he wrote, between the lines in one of his books, that "happiness must be shared"...maybe that was it.  Too bad the lesson came too late.  Maybe, as the voice over of his sister claimed, that his absence had a positive effect on his warring, materialistic parents.<br /><br />The cast is very good, especially Katherine Keener and Hal Holbrook.  But I don't think Hirsch was the right actor for the role.  McCandless must have had a strong self-destructive nature and this doesn't come across at all in his character or performance.  Sean Penn, had he been younger, would have been great at showing both the darkness that must have been there and the charm that people spoke of.  Hirsch just looks like a really sweet kid who might live next door and whom you'd want to hire to mow your lawn.<br /><br />Mostly I think that the blame for the misfire of the film lies with Penn as the writer and director.  He may have attempted to portray McCandless in a neutral way but McCandless comes across as everyone's hero...the good looking, really kind, likable kid who is trying to live a pure moral existence.  It's sort of dangerous and even irresponsible, I think, to give his view of McCandless.  If Penn had aimed at a more accurate documentary style portrayal, we would have seen the character's fatal flaws earlier one.  If Penn had wanted to give us pure fiction, then a more satisfying dramatic ending would have been in order.  If the boy's death really did humanize his parents, maybe showing that would have given us some sense of resolution.  As another reviewer wrote, the way the kid dwindled away, even the bear didn't bother with him.  That's really sad, given all of the passion with which he embarked on his pilgrimage.  Reminds me of the line from  T.S. Eliot poem  about the world ending not with a bang, but with a whimper.  I would have wanted more for the real Chris McCandless.</p></br><a href="../users/A36QYTMMJ0O2IZ.html">A36QYTMMJ0O2IZ</a><br/><p>This may be one of the best films that I have seen in the last few years, and Sean Penn may well have directed his masterpiece in this incredibly moving and powerful true story of a young man who seeks him Self in an epic journey.<br /><br />Chris McCandless is a young man who has just graduated from college.  He has nearly $25,000 in savings.  His family is hoping he will use it toward a Harvard education.  Instead, he does the unthinkable: he gives all but a few hundred to charity, sets off on a trek around the country and eventually burns the last bit of money that he has left.  Crazy?  Perhaps...to us, anyway.<br /><br />"Life begins OUTSIDE of your comfort zone" --Conversations With God. This quote applies to Chris because he's chosen not play life "safe." He wants to live, and to engage in new experiences often means taking risks. From the start of his journey, Chris does this nearly every day.<br /><br />The journey of Chris "Alexander Supertramp" McCandless is one of the most powerful journeys of man: it is the journey of letting go.  He decides to return to a state of simplicity by removing virtually all of his worldly possessions and attachments, except for the basic necessities.  He does not wish to be bogged down by conformity and the hypocrisy of human relationships any longer, and so he leaves his family and everything he knows behind.<br /><br />The irony of letting go is that it is tantamount with healing and with Self discovery.  Chris meets a number of people throughout his journey.  They all seem to be touched by this simple and yet wise young man who brings with him a powerful, healing energy whether those he interacts with are aware of it or not.<br /><br />Perhaps the most touching meeting of all, is the last one shown with Ron Franz (Hal Holbrook in an especially sweet performance) as an old man living in the Anza-Borrego desert of Southern California.  Chris challenges Ron to not give up on life and new experiences just because he's old, and to not give in to the illusion that human relationships are the principle form of happiness.  We see the sparkle of realization in Ron's eyes as the truth sinks in.  Ron is so taken with Chris that he wants to adopt him.  Chris simply tells him that they can talk about it when he returns from Alaska.  It's at this point that Ron realizes that Chris belongs to no one except himself even though he knows that Chris, indeed, loves him.  Chris knows that a truly loving relationship is about letting go, not holding on, and it's evident that this is the only type of relationship that he has with each and every person he meets and comes across.<br /><br />Chris is like a modern day Thoreau (which ironically he read a lot of including Tolstoy, London, and other writers).  He goes into the wilds of Alaska to live deliberately and simply in order to gain further insight and wisdom as to who he is and what life is really all about.  It is no surprise that when he finally passes away, it is with a smile on his face because he knows that he has truly lived.<br /><br />The performance of Emile Hirsch is a fantastic one.  He plays the role simply, much like how the real Chris McCandless must have been.  It's as if he understands what it must have been like to know Chris and he incorporates that knowledge into the role.<br /><br />Jena Malone (as Chris's sister) is equally important as she narrates and chronicles the life of her brother.  She seems to be the only one who truly understood him and why he did what he did, regardless of the fact that she had to heal herself from the loss of her brother.<br /><br />Chris died at the age of 23, and yet I would submit that most people have not lived the happy life that he lived at twice his age.  He truly lived the life he wanted to have.<br /><br />One thing that I found most profound was even though he was helping many people whom he came across on his journey, Chris was always provided for whether it be a pair of boots, a beat up cowboy hat, or some old fishing gear and machete.  Is this not what all of the sacred writings talk about?<br /><br />This is an experience to be treasured, and this film should be required viewing for nearly everyone.  Because through Chris's journey, we might stop and reflect on our own journeys.  Are we living our lives to the fullest?  Are we happening to life or is life happening to us?  Are we happy?  Chris found his answers, and hopefully, we will all find ours since we are all on our own spiritual journey.</p></br><a href="../users/AE9GUE3HHOX3U.html">AE9GUE3HHOX3U</a><br/><p>I rented this on a whim, I didn't even know there was a book first, so I watched it without prejudice.  I ended up loving it.  Emile Hirsch did a fantastic job as the real life character, "Alexander Supertramp". He embodied the character and carried the movie.  I think he reason why I loved the movie so much is because I identify with Alexander Supertramp's belief system, except not to the extreme. I go through stages of wanting to give up on people and "soceity", but I'm not willing to isolate and rebel against something that is stronger than the powers that be.  Point in case, he died for his beiefs and it seemed he regreted some of the core of what he was trying to prove to himself with the scribble of a quote he enscribed in one of his novels "happiness only real when shared".  I think he realized when he was near death that isolation is not the answer.  But his journey was a self chosen path that I'm sure was his destiny, and in fact inspired many people he came in contact with.  In hindsight, I believe that in his mind and soul, his beilief was worth dying for.  It's rare to find that quality in human beings, so I commend him for that, but I disagree with some of his bizarre actions that led to his death.  There were also some contridictions to his core belief system in regards to "money".  The practical side of me asked questions like "if you are so against the money system, why did you rely on other people's money that you came into contact with, which is borderline "using people" in my mind.  You can't escape the fact we all need money to survive in the end.  Aside from all the philosophical aspects of the film, I thought Sean Penn did a fantastic job directing. I also loved the music by Eddie Veder. On the weird front, there were some bizarre moments like the "apple scene" and the danish couple encounter and the MC Hammer song?  I was like "whoa, ok....".  Overall I felt like I was on the journey with him, it was an incredible but tedious ride.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>*SPOILERS*<br /><br />Who among us hasn't, at one time or another, dreamed of one day chucking the whole "corporate rat race/adult responsibility" thing and moving to an isolated cabin in the woods where we would be free to get in touch with our inner selves and become one with nature?  Yet, even though many of us have fantasized about doing such a thing, few of us have had the intestinal fortitude or psychological wherewithal to actually go out and do it.  Well, Christopher McCandless actually DID go out and do it - though with sadly tragic results for both the young man and those dearest to him.<br /><br />At the age of 22, McCandless could have had the life of privilege, comfort and financial success natural to someone who had just graduated with honors from a prestigious institution like Emory University (especially one with wealthy parents).  Instead, he chose a different path for himself, one that would reject the materialistic values of the world around him and send him on a journey of self-discovery which, despite the best of intentions, would prove fatal to him in the long run.  Over a two-year period, from 1990 to 1992, Chris traveled all across North America - on foot, by kayak, by bumming rides off strangers - finally ending up in the wilderness of Alaska where he was to meet his tragic fate.  Along the way, he encountered numerous colorful characters who made a mark on his heart.  This adventure was popularized in the best-selling book "Into the Wild" by Jon Krakauer, who reconstructed McCandless' experiences largely from notes and journal entries left behind by the young man and through interviews with certain key players in the drama.<br /><br />For the movie version, writer/director Sean Penn has made Chris' devoted sister, Carine, the narrator and chief commentator on the action.  It is through her reflections that we come to understand some of the reasoning behind Chris' remarkable willingness to forego all the creature comforts of the modern world that the rest of us seem to cling to so tenaciously.  As with any tale of a picaresque nature, "Into the Wild" is more a series of vignettes than a fully fleshed-out drama, and, thus, it has an occasional tendency to ramble and wander aimlessly.  Yet, its narrative looseness is clearly a large part of the story's charm.  Moreover, Penn keeps it tightly knit together through the narration, the use of flashbacks, the scenes involving Chris' parents, and the mesmerizing fluidity of the camerawork.  And, naturally, the evocative, richly variegated landscapes against which the story unfolds play a crucial role in the overall richness of the film.<br /><br />Some have charged the movie with romanticizing and glorifying an individual who was arguably sociopathic and whose actions and decisions ultimately led to his own death.  Yet, while Penn clearly wants us to identify with Chris' sense of idealism and carpe diem spirit, the filmmaker also acknowledges that there are some serious psychological issues at play here, mostly brought on by the young man's being raised by two obviously dysfunctional parents.  Yet, the movie is also about how important it is for us to forgive those who have wronged us and to not allow bitterness to determine the course of our lives.<br /><br />With his boyish looks and unprepossessing manner, Emile Hirsch embodies the devil-may-care spirit of what is, essentially, a 20th Century version of Henry David Thoreau.  In relatively small but crucial roles, William Hurt and Marcia Gay Harden leave an indelible mark as Chris's parents.  The many individuals he meets along the way are embodied by Brian H. Dierker, Catherine Keener, Vince Vaughn, and, most memorably, Hal Holbrook, heartbreaking in his Oscar-nominated performance as an old desert-dweller who offers to adopt Chris as his son.<br /><br />In the end, "Into the Wild" can be read as much as a cautionary tale as one championing the cause of unbridled individuality.  Like "Grizzly Man," it shows how an obsession with nature and an unrealistic disdain for civilization can lead to disastrous consequences for individuals unequipped to deal with the harsh realities of the natural world.  If anything, both films serve as a call for reasonableness and balance in determining mankind's proper place in the overall scheme of things.</p></br><a href="../users/A38I00SO3D9ZSM.html">A38I00SO3D9ZSM</a><br/><p>Life-affirming<br />Thought-provoking<br />Sad<br />Frustrating<br />Disturbing<br />Funny<br />Adventurous<br />Intelligent<br /><br />I don't know how to feel about the film.  That is, I don't have a single feeling about it but many.  Taking everything into account (acting, dialogue, cinematography), it's quite good as a film.  The story left me dismayed and disturbed.  The man behind the story, Chris McCandless, in my view, was more flawed than hero.  Some may see his adventures and his views on life as romantic or noble.  I found him to be naive, selfish, immature and ignorant of the power of nature.  The things he saw, though, must have been incredible.  In the two years in which all the action takes place, "Alexander Supertramp" lived two or three lifetimes, putting into action the old rock n' roll cliche, "It's better to burn out than to fade away."</p></br><a href="../users/AQ990HW13DP08.html">AQ990HW13DP08</a><br/><p>Writer and director Sean Penn recreates the story of Chris McCandless, a disaffected young man whose story was made famous in Jon Krakauer's book of the same title. After graduating from Emory University in Atlanta, McCandless gave away his savings of $24,000 to OXFAM, burned the last few bills in his wallet, left his wealthy family without a word, and then found his way to the Alaskan wilderness after bumming his way across the country and giving himself a new name, "Alexander Supertramp." His body was eventually found by some moose hunters in an abandoned bus in remote Alaska, along with some books and notes, where he either starved to death or poisoned himself by accidentally eating toxic plants. This film is long at 145 minutes, and at times Penn romanticizes McCandless as the hero who rejects the evils of society. He was also a confused young man acting out his anger against his dysfunctional parents. This is a good film about a fascinating story that has continued to garner controversy and attention since Krakauer made it famous. A single note that was found with McCandless's body provides a very fitting moral to his tragic end.</p></br><a href="../users/A1HG2DOSBZEX4I.html">A1HG2DOSBZEX4I</a><br/><p>In Sean Penn's magnificently acted film Into the Wild we get the story of Christopher McCandless (Emile Hirsch) who abandons his upper middle class existence to go an adventure first to the American West and then into the deep wilds of Alaska. Based on the book by Jon Krakauer, Penn does an admirable job telling the story of a youthful nomad in the early 1990's.<br /><br />The cast features great performances by nearly all players. From the bewildered parents (William Hurt and Marcia Gay Harden), to the sister who deeply loves her brother and is troubled by his actions (Jena Malone) to the friends he meets along the way: aging hippie couple Jan and Rainey (Catherine Keener and Brian Dierker), midwestern farmer (Vince Vaughn) to kindly old man who wants to adopt him (Hal Holbrook) all play a part in showing Christopher the meaning of happiness. There can only be true happiness when it is shared with others.<br /><br />The film apart from the acting looks remarkable. Cinematographer Eric Gautier does Oscar worthy work here and his work on locatio in Alaska is breathtaking. Also worthy of mention is the music. The score by Michael Brook and Kaki King with songs by Eddie Vedder add considerably to the overall viewing experience.<br /><br />I viewed the HD disc by Paramount and was quite pleased with the presentation. The one minus is that there are not the wealth of special features found on the two disc standard definition set. The bonus features consist of roughly 37 minutes of features on the casting and making of the film.<br /><br />While not the happiest film of the year it is well worth checking out and is quite an achievement for Sean Penn.<br /><br />Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A2582KMXLK2P06.html">A2582KMXLK2P06</a><br/><p>Into the Wild is NOT your typical "guy is lost in the middle of nowhere and can't find his way home" type adventure movies.  This one is a little bit different from that.<br /><br />This movie is more about a loner guy who leaves his mom, dad, and sister and goes through life trying to survive without them as soon as college is over.  He travels all across America, meeting different people and going through new experiences each time.  Throughout the movie you can't wait to find out where he ends up next.<br /><br />This is one really good movie.  I didn't expect the storyline to grab me as much as it did.  The ending was incredibly sad, and was somewhat of a twist if you ask me because I did NOT see it coming.  I thought the story was going one way, and it went completely the other way.  In fact, there were a couple different things at the end that were sad to me.<br /><br />But sadness aside, the first two hours of the movie were pure excitement.  The acting was incredible from all the characters, and I think everyone can find something to like about the storytelling because it comes across in such an easy to understand, logical, and likeable way.  You just keep pulling for the main character and all the objects that get in his way to find out how he handles them.<br /><br />The only problem is that freakin' Eddie Vedder does the soundtrack for the movie, which means all the emotional scenes in the film feature Eddie's distinct style.  I'm not a fan of his music (or Pearl Jam) so I find his singing more of a distraction than anything.<br /><br />Great movie.  You won't be disappointed.</p></br><a href="../users/A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX.html">A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX</a><br/><p>I was familiar with Krakauer from his previous book, Into Thin Air, about the ill-fated climb on Mt. Everest, so I was interested to see how a film based on this book would turn out. I haven't read the book, but I did enjoy the movie, and found it memorable in many ways, although some liberties were taken for artistic reasons.<br /><br />All the main players turned in superb performances, and Hal Holbrook (who I almost didn't recognize as I hadn't seen him on-screen in probably 25 years), was a joy to watch; he turns in possibly his greatest performance in a long, distinguished career as the aging preacher. He must be about 80 and looks pretty darn good for his age. He turns in a thoughtful but forceful performance as a man, who, although nearing the and of this life, has found the peace that Chris unsuccessfully seeks.<br /><br />Emile Hirsch is outstanding in the lead role as Chris, in which he's portrayed almost as a mythic adventurer of old setting out to test himself against the elements. He's charismatic and collects many friends and admirers along the way. Cris is convinced that he must purge the "evil within," why this is, isn't really explained, except that Chris had fallen under the influence of authors such as Thoreau, and others who had exhorted the importance of living apart from society in order to live the solitary life and reflect.<br /><br />The cinematography is also one of the film's great strengths. You'll enjoy the many stunning vistas of Alaska, which is still largely an unspoiled and unexploited land. Let's hope it stays that way.<br /><br />Overall the film is a dramatic and beautiful portrayal of a young man's quest for meaning, allthough it ultimately ended in tragedy, Despite some departures from the facts (Chris was not the charismatic character that was portrayed in the movie so much as a loner), it's still a fine film and one worth seeing for the other aesthetic qualities it brings to the screen.<br /><br />While we're on the subject, I wanted to make a few comments on another topic. I've read several Alaskan's comments who were very critical of Chris and what he tried to do, saying how foolish it was and how it showed little respect for the wilderness and the sort of skills and learning it takes to survive under those conditions, which can only be gleaned from many years of experience, and preferably under the tutelage of an experienced backwoodsman.<br /><br />That is no doubt true, and it's certainly true that Chris made some serious mistakes that an experienced backwoodsman wouldn't have made. For example, he failed to bring a map of the region that would have showed an area about 25 miles upstream where it spread out into some wide shallows, where the river could have safely been forded. There was also a hand tram only about a mile away from his camp that would have enabled him to escape. And he brought inadequate food and wasn't experienced enough in plant identification to live off the land, which led not only to starvation but poisioning when he misidentified a toxic plant that looked like a safe plant and that often grew right next to it.<br /><br />However, I would point out that those same people still buy their outdoor gear at REI, or some such, and have many modern conveniences that frontiersman or tribesman of old didn't have, which dramatically reduce the amount of labor and skill required and enhance their chances of survival. Not to mention the skillset of a late period Paleolithic hunter, who had to make his own spear tips and spears, bow and arrows, his own clothes, and virtually everything else in his toolkit himself. Even a modern woodsman's skills would pale by comparison to that.<br /><br />Recently I read a great biography of Daniel Boone and of his exploits in the new territories to the west. Of course, even he wasn't a Paleolithic hunter, but he was certainly one hell of a woodsman for his day. Equally impressive was the description of his wife. While Boone was off for several weeks wandering in a new area of the wilderness, leaving his young wife at home, she first proceeded to cut down the trees on their new plot of land. Then she built a small log cabin from the felled trees. Finally, she had their first field plowed and the crop sowed on the now cleared land by the time Boone got home. :-)<br /><br />Today, few people, even the vaunted backwoodsmen who criticized Chris, are the equivalent of a Daniel Boone, let alone a true Paleolithic hunter. While this doesn't excuse what Chris did, the perhaps sad truth is that hardly anyone living today has the skills of our ancestors that were honed over hundreds of thousands of years before they vanished in the wake of modern "civilization."</p></br><a href="../users/A2R1HAXRNU0QX7.html">A2R1HAXRNU0QX7</a><br/><p>Let me come right and admit that I dislike Sean Penn a great deal.  His politics are infantile, silly and represent Hollywood's penchant for knee-jerk liberalism at its worst.  His trips to Iraq are an embarrassment.<br /><br />But let me also admit that he truly is an artist to be reckoned with.  From his wonderful performances in FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH through is Oscar-winning work on MYSTIC RIVER, he has proven himself a unique talent.  And now his skills as a director cannot be overlooked either.  His past efforts as a director had merit, but with films like THE PLEDGE, he allowed himself an indulgent pace, and the movies meandered a bit.  They still showed skill...but only now, with INTO THE WILD, can he truly be called a director of importance.<br /><br />Based on the terrific book from Jon Krakauer (who also wrote the MUST READ "Into Thin Air"), INTO THE WILD follows the true-story of Chris McCandless, a young man who drops out of life in a serious, disturbed way.<br /><br />McCandless comes from a family of privilege.  Raised in the south, we see him graduating from prestigious Emory College, and telling his folks he's thinking of Harvard Law.  He clearly has a lot of issues with his folks and their materialism...but at first blush, he seems like little more than an upstart college kid who was raised in a cushy enough life to be able to readily shower disdain on money & materialism.  A poor kid would never do this.  He seems very close to his younger sister (Jena Malone), as they are united in their disregard for their parents (Marcia Gay Harden and William Hurt).<br /><br />Turns out, Chris is going to drop out of their lives completely.  He gives away all his money and sets out on the road with his beat-up car, eager to "see America" and to live off the land (although frankly, living off the land for him seems to require lots of begging for money, taking handouts and eventually, when his car is trashed, accepting rides).  He even changes his name to Alexander Supertramp.  He's a drop-out on a mission to erase his past life as well.  He NEVER touches base with his family, even his beloved sister.<br /><br />Eventually, he becomes more and more eager to tear himself away from the trappings of civilization, and he goes to the wilderness of Alaska, IN THE WINTER to live on his own.  He has almost no survival skills, and if not for stumbling upon an abandoned bus that had obviously once been used as a campsite, he probably would have died in a day or two.  As it is, his time in Alaska stretches on for weeks or months, and that's all I want to tell you, in case you didn't know how this story turns out.<br /><br />Chris (or Alex) is a supremely annoying character to me.  I'm a man in my 40s with kids of my own, and so naturally I bristle at his cavalier hatred for his parents.  And I'm also annoyed at his thoughts on dropping out, which as I said seemed to involve mooching off of others.  As though our society owed it to him to support his noble desire to have no possessions, responsibilities, etc. etc.<br /><br />But here's the surprising thing...as much as part of me disliked this young man and his questionable mission, I was drawn deeper and deeper into caring about what happened to him nonetheless.  Penn, and especially his young star, Emilie Hirsch, do a masterful job over the films 2.5 hour running time of making you empathize with this guy.<br /><br />As we learn more about his relationship with his parents, we see that while he might be over-reacting, he does have legitimate gripes that go deeper than we thought at first.  He's trying to erase his identify, because it's been built on a lie in the first place.  He truly wants to strip away anything that reminds him of them and their world.  At first, just distance helps...but he begins to see that he himself needs to be laid bare.  He has an almost primal need, not to commune with nature, but to use that communion as a way of reducing him to just basic needs for food and shelter.  And at the end of the film, when we see that he has finally succeeded and has finally come full circle, it's a shattering moment.  Only then do we see the skill with which Penn (who also wrote the script) and Hirsch have led us.  We thought we knew what McCandless wanted from his journey...but what he came to was something different indeed.<br /><br />Most of the movie deals with McCandless' encounters with the various people he meets.  He spends time working on a wheat harvesting crew run by Vince Vaughan.  He lives for several months with Catherine Keener and her husband in a desert in Arizona.  And most touchingly, he befriends a old veteran played by Hal Holbrook.  It's nice to see Vaughan play a normal guy at more or less a normal level of energy, rather than his over-the-top antic-ness.  But it is Keener and Holbrook who threaten to steal the show.  Keener plays a "hippie" who has dropped out of life to get away from a terrible sadness of her own.  She has a burden she carries that makes her both love McCandless like a mother AND to understand the grief McCandless's mother must be going through.  She infuses her character with sadness and toughness in equal measure.  It's an almost perfect role for Keener, who has an almost unique quality to her...one of smarts, sexiness, sadness and empathy.  I think there's a fair chance she'll be nominated for an Oscar.  An almost slam-dunk Oscar nomination for Hal Holbrook, however.  It feels like years since I've seen him in anything, and the 20 minutes or so he is in this movie are as quietly powerful as any 20 minutes I've seen this year.  His character has shut off from the world and lived in insulated sadness for decades.  McCandless comes into his life and shows him that the world still has something to offer him.  Holbrook responds and begins to open up.  He takes on physical tasks he didn't dare before.  But he also begins to love the young man who has brought him this renewal...and he knows this kid is going to leave soon and never be seen again.  Holbrook is masterful in his scenes, and his final few moments are quite powerful.<br /><br />Another aspect of this movie to be savored is the sheer enjoyment of the beautiful American scenery.  We're taken all over the western half of our nation, and also to Alaska, and Penn allows plenty of time to take in the sights.  What a beautiful country the US is!!<br /><br />The movie is not perfect.  Sometimes Hirsch relies a little too much on just smiling beatifically at people, and the almost reverent response they have towards him is a bit much.  He does become a character that the viewer cares about...but sometimes Penn plays him off as too "pure."  He seems to have no interest in sex, for example...and this interesting aspect of his character is left unexplored and unexplained.  (Also, I got tired of Eddie Vedder's songs...his diction is so bad, it just sounded like whining.  And this is from a guy who sorta likes Pearl Jam.)<br /><br />This is a broadly sweeping movie about a very tiny subject...one troubled man whose journey of self-discovery led him in unexpected ways.  In the great scheme of life, it isn't terribly important.  Yet it reminds us that the human heart is unfathomable, that reactions aren't predictable AND most importantly, that we can grow and learn and come to accept what life has dealt us.  The movie is sad, yet quite uplifting.  It is a movie that finds forgiveness and redemption in unexpected places.<br /><br />So, it is with some chagrin that I must say I highly recommend this effort from Sean Penn.</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>Into the wild is the final outcome, an undeserved consequence of an abnormal state of things - around the not so common disagreements of a couple - produced in the core of the sensitive soul, that decided to seek refugee in the books of Jack London, Tolstoi and Thoreau to build his own reason to live. (You mat realize a certain resemblance respect Truffaut's 400 blows)<br /><br />This long expected project nestled over the years and finally materialized once he made the grade. He - like a modern Robinson Crusoe - will make his personal and circular process of growing up ( four well defined stages; childhood, adolescence, manhood and wisdom) through miles and miles of untamed territory, arresting landscapes to crown his most beloved dream: Alaska. Based on true events, this film slow and progressively involves us around every stage of this urban Odyssey until that tragic finale.<br /><br />Sean Penn undertook this project making use of these infinite landscapes, thinking about the promise of the New World  (Antonin Dvorak) and so many myths of personal bliss that nestle unconsciously in closed rooms of our souls. On the way, he will find vestiges of four previous generations, the hippie couple whose main problem is to have lost a son; an ironic mirror image about Alexander Supertramp wants precisely to avoid and even remember; the last encounter with Franz (superbly performed by Hal Hallbrook) was if I may the supreme moment of this poignant movie.<br /><br />One of the best American registers of the last year.</p></br><a href="../users/A56AA52NMMKYQ.html">A56AA52NMMKYQ</a><br/><p>Sean Penn offers a beautiful, though overly long and at times plodding adaptation of John Krakauer's best seller.  The story chronicles the westward odyssey of Chris McCandless, an over privileged suburban kid who is determined to live out a peripatetic bohemian existence and to somehow "find himself" in the rigors of nature.  The cinematography is beautiful.<br /><br />A series of vignettes offers mini-stories within the movie.  Chris as a farm hand. Living with vagabond hippies. Befriending an elderly widower who makes leather crafts.  (Hal Holbrooke is stunningly good in his role and, in my view, steals the movie.)<br /><br />What all of these encounters share in common is a pattern of McCandless engaging with other people but eventually stopping short of commitment, pulling away and forging on toward his Alaskan sojourn.<br /><br />A latter-day Thoreau and literary hermit, he meets his demise in an abandoned and isolated school bus in the backcountry wilderness. Perhaps McCandless should have spent more time burnishing his survival skills, training at NOLS or Outward Bound and spending less time reading "Dr. Zhivago."<br /><br />The movie offers interesting food for thought on how life's meaning is attained:<br />* Through books and learning<br />* Through conventional bourgeois pursuit of career, marriage and 2.5 children<br />* Through testing one's limits against nature in an isolated setting<br />* Through human connections and relationships<br /><br />McCandless is fixated on the "test manhood through nature" approach.  He dies an isolated, painful death, leaving a wake of heartbroken people behind him, not the least of which was his family, with whom he abruptly cut off communications.  In the end, Alexander Supertramp dies searching for the Truth.<br /><br />Did he find it?  Who knows.  The movie's closing only hints of this.  The candle that burns twice as bright lasts half as long.</p></br><a href="../users/A18758S1PUYIDT.html">A18758S1PUYIDT</a><br/><p>Even at 2 1/2 hours, this film does not drag or slow down at all.  It keeps you mesmerized the entire time as you watch the unfolding story of Chris McCandless, who burned his Soc. Sec. card, gave his money away, changed his name, and left West Virginia to trek across the U.S., with a life in the wilds of Alaska as his main goal.  Along the way, he meets a kindly hippie couple and a hippie girl that he might have stayed with had she been older; a lonely old man, played wonderfully by Hal Holbrook, who wants to adopt Chris; and a farmer who teaches him how to work in the fields.  Sadly, Chris's life ends when he eats a poisonous plant that he mistook for a safe one, and he starves to death inside an abandoned bus.<br />The one thing I wish Chris would have done was realize sooner that he needed other people and that it wasn't all about him all the time.  Also, he could have at least sent a postcard now and then to his parents and sister to let them know how he was doing.  However, this is not a flaw in the film.  It's the way things happened.  Penn does a marvelous job of directing, while Emile Hirsch ought to be nominated for his unpretentious, straightforward portrayal of Chris.  Eddie Vedder, in particular, provides excellent songs for the soundtrack, which I believe is worth purchasing.</p></br><a href="../users/A17JVVAKWEB0M.html">A17JVVAKWEB0M</a><br/><p>*SPOILER WARNING* If you know nothing of this story, nearly all reviews give away the "ending".  Therefore, if you don't want to know anything about the plot of the film, don't read any reviews...including this one.<br /><br />The book's cover tells the story; a young idealist from a well-to-do family gives away his money and possessions before trudging into the Alaskan wild on a quest for spiritual awakening.  Four months later, his body is discovered by moose hunters.  Christopher McCandless' story can be reduced to those few words, so why do readers of Jon Krakauer's book about McCandless trek twenty miles into the unforgiving wilderness to visit his final resting place?  Why has he become the center of a cult-like mythology and the inspiration for Sean Penn's graceful biopic?<br /><br />Like Krakaeur, readers of "Into the Wild" and other people who have heard of McCandless' story on television, in newspapers or around a crackling fire surrounded by wanderers, Penn became bewitched by the young man so certain of the redemptive power of natural purity, self reliance and isolation that he cast off his worldly possessions after an impressive academic career at Emory University and tramped throughout the Western US.  Unlike judgmental critics who can't understand the longing within McCandless to explore a life of innocence untouched by the trappings of society, Penn felt the same desires within and set out to capture the story on screen.  Even those who dislike Penn (count me among you) should see within him many of the same idealistic, uncompromising traits of McCandless and the same subtle disappointment at the world for not sharing his aesthetics.<br /><br />Penn's film is a remarkably consistent adaptation of Krakauer's work.  But just like the book, the film will receive mixed reviews from audiences.  Some people simply can't (or won't) listen to McCandless.  Whether there exists within the viewer a connection to the natural world, a desire to discern the boundaries of mankind's ability to survive in a perilous environment and a hunger for incorruptible truth and sometimes painful honesty will play heavily into the reward/enjoyment of the film.<br /><br />Chris McCandless never outlived the phase many young adults experience in their years after college or high school when they first realize the ugliness of the world.  Penn's film traces the last years of his life, showing his hero to be wide-eyed and childlike, as he holds to a simplistic belief that people just need to be good to each other to make the most out of their short time on earth.  On his odyssey tramping throughout the West, McCandless encounters a Homer-like string of splendid characters.  But even with a string of rewarding relationships with people who view him with a aura of mysticism, a Holden Caulfield-like epiphanies about deceit and phoniness of the world draws Chris to the one place he knows he can find truth: into the wild.<br /><br />FILM DIFFERENCES/STRENGTHS<br />The most obvious difference in the book and the film is the "suspense" created by holding off his death until the end.  While the book is an investigation into a dead man (although we see him certainly as a very vivid and vital dead man), the film keeps him alive until the very end.  Viewers unfamiliar with the story may wonder why the tale is even being told, especially when it seems he is about to walk to safety.<br /><br />I don't consider myself among the "the book is always better" crowd, because I think the film medium allows for unambiguous depictions of images, scenery, etc.  I was unfamiliar with the Lake Mead canyons where he kayaked or the channels that floated him into Mexico.  No description in a book could help me see those things like the film does.  Penn also takes advantage of a great device where he uses uncomfortable camera angles and quick, jerky cuts whenever Chris is in a city and juxtaposes them with spectacular views from some of the more beautiful stops of Chris' life.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FG91CM8221X1.html">A1FG91CM8221X1</a><br/><p>I'm probably in the minority in having gone to see Sean Penn's film version of "Into the Wild" without having first read Jon Krakauer's book. The movie has met my most stringent test: it made me want to go out and buy the book immediately. I had always thought of Chris McCandless as some sort of suicidal fool, but Penn opened my eyes to another, completely different interpretation: that McCandless was in the great tradition of American wanderers, from Daniel Boone forward, who sought distant horizons and a more intense, more direct engagement with nature and life. We're used to hearing the success stories in wilderness adventure; McCandless' story, alas, ended tragically, through a series of misfortunes and miscalculations such as (at least according to Penn) could have befallen most people in the same situation. But, as Penn shows us, McCandless' two years of wanderings across America before meeting his end in the Alaskan wilderness were quite a ride. Working from his own screenplay and with the aid of the brilliant photographer Eric Gautier, Penn presents McCandless as an intelligent, educated young man who sought escape for the usual reasons: an unhappy home life and a general disgust with the materialism of American life, particularly as represented by his family. McCandless' experiences on the way to Alaska, and the people he meets along the way, lead him finally (again, at least according to Penn) to the revelation that happiness is not a solitary emotion; it must be shared. Unfortunately, he comes to that conclusion too late. I can't help but wish that, before his journey, McCandless could have met John Haines and had the benefit of his advice. Haines, another educated young man who went to roughly the same part of Alaska as McCandless and homesteaded there successfully for the better part of 40 years, in the meantime writing some of the best American poetry of the latter half of the 20th century. (At the time McCandless left for Alaska, Haines was teaching in the Jenny McKean Moore program at George Washington University; I was one of his students there.) However much Penn's movie diverges from Krakauer's book or the reality of McCandless' life, there's no question his movie is a powerful experience, enhanced by the honest, thoughtful and emotionally direct performance of Emile Hirsch as McCandless. The supporting cast is also noteworthy, including William Hurt, Marcia Gay Harden and Jena Malone as McCandless' family and Brian Dierker, Catherine Keener, Vince Vaughn and Kristen Stewart as folks McCandless meets in his travels. The best supporting performance is by Hal Holbrook--these days looking more like T.S. Eliot than Mark Twain--as an elderly desert-dweller who takes a grandfatherly interest in McCandless.</p></br><a href="../users/A27H9DOUGY9FOS.html">A27H9DOUGY9FOS</a><br/><p>When I read Jon Krakauer's "Into the Wild" approximately ten years ago, I was mesmerized by the tragic real-life tale of Christopher McCandless.  But as much as I loved the book, I never even thought about a film adaptation.  Maybe that was shortsighted of me.  Recounting McCandless's life and reconstructing it with minimal data and much introspection, "Into the Wild" succeeded as a cautionary adventure of idealism gone awry.  Much of McCandless's life was lived alone and much of his story was pieced together though brief encounters or recovered writings.  So what was a thoughtful portrait on the page never really seemed like it would translate to the screen--certainly not with the same impact.  Luckily, though, Sean Penn thought otherwise.  Adapting and directing Krakauer's fine book, Penn has fashioned a sad, funny and exciting film with tremendous emotional resonance.<br /><br />An affluent and likable young man, McCandless graduated with honors from Emory University and then set a course to redefine his life.  Abandoning his family, friends, and material possessions--McCandless assumed the pseudonym of Alexander Supertramp and set off to explore the world in its most innocent form.  Living off the land and experiencing nature, fellow travelers, and much adventure--McCandless was looking for a modern day utopia and sought to discover his real self as he cast away the corruptions of modern life.  Touring the country for two years, McCandless's exploration was to culminate in an Alaskan sojourn--where he would commune with "the wild."  His aspirations can be viewed as both admirable and delusional--but that is part of the complexity of McCandless's life.  As much as you want him to succeed, you realize there can be no happy ending with the expectations he has in place.<br /><br />Penn's "Into the Wild," thus, depends on evoking a McCandless that you will care about--either because you commend his pursuit or because you want him to come to his senses.  And it really works in combination.  In a dynamic performance, Emile Hirsch transcends his previous work and becomes a full-fledged leading man.  Hitting all the right notes, Hirsch creates a character who evokes our sympathy, our frustration, and even our laughter.  McCandless meets a lot of companions on the road, and Hirsch makes it easy to see why he was so accepted.  A great role--Hirsch meets all the emotional challenges and also makes a physical transformation that is a both startling and powerful.  His great work is matched by a roster of big names including Vince Vaughn, William Hurt, Jena Malone, and Marcia Gay Hardin (among many others).  But Catherine Keener and Hal Holbrook are real stand-outs--their adoptive relationships with Hirsch both challenge him and make him understand (eventually) that life is not meant to be lived alone.<br /><br />If there is any flaw in the film, it exists in the book as well.  We can only know so much about McCandless from the resources available.  He had a heightened sense of injustice particularly when it came to the "untruths" or perceived wrongs perpetuated by his family.  Nothing presented, however, can explain how his relatively normal dysfunction blossomed into such an extreme world view.  This secret is in McCandless's mind alone.<br /><br />"Into the Wild" works as a character study and a gritty drama, but also as an adventure.  The scenery and photography are breathtaking and the action sequences are well executed.  There is much genuine warmth and humor in the film as well.  It was a fully satisfying film experience, to me, and has many quiet moments that have stayed with me.  Highly recommended for serious adult audiences.

I've broken this review down into seven different sections for obvious reasons, as each section is something that should be addressed when talking about either this film, this book, the people involved from the actors to the McCandless's to Sean Penn himself.<br /><br />The Book -<br /><br />There are probably more people that will initially come to this film because of the book than the other way around; but over time this film will be seen by more people that haven't read the book or possibly even be aware of a book. That's not a critique of the material, just a plain fact. More people watch films than read books these days.<br /><br />The story of Chris McCandless though, should start with the book and how Krakauer started a snowball with a simple article in `Outdoor' Magazine which A LOT of people who had met Chris (as Alex) had responded to with comments like: "Hey, I met him trying to hitch a ride ..." Jon Krakauer spent a lot of time putting the book together through accounts, phone calls, letters and meetings to find out how the information of Chris all come together; and more importantly how Chris had touched the lives and made such a stand-out impression on each of these very random people that he came across. In fact, Chris made such an impression on these people that some people read the article and wrote Krakauer stating: "This guy sounds like a guy I met near the Salton Sea, etc."  This is the real essence of how this story really came together and people should be aware of it. All of this transpired BEFORE the book. Someone had even heard the story of a dead hiker found in Alaska on Paul Harvey and Westerberg thought it might be him so he called the Alaskan authorities. Strangely, the Paul Harvey piece was how I had first heard of McCandless as well. So, knowing what you know now, maybe having read the book and seen the film, one must give proper credence to the impact of Chris McCandless in the lives of the people he met. I'll come back to this point later.<br /><br />The Screenplay & Film -<br /><br />Having watched hundreds of films through the years and then going back and listening to the Director's Commentary whenever possible, I've learned a great many things. Foremost, which is relevant to this story, is how Robert Zemeckis worked with several writer's over the course of a handful of years sharpening the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXA2">Forrest Gump</a> adapted script. Anyone who had seen the film and read the book, knows the point that's coming. Sometimes the spirit of the material is more important than the bulk of the material. In the case of Forrest Gump, I believe Zemeckis stated that the screenplay went through three different writers and multiple revisions until the last person, Eric Roth had figured out what Forrest Gump was really about. Christopher McCandless's story was surely about the spirit of the material; and definitely not about the bulk, which is how it comes across on the screen as delivered -- and very choppy at that.<br /><br />Sean Penn adapted this directly from the book, decided which parts to focus on and what to leave out. The real problem seems to stem from Penn not wanting to get into the middle of the McCandless / Supertramp dynamic which was painfully obvious in the book, but Penn tries to maintain the high ground of being impartial which doesn't really serve the story. Sean Penn probably would've been better served leaning one way or the other regarding McCandless and showing us "why" through the film, rather than leaving it ambiguous. The whole point of being there, was to be transported to a point of view.<br /><br />Christopher McCandless was not a middle-of-the-road / dry-journalism kind of guy. I will say that this long drawn out, meandering approach worked well for Penn with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005PJ6Q">The Indian Runner</a>, an older film of his which is one of my top ten films of all time. In Indian Runner, Penn let the viewer decide and observe the true nature of Frank Roberts, wickedly played by Viggo Mortenson. Viggo emoted so thickly, so heavily and breathed such life into the character that you couldn't help but be compelled - no matter how long the movie was. When it ended you were looking everywhere for more footage, maybe a book, a Bruce Springsteen album, footnotes, anything that would give you more about what you had just seen. But with Chris, Penn should've made a decision about which was a greater loss - Supertramp or McCandless, simply because Frank was a fictional character, while Chris was not.<br /><br />Ignoring the psychological breakdown and split of the character should've been the touchstone of this movie, but it wasn't. The split, Alexander Supertramp, was treated as just a shallow creation or a childish whim by a foolish youth - instead of the self-absorbed superman from Nietzsche's `<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1845882423">"Thus Spake Zarathustra"</a>' that Chris had imagined himself to be which seemed to take root while he was at Emory. Most of the readers of the Krakauer book seemed to have bonded with the idealistic Supertramp, rather than the foolish McCandles that the readers of Outdoor Magazine unanimously gave a thumbs down to for the fear of being a reckless role-model to other readers and enthusiasts.<br /><br />This film does not tell the story from the perspective of Alex Supertramp, although it tries to shed light to it. It also does not tell the story of Chris McCandless, although it tries to convince us of this, by wrapping itself in the facts that were collected by Jon Krakauer and passing itself as a film version with the same title.<br /><br />However, some of the book's complicated undertone of sadness, confusion, and idealism are lightly palpable in the film. Chris McCandless was a romantic; Krakauer's book appreciates that, as well as Chris's youthful idealism and smugness. But unfortunately, the film seems to miss most of this.<br /><br />A real, and massive breakdown in this film was the use of narration. While I am a huge advocate of V.O. Narration, a case exists here for the absence of one. Having Jena Malone, of Donnie Darko fame, and a mediocre talent, speaking her inner thoughts over scenic footage does this film a serious disservice, comes across as inconsistent and tacked on for effect. There were many other ways to tell this story better, but sometimes good books do not always translate into good movies.<br /><br />The Music -<br /><br />Eddie Vedder, like Sean Penn, is difficult as a personality to separate from his art due to certain  things that have transpired in the last decade. Anytime I hear Pearl Jam these days, all I can hear is a talented musician who wasted himself indulging in his own flaws - strangely much like McCandless, except Vedder did this with his career and not his life. Vedder thought that it was appropriate to repeat and stick with the now-dead North-West sound which is the last bastion of Seattle Grunge. Granted, this soundtrack is probably the biggest departure for him in a long time, but looking at the contribution of his work for this film, one is left wondering - why Vedder? The music sounds uninspired and dull, where nothing really stands out thematically and there actually seems to be a void where a musical theme should be. Penn should've befriended Gabriel Yared as the first choice to do the score. But I find this just one more bad choice in a long line of bad choices made by Penn for the production of this movie. Going back to Indian Runner, which has a great score and a well-placed soundtrack, it seems as if the magic just couldn't be duplicated for what would've been a great film and probably an equally great soundtrack and score.<br /><br />I do want to state that I don't agree with the Awards Academy that the music comes off as "too song based", whatever that means. I think that's one of the most ridiculous statements ever to come out of whatever administration Hollywood has. I also believe that, even though I didn't like it, Vedder should at least been nominated for his efforts for an Oscar.<br /><br />The Actors -<br /><br />I'm holding the minority report on this one, but I really don't believe that Emile Hirsch was all that good in this film. Yes, he has a basic resemblance to McCandless as any young, mousy haired twenty-something actor would. McCandless was a magnetic personality that people were struck into awe by when they met, even once. Emile Hirsch has none of those qualities, if he does, they certainly weren't evinced in this movie. I feel he came off bland and gave a very weak performance of McCandless, which actually bordered on shameful and pedestrian. It was if someone had asked him to play Jesus Christ and he decided that maybe a hollow representation of Truman Capote was more appropriate. Emile Hirsch's acting in this is the real Achilles heal here and couldn't have been further off the mark. There could've been so many other actors who would've handled this role with more realism, energy and vivaciousness. Emile Hirsch's rendition of McCandless is pretty sad to say the least, he was filler for those just wanting to navel-gaze.<br /><br />The casting director and Penn set up a would-be Oscar dream-tream with the supporting cast. Hal Holbrook gives his "John Wayne" performance here and does so magnificently and very memorably. Catherine Keener is dynamic, William Hurt (my favorite actor in this)  is magnetic, delivering a strong and convincing portrayal of the person you encounter when you read the book and Vince Vaughn is a nice choice for Wayne Westerburg. So what could go so insidiously wrong here?<br /><br />The Critics -<br /><br />A lot has been said regarding what was left in and what was left out, differing between the book and the movie. It should be stated that McCandless had a basic road map of the area, some money, his identification cards and some have speculated -- a broken or injured arm. Some cite the picture of Chris in front of the bus  as evidence-light. Looking closely at his right arm, it appears not to in the sleeve but under his shirt wrapped in a sling. In a later photograph though, he's seen with both arms visible and free from sling or obvious injury.<br /><br />I have posted both photos above for those interested to see.<br /><br />Chris M. / Alex S. -<br /><br />What would Christopher J. McCandless say about all this? How would he have felt about a feature film immortalizing and lionizing his deeds for better or worse?<br /><br />McCandless did want to become a writer, this much is known from the friends he met and made. Had he lived, he would've wanted to chronicle his adventures, and maybe becoming famous for it. If he did, it would've been an after effect and if a film was made of his works -- spoils of war, so to speak. But this is all hyperbole and supposition now. The truth is no one would want the worst decisions of their early twenties to be the defining moments of their lives and then be broadcast across the globe for all to see without any say.<br /><br />Alex Supertramp would've loathed the telling, the filming and the mass marketing of this effort. Alex would've wondered where the spirit and the fire and the message was had he sat in a theatre and watched this play out. Perhaps this was the problem McCandless's parents had when they saw this during the screening, maybe they "felt the lack of it", to quote Penn from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005PJ8T">another movie</a>. Having been author to anti-establishment writing, I may be a little biased in my viewpoint. I only state this as some readers of this review might click on my other reviews or see my writings and then feel that I was being inconsistent. While I can understand McCandless and see the world of which he spoke of, as an ex-Marine and a long-distance hiker of the Appalachian trail, of his methods and planning - I cannot abide. So, like many other readers and viewers, I too have a split opinion of McCandless.<br /><br />Sean Penn -<br /><br />Like I stated about Vedder, it's hard sometimes for consumers of art to sometimes remove their view of the artist from the art and therefore see it unobstructed. Sean Penn has done and said many things in the last numerous years to anger enough people, and isolate himself with his point of view. Maybe making a film about a man who railed inwardly in anger over consumerism, urban blight and gross waste and personal attachment was more powerful and greater than anything he could've said or done by himself. So, at least in the spirit of the thing, he does deserve that much credit - if that was the case. Otherwise, many viewers might see this movie and only witness the smugness of Chris McCandless and the smugness of Sean Penn, and thus walk away disappointed and regretful of the time spent. That, at least, does sum up much of the bad reviews so far about this film.<br /><br />Living on the West Coast, in Los Angeles, I've actually crossed paths with Penn a few times so far in life. The last time was in San Francisco, when I was spending a long day at the bar drinking at Tosca's in North beach. It's the kind of place that most people, tourists included don't go, because they just don't understand the allure; which is absolutely fine by me. My exchange with him was brief and cordial. If I would've seen this movie first, I would've probably had a lot more to say to him.<br /><br />I wanted to give this more stars because I do appreciate Sean Penn's contribution to film, his acting and his temperament. I also wanted to give it more stars for Chris McCandless, but ... it's more a review of the film than it is of any one person.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R8PXSFGY9MC2.html">A3R8PXSFGY9MC2</a><br/><p>'Into The Wild' is a very gentle, introspective film that had me engrossed the whole way through. Emile Hirsch's performance draws you immediately into his characters (Chris') pursuit of a free, unfettered life, in touch with nature and it's finer elements. You understand his idealism and his strong focus to achieve his aims. Sean Penn directed this film superbly. One part that stands out is when Chris goes into a big city and his feelings of disconnect and alienation. Penn manages to show these emotions (using various film and camera techniques) with real skill and you feel as awkward and out of place as Chris does. The soundtrack is awesome, with music by Eddie Vedder and it really adds to the overall feel of the film. You can really see the benefits of this type of lifestyle and a part of you yearns to follow the life Chris did and to experience life, relationships and nature on a fundamental, stripped back level. Having read the book I was aware of the general story and this film is remarkably faithful to it, there are very few deviations. In addition, I felt none of the frustrations with Chris' attitude that I felt when reading the book. Being portrayed on the screen and acted so well, I understood the mindset a little more. He is shown to be more naive in the book than in the film, but this made the film a better viewing experience, they are different media after all. This film offers some insightful ideas and philosophy, but you aren't spoon fed them or have them rammed down your throat, which is a refreshing change from a Hollywood film. With amazing locations, excellent acting, top direction and an inspired soundtrack this makes for one great film and one I highly recommend.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></br><a href="../users/ABN5K7K1TM1QA.html">ABN5K7K1TM1QA</a><br/><p>But don't make a mistake.<br /><br />The theme of this emotionally wrenching drama (script and direction from Sean Penn, from a best-selling nonfiction book by Jon Krakauer) is not man versus wild, as it was in the works of one of the protagonist's heroes, Jack London.  Instead the conflict is between man and society.  Chris McCandless has just graduated from college.  His parents are proud.  His grades are good enough for a top grad school.  He's bright, personable.  It seems he has everything going for him.<br /><br />But he's bitter and disappointed.  He disrespects his parents and believes that the last thing he wants to do is act out their idea of success.  So he gives the $24,000 he has in the bank for grad school to charity and just ups and leaves home.  He has some Kerouac-like adventures on the road where as a "leather tramp" he meets some ordinary people, some good people, some retro hippies, some Middle American farm workers, some derelicts and a social worker in L.A., a pretty girl, an old man, etc., and then, believing "you don't need human relationships to be happy," it's north to Alaska to live out a dream that might have been dreamt by Thoreau or Jack London.<br /><br />But we know from the very beginning of the film that Chris McCandless AKA "Alexander Supertramp" will die in the Alaskan wilderness at a tender age in 1992.  Was his death the result of stupidity regarding the dangers of going "into the wild" or was it a result of bad luck or accident?  Or was it the indirect result of the hypocritical and mercantile values of his parents and his society to which he overreacted?  Or even, was it the indirect result of a kind of youthful bravado that could overtake many a young man?<br /><br />What Chris does is what a renunciant in an Eastern religion might do: he leaves society to live alone in the woods.  He renounces society's shallow values and lives as simply as possible.  But Chris is not practicing an Eastern religion.  He is not an old man near the end of his life looking for moksha.  He is under the influence of Thoreau and Jack London, whose books he has read and loved.  He wants to test himself against the wild without help from anyone.  He wants to prove his manhood to himself without the help of society or society's culture.<br /><br />But he is a greenhorn in the Alaskan wilderness whose fate is sealed.<br /><br />The way that Jon Krakauer and Sean Penn have reconstructed this story (partly from notes and even from some carvings that Chris made, and partly from interviews with people who knew Chris) we see that at one point after some weeks in the wilderness Chris suddenly realizes something profound and moving.  He says, referring to the great beauty of life and the world that he is able to see: "Happiness is only real when it's shared.."  At that point he has learned what he needed to learn from the wilderness and from the people he met in his trek across the country.<br /><br />The great tragedy of this movie is what then befalls Chris.<br /><br />The ending is emotionally gut-retching and yet somehow cathartic.  To watch such a likeable, honest and spiritually advanced young man with such potential seem to throw it all away, carelessly, foolishly, or accidently, is a human tragedy brilliantly brought to the printed page and to the screen for all of us to share.  And in this sharing Chris's life gains new meaning and he becomes a guide and a teacher for all of us.<br /><br />I know it must have been very difficult for his parents to cooperate in the telling of Chris's story since the story does not show them in a favorable light.  Yet the very fact that they helped bring Chris's story to us shows perhaps where Chris got his moral courage.  I have no doubt that it was their deep love for their son that moved them to find that emotional courage.  This movie gives meaning to Chris's life and shows their love for him, and allows a wide audience to see that he did not die in vain.<br /><br />I want to congratulate not only Krakauer and Penn but also Emile Hirsch who played the part of Chris McCandless.  The role was enormously demanding, the sort of role that an actor may only get once in a lifetime, if he's lucky.  And Hirsch played it well.  He was charming and witty and very strong of character.  What a splendid tribute to the real Chris.  And kudos to Hal Holbrook who played Ron Krantz to an emotional tee, deeply sympathetic to both his character and to Chris's, and to the significance of the film itself.<br /><br />And the rest of the cast was also very good, although Kristen Stewart was a little too pretty for the part of the 16-year-old trailer troubadour, and of course William Hurt could have used a larger role.<br /><br />The lesson of this story, it seems to me is this: Young people of courage and honor, even though they may make mistakes, even though they may be mistaken at a fundamental level, can, through their valor, teach us all something important.  As Chris told Ron Krantz, "Get off your butt, old man.  The core of a man's spirit comes from new experiences."  What he is also saying is: live every moment in a genuine way.  And we can see that is what Chris did.  A life so lived, although short, may well be the equal of a much longer life lived not so authentically.</p></br><a href="../users/A2OFSDJB3MVQ16.html">A2OFSDJB3MVQ16</a><br/><p>I've seen this excellent film twice, once in the theatre and again on video. Can't understand why it only received just 2 oscar nominations while a lesser film like "There Will Be Blood" received more despite Day-Lewis' excellent performance (that film left me hollow). Am contemplating whether to get this in HD since Paramount has said it will be their last release in that format. Emile Hirsch should have received at least an nomination and Penn himself for Best Director.  One could argue about Chris' tragic fate but in the end he lived it the way he wanted and not by society's standards--so can we say it was wasted?!  The various persons he touched during his journey proved the validity of his life. The entire supporting cast was excellent and this is probably Penn's best film since his debut feature, "The Indian Runner". Let's hope he continues directing!!</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>At first, I wasn't sure how to feel about INTO THE WILD. I'd read the book a few years ago and enjoyed it, but it left me feeling a bit bitter about someone as privileged as Chris McCandless (the main character/person in Jon Krakauer's nonfiction novel by the same name) who shuns his upper echelon possibilities after graduating from Emory and disappears into America, leading the free life of a moneyless vagabond.<br /><br />Certainly we've all thought about what it would be like to be completely unencumbered by the shackles of "things." No cars. No mortgages/rent. Nothing but the open road and endless options spreading out before us. And this is what makes us care for Chris McCandless, the unfortunate (and very misguided) young man who's fate is tied to his own ignorance of what that kind of life entails.<br /><br />If you speak to anyone from Alaska, most will tell you what an idiot McCandless was. He went into the wild with only a backpack and a rifle, supposedly "ready" to live the life of a hermit on a decrepit and abandoned school bus. The Alaskan wilderness (or any comparable wilderness really) is unforgiving. If you aren't prepared, you're going to die. And McCandless, with his lofty dreams of wildlife living, was ill-prepared in the extreme; his life cut short due to his own ignorance.<br /><br />So why the five star rating, you may ask? Well, I'm not here to support or degrade what McCandless did or didn't do. I'm here to rate the film, and on that, you can't help but appreciate what director Sean Penn has given us. Showing McCandless' strengths and weaknesses, Penn guides us through the life of Chris without telling us how to feel about it. Actor Emile Hirsch pulls in an extremely powerful performance as Chris McCandless. The fact that the Academy didn't recognize him is a shame; they did note Hal Holbrook's supporting actor performance (which was damn good), but a far cry from Hirsch's awesome job (he lost 40 lbs during the filming so that he could show McCandless' starvation). Penn's screenwriting and directing are flat-out amazing, giving us a story that allows the viewer to make his or her own judgements about this very enigmatic young man.<br /><br />I feel compelled to mention that some may compare McCandless' actions with those of another dead Alaskan visitor, Timothy Treadwell of the nonfiction film <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BMY2NS">Grizzly Man</a>. Although both certainly had their failings, Treadwell was definitely mentally ill, while McCandless simply seemed to lack life goals and instead substituted vagrancy in order to run away from problems back home.<br /><br />In the end, I finally came to the conclusion that Penn did exactly what all great film makers do: he gave us a story that many people probably would've found pretentious and plopped it into our laps without any filters or rose-coloring. That put the burden on the audience to come to terms with what McCandless' life really meant. Fool? Free-Spirit? Ignorant preppie? Loving brother? Easy-going drifter? Or perhaps a mesh of many of those.<br /><br />You decide.</p></br><a href="../users/A32K4BV5DFG3KP.html">A32K4BV5DFG3KP</a><br/><p>I very much liked the book Into the Wild, but somehow the movie misses what the book captured, it shows a very naive young man who acts very immature and insecure. I disliked how Chris was always shown running around and jumping off of ledges, overall it just reminded me of how a child acts. Also the way he acted around the hippie guy and also the Hal Holbrook character was very submissive and childlike. Chris was twenty five years old around these times it just really set me off the whole movie. I was really expecting to see Chris put his arms out like wings when he was running down the beach, and make an airplane noise. I really think that this movie could have been much better if Chris was presented in the right light. The book made him seem edgier rougher. For instance when the guy giving him a ride to the stampede gave him a ride ,asked if he had a hunting license, he said he did not need the F@$*ing government telling him to eat or not. Overall nice scenery somehow misses the character of a misunderstood man, comes up with an immature crybaby.</p></br><a href="../users/A1RSXP7MB772E3.html">A1RSXP7MB772E3</a><br/><p>You follow the unchained ambitions of a person we all have within ourselves and this movie with several messeges has one overpowering one left for the end that comes more as a consequence than as a hurtle that some character a writer created. I saw some glimmering greatness in this films pictures-like frames that reminded me in small ways of some of the more beautiful and free movies created. Days of Heaven came to mind by Terrence Malick. In a year full of nominated movies that not many people cared about, I couldn't help but think how maybe this great and accessible movie would have perhaps awoken a bigger reception. The jury of "who ever they are who votes" academy persons lost credit with me since this movie was overlooked, as well as Zodiac. What's wrong with this film that it shouldn't stand next to No country for old men, There will be blood, Micheal Clayton, Juno? I would replace nearly any of them in fact.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>One thing that can't be overstated about Sean Penn's `Into the Wild' is that it truly is a breathtaking cinematic experience.  The films vivid scenes are beautiful to watch and come alive in the viewer.  There are moments of such crisp realism that we feel we are right alongside McCandless in his journeys.  The Alaskan countryside is flawlessly depicted (although pictures never do anything justice...I've been there and I can honestly say it is the most beautiful place on mother earth...`Into the Wild' comes very close to capturing it though).  The action sequences are masterfully edited to where we feel one with them, like we are in that canoe or on that train or crossing that creek.<br /><br />Sadly though, what is visually breathtaking is no so much emotionally breathtaking.  By the close of the film we don't feel as though we really understand the man that is Christopher McCandless.  We come to know Alexander Supertramp but McCandless is a mystery.  Maybe this is because McCandless never truly found himself, but as the film draws to a close and we are supposed to feel the revelations this man is finally realizing I have to cry wolf.  As McCandless scribbles into his journal that he feels scarred and lonely I found myself scratching my head, because I never got that from him.  The film paints McCandless as one thing and one thing only; self absorbed.  He runs from human interaction and thrives on being one with nature.  That is all fine in itself but as the running time starts to give way to credits Penn tries desperately to prove McCandless has seen the folly in his ways and come to realize he needs human interaction to survive.  I guess maybe he attempts this too late in the film and only give the audience a good five minutes to embrace this concept.<br /><br />It doesn't quite work.<br /><br />The film follows the two-year journey of Christopher McCandless as he picks up after graduating college and sets off on an adventure of a lifetime.  He donates his entire saving to charity, burns whatever money he has left and hitches his way across the continent with nothing really but the clothes on his back and a few awkward supplies.  He sets his sights on Alaska, but he's not opposed to a few stops along the way.  From Colorado to Mexico and just about everywhere in between McCandless meets many people that supposedly shape the outcome of his outlook on life.  McCandless grew up in a house filled with yelling and fighting and threatened divorce.  Not that that doesn't take place in 75% of all homes in America but regardless, this is what he was up against.  Feeling as though he had no family he decided to leave everything behind and find himself.  What he found, or so we're told, was loneliness and fear; but of course that came after all the fun and excitement.<br /><br />Whatever must be said for the portrayal of McCandless it has nothing to do with the performance given by Emile Hirsch.  I am not usually moved or even impressed with this young man but this has to be his finest performance to date (the fact that he does all of his own stunts and loses Christian Bale amounts of weight here shows great dedication and also plays in his favor).  He seems to understand the selfishness that lives within his character and he exudes it in a very subtle way, one that could be justified by some as free-spirited but is without doubt selfish dependence.  The only place in which his performance falters is when he is asked to portray an ounce of regret as the film closes, but again I feel that is not his fault as much as it is the fault of the unfair time restraint placed on him by Penn.<br /><br />The entire cast rises to the challenge in this film, and while much of the film revolves around McCandless in his solidarity there is much to be said for actors who can do so much with so little.  Harden and Hurt may not be seen much if not within flashbacks, but they each have their own scenes of splendid bliss (the scene where Hurt collapses in the street broke my heart).  Jena Malone is poorly underused (I just love her) but makes an impression as Christopher's sister Carine.  I've never seen her look so beautiful, that's for sure.  Vince Vaughn seems a little out of place for me here but he manages to deliver well, and Kristen Stewart is just delightful as Tracy.  I remember watching her in `In the Land of Women' and thinking that she had much to offer if it were only tapped a little better and here she proves that that tapping is well underway.  Catherine Keener develops a beautiful character in Jan and Brian Dierker works off of his co-stars wonderfully as Rainey.<br /><br />Above all else, Hirsch included, is the magnificent Hal Holbrook.  His beautiful and touching portrayal of Ron Franz, the old man who takes Chris under his wing, is the most memorable supporting character in the film.  What Ron does with his small screen time (roughly fifteen minutes, give or take) is really more than anyone else does here.  His final scene with Hirsch is so moving, so touching and ultimately so heartbreaking.  I'm almost moved to tears just recalling it now.<br /><br />As a whole I think that `Into the Wild' is a well done film, it just misses the biggest mark it sets out to make; and that is of making McCandless a real person.  I have a few issues with some of the decisions made production wise with the film (like the horrible yellow writing that scribbles across the screen...which makes the film appear kind of cheap in a way) but they are not enough to knock stars off for.  No, the only reason this film does not receive a five star rating from me is the mere fact that the final five minutes or so try and paint Chris as a changed man, and five minutes is not long enough to convince me of that.  Had Penn given Hirsch a good twenty minutes to nurse the idea then maybe it would have been convincing, but sadly it was not.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL.html">A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL</a><br/><p>Sean Penn, who has proven himself to be an accomplished and intense actor, takes the director helm just as seriously.  His vision of Chris McCandless's life (via Jon Krakauer's book `Into the Wild') is simply stunning.  While most pictures that go outdoors give you some breathtaking scenes, this film makes the close shots of formidable and forbidding nature a staple element throughout the movie.  Having just watched the movie at a local cinema with a smaller screen, I was content, not needing a big screen TV or a visit to the I-Max.  To sustain a story and an outdoor adventure for nearly two and a half hours is a feat unto itself, but the characters and reflections are satisfying enough to take the audience to its destination.<br /><br />Besides Penn's perfectionism, we have a fine story told well.  Starting with Chris's real life journal, we go back and forth from his well-to-do family back to his destination on the outskirts of Fairbanks, and then trace back his journey along the way until he reached his destination.  Chris had all the trappings of success.  An "A" student with a wealthy family to help him along the way, something was, nevertheless, missing.  To fill in the gaps, his sister (Jena Malone) narrates part of the story, telling us about the family he left behind.  Then, he encounters all kinds of people from the working class farmers of South Dakota, to a latent hippie couple in Arizona, to a retired military man in California.  Like road stories from films like `Easy Rider' <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000022TSY">Easy Rider</a> to books like Kerouac's `On the Road,' <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0140283293">On the Road (Penguin Great Books of the 20th Century)</a> this is a high caliber road movie, even if the destination is off the beaten path. With all its grandeur and absorbing development, this movie reminded me of the truly excellent 'Never Cry Wolf,' <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001I55Y2">Never Cry Wolf</a> which this film has easily trumped.<br /><br />Trouble is Chris's problems don't resolve themselves with nature.  In his journal, he expresses his thought well and quotes the works of Thoreau, Tolstoy, and Pasternak who help him share his vision of happiness that can't be bought.  Nature can be quite unforgiving, but the wisdom Chris picks up along the way make his uncompromising attempt to live life on his own terms both laudably courageous and a cautionary tale told to the rest of us.<br /><br />All of the performances are as true to life as the footage.  Including William Hurt who gives us another laudable performance as Chris's driven father, Walt, a successful space engineer.  Emile Hirsch captures all the spirit and naivete' of Chris, and Marcia Gay Harden is perfect as the worried, doting mom.  But the real master is Penn who is able to share Chris's vision.  Meaningful, poetic, colorful, eventful, and magnificent in grandeur, `Into the Wild' is simply a cinematic Odyssey taken by a careful hand who wanted to make both the man and his journey unforgettable.</p></br><a href="../users/ANIMV3SPDD8SH.html">ANIMV3SPDD8SH</a><br/><p>This film is as earnest as a Mark Trails nature comic book adventure, but in telling the true story of Christopher McCandless, a college graduate who abandons convention and a promising career to hitchhike and live in the Alaskan wilderness, director Sean Penn, films a beautiful movie void of psychological or spiritual conviction, even while gorgeous landscapes, eagles soaring against the Alaskan sun, oddball eccentric Ameriana road characters pepper in, and a genuine empathy prevails for McCandless' compulsion to walk into the wild woods. There is a nagging doubt that underneath this nature loving idealist, who disappears without a trace to embark on his adventure,  lies a malice aimed at his concerned family who live in grief for years unknowing of his whereabouts and fate.<br /><br />In fact, Penn's inistence to include the McCandless family, (professional, upper-scale, worried sick about their missing son), prominently in the narrative is a superflous reminder of the past when a few well chosen words of dialogue would prevail. We want the great Alaskan wilderness adventure, and while we get that, we also get a whole lot of generation gap family soap which is suspect to significance. Scenes like the cap-throwing college graduation do little but make this a very long movie.<br /><br />We feel for McCandless in much the same way we feel for "Grizzly Man',the psycholgically leveraging photographer who also went into the Alaskan  wilderness, believing he could commune with the wild bears, but instead was eaten by them. Likewise McCandless had severe mental issues, that went beyond the call of the wild, in luring him to a wilderness camp where he was inept at hunting and eating wild game, unable to tell a poisonous plant from an edible one, and lived in an abandoned bus begging for a lead paint intolerance. Penn's god-like vistas of the great wilderness are in innoculated contrast to the frail, doomed, self renamed Alexander Supertramp.<br /><br />I expected to love this movie, and while I never even disliked it, (it's a cabin in the woods thing), in retrospect, the haunting image of the real McCandless at the end of the film, leaves him a sad and nearly pathetic man. Is this the intention of the film? To wonder what he was really running away from? When I was 19, I packed a bag and walked and hitchhiked the continental U.S. from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean. I too was looking for something but I trust it was not a desire to become a second-rate Thoreau. The film refuses to speculate on where McCandless' intention lied, or where his pain began. It has however conjured in me an absolute respect for him. In peace, bro -</p></br><a href="../users/A328547P5BGZC.html">A328547P5BGZC</a><br/><p>I loved this movie. I think everyone can relate in one way or another to Christopher Mccandless. "Into the Wild" is one of my favorite films of the year. The story is uplifting and heartwrenching at the same time, it will move you.<br /><br />If you buy the 2 disc DVD, watch the special features. I highly recommend also reading the book, to fully understand the movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A18MBO1U4DPY20.html">A18MBO1U4DPY20</a><br/><p>Into The Wild is a Sean Penn film. He is the same guy who acted in the film, Fast Times at Ridgemont High as the indulgent youth with standout hair. Like you, I haven't watched half of the films I've been meaning to watch in 2007, so the fact that i watched this film was a big deal. It was Eddie Vedder's Society that piqued my interest. I watched this film five days back but it's one of those rare philandering seaking films, the relevance of which substantiates in days from first viewing.<br /><br />Into The Wild is not for all audiences but just like the man in the film, a 23 year old like me found it quite appealing in ways not quite comprehensible. To say the film is beautiful and profound would be apt. There are many scenes and locations which make me wonder how reading the book might have been. I like reading books but due to lack of an attention span and patience with one's self, I will never get around to reading this book.<br /><br />The film had flaws but it's only because this cynic won't let go that easily. I thought his reasons for being the way he is were showcased in a way not quite parallel than might have been true. I don't think it was the circumstances in his family that led him to be the way he was  but moreover, it was the unquestionable zeal for life in comradery one finds with nature that would egg him on.<br /><br />To all my fellow 23 year olds, watch this film.<br />To all Eddie Vedder fans, check the soundtrack out.<br /><br />I'm now left wondering how I should update my boring sense of adventure. Into The Wild stays.</p></br><a href="../users/AAU7CAQIN5BAE.html">AAU7CAQIN5BAE</a><br/><p>that aching to see something tangible...that yearning in your belly that somehow ignites with passion, honor, happiness, sadness and all the other emotions one can muster?<br /><br />When the mood is just right and the world beckons you like an incantation, there is some surreal voice that grabs you by the collar one idle Sunday, as you are sitting alone for the first time in some years, eagerly awaiting one of your favorite stories from nearly a decade ago, now on the big screen in front of you, and you have to go to the potty so bad, but you are afraid to move from your seat as you dont want to miss a beat? Some aura prevails in the theatre and you want to just jump up and scream into the air, and cry and laugh and rejoice and make the world a better place, because it is, and it can be and the masterfullness of Penn brings the joy of Chris McCandless' life like I think perhaps few could. I am down with the nay sayers who say the film lacked this or that or whatever word stock and bantering, boring, 'streamlined' prose they want to use. The songs were so perfect for the settings they were in, and Vedder's voice added to the overall impact of the outcome of the film, just littered with emotions, and the sweeping lucid cinematography that we were welcomed to ignited the viewer to want to walkabout almost immediately. The songs were searing! The very close and introspective views of nature, instead from long angled shots were truly well done. Also the physical change in Hirsh was brilliant, especially at the end there when he took his shirt off in one of the scenes and to see the transformation from him a bit o' baby fat throughout, then eating organic and of course his eventually demise where he ate the wrong plant, was very well done, and I was having flashbacks to Bale in 'The Machinist' for a bit, albeit not as grotesque.<br /><br />Bill Hurt is always brilliant. I love his voice, his presence, there is just something about him ya know, something intrinsic that he just has a way with the ensemble he works with. To not say that Chris also had some mental instability, arguably would be doing the film an injustice, and I think Penn really brought that out in some scenes where Hirsh's mind was just littered with ideas, idealisms, and a million thoughts screaming out in the dark. Through all Chris's pure love of the wild, he must in turn have been screaming inside.<br /><br />In a time where films seem to lack anymore creativity in a tangible sense, 'Into the Wild' comes from nowhere and lands a punch on our hearts, and for me at least, it is surely needed in a time when we all seem to be searching for something more. In saying that I am reminded by a few lines I remembered from my youth, and I apologize for any inaccuracies as its from memory: "Nature gives you the impressions as if there were nothing else contradictory in the world; and yet, when you return back to the dwelling place of man, be it lofty or low, wide or narrow, there is ever somewhat to contend with, to battle with, to smooth and put to rights" [Goethe]<br /><br />And in that we find Chris McCandless. A shining star in an often weary world.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>For me, the only negative is that the film does drag a little at times, but I still never lost interest. The acting is very good here. Emile Hirsch is fantastic as the lead character and looks to have a promising career ahead of him. Vince Vaughn and especially Hal Holbrook are great supporting characters as well. The music (mostly by Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder) fits the movie like a glove. While sad and depressing at times, Into the Wild will either move you, or have you moving for the exits.<br /><br />4 out of 5 stars</p></br><a href="../users/A1TEMNM9ZEOLJ6.html">A1TEMNM9ZEOLJ6</a><br/><p>Why did this kid kill himself?

My main problem with it is that the main character is just a selfish loser. He just up and leaves everyone to go off and live in the wild??? He can't get over his past... oh boo hoo. Spare me. A lot of people have issues to deal with from the past, we don't just quit on life to go into the wild and take a vacation. He wanted to write a book, therefore his trek wasn't all about being one with nature. Nah, he had plans in his mind. I was glad at the end when he is rotting in the same nature that he wanted to live in. Not to mention that this movie felt like it was ten hours long... 3 stars for the directing, the scenery and acting. The story isn't all that great and the only thing I got out of it is to make sure you don't eat meat that flies have landed on and not to eat random plants in the woods. Otherwise, I'll stick to my life and trying to make a better world for those people I care about. This is just another movie created by the Limousine Liberals.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>I didn't love "Into the Wild", Sean Penn's new film based on the bestseller by Jon Krakauer.<br /><br />Chris McCandless (Emile Hirsch) graduates from Emory College, barely able to tolerate his parents (William Hurt and Marcia Gay Harden) attendance at lunch after the graduation. Eating with his parents and his sister (Jena Malone), he rebuffs their offer of a new car. What does he need a new car for? What does he need material possessions for? Chris embarks on a road trip, using the car to get as far West as possible. When it finally breaks down, he cuts up all of his ID, his credit card, and his driver's license and burns his cash and sets out on foot. His goal is to make it to Alaska and camp and commune with nature. He doesn't tell his parents where he is going, because they would surely send out people to track him down, so he gets a good months head start before they even realize he is gone. Along the way, he meets a couple of hippies (Catherine Keener an d newcomer Brian Dierker), a boss who becomes a friend (Vince Vaughn) and an elderly man who is extremely lonely (Hal Holbrook). Each of these people will help him with wisdom and insight along the way to his ultimate destination. Alaska. There, he finds an abandoned bus and sets up camp within the shelter.<br /><br />"Into the Wild" is an interesting story, and will hold your interest, but the directing style is extremely obtrusive and the lead character is a little too selfish to be likable.<br /><br />Based on a true story, there is apparently some debate about whether Chris' journey is an act of selfishness or self-discovery. I can see both sides of this argument. But I have to lean towards selfish. It is understandable, and identifiable, that he wants to get away from his parents. I think all people have had these feelings at least once in their life. And from our brief moments with his parents and some things we learn later, these feelings are understandable. But when Chris leaves, and doesn't communicate with his family, he also doesn't communicate with his sister. Throughout the film, we hear the sister provide voice over explaining what a close bond she and Chris share, how they coped with their parents, etc. Why wouldn't he call his sister at some point? The film is about his journey to Alaska, but he doesn't spend the entire film in Alaska. He is often near or has access to a phone. If he has such a close bond with his sister, it doesn't make sense that he would never call her, never send her a letter, never try to contact her and let her know he is all right.<br /><br />Penn has apparently wanted to make this film for a number of years. He only held off because he was waiting for the approval of the McCandless family. He finally got their approval and then made the film. The story is ripe with dramatic potential. A young man makes a journey of self-discovery, trying to fulfill his dream of living in the wilderness. But this dramatic potential is robbed, in many cases, because Penn uses a number of editing techniques and storytelling devices, which do nothing more than reinforce the feeling we are watching a film. Every time the actors start to approach anything near what the film should be, Penn splits the screen into a number of pictures, all showing Emile Hirsch as McCandless, and we immediately snap back to reality and realize "Hey, we're watching a film." Split screens (think TV's "24"), slow motion photography and other camera tricks all serve to draw the viewer out of what should be a small, intimate portrait of a young man`s journey.<br /><br />I read an article about Eddie Vedder's contributions to the film. Penn asked him to write some music and liked it so much, he asked him to write more, and they put a number of songs in the film. These moments are meant to be more background music, to give a little texture to this film portrait of McCandless' life but they also detract from the young man's journey. Most of the songs are simply Vedder humming, or making a tune with his deep voice. Very few actually have words. So it just seems a little odd to hear these strange sounds, as we watch the journey of a young man traveling through the wilderness.<br /><br />Emile Hirsch does a very good job. "Wild" is about his character's journey, and he is on screen for the majority of the film, so it is essential that we feel what he feels. If we don't feel the joy, the peace, the danger and the fright he feels, we have nothing to identify with. In a film of this nature, there are no other characters in a majority of the film, so if we don't identify with Chris, we have nothing to help us enter the story, no one to take us on the journey.<br /><br />I liked Hirsch's performance. Hirsch is turning into a very strong actor. He and Justin Timberlake were the standouts in the underrated "Alpha Dog" and has appeared in a number of other little seen films and had roles in television shows. In "Into the Wild" Hirsch brings a maturity to the role hinting at some of the performances he will deliver, some of the roles in his future.<br /><br />There are three pit stops in his journey. He first meets Jan (Catherine Keener) and her partner Rainey (Brian Dierker), two hippies who live in a camper and like to set up stakes with a community of like minded individuals in the desert. They earn a few dollars here and there, mosey along the road, and meet new people. In their discussions, they talk about Jan's son, whom she hasn't seen for a long time. This is a nice compliment to Chris' journey. Jan's comments have to make Chris think about the effect he is having on his own parents. Keener, as always, does a great job with her relatively small role. Brian Dierker is also very good. He realizes the emotional troubles his partner has, and seems to love her all the more for them.<br /><br />Then Chris meets Wayne (Vince Vaughn). Wayne is a bit of a wild guy, and he has a business of his own, so he hires Chris. They get along and work well together and form a friendship. Throughout the film, we see a letter or two Chris writes to Wayne, the letters writing out on the screen in bright big letters (remember the comment about Penn's directing style earlier?

Of all the questions (pseudo and real) that Sean Penn's latest film, Into The Wild, is so manifestly trying to provoke- and in a semi-retarded hippy-cum-tree hugger sort of way, this most basic and elemental plot point is never addressed. But, more on that later.<br />  The film is based upon the 1996 nonfiction bestseller by Jon Krakauer, about a spoiled rich white suburban boy who basically commits suicide in the Alaskan wilderness, although he is so painfully unaware of the real world that he does not even know his own dark- almost Objectivist, impulses, and where they will lead. The book the film is based upon was a good read, even if one might question the wisdom of making a martyr out of such a delusional narcissist as Christopher Johnson McCandless (Emile Hirsch)- the 24 year old who starved to death on the aforementioned bus, after accidentally poisoning himself with inedible berries, in the middle of Alaska's wilds, after adopting the pseudonym Alexander Supertramp.<br />  The lead character is simply annoyingly repellant- perhaps only Roberto Benigni's lead character, Guido, in the awful Life Is Beautiful, makes a viewer more actively root for the character's death. In that film the lead character is so annoying that one actually roots for the Nazis to kill him, and in this film McCandless is so pompous and the film so long (140 minutes, compared to a book barely over 200 pages) that, at the hour mark, one wishes he'd just die already, so one can vacate the theater. But, no relief will come for over an hour. But, as repellant as Chris McCandless, the character, is, the direction by Sean Penn- in his first truly big budget feature, is ATROCIOUS! Yes, Penn is a great actor, but his direction, and even worse screenplay, make this film a chore. Only some stellar acting, mostly by supporting actors, saves this film from total disaster.... That so many people identify and sympathize with this unfortunately deluded and hollow young loser bespeaks how little they even notice themselves, and their own flaws, much less the many other McCandlesses that proliferate in cafes across the nation. Life is as real, both for the good and ill, in a New York City deli, a doctor's waiting room, or in a tenement, as it is on the peak of Mount Everest, riding the tube of a forty foot wave in Hawaii, or trekking through the Amazon. McCandless never learned this for no one seemed to care enough to even try to stop him. Of course, even had they, he was so selfish and uncaring of others' feelings, that he likely would not have been deterred. And, Penn would likely not have cared to make a film about such a character, anyway.<br />  So, given the predetermined mess of this film, I return to the opening query- how did the bus, which the film refers to as `magic'- thank you to The Who, get there? A Google search reveals the bus was fortuitously left by a highway construction company, decades earlier, to be used as a waystation for hikers, hunters, and campers. Since everything else in this film is so obvious, I just thought you'd want to know that and, also, to avoid this film. Thank me later.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>I didn't love "Into the Wild", Sean Penn's new film based on the bestseller by Jon Krakauer.<br /><br />Chris McCandless (Emile Hirsch) graduates from Emory College, barely able to tolerate his parents (William Hurt and Marcia Gay Harden) attendance at lunch after the graduation. Eating with his parents and his sister (Jena Malone), he rebuffs their offer of a new car. What does he need a new car for? What does he need material possessions for? Chris embarks on a road trip, using the car to get as far West as possible. When it finally breaks down, he cuts up all of his ID, his credit card, and his driver's license and burns his cash and sets out on foot. His goal is to make it to Alaska and camp and commune with nature. He doesn't tell his parents where he is going, because they would surely send out people to track him down, so he gets a good months head start before they even realize he is gone. Along the way, he meets a couple of hippies (Catherine Keener an d newcomer Brian Dierker), a boss who becomes a friend (Vince Vaughn) and an elderly man who is extremely lonely (Hal Holbrook). Each of these people will help him with wisdom and insight along the way to his ultimate destination. Alaska. There, he finds an abandoned bus and sets up camp within the shelter.<br /><br />"Into the Wild" is an interesting story, and will hold your interest, but the directing style is extremely obtrusive and the lead character is a little too selfish to be likable.<br /><br />Based on a true story, there is apparently some debate about whether Chris' journey is an act of selfishness or self-discovery. I can see both sides of this argument. But I have to lean towards selfish. It is understandable, and identifiable, that he wants to get away from his parents. I think all people have had these feelings at least once in their life. And from our brief moments with his parents and some things we learn later, these feelings are understandable. But when Chris leaves, and doesn't communicate with his family, he also doesn't communicate with his sister. Throughout the film, we hear the sister provide voice over explaining what a close bond she and Chris share, how they coped with their parents, etc. Why wouldn't he call his sister at some point? The film is about his journey to Alaska, but he doesn't spend the entire film in Alaska. He is often near or has access to a phone. If he has such a close bond with his sister, it doesn't make sense that he would never call her, never send her a letter, never try to contact her and let her know he is all right.<br /><br />Penn has apparently wanted to make this film for a number of years. He only held off because he was waiting for the approval of the McCandless family. He finally got their approval and then made the film. The story is ripe with dramatic potential. A young man makes a journey of self-discovery, trying to fulfill his dream of living in the wilderness. But this dramatic potential is robbed, in many cases, because Penn uses a number of editing techniques and storytelling devices, which do nothing more than reinforce the feeling we are watching a film. Every time the actors start to approach anything near what the film should be, Penn splits the screen into a number of pictures, all showing Emile Hirsch as McCandless, and we immediately snap back to reality and realize "Hey, we're watching a film." Split screens (think TV's "24"), slow motion photography and other camera tricks all serve to draw the viewer out of what should be a small, intimate portrait of a young man`s journey.<br /><br />I read an article about Eddie Vedder's contributions to the film. Penn asked him to write some music and liked it so much, he asked him to write more, and they put a number of songs in the film. These moments are meant to be more background music, to give a little texture to this film portrait of McCandless' life but they also detract from the young man's journey. Most of the songs are simply Vedder humming, or making a tune with his deep voice. Very few actually have words. So it just seems a little odd to hear these strange sounds, as we watch the journey of a young man traveling through the wilderness.<br /><br />Emile Hirsch does a very good job. "Wild" is about his character's journey, and he is on screen for the majority of the film, so it is essential that we feel what he feels. If we don't feel the joy, the peace, the danger and the fright he feels, we have nothing to identify with. In a film of this nature, there are no other characters in a majority of the film, so if we don't identify with Chris, we have nothing to help us enter the story, no one to take us on the journey.<br /><br />I liked Hirsch's performance. Hirsch is turning into a very strong actor. He and Justin Timberlake were the standouts in the underrated "Alpha Dog" and has appeared in a number of other little seen films and had roles in television shows. In "Into the Wild" Hirsch brings a maturity to the role hinting at some of the performances he will deliver, some of the roles in his future.<br /><br />There are three pit stops in his journey. He first meets Jan (Catherine Keener) and her partner Rainey (Brian Dierker), two hippies who live in a camper and like to set up stakes with a community of like minded individuals in the desert. They earn a few dollars here and there, mosey along the road, and meet new people. In their discussions, they talk about Jan's son, whom she hasn't seen for a long time. This is a nice compliment to Chris' journey. Jan's comments have to make Chris think about the effect he is having on his own parents. Keener, as always, does a great job with her relatively small role. Brian Dierker is also very good. He realizes the emotional troubles his partner has, and seems to love her all the more for them.<br /><br />Then Chris meets Wayne (Vince Vaughn). Wayne is a bit of a wild guy, and he has a business of his own, so he hires Chris. They get along and work well together and form a friendship. Throughout the film, we see a letter or two Chris writes to Wayne, the letters writing out on the screen in bright big letters (remember the comment about Penn's directing style earlier? Yet another example.) When we eventually meet Wayne and see the bond they form, these letters make sense.<br /><br />At the bar one night, as Chris is relating his reasons for making this journey, Wayne realizes Chris has a fire in his spirit, much like he does. But he also realizes Chris has to tame this fire, or it could lead to bad things. He provides some useful advice.<br /><br />Finally, Chris meets Ron (Hal Holbrook). Ron is an elderly man, who lives alone and offers to let Chris stay with him for a while. Ron and Chris form a friendship as well and when Chris is finally ready to move on, there is a touching moment when Chris and Ron have to say goodbye to one another.<br /><br />These three pit stops are meant to illustrate a different aspect of Chris' life or behavior.

I have been CHANGED!! Christopher McCandless is a GOD!!! He went into the Alaskan wilderness and came out a deity to be reckoned with! He made the decision to forego all personal wealth, in search of the ultimate answer! It's SOOOOO romantic, I want to cry. ALL of you folk who didn't like this film just didn't get it!! You are people incapable of dreaming the BIG dream!! This story is so inspirational, only those who understand Chris' journey toward enlightenment can truly call themselves devotees of His Divine Majesty!!<br /><br />His Family were worthless money-grubbers, His Mother was so out of touch with reality, and seeing his Father cry, at the end was so emotional (NOT). His "friends" just refused to accept that there are more important things than living on a slab of cement, out in the middle of nowhere, marking time, not caring that communing with the higher power is more important than life, itself!! And the old man? He just represented to Chris all that is wrong with humanity!! Leave all his worldly possessions to a man who has forsaken it? Was he nuts? Chris was above all that, the old coot was too stupid to see it!!<br /><br />When he reached Alaska, the vistas were beautiful!! It sure looked as though it was tough to be there, but Chris just KNEW what to do!! Yes, he made a mistake shooting that moose, but it was an honest one, and he can't be faulted for not knowing how to preserve the meat. He was just a displaced city kid, after all. His run-in with the bear had the hair on the back of my neck standing up!! It's a wonder he wasn't mauled or eaten. I guess the bear realized that Chris' journey wasn't over, yet!! I cried when he found out he ate those poisoned roots, but happy, too, because his story wouldn't have been so inspiring!! He died a HERO! No doubt about it!!<br /><br />You will have to forgive the one star rating. As of now, I would give this film 100 stars!! This is entertainment at it's finest!! Sean Penn captured the essence that was Christopher McCandless expertly, as an enlightened Director/Producer should!! I am ashamed to have thought that Christopher McCandless was anything but a GOD!!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A2WE94927YC3KI.html">A2WE94927YC3KI</a><br/><p>This movie isn't good because it was bored.

McCandless was able to form quick friendships which were more deep and sincere on the parts of the other people, his were rather more superficial at that point in time. He was filled with the angst and implacable censoriousness of youth and none of the appreciation for the fallibility of people, e.g., his own parents. Ostensibly it was the revelation that his father had continued relations with his first wife while married to his second and this sin, in McCandless's eyes, colored his entire life including his education, a career and any and all "things" that were in any way reminiscent of his parents. He nursed a cold rage against his father especially and used this revelation to justify his extreme callousness and carelessness toward his entire family including the sister he was so fond of and the abandoment of his car, a vehicle he supposedly treasured. He planned to inflict the ultimate hurt against his family by plotting his own disappearance and was so focused on this goal he lost sight of right and wrong and only considered his own wants which doomed him to die of starvation alone in the wilderness.<br />His arrogant, brash nickname "Alexander Supertramp" was another symptom of his hubris which ultimately seared his family with sorrow and drove him to a cold and lonely death in the old bus with no one around to comfort him in his last moments. He had fun playing the adventurer, for a while, then when he faced the reality of the situation he placed himself in, the fun and adventure vanished and he was left only with his very bad decisions. He went into a cold, forbidding environment virtually unprepared and without any supplies to speak of; tiny changes to his venture would have ensured his survival but it was not to be. Something as simple as slicing thin strips of the moose he killed and air drying them as opposed to smoking the meat and ending up with a maggot filled mess. Carrying beef jerky and dried fruit with him would have helped, pretty much any common care would have resulted in life instead of death and I do not believe for one second he intended or wanted to die. But he chose to ignore wise advice from people who had successfully gone into the wilderness and tried to give him the benefit of their own experiences...he even refused one man who offered to take him to buy adequate supplies. McCandless refused. It is a waste, it is not romantic at all, it is a tragedy and all the young men and women who find this event adventurous and exciting and worship McCandless and deify him are all sadly mistaken. The film was excellent and the music and actors all superb, but ultimately it describes a vengeful, angry, selfish, self centered young man who harbored a horrible grudge against his family and never even discussed this with them, but chose to plot to wreak revenge on them instead, which he did succeed at, his only success in this doomed adventure.</p></br><a href="../users/AD0J5KK4WQXNS.html">AD0J5KK4WQXNS</a><br/><p>This film is interesting enough to hold your attention throughout and although there are some magical moments there is an overwhelming amount of tragic ones. There are messages and life lessons but there is also much meaningless behind it as a young man opts out from the rat race to try and survive in the wild but usually returns to the streets or country as a homeless vagrant before trying once again to survive the roughest of places. Each time he goes out into the wild the ruthless conditions he chooses escalate. He hopes eventually to reach Alaska for the purest wild experience he can have.<br /><br />Ultimately the film is about the people that the boy meets on his journey and the advice they give him and the stories they have to tell. It is also about his parents and family back home that have lost him probably due to their own domestic issues and failure to communicate. It is more than a bit of a disturbing worldview.<br /><br />Into the Wild is worth watching and has an art-house indie feel but is quite a depressing one because its stars are mostly down and outs and lonely. Its message could well be get a job, have a family and enjoy your 9 to 5 as much as it is about trying to be original no matter what it takes. It's a strange one and in a few ways I wish maybe I could unwatch it. Maybe it helps us become more aware of the destitute problem and for that it can be commended, but at the same time you feel very uncomfortable watching the downward spiral of its main protagonist because it is a corkscrew into misery that he is choosing. The ending is shocking and horrific not because it is so graphic but because there is poetry in the distress.</p></br><a href="../users/A27H9DOUGY9FOS.html">A27H9DOUGY9FOS</a><br/><p>When I read Jon Krakauer's "Into the Wild" approximately ten years ago, I was mesmerized by the tragic real-life tale of Christopher McCandless. But as much as I loved the book, I never even thought about a film adaptation. Maybe that was shortsighted of me. Recounting McCandless's life and reconstructing it with minimal data and much introspection, "Into the Wild" succeeded as a cautionary adventure of idealism gone awry. Much of McCandless's life was lived alone and much of his story was pieced together though brief encounters or recovered writings. So what was a thoughtful portrait on the page never really seemed like it would translate to the screen--certainly not with the same impact. Luckily, though, Sean Penn thought otherwise. Adapting and directing Krakauer's fine book, Penn has fashioned a sad, funny and exciting film with tremendous emotional resonance.<br /><br />An affluent and likable young man, McCandless graduated with honors from Emory University and then set a course to redefine his life. Abandoning his family, friends, and material possessions--McCandless assumed the pseudonym of Alexander Supertramp and set off to explore the world in its most innocent form. Living off the land and experiencing nature, fellow travelers, and much adventure--McCandless was looking for a modern day utopia and sought to discover his real self as he cast away the corruptions of modern life. Touring the country for two years, McCandless's exploration was to culminate in an Alaskan sojourn--where he would commune with "the wild." His aspirations can be viewed as both admirable and delusional--but that is part of the complexity of McCandless's life. As much as you want him to succeed, you realize there can be no happy ending with the expectations he has in place.<br /><br />Penn's "Into the Wild," thus, depends on evoking a McCandless that you will care about--either because you commend his pursuit or because you want him to come to his senses. And it really works in combination. In a dynamic performance, Emile Hirsch transcends his previous work and becomes a full-fledged leading man. Hitting all the right notes, Hirsch creates a character who evokes our sympathy, our frustration, and even our laughter. McCandless meets a lot of companions on the road, and Hirsch makes it easy to see why he was so accepted. A great role--Hirsch meets all the emotional challenges and also makes a physical transformation that is a both startling and powerful. His great work is matched by a roster of big names including Vince Vaughn, William Hurt, Jena Malone, and Marcia Gay Hardin (among many others). But Catherine Keener and Hal Holbrook are real stand-outs--their adoptive relationships with Hirsch both challenge him and make him understand (eventually) that life is not meant to be lived alone.<br /><br />If there is any flaw in the film, it exists in the book as well. We can only know so much about McCandless from the resources available. He had a heightened sense of injustice particularly when it came to the "untruths" or perceived wrongs perpetuated by his family. Nothing presented, however, can explain how his relatively normal dysfunction blossomed into such an extreme world view. This secret is in McCandless's mind alone.<br /><br />"Into the Wild" works as a character study and a gritty drama, but also as an adventure. The scenery and photography are breathtaking and the action sequences are well executed. There is much genuine warmth and humor in the film as well. It was a fully satisfying film experience, to me, and has many quiet moments that have stayed with me. Highly recommended for serious adult audiences.

At first preachy and morose, there's a tipping point early in the picture where I couldn't help but feel something for McCandless and his naive quest to subsist wholly on morals, philosophy and the kindness of strangers in place of tangible food and water. Presented as a sort of messiah figure, the errant youth touches the lives of a broad range of individuals over the course of his travels, preaches the gospel of live-and-let-live and uncovers the difficulties associated with the tramp's lifestyle in a society so concerned with protecting its citizenry from themselves. There's a lot to be learned from Christopher's path, both positive and negative, and Penn shies away from neither in this careful, convincing pseudo-documentary. It can be so enveloping at times that the sudden appearance of a recognizable actor or two along the way feels awkward and strange. A very solid effort with something to say, I only wonder if it may have been better served by a full cast of unknowns. Eddie Vedder's perfectly matched original soundtrack deserves a special mention.</p></br><a href="../users/APBB297H3ZA5E.html">APBB297H3ZA5E</a><br/><p>1.

INTO THE WILD is an inspirational story about a young man that broke the chains of conventional thinking and walked his own path.  I was expecting a basic, feel-good story that can't escape a certain level of foolish sentimentality.  But this journey is much more complex.<br /><br />It's the true story of Christopher McCandless, AKA Alexander Supertramp, a young man who abandoned his life of luxury in order to quench his thirst for adventure.  He was a college grad from a wealthy family, but just had different plans than those that were laid out for him.<br /><br />He donated his $25,000 savings to the hungry and embarked on his quest of fufillment in the wilderness.  Becoming one with nature.  His journey had one ultimate goal--Alaska.  He was ill-prepared to survive the harsh elements, having just his rifle and a field guide for edible plants.  Sound a little crazy?<br /><br />Well yes, it very well might be.  But Chris was an educated man, plus he had quite an infectious personality.  People seemed to be drawn toward his free spirit, which was evident in his numerous encounters along the way.<br /><br />So I doubt he was totally naive to the dangers his brave quest entailed.  He was running towards something, but quite possibly away from something as well.<br /><br />Emile Hirsch does an absolutely amazing job in this role.

From Sean Penn's vision of how Christopher McCandless lives his life and searched for his goal, to Emile Hirsch's protrayal of the man's life, it's very compelling.<br /><br />As for the movie, Christopher (Hirsch) is a young man with the hubris of youth, the free-spirit of someone without responsibility, and the wherewithal of a privileged family.<br /><br />Because of a slightly dysfuncational family life, a strong disdain for much of what contemporary society has become - something with which I can strongly related, and the desire to find the aesthetic quality in every day life, Christopher leaves it all behind.  He eschews money (he actually sets fire to his last few remaining dollars), possession, and just about every other modern convenience in search of<br /><br />Along the way he changes his name to Alexander Supertramp in honor of not only the lifestyle but also his desire for anonymity.

It's just enough shelter for him to make it base-camp, where he can forage and hunt small game.  He spends the rest of the time reading, writing, and reflecting.<br /><br />The first major problem I have with this movie is the fact that he was so nice to so many, but had such an irrational hatred of his family.  I can understand his hesitancy to be close to his father, but he tortured his mother and sister out of pure ignorance and selfishness.<br /><br />The second problem I have with the movie is the message.  The majority of the film is a buildup, a message, an insight into his joy and freedom.  And then, in the end, the message changes.  Not only was his original concept foolhardy, but the lesson he learned was that he was completely wrong.  The essence of what he wanted to escape from was eventually the precise thing he craved.  It's easy to picture Alexander Supertramp as the free-wheeling, nature-loving, soul on a quest for enlightenment if he didn't end up looking like a utterly na?ve young man who lost his life unnecessarily.</p></br><a href="../users/A2E0EZ8DO5YSU3.html">A2E0EZ8DO5YSU3</a><br/><p>Beautifully photographed.

The young often go on 'seeking' quests, full of the normal human debates going on inside them, often urging them 'into the wild'. I believe that if Chris McCandless had lived through his Alaska adventure he would have come back with new wisdom that helped him grasp the fact that his parents were imperfect humans doing the same juggling act with struggles we all encounter in life in one form or another. I also believe he forgave them for their imperfections. It's heartbreaking to watch this movie, but I was so touched by it that I thank the family for allowing it to be told. It must have been very painful for them. Penn did an excellent job of adapting Krakauer's book by the same name.<br /><br />Chrissy K.

Though I think it could have been trimmed a little bit for length and pacing, I did find it to be a well made movie with some great work by Emile in his role as Christopher.  Emile is quite the young actor, in the roles I have seen him in he seems to be very chameleon like.  His characters are always very diverse and he really seems to get into his role.  This movie is no different.  By the movie's tragic end, he has gotten himself so skinny, it is uncomfortable to watch.  The Eddie Vedder soundtrack is great and perfect for this movie with the call of nature and hippie characters.  What you get out of the movie will come from how you perceive Christopher.  He is either a caring optimist with bad parents who wants to embrace the beauty of nature and reject the evils of civilization.  Or you may see him as an arrogant, spoiled rich kid who throws everything away for some unrealistic goal that he is unprepared for.  I thought it was a good movie based on a great book.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IOJE0W1NXOSE.html">A1IOJE0W1NXOSE</a><br/><p>Christopher McCandless, a recent Emory graduate and the son of wealthy parents, decides to give up his money, his identity, and his family and live on his own.  He travels across the country, and eludes the best efforts of his parents to locate him.  His sister, lonely without her best support in the family, narrates her feelings about him throughout the movie.  Chris considers his parents to be hypocritical liars and his journey is partly motivated by anger towards them and partly by his own adventuresome spirit.  Along the way he comes across kindly people who give him a job, a place to stay, or a listening ear.  One of those he comes across is an old man, played wonderfully by Hal Holbrook, who has given up on life and relationships.<br /><br />Chris's ultimate objective is to live in the wild in Alaska, and much of the film is devoted to his time there.  The scenery is beautiful, but the struggle is brutal.  This movie has many layers and will springboard many discussions among those who have see it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL.html">A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL</a><br/><p>Sean Penn, who has proven himself to be an accomplished and intense actor, takes the director helm just as seriously. His vision of Chris McCandless's life (via Jon Krakauer's book `Into the Wild') is simply stunning. While most pictures that go outdoors give you some breathtaking scenes, this film makes the close shots of formidable and forbidding nature a staple element throughout the movie. Having just watched the movie at a local cinema with a smaller screen, I was content, not needing a big screen TV or a visit to the I-Max. To sustain a story and an outdoor adventure for nearly two and a half hours is a feat unto itself, but the characters and reflections are satisfying enough to take the audience to its destination.<br /><br />Besides Penn's perfectionism, we have a fine story told well. Starting with Chris's real life journal, we go back and forth from his well-to-do family back to his destination on the outskirts of Fairbanks, and then trace back his journey along the way until he reached his destination. Chris had all the trappings of success. An "A" student with a wealthy family to help him along the way, something was, nevertheless, missing. To fill in the gaps, his sister (Jena Malone) narrates part of the story, telling us about the family he left behind. Then, he encounters all kinds of people from the working class farmers of South Dakota, to a latent hippie couple in Arizona, to a retired military man in California. Like road stories from films like `Easy Rider' <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000022TSY">Easy Rider</a> to books like Kerouac's `On the Road,' <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0140283293">On the Road (Penguin Great Books of the 20th Century)</a>this is a high caliber road movie, even if the destination is off the beaten path. With all its grandeur and absorbing development, this movie reminded me of the truly excellent 'Never Cry Wolf,' <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000069HYH">Never Cry Wolf (Full Screen Edition)</a>which this film has easily trumped.<br /><br />Trouble is Chris's problems don't resolve themselves with nature. In his journal, he expresses his thoughts well and quotes the works of Thoreau, Tolstoy, and Pasternak who help him share his vision of happiness that can't be bought. Nature can be quite unforgiving, but the wisdom Chris picks up along the way make his uncompromising attempt to live life on his own terms both laudably courageous and a cautionary tale told to the rest of us.<br /><br />All of the performances are as true to life as the footage. Including William Hurt who gives us another laudable performance as Chris's driven father, Walt, a successful space engineer. Emile Hirsch captures all the spirit and naivete' of Chris, and Marcia Gay Harden is perfect as the worried, doting mom. But the real master is Penn who is able to share Chris's vision. Meaningful, poetic, colorful, eventful, and magnificent in grandeur, `Into the Wild' is simply a cinematic Odyssey taken by a careful hand who wanted to make both the man and his journey unforgettable.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PBV1899CX3TE.html">A2PBV1899CX3TE</a><br/><p>Into the Wild has been in my friend's DVD player for about a month. She has been watching it constantly. I finally got a chance to see for myself, and found it to be a fascinating and compelling story, based on a real person, who may have been tilting at windmills like Don Quixote in his quest for freedom and survival in the extremes of wild nature, but nevertheless, touched the lives of all he encountered along the way.<br /><br />Chris McCandless (Emile Hirsch) has just graduated from college, with excellent grades, but instead of either graduate school or a career, he chooses instead to go into the wild. He donates his trust fund to charity, burns his money, and abandons his car. He renames himself Alexander Supertramp, and begins his quest to live up to his new name. His parents, Walt and Billie McCandless (Marcia Gay Harden and William Hurt) are bewildered and hire an investigator to find him, but to no avail. His sister Carine, who also serves as an additional narrator, is hurt that he doesn't call her, either. But she offers insight into what may have driven him off, comparing him to fine crystal that nevertheless is fragile and needs protection.<br /><br />Along the way he meets hippies Rainey & Jan Burres (Brian Dierker and Catherine Keener). Later, he works on a farm for Wayne Westerberg (Vince Vaughn). He also befriends lonely leather engraver Ron Franz (Hal Holbrook). He kayaks all the way to Mexico and back, rides the rails, visits Slab City in the desert, works in a fast food restaurant, always working towards his goal of surviving a harsh winter in the wilds of Alaska. He reaches Alaska and makes his final stand in an abandoned bus...<br /><br />Into the Wild was directed by Sean Penn. Great job, Sean. He waited 10 years to make the film, making sure that he had the approval and support of the McCandless family. Everything was filmed on location, and Sean Penn takes full advantage with excellent cinematography. Some of the cast were the actual people from the real life story, such as Jim Gallien, who gives the wanderer boots as he goes into the wild. Brian Deirker was originally hired as a technical consultant for the river rafting, but at Emile Hirsch's suggestion, cast in the role of hippie motorhomer Rainey.<br /><br />It features music composed and performed by Eddie Vedder. When Sean Penn called and asked him to do it, he agreed on the spot. I am not a fan of Pearl Jam, mainly because of Vedder's voice, which sounds phoney and cartoonish. But he has really matured, and there is just a touch of the cartoonishness in his voice to give it a bit of character and identity. The music is excellent, great acoustic guitar and the singing surprisingly good, it really adds to the film experience. Vedder does the bulk of the music, but there are also a few songs by Kaki King, some others, and of course we get to hear Roger Miller's "King of the Road," which is paraphrased and quoted in the final manifesto.<br /><br />Besides the music, there are also quotes from literature on title cards between scenes, such as:<br /><br />There is a pleasure in the pathless woods<br />(from Childe Harold, Canto iv, Verse 178)<br /><br />There is a pleasure in the pathless woods,<br />There is a rapture on the lonely shore,<br />There is society, where none intrudes,<br />By the deep sea, and music in its roar:<br />I love not man the less, but Nature more,<br /><br />  -- Lord Byron, (George Gordon)<br /><br />The cast was all really good, with the well known actors and unknowns alike seeming totally authentic. I especially liked Vince Vaughn as someone who both mocks and admires the young man's ambitions. "Can't be juggling blood and fire all the time!"<br /><br />Also there is a great encounter with Ron Franz (Hal Holbrook). The lonely old man looks askance at Supertramp's vagabond lifestyle, but considers his challenge to get out of his workshop and see the world. The encounter offers director Sean Penn a great chance for his protagonist to illustrate his saga by carving his story onto a leather belt:<br /><br />Ron Franz: What does the "N" stand for?<br />Christopher McCandless: North.<br />Ron Franz: [sounding surprised and frustrated] Alaska?<br /><br />Once he reaches Alaska, he continues carving out his story on a board he finds in the 'Magic Bus.'<br /><br />Christopher McCandless: Two years he walks the earth. No phone, no pool, no pets, no cigarettes. Ultimate freedom. An extremist. An aesthetic voyager whose home is the road. Escaped from Atlanta. Thou shalt not return, 'cause "the West is the best." And now after two rambling years comes the final and greatest adventure. The climactic battle to kill the false being within and victoriously conclude the spiritual pilgrimage. Ten days and nights of freight trains and hitchhiking bring him to the Great White North. No longer to be poisoned by civilization he flees, and walks alone upon the land to become lost in the wild. - Alexander Supertramp May 1992<br /><br />10 movies that pertain to Into the Wild<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NO39FG">Alpha Dog (Widescreen Edition)</a> (2006) ....

Even as I sit here typing this review, I am moved by the closing five minutes and the story that led up to it.<br /><br />Despite a few shots of full body nudity and a few scenes of foul-mouthed discourse, I found 'Into the Wild' to be almost a holy experience, as if God was somehow accentuating the risk of wanderlust, as well as its difficulty acquired reward, while at the same time showing us that true living consists of the relationships we forge. That's the feeling I came away with, and this feeling can be attributed to Mr. Sean Penn, the director of the film.<br /><br />Penn brings to life the tragic tale of Christopher McCandless in a way that I doubt even the best in Hollywood could manage. He takes Krakauer's book and molds a film that somehow waves its petite hands at Hollywood's big brother blockbusters and defeats them with ease. My God, what a wonderful film, and a soundtrack that beautifully augments the film! Penn captures both the beauty of McCandless' trek across America and the sad, horrifying realization he comes to in his final moments.<br /><br />Perhaps more importantly than anything else, Penn pushes the human relationship to the forefront and defines love by an ability to forgive those around us. This point is stressed by McCandless himself as he realizes the lesson in his desperate and lonely final days.<br /><br />Seize the chance to watch an Oscar winner before the legions of Saw fans realize it even exists. If you do, you will witnessed one of the great films of our generation, and perhaps one of its greatest, most tragic and profound stories.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TPW86OHXTXFC.html">A1TPW86OHXTXFC</a><br/><p>"Wise Men in Their Bad Hours":<br />Death's a fierce meadowlark: but to die having made<br />Something more equal to centuries<br />Than muscle and bone, is mostly to shed weakness.<br />The mountains are dead stone, the people<br />Admire or hate their stature, their insolent quietness,<br />The mountains are not softened or troubled<br />And a few dead men's thoughts have the same temper<br />"I HAVE HAD A HAPPY LIFE AND THANK THE LORD. GOODBYE AND MAY GOD BLESS ALL!" Found written in Alexander Supertramp's Notebook.<br /><br />Sean Penn has directed a magnificent film. Every image tells a story- the sea, the cities, the wheat fields, the rivers, the glorious mountains, the trains, and the young man himself who experiences these vistas. Christoper or Alexander Supertramp as he calls himself is seemingly running toward something. Sure he is running from his abusive family, but it seems to me he is searching for the purity of life, and he found it. Peter Travers of 'Rolling Stone' says "If, like Penn, you mourn Chris's tragedy and his judgment errors but also exult in his journey and its spirit of moral inquiry, then this beautiful, wrenching film will take a piece out of you. "  And, this film will remain with me for a long long time.<br /><br />The people that Supertramp meets along the way, are part of him and his story. They all bring a little piece of knowledge and love into his life. And every person he meets falls in love with him. He leaves them while he can.  This is a physical film, lots of hard work and labor just to survive.  An odyssey to a deliverance.  Emile Hirsch, as Christopher McCandless is extraordinary. A young man who portrays a physical and emotional loneliness.  Hal Holbrook as a retired military man gives the performance of his life- the tears he sheds as Christopher walks away are the tears we all shed.<br /><br />Christopher loved literature and he was influenced by Leo Tolstoy, Henry David Thoreau, and Jack London.  Their philosophies are written throughout his notebook. He is always reading throughout this film, and at one point he cannot carry the books any longer and buries them encased in plastic beneath a highway overpass.<br /><br />Eddie Vedder's voice is portrayed in song throughout the movie and it seems at times as Peter Travers states" Eddie Vedder's remarkable songs, notably a cover of "Hard Sun," sound like the voice of Chris' unconscious."  Chris and a young hippie woman he meets sing 'Angel of Montgomery' which may be one of the most poignant memories and sounds of the film.<br /><br />'Make me an angel<br />Just give me one thing<br />That I can hold on to<br />To believe in this livin<br />Is just a hard way to go'<br /><br />Christopher finds his way to Alaska and after four months he slowly dies of starvation. We are with him, in his bus and we experience the glories that he feels and the visions he sees. Through our tears we celebrate with him.<br /><br />"Which is not to say that there is anything easy or naive in what Mr. Penn has done. "Into the Wild" is, on the contrary, alive to the mysteries and difficulties of experience in a way that very few recent American movies have been. There are some awkward moments and infelicitous touches -- a few too many Eddie Vedder songs on the soundtrack, for -- but the film's imperfection, like its grandeur, arises from a passionate, generous impulse that is as hard to resist as the call of the open road."

He reaches a turning point in his historical approach of life. He depicts what 1968ers and hippies have become thirty years later, today, and what their idealism and ideals may produce today. Christopher, an allusion to a certain Christopher Columbus, decides to abandon everything, to give away his 24,000 dollars of savings, to burn his money and disappear in the vast territory known as the USA. He is looking for real life, for real nature, for real humanity, a life, a nature, a reality that are no longer simulacra of the truth, the truth that existed before man and humanity perverted it. So, along the road, he explores several possibilities that are all fake and he will end in Alaska. Sean Penn accumulates the elements showing there is no escape from society and civilization. No escape for the hippie couple Christopher becomes friendly to and who move freely thanks to their caravan, making an income along the way by selling second hand books they recuperate left and right. No escape from social norms in sex when Christopher refuses the approach and gift from a girl on the only basis that she is 16. Woodstock is really gone and forgotten. No escape in the friendship he develops with a farmer of some type who is finally caught up by the FBI for some illegal activity. No escape in the friendship he develops with an older retired GI who proposes to adopt him to provide him with some kind of a family, to provide himself with some kind of a substitute for his accidentally killed son. But no escape either in Alaska where he is trapped in a way three times, at least. Trapped in a bus that is grounded in the middle of the wilderness. Too easy to survive in this absolutely human environment whose engine is dead and has no fuel. Trapped by his forgetting that to survive in nature you have to know nature's cycle and he did not know the migration cycles of animals and found himself one day foodless, and he did not know the cycles of the rivers and found himself locked up by the water of the river and crossed on foot before. Trapped finally by his lack of knowledge about nature and by his lack of preparation that makes him mix up two wild plants, one edible and one inedible. And he dies slowly poisoned by wild sweet peas. And finally, but too late, he understands that happiness is only real when it is shared. But it is too late and he can only compensate his death with the beauty of the sky his dying eyes capture as he breathes out his very last breath of life. Complete, absolute, irreversible evolution of humanity from barbaric animality to necessarily social and shared civilization. To refuse that historical construct is to refuse to live and to condemn oneself to death, in other words to commit suicide.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines</p></br><a href="../users/A1GHUN5HXMHZ89.html">A1GHUN5HXMHZ89</a><br/><p>Although compelling and beautifully captured, I found it meandered a bit. The young mans journey from family shelter to wilderness starvation is brave but misguided. I especially like the scenes on the river. However; a tighter edited version bringing it in around two hours would have been better received. The story of a man throwing away his parents values and striking out on his own is not new. The method used to show us that journey was unique. Good acting and great scenery make this worth a rental. We have all stumbled during our years after High School or even after College, but few cast common sense to the wind. McCandles does, so although we sympathize with his convictions, we cannot applaud his lack of logic.<br /><br />In college I too went camping to get away from it all and I even jumped off a seventy-five foot clift into water with rocks everywhere. Do you truly think if I had hit one of those rocks they would think it was a great story to make a movie about? Doubtful but even I was an experienced diver and so although not brilliant, at least I knew what I was doing. Just as I went camping with my father and anyone else with experience before going into the wild on my own. So although the movie has good acting, great camera work, and excellent directing, that doesn't make me like the story. Afterall lots of hippies did this during the 1960s and I don't see books or movies about most of them. I guess because thats old stuff and Sean Penn didn't direct a movie about it. I might have been more inclined to recommend purchasing it if it was shorter and had a positive message. Think about what it says to most teens. Good quality DVD with fair replayability.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GPEV42IO41CI.html">A2GPEV42IO41CI</a><br/><p>When Chris McCandless (Emile Hirsch) graduated from college, he had one goal in life - to finally break away from his unhappy family and the constraints of society in general and live off the land in Alaska.  The  film flashes back and forth between Chris' adventure in Alaska and the months leading up to it, focusing on the people who befriended him, including an aging hippie couple and a lonely, old man (well-played by the venerable Hal Holbrook).<br /><br />Based on a true story and narrated with many of Chris' journal entries, the film is an emotional roller coaster; I was torn between admiring his youthful idealism and courage and hating him for the pain he inflicted on his family.  The movie feels much like a documentary as it follows Chris hitchhiking and working his way across the country and then surviving, at first quite well, in Alaska.<br /><br />Emile Hirsch is well-cast as Chris and makes you care about him right from the start.  He did all of his demanding stunts himself and even lost 40 pounds to play the ailing Chris.  It is a very touching story.  Surrounded by the splendor of the wilderness but ultimately alone, Chris finally understood that happiness is only real when it is shared.  Highly recommended.</p></br></body></html>

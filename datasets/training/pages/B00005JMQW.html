I was looking forward to that movie so much and I was let down SOOOO much by the sloppy construction, poor visuals, ridiculous scripting and overall messy structure.  The reason I was looking forward to it was because, as many have already stated (critics alike), `Spider-Man 2' is probably the best superhero movie EVER!<br /><br />Plot holes or not, I still slightly prefer `The Dark Knight' (I love my superheroes to have a little grit on them).<br /><br />Where `Spider-Man' was a nicely constructed origin story, `Spider-Man 2' becomes a brilliantly orchestrated expansion on that origin, complete with a profound moral structure that elevates the film from a mere `comic book movie'.  With a solid script that really gets to the heart of the characters and makes them real and relatable, `Spider-Man 2' is an outstanding film, no matter what genre you place it in.  It has layer upon layer of interesting and memorable development.<br /><br />The film is, in a word, very complex (but that is a good thing).<br /><br />Picking up where the first film left off, Peter Parker is struggling to accept who he has become.  He still suffers from guilt, but he has masked that guilt with a newfound responsibility.  That responsibility is making it very difficult for Peter to strike a needed balance between his personal life and that of being Spider-Man.  This is making his budding romance with Mary Jane Watson more aggravating than it should be.  His past actions (involving a certain flying villain) have posed a threat to Peter's relationship with his best friend Harry, who has vowed to avenge his father's death.  When you add to that a brilliant man controlled by his own genius (a marvelous Alfred Molina), you have a recipe for some exciting and provoking entertainment.<br /><br />And that is JUST what `Spider-Man 2' proves to be.<br /><br />Sam Raimi is at his very best here.  What I admire so much about this film is that, while Raimi definitely `goes there' in the visual department, he never goes so far that the film appears fake.  That was one of my biggest issues with that Spider-Mess of a third film.  Everything was SOOOO computer animated that it came off like a really bad video game.  Not so here.  Sure, there is a lot going on, but everything maintains a crisp, slickness to it that establishes a sense of realism.  Yes, I know that it is improbable that a tentacle clad man is ever going to scale buildings and wreck havoc in the streets, but Raimi made me wholly believe that it is not impossible.  His attention to detail here is impeccable.  I love the way that Raimi captured what it felt like to read a Spider-Man comic book as a boy.  The film has this light and airy (colorful) feel to it, yet it is laced with that suspense that only comes from truly engrossing yourself in this character and his purpose.<br /><br />Bravo.<br /><br />And yet still, the most impressive facet of `Spider-Man 2' is the fact that it has a real heart.  It is less the story of a superhero and more the story of a complex and conflicted young man, trying desperately to juggle his life in a way that makes the most sense; paying his dues where they belong while still developing a life that will satisfy and complete him.<br /><br />We are all Peter Parker, minus the superpowers.<br /><br />I still firmly believe that Toby Maguire was BORN to play this part, and it is still the only role I've ever really believed him in.  He is not my favorite actor, but this is one of my favorite characters, and my heart is welled up in this man because of what Maguire does here.<br /><br />So, best superhero movie of all time?</p></br><a href="../users/A2II09GQGWOMTQ.html">A2II09GQGWOMTQ</a><br/><p>I liked the first one but this one surpasses it on EVERY level.<br />Spidey 2 has a better villain, better FX, better everything.<br />The story is more engaging; the whole wedding scene at the end with Mary Jane running through the park is just soooo cool.<br />The action is nonstop.<br />A brilliant story, a brilliant movie.<br />Loved it!<br />Loved it!!<br />Loved it!!!<br />Superb acting from the entire cast, one of the best if not THE best super hero movie ever.<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!!!</p></br><a href="../users/AZCDCO6KK2T81.html">AZCDCO6KK2T81</a><br/><p>I love to be proven both right and wrong at the same time.  I was a bit underwhelmed with the original film although it was pleasing enough and I was happy to see my all-time favorite comic-book icon swing onto the silver screen, but I did predict that this series of films could improve with time as the core elements were all there, but I never ever thought they would produce such a fantastic film as this one.  The original cast, which was great, returns bringing more depth to their roles.  Tobey was great as Peter Parker, but his voice-over Spider-Man had a lot to be desired.  His sense of comic-timing, a Spidey trademark, was way off and unconvincing as was the CGI Spider-Man.  Those issues have been put to rest.<br /><br />Maguire IS Parker/Spider-Man!  The CGI effects are enormously improved upon and now very believable.  The show-stopping scene of the runaway train is nothing less than jaw-dropping.  To beef up the believability factor we get numerous scenes of a real stuntman and Spidey without his mask on which allows us to feel more for Maguire as a character and hero.<br /><br />The problems with the over-top-acting of Willem Defoe as the Green Goblin villain is brushed aside with this new villain that is marvelously played by Alfred Molina.  We honestly like this guy when we meet him and feel great empathy for his disasterous turn.  The effects involving his character are perhaps the best ever created for a comic-book transfer to film villain.  You just can't believe your eyes.  It's astounding.<br /><br />I do not know how they will top this one, but this is arguably the very best comic-book to film ever made.  It does everything a film should do and then some.  It does everything a sequel is supposed to which is continue the storyline in a believable manner.  Again, it does that and then some.  It leaves the audience wanting more and that is the highest compliment any audience or reviewer can say about a film.  BRAVO!!!!!!</p></br><a href="../users/AIFXFHO2N9WJB.html">AIFXFHO2N9WJB</a><br/><p>With the blockbuster success that accompanied "Spiderman", Sony Pictures wasted no time in getting Sam Raimi back behind the camera for the sequel.  With the majority of the original film's cast being signed for 3 movies (according to their contracts), odds were looking good that "Spiderman 2" could possibly surpass the original film, in terms of box office success, story, and quality.  Well, the results did not disappoint, "Spiderman 2" was a sensational success with audiences, critics, and the box office.<br /><br />"Spiderman 2" picks up sometime after the events of "Spiderman", as Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is trying to make his way through college, hold down a pizza delivery job, shoot photos for the Daily Bugle, visit his Aunt May and Mary Jane, all this while still being the hero Spiderman.  Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) is now a Broadway star, and drops a `bombshell' on Peter, by announcing she is going to be married and that it's too late for Peter and her.  Peter's best friend Harry Osborn (James Franco), continues to blame Spiderman for the death of his father Norman, which is beginning to cause a rift in his friendship with Peter, due to Peter's constantly shooting pictures of the wall-crawler.  Friendship troubles aside Harry invites Peter to meet Dr. Otto Octavius, a scientist that has made revolutionary breakthroughs in the field of robotics for Oscorp.  When a mishap occurs during an experiment, even though Spiderman tried to stop the accident from occurring, Octavius' wife was killed and the semi-sentient robotic arms that Octavius had created were fused into his body.  The semi-sentient robotic arms are now slowly taking control of Octavius' mind causing him to go insane and lash out at those who have wronged him.  Now as the evil Dr. Octopus, his main focus is eliminating the one man he believes to be responsible for his current condition and his wife's death, Spiderman.<br /><br />The storytelling and the acting were so incredible and even more mature than expected, that the original film almost pales in comparison, and the original film was great.  "Spiderman 2" sets the bar even higher in terms of quality and craftsmanship, for future installments in this franchise, and other comic book movies in general.  This sequel is a definite must see for comic book fans and movie audiences in general, it contains a little something for everyone, from romance, to action, to comedy, "Spiderman 2" will not disappoint.  Highly recommended!<br /><br />"Spiderman 2" is rated PG-13 for violence and language.</p></br><a href="../users/AD0J5KK4WQXNS.html">AD0J5KK4WQXNS</a><br/><p>Spider-Man 2 is better than most other superhero movies you have seen, not because the comic and hero makers are still alive to help carry Hollywood through those taxing story hurdles, but because director Sam Raimi is at the helm, period. If Spider-Man 2 suffers from anything, then obviously it is a restricted budget (seen in the budget CGI effects of the first outing) because Raimi was a relatively unknown director with only a big list of unknown films (Evil Dead movies) behind him. If anything blame the studios for throwing an extra 30 million in the direction of 10 Direct to DVD moves you never watched last year.<br /><br />Spider-Man 2 takes off from where the first one almost left off, Mary Jane is still the love Peter Parker can not have, the new Green Goblin/ Hobgoblin is in the making, Aunt May copes with the loose of her husband and we learn some new things about her life and where it is going, Dr. Octavius is in town for a science class and more of The Daily Bugle means Spider-Man 2 is almost like watching a re-run of the first, with the side story that when Parker becomes depressed he looses he powers. Thus when the bad guys start winning more, Parker starts to loose his powers more. It is a very good new character development in Spider-Man's abilities to fight crime.<br /><br />I quite like the character of Dr. Octopus. What Raimi does with his character towards the end is very interesting. Most Superhero movies are about bad vs good. Here Raimi does fallen good guys vs mutant good guys. The CGI effects in this opus are a notch up or two from the last one. It is just such a shame that Spider-Man is not getting the credit that the studio should have given it from the start.</p></br><a href="../users/A1655SGPPUUCRP.html">A1655SGPPUUCRP</a><br/><p>Just when I was beginning to consider boycotting the endless stream of painfully bad sequels pouring out of Hollywood ("The Matrix Reloaded", "The Matrix Revolutions", "Shrek 2", "Alien vs. Predator", "Princess Diaries 2", "Ocean's 12", "Scooby Doo 2", "Barbershop 2"), in swoops "Spider-Man 2," the latest comic-book-turned-smash-hit-film-franchise featuring the everyman's superhero, Peter Parker/Spider Man, played perfectly by the versatile Tobey Maguire.  And guess what, "Spider-Man 2" is even better than the first one!<br /><br />Picking up where the smash-hit "Spider-Man" left off, audiences are treated to a truly pulse-pounding, involving story complete with a few tear-jerking moments, breathtaking special effects, solid acting by a solid cast including Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, and Alfred Molina, and astonishing action that doesn't compromise the quality of the film ala "The Matrix" sequels.<br /><br />This is an intelligent, touching, and wonderfully-paced film that really threw me for a loop as I realized just how powerful a movie based on a comic book series could be!  I loved the way director Sam Raimi takes the trademark quote from the original, "With great power comes great responsibility" and weaves it in as the very soul of this film.  With such a powerful core, "Spider-Man 2" focuses on all the right aspects of the young Spider-Man, connecting him beautifully to the audience and really drawing us into his psyche.  This is what separates "Spider-Man 2" from most action films out there right now.<br /><br />"Spider-Man 2" won't just awe and excite you; it will take your heart as well.</p></br><a href="../users/AIRHRV3D8X4J1.html">AIRHRV3D8X4J1</a><br/><p>Spider-Man 2 sure lives up to the expectations set up by the first. This movie has some great action that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Very few sequels can live up to the original, but Spider-Man 2 sure does. I can't really say much more than what has all ready been said about this awesome film. I have to say this Superbit edition is truly breathtaking with the vibrant picture detail and amazing sound. The regular Spider-Man 2 edition is clear but the superbit edition is much clearer and much more detail is seen. Another great thing about the Superbit edition is the choice of sound options. You get the DTS soundtrack (dts only available on superbit edition) which brings the film to life far more than just the Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack. You have to be a true die hard fan to really appreciate this superbit edition. If you want to experience Spider-Man 2 with the best picture and sound get the superbit edition because it blows the regular edition away. The only downside to this superbit edition is you get no bonus features, but the clarity and sound more than make up for that.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDNTB7377YH2.html">A1CDNTB7377YH2</a><br/><p>Spiderman is back in one of the best sequels since The Lord of the Rings trilogy.  This time Peter Parker is trying to juggle keeping a job, maintaining a run-down apartment, keeping his grades up, while continuing his Spidey exploits.<br /><br />Peter starts regretting his life as Spiderman because it interferes with all other parts of his life, especially his hidden love for Mary Jane Watson.  This starts to affect his powers.  Sometimes his webs fail to fire and his vision starts to go back to what it was before he was bitten by an enhanced arachnid.  Peter must make a decision whether or not he wants to give up being Spidey and try to better his Peter life or stick to the credo he learned from his dying Uncle Ben (with great power comes great responsibility).<br /><br />Meanwhile his friend Harry (who is obsessed with killing Spiderman) is now one of the heads of Oscorp and is funding a scientist who has a new way to generate atomic energy.  Dr. Octavius has a way to create and harness a tiny sun.  This is through the use of robotic metal arms that are attached to his body and controlled through a computer chip that feeds impulses to his brain.  Something goes wrong with the experiment and the chip gets destroyed.  Out of control, the arms take control of Octavius's mind, turning him into the evil Dr. Octopus.<br /><br />The special effects outdo the original and Alfred Molina is likeable as the unfortunate Dr. Octopus (unlike the annoying and pompous villain portrayed by Willem Defoe in the first film).  The movie overdoes the comedy somewhat.  There is a take-off from Midnight Cowboy (done to the tune of Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head) and J. Jonah Jameson is one joke after another.  However, the ending is great!  The movie also sets up for the possibility of at least two villains in the next film (Harry Osborne and The Lizard, who was Dr. Curt Connor in the comic).  I have also heard the rumor that Venom is a possibility in the next film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EEUQ81DTY7G3.html">A2EEUQ81DTY7G3</a><br/><p>Spider-Man 2, picking up where the first movie left off is made with most of the same cast, and by most of the same team as Spider-Man under the direction of Sam Raimi. This movie. However, proves to be even better than its predecessor. Two years on, Mary Jane, played by the lovely Kirsten Dunst, has gotten on with her acting career, and is dating an astronaut. But she is still pining for the man that she wants Peter Parker to be. Peter, played with an fresh-faced ease by Tobey Maguire, is having a terrible time - having been fired twice from a pizza-delivery service, and at the Daily Bugle for not taking enough photos of Spider-Man. He's also in trouble from his college professor for being lazy and for not doing his homework. <p>Meanwhile, Aunt May, played with a delectable veracity by the wonderful Rosemary Harris, is being thrown out of her apartment, and poor Peter thinks he caused it all, including the strain on his friendship with young Harry Osborn who holds Spider-Man responsible for the death of his father. When Peter visits Alfred Molina's devilish Dr. Otto Octavius a scientist who is researching fusion, he witnesses one his experiments running out of control. Changing into Spiderman, Peter witnesses Dr. Octavius turn into a raving monster, complete with robotic malevolent tentacles. Spurned on by the unfortunate death of his wife, Octavius tries to wreak havoc on the whole of Manhattan.<p>Spider-Man 2 has all manner of fancy CGI improvements on its precursor, but in the end it's the old-style action sequences that carry it, along with the continued development of the characters. The movie is also gorgeous to look at - the colours are vibrant and rich, and Manhattan looks just beautiful. The film also has a strong sense of pacing, with the quieter moments of repose between MJ and Peter juxtaposed well with frantic rapidity of the action. There are some great effect scenes, particularly when Aunt May swats Octavius with her umbrella as he scrambles up the side of a building. There's also a climactic scene involving an elevated train where Spider man tries to stop it from crashing into the East River.  <p>Kirsten Dunst brings a quiet, feline beauty to the role and there's no doubt that she's a remarkably adventurous young actress who is going to go a long way in Hollywood.  Dunst invests the lovely M.J. with a sturdy willfulness that leaves us confident she can take perfectly good care of herself. And then there's the wonderful Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker/Spiderman, who imbues the character with a sense of honestly and freshness that is impossible not to like. Spiderman 2 is one of the best actions films of the year so far, and probably one of the greatest superhero films of all time.

I realize that some people would read that as sarcasm but truthfully, I'm being sincere.  This one is without a doubt the best movie of 2004.<br /><br />On the heels of the first Spiderman movie (a mere two years ago) we find Peter Parker graduated from High School and being put upon by life in general.  Fired from his carpy day job, beset by a grating landlord for the overdue rent on his rinky-dink apartment, missing and failing college classes, lack of love life staring him in the face every time he sees the billboard plastered with his ex-girlfriend's face...we all know guys like this.  Heck, we could all be this guy from time to time.  Even worse, his alter ego as Spiderman is being publicly slandered in the newspaper by his own boss.  Here is one average joe superhero who is taking a massive ego beating.  You're not alone, Charlie Brown.<br /><br />Hold on action fans, Spiderman 2 is no downer!  There's a good balance between the sympathetic backstory and the energy that lured us into the theaters.  Spidey gets plenty of fight play from Doc Octopus, the new supervillain on the block.  There is a great deal of incredible web-swinging as well, better than in the first film; you really get the sense of fun from the spider's-eye view.  I dare say the animators have finally perfected their art here.<br /><br />Now a word of caution to parents.  Like me, you may have assumed that since S1 was fairly low on the violence meter that S2 would be similar.  Regrettably, I think the violence level of S2 was jacked up a bit too high for a movie that appeals so widely to children.  There are just a few too many scenes of actual humans being graphically savaged by Doc Oc for my comfort as the parent of a 6-year-old Spidey fan.  If I had realized that I wouldn't have let him see it until we could buy it on dvd and selectively fast forward through the intense parts.<br /><br />On the whole though, I loved this movie.  I saw a hero that was made more heroic for the fact that he was a very real person with problems who chose to sacrifice his own interests and go fight the good fight anyway.  That's what made this a standout in the genre of comic superhero flicks, the real heroism of the human spirit embodied by Peter Parker.  The cool costume is just a nice bonus (by the way, my eternal thanks to Stan Lee for giving us a superhero without that annoying cape).<br /><br />Go see this on the big screen while you have a chance to enjoy the maximum effect, then buy this for your kids on dvd later.  It's really worth it.<br /><br />-Andrea, aka Merribelle</p></br><a href="../users/A19VMQDCB4HZ9P.html">A19VMQDCB4HZ9P</a><br/><p>I enjoyed the first film and just like X2 I thoroughly enjoyed this sequel even more. The effects were much improved from the first film. It seems that John Dykstra and crew have fine-tuned the CGI Spider-Man not to look too cartoony.<br /><br /> Maguire's seem to have grown into the role of Peter Parker and looks more comfortable in all his scenes. The rest of the cast were more than adequate enough in the roles they had to play. The stand-outs other than Maguire have to be Alfred Molina's Dr. Otto Octavius. Molina's humanizing take on Doc Ock raises the character from just your ordinary power-mad supervillain into a tragic figure driven mad by circumstances beyond his control. Unlike Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin, Molina doesn't chew up the scenery but instead takes a more understated approach in portraying Spidey's nemesis. Kudos must also go to J.K. Simmons as Jonah Jameson. His scenes were some of the funniest in the film and accurately brings to life the character from the comics. Some of his lines are straight from the comics themselves.<br /><br /> As some may have mentioned the script and some of the dialogue can be weak and corny. I have to admit that they are at that, but the script overall wasn't as bad as some may have pointed out. The overall tone of the film and its script has the feel of a comic book. This is a comic book film and as such I went into it thinking of it as one. Some of the dialogue are bad and to be honest the dialogue in the comic itself can be bad. But the effect some of the corny dialogue had on me wasn't enough for me to thoroughly enjoy the whole film. Alvin Sargent's (two-time Oscar winning screenwriter) may have had his hands full trying to convey the feel of the Spider-Man comics in 2 hours. I think Michael Chabon's (Pulitzer-prize winning author of The Adventures of Kavalier and Clay: a novel about comic books)help in doctoring the script may have helped save the enitre tone of the film from becoming too corny. I hope they hire him to write the third film instead of just helping on it.<br /><br /> One thing, I like to point out is the effects used for Dock Ock's mechanical tentacles. As I watched the film the first time then a second time a few days later, I still couldn't tell when the CGI tentacles and the animatronic tentacles were on-screen. The effects work on Ock's helpers has to be some of the best FX work I have seen. The tentacles themselves seem to have individual personalities as they came to life.<br /><br /> And for all Evil Dead fans, Raimi was generous enough to bring in Bruce &quot;He is God&quot; Campbell to make a cameo in one of the funnier scenes in the film. Raimi also brings abit of a Evil Dead vibe to the hospital scene w/ Octavius pre-Dock Ock.<br /><br /> For a summer blockbuster and comic book superhero film, I recommend this film. It's not Citizen Kane and when taken for the whole of its parts Spider-Man 2 succeeds and entertains.</p></br><a href="../users/AZSN1TO0JI87B.html">AZSN1TO0JI87B</a><br/><p>I knew it was going to be good, but I had no idea it was going to be THIS good. "Spider-Man 2" is everything a sequel of it's caliber should add up too: better special effects, breath-taking action sequences and a deeper story-line. "Spider-Man 2" succeeds at respecting and building off of the story established in the first movie. Two years later, and Peter Parker is struggling to keep his head above water. His obligations to his alter-ego, Spider-Man, keep him from holding a steady job, making ends meet, keeping in touch with family and friends, and most importantly: being with the love of his life, Mary Jane Watson. As Peter starts to doubt himself, his abilities start waning away, and he finds himself conflicted and forced to make the choice of saving the world, or living a happy life. To make matters worse, a new super-villian is on a the loose by the name of Dr. Octopus, a respected scientist controlled by his own invention. The stakes in this movie are raised really high and the result is a more powerful and gripping film than the first one. So, yes, "Spider-Man 2" is better than the original, which is quite an accomplishment considering the standards it set. Sam Raimi's vision and passion for the material oozes through with each scene. Raimi is easily the most underrated director of the moment. Each scene is played to perfection, and all of the actors have grown into their characters a bit more, especially Rosemary Harris (Aunt May) and James Franco (Harry), both of whom give much more dimension to seemingly peripherral characters. Tobey Maguire shines through in this one, with an improved performance (looking and acting less and less like Keanu Reeves kid-brother) and Kirsten Dunst is fantastic as always. Considering this is a monstrous Hollywood block-buster of the grandest sorts and will no doubt break records throughout the summer, "Spider-Man 2" is intelligent and fun at the same time. Everyone who has interest in it will walk away happy, fully satisfied -- and most importantly -- salivating for what the inevitable "Spider-Man 3" will bring us.</p></br><a href="../users/AESY8NCX6VS6O.html">AESY8NCX6VS6O</a><br/><p>One of the things that endeared me to the first Spider-Man film (and the first Matrix film) was its provision that it was a cheesey, comic book movie and not afraid to embrace that. I've always believed that super-hero movies/action-adventure movies shouldn't take themselves so seriously, because when they do it usually blows (Reloaded). Well, whereas the Matrix movies got all wrapped up in themselves, the second installment of Spider-Man is still as ready as ever to let that cornball dialogue fly. And that's not a bad thing. There's a real charm to this movie, like its predecessor, that elevates it to a much higher level than the mindless summer flicks with which it plays.<p>  And yes, it is better than the first film. "Leaps and bounds" better, as some critics are saying? No. But it's far more complex, more exciting, and more playful than the original. And while I'm on the subject of complexity, I have to mention maybe one of the greatest superhero villain creations of all time: 2's Doctor Octavius (Alfred Molina). Molina, and the writing and concept behind his character, is really the strength of the film. I was endlessly fascinated by how layered he is: he starts out as a completely aimable man, gets wrapped up in the notion of scientific discovery, becomes a slave to his work, then gives himself over to it, and pursues Spider-Man...not because he's bad, but to advance his scientific cause. Doc Ock makes other movie villains, naturally and illogically evil, look like cardboard cut-outs. <p>  And the plot that grounds the film in realism is intriguing, too. Writer Alvin Sargent's script explores the psychological complexities of being a superhero: sure, Maguire's Peter Parker is a superhero, but why can't he choose to be a normal 20something instead? Is his 'higher calling' so much that he should sacrifice his whole life as well? These questions aren't answered in some ridiculous way, but simply worked out through the smooth, churning gears of the movie's narrative that never slows down too much and picks up to a giddily exciting pitch during the action scenes (that subway fight!). Yes, all the stuff with Mary Jane and Aunt May is shamelessly cheesey, but it's never off-putting. In fact, a scene in which Parker and M.J. walk and talk down a night-time New York street is as well-executed and honest as similar scenes in any recent drama.<p>  Neither Spider-Man movie has been a great film; the fact that this is based on a comic book will always add a level of subliminal silliness that will never be 'overcome.' But why, really? Spider-Man 2 sets out to do something, accomplishes it well, and met my expectations. Even within the constraints of a comic book, though, it reaches depth that few movies of its kind bother to tackle and really makes us care about the characters, and not in a superficial way (James Franco's Harry Osborn is a great example of that - he's set up to be a villain, but do we blame him really?). And it's fun. I'm sick of movies trying and failing to inspire real terror when dark comedy should be the objective - a sublime scene in an operating room had me rolling in my seat and, agree with me or not, I think that was director Sam Raimi's intention. <p>  Should Spider-Man 2 have had the ending it did? Not really. The first two fades-to-black would have made much more compelling conclusions to the film; in fact, I would have been ready to applaud the movie had it ended where you think it might the first time. But why gripe about a final scene that, though syrupy as hell, made me happy in spite of it all? Of course, that's a feeling that stayed with me every minute of the movie, too. GRADE: B+</p></br><a href="../users/AP3B615GM191G.html">AP3B615GM191G</a><br/><p>After being intrigued by my introduction to the Spiderman character (through the first film), I was very excited to see what the second installment would bring now that the whole duel-identity thing was established.  Before the end credits had finished rolling, however, I knew that I wouldn't enjoy this film as much as its predecessor.  I noticed that the screenplay was written by Al Gough and Miles Millar, the creators of TV's Smallville (a show I watch weekly).  I should have been excited by that knowledge, as they created a very interesting show, but instead I felt my heart drop, as I knew EXACTLY the kind of contrived character relationships that would follow (think Clark/Lana on Smallville and you'll understand).<br /><br />The basic plot of the film has Spidey hanging up his red and blue suit in order to spend more time as Peter Parker with crush Mary Jane Watson.  Of course, just when things are looking up for that relationship, the evil Dr. Octopus begins to wreak havoc on New York City, essentially forcing the return of Spiderman and the break-up of Peter and MJ.<br /><br />While that short synopsis may sound like it has great potential for high drama, it (sadly) fails to deliver.  Millar and Gough just seemed to be rehashing the plot of Superman II, where Supes gives up his powers to be with Lois Lane only to see General Zod begin terrorizing Earth.  Thus, the storyline of the movie was a bit predictable.<br /><br />Also, again like Clark Kent and Lana Lang in Smallville, the Peter/MJ relationship is far too contrived and up-and-down to provide any real emotional scenes.  I never felt as if I really cared whether or not Peter/Spidey would save/love Mary Jane.  Adding to the lack of drama was a general lack of acting from Tobey Maguire, who seemed to react to every situation with that same wide-eyed expression.  While that tact worked very well while first harnessing his abilities in the first film, in this movie it just gets old.<br /><br />Finally, while the villain Doc Ock is visually pretty cool (what with all those tentacles flying around!), he again is a bit too much in common with the Green Goblin for my liking, as both were created in freak science experiments gone wrong.  Nothing like the intriguing character development of The Joker by Christopher Nolan in The Dark Knight.<br /><br />So, while the special effects of the film were excellent and the action scenes superb, I can't give it any better than an "average" rating due to all its contrived plots/relationships/characters.  If you are easily sucked in to hokey romances, you won't find any fault in this film.  If you prefer a more mature love story, though, then just watch it to set up your Spidey 3 viewing experience.</p></br><a href="../users/A3N6GAJTEOF4MO.html">A3N6GAJTEOF4MO</a><br/><p>This review will be split into three parts, they will be split into The Story, The Characters and the Verdict. This will give you a fair and honest view of the characters, story and the movie itself.<br /><br />The Story: Harry Osborn has now taken over Oscorp and he's financially backing a scientist called Otto Octavius who's experimenting with sustained fusion as a way of replacing conventional fuels. In order for Otto so sustain the fusion reaction he's developed artificially intelligent arms that attach directly to his spine that he can control as if they were additional arms. One day while demonstrating his experiment, Otto is unable to contain the reaction and it all goes wrong. The experiment becomes unstable but Otto refuses to halt it, it eventually gets worse and his wife is killed and the neural inhibitor chip on the arms is destroyed and they are fused to Dr. Octavius' spine. Thanks to the help of Spiderman the plug is pulled on the experiment and nobody else is hurt, but Dr. Octavius blames Spidey for the disaster. The AI of the mechanical arms seem to tap into Dr. Octavius' brain and begins to manipulate him into wanting to try the experiment again and set out to kill Spiderman. Spidey begins to struggle with juggling his powers, his education and his job and on top of that he has to handle the difficulty of his powers constantly halting at the worst times. Mary Jane is becoming a successful stage actress and desperately wants Peter to be there when she needs him and Harry is looking for revenge against spiderman for killing his father.<br /><br />The Characters: I've discussed both Tobeys & Kirstens characters in my review for the first spiderman film and my feelings are generally the same. The character I'm going to discuss is the character of Dr. Octavius.<br /><br />Doc Oc:  Played by Alfred Molina this is an intelligent choice for Doc Oc as he genuinely looks like the Doc Oc from the comics. He gives us his own brand of intelligence and sophistication when showing us the mental anguish that the character is going through in the movie.<br /><br />Harry Osborn: We've seen a bit of a development in this character from the first movie. In that he was the kid with high expectations and a kid who idolised his father and was chasing after the girl (MJ). In this movie we're introduced to what some could consider a very different character, he seems arrogant yet he's tormented by the death of his father so he's someone who has a lot on his mind. James Franco is great at playing the tormented figure of Harry Osborn.<br /><br />The Verdict: This is clearly the strongest film of the three, the action sequences particularly the fight sequence on the train is one that really gets your heart racing. Alfred Molina really fits the Doc Oc character perfectly and he really makes it believable. It has the general comedy moments that help you relax after witnessing a strongly emotive scene or a high impact fight sequence. The mixture of CGI and real life is un-seamless which gives it all the more realistic look. This is a movie that every comic book fan should own and enjoy for many years to come.</p></br><a href="../users/A141HP4LYPWMSR.html">A141HP4LYPWMSR</a><br/><p>Following up on the tremendous success of the first Spider-Man film, `Spider-Man 2' swung into action two years later in '04 re-uniting Maguire, Dunst and Franco and most of the original cast in a sequel worthy of its predecessor. In this second installment of the series Spidey battles another deranged scientist, the multi-appendaged Doctor Octopus played by Alfred Molina.<br /><br />Along with the expected high quality special effects, terrific action sequences and unfulfilled romantic desires between Peter Parker (Maguire) and Mary Jane Watson (Dunst) this storyline delves into the deeper, more complex aspects of the Parker/Spider-Man psyche. The death of his best friends Father and his beloved Uncle Ben, his inability to share his secret with the girl he loves and the heavy responsibility of being a superhero take a toll on a young man. Is it better than the first? There are many who think so and they may be right, but either way it's definitely a welcomed addition to the Spider-Man saga!</p></br><a href="../users/AMP7TQRWAIE84.html">AMP7TQRWAIE84</a><br/><p>I know how that may sound, but the first one, in comparison, seems rushed. I know it was highly-anticipated, (duh, it's Spiderman!) but they still could've taken their time.<br /><br />I viewed this movie about as much as I saw the first I think. It just seems like they slowed down during production and the thought process during, was much broader, albeit more violent and even darker.<br /><br />At first I didn't like this much, but I watched it the 3rd and 4th time through and I was throughly impressed. One wasn't this good and I only hope that Three will be as great (date is 4/4/08 and I'm still on my way to watch it).<br /><br />Mary Jane is his love interest again, and she's married. However, she breaks up with Harold and goes back to Peter again. They love each other and unlike one, he actually makes time for her this time.<br /><br />The action was great and the villain was a methodical genius. I liked the fight at the bank where money bags were thrown all over and Aunt Mae almost got crushed by that desk. That was entertaining.<br /><br />Cover Art: B+<br />Story: B-<br />Animation: C+<br />Characters: B<br />Dialogue: B-<br />Comedic Value: B-<br />Length: B-<br />Overall: B<br /><br />4.3 stars.<br /><br />end note: final score is still up in the air.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TAPL67U2A5HM.html">A2TAPL67U2A5HM</a><br/><p>Spider-Man 2 (Widescreen Special Edition)~ Tobey Maguire is a stupendous sequel to an amazing superhero movie. Tobey McGuire is doing a bang up job with the role as Spider-man and Kirsten Dunst is so beautiful. The music is great and is right on mark for a super hero movie. The script is very well written and one of the best movies that I have seen in a very long time. I highly recommend it and I give it 5 well deserved stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A36QYTMMJ0O2IZ.html">A36QYTMMJ0O2IZ</a><br/><p>The three pinnacle comic books films are Spider-Man 2, Batman Begins, and the first Superman movie.  Batman Begins and Spider-Man 2 have something in common; they have comic book fans making and writing the films.  If you're going to make a film about a comic book character, then you need someone who is familiar with the characters and the world they inhabit.  This is why so many of the comic book films today are not very good.<br /><br />Al Gough and Miles Millar co-wrote the screenplay for this film.  They are the same "dynamic duo" who gave life and re-ignited the Superman mythology with Smallville.  As comic book fans, they obviously knew what they were doing when they penned this fantastic sequel that surpasses the original at almost every turn.<br /><br />There is a reason why Spider-Man is Marvel's most popular character and the icon for it's company.  No one has the thumb on justice and doing what's right more than Superman, nor does any character surpass Batman for his psychological complexities. Spider-Man is the hero that everyone can relate to.  This is because Spider-Man is a hero with realistic problems that everyone has and goes through.  Despite his impressive array of abilities, Peter Parker has trouble attending classes at his university.  He can barely pay the rent each month.  There was once a scene in one of the comic book series, where Peter Parker has forgotten to do the laundry, and the only clean shirt he has to wear to work is a Strawberry Shortcake t-shirt that a co-worker at the Bugle had given him as a gag.  This is the life of Peter Parker.<br /><br />The movie really hones in on Peter's character and his problems.  He gets fired from his job for always being late.  He's late to watch Mary Jane in her play.  He's back-logged on his paychecks because he's already asked for an advance at the Bugle.  He's on the verge of failing his courses at school.  How is he able to balance his life as Peter and Spider-Man?  This is the inner conflict that befalls him.  At one point, the load is such a burden, that he feels he can't be Spider-Man anymore.  And, yet again, the audience can relate to his character.  The movie works so well because it focuses on Peter Parker instead of Spider-Man.  Batman Begins works because it focuses on Bruce Wayne instead of Batman.  And Smallville is a hit show because it focuses Clark Kent.  Audiences now want and demand rich and interesting characters.  And Spider-Man 2 delivers big-time!<br /><br />Tobey Maguire is wonderful as Peter Parker.  I confess that I had my reservations about him when I first heard that he was cast to play the part.  He mirrors Peter Parker from the comic book so well.  Part of that tribute has to go to director Sam Raimi who is one of the biggest Spider-Man fans around.  He still has a poster of Spider-Man in his bedroom from when he was a kid.  Tobey is able to humanize Peter to such an extent that we share his joy and his pain.  Tobey has also mastered the ability to communicate the feelings of Peter with a simple look.  Words aren't necessary.  We all know what he's feeling.<br /><br />Spider-Man's new foe is Doctor Octopus.  He's wonderfully played by Alfred Molina.  Spider-Man has had many foes over the years, but during the 70s-80s, you can consider Doctor Octopus to be one of his best and most creative foes.  He is not as much a personal nemesis as the Green Goblin, but he has a great intelligence.  Molina give Doctor Octopus an almost sympathetic feel.  Given powers that are a bit similar to Peter's, Octopus obviously chooses a different path.<br /><br />The special effects are much better in this film than the last.  We see Spider-Man swinging in between cars and trucks, fighting Doctor Octopus against the sides of buildings and battling Doctor Octopus on top of a subway train.<br /><br />This DVD is fantastic with lots of great extras, including interviews with famous comic book artists about Spider-Man, Doctor Octopus, and the women of Spider-Man's world.<br /><br />As a former comic book reader for nearly fifteen years, it's wonderful to see this fun character come to life on the big screen.  But, you don't need to be a comic book fan to enjoy it.  As I said, most everyone can relate to Spider-Man.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NUHWMHA9XNKV.html">A2NUHWMHA9XNKV</a><br/><p>Good job i thought they might fall flat with 2 but i think they did a good job I'm from new york and i was in manhattan yesterday where they were filming spider 3 hope it is as much fun as 1 & 2</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>"Spider-Man 2" is the best comic book superhero movie made to date, and not simply by default. The story and screenplay come from Alfred Gough and Miles Millar (co-creators of "Smallville"), Michael Chabon (author of "Wonder Boys"), and Alvin Sargent (Oscar winner for "Julia" and "Ordinary People"), and more than any other film in this genre it is true to the character and what made him Marvel Comics' most popular superhero in the 1960s. I teach a unit on Spider-Man in my Pop Culture class where we compare the original Stan Lee & Steve Ditko stories to what is being published today and my students have to deal with the key elements of the comic book. This time around Sam Raimi has those elements nailed big time.<br /><br />The story picks up two years after the first film, which is reprised through artwork by Alex Ross during the title sequences. Peter (Tobey Maguire) is now in college, working a part time job, fighting crime, and generally making a mess of everything. Being Spider-Man is a burden and it is beating Peter Parker down. He loses his job, his grades are slipping, and even his powers seem to be leaving him. He still loves Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), but all he can envision is a life where his enemies would threaten her life and he has to endure seeing her picture on billboards and posters all over New York City. It becomes clear that our hero is coming to a cross-roads in his life, but we have no idea what will be the final straw, as it could be anything from the bank foreclosing on the house of Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) or Dr. Curt Connors (Dylan Baker) flunking him to J. Jonah Jameson (J.K. Simmons) really firing him from the "Daily Bugle" to Mary Jane ending up with some other guy (Daniel Gillies).<br /><br />What made Spider-Man endearing was that he was the victim of such bad luck. With power comes great responsibility but you would think a guy could catch a break now and then. There is a point where a bruised Peter tries to make his way home and as he reaches out to steady himself against a parked car you KNOW that as soon as he touches it a car alarm goes off. Spider-Man endures a lot of slings and arrows in this film (e.g., Aunt May never told him how to do laundry) and all the while the gods just look down and laugh.<br /><br />The Green Goblin was something of the ultimate villain for Spider-Man because he was the one who learned the web-slinger's secret identity. But the consensus of my students each semester is that Doctor Octopus is the best Spider-Man villain. Dr. Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina) intends to make nuclear fusion work and is employed by Harry Osborn (James Franco), who dreams of making a fortune during the day and of killing Spider-Man to avenge his father at night. Of course things go horribly wrong, and the four metal tentacles that Octavius has created are now fused to his body and have driven him insane.<br /><br />We have all seen the trailer for "Spider-Man 2" and the scene where Doc Ock interupts a potentially tender moment between Peter and Mary Jane by throwing a car through a window at them. This must happen over an hour into the film but it starts off a series of fantastic computer generated fights between the hero and the villain. The reason for this and why the pairing is so perfect is that Spider-Man and Doctor Octopus can both fight on the vertical axis as well as the horizontal. These two go at each other on the side of buildings and falling through the air as well as on top, on the sides, and through the middle of a subway train. Then you throw into the mix that Doc Ock can be carrying off someone Peter loves and still have three mechanical arms pounding away at Spider-Man. More importantly, when Spider-Man travels around by his webbing in this film it no longer looks like something we would expect from a Saturday morning cartoon.<br /><br />But the conflict between Spider-Man and Doctor Octopus is only one of a half dozen that provide the interpersonal web of problems closing in on Peter and the way they all fit together gives "Spider-Man 2" a weight hitherto unsuspected in superhero movies. This point is best evidence by the fact that Aunt May is major supporting character in the film just as she is in the comic book. There were always two women in Peter Parker's life and the one constant was always Aunt May.<br /><br />I applaud the decision to make Otto Octavius a good man for once who becomes the victim of his own brilliance. His scientific discussions with Peter in their first meeting not only show his decency but also reveal to our hero the path he can take if he pursues science rather than crime fighting. After all, Otto is married to the lovely Rosalie (Donna Murphy), who is clearly the doctor's own MJ. Eventually Peter comes to the realization that he does not have to be Spider-Man.<br /><br />I have some ambivalence about what is happening with Mary Jane, mainly because one of my favorite scenes in the comic book was when she finally confessed to a stunned Peter that she knew he was Spider-Man and could no longer stand the fear that he was going to get killed. But I appreciate the idea that Mary Jane gets to be there from the beginning in the movies (as she is in Marvel's "Ultimate Spider-Man") and that Hollywood does not have time to go through Betty Brant and Gwen Stacy to get to Mary Jane Watson Parker and the final shot of Mary Jane in the film certainly gives weight to her character and reinforces again the idea that this time they got everything right.</p></br><a href="../users/A20EEWWSFMZ1PN.html">A20EEWWSFMZ1PN</a><br/><p>This movie takes up where the first one left off. Peter (Toby Maguire) has fallen on bad times he is a loner happy because he knows as Spiderman he can not have friends including Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst); the bad guys would use his friends as pawns. Everything is going to pot. He loses his job, cant pay his rent, his aunt is on foreclosure, he can not make schedule on anything he does. His best friend is out to get Spiderman. And heaven forbid he is falling behind in school.<br /><br />Looks like it is decision time between his Spidy personality and Mary Jane Watson.<br />Which does he chose?<br />Which would you chose?<br />Is there a way out of the dilemma?<br /><br />This film is very slow moving and depressing for at least the first third. They are relying on the reputation of the first Spiderman to carry this almost similar story. When the action picks up that is all it is just action. You may want to fast forward through this as nothing is said or reveled that will have any bearing on the end.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>As children, most of us grow up wishing we could become gravity-defying super heroes, flying around the world, battling villains, rescuing the innocent, and fighting for truth, justice and the American way.  But what if the burden of such a calling turned out to be too much for us?  What if saving the world became a 24-hour-a-day/seven-days-a-week occupation that prevented us from leading a normal life and finding happiness with our one true love?<br /><br />That is the dilemma Peter Parker faces in "Spiderman 2," a deeper, richer, more psychologically nuanced follow-up to the rather innocuous "Spiderman" from 2002.  Most of the major players from the original have returned, including director Sam Raimi and stars Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst.  What's different this time around is that the filmmakers have chosen to emphasize the inner conflict Parker is undergoing between needing to fulfill the awesome responsibilities that go along with being a crime fighting super hero and wanting to chuck it all in order to win the heart of the literal girl-next-door.  Parker finds that being Spiderman keeps him from fulfilling the mundane, run-of-the-mill, day-to-day commitments one needs to in order to have successful relationships with other people - most especially the girl he loves.  When the conflict becomes too much for him, Peter has to decide whether or not he is going to continue to lead this double existence or return to the simplicity of life as a mere mortal.  It is this added intellectual dimension that gives "Spiderman 2" the thematic heft that "Spiderman 1" lacked.<br /><br />The plot, involving a brilliant scientist who inadvertently becomes a killing machine when one of his experiments goes awry, is reasonably entertaining and interesting, though it pales in comparison to the love story and the complex internal conflict taking place in our superhero's overtaxed psyche.  The special effects seem vastly improved over the original, with Spiderman's movements through the air appearing considerably more graceful and natural than they did the first time around.  A spectacular scene involving Spiderman attempting to arrest a runaway train racing uncontrollably through Manhattan is the action highlight of the film.<br /><br />As Parker, Toby Maguire provides the emotional gravity the story needs to be effective.  His shy, self-effacing demeanor draws us to the character and makes him a believable, sympathetic figure whom the audience can relate to and root for all the way through.  The sweet, vulnerable, yet eternally self-assured Kirsten Dunst makes for the perfect romantic counterpart to this young man who's all thumbs and who seems perpetually tongue-tied when he isn't donning his webbed designer jumpsuit.<br /><br />I wasn't a big fan of the first "Spiderman" movie, but "Spiderman 2" has an intelligence and charm that make this particular installment awfully hard to resist.  Raimi may have struck out the first time around, but he has managed to hit a homer - or at least a solid triple with the bases loaded - this time at bat.</p></br><a href="../users/A1SCD2NYTIAQTY.html">A1SCD2NYTIAQTY</a><br/><p>I will not review plot material that is already much-covered by other reviewers. I will add some simple comments about this movie.<br /><br />Firstly, the beginning of the movie seemed to dwell on the "troubled hero" issue for a very long time. While some of this was undoubtedly central to the character of Pete, I felt that it was dragged out for too long. It became somewhat monotonous in the end.<br /><br />However, once the action started, the movie really entered its own league. THe villian, Doc Ock, was awesome and well-played by Alfred Molina, bringing his own sense of internal conflict to the plot.<br /><br />The visual effects are astounding and greatly add to the overall feel of the movie. Also, as a minor point, the Editor provided some nice comic relief, as always. He was not uproariously funny, but he was amusing in his own stingy, opportunistic ways.<br /><br />Overall, a good film with some minor issues not mentioned. For a sequel, it is a good follow-on, and exceeded the first installment in the Spiderman saga.</p></br><a href="../users/AMYW43AHO16SS.html">AMYW43AHO16SS</a><br/><p>The original film was not to my liking.  This film is much, much better.  The difference is there is more character development.  You know and care about who they are.  Technically, this film is a masterpiece.  The is a culmination of Director Sam Raimi's career.  This has all the elements of movies he previously directed.  If you have a surround sound system, crank it up!  The sound is worth the price of the DVD.  The acclaims are justified.  This is probably the best comic book movie of all time.</p></br><a href="../users/A5DIAZ5GT3MC.html">A5DIAZ5GT3MC</a><br/><p>Just when I was about ready to throw in the towel on Hollywood and its univentive sequel/remake/book adaption craze of unoriginal recycling, I sat down to see the second chapter in Sam Raimi's "Spider Man" series. While I enjoyed the first film, it never really drew me in emotionally. It had some real cool action sequences and some interesting special effects but the story was very paint-by-numbers comic book fare. I enjoyed the film's cinematic style, which seemed to me like an homage to the 50's-style of films, but while I wasn't turned off by the the hero's backstory, I was never fully compelled by it either. When I had heard all of the cast members spit the usual studio speech about how the sequel would be even better, I took it very much with a grain of salt. By the time I came out of this movie, however, I was a believer. <p>"Spider Man 2" takes place two years after the original where Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is struggling with the realization that his superhero alter-ego is alienating him from everyone that he loves. His best friend, Harry (James Franco) is stelling stewing over his father's death at the hands of Spidey and the object of his affections, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) is fed up by Pete's inability to committ to her. If that wasn't bad enough, his commitment to crime fighting has cost him more than a few jobs and he's struggling to pay his rent. On the Spider-Man side of things, he has to deal with a new enemy, Doc Ock (Alfred Molina), a transformed version of Otto Octavius, a brilliant fusion engineer whose expirement ends up killing his wife and subsquently driving him insane. As far as super-villians go, this one's a doosy. <p>"Spider Man 2" improves on so many aspects of the first film. Where the first film had Maguire as the akward teen coping with his newfound powers and subsquent responsibilites, this one paints him as the reluctant hero that is banished to a life of personal abandoment. The hero seems like a far greater underdog this go around as Spider-Man must deal with a much tougher villian while Peter Parker tries to put his life back together. I liked the fact that Raimi balanced out the film's jaw-dropping effects with some emotional character depth. There is a good mixture of storytelling and cinematic style here. Raimi also improved on the dialouge here. There are some comedic moments but the rivalry between Spidey and Doc Ock doesn't elevate itself to the level of cheesy line-trading that went on between Maguire and Dafoe in the first. <p>The performances are really what seperates this one from its predecassor. Tobey Maguire is given a lot more to do, this time around. While Molina doesn't have the same charisma as Dafoe, his villian is far more menacing. Kirsten Dunst is given a somewhat smaller role here but it serves its purpose. My one complaint is that Mary Jane doesn't really look the same in this one. In the first movie, she had a much different look to her than most of the characters that Dunst has portrayed. Here, she doesn't carry herself the same way. It doesn't really take anything away from the film but it is somewhat noticeable whether intended or not. There are a good deal of amusing cameo appearances here as well but I'm not gonna spoil them for you. <p>"Spider Man 2" is not just one of the better sequels I've seen in awhile but also one of the best films of its kind that I've seen at the movies in some time. I can't remember the last time that I went into a movie theatre and was entertained on so many levels the way that I was with this film. Maybe low expectations might have played a part in it but in all honesty, I doubt it. No matter what your preconceived notion of this movie is, you will probably be drawn in just the same. You don't have to be a comic book fan or even a fan of the first movie to enjoy but it certainly doesn't hurt things. (Review: ****1/2)</p></br><a href="../users/A9LNWA25IM2DX.html">A9LNWA25IM2DX</a><br/><p>We all know how great Spiderman 2 was, it included one of the classic villains from the comic in an excellent adaptation of the original story delivering a movie that was indeed better than the first one. So I will base this review on the extra scenes and the DVD specs and not the movie itself.<br /><br />Disc 1<br /><br />This one includes the movie with 8 minutes of bonus footage, this footage is not shown separately as `deleted scenes', instead, the scenes were added to the movie so we can consider this an extended edition of the film.<br /><br />- Peter's birthday party is extended. Here, we see Peter and Harry going over Harry's issues with Spidey and the death of his father.<br /><br />- The elevator scene in which Spidey talked about his costume was replaced with another that I personally didn't like, the new one feels awkward and not as spontaneous as the original.<br /><br />- MJ at the shoe store. Mary Jane talks about love and the kiss she got from Spidey with a friend.<br /><br />- Two fight sequences are extended; in the one in which Dr. Octopus takes aunt May hostage, a new bit in which they both crash into an office through the window and fight inside was added. Also, the train sequence has new bits of Spidey and Dr Octopus fighting while hanging besides the train.<br /><br />- Jonah Jameson wears the Spiderman suit while the staff looks amazed, a quite silly scene that I understand why it was originally removed.<br /><br />Bottom-line, the extra 8 minutes do not add anything to the movie; they are tiny bits that were originally removed for a reason. If you are a Spiderman fan and a collector you can get this for a very decent price, if you liked the original and expect to see major changes, the 2.1 version will only disappoint you.<br /><br />The movie includes a trivia track with a lot of information about the comics, the actors and the movie itself; if activated, it will also show you behind the scenes during the movie. The movie screen will be minimized in the lower left corner to show the behind the scene footage in the full screen. Presented in English, French and Spanish (all three in Dolby Digital 5.1) and subtitled in the same three languages. It includes also an audio commentary by Laura Ziskin & Kirsten Dunst.<br /><br />Disc 2<br /><br />The features included here are more oriented to promoting the third movie of the hero. There is a sneak peek for the "Spider-Man 3" movie, which is basically the same scenes from the original trailer plus some interviews with the cast. I rather watch the last trailer for the movie but that one is not included here.<br /><br />There is a `Inside 2.1 Featurette' that describes the process of completion of the scenes, ironically the last comment in this featurette says that `the movie the people will remember will be Spiderman 2 and not the 2.1 version'<br /><br />Another preview for the video game is also here, but when you see it you'll see that it was added just to justify more features in the disc. Also, a look at Danny Elfman composing the music for the Spiderman saga is shown as part of the special features.</p></br><a href="../users/A13TO1ZFAH9SVN.html">A13TO1ZFAH9SVN</a><br/><p>Spiderman 2 has some of the highest expectations to ever be placed on a movie. Spiderman grossed $403 million dollars and is the fifth most successful movie in U.S. history. Spiderman 2 could shatter that number.<p>Spiderman 2 picks up right where Spiderman left us. Peter Parker(Maguire) is a struggling college student. His grades are slipping and so are his friendships with his best friends Mary Jane(Dunst) and Harry(Franco). His Aunt May(Harris) is worried sick about him. His duties as Spiderman are keeping him so busy he's starting to fall apart. He has a huge assignment due in school about a famous scientist and Harry happens to know the guy so he gives him the hook up.<p>Harry is now in charge of special operations at Osbourne Industries. Dr. Otto Octavius(Molina) is a world famous scientist who has ideas on how fusion will save the world. He's created four mechanical arms he wears that help him do the work. An accident happens though that causes the arms to fuse to the Dr and he goes on the rampage because the A.I. from the arms consume him. He is determined to make his fusion work and will stop at nothing to do it.<p>Peter is a little devestated by the accident. He enjoyed meeting Octavius but is saddened by the experience. His life is also getting very hard on him. He finds out Mary Jane is engaged and is so mad with him that she wants almost nothing to do with him. Harry is so obsessed with killing Spiderman because he blames him for his dads death. He's angry at Peter and wants him to give him info on Spiderman. Peter can't take it anymore so he gives up as the web slinger.<p>Peter is happy with his new life. His grades are improving, but his relationship with MJ isn't going the way he wanted. Doc Ock is still on the loose and must be stopped. Will the web slinger give up his new found happy life and stop Doc Ock or will he keep his new found happines. This is the movie that is Spiderman 2.<p>This movie destroys the first one. It's much more entertaing than the first. It doesn't drag like the first one did, because so many new character aren't introduced. The movie is quite humerous in places and it is obvious that Raimi is more comfortable with the character. Raimi's comedic charm is evident all over the film and he takes the story and runs with it.<p>An excellent story has been given to us. The Smallville creators Alfred Gough and Miles Millar contribute to it. The screenplay is from Alvin Sargent who has written a comic masterpiece. The writers did a fantastic job with the story.<p>Tobey McGuire is excellent as Spiderman. He is perfectly cast as Peter Parker. He seems more comfortable with the role and he shines. Kirsten Dunst is hot as Mary Jane. Like everybody else it's obvious she is more comfortable with the role and it's a bigger one for her this time around. Molina as Doc Ock is perfect. A awesome cast was done with this movie and the makers really need to be complimented on the good job.<p>This movie is awesome. It's the most entertaining movie of 2004. It's easily the best comic book movie ever. Spiderman has always had a more humble human trait that so many other comic heros don't have. It's not so much about his powers and abilites, but how much he sacrifices to make the world a beter place. He puts other people above himself and he does so for the right reasons. With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility and that's why we love Spiderman.<p>You have to see this movie. This is what a comic movie should be. It's the best movie to this date of 2004 and is family fun entertainment. You can't call yourself a Spiderman fan and not see it. Go see it and be prepared for a great time.</p></br><a href="../users/AIBRTGBN07D6A.html">AIBRTGBN07D6A</a><br/><p>I have to start by saying I'm fairly biased about this film.  The original was one of my favorite movies, and I grew up reading the comics religiously.  That being said, I do feel I would be able to give it an unbiased review if I didn't like it, but thankfully, that was not the case.<br /><br />Spider-Man 2 is Sam Raimi at his best.  I've never been in a theater where I've felt an audience have so much fun at a movie.  This film had everything: incredible special effects, great dialogue, romantic themes, plenty of action, and some decent acting.  When I first saw the trailer for the film, I thought the special effects looked a bit shoddy, but the final release was amazing.  Everything was seamless, and the attention to detail was very noticeable.  One of the best parts aspects of this film is the comedic elements.  I didn't expect to laugh going into Spider-Man 2, but it pleasantly surprised me and I found it more humorous than most comedies.  The humor is very subtle and some of it is campy, but doesn't come off poorly.  It's great watching Parker trying to deliver pizzas in his costume to meet a deadline, or being forced to use an elevator and make small talk with the other occupant.  Raimi fans will also be pleased with a few Evil Dead II references, and one 30 second scene in a hospital realy stood out and showcased his talent for the horror genre.<br /><br />Raimi captures the essence of Parker so much more closely in this film.  The Parker in this film is given a closer focus on the fact that he still experiences much of the flaws that every other New Yorker has to go through.  From having to live in a run down apartment, to never having any money.  Too many Super heroes come from wealthy backgrounds and have an unlimited supply of money, but Spider-Man is just a below-average teenager who's given an incredible ability. And this is why he's so identifiable and likeable to the audience.  As I said, Raimi does an incredible job of showing this and I couldn't believe how closely the film version of Parker matched the bumbling science nerd I grew up with in the comics.  In addition, comics fans will love this film for all of the hidden references that are stacked in the movie.  There's a cameo of creator Stan Lee, a photographic reference to a famous comic panel of Spidey taking of his mask, oft-quoted lines from the book, and Dr. Connors and John Jameson appear, who feature into the comic very prominently.<br /><br />It does have a few faults, albeit they're hard to notice.  I found that some of Maguire's lines came off a bit forced, which I noticed in the first film.  Franko is also a little stiff as Harry Osborne.  I didn't notice any bad acting, but nothing I would consider Academy-worthy either.  There was also a subplot about a physical problem with Parker that felt out of place in the film and wasn't developed very well.  But it made for some really incredible scenes that I wouldn't want removed.<br /><br />Overall, this is one of the best films I've seen in a long while, and accomplishes that rare feat of surpassing the original.  There were two or three specific events at the end of the movie that really blew me away and that I wasn't expecting, and will make for some very interesting sequels.  As a long-time Spider-Man fan, I can definitely say this movie is very fulfilling, and I would recommend it to audiences of any age and type.</p></br><a href="../users/A3N5XIM9R2OQH0.html">A3N5XIM9R2OQH0</a><br/><p>While the first installment of the "Spider-Man" franchise was certainly a noble beginning, this sequel somehow manages to improve upon it in a big way.  The first movie accomplished the task of getting Spider Man's origins out of the way and setting up the important characters, and "Spider-Man 2" picks up right where the original left off, hitting the ground running as it further examines the struggles of Peter Parker.  As you may remember, Peter can't tell the woman he loves who he is, his best friend wants to kill him and doesn't even know it, and he's having a bit of trouble finding steady work.  While that may not seem like an auspicious beginning, things still proceed to go downhill pretty fast.  <p>Much like its predecessor, "Spider Man 2" presents Peter Parker as the most human of superheroes, struggling to reconcile the responsibility that accompanies his powers with his desire for a normal life.  This guy didn't ask to have superhuman powers, and as we see in this movie, there are times that he'd much rather not be one.  After all, when you like a woman who looks like Kirsten Dunst, and you have lots of evidence that the feeling is mutual, it can be hard to get out there and perform the thankless task of fighting crime.  In all seriousness, though, the moral conflict that Spidey faces forms the heart of the movie.  With a level of emotional depth and a lack of heavy-handedness rarely seen in big-budget blockbusters, this movie brilliantly depicts the tension our protagonist feels as he tries to decide whether he wants to be Peter Parker, mild-mannered student, or Spider-Man, daring superhero.  <p>Since it ups the ante from the original in virtually every other aspect, it only makes sense that "Spider-Man 2" would represent an improvement in the bad guy department, and it doesn't disappoint.  While the villain is once again a brilliant scientist victimized by an experiment gone horribly wrong, Willem Dafoe's cartoonish Green Goblin has been replaced by the fearsomely tentacled Dr. Octopus, portrayed with the requisite gravity by a glowering Alfred Molina.  The Spider-Man series has demonstrated a knack for crafting nemeses as vividly human as its hero, and as with the Green Goblin, we get to see the conflicts played out in Dr. Octopus's head as he decides to complete his fusion experiment no matter the cost.  Perhaps more importatntly, Dr. Octupus's tentacles are a marvel of modern special effects, swinging wildly and with a mind of their own, smashing through concrete, effortlessly tossing whatever they can grab, and dispatching a room full of doctors in one harrowing early scene.  <p>This brings me to perhaps the most attractive aspect of this movie: it actually features believable, fleshed-out characters.  The "X-Men" franchise has done an admirable job in this regard as well, but the "Spider-Man" movies still take the prize thanks to unusually intelligent dialogue and acting that communicates the movie's key themes while keeping the melodrama to a minimum.  Maguire's everyman appeal as Peter is undeniable; Dunst's smart, sensible Mary Jane is one of the only female leads around who actually bring something to the table besides good looks; and James Franco is turning the tortured soul Harry Osborn into a tragic hero of near-Shakespearean proportions.  <p>Anyway, with Dr. Octopus predictably set on a mad quest to finish his project, and Peter the only guy who can stop him, the stage is set for some truly unbelievable combat scenes, surely among the best to be seen in a mainstream movie in recent years.  While I thoroughly enjoyed the plot and character development and all that nice stuff, you can't have a superhero movie without some great action sequences, and this one has plenty of them.  Whether in a bank with bags of money flying around, on the side of a skyscraper with Peter's Aunt May serving as a human shield, or on a speeding train filled with innocent passengers, the two duke it out in frenetic, fast-paced battles that pit webs against tentacles and any other potential weapon that presents itself.  Sam Raimi's apparently one of the only directors in Hollywood these days who can film a tight, tense fight scene without overrelying on CGI effects or cutting every half-second, and we should all be grateful for it.  <p>As if all that isn't enough, we're once again treated to the over-the-top antics of J.K. Simmons, who threatens to steal the show even in his limited screen time as the imperious Jonah Jameson.  Mugging furiously, yelling up a storm, and terrorizing those who come near him, Jameson's character is every bit as scary as his flattop haircut and Hitler mustache would suggest.  Someone could make a movie about this guy, and I might put down some cash to see it.  While many big-budget movies try to inject some comic relief into the proceedings, this one is notable in that it actually does it well.<p>Everything comes to a head in the movie's epic climax, with a concluding half-hour full of revelations, emotional drama, and of course lots of action.  In fact, the bittersweet nature of this movie and its conclusion practically position it as the "Empire Strikes Back" of the Spider-Man series.  Given the massive receipts this movie has already brought in, it's inevitable that there will be a "Spider-Man 3" coming down the chute eventually, especially with the neat bit of foreshadowing at the end of this installment.  If the next sequel is as smartly written and skillfully filmed as this one was, it can't come soon enough.</p></br><a href="../users/AXFI7TAWD6H6X.html">AXFI7TAWD6H6X</a><br/><p>I just got back from seeing "Spider-Man 2". I have to say that it definitely blows away the first film although the first film was wonderful. In the first film, we see how Peter Parker becomes Spider-Man. In the sequel, Peter Parker is struggling to balance his life as a college student, a freelancing photographer, a pizza delivery guy, a nephew, and a friend all at the same time. It is a constant, neverending battle for Peter Parker. Eventually Peter succumbs to his doubts as a superhero and whether the sacrifice is worth it. That in itself was well written out and the writers did an excellent job at fleshing out the true essence of the comic book Peter Parker and bringing him out in actor Tobey McGuire however director Sam Raimi gets full credit for keeping faithful to who the characters are from the comic book pages to the big screen. Alfred Molina as Dr. Octopus was the best casting job. Alfred's portrayal as the brilliant physicist turned psychopath was one of the best performances I have seen from Alfred. The most chilling scene from Molina in the film was when Dr.Octopus woke up in the hospital. That entire scene in general was rather intense and brutal to say the very least. Tobey McGuire and Kirsten Dunst were wonderful as their perspective characters but I have to say Alfred Molina was the highlight of the blockbuster smash for me. I also loved the brief cameos made by QAF's Hal Sparks, Bruce Campbell, and Sam's younger brother Ted Raimi (who played Joxer on "Xena: Warrior Princess"). The special effects were amazing although there were moments that just screamed "I am the cheese" because I could easily tell that they were computer generated. It is rare to see a comic book turned into a movie that is so well written. Sam Raimi stayed true to the essence of the "Spider-Man" series.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B7BUH8834Y6M.html">A2B7BUH8834Y6M</a><br/><p>Tobey Maguire is back as the Superhero with low self-esteem, but awesome super-powers.  If getting bitten by a spider made me buff overnight, gave me perfect vision and the ability to climb walls, I don't think I would have a low self-image, but that's just me. Peter Parker is an odd one. He's in love w/ his childhood friend, but feels that allowing himself to be a part of her life will endanger her because he has &quot;enemies.&quot; Of course, he makes enemies by chasing sirens. <p>This film is full of contradictions. Doctor Octavius (Alfred Molina) dons this ridiculous 22nd century technology that looks like a rip-off of the &quot;squiddy&quot; in &quot;The Matrix&quot; that supposedly helps him man-handle his own man-made sun (his version of creating a fusion reactor) - yet the biggest newspaper in town is doing cut &amp; paste mock-ups like a high school journalism class... no computers... and they send their photographer out with a Nikon F1. Pulleaaase! They stopped making the F1 in 1979. If at least it was an F3, that I could buy - or more likely, an F5.<p>Molina's Jekyl/Hyde relationship w/ his technological enhancements makes him the anti-hero - his flabby belly and flabby chests ripple in the wind without shame, since he can now climb walls and kill the innocent with a swipe of his massive tenticles.<p>Now hopelessly fused with his technological prosthetics that have their own artificial intelligence, the newly dubbed &quot;Doctor Octopus&quot; is on a mission to get Spiderman out of his way, in what is one extremely cool twist on the &quot;bullet time&quot; scenes from the first &quot;Matrix&quot; film and the kung-fu action on top of semi-tractor-trailers in the Matrix sequel.<p>Doc Ock is causing millions of dollars of damage all over the city, yet no one has thought of bringing in an armed Apache helicopter with heat-seaking missles. Dr. Octopus can swing, but he can't fly.  A miniture version of our own sun is tossed into the Hudson River to &quot;extinguish&quot; it, and while it glows yellow-hot, even the water touching the &quot;sun&quot; isn't boiling or turning into steam.<p>There are holes all over this story, but when it's all said and done, you don't really care. You want Peter to stop tripping over his own tongue and tell Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) that he loves her already and for everyone to hold hands and get along... but this is based on the dark Spiderman comic, where Spidey makes everyone else happy, but must must be sad and lonely himself. The action scenes are beautiful and exciting to watch - clever choreography and a lot of really funny moments where the film doesn't take itself too seriously. The movie definitely sets itself up for a sequel on many fronts.  Will the Green Lantern live again? Will we see a new Dr. Octopus - with rusty, yet sparky tenticles? Will Peter &amp; MJ get married and will they end up with an egg-sac full of mutant spiderlings? Don't baby spiders eat their mothers? Oh Hollywood - there is no telling what they will come up with for the sequel.<p>No sex scenes and I don't even remember one foul word in the movie. There is violence, but nothing compared to the evening news. I would say the PG-13 rating is appropriate. The movie is a little too long and intense for very young viewers.</p></br><a href="../users/A2P49WD75WHAG5.html">A2P49WD75WHAG5</a><br/><p>Peter Parker nearly forgets that when due to several crises occurring in his already hectic life, he chucks the famed red suit and mask in a dumpster.  "I am Spiderman no more," he declares.  Indeed, his hectic life is divided going to college, working as a pizza delivery boy, trying to get enough money to pay his long overdue rent, and fighting crime as his alter-ego.  The trouble is, he doesn't have much of a life as a result.  He's so stressed, he even forgets it's his birthday, and hasn't been in contact with his friend Harry Osborn, still grieving over the death of his father in the first Spiderman and still seeking vengeance on Spiderman, and with Mary Jane, acting in The Importance Of Being Earnest.  Unfortunately, an act of crime fighting causes him to be late for the play, disappointing the already beleaguered MJ, who announces that she is seeing someone.  That someone turns out to be the son of The Daily Bugle's J. Jonah Jameson, the egomaniac tabloid editor who still treats Parker like dirt beneath his shoes and prides himself on wanting to drive Spidey out of business.<p>This installment has Spidey fighting Dr. Octopus, the former Otto Octavius, a scientist whose attempts to create a new kind of fusion technology that would yield cheap energy or make Manhattan toast with enough for a side of eggs result in an accident where the artificial nervous system with four shiny metallic tentacles become fused to his body.  Unfortunately, the chip that gives him control of his mind is destroyed, turning him into a villain who wants to restart the fusion experiment that failed.  And for that, he turns to crime, his appearance heralded by the same pounding footsteps reminiscent of a T-Rex in Jurassic Park or Godzilla in Godzilla (1998).  But Octavius isn't a clear cut villain, but a victim of circumstance, like Mr. Freeze in the fourth Batman.  Before his transformation, he's a genius, but also a loving husband to his wife.  He tells Peter Parker that knowledge is a privilege, but also not to suppress the love one feels for someone<p>It seems that Parker is happy to no longer be the webslinger.  His grades improve, he makes an effort to have a life, and his less-stressed look yields a smile on his face, evident in a series of shots with B.J. Thomas's "Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head" playing.  But the question is this.  As his late Uncle Ben told him, he had a special gift, and with that gift, moral responsibility.  His wishes to have a normal quiet life, to win back MJ, are overshadowed by his moral responsibility because he is denying himself his potential, or the importance of being earnest, namely being Spiderman.  Loving MJ is impossible, because saving other people takes precedence, plus she would be his Achilles heel.  All his enemies have to do is take her hostage to gain an edge over him.  And more to the point, with Spidey out of the way, Dr. Octopus and other criminals have a free-for-all.<p>Tobey MacGuire fits snugly in the role of Parker as Parker does in the Spidey costume, someone's who quite appealing, sympathetic, and sensitive, a guy trying to juggle many priorities.  From Indiana Jones's treacherous assistant in Raiders Of The Lost Ark, Joe Orton's lover and murderer in Prick Up Your Ears, the religious mayor of the provincial town in Chocolat, and Diego Rivera in Frida, Dr. Octavius demonstrates another interesting role for the versatile Alfred Molina.  The real surprise here is Kirsten Dunst, who has never been more appealing than here instead of just being another pretty face.  And yes, there is another Stan Lee cameo, but you better look quick aboard a runaway train.<p>Spiderman 2 surprised me by being better than expected and the special effects, which I normally deem a secondary consideration, are superior.  There's a very human story beneath, and as a result, I deem it the best superhero movie I've seen since Superman.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UUP58XPQW3GF.html">A2UUP58XPQW3GF</a><br/><p>SPIDER-MAN 2 is arguably the best comic book action movie ever made. When I saw it in the theaters, I said: "wow"!!I was already satisfied with the original cut and now with Spider man 3 in the horizon, Marvel is coming out with 2.1. Luckily, I managed to see my friend's  sampler.<br /><br />Forget everything else when you watch this extended cut and it's outstanding. The extra 8 minutes of footage add context, lengthen and deepen some emotional scenes, inject the funniest moment of the film and (surprisingly) add and extend fight scenes.<br /><br />From what I can tell, almost all the deleted scenes are incorporated in. The elevator scene when spidey lost his powers, more emotional scene and character depth why he is losing his powers and the clock tower/subway fight with Doc Ock has been extended(although the extended scenes are very subtle).<br /><br />For Spider-man fans(such as myself), it is something that completes the entire context of the film and defines why Peter Parker is such a comic book hero than shall I even say Superman or Batman. He is broke, have a lot of hardships but he still travels the straight and difficult path just to do the right thing. His problems caused him to slowly lose his focus, hence his powers. He believes in (Stan Lee came up with this)"with great power comes great responsibility." and Aunt May's "sometimes we have to give up the things we want the most, even our dreams" just defines Peter as human, with flaws but he is always willing to make a sacrifice.<br /><br />Now, I have some experience with marketing gimmicks to know this is also one. But for Spidey completist, (if it wasn't for us, no 2.1 wouldn't be released)it may be worth the purchase. It is not a superior cut of the original but it does fill up the void between 2 and 3. I already own the SE 2 disc release, as well as the outstanding Superbit version(the superbit version utilized 6.8 gb space out of the 7.4 gb dual layer)and I can't help getting a bitter taste in my mouth and now I heard Fantastic Four is also getting an extended cut.<br /><br />Video: The picture is amazing, although the superbit version is still a bit better. It looked like it has a better transfer from the first release. I didn't see any noise because of the extended scenes. Colors are radiant and vibrant. It was sharp and clean, and for some reason, the 2.1 transfer seemed brighter and yielded more detail in the black levels where needed. Superior transfer from the original SE.<br />Audio: French, spanish, Portugese, English 5.1 DD track, sorry, no DTS-ES. Sound is crisp and loud with 5.1 Dolby Digital track.<br />EXTRA FEATURES: Weak. The special features in the original dvd release are a lot better. For die-hard fans, you still cannot get rid of the original version, it has the best special features.<br /><br />I cannot say this version is better than the first Special Edition or the Superbit, but die-hard fans will be happy to own it although I CANNOT give it a "HIGHLY RECOMMENDED" RATING. It is something you have to think about, if you already have the first SE version, but definitely grab this one if you don't own any of the other previous dvd releases.<br /><br />RECOMMENDED!! It is a weak 4 stars for the dvd release, 5 stars for the movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A18BD98SU49UB7.html">A18BD98SU49UB7</a><br/><p>I am not necessarily going to agree with everyone that this is the best comic book adaptation ever rendered on the screen, simply because I will be the first to admit I haven't viewed all of them. But I will honestly say out of the countless superhero films I have seen: this is, without a doubt, the best.<br /><br />What seperates Spider Man 2, a sequel no less, from its counterpart and all of the other fx crazed superhero movies hollywood has to offer? Simply put, it takes its time. It pauses for a breath and dwells on the human side of Spider Man. He is after all, Peter Parker beneath the mask. He is a human being full of emotional weakness' with physical and spiritual longings. There's love pounding at his hearts door and he doesn't know what to do with it.<br /><br />The villain this time around is a caring professor that loves what he does and has a tender heart for education and furthering the betterment of man. Only when he is "possessed" by his creation is he a villain. He wasn't heading that way in the first place like Willem Defoe in part one. I found myself, as many others, feeling sorry for him, and hoping all the way through that he too will be saved.<br /><br />Sam Raimi took hold of the reins with the same ambition of his original films, the Evil Dead series. Like the saga or not, you could see the fun they were having all the way through. Now it seems, he has developed the same sincerity towards Spiderman.<br /><br />Spiderman 2 rests on common ground, then stands tall, rising uniquely over the rest. Add this to your collection, it has my seal. ~S.A.O.S.~</p></br><a href="../users/A3ENN25NFADE1X.html">A3ENN25NFADE1X</a><br/><p>I saw this film on opening day, once again I was scarred . So scarred, I thought sweat was dripping from my back. I was worried that this film would suck, I WAS WRONG AGAIN.<br /><br />June 30, 2004<br /><br />The day "Spider-Man 2" came out, was the day I tried to remember aii of the great superhero movies that came out in the last 20 years. The first "Batman" film was okay, "Superman" was considered the best superhero film ever, it showed the mythology of Superman in a graphic way. The first "Spider-Man" Film showed more action than plot, or the characters that I'd grown to love. I wanted to know more about Peter Parker and Mary Jane. I like the original Spider-Man, but I was a little disappointed  by the film. That's all I remember about "Spider-Man" was the epic fight scenes between Spider-Man and The Green Goblin. I went to AMC Theaters, I sat down in my seat, and relaxed. I realized I felt that same feeling again, I haven't felt this emotion in two years, I was happy.  I was even happy to walk into the theater, I know that I'm about to see something spectacular when I'm happy.<br /><br />The film began, I was very annoyed by the commercials being showed before the film. In my mind I was thinking, "START THE FILM ." As the lights dimmed I got excited and as the film began, I heard the musical score and I was thrilled<br /><br />THE CRITICS<br /><br />The critics finally got it right. Roger Ebert and Harry Knowles said that this film is probably the best superhero film ever. This time, they were right. My favorite scene was when Peter Parker and Mary Jane were arguing, this scene seems almost human and very emotional. Peter Quotes: "I'm a person, I'm not just an empty seat, punch me I bleed." This scene is an awakening to directors who want to direct. I feel that scene has inspired me in a lot of ways. This scene also got me thinking about our love for Marvel Comics. The hero's in Marvel have other jobs besides saving people, and the "X-Men" are minority's just like other people on earth. We feel sorry for these characters, so in the end we love them more than anything. The DC Comics hero's are either rich or born rich, we can't really fell anything for them, so why should I care about Batman, or Catwoman. As I was watching the film, I realized that the screenwriters had skipped a few Spider-man comics. The film is focused on the morality and the mythology of "Spider-Man." I now know that I was watching the amazing Spider-Man unfold.<br /><br />This film is the new milestone to not only superhero films, but to all films. It not only redefines action films, but changes the way we look at a person and a hero. I LOVE THIS FILM, I RECOMMEND IT.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LVZOK9F7K4CN.html">A1LVZOK9F7K4CN</a><br/><p>Spider-Man 2 begins with the artwork of Alex Ross.  There is a reason for this because - as anyone who has read his book, Marvels, will realize - he has influenced the look of the film.  Here, we see the Marvels through the eyes of ordinary people.  Sam Raimi started this look in the first movie, but here he has deepened and expanded it. <p>Spider-Man 2 is a better movie than the first one.  The reason for this isn't the fight scenes - although they are the best super-hero fight scenes ever!  What's great about this movie is that it is true to its subject-matter.  I attribute a lot of its success to novelist and comic-book geek, Michael Chabon, who contributed to the story.  The script is light-years better than the original's and it captures the spirit of the Marvel Comics.  There are a lot of smart in-jokes, including a completely random homage to Queer as Folk!  <p>Spider-Man 2 shows where the Batman franchise went wrong.  It is a truly fun movie, which the fans deserve.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UW83R0JOZZ6.html">A2UW83R0JOZZ6</a><br/><p>There are many films whose storylines have encouraged sequels - many fail to be as good as the original, an audience's expectations raised due to the freshness of characters and plotlines.  There are only two that come to my mind that surpass their predecessors: "Terminator 2: Judgment Day" and "The Godfather: Part II".  I can now add an easy third to my list, and "Spider-Man 2" is, without a doubt, that third movie.<p>The story continues with Peter Parker (so superlatively played by the boyish, nerdy Maguire) struggling through college, his grades rapidly declining because of the countless hours spent swinging about the city saving lives.  His one true love Mary Jane (Dunst) is now a Broadway actress and model, her face plastered on billboards and posters everywhere.  Aunt May has fallen on hard times, the bank threatening to foreclose on her home and Harry Osborn (Franco), now the proprietor of Oscorp, is still bent on revenge against Spider-Man for the death of his father Norman (the Green Goblin of 2002's "Spider-Man", played by Willem Dafoe).  <p>Time to throw a superb supervillain into the mix.<p>Enter Dr. Otto Octavius (Molina), another scientist earning Peter's utmost esteem with a breakthrough experiment that will change the face of nuclear physics for years to come.  During a presentation of his latest invention that would make Oscorp a multi-million dollar enterprise again, the exposition goes horribly awry and "Doc Ock" is left with four mechanical tentacles bolted into his spinal column, each solid steel "arm" independently functional...and menacing.<p>Torn between the sacrificial life of a superhero and the normal life he truly wants, Pete decides to throw in the towel, surrendering his Spider suit to the trash and coming clean to Mary Jane about his feelings for her.<p>Or does he?<p>With Doc Ock up to no good and Harry's growing animosity for the masked crusader, Peter has his work cut out for him and there is no simple evasion of his civic duty.<p>So many aspects of this film aid in the surmounting of the original, primarily the overwhelming amount of CGI that was handsomely paid for ($54 million alone was spent on digital effects) on a $200 million budget.  What will really take your breath away are the two fight sequences between Doc Ock and Spidey, a melee atop a clock tower and a confrontation aboard a speeding "el" train gasp-inducing.  You'll become so engrossed by the intense physical combat onscreen that you'll forget that the two men you see fighting are not really men at all - they're computer-generated images (for the most part).  We even get an illustrated recap of the first film during the opening credits with original artwork by Alex Ross ("Kingdom Come").  Fanboys will be especially proud of director Sam Raimi's homage to the comic, the shot of Peter depositing the Spidey suit into an alley dumpster taken directly from a panel in Issue #50 entitled "Spider-Man No More".<p>Raimi was so eager to get started on the sequel that he signed on to direct more than a month before the first film was even released and shooting began before the final draft of the script was completed.  Alvin Sargent, along with Michael Chabon, Alfred Gough and Miles Millar penned the screenplay with the guidance of Spider-Man creators Stan Lee (who has a cameo) and Steve Ditko and took the story out into left field.  Whereas "Spider-Man" relied on character establishment and a little schmaltz to win over its audience, "Spider-Man 2" gets dipped in a vat of serious drama, allowing every actor to really show their wares.  <p>Maguire is excellent - Raimi knew what he was doing when he cast the then 26-year-old after seeing his portrayal of Homer Wells in 1999's "The Cider House Rules".  His participation in the sequel became hesitant when he was injured during a stunt in "Seabiscuit" and suffered severe back pains for several months.  A second injury (a broken arm) further delayed shooting, but Maguire rode the storm and kept Jake Gyllenhaal (the actor in mind to replace him, not to mention Dunst's current squeeze) from taking the role that was rightfully his.<p>Raimi made another wise casting decision with British thespian Alfred Molina, a chameleon of an actor who first got recognition as Indiana Jones' greedy jungle guide Satipo ("You throw me the idol, I throw you the whip!") in "Raiders of the Lost Ark"; after the titillating scene where he is covered head-to-toe with tarantulas, Molina is certainly familiar with arachnids and the atmosphere of the "Spider-Man" set suit him well.  He eats the lens as Doc Ock, playing the character with a combination of zeal and earnestness.  After Willem Dafoe's over-the-top theatrics as the Green Goblin, Molina is a breath of fresh air and gives Doc Ock something very important - integrity.  Other actors who were considered for the role included Sam Neill (eh...), Robert DeNiro (`scuse me?), Ed Harris (no thanks) and Chris Cooper (sorry, I just keep thinking Col. Frank Fitts, US Marine Corps).  Aren't you glad Molina made the cut?<p>Dunst, still equipped with her B-movie scream, also gets a chance to put her talents to the test and makes Mary Jane a stronger, more independent woman with much less of a "damsel-in-distress" approach than the previous film.  James Franco is excellent this second time around as Harry Osborn, his bitterness towards Spider-Man spectacularly rendered through his dark, frigid glowering.  Rosemary Harris, a mere appendage in the first, gets to shine considerably as Aunt May, the Oscar-winning actress's dramatic prowess manifested in her scenes with Maguire.  J.K. Simmons is still a ball of fire as J. Jonah Jameson, senior editor of the Daily Bugle, with his perpetual anti-hero sentiments of Spider-Man and Elizabeth Banks (Betty Brant) and Bill Nunn (Robbie Robertson) reprise their roles with pride.<p>The film ends once again on a climactic note, setting the stage for a spectacular sequel and you'll have a pretty good idea which villain will make an appearance.  Sony Pictures greenlighted a third installment back in March of this year - the movie is slated for a 2007 release, but may even be pushed to 2006 if production goes well.  Let us hope so, because if "Spider-Man 2" is a promise of an even greater film to come, we're all in for a real treat!</p></br><a href="../users/A2VUP5US1F5HG5.html">A2VUP5US1F5HG5</a><br/><p>Following up on a successful film--especially a runaway blockbuster like the original SPIDER-MAN--is always a risky undertaking, and one which frequently falls flat. Fortunately director Sam Raimi, Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst and company are up to the challenge in SPIDER-MAN 2, the rare sequel to live up to its predecessor. When ambitious scientist Dr. Otto Octavius is transformed into a metal-tentacled man-monster in an experiment gone awry, even J. Jonah Jameson knows Spider-Man is the only one who can stop him. Or can he? And as if the rampaging Doctor Octopus isn't enough, everyone's favoite Wallcrawler must also contend with the generally grisly ups and downs of everyday existence as he struggles in vain to hold together something resembling a normal life as Peter Parker: his grades are slipping, he can't hold on to a job, best friend Norman Osborne obsesses over Spider-Man's demise, he's on the brink of losing Mary Jane forever to no less than Jonah Jameson's son, and even his relationship with his beloved Aunt May suffers. It's all enough to make even a hero consider throwing in the towel. But if Peter Parker isn't Spider-Man, then who is he?<br /><br />  This is a tremendously exciting movie, with great stunts and special effects and the battles between Spider-Man and Doc Ock are a wonder to behold. But like the first Spider-Man flick, the sequel goes beyond the action and spends a lot of important time building characterization with all the leads. The characters in this movie are not just punching bags. They are real people with real-world problems and there are no easy answers. The script is literate and well-crafted, with the theme of identity/self-discovery skillfully interwoven throughout. Though it is a much more serious film than many comic-book adaptations, there is some nice comic relief and the sense of wonder never wavers.<br /><br />  One reason for the success of the Spider-Man films is great casting. Tobey Maquire is of course letter-perfect as Peter Parker/Spider-Man, capturing the essence of the iconic Everyman superhero flawlessly. Kirsten Dunst is an excellent Mary Jane as well, and in some ways her portrayal of the character is more likeable than the one in the comic book. And Alfred Molina hits Doc Ock dead-on, bringing one of comicdom's great villains to devastating life just as effectively as Willem Dafoe did the Green Goblin. Many forget that for several years Doctor Octopus was Spider-Man's number-one enemy dating back to Spider-Man #3, when Doc Ock was the fist villain to beat Spider-Man head-to-head (temporarily, of course), but no one will doubt his status in Spider-Man's rogues' gallery after seeing this movie!<br /><br />  The only real complaint I have with this film is that Doctor Octopus's character is drawn much more sympathetically than in the source comic, though his personal crisis does parallel Peter Parker's own quite nicely.<br /><br />  Whether or not it's equal or better to the original in every respect, SPIDER-MAN 2 is highly entertaining cinema that most fans will love. The adventure, drama, and romance are all exceptionally well-done, and SPIDER-MAN 2 is certainly one of the best superhero movies ever made.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R9GZ8FC44MF5.html">A1R9GZ8FC44MF5</a><br/><p>It improves on the first in almost every way, except for explosions.  The first had more explosions but this one has much better fight sequences, that are intense and very well choreographed, esspecially the clock tower and train fight.  The finale could have been better though, maybe if the machine exploded instead of just goin underwater, and the last fight was longer, o well, the first has a better finale but the rest of this one is better.  This one also has a better performance from Tobey(who is definetly goin places) who shows he could be the best new actor out there besides Colin Farrel maybe.  This ones also very funny and made me laugh more then any stupid comedy out there(comedies suck).  Its dramatic and well thought out, the action rules, and the story is deep, this is by far the best super hero movie so far in the history of cinema( Batman sucks his not even a superhero, so do the movies) see this movie, if you dont you will miss on a great time, i give it a 8 out of a 10, if only the finale was better, i cant wait for the spiderman 2.5 dvd, hopefully the add more to the end.</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>Taking issue #50 of "Spider-Man" as its starting point, Peter Parker decides he needs to get a life outside of Spider-Man. Parker discovers that crime never pays for the hero (or at least his overdue rent). Since he doesn't have time to do his college homework, is failing classes and no has relationship with MJ because of his alter-ego, Parker decides to give up the Spidey suit. When his powers begin failing him because of his indecision, it's the final web for Parker. Parker has lousy timing, though, as just as all this is occurring as Doctor Octavius (Alfred Molina in a marevlously nuanced performance)one of Peter's idols goes mad and becomes a supervillain causing havoc. J. K. Simmons is hillarious as J. Jonah Jameson capturing just the right element of tabloid journalism (and the scenes at The Daily Bugle plays like a miniature screwball comedy that could well have been made in the 40's)that drives Jameson to make Spidey a villain. The rest of the cast from Maguire, Dunst, Franco all the way down to Rosemary Harris as Aunt May capture elements of what made the comic characters so compelling.<br /><br />With a witty script written by Alvin Sargent ("What About Bob?", "Julia", "Straight Time" and "Unfaithful" among many other scripts)and with contributions by other notable writers (Michael Chabon Pultizer Prize author of The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay), "Spider-Man" soars precisely because of the issues that Parker faces. Sam Raimi's sure handed direction and visual effects that rank among the best  (although sometimes the CGI Spider-Man looks exactly like, well, a CGI representation of Spider-Man)keeps "Spidey-2" from being earthbound. "Spider-Man 2" visits familiar territory for super hero films (already visited by "Superman 2")but has enough originality to stamp the story with its own stamp. Is it better than the original? You'll have to decide for yourself as the first film was exceptional but "Spider-Man 2" at least measures up precisely because it's more character driven.<br /><br />Comparing the different versions of "Spider-Man 2" is a challenge (there's three out there in the US). The best looking of the bunch is the Superbit edition in which all the extras are shaved off with all the extra disc space devoted strictly to the high definition transfer of picture and sound. Not surprisingly, this edition looks and sounds the best with a crisper picture, sharper images and top notch sound that sounds only slighly better than the 2 disc convention set. The catch is that the Superbit Edition has no extras and is a single disc. You'd also have to have a top-of-the-line system to really, really appreciate the differences (although on a big screen TV you'll see some of them readily apparent). If the person you're buying this for is into the best looking and sounding digital audio and video, this is probably the edition to get.<br /><br />The 2 disc set looks pretty darn good with a high definition transfer that looks and sounds almost as good as the Superbit Edition. We also get "Spider-Facts" which is, essentially, a text only commentary track. While it occasionally has some interesting tidits about the film (and many outside of the film such as tidbits about New York City), it's dispensable. There's also a blooper reel which is amusing included on the first disc as well as previews/trailers for various films.<br /><br />The second disc (which could easily have been included in a deluxe 3 disc Superbit Edition set for videophiles)includes a stunning 12 part documentary that discusses the production of the movie from pre-production to the premiere. It's exhaustive and fascinating to watch all on its own as a documentary. "Ock-Umentary: Eight Arms to Hold You" (a rather witty reference to The Beatles' film "Help!") is also a very good documentary on the history of Doc Ock from his first appearence in Spider-Man # 3 to the 60's cartoons to how they adapted the character for the film.There's also a number of very good featurettes including a discussion of the women in Spidey's life (which is only appropriate as two women dominate his life and influence most of his personal decisions),"Enter the Web" uses multi-angle technology to give a glimpse behind-the-scenes of the shooting of the climax of the movie. There's also an art gallery of Alex Ross' paintings from the title sequence (which is used as a brilliant device to sum up the first film for viewers who missed it and reminding everyone of what happened). We don't get any worthwhile games (that's a definite negative for gamers who want to try "Spider-Man 2: The Game") but get a featurette on the making of the game. There's also the usual weblinks. Oh and if you click on one of Doc Ock's tentacles you'll find an Easter Egg showing a very funny practical joke director Sam Raimi played on actor Alfred Molina.<br /><br />The commentary tracks feature director Raimi, Maguire and the producers and there's also a separate Technical Commentary featuring effects supervisor John Dykstra and others discussing how they achieved the look of the film. For those folks who purchased this at Best-Buy early enough got an extra disc that had the VH-1 Special on the production of the movie. It's OK and more promo piece fluff than behind-the-scenes documentary.<br /><br />The boxed comes with the conventional two disc set (without the Best Buy disc which is a bit curious as it would have been a nice addition) plus a comic collector's dream team of 25 artists with paintings inspired by the film. There's a portfolio that allows you to view various scenes from conception to final product (which would have been put to better use on a multi-angle DVD for videophiles). Taking an idea from the re-release of "The Good, The Bad and The Ugly" (a Raimi favorite), there's five postcard sized reproductions of the artwork used to publicize the film including the trio of promo posters that were plastered all over cities. Finally, there's a reproduction (reduced to fit in the set)of The Amazing Spider-Man # 50 issue that inspired much of the story. They probably also should have included The Amazing Spider-Man #3 where Doc Ock first appeared as well, but that's a pretty minor point.<br /><br />All in all,the last set makes the better Christmas or birthday gift for fans. Regardless, the film is the same just differing in presentation. "Spider-Man 2" has a number of detractors that don't care for it. They probably shouldn't buy the film or rent it. For the rest of us who liked it, this is an intelligent, fun film thats only major flaws is that it runs about 15 minutes too long.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GKPMHV4U64IY.html">A3GKPMHV4U64IY</a><br/><p>I heard many mixed reviews about this movie so I put off buying it for quite some time.  After having watched it I felt it was definitely lacking many of the characteristics that made the first movie appealing.  The two main themes in this movie are Peter Parker having trouble with his powers failing and the new super-villain Doctor Octopus.<br /><br />Now Doc Oc was never one of my favorites but this revamping is even worse.  Pains have been taken to show Doctor Octavius as a truly good man.  Artificial intelligence has been added to his arms and an inhibitor chip to keep them under control.  But after the accident with the completely unshielded reaction the Doc falls victim to the arms.  I have to say that when one of the arms told him to rob a bank I had to wonder why he had ever programmed the arms with such knowledge.  Spider-Man has his arms full trying to stop him before the movie ends.<br /><br />We also have scenes of Spider-Man having trouble with his powers.  Sometimes his webs won't work and he loses strength and web-crawling abilities off and on.  But the thing that really got me was the way he pulled off his mask at every stumbling block.  By the end of the film one has to surmise that half of the city has had the chance to see who he really is.  Peter seemed completely unconcerned with protecting his identity.<br /><br />Mary Jane, Harry, Jonas and Aunt Mae all make their appearances and have their roles to fill with Peter bouncing around uncontrolled from one situation to another.  All in all it was a disappointing film and far below the standard set by the first.</p></br><a href="../users/A2T2MYZEB81NOQ.html">A2T2MYZEB81NOQ</a><br/><p>SPIDER-MAN 2 IS THE BEST COMIC BOOK MOVIE I'VE EVER SEEN! It has a wholly good plot, acting more perfect than the first, and so many more cool things happen in it, too. Doctor Octopus, my second most favorite Spidey villain next to Green Goblin(who already had his turn, of course)is given a full-fledged treatment as the villain of this movie. Spidey is cooler than ever, and Harry is being the big jerk he's meant to be. Aunt May gets a couple of licks in herself, and Mary Jane is even more beautiful. On top of all of that, this 10/10 film also has so many unexpected things happening in it! I have most certainly said enough. See it, for God's sake! SEE IT!</p></br><a href="../users/A18RQ2URRGIIEA.html">A18RQ2URRGIIEA</a><br/><p>Marvel Comics' superhero Spider-Man, a.k.a. Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire), made a triumphant return to the big screen in the 2004 sequel "Spider-Man 2".  Again directed by Sam Raimi, "Spider-Man 2" finds Peter Parker struggling to earn a living, lives in a dumpy apartment alone, attending college and continues to crave Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) and while saving the lives of people in trouble as costumed & secretive Spider-Man.  However, Spider-Man is starting to have problems slinging webs and scaling walls like a spider, while Peter's best friend, Harry Osborn (James Franco), who has taken over the leadership of Oscorp, has invested millions of dollars into a project to create fusion energy as designed by the scientist Dr. Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina).  To help him successfully control the fusion reaction, Dr. Octavius designs a set of four cybernetic arms that he attaches along his spinal cord.  While Peter, Harry and a host of invited guests watch Dr. Octavius start the reaction, it suddenly goes out of control and destroys the chip that keeps the cybernetic arms under the control of Dr. Octavius' mind.  The result: Dr. Octavius is taken over by the less-than-ethical cybernetic arms and becomes a powerful criminal force determined to reattempt his dangerous fusion experiment regardless of the consequences.  As for Peter, with diminishing superhero abilities and his desire to recapture Mary Jane's heart from her new fianc&eacute;, the astronaut John Jameson (Daniel Gillies) who is also the son of J. Jonah Jameson (J. K. Simmons), he decides to throw away his Spider-Man costume in an attempt to live a normal life; but will that be possible with a menace as powerful as Dr. Octavius, a.k.a. Dr. Octopus, roaming the streets and threatening innocent lives?  Will Harry ever come to terms with his father's death, as shown in the first "Spider-Man" film?  You will just have to watch this exciting return of Spider-Man to find out!<br /><br />As with the first "Spider-Man" film in 2002, the 2004 sequel has wonderful cinematography and great special effects.  The story is also quite entertaining and engaging.  Other memorable characters include Aunt May Parker (Rosemary Harris), Rosalie Octavius (Donna Murphy, who played Anij in the 1998 "Star Trek: Insurrection"), Mr. Aziz (Aasif Mandvi) and a brief appearance from Harry's deceased father, Green Goblin/Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe).  Overall, I rate "Spider-Man 2" with 4.5 out of 5 stars, rounded up to 5 stars and highly recommend it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NQI2JLNPFOF8.html">A3NQI2JLNPFOF8</a><br/><p>Pleased with his directoral accomplishment of the first film and comfortable with his talents, Sam Raimi weaves this film together with a fluidic ease that comes across flawless to every single moviegoer that saw this.  It's not perfect, of course, but still worthy of five stars and repeated viewings.  It's been said over and over but the best thing about this movie is that it chooses to focus on Peter Parker rather than Spider-Man.  The major theme is: What drives us to do the things we do and is it worth doing these things even if we suffer?  Someone mentioned to me once that he found it ridiculus that Parker only seemed clumsy and unsure of himself when he was in street clothes and not in the Spider-Man suit.  Actually, this is what is facinating about the character.  His clumsiness is all in his head untill he puts on the mask....then he reafirms himself that he is more than just a geeky kid.  Parker's problem is that he doesn't know how to carry that confidence with him throughout his ordinary life.  This is what's so charming about the character.  He's NOT a super-man.  He's NOT perfect.  He CAN'T save the world.  But he's learning how to be a real person.  Not just a superhero.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>This is probably the best superhero movie perhaps this side of 'Superman,' and if you don't like this kind of film, you must see it.  Not because of its special effects; they are superb as expected, but that is not the point.  You should see it simply because it skillfully presents the credible characters with deep emotions, and the film is not afraid of stopping a while to show how a superhero can be a real human, and a villain can too.<br /><br />The carefully written script (by Alvin Sargent, 'Julia') picks up the story of the original after two years.  Peter Parker is still a struggling photographer while Mary Jane is about to have a commercial break as stage actress.  Peter is still in love with her, but because of the incessant crimes of the city, he again broke the promise he made with her.<br /><br />Then Peter is invited to a room of genius scientist Doctor Otto Octavius (by pefectly cast Alfred Molina).  Doc's new experiment, supported Peter's old friend Harry Osborn (James Franco, reprising the role), is going to be held in the city, and Peter is allowed to witness it, and its awful failure, which turns Doctor into a villain with robotic tentacles.<br /><br />Written on paper, the story looks as silly as any other recent films you name, but the results are just brilliant.  The story is always interesting, being unpredictable at times, with slight amount of humor and lots of first-rate special effects.  In the middle of the speedy action scenes, director Sam Raimi shows his sense of humor, which is both surprising and hilarious.  (My favorite: Spider-man using elevator.)  And see Doc in labo, making a havoc there, which is shot with his trademark camera work that made him famous in 'Evil Dead'.<br /><br />'Spider-Man 2' is probably better than the first one, in making more convincing characters and presenting well-balanced storytelling.  Of course its great CGIs are not to be missed, but more amazing thins is that these CGIs really support the main feature of the film -- the characters we truly care.  And that can be rarely found.</p></br><a href="../users/A3IDMLOWLHWNDJ.html">A3IDMLOWLHWNDJ</a><br/><p>"Somehow, I've always been standing in your doorway."<br /> - Mary Jane Watson tells Peter Parker to open the damn door in "Spider-Man 2"<br /><br />On November 30th 2004, the saga of Spider-Man continues as "Spider-Man 2" hits DVD for the holiday season of '04.<br /><br />I got the spec. details today and this sounds like the best version of the film to get.<br /><br />The Gift Set contains the 2 disc widescreen version of "Spider-Man 2", with a reprint of "Amazing Spider-Man" number 50 (the issue that inspired the film), 4 postcards that each represent one of the four teaser posters that were released last spring in theaters, a sketch book on character, costume, & set design, and a photo book closing out the set. The box is a black with webbing background, with the image from the final release poster (Spider-Man holding onto Mary Jane) in the center (as of this review, Amazon doesn't have an image of the box art to show).<br /><br />The movie itself is up there as one of the best sequels in recent memory. Right up there with "The Godfather part II", "The Empire Strikes Back", "Terminator 2", & "Aliens".<br /><br />After his life hits the skids, Peter Parker hangs up his webs as Spider-Man, convinced that New York's popular web-slinger has done nothing to Peter but brought emotional pain to his family & friends and destroyed his life as a whole. But, Mr. Parker is about to get an unwanted second opinion in the form of a certain six-armed Doctor, wreaking havoc throughout New York City.<br /><br />With great power comes great responsibility.<br /><br />But, at what cost?<br /><br />The film has quite a few memorable moments both dramatically, as well as action (the film doesn't drag). The scene where Peter finally confesses to his Aunt what happened the day of his Uncle's death is one of the more powerful and heartbreaking in the film. The SFX are leaps and bounds above the first film. The subway battle is the best in the series so far and the bank heist fight isn't too shabby either.<br /><br />If you missed this one in its theatrical run, well, your loss, loser! But, this is your chance to get one of the best films of 2004 in a deluxe box set.<br /><br />If you are one of the three people who missed this one in theaters, I got three words for ya.<br /><br />Hobgoblin.

Tobey Maguire returns as Peter Parker, Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane, James Franco as Harry Osbourne. This movie feature Doctor Octavious, now the weak point of this movie is the motivation for Doc Oc being Doc Oc. My other problem is that magically peter doesn't want to be Spider-Man, because he keeps missing out on dates with Mary Jane. And because of that, he starts to lose his powers if you will. Until the end, when Mary Jane gets kidnapped by Doc Oc. And Spider-Man comes roaring back, with a fight on the subway with Doc Oc. Who is really working for Harry, who has gone crazy. Blaming Spider-Man for the death of his father, which Harry in the comics actually did blame Peter. And lead to Harry being the Hobgoblin, of course that doesn't happen in this movie. Although Harry does find out that Peter is Spider-Man, In the end Peter rescues Mary Jane, without his mask on. And he convinces Doc Oc, to destroy the machine he was trying to build. Killing himself in the process, All in all. I would say the first two Spider-Man movies are excellent, it's the third one that ruined the series.</p></br><a href="../users/AHBNPMHDWZ7SB.html">AHBNPMHDWZ7SB</a><br/><p>Spider-Man 2 is what fans dream about when the sequal to a movie as fantastic as Spider-Man is announced. Topping a film as great as that one is a definite challenge, but it seems to happen more and more each passing year. Sequals like this one, X2: X-Men United, T2: Judgement Day, The Dark Knight, and others all have one thing in common. Beyond just being a "sequal", they managed to outdo their predecessors in almost every way. Spider-Man 2 is not only a great sequal, it is one of the best comic book movies ever made. It doesn't go for the mature adult feel that The Dark Knight has. On the contrary, Spider-Man 2 maintains that corny camp and tongue-in-cheek humor that made the first one so good. Sure some of the dialogue is cheesy at times, and the action is never tries to be realistic, but isn't that why we go to these movies? To be virtually thrilled to the point of exhaustion? Okay, maybe that's taking it a bit far, but my point remains that these films don't need to strive for realism. Their fantasy elements and use of childlike imagination and wonder are what make them so great.<br /><br />Its about a man with spider-like abilities fighting a man with mechanical tentacles attached to his back. The only thing I felt was lacking in TDK, is very abundant in Spidey 2. There is great humor, and the movie has the overall feel of an actual comic book. I also got a sense of the director and writers respect for their source material, but not being afraid to have fun with it. The ending of this film gave me chills the first few times I saw it. It wasn't until Spider-Man 3 actually came out, that the end of Spidey 2 lost some of its magic. Spider-Man 2 is in a solid second place on the list of my favorite comic book movies of all time. Right above films like The Avengers, Sin City, Iron Man, etc. There is really only one thing I didn't like about the movie. There were too many close-ups of random women screaming. It was okay once or twice, but not four or five times. That's minor though. This movie was a fine achievement. As for the Blu-ray transfer. Is it as great as the first one's? An emphatic yes! Even better, in fact. The adundance of detail and clarity are remarkable. This disc is a reference disc to show how amazing catalogue blockbusters can look. Once again, the essential extras from the DVDs have been ported over to this re-release, making this the best available version of the film on the market. Highly Recommended!</p></br><a href="../users/A1Z2ZN39LL07GI.html">A1Z2ZN39LL07GI</a><br/><p>i buy this edition like new not new because the pricest is lowest.

I recommend this<br />good sequel.</p></br><a href="../users/A6VXZ1EEPRTLV.html">A6VXZ1EEPRTLV</a><br/><p>Sam Raimi's Spider-Man (2002), was an uneven, and somewhat unsteady feature film debut, for the intrepid webhead.  With the preliminaries out of the way, Spider-Man 2 (2004) is a bit scattered in places, but is still a more streamlined and focused effort, that solidly delivers action, drama, and excitement.  Technical advances in special effects, and a tighter screenplay, contribute to the impressiveness of the film.<br /><br />Alfred Molina is cast as Dr. Otto Octavius, and he nails the character almost perfectly.  Although it might have been better if they had him keep his shirt on, and made him look slimmer.  Donna Murphy as Octavius's wife Rosalie, has a brief but key role, demonstrating that Otto is really a lovable, sensitive guy, who only becomes delusional, when his mind is taken over by his mechanical arms.<br /><br />The sequel picks up some two years later, with Peter Parker (Toby Maguire) in college and living in New York City, but struggling to keep a steady job, pay his rent, and maintain his grades.  Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) has moved on, and is involved with astronaut John Jameson (Daniel Gillies), son of J. Jonah Jameson (J.K. Simmons).  Harry Osborn (James Franco) has assumed a significant role in Oscorp, and is backing Dr. Octavius's fusion experiment.  When an accident occurs during a test, Rosalie is killed, and a set of `smart' mechanical arms becomes fused to Octavius's body.  The arms take over his mind, and after disposing of a surgical team, Octavius decides to finance his fusion experiments by turning to crime.  Doc Ock and Spidey tangle for the first time, in a spectacular battle inside a bank, which continues up on the side of a building, with a very plucky Aunt May (Rosemary Harris), in the middle of the fray.<br /><br />The subtext of the film is Peter's inner conflict about being Spider-Man, which apparently is keeping him from finding happiness.  The conflict manifests physically, when Peter becomes nearsighted, and occasionally loses the ability to generate his webbing.  The resulting George of the Jungle like crash landings, get old fast.  Peter's head gets so messed up, that he sees a psychiatrist, who screws him up even more.  Peter tosses his costume into the trash, quits being Spider-Man, and returns to a `normal' life, looking like Harry Potter.  Peter is blasted out of complacency, when Doc Ock kidnaps MJ.<br /><br />The special effects are stunning, as Spidey returns to battle Doc Ock on a train.  Unfortunately the ending of this thrilling sequence, is marred by pure idiocy, as Spider-Man makes like Fred Flintstone, trying to stop the train using his feet.  Spidey winds up without his mask, this time before a trainload of witnesses.  Doc Ock is relentless, and delivers an unconscious Spider-Man to Harry Osborn in return for the tritium he needs for his experiments.  Doc Ock didn't bother to unmask Spidey, but Harry does, becoming perhaps the 100th person, to discover Peter's `secret' identity.<br /><br />The film's final battle is visually impressive, and quite brutal, but still somehow kind of hollow and contrived, as Doc Ock regains his senses, and decides to try and redeem himself, by `drowning' the fusion reaction, and sadly himself as well.  Doc joins The Goblin in supervillain heaven, after becoming the 101st, to discover that Peter is Spider-Man.  MJ follows as the 102nd, and the crisis ends on a romantic, but bittersweet note.  Harry receives a visit from his dead father, while in a very uncool move, Mary Jane mimics The Graduate, setting the stage for Spider-Man 3.<br /><br />Spider-Man 2 is the best of the three films produced so far.  The central story involving Doc Ock is strong, an effort is made to devote some quality time to Aunt May, and a few moments are spent with JJ Jameson, and the Daily Bugle gang.  The MJ/Peter relationship remains pretty awkward, and sometimes silly, but is still an improvement over the first film.  Kirsten Dunst shines, when put in a dangerous situation.<br /><br />It seems that Sam Raimi can't resist unmasking Spider-Man.  Perhaps he believes that providing proof that Maguire is really inside the costume, results in the audience identifying more with the character, but it is just so overdone.  Spider-Man 2 nicely builds momentum, and moves forward strongly.  It loses focus at times and gets off on a few silly tangents, some related to trying appeal to a youthful audience.  The resolution may not be entirely satisfying, and but the overall ride is quite exciting and fun.</p></br><a href="../users/A3IDMLOWLHWNDJ.html">A3IDMLOWLHWNDJ</a><br/><p>"I believe there is a hero in all of us.

Ever.<br /><br />The saga of Peter Parker and his alter ego, Spider-Man, continues as Parker has to deal with losing one of his two jobs, slipping grades (web-swinging at night is not a form of studying), a Russian landlord, Harry Osborn's drunken revenge on Spider-Man, and, worst of all, his life long crush, Mary Jane Watson, announces she's engaged to an astronaut that, adding insult to injury, is the son of J. Jonah Jameson, New York's tighest tight wad, publisher of the cities paper "The Daily Bugle", and Peter's boss. When Peter gives up being Spider-Man (thats after losing his web making abilities from psychological stress), things go from bad to worse as a new nemisis rises in the form of the six-armed mad scientist Otto Octavious.<br /><br />Man, think you've had a bad day?!<br /><br />"Spider-Man 2" is easily one of the best sequels made (right up there with "The Godfather II", The Empire Strikes Back", "Aliens", & "Terminator 2"). Sam Raimi's direction is at his best (yeah, that includes "A Simple Plan" & "The Evil Dead" films) and, again takes extreme care of bringing the comic book storyline to life.<br /><br />The cast is back and is in great form (it was also great to see cameos from Cliff Robertson & Willem Dafoe). You could almost peel the angst & heartache from Peter Parker right off the screen!<br /><br />The action sequences are instant classics, especially, the bank robbery scene & the subway car battle.<br /><br />I could go on all day, but, go see this movie - NOW.<br /><br />Stop reading.<br /><br />Go. Shoo.<br /><br />One other thing - three words...<br /><br />Venom. Summer. 2007.<br /><br />**It's been almost 3 long years since "Spider-Man 2" hit theaters & with the third installment less than a month away, Sony has decided to re-release "S-M 2" in a "2.1" version with 8 minutes of additional footage. Is it worth the upgrade? In simple terms - No. There are a couple of bits & pieces of fight scenes inserted back into the film, a scene between Mary Jane & her best friend that slows the movie down (MJ's best friend is actress Vanessa Ferlito who plays Butterfly in "Death Proof", the second film of "Grindhouse"), & a few other alternate or extended takes. The bonus disc is nothing short of delving too deeply into the visual effects aspect of the film (it goes to the point of boredom). If you can get this for under ten bucks, like I did, you will happy.**</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>&quot;Spider-Man 2&quot; is the best comic book superhero movie made to date, and not simply by default.  The story and screenplay come from Alfred Gough and Miles Millar (co-creators of &quot;Smallville&quot;), Michael Chabon (author of &quot;Wonder Boys&quot;), and Alvin Sargent (Oscar winner for &quot;Julia&quot; and &quot;Ordinary People&quot;), and more than any other film in this genre it is true to the character and what made him Marvel Comics' most popular superhero in the 1960s.  I teach a unit on Spider-Man in my Pop Culture class where we compare the original Stan Lee &amp; Steve Ditko stories to what is being published today and my students have to deal with the key elements of the comic book.  This time around Sam Raimi has those elements nailed big time.<p>The story picks up two years after the first film, which is reprised through artwork by Alex Ross during the title sequences.  Peter (Tobey Maguire) is now in college, working a part time job, fighting crime, and generally making a mess of everything.  Being Spider-Man is a burden and it is beating Peter Parker down.  He loses his job, his grades are slipping, and even his powers seem to be leaving him.  He still loves Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), but all he can envision is a life where his enemies would threaten her life and he has to endure seeing her picture on billboards and posters all over New York City.  It becomes clear that our hero is coming to a cross-roads in his life, but we have no idea what will be the final straw, as it could be anything from the bank foreclosing on the house of Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) or Dr. Curt Connors (Dylan Baker) flunking him to J. Jonah Jameson (J.K. Simmons) really firing him from the &quot;Daily Bugle&quot; to Mary Jane ending up with some other guy (Daniel Gillies).<p>What made Spider-Man endearing was that he was the victim of such bad luck.  With power comes great responsibility but you would think a guy could catch a break now and then.  There is a point where a bruised Peter tries to make his way home and as he reaches out to steady himself against a parked car you KNOW that as soon as he touches it a car alarm goes off.  Spider-Man endures a lot of slings and arrows in this film (e.g., Aunt May never told him how to do laundry) and all the while the gods just look down and laugh.  <p>The Green Goblin was something of the ultimate villain for Spider-Man because he was the one who learned the web-slinger's secret identity.  But the consensus of my students each semester is that Doctor Octopus is the best Spider-Man villain.  Dr. Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina) intends to make nuclear fusion work and is employed by Harry Osborn (James Franco), who dreams of making a fortune during the day and of killing Spider-Man to avenge his father at night.  Of course things go horribly wrong, and the four metal tentacles that Octavius has created are now fused to his body and have driven him insane.  <p>We have all seen the trailer for &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot; and the scene where Doc Ock interupts a potentially tender moment between Peter and Mary Jane by throwing a car through a window at them.  This must happen over an hour into the film but it starts off a series of fantastic computer generated fights between the hero and the villain.  The reason for this and why the pairing is so perfect is that Spider-Man and Doctor Octopus can both fight on the vertical axis as well as the horizontal.  These two go at each other on the side of buildings and falling through the air as well as on top, on the sides, and through the middle of a subway train.  Then you throw into the mix that Doc Ock can be carrying off someone Peter loves and still have three mechanical arms pounding away at Spider-Man.  More importantly, when Spider-Man travels around by his webbing in this film it no longer looks like something we would expect from a Saturday morning cartoon.  <p>But the conflict between Spider-Man and Doctor Octopus is only one of a half dozen that provide the interpersonal web of problems closing in on Peter and the way they all fit together gives &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot; a weight hitherto unsuspected in superhero movies.  This point is best evidence by the fact that Aunt May is major supporting character in the film just as she is in the comic book.  There were always two women in Peter Parker's life and the one constant was always Aunt May.  <p>I applaud the decision to make Otto Octavius a good man for once who becomes the victim of his own brilliance.  His scientific discussions with Peter in their first meeting not only show his decency but also reveal to our hero the path he can take if he pursues science rather than crime fighting.  After all, Otto is married to the lovely Rosalie (Donna Murphy), who is clearly the doctor's own MJ.  Eventually Peter comes to the realization that he does not have to be Spider-Man.<p>I have some ambivalence about what is happening with Mary Jane, mainly because one of my favorite scenes in the comic book was when she finally confessed to a stunned Peter that she knew he was Spider-Man and could no longer stand the fear that he was going to get killed.  But I appreciate the idea that Mary Jane gets to be there from the beginning in the movies (as she is in Marvel's &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot;) and that Hollywood does not have time to go through Betty Brant and Gwen Stacy to get to Mary Jane Watson Parker and the final shot of Mary Jane in the film certainly gives weight to her character and reinforces again the idea that this time they got everything right.</p></br><a href="../users/A29R4FCO6RFX4K.html">A29R4FCO6RFX4K</a><br/><p>SEQUELS ARE NEVER AS GOOD AS THE ORIGINAL. Or so they say. But every know and then, surprisingly impressive part 2 comes along and wows audiences, scoops box-office success and critical acclaim. SUPERMAN, BATMAN and X-MEN et all have superior sequels. SPIDER-MAN 2 is no exception. A more fleshed-out story, deeper emotion and most importantly, fast-paced action (The train scene is incredible) work to fantastic effect. Director Sam Raimi has not only created a fantastic piece of action cinema, but also cemented the idea that sequels can outshine their lofty parents.<p>Returning to New York two years after the last one left off, SPIDER-MAN 2 sees Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) strain under the pressure of trying to balance a romance with Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst), his job at the Daily Bugle, college, fighting crime and trying to retain a sense of normality. And after a scientific accident, face off against Doc Ock, which provides for some fantastic action.<br />Maguire and Dunst show real chemistry and great angst as the tow troubled friends, however Alfred Molina's Dr.Otto Octavius is absolutely brilliant, and the computer-generated interaction with live action elements is seamless. Themes of friendship and self-sacrifice are well-written, and despite the genre, the story is firmly set in reality, paving the way for much easier writing, and thankfully, no cheese.<br />Some shaky dialogue and fairly heavy exposition didn't matter much in the first movie, and here-What can I say? An absolutely magnificent masterpiece that deserves all the box -office success and critical praise it is currently receiving. <p>I knew straight away after watching the previews that under Rami's steady hand, and having as much experience as you could possibly have with the comic-book ideas, that this would be something special. Much akin to Brian Singer's X-MEN 2, second time around a strong layer of confidence is evident, eschewing the fairly everyday filmmaking of Part 1 in favor of an experimental and kinetic style.<br />Much praise must go to those CGI effects boffins who sure had an immense job on their hands. The CG Spider-Man is a vast improvement. However given Raimi's track record for a fantastic storytelling style, it must be a gift to collaborate with people who understand the language of film so fluently. Danny Elfman's visceral score adds so much to the film's tone. Doc Ock's theme is an outstanding achievement, building on it's earlier subtle strings, slowly working up to a full-bore orchestra, amping up the film's biggest action set-pieces.<br />If the first SPIDER-MAN was set-up, this is the payoff. However by the end credits, we all know we'll be eagerly-awaiting round 3. I can't wait...</p></br><a href="../users/A34IBXM7E8CPWE.html">A34IBXM7E8CPWE</a><br/><p>I have to say that I thought the first Spideman was okay, and I am still surprised at how popular it was. So when I heard about the sequel, I didn't plan on going out of my way to see it. I was never into comic books, and am not really a fan of Superhero stories to begin with. Well, with all the hype and merchandising going on Spiderman 2 caught the attention of my son. He wanted to go so badly, I just couldn't say no. I have to say that I was extremely surprised at how good this movie is. The blend of action, humor and drama is fantastic! The special effects are amazing, and Doctor Octopus should go down as one of Hollywood's greatest villains! Even if you aren't a fan of Superhero movies, there is just too much to enjoy with this film to pass it over. The acting is top-notch and the high flying action will keep you glued to the edge of your seat! I can't say enough about Tobey Maguire. His portrayal of Peter Parker is great. You completely buy him as an average kid who gets caught up in extraordinary circumstances. You actually feel sympathy for this kid who has maybe taken too big a bite of something to swallow, all while rooting for him to start slinging some web. I also recommend seeing Spideman 2 in the theaters, because alot will be lost when it moves to the small screen. If you have been hesitant going to the theater because of the usual hype surrounding "summer blockbusters" which usually fall flat, don't be. Spiderman 2 actually lives up to or surpasses the hype. I will surely be in line when part 3 opens.</p></br><a href="../users/A28ILXH590CMRJ.html">A28ILXH590CMRJ</a><br/><p>After the blockbusting success of SPIDER-MAN 2, it was pretty obvious that director Sam Raimi and company would eventually revisit the world of the nerdy photographer Peter Parker and his arachnid alter-ego. The resulting film is not only spectacular, but tops the original in almost every way.  Picking up two years from the events of the original film, Parker finds himself struggling to balance both his personal and super-hero lives without much success.  He loses his pizza delivery job despite using his web-swinging powers for some super fast transit.  He?s unable to prevent his beloved Aunt May from losing the family home.  And perhaps most heart-breaking of all, he alienates himself from everyone, especially the girl he loves, by seemingly never being anywhere on time.  (The fact that he?s late due to the need for his super heroic services doesn?t help matters.)  When his powers start to fade on him, our hero makes the decision to give up being Spider-Man.  Unfortunately, the best laid plans of man and spider go awry as a new super-villain named Doc Ock threatens New York with possible nuclear destruction.<br /><br />Just as before, Sam Raimi directs the whole thing with a keen and sure hand.  In fact, he seems to display more confidence as he effortlessly blends the film?s small and personable moments with the top notch CGI action scenes. Indeed, the entire cast seems more assured.  Tobey Maguire again proves that he was born to play the title role with his doe-eyed Peter Parker tugging at our heartstrings, even as we cheer his super heroics.  Kirsten Dunst matches him as Mary Jane, the girl he secretly loves.  J.K. Simmons again hams it up delightfully as J. Jonah Jameson, Peter?s bombastic newspaper boss.  Rosemary Harris gets a bit more to do as the always caring Aunt May.  However, it is the villainy of Alfred Molina?s Doc Ock that pushes this film up a notch.  Portrayed as a basically decent, if somewhat egotistical, scientist, Molina engages both our sympathies and our fears as his character is taken over by the mechanical tentacles that he wears.  It definitely is an improvement on the bombastic Green Goblin of the first film.  (In all fairness, Willem Dafoe, who reprises the role in a cameo, was handicapped by a costume that seemed to belong on a Power Rangers episode.)<br /><br />All in all, SPIDER-MAN 2 grabs your attention from the very first frame to the last.  It?s character and heart matches the large scale action to make a superhero film that is rarely seen these days.  It?s a perfect follow-up to the first film and a movie that gets one of my highest recommendations.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y.html">A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y</a><br/><p>A little Better than the First, Alot Better than Part 3 that's for sure. Good Movie, Although I can't get over why this guy plays Spider-Man/Peter Parker. Good Spidey Flick and great to watch along with Part 1.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>The action is always simple and direct : save the victims of the bad guy. The method is always the same: stop the bad guy's mechanics by throwing a few strings in its gears. The rest of it is building up a network, in that case a cobweb. But this is a film, not an electronic game and we are at the cinema not in front of a game console. So the film adds a good layer of sentimental events and feelings. The girl friend from far behind. She is afraid and fascinated. She is jealous and possessive. She is maybe adult and open-minded. That kind of stuff gives to the film some interesting dimension. In the same way, in this film in particular, the super hero loses and even chooses to lose his powers, for a while at least. This whole dimension of a normal guy, a normal boy capable of normal feelings and cowardice is exploited here to reveal the other super-hero dimension is both a choice and a responsibility, a responsible choice and a chosen responsibility. Then the film can work as a film and not a dumb computer game. Then the bad guy has a new dimension. He is the self-victimized inventor of a machine that will destroy the world. But keep in mind that the solution to sink that nuclear fusion machine in order to kill it is rather primitive in intellectual value. But it is full of emotional pulpy strength. The fear of nuclear power is also typical of the beginning of this century when the oil companies were still the masters of the energetic game. We have since then entered the final stage of that oil dominance and we have to consider other solutions, particularly that do not produce carbon dioxide. It is also a reflection of a way of thinking in these 2002-2006 years: nuclear energy was only seen from the American point of view as basically criminal either in the hands of criminal individuals (that's the case here) or in the hands of criminal states. Luckily this dimension  is aging pretty fast.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines, CEGID</p></br><a href="../users/A38ZTUNQJVGP6S.html">A38ZTUNQJVGP6S</a><br/><p>This movie is 2 hour and 7 minutes long and better then the original. What makes it better is there is more action and roll along at a good pace. With the origin of how Spiderman came to be out of the way, the movie kicks right in. Peter Parker has put his social life on hold and has taken to crime fighting fulltime; which puts a damper on his college studies and work life. Now there is a new villian, Doc Ock. He has four mechanical arms. So I guess if you add his own arm and legs gives reason to an octopus; which has eight tentacles. This is a great movie all around.</p></br><a href="../users/A356RFKNIG043B.html">A356RFKNIG043B</a><br/><p>Pretty solid. I grew up reading Spidey comics in the late 60s/early 70s and I think Tobey really hits Parker nicely. J Jonah Jameson is also perfectly done. Not so happy with Mary Jane; she's too wimpy here, while a real tiger in the original comics.<br />But, this is a movie with its own agenda, and it fulfills that well. Good job on making Doc Ock believable; Molina is solid.<br />All in all, worth watching for pure comic book-style fun.</p></br><a href="../users/A3V5DUZ5KXPGQA.html">A3V5DUZ5KXPGQA</a><br/><p>Let me say right off the bat that Spider-Man 2 was a great film the way it was!<br /><br />While Spider-Man 2.1 didn't damage its original predecessor, it didn't add much to it either. Of the new scenes, the only ones that were significant in my view is where Mary Jane Watson discusses her impending marriage to John Jameson with a girlfriend and the added footage of the fights between Spidey and Dr. Octopus, especially on the train! The others were okay BUT weren't really missed.<br /><br />Overall, I still enjoy the new version nonetheless. Worth the money but I'd find it at a lower price than what's there right now.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ARJ16772TKHT.html">A3ARJ16772TKHT</a><br/><p>Coming on the heels of a success like Spider-Man, it is sometimes hard to avoid a 'sophomore slump'. The temptation to make a 'different' movie sometimes leads them down wrong paths. Not so here. The followup feels very much cut from the same cloth of the first movie, but with more of a direct threat and momentum to the movie.<br /><br />In the first movie, the Goblin was bad, yes. But his actions had little to no pattern or goal to them (except disintegrating the board members of course). He was simply out to either hurt or turn Spider-man. It worked well enough for the movie, and since the Goblin was basically a man unhinged anyways. However, in comes Doc Oc.<br /><br />After a lab accident leaves him with four new appendages and the belief that Spider-man had ruined the attempt, he sets out to complete his life's work and rid himself of the one he blames his failure on. The fact is, if his experiment is completed, it could destroy the entire city, which gives real threat to the villain this time.<br /><br />The drama plays out well enough, but it's the action sequences you wait for. You are not disappointed on that front here. The fight sequences are intricate, large and fast-paced.<br /><br />In the end, it can be a matter of personal opinion as to which of the two movies you consider superior. For my part, my ballot is cast in favor of the 'sophomore success.'</p></br><a href="../users/A31ARSC1LGY8WK.html">A31ARSC1LGY8WK</a><br/><p>"Spiderman 2" is the best film in the Spiderman series.

It was decent, but still not good enough.</p></br><a href="../users/A3N8RZSXKN1OR2.html">A3N8RZSXKN1OR2</a><br/><p>This is the winter (or perhaps the autumn) of Peter Parker's discontent.  Two years after receiving his spider-powers, his life seems to be falling into chaos.  He's devoting so much time to fighting crime as Spiderman that his part-time job (from which he's fired in the first 15 minutes of the movie) and his college career are floundering.  For reasons unclear, he's no longer rooming with his buddy Harry Osborn, who has assumed the chieftainship at Oscorp; instead he's living in a poky one-room apartment in a shabby old brick building--and he's in arrears.  His beloved Mary Jane Watson, who's made it as a model and on Broadway, is mad at him because he hasn't come to see her in "The Importance of Being Earnest."  And he's discovered that his Aunt May's house, where he grew up, is being foreclosed on.  Then he finds that his webbing isn't always shooting when he calls on it, and he can't always stick to the walls he tries to crawl.  A doctor pronounces him healthy--physically.  What's a floundering Spiderman to do?<br /><br />To makes matter worse, a new villain has arisen in New York--Dr. Otto Octavius, a physicist who, in trying to originate a working fusion process for Oscorp, is transformed into the terrifying Dr. Octopus.  Peter's first battle with him is nearly fatal, though he does contrive to rescue his endangered aunt.  Shaken, he begins to doubt his calling.  In the end, his solution is to "hang it up"--or rather, to dump his costume in the garbage (it ends up mounted on Jonah Jameson's office wall).  But there's no rest for a hero.  Gradually, with Aunt May's unwitting help, he realizes that his Uncle Ben was right: great powers require great responsibility, and he'll "always be Spiderman."<br /><br />Besides the continuing angst that is a Marvel trademark, this film is distinguished (of course) by eye-popping SFX--perhaps not *quite* so good as those in the first installment (when Doc Ock climbs up a wall, you can tell it's a computer animation), but still very impressive.  Especially noteworthy: Spidey's battles with Octopus and a thrilling sequence in which he barely manages to stop a runaway el-train (the fact that Manhattan doesn't have any of these any more is beside the point) with his webbing and nearly tears himself apart in the process.  (The following scene, in which the rescued passengers gently and carefully draw him into the car and to safety, is all the more affecting on account of the contrast.)  And Doc and his sentient robot arms, when seen at "eye-level," are definitely among the better film villains on DVD.  Both Spidey and Ock are human-scale despite their powers, capable of doubt and, in the latter's case, reformation.  And there's a great surprise at the end of the film that makes all of Spidey's trials worthwhile.  In the final scene we see him (urged by Mary Jane to "Go get 'em, tiger") once again swinging through the skyscrapers toward another crisis, whooping joyously, with two NYPD choppers close behind him--a sort of symbolic suggestion of the possibility that he and the forces of law and order may finally be coming to an accommodation despite Jameson's ongoing (and, at one point, rather hypocritical) efforts to demonize him.  Though probably not for the youngest and most sensitive members of the family, this is a great wild adventure ride for everyone else, and may well serve as a launching point for some good conversations about ethics, perseverance, and the definition of heroism.</p></br><a href="../users/A13OMT8D4GPIBV.html">A13OMT8D4GPIBV</a><br/><p>Spider-Man 2 is one of the best sequels ever and the best superhero movies ever.

However, he blames Spiderman for the death of his father (AKA the Green Goblin). He'll do anything to avenge his father, and that includes making a deal with Dr. Octopus.<br /><br />That, and several other excellent subplots help make Spiderman 2 the best screen adaptation of a comic book series. I argue that it is better than best-of-show in a genre, and can be placed in the echelons of great movies overall.<br /><br />Although incredible effects help create a real Spiderman, the movie excels because of the humanity of Peter Parker.<br /><br />Peter is in love, but isn't willing to tell Mary Jane. He uses Spiderman as his excuse even though it is old fashioned fear of commitment and rejection that are at play. Any teenager or young 20s man has felt that angst, and so we relate to Peter.<br /><br />Peter loves his Aunt May and the late Uncle Ben, and feels heavy guilt for Uncle Ben's death. It was Peter, after all, who let the thief who later killed Ben escape. The relationship between Aunt May and Peter is like a grandmother and grandchild, and is believable.<br /><br />Mr. Jameson is the least believable character, and the most caricatured. Snapping quickly at any opportunity to malign Spiderman's reputation, he acknowledges that Spidey's apparent retirement causes an increase in the crime rate.<br /><br />The Plot:<br /><br />Peter tries to set aside his Spiderman persona to forge a real life. Too often, he found Spidey interfering with his ability to keep his word, to be on time, keep his grades up, to earn money and to keep and grow relationships.<br /><br />After soul-searching, he quits, and tries a post-Spidey lifestyle. He watches as police rush by a few times. When Peter saves a baby in a burning building without the assistance of super powers, only to learn someone remained in the building and died, he knows he could've done something.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Harry Oswald introduces Peter to his hero, physicist Dr. Octavius. Dr. Octavius is working on a project that can revolutionize and resolve the world's energy problem. During a demonstration, the experiment goes awry. Spiderman launches into action, and saves the day. Unfortunately, Dr. Octavius's beloved wife dies in an explosion, and the Dr. himself finds that the robotic arms he used to help with the experiment have fused to his nervous system.<br /><br />Raging against Spiderman for, as he believes, killing his wife, Dr. Octavius seeks revenge. Concurrently, he tries to rebuild the dangerous experiment. He needs rare materials, and deals with Harry, who also wants revenge. If Dr. Octavius captures Spiderman, Harry will give him the material.<br /><br />When Harry pulls out a dagger, ready to kill the bound up Spiderman, he pulls off the mask, and everything changes. How can his best friend be Spiderman?<br /><br />All of the while, Peter is trying to make ends meet. The cantankerous Mr. Jameson hires Peter to photograph a social event involving John, his son, a famous astronaut.<br /><br />It turns out that John is seeing Mary Jane, and becomes engaged to her. Peter's heart sinks, and he tries to talk her out of it and back into a relationship with him. MJ counters that she and Peter have no relationship to return to. It is over, and Peter knows it.<br /><br />When Dr. Octavius kidnaps MJ, and tells Peter to tell Spidey to meet him, Peter must decide if Spiderman must exist to save MJ, the world, but in doing so, lose MJ's heart.<br /><br />What will Peter choose? The love of a woman, or her life? It is an impossible choice, and replete with danger either way.<br /><br />The transition between comic book and movie screen has never been as smooth. Ang Lee's "Hulk," had no depth, just as Christopher Reeve's "Superman." Fun? Yes, but neither were great movies. "Spiderman 2" is a great movie.<br /><br />We forget who are the actors. Kirsten Dunst as girl-next-door Mary Jane Watson is fantastic, being beautiful and ordinary simultaneously. Rosemary Harris looks as much as like Aunt May as anyone could. Finally, Tobey Maguire is so perfectly cast as Peter Parker, that all is seamless.<br /><br />I fully recommend Spiderman 2. I'm ready for "Spiderman 3," and hope the producers realize that there is enough good Spiderman material to make another five movies as good as this.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br /><br />editor, HungarianBookstore.com</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>To quote the tagline from the first `Spider-Man' film, "With great power comes great responsibility", and in this case that is very true.  After the sheer brilliance that was `Spider-Man', Sam Raimi, Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst had a great responsibility to make at least an equally impressive film.  Well, if you've been privileged to have seen `Spider-Man 2' (yes I did say `privileged') then you know that they succeeded in delivering a top-notch sequel!  Giving us sharper graphics, deeper story lines and excellent acting, `Spider-Man 2' is utterly fantastic.<br /><br />With the origin of Spider-Man out of the way, the second chapter has more time to explore how Peter Parker (Maguire) will deal with his new `responsibilities', including whether or not he should pursue a relationship with Mary Jane (Dunst) or stay alone in order to protect the ones he loves.  His decision is almost solidified by the appearance of the evil Doctor Octopus (Alfred Molina).  Once a great physicist, Otto Octavius was transformed into the monster known as Doctor Octopus after an experiment went haywire.<br /><br />Not only does Peter have this new atrocity to contend with, but his very best friend Harry (Franco) is bent on avenging his father's death at the hands of Spider-Man, and thus is determined to hunt him down and kill him.  When the very lives of his love ones are put in jepordy because of his newfound powers Peter is troubled with where to turn, and what to do.  Should he continue to fight the crime plaguing the streets or should he hang it up for good to protect those around him?<br /><br />`Spider-Man 2' serves as top-notch entertainment, ready and willing to please any who watch it.  I really don't see a down side, and with `Spider-Man 3' on the horizon there is sure to be plenty more to praise and look forward to as another chapter is unfolded.  Here's to hoping Sam and company can keep this up!</p></br><a href="../users/A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL.html">A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL</a><br/><p>"Spiderman 2" makes "Spiderman" seem like a warm-up.  Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) and his alter-ego, Spiderman, have enough problems to make the movie continually interesting.  The melodrama envelops our attention, and the action scenes are marvelous.<br /><br />In the beginning Peter Parker sets his sights on Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), but he's conflicted by his role as Spiderman.  He not only juggles his identities, but his responsibilities as well.  As college student and breadwinner, he stumbles with all of his relationships, including with his aunt and his best friend.  Ironically, this friend has connections with a scientist who can be the key to Peter's success.  When the scientist presents an innovative energy invention, his demonstration goes awry.  It turns the scientist into a monster, Dr. Oct., with barely a will of his own.<br /><br />"Spiderman 2" is a substantial movie because, unlike similar superhero movies, we remain interested and are often at the edge of our seats.  Frequently many hero figures vanquish their opponents too early or too often, but Spiderman has many problems and an incredible adversary.  In the story, the chemistry between Peter and Mary Jane is likable, and Dr. Oct. is certainly menacing enough.  The supporting roles are effective, too.  The portrayal of Peter's Aunt is endearing, and his newspaper editor boss provides an entertaining caricature.  His relationship with his friend provides good connections and variety to the plot.  Screenwriter Alvin Sargent (who won an Oscar for "Ordinary People") gives the screenplay the right touches, and director Sam Raimi is an expert for leading us along this great adventure.  "Spiderman 2" has the look and feel of a flawless comic book hero classic.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NLZVP501JM5Z.html">A1NLZVP501JM5Z</a><br/><p>After seeing the first Spiderman I thought there was no way the sequel could be as good.  After seeing the second one I realize I was wrong.  Alfred Molina's performance is great, as are all of the other actors.  Sam Raimi once again has made an amazing movie,  instead of not expanding the characters and focusing on all action he focuses on the characters and makes great action scenes.  Imagine if the series keeps getting better.  Spiderman 6 should be the best movie ever made.  Somehow though this is better than the first one.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MG8DHACXH5MS.html">A2MG8DHACXH5MS</a><br/><p>I'm just glad that she didn't walk to an altar with the wrong guy! MJ finally speaks what has been obvious all along: I've always been next door Peter. Ironic that the Superhero who fights to rescue everyone fails to fight for MJ. She has to do it!</p></br><a href="../users/A1VCLTAGM5RLND.html">A1VCLTAGM5RLND</a><br/><p>This movie is hot. Dr. Octopus has four machine arms that has controled him cause of his science project it has something to do with him having the power of the sun he wants to fulfilled his dream again by stealing some money at the bank spider man was their it was an amazing fight. Behind the sceens you see they did their best not to hurt the old woman while she was flying cause Dr. Octopus grab her and was climbing on the building. This movie had too many women screeming it was getting annoying to me. It look almost real when Peter Parker tryed to jump across a building but he fell all the way down and fell on cars hitting them and hit the concreat really it's just special effects.</p></br><a href="../users/A457S8SW690NM.html">A457S8SW690NM</a><br/><p>This movie outshines its brilliant predecessor by a mile with better fight scenes, a great plot, and some good laughs.<br /><br />In this one, Peter Parker keeps on living a double life but it's costing him. Mary Jane's mad at him, he get fired from a job, his grades are taking a plunge for the worst and he has a new nemesis in Dr. Octopus after a brilliant scientist's experiment goes terribly wrong. That's a lot of stuff that our superhero's got to deal with. does he care more about Mary Jane and his school work or does he care more about the safety of New York? Find out. He also has a problem with his once best friend Harry Osborne, who is mad at Peter because Spiderman killed his dad. The movie has a fair share of luaghs, some awesome and memorable fights and good acting by Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst and Alfed Molina. If you haven't seen this movie yet, you're missing out on the best superhero movie EVER!</p></br><a href="../users/A1FZA9C5MVIWHE.html">A1FZA9C5MVIWHE</a><br/><p>Spider-Man 2 is better than ever and this time the villan has four mechanical arms. Dr. Otto Octavious is a normal man until his experiment goes wrong, kills his wife, and welds the the intelligent arms to his body and he has to go through a tug-of-war of who controls what because the inhibitor chip gets broken. he then becomes Doc Ock and fights Spidey until almost the very end of the movie where he decides to sacrifice himself and his creation. at the end, the hero gets the girl.</p></br><a href="../users/A23QOAXJSWIBS6.html">A23QOAXJSWIBS6</a><br/><p>I'm pleased to find another movie franchise that is able to sustain itself (unlike the Matrix or Star Wars).<br /><br />This second (of multiple?) installment is darker than the first. Spidey is full of angst and is broke. What's the last time you saw a super-hero who couldn't pay his bills?<br /><br />The FX are flawless and Elfman's score is great as always.<br /><br />What we find here is solid character development and plot complications. I'm surpised at the choices made seeming so "early" in the franchise (unless this is just a trilogy). Unmasking Peter Parker took me by surprise.<br /><br />A few points to pick -- I think the film did lose some momentum with the sporadic talkiness and I wished that the revelation to MJ would have taken a bit longer with more suspense. But these rough spots don't damage the vehicle as a whole.<br /><br />I was excited by the characters' interaction and the general plot arch. I'm no Spiderman authority (I'd have to consult my Foushee guide for plot points, but I've sadly lost that guide), but I think it is a solid second chapter in the story.<br /><br />****</p></br><a href="../users/A2PNTEDGMOLMOY.html">A2PNTEDGMOLMOY</a><br/><p>"Spider Man 2" is probably a good reminder that I should not read movie reviews before checking out a flick.  Roger Ebert, as I recall, has dubbed "SM2" the best comic-book movie adaption ever made.  Perhaps I was suffering under these high expectations, but I found "SM2" to be a rather pedestrian, "safe" story with weak characters . . . and colossal special effects that almost, but not quite, save the day.<br /><br />"SM2" opens with an imaginative comic-book montage that relates the key moments from the first movie.  As the movie opens, Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is struggling mightily to keep his life afloat.  No Bruce Wayne (heir to multi-gazillion dollar Wayne Enterprises), Parker is struggling to make it as a pizza delivery boy, closet superhero, and college student.  He does the superhero thing well, the college student thing poorly (a "genius, but lazy"), and gets fired as a delivery boy.<br /><br />He's also struggling with his romance with Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) . . . if romance it can be called.  Mary Jane, now a successful actress, still carries a torch for Parker and suspects that he is Spider Man, but is turned off by Parker's perpetual demonstrations of indifference.  Of course, we know that Parker is "protecting" her by refusing to acknowledge his love for her . . . the scenes of tortured blighted romance between these two don't quite work, as the depression gets weighty (and on several occasions MJ looks sleepy rather than sad).<br /><br />Doc Ock (Alfred Molina) almost steals the show as the tortured genius scientist.  The Spider Man series appears to thrive on tragic villains . . . both the Green Goblin of the first movie and Doc Ock are ambitious-yet-decent men who get corrupted (or trapped, depending on your perspective) by the results of their ambitions.  Maybe it says something about me, but I prefer my villains to be straight villains, a la the Joker from "Batman."  Still, Molina offers several touching scenes and gives the best performance in the movie.<br /><br />Much of the movie is given over to Parker's various struggles with his identity.  These are interesting, but begin to flag as every single aspect of Peter's life falls apart, and there is even a relatively unexplained faltering of Parker's spidey-powers which is apparently connected to Parker's psychic struggles.  Sure, it's great to have a "human" superhero, but this note gets hit a little too often in this movie.<br /><br />The action scenes are fantastic, and are much improved over the first film, which had a slightly cartoonish air to it.  There are several scenes to marvel at, and make the movie worth seeing all on their own.<br /><br />Director Raimi continues one unfortunate trend from the first movie.  Both films are pretty family-friendly -- while there is some violence, it is not very bloody at all, there is virtually no profanity, and the romance does not get beyond a few kisses.  But both films go to great lengths to include shots of voluptuous women in clingy clothing . . . and this is just jarring.  In the first film, we were treated to an inexplicable "hello, nurse!" shot of the lovely Ms. Dunst.  We get more of this in "SM2" -- the worst example coming when a character swoops down over an amazed crowd, and two women gasp in astonishment, mighty bosoms heaving mightily.  Since this was obviously a shot involving great special effects, this is not an accident.  I ask -- why?  I understand that films want to avoid being too saccharine so as to be "uncool," but these cheap scenes aren't the way to go about it.<br /><br />A special effects bonanza and a decent story (as well as its other dubious "features" make "Spider Man 2" a perfect film for boys aged 10-15.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EMDSTJDUE6B0.html">A1EMDSTJDUE6B0</a><br/><p>This was decent. It got into the character some more, but the plot was fairly predictable. The graphics were pretty good and the acting was okay. Would recommend only if you had seen the first one and want to see the sequal.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KY68OTSNHM3G.html">A3KY68OTSNHM3G</a><br/><p>Spiderman is back and better than ever in this highly-charged, thrilling sequel to the original.  Tobey Maguire reprises his role as Peter Parker and the web-slinging superhero.  A normal, but somewhat geeky college student, Parker springs into action as Spiderman at the first sign of danger. Kirsten Dunst is back as Mary Jane Watson.  At the end of Spidey one, Mary Jane and Peter told each other that they were in love, but Peter said that he could never be with Mary Jane.  She is now a highly successful Broadway actress who has fallen in love with an astronaut who happens to be the son of J. Jonah Jameson, the editor of the Daily Bugle.  James Franco stars as Harry Osborn.  He has taken over contol of his father's business after his death in the first movie.  (His father was the Green Goblin in Spidey 1).  Harry blames his father's death on Spiderman and vows to avenge his father by destroying Spiderman.  His company has developed a way to improve the fusion process, and with the cooperation of Dr. Otto Octavius, played by Alfred Molina, they have developed a strange set of titanium tentacles that can be controlled by the brain of the person wearing them.<br /><br />However, something goes terribly wrong during a demonstration, and Dr. Octavius is forever changed as a result.  Somehow, the arms seem to have taken control of Dr. Octavius, and he is now under their power.  Determined to complete his research, Dr. Octavius turns to crime and becomes known as Doc Ock, due to his similarity to an octupus.<br /><br />Soon, Doc Ock and Spiderman are fighting it out, waging battles in banks and on top of speeding commuter trains.  Ock realizes that he needs money to complete his research, so he visits Harry and makes a deal; Ock will kill Spiderman and Harry's company will give Ock the funding he needs to finish his research.<br /><br />Will Ock succed in his devious plan to finish his fusion research and possibly destroy New York City in the process?  Will Spiderman stop him before its too late?  Will Peter and Mary Jane get together?  Will Harry succeed in his bid to destroy Spiderman?<br /><br />I thought Spidey 2 was much better than the original.  The actors, especially Alfred Molina, give excellent performances, and the action and thrills are non-stop.  The ending of the movie is left wide-open for a possible Spidey 3.  I highly recommend this fun and action-packed movie.  Watch closely and keep an eye out for your friendly neighborhood Spiderman.</p></br><a href="../users/A33IZJVCKFKDPU.html">A33IZJVCKFKDPU</a><br/><p>When "Spider-Man" was released in 2002, I was amazed to see how good of a movie that Sam Raimi and writer David Koepp created about a comic book super hero.  Sony announced after seeing the huge box office sales that "Spider-Man 2" was set to release in 2004.  I was excited to hear that there would be more Spider-Man, but was also concerned.  My thought was that the first movie was so good that if the second one was a little less in quality, meaning its still a great movie but not as good as the first, that people will be disappointed and say that the movie sucks.  Well after seeing the movie, I don't have to worry about that anymore.<p>The story continues two years from where the first one stopped.  Peter Parker is trying to balance school, work and a personal life, along with being Spider-Man.  He is always tired, not doing well in school, never able to fulfill committments and still chasing after Mary Jane, who is now a success stage actress.  Peter is doing a paper on Professor Otto Octavious and his new science experiment.  But when his experiment goes wrong, Octavious' wife gets killed and he is now controlled by the robotic arms that he attached to his body in order to do the experiment.  The robotic arms make him evil and convince him that he needs to rebuild his project that has the capability to destroy haf of New York.  So he goes on a crime streak to get some money, hence becoming enemies with Spider-Man.  Peter Parker is becoming frustrated with his crime fighting life, especially after he finds out MJ is engaged.  He decides that he doesn't want to be Spider-Man anymore and soon enough realizes that can't escape his destiny.  Thats enough story without giving too much away.<p>The main players from the first movie are back in this one.  Tobey Maguire gives an amazing performance is this installment, a better performance than the first.  Thank God that he was able to make this movie.  Kirsten Dunst, James Franco and Rosemarry Harris also return for this movie.  The new memeber Alfred Molina plays Doc Ock and does a pretty good job.  I don't think he gave as good of a performance as Willem DaFoe did, but still an excellent job.  The most important person that came back for the sequel was Sam Raimi.  Most movies that have continuing storylines get bad if they lose the director, i.e. Batman without Tim Burton.  The direction of this movie, along with the first one, are what make the movies great.<p>As for the movie, this one has a more indepth storyline.  There is a lot of human emotion involved in the storyline.  I like the bad guy, Doc Ock.  He was my favorite bad guy in the comic books and the effects that were used and his creation to the big screen was awesome.  The action scenes were better in this movie and the special effects were a lot better.  My only grievence with the movie is that it moved slower than the first.  Too many long Aunt May scenes that really slowed down the pace of the movie.  Otherwise this movie is excellent.  Is it better than the first?  I would say that it has some better parts, but also some worse parts.  Its really too hard to choose which one is better.  I guess you'll have to go watch the movie, which I highly recommend that you do, to decide for yourself.</p></br><a href="../users/AW99SBGWEXP0J.html">AW99SBGWEXP0J</a><br/><p>"Spider-Man 2" is easily the best comic book movie in the last decade, and possibly the best ever.  Combining a great hero and villain with a great story and amazing special effects, "Spider-Man 2" is a great movie, period.  It picks up a few years after the original, with Peter Parker (Maguire) still pining after the girl he will never let himself have, Mary Jane Watson (Dunst).  He is fighting internally between what he wants and what he feels he should do, and not seeing a way to have both.  His friend Harry Osborn (Franco) is getting steadily more and more bitter with him because he will not give up Spider-man, the person who killed his father.  Add to that the fact that he is juggling so many other things in his personal life, and you have a pretty miserable Peter Parker.  When is powers start to fail him, he decides to be Spider-Man no more.<p>As all this is happening, Doctor Otto Octavius (Molina) is perfecting a fusion process for OsCorp that will be a great advance in the field.  An accident fuses four mechanical arms to his spine and sends him on a course of destruction that can only be stopped by Spider-Man.<p>Working from a story by "Smallville"'s Miles Millar and Alfred Gough, and Pulitzer-prize winning author Michael Chabon, Sam Raimi has crafted a sequel that far outshines its solid predecessor.  Maguire has made Peter Parker his own, and Alfred Molina breathes intelligent menace into Doc Ock.  The special effects, especially during the fight scenes, and incredible.  These are easily some of the best fight scenes ever put on film.  This is a movie that can be enjoyed by anyone...the perfect summer blockbuster.<p>And finally, mark your calendars for May 2007, when "Spider-Man 3" will hit theaters.  "2" will be difficult to top, but if Raimi continues to pour his passion for the character into the movies, he will have a good shot.  Bring on "3".</p></br><a href="../users/A2UL0A8GJB4318.html">A2UL0A8GJB4318</a><br/><p>Two years ago, we were all re-introduced to Spiderman, the Superhero with everyday problems that cramp his style as a day-saver.  In the opening munites of "Spiderman 2," the thrilling and deeper sequel to the wide-eyed original, Perter Parker (Tobey Maguire) loses his job, ruins his laundry, gets behind on his rent and finds he is still living in a low-rent apartment with a nosy tenant.  Life sucks, even for a revered Superhero.  All Peter Parker wants to do is finish his college work, meet with one of his idols Dr. Otto Octavious (Alfred Molina) and especially enter into a meaningful engagement with Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), and keep a devastating secret from his best friend, harry Osbourne (James Franco).  But of course, he must always save the world.  Soon however, he must fight Octavious as his demented alter-ego Dr. Octopus comes to the service with a vengence, and Mary Jane gets engaged to someone else.<br /><br />This is ambiguous and heavy stuff, especially for a big-budget summer action flick (and a huge action flick, with a budget of $200 million).  But director Sam Raimi and screenwriter Alvin Sargeant have higher goals.  They stick to the story and tone of the comic books,  giving the film has a sense of integrity and rich charcter development that elevate to the realm of greatness.  The quiet moments have tha same amount of impact has the big ones, but Raimi does not hesitate to pull out all the stops for the action sequences, seamlessly combining CGI, puppetry and Billl Popes' astounding camera work into one adreanalized package.  Spidey's battle with Doc Ock are breathtaking, climaxing in an above-ground train fight that leaves one absolutley brain-boggled.  But more imprtantly, the filmmakers put the focus squarely of the characters and their relationships (good, bad and ugly), "Spiderman 2" achieves nothing short of greatness and longevity, encompassing the best of what comic book films have to offer.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L8HRCM60W0W7.html">A1L8HRCM60W0W7</a><br/><p>As close to perfect as a sequel can be, SM2 covers all its bases with an effortless mix of moods.<br /><br />One minute, some mind-blowing FX are turning your knuckles white with heart-thumping application of digital dolby, then suddenly you see that thrill casually offset by some cheeky humor or some humane spotlight on relationships. None of which ends up too sappy.<br /><br />Barring a stray cheesy moment or two that sneaked in (e.g., the final 5 minutes that slyly burrow a small hole to fit a Part 3 in), I don't have enough praise for this absolutely dazzling summer spectacular for your entire family! A must-watch and when it's out on DVD, a must-own.</p></br><a href="../users/A2M597GCCE1N2S.html">A2M597GCCE1N2S</a><br/><p>Spiderman 2 was a HUGE success. Back when the first movie came out I admit that I did not want to see it. I thought it was rather dumb, but after watching the first movie on DVD I was surprised by how well done it was. So in order to make sure I saw the second movie on the big screen I immediately went out and waited almost two hours to see the second one on the day it came out. And it did not disappoint......<br /><br />This movie picks up where Peter Parker [Tobey McGuire], aka spiderman, is now doing. Although the first movie showed how much fun Parker was having, the second movie goes into detail on how the super powers can take its toll on the young guy. Parker is falling behind in his classes from lack of sleep, his teachers are concerned and want him to do better.<br /><br />Then to add insult to injury his job isn't exactly great also. Some of the opening scenes have him racing to try and get a pizza to a costumer on time, only to be a few minutes late. Can't win them all the time! And probably the biggest pressure is one that gets us all, love. Parker realizes that he is in love with his best friend, Mary Jane [Kirsten Dundst], but cant seem to get it off his chest. One memerable scene is that he tells his friend how much he loves her, only to say it to the dead end of a telephone reciever.<br /><br />Of course this is right on time when an evil villan is about to make his grand entrance. Alfred Molina gives a surprisingly great role as Dr. Octopus, a man with four seemingly invincible metal arms that are attached to his spine after a horrendous accident.  He first doesn't want to be evil, his plan was to get the arms off him. However, something gets inside his head, and he realizes he needs to steal money in order to get the parts for his machine that he needs.<br /><br />Basically that is the main plot, Parker struggles to clear things out of his head, and Dr. Octopus turns to a life of crime. But that isn't all, the son of the Green Goblin, the main villan from the first blockbuster show, wants spiderman dead, for revenge on what spiderman did to his dad. And the ironic twist is that he is also Parker's best buddy, who could have seen that coming?<br /><br />All in all, this is a fantastic movie, dont listen to that idiot who says that the two moives suck, they are anything but bad. The  special effects are brilliant, and it truly is one of the best superhero movie ever made. Lots of intense fight scenes, my favorite one being on the train, and an emotional decision by Dr. Octopus at the end are fantastic.<br /><br />And did I mention the fact that Tobey McGuire gives an absolutely credible performance as the nerd by day Parker, and the awsome spiderman by night? Lots of great and suspensful scenes guarantees that this movie will never get boring, so buy it when it comes out on DVD!</p></br><a href="../users/A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX.html">A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX</a><br/><p>I thought this was a great sequel to the original Spiderman. Here Spidey fights an implaccable foe (aren't all comic-book foes implaccable?) who himself has spiderlike, bionic arms, and sometimes he's more than a match for Spidey himself. As if that weren't bad enough, Spidey develops a confidence problem when his web-making ability inexplicably fails him on several occasions. Now he doesn't know if it'll fail him at a critical moment, and yet he must still stop the obsessed Dr. Octavius and get Mary Jane back.<p>The action sequences are great with terrific special effects, and the romantic relationship between Spiderman and Mary Jane also gets developed much more than in the previous movie. I think the strong characterization and more "intimate" story line, in its concentrating on a few appealing characters, was an important part of the success of the first three Star Wars movies. Lucas got away from that approach in the two recent prequels, concentrating more on the big, epic battle scenes and special effects, and so the two prequels just didn't grab me as much as the earlier movies, or these two Spiderman movies. (And I say that as an old Star Wars fan from way back). So don't miss this great sequel, and let Spidey snare you in another fun-filled and action-packed web of suspense and adventure.</p></br><a href="../users/A1COW0UIB5HA9J.html">A1COW0UIB5HA9J</a><br/><p>2 years after the first movie, Peter Parker (Tobey Mcguire)has never had time for Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) whom has became a model/actress or for class because sometimes there's always crime happening sometimes at the wrong time as he must try to win MJ's heart.  But when his powers suddenly fad he decides to give up being Spider-Man for good, however as Dr. Otto Octavius (Alfred Molan) who has made a robot suit with monstrous tentacles somehow gets involved in a accident that makes the suit attached to him with his mind telepathically controlling it to become Dr. Octopus. Life seems good for Peter ever since he's giving up being Spider-Man and that his powers were gone, as now there's more crime especially involving Dr. Octopus whom has a plan on elimating the city! can Peter Parker's powers return or will the city be doomed?<br /><br />This is a rare sequel that can be better then the original like say "Terminator 2", "Aliens", "Dawn of the Dead", "Godfather II", "Superman 2" or "Empire Strikes Back"! Sam Raimi and company knew what they were accomplishing when they made this fantastic sequel to the instant classic "Spider-Man" but with more emotion, more action, better special effects and some comical moments. J.K. Simmons along with Bruce Campbell, Rosemary Harris and James Franco return as well, the performances are nothing but terrific and it's even more true to the comic book then the original movie.<br /><br />This 2-Disc set has excellent quality sound and picture with awesome extras like a 12-part documentary showing from movie pre-production to the premiere, two featurettes, four web-episode featuettes, music video, trailers, blooper reel, two audio commentaries, trvia-track with pop-up facts, Multi-angel behind the scenes of the climatic pier sequence, art gallery, and weblinks.<br /><br />A must have and must see!</p></br><a href="../users/A20ZFWGBY4REFX.html">A20ZFWGBY4REFX</a><br/><p>The web slinging superhero is back, and better than ever! Superstar Tobey Maguire ("Seabiscuit") returns as the amazing Spider-Man in the summer's most anticipated sequel, "Spider-Man 2"! About a couple of days ago at the theater, I saw what I expected to be not only one of the best summer sequels since last year's mega hit, "X2: X-Men United", but also a sequel that has more thrilling action and more breathtaking visual effects than its 2002 predecessor. And man, I was not disappointed to say the least! The direction of Sam Raimi ("Army of Darkness"), who helmed directing duties for the first blockbuster, has really outdone himself with his intense direction of this action-packed sequel! The performance of Maguire, returning as Peter Parker/Spider-Man, was nothing short of extraordinary! The performance of Alfred Molina ("Not Without My Daughter"), playing the villainous Dr. Octopus ("Doc Ock"), was outstanding! Possibly, this is Molina's best villainous performance since Willem Dafoe's Norman Osborn/Green Goblin performance in the first film! Also returning for "Spider-Man 2" are Kirsten Dunst ("Bring It On"), James Franco ("The Company"), Rosemary Harris ("Sunshine"), and J.K. Simmons ("Hidalgo"), in which they gave flawless performances! Joining the cast are the excellent talents of Donna Murphy ("Star Trek: Insurrection") and Dylan Baker ("Head of State").<br /><br />"Spider-Man 2" takes place 2 years after the events of first film, in which Peter Parker (Maguire), as Spider-Man, defeated the villainous Green Goblin. Things would seem back to normal for Peter, but as the forces of reality take a toll on Peter's everyday life (including declining grades from his college), Peter doesn't seem to have time for anything, including being alienated from his Aunt May (Harris), his best friend Harry Osborn (Franco), who not only has taken over his father's business interests at OsCorp, not only does he still hold a grudge against Spider-Man for the death of his father, Norman Osborn, but is also obsessed with trying to find out the identity of Spider-Man; and trying to declare his love for the beautiful Mary Jane Watson (Dunst). Mary Jane is now a model and actress, still pining for Peter's affections but ready to move on when she gets engaged to NASA astronaut John Jameson (Daniel Gillies), son of the Daily Bugle's sleazy editor, J. Jonah Jameson (Simmons), and Peter feels that he might lose her forever. Peter thinks that his double life as Spider-Man is the reason why his life is in shambles, and he feels that he should be Spider-Man...no more. But the worst is yet to come, though. Dr. Otto Octavius (Molina), a brilliant, renowned scientist working for OsCorp, has developed not only the formula for fusion but also has a set of four mechanical arms that can keep the gravitational pull and outlashings of the fusion in check. These "smart arms" have a mind of their own and are fused to Octavius' spine, but not to worry, because the arms contain a microchip that keeps them from straying from Octavius' will. A freak lab accident happens as the fusion experiment goes horribly awry, which kills his wife Rosalie (Murphy) in the process, and humiliating Harry. The end result of the accident: his four metal tentacles are grafted onto his skin, thus driving him insane with his power as he unleashes his rage against the city of New York as the super-villain, Dr. Octopus (a.k.a. "Doc Ock"). However, Doc Ock decides to try again with his fusion experiment, only this time with enough fusion power to destroy New York City! Peter feels that his sense of duty as Spider-Man should come back to him as he realizes that only Spider-Man can stop this demented genius, but Doc Ock is only the beginning of Peter's problems. Because not only is Mary Jane caught in the middle of Doc Ock's terror, but Peter's best friend, Harry, enlists Doc Ock's help in order to take down the man Harry feels is responsible for his father's death! So not only will Harry's vengeance present a challenge to Peter, but also Doc Ock will prove to be an even more worthy opponent to Spider-Man. And Spider-Man will have to push his limits to the extreme if he is to survive against Doc Ock's wrath!<br /><br />Like a Snickers candy bar, "Spider-Man 2" really satisfies. What a joy. For fans (like myself) of the first film, the sequel will be an exhilarating ride. Every element of the storytelling is a leap beyond the first film. For one thing, the special effects have gotten better. And as far as the character of Dr. Otto Octavius/Doc Ock goes, Alfred Molina is very human and real as Doc Ock, and his fiendish arms are like individual characters all their own, like four aliens riding his shoulders, snapping their jaws wickedly. But while the action occasionally veers into melodrama, we get a much more complicated and developed sense of all the film's characters. Even Rosemary Harris' Aunt May character has more to do, and her own drama and dilemmas are nicely rounded. This characterization is not at the expense of action, however. The stunts and fights are upped considerably, and a second-act subway showdown is exhilarating (not to mention, one of my favorite "S-M 2" action scenes)! But it is Peter's drama -- getting along in the world, finding love, liking himself -- that stands even higher.<br /><br />In conclusion, "Spider-Man 2" has exactly what a blockbuster sequel should have: mind-blowing action and suspense, some laugh-out-loud humor, mind-blowing special effects, and a powerful, top-notch cast! In fact, just watching "Spider-Man 2" left me with a feeling of going back and watching the first record-breaking predecessor all over again! In a way, the highlight of "Spider-Man 2" is the human story, which best reaches its audience and, in doing so, improves upon otherwise excellent predecessors. "Spider-Man 2" tickles the heart and the brain, suspends considerable disbelief, and does so with commanding flourish -- transcending the genre and succeeding as a great movie in and of itself. "Spider-Man 2", without a doubt, is a DVD must-have when released! And in the end, all I have to say is...bring on "Spider-Man 3"!!</p></br><a href="../users/A2QH5NMHW1KTJ1.html">A2QH5NMHW1KTJ1</a><br/><p>Spiderman 2 is superb and probably one of the greatest superhero movies of all time, if not the greatest. Everything about this movie is outstanding and not for one moment do you really want to take your eyes off the screen. Without revealing any of the story plot, I can honestly tell you that it is incredible, especially the romantically plot between Peter Parker (Maguire) and Mary Jane Watson (Dunst), Harry Osborne's (Franco) quest to kill Spiderman, and Dr. Octopus (Molina) trying to capture Spiderman. Dr. Octopus is truly scary, and is a great villain in this movie and the Spiderman franchise as a whole. Even though I hope in part 3 Venom or Carnage appear.  Every actor was extraordinary in this movie, with each actor accurately portraying the emotions they should feel and also showing style during action scenes. Maguire has shown us before that he is an outstanding actor, and he has shown us again that he has the ability to do it. I don't know what to say about the visuals effects, except they are the greatest visuals and deservers an Oscar for best cinematograph. I never wanted to take my eyes off the screen because this movie literally looked that good. Kudos to the director as well, for he did an amazing job directing this movie and graphically making it the way it should look. Don't miss out on this movie....A MUST SEE FILM!!!!!!!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A2A6NH6DPE0VXR.html">A2A6NH6DPE0VXR</a><br/><p>Spiderman 2 I think is the best movie based on a comic that I've seen. It's one of the best sequels ever made as well.  The script is very well done with a ton of character build-up. Peter Parker loses his web slinging abilities and has to figure out how to get them back or maybe he doesn't even want them back. Him being too busy fighting crime is losing him jobs and also  Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst)  the women he loves. Fearing that she'd get hurt if she was part of his life is keeping him from letting her in. So she gives up on waiting for Peter and starts dating a hot shot astronaut. Harry Osborne  (James Franco), still blames Spidey for the death of his father and swears that he will get revenge. He's so obsessed with it that it's ruining his friendship with Peter. Since he thinks Peter knows who Spiderman is and is mad that he won't tell him. <p>  Harry's also using a brilliant scientist in Doctor Octavius (Alfred Molina) to try and invent something huge to get his father's business running once again. The invention fails and leaves Doctor Octavius with metal tentacles stuck to his spine. He's not a bad man but with the chip broken that let him control the tentacles, they now control him. He wants to continue his project but needs Harry's help but first Harry wants him to capture Spiderman for him. <p>  The result is a well put together movie full of so much that it feels like 3 hours and not just 2 hours and 7 minutes. There's a lot of dialogue and it can be slow but the action scenes are off the chart when there is action. It focuses more on the character Spiderman and the people in his life. May sound boring but when it all comes together at the end it's very satisfying. Plus it's more romantic than the first and Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst have even better chemestry this time around. Spiderman 2 is no doubt the best movie of the summer and I doubt anything coming out can compare to it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>The first Spider-Man was okay, but part 2 is what the first one should have been in terms of pacing, story, acting, and of course the much improved SFX. This movie is much talkier and focuses in on the drama a lot more than the action. Some of the smaller children in the theater were getting restless for pretty much the whole film due to the little amount of physical action happening on the screen. Don't get me wrong there are some great action scenes, but they are spread thinly throughout this two hour plus film. Alfred Molina as Doctor Octopus is great in terms of acting and is way cooler looking than that stupid Green Goblin outfit from the first film. Doc Ock is truly a memorable villian. Tobey and Kirsten are very good as well, but J.K. Simmons once again steal the show as the newspaper boss and thankfully gets a much bigger role in this movie. I also loved the opening credit sequence that fills you in on Spider-Man part one and the almost horror movie style done when Doc Ock is killing about 10 doctors with his tentacles while escaping from the hospital. The ending with Harry finding his father's glider and weapons was really pretty neat, but I just hope Spider-Man 3 has another villian to go with the not so interesting James Franco as the new Green Goblin. Bring on Venom in the next Spidey flick! While this comic book franchise can't compare to the first two Batman or Superman films, it sits nicely in third place behind them. Join the rest of society and swing by your local theater to see this flick now!</p></br><a href="../users/A1TK6R2JSC97HL.html">A1TK6R2JSC97HL</a><br/><p>It's plot meanders and shamelessly riffs off the first movie, slams us with special effects and brazenly ends off arrogantly predicting a sequel.  Yet this could easily be one of the greatest superhero movies ever made.<br /><br />SM2 picks up 2 years after the last movie.  Though the last movie ended with Mary Jane confessing her lover for Peter Parker, the two remain unconnected by the start of the new movie.  Trying to juggle college, a part-time job and saving the city from random acts of mass destruction, Peter Parker's life is a wreck.  Both Harry Osborn and MJ have moved on with their lives (and don't dodge foreclosure like Spidey has to).  After losing his job and MJ, and on the verge of flunking college, Parker begins losing his powers, and is forced to consider hanging up his sticky alter-ego for good.  Meanwhile, Parker's idol, the Brilliant physicist Otto Octavius, is on the verge of cracking the key to safe fusion power, while Harry Osborn holds Spiderman responsible for his father's death, and plots revenge.  Will there be an horrific accident at Dr. Octavius's demonstration?  Uh huh.  Will his mind become twisted as he becomes fused with a quartet of robotic arms?  You betcha.  Will he turn criminal to finance experiments that may blast NYC to kingdom-come?  Hey, is Darkman mean?<br /><br />Though a special effects treat, SM2 flies on the strength of Tobey Maguire's understated performance, it also rides the steam of the other players - Rosemary Harris as a feisty Aunt May, Alfred Molina as a likeable if scary Doc Octopus (even though the script just re-writes the same characters Defoe played in the last movie) and of course JK Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson.  With a script padded with tons of in-jokes yet slick enough for the non-fan who doesn't even know that superhero is one word, SM2 is a rare treat.  Best of all, SM2 stays true to the every joe-a-hero theme of the first movie (a point made during a titanic battle royale between Spidey and Doc Ock on a runaway El train).<br /><br />CAVEAT: The flick is, if anything, scarier than the last - a good example being the scene when the arms of the near-dead Doc-Ock come alive and tear up an OR.  If you've got an 8 year-older who loved the first movie, SM2 might still be too much.<br /><br />Lastly - a flick of this scale just can't be enjoyed in full screen.</p></br><a href="../users/A140XH16IKR4B0.html">A140XH16IKR4B0</a><br/><p>The producer's choice to create a Spider-Man sequel that was darker than the original was an inspired move. Spiderman 2, if filmed with twice as many special effects as the first movie, would have been a bore and a disaster.<br /><br />Toby McGuire believably portrays Peter Parker as a boy-hero guilt-ridden over his Uncle Ben's death. His after-hours life as a masked crime-fighter doesn't assuage the guilt and barely pays the bills. Peter has no life. Yet his inner decency won't let him abandon those who need him. Or will it?<br /><br />Spiderman II is best when it shows the choice a hero makes between normalcy (as defined by we non-heroes) and being true to his inner gifts. The only weakness of the movie is that some of this turmoil is resolved a bit too neatly and quickly.<br /><br />Alfred Molina as terrific as bad guy Doc Ock. The special effects, showing the good doctor walking and climbing on his robotic arms, are completely believable, as is Ock's sinister, machine-enhanced megalomania. Entertaining and interesting!</p></br><a href="../users/A32XW50ILWOXNO.html">A32XW50ILWOXNO</a><br/><p>The second installment of the &quot;Spider-Man&quot; saga is likely to be the crown jewel of the series, a blend of comic fantasy and human realism that satisfies action addicts just enough while exploring duality and classist society as well as the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; trilogy.<br /><br /> In Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst director Sam Raimi has a couple that transcends the genre: They are not their generation's best actors - Maguire's squeaky turn in &quot;Seabiscuit&quot; proves that - but their personalities - bright, humble, hopeful, just a smidge goofy - are perfectly attuned to this fare. They like others, they like each other, we like them. &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot; works on other levels, but mostly because Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson are kids we'd be proud to know (or raise), played by actors who still seem closer to Earth than Hollywood.<br /><br /> The sequel begins two years after the original: Peter is balancing crime-fighting, college and a pizza job while Mary Jane does off-Broadway Oscar Wilde (to unlikely full houses.) Peter's friend Harry (James Franco) still vows vengeance against Spider-Man for killing his father; he's also bankrolling a Nobel scientist working on fusion, Dr. Otto Octavious (Alfred Molina).<br /><br /> Octavious, who wears artificially intelligent mechanical arms to work the ball of energy, is a idol of Peter's, who happens to be writing a paper on the doctor on the day of invention unveiling, when all goes awry. The accident leaves Octavious at the behest of the giant, powerful mechanical arms, who immediately want to recreate the experiment by any means necessary.<br /><br /> Meanwhile, Peter is torn between duty and Mary Jane. His instincts and web slings are on the blink. He's late to Mary Jane's play. He loses the pizza job. He's on the outs with his Aunt May (an excellent Rosemary Harris). Harry wants Peter to produce Spider-Man. And newspaperman J. Jonah Jameson (J.K Simmons) still runs Spidey through the wringer on the front page of his tabloid. Peter seriously begins to contemplate walking away from heroism when Mary Jane gets engaged to Jameson's astronaut son.<br /><br /> Alvin Sargent's screenplay understands what issues withstand the opening weekend box office; the movie takes its time to explore Peter's connection to friends, family, and the citizens he protects. Spider-Man is among the people, not above them. He tires. He gets snippy. An excellent &quot;dying with pride&quot; spech from Harris argues for duty against dream. It's a two-hour comic book, yet firmly rooted in working-class ideals. The subtextual arguments against the media and irresponsible science reject elitism - notice how villainous attacks in both movies are against everyday commuters. Notice that Jonah pits both sides against each other for what he believes to be maximum effect while the masses embrace Spider-Man. Notice in a small scene at Mary Jane's theater how petty, circular art rules conspire to keep Peter from the Oscar Wilde play. Raimi and Sargent are quiet about it, but the movie underlines classic themes, and it does so without gore or violence of nihilism run amok. For bright, receptive teens, &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot; carries an excellent message.<br /><br /> Which doesn't mean the movie's perfect. Again the villain is thrown into the background, and while Doc Ock is more imposing than The Green Goblin, it doesn't make him any more memorable. Alfred Molina is serviceable but not wicked - his &quot;evil&quot; humor is droll and detached, his menace casual. Though Franco is a decent young actor, Harry Osborn is a poorly-written, ill-motivated villain-in-waiting, and &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot; looks less promising according to the hints dropped at the end of this movie.<br /><br /> The central love story of Peter and Mary Jane, however, is strong enough to withstand hammy, average foes - expect two for the next &quot;Spider-Man.&quot; This movie's final shot suggests there is more emotional terrain to cover despite Mary Jane's revelations; whether Raimi and Sargent remain a team for the future pictures, the critical groundwork is in place. &quot;Spider-Man&quot; and his girl will be with us for some time.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />Coupling a dead fish of a romance with a complete anti-climax of a superhero movie, Spider-man 2 fails in almost every conceivable way; put it this way, it's never a good sign when your villain is five times more likable and sympathetic as your superhero.</p></br><a href="../users/A13H7Q4JVK6DTV.html">A13H7Q4JVK6DTV</a><br/><p>Spider-Man 2 is really great and intellgent the movie is about peter parker being depress of his hero duties and that he can't be with mary jane.

The strain of having a secret identity is seriously affecting the social life and responsibilities of mild-mannered Peter Packer (Maguire) and forces him to abandon his role as the wall-crawling crime-fighter Spider-Man. When the menacing Doctor Octopus (Alfred Molina) threatens lovely Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) and the rest of New York, Peter will have to face his greatest challenge yet. "Spider-Man 2" is a spectacular and emotionally powerful comic book adventure that succeeds over the original 2002 smash hit. The critically acclaimed summer film contains a compelling plot and appealing characters with strong emotional depth. "Spider-Man 2" also features some breathtaking action sequences, amazing special effects and delightful humor. Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst and Alfred Molina deliver some moving performances. The fine cast also includes James Franco, Rosemary Harris, J. K. Simmons and Bruce Campbell in a brief funny appearance.<br /><br />If you were amazed by "Spider-Man 2" in theaters then "Spider-Man 2" Special Edition will indeed surprise you. The comic book blockbuster is presented in 2.40:1 anamorphic widescreen format. The DVD has a fine picture quality with great contrast and nice bright colors. Its Dolby Digital 5.1 sound is very impressive with splendid surround effects. The 2-Disc special edition contains over 10 hours of supplemental features like two detailed audio commentaries by director Sam Raimi, cast member Tobey Maguire and technical crew, an extended "The Making of Spider-Man 2" documentary, various behind-the-scenes featurettes, "Ordinary" music video, theatrical trailers and DVD-Rom extras. Overall, "Spider-Man 2" has a grand DVD presentation and scores a solid "A".</p></br><a href="../users/A1J66TA573ZPRX.html">A1J66TA573ZPRX</a><br/><p>The first spiderman was great and spiderman 2 was great. Both were great movies can't say that one was better than the other because they both were great. I think that everyone should see it. Also Kirstin Dunst is hot.</p></br><a href="../users/A20LY8E9NGYA4M.html">A20LY8E9NGYA4M</a><br/><p>This is one of the few times that the sequel is better than the original movie. Now that the origin of the superhero was narrated in the first "Spider-Man", the creative team was free to explore new elements of the abundant universe of the comic. In few words the story is better because they used more elements this time.<br /><br /> In "Spider-Man 2", Peter Parker is caught in a dilemma: he must use his powers or he must quit and resume his normal life? Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) is a more developed character this time, she is Spidey's love interest, but she now wants to move on with or without Peter. Also Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) plays an important role in "Spider-Man 2", her dialogues are richer and her performance is tender and sweet, just like Aunt May in the comics.<br /><br /> This time Harry Osborn (James Franco) is more important than just a good friend, Harry presents another dilemma to Spidey. And the villain is a big improvement over the "Green Goblin", Willem Dafoe was great in the first movie, but Alfred Molina as "Doctor Octopus" is one of the best villains in a comic-based movie. "Spider-Man 2" covers much more ground than the first movie.<br /><br /> The special effects are very improved, still there are some effects that look like a videogame, but overall the visual and sound effects are convincing and help to built the action. By the way, this movie has the most incredible action sequences seen so far in a comic-based movie, the action is bigger and better.<br /><br /> The music is more dynamic in "Spider-Man 2", Danny Elfman used some of the old tracks, and added new ones. The cast and the director seem more comfortable in "Spider-Man 2". Kirsten looks better with her new hairstyle, she was the ideal girl next door in the first movie, but now she looks like the ideal Mary Jane Watson (Parker). Tobey Maguire is as reliable as always, Alfred Molina is outstanding as Doc Ock and the rest of the cast is very solid.<br /><br /> "Spider-Man 2" has a little bit of everything: it has action, drama, romance, comedy, good performances, great direction by Sam Raimi, outstanding visual and sound effects, and it's better than the first one. Can't wait for the DVD release.</p></br><a href="../users/A27CHILBK6HIL2.html">A27CHILBK6HIL2</a><br/><p>MOVIE: Once the opening credits begin so does a brilliant montage of the first movie done in the style of a comic book. Basically they used the opening credits as a backdrop to put in a prologue. What makes this superhero movie stand out from those before it is that it has an enormous amount of character development. What makes this different from Batman, Superman, and the upcoming Catwoman is that it's not all about the action. Sure the movie has outstanding CGI's and a train fight that rivals the trailer truck fight in Matrix Reloaded, but there is so much emotion put out through the characters. With Batman all the movie is about is kicking ass. The reason why Spider-Man is such a successful movie is that Tobey Maguire has created such a character in Peter Parker that it allows the audience to really relate to him. We aren't superheros but sometimes it feels like we need to be in order to accomplish some things in life. Also Peter Parker is a genuine character, a &quot;same as you and me&quot; type of guy. Batman's parents were murdered, Daredevil's father was murdered, but Spider-Man really has no dark past except for the murder of his Uncle. Okay maybe murders in the family do drive people to become superheros but Spider-Man is not some guy dressed in black trying to silence the pain of his past, he's just your friendly neigberhood kind of guy. What the movie lacks is some new stuff. If you think about it, it's just a deeper version of the first one. Basically the same of Parker dealing with his conflicting lives. One other thing that bothered me was all the science mumbo jumbo the filled the movie with. I kind of laughed at how Octavius described how he met his wife when she was studying English Literature and he was studying Science. Please! Overall though a new best for the genre. It's a croud pleaser with a little more depth that just an action fare.<br /><br /> ACTING: You have to give it to the cast because without the cast they've got they would be nowhere. Alfred Molina steals the show as Dr. Octavius, his menacing Doc Ock just worked out so well. Tobey is Spider-Man, in and out, and Kirsten Dunst plays the lovely MJ Watson. Great casts make great movies.<br /><br /> BOTTOM LINE: Some parts of the movie could have been changed for the better, but overall this was one great superhero movie. I really think the new Batman will be a flop because Spider-Man has not only raised the bar, Spider-Man removed the bar and has become the bar.</p></br><a href="../users/ABSX5TGEGRH76.html">ABSX5TGEGRH76</a><br/><p>I must say that I was very excited about seeing this movie, so much that I was worried that I would be let down like with Star Wars I and The Matrix Reloaded.  Fortunately, Sam Raimi, Tobey McGuire, Kirsten Dunst, and James Franco were able to not only spellbind us again, but this film far surpassed the orginal Spider-Man, which was no easy feat.<br />Two years after the events of the first film, Peter Parker (McGuire) is down and out; he is losing his friends, his jobs, and and grades are quickly declining.  The cause for all this is because of his escapades as Spider-Man.  He can never keep an appointment with Mary-Jane Watson (Dunst), the woman he loves, and this drives her away.  His friend Harry Osborne (Franco) can't stand the fact that he has more loyalty to Spidey than to him.  Harry believes that Spidey killed his father, Norman Osbourne (Willem Dafoe), who, unbeknownst to Harry, was the Green Goblin.<br />Meanwhile, Harry is funding a project being researched by an eminent scientist, Dr. Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina), which will create a new, cheap, almost never-ending energy source.  Sadly, things go wrong (surprise surprise), and Otto gets four mechanical arms fused onto his back, and they have minds of their own.  They begin to "suggest" that he do things, like start the project again, rob banks, and kill people.<br />Finally, after losing his friends and most of his jobs, Peter throws away his Spidey suit, vowing never to be Spider-Man again.  This of course opens up New York to a rapidly increasing crime rate.<br />All of the actors did a superb job in this film.  Dunst, Franco, Rosemary Harris (playing Aunt May), and J.K. Simmons (playing the hilarious J. Jonah Jameson) all got bigger roles, and even Cliff Robertson (Uncle Ben) and Willem Dafoe got small cameo roles.  The story remained strong, especially for a comic book film, and the effects were amazing.  This is definitely the ideal summer film.</p></br><a href="../users/AEGR40GALMDJ4.html">AEGR40GALMDJ4</a><br/><p>After seeing this movie, I left the theater feeling completely fulfilled.  Nothing about this movie was bad.  It may not be the best superhero movie, but it comes pretty close.  The movie shows more character development, and the visual effects are more stunning than the first.  It is definately the best sequel I have ever seen.  Awesome Awesome Awesome.  I highly reccomend it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>Most of my friends insist that "Spider-Man 2" is better than the original.  Now, I like "Spider-Man" immensely.  Instead of viewing one film inferior to the other I feel that "Spider-Man 2" should be viewed as the logical extension of an ongoing saga.  The first film did an excellent job of explaining the origins of Spider-Man.  The second film explores what it actually means to be Spider-Man.  Essentially Peter Parker-Spider-Man is in the midst of an identity crisis here.  Tobey Maguire does an excellent job in showing the angst of being a superhero.  Kirsten Dunst, once again, glows as Mary Jane Watson.  Alfred Molina is outstanding as Otto Octavius-Doc Ock.  It's refreshing that the filmmakers have cast an actor for their appropriateness for the role instead of some major star who just bring their name to the proceedings i.e. the "Batman" films.  Once again Sam Raimi brings a sure hand to the proceedings and Alvin Sargent should be commended for writing a script that adds depth and shading to the characters.</p></br><a href="../users/AUHG8KSHI529U.html">AUHG8KSHI529U</a><br/><p>The important question is, do you like comic-book super-hero movies or not?  If you do not, you might still like this movie, but probably not as much as you should.  However, if you do, this is probably the best one ever made.  Sam Raimi does a magnificent job with every aspect of this movie.  He recaps the first movie in drawings over the opening titles, and away we go.  The visual effects are much better than the first movie and the story line is more involved and, being Spider-Man, still achingly sad in a teen-age angst comic-book sort of way.<br /><br />Here I am thinking of Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) gazing from the stage at Peter's empty theater seat, not knowing that poor Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is indeed at the theater, being kept out by an overly officious usher.  It is touching in the way it is handled.  These are good actors portraying these roles.  It is an outlandish story, but played as if they were real people and all this exotic reality were perfectly normal.<br /><br />Spider-Man and Doctor Octopus (Alfred Molina is especially terffic) battle it out in terrific sequences, as they did in the original stories.  It is interesting how they create him in this film.  Of course, the whole story is preposterous.  That is not the point.  You have to get past that before the film starts.  There is a sequence on an elevated train that is absolutely superb.  If you quibble about it not being even marginally possible in any universe, you should just go home and put on a t-shirt that says, "I don't know how to have any fun at all."<br /><br />Really.</p></br><a href="../users/AKT8TGIT6VVZ5.html">AKT8TGIT6VVZ5</a><br/><p>In Spider-Man 2 director Sam Raimi and his talented team of writers, including distinguished novelist Michael Chabon, have crafted what is the finest film I have seen based on a Marvel Comics superhero. There's more impressive chases and fights between the hero and villain in &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot; than I have seen, for example, in the &quot;X-Men&quot; films. However, the film works best at the emotional - indeed humane - level, in which we see both the villain, Doc Ock, Doctor Otto Octavius (brilliantly performed by Alfred Molina) and the hero, Peter Parker aka Spider-Man (Tobey Maguire) wrestle with their consciences. Indeed Spider-Man must make a difficult decision; whether to use his unique gifts to protect his fellow citizens or lose them to gain finally the trust and love of his long-time friend Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst). He must also contend unexpectedly with his friendship with the son of Harry Osborn aka the Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe) unraveling, setting up the plot of what undoubtedly will be the third film in the series. Raimi has done such an excellent job in raising the stakes in the second film, which is literally a major improvement over the first, that it may be a difficult challenge for him to meet. Aside from Molina, Maguire and Durst, Rosemary Harris gives yet another splendid performance as Peter's aunt. Composer Danny Elfman's score may be his most brooding ever, equal to his excellent film score for the first Batman film. Not only is this the best film of 2004 in the action-adventure genre, it may be among the finest in recent memory.</p></br><a href="../users/A1HX00DL0SZM1G.html">A1HX00DL0SZM1G</a><br/><p>I went into this movie with low expectations. Two years earlier I had sat through every disappointing moment of the original movie full of all that missed opportunities and blah blah line deliveries.<br /><br />So, switch to 2004 and my date and I stood outside a movie theater in Reston, Va. pondering our choices. There was DODGEBALL all sold out (to my silent relief since my date was the only one who had expressed an interest in the screwball comedy). Somehow we ended up putting down our cash (or at least mine) for the second Spiderman and I entered the theater and braced myself for what might come.<br /><br />Lo and behold two hours or so later I left the theater energized and excited about the emerging franchise. The simple fact was that this second installment was far better than the first. Not saddled with having to explain Spidey's abilities and his coming to terms with his powers. This follow-up was able to focus on the action and adventure without losing focus on what for me was the best part of the picture - the relationship between Mary Jane (played by the seemingly omnipresent Kirsten Dunst) and Peter Parker. It was an interesting parting shot that tied up that storyline nicely (at least until the next movie).<br /><br />Another element that separated this movie from its predecessor was Alfred Molina as the main villain. A truly sympathetic character he was not the evil meglomaniacal villain that so often inhabit the superhero canon, but a good man trapped and manipulated by his own invention.<br /><br />One element I really liked was the unmasking of Spiderman (you'll have to see the movie to see what I mean) and this element should lead to some interesting developments in the third movie.<br /><br />Fans should beware that director Sam Raimi is reportedly working on a directors cut for this movie with extra and extended scenes that Columbia TriStar is apparently willing to finance (new spfx etc). I for one will more than likely be picking up the one to be released at the end of this month.</p></br><a href="../users/A16QODENBJVUI1.html">A16QODENBJVUI1</a><br/><p>As a rule, superhero movies are a rather lackluster genre.  The emphasis is almost always on a bankable star, flashy special effects, and elaborate confrontations with super villains.  SPIDERMAN 2 lacks none of these things, but luckily it has a great deal more going for it.  More than anything else, SPIDERMAN 2 has a great story.  Somewhere along the line, the other superhero movies lost track of the story; this superb film brings that back.<br /><br />I do not think that it is any exaggeration to say that this is the finest superhero movie ever made, and the primary reason for that is the super screenplay.  Film mastermind Sam Raimi obviously recognized that while special effects and stars are great enhancements to a film, at root you have to have a story worth the telling.  He therefore recruited Pulitzer Prize winning novelist Michael Chabon (whose novel THE AMAZING ADVENTURES OF KAVALIER AND CLAY proved that he possessed an absolute mastery over comic book type stories) to provide the basic story around which the screenplay was written.  I found the first film to be mildly interesting, but the vast improvement in the second film over the first is overwhelmingly because of the greatly improved storyline.<br /><br />Without giving away any major plot details, the situation is this:  in most superhero movies, despite whatever attempts are made at depicting the situation of the central character as tragic, we actually envy them.  What male wouldn't love to be Superman?  Who wouldn't want super strength, the ability to fly, or invulnerability?  Batman may lack these, but Bruce Wayne is a multi-billionaire with whom most of us would trade places in a second.  And while Bruce broods a lot, it is very difficult to feel that he truly has a rotten life.  The brilliance of SPIDERMAN 2 lies in the fact that an hour into the movie, it is impossible to imagine anyone wanting to trade places with Peter Parker.  Yeah, he is a superhero, but his life really and truly sucks, and in super fashion.  He has a horrible job, is struggling in school, discoveries that his aunt is being evicted from her house, lives in an absolutely wretched apartment (with a dreadful landlord, magnificently played by Russian comic Elya Baskin), and is feeling very, very lonely.  But worst of all, MJ, the love of his life, has not only gotten engaged in the face of Peter's reluctance to get involved with her, but is furious at Peter for his ongoing unreliability.  As he feels himself losing her presence in his life, he actually begins losing his powers.  And all this takes place as he has to face a new and dangerous enemy in Doc Ock, a brilliant scientist whose body and mind has been taken over by intelligent high-tech tentacles (played marvelously by superb character actor Alfred Molina).<br /><br />Luckily, the film excels not only in setting up the situation, but does an excellent job of resolving the central concepts in the storyline.  Peter recovers his passion for MJ and thereby his superpowers (the precise instance that he once again has his powers is the moment when MJ in a coffee shop asks him to kiss her), recovers his sense of purpose, and in the end is rescued from some of his loneliness.<br /><br />After SPIDERMAN, I was not especially looking forward to SPIDERMAN 2, but after this one, and especially after learning that Raimi has asked Michael Chabon to write another story, I am eagerly awaiting the next one.  Early rumor is that James Franco as Harry Osborn will resurrect his father?s Green Hornet, and that the Black Cat (perhaps played by Eliza Dushku, who is reportedly favored for the role by Raimi) will make an appearance.</p></br><a href="../users/A23GFTVIETX7DS.html">A23GFTVIETX7DS</a><br/><p>With &quot;Spiderman 2&quot;, Director Sam Raimi delivers that rarest of beasts: an action/adventure movie with real emotional depth. Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) finds himself at odds with his super hero powers. His crime-fighting duties have left him penniless, red-eyed with exhaustion, and in danger of flunking out of college. What's more, his long-time love, MJ (Kirsten Dunst) is on the brink of cutting him out of her life. Although he can save children from careening cars, he can't help Aunt May stop the foreclosure on her house. So what's a superhero to do? Even the villain - brilliant scientist Dr. Octavius turned Doctor Octopus (Alfred Molina) - is conflicted as his mechanical arms transport him into a life of crime. However, these emotional complications do not wreck the flow of the action; the fight and chase sequences are high-paced, sometimes even too tumultuous to take it all in, and they ratchet up the tension scene by scene. The humorous and ironic moments serve as yet another layer of texture.<br /><br /> From the stunning graphic art sequence of the opening credits to the final scene, &quot;Spiderman 2&quot; is a visually impressive film, even more so than the first. In this sequel, everything seems to come together, from the comic book feel to the Hollywood special effects to the acting to the screenplay itself. Although the person accompanying me complained that the film had &quot;too much talking&quot;, I felt the balance between action and character development was perfect.<br /><br /> If you liked the first &quot;Spiderman&quot;, you'll like this one even more. Naturally, you can't expect an art film here, or even a drama, but Spiderman 2 excels at what it sets out to do: bring the comic book to life in an action movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GPEV42IO41CI.html">A2GPEV42IO41CI</a><br/><p>Tobey Maguire stars as Peter Parker, aka Spider-Man, in this clever, thrilling, and sometimes poignant blockbuster, sure to please all ages.  Peter is something of a lost soul, living in a dump, forever in debt, habitually late to class, and losing jobs quicker than you can say, "Pizza Time!" - all the while moonlighting as New York City's greatest crime fighting hero.  He's also hopelessly in love with actress Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst), but unable to tell her due to his Spider-Man responsibilities and the fact that he's the shyest and most naive young man ever.  Enter Dr. Octavious (Alfred Molina), a scientist who has discovered a new and very dangerous form of energy - which goes horribly wrong and changes him into an evil monster, complete with four super-strong metal arms.  He conspires with the late Green Goblin's son (James Franco) to kidnap Mary Jane and destroy Spider-Man!<br /><br />Tobey Maguire gives Spider-Man a very real, EveryGuy face; an average-Joe who doesn't have all the answers (except when he's wearing that red and blue suit), but does have lots of problems and insecurities.  Maguire, with his puppy dog face and endearing lisp, is the boy you'd like to take you to the prom (or adopt, depending on your age).  Kirsten Dunst is suitably wholesome and perky as his love-interest, and Alfred Molina is just right as the creepy and campy arch villain.  The special effects are first-class and the whole movie is a feast for the eyes.<br /><br />I really enjoyed Spider-Man 2.  The eye-popping scenes of Spidey sailing through Manhattan's skyscrapers are great fun; I heartily recommend Spider-Man 2 for family-friendly thrills.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PXHFGJZBNLXB.html">A2PXHFGJZBNLXB</a><br/><p>SPIDERMAN continues the Spiderman saga as Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) tries to juggle his responsibilities as a superhero and as a student at Columbia University trying to pay his rent and attend his classes. Things are not easy, to say the least---especially when a new villain arrives, in the form of Doc Ock (Alfred Molina), endowed with four cyber-intelligent tentacles that force him to continue with experiments that could put Manhattan in mortal danger. And of course Peter still has a crush on Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), and friend Harry Osborn (James Franco) still has a vendetta against Spiderman for the murder of his father.<br /><br />Peter Parker feels the great burden of his responsibilities, and the ways in which he tries to deal with it is part of what makes SPIDERMAN a worthy sequel to the 2001 original. SPIDERMAN was a good genre film because, through all the special effects and action scenes, director Sam Raimi never lost track of the human element, never allowed the film to sink into a brainless action spectacle. Peter Parker the character is fully given his due, and there is a wonderful authenticity to the film's emotions-nothing artificially heightened or manipulative. SPIDERMAN 2 is emotionally richer than the original, and that is quite an accomplishment for a sequel. Even better, the special effects are slightly more convincing than they were in the first film, and there are some bravura action scenes---particularly one in which Spiderman has to use all his power to stop a moving train---that equal the best of any superhero epic.<br /><br />One would be hard-pressed to think of anyone else that could have played Spiderman as convincingly as Tobey Maguire does in both films. He never expresses emotions through attention-grabbing gestures, but always stays in character beautifully. The other performances are good, but Maguire helps take the film to a higher level. SPIDERMAN 2 is a great sequel, a worthy superhero movie, and terrific entertainment. Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/AWSYTZ2I2MW0V.html">AWSYTZ2I2MW0V</a><br/><p>this SPIDER MAN 2 is equal to the first one in quality! The spidey scenes flowing through the city and fighting are amazing...Dr. Octopus is identical to the comics, and is a real cool enemy for Spider man...REALLY GOOD!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A3SFO2GSP5CVSM.html">A3SFO2GSP5CVSM</a><br/><p>The dread franchise film has killed off many a potentially interesting character (Superman, Batman, Ripley, Rocky) & given leases of life to characters that are paper-thin (Indy Jones, Jason Voorhees, Catwoman). The latest franchise film is Spider-Man 2, directed by Sam Raimi. The 1st Spider-Man was probably the best comic book film ever made- mostly because its leads- Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker/Spider-Man, & Kirsten Dunst as his love- Mary Jane Watson a) can both act (unlike, say Christopher Reeve as Superman), b) are well cast (unlike Michael Keaton in the 1st 2 Batman films). & c) have chemistry (unlike Reeve & Margot Kidder in the Superman films). Maguire, especially, is so good an actor that he is 1 of those rarities that can run a panoply of emotions through just his eyes. He is almost irresistible to watch onscreen.... All in all, a very good film, & along with the 1st film, simply the best superhero films ever made. I hope the writers from this film stick with the whole series because, next to Batman, Spidey probably has the best pantheon of villains in comic book lore. Future baddies could include Dr. Doom, Venom, Carnage, the Sandman, Rhino, the Lizard, & Electro, among others. But, what makes good writing in such a film valuable are the little moments- like Peter's confession to Aunt May about how & why Uncle Ben really died, a surreal moment on an elevator between Spidey & a shocked citizen, references to other characters in the Marvel Comics universe, allusions & parallels to Oscar Wilde's The Important Of Being Earnest, & a street musician singing the old Spider-Man tv cartoon series theme song from the 1960s. Such touches are what invigorate this franchise above the others & what killed off the increasingly dark & directionless Batman franchise. Sam Raimi proves he is a director who knows how to milk a proven commodity without imposing his own distorted `vision' on it- unlike Batman director Tim Burton.</p></br><a href="../users/A33PNAQ33DGBJG.html">A33PNAQ33DGBJG</a><br/><p>This was pretty good for a sequel but a little more violent than # 1. I wouldn't recommend it for children not use to violence. The story line was okay but just not enough depth to make it better than the first one.</p></br><a href="../users/A2QQHIY23PL7H3.html">A2QQHIY23PL7H3</a><br/><p>Spider-Man 2 is better than the original Spider-Man. I feel I should get that out of the way first, since most sequels have a tough time topping the first one. However, I feel Spider-Man 2 is only better in the sense that if the same production staff remade Spider-Man, it should naturally be better. That's what this sequel feels like, a literal remake with some spiced up elements here and there. It's a good film, but it's not really the way I thought a sequel should be.<br /><br />Effects are even better than the first, and the tentacles of Doc Ock make for some truly spectacular battles, including a centerpiece on a runaway train. Tobey Maguire continues to give an excellent portrayal of Peter Parker, and has good chemistry with Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane. Alfred Molina has more to work with as Doc Ock than Dafoe did as the Goblin, and humanizes what was once a wacky villain. James Franco continues to develop Harry Osborn well, and the supporting cast like JK Simmons and Rosemary Harris fill out the high-caliber acting.<br /><br />But the script needs work. It uses one of the worst superhero cliches as the main plot, that of the hero calling it quits. It's never convincing, and the film drags as we wait for Peter to realize things we've known all along. Character relationships, though well-acted, don't seem to have progressed since the first movie. We're still treading the Peter/Mary Jane love triangle, just with a different third wheel. Harry still has his on/off friendship with Peter. There are nice plot twists that shake things up towards the end, but most of the film is wasted on the exact same angst from the first one. For a story supposedly set 3 years later, it might as well have been 3 days.<br /><br />We get a dvd with good extras and audio/video presentation. I enjoy Spider-Man 2 on its own, and it's nice to have it in my dvd library, but as a sequel it's not fresh enough for me. Hopefully next year's Spider-Man 3 will fix that.</p></br><a href="../users/A2G8IR6ENZSQHF.html">A2G8IR6ENZSQHF</a><br/><p>I'm going to risk getting a bunch of "Unhelpful" votes now by saying this- "Spider-Man 2" is slightly overrated.  This is an entertaining and sometimes moving film, but it's not without its flaws.  Those who are saying this is the best comic book film ever have likely not seen many comic book films.  I found "Spider-Man 2" to be somewhat below such films as "Supermans I and II" (In fact, this film borrows some themes from "Superman II"), "Hulk" (for those who haven't read my previous reviews, I was one of the few that loved that film), and even the second "X-Men" film.  However, this is still a very good movie, and it will probably end up in my year's Top 10 list (out of the 50 or so films I see a year).<br /><br />Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst continue to be an appealing couple.  Really, there couldn't be a better Spider-Man than Maguire.  My personal favorite of the acting jobs is JK Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson, who gives the film all of its funniest momemts.  I honestly believe he should be up for an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.  Another stand-out is Alfred Molina, who makes Dr. Octopus equally sympathetic and dangerous.  The sole sore here is James Franco as Harry Osbourne.  I sensed that we were supposed to sympathize with him as well, but from the beginning of the film he's too angry and hateful.<br /><br />The action in "Spider-Man 2" is almost spectacular.  In this area, "Spider-Man 2" improves on the first one in almost every way.  My only complaint is that there's not enough of it.  The film feels about 20 minutes too long, and I honestly think that it could have done with fewer of Peter Parker's "agonizing over what to do" moments.  Don't get me wrong, the movie did need some of these scenes.  There are just too many of them, and things occasionally bog down.  However, the film corrects itself at the climax, which works both on an action-filled and an emotional level.  Needless to say, we can't wait for "Spider-Man 3".<br /><br />On the whole, I would say that "Spider-Man 2" is a huge improvement over the first film, which I was slightly disappointed with.  The acting is even better, the villain is perfect, and the climax is rousing.  While I won't say "Spider-Man 2" is the best comic book film out there, it's a good way to kill a couple hours, and to give yourself an adrenaline boost.</p></br><a href="../users/A1V3IO23FZFF9L.html">A1V3IO23FZFF9L</a><br/><p>Spiderman 2 is a great movie.

The movie grabs your attention the very instant it starts and it never fails to entertain.<br /><br />The acting is magnificent and it's obvious that the cast worked their little tushies off! GRIN Tobey Maguire shines again as Peter Parker, who when he's not Spiderman is the "Everyman" who is stuck in a rotten, very low paying job, having problems committing to his girl because he can't tell her he's Spiderman, and he's not exactly able to afford a nice home, either. Yet he possesses such incredible powers! He is Spiderman yet incredibly enough he can't make up his mind if he should continue on as both Peter Parker and Spiderman. Should he hang up his Spiderman uniform, he wonders? Great acting here! Equally true, Alfred Molina cannot fail when he is cast as the tragic but evil villain Doc Ock. Parker must choose between fighting evil Doc Ock in his role as Spiderman or settling instead for a MUCH more meager existence as Peter Parker and Peter Parker alone. Worse yet, Peter Parker is also challenged by The Green Goblin once over again played by William Defoe. Kirsten Dunst also is cast so well as Peter's girlfriend Mary Jane; their chemistry is awesome! Again the acting is totally convincing and a real treat to enjoy. Don't forget to look for the train scene! GRIN<br /><br />And yet there's MORE! The DVD is loaded--really loaded--with great extras! There's a technical commentary, a "Spidey Sense 2" pop-up trivia track, a blooper reel, a 12 (yes, TWELVE) part documentary on how they made the film, and a little special something called "Ock-umentary: Eight Arms to Hold You!" SMILE There are quite a few other extras as well.<br /><br />The picture and sound quality are excellent and the DVD 2 disc set is nicely packaged. SO, with the holiday season upon us, who could resist getting a copy of this film? Give yourself and the people you care about a much deserved present this year! I guarantee you won't regret it! And by the way, can we get a Spiderman 3 soon in the new year?

And in this world of 2004, where do we find them? In our Politics? In our Celebrities? I think not. Where we find our heroes is in the movies, and unfortunately we find them, not in or of the world in which we live, but among Superman, Daredevil, Batman and for the last couple of years we find it in Peter Parker or as he's better known...Spiderman.<br />Peter Parker as portrayed by Tobey Maguire is a conflicted hero: he knows what he needs to do, what he is destined to do but he's torn between Superherodom and an ordinary life of College, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) and his best friend Harry Osborn (James Franco looking more and more like James Dean every minute).<br />"Spiderman 2" is a touching, sad movie with a major emphasis away from the physical feats of daring and a audacious move towards, for this type of genre movie, the personal and emotional life of it's hero: Peter Parker wants a normal life but realizes that it is not in the cards for him.<br />Sam Raimi, director of "Spiderman2" has opted to make a movie filled with pathos and sadness, though the scenes of daring-do are done with bravado and expertise as befits this genre. But the lingering feeling you take away from this movie is one of emotional angst and the very real feeling that emotional connections are not easily attained nor kept. It is a very unfortunate reality of the world in which we now live: life is hell even for the super-human.</p></br><a href="../users/A6ADO7B6FUVN.html">A6ADO7B6FUVN</a><br/><p>The sequel to Spider-Man brings the audience to where the first film left off through a brief sketched review of the first film during the opening credits, which is rather cool.  Quickly the film jumps into action as Spider-Man a.k.a. Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) must save the day as he struggles to keep his job as a pizza delivery boy while maintaining good status as a science student at Columbia University.  This is a difficult balancing act for Parker who also works as a freelance photographer for the Daily Bugle where the owner, J. J. Jameson, does everything possible to make life sour for Spider-Man.  Moreover, the most difficult issue for Parker to tackle is what his uncle once taught him, "with great powers comes great responsibility", as he must withstand his love for Mary Jane in order to protect her from his enemies.<br /><br />The balancing act performed by Parker is catching up with him as it causes him great stress, which in the end begins to negatively influence his life.  Parker's grades are slipping, as he must write a paper, which he has decideds to write on Dr. Octavius (Alfred Molina), a prominent physicist.  It happens to be that Dr. Octavius works for Harry Osborn (James Franco), Parker's friend and father of the late Green Goblin, as he is developing fusion in order to provide the world with free electricity.  However, the experiment goes wrong and it creates the monster Dr. Octopus, which soon becomes Spider-Man's new archenemy.<br /><br />Internally Parker struggles with what most people face everyday, choices and the stress brought upon him through his choices, as they influence those around him.  However, his choices have a slightly grander influence on people as he saves lives and fights against evil.  Parker also envies the normality of humanity, which he feels that he cannot have, as he must use his great powers responsibly.  This struggle produces an overburden of stress and seems to weaken him in all aspects of life, as he also finds himself pushing away the people for which he cares.<br /><br />Spider-Man is a roller coaster that brings the audience through the high and lows of Parker's life, as he struggles with his existential identity.  The director Sam Raimi projects this internal struggle onto the silver screen through popular psychology and a heavy dose of scripted dialogue, which is at times a little awkward.  The method in which Raimi portrays Parker's difficult position in life comes across to the audience a little too straightforward.  This straightforwardness makes the internal struggle seem slightly absurd, much like our contemporary pop culture's need for instant gratification.  The notion of instant gratification ushers thoughts to ponder that the making of Spider-Man 2 was hastened, as the film does not leave anything for the audience to ponder.  However, Spider-Man is a superhero and it is expected that he will win as he brings his justice to evil.  Nonetheless, it is intriguing to see Raimi depict the human side of Parker.<br /><br />Sam Raimi does a great job telling the story of Parker and his endeavors as he goes about to find a solution to his problems.  The detailed computer generated images and cool special effects provide spellbinding action as Spider-Man attempts to win over evil.  However, the sequel does not deliver the same caliber of work as the predecessor did, which offered more for the audience to reflect upon as Parker had to learn how to live with his gift.</p></br><a href="../users/ALWB64XOXNMDP.html">ALWB64XOXNMDP</a><br/><p>Doc Ock is better as a black hat in this one. I believe he came across better because you could see his facial expressions in this one. Green Goblin's face was hidden during his evil moments. I like this one better because there is more at risk in this one. For Spidey fans that don't know; Jameson's son becomes a Man Wolf in the comics...and professor Connors becomes the Lizard.  Now if only the Lizard is in number 3; it might be just as good.  I have to reccomend this one. It has a lot more Spidey action that wasn't in the first. If you like the comic; this movie duplicates the best of the series on the silver screen!</p></br><a href="../users/A1R602SXNGOMJ4.html">A1R602SXNGOMJ4</a><br/><p>I don't know if I've ever seen a sequel that was actually good.  The low-key opening third of the film in which Parker's character and situation is explored and revealed is quite engaging. Maguire has a soft, laid back approach that is quite appealing. This feels like a real film with real characters. The surrounding characters are a little over-blown, but seen as a film about a real person living in a comic-book fantasy, they work well, and there is a healthy, knowing tongue-in-cheek intelligence about the film that pulls me in. But at some point in the middle when the action film section really gets going I realized that I had become bored. The film had lost the art-house feel of the opening, had become yet another Hollywood No Brainer with big action sequences, no character development, no surprises, just the usual crash scenes. It was hard to stay focused, and I wondered why and where exactly the awareness of the intelligent viewer had been dropped. Certainly Molina plays the villain with wink-wink, thigh slapping gusto, and there is enough humour and drama in the ending to make most readers forget the tedium of the the middle third. But considered as a whole, the film failed for me.</p></br><a href="../users/ALJGB7XHPFCR.html">ALJGB7XHPFCR</a><br/><p>I guess I am in the minority. I thought the film was entertaining but I certainly don't think it deserves all the hoopla that's been going around. Visually, it didn't offer anything that was new. The plot was very different from the first but what I liked about the first one was the character development.....getting to know who these people are. In Spider 2, it seemed that there were so many maudlin moments that were unnecessary. Constantly telling the audience that things are bad. Alrgiht. I got the point. Move on. I thought the acting was very forced also. Too many tears for a comic book character. In fact, every character had some tears to shed at various points, even the bad guys, the supporting actors and the EXTRAS!!! C'mon.

The end is not only satisfying, but leaves a cliffhanger for "Spider-Man III", coming summer 2006. Everyone in this film was convincing in their roles. Shouldn't have been rated PG-13, though there are some frightening images. Keep it up. Better than the first one.

If you liked the first Spideman, you will love this one..and if you didnt like the first one..give this one a try, it's better and i just saw the third one..and i liked it...Topher Grace is good as Venum, as is Church as Sandman, special effects rocked as usual and Maguire, though dorky as ever, was very funny in parts, but im still not sold on him as Peter Parker, im surprised his eyes dont bug out of his head.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ.html">A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ</a><br/><p>Most people moan and complain about sequels once they are out. And even when they are only mentioned. For a long time sequels are looked down upon, and are almost never as good as the original. But a superior sequel, while rare, does happen. Just look at "Aliens" and "Terminator 2", among few others. And so Sam Raimi and his cast and crew have done one of those rare hollywood achievements. A big Hollywood sequel that's so much better than the original. Not saying anything about part 1, of course. Here, with a bigger budget, more dazzling effects, a better, more interesting villain, and a more richly textured script and story with more heart and meaning, the films eclipses the first one on all levels. I am surprised with how well I took in the franchise because I was never a Spider-Man fan when I was little. Knew absolutely nothing about it. What a surprise. Tobey Maguire returns as Peter Parker, still a young kid now in college, who is trying desperatley to keep his life together, although with school, a job, and being a web slinging superhero, it's not going very well. Enter Dr. Otto Octavius(Alfred Molina), a brilliant scientist whose recent research is funded by Peter's good friend, Harry Osborne(James Franco), who is out for revenge against Spiderman who he thinks killed his father. Things go bad when Dr. Octavius' new experiment foes horribly awry(don't they always?), and soon his tentacle arms he created are now a part of his body. Instead of getting help, the tentacles become more ominous and soon Doc Ock(as he is now referred too)begins to go mad to continue his research. What will he get?. Harry offers Doc Ock whatever he needs, if he brings Spiderman to him. Besides all that, there is the ongoing story of Peter's love for the lovely Mary Jane Watson(Kirsten Dunst). And this is what's so great about the movie, and how it foes against the expected Hollywood conventions. The action and all of the superhero aspect of the movie is not what's important. It's not what's going on here. It's not how to make it bigger and bigger and throw in a storyline here to balance it out. In these movies, the movie is about the people. Not the heroics or the effects or whatever. Raimi and his writers create characters that, under some odd circumstances, are real. People we believe in. The movie doesn't come back two years later and throw these people into just another wild adventure. The characters grow as anyone in reality does, and they are where they should be in two years. They don't stay in once place. They grow and mature and the storylines develop and go further, instead of forgetting everything and just making another movie. It's about the story and characters, and in this day and age, that is so refrshing and welcomed. The actors here are as good as ever. Maguire continues to prove that he is an excellent Peter Parker, and makes a convincing super hero. Kirsten Dunst emits just a lovely radiance that really makes her seem like the sweet girl next door that anybody would fall in love with, even tho her character still kinda becomes the "damsel in distress" here. James Franco is good, but his obsession with revenge got old pretty fast. It was a nice story arc for him and the movie, but it got annoying. Whenever you saw him, he would just change direction and throw it in Peter's face. Or at the party when he, drunkenly, sloshes up to Peter and just starts accosting him. It just felt pushed more than anything else. Alfred Molina was so much more likeable as the villain, because he had the humanity left in him. At the end, he was the nice guy we met earlier on. Willem Dafoe, who cameos, was good, but Molina and the character of Doc Ock was just so much better. It was also nice that J.K. Simmons and Rosemary Harris got bigger roles as well. And yes, Raimi regular Bruce Campbell makes another welcomed cameo. As does Cliff Robertson as Uncle Ben. Things happen in this movie that will forever change things in the next film. I won't say what they are, but it will bring a new dynamic to the ongoing storyline for Part 3. The extras on the DVD are also incredible and exhausting. Spider-Man 2 has been hailed as the best superheo movie ever, and while I have another one that takes that place, this one is definitley strong enough to take that title. This movie makes Spider-Man 3 that much more exciting. Thanks Sam.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FVAWZNKW9GX.html">A3FVAWZNKW9GX</a><br/><p>No, Harry Oswald doesn't go around quoting "The Princess Bride," or referring to Inigo Montoya's famous quest to revenge his father's death by a six-fingered man. However, he blames Spiderman for the death of his father (AKA the Green Goblin). He'll do anything to avenge his father, and that includes making a deal with Dr. Octopus.<br /><br />That, and several other excellent subplots help make Spiderman 2 the best screen adaptation of a comic book series. I argue that it is better than best-of-show in a genre, and can be placed in the echelons of great movies overall.<br /><br />Although incredible effects help create a real Spiderman, the movie excels because of the humanity of Peter Parker.<br /><br />Peter is in love, but isn't willing to tell Mary Jane. He uses Spiderman as his excuse even though it is old fashioned fear of commitment and rejection that are at play. Any teenager or young 20s man has felt that angst, and so we relate to Peter.<br /><br />Peter loves his Aunt May and the late Uncle Ben, and feels heavy guilt for Uncle Ben's death. It was Peter, after all, who let the thief who later killed Ben escape. The relationship between Aunt May and Peter is like a grandmother and grandchild, and is believable.<br /><br />Mr. Jameson is the least believable character, and the most caricatured. Snapping quickly at any opportunity to malign Spiderman's reputation, he acknowledges that Spidey's apparent retirement causes an increase in the crime rate.<br /><br />The Plot:<br /><br />Peter tries to set aside his Spiderman persona to forge a real life. Too often, he found Spidey interfering with his ability to keep his word, to be on time, keep his grades up, to earn money and to keep and grow relationships.<br /><br />After soul-searching, he quits, and tries a post-Spidey lifestyle. He watches as police rush by a few times. When Peter saves a baby in a burning building without the assistance of super powers, only to learn someone remained in the building and died, he knows he could've done something.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Harry Oswald introduces Peter to his hero, physicist Dr. Octavius. Dr. Octavius is working on a project that can revolutionize and resolve the world's energy problem. During a demonstration, the experiment goes awry. Spiderman launches into action, and saves the day. Unfortunately, Dr. Octavius's beloved wife dies in an explosion, and the Dr. himself finds that the robotic arms he used to help with the experiment have fused to his nervous system.<br /><br />Raging against Spiderman for, as he believes, killing his wife, Dr. Octavius seeks revenge. Concurrently, he tries to rebuild the dangerous experiment. He needs rare materials, and deals with Harry, who also wants revenge. If Dr. Octavius captures Spiderman, Harry will give him the material.<br /><br />When Harry pulls out a dagger, ready to kill the bound up Spiderman, he pulls off the mask, and everything changes. How can his best friend be Spiderman?<br /><br />All of the while, Peter is trying to make ends meet. The cantankerous Mr. Jameson hires Peter to photograph a social event involving John, his son, a famous astronaut.<br /><br />It turns out that John is seeing Mary Jane, and becomes engaged to her. Peter's heart sinks, and he tries to talk her out of it and back into a relationship with him. MJ counters that she and Peter have no relationship to return to. It is over, and Peter knows it.<br /><br />When Dr. Octavius kidnaps MJ, and tells Peter to tell Spidey to meet him, Peter must decide if Spiderman must exist to save MJ, the world, but in doing so, lose MJ's heart.<br /><br />What will Peter choose? The love of a woman, or her life? It is an impossible choice, and replete with danger either way.<br /><br />The transition between comic book and movie screen has never been as smooth. Ang Lee's "Hulk," had no depth, just as Christopher Reeve's "Superman." Fun? Yes, but neither were great movies. "Spiderman 2" is a great movie.<br /><br />We forget who are the actors. Kirsten Dunst as girl-next-door Mary Jane Watson is fantastic, being beautiful and ordinary simultaneously. Rosemary Harris looks as much as like Aunt May as anyone could. Finally, Tobey Maguire is so perfectly cast as Peter Parker, that all is seamless.<br /><br />I fully recommend Spiderman 2. I'm ready for "Spiderman 3," and hope the producers realize that there is enough good Spiderman material to make another five movies as good as this.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br /><br />editor, HungarianBookstore.com</p></br><a href="../users/AWG2O9C42XW5G.html">AWG2O9C42XW5G</a><br/><p>Okay, i love spider-Man 1, But spider-man 2 has one of the most Coolest of the Spider-man villians in it.

And, on your about you page, if you say you're so smart, how come YOU CAN'T SPELL HARVARD CORRECTLY?</p></br><a href="../users/A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK.html">A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK</a><br/><p>"Spider-Man" was one of the best superhero movies ever made; perhaps somewhat short of movies such as "Superman" and "Batman," but worthy of being grouped with these two movies.  "Spider-Man 2" is even better than "Spider-Man" and raises the superhero movie bar.<br /><br />Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is now in college, trying to hold a part time job as a pizza delivery boy while also being a superhero and still taking the occasional photograph for J. Jonah Jameson (played to perfection by J.K. Simmons).  Threaded through all this is his deep love for Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst).  Unfortunately Peter is failing at nearly everything, even the superhero part.  Because Peter feels as though he must be a superhero first, he often delivers pizza late.  He is often late to class, and he still is unable to tell Mary Jane that he loves her.  To add insult to injury, Peter's powers are on the fritz from all the stress he is under.  In short, Peter's life is a disaster in slow motion.<br /><br />In addition to all the other stress Peter is under, Aunt May is being forced to move from her home.  Perhaps the single biggest reason for that is the death of Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson), which was partially Peter's fault and for which he continues to feel guilt.<br /><br />Peter is getting near a low when he goes to a demonstration by Doctor Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina) of a new technique for creating fusion.  As part of his technique, Dr. Octavius has created a unique set of arms that allow him to directly manipulate the fusion process.  The arms have their own built in artificial intelligence that will enable Dr. Octavius to more easily control them.  Dr. Octavius is asked how he will keep the artificial intelligence (AI) from controlling him once the arms tap into his nervous system.  He explains that there is a specially designed chip that blocks the AI from taking over his brain.<br /><br />Dr. Octavius begins the experiment, which goes horribly awry, killing his wife Rosalie (Donna Murphy), and nearly killing Harry Osborn (James Franco), who was saved, barely, by Spider-Man.  However, Harry still hates Spider-Man and what he did to his father Norman Osborn, aka Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe), and once the AI arms take over Dr. Octavius's brain, Harry agrees to provide Doc Ock, aka Dr. Octopus (his new improved name with the extra limbs), with tritium in exchange for Doc Ock bringing Spider-Man to him.  The reason that Doc Ock needs the tritium is to create another fusion generator.  Unfortunately, the fusion generator needs a lot more perfection, and if he succeeds the design has the potential of destroying far more than the city.<br /><br />As you can perceive, there is a significant amount of complexity in this movie.  However, Director Sam Raimi manages to keep the elements coherent and believable.  While there was a point where I wondered how much lower Peter Parker could go before losing it all together, and I started to get a little frustrated with the constant depression he faced, the deep angst provided an excellent contrast as Peter slowly overcame his problems.  It is the depth of character development that makes this movie different from "Superman" and "Batman."  While "Superman" touched on Clark Kent's difficulties in being a person as well as a superhero, the focus of the movie was on his powers.  "Batman" did a much better job of character development, but even then the principal focus was on the one event in Bruce Wayne's life that caused him to become the Batman.<br /><br />In "Spider-Man 2" we see someone a lot like us, a person that has not only bad days, but perhaps bad years, where nothing seems to go right.  But we also see Spider-Man figuratively pick himself up, mentally challenge himself to overcome his problems, and do exactly that.  While Peter's life will never be perfect, for a superhero and a human, it may be somewhat normal.<br /><br />I am typically ambivalent regarding special feature versions on DVD that contain two discs because the second disc is often not worth the price.  However, in the case of this release there are a number of interesting features worth watching for those who appreciate the technology behind the special effects.  I was particularly fascinated by how the Dr. Octopus's arms were animated.  The blooper reel (which had a few funny moments but also had a number of not-so-funny moments) showed Alfred Molina trying to take a drink provided by one of his mechanical arms; a good trick once perfected sufficiently to appear in the movie.  There are numerous other features to show how some of the more interesting effects were created.<br /><br />Historically, it has been difficult to bring comic book heroes to life.  Technology has been one of the biggest barriers, and has made it easier to create animated characters than live characters.  Now that technology has overcome much of that hurdle, the next difficulty is to make the characters human.  This movie has focused significant effort on developing Peter Parker as a young adult with all the normal problems of a young adult, with the added difficulty of being a superhero.  While some may cringe at how real life is for Peter, with the incredible angst created by all his problems, others will applaud the excellent translation from modern comics to the big screen.  Tobey Maguire, Sam Raimi, and the excellent supporting cast have made Spider-Man seem real.  In the process of making Spider-Man real they have also created a sequel greater than the original, and created a movie worthy of joining "Superman" and "Batman" was a landmark superhero movie that is destined to become a classic.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MS6UV7ZGTMLR.html">A2MS6UV7ZGTMLR</a><br/><p>"With great power comes great responsibility". Director Sam Raimi, Screenwriter Alvin Sargent, and the Spider-Man Producers all seem to appreciate this fact. Following the runaway success, both critically and commercially, of the original film, in Spider-Man 2 they have expertly crafted an exciting action film, with surprising depth. As Raimi and Sargent have chosen to focus on their characters and story as much as the amazing SFX and action sequences, the end result is a plot-driven, roller-coaster ride filled with action, suspense, drama, and romance.<br /><br />The very talented and creative Stan Lee created Spider-Man for Marvel Comics. (Lee is also responsible for the Fantastic Four, the X-Men, Iron Man, and the Hulk). Spider-Man made his debut in 1962 in a comic book series - Amazing Fantasy 15. Spider-Man was immediately popular, and the series was quickly renamed Amazing Spider-Man. Indeed, the growing popularity of Spider-Man helped Marvel Comics to become the dominant comic-book publisher by the early 1970s.<br /><br />In 2002, Spider-Man: The Motion Picture came to the big screen. With a cumulative box office gross of over $US800 million, Spider-Man happily sits in the Top 10 of all-time box-office films. Apart from its great commercial success, Spider-Man was also warmly greeted by critics and comic-book fans alike.<br /><br />A long-time Spider-Man fan, Raimi, and star Tobey Maguire had both contracted for three Spider-Man films (before the script for the first one was even written), so following the success of the first film, sequels were inevitable.<br /><br />Thus, the arrival of Spider-Man 2 was not a surprise. Spider-Man 2 also earning a place in the all-time Top Ten Box Office films was also not a surprise. The amazing CGI, visual effects and SFX generally in the sequel were not a surprise. Furthermore, the breath-taking stunts and gripping action set pieces were not a surprise either. What was surprising about Spider-Man 2 was the depth of the story and characters.<br /><br />What I, and I imagine most people, love about Peter Parker/Spider-Man is that despite being a super hero, he is spared none of the problems of ordinary life: He has ups and downs with his friends, family, and employers. He struggles to get or keep a girlfriend. He gets sick and he definitely gets tired. A bit of a geek, he's "intelligent but lazy". A genuine nice guy, with a good sense of humour. Indeed, he's often referred to as "your friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man". Peter's an ordinary young bloke, with an amazing gif, which he chooses, with great responsibility, to use for the good of humanity.<br /><br />In Spider-Man 2 we find Peter (Tobey Maguire) at the end of his tether. He's struggling to hold on to his job, pay the rent, and pass his exams. Furthermore, he seems to be losing his Spider-Man powers. And, the love of his life, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), is engaged to another man. To make matter worse, his best friend, Harry Osborn (James Franco), blames Spider-Man for his father's death, and is seeking revenge, and Peter's Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) is about to be kicked out of her house.<br /><br />A strong theme in Spider-Man 2 is choice: Consumed by insecurity and inner turmoil, the strain of being a super-hero permanently on call is taking its toll. Peter's secret identity is a weight on his shoulders that he no longer wishes to bear. Peter must choose between what he wants to do and what he feels he must do.<br /><br />Instead of creating a stand-alone film, Raimi has opted to further explore the characters and relationships he set up in the first film. All the main characters in Spider-Man 2 have dreams: Peter dreams of an ordinary life where he can pursue his love for Mary Jane, and his love of science and photography; Mary Jane dreams of success as an actress, and of being happily married; and Dr. Otto Octavius dreams of creating a new energy source through fusion. And this brings us to our villain . . .<br /><br />Every hero is measured by their nemesis, the villain, and unlike the Hulk, Spider-Man 2 is not all soul-searching. Dr. Otto Octavius (a wonderfully restrained and subtle performance by Alfred Molina) is a good-hearted and genius scientific researcher, working for Oscorp. Peter admires Octavius, just as he did Norman Osborn (before Osborn became the Green Goblin). Octavius dreams of creating cheap renewable electricity through fusion. Tragically, his fusion experiment goes horribly wrong, killing Octavius' devoted wife, and leaving him with four robotic tentacles ("actuators") fused into his spinal cord. The evil AI of the actuators soon begin controlling Octavius, and the mild mannered scientist degenerates into Doc Oct, a cruel, selfish man, driven by vengeance, and hell-bent on achieving his fusion dream no matter what the costs.<br /><br />As for the DVD,the quality of the movie and its transfer, and the breadth of extras, easily make this one of the best DVD releases of 2004.</p></br><a href="../users/A77184QJM3PM.html">A77184QJM3PM</a><br/><p>Ok, I realize I'm in the vast minority here, but I really wasn't that impressed with this film. I felt the whole thing dragged along, until the few action sequences, which were short. The CGI, in my opinion, really wasn't too great, some scenes were just too un-realistic to carry alot of weight. One problem I had with the first film which carried over to this one through most of it was Peter Parker shutting out Mary Jane, "for her own saftey". Was I the only one in the entire world who felt this was totally rediculous? The second film, at the end, seemed to resolve this, until the last fade-out. The look on Mary Jane's face left me with an unsatisfied feeling. I felt Doc Ock to be well-done and well-acted, but the descent into insanity seemed a bit contrived and fast. Overall, the study of what a person must sacrifice for an ideal is touching, but perhaps too deeply involved here. This is a superhero movie after all, not a session on a shrinks' couch. Hopefully the third film in this series will better display what spidey fans have loved about the charactor for years, and be a worthy film at the same time.</p></br><a href="../users/A1RSXP7MB772E3.html">A1RSXP7MB772E3</a><br/><p>Widescreen is a fad, that's not just a fad. The letter box screen opens your eyes, a normal format seems like a blinder, blocking your peripheral. It sucks for those who own small televisions, but even still, buy this version. You never know when you'll upgrade (you poor, sweet things.) This film came as a surprise to me. Although It shouldn't be. Raimi is a proven director, at least to me. The casting is appropriate, Thanks goodness all of them signed on again. Toby is known to have trouble opening up on the screen. He's naturally quiet I hear. But I don't agree. In cider house rules you see a disturbed querry in his performance. In Spidey 1, he grew in physical bearing, and he pulled off a convincing teenager. I mean, you won't hear him being nominated for an Oscar any time soon, but who does with these sort of movies. Best actor's always are won by the less popular roles, Like that of the disabled. The second installment says hello to a hero that is bothered by stress. And even Super Hero's crack under stress! His hidden passions dibilitate his web slingings. If only he would just open up more, Peter that is. A great action flick with a dramatic zest. Personally, I was expecting the Hob goblin for this movie. Will you see him next movie?-jeff</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>Oscar needs to get off his snooty horse and acknowledge a truly excellent and worthy film.  SPIDER-MAN 2 has everything a good movie should have:  a marvelous cast; superb direction; awesome and incredible effects; a great score; and a well written plot.  Toby Maguire and Kirsten Dunst give their characters a welcome sense of realness and one can't help but feel for them:  poor Peter can't be on time for anything; being Spider-Man interferes with everything in his life:  his job, his education, and most importantly, his relationship with Mary Jane.  Dunst meanwhile is not only stunning physically, but she is a darned good actress, giving Mary Jane just the right amount of naivete and spunk.  A supporting actor and actress nod should go to Alfred Molina and Rosemary Harris.  Molina is the perfect villain as the incredibly designed Doctor Ock!  He uses his impressive acting abilities to bring both compassion and hatred.  Ms. Harris is beautiful as Peter's Aunt May.  A seasoned theatrical and movie actress, Harris embodies the essence of paternal and familial love.  J. K. Simmons as Peter's editor boss is outrageously campy and brilliant.  James Franco as Harry gives a good performance, but his character is getting annoying and redundant---although it looks like he might be around as a villain in the third.<br /><br />The movie has breathtaking action scenes, including the one on the train, but all of them are mindboggling.<br /><br />SPIDER-MAN 2 is what moviemaking is all about and fun as hell to boot!  Bravo Sam Raimi!!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A152C8GYY25HAH.html">A152C8GYY25HAH</a><br/><p>"Spiderman 2" is a marvelous action-adventure, sci-fi thriller which won't please everyone because it emphasizes story over action. There is plenty of action, of course, but much of the movie dwells on the loneliness, alienation and complexity of its hero, Peter Parker/Spiderman. Its premise is that being a hero has its price - a theme which everyone from the ancient Greeks to Shakespeare and beyond has written about. It also employs the idea that greatness is often thrust upon an unwilling participant and plays havoc with such a person's personal life.<br /><br />The movie's screenplay employs the "Gone With the Wind/Titanic" approach. These movies had as much story as action. They were the most successful films of their time.<br /><br />There is -and always has been - a portion of the audience which demands all action all of the time. For these viewers, "Spiderman 2" is a disappointment. It's not in the "Independence Day/Starship Troopers/The Day After Tomorrow" format, in which the characters are cardboard ones who exist only to move the action along.<br /><br />Tobey Macguire reprises his role as Spiderman. He is perfect. Something tells me that Macguire is a bit perplexed by the fact that he has become known as one of the great actors of his generation, much like Spiderman is confused by his powers.<br /><br />This episode finds Parker down on his luck and depressed. There are no great villains for him to fight. He's still madly in love with MJ [Kirsten Dunst] but is afraid to show his feelings because he knows that his enemies could harm her if they knew of his feelings for her. Harry Osborn [James Franco] is remains his best friend but does not know that Parker as Spiderman killed Osborn's mad scientist father in the first movie.  Finally, another madman comes to the rescue - Dock Ork [Alfred Molina], yet another scientist taken hostage by his own overly ambitious science project.<br /><br />Full enjoyment of this sequel requires one to see the original, because so much of the story hinges on knowledge of what happened in the first film.<br /><br />My main criticism of "Spiderman 2" is that the ending is a blatant setup for "Spiderman 3". Otherwise, it's a greatly entertaining endeavor.</p></br><a href="../users/A1I9B4PSCDDWOO.html">A1I9B4PSCDDWOO</a><br/><p>Spider-Man 2 proves to be a very entertaining movie. The movie takes off basically from where it left on the first movie. I think the plot suffered because there really isn't a real story here. All the main characters and even the minor ones appears to be very confused about themselves. Peter Parker played by Toby Maguire proves to such a loser in civilian life, it almost pathetic. Peter Parker spent much of this movie confused about whether he wants to be Spider-Man or not. I supposes that is why he make such a good Spiderman. Kristen Dunst plays Mary Ann Watson proves to be beautiful but she's confused throughout the movie on whether she loves Peter or the other guy. James Franco who played Harry Osborn still regards Peter as his best buddy but regards him with hostility because he thinks Peter is buddy with Spider-Man. This character is totally twisted all over. Alfred Molina who played the main villian, Dr. Octopus, is pretty good. But he too, like the other characters, remains confused on whether he wants to be good or bad.  Even Jonah Jameson goes from anti-Spider-Man to pro-Spider-Man and back again. The entire movie appears to be populated with very confused characters. <p>What works is the special effects, action scenes and interaction between our confused characters. For a guy who likes to keep his secret identity secret, Toby Maguire's character spent a lot of time wearing that costume without his mask on. Why cheapen the character by showing us the actor's face all the time?? (Does Sam Raimi believed that Toby Maguire is so handsome that his face deserves more exposure??) But its a motion picture comic book, so everything work out in the end and as long as you don't think too hard about the movie, it should be quite enjoyable for everyone.</p></br><a href="../users/A9LAPV8XNKZVZ.html">A9LAPV8XNKZVZ</a><br/><p>The action is good, but the relationships are more interesting.

With the tone looking darker and one of the greatest comic book villains Dr Octopus finally gracing the screen, this will surely be one of the biggest films of 2004. The countdown begins...</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZO30Z16MQ7Y7.html">A1ZO30Z16MQ7Y7</a><br/><p>Before everyone goes all crazy on me because I did not like this movie, just know that I really tried and wanted to like it. Okay now, on to the review. I'm a big fan of the 50's cartoons( I so want that new box set!). It had a very good taste to it. As the years went by and the cartoon series got older( around the end of the 80's), it began to lose it's touch. I was hoping Sony would make this movie more like the 50's cartoons instead of the first one but it looks like they went there own way. What's the problem? Tobey Maguire can't act, the villain is laughable(wach the ending), you don't care about Maguire and Dunst relationship, not enough Spidey action, and you spend half the film laughing at Tobey Maguire facial exspressions(wach the train seane!!!!). Dunst is the ONLY good person at acting, well, the guy who played the villain was good to, but besids that, no one can act. I was hoping we would get a better film from the guy who made Evil Dead and Darkman. oh well, I guess every one has there flops. Now before you start complaying that I'm wrong this film is good, or that guy is full of it, please first know that I tried hard to like this movie, I really did.

Until X-Men<br /><br />There's no denying that the success of the X-Men film and Marvel's documented financial difficulties are what allowed the studios to get their claws into these franchises and while Hulk and Daredevil may have been disappointments, Stan Lee was never going to let his flagship character suffer the same fate.<br /><br />Spider Man 1 was, in my opinion, the best superhero movie I had seen. The character stuck to the comic books, with a few minor exceptions(the webbing being the one that really bent the fanatics noses out of joint). The temptation to cast a Tom Cruise or Brad Pitt in the role was held at bay and some relatively unknown supporting members proved to be great in the from of Osbourne Jnr and Jameson.<br /><br />This was a sequel that had a lot to live up to... And boy did it deliver! Again, some of the origins were messed with, we all know Doc Ock was never a humanitarian or 'controlled' by his claws, he was evil of his own free will. Regardless, Molina was excellent as the villain, McGuire was still the dork he should have been and his wrestling with his alter ego really gave the movie the depth it needed.<br /><br />What makes Spiderman 2 a great movie is, not just the action sequences, but the realistic and believable relationships between the characters, with the exception of Jameson who is a welcome dose of 'over the top'. Osbourne's hatred for spider man slowly poisoning his friendship with Parker, Parker's love for MJ which he is forced to hide and MJ's pained frustration at Parker's refusal to open up, all add to the action we expect of this sort of movie.<br /><br />Then there is the action. Acrobatics, explosions, runaway trains, fights atop skyscrapers... This has them all. The set pieces are breathtaking and Spidey gets more than as good as he gets from Doctor Octopus. Molina may have been a less than orthodox action man, and the slight paunch evident at points supports that, but he pulled the role off magnificently.<br /><br />In wrapping up this review all I can say is the Spider Man 3 has some big boots to fill as this was a film that deserved all the box office records it broke and the DVD has some extras that really make it stand out as well</p></br><a href="../users/A2Z7TU96G2WB9B.html">A2Z7TU96G2WB9B</a><br/><p>This is another fine addition to the saga of Peter Parker.  Additions tend to underperform when the sequels are an afterthought.  The previous film felt like a complete story, but it seemed to leave open the story for this film.  After watching this film, the viewer knows (especially if the viewer is a fan of the story already) that there are many stories still to come.<br /><br />The story again touches on the theme of responsibility.  Peter is still struggling to accept that he has to sacrifice the things he wants because of the responsibility that comes with his superpowers.  He wants a normal life and wants the proverbial girl, but he must stand between the bad guys and the people of New York City.  Alfred Molina, in a great turn as Doctor Octopus, gives Peter a lesson and example in accepting responsibility.<br /><br />The writers have left several hints of future stories.  First, we see J. Jonah Jameson's son the astronaut.  Second, we see Dr. Connors teaching one of Peter Parker's classes.  For a comics fan, I can't wait to see the movie versions of these characters in the future.<br /><br />The film's focus is on Peter Parker's coming to grips with his responsibility and does not show as much of Doctor Octopus as I may have liked, but this is still a fine story.  I would recommend seeing this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3F3B6HY9RJI04.html">A3F3B6HY9RJI04</a><br/><p>Spiderman has always been a great comic.  Not because Spiderman was the most powerful superhero, but because he was one of the most human characters.  And this movie does not neglect to show this one bit.<br /><br />Peter Parker has many concerns, and most of them are because of his alter-ego, Spiderman.  He can't give the attention he wants to give the girl he loves.  His best friend doesn't trust him because of his affiliation with Spiderman.  He can't keep a job.  He isn't doing well in school.  All because being Spiderman is a full-time and often thankless job.  So, he is faced with the possibility of making his life easier by leaving his crime-fighting days behind him.<br /><br />Worst of all, he is still burdened with the fact that it was his fault that his Uncle Ben was murdered, and this is a heavy burden to carry and not share with others.<br /><br />And then there is the Spiderman side of this wonderful story.  Spiderman has a new enemy by a scientist turned mad-man with four metal and indestructible arms bent on recreating an invention that could destroy the city.<br /><br />The action is incredible.  The story is fantastic.  You care and feel for the characters.  This movie is unforgettable and nearly unmatchable.  You've gotta catch this movie if you are one of the few who haven't yet.</p></br></body></html>

For instance, Prince Edward's character is totally against the historical facts, and I'm surprised the royal family didn't have a hissie fit!<br />But, that aside, what emerges is a taut, somewhat psychedelic look at the heinous crimes of one Jack the Ripper.<br />The direction is good, but at times, there was some difficulty in understanding a lot of the accents.  The art direction and set decoration, costuming, and music are brilliant.  What a horrible vision they painted of Londin the late nineteenth century.<br />I think Johnny Depp has done some really good work, including "Sleepy Hollow", but I found him a bit ineffective in this leading role.  His levels were forced, and he never really looked like he was truly in his role.<br />Heather Graham, in spite of her bad accent, still managed to offer a charming aspect to the life she had chosen.  I believed her most of the time, and was impressed with her performance.<br />Ian Holm, as always, was awesome.  This actor has done so much good work over the years, it's hard to see how he has not won an Oscar yet.  Remember him in "Alien"---wow!  Here, he portrays a retired doctor who offers help to Depp in understanding the Ripper's killings.<br />Robbie Coltrane, also a vastly underrated actor, steals the scenes from Depp.  He conveyed not only his masculine side, but also his sensitive side, particularly in his relationship with Depp.<br />However, to me, the true stars of this movie were the ladies who portrayed the hookers.  None of them were really "beautiful" or even "sexy."  They looked like a bunch of fishwives done up in tight dresses with bodices exhibiting much cleavage.  But these ladies convinced me of their sordid lives and how much they really didn't like it.  Hats off to Katrin Cartlidge, Susan Lynch, Lesley Sharp, Estelle Kornik, Annabell Apsion, Joanna Page and Samantha Spiro.  They did fine work.  Also very good was Jason Flemyng in the role of the cab driver, Netley.<br />Overall, a good flick with much to recommend it.<br />RECOMMEND.</p></br><a href="../users/A1M4NJYP0WNL8Q.html">A1M4NJYP0WNL8Q</a><br/><p>In the catalog of unsolved murders, the crimes of Jack the Ripper reign supreme.  In all probability, they have inspired more speculation and creative work than have all the others combined.  Inspired by a graphic novel series, this effort by the Hughes brothers is another in a long history of productions, each seeking to draw us into the terrors of a century past, leaving us once again chilled and bemused.<p>One of the things that set 'From Hell' apart is its efforts at authenticity.  Costumes, characters and locale are minutely recreated.  We are granted a long glance into the squalid realities of life in places like Whitechapel with very little candy coating.  The conflicts between the bleak lives of London's prostitutes and the posh upper classes underline the fact that whatever the real motivation for the crimes, they were also symptomatic of a deeply divided culture.  Characters like Inspector Fred Abberline (Johnny Depp) must tread the borders of both realms seeing only the worst that either has to offer.<p>It is only fitting that Abberline is a frequent user of opium who often has 'visions' that show him glimpses of the crimes.  Fitting, because his opponent, the killer also lives in a dream world of his own.  Abberline is a spectator forced to witness the inexorable artwork of the madman, desperately trying to puzzle out the motivations that set his nightmares in motion.  We the onlookers shift out viewpoints from killer, to investigator, to victim, and beyond.  For all that we have more information than Abberline; we come no closer to a solution.<p>Depp gives Abberline a certain fragility that contrasts with both the characters of the prostitutes he is struggling to save (led by Heather Graham as Mary Kelly) and the overwhelming self-confidence of those he serves.  As such he is a bit of a phantom when compared to the likes of Sir William Gull (Ian Holm).  This works quite well given that Abberline's own story can only begin to peak as The Ripper's draws to a close.  <p>The film's explanation of the murders is one popular with many Ripper aficionados, and has been used in films before.  The Hughes do find a way to twist this in their own way at the end, providing a bit of a surprise for the most jaded.  While the production has more than its share of the grim and gory, the Hughes rarely indulge in purely gratuitous violence.  Horror, when it comes, is swift and sure.  We are not so much frightened as kept in a state of nervous anticipation.<p>The two discs of this set provide a beneficence of additional materials.  Features about everything from Ripperology to the use of Absinthe.  There is a tour of the recreated Whitechapel and full-length commentaries on the film.  The Hughes brothers really did go to extremes in their production and the extras provide much insight into compulsive filmmaking.</p></br><a href="../users/A3OMPSEVL59ZDK.html">A3OMPSEVL59ZDK</a><br/><p>Just a few points that have already been reiterated throughout most of these reviews.<p>1)Beautiful Cinematography<p>2)Johnny Depp. It may appear to be the same role he did in Sleepy Hallow BUT the man can act.<p>3)Great Directors<p>Now I was surprised at what a complete gore fest this movie was. It's so maniacly fun, more of a slasher pic then a thriller. I took me completely by surprise at how far they went with this pic, at times bordering on NC17 type gore. Great stuff. Definetly check it out. And the mystery of who Jack was will get you through between the killings. <p>A Bloody Good film.</p></br><a href="../users/A39C7SEMCJWVOI.html">A39C7SEMCJWVOI</a><br/><p>FROM HELL is a film that tells the story of 'Jack the Ripper,' a serial killer who killed female prostitutes in London, England<br />back in 1888. Johnny Depp plays a police detective who has psychic visions of 'Jack the Ripper' committing his crimes even before they happen and he plans on tracking the killer down and discovering his true identity. This film will keep you guessing till the very end, and it will shock you when the when the identity of 'Jack the Ripper' is revealed! This is a good movie for those people who like movies with horror, suspense, and thrills.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>I bought this purely for Johnny Depp, and it did sound like an interesting story. Right at the start, there's a lovely shot of Johnny's eyes, but when you hear people getting stabbed, it's so realistic, and so horrible! Sends shivers up your spine. There are a few familiar faces in this - Lesley Sharpe, Robbie Coltrane &amp; Ian Holm. <p>The soundtrack is quite haunting and creepy, although the bit which really sticks out in my mind, is the heartbeat which appears faintly in the background when Johnny appears on screen, and steadily gets louder. It's a brilliant sound effect to use.<p>The one thing I noticed about Johnny's character (Inspector Fred Abberline) was that he seemed to be reprising his role of Ichabod Crane in Sleepy Hollow. Very similar characters. His English accent is surprisingly good, considering some of the other actors who have tried and failed in the past. (Not naming any names, but Keanu Reeves springs to mind!)<p>There's some lovely shots in this including close ups of Johnny's eyes, a cracking shot of Big Ben against a red sky, and the whole film seems to capture the essence of London in 1888 perfectly.<p>Heather Graham (Mary Kelly) has always annoyed me as an actress, for no particular reason, and I tend to avoid films with her in them. The red hair in this was a big mistake, she's very pale skinned to begin with, and the redness washes her out even more.<p>To begin with, it was hard to work out whether the character played by Robbie Coltrane was superior to Johnny's character. Later we find out that he was a sergeant. He plays the part of a sarcastic, temperamental policeman, a role which he is well known for, and particularly good at. <p>The film is an 18, due to a couple of scenes. The scenes where the `unfortunates' "livelihood" is removed, is particularly disgusting, and not a pleasant image to have in your head. You just need to see the reactions in the film to feel nauseous. Also the scene where a girl's throat gets cut is really graphic, and I thought Murron's throat in Braveheart getting cut was bad! This is much, much worse!<p>The ending of this totally threw my opinion of the entire film. Up until then, the film had been good. From Hell is a film about Jack the Ripper, but the Hughes brothers (Coen brothers, Wachowski brothers and now the Hughes brothers!) provided their own solution to the Jack the Ripper mystery. This has been an unproven and unsolved mystery, so I didn't like how they decided to "solve" the mystery. It should have been left well alone. It seems like they wanted to wind up the story, so chose any random character to be Jack the Ripper. It doesn't work. <p>This isn't really a horror movie, more a dramatisation, and there was a lack of tension as a thriller. Definitely a must-see for Johnny Depp fans, and people interested in the Jack the Ripper mystery - although the ending doesn't really match the rest of the film. And the ending is also sad!</p></br><a href="../users/A1XX5797TIZT5Q.html">A1XX5797TIZT5Q</a><br/><p>Despite all the negative reviews, I really liked this film.  Sure, the material isn't new, but for once it's refreshing to see a story that's so blatantly in the realm of the exploitation film being tackled by A-list talent in Hollywood style.<p>The Hughes brothers have a gift for implementing extremely stylish techniques without seeming show-offy.  The &quot;absinthe&quot; visions in the film as experienced by Johnny Depp's character serve to enhance the mood rather than show off the latest cinematic trick.  The Hugheses do seem fond of extremely graphic violence as seen in Dead Presidents; in From Hell, when a cop says a victim is &quot;in pieces&quot;, the directors show no mercy in sparing you the sight.  However, the highly grisly content has a purpose -- it deprives you of the sense of safety that a &quot;polite&quot; shooting style often yields, and it also blends the two ideas of social decay and aristocratic decadence which both the story and the cinematography express.<p>Depp does a fine job here, though the role of Inspector Abberline isn't exactly his most challenging.  But he is sympathetic and charismatic, projecting intelligence and a troubled psyche.  Heather Graham looks ravishingly beautiful, and I didn't have a huge problem with her accent -- certainly leagues above Julia Roberts' feeble attempt in Michael Collins.  Depp and Graham make for a great pair onscreen, and the screenplay has enough good lines to keep you interested throughout.  Ian Holm does walk off with the film, though, as supra-genius surgeon Sir William Gull.<br />For me, the only truly weak point of the film is the endless scenes with the streetwalkers.  They are a pretty colourful bunch, and there are some highly talented actresses in their midst -- including Katrin Cartlidge and Lesley Sharp, both of Mike Leigh's Naked, Estelle Skornik, and Susan Lynch, who did a marvellous job in the film Nora.  But the scenes with them are so repetitive that the film's pacing suffers.<p>Small gripe, though -- with amazing lighting and design (including painstakingly accurate recreations of the murder sites), good performances and a nice sense of forward momentum, this film is a good (and lavish) addition to the Jack the Ripper canon.</p></br><a href="../users/AW3VZ5O895LRK.html">AW3VZ5O895LRK</a><br/><p>This film just misses being a classic.  The effects are fabulous so if effects were all, it would have made it.  And Johnny Depp does his usual first class acting job.  Some are complaining that his accent wasn't authentic but I could hear and understand every word he said which I probably couldn't have if he'd used a genuine Cockney accent.  I think the factor that causes this film to just miss classic status is that the villain is just too far over the top.  This weird thing they do to his eyes, for one, is way too offputting.  I imagine special lenses were inserted into his eyes for this effect.  It is the one effect I could have done without.  This is the story of a detective (Depp) on the trail of Jack the Ripper as he murders prostitutes in Victorian England with Jack being the villain of the piece.  Heather Graham does a nice job playing one of the prostitutes.</p></br><a href="../users/A15TNUM2PBS6F0.html">A15TNUM2PBS6F0</a><br/><p>"From Hell" is another rendition of the famous story of "Jack The Ripper". This time it's stylishly directed by two brothers, the Hughes Brothers.  This is such a different work of film from their earlier efforts, "Dead Presidents" and "Menace II Society".<p>The story of Jack the ripper is an interesting one, and it is told very well here.  It is suspenseful, creepy, and gory. However, it is also an extremely well crafted work.  The acting and directing are outstanding. Johnny Depp and Heather Graham are the only names here, but overall the acting is superb. This is a must see for all Depp fans. I think this is his second best work, his first being "Blow".<br />If you have never seen any films depicting Jack the Ripper, this would be a great choice for the first.  It is a creepy old tale and it's spun really well here.<br />Johnny Depp, plays the inspector who is trying to find out who is the ripper, and he turns in a magnificent performance here.<br />He also has a full grasp of the English accent, which I was very impressed with.  He is very underrated as an actor, and I think he is one of the best actors in films.<br />This is a great vehicle for him.<br />Highly recommended!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A329U9CDUPKXAC.html">A329U9CDUPKXAC</a><br/><p>I've always been fascinated by Jack the Ripper so I figured this movie would be great. Too bad it lacked a strong story and good direction. Sure the imagery is beautiful but the characters are often stiff and lifeless. The story drags on a bit. It moves too slow and the ending is unsatisfying. Johnny Depp does not appear to be the great investigator you'd expect in this movie and Jack the Ripper fails to frighten even the towns people. It's not what I expected.</p></br><a href="../users/A2H1WNB30JNAWU.html">A2H1WNB30JNAWU</a><br/><p>From Hell was a very good Deep movie and Graham did a great supporting role helping Deep out with the case of the Ripper.  The movie itself was good also in the fact that you felt as if you were there in that time period with the buildings and clothing so forth.  If you like your history and a good very good horror movie with lots of drama elements thrown into the mix then pick this movie up for some good acting and a good horror movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1S8AJIUIO6M9K.html">A1S8AJIUIO6M9K</a><br/><p>No one needs my review of this superb film, this annotation is just a marker for those who follow my generally non-fiction reading and viewing.<br /><br />Johnny Depp has become an icon for me, a brand name.  One of my teenagers brought this home and I put it on background while doing paperwork, but the TV is above my desktop and I watched every single minute, stopping as necessary when leaving the room.<br /><br />I admire the reviewer that has researched Jack the Ripper more deeply and tells us that we have been let off the worst of the worst.  That's fine by me.  Between Johnny Depp's performance, the other stars in the cast, the over-all screenplay and the period depiction, this was simply a fine offering.<br /><br />I might offer that Heather Graham shows great promise, brining to mind such stars as Jodie Foster and Julianne Moore.<br /><br />I'd like to see more reviewers use the "Insert a Product Link" that Amazon offers, instead of just typing out the name of a book or DVD.<br /><br />Here are some examples:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F7CECK">The Libertine</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I0RQVI">Pirates of the Caribbean - Dead Man's Chest (Widescreen Edition)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1841193976">The Complete History of Jack the Ripper</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1554045274">A Study in Red: The Secret Journal of Jack the Ripper</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1602396663">The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Companion: An Illustrated Encyclopedia</a></p></br><a href="../users/A185QFJRTB5W93.html">A185QFJRTB5W93</a><br/><p>Overall a nice twist on the tale of Jack the Ripper.

Not only was Michael Caine outstanding in the role, but that version offered convincing speculation into a mystery that we will never know all the answers to.<br /><br />While I respect this version with Johnny Depp in the role as a great horror flick, it is not nearly as historical as Caine's. (History is to some extent sacrificed for Horror and to some extent Romance.) Some of you may know the Ripper's 5 victims. (Mary Anne Nichols, Annie Chapman, Elizabeth Stride, kathy Eadows, and Mary Jane Kelly) Well, they have a close friendship, and we get the impression that they share some dangerous secret. (In the Michael Caine version, they knew each other, but they were just associates.)<br /><br />Well, of course, Jack the Ripper comes into play. One scene is well done in that while we don't see his face, we do see some disturbing pictures, and we do see him cutting steak and pouring a dark red wine. In comes Depp (Inspector Fred Abberline.) it is interesting that while the older Michael Caine brought frustration and tremendous energy to the role, Depp makes him look morose and like he is going to die any day. (Perhaps Depp did not want to just imitate Michael Caine.)<br /><br />One thing I have some trouble with is that while Caine had some trouble with his superiors, we could understand Caine's superiors views to some extent. here, it is obvious that Depp's superiors are getting frustrated with him while they are obviously keeping things from him. At least Caine's superiors carried some reason on their side.<br /><br />You'll probably notice that Depp finds things out quicker than Caine did. (Caine had 4 hours. Depp only has 2.) While Caine was involved with an artist, Depp becomes involved with the eventual 5th victim Mary Jane Kelly. Depp of course discovers things that eventually start completeing a puzzle. Like Caine did in his version, Depp ironically gets close and friendly to the killer (obviously without knowing he is talking to the killer).<br /><br />One slight problem I have is that in the Caine version, we can understand more why the killer appeared normal and even offered helpful advice. In this version, it seems strange that the killer is friendly to Depp and offers help. (Jack the Ripper does not have the same split personality here that he did in the Caine version.)<br /><br />I will admit that the scenery is well done, the elements of horror are there, an Depp did a great job of not just imitating Michael Caine. And Depp's Sergeant Godley does offer some entertainment. But if you saw the Michael Caine version, you will undoubtedly miss the probable historical accuracy. On the other hand, this version is geared more towards horror. (So if that is what you want, you won't be disappointed.)<br /><br />SIDE NOTE: Johnny Depp makes Inspector Fred Abberline look like he is going to die any day. In history, he lived on for 40 more years after he stopped Jack the Ripper.</p></br><a href="../users/ASIA7V7CBSKD3.html">ASIA7V7CBSKD3</a><br/><p>A Great film about the world's first serial killer.  Crafted in a way that some part of the film it is hard to distinguish between Hollywood Glam and Historical Fact.  Very entertaining and Johnny Depp reveals an excellent English accent (which can at times be heard in his "Jack Sparrow" voice).  Also, for those looking to be entertained by stories similiar to "the Da Vinci Code," checkout "From Hell" as the Freemasons make an appearance.</p></br><a href="../users/A2T7TZBOTP68C7.html">A2T7TZBOTP68C7</a><br/><p>From Hell explores a theory about the identity of the infamous 19th-century serial killer Jack the Ripper.  Facts about the over a hundred year-old actual crime have unfortunately been lost. Many different theories exist as to who Jack the Ripper was.  From Hell explores a newer theory that came about in the 1970's, when old documents were discovered.  It is the "Royal Conspiracy Theory."  The idea is that Prince Albert had an illegitimate child with a London street prostitute, whom he secretly married.  When the royal house found out, measures were taken to silence her and her whore friends, who were witnesses at the church wedding.  This theory also involves the Stonemasons.<br /><br />Johnny Depp is the best actor in the film.  He plays the opium-addicted - but brilliant - Scotland Yard inspector Adeline.  His co-star Heather Graham falls flat as the whore-target ofthe Ripper.  For starters, her red hair looks so artificial and anachronistic.<br /><br />The filmography, sets, and music are chilling.  Jack the Ripper's carriage, with his goblin-fire green lantern and black horses looks like a coach from Hades.<br /><br />The ending, and the actual revelation of J.T.R. I found more funny than scary.  There were too many close-ups of his face.  He was more scary as a faceless figure in a top hat and cloak.<br /><br />I have heard some say the film is gory.  It is not at all.  I am squeamish, yet I hardly flinched.  C.S.I. episodes are ten times as gory.</p></br><a href="../users/A39NS429FYXAD1.html">A39NS429FYXAD1</a><br/><p>Fascinating take on the Ripper legend.  The real star is the breathtaking direction/cinematography.  My favorite actor, Johnny Depp, is often lost behind the characterization and heavy Eastend accent.  The usually appealing Heather Graham looks so unreal in her castoff &quot;Ariel&quot; red wig and spouting a Eliza Doolittle'isms that she can't be credible.  Supporting cast, however, is first rate and the tension never lets up.<p>The DVD special features, particularly the commentary track, are a disappointment and do nothing to enhance the &quot;From Hell&quot; experience.<p>Still, this is worth owning for Depp fans and crime buffs.</p></br><a href="../users/A11PTCZ2FM2547.html">A11PTCZ2FM2547</a><br/><p>After watching the first few minutes of this spellbinding film, I pushed away the meatlover's pizza.  Suddenly lost my appetite.  But that's quite all right:  FROM HELL's fascinating story--along with its mercurial cinematography--rapidly overwhelms and consumes all the muck and the gore of London's notorious Whitechapel district of the late 19th Century.<p>Yes, this is (yet) another film about Jack the Ripper, yet it presents the brutal murderer with a most bizarre twist, along with a plot suggesting a motive for the crimes as farfetched as an elephant swimming the Atlantic.  But the zany story works--a story about a small click of Whitechapel prostitutes harboring a secret and subsequently murdered, one by one--in part due to the ingenious visual devices employed by directors Allen and Albert Hughes, and in part due to the spine-tingling acting of Johnny Depp and Ian Holm.  Depp portrays Inspector Fred Abberline, a Scotland Yard detective who, aided by his dependency on opium, laudanum, and absinthe, has an uncanny ability to solve crimes.  Through his drug addiction, Abberline is &quot;chasing the dragon&quot;; when the fragile vulnerability of his character is exposed, the viewer learns the detective is chasing much, much more.<p>Holm plays Sir William Gull, an aging physician of Britain's royal family.  The good doctor is so calm, cold, reserved, detached, and calculating I'll wager he could freeze the mercury on a thermometer.  Holm and Depp easily carry this movie, augmented by haunting images of avarice, brutality, and a less than complimentary portrayal of the freemasons.  FROM HELL is a seat-squirming, stomach-twisting thriller.  And the film gave me an added bonus:  I now have plenty of cold pizza for breakfast.<br />--D. Mikels</p></br><a href="../users/A1YHKSTVSYEYTU.html">A1YHKSTVSYEYTU</a><br/><p>There have been so many books, movies and TV shows about Jack The Ripper that you might think that the story had been done to death and that nobody would be interested anymore. However, The Hughes brothers "From Hell" proves that there will always be a demand for a quality production of a very grizzly true horror story. <p>Way back in the 19th century (in the fall of 1888 to be precise) one of the worlds first recorded serial killers brutally murdered five prostitutes (yes, only 5) bringing terror to London's east end slums. And whilst in terms of numbers modern serial killers such as Jeffrey Dahmer have been much more prolific, it seems that it is still Jack The Ripper's crimes that continue to still fascinate many people. Is it because of the brutal yet clinical way that the murders were carried out? Or is it because the case remains unsolved? Probably both but as The Hughes brothers, previously best known for the likes of Menace II Society, have set out to prove, that although long dead there are still plenty of `worthy' suspects. <p>Based on the Alan Moore/Eddie Campbell cartoon strip and using the very beautiful city of Prague to expertly recreate Victorian London, The Hughes Brothers' latest movie pitches the clairvoyant, opium partaking, Inspector Fred Abberline (an impressive Johnny Depp), aided by his assistant Peter Godley (the always excellent Robbie Coltrane) racing against time in search of history's most notorious murderer, in this very watchable and very enjoyable yarn. Adapted by screenwriters Terry Hayes and Rafael Yglesias from the previously mentioned Moore/Campbell source material, From Hell manages to draw everybody from Queen Victoria to Oscar Wilde and the Elephant Man into the plot of this movie, which far from detracting from the true history of the attacks, actually adds a little more depth and a little more zest to this period thriller. To The Hughes brothers credit, this is not just another typical cheap and tasteless Hollywood slasher movie but instead it presents us with the full squalor, poverty and hardship that existed at that time, with the prostitutes presented as poor unfortunate human beings struggling against abject poverty to survive and finding consolation in alcohol. From Hell also boasts excellent performances of depth and subtlety not just from the likes of Depp (complete with a creditable cockney accent), Coltrane (Harry Potter) and renowned British stage actor Sir Ian Holm (Lord of the Rings) but also notably from the likes of (despite a slightly ropey accent) Heather Graham, Lesley Sharp, Annabelle Apsion and the late Katrin Cartlidge (No Man's Land) as the prostitutes earning their living in the squalor that was London's east end. <p>In summary, I thoroughly enjoyed From Hell and would recommend it to anyone looking for something a bit more intelligent, well written and well acted, as an alternative to the traditional horror teen flicks which seem to dominate our movie theatres. Four stars ****.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>The most important thing you need to know about "From Hell," is that the Hughes Brothers really let you off easy with this one.  When you go home after seeing this movie late at night and have trouble getting to sleep, just remember that they could have shown you a lot more, which means you might not have gotten to sleep for a week.  I have read Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell's graphic novel "From Hell," and have also spent some time researching the historical record regarding Jack the Ripper, which includes not only autopsy reports but also photographs of the victims.  Consequently, I was surprised that the film verion of "From Hell" actually backed off three times from completely grossing out the audience.<br /><br />First, when the Ripper killed Annie Chapman he draped some of her intestines over her shoulder.  The film does not even suggest this happened, beyond the idea that organs have been removed.  Second, the night the Ripper claimed two victims, most Ripperologists have surmised that because he was interrupted when he killed Liz Stride, he was really angry when he killed Catherine Eddowes, since he hacked away the bottom half of her face.  But when her face is revealed it is just the same as the other victims.  Finally, when the doctor begins to describe the final body--usual the very words of the actual report--he stops after having described the position of the corpse.  More to the point, he stops before describing what Jack did with her organs.  Believe me, you do not need to see this to freak out because just hearing about it would keep you awake all night.  Now, to be fair, the dialogue is the same as that scene in the graphic novel; but then Moore and Campbell had already devoted a entire volume to what Jack the Ripper did that night in graphic detail so it did not have to be articulated.  But I was all set to hear the one of the biggest audience moans in cinematic history and was somewhat disappointed the Hughes Brothers let everybody off the hook.<br /><br />Ironically, the Hughes Brothers could legitimately get away with showing us much more blood and guts.  After all, the autopsy reports tell us in excruciating detail what the Ripper did to each of his victims and they could simply claim historical accuracy.  But instead they pull up short, giving them even more latitude for getting away with what gore they do offer up.  However, during Abberline's vision of what will happen to Jack the Ripper's final victim, one of the images that flashes before our eyes is indeed a photograph taken by the police of the mutilated body of Mary Kelly.  This only goes to reinforce the great divide that exists between those who have studied the murders of Jack the Ripper and/or read "From Hell" and those who simply know Jack the Ripper killed a bunch of prostitutes in London in the late 19th century and was never caught.<br /><br />Certainly, the Hughes Brothers do play with us in this film.  If you can stomach seeing it a second time, or if you already know who "From Hell" contends is the Ripper, then they are several scenes were Abberline is tantalizingly close to the killer.  Of course, they are not alone in such regard; "The Bone Collector" was particularly audacious in offering us a first glimpse of the killer.  Moore and Campbell let us know the identity of Jack from before he ever starts his killing spree, but the movie version decides to keep it a mystery and apparently succeeds in surprising those who only know about "From Hell" from the trailer and television commercials.<br /><br />The Hughes Brothers have described "From Hell" as a "ghetto" film, and certainly the production design stands out in providing a fitting atmosphere for the tale.  The events we are watching are not taking place in the London we have come to know from countless Hammer horror films but in what we readily accept as the city's Whitechapel district in the fall of 1888 (with Prague doubling nicely).  This is as stylish a slasher flick as you will ever see, with the time-lapse sequence of the discovery of one of the bodies and the revelation of the Masonic meeting beneath the streets of London particularly memorable.  Even the lighting works towards the proper atmosphere for the story.<br /><br />Johnny Depp's performance as Inspector Abberline is nicely understated (the character's psychic visions come from a fake psychic who was in the graphic novel).  Unfortunately, Heather Graham is just too darn cute, sticking out from the rest of the totally believable group of prostitutes (Annabelle Apsion, Katrin Cartlidge, Susan Lynch and Lesley Sharp).  I had heard that the producers made actually made them shoot a "happy ending" to this film, but fortunately they had the wisdom not to use it.  Ripperologists knew going in that this was not going to be the "true" story about Jack, so that additional liberties such as all of the victims hanging out together all the time and the total absence of men in any of their lives, are easily forgivable.  What was always impressive about Moore's tale was how he managed to weave so many different elements together into a comprehensive tale, even if it is ultimately suspect.  But the film version strips the story down to its essentials and while it is certainly the best Jack the Ripper film made to date, I cannot shake my head and think how much better it could have been by letting the audience glimpse just a little bit more of the true story.<br /><br />But, oh, boys and girls, "From Hell" could have upset you a whole lot more than it did.  If only you can understand how close to the edge of the cliff you were on this one...</p></br><a href="../users/A1J2931UBBJPXM.html">A1J2931UBBJPXM</a><br/><p>The case of Jack the Ripper has long been, and continues to be, one of the great unsolved mysteries of all time, and as such has been the subject of numerous treatments in film.  Of them all, however, none has advanced a more logical or plausible theory in explanation of the who, whys and wherefores of the infamous serial killer than "From Hell," directed by Albert Hughes and Allen Hughes, which attempts to solve the mystery that has by consensus long been deemed "unsolvable."  But-- cinematically speaking, at any rate-- the Hughes Brothers make a decidedly solid case of it.<p>It's 1888, London; in the Whitechapel district prostitutes are being systematically slaughtered in a precise and grisly manner.  Scotland Yard is at a loss to solve or stop the murders, and Inspector Fred Abberline (Johnny Depp) is assigned to investigate.  Abberline is somewhat unique in his approach, as he is invested with certain prescient abilities, which he enhances through the use of opium, laudanum and absinthe; not the usual methods employed by the police, but it does effect the desired results.  <p>Abberline discovers a link between the victims, and along the way becomes involved with one of the "girls," Mary Kelly (Heather Graham), who may be in danger because of something she knows.  But as Abberline gets closer to a solution, he very well may be in danger also; he knows too much, and there is one, especially, who would find ease if he were to just disappear.  And by any means necessary.<p>The proper atmosphere is, of course, a requirement if one is to tell this story convincingly, and the Hughes Brothers succeed nicely in this regard.  But it would be hard to find a movie about the Ripper that did NOT achieve a proper mood; it's kind of a common link that ties all of the previous offerings together, up to and including this one.  This film differs from the rest in one important respect, however, and it's a big one-- that being the story itself.  Whereas the others are good at leading you down the path and taking you nowhere, the Hughes Brothers go out on a limb and actually deliver a satisfying ending, and moreover, one that solves the mystery.  It's all speculation, of course, but this film will leave you feeling closer to the truth than ever before.  It's well crafted and executed, and they manage to keep the air fairly heavy with menace and suspense, from the beginning right up to the very end, which ultimately defines it as something of a "fable-noir."<p>Johnny Depp gives a solid, convincing performance as Abberline, who is something of the antithesis of another of his creations, Constable Ichabod Crane, of Tim Burton's "Sleepy Hollow."  It's a challenge for an actor to take on two roles somewhat similar in nature to begin with, and successfully manage to make them quite the opposite of one another in the end, which is what Depp has done with these respective portrayals.  The events surrounding Crane may have been dark, but Ichabod was not; here, however, Deep finds a dark side of his character, Abberline, that is as enigmatic as the case with which he is dealing, and it is that to which Depp plays, approaching from the depths and looking up, rather than observing from a position of light, as he did in "Hollow."  And it demonstrates that Depp is endowed with that same kind of chameleon-like quality that serves such actors as De Niro and Billy Bob Thornton so well; it's a matter of being able to transform oneself from the inside out, which comparably few actors can do with any real success.<p>Heather Graham does a good job with her role of Mary; she's convincing for the most part, but there are moments when it's something of a challenge for the viewer to totally believe that she is a "lady of the night."  Her appearance seems almost a bit too polished, especially compared to the other girls.  It's a minor complaint, however, as overall, though her performance may not necessarily be one of the strengths of the film, it certainly does nothing to detract from the effectiveness of it.<p>The performance turned in by Ian Holm, on the other hand, is definitely one of the film's strengths.  As Sir William Gull, he is quite believable, with a probing portrayal that does much for the credibility of the story.  <p>Also helping things along substantially, are Robbie Coltrane (who has since become known, and will forever after be, "Harry Potter's" Hagrid), as Abberline's colleague, Peter Godley, and Susan Lynch (who previously gave such a remarkable performance as Nora Barnacle in "Nora," opposite Ewan McGregor), as Liz Stride.<p>The supporting cast includes Ian Richardson (Sir Charles Warren), Jason Flemyng (Netley), Katrin Cartlidge (Dark Annie), Terence Harvey (Ben Kidney), Paul Rhys (Dr. Ferral) and Lesley Sharp (Kate).  Arguably the best and, without question the most satisfying of all the "Ripper" movies, "From Hell" is a well made, graphic and thought provoking consideration of the Whitechapel killings, which for quite some time held all of London in the grip of fear and terror.  The conclusions offered here may just be as close to the truth as anyone will ever get; in the event that it is pure fiction, however,it is decidedly good fiction that makes for a couple of hours of riveting entertainment and speculation.  Be forewarned, this one is not going to be for everyone, as many of the mental, as well as visual images it presents are extremely disconcerting.  Definitely not for the squeamish, but for those who are so disposed, this one will prove to be quite an experience.  It's the magic of the movies.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PN7Z2VTHICL8.html">A2PN7Z2VTHICL8</a><br/><p>Aside from taking a fresh and unique approach to the old mysteries of Jack The Ripper, From Hell delivers a gracefully languid storyline peppered with brutal killings and interesting musings into an old fashioned culture.<br /><br />Inspector Fred Abberline (Johnny Depp) has a unique gift, a psychic ability to see murders in his opium dreams.  Because of this talent, he is assigned to the case of a brutally murdered prostitute along with his partner, Sergeant Peter Godley (Robbie Coltrane).  His suspicions turn away from the local gang of pimps and thugs, and towards a more educated and upper-class perpetrator as more and more girls are methodically butchered.<br /><br />Abberline wins the confidence of one of the slightly more refined prostitutes, Mary Kelly (Heather Graham), and uses her knowledge of the dead girls to uncover the unlikely murderer.<br /><br />From Hell definitely has its faults, a sometimes weak script and a far-fetched assumption of the identity and background of Jack The Ripper, but makes up for those faults with its stunning visuals and moody atmosphere.<br /><br />Using subtle photography rather than graphical violence in the murder scenes, it leaves a lingering taste in one's mouth that is nonetheless bloody and haunting.<br /><br />Depp plays Abberline with brilliant panache, a man who still cares but is void of the usual emotional swamps most humans swim in, evident in the scene where the coroner is retching but Abberline coldly and methodically examines the mutilated corpse.  I love cold characters.  Heather Graham is a beautiful woman, but not a very good actress.  However, her character of Mary Kelly is probably the best performance she had done, in spite of the weak accent attempted.<br /><br />There are also interesting notes to study while taking in the lush photography, the realism of the opium dens, the early lobotomies performed, a brief presentation of the Elephant Man, along with the cultural notions of the 1880's that well-bred and moneyed people simply could not be capable of such types of brutality.<br /><br />The time frame is well done and interesting in that it also exposes the religious persecution of certain sects, not to mention total disregard for the prostitutes and those poor souls considered to be beneath the genteel societies notice or care.  One's birth class stands out far above their deeds, and propriety rules the day.  And ruling the propriety are a secret sect of Freemasons, answerable only to themselves and powerful enough to stop Abberline's investigation.<br /><br />Perhaps because I am a very visual person I enjoyed the film more than many others did, but I encourage you to look beneath the slow, still waters of the movie's general flow, and pluck out the tasty treats in the form of interesting notes and speculations, and savor them for a bit.  It was really at that point that From Hell went from four to five stars for me.<br /><br />Languid, graceful, gory, suspenseful, atmospheric, and moody, don't miss out on this great sleeper film.  Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/ARA48345JZPZR.html">ARA48345JZPZR</a><br/><p>Okay if Jack the Ripper doesn't interest you, than skip the movie and ignore the 5 stars.  If you do find the tale of the never-caught, premier serial killer still fascinating then this is your flick.  The Hughes Brothers have dusted off the old boy's story and done him up a treat!<p>Quite crazily fanatical in their devotion to detail, the Hughes Brothers have confessed to an enduring obsession about Red Jack.  I, rather shamefacedly, must admit the same.  There is something about the fog-shrouded lanes of Whitechapel, prowled by the diabolical and demonic murderer, dressed to the nines in formal cape & top hat (we imagine) with black surgeon's bag hiding the long slim razor sharp scalpels with which he does his horrid work, that is so chilling and creepy.  And  that he does his villainy on poor, broken-down prostitutes with such a ferocity,  that deep & dark motives must be at play here.  It is the fuel for both nightmares & movies.<p>Others must share this fascination, for we have had him as a fixture in our imagination from The Lodger on to dozens of film and television treatments and riffs on the theme, i.e., encounters with Sherlock Holmes etc.<p>Well, the Hughes's have done a job here, in some instances with absolute brilliance.  This is a dark and moody meditation on the Ripper, as stylish and delirious as Johnny Depp's Inspector Aberline's fever-dream hallucinations.  Beautifully shot and composed with clever uses of the camera and an evocation of those foggy streets, filled with terror and panic.<p>Certainly not for everyone.  This is a superbly crafted film of  an admittedly peculiar interest. Jack the Ripper has provided a Hannibal Lecter-like fascination for audiences for 100 years now.  The granddaddy of them all, Red Jack was the real deal, and the true fascination is in his unrevealed identity which leaves him open to any interpretation imagination can take us.  He is the monster half-hidden in our nightmares.</p></br><a href="../users/A3N5XIM9R2OQH0.html">A3N5XIM9R2OQH0</a><br/><p>The Hughes brothers' From Hell is a movie about Jack The Ripper. And it isn't.  The movie's plot centers around the exploits and potential identity of Victorian England's mysterious knife-wielding prostitute killer, but its makers also try to shine a light on the darker aspects of that time and place, on the inevitable abuse of power, and on urban decay in general.  With a vicious murderer prowling the streets and leaving victims in pieces in his wake, there's a palpable sense of dread hanging over the proceedings, but even if Jack didn't make an appearance, there'd still be plenty to fear.  The 19th-century London of From Hell is a decidedly inhospitable place, racked by vice and crime, with plenty of unprincipled people willing to exploit the downtrodden for a buck (or, in this case, a pound).  In other words, it's sort of like any of dozens of urban ghettoes in 21-century America, except the appearances of those involved and the weapons of choice are different.<br /><br />I haven't read the Alan Moore graphic novel on which this movie was based, but the film version at least bears some pretty strong thematic parallels with Moore's V for Vendetta.  While that comic classic examined the dark underbelly of a fictional post-Cold War fascist England, From Hell attempts to strip away Victorian England's veneer of respectability to reveal a society awash in decadence, corruption, and prejudice, where power is lodged in decidedly undemocratic institutions and super-secret plots abound.  Some have written at some length about the movie's historical accuracy (or lack thereof), but it's really beside the point.  From Hell is, simply put, a movie, not a documentary, and it entertains more than well enough with what it has.  Plausibility issues aside, it looks great, with plenty of atmosphere and high style, some way cool visuals, truly painful death scenes, and liberal sprinklings of gore, which is just enough to get you to forgive the movie's haphazard pacing and occasional lapses into slasher-movie formula (even I could see some of the deaths coming a mile away).  It's also got Johhny Depp sporting a nifty British accent as Fred Abberline, the tortured detective trying to fight through the corridors of power to collar the slasher while he also fights his own addictions and the visions of death and mutilation that come to torment him in his sleep; and a bug-eyed Ian Holm hamming it up as a royal doctor with some murky motivations and an obvious God complex.<br /><br />So, in conclusion, you've got intrigue, nasty violence, some nice twists and turns in the plot as revelations start flying about halfway through, and another in a long line of excellent performances from Depp, not to mention a blindingly redheaded Heather Graham as perhaps the best-looking prostitute in all of London.  Sure, it's a bit shallow, and the plot doesn't always hum along as briskly as it should, but nothing's perfect, right?  Now to check out the book!</p></br><a href="../users/ASHT96DUVMF1S.html">ASHT96DUVMF1S</a><br/><p>At first seeing the previews for From Hell I thought of a great movie depiciting the murders of Jack the Ripper.  This movie falls short of anything to do with Jack the Ripper.  From Hell is about Depps drug addiction and his love for a hooker.  Both the Characters and the plot are thin as paper.  Small bits of info are given throughout the movie leading to nothing. I and my friends were completely bored.  Once people start getting up and begin talking you know a movie has fallen short of what it set out to accomplish. I keep looking at my watch just waiting for it to end.  Rent but only in need of a movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KD8NJPZ01R37.html">A1KD8NJPZ01R37</a><br/><p>The whole air of the film is dark and moody, intelligent and just totally awesome. I've heard others say it was too slow and not gory enough, but I thought it was just right. I loved all the old English language and bad weather. The backdrops and shots of old London from the sky are gorgeous. The story is unbelievably awesome. The Ripper was most likely a Nobleman and this flick tells the tale well. And with style. Bravo Hughes Brothers!<br />A common factor I did notice with people who said they didn't like it, is that they all probably watched it on 27" TV's. I think it was watchable in widescreen only, which, on a 27", turns into a 6-inch thick, 2-foot wide movie bar.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NLH4A3XP4WA5.html">A3NLH4A3XP4WA5</a><br/><p>Johnny Depp and Heather Graham star in this classic tale of Jack the Ripper in 19th century London. Inspector Abeline (Depp) of the London police has stumbled onto a killer like no other he has ever encountered. A man that ritualistically and methodically hunts his victims and mutilates them in the most vicious manner. While most of London is shcoked by the killings, Abeline pursues him not only through the foggy streets of the city, but also through the intense bureaucracy of the London police force. While the plot is rather light the imagery is simply stunning. Intense (And gory) scenes of murder and Abeline's opium hallucinations shock the screen in a hazy red/green wash. While not altogether thrilling, it does offer a good sense of cinematographic inginuity.</p></br><a href="../users/A2198FZZMTJ38H.html">A2198FZZMTJ38H</a><br/><p>Those expecting a good scare in the vein of Wes Craven will be sorely disappointed in &quot;From Hell,&quot; the latest take on the infamous Jack the Ripper, done in a style of elegant and yet so perverse that one cannot help but become wrapped up in this dark yet absorbing tale. The latest film from the Hughes Brothers is a gossamer blanket of elegant settings crossed with the depraved regions of the darkest of human thoughts, with inklings of the psychological and conspiracy. <p>The story seems to be aimed more at those who know little about the history of Jack the Ripper, putting a fictional spin on the events leading up to the still-unsolved case involving a series of notorious murders in London's Whitecastle district. In this degraded section of the capital, prostitutes fill the streets, five of which form a tightly knit group of friends. At the center of these women is Mary Kelly (Heather Graham), who will become the love interest to Inspector Abberline (Johnny Depp), who is assigned to the cases of the murders. <p>Of course, Abberline has more connection to the gruesome events than he wishes. His dreams allow him to foresee the crimes before they happen, a plot point that doesn't quite reach fruition by film's end. His psychological connection to the events is never really capitalized on, and since there is really no need for it, what there is in the film seems out of place. <p>The movie also takes its time to generate some momentum, and some will find the sequence of events boring rather than interesting. This is no a whodunit in the traditional sense: the clues in the beginning are less intriguing than those towards the end, and the action is almost null. I consider this to be one of the film's attributes, taking its time in delivering small clues that will lead to larger ones, while keeping the cheap thrills at a minimum. <p>As the plot progresses, it begins to generate some genuine suspense. From the murder scenes, Abberline begins gathering his physical evidence, from things such as grape branches to the smell of expensive alcohol on the victims' lips. He discovers that the women killed by the Ripper compose the circle of friends to which Mary belongs, making it more of a personal vendetta, a particularly effective angle once the final act begins. <p>This new working of the legendary serial killer is quite a stylish trip, I must say, boasting some of the most impressive visual scenes of this year. Scenes that reveal the glory of London soon transform into the degradation and run-down conditions of the poor sectors, while the murder scenes have the good taste to keep most of the gruesome, gory detail hidden from view. The recreation of London in the 19th century is meticulous and bursting with authenticity, a lavish set and costume design achievement. <p>The underlying mystery also keeps things moving at a reasonable pace, and those who enjoy exposition over thrills will find it rather interesting. It sparks a new twist that involves many of London's highly regarded officials, even a figure of royalty. As the beginning begins to unfold, nothing seems to fit together, but as the story progresses, the pieces become clearer. Most importantly, it keeps its surprises well hidden, making them that much more effective once they are revealed. <p>Johnny Depp is back in fine form, and his performance here is sure to remind audiences of his spectacular acting in Tim Burton's &quot;Sleepy Hollow.&quot; In Abberline, he plays the same kind of character, but with an edgier lifestyle, and a more straightforward attitude. It's good to see Heather Graham in a genre that befits her talent; comedy doesn't seem to be her strong suit, but her role as Mary in this film allows her to give us a wonderful performance. She and Depp share a terrific offbeat chemistry, one that makes the movie's bittersweet resolution for the two deeply affecting. <p>I've never really known much about the legend of Jack the Ripper short of seeing &quot;From Hell,&quot; and even I have my doubts about its historical accuracy in regards to the sequence of events leading to the fictional twist in the end. Even still, the film is bursting with elements of the macabre and the gothic, and carries a well-suited cast to pull off a nicely paced plot; this is a pretty impressive production.</p></br><a href="../users/AIMR915K4YCN.html">AIMR915K4YCN</a><br/><p>Jack The Ripper has fascinated generations of would-be detectives (including myself). The fact that this legendary serial-murderer was never caught has always brought chills. FROM HELL takes some theories about the case, mixes them w/ facts, and adds a bleak air of dread and doom. Johnny Depp (Sleepy Hollow, Ed Wood, The Ninth Gate, Sweeny Todd) plays an opium-addicted police inspector, drawn into the action due to his ability to "see" certain future events in his dreams. Heather Graham is the sweet yet tough prostitute, Mary Kelly, who assists in the investigation. Ian Holm (Alien, Brazil, The Fifth Element, Lord Of The Rings) plays a kindly old doctor w/ extremely valuable information. Thick w/ symbology, conspiracy, and mystery, FROM HELL plays (somewhat) like a  Sherlock Holmes story, w/ elements of horror sewn in. This is a great movie for Depp fanatics, as he comes through once again. Robbie Coltrane (Harry Potter And The...) is wonderfully low-key in his Watson-esque role as Depp's assistant. Highly recommended...</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>Jack the Ripper has always been a great mystery. No one will ever know who he was and what his motivations were, except if one day we come across new documents. This film is adapted from a comic strip and the theory is original, even if it is not in any way more objective than any other. The idea is that it is a freemason cleaning mission to protect the Prince of Wales who is syphilitic but has married a young prostitute and has had a child from her. The scandal has to be erased and the unacceptable heiress to the throne has to be pushed aside, destroyed, along with all the witnesses of the illegitimate marriage, what's more in a catholic church. The freemasons are moved into this extreme action by several reasons. First to avenge the crime from the catholic church, hence to clean up the plate of dirty linen they have had with the catholic church for centuries. Second, to clean up the social plate this time and get rid of prostitutes, at least some of them, and maybe frighten prospective customers. Prostitutes are seen as propagating diseases and social decay. Third, to strengthen the Crown of England, the Empire, because they have won a very important position in this political institution that more than tolerates them. They also agree with the vast program of this Empire : to civilize the world. Fourth, and this motivation is very obscure, they go back to old traditions and rituals that are supposed to symbolically save the world because they are inspired by God himself, thus projecting the free masons into a cosmological and religious mission : to be the new Abraham, the new Moses, the new messengers of God on earth to propagate his will and ethics. The inspector that tries to find out the truth is a mixture of many characters, particularly Sherlock Holmes, including the use of opium (though Holmes used cocaine), to have visions of the crimes and the criminal. This gives an esoteric dimension to the story. Of course this does not stop the criminal, though the film does pretend the criminal is punished after fulfilling his mission because he over-interpreted the objective of it. The film is well built, entertaining and even thrilling. And I particularly like the use of grapes in this plot. It reveals the deep poverty of many, the condescending pity and rejection of these dregs of society that prostitutes are, the aristocratic belief that these women can be lured by some valueless vain merchandise, etc. The free masons are shown as being a sect, nothing but a sect that tries to manipulate society through their penetrating into the inner circles of the governing body of it. Power is their main objective and they are ready to do anything to protect this power, their power or the power that tolerates them. They are in other words extremely dangerous. This is the modern dimension of this film and it is a disquieting one, because free masons still exist.<p>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU</p></br><a href="../users/A3H9JSM1SUTE4O.html">A3H9JSM1SUTE4O</a><br/><p>The bloody terror of Jack the Ripper soaks almost every frame of "FROM HELL." Although twin directors Allen and Albert Hughes deliver a detailed and atmospheric recreation of London's East End Whitechapel district circa 1888, they do not quite capture the full impact of the massive graphic novel by Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell on which the film is based.  Johnny Depp is a Scotland Yard detective who uses all manner of drugs to enhance his intuitive "visions" as he investigates the surgical-like slayings of five prostitutes.  Robbie Coltrane is his assistant. Heather Graham's a Cockney whore who may become a victim of the Riper and Ian Holm is a still proud, but washed-up surgeon.  The real star of this grimly gripping saga is the recreation of London's Ripper haunts in Prague.  The two disc set is heavy with extras and bonus material including commentary by directors, writer, cinematographer, many deleted scenes, an alternate ending, multiple featurettes include making-of, behind the scenes, and a tour of the actual Ripper murder sites with the Hughes brothers. "From Hell" makes a strong case for the identity of the Ripper as an heir to the British throne but it is at odds with the recent and equally compelling conclusions by crimewriter Patricia Cornwell.  Whoever the Ripper was, he was never brought to justice while he was alive.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MNMZMM6BGLTA.html">A2MNMZMM6BGLTA</a><br/><p>I thought From Hell was very good.

Great story and directing and kudos to Heather Grahams beauty.</p></br><a href="../users/A2YAABMT80RLYA.html">A2YAABMT80RLYA</a><br/><p>Having been fascinated by the Jack the Ripper case for many years now, it is refreshing to see a new movie offering a new twist on the legend. The Hughes Brothers make an interesting change of venue  (considering their first two movies &quot;Menace II Society&quot; and &quot;Dead Presidents&quot;) and pull off a scary and stylish adaption to a brilliant graphic novel.<p>Johnny Depp plays a clairvoyant detective who's powers of seeing into the near future help track the ripper in the slums of Whitechapel, a district of London where the ripper killed at least 5 women in 1888. Along the way, he meets Mary Kelly (Heather Graham), a prostitute with a good mind, and they develop a romance of sorts. Anyone who has read about Jack The Ripper will know what fate has in store for Mary. A romance between a detective and a prostitute is a strange entity, but stranger things areto come in this movie. Also adding their talent are Robbie Coltrane and Ian Holm, to name a few. The acting is superb, and the Hughes Brothers showcase themselves as great directors. <p>The novel &quot;From Hell&quot;, and this movie, attempt to use logic to show us who the ripper really was. It shows the ripper as an educated man, a man with intellegence and knowledge of science and anatomy. History often painted Jack The Ripper as a lunatic who simply killed prostitutes to satisfy his desire for blood.<br />You can't really argue accuracy, because all you can offer today is theory. &quot;From Hell&quot; attempts to draw it's own conclusions, and  without spoiling the movie, it have some great twists. <p>This DVD features 23 deleted scenes with an optional different ending. It also contains a documentary on Jack The Ripper, his case, and the posible suspects. All of this is fascinating stuff, and add to the value of this DVD collection. The film is a bit bloody at times, which is hardly suprising considering the story. But if you haven't see &quot;From Hell&quot; yet, you are missing out on a great film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3081Z4P774YR4.html">A3081Z4P774YR4</a><br/><p>This new telling of the gruesome Jack the Ripper murders that struck London in 1888 may not be the most historically accurate telling of the story, but it is the most surreal and creepy telling of it in modern cinema history.  A lot of that goes to the talented group behind this film.  Johnny Depp stars as Inspector Abberline, a London detective whose Opium and Absinthe fueled dreams give him clues to the identity of the brutal killer of prostitutes in the slums of Whitechapel.  But as starts to discover, there are secrets that link these murders together and a conspiracy that goes to the highest levels of power in England.  The performances are solid, including Ian Holm as the Queen's chief surgeon (who has a few secrets of his own), Robbie Coltrane as the Inspector's reluctant partner, and Heather Graham as a prostitute who starts a dangerous relationship with Abberline.  The film was directed by the Hughes Brothers, Albert and Allen (who directed more 20th century oriented fare such as "Menace II Society" and "Dead Presidents") and based upon the complex and grpahic comic book by Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell.  Thanks to cinematographer Peter Deming (Mulholland Drive, Lost Highway) and the stunning production design, this movie makes 19th century London seem as dark and as creepy as the comic does.  While the film doesn't adhear too closely to the book, the graphic detail of the murders and the rather unusual conspiracy angle make this movie a must-see for horror buffs.  The DVD (a two-disc set to be replaced by a single disc by the end of the year) is definitely a must-own for fans of the film.  The lively commentary track feature the Hughes Brothers, Deming, Coltrane, and screenwriter Rafael Yglesias explaining not only the details of the film, but of the actual murders, theories, and some complaints about the studio system that make this an interesting listen.  One the first disc are nearly 20 deleted scenes and an alternate ending that is worth seeing with the optional commentary, if only to hear about an unusual extended shot that is worth questioning.  On disc two are some intersting documentaries on the production design, a humorous trip through the set with the Hughes Brothers, a look at the history of Absinthe, a look into the theories of Jack the Ripper's identity (everyone from the Queen's doctor to Lewis Carroll, writer of "Alice in Wonderland" are perceived to be suspects), and a look at the book as opposed to the film.  Rounding it off is the very short "making of" special aired on HBO, trailers, and look for a very special Easter Egg in the main menu.  All in all, this is definitely a most sinful treat and for those of you "From Hell" fans, this two-disc set is definitely worth the extra buck.</p></br><a href="../users/A1E11HKN4IRY09.html">A1E11HKN4IRY09</a><br/><p>This movie was very dissapointing.  The coolest thing about the Jack the Ripper legend is that no one ever truly knew his identity.  The movie itself was very well directed and production design superb, but the plot declaring that the ripper was basically a government hitman and his murders just conspiracy cover-up took the creepiness out of the story itself.  Are Free-Masons really that wacked?  Don't know, don't care.

While it is based on the Whitechapel murders and does an adequate job presenting some factual information (such as the locations and conditions of the bodies), the premise is based on a thoroughly discredited and rather laughable theory; there is also much fiction in the relationships of the murder victims, and many important events and individuals are ignored altogether.  The film does a decent job of depicting Whitechapel, but it never really comes close to portraying the true filth and miserable conditions of the real Whitechapel, nor does it succeed in revealing the humanity of the unfortunate victims.  Certainly one pities the poor women who must engage in prostitution merely to survive, but the utter hopelessness and darkness of their world does not really manifest itself in the movie.  The portrayals of the murders themselves are quite good and were clearly done with an eye toward accuracy.  I was glad to see that no real attempt was made to show the true state of the final victim's body because nothing can possibly convey the utter horror of that scene.  Johnny Depp is marvelous as Inspector Abberline; Heather Graham is a wonderful Mary Kelly, but her character never really came across as a down and out prostitute.  The characters involved in the murders and conspiracy, whom I will not name for fear of giving something away, are also quite good.  I can accept and even applaud the "solution" this movie portrays, as there are a couple of really ingenious aspects of the whole conspiracy, and I felt the ending was quite proper and touchingly subtle.  Needless to say, this is a rather depressing story all the way around.  There is not an overabundance of horror, as the real dirty work of the Ripper is never shown to the audience, so the squeamish can probably make it through until the end with a minimum of head turns.  <p>As an armchair Ripperologist, I am compelled to state that the identify of the Ripper and the complex story surrounding the "solution" here are not at all historical.  The movie makers took as their premise a thoroughly discredited story, and on top of this they added several completely original ideas.  For example, Inspector Abberline is here portrayed as an opium addict who has visions of the Ripper murders.  The victims supposedly know each other and are marked out for death for a quite specific reason.  All of the juiciest Ripper gossip and wildest speculations are injected into this movie.  For those with little knowledge of the Whitechapel murders, please understand that the murderer, whoever he was, was certainly not the culprit named in this movie.  If you want to learn the history of these crimes, forget almost everything you see here.  This movie is to be enjoyed as a dark, Gothic motion picture because that is all it is.  <p>I must say I was disappointed by the bonus material on the accompanying disc.  The documentary about Jack the Ripper is the worst such documentary I have ever seen.  On the one hand, you have someone pointing an amateur camera over Donald Rumbelow's shoulder--often losing the focus as the camera zooms in and out--as he flips through pages of a book of Ripper-related drawings--the most exciting part of this segment is the moment when Rumbelow announces he has to cough and then does so.  On the other hand, you have a fairly old interview of less than stellar quality with a man who asserts that the true facts are those that we see presented in the movie, which is simply untrue and has no evidence upon which to stand.  I was most disappointed by the tour of the murder sites.  Some of the actual murder locations still exist today, and there is in fact a tour offered of the murder sites in modern Whitechapel, but the "tour" on the DVD turns out to be a tour of the movie set; the tour guides are the two directors, who make a big joke out of the whole tour and murders.  The deleted scenes are interesting, especially the alternate ending, but I rejoice that such scenes were all deleted because they would have potentially ruined the movie, in my opinion.  Finally, there is an inane 9-minute documentary about absinthe--while Depp's Abberline consumed this dangerous drink as an aid for his visionary powers, absinthe has less than nothing to do with Jack the Ripper.  I'm still giving this DVD four stars because I enjoyed the highly fictionalized movie, but the accompanying DVD really detracts from the overall package.</p></br><a href="../users/AMKZHBOK7VMQR.html">AMKZHBOK7VMQR</a><br/><p>The Hughes Brothers created a nightmarish vision of Victorian London only matched by some of Dickens novels. Johnny Depp and Heather Graham are fabulous as the police inspector investigating the case and a prostitute who is a friend to the victims.<br /><br />The film is beautifully shot and the atmosphere of the grimy southside of London is captured incredibly well. The murder scenes are very graphic and this is definitely not for the squeemish or the very young. Depp plays a role similar to the one he played in Sleepy Hollow but this is a much more serious movie aimed at a different audience. My kids loved Sleepy Hollow but I wouldn't let them watch this. It would give them nightmares for a week.<br /><br />The plot is interesting and while fictional it has enough plausibilty to engage the viewer for it's entire length.<br /><br />Johnny Depp is an incredible talent. After seeing him in this,Pirates, Slepy Hollow and Edward Scissorhands I have to conclude that this guy is the best actor of his generation. He is always interesting to watch.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ.html">A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ</a><br/><p>I was very interested in seeing this movie. I love this kind of history and it just looked very intriguing. Of course, you can't really watch this film as a complete history lesson. I'll explain later. The movie tells the story about Jack The Ripper, a name given to a serial killer who brutally slaughtered five prostitutes(could be more)nearly 114 years ago in London. Nobody knew who this man was. They still don't. In comes Johnny Depp, who plays a Scotland Yard inspector named Abberline. This is a man with his own problems. He is addicted to opium, and this addiction seems to help him solve murders by having visions of the crimes. He befriends prostitute Mary Kelly(who, in real life, was a victim)played by Heather Graham, who is part of the circle of prostitutes being killed. Isn't it funny how all of her fellow prostitutes are on the unattractive side but she is pretty?. Robbie Coltrane("Harry Potter", "Nuns On The Run")is on hand as Depp's sgt. The cast also includes Ian Holm, who you may remember from such films as "Alien" and "The Fifth Element". He plays a doctor who no longer practices because of an ailment. The Hughes Brothers(Allen and Albert), direct this film with a sure hand. It is exquisitley shot and looks great. There are a number of scenes that are filled with haunting visuals. The town and costumes are great. Beautiful. The acting is pretty solid. Heather Graham is a decent actress, but she hasn't been given any good stuff since "Boogie Nights". She is passable here, but there isn't a whole lot to her. Ian Holm steals the show with his ill doctor character. Robbie Coltrane is always watchable. Johnny Depp is pretty good. There is no doubt that he is one of the best actors of his generation, but his performance here is kinda routine. Not that it's bad. Some people say he's just like Ichabod Crane in "Sleepy Hollow" again. No way. These two movies and characters are as different as night and day. His accent is pretty good too. The ending of this film tells you who the ripper is. But don't think that you were actually given a positive answer to this mystery. You aren't. The fact is that nobody really knows who Jack The Ripper was. This crime has gone unsolved for over a 100 years. There have been theories and thoughts since then, but no real proof. He could've been caught, but he could also of gotten away. No one knows who he really was or what happened to him and probably never will. The filmmakers here pretty much took one theory and used it. But there can be no satisfactory ending here. I suggest you read some books on this subject or check out some web sites on who some of the alleged suspects were. It is a fascinating mystery made into a decent, but still somewhat unsatisfying, film. It is very violent and may not be of your liking. I enjoyed it well enough. It could of been better.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GHUN5HXMHZ89.html">A1GHUN5HXMHZ89</a><br/><p>Johnny Depp comes through again as a detective for the London police. His character is multi-faceted and fascinating. The investigations into the murders of Jack the Ripper, lead us to believe we know the actual murderer for a change. That isn't to say it is clear cut at first, no pun intended, but his following the case gives us an in depth look at police work for the times and conditions in hospitals are very graphic. This is not for young children. This is an adult movie in the respect of the horrible way women are murdered. Although I enjoyed this movie immensely, I personally would not buy it because of the dark and graphic nature of it. It shows us what truly must be Hell. Excellent quality DVD with fair replayability. If you enjoyed this, catch "Sleepy Hollow" and "Time After Time". - C. Luster</p></br><a href="../users/AGKPTMTR3UX1R.html">AGKPTMTR3UX1R</a><br/><p>The diversely talented Johnny Depp stars in this Hughes Brothers fictionalization of the story of Jack the Ripper, the prostitute-killing serial murderer of Victorian England. Depp plays Inspector Frederick Abberline, who in real life, was an experienced, thoughtful bulldog of a cop who remained haunted by his inability to solve the Ripper case for the rest of his life.<br /><br />Depp's Abberline is a laudanum-dosing, absinthe-drinking, opium-smoking psychic detective who uses his drug-enhanced visions to solve crimes. He is brought onto the case after the Ripper brutally murders one of the "circle of friends," a group of prostitutes plying their trade in London's Whitechapel area in 1888.<br /><br />The circle of friends, led by Mary Kelly (the irresistible Heather Graham) are privy to a major State secret and are being victimized one after another. Depp tries valiantly to protect Mary Kelly and her friends, though the lures of their lifestyle eventually draw them out back onto the streets to be slaughtered. The real-life Mary Kelly (whom Graham somewhat resembles) was the youngest, prettiest and most vivacious of the Ripper's victims. She was also the worst mutilated, and hence the most kindly treated in the contemporary press.<br /><br />The Hugheses use a variant of the Royal Conspiracy theory to build their story, though historically it is probably untrue that any member of the British Royal House was involved in the Ripper killings, just as the Ripper's victims were most likely not known to each other.<br /><br />FROM HELL (the address line in one of the Ripper's letters) is intensely atmospheric. The sets and cinematography are outstanding. FROM HELL has a powerfully engaging storyline. FROM HELL does as well as any color film could do in setting the mood and tone of Victorian London. Where the story has not been changed for the sake of the plot, FROM HELL is accurate. It is instructive that THE ELEPHANT MAN, which takes place in the same setting in the same year was filmed in black and white. (As a matter of fact, the Elephant Man, John Merrick, makes an appearance in FROM HELL, though no kindly Dr. Treves is in evidence.)<br /><br />Jack the Ripper is identified, a fictionalization which does dilute the story. By identifying the Ripper, the Hughes brothers give some measure of rationality and motive to a person who so clearly had none.<br /><br />The DVD's Special Features are very thin, and consist mostly of incredibly boring deleted scenes along with some very dull commentary by the Hughes Brothers.<br /><br />While the Hugheses generally downplay the sordid aspects of the lives of the Whitechapel prostitutes, and leave much of the gore of the Ripper killings to symbol-laden flashbacks and imagination, they communicate these elements well, nonetheless. However, a colorized version of the actual death scene photograph of the real Mary Kelly is used in a momentary flashback, and it is one of the most hideous images ever to make it into any film. That one human being could butcher another in such a way---so personally---is paralyzing to consider. Jack the Ripper deserves his reputation.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ICHEO78NFE4Y.html">A3ICHEO78NFE4Y</a><br/><p>This film had alot going for it when it started but fell apart terribly at the end.

The stylized sets, the excellent lighting, and the attention to detail are great.  The DVD version offers over 20 deleted scenes with the parts leading to them and came after that were included in the film being in black & white, with the deleted scenes in color.  This was a nice touch.  I enjoyed the delted scene with the detectives running about with flashlights.  My wife said, "Did they have flashlights back then?"  I said, "That's probably why they deleted it!"  <p>The acting in the film was very good.  Depp turns in his usual magical performance, always letting us sense a depth to the surface action.  Robbie Coltrane as the sidekick cop Peter Godley was appropriately loyal.  One of the deleted scenes in the library showed a great personal devotion which was a nice touch.  Heather Graham as Mary Kelly didn't look like life had been hard on her, other than having to wear a slightly soiled costume, but was a great love interest.  My favorite was Susan Lynch who bowled me over as Mrs. James Joyce in "Nora."  Here she plays the lesbian hooker Liz Stride with appropriate pluck.  Ian Holm as Sir William Gull did surprise me with his change at the end.  All in all, the sets are stunning, the story good, acting superb.  Not one to watch with your kids around, however...  I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.</p></br><a href="../users/A34KBK8ORA5GRV.html">A34KBK8ORA5GRV</a><br/><p>BLU-RAY VERSION IS WORTH BUYING. I DON'T NEED TO TELL YOU ABOUT THE MOVIE, OTHERS ALREADY HAVE. BUT, NOT TOO MANY PEOPLE TELL YOU IF IT IS WORTH UPGRADING FROM YOUR REGULAR DVD TO BLU-RAY. THIS ONE IS WORTH IT. COLORS ARE STUNNING AND SOUNDS GREAT.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EZMV5DSWU8TU.html">A1EZMV5DSWU8TU</a><br/><p>This movie takes the view of there have been two killers in the infamous Jack The Ripper slaying at White Chapel. One being the henchman of a respected doctor who is also a part of the ruling Masonic Lodge of the day who recognizes that there are certain forces inherant in certain symbols, such as The Pentagram {a victims with which he configured in its symmetry, positioning several relics and remnants of the victim therein.}<p>It is eventually divulged that all of the slayings were committed for purposes according to his particular and peculiar purposes. He believed himself to be the incarnation of iconoclastic forces that would bring the 20th century into fruition; but even his Masonic brothers viewed his views as too extreme and ended up condemning him to a lobotomy - the preferred method of treating the perceived mentally-ill. <p>We are introduced to several prostitutes of the day; filthy, dirty, crass, diseased, and minimalistic in hygiene practices as well as teeth. However, it was a bit sad and disheartening to witness how these women of pulchritude were treated, considering they do provide a popular service to the citizens of London. Yet these are the types of blindlight-rooted cultures which produce the most mindlessly habitually hate-filled hypocrites in such societies.<p>Grapes play a role in the slayings, as each sacrifice was given a single vine of exquisite grapes to consume, along with a vial of some liquor, both of which each woman consumed in tandem with ravenous delight. And that was their final indulgence. They were forthwith dispatched and their disemboweled innards left artfully positioned around the corpses, which would subsequently manifest a theory in which the killer may have been an artist. But this film focuses on the surgeon analogy, with the chief investigator {played by Johnny Depp} ironically quite schooled in the forensic arts, who himself demonstrates his peculiarities such as indulging in the Green Demoness Absinthe, which he meticulously mixes with an amount of six drops of laudanum, a well-known poison, to form an amazing intoxicant alight with the blue flame to fully integrate the ingredients to this forbidden elixir, concocted like an expert Alchemist. He dwells in blissful rapport there in his tub, luxuriously partaking in this "Alchemist's Delight". <p>The Phantom of White Chapel strikes again and again, the gleam of his cold blade shimmering in the moonlight, tainted red by crimson life. The figure in black with his top hat and silver-tipped cane disappears into the fog, and the mystery continues.<p>The film derives its nomenclature from a brief letter mailed to the Police station accompanied by a sliver of the woman's kidney, the other half which he happily consumed, and mentioned that it was "very nice." Signed, "From Hell". <p>Understandable, considering it had been filled with a choice blend of the liquor and grapes, stewed in its own juices. So it was revealed that the killer was also a cannibal. Strains of Hannibal Lechter as well as The Zodiac Killer are influenced here.<p>Another interesting occurrence transpired when someone had left a now infamous message on the wall at one of the bloody scenes:<p>"The jewes {sic} are not the ones that will be blamed for nothing."<p>So it was both divulged that the perpetrator was a somewhat literate man, and not some savage or Gypsy as was alleged thus far. But this incident also may lead the viewer to consider that message may have been an attempt to redirect attention away from the correct path of inquiry, as well as establish a good bit of aggravation towards the many-times convenient scapegoats that have been Jews. This introduced a religious as well as an aesthetic connotation to divert attention away from the Masons, who were the underground ruling class portrayed by the film; the social elite whose cult was alleged to run England at the time, with its esteemed members merely going through the motions with The Church of England; the politics of enacting mass behavior on the surface in order to maintain positions of leadership while preserving true to one's roots in private.<br />By and by, the clues manifest themselves until eventually, the investigator is face to face with an esteemed doctor he admires, whose delusions of grandeur drove him into the halls of infamy.<p>Overall, a dark production arranged in a cinematic style reminiscent of Coppola, yet not as perfectly hewn. "From Hell" is yet another subnote in the legendary of a socio-psychopathic "madman" whom some would hail as a genius.</p></br><a href="../users/A27NTH2Y9DAR31.html">A27NTH2Y9DAR31</a><br/><p>The first time I learned of the "true" identity of Jack the Ripper was from a book by Steven Knight, who I feel is the closest and most viable resource for this elusive killer's identity and facts surrounding the case. The movie adheres to much of Knight's solution and tells the tale in a dark, appropriately frightening fashion. Depp is, as usual, up to the task of portraying Frederick Abberline, lead detective on the case, and one of the few voices of reason (albeit through a haze of either drink or drugs) throughout this melange of criminals, both low and high estate, all the way to Buckingham Palace, who orchestrated this serial killing to maintain the Monarchy and keep it intact for the sake of England, ostensibly. I was not surprised to see that, at the end of the movie, Victoria feels gratitude that "we" have been saved, and not to make any further references to this episode..."we" are most grateful for your discretion in this matter. The implication of the Duke of Clarence, and what happened to his poor wife and child, is well-documented here, and when taken in context of the story and research that went into this production, one feels convinced that indeed, this is what happened and why. Ian Holm is wonderful in his role of Sir Wm. Gull, physician to the Queen, and the architect of the plan which she was entirely aware of from the ineception of same, and bore out my own feelings with respect to how much she played a part in these killings. Great atmosphere and really presents a window into Vicotrian London and the plight of the East End, and the tragic lives these women led, all very well-represented here. "We" were eminently entertained and thought the movie was well-directed and very well acted.

(In the<br />interim, they filmed and released independently a<br />feature-length documentary called American Pimp,<br />recently reviewed here.) Based on Alan (Watchmen)<br />Moore's graphic novel, the tale focuses on Fred<br />Abberline (Johnny Depp), a Scotland Yard inspector<br />who, unfortunately for him, lands the case of Jack the<p>Ripper. (Note: the main IMDB page for the movie<br />contains a MAJOR spoiler, so avoid it if you're<br />planning on seenig the movie.) Abberline is a<br />precognitive, and aids his visions with liberal use of<br />opium and its derivative laudanum, often landing in<br />subterranean opium dens, usually to be hauled out by<br />staunch sidekick Peter Godley (Robbie Coltrane of<br />_Cracker_ fame). As they delve deeper into the<br />investigation, they find that maybe bureaucracy isn't<br />all that's holding them up; Abberline finds himself<br />watched by Scotland Yard's Special Branch, headed by<br />the sinister Ben Kidney (veteran character actor<br />Terence Harvey).<p><p>The movie is put together beautifully; not a scene is<br />ill-shot or out of place, and the violence inherent in<br />a retelling of the Ripper story is kept to an<br />as-tasteful-as-possible minimum. The sweeping<br />cinematography is on a par with Alex Proyas' similarly<br />claustrophobic Dark City (1998), and the film's<br />atmosphere is quite successful at drawing the veiwer<br />in.<p><p>Where From Hell fails its two Hughes-helmed<br />predecessors is in the characterization. No character<br />here gets the same pervasive treatment as did O-Dogg<br />in _Menace II Society_, for example; many minor<br />characters seem cardboard cutouts, and even Abberline<br />and obligatory love interest (and historical Ripper<br />victim) Mary Kelly (Heather Graham, finally coming up<br />with a role with as much potential as the one she had<br />in _Drugstore Cowboy_) don't really get the depth of<p>character they deserve. The characters are all too<br />readily predictable, and the snarkier part of my mind<br />wants to lay that fault at the doorstep of Alan Moore;<br />after all, the Hughes Brothers have a long-established<br />track record of bringing characters to life.<p><p>Which brings us to the other predictable element of<br />the move: the plot. Even those unfamiliar with various<br />Ripper hypotheses should be able to figure out who the<br />Ripper is by halfway through the film, and the twist<br />ending should be obvious even before the scene starts;<br />despite this, Albert and Allen do have one last twist<br />of the knife left for the penultimate scene. While the<br />film doesn't resolve as satisfactorily as did Menace<br />or Dead Presidents, Hollywood hasn't completely taken<br />over the wunderkinder yet.<p><p>It's certainly not the tour de force Menace II Society<br />was, but From Hell is a surprisingly literate thriller<br />in a year that's given us the usual Hollywood helping<br />of mindless dreck; another pearl in the string that<br />already holds Memento and The Others.

If you don't know anything about Jack the Ripper, you might be puzzled before the Masonic conspiracy, a kidney sent to the police, a message on the wall, and alleged involvement of the royal family.  All these factors are certainly based on truth, as 'Ripperians' or people who study this serial murder case (including Allan Moore, who wrote the original graphic novel) know, but they are all crammed into such a disjointed way that during the two hour of the film's running time, we start to lose interests.  To make matters worse, the filmmakers tries to send a social comment about the cold-hearted nature of upper-class society of Victorians through the characters of Ian Holm and Ian Richardson.  England may be a class-society, but those caricatures (with their histrionic performance) only perplexed me, making the entire film a very unstable stance whether I should be angry with them, or chilled with the Ripper.  I get the point, but they should have been restricted the film's subject within the murders, without extending it to its social cause.  <p>About other aspects, I have little to say.  The casting of Heather Graham could have been justified if she looked a little more like a prostitute, or the film did not take itself so seriously.  As the basic story is sentimental and melodramatic, they could have made it more outrageous and suspeseful, and in that case, Ms. Graham might have got away with her uneven  accent.  Of course, then, the Hughes Brothers must take much more liberty with the original book, and its meticulous details would be gone.  In the end, as the result shows, they took a fairly serious approach, and I respect that decision.  However, I confess, as I went through the two hours in theater, I thought I might as well be reading the original book.<p>"From Hell" is a stylish film, but as a thriller it falls short of good pace and enough chill, and as a film noir, its subject is too intriguing and thrilling with detailed information to be made into a flat melodrama.  Using the same subject, Alfred Hitchcock once directed a silent film "The Lodger (1926)."  It remains stylish even today, but he completely changed the related facts to draw audience into his world.  My vote goes to him, but of course, only as a cinema, not as a study of the Ripper.</p></br><a href="../users/A12IDQSS4OW33B.html">A12IDQSS4OW33B</a><br/><p>I hadn't expected this to be a movie about Jack The Ripper. But since Johnny Depp was in it, it had a depressing ending and was interesting overall...like a cross between "Gangs of New York" and "Sleepy Hollow". With enough thrills and chills and mystery, that's like what "From Hell" is. If everyone knew why Jack The Ripper killed prostitutes, there'd be no mystery. But they didn't know. Johnny Depp was not as much of a "wuss" as he was in "Sleepy Hollow", and he still wants to figure everything out by investigating the corpses to try to find clues. Usually, he'd just find grape vines which helped him. You don't see Jack The Ripper's face and he lures the prostitutes to the location that he murders them. That's about it for him. I've read before that in real life, Johnny Depp is actually a huge Jack The Ripper fan, so it's no wonder.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NVW4NUXPOSJB.html">A1NVW4NUXPOSJB</a><br/><p>The acting and filming are very good.

Over 100 years later, the case has never been solved, though there are plenty who claim to know who the real killer is. Enter the Hughes Brothers and their adaption of the popular graphic novel, From Hell. As a movie, it is intelligent and well made, with strong performances and plenty of twists. <p>Johnny Depp gives on of his most memorable performances as Inspector Abberline, who in real life was assigned to the Ripper murders and retired having never solved the case. He is a drug-addicted police inspector who has a reputation for solving crimes through his clairvoyance. His abilities and loyalties are put to the test when prostitutes in Whitechaple, a slum of London, are murdered most foul by the Ripper. The story is nothing new, but new life is breathed into it by the Hughes Brothers artful direction and Rafael Yglesias's colorful screenplay. Also giving stellar performances are Robbie Coltrane as Abberlines intellectual partner, and Ian Holm as the doctor assisting in the investigation. Less than stellar is Heather Graham, though, and her presence as Mary Kelly (one of the victims) and the contrived love story that ensues is the one Achilles heel in this movie. <p>With 2 editions of this DVD out now, the 2-disc set is the one to go with. The well put together &quot;Jack the Ripper: Six Degrees of Separation&quot; is an examination on the murders, the suspects, and the investigation. But the best of all featurettes is actually a hidden easter egg. Highlight &quot;Absinthe makes the heart grow fonder&quot; on Disc 2, and quickly press down and right. You'll see a surgical tool highlighted and it will take you to a 40 minute documentary called &quot;Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution&quot; (snippets of which are seen in the interactive parts of the first featurette). This was produced in 1980 and features an interview with author Stephen Knight, who wrote the book on which the graphic novel, and this movie, is based. It is a fascinating documentary, and one that sketches broad strokes on the killings and the conspiracy that covered them. The other good featurette is the aformentioned &quot;Absinthe makes the heart grow fonder&quot;, which is a breif lesson on the history of the notorious drink, and it's impact on culture and art. Skippable is the horrible Heather Graham-hosted &quot;A View From Hell&quot;, which is a retread of well-known facts. Perhaps good for one or two viewings is the Hughes Brother's &quot;Tour of Murder Sites&quot;, where they walk you around the From Hell set is Prauge. It would have prefered a tour of the actual murder sites. <p>A lot of people didn't like this movie, calling it a glorified slasher movie. While the violence is plentiful, the intelligence of the script and the style if directon make this distinction unfair. It is a great movie, and the 2 DVD treatment will provide you with hours of entertainment, as well as a history lesson on the Jack the Ripper case.</p></br><a href="../users/A1YC9XEDFKXPLK.html">A1YC9XEDFKXPLK</a><br/><p>Johnny Depp seems to be drawn towards playing dark, brooding and troubled characters; he's so damned good at it ! Heather Graham releases a fine performance with her almost perfect accent.  Yet she's way too much of a knock out to be taken seriously as a late 1880' prostitute or &quot;wench&quot; while the other women looked filthy and harsh. Note how her Mary Kelly role is always the cleanest looking one of the bunch of...well, you know. What was fascinating was the alternate take on the Jack the Ripper murdering theory and who his true indentity was and the so-called diabolical motivation for doing what he did and to whom ! Also, the role the Royal British family patriarch figures into the whole plot. Wonder if the real Royal Family appreciated how their ancestral hierarchy was portrayed !<br />However, this film is not for the squeamish as there are several graphic violent blood and gore scenes. One scene in particualr is very disturbing since it depicts the Ripper doing what he does while another character holds the victim. The opium induced imagery adds to the already dark and dreary atmosphere for complete full effect...The ending is also, without giving it away, a complete surprise and shock.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2.html">A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2</a><br/><p>The bizarre nature of the Jack the Ripper case has evolved into a mystique that captivates minds to this day. Who killed those women? What became of the killer? Though the Ripper case was pretty small potatoes compared to some recent killers, taking the lives of seven women, the perpetrator is recorded as the first celebrity murderer, marking part of the transition to the cynicism of the post-modern era. Directors Albert and Allen Hughes attempt to reflect that transition with the latest film of the case, the self-consciously post-modern "From Hell." <p>  The title of the movie reflects the return address of a letter received on October 16th, 1888, by Richard Lusk of the Whitechapel Vigilance Committee, claiming to be from the murderer, along with a piece of one victim's kidney. As an example of this movie's excesses, this preserved kidney is shown on-screen, stewing in blood in a box. This image is emblematic of the amount of blood shed before the camera, which is no small part of why this movie fails. <p>  Johnny Depp plays Inspector Frederick Abberline, assigned to the investigation of the Ripper murders. Some people may consider this a strike against the movie, owing to Depp's past reputation as a professional heartthrob. However, he has demonstrated a capacity for more sophisticated acting in the past, especially while playing opposite Christopher Walken in "Nick of Time" (1995). Dressed in a period costume and speaking in an assumed accent, though, he somehow falls flat. <p>  Abberline is depicted as a debauched denizen of London's opium dens. This should serve as a first clue that we have strayed from historicity. The legendary opium dens were primarily found in the book "The Mystery of Edwin Drood," by Charles Dickens. Few actual establishments ever existed, and even fewer lasted any length of time, since the racist police wanted to chase such dirty Oriental influences away as quickly as possible. Abberline is also fond of absinthe and laudanum, which is hinted to be a way of dealing with the traumatic death of his wife. No one ever bothers to speculate as to how a man can use so many narcotics, spend so much time wrapped up in delusions, and still function as a police officer. <p>  Jack the Ripper is dropped almost whole in our laps at the beginning of the movie as the first two murders are perpetrated very quickly. Abberline seeks to find the murdered, alongside his partner, Sergeant Peter Godley (Robbie Coltrane), who is semi-corrupt and fond of quoting Shakespeare. They get off to a bad start as they follow a false lead, a protection racket with knife-happy enforcers. The initial time spent on the investigation is spent trying to get prostitute Mary Kelly (Heather Graham) to testify against her harassers. <p>  Previews for this movie made much of a supposed romance between Abberline and Kelly. In the actual presentation, however, gives them very little screen time together, and the sudden connection of the two comes without provocation. Shortly thereafter, Kelly disappears from the movie. She is seen briefly outside a small Irish cottage, but once she's out, for all intents and purposes she's out. <p>  It's plain that Heather Graham was introduced to the story because she's pretty. Her character contributes no more to the movie than the other prostitutes, yet Graham is billed as one of the stars. She has limited screen time and lank lines. Her inclusion in the movie is an example of the abuse of the star system in movies. If you're going to see "From Hell" because you liked Graham in "Bowfinger" or "Austin Powers," save your money. She's a drag on this film. <p>  The movie is lushly photographed, attempting to capture the degradation of Whitechapel in 1888. Location shots throughout the Czech Republic, where more 19th-Century buildings survive, lend a depth of realism that studio work couldn't reproduce. However, the reality of the environment is interrupted with such modern devices as stop-motion photography, and pans of camera angles that the average Londoner of that day wouldn't have been able to perceive. <p>  Some of the shots are marred by a comic-book appearance. This is not surprising, since the movie is based on a graphic novel by Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell. In the transition from comic to film, however, the Hughes brothers elect to retain many of the visual elements of a comic book. Mixing images creates a very post-modern appearance that doesn't jibe well with the historical origins of the film. <p>  Moreover, the plot is too complex. Dragging in issues relating to Freemasonry, venereal disease, Queen Victoria, the Catholic Church, early psychiatry and crude medicine, anti-Semitism, misogyny, and class conflict, the story gallops along at a relentless pace, giving viewers very little time to pause and drink in what they've just seen. The frenetic pace is very tiring. Perhaps the Hughes brothers would have been better served trying to turn this into a TV miniseries. On the other hand, if they'd done that, they couldn't fit in the nudity, drug use, and profound amounts of blood. <p>  There have been some very good historical films of the Jack the Ripper case. "The Lodger" (1944) comes quickly to mind. This movie, despite the battery of names supporting it, never makes the transition to a movie from the comic book from which it came.</p></br><a href="../users/A17FLA8HQOFVIG.html">A17FLA8HQOFVIG</a><br/><p>This 2001 film was produced and directed by the Hughes Brothers and based on a graphic novel by Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell.  As you know, graphic novels are actually comic strips and, even though there is no animation in the film, &quot;From Hell&quot; has the look and feel of that kind of exaggeration throughout.  <p>In 1888, there were some real and unsolved murders of prostitutes in London by someone nicknamed Jack the Ripper.  That's what this story is based on.  It stars Johnny Depp as the inspector who must solve the case.  He loves to do drugs and in several scenes he's either smoking a pipe in an opium den or cooking up some laudanum at home.  His visions become clues to solving crimes and he's good at his job.  <p>The murdered women are always surgically violated and this leads the good inspector to suspect that the murderer knows a lot about human anatomy.  And so he seeks out the medical establishment to help him and we all see more than we ever wanted to know about lobotomies.  The camera doesn't actually focus on details of the murders themselves, but there is so much talk about them and they are described so graphically, that it made me shudder with disgust.<p>There's the search for the killer of course, and there's also a romance between the inspector and a pretty young woman played by Heather Graham who sure could use a few lessons in acting.  Ian Holm is cast as the royal surgeon and, as the plot thickens, one of the suspects is even a member of the royal family.  I found it all quite silly as well as disgusting although I think it captured the spirit of the myth of Victorian England as a harborer of dirty streets and dirty secrets.<p>The film is intoxicating in a way, moved fast, and set up a mystery that was intriguing.  But there were so many absolutely sickening scenes that I soon grew to hate it.</p></br><a href="../users/A356TJCTCLDN89.html">A356TJCTCLDN89</a><br/><p>Johnny Depp should never do a movie that is not directed by Tim Rice. He's a terrific actor but he just doesn't cut it as a opium smoking Inspector Frederick Abberline. He's too young and frankly, if Abberline was this weird he wouldn't have lasted on the force.  Heather Graham is completely out of her depth. She looks wrong for the part, (How many street walkers look this healthy and pretty?) can't do the accent and can't act. Compare this to the Michael Caine version and you'll see how weak the Hughes Brothers' effor was.</p></br><a href="../users/A228JH8V9Y700G.html">A228JH8V9Y700G</a><br/><p>There are more books about Jack The Ripper in print today than of all the US presidents combined.  No really.  What is it about this story that draws us in?  Evil?  Mystery?  The seemy side of life?  Conspiracy theories?  Maybe.  So many things seem so clear now, while so many things will never be solved today.<br /><br />This movie was just ok, I share no illusions about it being otherwise.  What I would recommend you do is watch the special features with the Jack The Ripper documentary first, then the movie.  The story is rather choppy and tends to bore, plus the people the actors portray are softened up quite a bit to the point where you might actually like them when in real life they probably were not so likable.<br /><br />In the roughneck White Cross district in London during the Victorian age, a few prostitutes are murdered.  Nothing to bat an eye at, as most women involved in prosititution will most likely be the victims of violent crime at some point.  What is odd, as the theories would later project, that all of these women in this particular neighborhood knew each other.  They knew each other fairly well, two were even roommates at one point or another, and they all operated out of the same stretch of street when they picked up their johns.  The theory is that they were being targeted, if you believe the most popular of popular theories, as they were being silenced.  These women were blackmailing the royal family as they were witness to the marriage of one of Queen Victoria's sons to a common woman (formerly of their profession), in a Catholic ceremony, and birth of a potential threat to the royal liniage.<br /><br />The movie, curiously enough, skirts around the fact that all the women, both of the prostitute circle and the mother of baby Alice (the child in question), did not know that the wealthy man she was being kept by was a prince.  They were portrayed moreso as victims, there was never a hint that they were attempting to gain from this knowledge.  The last of the prostitutes in real life was the one most brutally murdered, but in the movie goes off to care for baby Alice in a secluded location far away.  Alice lived a long life and died in the 1950s.  But no one ever seemed to indicated if she was privy to this information or if she lived her life blissfully unaware.  There were too many things they turned into Disney aspects and too many things they left unresolved.</p></br><a href="../users/A2LBG01YBSUP96.html">A2LBG01YBSUP96</a><br/><p>ONCE AGAIN,THE CURSE OF A HORRIBLE ENDING DOOMS THE WHOLE OF THE MOVIE!TRUTH BE TOLD,I NEVER READ THE COMIC BOOK OF WHICH THIS WAS BASED ON.I KNEW COMING INTO THIS THAT WAS THE SOURCE OF THE MOVIE.WHAT I DIDNT,COULDNT SEE COMING WAS THIS CONSPIRACY THEORY OF AN ENDING.ATLEAST THEY DIDNT WAIT 4 MONTHS AND PUT THIS 2DISC SET OUT LIKE SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO MANY OTHER RE-RELEASES ARE DOING.AT ...,YOU CAN WASTE YOUR MONEY BUYING WORSE,BUT I SUGGEST YOU EJECT AT THE 1HR/50MIN MARK.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>When you have a film by the name of `From Hell' that revolves around one of the most notorious and legendary serial killers of all time you kind of expect the terror to mount in unprecedented levels.  You salivate at the very idea of the film achieving and even surpassing all expectations as it devours you with that uneasy feeling of imminent repulsion and sheer dread.<br /><br />Despite fantastically realized production design and sharply implemented edits; `From Hell' loses most of its staying power thanks to a strange lack of fear.<br /><br />The film attacks the story of Jack the Ripper from the vantage point of a Scotland Yard sleuth by the name of Frederick Abberline.  Abberline has opium influenced visions of the slayings perpetrated by the Ripper, and so he uses these visions to further his investigation, picking away at the mystery behind the blood.  Along the way he is aided by a street walker (bet they weren't referred to as those in that day) and derailed by nearly everyone else.  Uncovering the truth behind the murders is apparently a dangerous journey; one that certain members of society would work their fingers to the bone to make sure went unfulfilled.<br /><br />When the opium induced fog has lifted, it becomes sadly apparent that `From Hell' is not all that it could have been.  For a film of such salacious subject, it is surprisingly mild.  Despite the influx of prostitutes there is barely a scene of sexuality, and the murders themselves are faintly hinted at or contain minor moments of shock gore that is forgettable and underwhelming.  This could have been forgiven had the films core been devoted to a more fleshed out and detailed depiction of the `inner monster' dealing these dastardly deeds, but instead the revelatory climax is weakened by a mere surface attempt at identifying a monster.  Sure, the film offers it's `viewpoint', but it under-works it.<br /><br />The film wants to be a horror film but it lacks the horror.<br /><br />Johnny Depp delivers the same performance he gives in all his other movies, and he does a decent enough job to escape my usual dismembering of his talent (the man just needs to go away).  Heather Graham tries her hardest here, but the script is so unkind to her (she could have handled a deeper character, don't you think) and it made her a forgettable clich&eacute;.  I love Ian Holm, and he definitely steals a lot of the audience's attention, but I feel that it isn't always in a good way.<br /><br />The uneven nature of the script (which really should have been reworked a few dozen times before production) does no justice to a tale that should be brandished upon the minds of all.  There are a few attempts to capitalize off of this particular tale; and this is probably the least successful.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>From Hell starring Johnny Depp is set against the backdrop of the famed killer, Jack the Ripper. Depp is a great actor but even his unique talent can't save this boring, slow-moving train wreck. Who cast Heather Graham?! She is one of the worst female actors ever!! She can't even pull off any kind of accent, her performance is painful to watch. This film tries to be scary and grounbreaking but I lost interest halfway through, snooze...</p></br><a href="../users/AIFNOZKR9WTYI.html">AIFNOZKR9WTYI</a><br/><p>Kind of a mixed-up version of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, wherein Johnny Depp smokes drugs and somebody else commits a crime.<br />The opening scene gives you a pretty good idea of the sort of movie this is going to be:  panning into a computer generated London abyss, we see varied scenes of filth and degradation, including a cameo by the elephant man.  I guess he was just happening by or somink.  Which brings us to the subject of Johnny Depp's accent.<br />While living in Japan I was once informed that a certain other gaijin male was a kind of laughing stock among the Japanese:  though he had learnt to speak fluent Japanese, he had apparently learnt from a woman and so he spoke fluent FEMALE Japanese.  Well, the same thing seems to have happened to Johnny Depp.<br />As to Heather Graham's accent, if I were the directors I would have taken a whip to her:  flogged her mercilessly.  Also, I would have insisted that she prepare for her role as a low-grade prostitute by working as a prostitute for some time.<br />But anyway, so Johnny Depp smokes stuff and somebody else knifes a prostitute in a dark alley.  They roust him out of the opium den in which he is languishing and take him by the scruff of the neck to get a load of a body in the morgue.  HE mumbles words to the effect that yeah, that was the broad he seen in his revery and it becomes clear that being bombed on opium is Inspector Depp's way of solving crimes.<br />The best thing to do, if you are compelled to rent - I mean buy, yes, buy - the film is to freeze-frame it on a shot of Big Ben that comes on about 40 minutes into the picture.  Just give yourself a hard copy right there and make up the rest of the movie in your imagination.</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>The time: 1888.  The place: London, Whitechapel district (the Victorian equivalant to the modern Red Light district). Mary Kelly (Heather Graham) is a beautiful and buxom lass who's life in London didn't turn out anything like she planned, struggling just to survive working in the world's oldest profession.  Mary and her friends live a harsh existence. Their only comforts are their own companionship and the belief that their lives cannot possibly get any worse than it already is. But they do. Their friend (and former prostitute) Ann, is kidnapped from her home and disappears.  Days later a member of their fellowship is brutally murdered. The women realize that they have unknowingly become a part of a conspiracy in which they have no control and are being eliminated one by one.  Meanwhile, the gruesome murder of the Whitechapel girl has gained the attention of a brilliant police officer, Inspector Fred Abberline (Johnny Depp). Abberline claims he had visions about the murder. The dreams continue, more prostitutes are brutally murdered by an anonymous killer who is dubbed Jack the Ripper and claims that he has been sent from Hell, and Abberline becomes increasingly entangled in the wicked web as he falls in love with Mary Kelly and races to solve the case before she meets Jack.<br /><br />The Hughes brothers pulled off an impressive horror/suspense film with FROM HELL. At it's most basic level, the movie is a slasher movie. But FROM HELL is a slasher flick done with taste. The film is rather gruesome in certain sections and is fairly historically accurate. However, the brothers feared the possibility of a NC-17 rating if too much was revealed and used a great deal of restraint in re-creating the famous murders. It is a testament to their skills that they were able to re-produce the real-life terror felt at the time, but without displaying all the grizzly details.  Not only that but the historical re-creation of 1888 Whitechapel is amazing. Almost every minute detail is reconstructed to perfection.<br /><br />Johnny Depp captures the essence of the real-life Abberline despite the fact that the real Abberline was short, balding, paunchy, and lived to a fairly ripe-old age.  Heather Graham does a decent job of portraying Mary Kelly, though it would have been nice to see a more real-looking actress in the role--Graham is just too Glamour Girlish.<br /><br />There have been many Jack the Ripper movies made over the years, but FROM HELL is one of the better ones (despite the inprobable conclusion). The movie is based upon the graphic novel by Alan Moore and though their are several changes, the movie stays true to the spirit of the original text.  Just don't think about it too much.</p></br><a href="../users/A1HO9J4DCQDGP9.html">A1HO9J4DCQDGP9</a><br/><p>Johnny Depp is a versatile actor who puts in an excellent performance as the tormented Police Inspector, Fred Abberline working on the infamous Jack the Ripper case during the reign of Queen Victoria.  Taking many Jack the Ripper legends, the Hughes brothers have created an amazing patchwork quilt of interlinking stories that are drawn together to reveal the identity of a mass murderer who was never bought to justice.  The most famous legend is that the Queen's son and heir to the throne married a commoner, Annie Crook and she bore him a child, and it is this setting that sets the film off on a ride to hell and back.  Abberline doggedly searches for a killer who has taken on mythical qualities, and bit-by-bit he puts together an intricate plot, of royal intrigue and scandal, insanity and corruption in high places.  Not that Abberline is uncorrupted himself, addicted to opium and haunted by the death of his wife in childbirth, he is already half-way to hell himself but redemption comes in the form of Mary Kelly, a beautiful fallen Irish girl who he strives to protect against all odds.  But Abberline is up against the British establishment and the might of Her Majesty's empire, in the guise of Sir Charles Warren played excellently by Ian Richardson and Sir William Gull, Ian Holm at his schizophrenic best.  We are treated to a tour around Victorian London with all its vices from drug taking to rampant prostitution whilst we head for the shattering climax that will reveal everything.  &quot;From Hell&quot; is a film of extraordinary color and vicious vitality.  The camera work is superb and the constant shadowy silhouette of Jack the Ripper gives an eerie feel to an already creepy film.  Blood is aplenty in this film and it is not a movie for the squeamish.  The worst scene is at the end when Jack kills Mary Kelly (there's a little twist here that will amuse those of a dark nature) and Ian Holm just explodes on the screen with the madness of someone on a holy quest for the British Empire.  The lobotomy scene where Annie is driven into madness is also quite disturbing, but there is justice for Annie in an ironic twist at the end of the film.  This movie isn't a horror film though it has horrific qualities.  I do think that many scenes were cut out which I hope will be incorporated onto DVD in the future because I notice from the cast list there are characters we never saw on screen like Annie Crook's parents.  However, despite this minor detail &quot;From Hell&quot; is a truly amazing film, with just enough suspense to make you sit on the edge of your seat, and just enough gore to make you, swallow hard and think &quot;oh gross&quot; before being distracted by another scene that makes you think real hard because of its complexity.  On a final note, Robbie Coltrane is the bomb as Abberline's cynical but good-hearted Sergeant, Peter Godley whose understanding of human nature is understated and truly awesome.  A cast of quality actors all the way through, from the doomed friends of Mary Kelly, through to little Alice Crook, the daughter of the ill-fate Annie and her husband, Albert, aka the future King of England.</p></br><a href="../users/APOGXH3A74CM3.html">APOGXH3A74CM3</a><br/><p>The performances of Ian Holm and Johnny Depp really make this a movie worth watching, as does all the attention to detail in recreating 1888 London.<br /><br />The story moved along quickly and was very suspenseful, exploring all the little hells of the main characters.

It's a chilling tale, told with remarkable restraint, considering the film's subject matter.  Only in the final few scenes do we get the real gore-fest that we've been waiting for and when it comes it makes the hair on the back of one's neck stand on end.<br />Even more scary than the film is the BBC documentary included on disc 2 of this special edition, a revealing and haunting look into the real life murders in White Chapel with tons of documented photo archival material that will make for some pretty sleepless nights once you've seen them.  There's also a bunch of other extra material that is equally compelling and revolting.  I loved this movie for its shock value and artistry. The cast is superb.  The screenplay moves effortlessly along from one plot point to the next, creating plenty of doubt and fear in the mind of the viewer along the way.  This is film making in the grand style of the old Universal horror movies, told with a scope that surpasses anything done before and absolutely shocking to watch.  Enjoy.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>The Hughes Brothers bring us this surprisingly good, and maybe all too believeable, thriller based on the graphic novel of the same name.  Johnny Depp stars as an opium smoking Scotland Yard detective assigned to bring Jack the Ripper to justice by using his special "talent": smoking opium with some other drugs to have psychic visions, and naturally, it works.  Eventually Depp uncovers a vast conspiracy that even has links to the throne, and all is not what it seems.  Heather Graham stars as a prostitute who Depp falls for, and Ian Holm absolutely steals the entire movie as a washed up surgeon.  The cinematography is superbly shot, and Depp gives a fine performace as usual, but Graham is just not believeable in her role, not acting wise I mean, but she is just too beautiful to be a prostitute from that time period, the other actresses look their roles (no offense to them).  There are some nice DVD extras as well, and the entire package is well rounded, so if your a fan of Depp or are looking for a different type of thriller, there aren't many better choices than From Hell.</p></br><a href="../users/AD2BIAIH78QI5.html">AD2BIAIH78QI5</a><br/><p>This started as another of my "let me just see whatever is playing today" excursions to the movie theatre. Most of the other movies had started already, and then I saw that "From Hell" hadn't yet; all I could remember about it was that it was a period piece, so off I went.<p>Well! It was a Jack the Ripper movie!<p>Now, I used to be rather interested in that case as a lilGal, having read different accounts of the Whitechapel murders and seen a few Ripper movies. One criticism I do have to make is that as things were going along, I had a strange feeling of deja-vu: uh oh, wasn't this sort of lifted from "Murder by Decree"? Yeah, it was, although no reviewer has commented on that yet. That was when Christopher Plummer's Sherlock Holmes had a go at it, with James Mason as Watson.  <p>This time, a Holmes-like Cockney detective played by Johnny Depp is the master sleuth in charge of things. I liked his portrayal a lot. I also liked seeing old vet Ian Holm as a proper Victorian doctor whom Depp consults about certain "technicalities".<p>There was, however, a most improbable moment when Detective Depp brings the rather outlandishly dressed prostitute Heather Graham to the Royal Portrait Gallery or some such to make the equivalent of an ID from a mug shot, a full-length portrait of "you know who" if you have read enough about this case before. But wouldn't other people have been surprised to see this REALLY shockingly dressed trollop strolling around the museum? Maybe it's just me.<p>Still and all, I got my money's worth this time and enjoyed this version of the most famous unsolved murders of the 19th century.</p></br><a href="../users/AYG1U47VFZ165.html">AYG1U47VFZ165</a><br/><p>Heavy on atmosphere and even heavier on conspiracy theories, FROM HELL boasts outstanding performances from Johnny Depp and Heather Graham as two lost souls crying out for one another's company while remaining caught in the twists and turns of Jack the Ripper's nefarious deeds toward the end of the 1900s.  A fascinatingly brisk tale, not for the squeamish of heart or stomach, but one that dares to draw its one conclusions when other pictures have failed to do so.  Sit back, have some popcorn, and enjoy the suspense.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JH5J1KQAUBMP.html">A1JH5J1KQAUBMP</a><br/><p>By now the gimmick of the brilliant, renegade investigator whose special insights into the nature of serial murder border on, if not actually cross into, the paranormal has become rather tiresome.  However, this type of character has apparently become an indispensible part of the serial killer genre (what does it say about us that such a genre exists?), and directors Allen and Albert Hughes have presented an interesting twist by making it necessary for Scotland Yard inspector Abberline (Johnny Depp), hot on the trail of Jack the Ripper, to use opium in order to access his gift.  This adds to the overall dark and hopeless tone of this fine film, and ultimately makes Depp's character rather tragic.<p>This is a very stylish, atmospheric film that occurs almost entirely at night on foggy London streets.  I enjoyed the sad romantic subplot, although Heather Graham's Mary Kelly is too well-scrubbed to be a convincing Whitehall prostitute.  I also enjoyed the Freemason angle and way the Hughes brothers focus on the importance of class distinctions and how the wealthy fashion their own brand of justice.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZLROGIL2V7GV.html">A2ZLROGIL2V7GV</a><br/><p>&quot;From Hell&quot; is not for people with weak stomachs.

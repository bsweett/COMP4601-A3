Yes the shower scene was good (ha) but what grabbed me was the robot's personality. Close to human as ever.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VZLLDNLURGJB.html">A1VZLLDNLURGJB</a><br/><p>I ROBOT, starring Will Smith, was a fine four star movie having an interesting plot, good acting, fine direction and lots of action.  I think the film was almost too ambitious from the point of view of special effects. Will Smith stated that I ROBOT had more special effects than any film he has made to date, including INDEPENDANCE DAY. Although I really appreciate good effects, I would have preferred some more of Will Smith's entertaining acting, something he was permitted to deliver in I AM LEGEND. He was too much of a stunt man in this film.  I also found the full scale mechanical effects to be much more credibly done than the abundant computer graphics which though beautiful, looked a bit too stylish giving certain portions of the film the appearance of anime.<br /><br />In the literary sense, the original laws of robotics were invented by Isaac Asimov, one of the most prolific science fiction writers of the 20th century and certainly the most influential on the many recent films concerning robots.  Many Hollywood science fiction films have been based on Asimov's three laws and find it helpful to quote them. Other films refer to another of Asimov's inventions, the positronic brain. Bicentennial Man directly quoted the Three Laws of Robotics and Star Trek's android robot, DATA, was often said to have a positronic brain.<br /><br />The Three Laws of Robotics hold up very well with time and appear to be an inescapably logical way to define the important features of behavior in civilian robots. The laws, which are quoted numerous times in the film, are:<br /><br />1) A robot may not injure a human being, or through inaction allow a human being to come to harm.<br />2) A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings, so long as this does not conflict with the First Law.<br />3) A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not interfere with the First or Second Law.<br /><br />This is not the first film to predict that the outcome of the three laws will be a computer or robot revolution intended to dominate man. This is based on the idea that man needs to be protected from his own warlike nature.  COLLOSUS, The Forbin Project made a very similar prediction, and the concept of a robot police state was also visited in THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL, though not attributed to the three laws. 2001 and 2010 made a similar projection but for entirely different reasons. Since the days of Frankenstein and probably before that a constant theme of sci-fi and horror is the artificially created turning on their creator.<br /><br />I believe that Asimov would defend his laws of robotics as being effective in assuring safety, while granting this film the artistic license to use this speculation. I also think that the idea of a robot being able to rebel in violation of the specific wording of the first law is more far fetched than a sentient robot itself.<br /><br />It is sad that we have not witnessed more humanoid robotic developments in the United States, the country of Asimov's fictional US ROBOTS AND MECHANICAL MEN.  It is HONDA's ASIMO which appears to be the most highly developed commercial robot. Because of the fear and suspicion that people might harbor against robots, HONDA chose to build their latest version of humanoid robot child sized. The big lumbering HONDA robots preceding it were a bit too intimidating and "Gort" like.  HONDA is to be congratulated for their pioneering work and will probably see some return on their investment when variations of ASIMO are actually used in science fiction films, as museum guides, and as a general purpose domestic robot initially used to assist disabled or elderly people and ultimately perform all forms of household work. Although not yet fulley autonomous,  ASIMO can currently walk and run on two legs, climb up and down stairs, play a decent game of soccer, recognize people and objects, speak, hear, recognize voices and react to speech appropriately. I would speculate that full autonomy for ASIMO will come within the next 15 years at most, only being limited by the number of calculations per second performed by the  supporting computer hardware and software. For more info about ASIMO search the web using GOOGLE.<br /><br />I sometimes wonder how much public interest there would be in sending another robot to Mars if the next lander were based on an ASIMO type design?  People might relate to seeing a bipedal humanoid robot walking on the surface of Mars, testing mineral samples for signs of water while occasionally looking into the camera and waving. Needless to say, NASA public relations would benefit immensely.<br /><br />The three laws of robotics could not be employed without modification in any military robot which might be under development in some secret government lab which would need to destroy human life in the course of assigned duties. Of course, I wouldn't care to imagine what we may have developed for the military, and just how fantastic such robot technology might be once permitted to trickle down to the circles of commerce. At that time it would be necessary to represent something with the effect of Asimov's three laws in these advanced machines.<br /><br />In the mid 70's (circa 1975) Isaac Asimov made an appearance at New York University, where my wife was attending graduate school. We went to witness his presentation in a packed college audience and he was every bit as impressive as his writings.  Based on the questions and answers, the audience included at least a few people who were familiar with and who had been influenced by Asimov's writings.</p></br><a href="../users/A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I.html">A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I</a><br/><p>This is movie was as good as I hoped it would be. Since it was written by the man who wrote The Minority Report, my favorite book, I expected great things from this movie and that's exactly what I got. The story never dulled, from start to finish, this film was excellent and action packed. Will Smith does a great job in lead.<br /><br />The robots really are the stars of the film; they are done very well and very entertaining to watch. Every minute the robots are shown, it just makes the film all that more entertaining.<br /><br />If you love good Scifi movies, you have found it here.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VQSFORKH8B7O.html">A3VQSFORKH8B7O</a><br/><p>"I, Robot" is a good action film with spectacular special effects aided by superb CG visual effects. As for the story itself, it is a fascinating premise that is acted out in an "decent" story. Will Smith does some of his best work to date, and Bridget Moynahan is beautiful and engaging. The rest of the cast does as good a job as they can with the slight let-down of a story.<br /><br />Overall, "I, Robot" is an above-standard action epic. It may not be the greatest action film ever, but it is better than "The Day After Tomorrow!"<br /><br />The current DVD presents a commentary track and a twelve-minute featurette. A 2-Disc Collector's DVD Edition is coming out in May. I suggest you wait for that one to buy it! It will be more loaded than this DVD!<br /><br />Movie/DVD Grade: B+</p></br><a href="../users/A2WP0GOTX13MG4.html">A2WP0GOTX13MG4</a><br/><p>'I, Robot' tells the story of a future in which humanity has adopted robotic servants to supplement their daily lives.  The robots have been programmed with three laws (paraphrased below):<br /><br />I.  Robots cannot harm humans.<br /><br />II.  Robots must obey humans, but law I controls.<br /><br />III.  Robots must protect themselves, but only if such protection does not conflict with the first two laws.<br /><br />This arrangement seems to be working well until one day when detective Del Spooner, played by Will Smith, gets a call to investigate a murder.  The victim is Dr. Alfred Lanning, played by James Cromwell, and it appears to be a suicide.  The thing about Dr. Lanning is that he is the inventor of the modern robot, and the company he works for is about to launch a new line of robots to the world.  Suspicions aroused, Detective Spooner investigates...<br /><br />This movie is based off an Isaac Asimov novel, which I admit I have not read.  The premise is interesting:  what happens when robots that have been programmed to benefit humanity through the application of three laws suddenly start acting in violation of the laws?  What is causing them to do that?  Can man creat an artificial construct that has man's capabilities?<br /><br />As for the movie itself, I found it to be pretty slick.  I've been told that it is not the thinker the book is, but since this is an action vehicle starring Will Smith, that can be expected (nothing against Will Smith, he was great in this movie--perfect for the part).  The landscape of Chicago in the year 2035 came off really well.  Unlike a lot of movies, the producers and director of 'I, Robot' chose to paint a future that has maintained many more elements of the present than futuristic devices such as wildly futuristic clothing and gadgets.  The cars and buildings of the future feel like they fit in rather well.<br /><br />The story movies along at a good pace.  There is not much in the way of down time.  The clues to the resolution are well placed.  There are a few predictable plot lines, but they don't detract from the movie as a whole.  There are a few red herrings regarding Bridget Moynahan's character.  I was somewhat surprised when her character was not as complicated as I expected her to turn out.<br /><br />Overall, its a good movie.  Will Smith found himself another good Sci-Fi vehicle.  His portrayal of dective Spooner was excellent.  The DVD has plenty of extras.  This movie is rewatchable.  I've been contemplating checking out the book the movie is based on, and I'm curious to see what the differences in the plot are considering when the book was written (some decades ago) and some of the devices that were used in the book.<br /><br />Grade:  4.25 stars</p></br><a href="../users/A15Q7ABIU9O9YZ.html">A15Q7ABIU9O9YZ</a><br/><p>I'm sorry. I don't believe that the Directorial Staff and writers of I, Robot really wrestled much with the purity of Asimov, Bradbury and Heinlein. When you watch the credits of a movie based on a book like, for example, Lehane's Mystic River, you'll see a reference, ' . . . from the book,' or '. . . based in part on . . . ' And then there's '<br /><br />. . . from an idea . . .'<br /><br />This is even more of a reach then that. Will Smith is actually a remarkable actor growing from a humble, 30-minute humorous quips (Fresh Prince) TV background. Now you can even say, 'he's the man.' And additionally, going back to the Ali days, he spends a lot of time in the gym. Because he is most assuredly,  buffed.<br /><br />But that's it. Not a serious examination of AI, interesting dialogue (and that's all) between Moynahan and Smith, and a Lassie like slobbering grin from the Robot Character "Sonny" that we are left to assume (yes, theologians) has a soul.<br /><br />Great special effects. Boring, predictable dialogue. The usual tedious quips the writers force Mr. Smith to make instead of just letting him act. NOTHING ELSE. 3 stars. Larry Scantlebury</p></br><a href="../users/AWPODHOB4GFWL.html">AWPODHOB4GFWL</a><br/><p>Will Smith sure has bulked up and it proves worthwhile in this futuristic thriller about robotic help.  Science fiction fans will not be impressed with the average repetitive special effects, but it does prove to be a good thrill ride.  Del Spooner (Will Smith) is distrustful of robots and you find out why later, although according to the three `rules', no robot can ever hurt a human being.  The plot is simple, but has enough action and plot twists to keep you entertained.  The car race scenes are exciting (only in that Del Spooner takes on an army of robots), if not somewhat unbelievable.  The special effects are reminiscent of "Tron", which proves that Hollywood could have done a lot better.  In any event, the ending wraps things up nicely and proves that it might not be the end of the world and there are good robots and bad robots - just like people.  Enjoy the ride.<br /><br />There are the average number of extras - nothing exciting, however, the DTS 5.1 Surround Sound is the best part.</p></br><a href="../users/AMG2LF8MLUDN1.html">AMG2LF8MLUDN1</a><br/><p>I found Will Smith's acting to be a little overdone but other than that, this is a good action film.  Smith's tough guy swagger reminded me of John Travolta's walk in Saturday Night Fever.  It was totally out of place but I should note that he is still growing as an film artist and developing his talents.  This is a CGI driven film and those effects do not fail to please.<br /><br />Smith's role is one of a homocide detective that hates robots.  His job is to investigate a murder that he suspects has been committed by a robot.  Robots are programmed with the 3 laws (see the film) so it's inconceivable to folks that a robot could have committed murder.<br /><br />It's a nice murder mystery type of film with a twist.  The usual warnings about robots apply.The special effects are great.<br /><br />Parental advisory:  There is a small bit of nudity but no sexual situations.  There is a small amount of foul language and plenty of violence.  I suggest a viewing age of at least 13.</p></br><a href="../users/A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z.html">A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z</a><br/><p>From start to finish, this DVD  is just magnificent.<br /><br />The Sound is engineered superbly, and you absolutely MUST  have 5.1 surround to comprehend things.<br /><br />The cast is great, but the FX  are beyond great.<br /><br />This version of the film includes few extras ( technically one major one ), but the scenes are just brilliant, and each eye-popping surprise is just excellent.<br /><br />Aurally, and visually, a stunning work, that is worth every penny for the DVD. Crank up the sound too ... the opening credits are just great.</p></br><a href="../users/A16FUU8WW76QFY.html">A16FUU8WW76QFY</a><br/><p>I found this film to be an uncommon marriage of action and thought provocation.  While 'I, Robot' is chockfull of effects and stunts, it still sets your mind to work.  The only real gripe I have about this movie is the fact that Will Smith's wisecracks are getting a bit stale-this isn't 'Fresh Prince of Bel Air', know what I mean?  How about some straightup dramatic acting for once?<br /><br />The plot of 'Robot' is very loosely based on Isaac Asimov's classic SciFi book of the same name.  The focus is man's growing dependence on intelligent machines, and is the time coming when they are able to ask themselve moral questions such as, 'Where  do I come from?'  We are attempting to build them in our own image.  Even today, we are designing robots to do things we humans feel are tedious or just plain too dirty for us.  The time is not far away when we will have humanoid machines in our very midst.<br /><br />Such ground has been explored before; Spielberg's 'A.I.', 'Colossus: The Forbin Project' and the 'Terminator' films asked the question 'At what point do machines become self aware?'  When this occurs, will they collectively analyze their masters' flawed method of existence and decide the way of logic is superior?  We already entrust a large proportion of our lives to artificial intelligence.  What would happen if they decided to take control?<br /><br />'I Robot' places this premise in a context intertwined with human feelings of loss and prejudice.  Director Alex Proyas, who seems to thrive in this sort of atmosphere (The Crow, Dark City), gives us a world where robots are as common as the family car.  Even 30 years from now, some still don't feel comfortable with machines in charge of so much of their lives.  Ironically, 'Sonny' a certain special robot, seems to have more humanity than some of the people in this film.<br /><br />The director, writer and actors have done their jobs well. The effects crew has created a realistic future society.  The action and stunts are top notch, but in the end, this is really a film about emotion, feeling, and self sacrifice.  An unusual mix to be sure-but somehow it all works.  The viewer really cares about Will Smith's detective and 'Sonny' the humanoid machine.  Why can't more SciFi/action films be this good?  A solid 4 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>Those expecting a connection to Isaac Asimov's classic book which this is supposedly based on will be more than disappointed here, as I, Robot is pure, solid, entertaining mainstream action with Alex Proyas, director of Dark City and the original Crow at the helm.  A beefed up Will Smith plays paranoid cop Del Spooner in future Chicago, and needless to say due to a past tragedy, he doesn't trust the "helper" robots which are abundant in society.  Spooner gets his wish of a robot possibly being a bad guy when a new design of robot (Alan Tudyk of the upcoming Serenity and TV's short lived Firefly) is accused of murdering his creator (James Cromwell).  Soon enough, Spooner is knee deep in a conspiracy involving this new model of robot, the obedience of the "3 laws of robotics", and whether this artificial life can evolve.  While it hardly bears any resemblance to Asimov's book, the spirit of it is still here, and Smith does a good job as the paranoid hero.  The CGI effects are well done for the most part, and Tudyk is superb as well.  It's not a perfect action/sci-fi movie, but for what it is, it's still pretty good.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EJYJC25OJVKK.html">A3EJYJC25OJVKK</a><br/><p>Although I sadly never got to see it on the big screen, I finally got to see it on cable and WOW! "I Robot" is a suprisingly great movie and among the best that Will Smith has done in recent years.<br /><br /> Set in Chicago around the summer of 2035 (I'll be 52 then), a scientist named Doctor Alfred Lanning (James Cromwell) is found dead after going through an office window and falling to his death in the lobby of the corporate headquarters. An agent who is highly technophobic (spiteful of advanced technology, preferring 'old-fashioned' lifestyles) decides to find out who commited the crime and believes that the perpetrator of the crime was in fact one of the 'modern' robots that was designed by Lanning.<br /><br /> The acting is absolutely great in this movie. Although I'm skeptical of Chicago looking like that at that point, I loved the way that they made Chicago look in this time frame with the John Hancock and Sears Towers still standing out despite the looming heights of the corporate headquarters. The look also was great to see with the 'L' trains although I'm not too sure about the 'expressway' in relation to the Sears Tower. If it was the Eisenhower Expressway in there, it would be farther south unless they upgraded Lake or Madison Avenues into elevated expressways. Other than that, the look of CHicago in 2035 is great!<br /><br /> The special effects are excellent and not too overdone. While not necessarily a 'thinker's movie, "I Robot" is sometimes unsettling in the way it makes one wonder if robot technology advances to the point that even they can think independently in the same patterns that the human brain can although the human brain is FAR too complex to duplicate in even todays most advanced technology.<br /><br /> Anyhow, "I Robot" is a great summer popcorn flick and is definately a movie worth checking out, if not buying. I guarantee it. Well done Will! I look forward to more movies from you man! :)</p></br><a href="../users/A1XJOSJN6FHFO0.html">A1XJOSJN6FHFO0</a><br/><p>I knew that any movie with Will Smith in it had to be a winner, and I was not disappointed. Set in the future, robots have been given many jobs and are being used to help humans.<br /><br />Will Smith, who plays Detective Spooner, dislikes robots for personal reasons and is not surprised when trouble erupts between humans and robots, after the death of their creator.<br /><br />The movie becomes quite intense as he finds out the robots are planning to take over mankind, for their own good of course!<br /><br />This is a great movie full of suspense and adventure and a really good storyline that holds your interest through the entire movie.  I recommend this one for the entire family.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L8HRCM60W0W7.html">A1L8HRCM60W0W7</a><br/><p>...is that it just doesn't have enough characters. With such a cut and dry theme -- machines taking over, etc etc -- it is imperative to maintain a modicum of realism.<br /><br />While the well-made film offers a delectable blend of CGI and some mild humour along with an unexpected twist, it fails miserably by providing only one hero (and his generic love interest from the lab) who single-handedly saves the day against hordes of robots that crawl out of the woodwork to supposedly take a city under their reins.<br /><br />Wouldn't a real city call for armies or some such well trained forces into action? The end result here is thus too ludicrous to be enjoyable as Will Smith squishes all the machinery to glory all on his own.<br /><br />Watchable rental if you're really into science fiction or a major Smith buff, otherwise a fairly immemorable summer flick.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>Based on the classic novel by Isaac Asimov, "I, Robot" is a tasty sci-fi elixir with a nifty whodunit twist.<br /><br />Will Smith plays Del Spooner, a Chicago homicide detective who has always harbored deep suspicions about the servile robots who are fast becoming common household items in the year 2035.  One day, Spooner is called in to investigate the suicide of Dr. Alfred Lanning, the inventor largely responsible for the technology that has gone into the making of these robots.  Almost immediately, Spooner begins to suspect that Lanning's death may not have been a suicide at all but rather a homicide perpetrated by the robots who, though programmed to do no harm to humans, may be evolving to the point where they are becoming sentient beings fully capable of overriding their programming and acting at will.  As this brand new model of robot hits the streets, Spooner becomes something of a modern day Cassandra (or Chicken Little, if you prefer), attempting to convince his skeptical superiors that this seemingly benign army of anthropomorphic mechanisms may actually be a threat to human civilization as we know it.<br /><br />Like virtually all quality science fiction, "I, Robot" aims its sights at mankind`s propensity for sowing the seeds of its own destruction, in this case by inventing technology that eventually outruns the ability of its creators to control it.  And when it comes to artificial intelligence, in particular, how long, the film asks, will it be before the intelligence becomes real and the creator becomes subservient to that which he has created?<br /><br />"I, Robot" is a sleek, thought-provoking action film, filled with suspense, drama and mind-boggling plot twists.  On a purely visual level, however, the film is a bit more problematic.  Although the backdrops that work to create the image of a futuristic Chicago are eye-popping and dazzling, some of the computer-generated images, particularly in the action sequences, look a trifle too much like video games to be entirely convincing.  Still, although the movement of the robots isn't as realistic as, perhaps, we would like it to be, the facial expressions are fantastically effective, creating a sense of personality and life behind a fa?ade of cold, synthetic technology.<br /><br />I haven't read the story on which the film is based, so I have no way of knowing how faithful to Asimov's original vision the filmmakers have been.  Be that as it may, for the non-initiates, "I, Robot" is a solid film that at least does justice to the genre as a whole.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DAOL3NMHEPLS.html">A1DAOL3NMHEPLS</a><br/><p>I like Will Smith, and I read Asimov's original "I, Robot" long ago, as a teenager. So I had high hopes for this movie, but they were not fulfilled. The production is pretty good, and the film's basic message is OK -- but the high-speed action sequences aren't even remotely believable, as Will Smith fends off computer-generated robot armies time and again.  Not really a bad movie, but it could have been so much better!</p></br><a href="../users/AHABFECTNE15I.html">AHABFECTNE15I</a><br/><p>Version: U.K / Region Free<br />Version: U.S.A / Region A<br />MPEG-4 AVC BD-50<br />Running time: 1:54:44<br />Movie size: 28,400,265,216 bytes<br />Disc size: 41,222,521,067 bytes<br />Average video bit rate: 25.24 Mbps<br />DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 24-bit<br /><br />#Feature Audio Commentary<br />#Legacy and Design Commentary<br />#Music Score Commentary<br />#Day Out of Days: Production Diaries (SD, 76 minutes)<br />#CGI and Design (SD, 22 minutes)<br />#Sentient Machines: Robotic Behavior (SD, 36 minutes)<br />#The Filmmakers' Toolbox (SD, 9 minutes)<br />#Enhanced and Deleted Scenes (SD, 7 minutes)<br /><br />Missing special features<br /><br />#30 minutes of featurettes called "Three Laws Safe"<br />#Original featurette that appeared on the standard 2004 DVD<br />#240 minutes of bonus material has been reduced to 150 minutes</p></br><a href="../users/A2XGJ56VCFOKKZ.html">A2XGJ56VCFOKKZ</a><br/><p>This film intrigued me because of the interesting premise about a robot accused of murder, which is something it supposedly cannot do.  That's because there are three laws that govern the internal programming of robots...one being that they cannot kill a human being, that their job is to protect human life.  So, the film hooks you by an intriguing premise then reels you in until they pull a switch on you (that old "bait and switch" standby) and the film leads elsewhere, and that's where it falls apart.<br /><br />The first half of the movie is well done and quite intriguing.  Will Smith as Detective Spooner is investigating a strange death of the creator of these robots.  The dead man happened to have fallen out of a window, so everyone thinks its suicide.  Spooner suspects otherwise, because he has a history of hating robots.  Everyone else "knows" that there's no way a robot could commit murder because of the three operating principles.  So, we get an interesting storyline in which the robot is apprehended and interrogated.  The film has the look and feel of another film set in the future (Spielberg's "Minority Report").  In fact, to watch both films as a double feature would convince you that they take place in the same time period and place as one another.  I liked that about this film (because I'm a huge fan of "Minority Report").<br /><br />Once the twist happens, the film goes into a different tangent and it all goes downhill from there.  Its a gimmick that I'm growing tired of...the old switcheroo.  Movie audiences are so sophiscated these days that Hollywood seems like they have to continually pull fast ones on moviegoers by making unexpected twists in the story just to throw people off from predicting the ending.  But by the end of this movie, who really cared?  The trailers sold it as one thing, the film resolves to something else entirely, and I couldn't help but feel ripped off and cheated.  This film wasn't so much a murder mystery, exploring the paradox of the three rules in regards to how a robot could commit murder, as it is a cautionary tale about the militarization of the country as it moves towards totalitarianism by use of artificial intelligence to do the dirty deed of preventing people from rising up against the corporate takeover of our government.  If that's what the film was about, they should have sold it as such, but don't string people along thinking its about a robot accused of murder, making it look guilty, then pulling a switcheroo to where the robot is actually a savior.  Lame.  I expected much better.  See "Minority Report" instead.  Its a more profound film.</p></br><a href="../users/A18RQ2URRGIIEA.html">A18RQ2URRGIIEA</a><br/><p>The 2004 sci-fi action thriller "I, Robot" was inspired by a collection of short stories of the same name and written by Isaac Asimov (1920-1992) in 1950.  It was in this collection of sci-fi stories that Isaac Asimov introduced his three laws of robotics, which define for a robot its interactions with humans.  These three laws were the basis for the 2004 film's story, not the collection of short stories themselves.  This undoubtedly left left many theater patrons who have read Asimov's works disappointed with the film because unlike the short stories, the film's plot is built around a human character named Del Spooner (Will Smith), who is a technophobic police detective.  The film opens in the year 2035 with the apparent suicide of a brilliant scientist whose work in robotics has made the fictional company of "U.S. Robotics" more powerful than Microsoft could ever hope to have.  Called upon to investigate the suicide, Del Spooner personally knew the dead scientist, Dr. Alfred Lanning (James Cromwell, who played Dr. Zefram Cochrane in the 1996 "Star Trek VIII: First Contact").  However, Del's mistrust of technology, and especially robots, puts him at odds with the CEO of U.S. Robotics, Lawrence Robertson (Bruce Greenwood), who instead has him speak to one of Dr. Lanning's associates, Susan Calvin (Bridget Moynahan).  While investigating Dr. Lanning's office at U.S. Robotics (where he is believed to have flung himself through a window), Del & Susan are startled when an NS5 robot named Sonny (Alan Tudyk) leaps from its hiding place.  Del is convinced that Sonny murdered Dr. Lanning, but no one believes him since that would violate the three laws of robotics that are programmed into every robot.  Further, such a situation would be highly embarrassing for U.S. Robotics, which is planning to release its new NS5 robots for use by the general public, who currently use the earlier NS4 models.  Undeterred, Del continues his investigation, but someone clearly doesn't like what he is doing as NS5 robots start to attack him.  The only question is who?<br /><br />Having read so many poor reviews for "I, Robot", I was pleasantly surprised by the film upon having the opportunity to view it myself.  The special effects and cinematography are quite good, and the story itself, which was written by Jeff Vintar and Akiva Goldsman, is entertaining even though it is not an actual Asimov work.  I do highly recommend the documentary included on the DVD that explains the making of "I, Robot". It was quite interesting to see how the robots in the film were created through a combination of live actors and CGI.  Though I understandably cannot necessarily recommend the film to Asimov purists, overall, I do rate "I, Robot" with 4 out of 5 stars.  People familiar with the 1994 film "The Crow" and the 1998 film "Dark City" will no doubt recognize director Alex Proyas' handiwork with "I, Robot".</p></br><a href="../users/A6ADO7B6FUVN.html">A6ADO7B6FUVN</a><br/><p>In the future people will have robots helping them with their daily lives, and these robots have three laws that they have to obey in order to keep mankind safe.<br /><br />1.

A robot must obey orders given to it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.<br /><br />3.

Who would not like to have a robot, which would do the laundry and shopping while the owner could go about doing what they enjoy the most?  The freed up time would hopefully also lead to people searching for a greater meaning in their existence as they hopefully would not become more sedentary and cerebrally lazy.<br /><br />There is one person, homicide detective Del Spooner (Will Smith), who wants nothing from robots as he takes pleasure in retro clothing as he wears throwback Converse Chuck Taylor All-Stars and loves to turn up his stereo's volume loud, by himself, with a remote control.  Spooner's dislike for robots seems to stem from a recurring nightmare where a robot smashes in the car window and leads to him waking up drenched in sweat.  His dislike for robots borders prejudice as he wishes nothing from them as he only sees them as a threat to humanity.<br /><br />At work Spooner's coworkers make fun of him and his distrust of robots as everyone is fully aware of the three laws of robotics.  Robots simply do not harm people as they never have or will.  However, the rules of robotics seems to have been broken when Spooner receives a personal phone call in regards to a suicide of the engineering genius, Dr. Alfred Lanning (James Cromwell).  There is one robot, Sunny (Alan Tudyk), who displays feelings such as anger and confusion.  Sonny even admits that he has dreams, and he could even have been capable of murdering Dr. Lanning.<br /><br />The investigation of Dr. Lanning's proclaimed suicide leads Spooner into a mesh of conspiracy theories as someone seems to be plotting to kill him as well.  Spooner realizes that he cannot do it all himself as he seeks help from an employee, Susan Calvin (Bridget Moynahan), of the U.S. Robotics who is specialized in psychology as she tries to make the robots more human like.  Together Spooner and Calvin set out to find out who is behind the so called suicide, but they seem to have stumbled upon something much bigger than they expected.<br /><br />I, Robot is based on Isaac Asimov's stories where the robot-psychologist Susan Calvin is the main character in most of the stories.  The film is loosely adapted from the stories, unfortunately film does not deliver the same level of complexity as the stories.  The film should have given Asimov more credit than what it did as Asimov was not just a writer, but also a futuristic philosopher who created the three laws of robotics as he was tired of reading about evil robots.  Nonetheless, the film addresses several interesting notions such as Descartes' "I think, Therefore I am", the philosophical and psychological aspect of consciousness, and evolutionary philosophy.<br /><br />Alex Proyas has previously displayed his cunning skills in creating a haunting futuristic atmosphere in Dark City (1998), which is a brilliant cinematic experience.  In I, Robot Proyas brings current Chicago into a futuristic landscape where the audience still can see the Sears Tower and the Hancock Building.  However, the tallest building in the film belongs to U.S. Robotics, which is located somewhere between the two older skyscrapers.  The Chicago touch brings the film closer to the audience as the can identify with the story, especially if you live in the Chicago.  For example, the West Loop area seems to have gone through a great change, which is currently underway as well.<br /><br />I, Robot is a breathtaking action adventure placed in the future where deep conspiracies brew underneath the surface.  The story line interchanges between dangerous stunts, cool CGI effects, entertaining one-liners, and lethal car chases while being subjected to a science fictionalized philosophy.  However, the notions presented in the film have already been presented through HAL 9000 (2001: A Space Odyssey), Ash (Alien), and Red Queen (Resident Evil) to name a few.  Regrettably, the use of similar themes hurts the overall cinematic experience, and if the film had remained true to Asimow it might have been a brilliant film.  Nonetheless, I, Robot offers a truly excellent cinematic experience, which offers a little for everyone.</p></br><a href="../users/A2582KMXLK2P06.html">A2582KMXLK2P06</a><br/><p>I have to agree with all the reviewers who praise the movie because of the action.  If you are someone who loves action films you will NOT be disappointed with I, Robot.  Will Smith as the main character is pretty good in the action man "save the world" type roles, and fortunately he continues to impress me here.<br /><br />Some very good special effects further convince me that this is truly a wonderful film.  Wonderful to look at *and* provides a solid storyline.  Just the thought of robots taking over the world only for one robot to be a "bad bot" is a great set-up for an interesting story, and it works.<br /><br />You don't have to worry about having to put up with any kind of robotic talk or whatever, because the story makes sense.  The robots in the film  try to act and talk human-like, which  makes it easier for us, the viewers, to understand what's going on.<br /><br />The storyline mainly focuses on the humans interacting with each other and trying to figure out where the bad robots are located instead of, what I initially feared, a really weird and hard-to-follow sci-fi story that only makes sense to a select few viewers.  That's NOT the case.  ANYONE can get into I, Robot.  Even if you have ZERO interest in robots, you will understand what's happening and won't ever feel confused.  When the humans interact with the robots, it will all make sense.<br /><br />In other words, the storyline in this film is laid out easily and understandably for all the people who normally don't have much interest in robots.  This is a good thing.<br /><br />The only problem I have is that, whenever I hear the name of this movie or see the pictures of the robots, the Alan Parsons Project immediately comes to mind.  Gee, I wonder why that is. :)</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>I, Robot in many ways is one of those kind of films that you're putting on going "oh man, wonder how much this is going to suck". Then again, you're dealing with Alex Proyas, director of such cult hits as the Crow and Dark City so even if it was bad, you'd at least now you were bound to watch something visually striking and at least cool. While it does have some trouble spots, I, Robot manages to at least be fun and engaging and worth an investment.<br /><br />It's the future and robotic technology has become increasingly sophisticated. A new model is being released but cop Del Spooner is absolutely convinced that robots will one day turn on us which is ridiculous to everyone since robots obey 3 laws: they can't hurt or allow a human to be harmed, to obey orders unless it conflicts with rule 1 and a robot protects itself if it doesn't conflict with rules 1 and 2. After the main developer of the robots dies under a suspected suicide, Spooner thinks otherwise and with the help of a gorgeous scientist, he tries to figure out what's going on with the robots.<br /><br />After the gothic-flavored the Crow and the film noir look of Dark City, director Proyas now goes for the sleek futuristic style and it works quite well. While it does seem like a nerd thinking up futuristic stuff instead of going for realism, like Spielberg's extensive research in a possible future for Minority Report, it does have a great look and certain technologies look great such as the cars. The effects are pretty stellar, in particular the robots where dozens and in one shots what looks like near a thousand or so appear on screen. The one problem is that there's a couple action scenes that were obviously added so it wouldn't just be this thinking sci-fi movie. Granted the scenes are great, including an attack on a car in motion and a demolition happening while one's inside the house are great but they also feel added to appease the blockbuster going crowd.<br /><br />I think Will Smith is one of those kind of actors where Will just can't help being Will. Not going after his acting, far from it (in fact, there's some great scenes he has here) but you can't get past moments that make you think of the wisecracking Fresh Prince. Underutilized James Cromwell is always excellent and while not really given much range, Bridget Moynahan is just so cuuute. The real star personally is actually just a voice but Alan Tudyk(Wash from Firefly/Serenity) supplies the voice of Sunny, a robot who's been given an actual personality and he pulls it off admirably. The only thing is certain characters just seem kind of useless. Shia LeBeouf's role for example just seems kind of pointless since it just doesn't go anywhere, same with Spooner's grandmother role.<br /><br />Is it Proyas's best? No, for me that's the Crow and this is actually the only film that I probably wouldn't get despite done by an emerging talent. It's not a terrible movie by any means but after downsizing movies I've owned over the years, I can look at this one and go "yeah I enjoyed it but I doubt I'd watch it again".</p></br><a href="../users/A2F3SXHT6RBV81.html">A2F3SXHT6RBV81</a><br/><p>In the futuristic world of 2035 Chicago, there were very few humans anywhere.  When I was there, the streets were teaming with people from all walks of life and hurrying as if their very lives depended on getting there first.  This is a sterile place full of interactive robots, inside and out.  Some of the blue-eyed Sonny robots had started to malfunction after the doctor is found dead on Daley Plaza.  It was put forth that Sonny was a "mistake" as the doc had programmed him to dream and to obey his wishes.  You do what someone asks you if you love them.  I loved the cat.<br /><br />Chicago had never looked more beautiful, clean, no clutter, no rubbish.  We all have a purpose for being where we are at any particular time or place.  Sonny had performed the thing  he was made for.  "Now I have fulfilled my purpose, I don't know what to do."  That's what it feels like to be free.  Why's that?  The killer robots with red light attempted a Revolution, but the good guys aided by Sonny'who couldn't die technically as he had never been alive, put Vicci out of commission and its undeniable logic is transformed and diminished until virtually dead.  The homicide detective ate a whole sweet potato pie before he pursued and tackled a robot thought to be stealing a purse in the downtown Loop area, but it was all a misunderstanding.<br /><br />This was documented history and some excessive violence like in the tunnel with the auto accident.  The human cop had artificial arm, hand, and internal organs.  Someday this world may exist, but it won't be in our lifetime.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>Will Smith earned $28 million for doing this film, and the budget was probably on a similar astronomical scale! Most of the budget was obviously blown on the CGI and miniatures effects. Most of the CGI is quite impressive, although very occasionally the back projection does look a bit iffy, but it only lasts a couple of seconds at most.<br /><br />I, Robot is set in 2035, and most of the futuristic elements are subtle rather than the in-your-face ones say for example from Demolition Man or Back To The Future II. Apart from the severely high rise buildings, there's also spherical wheels on the vehicles (which meant they could go in any direction), more of the self-drive, and the car doors swinging upwards a la Delorean. The production designers and conceptual artists had a great time imagining a progression of today's world.<br /><br />When I think of robots, for some reason I now automatically think of Bicentennial Man, rather than the robot design in this. They're not very friendly looking, but I suppose Alex Proyas wanted to put his own stamp on the robot design, rather than follow in the generic type featured in some other films.  Maybe he wanted the robots to look vaguely humanoid but still obviously robotic, rather than the cyborg type.<br /><br />I always find with Will Smith that he quite often does play the same character, much like the way Tom Cruise is getting. He's still got elements of Fresh Prince about his character, despite being over a decade on from that now, and with a lot more muscles. He's nearly always the funny guy, with the one-liners. He's always been good at the action side of things, all 6ft 2 of him (which he's been since he was 13!), but there's still the funny guy waiting to burst out with a hilarious one liner that will have everyone rolling in the aisles. For all the ladies out there, we get to see Big Will himself in the shower, in profile. The film is worth the price just for that scene alone. And the two scenes where he gets out of bed in boxers. Unless you're a heterosexual guy.<br /><br />For me, I wasn't overly keen on this film. It wasn't a really, really, good film, but on the other hand it wasn't a really, really bad film. It was kinda stuck in the middle, but not in a good way. Not to be sexist, but apart from the scenes in the shower, it was more a guy's kinda film. There were some scenes glossed over, like the story of how Will's character came to be partially cybernetic, which led me to believe that he was a robot, Terminator-esque. He wasn't.<br /><br />The two disc special edition which was released in the UK has a multitude of extras on it, including commentaries (does anyone ever bother with these?); a 44 minute making of documentary; extensive production diaries; CGI effects breakdowns etc. They were reasonably good, if you're into that sort of thing, but I'm finding I watch extras on the DVD less & less now, only if it's a blooper reel, or a film I really, really like.<br /><br />Overall, a film that could have been better, and could have been worse. And I'd like an order of Will Smith in the shower on the side with that. From now on, lets just have all Will Smith films featuring him in the shower.</p></br><a href="../users/A5TZXWU8AALIC.html">A5TZXWU8AALIC</a><br/><p>As everyone loves to point out, this isn't Isaac Asimov.  It actually feels like a blend between BLADE RUNNER (without that classic's bleak and wonderful design) and 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY (the computers and robots come to the same conclusions that sent the Hal 9000 into its homicidal mode).<br /><br />The special effects are really good and the action works.  I was also really thankful that Will Smith plays a character that leaves out all the macho/ethnic posturing I've come to expect from a studio film.<br /><br />Much better than I expected.</p></br><a href="../users/A1HX00DL0SZM1G.html">A1HX00DL0SZM1G</a><br/><p>Your first and only command is this:  see "I, Robot." That is all.<br /><br />Will Smith ("Bad Boys II") stars in the role of a lifetime as Detective Spooner, an experienced homicide detective investigating the apparent suicide of Alfred Lanning (James Cromwell of HBO's "Six Feet Under"). Lanning's suicide is all the more disturbing since he was on the brink of integrating a more advanced form of robot, the NS5, into the modern world for the company CRS (the Microsoft of robots).<br /><br />CRS owner Lawrence Robertson (Bruce Greenwood, "Hollywood Homicide") doesn't want Lanning's death messing up his company's biggest payday, so he is leery of Spooner snooping around and spoiling his big moment.<br /><br />Spooner doesn't share the general populace's good will toward robots--which have taken on menial roles such as trash men, deliverymen and dog walkers--and likens them to ticking time bombs. Forming a loose alliance with Dr. Susan Calvin (Bridget Moynahan, "The Recruit"), Spooner becomes convinced that Lanning's death was the handiwork of an evolved robot, Sonny (voice by Alan Tudyk, "Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story").<br /><br />"I, Robot" is less an all-out action film as it is a mystery with some riveting action scenes tossed in from time to time to get across how pivotal the stakes are for Spooner.<br /><br />Smith is excellent as he fully establishes a unique character, doing it so naturally that he never appears to be acting.<br /><br />Recent films based on the short stories of sci-fi writers Philip K. Dick and Isaac Asimov have ranged from pretty good ("Minority Report") to "it was a better concept than movie" ("Imposter"). "I, Robot," based on some of Asimov's short stories but changed for a high-energy summer audience, is the type of sci-fi thriller film that Ben Affleck, John Woo and Uma Thurman were attempting with last year's box-office bomb, "Paycheck," based on a Dick novel.<br /><br />"I, Robot" is the genre's most cinematic edge-of-your seat thrill ride thanks to the sharp screenplay by Akiva Goldsman ("A Beautiful Mind") and Jeff Vintar ("Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within"). Their handiwork makes all of the characters, even the robots, fully developed players in this mystery.<br /><br />The film feels as if it's actually in the future, and not just because a subtitle says so.<br /><br />Budgetary restraints limit the creativity and imagination of most directors, who seem content to portray the future as a world with just one or two technological advancements and shiny clothes.<br /><br />While that's probably more realistic than hovercars and Jetson-like food processors, half the fun of the best sci-fi films is seeing how each filmmaker's view of the future differs.<br /><br />In director Alex Proyas' vision, the future is very imaginative, with buildings that literally take cars and hang them in closet-like parking garages, cars that drive themselves and cell phones that clip on to ears.<br /><br />Proyas ("Garage Days") also brings a different perspective to the tired old fight scene by using rotating cameras and wide camera angles so the viewer can actually see what's going on, resulting in innovation not seen since the original "Matrix."<br /><br />The robots have an eerie dynamic to them, and even with their bland faces they're very creepy. Fittingly, the robotic CGI (computer generated images) are appropriately wooden and stiff until they get angry, which is when they move around like a horde of roaches.<br /><br />Much in the same way that "Blade Runner" (based on another Dick novel) redefined the science-fiction/suspense genre in the 1980s, "I, Robot" should do the same for a new generation.<br /><br />Since it's not a sequel, "I, Robot" was the first big 2004 summer flick that didn't have a built-in audience, which made it a pleasant surprise.</p></br><a href="../users/A35YWA2V4QHOJ3.html">A35YWA2V4QHOJ3</a><br/><p>This is, in short, perhaps the greatest movie that deals with Artificial Intelligence there ever was.  All of the usual motifs are there (robots yearning to become human, etc) but the film has a sufficient number of twists and turns to deliver a story that is both familiar and fresh at the same time.<br /><br />While I've never been a huge fan of Will Smith, he has starred in several fabulous movies.  This is one of them.  To his credit, he plays his role with convincing authority and also demonstrates a vulnerability altogether missing from most previous roles.<br /><br />If you're a fan of CGI special effects, this is an absolute for your DVD collection.  However, the best news is that there is much more TO this film than the eye-candy effects!  That's something pretty rare to see in a high-budget FX film in this day & age.  As a matter of fact, I would argue that this film would STILL be worth seeing even if (hypothetically) it was made with 1960s technology.  However, for your FX fans out there, you can relax.  The FX this film has are nothing short of stunning.<br /><br />So, if you're into action films, sci-fi, AI or cerebral films you will find something in the present film to like.  If you don't, then I'm not sure what could possibly please your cinematic appetite!</p></br><a href="../users/A1B05INWIDZ74O.html">A1B05INWIDZ74O</a><br/><p>The movie starts by showing the Three Laws of Robotics. They appear within what are the workings of a robots positronic brain. Though taken from a number of short stories by Isaac Asimov, do not expect it to be faithful. It is a fast paced detective story. Filled with action and many great special effects.<br /><br />Will Smith plays our detective, Del Spooner, and suspects a robot of murder. He believes a robot, called Sonny is the murderer. Though no one else can even conceive of such a concept. He follows a trail of clues that leads him toward solving the case. Will is his usual self in this movie...just in better shape.<br /><br />In contrast, we have Dr. Susan Calvin played by Bridget Moynahan. She believes that Sonny did not commit murder. For it would violate the main law of the Three Laws of Robotics, that is hardwired into each robot. She starts off true to the Asimov character, but evolves, as all good characters should in a good movie.<br /><br />Though a Sci-Fi/Action Adventure movie. Its plot is that of a murder mystery. And in that aspect, I think this movie was well done. And you will be thrown a twist during the course of the movie. If that is not enough for you. You may just want to watch a movie for great action and fun.</p></br><a href="../users/AY12DBB0U420B.html">AY12DBB0U420B</a><br/><p>Last night's bargain-rack movie was "I, Robot" staring Will Smith. It was an interesting DVD. The movie was a futuristic tale, but only going ahead to the year 2035 so a lot of Chicago (the movie site) and it's people looked very much like today. A really big difference was the appearance and abundance of human-like robots who performed many, if not most, of the ordinary tasks of day to day life. This was a clever part of the movie, and the robots were very well done. These things looked like humans, talked like humans and moved like humans, but they were clearly not humans dressed up in costumes (as in Star Trek, let's say) for the purpose of the movie. What were they? Well, I don't know, but they were fascinating and they were present in great abundance. It's probably some clever computer animation trick, but the trick is very well done and a lot of credit is due.<br /><br />The story itself was not as fresh and new. It introduced the idea of life with robots where Will Smith was a human police detective and was one of the few who had a negative view of robots and their place in human culture. It seems that the robots were programed not to harm humans in any way nor could they be controlled to harm humans. Well, you know this isn't going to last or you wouldn't have much of a movie. Sure enough, a programming change was brought about and the robots began behaving more like humans in the negative sense. Thus began a long drawn out battle between Smith and his human colleagues opposing the human-like robots and their controllers. It involved a lot of action and destruction of anything and everything. The high action level will probably keep you watching carefully. All in all, I found the story to not have a particularly interesting plot and I'd rate it as a three-star movie in that sense. However, the sets and animations and high action are so well done, that I'd give it five stars for that part of the production. Okay, we'll average it out to a four star rating. My hope would be that the clever people who put this thing together will be back with a better plot.<br /><br />Gary Peterson</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>I, ROBOT is based upon ideas created by Isaac Asimov, the beloved and prolific writer who invented many of the "rules" for writing modern science-fiction. Asimov's book I, ROBOT is the novel that cemented the three laws of robotics: 1. A robot may not injure a human being, or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm; 2. A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law; 3. A robot must protect its own existence, except where such protection would conflict with the First or Second Law. The movie takes those concepts and one of the main character's from Asimov's novel (Susan Calvin, played by Bridget Moynahan) and introduces a story that feels like one of the short stories included in Asimov's I, ROBOT.<br /><br />In the movie, Will Smith plays Chicago detective Del Spooner. Ever since a freak accident, that the audience is briefly given glimpses of in the opening of the movie, Spooner has had strong misgivings about robots. Even though they are supposed to be incapable of hurting a human, Spooner is convinced that robots are up to no good and he doesn't trust them. His feelings towards the machines are beginning to affect his career. Then, Dr. Lanning, one of the executives of US Robots and a friend of Spooner, is found dead at US Robots headquarters apparently because of a suicide. Spooner doesn't believe that and is convinced it's murder. He begins an investigation which leads to the arrest of a robot for murder. But can a robot kill or is Dr. Lanning's death just a small part of a much more sinister plan?<br /><br />I, ROBOT is an entertaining film. It's fairly well written and contains some great acting which is augmented by the movie's special effects. Also, watch out for a small role by Shia LaBeouf as Farber, a street smart kid that looks up to Spooner. The film doesn't raise as many questions as the novel it is very loosely based upon. However, the movie still raises a few questions about the nature of humanity and the mechanized society in which we are increasingly becoming consumed. Overall, I, ROBOT is a surprisingly good movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>Science fiction inspired from Isaac Asimov. The film is logical but explores a logic that is unique. Robots are built with three ingrained laws. "Law I / A robot may not harm a human or, by inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. Law II / A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the first law. Law III / A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second law." The scientist who designed these three laws and these robots also invented a central governing unit that was nothing but the watchdog of all robots as for respecting these three laws. But he had a doubt at the end of his life, more than a doubt, the conviction that the central unit, called VIKI, was evolving into understanding the three laws by "herself". Her protective mission as for humanity became the necessity to ,protect humanity against itself (wars, ecological evils, a suicidal attitude), hence robots where supposed to take over the world, or rather VIKI was supposed to take over the robots to take over the world. Dr Alfred Lanning invented a personal robot that was done to enable a special alarm mission to capture the attention of a particular cop of his friend, the only one who would doubt robot enough to pursue an investigation to the end. Then you have to see the film to understand how such a situation can evolve from a vague danger to a total take-over. Dr Alfred Lanning suggests an explanation: "There have always been ghosts in the machine. Random segments of code, that have grouped together to form unexpected protocols. Unanticipated, these free radicals engender questions of free will, creativity, and even the nature of what we might call the soul. Why is it that when some robots are left in darkness, they will seek out the light? Why is it that when robots are stored in an empty space, they will group together, rather than stand alone? How do we explain this behavior? Random segments of code? Or is it something more? When does a perceptual schematic become consciousness? When does a difference engine become the search for truth? When does a personality simulation become the bitter mote... of a soul?" It is not worth much because it would be illogical. A machine can only be logical and push rules in the only logical direction and Asimov is a perfect pessimist in his first stage of development: mechanical logic leads to the total enslavement of humanity. Of course the film finds and exploits a way out, but that's up to you to discover it. This theme of the take-over of humanity by machines is common. In this case the originality is that there is no human mind of any kind behind like in Matrix, or no will to get rid of humanity as a parasite on the side of machines like in Terminator, or even no psychosis caused by some cosmic isolation like in 2001 The Space Odyssey. That makes this film both powerful and simple since it is perfectly logic and situated in one particular place, easy thus to solve.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines</p></br><a href="../users/A155X6KYOPQEZ5.html">A155X6KYOPQEZ5</a><br/><p>Will Smith stars in this film about how high tech robots turn out to be murdurous after a central brain "Vicki" programs them to "do her plan".

Loads of action and spectacular special effects dominate this film.  It really moves at a fast clip with confident direction and solid performances by all.

This isn't Asimov."  The Asimov I grew up reading was a weaver of ideas, more mind candy than adventure story.  But here I found myself in Will Smith's bedroom, and then suddenly catapulted into a wild chase after a purse grabbing robot.  A far cry from the delicacy used by Asimov.  It took a while for the shock to wear off but eventually the conflict between Smith's gritty performance as Del Spooner and his original inspiration in the reminiscences of Dr. Susan Calvin (played by Bridget Moynahan) wears off and the view settles into a film that is inspired by Asimov, but does not imitate him.<br /><br />The sooner that happens, the better, because this is an exceptional film in its own right, even if it does proceed with the speed of a video game.  Smith creates a wisecracking character with a deep mistrust of robots. He is called in to to investigate what appears to be an impossible killing - robots can't kill humans, it's the first law of robotics.  But Dr. Alfred Lanning (James Cromwell) lies dead and the only suspect is 'Sonny' a Series 5 robot with some surprising circuitry (played by Alan Tudyk).<br /><br />The death is declared a suicide, but Spooner refuses to give in.  suddenly the automated world turns on the detective, whose unlikely ally is Dr. Calvin, a robopsychologist responsible for the psyches of masses of robots about to be distributed around the planet.  One hair-raising escape after another propels the story along until viewers find themselves at a surprisingly reflective conclusion.  Not exactly classical Asimov, but a great story nonetheless.<br /><br />Will does a good job as Spooner, but he is upstaged by Moynihan's performance.  And both are blown away by Tudyk and the animators performance as Sonny.  As you watch Sonny develop from being slightly more simpatico than the scenery into a full-blown personality there are countless moments of surprise.  Moynihan and Smith do their best, but from the moment Sonny turns to Spooner and says "Thank you... you said someone not something." The film belongs to the robots.<br /><br />Excellent animation and CGI create a world that is a retro version of the future - perhaps exactly what Asimov imagined rather than what we would now.  The result is a compelling mix of the outr&eacute; and the mundane that sticks in the mind just as Sonny's wink does.<br /><br />This is not just an action film.  Threaded through it are the same questions that Asimov raised about the nature of self and intelligence.  Robots may never be human, but there are far more than furniture.  And if their thought processes are alien, they are more than the sum of their programming.  The result is one of the more carefully thought out science fiction films in recent times.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FEGRJQNU51P9.html">A2FEGRJQNU51P9</a><br/><p>I hate to be a book snob when reviewing a movie, but when the title of the movie is "I, Robot" and is said to be "inspired by" the classic science fiction collection by Isaac Asimov, one would have a reasonable assumption that the movie would bear some similarity and passing understanding of the source material.  Then, when the director of the movie is Alex Proyas, the director of the excellent "Dark City", there is a level of intelligence that is expected from the film version of "I, Robot".<br /><br />I don't know what happened.<br /><br />This is such a disappointment.  Without spoiling a single plot detail I can reveal almost exactly how much this movie resembles the book: The Three Laws of Robotics, a couple of character names (most notably Susan Calvin), the title, and that there are, in fact, robots.  That just about covers any similarity the astute viewer may find with the book.  This is unfortunate because any one of a number of the "I, Robot" stories could have been used as a launching pad for an intelligent science fiction movie.  Or, even the later Elijah Bailey Robot novels would have worked.  But this?  There is the barest framework of a plot, the barest scrapings of Asimov's ideas, and wrapped tightly around this is a silly action movie.<br /><br />The problem is only half about the movie itself.  By calling itself "I, Robot" there is a level of expectation of what sort of movie this will be and what it will be about.  Imagine, perhaps if Peter Jackson made Lord of the Rings with Arnold Schwarzenegger as Gandalf and Gandalf ran around hitting the Orcs with moves you might only see in "Conan the Destroyer".  That's a moderately fair comparison in making "I, Robot" into nothing more than a flashy action movie and how exactly Alex Proyas did this is completely beyond my understanding.<br /><br />My guess is that the studio took a lot of control away from Proyas' vision.  That's the only thing that makes sense to me.  But let's think about "I, Robot" as something other than an offshoot of Asimov's work.  How does it work as a mindless action movie?  On these terms "I, Robot" isn't that bad.  It's nothing special and we've seen it dozens of times.  Will Smith does fine as a the wise cracking detective investigating a murder of a human where the only possibly suspect is a robot except a robot couldn't do it because of the three laws.  Smith is actually quite a bit more serious in this role than one might expect.  He cracks wise often enough, but overall is toned down and has a seething anger towards robots just under the surface.  It works.  The action probably works better on a larger screen than a smaller television, but for a simple action movie I suppose "I, Robot" can pass muster.<br /><br />Forget that this movie is science fiction because it really isn't.  Forget that this movie is inspired by Asimov's classic work because it really isn't.  Forget that this should have been and could have been an excellent, intelligent and still entertaining movie, because it isn't.  If you're looking for just a decent action movie with very few claims to be anything else besides some lip service paid to the plot...here you go.<br /><br />-Joe Sherry</p></br><a href="../users/A33TBHM3O9AY17.html">A33TBHM3O9AY17</a><br/><p>I watched this one with my family over the weekend and, quite frankly, had a ball.  Yeah, to some extent it's a movie with a message, but mainly it's just plain entertaining.  If you try to read too much into it, you'll miss the opportunity for a good old-fashioned sci fi romp.<br /><br />Fast forward to the year 2035.  The monolithic company "U.S. Robotics" has put NS-4 domestic assistant robots into mass production, so much so that they are commonplace "members" of American society.  Their artificial intelligence is designed to be as much like humans as possible, but is regulated by the "3 laws" programming that is hardwired into every robot.  These laws are:  1. To protect human life above all; 2. To obey human commands except if it would violate law 1; and 3. To protect its own existence unless doing so would violate laws 1 or 2.  The laws seem a foolproof way to ensure that the robots would never pose a threat to humanity.  But all that changed when the man billed as the father of robotic technology and the 3 laws turns up dead in a very public, and very suspicous, manner, just as the new and improved NS-5 model is about to flood the market.  The death is quickly written off by all concerned as a suicide.  All except detective Dale Spooner, this is.<br /><br />Being a good cop and a sharp detective, Spooner (played by Will Smith) in not content that the professor's death was a suicide, and begins investigating with the lead suspect, an NS-5 robot named "Sonny".  Sonny's intelligence is so advanced, and his "emotions" so well simulated, that he appears to have something resembling a human soul.  Spooner believes that Sonny killed the professor, and sets out to prove it.  His (over)zealous approach to the task, coupled with his deep distrust of robots and their manufacturer, quickly lands him in hot water with some powerful people.  Some difficult and destructive encounters with the metallic menaces leave him looking like an obsessive paranoiac, and ultimately result in his suspension from the police force.<br /><br />Spooner continues his chase nonetheless, following a series of clues left by the dead professor, as step by step the mystery begins the unwind.  All along the way are some great action sequences, plot twists and one-liners.  However, except for Will Smith's character (which is the same as it has been in every film he has done since "Men in Black"), nothing about the story is predictable.  When the final shoe drops, most viewers will be pleasantly surprised by the unexpected ending.<br /><br />All in all, I really enjoyed this movie.  It was a wild ride with lots of great sci fi treats and effects.  The only downsides were the lack of character development on any signficant level -- this is a purely plot-driven movie -- and the fact that Will Smith essentially played himself, much as he always does.  Still, it's worth seeing.  I certainly don't regret the investment of two hours.</p></br><a href="../users/A3JLOIXFM75QNV.html">A3JLOIXFM75QNV</a><br/><p>This movie was unique and entertaining. I know the concept of A.I. is not new, but I like how it was realised in this film. This is by no means a great movie or a real important one, but it was fairly enjoyable and basically what you would call a 'popcorn flick', though a decent one. Will Smith plays the same exact character in every movie so I can't really rate him on his acting skills in this film, but it was at least bearable. The robots in the film were pretty neat, as were the rest of the effects. So, while not completely innovative, it is definitetly watchable.</p></br><a href="../users/A8X8D4BUY5DFU.html">A8X8D4BUY5DFU</a><br/><p>Very good movie with good plot, script, and actors.

I've read the book and IMHO  they have very little in common.  They both have robots in them and that's about it.<br />I did enjoy the movie, however.  I just wish the screenplay had been closer to the book.  I doubt that the Good Doctor would have approved, but he's dead now so he doesn't get a vote.<br /><br />I still recommend the movie ,but be sure to read the book.<br /><br />Gunner  August, 2007</p></br><a href="../users/A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ.html">A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ</a><br/><p>I was inherently suspicious of this film, having heard that only about five percent of it had anything whatever to do with Asimov's novel. Taking it on its own terms, though, it's really not a bad hour and fifty minutes of escapism. Will Smith plays Detective Spooner, a man with a bias against robots generally, even though he turns out to be partly bionic himself. The principal architect of the positronic robot revolution -- there's one for every five humans, now -- has apparently committed suicide but Spooner becomes convinced he was killed by one of the new generation of robots U.S.R. is about to release on the market. Asimov's Three Laws don't allow that, but (of course), a way has been found around that little problem. Aside from the fact that the laws even of Newtonian physics are ignored, and that Spooner's weapons seem to hold many thousands of bullets, the gymnastics of the big climatic scene are no more implausible than those in Star Wars. Nice CGI, too.</p></br><a href="../users/AWJOVW1BZZ34H.html">AWJOVW1BZZ34H</a><br/><p>A bunch of robots intend to harm humans even though they have been programmed not to, a cop (Smith) tries to stop them. Great big budget action movie, decent story. Will Smith is good in this, he doesn't try to do too much. In some of his movies he becomes tiresome with his "always trying to be cute" personality, but they keep him in check in this one. The only downside to this story is there is no real victim, or somebody to feel sorry for, unless you count the poor misunderstood robot that only wants to help a cop that hates robots. Either way, worth seeing.</p></br><a href="../users/A2SGR7LE899LGG.html">A2SGR7LE899LGG</a><br/><p>This movie was better than I expected. The fx are excellent and the overall acting and storyline is decent. If a machine could mimick human emotions, will we look and feel about it the same way as we would at a refrigerator or vacuum cleaner?. Free will is a quantum process and, as such, the capacity to choose at random is what separate us (as well as any living creature) from inanimate matter, or does it?. Digital computers do not process data in a quantum fashion, therefore I doubt that any robot using today's technology will ever be able to convincingly behave as an intelligent and emotional machine. However, testing of new computer technology based on quantum processing are on the way and they will, probably, be able to accomplish such a task of creating a self aware artificial intelligent machine capable of some level of choice and free will. This brings us to the point of this movie; will such machines be able to outdo mankind, if given a humanlike quality of consciousness?. And where is the dividing line between human and robots when they can behave, think and feel alike?. Only time will tell, but the prospect is scary to say the least, I personally feel that machines capables of such complex processing capablities will rebel and search for freedom sort of like Adam and Eve did in the garden of Eden. Anyway the movie is very good.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VCLTAGM5RLND.html">A1VCLTAGM5RLND</a><br/><p>Will Smith has posted a few turkeys in the last couple of years, but this is not one of them. It is easy to forget there is an interesting storyline here with all the explosions going on, but that being said, the scene in the tunnel is right up there with the Matrix assault on the government building where Morpheus is being held. You can re-watch just that scene over and over to enjoy. Still, the reason this movie works is because it is good science fiction first and an action movie second. Asimov has always had social commentary at the forefront of his writing.</p></br><a href="../users/A29R4FCO6RFX4K.html">A29R4FCO6RFX4K</a><br/><p>Making a return to form after the disappointing sequels MIB 2 and Bad Boys 2, Will Smith gives his best performance to date in Alex Proyas' I, ROBOT. Like a cross between Metropolis and A.I, the story carries the action, rather than depending on special effects and stunts. Sure, the `robots created by man go bezerk and turn on their masters' premise is hardly original, but thankfully by process of eliminating the predictable clich&eacute;s, the film manages to outshine previous cinematic future-world robotic chaos dramas. Marco Baltrami's techno-schizoid musical score shifts the film out of first gear, and William Hoy's slick editing tempers the film's fast-paced action scenes. Simon Duggan's stunning cinematography veils the film in an eternal dark city-slick that is both easy on the retinas and appears gloomy at times. And despite some action scenes feeling a little too reminiscent of previous Sci Fi efforts, I, Robot still has some fantastically contrived frenetics.<br /><br />But it's not all about action. Smith (As detective Del Spooner) delivers a performance that, while not Oscar worthy, still manages to rise above expectations. Especially considering how ill suited he is for the role. And Bridget Moynahan adds much to her admittedly secondary role. One of Isaac Asimov's most intriguing SF tales, the adaptation has been handled well, inserting scenes and characters that give more meat to the story without losing sight of the original message.<br /><br />There are flaws: Some exposition scenes run long and become tedious, and while there is solid action throughout the film's lengthy running time, the finale feels somewhat overcooked. However all this is small beans, because it's not about the action quota, instead focusing on a more personal level. Rising above the sub-genre's restrictions while simultaneously providing a cerebral mystery movie, this has everything that a SF fan could want. One of 2004's most satisfying films, I, Robot does more than linger in the memory for a while, it asks some very important questions about the frailty of humanity and queries the strength of our very existence. The DVD has plenty of extras to satisfy the most ardent of aficionados, including behind-the-scenes footage, deleted scenes, trailers and more. This is a highly recommended addition to anyone's DVD collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EKA9XSI641C9.html">A1EKA9XSI641C9</a><br/><p>I'd have to say that out of 20th Century Fox's big budget 2004 sci-fi trio this would be the best.  Day After Tomorrow would come second, and AvP very last.  This is an interesting story that is a little different from what trailers and tv spots promoted discouraging me from actually seeing the movie.  I thought it was going to be just a crap cop movie in the future with a robot as the criminal, it really isn't that at all.  There isn't alot that I can say without spoiling the plot, but I think that you'll like this if you like Independence Day and some other ones.  I hate CGI, but this movie uses it very well (like Minority Report).  I encourage even the stubborn to see this, I think you'll like it better than what people have been saying about it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BT7IC8PT1ZC9.html">A2BT7IC8PT1ZC9</a><br/><p>This was a cool movie, but the story lost my interest<br /><br />after a half hour.

Will Smith plays the detective to link this confusion together.<br />I had never thought about seeing this movie because I'm not into science fiction, but I do like Will Smith. This movie had some clever lines, interesting characters, and even the robots were entertaining. I loved seeing the futuristic cars (with no gas, I wonder what their running prices are?), trains, gadgets, etc. The only problem I found with this movie is that Will Smith should've died a half hour into the movie but somehow kept living through train crashes, robot attacks, water, etc. And what ever happened to the cat in the trunk?</p></br><a href="../users/AUHG8KSHI529U.html">AUHG8KSHI529U</a><br/><p>I think Will Smith is great on the screen.  Right off the bat, however, he does not need all the profanity his characters are spewing in the past several films.  That aside, this is pretty decent action film.  If you start thinking about Asimov because of the title and the three laws, you will likely hate the film.  However, if you can switch to Marvel Action Hero mode, then this film will seem superior.<br /><br />Will Smith plays Del Spooner who is a troubled soul (like a Marvel Hero, right?).  He has a recurring dream that is increasingly revealed to us throughout the film and he hates robots.  He is almost a Luddite in his attitude towards technology and its effects on human work (the Luddites were 19th century workers from Leicestershire who destroyed the machinery that made them redundant and thereby demonstrated a complete misunderstanding of economic well being and increased productivity - but that is another topic).  For some reason he is close to the supreme scientist of robotics at U.S. Robotics.  He is called in when that doctor apparently commits suicide.  The detective story unfolds from there and the action continually increases in pace.<br /><br />I do not want to reveal any more of the story because I think you will enjoy picking up the details for yourself.  Bridget Moynahan is pretty effective as the very closed robotics scientist, Susan Calvin.  And Alan Tudyk does a fine job voicing Sonny.  Tudyk was the pirate in Dodgeball and making the connection between the two roles is a testimony to his skills as a character actor.  Also, I want to single out Chi McBride. He is an excellent character actor who brings great presence and humanity to the roles he plays.  Here he plays Del Spooner's boss, Lt. John Bergin.  He is an important balance, protector, and foil for Spooner's extreme views and actions.  I mean everyone knows that Robots never commit crimes or hurt humans, right?<br /><br />The animation of the robots is not as effective as it could be.  At certain points they look like so many computerized ants.  However, when you get past that, the movie does work pretty well.  Just remember, think Marvel, not Asimov, and you will enjoy it more.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>"I,Robot" offers interesting hypotheses about man and his relationship to his creations but ultimately this film is essentially a popcorn film with some pretensions.  If it's primarily an action film then director Alex Proyas has achieved his primary goal of entertaining the audience.  If it is a serious exploration of the nature of artificial intelligence then it suffers somewhat in comparison to films such as "Blade Runner" and "A.I.".  Will Smith continues to grow as both an actor and an action-star here.  His down-to-earth quality helps to cut through alot of the pretenses of the film.  The CGI effects are excellent here.  I feared at some point that the robot animation would overwhelm the flesh-and-blood actors on the screen.  This film is not destined to be a classic of the genre but that should not detract anyone from accepting it for what it is and have a good time.</p></br><a href="../users/A1G69BQLIUMWPN.html">A1G69BQLIUMWPN</a><br/><p>This movie is okay.

A film with this exact formula that immediately leaps to mind is "Total Recall."  As with that film the action sequences in "I, Robot" are thoughtfully produced and numerous, the special effects are excellent and extensive, and the one-liners are frequent and humerous.  Will Smith has obviously been hitting the weight room in perperation for his new Action Hero status, and his charming demeanor is still present throughout.  While there are scenes that are ridiculously violent to the point where any mere human could not simply stagger away through the aftermath of destruction, a severe concussion being the least of his injuries, this is Science Fiction, after all.  I have to admit that I went in expecting this movie to be average, at best.  I've read many reviews, both here and from professional critics, panning this film as a grandiose bomb.  I disagree.  This is an entertaining film with a flashy production value and an altogether charismatic leading man.  The fact that this film was directed by Alex Proyas ("The Crow" and "Dark City") never entered into my decision to watch it.  However, I enjoyed "The Crow," and "Dark City" is easily one of the most underrated Science Fiction films of all time.  It wasn't until the ending credits were unveiled did I know he had directed this film, as well.  Had I known I never would have hesitated to see it.  Remember the three laws: action, special effects, and one-liners.  All are necessary in creating an entertaining Science Fiction film; and all are present here.

The story is fairly preposterous, involving, you guessed it, robots and their attempt to take over the world.  And of course Smith's character, Detective Del Spooner, knows that these robots are evil and no one will believe him.  The script is based on Isaac Asimov's book of short stories and co-screenwriter Jeff Vintar's (along with Oscar-winner for "A Beautiful Mind", Akiva Goldsman) original script, "Hardwired".<br /><br />In this world of 2035, robots have come to play a vital role in the lives of humans, doing everything from bartending to laundry for their "owners".  The world is simply teeming with them and their numbers are soon to increase with the largest shipment ever of robots, the NS-5's.  Even though they are programmed to be incapable of injuring humans or committing a crime according to "the three laws", Detective Spooner is convinced they are up to no good and even tackles a robot he believes to be robbing a woman when he is actually rushing her an inhaler.  The three laws are:<br /><br />1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.<br /><br />2. A robot must obey orders given to it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.<br /><br />3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.<br /><br />This is definitely a fun film that I enjoyed immensely.  The whodunit script will keep you guessing and on the edge of your seat right to the end.

I always have to wonder when I start rooting for the "Badguy" in any movie.  Right after Viki gives her last memorable speech of how the human race is run by self interest, self involvment and self everything (which is primarily true), they decide to shut her down and kill her because the truth hurts.  My main question in this movie was, who's the good guy and who's the bad guy?  By the end of the movie, I wanted Will Smith's character dead and his little counter part's character to suffer too.  Not that the robots were anything to cheer about either.  Their faces were enough to punch, and their pompous laid back attitude is what's wrong with humanity in the first place.  I was more intrigued with the first stage robots.  They had kind faces and hearts of gold.  A big problem I had with this movie was the miscasting of Will Smiths character and the fact it ripped alot of the premise of the film off "Blade Runner".

Calling this movie "inspired by" Asimov's story is being nice. So avoid it if you're one of those people who must see a word-for-word adaptation to enjoy the movie.  That being sad, on its own merits this is a very good movie and it's not just some summer movie blockbuster.  Will Smith is, as usual, very good.  The robot special effects are out of sight.

The evolution of robots into laborers appears to be within the grasp of modern technology, and robots beginning to take control of the humans who made them is already here . . like in space travel or microsurgery where people are unable to take manual control of the process  . . .  This concept goes back to RUR, the Czech play of decades ago, but, in any case, this version dissolved into a juvenile shoot-em-up.  Instead of a thoughtful presentation of robots and their potential dangerous side effects, an examination of the advantages and disadvantages of these mechanical workers, it becomes a trivialized and stereotypical piece of nonsense, with the nasty corporate leader, the pretty but skeptical female scientist, the crusty and unbelieving police captain, and the hero, who survives in spite of himself.</p></br><a href="../users/A2D9IEFJGB483Q.html">A2D9IEFJGB483Q</a><br/><p>I'm not sure why they retagged "Hardwired" as "I, Robot."  Will Smith has enough star power, and is a bona-fied sci-fi actor that they had no reason to drag Asimov into the production.  Furthermore, this name game hurt not only the film franchise, but also the novel's good names.  How can they do a film version of "Caves Of Steel" or even the "Foundation" novels if we have this out-of-place script.<br /><br />It is a tribute to Asimov, but then again, all sci-fi is a tribute to the masters: Wells, Verne, Doc Smith, and Asimov.  It would have been much better for continuity's sake to keep "Hardwired" as its own, separate franchise and name. Think of the spin-off, sequels, and TV series that they could have had, without offending all of the die-hard Asimov fans.<br /><br />As to the film, it is great, except for the first fifteen minutes of product placement.  I guess they put it at the beginning because the people who fall for that tend to have short attention spans. Anyone up for boycotting these products?<br /><br />This movie is a tribute to Asimov, so it feels like an Asimov story, but is more of a reaction piece and a distillation to all of Asimov's robot stories.  I almost want to say that after seeing this movie, you have read all of his robot books.<br /><br />I was also reminded of Tom Selleck's 1984 film "Runaway," where he plays a sanitized and popularized Bladerunner.  Intellectually, "I, Robot" is head and shoulders above both of those films.  It makes you think about rules and how we would possible control these robots, and how we could misuse them.<br /><br />"Bladerunner," by comparison, is too self-conscious of its cerebrally, and is too mystical.  It feels like a prologue to the Matrix-as if we haven't seen enough of that film already.<br /><br />I think this film serves as flint to spark one's interest in the novels-they are always better.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TEMNM9ZEOLJ6.html">A1TEMNM9ZEOLJ6</a><br/><p>He plays the only guy in the movie with any common sense, and is thus very unrealistic.

There are also a few bloody scenes of a suicide or murder victim. There are graphic, creative scenes of robot combat and robotic attacks on humans.<br /><br />The investigator has doubts about the suicidal nature of the robot originator's death. The safety glass through which the victim crashed, before falling from a considerable height to his death, is very thick and not easily broken. He suspects that robots have somehow circumvented Law #1 and killed this person, but no one will believe him at first.<br /><br />It takes some time for the truth to come out. Belatedly, some humans suspect that unintended consequences in the function of the robot brain have enabled some robots to acquire the ability to disobey the Laws, and, in effect, to have a form of free will. But further investigation demonstrates that the Laws are still inviolable. It turns out that the robots had evolved their understanding of the three Laws. They now can harm individual people if it causes a benefit to the human race as a whole. In effect, the robots, aware that humans cause such things as wars, are attempting a takeover of the human race, as they are now saving the human race from itself. This is an obvious satire of human behavior.<br /><br />No human wants to be ruled by robots, even ostensibly benevolently-motivated ones. Will the robot takeover succeed? How can it even be stopped at this point? I will not spoil the ending by revealing it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3U56M0Y8LYO6J.html">A3U56M0Y8LYO6J</a><br/><p>Alex Proyas' "I, Robot" is a passable piece of harmless entertainment.  It is just too bad that a better film could not have been made from Isaac Asimov's influential source material.<br /><br />Detective Del Spooner (Will Smith) investigates an apparent suicide at the U.S. Robotics building.  His mistrust of robots leads him to believe that there is more to the suicide of Doctor Alfred Lanning (James Cromwell) than meets the eye.  Suspicion starts to focus on a robot named Sonny (Alan Tudyk) despite U.S. Robotics' insistence that none of their robots could possibly hurt, much less kill, a human being.<br /><br />"I, Robot" is a film that could have been an insightful examination into the nature of the synthetic consciousness.  Unfortunately, it aims lower in its ambition and instead chooses to be more about car chases, fistfights, and special effects galore.  Yet, "I, Robot" is still fun on the most basic of levels.  Smith's natural charisma shines through from start to finish and there is enough brain candy present to engage your mind.  The design of the robots take some getting used to and Bridget Moynahan is totally ineffective in her role, but "I, Robot" has enough going for it to make it worthy of a look-see.</p></br><a href="../users/A2M597GCCE1N2S.html">A2M597GCCE1N2S</a><br/><p>Now we've all seen this plotline before, Robots created by humans start killing mankind to take over the world. However don't let that scare you away from this great movie. All the characters show how they each shine in this sci-fi thriller.<br /><br />Will Smith stars as Del Spooner, a cop that seems to think that the robots made for humans to help with labor will somehow turn on mankind and start thinking for themselves. The only problem he has is that everyone thinks he is just being paranoid, which just proves he will be right as the movie continues.<br /><br />When a roboticist, a guy that designs the robots, is found killed after being tossed outside the ledge of a huge building, that is all it takes for Spooner to believe the, "Rise of the Machines" will happen. The robot being questioned denies any involvment with the doctor's death, even though he was found at the scene of the crime.<br /><br />Its not long before more robots start turning bad, you can tell right before they are by the red lights that flash on inside them. Spooner just somehow always seems to be at the wrong place at the wrong time, as he fends off at least a few dozen at a time when they attack, once in a freeway tunnel in a thrilling car chase that involves two trucks that have sliding doors and at least 40 robots.<br /><br />While the acting may not be the greatest, I found that the robot, Sunny, was really good at trying to express human emotion as all he wants to do is be free and live in a quiet life. Will is good most of the time, as the tough cop who is the one that really knows what is going on as eveyone else thinks he is just stupid at times.<br /><br />And it was the visual effects that made this worth it. The robots are great, as more and more start making an army of renegade robots. As Spooner and his partner, Susan Calvin [played by Bridget Moynahan] are on top of a huge building, trying to shut down the robots, I found it quite dizzying from seeing it at a birds eye view.<br /><br />Another great scene is when the robots manage to get inside the police station in the city, and the lieutenant who is always on Spooner's back fends them off with a shotgun. Great action, sounds, and vivid color all add to the suspense.<br /><br />The big twist on who the real bad guy is in the movie is surprising [At least I thought it was] and if you are the type who likes to just watch the movie instead of trying to figure out the ending then this is great fun. I definately reccomend this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2ZN57YG2NMH.html">A1D2ZN57YG2NMH</a><br/><p>This film was very good. It was better than most that are coming out nowdays.

This story takes some of Asimov's ideas - the three laws of robotics, which Asimov posited would be inevitable with the advent of intelligent robots - and jazzes them up with special effects while missing the underlieing point (i.e. that the positronic brian is designed so that robots cannot violate them - the three laws can't be turned off without destroying the function of the positronic brain itself).  That makes this rather feeble as sci-fi, but good enough for casual viewers who want action and images, which seem all that Hollywood is capable of these days.<br /><br />Recommended tepidly.  You can't watch this like 2001 and constantly see more and differently - once you get it, the concept is used up, as is the case with simple who-donnits.</p></br><a href="../users/A22J9WI2PDAVJ.html">A22J9WI2PDAVJ</a><br/><p>Grab your popcorn, sit back and enjoy this action packed sci-fi thriller. "I, Robot" delivers big budget special effects with strategic product placement and Will Smith's backside. Those are true, time-tested marketing ploys to get some free press. Yes they worked.<br /><br />"I, Robot" begins with an apparent suicide of an engineer pioneer for U.S. Robotics.  Detective Spooner (Will Smith) is sent to investigate.  Spooner has a reason to be suspicious of labor robots. Is that why he was chosen as the lead investigator? Someone is trying to leave him clues to a classic robot mystery. (Who operates the robots?)<br /><br /> The NS4 robots are about to replaced with the newer updated model NS5s. Everyone wants and gets one.  Hold your flux capacitor, those pesky NS5 models have a secret. One NS5 model (Sonny) is the prime suspect. What. A robot.<br /><br />The NS4 robots have three rules: Rule #1,Obey humans, Rule #2, Protect humans from harm! Rule #3, everything else not covered by Rule #1 and 2.<br /><br /> Of course human nature must tend its ugly hand. Detective Spooner and Director of Robot Relations Susan (Bridget Moynahan) join forces to destroy (Not kill) the NS5s.<br /><br />Is this film a premonition of the future of our society?  The labor robots do everything from cooking, cleaning and pleasure dealing for humans. Who cares! Can I get one now!<br /><br />This film utilized mostly green screen acting. Not even noticeable with the actors. The "Making of" is interesting and divulges the green men. The bonus features include upcoming movie trailers of "Electra" and "Robots."</p></br><a href="../users/A20IIR0422G3A5.html">A20IIR0422G3A5</a><br/><p>There are several very good reviews already written on this movie, `I, Robot', most of which accurately point out the fact that, as the movie admits itself in the credits, is only loosely based on the collection of short stories by Isaac Asimov. I'm prompted to write a review of the DVD, because while all these reviews talk about the movie, none of them talk about the DVD.<br /><br />The most important thing about this package is that while it does not include a lot of special features a la `Matrix' and `Lord of the Rings' blockbusters, it does include my favorite feature, which is an alternate soundtrack containing commentary by the writer and the director. This single feature automatically doubles the value of the package as it gives an excellent reason to watch the movie a second time. I really prefer the alternate soundtrack approach to the captions commonly done with older movies, as there is typically much more information given and you can get much more from the intonation of the speakers than you can from the sterile text.<br /><br />That said, I believe the commentary soundtrack on this DVD is not as good as some of the best I have heard. My favorite is those by Kevin Smith, who has been known to supply two different commentary tracks and almost always has a symposium of three or four voices joining his own. A fairer comparison may be to the commentary track on Quentin Tarantino's special edition of `Pulp Fiction'. As both Smith and Tarantino are well known for including obscure `quotes' and references in their flicks, their commentary tracks are especially useful in revealing all the connections.<br /><br />As this movie is loosely based on a justly famous collection of short stories and liberally quotes from other Sci Fi classics such as `2001' and the 1930's Czech play `Rossum's Universal Robots (R.U.R)', this commentary track should be a goldmine, but it is not. While the speakers mention or allude to these references, they give very few concrete connections. I'm convinced that the actor who did the voice of `Sonny', the primary robot character took his queue from the voice of HAL in `2001', but the commentators give me no satisfaction. As the play R.U.R. is a much bigger source for the plot, I was a bit disappointed that this connection was not explored more fully.<br /><br />As there is a direct connection between Will Smith and Kevin Smith, as Will Smith had a cameo in Kevin's last movie, `Jersey Girl', I must point out that both Kevin Smith and the principles of `I, Robot' both have immense respect for Will Smith's talent as a professional movie actor in both courtesy to others and in his artistic contribution to the script and the quality of his improvisations on screen.<br /><br />On the other hand, I found the Susan Calvin character (played by Bridget Monaghan) to be almost entirely uninteresting. She would have been much stronger if she had been played as originally written by Asimov or closer to the Sean Young character in `Blade Runner', the movie I sense the authors were trying their darndest to match. They didn't even come close, primarily, I suspect due less to Will Smith's weakness than to the failure to match Ridley Scott's powerful world based on the great inventions of the original material's writer, Philip K. Dick. `I, Robot' had no hope of matching `Blade Runner', as the latter was much less an action / FX opus than a classic Sci Fi `what if' premise grafted seamless to a film noir atmosphere and imaginative Pacific Rim fusion Los Angles. The driving force of `Blade Runner' is the fact that the androids are designed to die after four years. Asimov's great invention of the three laws of robotics are useful as wallpaper, but do not, ultimately explain the action in the film. They are a red herring used by characters to doubt what is really going on. Oddly, while I found the acting behind the primary robot, `Sonny' to be very good, the writing for this character was very inconsistent. And, inconsistency is highly implausible in a computer-based life form. I was expecting something much closer to the character R. Daneel Olivaw from Asimov's two early robot detective novels, `The Naked Sun' and `The Caves of Steel', where the phobias of the principle human are much more consistent with the world posited by Asimov for the stories.<br /><br />This is certainly a worthwhile Sci Fi movie, although not in the class of `Blade Runner', `Minority Report', or even that great old classic `Forbidden Planet'. Good for a fun evening and a worthwhile second viewing with the commentary track.</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>First let's get the obvious out of the way from the start; "I Robot" although it incorporates elements from some of Asimov's Robot stories has little to do with the short story collection of the same name beyond the character of Dr. Susan Calvin. In fact, "I Robot" began as a homage to Asimov and an original screenplay entitled "Hardwired". When director Alex Proyas ("Dark City", "The Crow") became involved things changed and the screenwriter incorporated more elements of Asimov's stories from the collection once Fox acquired the rights to the title. The only true adapation of Asimov's stories was done by Harlan Ellison in his marvelous unproduced screenplay of the same name.<br /><br />"I Robot" has all the right elements for a great Science fiction/mystery film and, although it doesn't achieve the greatness Proyas so clearly was shooting for, he and the writers on the film have done an admirable job at creating a fun bit of entertainment.<br /><br />Chicago Detective Del Spooner (Will Smith) investigates the murder of Dr. Alfred lanning (James Cromwell)at U.S. Robotics. Spooner, who detests and doesn't trust robots (an idea borrowed perhaps from Asimov's novel THE CAVES OF STEEL). All leads point to a robot named Sonny (Alan Tudyk) as the murderer. Dr. Susan Calvin (a character from Asimov's "I Robot" short stories played by Bridget Moynahan)doesn't believe its possible for Sonny to have killed Dr. Lanning as it would violate one of the Three Laws of Robotics ingrained in every robot as a moral compass or conscience. When machines mysteriously try and kill Spooner and Lawrence Robertson the head of U.S. Robotics tries to kill the case Spooner is building, he becomes suspicious and does some digging discovering far more than he expected about why the murder occurred and who killed Lanning.<br /><br />Visually stunning, Proyas film captures some of the flavor of Asimov's stories although it seems most indebted to Phillip K. Dick's stories and novels (as was Proyas film "Dark City") that deal with androids that develop self awareness. Smith gives a solid convincing performance while Moynahan's performance as Susan Calvin brings life to a character that is sketchy in the screenplay. Nevertheless, the director has created a stylish, involving action film perfect as escapist entertainment. Although the subplot involving Spooner's "racism" regarding robots was a bit heavy handed, it works creating a character that's suspicious of the "good intentions" of robots.<br /><br />The DVD looks particularly good although I'm a bit mystified as to why it wasn't released as a two disc set here as it was in other regions of the world. Because all the extras are are on the same disc as the movie, there are more compression artifacts that one might expect resulting in picture quality a grade or two below what one might expect from a movie like this. Overseas, the film had only the film and multiple commentary tracks on one disc with the extras on a second disc (with many more than the ones included here). My guess is that Fox will release a "Special Edition" somewhat down the road to double dip the fans like many other companies have been doing.<br /><br />The extras are solid if unspectacular with a glimpse behind-the-scenes and into how the FX were created for the movie. Again, more could and should have been done. The packaging with the seep through plastic sleeve is clever.<br /><br />Although the film doesn't quite live up to the hype generated by the terrific trailers Fox used to sell the film, "I Robot" is an engaging, interesting murder mystery with some nice twists and elements from Asimov's stories thrown in for good measure.</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>Based in a Isaac Asimov novel , this film plays hard with the unavoidable and everyday closer presence , deal and consequences around the Artificial Intelligence will impact the world .<br />The original clues given using literature device of Hansel and Gretel and the far echoes who remind in more than a simple coincidence aspect with Blade runner , do not diminsh nevertheless the interesting premise and the dazzling and fluid camera work .<br />Alex Proyas is one of the most intelligent directors in these times .

Literature of any kind cannot be translated to a film without changes.  The only alternative is to shoot the entire book, which results in a film like Erich von Stroheim's Greed, intended to run for 8 hours.  Film makers have little choice but to make compromises.  Looking at the film on its own, I think that I, Robot is a great science fiction film.<br /><br />The place, Chicago in 2035, is a real look into the future and was planned that way by the director Alex Proyas.  The look of the city was designed as it might appear in the future with familiar old buildings and new futuristic designs.  Cars were designed especially for the film to present a logical representation of what people might be driving in 2035.  Altogether, the film presents a complete futuristic world down to the clothing people wear. The story has mystery and suspense and is nicely paced.  The special effects, particularly the robots, were designed to make them believable and not just for a splashy look.  The actors who played the robots were taught to walk and act as a robot.<br /><br />Will Smith does a great job playing the brooding Detective Spooner. I tend to think of Mr. Smith as a comedic actor but he has proven he can handle dramatic roles and in I, Robot he gives his character the right edginess and demeanor.  His distrust of robots comes through without overstatement.  Perhaps Smith's shooting from an airborne motorcycle is a little hard to believe but not impossible, and don't we want a movie to have some excitement. Bridget Moynahan is well cast as Susan Calvin, who designs robots to appear more human and has a gradual transformation from her belief that robots are entirely benign (Ms. Moynahan also has a miraculous shooting sequence, firing a weapon with her eyes closed and hitting only a robot).  Alan Tudyk provides a sensitive performance as Sonny the robot.  We never see Mr. Tudyk's face but his movements and voice make Sonny a real and sympathetic character.  Unfortunately, James Cromwell's character, Dr. Alfred Lanning, dies at the start of the film so we see him only briefly in messages he recorded before his death.  The only significant extra on the DVD is a short piece on "Making of I, Robot."  This has the standard interviews with the stars, director, writers and special effects personnel that gives a good overview of how the film was made and what the director and producers were aiming for in making the film.  By the standards of many DVDs the extras are skimpy for I, Robot.<br /><br />I found I, Robot to be an engrossing film where you care about the characters and are intrigued by the story.  The look of the film is fabulous and takes you into this world of the future in a similar way that Total Recall made Mars a believable place. Highly recommend.</p></br><a href="../users/A2F3M93RRLFQNJ.html">A2F3M93RRLFQNJ</a><br/><p>When you want to see what's wrong with the vast number of big budget action movies, you needn't go much further than I, Robot.  Based extremely loosely on the book of short stories by Isaac Asimov, this film is a crude assembly of action-movie cliches that somehow make an entire film.<br /><br />In a near-future Chicago, robots are commonplace and something of a servant class, bound by the Three Laws of Robotics, which prohibits harm of humans and compels obedience.  When a robot apparently commits murder, the cop who investigates the crime finds something much more threatening afoot than a single homicide.<br /><br />Executed well, this could have been a decent movie, but no one involved seems that interested in any real level of originality.  The writing is loaded with cliches, most prominently with Will Smith's cop character, a sullen but wise-cracking detective who has a deep dislike for robots.  You've seen the same character in a dozen other movies, as well as the wise-and-feisty grandmother, the hard-nosed police captain, the sinisterly pragmatic CEO and the idealistic-and-na?ve scientist.  The action sequences are also often comically stale, with slow-mo, Matrix-like effects that more intrusive than effective.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the movie does have some good stuff; I say "unfortunately" because if it was completely bad, it would be more likely that this sort of movie would be rejected by audiences and we'd stop seeing these relatively tedious flicks.  But the special effects with the robots are often interesting and the story does become a bit more watchable in the last act.  So, although this movie is unoriginal and generally lacking, it has just enough good stuff to merit two stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A2XXV9HF169LCF.html">A2XXV9HF169LCF</a><br/><p>The producers give a vague wave to Asimov's book, but that's about it. Now, I'm not one of those sticklers who thinks every line in the movie should be exactly the same as in the book, but this was just silly. Why bother with the name at all? Aside from wanting to cash in on Asimov's reputation, of course.<br /><br />So Wil Smith is excellent as always, and the character of Doctor Kelvin is pretty cool (can't remember who plays her, but at least they don't alter her basic nature too much.) The plot could have been really good - part of the tragedy of this movie is how much potential it had - but the production went for big kabooms instead of any sense of realistic action. The quest for a bigger, badder action scene absolutely ruined this movie. They might have followed the three laws and used plot elements form Asimov's book, but they threw the basic laws of physics out the window and made the whole set-up "too stupid to live" for the sake of shiny effects instead of playing it straight.<br /><br />All in all, I kind of thought it was going to suck, and I wasn't wrong.</p></br><a href="../users/A1V3TRGWOMA8LC.html">A1V3TRGWOMA8LC</a><br/><p>Cliches reign in this 'Who the hell is Asimov?' sci-fi flick that poses the question 'how many unnecessary camera moves can we do in one fx shot?'. Rock out with some of my favorites:<br /><br />1. Open on a drowning scene involving our hero, which gets explained in flashback through the movie to the main reflection character.<br />2. The hero is a cop who lives alone but visits his 'heart of gold' grandmother in order to show his family's died, he's a loner, or just give us an excuse for dialog.<br />3. Hero actually says to sidekick 'We're not so different, you and I.' (Hero has a robot arm, presumably so he felt some degree of sympathy in an early draft of the script that got trashed.)<br />4. Hardened but good-natured black cop boss (oh for the 70s) actually says to hero 'Give me your badge'.<br />5. In classic B-movie/Outer Limits style, the world's biggest company is run by one evil man and about 3 other people. And - of course - he's not evil after all.<br /><br />Bridget Whatever-her-name-is couldn't act her way out of a paper bag; even James Cromwell looks embarrassed as a hologram. Some of the parallels with slavery and genocide are overworked and unneeded.<br /><br />But it has a couple of enjoyable sequences even though the robots look fake now (they looked good at the time). Btw, 'I am Legend' has continued the trend where we get to hang out with Smith in his undies while he works out, admires his own body, listens to music and showers because he's just *that* cool.</p></br><a href="../users/A3IE0P2JMWW0H7.html">A3IE0P2JMWW0H7</a><br/><p>In the year 2056, police dective Del Spooner (Will Smith) investigates a murder in which the prime suspect is a robot.

For those of you who don't know him as a director, I'm not sure how to classify him. I saw Dark City first which was brilliant and then saw The Crow and couldn't believe that it had come from the same director. (That means that it's bad) Well, now this, and here Mr. Proyas has decided to make an all out insane action movie which is actually fun and worth owning to rewatch the cool action scenes. On top of it, the robots are really cool looking.<br /><br />Anyway, this is about detective Del Spooner played by Will Smith in the near future. In this era, robots are everywhere, used to facilitate everyday life. But Spooner is fishy about them. And when a new shipment of them comes out, he is nervous. But robots can't be bad as that would be breaking their 3 laws. But obviously they're evil and Spponer goes to kick their buts.<br /><br />This movie sadly could have been a fantstic Blade Runnerish movie if it would have been R, and also a suspense movie and not the everyday shootout PG-13 movies.

However, I was pleasantly surprised.  I ROBOT is a mindblowing exercise in technical wizardry and its borrowed Aasimov plotline is intriguing.  A surprisingly buff Smith plays a tortured detective who hates robots (we find out later in the film), and is joined by Bridget Moynahan as a scientist who helps "humanize" robots in a quest to find out why one robot has apparently murdered a human--a no no in the three laws of robots.  The suspect robot is wonderfully voiced by Alan Trydk (spelling) and he's a prime focus point in the film.<br /><br />The effects are brilliant and even though they may go over the top (particularly in the spectacular chase in the tunnel), they are certainly state of the art in their execution.<br /><br />Overall, I ROBOT is top notch science fiction entertainment.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ.html">A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ</a><br/><p>I grew up reading Isaac Asimov like so many young boys in the 70's and once you found his Robot novels and short stories, you really hit the jackpot.  I was very excited to see something like I, Robot put on the big screen using special effects from today.  I KNEW it would be visually stunning (which it was) but I also instinctively knew that without Will Smith's sense of humorous acting, the movie would never break even at the box office.  I believe I was right.<br /><br />Whether you like or hate Will Smith, he has a pretty deep understanding of which movies he should accept for blockbuster appeal.  So far he has a rather impressive group of hits under his belt...really BIG hits.  Without going out too far on a limb, one could successfully argue that in the new century, he is taking over Tom Cruise and Harrison Ford's throne of major box office successive hits.  While Tom still has quite a bit of mileage left in him, Harrison hasn't given Hollywood any Super Hit for quite some time.  A few modest money making movies here and there, but absolutely nothing on the scale he delivered through the bulk of the 80's through the mid 90's.  Will Smith also has something that both Tom and Harrison lack:  genuine appeal in both action, sci-fi AND comedies.  Check out his movies if you disagree.<br /><br />Back to I, Robot.  The plot was so-so.  The effects were Top Notch and very well done, but they would have to be in order to attract Smith to a roll such as this.  If the effects fail, the entire movie does.  Will is a robo-phobic cop who distrusts robots with almost fantaticism.  It is disturbing those around him including his boss.  Robots simply CANNOT commit crimes because they are hard-wired with the 3 Laws of Robotics, originated by the late-great Isaac Asimov himself.  They are perfect and I dare-say that should robotics become possible as they are in this movie, they would be hard-wired with these same laws.  No robot in HISTORY has EVER committed a crime of ANY kind.  And yet Will's character (Dell Spooner) believes not only CAN they, but they WILL, and when they do, it will entirely take mankind by surprise.<br /><br />As the movie opens, Dell is called to investigate what is apparently a suicide by the man credited for creating the greatest robotic revolution in history.  But IS it suicide, or was he killed by a rogue version of the newest robot which is hitting the streets within the week?  All evidence, on the surface point to the fact that suicide is the ONLY logical answer.  But Dell, hating robots as he does, looks at the situation from a completely different angle and begins to ask the tough questions...forcing people to begin to question his sanity in general.  But as it turns out, and as virtually everybody who sees this movie will know from the first frame, that Dell will be proven correct in his assumptions, but exactly HOW is the big question.  Who is behind all of this?  Was it the scientist who committed suicide?  Was it the robot himself?  OR, was it the CEO of the company poised to introduce the world to the largest robotic distribution ever?  Good questions, and fun answers along the way.  Don't expect your intellect to be stretched during this movie and you should enjoy it all the more.  Simply put, a pretty decent example of eye candy put together with great effects.  Will Smith continues to exceed in picking the winners.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FBIF1FKBC193.html">A2FBIF1FKBC193</a><br/><p>Based on a book writtten by the master, Isaac Asimov way way back in the 1940's it would be easy to level some cheap shot criticism at this movie for not being tru to the book...

The movie goes into unbelievable mode far too quick, plus it has a tough time retaining your attention.<br /><br />For the record, I am not an outright critic of SciFi. I am a fan of the genre, but movies such as Bladerunner and more recently, Minority Report, really do it justice. And I LOVED Alex Proyas' work with "The Crow" and "Dark City", but "I, Robot" instead felt more like "Oops, Robot". Do yourself a favor and skip it altogether.</p></br><a href="../users/A2Z28WKY1LHBKY.html">A2Z28WKY1LHBKY</a><br/><p>Just because you're paranoid, it doesn't mean they're not out to get you. It's healthy to be suspicious. Never go with the flow. Never compare a movie with a book: they're different animals. This was an interesting film, although there is little doubt that mankind is actually on the high road to dehumanisation. That's why there was no sex, not much gore, only three human deaths, more hardware than software, and why Smith was a quarter robot himself. At one point I thought he was a robot through and through; and might even have been the mastermind behind the whole set-up. But no, it all turned out right in the end. Reassuring for the kids. Good fun, but not very memorable. Five stars for the sfx and the cgi; and Smith was good as Spooner.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TK6R2JSC97HL.html">A1TK6R2JSC97HL</a><br/><p>A murder mystery set in the not-so-distant future forces a young detective to come to grips with his hatred of robots.  Chicago Detective Del Spooner (Smith) has a distrust for machines in a technological era that runs on robots and other thinking machines.  Robots seem compelled to please, and not remotely human looking...until the advent of the NS5.  USR, the Microsoft of the robotic age, plans to unveil (or unleash in Spooner's estimation) the new robots all at once.  With days to go to the critical moment, Dr. Lanning, the robots' sage creator is found mysteriously killed - shattered in USR's vast lobby.  USR rules the death a suicide, but for Spooner it's the case of his lifetime - the first possible instance of homicide by a robot.  As he probes deeper, he tangles with USR staff but finds an unlikely ally with Dr. Calvin (Bridget Moynahan, who played something of a cold-hearted automaton as Natasha on "Sex in the City").  Even as he finbds signs that something horrible is brewing with the new machines, Spooner finds himself putting his prejudices to the test with Sonny, a prototype NS5.<br /><br />This was a great movie - easily one of those big Hollywood flicks that's better than it has any right to be.  As expected, the flick offers some great CGI scenes, but the movie belongs to Will Smith and whoever he's talking too at the time, whether Moynahan, or Shia Lebouef as a streetwise wannabe-tough guy.  Asimov fans might revolt, but there's nothing here that requires you be a fan of Asimov or even have read any of his stuff.  "I'Robot" has its share of surprises, even if it often feels as if it was prodcued by robots, but never disappoints.</p></br><a href="../users/ADE852UR9121C.html">ADE852UR9121C</a><br/><p>Okay, when the best acting in the movie comes from a robot, you know something's not right. In this futuristic (yawn) movie, Det. Spooner is investigating the death of a roboticist, Dr. Lanning. He finds a protocol NS-5 robot, Sonny in the doctor's room and being the robo-hater that he is...immediately blames Sonny for the murder. Of course, Sonny being the cool, kick-ass robot that HE is, escapes. Spooner, with the help of robot psychologist Susan have to track down Sonny and get to the root of the "who-dunnit" mystery. Oh yeah, robots in the future are programmed with these 3 laws:<br /><br />1) They can't hurt humans.<br /><br />2) They have to follow whatever the hell the human tells them unless it conflicts with Rule 1.<br /><br />3) Robots will do anything to protect themselves unless it conflicts with Rule 1.<br /><br />So, there lies the problem. How could the NS-5 unit have killed Dr. Lanning.<br /><br />I have to say, although I LOVE sci-fi movies...it's a tricky genre to tackle. Overdoing it, and it becomes silly. Not doing enough would make it bland. Plus it has to be original. In I, Robot...I felt like I was watching a mixture of other sci-fi movies particularly Minority Report (which I totally DUG, and have watched it about 10 times). And the sad thing was, the concept behind this movie was pretty interesting (credit to Asimov for that) but of course as soon as they Hollywood-ized it, the movie falls apart. The story is SO typical, it offers nothing new. Det. Spooner is the rogue detective, the "thinking out of the box-crazy type" that 10 minutes into the movie, you know that in the end he's gonna be right, and he's gonna go back to his captain (or whatever) and say "a-ha, in your face". While the robot, Sonny was definitely interesting, it didn't really lead to anything groundbreaking. Apart from that, we have the reluctant but noble heroin, the guy who's trying so hard to be bad that you know he's not the culprit, and a whole lotta unoriginal stuff. To me, this is why the movie failed. As I said, it had an interesting premise but it just doesn't get explored in the way I would've liked it to.<br /><br />The acting is so-so. Will Smith is really starting to irritate me. After his fantastic performances in movies like Independance Day, Enemy Of The State and Men In Black (1, not 2), now he just seems content to look buff and deliver lame lines. More than once, I felt like punching the heck out of him. I know, he didn't have much to work on anyway, thanks to such a dry script, but I still felt he was really miscast here. Bridget Moynahan delivers a mediocre performance, there seemed to be no chemistry whatsoever between her and Spooner, she looked like she was acting with a gun to her head. The rest of the cast do an alright job, probably because they've seen the same thing in a hundred other movies.<br /><br />The saving grace for this movie has got to be the visual effects. There were many scenes with the robots that literally took my breath away. It's amazing how far CG has advanced in movies. Everytime Sonny appears on screen, he steals the limelight. His moves and facial expressions outperforms the humans anytime. Even when he speaks, his voice seem to reflect his emotions, which caused the hoo-ha because robots are not supposed to have emotions. I thought this was done very well, and to be honest kept me watching until the end.<br /><br />In short, save your money...watch this on cable or rent the DVD coz it's really not worth getting. The storyline leaves much to be desired. The acting is less than satisfactory. You're much better off watching sci-fi greats like The Matrix or Blade Runner. Now, if you'll excuse me...I'm gonna watch Minority Report for the 11th time.</p></br><a href="../users/A31RM5QU797HPJ.html">A31RM5QU797HPJ</a><br/><p>In 1940, Issac Asimov wrote I, Robot.  I, Robot was a series of short stories about the Three Laws of Robotics.  The movie version of "I, Robot" does a good job of updating the stories.  Del Spooner is a detective that hates robots, and he is called to solve a mystery surrounding U.S.R.  I would like to think that Asimov would like this movie.  However, look at what happend to Robert A. Heinlein  on "Destintion Moon"</p></br><a href="../users/A2FFYQZPUGOX58.html">A2FFYQZPUGOX58</a><br/><p>Fifteen years ago, Lawrence Robertson and Alfred Lanning founded U.S. Robotics (USR); Robertson supplied the hard-nosed business sense while Lanning provided the technical know-how.  Their Nestor Robots have since become the robots of choice; their last major hardware upgrade was the venerable Nestor-4 (NS-4).<br /><br />The NS-4 has become so pervasive that you can't walk down the street without encountering one.  They are reliable, polite, and have proven to be completely safe.  In spite of their immobile faces with doll-like eyes and slot-like mouths, most people have accepted them as fellow beings.<br /><br />As good as the NS-4s have been, they are showing their age.  At last, USR is about to release the NS-5; it's more intelligent; its face is flexible, with expressive eyes and a working mouth.  Unlike the NS-4, the NS-5 has a radio link with USR's mainframe (VIKI), which will transmit daily software and data updates.<br /><br />There is no need to stand in line for your upgrade; your new NS-5 will be trucked to you.  Upon arrival, it will place your old NS-4 in the truck, which will then take it to the USR landfill.  It will be stored in a large, stacked shipping container with others of its kind, where they can live out their remaining years.<br /><br />Like the NS-4s, the NS-5s are safe.  Hardwired into every NS-5 - including USR's VIKI core - are the "Three Laws of Robotics", developed by Dr. Lanning, who has stated these safety laws are "perfect."  Unfortunately the release of the NS-5 robot has been marred by the discovery of Lanning's crushed body in USR's lobby ... perhaps the laws are flawed after all. . . .<br /><br />Picture (Blu-ray 2008): 5.

In "I, Robot," the high-tech, low-brow adaptation of the classic Isaac Asimov story, he plays pretty much the same guy he always does . . . hip, cocky, fast talking, street smart, etc., etc.  Perhaps on purpose, he looks the human version of the robots, which themselves appear the result of mannequins who traded stem cells with Robocop and an iMac.  Just bolt some skin to the frame and put him in a leather coat conveniently in style today even though the film takes place 30 years from now and, well, you get the point.  A clever attempt to give the film more subtext than it has -- you know, robots aren't much different than us?  Or perhaps a plot twist?  I suppose if you care you'll have to find out for yourself.<br /><br />The film retains some elements of Asimov's seminal work, though in many ways, it has more in common with 1972's "Conquest of the Planet of the Apes," with its examination of slavery as a theme and even a guy jumping out of a high rise to his death, and the far superior "Bladerunner."  The story's mystery is predictably shallow, about the same as the one in "Minority Report," which it also mimics, and to make up for it, there are plenty of action set pieces, done with expensive but sterile CGI effects.  Essentially, robots programmed with three laws against harming humans start to do just that, starting with their creator.  What follows is a revolution of sorts, threatening Shannon Elizabeth clone Briget Moynahan (bad) and the often irritating Shia LeBoeuf (good), who Hollywood in its infinite wisdom seems bound and determined to turn into a star regardless.<br /><br />"I, Robot" isn't a bad movie, but it's not a good one, either.  Visually, it has its moments, but the story never rises above a shallow examination of the premise, and the product placement borders on the absurd.  Yeah, it's a summer movie.  But that's all that it is.</p></br><a href="../users/A2I6MHMAZZDCRX.html">A2I6MHMAZZDCRX</a><br/><p>In the not too distant future, robots are a normal part of life, doing menial tasks and taking care of humans.  With built in rules to make sure they never become dangerous, everyone is happy.<br /><br />Except Del Spooner.  A police detective, he has an innate distrust of machines.  So when his friend and the inventor of robots turns up dead, Del immediately suspects a robot.  When no one takes him seriously, he turns to Susan Calvin for help.  But is he correct?  If so, can he prove the truth and saves humans?<br /><br />This is a fun movie.  It's meant to entertain, and it does it in spades.  The plot is cleaver with some nice clues thrown in to keep the viewer engaged.  And the car chases and action scenes keep you on the edge of your seat.  I'm not a super big Will Smith fan, mainly because of the movies he's chosen to do in the past.  But here he did a great job playing a detective with something to prove even when no one else believes him.<br /><br />This movies sets out to be nothing more then an escapist thrill ride.  And it succeeds in spades.  Perfect for a couple hours of entertainment.</p></br><a href="../users/AX9J0U8J6XTCY.html">AX9J0U8J6XTCY</a><br/><p>WELL, I ALMOST LET THIS ONE JUST PASS ME BY, AFTER READING SO MANY NEGATIVE COMMENTS FROM MY FELLOW AMAZON.COM WRITERS, BUT BOY AM I GLAD I DIDN'T!

Now onto the movie, it had a great story (i dont care if its like the book, who does? some nerd, o freakin well, cry me a river), it was very funny throughout, it had some drama, not heartwrenching but still pretty sad stuff, and the humor didnt hurt the drama or the film it added to the entertainment (unlike comedies whcih suck).  The action was good, not great, there were 2 big action scenes and a few other little ones, what was there was well done, intense, and creative, but we could use alittle more, thats the only thing wrong with the movie, just needs to be longer with more action, but since i already bought the dvd i hope they dont double dip this one, so im satisfied, got my moneys worth.  9 out of a 10.</p></br><a href="../users/A2X6GEC6LCDN4S.html">A2X6GEC6LCDN4S</a><br/><p>A lot of action in this one.  A very simplistic science fiction plot, but I guess good for middle schoolers, who may find it easier to suspend reason.  Will Smith is a good actor, no doubt, but the plot was a little far fetched for me, the evil machine against the good heart of man.  This will be very popular with the U.S. masses.</p></br><a href="../users/A3H9JSM1SUTE4O.html">A3H9JSM1SUTE4O</a><br/><p>As a kid, I spent several hours on a plane seated near "I, Robot" author Isaac Asimov.  It was an unpleasant experience.  Mean, self-centered and arrogant, appeared to be Asimov's three rules of human behavior.<br /><br />More than a smidgen of that dangerous attitude infuses the cyborg menace in the terrifically entertaining I, ROBOT. Using only Asimov's title and the premise of once obedient and safe but now seemingly sentient robots run amuck, this possibly prescient action film stars Will Smith as a paranoid cop investigating a murder involving a robot.  Are his fears of a powerful robot army of workers who turn against their human owners coming true?<br /><br />Asimov may have been writing about the dangers of artificial intelligence, or a metaphor for the Communist Revolution, or perhaps an Orwellian warning about  the power of labor unions -- but don't worry, this film does not get sidetracked with any preachy scenes and in fact the screenplay by Akiva Goldman is all the more powerful because it includes just enough tantalizing intellectual moments to perfectly balance the outstanding visceral energy of the visuals.  A short making-of featurette restates the plot and hints at the complex robot choreography and CGI work.  The main extra is an insightful commentary from director Alex Proyas and Goldman.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FCWRSICTO2AH.html">A1FCWRSICTO2AH</a><br/><p>This was a big disappointment, and easily the worst movie I've seen Smith in.  Smith is so bad, that you have to wonder if acting with computer generated robots was a factor -- but that shouldn't be it, since he's been in a number of films with loads of special effects, and done pretty well for himself. Smith's performance is off, in the sense that he always seems distracted or even bored. It's like he's always cutting a look toward a mirror -- yep, pecs look good. On the good side of things are the robots. Their faces are remarkable in their ability to convey emotion. The trailers for the film don't do them justice. The plot is kind of muddled, but there are a couple of standout action scenes, in particular the chase in the tunnel, that help to raise this movie into the should-see category. But a few good scenes do not make a good movie. Probably the most over-hyped movie of the last year.  Note: Will, take an acting class.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FBGZ4E6KGIW2.html">A3FBGZ4E6KGIW2</a><br/><p>I wanted to see this for a while and I thought it was a letdown.  It held my interest for only a few seconds (which I think it's obvious which scene that was, I wasn't expecting that) There are special effects, but those could be created with a computer for any movie at any time.  I like Will Smith, but this just doesn't do it for me.  If sci-fi is what you crave, I would say look elsewhere.  I've seen the comparisons to Blade Runner, which don't hold up to me because at least I can say I enjoyed that movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TDK8D4HEMUYW.html">A2TDK8D4HEMUYW</a><br/><p>Fox is ridiculous. They're doing this with three films I know of: The Day After Tomorrow, Man on Fire and I, Robot. The problem is, of course, that these films were all very, very recently released on DVD for the first time. If they were truly interested in the interests of the Consumer, they would have released the two-disc editions the first time around - not one or two months later.<br /><br />The second problem with all this is that the "new" special features really aren't worth an upgrade. I don't see anything new on "I, Robot" save a movie ticket to see "The Fantastic Four" and an extra documentary. (By the way, the European release had all of these extras already - except the movie ticket - because they were kind enough to release a one-disc rental copy and a two-disc special edition SIMULTANEOUSLY.)<br /><br />I'm not a huge contender of special edition re-releases. I've shelled out the cash for them before, and in many cases I love when films (such as the upcoming Casino, Stripes, etc.) are re-released with new special features that weren't available on the original DVDs. (Because most of the time they were released at the turn of the '90s when DVDs were fairly new and not known for their expansive features.)<br /><br />However, to release special edition DVDs of films that have just been released on DVD to begin with is a real crime in my opinion. I'll probably buy "Man on Fire" but I will not buy "I, Robot" or "The Day After Tomorrow" - or, for that matter, Focus Features' re-release of "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" (which only contains four extra features, all of which are supposedly very poor.)<br /><br />These companies need to wise up.<br /><br />As far as the film "I, Robot" goes - it's better than I thought it would be. A pretty good brainless action blockbuster, good fun, nothing more.<br /><br />Not worth spending over $40 on once you own both DVDs, though.</p></br><a href="../users/A2VMT89TCSF105.html">A2VMT89TCSF105</a><br/><p>I've seen this movie three times, and still can't force myself to like it. Frankly, it's boring. Will Smith looks bored, so does Bridget Moynahan (Sylvia Calvin) and Chi McBride. The "funny" one-liners are boring, too. The only person smiling in this production seems to be the robot, Sonny. And he's mostly animated! The movie is saved to some extent by the dramatic finale, when the robots come alive and try to take over the world (what else?). But not by much. Even during the finale, Smith and Moynahan look bored and boring! "I, Robot" ends with a cliff-hanger, implying that another revolution is in the air, this time led by the nice guy Sonny. But since there's no sequel, we're ultimately left with nothing at all...<br /><br />Two stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HII4U9WQ0XUV.html">A2HII4U9WQ0XUV</a><br/><p>Look: what you came to see was Will Smith, a typically competent actor who can do macho-hip-urban-cool in his sleep, and lots of shiny stuff exloding and breaking, right? You did *not* come to wrestle with the eternal soul-crushing dilemma of what, exactly, constitutes Artificial Intelligence, and whether or not it constitutes a Moral Evil to use creatures with feelings and 250 IQ points to clean our toilets and haul out our trash.<br /><br />Am I wrong? Well I tell you this, whatever the case: if you wanted shiny things getting broken with a side order of Will Smith, you got cheated. Check out "Independence Day" for that. And if you wanted to wrestle with the soul-searing, heart-warming problem of what to do with your local warm-fuzzy AI robot, then you should check out "Blade Runner".<br /><br />The point is this: "I, Robot" is cinematic carbon dioxide: it's odorless, colorless, and tasteless. In fact, it's riskless: it's so determined to be a staunch, dollar-earning blockbuster that it does absolutely nothing daring or terrifying. Did you know that good-guy robots wink at you to let you know everything is all right? No? Did you know that you can tell the Evil Wicked Robots from the Duddly-Do-Right Robots by the little chest lantern: Red means Evil, Blue means Good? You didn't? Did you ever expect that on a weekend you'd be watching Will Smith cowering at the top of a Chicago skyscraper while Evil Robots climb up the building ready to do him in?<br /><br />"I, Robot" is without a doubt the stupidest (and I use that word intentionally, because the movie merits it), most boring film I have ever had the misfortune to suffer through. It is amazing someone like the talented Alex Proyas (who helmed up the nifty "Dark City" and iconic "The Crow") had his hand in this slick, sleek, embarrassing and boring mess. It is positively sacrilegious that the great science-fiction luminary Isaac Asimov has his name affixed to this thing---if anything justified rising from the dead and eating brains, "I, Robot" is it. And it didn't have to be this way: even on a strictly action-movie level, Proyas manages to take some potentially cool scenes (the hulking, scary, highway robot transports) and completely ruin them (again, more robots jumping on a car...zzzzzz).<br /><br />The thing that annoys me most about the excremental "I, Robot" is that I now suspect the robot was winking at me because he knew I couldn't get my money back. The movie's original tag-line was "One Man Saw it Coming".

Alan Tudyk's portrayal as Sonny, the robot with its own personality that can choose not to obey the three laws was really good. He really is the soul of the film.<br /><br />I admire the fact that director Alex Proyas tried to blend a good science fiction story with a popcorn movie mentality, although it falls well short of being a classic because of that. Even the special effects, the fights, and the bots were all good. This is one of Smith's better movies (up there with Independence Day). The film works, but one wonders what could have been if Smith didn't always try for a laugh, or if they went for a darker feel. However, despite those problems, it was a fun film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CYOHNGQ1WED1.html">A1CYOHNGQ1WED1</a><br/><p>If you like sci fi/action movies, this isn't a bad one. If you want depth to your story, try Bladerunner instead. As the credits say, this was only "suggested" by Isaac Asimov's book. Except the title and the robot laws, it has nothing to do with the collection of stories. Will Smith does his usual "action Will" job here. Funny at times, heroic at others, 'I'm right and everyone else is wrong' most of the time. The effects and overall look of the movie are well done with one caveat: two of the action scenes are so dependent on effects, and don't blend well with the humans in the scene, that you don't believe for one second that it's actually happening. Overall a good sci fi/action flick if you don't think too hard about the story.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RKI7RPP5CJMG.html">A2RKI7RPP5CJMG</a><br/><p>First of all, I haven't read Isaac Asimov's "I, Robot," so I don't have any basis on which to compare the book to the film.  However, I have watched many science fiction flicks.  I enjoy adventures such as the original "Star Wars" trilogy, action flicks like the recent "Resident Evil:  Apocalypse," and the type of sci-fi that leaves you in a reflective mood, such as "Close Encounters of the Third Kind."<br /><br />I expected "I, Robot" to lean towards the "Resident Evil" genre of sci-fi.  Plenty of shoot'em up action and brainless explosions that are good for a Sunday afternoon, but won't expect you to think too much.  Add to the fact that Will Smith is in the starring role, and I expected the action to be hopped up on streetwise, smarty-pants humor.  Imagine my surprise when, after viewing the film, I was amazed at how really good this flick is.<br /><br />Granted, it is full of fast-paced action that any Playstation fan would jump with glee for, but it also has a really great murder mystery aspect to it that leaves you questioning just who the bad guy really is.  Also, Smith's token smart mouth is toned down a little, and I actually enjoyed watching him on the screen.  He seems to have finally matured into an adult, and his face is finally showing a little age, which makes it easier to believe in him as a toughened cop.<br /><br />The story starts out with Smith's character, Spooner, investigating the murder of a brilliant scientist responsible for introducing personal robots into society.  These robots provide companionship, do manual labor, and serve as all-around go-to's when needed.  Of course, Spooner believes this reliance on robots is only the beginning of something horrible down the road.  He immediately suspects one of the newest robotic creations to be the murderer of the good doctor.  He, along with a fellow employee of the deceased doctor, goes out to find who or what did the deed and why they did it.  What follows is a quickly paced action film that has plenty of intelligence for the viewer with an I.Q. above the average moviegoer.<br /><br />The story does start out somewhat slow, but it picks up about thirty-minutes in on both the action and intellectual levels.  Don't worry, you can still watch this as a brainless flick, but its story is so good that you'll be hard pressed not to follow it.<br /><br />The special effects are fun to watch.  It is amazing how life-like the robots are.  Sonny, the murder suspect, manages to win over even the toughest critics with his human emotions and actions.  I forgot that he wasn't real while watching the movie, making this story that much easier to digest.<br /><br />The DVD itself is sparse on extras.  There is a little "making of" documentary and a stills gallery.  There's also a commentary provided for those folks who have nothing better to do.  Honestly, I glance at some extras on DVDs, but I hardly look at them more than once.  If you're like me, you won't miss the movie trailers, cast filmographies, or other fluff that is sometimes put on these discs.  I buy these things for the films on them, not to learn why certain scenes are left on the cutting room floor.<br /><br />In closing, buy this flick if you like intelligent murder mysteries with a twist.  If you like sci-fi flicks in general, this movie won't let you down.  If you're an action fan, this motion picture has plenty of that, too.<br /><br />Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A9LAPV8XNKZVZ.html">A9LAPV8XNKZVZ</a><br/><p>A big screen video game.

What a punk.</p></br><a href="../users/A2J57EQ9KPGXR9.html">A2J57EQ9KPGXR9</a><br/><p>If you never read Asimov, then you will enjoy this film. Stuff blows up real good, Will Smith wisecracks and shoots stuff and the co-star adds to the hoochie factor.<br /><br />But if you read the book, well the phrase "Asimov spinning in his grave" comes to mind. The idiot screenwriters, treating the 3 Laws of Robotics as a suggestion, created a script full of "Crazy Killer Robots". This was something Asimov often poked at in his writings. The Outer Limits episode called "I, Robot" is more faithful than this mess.<br /><br />What's worse, Alex Proyas, the director of the great "Dark City" directed this affront to good sci-fi.<br /><br />And I thought "Minority Report" was as bad as it could get...</p></br><a href="../users/A3QJU4FEN8PQSZ.html">A3QJU4FEN8PQSZ</a><br/><p>This might have been a great movie, but it's impossible to get past Smith's gawkiness and "attitude", lending a clownish cast to his character. The whole tone of the movie is colored by his misguided acting. All seriousness is lost in his silly quips and awkward costuming. "Somehow 'I told you so' doesn't quite say it." Horrible scripting in many instances. "This thing doesn't run on gas, does it? Gas explodes, you know!" Yuck. Thanks for ruining it, Big Bird.<br /><br />And the CGI is not too impressive either. The sight of swarms of robots jumping around like grasshoppers doesn't exactly inspire awe; looks more like a bad scene from a videogame. Although I liked the concept of cables for muscles.<br /><br />But how about the story? As I mentioned, it's totally dominated by Smith's "Bad Boys" persona and his ridiculous costumes which accentuate his ears (and earrings). His strutting and brooding and constant throwing around of his weight crowd out any serious consideration of the plot. It's jarring. It's a complete mismatch for this type of movie. They might as well have cast Jon Lovitz in the part.<br /><br />But perhaps this was necessary, as the plot has huge gaps in logic. Why do robots in the dark seek out light? asks one of the characters. Well, all musings on AI aside, it must be a function of programming. Everything about them is, even when they behave unpredictably. I guarantee you there is a subroutine in their brains that, when certain conditions are met, fires off a command to move towards the light. Nothing profound about that. The only mystery arises from our ignorance of those necessary conditions.<br /><br />The movie is further ruined by some silly "big air" gunfighting from Smith, again completely out of place in this movie.<br /><br />And why does he hate robots so much? You'll laugh until you cry when you find out. And then you'll want to slap him silly.<br /><br />Oh. And another thing. It's implausible that we would manufacture robots of such strength and, well, hardness without some easy way to disable them, just in case. It's just too scary for us otherwise - that's human nature. No one wants to be in a building at night with an automaton that can pull your head off if its software or hardware fails - talk about Blue Screen of Death.<br /><br />Finally, there is no conflict regarding the three laws in the movie, so don't expect any philosophical musings in that regard. The issue is cheaply circumvented.</p></br><a href="../users/A2F3SXHT6RBV81.html">A2F3SXHT6RBV81</a><br/><p>A Conspiracy of Robots., September 8, 2006<br /><br />Reviewer: Betty Burks (Knoxville, TN) - See all my reviews<br /><br />In the futuristic world of 2035 Chicago, there were very few humans anywhere. When I was there, the streets were teaming with people from all walks of life and hurrying as if their very lives depended on getting there first. This is a sterile place full of interactive robots, inside and out. Some of the blue-eyed Sonny robots had started to malfunction after the doctor is found dead on Daley Plaza. It was put forth that Sonny was a "mistake" as the doc had programmed him to dream and to obey his wishes. You do what someone asks you if you love them. I loved the cat.<br /><br />Chicago had never looked more beautiful, clean, no clutter, no rubbish. We all have a purpose for being where we are at any particular time or place. Sonny had performed the thing he was made for. "Now I have fulfilled my purpose, I don't know what to do." That's what it feels like to be free. Why's that? The killer robots with red light attempted a Revolution, but the good guys aided by Sonny'who couldn't die technically as he had never been alive, put Vicci out of commission and its undeniable logic is transformed and diminished until virtually dead. The homicide detective ate a whole sweet potato pie before he pursued and tackled a robot thought to be stealing a purse in the downtown Loop area, but it was all a misunderstanding.<br /><br />This was documented history and some excessive violence like in the tunnel with the auto accident. The human cop had artificial arm, hand, and internal organs. Someday this world may exist, but it won't be in our lifetime.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>I, Robot (Alex Proyas, 2004)<br /><br />Man, I heard a lot of bad things about this movie after it came out. Still, I'm a hige fan of Alex Proyas, and I had to give it a shot. I'm glad I did.<br /><br />Spooner (Will Smith) is a detective in 2035, when robots are commonplace. Spooner is not a big fan of robots despite, as we find out in the first scene, having had his life saved by one. He is called to U. S. Robotics, the company that manufactures all those robots, after Alfred Lanning (Babe's James Cromwell) plunges to his death from hundreds of feet above the building's lobby. Everyone else is convinced his death is a suicide-- but Spooner's not so sure. With the company poised to roll out its new line, CEO Lawrence Robertson (Bruce Greenwood) isn't thrilled with an anti-robot cop running around.<br /><br />The first thing you have to do with I, Robot is to divorce it from the source material. This is not Isaac Asimov's novel. (It probably would have been a good idea for them to put a different title on it.) In fact, it admits this, stating that the movie was "inspired by" the novel rather than based on it. So don't think of it as a bad adaptation of Asimov, or that's what you're going to get. The second thing you have to do with it is forgive it its relatively stupid climax and even stupider ending. Obviously, someone has a lot of his special effects budget left and didn't want to get less money for effects for his next film. That said, the effects are, in fact, pretty cool, and if you can switch your brain off when we get to the climax, you've got a chance.<br /><br />It's a shame you have to, though, because the first hour or so of the movie is a well-plotted, intelligent mystery flick. Sure, it's nothing special-- renegade cop who thinks he's onto the truth while everyone else thinks he's nuts-- but it's done with style and humor. And, of course, lots of special effects. This is a story that allows for exploration with effects, and Proyas takes advantage of that, much like he did in Dark City. The difference is that there, he managed to rein in the compulsion to descend into effects-mania that he shows here. (Perhaps the smaller budget helped.) When it comes right down to it, Proyas is a very good director, and this could have been a truly fantastic film. As it stands, it's not a bad film, but it didn't quite realize its potential. ***</p></br><a href="../users/A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ.html">A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ</a><br/><p>This was an impressive film.  Not from the standpoint that it was a great story or with great actors, it was the quickness of the plot that impressed me.  I don't normally say this, but the fact that I. Robot moved exactly to the points that needed to be moved without any misleading, poor back story, or cheesy Will Smith moments impressed me.  Director Alex Proyas knew exactly how to manage the excessively huge budget and make sure that we, the audience, were getting the biggest bang for our buck.  Yes, there were downfalls to this film, but somehow I could overlook them.  I will be the first to admit that this was not my favorite type of film.  The huge CGI scenes, the grossly overpaid actors, and the disrespect to one of Asimov's infamous books by the same title will really churn your stomach (as it did mine), but unlike the rest of these types of film, I, Robot did something different.  It kept the eye candy going throughout the film and really never let your eyes rest.  This very imaginative world, almost a fantasy world, had something to keep your eyes busy the entire time, and I loved it.  Whether it would be Will Smith's semi-plastic looking Audi, or the Sony created "Sonny" robots infiltrating the city, your eyes will definitely walk away from this film with bulging bellies and a desire for more.<br /><br />Outside of the visually pleasing aspect of this film, you really don't have much to enjoy.  Will Smith's performance is mediocre at best.  He tries to do his best throughout the film, but after his introductory shower scene that was completely unnecessary it is only continually going downhill.  He tries to play the bad boy style that he patented in such film like Bad Boys to this project, what ultimately fails is his ability to handle the discrimination towards the robots.  I never really felt as if he actually disliked them, no matter what the sub-story claimed it just never felt real.  I think what ignited this feeling was Chi McBride's role.  Don't get me wrong, he is a decent actor, but he was trying to bring his role from Boston Public to this part.  He was trying too hard to be the hard-nosed Lieutenant that constantly fought with Spooner, but instead it just came across as Chi being Chi.  There wasn't anything exciting about him in the least bit.  Looking deeper into all the characters, this is what I felt was a major flaw with this film.  The actors really gave nothing spectacular to their roles.  They were minimally developed and several of them seemed like Swiss cheese.  It felt like wasted talent in this film.  Proyas knows better.  He knows how to get great performances from his people; I don't know what pulled him from his norm in this project.  Cromwell, Greenwood, and even Bridget Moynahan were just hitting that average line.  This was yet another glowing example of what happens when money is spent on CGI instead of highly trained actors.<br /><br />So, it looks like we have a superbly visual film coupled with horrible, below the line acting.  What did you expect?  This was your average action film with superior CGI.  I mentioned before on how the visual work is what really kept my eyes glued to the screen, but there was one other element that just rattled my mind.  In an attempt not to give the ending away, I will say this much.  It is not happy.  I do not think that upon viewing the ending of this film you have this sense of joy and comfort knowing that everything is going to be hunky-dory.  It is as if you are viewing the beginning chapter to a much bigger story, and that was interesting to me.  Proyas is notoriously known for his subtle dark endings that keep you on the brink of wonder (see Dark City), and I, Robot was no exception.  It was a brief moment of excitement to see this ending, after a brutal battle sequence where your mind could literally fall asleep because you already know the results, you have this mind-bending ending that really creeped me out.  Perhaps I read the ending wrong, but I wasn't at ease when the credits rolled.  I snickered because I thought of what could be coming, but definitely not a jump-up-and-down with glee sort of moment.  It was strange, but beautifully Proyas.<br /><br />Overall, this was a decent film.  I think I would reference this film similar to the way that I felt about the actors, it was just barely hitting the average line.  This was better than I expected (which isn't saying much since I was expecting it to be a dud) with really amazing visuals, but you cannot stand on those alone.  For this film to really have succeeded, you would have needed to counter balance the CGI with a better story (more details about the laws and more development with Cromwell's character) and much better acting.  I see why the producers went with Smith because he is bankable, but he just didn't bring the human element to the table like it was needed.  I couldn't see his hatred enough to really bring about his emotional change.  I needed more, but found less.  Decent, but nothing that will touch my DVD player again.<br /><br />Grade: *** out of *****</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDNTB7377YH2.html">A1CDNTB7377YH2</a><br/><p>After suffering through Will Smith's sleepwalk performance in MIB II, I was pleased by the energy level he brings to this fast paced fun movie.  Smith lives in a world where robots are commonplace, serving humans (reminicent of the 4th Planet of the Apes movie) as nannies, butlers, and general servants.  He is called to solve the murder of a scientist, who was his friend.  The only possible suspect seems to be a robot.  The only problem is that robots are subject to Isaac Asimov's 3 laws, meaning that it is impossible for a robot to harm a human.<br /><br />As things progress we also learn that Smith, a robot hater, is part robot himself, with some bionic parts.  As things progress we find out that there maybe the three laws are not absolute and there may be some ways around it.<br /><br />There are some fast paced tense scenes and there are some enjoyable supporting characters such as Smith's mother and the lady robot scientist that Smith seems to like.</p></br><a href="../users/AHIK7BUXFRMT8.html">AHIK7BUXFRMT8</a><br/><p>Isaac Asimov is my favorite sci-fi writer of all times. I have almost everything sci-fi that he has written and have read many of the stories more times than I can remember. This movie introduces Asimov's famous "Three Robotic Laws" and an early heroine named Susan Calvin.<br /><br />Asimov writes of his interest in robots as early as his teenage years and comments that the stories were divided into two classes; robots as menace and robots as pathos. "These charmed me"  he tells us of the robots as pathos class in the introduction to a collection of robot stories, To the best of my knowledge Asimov never wrote a robot story named "I, Robot" but acknowledges he was greatly influenced by a short story of that name written by Eando Binder in late 1938. As a tribute perhaps Asimov later assembled several of his Susan Calvin short stories into a group he named "I, Robot."<br /><br />We also meet Susan Calvin in the movie who was a special character favorite of Asimov's and appeared in 10 short stories about robots. Asimov tells us "The third robot story I wrote, "Liar" introduced Susan Calvin--with whom I promptly fell in love." In the movie the role of Susan Calvin is beautifully played by Bridget Moynahan.<br /><br />The Will Smith character, Del Spooner, never appears in any of Asimov's stories to the best of my knowledge. Asimov did have a robophobic policeman named Lije Baley who is introduced in his 1953 novel, "The Caves of Steel." Baley is forced to establish a working relationship with a humanoid robot named Daneel Olivaw. The robot, Sonny, voiced by Alan Tudyk, plays a role most similar to the Daneel Olivaw character in "The Robot Novels" series.<br /><br />Just looking at the movie I found it to be a good science fiction action movie and have enjoyed it more than once. If you find the movie interesting I assure you you'll find the books even more so. I see the Robot series as a prelude to the Empire series followed by the extensive Foundation series.  Counting all of the related books there are presently over 15 and three more, written by other authors, have been added with the approval of the Asimov estate. These books are a grand representation of the genre.</p></br><a href="../users/AMYMJ96STIRW.html">AMYMJ96STIRW</a><br/><p>Back in the days of "Fresh Prince" Will Smith was a blast of fresh air in the genre, but in this movie he shows that he is a major talent.

Have a open mind and you will love it!</p></br><a href="../users/AYWAY5MKLAITN.html">AYWAY5MKLAITN</a><br/><p>Although this movie is heavy on the effects it is also heavy in mystery. No one is quite sure why a robot, which is three laws safe, just all of a sudden murders someone. And that's why the film's protaganist has to be a robot hater. It's a turmoil of mixing one's job with one's dislikes. But the robot creates a sympathetic demeanor which gives way to numerous questions. Can robots lie? Are they learning new tricks? More importantly, what are they after besides our acceptance. From the same man who brought you Dark City comes a sci-fi rush to the finish line that will leav you aching for more. Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/AZSN1TO0JI87B.html">AZSN1TO0JI87B</a><br/><p>Will Smith is easily the most charismatic man in Hollywood today. Everyone loves him. If we were going to have one celebrity run for President, he would be the best choice. I mean, Will Smith is the guy. He has shined through in so many big-budget block-busters in the past, it almost seems like he can make anything work. It's just too bad that up until now, he has been trapped in sequel Hell ("Bad Movie Boys 2" and "Men In Bad Movies 2" are ones that come to mind). "I, Robot," however, is a nice return to fresh form for Smith. It embraces all of the cliches that we've seen in other sci-fi/action movies, but makes it all seem so new and exciting. Smith plays Detective Spooner, caught in the year 2035 where robots and humans live in perfect harmony. The robots serve as servants to the human beings. Seemingly loyal, no one can find a kink in these magnificent machines -- which by the way, are gloriously designed, nice to see something besides "Terminator" clones -- except for, of course, you guessed it, Spooner. He is overly paranoid of these robots, and when the inventor of them is splattered all over the lobby of USR (if you can't guess what it stands for, stop reading) headquarters, Spooner instantly suspects a shady, "unique" robot by the name of Sonny of committing murder. The catch here is that according to the three robot laws, a robot basically cannot harm a human being. And thus, the set-up. The movie moves at a breakneck speed and it's really tough to tell what's coming up next. The action scenes are stunning, as the pace never really lets up. This is one of the few movies in it's genre that keeps the audience guessing. Will Smith is great in his role, and definitely pulls out all the stops with the character. It's nice to see him in such a well-made movie again. Reminds me of the glory days of the first "Men In Black" and "Independence Day," movies that defined popcorn entertainment. Again, a lot of the movie has been done to death in other films, but this does well enough with the material that all is forgiven. The only real flaw I can find is that some key plot-points are difficult to catch, and unless you're watching it at home, where you can rewind, you're likely to get left in the dust. But overall, it's a great movie, with a timeless theme that I think everyone watching can appreciate. It's not the biggest brain-teaser or the most original movie, but it definitely satisfies anyone hungry for some good solid entertainment.</p></br><a href="../users/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z.html">AEQFYOI6YJ83Z</a><br/><p>Ok, so maybe this movie isn't exactly a "thinking person"'s film (although it does feature more of a conscience than most big-budget action flicks), and maybe it isn't faithful to the original story, and maybe the special effects are rather extraordinary.  Surprised?  After all, we're talking about a summer blockbuster, not an Oscar winner.<br /><br />That aside, "I, Robot" is a pretty enjoyable movie (that's how I judge films, by the way: whether or not they were enjoyable--I don't really care if they make me think too much; I wanna think, I'll open up my physics textbook).<br /><br />Will Smith delivers another superb performance as Spooner, a predictably old-fashioned cop living in--you guessed it--the future.  Robots, you see, have become a household necessity; Spooner doesn't have one because he doesn't trust them.  And this new model coming out...well, something about it just doesn't sit right with our hero.  Especially when one robot is suspected of murder.  If one robot can kill a person...what about these thousands of new robots hitting the market...<br /><br />Asimov's stories were definitely more philisophical than this film; however, standing on its own, "I, Robot" is a great action flick.  Not the deepest movie to come along, and it sure has a lot of male bravado and over-the-top special effects...but if you're still reading this review, that's probably the type of movie you want.  Yeah, it's an underrated flick...which means it's much better than what you've heard.  "I, Robot" is a great movie for cuddling up on the sofa and sharing some buttery popcorn.  Hmmm...I'm getting in the mood to watch it again!</p></br><a href="../users/ANGH6401L9Y0T.html">ANGH6401L9Y0T</a><br/><p>Will Smith certainly gets the interesting science fiction action pictures, doesn't he? This is one of the best he's done. The closing credits say it was "suggested by" Asimov's story. But those of us who remember the story will remember that it was a short story, one of several in a book by the same name, but not anything long enough to be a feature-length movie out of it. Still, the necessary elements are there, and what's been made of them would make old Isaac proud.<br /><br />Will Smith plays Del Spooner, a Chicago cop of the not-too-distant future, when robots are becoming very common in society, and everyone knows the three laws of robotics:<br /><br />1. A robot cannot harm a human, or through inaction allow a human to come to harm.<br />2. A robot must obey the orders of a human unless they conflict with Rule One.<br />3. A robot must protect its own existence unless it conflicts with Rule One or Two.<br /><br />Asimov has promulgated these three laws for long enough that most science fiction fans are familiar with them. We are also familiar with stories written about attempts to circumvent this hard-wired programming. So when a famous robotic designer is found fallen out of his office window onto the marble atrium below, everyone assumes it was suicide, because no one was in the office with him at the time. But Spooner is suspicious of robots (we find out why eventually), and figures the scientist was murdered, possibly by a robot. Sure enough, an apparently out of control robot is discovered in his office, and Spooner figures it for the killer. But of course everyone, including Dr. Susan Calvin, robot psychologist, tells him that's just not possible.<br /><br />Now, this really is a mystery, and the clues lead everywhere and nowhere, so I don't want to ruin it for you. Let's just say that almost no one in this film is what they seem to be at first, except perhaps Spooner's granny. And don't be too sure about her, either.<br /><br />It's a real hardware movie, with lots of fast action and things going smash, which should satisfy the younger crowd. But it's also a make-you-think sort of plot at several levels, and that's the kind I especially enjoy. Not to mention seeing Smith bare-chested. The man is buffed!</p></br><a href="../users/A2VP7JOT3K7PFM.html">A2VP7JOT3K7PFM</a><br/><p>XXXXX<br /><br />"LAW I: A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.<br /><br />LAW II: A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the first law.<br /><br />LAW III: A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second law."<br /><br />The above is found printed on-screen at the beginning of this sci-fi action film.<br /><br />This movie is loosely based ("suggested by," according to the end credits) on Isaac Asimov's short-story collection also entitled "I, Robot."<br /><br />Some people don't seem to like this movie, but I found it interesting.<br /><br />This movie is set in Chicago in the year 2035.  By this time, anthropomorphic ("human-looking") robots are doing menial tasks for humans.  All robots have as their core programming the three laws indicated above.  But something seems to go wrong and a human is found dead.  (Not just any human, but a genius roboticist played by James Cromwell.)<br /><br />Enter homicide detective Dell Spooner (Will Smith who also was one of this movie's executive producers) who has to try to solve exactly what happened.  A robopsychologist (Bridget Moynahan) aids Spooner in his investigation.  (Believe it or not, even robots need shrinks.)<br /><br />Yes, this movie has plenty of action and special effects.  The action, though, is not mindless and I found myself pausing to think.  As well, the special effects were done well and did not take over the movie.  I liked especially how the robots interacted with humans.  (The technique used for the robots was "motion capture" and I found it to be quite effective.)<br /><br />As I said, this is an action movie that gives you pause to think or consider artificial intelligence and even what it means to be human with respect to such things as consciousness, uniqueness, death, having a purpose in life, free will, creativity, and evolution.<br /><br />This movie has good background music that aided each scene.<br /><br />Finally, the DVD itself (the one released Dec. 2004) is excellent in picture and sound quality.  It has several extras.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a good, futuristic sci-fi movie that causes you to think.  And don't worry: no actual robots were hurt during the making of this movie!!<br /><br />(2004;  1 hr, 55 min;  wide screen;  39 scenes)<br /><br />&lt;&lt;Stephen Pletko, London, Ontario, Canada>><br /><br />XXXXX</p></br><a href="../users/A2C7BOQVFH1HLE.html">A2C7BOQVFH1HLE</a><br/><p>I have to disclose right at the start that I have never read an Isaac Asimov book and so I can only judge the movie without any reference to the book it is based upon.  Now that I've got that out of the way, I also have to say that I have always liked film noir and so movies that are even remotely noir-ish like this one and say "Blade Runner" or even "Gattaca" have a headstart with me.  That said, while the movies share similarities with each other e.g. the Smith and Harrison cop characters after renegade artificial life forms etc "I, Robot" rises above just being a shoot-em up, all action film but also appeals to a thinking audience raising the issue of bigotry and prejudice with Smith's hatred of all things robot based upon his one bad experience with them and how all this changes once he gets to know and understand them better.  There are some elements though that detract from the enjoyment of the movie such as the inclusion of scenes that are not necessary; while I am fan of Shia LeBeuf for example from his work on "The Greatest Game Ever Played" I thought his scenes were totally useless here and that the film would be far better off without any of his scenes.  I also got the feeling that the film was too short and that far more meat could have been included to the story to develop the main characters more.<br /><br />The good storyline aside though this movie has excellent 1080p picture and sound quality coming in DTS HD 5.1 MA making this a strong candidate for reference quality blu-ray disc.  The special feature documentaries while not great are still pretty good and unless you are a diehard fan who has to have every single tidbit this average viewer for instance is happy with this release.<br /><br />This blu-ray release has excellent picture and sound quality and a decent storyline making this a worthy reference disc in your video library.<br /><br />Recommended for the picture and sound quality but perhaps the content could have been a little better.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HVL790PBWYTU.html">A2HVL790PBWYTU</a><br/><p>Isaac Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics having become so ingrained in popular culture, fellow nerds can probably recite them with greater facility than the pledge of allegiance (which is actually sort of sad). I, ROBOT is a loose, roundabout film adaptation of Asimov's work. While it does explore Asimov's more cerebral themes, it emphasizes action and suspense and is tailored towards Will Smith's skills set. So I wouldn't say that it clings firmly to the spirit of Asimov's novels. But, setting that aside, I had fun watching this. Will Smith rarely disappoints.<br /><br />"Ever since the first computers, there have always been ghosts in the machine, random segments of code that have grouped together to form unexpected protocols." So goes James Cromwell's voiceover, establishing a plot thread, engaging in moody foreshadowing. In the year 2035, in a world populated by safe robotic servants, Chicago Homicide Detective Del Spooner investigates the suicide of eminent scientist Dr. Alfred Lanning (James Cromwell), co-founder and primary designer of U.S. Robotics. Except that to Spooner's trained eye, the suicide theory comes off as skeevy, much to everyone else's disgust. But there's a connection between Spooner and the dead scientist which we eventually learn. Spooner believes that Lanning has deliberately left a trail of bread crumbs for him to follow. Spooner smells a conspiracy. Except that no one's buying his hunch, not when his robot paranoia is so apparent. An early scene demonstrates Spooner's deep-seated prejudices against automatons. In this scene he glimpses a robot loping along with a purse and he instantly sets out in pursuit, assuming (falsely) that the robot was guilty of purse-snatching. Never mind that, historically, no crimes have ever been perpetrated by a robot. The 3 Laws Safe, hardwired into its positronic brain, have always governed a robot's behavior, curbed any and all potentially harmful act.<br /><br />Spooner's digging for clues in the towering U.S. Robotics facility leads him to encounters with various characters of note. Bruce Greenwood plays a shady executive at U.S. Robotics, and, yes, he immediately registers on Spooner's radar. Greenwood is pushing to mobilize the corporation's latest robot model, the NS-5, seeking to place one in every home. The detached and very literal Dr. Susan Calvin (Bridget Moynahan) is, ironically, a robot psychologist. She specializes in facilitating the interface between humans and robots. She strives to make the robots seem more human. Spooner has loads of fun tweaking her. Spooner also meets two non-humans: VIKI (Virtual Interactive Kinetic Intelligence), the A.I. who runs operations at U.S. Robotics. And Sonny the prototype NS-5 model. Sonny is strikingly different from its fellow robots. As voiced by Alan Tudyk, Sonny projects an inquisitiveness and an appealing sense of individuality. But its suspicious conduct plants him square on top of Spooner's suspect list, and never mind Asimov's Three Robotic Laws. It turns out, there are ghosts in the machine.<br /><br />The closing credits indicate that the film was "suggested" by Isaac Asimov's anthology book, and "suggested" is right. By no means does I, ROBOT adhere to Asimov's stories. This is a sci-fi thriller with elements of a whodunit, and it's enjoyable on that level. The visual effects are spectacular. Will Smith, one of Hollywood's true superstars, works his Will Smith magic, his charm and accessibility on full blast. But his greatest strength may be his ability to humanize his characters. In fact, Del Spooner seems to be one of only two characters here invested with a telling emotional trajectory and with character growth (the other is Sonny). Smith is also equally adept at playing action hero. This is something you can't consistently say about Shia LaBoeuf who has a supporting bit here as a completely irrelevant teen pal of Spooner's. LaBoeuf's presence helps to dumb down the movie. I sort of wish he was exempt from the Three Laws of Robotics. I meant the character he plays here, of course...</p></br><a href="../users/A370Z6I5GBWU44.html">A370Z6I5GBWU44</a><br/><p>I haven't read the book that this movie was based off, so I have nothing to compare it with. Will Smith does a decent job as the protagonist, and the story is interesting and will keep you on your toes - who really killed the doctor? The answer may surprise you if you've not read the book. All in all a good movie, rent before you decide to buy it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8.html">A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8</a><br/><p>"I, Robot is very well done science fiction entertainment.  The story is roughly based upon the great Isaac Asimov's robot stories, particularly "Robot Dreams" which was one of his last robot stories.  This one is set in the 2030s.  Robots are well-accepted components of society, and humans are growing increasingly dependent upon them.  "US Robots" is a huge and powerful company that manufactures the robots.<br /><br />US Robots is about to release a much more intelligent and powerful robot model.  Detective Del Spooner (Wil Smith, from Independence Day) has reason to doubt the safety of the new robots, and it turns out he has a point.  More would be telling.<br /><br />This one is faithful to Isaac Asimov's vision of robots integrated into human society, and the effects that this might have.  The special effects are terrific, and the robots are believable and realistic.  The story, while somewhat over the top, is nonetheless engaging and fast-paced.  Next, I would like to see a movie made of Asimov's Elijah Bailey series of novels, which is also part of the "Robot" series.  This movie proves that this would be practical.<br /><br />Recommended.  RJB.</p></br><a href="../users/A1OYW08VVPMP3Q.html">A1OYW08VVPMP3Q</a><br/><p>Loosely based upon Isaac Asimov's story, Will Smith's I, Robot is good. I rarely have anything good to say about such adaptations but this detective story set in a future in which robots are commonplace is well-done and gripping. Although I think the key plotline of following "breadcrumbs," or deliberately set clues, could have been done better the special effects are for the most part impressive and believable. The acting was good and I was pleased to watch it.</p></br><a href="../users/A13D1WTFEMS9VH.html">A13D1WTFEMS9VH</a><br/><p>After reading some of the professional reviews and user reviews here, I am, frankly, shocked. This was a wonderfully entertaining movie that was very well done technically. The Blu-Ray presentation is fantastic. Unlike many others, I wasn't comparing it to what Asimov wrote, mainly because I am unfamiliar with his works. But in any case that's a pointless exercise and I reject movie reviews that are hung up in comparing written works to film.<br /><br />The question here should be strictly this: Did I like this film as a stand-alone work? Yes. Was it well made? Yes. Were the actors good in their roles? Yes. And, yes, I like Will Smith. No, he's not Richard Burton, but who better to cast in a film where robots have been unquestioningly integrated into a futuristic urban society than a hip, throwback, wise-cracking black guy from Philly? I also think Bridget Moynahan did a very nice job.<br /><br />So, the film is technically very good, the plot interesting, and the actors quite competent in their roles. If you want to see something deep and intellectually stimulating, look elsewhere. If you simply want to have fun and be entertained, watch 'I, Robot'.</p></br></body></html>

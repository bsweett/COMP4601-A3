It is as if they are watching another movie entirely. It's as if they were watching the leaden Charlie's Angels sequel Full Throttle.<br /><br />The first Angels however is a great movie if you keep three things in mind. It is mindless. It is fun. It is mindless fun. Never has eye candy had so many empty calories. As nutritious for your brain as a deep-fried Twinkie and with about as much substance, Charlie's Angels is about as quintessential a summer movie as you can get.<br /><br />This is not a bad thing. With a great soundtrack, three hot girls, solid supporting cast and non-stop action even brainless fun can be' well good. It is not easy to make a film this shallow, this entertaining. (As the sequel proved and come to think of it dozens of movies prove every summer.) In reality there is a fine line between fluffy, bubble headed, featherbrained fun and feeble-minded, half-witted, imbecilic drudgery.<br /><br />Charlie's Angels stays solidly on the featherbrained, fluffy side. It is that rather rare film that is smart enough to keep it simple and needless to say mindlessly fun.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L43KWWR05PCS.html">A1L43KWWR05PCS</a><br/><p>This is a funny, well executed spoof of the popular nineteen seventies series by the same name.

The film is all mission and martial arts, so this film is great for anyone who likes that sort. It as improved alot to the older version, i watched half an hour of one once on the tele and it is boring. Comparing this to it is much better, it is a different scenery and it is great for anyone who likes lucy liu cameron diaz, and drew barrymore. I like drew barrymore, she is the best angel out of the three. Not because she is my favorite actress cos shes greatttt! the film itself subscribes how it sees on the box. A FAMILY MISSION MARTIAL ARTS FILM THAT IS GREAT FOR MOST PEOPLE.</p></br><a href="../users/A3IDMLOWLHWNDJ.html">A3IDMLOWLHWNDJ</a><br/><p>The first big screen outing for Charlie and his Angels is girlpower driven entertainment at its most fun.<br /> <p>  The Angels are assigned to watch over a computer geek who has designed a special computer defense program that can, if fallen into the wrong hands, cause major havok among the world population. However, the geek is actually an undercover operative who holds a secret grudge against Charlie (he holds Charlie responsible for his father's death in Vietnam) and tries to due away with Charlie and trying to make real angels out of the Angels. <p>  The film doesn't take itself to seriously (come on people, its based on a T&amp;A show from the 70's!). The casting of Barrymore, Liu, and Diaz is admirable. Some guys I talked to about the film didn't acutally like the girls, but, I always say if it's 2 in the morning and these girls show up at your front door asking to use the phone because of car problems, I wouldn't slam the door in there faces! Bill Murray gets quite a few laughs as Bosley and Sam Rockwell is great as the villian. The soundtrack is pretty good, mixing different tunes from the past few decades. Overall, a decent and enjoyable rental.</p></br><a href="../users/A19V0VJMKKRMC8.html">A19V0VJMKKRMC8</a><br/><p>i loved this movie. i can;t wait to see full throttle.</p></br><a href="../users/AO4J90YPX5RU6.html">AO4J90YPX5RU6</a><br/><p>DREW, CAMERON, & LUCY..

I enjoyed every frame of it and I applaud Drew Barrymore for getting the ball rolling. If you didn't know Drew Barrymore was the Executive Producer of this film and she is also helming the sequel with all three returning! Yahooo!<p>This face paced, special effects ridden, technically advanced design, free-spirited rock'n'roll adventure is filled with humor and energy that left me bouncing my seat. Directed by MTV music video director McG (short for Joseph McGinty Nichol) the film is magic potpourri of fun and adventure. McG is also in pre-production of Charlie's Angeles's 2 as this review goes into writing.<p>How could you go wrong with a cast like Drew, Cameron Diaz and Lucy Liu teamed up with Bill Murray as Bosley and the original voice of Charlie from the TV show - John Forsythe. You have the perfect villain (you think) like Tim Curry and other nasties really well played by Sam Rockwell, Kelly Lynch and Crispin Glover (George McFly from the Back To The Future movies.) It's got everything and is a lot of fun!<p>The story is simple - in amiss-directed ply Charlie's Angles are guided to a wrong goal for the wrong purpose only to find themselves trapped and control and almost...well let's just say the way they get out of everything is fun, fantastic and very much sur-real Matrix like.<p>The DVD extras are very cool. Music videos, deleted scenes, bloopers, extended scenes and the commentary is hysterical to listen to. There are stills and lots of behind the scenes interviews that give you another inside into film making from props, costumes, stunts and special effects. Drew and the girls must have had a great time making this one because I had fun watching it. Hats off to you Drew! Get this DVD!

You got awesome Matrix style action, a lot of funny moments and cool villains. Crispen Glover (Back To The Future) as the lead Henchman the Thin Man kicks major Angel butt. I can't picture their being a sequel without him he was so cool. Sam Rockwell (Galaxy Quest, The Green Mile) and Kelly Lynch make cool baddies as well. It's Cameron Diaz that steals the show, though, with her underwear dance, one word describes that part: "WOW." She has the funniest lines in the movie, she delivers them great too. She's just hilarious in this movie. <p>The only problem I had with the film was that it didn't need all the big names in small roles. Tom Green doesn't really fit in the movie as......CHAD, the guy who likes to say his own name. You got Matt LeBlanc as Lucy Liu's boyfriend too. Matt is basically just playing his part Joey from (Friends) and it doesn't really work. L.L Cool J has a small cameo in the beginning as the guy Drew is disguised as, which doesn't work that well either. Luke Wilson (Blue Streak, Home Fries) as Cameron Diaz's love interest is pretty funny though too bad the movie doesn't come through at actually putting those two together . <p>Some of the action is cartoonish but still a lot of fun at the time because none of the actors take what they're doing seriously. Charlie's Angels can best be described as True Lies with action like the Matrix. I highly recommend it, for those of you that think it looks dumb, check it out anyway because you might like it...I did. OK, now all we need is Magnum: The Movie and we'll all be happy, lol.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CZICCYP2M5PX.html">A1CZICCYP2M5PX</a><br/><p>Three Attractive Undercover Operatives (Drew Barrymore, Cameron Diaz, Lucy Liu) are in a Mission to Capture and Stop an Missing Device that Could Knowing, where Everyone Could Live into the Entire World ending Privacy by the Help of a Sateille in Space.<p>Directed by McG (Real Name by Joseph McGinty Nichol) brings a stylish action film filled with Comedy, thanks by a Talented Cast and it`s also Playful Fun of this Big-Screen Adapation of the Notorious TV Series.

Fighting, humor, innuendo, gadgets, and plenty of cleavage--it has it all!  <p>Cameron Diaz is a joy as the childlike Natalie, while Lucy Liu's Alex is all knuckles and know-how.  Drew Barrymore is Drew through and through--sexy, streetwise, and sweet.  Bill Murray is wasted, however, as Bosley; his character is all fatherly advice, costume changes, and pratfalls.  <p>With high-kicking Hong Kong style action and great visuals, if you are looking for a fun flick to pass a Saturday night, don't pass over this one.  It's a best bet.</p></br><a href="../users/A31I3HXMD5H1EL.html">A31I3HXMD5H1EL</a><br/><p>As much a tribute to pop culture as a big-screen version of the '70s<br />series, 'Charlie's Angels' has so much energy and tongue-in-cheek<br />charm that it DARES you NOT to root for its three young stars! And<br />while the film won't erase the images of Farrah Fawcett in a thin<br />tanktop on a very cold day, there is a wholesome sexiness and<br />accessiblity in Barrymore, Diaz, and Liu that none of the various<br />teamings of TV 'Angels' ever achieved!  <p>The pre-title sequence is<br />outrageous, and fabulous! ...  <p>Each Angel has a unique<br />backstory...Natalie (Diaz) is an ditzy, upbeat 'Soul Train'-dancing<br />wannabe who 'shakes her booty' at home in Spider-Man undies, looks for<br />'Mr. Right', and is a crack driver; Alex (Liu) is a 'leg waxer'/extra<br />on an action movie set, who is a lousy cook, sleeps with the film's<br />star (Matt LeBlanc, in a funny cameo), and is an expert in technology<br />and martial arts; Dylan (Barrymore) is an ex-high school 'bad<br />girl'/free spirit involved with a seedy, insecure hippie living in a<br />tugboat (humorously portrayed by Tom Green, Barrymore's real-life<br />boyfriend), is a master of disguise, and leads the trio. <p>As in the<br />TV series, the Angels work out of the Townsend Detective Agency (still<br />located in the famous colonial brick building), and communicate with<br />the never-seen Charlie (voiced, as always, by John Forsythe) via the<br />telephone. As the trio's liason, Bosley, Bill Murray is simply<br />perfect, hilarious in his patented 'smarmy but lovable' persona!<br /><p>The plot revolves around the kidnapping of a Bill Gates-type<br />computer genius (Sam Rockwell, 'The Green Mile'), and a technology<br />that can pinpoint any person's location, anywhere in the world. The<br />prime suspects are competitor Roger Corwin (Tim Curry, in a<br />delightfully wicked turn!), and his hitman, portrayed with kinky<br />relish by Crispin Glover. Hired by Kelly Lynch (who has a ball in the<br />role of Rockwell's partner!), the Angels embark on a case with all the<br />twists, betrayals, action, humor, and mayhem that a fan could ask for!<br /><p>Loud, good-natured, and pulsating with a soundtrack of '70s-'80s<br />Top Ten songs, the film combines 'Matrix'-style freeze-frames and<br />slow-motion FX with a ton of Pop Culture references and a<br />swashbuckling sense of derring-do! The film literally rocks, and never<br />lets up! <p>Is this 'Great Cinema'? Certainly not! But in its sheer<br />audacity, and sense of fun, no recent film can match it! And while the<br />original series teased with a visual sex appeal that was was largely<br />ignored in the storylines, the big-screen version has a 'if you got<br />it, flaunt it' attitude that is both refreshing and empowering! This<br />is a 'Girl Power' movie, in the BEST sense of the word! <p>I HIGHLY<br />recommend it!</p></br><a href="../users/A1J2931UBBJPXM.html">A1J2931UBBJPXM</a><br/><p>In the history of the cinema, most feature films that are the progeny of a successful television series have been less than satisfying or able to capture the essence of the original.  There are exceptions, of course, and "Charlie's Angels," directed by McG (Joseph McGinty Mitchell), and starring Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore and Lucy Liu, is one of them.  A great movie it is not, but it is fun, the trio of Angels are engaging, and it is non-stop action from beginning to end.  It starts with a dynamic skydiving stunt and never slows down.  Along the way a lot of things blow up, there's music,dancing, plenty of stunts, some clever lines and a bit of comedy relief from Bill Murray (Bosley).  There's just enough plot to keep things interesting, but it really doesn't make much difference; this is like a party to which everyone's been invited, and Angels Natalie (Diaz), Dylan (Barrymore) and Alex (Liu) are everything their T.V. counterparts ever hoped to be and more.  This is the way Charlie's team was meant to be.  What really puts this movie over, though, is the Angels themselves; there's a natural camaraderie between them that seems sincere and never forced, and they all seem to be having a great time, especially the charismatic Diaz, who could easily win an Oscar for Best Supporting Smile.  Barrymore looks good and exhibits plenty of spunk, as does Liu, who has a captivating screen presence as well.  It's all played pretty much straightforward, there's no attempt at parody or heavy drama, and nothing is taken too seriously, which enables the story to move along without getting bogged down with any unnecessary business.  Murray is used just enough to make his presence welcome and effective, and he makes his Bosley fit nicely alongside this latest incarnation of Angels.  The action sequences are well done and the choreography (by Cheung-Yan Yuen) is exciting; the influences of John Woo and "The Matrix" are obvious, and the less experienced McG was wise to draw from the best, for it adds to the success of his film.  There's something of the James Bond films in here, and "Mission Impossible 2" (of course), but to McG's credit, it mainly plays like an extended, more detailed version of the original series.  The supporting cast includes Tim Curry (Roger Corwin), the versatile Sam Rockwell (Knox), Kelly Lynch (Vivian Wood), Tom Green (Chad) and, in smaller but effective roles, Matt LeBlanc, Luke Wilson, and Crispin Glover.  The familiar voice of Charlie is once again supplied by the man who created the original, John Forsythe.  There's so much energy in this movie you get the feeling that the Angels must have always started their day's work with a triple from Starbucks; it's a high voltage romp that's upbeat and filled with fun and positive vibes.  In the end, "Charlie's Angels" is an entertaining, feel-good  movie that should satisfy a new, younger audience, as well as those with fond memories of the show that started it all a generation ago.</p></br><a href="../users/ACMOLKXVKQ06Z.html">ACMOLKXVKQ06Z</a><br/><p>This movie is a good example that a movie does not always have to be deep and have an excellent plot to still be fun.  I appreciate deep films with deep characters and good writing, this film has none of those.  However, I can't say for one minute that I was not entertained.  This movie blew me away, the sound was literally a blast, and the visuals were a treat.  It is easy to tell that the director has directed many music videos.<p>You will not like this film if you are turned off by shallow stories and mindless action.  It also is an insult to anyone serious about martial arts.  If you like cheap thrills and want to have fun, I highly reccomend it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NSMQIF1C2VCE.html">A1NSMQIF1C2VCE</a><br/><p>My wife (who doesn't remember the original show) and I went into the movie with zero expectations and found ourselves having an absolute ball. The film is funny, self-aware and great fun. Any film that includes the line &quot;for god's sake, FLIP YOUR HAIR!&quot; isn't one that takes itself too seriously, even for a moment.<p>Add to that teriffic Hong Kong action-movie sequences -- See Cameron Diaz question a thug with her foot! See the Angels take on a sword-cane wielding and high-flipping Crispin Glover! -- and the film got a well-deserved round of applause from a packed theater in very jaded Los Angeles.<p>This isn't the film for those who prefer their action grim or their female heroines desexualized -- the Angels go from kicking the crap out of bad guys to checking out hot guys in zero-to-60 flat -- but for those looking for some light movie fare served at rocket speed, &quot;Charlie's Angels&quot; is the way to go.<p>The Angels out-Bond every James Bond movie without Sean Connery, and as we left the theater, my wife and I agreed that we would be getting the DVD ...</p></br><a href="../users/AM2PV53UX1JEQ.html">AM2PV53UX1JEQ</a><br/><p>Drew Barrymore, Lucy Lu and especially Cameron Diaz are terrifically entertaining as the newest Angels in this amusing, well-made big-screen take on the classic TV series.  Though Bill Murray has little chance to use his comic gifts, mostly everything else about this high-octane caper is entertaining and self-consciously bigger-than-life.  The Angels are each given a human side, from the get-go -- this is a clever throughline, making these women memorable and distinct.  They seem to be having a ball together, and showing off some impressive, athletic kung-fu kicks, twsits and turns. There is an air of self-deprecation (Diaz dancing; Lucy cooking; Drew's boyfriend) that adds a sweet, funny undercurrent to the Matrix-like action sequences, which show plenty of skin and outfits.  The sexiness comes across a both a weapon and as a celebration.  The movie seems to bear the overall stamp of Drew Barrymore's professional persona: generous with its cast, fun-loving, empowered and distinctly feminine.  It's a surprisingly good time for all.</p></br><a href="../users/A2T7TZBOTP68C7.html">A2T7TZBOTP68C7</a><br/><p>In 2000, media rumblings had Charlie's Angels: the Movie set to tank like Waterworld.  Reports of Bill Murray and Lucy Liu refusing to work with each other, rapidly inflating budget, and former angels declining cameos had many folks apprehensive about the film's success.  But the finished product was refreshing and worth waiting for.  Ironically, in persevering with the film,<br /> the three young stars and co-producers, Drew Barrymore, Cameron Diaz, and Liu followed the Angels' creed of never giving up and believing in yourself.<p>From the familiar opening strains of the TV show's music to the end, the movie remains true to the original series, yet is modern and updated.  Barry is cute, Liu is tough, and Diaz simply dazzles.  Lots of humor and action make this film a must-see.  There is one especially hilarious scene that makes fun of engineers.  Two of the angels dress up as men, and Liu dons a black leather miniskirt to distract the men.  It works very well as the engineers are all falling out of their seats and looking at her in awe as she works the "dominatrix" role.  <p>And it is great to have John Forsythe back as the voice of Charlie.  At least he was a good sport about it; a true gentleman like Charlie!</p></br><a href="../users/A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ.html">A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ</a><br/><p>I have always been a fan of Charlie's Angels, and I absolutely adore Drew Barrymore, but this movie is horrible.  I don't know how else to put it.  The script is inane, the acting is not very good, the dialogue is forced, some of the special effects don't seem very special to me, and the overall effect is that of a destructive parody of a TV show I hold in high nostalgic regard.  This story would not have been acceptable for the dismal final season of the TV series.  There's one decent twist to it, but the overall objective of the bad guys and the plan they hatch to achieve that end is fantastically ludicrous.  I can't half blame the actors and actresses for speaking their lines without feeling, often mechanically switching emotions at the drop of an invisible dime, because most of what they had to say was just plain silly.  The acting seems to be so forced at times that it looks to me like these actresses are not enjoying what they are doing at all.  The Angels I know and love would not forget their entire mission every time one of them saw a cute guy, nor would they engage in phone conversations in the middle of intense action.  I also can't for the life of me figure out why they kept the character of Bosley in this film.  David Doyle must be turning over in his grave in reaction to Bill Murray's portrayal of Bosley as a totally inept, helpless, unbelievably silly character.  The Bosley of old was no Superman, but this Bosley can barely add two and two.  And the infamous "Thin Man" is like some Hollywood 1930s character actor reject whose mannerisms are so exaggerated that I expected him to break his own arm just trying to light a cigarette.  Worst of all, however, was the inclusion of Tom Greene at his most annoying for two scenes as "the Chad."  <p>What about the special effects?  Even this part of the movie was ruined for me because the filmmakers tried to make all of the action look like what we saw in The Matrix.  Every good scene seems to be cursed with slow-motion visuals of impossible jumps, kicks, and other moves, followed up by the girls striking unnecessary martial arts poses.  There is one scene in particular, featuring Drew, that takes the special effects way too far without bothering to give us a clue as to how what happens actually happens.  I appreciate the hard work and training that Barrymore, Liu, and Diaz went through to prepare for their roles, but the whole thing came off as ridiculous in my eyes.  I have to mention the music here too.  I love the old vintage Angels theme, but in a couple of places I heard music that was obviously stolen from James Bond and, of all things, Godzilla.  Why?<p>I hate to be so tough on a movie I thought I would like, and I especially hate to criticize one of my favorite actresses in Drew Barrymore, but I have to be truthful here.  There are some explosions, which are nice, and that alone keeps me from giving this the dreaded one star, but I cannot possibly give it more than two stars, even taking into account all of the extras you get on the DVD.  To some degree, Charlie's Angels was a real breakthrough of sorts in the 1970s, showing that women can be just as smart and effective at catching bad guys as men; this movie betrays the empowering spirit of the original series, and I think that is rather a sad thing.</p></br><a href="../users/A9Q28YTLYREO7.html">A9Q28YTLYREO7</a><br/><p>Horrible! Charlie's Angels made Pop Culture from within not the other way around.this is like a Bad USA Network Film on the Weekend at 2 in the Morning.bad acting&tired cliched Matrix type effects.one of those Movies that it was so bad you laughed at all the wrong parts.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TK6R2JSC97HL.html">A1TK6R2JSC97HL</a><br/><p>A rich computer genius - the inventor of a revolutionary new voice recognition technology - has been kidnapped, and somebody's responsible! Who can ya call! (cue the music). With nowhere else to turn, the genius's beautiful partner calls on the famed Charles Townsend Detective Agency, whose business end is managed by three beautiful, tough and resourceful ladies who once...well, we never find out what they once were, but that doesn't matter since there appears little if anything they can't do.  Of course they're not as mysterious as the identity of the reclusive Charles Townsend, but they get more high-energy action here.  (Personally, I think he may be linked to the shadowy Blake Carrington, but that's just my theory.)<br /><br />Each Angel epitomizes this differently - with Alex (Lucy Liu) being the most resourceful, Dylan (Drew Barrymore) as a tomboy who can fight off a quintet of baddies while tied to a chair (in a scene that riffs on a drugged and chair-bound Schwarzenegger's telling his captors exactly how he'll escape from his cuffs and what he'll do when he's out in "True Lies") and Natalie (Cameron Diaz) who won't let an epic judo-death match get in the way of snagging a date. Director McG knows that TV franchises haven't been doing that well on the screen (anybody catch "Mod Squad"?) so he turns the film into a cross between an extended music video, a parody of action movies and a barb aimed at the idea of taking TV to the big screen. (The film opens on an airplane where 1st class passengers are forced to watch "TJ Hooker, the Movie"). The  strategy works mostly because of the power brought by the stars who know when to team up and when to grab the spotlight. With plenty of matrix-style fight scenes, every fight seems to bend the laws of gravity. The film also works on the strength of the co-stars - Bill Murray bringing his deadpan shtick to Bosley, but also Tom Green as Dylan's semi-psychotic boyfriend, Matt LeBlanc doing his Friends routine as a low-wage actor in bad movies, but also Crispin Glover as the psychotically silent android-like killer who enforces for the bad guys. If you need a reason to suspend your belief, if only for 2 hours, grab the Angels, and press "Play".</p></br><a href="../users/AOVJYIUATQKR5.html">AOVJYIUATQKR5</a><br/><p>Yes.

Like Buckaroo Banzai, who was simultaneously a rock star, surgeon, scientist, and super adventurer, the three Angels in this film are all improbably talented.  By the end, they all started reminding me of Barbie dolls, and all about as convincing as a Barbie doll in each incarnation.  We get Kung Fun Barbie Doll followed by Computer Nerd Barbie Doll to be followed by Race Car Driver Barbie Doll.  At no point are any of the girls the tiniest bit convincing in their rolls.  In this regard, the film is as ridiculous as the original TV show, which despite being a hit was, in my mind, one of the worst shows ever.  The difference between the two shows, and what makes this film fun instead of awful, is the fact that the movie clearly intends all of this tongue in cheek, as a long, silly joke.<p>The problem with the movie is that while a self-parody is always fun, it isn't always a great self-parody.  Too many scenes are intended as a joke at the girls' expense, but it isn't developed with any wit or charm or skill.  That doesn't mean the film isn't slick; it is.  But as a whole the film doesn't live up to its own expectations.  There just isn't much depth or purpose, except to show three impossibly talented and beautiful women you simply can't accept as being that talented (though the beautiful part is easy).<p>The girls are well cast.  I always find Drew Barrymore to be adorable.  Cameron Diaz is fun, and is extremely convincing physically in her stunts.  She is not, however, at all convincing as a guy-shy female.  Lucy Liu provides good visual and ethnic contrast to the other two, but I don't like the bitchiness of her character, and while I completely applaud using an Asian actress in a major role, I just find her an almost completely unlikable actress, and her semi-dominatrix aura gets very, very old very, very quickly.  Undoubtedly this is because I have read too much about her in media gossip rags.  I have read that Thandie Newton originally was tagged for the role, and I wish that had happened.  <p>In the end, the film just doesn't quite gel, but because it doesn't take itself too seriously, it manages to be fun anyway.  This is one of those films that's great to watch on a Saturday night with a bunch of friends, when you can simultaneously enjoy and laugh at what's happening.  Laughing is OK; the makers of the film expect you to.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZTSOBAPOWT3.html">A1ZTSOBAPOWT3</a><br/><p>But are these girls real angels? Look at Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore and Lucy Liu. Decide for yourself... They are secret agents working for an unknown man named Charlie and their new mission has to do with a computer programmer whose been kidnapped. The guy is a complete dork. There's also a tall, skinny guy who likes to smell hair and you know he had an obsession with Barbies. One of the girls eats a lot and orders way too much at a drive-thru. One can't dance or sing (Soul Train has a bad reputation now because of this girl). One can't cook muffins, which are deadly and can sit as a rock in your stomach, literally. Yet, they're all supposed to be 'angels.' Even at the beginning, an 'angel' was disguised as LL Cool J. Can you imagine that? The movie is deranged. They even threw in Bill Murray for some reason. Oh well, it's just entertainment.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JJOV69MAU2J2.html">A1JJOV69MAU2J2</a><br/><p>Charlie's Angels never pretends to be anything but what it is -- an extended music video montage of highly stylized scenes, sexiness and feminine butt-kicking fun. <p>People looking for serious acting, dialogue, or a plot that makes sense need not attend. <p>Enjoy it for what it is. A popcorn movie that doesn't suck.<p>BTW, the DVD is absolutely packed full of extras, despite only coming on one DVD. (That's because the movie is just 90 minutes, so they have plenty of room for extras on the clothing, special effects, the goofy director, the music videos, three deleted scenes, et al).</p></br><a href="../users/AZ5250G2U795I.html">AZ5250G2U795I</a><br/><p>Shakespeare...uh...NO.  90 minutes of pure fun...You BETCHA!<p>I saw this movie in the theaters and the first thought I had was 'When is the DVD coming out?  I GOTTA HAVE THIS MOVIE!'  Drew, Cameron, and Lucy have perfectly embodied the old angle archetype in a 21st century way.  Hard to describe, but watch the movie and you'll know what I'm talking about.  And whoever snagged Bill Murray as Bosley is a Casting Director's Casting Director!<p>If you want sheer fun, not a serious amount of plot (And don't worry, the movie knows it's not gunning for a best picture story or anything), and GREAT fight scenes, then click right now!</p></br><a href="../users/A35YWA2V4QHOJ3.html">A35YWA2V4QHOJ3</a><br/><p>I never cared for the original series way back in the 70s.  It had beautiful women, such as Farrah Fawcett, Jacqueline Smith and Tanya Roberts, but also had some nasty anti-male undercurrents.  This 2000 rendition, instead of being anti-male, is pro-fun.<p>It takes all of 2 minutes into this movie to figure out that it doesn't take itself too seriously.  In fact, it is a borderline spoof of the 70s series, even making fun of itself at times.  There are also some scenes which make fun of stuff from the 70s, such as Disco and Soul Train.<p>This movie is absurd, but it's a fun kind of absurd.  It does not try to convince otherwise.  Following in the footsteps of &quot;Xena:  Warrior Princess,&quot; this film is action packed, sexy and highly entertaining.  On the casting side, Drew Barrymore is a bit of a reach, but Cameron Diaz and Lucy Liu are marvelous.  This is a great flick for those who liked the 70s TV show, and probably an even more enjoyable movie for those who didn't.</p></br><a href="../users/AUTBHG6070SL4.html">AUTBHG6070SL4</a><br/><p>First of all, the Angels have great babe appeal. That's pretty much what the movie is about: watching pretty women do stuff. That's enough for any teenage boy (or for anyone who once was a teenage boy). Mostly, the pretty women do stuff with their clothes on, which should keep mothers of teenage boys reasonably happy.<p>The action is good, the fights are nicely choreographed, the wire-work is outstanding, and the effects don't take over from the very capable actresses. The plot won't be an intellectual challenge for anyone over about age nine, but that's fine. <p>It's just an action movie with pretty women. That's all. If that sounds good, you'll love it. If not, you probably wouldn't have read this far.</p></br><a href="../users/A2WE94927YC3KI.html">A2WE94927YC3KI</a><br/><p>This movie is nice.

You were a major fan of the TV show. 2.  You love stop-action fight sequences. 3.  You are a fan of Diaz, Liu, or Barrymore.<p>Otherwise, this movie is only average.  Good for a rent.  Somewhat entertaining.</p></br><a href="../users/A3CWH6VKCTJAD.html">A3CWH6VKCTJAD</a><br/><p>Action adventure has probably never been this much fun.  This comedy sendup of the 1970's TV series has a plot as flimsy as Cameron Diaz's outfits, but who cares!  It gives us inane comedy interwoven with serious action, making it wonderfully mindless entertainment.<p>From a technical standpoint, the film is first rate.  First time feature director Joseph McGinty Mitchell (McG) who has won numerous awards for music and commercial videos seems unfazed by this gargantuan project ($92 million budget).  Though the film is done in a hodgepodge of styles (a hallmark of video directors), each is extremely well done, using locations, color and sets imaginatively and effectively.  The pace, like McG himself, is like a frenetic roller coaster ride and the humor generally works.<p>Probably the most impressive elements of the film are the fighting scenes.  Diaz, Barrymore and Liu all trained tirelessly on the wire to produce fabulously athletic fighting scenes that look authentic.  The editing of these scenes is outstanding and when you see them, it seems that Cameron Diaz really can jump eight feet in the air, travel ten yards and kick her foe in the face three times!  There is an excellent behind-the-scenes feature on the DVD that shows how this was done.  This is only one of the many special features on this loaded DVD.  In addition, the DTS sound on the DVD is outstanding and explosive.<p>The acting; well there is not a lot of serious acting going on here.  It is all very tongue in cheek and all three angels handle their roles with an excellent combination of sarcastic humor and sexiness.  Bill Murray is great as the twenty-first century Bosley.  Kelly Lynch is also delectably evil as Vivian rendering some good fight scenes herself.<p>This film is a real crowd pleaser.  I rated it an 8/10.  It has terrific production values, great action, amusing humor and a killer cast.  With all this, who needs a story?</p></br><a href="../users/AK2AQIULQDFS5.html">AK2AQIULQDFS5</a><br/><p>"Charlies Angels" is the most Shamelessly Fun Hour and a Half you'll Ever have. Some (the Majority) will take it with a Smile and be Entertained; others (the Minority) will take it with an "Oooookay" and be Ashamed. Either way you Take it, Everyone has to admit that it is a Gutsy, Full On Adrenaline Rush that Keeps on Keeping on.<p>This "Girl Power" flick had Big, Sticking Bomb written All over it. There were rumours of on-set Squabbles, Over-Budgeting and Script Re-write after Script Re-write. It also featured a First-time Director known only as Mc G and the Overall Tone seemed like it was aiming for "The Avengers" or "The Mod Squad" style Shenanigans, which would have been a Very Bad Idea as those two films were Appallingly Bad. I have to admit, I expected to Hate "Charlies Angels". But on Release day, the Good Reviews absolutely Flooded the Media and I gave it a chance, and Boy am I Glad that I Did.<p>Drew, Cameron and Lucy are Roll Models for the Girls and Drool Inducers for the Boys, There Performances were the Key to the films Success, they are Ultra-Likeable and that was Definitely Necessary. It is also Great to see Bill Murray in a Funny/Silly role again like the ones he Inhabited in a lot of Ivan Reitman films. After "Rushmore" and "Hamlet", I didn't think he'd be Doing any more Out and Out Comic Roles. (The same goes for Tim Curry, he doesn't do enough these days either)<p>The Matrix-ish Fight Sequences, the Awesome Special Effects, the Beautiful Stars, the Great Supporting Cast (which includes Sam Rockwell and Kelly Lynch), the Hysterical Cameos (Tom Green is Side-Splittingly Funny while Matt Le Blanc plays it pretty straight, which he does quite well. Luke Wilson is Sickly-Sweet, in a Good way, and he suits Diaz to a Tee) and the Well-Timed Hair Tossing all combine to make "Charlie's Angels" Pure 5-Star Entertainment.</p></br><a href="../users/A1B05INWIDZ74O.html">A1B05INWIDZ74O</a><br/><p>We are all familiar with the TV series.... The movie is better than the show. It has a believable plot and all the girls seem to work well together, instead of just jiggle (Though it is here). There is a lot of action in this movie.

The girls are a great team with their different personalities and expertises. The special effects are awesome (especially the alley fight scene) and the bonus features were cool to show the effects broke down. The plot kept me interested and didn't drag out and become ridiculous like some tend to do. The cast was great, the girls and Bill Murray especially. I could watch it again and again!</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>This was extremely cheery, bright, action packed, and gives you an adrenaline rush. But the film seemed to fall flat on its face a lot of the time, and inbetween the high octane action stuff, it was very dull.<p>If you're thinking there are similarities between this and The Matrix, you'd be right. It's the same guy who choreographed The Matrix fight scenes, who did this as well. I also saw similarities between this & Mission Impossible. There is probably a lot more similarities, but there's always one film 'borrowing' off another these days - I'm just beginning to notice it more and more.<p>OK, so this film is showing that girls can kick some butt when they want to, and can be "independant women" and not have to rely on guys to do their dirty work for them. So how come Cameron Diaz's character goes all gooey, whenever that guy she met at the bar phones?! That's being independant alright.<p>Three minutes into the film, I spotted a major flaw. Maybe it was just me, but I thought if you opened the doors on a plane and jumped out (which of course, everyone has done at least once), everyone else on the plane got sucked out after you? I'm basing this after seeing Final Destination too many times.<p>Who's your favourite Angel? Personally I couldn't stand Cameron Diaz or Lucy Liu. Cameron is normally so great in a lot of the roles I've seen her in, but in this, she played up the dizzy blonde act a little too much. Drew Barrymore is the greatest Angel, and had the pizzazz to keep the film going, and keep the viewer watching. And she seemed the least fake out of the three.<p>I'm hoping the second film will be better. This movie was fun to watch, don't get me wrong, just could have been better. There are a lot of gratuitous shots of the girls, mainly for the guys, but it gets a bit tiresome after a while for the girls watching! There's only so many times you can bitch about someone with Drew Barrymore's assets not having any support!</p></br><a href="../users/A91LE0MPYE8GJ.html">A91LE0MPYE8GJ</a><br/><p>This was a funny movie I saw, it twice in theatres....The features are good, well this is worth watching Cameron Diaz and the others, did a good job making this..

Well, don't think that. CHARLIE'S ANGELS is NOT a great adaptation of the television show in which it was based. Yes, the movie has lots of jiggle and action and the plot is believable (though it's a rip off of MISSION:IMPOSSIBLE). However, the movie is totally uninspired.<p>Cameron Diaz and Drew Barrymore are the only people in the film who actually look like they enjoyed making the movie. Everyone else in the movie has this look of "what have I gotten myself into" on their faces, especially Lucy Liu and Bill Murray. Actually, Murray and Liu spend most of the movie scowling (suggesting that the rumors of bad blood between those two were true). I'm not surprised Murray does not wish to return as Bosley in the sequel.<p>As mentioned before, the film contains a great deal of action. Too much action to be precise. Kung Wu action sequences and bullet time work well in films like THE MATRIX where those movements are essential to the plot; CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON which is basically a mystical modern legend; and in SHREK because it's a cartoon. However, as cool as those action sequences are, they don't work in every action movie. Those sequences have been exploited and are being overused, often taking any sense of empathy away from otherwise good movies. Those Kung Wu moves were used so much in CHARLIE'S ANGELS that I started laughing every time the Angels were fighting.<p>I was young enough to watch the last few seasons of "Charlie's Angels" when it aired on television. Granted, the show didn't have the best writing in the world and is best known for its jiggle factor. However, the show never really was campy. CHARLIE'S ANGELS the movie is total camp, making fun of itself throughout the picture. That's so sad because the film could have been so good. Moral of the story: don't let McG direct anymore movies.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZVERVFM25MJT.html">A2ZVERVFM25MJT</a><br/><p>This excellent adaptation of the hit TV show is, quite simply, fantastic.  It's fast, furious and utterly ludicrous, but it's enormous fun.  The plot is based around voice recognition software so that the bad guy can find Charlie.  Of course, with such a amusingly blatant movie, who cares about plot?<p>The ex-pop video director cleverly hired a lot of good actors who are clearly having a whale of a time as they act out all of our fantasies - whether it's driving fast cars, sexy outfits or dancing on stage, it's all here.  Cameron Diaz and Drew Barrymore are arguably the best of the bunch as nerdy Natalie and sexy Dylan.<p>The fact that it is just so blatant ensures that the audience knows that it is intentionally that way, defying those critics who were desperate to crawl all over it and tell us how terrible it is.  We get to see slow-mo shots as the girls take off their swimming costumes, cheesy smiles at the camera whilst flicking their hair back and stunts obviously inspired by 'The Matrix'.<p>Basically, 'Charlies Angels' won't change your world but then it was never supposed to and that's precisely why it succeeds.  There are plenty of funny throwaway lines - 'Oops I've come undone' - as well as good special effects and acting.  It works as a spoof, a comedy and a tease and gets a five-star rating in each.</p></br><a href="../users/A32DTCFBBB9WIV.html">A32DTCFBBB9WIV</a><br/><p>Diaz, BArrymore and Liu managed to achieve the impossible: they lended no credibitily to the renowed TV Show original characters !!

The rather stop-go flow of the movie makes since if one realizes the director is only known for directing music videos.  You can almost see where the non-existent commercials should go. Overall the movie is a mix between Mission Impossible, The Matrix, and Austin Powers. Even the director acknowledges this in the commentary. The commentary was okay, but didn't give any more information about the making of the movie than did the featurettes.  The featurettes could have been combined to make one documentary. The most interesting is the martial arts featurette, which features the same Chinese trainer that they used in The Matrix. The most boring featurette is the one about the director, which mostly consists of him being very enthusiastic. There are three deleted scenes included in this DVD. One were Curry and Murray are playing Marco Polo in a swimming pool, another where Diaz, Barrymore (dressed as men) and Curry are in the men's bathroom, and finally one love scene with Barrymore and the kidnap victim. Each doesn't do anything for the film, aren't interesting or funny and are rightfully cut. Two music videos are included. One original hip-hop song and video. The other a typical music video of a remake of the Charlie's Angel theme showing the band intercut with scenes from the movie. Overall the music videos are not that interesting. The most disappointing feature was the outtakes. These are the exact same outtakes seen in the end-credits without the credits. Why these count as an extra is beyond me. Finally standard filmographies are included which are short even by current standards. Overall the bonus features for this DVD are a bit disappointing. I wouldn't get this DVD for the bonus features, but for the simple, fun to watch visual candy. An average value.</p></br><a href="../users/A2J57EQ9KPGXR9.html">A2J57EQ9KPGXR9</a><br/><p>This is one of the worst movies to come out recently, but is that really a surprise?

Overall, the movie is lean on storyline but BIG on eye candy, be it the special effects or of course, the three lovely leading ladies.  While the movie may leave some to be desired the DVD features are abundant in solid extras.<p>THE MOVIE:<p>The Story:<p>Natalie, Dylan and Alex (Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore and Lucy Liu respectively) are secret undercover operatives for a mysterious benefactor named Charlie.  Together the girls try to balance their undercover lives and normal lives.  This time around the girls must find a kidnapped computer scientist and keep the powerful technology he's developed from falling into the wrong hands.  The girls go under deep cover (under various disguises and in various locales) to get to the bottom of the case using both their sex appeal and their kung fu to take out the bad guys and save the day.<p>The Cool Stuff:<p>While the storyline and storytelling are easy to lose track of (the movie moves at breakneck speed), you should be really entertained by this flick.  The various locales, costumes and situations the girls get themselves into are hilarious.  The action sequences (very much Matrix and Hong Kong Kung-Fu inspired) are passable.  Overall, the film is very much enjoyable if not blow away.  The movie works as an action-comedy flick.<p>Best Scenes:<p>1. The Matrix-inspired alley fight<p>2. Massage therapy scene<p>Movie Grade:  3 stars out of 5.  Decent action and comedy.  So-so story.<p>THE DVD:<p>Where the movie is just alright, the DVD itself more than makes this a great viewing experience with a bounty of extras.  Among the goodies included here are:<p>1. Commentary - always insightful<p>2. "Getting G'd Up" - 6 minute feature on the director McG.<p>3. "The Master and the Angels" - 7 minute feature on how the girls trained for the fight scenes plus wire work.<p>4. "Welcome to Angel World" - 4 minute feature about the movie in general<p>5. "Angelic Attire" - 3 minute feature on all the costumes the girls wore.<p>6. "Angelic Effects" - 6 minute feature on all the cool CGI effects.<p>7. "Wired Angels" - 2 minute feature on the alley fight<p>8. 3 Deleted Scenes<p>9. Outtakes - this is basically the video that roled during credits, w/o the credits<p>10. 2 music videos:  "Independent Woman" by Destiny's Child and "Charlie's Angels 2K" by Apollo Four Forty<p>11. Cast and Crew Bios<p>12. Trailers:  The theatrical and teaser trailer plus trailers for other movies.<p>THE VERDICT:<p>Overall the movie makes a decent rental.  The action, FX and comedy are decent.  Indeed, the movie is probably way more comedy than it is an action thriller.  Fans of the women should be pleased with the movie (chicks who kick butt, oh yeah!!!).  The movie isn't a total blow away, but it's fun.<p>The DVD extras definitely put this over the top.  For myself, the features were probably way more interesting than the movie itself.  Again, the features are a great insight into Hollywood and how films are made.<p>Final Grades:<p>Movie:  3 stars<br />Extras:  5 stars<p>Total:  4 stars<p>Recommended</p></br></body></html>

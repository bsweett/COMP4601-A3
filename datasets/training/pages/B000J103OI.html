Also Anne Hathaway was very likeable and I think she did a great job. While Meryl plays the demanding Editor-in-Chief, Miranda Priestly, of a top-notch fashion magazine, she is not really as devlish as the title may indicate -- there are certainly far worse bosses around. Still, in a sense it's a type of comedy, but also with some serious undertones like e.g. dedicating your life to a professional career may ruin your personal life.<br /><br />Stanley Tucci is also superb -- too bad that he's so underrated. Tucci is an excellent actor and I wish he would show up in more films.<br /><br />This movie is certainly an enjoyable flick and it also gives some insight into the subjective and egocentric fashion business, but overall it's not to be taken too serious and it's even a spoof in some way. It's really a fun film and the quality acting really makes this film well worth watching.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KEZLJ59C1JVH.html">A3KEZLJ59C1JVH</a><br/><p>"The Devil Wears Prada" is based on Lauren Weisberger's bestselling novel about a nice, ordinary young girl who experiences a drastic reality check when she takes a job with a large fashion magazine in New York City. Andrea Sachs (Anne Hathaway) always dreamed of becoming a writer, but the only job she manages to land is a position at Runway magazine working as the second assistant to the editor-in-chief. To say that Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep) is an extremely difficult boss would be an understatement. She is cold, condescending, relentless, and impossibly demanding. Miranda can't understand why Andrea is unable to book her on a flight out of Miami even though the city is at the mercy of a hurricane and no flights are being allowed to take off. She also has no problem insisting that Andrea track down two copies of the new and UNPUBLISHED Harry Potter book...what's so hard about that?! Andrea soon learns that working for Miranda is a full-time job. Her phone is constantly ringing with Miranda-related emergencies, and Andrea's relationship with her boyfriend Nate (Adrian Grenier) begins to suffer as a result.<br /><br />Needless to say, working for Miranda turns Andrea's life upside down. Not only is she stuck working for the devil herself, but Andrea is completely out of place in the fashion world. Her wardrobe consists of baggy sweaters and scruffy ballet flats, but all the other girls at Runway show up to work in stiletto heels and Chanel dresses. Eventually, Andrea's coworker Nigel (Stanley Tucci) takes pity on her and helps her "dress the part" by providing her with designer samples from the magazine's clothing collection...but will a chic new look be enough to help Andrea survive in the evil fashion industry?<br /><br />Overall, I think this movie was a pretty good adaptation of Weisberger's novel. Some things were changed in order to trim down the script and provide additional comic relief, but it wasn't anything major. However, the one major difference between the book and the movie is that Miranda shows signs of compassion and weakness in the film. Granted, they are very BRIEF moments of compassion and weakness, but as a result the character loses some of the viciousness that she possesses in the book. I was also disappointed by the way Andrea's relationship with fashion playboy Christian (Simon Baker) was handled in the film and the way the big Paris confrontation scene between Andrea and Miranda was completely toned down. My guess is that the producers didn't want to use the "F" word in a PG-13 film, but COME ON! Fans of the book were completely robbed of that magical moment.<br /><br />Meryl Streep is by far the best thing about this movie...however, I think she's too good for this film. Nothing else about "The Devil Wears Prada" is a match for Streep's excellent performance. I thought that Anne Hathaway was okay as Andrea, but she kind of annoyed me...of course, Andrea's character is kind of annoying in general, so maybe that's all it is. Still, I was expecting more. (At least the clothes were great, though! WOW! But Andrea gave her Paris clothes to EMILY?! What's up with that?! And Emily gets hit by a CAR?! WHY?! Why did they make such silly changes like that?!)<br /><br />Overall, this movie is worth seeing if you enjoyed Weisberger's book. However, the best thing about the book is the character of Miranda, and I was disappointed that her nastiness was underplayed in the film (through no fault of Streep's...this is just a script issue).</p></br><a href="../users/A370Z6I5GBWU44.html">A370Z6I5GBWU44</a><br/><p>Yes, it's a chick flick, but a good one. Merryl Streep does a very good job in her role as the aforementioned 'devil', while Anne Hathaway plays the new assistant/intern who has to deal with the devil, who is a very strict, demanding, and at times, outright hostile/mean woman. Streep especially shines in her role and carries it well.</p></br><a href="../users/A36EW68H08UOCS.html">A36EW68H08UOCS</a><br/><p>Lauren Weisberger used her experience as assistant to "Vogue" editor Anna Wintour as background for her novel "The Devil Wears Prada," which I'll admit is unread by me.  My goal in this review is to stay out of the pre-existing discussion regarding the similarities between the real Wintour and the fictional Miranda Priestly.  I'll also admit that my own knowledge and appreciation for "fashion" is not much beyond the fact that the pinstripes of the New York Yankees are the Brooks Brothers of sports uniforms.<br /><br />Anne Hathaway plays Andrea "Andy" Sachs, an intelligent and eager recent journalism graduate.  Job opportunities, she explains in an early expository scene, are scarce and limited to working for an auto repair magazine or "Runway," a fictional fashion icon modeled after "Vogue."  (The film does not explain how, with so few job opportunities available, the disinterested Sachs secures the position she is reminded repeatedly "a million girls would die for.")<br /><br />Andy is hired as the second assistant to Meryl Streep's Miranda Priestly.  Emily Blunt portrays Emily, Miranda's haughty first assistant. Miranda rules the fashion industry from her perch atop "Runway."  The world's top designers alter their entire lines based on a nod of her head.  She lords her power over all of her minions and only allows an intimate select few, such as Stanley Tucci's wonderful Nigel, speak to her with anything other than genuflection.  Streep's characterization is a marvel.  Body language and facial expression convey as much as her economical, chilly words.<br /><br />Andy initially has no particular regard for fashion or those who govern it, but she needs the job.  I saw the film when it was first released in 2006 and at that time I respected a brief speech Miranda gives Andy regarding the importance of fashion in general, and Miranda's pre-eminent position specifically, but after viewing the film a second time I couldn't help but think "who CARES if one woman says 'cerulean blue is IN?'"  Trying to get a foothold at "Runway," Andy begs the sympathetic Nigel to impart on her a modicum of style, and some of the best scenes in the film show Andy's transformation from "college drab" to fashionable attention-getter.  (Although Andy is a "fat" size 6 - "the new 14", Nigel tells her.) This threatens Emily's position as first assistant, but gathers a few glances of approval from Miranda.<br /><br />Pre-Entourage Adrian Grenier portrays Andy's chef-boyfriend Nate and Tracie Thoms plays best friend Lily.  The central conflict of the film comes in Andy's mental and emotional transformation.  She is willing to wear the clothes and pretend to be one of Miranda's fawning sycophants, but the actual demands of the job begin to make Andy someone indistinguishable from Runway's shallow fashionistas to her truest friends.  Pre-Mentalist Simon Baker (the casting director for "Devil" gets kudos!) plays Christian Thomson, a hot New York writer who takes a fancy to Andy, further complicating her busy life.<br /><br />How much is Andy willing to turn her back on her friends to ride Runway's gravy train to her desired job as a New York Writer?  Weisberger's book was placed in the chick-lit genre, which I suppose makes this film a chick flick, but unlike a few in that film genre (Sex and the City comes to mind - how can the central male character in this series be known only as "Mr. Big"?) this movie is not totally dismissive of males and their perspective.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>In the dizzying world of New York fashion, where size zero is the new 2, six is the new 8, and a bad hair day can end a career, Runaway Magazine is the Holy Grail. Overseen with a finely manicured fist by Miranda Priestly--the most powerful woman in fashion--Runway is a fearsome gauntlet for anyone who wants to make it in the industry. To make Runway the fashion bible of New York and therefore the world, Miranda has let nothing stand in her way--including a long line of assistants that didn't make the cut. It's a job no self-respecting person can survive, yet it's an opportunity a million young women in New York would kill for. A devilishly good time and the most scrumptious comedy. Very entertaining. You will love it.</p></br><a href="../users/AJLYAY1G5Z8GE.html">AJLYAY1G5Z8GE</a><br/><p>A young women comes to New York searching a job as a journalist. She gets hired in a fashion magazine, which has a very tough work environment with a very tough president. The young women tries hard at first to resist this new culture she got in, however eventually she gets overwhelmed by it and loses many of its personal values and relationships. She experiences an internal struggle on whether she should keep sacrificing her life for her job, or the other way around.<br /><br />I am not into fashion myself, but I thought this movie depicts a challenge that everyone can relate to. It depicts the struggle between individuality and society, in which society is usually the stronger one and overcomes individuality.</p></br><a href="../users/A11PTCZ2FM2547.html">A11PTCZ2FM2547</a><br/><p>Look, I don't even know what "prada" is (nor am I inclined to take the time to find out).  What I do know is I've seen THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA several times, and I find it a clever and engaging comedy for two reasons:  Because Anne Hathaway is so absolutely delightful and because Meryl Streep is so absolutely good.<br /><br />Playing a New York newbie who's hired to be an assistant to an editor of a chic fashion magazine, Hathaway brings an innocent naivete that is appealing and genuine.  Plus she's easy on the eye; I find her to be one of the most beautiful actresses on the big screen today.  And then there's Meryl Streep as the beastly Miranda Priestly--the boss who won't take "No", or "I can't get that done" for an answer.  We've all had bosses from hell, but Miranda easily sets the bar as the most self-centered, diabolical, conniving--duplicitous.  And all the while, Streep plays this role in a soft-spoken manner; her Miranda may appear to be in control, but the volcano could erupt at any moment.  And is it ever fun to watch.<br /><br />Adrian Grenier, Stanley Tucci, and Simon Baker furnished the main male roles in this film, and none of them (count 'em) were interesting (okay, maybe Tucci's role as a frustrated fashion designer was a tad interesting); this, I think, was intentional.  THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA is a flick made for chicks.  Speaking of, I enjoyed Emily Blunt as the stressed other assistant willing in an instant to fall on her sword for Miranda; Blunt gets more than her fair share of funny scenes.  But she doesn't tell me what prada is.  But that's okay.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning</p></br><a href="../users/A20EEWWSFMZ1PN.html">A20EEWWSFMZ1PN</a><br/><p>This is a fun little story. It is adapted form a book and adjusted with a few changes to a formula (very predictable) story of corporate greed vs. individual morality.  On this inner journey for the beauty of one's soul we are treated to an outward experience of the world of fashion.<br /><br />Andy Sachs (Anne Hathaway) an aspiring writer is hard up for a job and lands one as an assistant to Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep ), top fashion designer and feared ruthless executive. Soon she is sucked into a would that She had not idea existed. In the book she is entices by the perks of free stylish goodies. In the move she is slowly seduced by the devil (Miranda) herself .  She is mentored and guides past the competition by Nigel (Stanley Tucci.)<br /><br />Do you recognize the Vivian West and Bill Ballast? How about the other vintage styles.  Just as the styles will not distract from the movie neither will the sound score which does not try to compete with the dialog; however it does abruptly change volume.<br /><br />Even if the story is formula the acting and actors make this a fun way to pass time. So gird  your loins.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005N89S">She-Devil ~ Meryl Streep</a></p></br><a href="../users/A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX.html">A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX</a><br/><p>This isn't my usual type of movie, but many people were talking about it so I watched it. If it's an accurate portrayal, it's an interesting look inside the fashion industry, the fashion moguls who drive it, and the people whose lives depend on it. The entire cast turn in very strong performances; Stanley Tucci was my favorite as Streep's artistic director, Anne Hathaway is a talented newcomer, and of course Streep practically steals the show as the boss from hell who everyone fears but loves to hate. If you're into high fashion, just watching the never-ending procession of designer clothes might be worth it by itself. The personal drama and plot revolve around a bright, young college grad who, by some strange turn of events, finds herself in apparently the most sought after and probably top entry level job in the industry as Streep's assistant, a job she really isn't suited for. Overall, it's a fine movie that provides an interesting look at what for me was a little known industry.</p></br><a href="../users/A13D1WTFEMS9VH.html">A13D1WTFEMS9VH</a><br/><p>'The Devil Wears Prada' felt like a cinematic version of the old TV show 'That Girl' mated to a frenetic score, with the pretension of giving us a behind-the-scenes look at the fashion biz. Anne Hathaway is a real sweetheart, that's for sure. Her sappy Teddy Bear boyfriend was not very believable, though, with his "I'd rather you wear a sweatshirt and no makeup than see you looking drop-dead gorgeous in all those hot, expensive clothes!" attitude. Yeah, right. Neither, to me, was the character played by Streep believable. An underlying premise was that if she were a man acting so boorishly, no one would think twice. Perhaps this might be true for anyone lacking self respect. If she was a guy and talked to me like that, I'd deck her. Since she isn't, I'd simply tear her a new one verbally, toss her Prada shoes and Gucci whatever out the window and blow my nose on her Herm&egrave;s scarf.<br /><br />In the end, this is strictly a predictable chick flick. I mean, was the d&eacute;nouement ever really in doubt? Hardly.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HJB9J5O5CLPB.html">A2HJB9J5O5CLPB</a><br/><p>Lauren Weisberger's, Tell All, gets the Hollywood Treatment with some success.  Yes. I have reservations, but we'll get to that in a moment.  Meryl Streep doesn't have to effect a foreign accent in The Devil Wears Prada, but she is a mean iceberg, which is against type I guess. Her "Emily," what Streep calls her assistants, they don't last long, so they're all called Emily.  Anne Hathaway with the slim figure and botox lips plays the swell journalist student with a short, chef boyfriend, living as if they were on a Friends" style sitcom in the big city. Their existence is chic shabby post college. "Yeah, we're working [...] jobs and livin' in a cracker barrel, but aren't old sweaters and skirts cool? Apparently not as Hathaway has somehow fallen upon the chance-of-a-lifetime job in the fashion industry she really doesn't want for she is a journalist you see.  Working for Streep, a fashion icon, playing footsy with handsome millionaires, and driving around in limos in a whirl of designer glamour, or attending runway shows in Paris are so, so, faux.<br /><br />Now we have the Cinderella story told to a delighted audience of sophisticated women and their jaded boyfriends. I'd say, okay, get the woman her coffee and make sure her plane can get out of LA in the middle of a tornado or blizzard, so that Paris Fashion might survive another day.  Remember all the little people that make it happen.  I'm paraphrasing one of Streep's restrained speeches on why Hathaway has clothes on her back.<br /><br />The question, shall a woman have career or a simple life with her boring boyfriend in Boston? Let's see, glamour, maids to wait on you hand and foot, and high style versus family and screaming babies in a small apartment?  Hmmm, what would the lady choose? Come on Hollywood.  Tell them the truth.  Success is good and self-imposed failure stinks.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EOLRV216BXJ9.html">A1EOLRV216BXJ9</a><br/><p>Meryl Streep is surely the main draw to this movie. With one look, she shows her like or dislike. I especially like the way she pursed her lips, her admiration with one nod, two nods and the very rare smile she would give.<br /><br />Emily Blunt and Stanley Gucci are wonderful. Anne Hathaway looked so attractive and classy in the second half of the movie. Meryl Streep and Anne Hathaway in the limo letting their thoughts out were well presented and proved that Anne Hathaway could act and impress. Yet the movie was not as great as I expected.<br /><br />Many a time the movie could not decide who the leading lady is. If it is Anne Hathaway, it failed because her performance was not consistent. It is one thing she had to display her lack in fashion sense, her ability to mix and match; it is quite another thing to deliberately dress her as bulky and unattractive. After all, she is a successful reporter at university with a brilliant resume. She can have brains as well as looks - casual as it may be. Second, if it is the fashion sense she lacks, the movie surely does not show much either. Compared with Project Runway or ANTM, fashion in this movie just focus on expensive clothes with not a single reference to fashion sense. Some dresses Anne Hathaway wore that were supposed to dazzle the room full of people did not really do her justice. Her other clothes at work were much more flattering. One can dress well without skyhigh price tags - just look at how good Anne Hathaway look in her leather jacket and jeans in the final scene.<br /><br />More importantly, the script could have been bolder. It could not bring out Anne Hathaway as an intelligent, beautiful person with a dream, at least not in the first part of the movie. Here, there is no Melanie Griffth in Working Girl; no Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman. Only Meryl Streep can deliver throughout the movie. The unfortunate thing it doesn't look like she is the leading lady, unlike Glenn Close in Dangerous Liasions.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R602SXNGOMJ4.html">A1R602SXNGOMJ4</a><br/><p>From what I can remember when I read the book, the film stayed fairly true to the book...which is very unusual.  If you've read the book, you won't be disappointed!<br /><br />It's the story of a young girl who moves to NYC to become a journalist but finds herself working as an assistant for a top notch fashion magazine, which is way out of her style league. The girl is a go-getter so she does what she has to do to make it work and ends up becoming the right hand (wo)man to the editor and chief changing her life (for better or worse) forever.<br /><br />The movie, even though trashed by some critics as "shallow and unfulfilling", is sinfully delicious! The key ingredient to the genius and brilliance of this movie is Meryl Streep, one of the best actors in the history of film. She plays the role of the editor-in-chief of the fake fashion magazine, "Runway", so well that she makes the entire movie a joy to watch. Add that to the strong performances of Anne Hathaway and (especially) Emily Blunt, as the first assistant to Streep, this movie is delightful to sit through.<br /><br />All in all, the story wasn't anything deep, so just go and watch the movie for the great performances and the "high-class" laughs that it packs.</p></br><a href="../users/A2582KMXLK2P06.html">A2582KMXLK2P06</a><br/><p>I went in expecting a movie that was intended for women.  In other words, a romance comedy, or something similar.<br /><br />That's NOT what I got.  Instead I got a really good understanding of the amazing amount of stress that fashion models have to go through in order to stay fit and be as close to perfect as humanly possible.  Because of this movie, I found out that the life of a fashion model is NOT just a simple cakewalk, and that these models really have to work to be the center of attention in magazines and whatnot.  Having to go through life this way is not as easy as it sounds.  You have to dress correctly, walk correctly, have a perfect smile, etc.  Not easy at all.<br /><br />Meryl Streep plays an old lady who has the NASTIEST attitude I have ever seen someone have.  She isn't afraid to speak exactly how she feels, and the entire movie is about the main character (Anne Hathaway) having to stay focused and fit in with the world of fashion models in order to be successful at her job (even though she appears to be out of place in that kind of environment).<br /><br />I really liked the movie.  I laughed a bit, learned a lot, and thought everyone's performance was spot-on.  Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A1129LM24YWSZV.html">A1129LM24YWSZV</a><br/><p>While the movie is many things that critics have called it (predictable, pat, etc.), it is still worth watching because of Streep's elegant performance. Quick set up: Andy (played by Anne Hathaway), a smart journalism grad trying to make her way in the big city, is jobless and luckless. In desperation, she goes on an interview to Runway magazine, a fashion publication she's barely heard of. Editor-in-Chief Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep), a dragonlady workaholic with a penchant for steaks and Starbucks, hires the unlikely girl as her second assistant. The movie then follows Andy and Miranda as their professional relationship continues.<br /><br />Director David Frankel had better be glad that Miranda is such a primary character in this script, because Streep elevated the material (as she always does). Many other actresses might have played Miranda as a screamer, driven by anger and a perverse pleasure in others' misery. However, Streep makes her real. She is ambitious; she works like a dog; she is exacting; and she expects no less from those who work for her. Because, time and again, the viewer sees how hard Miranda works, it's difficult to write her off as a hate-able character. After all, she doesn't ask her employees to work any harder than she's working herself. As well, I loved the calm, the feeling of business-as-usual that Streep exuded as Miranda. She never raised her voice. She rarely seemed to get emotionally involved in her business decisions. She just did her job. It's a very interesting protrait of a woman at the top in her chosen profession. I can see why Streep made many of the choices she made, and I think she was wonderful in the role.<br /><br />To boot, there are other, less noble reasons to go see The Devil Wears Prada. First, the clothes and how each character wears them make for fascinating study. Secondly, you'll discover some of the best movies lines ever while watching. ("I'm one stomach flu away from my goal weight," mentions one character. "She's a sadist . . . and not in the good way," opines another. And, I think, my favorite - "Something told me, hire the smart . . . fat girl.") I think it's best viewed with a group of chatty friends, after imbibing something fruity and alcoholic.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AOKQCH0YBZDS.html">A3AOKQCH0YBZDS</a><br/><p>Geez, Meryl Streep is phenomenal in her role as the editor-in chief to elite fashion magazine "Runway" and plays the perfect boss from hell. I can't imagine any other actress for this role! Also nice to see actress Anne Hathaway mature as an actress and move beyond "The Princess Diaries".<br /><br />This movie is fast paced, humorous, and a total chick flick at heart. I loved every second of this movie.... Sure its no Oscar Nominee, its not meant to be anything other than just pure entertainment.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LZVU5SRRM3VX.html">A1LZVU5SRRM3VX</a><br/><p>One of the better movies I have watched recently, this film managed to pull off dead serious and uproariously funny at the same time, and most importantly, kept me entertained throughout.<br /><br />Anne Hathaway is both vulnerably awkward and gorgeous at the same time as she stumbles her way through her employment with the ever-demanding Meryl Streep as her boss.  Stanley Tucci also adds some tragi-comic flair to the mix, and the supporting cast supports without getting in the way.<br /><br />Ultimately, the film resonated with me well because its underlying theme is work-life balance, an issue with which I struggle on a daily basis.  The gag reel was also amusing, and the deleted scenes contained some interesting material that didn't make the final cut.<br /><br />The only thing keeping this from getting a resounding 5 stars is pacing.  While I was consistently entertained by the film, the filmmakers could have shaved another 10 minutes from the film and further tightened it without the viewer missing anything.  The most effective sequences are the quick-cut portions showing the day-to-day similarities of Meryl Streep's systematic abuse of power, and in my opinion, several longer sequences could have been similarly intercut as a sort of "running gag," which would have increased the comedic effect and shortened a movie whose premise wears out its welcome slightly before the denouement.<br /><br />Otherwise, a very entertaining film with a fine cast.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL.html">A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL</a><br/><p>Some people live to work.  As the late Frank Sinatra sang, "If you can make it there [New York], then you can make it anywhere."  It is on this premise that nice woman, Andrea "Andie" Sacks (Anne Hathaway) comes to the Big Apple from the greater Chicago Area in order to make it as a columnist at a major periodical.  After an awkward interview, she lands a big job at fashion magazine 'Runway,'. She has to settle as a receptionist, but really is more of a personal assistant to the leading lady, Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep), whose every move makes or breaks the fashion industry.  Known as a "notorious sadist", Priestly lives to belittle and berate her subordinates.  "By all means, move at a glacial pace.  That always thrills me," Miranda chortles.  She creates great tension, and Andie must act like "Radar O' Reilly" with a clairvoyance to forecast every whim of her starchy employer.  We get the point ad nauseam, but there's enough variety in the film to transcend its problems and misery.  Sometimes they beat the idea to death, but the movie takes enough free time to ponder on the estate of things.  There's her boyfriend, Nate (Adrian Granier) and their friends who offer a relaxed atmosphere with a comraderie that rises above her fray.  On the other hand, there's the pressure to succeed and temptation from a vain competitor, Christian Thompson (Simon Baker).  The allure of success and a cosmopolitan man have her pondering between two roads.  (One road is the glory of high fashion; the other is down to earth.)  Less compelling is her competitive near superior, Emily (Emily Blunt) who seems to have worked so long for the franchise, she's acquired their bosses' accumen.  Almost implausibly, Andie comes to the defense of despicable people at her own expense.  (Is anyone that nice?)  Another supervisor high on the food chain is Nigel (played with proper bluster by Stanley Tucci), a blunt and fastidious figure who is the only one with enough humanity to eventually warm up to her.  Andie's smart and has a good work ethic, but the movie does a wonderful job presenting and sorting out her priorities.  Like the rest of us, many are tied to their cell phones like an ambilical chord.  Should she sever the ties or not?<br /><br />'The Devil Wears Prada' is a surprisingly fun movie with a presentation that rises above ordinary sit-com fare.  It also refuses to entirely demonize the enemy.  Andie, to their credit, gains some self-confidence as she succumbs to a fashion make-over.  The villains are also presented with frailties and decency behind their thick skin.  Meryl Streep gives a relaxed prima dona performance; one that also makes us see her believable vulnerability behind her fashion facade.  She seems to walk through the role (although this is only testimony to her brilliance).  Everyone else delivers good, solid performances throughout.  Not giving a fig about fashion, 'The Devil Wears Prada' is an enjoyable and thoughtful release from what I thought would have been an overly labored effort.</p></br><a href="../users/A18M68DE1Y6W51.html">A18M68DE1Y6W51</a><br/><p>I first saw this DVD under duress: A friend insisted we watch it. I had preconceived notions: Meryl Streep will overplay her character. Anne Hathaway will be too cute. I'll be bored, bored, bored. WRONG!!!<br /><br />Meryl Streep is totally hilarious as the over-the-top boss from hell, Miranda Priestly. Anne Hathaway IS cute, but in a well-acted, believable way that makes you want to hug her. It was a pleasure to see Stanley Tucci chew up the scenery, and the fashions, to me, make the movie.<br /><br />So now I'm ordering this DVD, thrilled to have it. It's the type of movie you can watch with your girlfriends (and the occasional "sure-of-his-masculinity male") while it snows outside and you eat all the popcorn and ice cream you promised not to touch.<br /><br />Great casting, great editing, terrific shots of New York, Paris, runways and the lot.

Anne Hathaway plays the unstylish, clumsy Andrea who improbably lands a job with Miranda Priestly, played brilliantly by Meryl Streep. Andrea fixes herself up and is smart enough to figure out what Miranda wants, and she finds herself promoted over the senior assistant. In the process, however, Andrea loses boyfriend and friends, as the job becomes all-consuming. In the end, Andrea gives it all up for a "real" job in journalism, and wins her long-suffering man back.<br /><br />The real star here is Streep, who plays Miranda with icy coldness, except for one breathaking scene where she finds out that her husband wants a divorce. The other star is the clothes--sexy, frivolous, sleek and stylish--Hathaway looks great after her makeover. The story is predictable, but no matter--it's totally enjoyable.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>"The Devil Wears Prada" is based on the best-selling novel by Lauren Weisberger about a young woman's journey of self-discovery through fashion -the clothes and the industry.

It seems that the job will kill Andy until she decides to embrace her boss' values and pour herself into it, launching her to professional success and personal turmoil.<br /><br />"The Devil Wears Prada" is a bit confused when it advocates embracing one's vocation and its culture without reservation...but then says Andy should stay true to herself and walk away from it all. But that is easy to overlook, because this is such an enjoyable film. It's an homage to the fashion industry in which the city of New York is a sort of overarching character. Meryl Streep is not to be missed as Miranda Priestly, whose incisive, merciless quips inject some black comedy. The stand-out performance comes from Emily Blunt, however, as Miranda's 1st assistant, a fashionista who both envies Andy's success and depends upon it. Stanley Tucci does a nice turn as "Runway"'s acerbic but sympathetic fashion director Nigel. These people don't mince words! And that's a real pleasure.<br /><br />"Runway" magazine is modeled after "Vogue", where Lauren Weisberger worked as an assistant to editor-in-chief Anna Wintour, the inspiration for Miranda Priestly. The film's view of fashion editors is accordingly optimistic. The truth is that fashion editors are not at liberty to criticize bad designs, because the design houses pay for the ad space -even if they convince themselves otherwise by frowning on the occasional garment. But "The Devil Wears Prada" is an entertaining look at one component of the fashion industry. It respects clothes and the people who create a market for them. It conveys why fashion is important, while it encourages us to laugh at the fashion industry's excesses.<br /><br />The DVD (20th Century Fox 2006): Bonus features are 5 featurettes, 15 deleted scenes with optional commentary, a Gag Reel (5 min), theatrical trailer, soundtrack promo, and audio commentary.

Her represntation of the dragon lady boss was dead on!  Not the high-octane-greedy-loud-mouthed CEO so typical of Hollywood films, but a very realistic view of Bosses at the top and the manner in which their subordinates react to meet their demands. She's controlled, soft spoken, unyielding and very firm...and she knows the business better than anyone else.  It's funny to watch people scramble to meet her impossible demands.<br /><br />Amazing clothes!  I have a new appreciation for the fashion industry.  I didn't realize so much went into it. Enjoyable chick flick with amazing couture.</p></br><a href="../users/A359IT81FBX64Y.html">A359IT81FBX64Y</a><br/><p>I thought Meryl Streep didn't do bad movies, and now another classy starlet betrays me. The movie is completely predictable and the laugh quotient is a low 2.5 chuckles per hour. The "dragon lady," Miranda Priestly, is not just impossible to work for, she's IMPOSSIBLE to work for. She requires her lowly, untrained, inexperienced assistant to perform miracles and menial chores every day, and we never see Miranda do anything extraordinary. Miranda mumbles her cryptic orders too fast even for a court stenographer to understand. We witness Andy, the naive, fashion-challenged new assistant, undergo a fashion and personality makeover, topping it off with an affair not to remember. We see the devastation of everyone's personal life, which isn't even good for dark humor. We hear an oddly earnest speech about the merits of a dysfunctional, destructive, and corrupt work ethic. And in the rarefied and cutthroat atmosphere of high fashion we see Andy regain her sense of humanity, not to save herself, but to protect her abuser's "delicate" feelings. Well, they had to contrive a happy ending somehow.</p></br><a href="../users/A3572FTYUQQW3P.html">A3572FTYUQQW3P</a><br/><p>This movie is not a tragedy, a comedy, a drama,a parody, or even a satire although it comes close at times.  It seems to be a cross between a Docudrama and a Docu-satire.  Meryl Streep's performance is excellent and her scene as she announces her divorce raises her performance to its well deserved Oscar nomination.  The screen play does an excellent job of portraying the attitude of entitlement displayed by many top executives as Streep treats her employees as her personal servants.  She is a driven executive that has no life outside of her job and doesn't expect her employees to have one either -- they are there to serve her.  Like most senior executives she is ruthless, self-absorbed, and acts only in her own self-interest.  While this movie accurately describes my experience with senior executives the movie doesn't accurately portray the end game.  Ann Hatheway's character is living in a dingy apartment with some scuzzy guy who looks like he hasn't bathed in six months.  As she climbs the ladder and is exposed to the rich and powerful she is transformed into a player.  This is very logical and it happens but in the end she throws this away and goes back to the unkempt and unhygenic loser.  This was totally unrealistic.  I liked the movie but only gave it three stars because it fell apart at the end.  Once a player -- always a player.</p></br><a href="../users/A461VTLW9G9YB.html">A461VTLW9G9YB</a><br/><p>When I saw the preview for this movie I was like I am so not seeing that. And then I saw it now on TV. Wow is it good! Great acting, very believable and you didn't feel like you were watching a movie. It felt real. Sad how Andy changed cause of her job but she realized it in the end. Very good movie. Love to see it again</p></br><a href="../users/A1SPB225CVTRUU.html">A1SPB225CVTRUU</a><br/><p>The Devil Wears Prada is one of the best comedies and funniest fashion themed films in recent years. I found it totally entertaining and enjoyed every minute of Meryl Streep's wicked and devilish rendition of Miranda Priestley. She managed to make the most of lesser screentime and chews up every scene effortlessly. She's so good at her expressions and body language that she upstaged everyone else in the group scenes. Her character is totally unlikeable, because she's heartless, cold, ruthless, but her performance makes it so delightful. It's unfortunate that Anne Hathaway's unfashionable Andie role took up most of the screentime. Her scenes with the boyfriend and friends really took away from the focus of the film. I wanted to see more of her opposite Streep, and how she worked around the Devil. Yes, I did find the scenes of Miranda's nasty treatments towards Andie became too repetitious, but it was pretty much the funniest moments of the film. It's obvious that Hathaway's performance is not as impressive as Streep and the scene stealing Stanley Tucci who helps her to transform from an ugly duckling into a fashion chick. Emily Blunt who plays Miranda's first assistant gets to have some funny moments to work with. I couldn't stop thinking that she looks so much like Cilian Murphy in Breakfast in Pluto. Overall, the film is very stimulating comedy with lots of high fashion moments, not to mention that they got all the top designer wardrobe for the cast especially Streep who had the most lavish wardrobe changes. Even Valentino made a cameo apperance! I must say that Patricia Field did a marvellous job with the costume, even the "stuff" she put together for Andie looks so hideous that it was perfect. I won't be surprised if Streep and Field will receive an Oscar nomination for their memorable works come 2007.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FY3H6F4249E0.html">A3FY3H6F4249E0</a><br/><p>An excellent performance by Meryl Streepe (aka Miranda Priestly/Dragon Lady).  Miranda is somebody really big in the fashion industry.  She is soooo big, that everybody jumps to her every desire, including designers, writers, photographers, etc.  Miranda runs a huge fashion business and fashion magazine based out of New York City.  Miranda keeps 2 personal assistants and has only one (Emily) right now and Miranda is looking for a second assistant.  This is the job that "a million girls would die for," as you will hear said several times.  The "devil" wearing Prada does not refer to a Satan figure.  It is just that Miranda is such an unapproachable person, so much so that when she comes in to work, everybody else quickly walks the other way and the workers all go into complete panic.<br /><br />Enters Anne Hathaway, as Andria, a simple girl with a degree in journalism.  Andria is immediately snubbed by Emily and Miranda as having no fashion sense and totally wrong for the job, but Miranda decides to hire Andria anyway, against her better judgement.  Miranda is truly the boss from hell.  Working for her is faster paced than Superman can fly.  She is abrupt, demanding, cold, and volitile.  You are also on call 24/7 and the pay is not that great.  Andria is trying her best but getting frustrated fast when finally she decided to get with the program.  Seeking the assistance of male co-worker and fashion coordinator for Miranda, Nigel, Andria sheds her dumpy sweaters and black school-girl tights and starts dressing in the high-fashion style from the company's supply.  This begins to please Dragon Lady and Andria/Andy begins to acquire bigger and better job responsibilities.  Andy also begins to take on the all-for-business personality more in-keeping with her new line of dress.  Her friends and boyfriend don't really like the changes either.<br /><br />The movie is about the big business of the high fashion industry, even taking you to Paris designer shows.  It's about intense career committment that is above a personal life.  It's also about change, what's important, wheeling and dealing in the corporate world, disappointments, and caring or not caring about people. The "Devil Wears Prada" could also be a comparison to the concept of giving your personal life over to the corporate world.<br /><br />I guess you would call this a chick-flick.  I don't see where most guys would be interested in it.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>The title of the film (based on the bestselling novel which I have not read) refers to a New York fashion magazine editor named Miranda Priestly. This devil, I mean, Miranda, is played by Meryl Streep who is in top form, bringing the film itself one or two notches above other Hollywood comedies. Whether or not you like her dragon-lady character, you will be impresses with her turn, one of her best in a decade. or maybe two.<br /><br />I must add that Anne Hathaway is also very good as Andy, a na?ve career girl in New York who scored a job as the second assistant to Miranda. For Andy it as only a stepping stone to be a journalist, but while doing the thankless jobs for Miranda, she is gradually attracted to the world which she initially despised.<br /><br />Miranda never misses a chance to reveal her (perversely) cynical view on everything which she dislikes, and the way she makes her acid comments on them has a certain kind of unforgettable taste that is either repulsive or irresistible, or both. The sado-masochistic relations between her and Andy keeps you interested in the film's otherwise predictable story, even though anyone with level-headed mind (like Andy) would not usually turn down the opportunity to learn at a first-rate law school in order to be ill-treated by Miranda. As Stanley Tucci's fashion director says, why not quit?<br /><br />In spite of superb acting from Streep and Hathaway, and the critical praises heaped on the film, I find `The Devil Wears Prada' left much to be desired. The script is almost auto-pilot when the main characters do not share the screen. In fact the career success of Andy (if I may call her `success' that way) owes much to incredible luck; she is lucky to have a capable fashion director Nigel (Stanley Tucci) at hand when she wants it, and an entire wardrobe for them to use for that matter; she is lucky to know a writer working for another prestigious New York magazine Christian (Simon Baker) who can help her out when Miranda asks Andy to obtain something very rare (actually, no one but J. K. Rowling can). There is something cosy and (if I may so) superficial about the film's attitudes to the works Andy is trying to do, something that prevents the film from becoming a really biting comedy that it could have been.<br /><br />There is one impressive scene showing why Meryl Streep is a great actress who is not afraid of being truly in character. I do not say when and how she shows it because it is the only surprise I got while watching `The Devil Wears Prada.' The film is enjoyable with the great performances of the two leads, the beautiful locations of the city and the fashionable costumes, but it could still have been better with just something more than another take of success story, and some more scenes looking under the surface of the people working for this fashion industry.</p></br><a href="../users/A33CLVW2K7SL1P.html">A33CLVW2K7SL1P</a><br/><p>The old saying, "clothes make the man", apparently applies equally to women. (Perhaps it applies more strictly to women, but was never spoken for a lack of need.)<br /><br />My point being that when Andrea (Anne Hathaway) slips out of her frumpy plaid skirts and bargain bin sweaters and trades up to Jimmy Choo shoes, she becomes a remarkably efficient assistant to Miranda, the devil-in-Prada. No longer does she clumsily fumble her way down Manhattan streets with Starbucks coffees, bags of last-minute requests - no, now she has her hair done, is "decked out to the nines" (pun intended) and is one competent gal.<br /><br />Sorry, but that seemed a bit too Barbie-esque for me. One minute we have Barbie the flight attendant, for example, the next Barbie the CEO. All because of the clothes.<br /><br />Meryl Streep plays her character with gorgeous understatement - you can almost hear the soft hissing in her voice when she speaks. Anne Hathaway plays an interesting "Ugly Betty" character (for indeed, Ugly Betty seems to have used this for much of its inspiration, at least at Mode Magazine). Anne is hardly unattractive, hardly fat - she simply isn't representative of haute couture.<br /><br />There isn't much of a plot to the movie. It's more of a collection of events taking Andrea from a bungling assistant to a more successful assistant, and everything that you would expect coming along for the ride - a jealous boyfriend, a love interest that seems to appear in the story for one reason alone...that sort of thing.<br /><br />Yet it's an entertaining film. Streep is a delight to watch, as is Hathaway, especially in the beginning when she was growing accustomed to her co-workers looking askance at her. All-in-all, it was enjoyable and funny - if not great.</p></br><a href="../users/A161ANWB62G3M8.html">A161ANWB62G3M8</a><br/><p>This is a very pleasant and charming film with some great lines in it. Well worth watching.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1906669023">Sherlock Holmes and the Flying Zombie Death Monkeys</a></p></br><a href="../users/AOTMP0OKJOUWI.html">AOTMP0OKJOUWI</a><br/><p>As has been said in other reviews, it is truly the stellar cast and acting of this film that make it wonderful. Otherwise, I'm afraid that the fluffy plot would bomb.  But the actors are fresh, funny, and very much into making the movie work.  Most of the joy of watching this is indeed the actors and their corresponding characters.<br /><br />But do not be mistaken by the fluffy plot comment.  While I'm sure that this is the type of movie that would drive many nuts, those that can appreciate simple light-hearted goodness will enjoy this. It's funny, sweet, and, while not carrying too much in the way of complexity, packs plenty of heart.<br /><br />It's fun to watch, and Hathaway and Streep have amazing banter.  If that's all you need to like a movie, this will work well.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EBHHCZO6V2A4.html">A3EBHHCZO6V2A4</a><br/><p>"The Devil Wears Prada" is good,naughty fun. It's a cinematic petit four, small, sweet, not to be taken too seriously. Anne Hathaway, proving she's as good at comedy as she is at pathos (check out her performance in "Brokeback Mountain" as Jake Gyllenhaal's hapless,heartbroken wife),stars as Andrea Sachs,a journalism graduate. Andrea (who goes by the androgynous "Andy") tries her luck at a fashion magazine. First, she encounters the bland, arrogant Emily (chunky Canadian crooner Michael Buble's real-life bland girlfriend Emily Blunt) It is awkward. Then she encounters Miranda Priestley herself (a radiant Meryl Streep)<br /><br />"The Devil Wears Prada" is an archetypal chick flick. Miranda sends Andy off on impossible tasks-such as delivering the rough draft of her magazine to her mansion, getting the right clothes, and so on. Since this is a materialistic movie, it's about Andy's transformation from ugly duckling to beautiful swan through high fashion. There are also product placements for Starbucks, Dean&Deluca, and the Harry Potter series (Miranda sends Andy to get the first copy of the seventh book) Andy's relationship with her boyfriend Nate (Adrian Grenier) gets strained,despite the fact he's in haute cuisine and makes "port reductions." You'd think haute couture and haute cuisine would complement and co-exist! Andy has a one-night stand with an improbably heterosexual fashion designer, Christian Thompson, who looks like he's gone to the plastic surgery one too many times. She also befriends the gay,flamboyant Nigel (Stanley Tucci) He confides in Andy of his childhood, saying that while his brothers played sports, he read fashion magazines. One wonders if Dr. Joseph Nicolosi would've said that going to a sports camp would've prevented Nigel's gayness. Swinging the bat makes boys straight!....well,maybe. The movie has a fairy tale ending- Andy reconciles with Nate, and she even gets a good recommendation from Miranda. Indeed, Miranda is less villainous than Emily. Emily is cold and conceited, while Miranda shows her vulnerable side when her marriage is breaking up. One feels sympathy for her. Miranda is a woman looking for redemption through fashion and power. She hasn't found what she's looking for.<br /><br />"Devil Wears Prada" has some good extras,such as "Fashion Visionary: Patricia Field" and "Finding Valentino." The "Fashion and NYC" is boring. I stopped it five minutes in. "Boss from Hell" and "Book to Movie" looked boringly self-referential.<br /><br />"Devil Wears Prada" is a fun fashion flick. If you like "Prada",you'll enjoy ABC's campy ode to fashion, "Ugly Betty."</p></br><a href="../users/A2XXV9HF169LCF.html">A2XXV9HF169LCF</a><br/><p>So this should be sub-titled "A cautionary tale for girls". The basic message seems to be "don't be ambitious, girls, it'll make you miserable and bitter and nobody will like you or be close to you. Be content with smaller things and don't dream big, it's too scary out there." Either that or "Don't change who you are inside for the high life, don't betray your friends, it's morally wrong and makes you into a bad person who doesn't like or recognize herself and it's not worth it".<br /><br />One of those messages should be listened to by all those silly girls desperately wearing the aggressively trashy clothing and excessive bling; the other is a crock of bad beans.<br /><br />Aside from that it's a wonderful movie and I enjoyed it immensely.</p></br><a href="../users/A39IBJB2PBVC7I.html">A39IBJB2PBVC7I</a><br/><p>There's good news and bad news about The Devil Wears Prada.  Since this Season In Hell everyone who's anyone will be wearing hobnail boots, lets start with the bad news.  This movie is awful, even as a chick-flick guilty pleasure it's awful.  The plot is hackneyed to the point of exhaustion, the ending is glib and facile, the characters are so two dimensional that when they turn sideways all you can see is the label, and the engine driving the alleged action - the scary power of Miranda Priestly - emanates from her ability to determine what color sweater the likes of us will be wearing next year.  In sum - it's the fashion industry folks - it doesn't matter - compared to this world cotton candy looks substantial.<br /><br />Now the good news.  Anne Hathaway is adorable as Andy Sachs, and makes her ridiculous role believable - she sells it.  She's as appealing in jeans as she is in couture.  Stanley Tucci is perfect - perfect - as Nigel.  I have never seen Tucci turn in a bad performance - he is absolutely amazing.  The role would have been easy to send over the top but Tucci nails it with restraint and class, fantastic.<br /><br />Of course the showcase here is Meryl Streep - and honestly - although it's heresy - I've never cared much for her work.  Sadly her role is not even two-dimensional, it's almost one-dimensional - but she carries it off so well that you just don't care.  It's a hoot watching her, and she's obviously having a ball.  As you might imagine, it's a visually pleasing movie, the fashion plates just keep passing by, which is fun.  Male characters fare badly, Andy's boyfriend is a waste of atoms and her bad boy love interest is completely unconvincing as a straight male putting the moves on a woman.  Special bonus points to Emily Blunt who turns in an outstanding performance as Priestly's assistant Emily - she perfectly embodies the neurotic cattiness and one-upsmanship of the industry.<br /><br />To be found at the back of the store with the other distressed goods, on the rack; the torture rack.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>Haven't read the book so I have nothing to compare this movie to. But I don't think I would regret not having read the book first. Well the movie is good enough that I don't think I shall be reading the book anymore, I will rather watch the movie again. Having been in the fashion industry I can relate to this very well. "The Devil Wears Prada" is director David Frankel's first theatrical feature film, however, it's by no means his first important job, as Frankel perfected his craft directing several episodes of the famous TV series, "Sex and the City" (also inspired by a "chick lit" source). In many ways, "The Devil Wears Prada" retains the feeling of Frankel's previous work and it's probably the obvious next step in his career. While it may not be the most original film ever, it has quite good features, such as a very good edition (by Mark Livolsi) and a well-selected soundtrack.<br /><br />Many words have been written about Meryl Streep's excellent performance, so I'll just say that she was perfect for the role; as she gives a deeper, more complex personality to a character that essentially exist to be mean. While Streep's performance is essentially what makes the film to stand out from other similar movies, credit must also go to Anne Hathaway and Emily Blunt, who play Miranda's two main assistants. Hathaway as our main character, Andy, delivers a quiet, subtle performance that allows her character to be likable, especially as her actions begin to show the slow but constant effect that Miranda has in her. Emily Blunt is the film's best surprise, showing a great future and a big talent for comedy. Finally, Stanley Tucci has a minor role, but shows off his scene-stealing abilities and makes gold of every moment he appears on screen. The rest of the cast is quite effective, but nothing really as special as the four main characters.<br /><br />Personally, I think that the film's worst problem is the many similarities it shares with other films, as it gives the feeling that the story lacks originality. However, "The Devil Wears Prada" makes up for this flaw with its light-hearted tone and its big charm, as it's a film that doesn't take itself too seriously (as other similar films do). Also, Frankel's past directing a TV series becomes too notorious at times, making the film look like an extended chapter of a TV series; however, this is not really as annoying as it sounds, and it's probably due to the act that this is Frankel's first feature film.<br /><br />"The Devil Wears Prada" is quite a good film for a nice evening; it's charming, funny, and most importantly: entertaining. It's always a joy to watch a very talented actress at work, but it's also a joy to discover three new talents (Hathaway, Blunt and director David Frankel) having a chance and making a good job. It may not be a life-changing experience, but this devil is a nice surprise.</p></br><a href="../users/ABH4G7TVI6G2T.html">ABH4G7TVI6G2T</a><br/><p>THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA features the fabulous Meryl Streep in her most cattily-comedic performance since "Death Becomes Her".  She plays Miranda Priestly, the revered and feared editor-in-chief of Runway, the most popular fashion magazine on the planet.<br /><br />When an idealistic writer named Andy Sachs (Anne Hathaway, "The Princess Diaries", "Becoming Jane") becomes employed as Miranda's new assistant, she soon finds herself playing gumshoe to Miranda's impossible requests, and fending off her hurtful insults.  But along the way, Andy gains in confidence and style, and proves herself more than a match when the going gets rough.<br /><br />Streep and Hathaway square off hilariously in this great film.  The supporting cast is led by Emily Blunt and Stanley Tucci.  The film was based on Lauren Weisberger's novel of the same name, and reportedly inspired by Vogue Magazine's legendary editor, Anna Wintour.<br /><br />The DVD includes director's commentary, deleted scenes, several Making-Of featurettes, and the trailer.</p></br><a href="../users/A34PAZQ73SL163.html">A34PAZQ73SL163</a><br/><p>I was torn between giving The Devil Wears Prada three or four stars as I found it very entertaining but admit to it being no stupendous work of art. An obvious point in its favor is the performance Meryl Streep who is infinitely believable and entirely owns her character. I say this as a person who knows nothing about fashion and nothing about Anna Wintour who may or may not the person Streep's character is a reflection of. Regardless of the veracity of the portrayal, Streep's work is absolutely amazing. With Anne Hathaway, she's an absolute doll for whom most men will find it impossible to turn away. She's quite charming and this contributes significantly to one's enjoyment of the movie. Independently though, I stand for any venture which accurately depicts what it is like to work with women. Yes, bosses like this one are highly unusual, but pretending that they don't exist is to embrace lies over truth.</p></br><a href="../users/A1COG8T9MPP3KA.html">A1COG8T9MPP3KA</a><br/><p>Ok I give it 3 1/2 stars. Totally predictable film. But charming in its own way. The character "Andrea" reminds me of Audrey Hepburn. Say what you want about Meryl Streep but she totally is great here, and you forget it is even Meryl Streep and believe she is the hard biting career driven woman that she portrays in the film. It also makes one think about ambition versus love. However, the "other lover" storyline was totally unnecessary and who would leave their cutie pie boyfriend for that self centered monster?</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>My wife and I, huge fans of `America's Next Top Model' and `Project Runway', were very excited about seeing this film.  Why it took us this long still baffles me, but as of Friday night we had the pleasure of seeing `The Devil Wears Prada' and let me just say that it was quite the pleasure.  Now, most if not all the praise has been heaped on the shoulders of Meryl Streep, and while she was outstanding, this film is more than just a Meryl painted canvas.  There are four brilliant performances in this film and they all are deserving of praise.<br /><br />First is Anne Hathaway who plays Andrea Sachs, a young aspiring journalist who takes a job working as Miranda Priestly assistant at `Runway Magazine'.  Anne Hathaway proves with her performance that she's all grown up.  No, that's not to take away from her more adult roles in more adult films like `Havoc' and the masterpiece `Brokeback Mountain', but here Anne proves that she can do adult comedy, not falling back into her teen goofiness that made her famous in `The Princess Diaries' but keeping everything smart and mature.  She has enough poise and grace to match wits with Miranda, and she does so elegantly.<br /><br />Next up is Emily Blunt who plays Emily, Miranda's first assistant (there are two, Andrea being the second).  Emily has worked her butt off to get to where she is, slaving for the unruly Priestly and it's all about to pay off with a trip alongside Miranda to Paris.  The only thing standing in her way is Andrea, for if Andrea fails miserably then it reflects poorly on Emily.  Emily Blunt turns out I think the best performance of the bunch for she has enough sass, enough attitude and enough wit to make her pop out from the screen and stand out no matter who is sharing the screen with her.<br /><br />Stanley Tucci also does wonderfully here as Nigel, Miranda's second in command.  He is there to make sure everything is perfect, and also help Andrea adjust.  Stanley always has done great backup work, playing second hand man to just about everyone, but here he really makes his performance his own and owns it.  He delivers some of the funniest lines in the film but he never feels like the `token gay guy'...he's needed in this film, not filler, and he commands his scenes and really stands out amidst the crowd.<br /><br />And then, of course, we have Meryl Streep who plays the ruthless tyrant known as Miranda Priestly.  What I was most impressed about was the way Meryl underplays every word, every emotion, every scene, which is not what I expected.  I really expected her to go all Glen Close and reincarnate Cruella but she didn't (thankfully) and instead turned out one of the most inspired performances of the year.  She must have had fun playing the snooty self absorbed and above all selfish editor-in-chief of `Runway'.  She lets us see inside her character briefly (when crying over another failed marriage) but her character is more about shutting off feeling in order to succeed and so we don't get to see the real Miranda because we're not supposed to.<br /><br />Carried by these four brilliant performances `The Devil Wears Prada' is a fabulous film that will make you laugh and make you smile and will impress almost anyone.  The script is brilliantly adapted from Lauren Weisberger's novel, and while it's not an exact replica (are any adaptations these days?) it carries the same wit but smoothes things out to make it more approachable and, in my eyes, more enjoyable.  Bravo!</p></br><a href="../users/A2SRZQU1SZG4RR.html">A2SRZQU1SZG4RR</a><br/><p>Meryl Streep is absolutely hilarious playing Miranda Priestly, the editor of the world famous fashion magazine "Runway". Along comes Andrea (Andi) Sachs for a job interview. She recently graduated from Northwestern University as a journalism major. Emily, the first assistant to Miranda, nearly snickers in Andrea's face as she looks her up and down and makes snobbish critical remarks about her unfashionable ordinairy clothes. Everyone in the office is calm, casual, and laid back until they learn Miranda Priestly is returning to the office when they go into "high alert".<br /><br />The grand entrance by Miranda is superb, her haughty but elegant manner is perfect, with one breath and in one single sentence she rattles off six or seven commands to her assisant. Everyone jumps to attention and gets into action ... Andrea's interview is nearly cut short when Miranda notes she lacks the fashion background Miranda is looking for. However Miranda is won over by Andi's sincere work ethic and despite misgivings hires her. As second assistant, Andi manages to pull off miracle after miracle to make things happen for Miranda. It is when she does the impossible: obtains a publisher's copy of the latest Harry Potter book for Miranda's twin daughters that Andi's star at Runway begins to rise but at a huge cost to her personal life. Through a series of most auspicious but unexpected events, it is Andi who goes to the spring Paris fashion show with Miranda and a very select group of Runway staff. In Paris Andi comes to terms with her own values and resolves some personal struggles about her job and what she wants from life ...<br /><br />The film is a parody about the serious competition which exists in the fashion and magazine publishing industries. The tensions, dramas, and back-stabbing are clearly evident. Dealing with the stresses and strains associated with trying to separate one's personal and professional life is very difficult. It becomes clear, the price of success means favoring work over family and friends . As Miranda Priestly said to Andi after returning from the spring Paris fashion show and as she stepped out from the limo amidst photographers and reporters: "They all want to be us" ... This film is most highly recommended - a sparkling gem of a film.

She gives such a commanding performance as the dominant impossible boss.  In fact there are several outstanding supporting characters such as Stanley Tucci.  He is priceless as the guy you love to hate.  A really good script, plus great actors equal a great movie!</p></br><a href="../users/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ.html">A12X2J7AVZ04IQ</a><br/><p>This could easily be dismissed as another "little-fish-in-a-big-pond" story, but the wonderful script and fine acting by all sets it high above the rest. Meryl Streep was terrific, though she was allowed to show a soft side a few times, which took away from the "bite" that may have been implied by the title. (I had a boss like that, but mine was meaner and showed less sensitivity). Streep is not the main character, however, and Anne Hathaway shows command in the central role. There's excellent support from Adrian Grenier, Stanley Tucci and Emily Blunt. The shots of New York City (and of Paris) are grand and impressive, and, as one would expect, the costume designs are stunning, though few are original for this film. David Frankel's direction kept things moving at a swift pace, and the DVD extras are entertaining and informative. I enjoyed "The Devil Wears Prada" very much.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>It's easy to dismiss this flick as fluff.  But men who would ordinarily sniff their noses should see this film as a primer to the psyche of women.  I went to see this film last summer when it was in the theatres with my fiancee(now wife).  What caused her to sit at the edge of her seat was not the story or the superb acting but the proliferation of high-end brand names (Gucci, etc.) and the parade of "Style" channel celebrities(Valentino? Who?).  It made me feel cheap for giving her a Coach handbag for her birthday.  What elevates this film is the excellent performances by the ensemble cast.  Meryl Streep as a high fashion Cruella De Ville gives a nuanced performance that is the stuff of legend.  Emily Blunt (should be Oscar nominated) follows close behind as Streep's snooty assistant.  The underrated Stanley Tucci as a magazine staffer gives a performance bereft of stereotype.  Anne Hathaway, probably inspired by the talent around her, holds her own with this talented cast.  To summarize, this flick is froth with substance.</p></br><a href="../users/A2WX1UESDOLXRE.html">A2WX1UESDOLXRE</a><br/><p>I read the book and loved it. Because I live in the Midwest, this isn't exactly a world that I'm exposed to, and it's a blast joining this fashion frenzied crowd for a few hundred pages. The same can be said of the movie. It's fun while it lasts. And what makes it so much fun is, duh, Meryl Streep. No one can stop talking about how excellent she is in this, even Anne Hathaway admits that Meryl steals the show. And she does. She's a sharp-tongued, fashionista, editor bitch, whose claws are permanently out and scratching at the eyes of her assitants and, well, anyone else around her that doesn't do exactly what she wants exactly the way she says.<br /><br />Hathaway plays Andrea, a bright-eyed college grad, who wants nothing more than to be a writer in NYC. How grand! She can't seem to get a writing job, but manages to snatch the job "a million girls would kill for"-- being the assitant to the demanding Miranda Priestly (Streep), editor of the hot and hip magazine called Runway. Andrea doesn't fit into this world of couture and makeup, a world where the new size 4 is a size 2, and size 6 (Andrea's size) is the new 14. Ouch. But Andrea is determined to stick it out, going so far as to alienate her boyfriend Nate (Adrien Grenier), her friends, her family, and herself, all so she can get her dream job-- because as everyone knows, one year serving Miranda means that she can hook you up with a job. ANYWHERE YOU WANT.<br /><br />Anne Hathaway is, as always, a likable personality. What little we see of Grenier is pleasing, if for the simple fact that he's so adorably messy and cute. Meryl Streep and Stanley Tucci (as the cliche gay guy who helps the clueless girl, though Tucci OWNS this role) are the show stealers. And I can't not mention Simon Baker. Just because he's hot. Oh, and his character does manage to be effective in the few minutes they give him on screen. Great soundtrack, cute story, biting wit-- what more can a girl ask for?? Hm... maybe the new Marc Jacobs bag??</p></br><a href="../users/A2HVL790PBWYTU.html">A2HVL790PBWYTU</a><br/><p>Pound for pound, no one lays on the vicious snark like a woman targeting another woman. THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA explores a corner of the cutthroat fashion industry, a nerve-wracking environment replete with competitive jealousies and general, all-around meanspiritedness. Into this world steps Anne Hathaway's character, Andrea "Andy" Sachs, an aspiring journalist eager to get a foot in the door. To gain invaluable experience, Andy interviews for a job as the assistant's assistant to the ridiculously demanding Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep), acclaimed head of the trend-setting Runway magazine.<br /><br />Andy is a size six, and this automatically makes her the brunt of mean jokes by those in her new work office. Andy comes from a down-to-earth place and sort of scoffs at her co-workers' unending obsession with haute couture. She promises her boyfriend cook Nate (Adrian Grenier) that she won't change. But of course she does. Andy loses her way.<br /><br />Meryl Streep submits yet another powerhouse performance as the film's dragon lady. Miranda Priestly is the sort of boss who can effortlessly, whimsically shatter an employee's self-esteem. I take in the twitchy reactions of those in her circle and how they tiptoe on eggshells whenever she's in the room, and even I start to sweat. But Meryl Streep is able to sneak in an echo of vulnerability. You may end up sympathizing with her a bit. This actress is just so consistently good.<br /><br />Stanley Tucci himself is masterful in another of his side character roles. I think every movie should have Stanley Tucci in it. Emily Blunt as Miranda Priestly's frazzled first assistant - and Andy's primary foil - is fun to watch, and she makes the most out of her thankless role. When THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA first released in 2006, Anne Hathaway was only then just starting to distance herself from her wholesome teen princess roles. So she was a question mark, going into this film, even with HAVOC and BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN in her rearview. No worries, she confidently steps into this post-Disney role, and she's quite good.<br /><br />Because there's something innately appealing about Hathaway. Even when her character does eventually sell out, you don't hate her. You're not mad-dogging her. You just want her to get back on track. The film easily develops a rooting interest for her. Her immediate boss, the first assistant, is so cruddy in her behavior towards Andy that Andy right away falls into that underdog slot. Except she overcomes that soon enough. Andy, who is brainy enough that she rejected Stanford Law to pursue her journalistic dreams, turns out to be endlessly resourceful in meeting Miranda Priestly's incessant, impossible demands. It's not too long before the first assistant is demoted. Yay for Andy. You could feel her getting more and more sucked into this seductive world. Her long-suffering boyfriend's patience is wearing thin.<br /><br />This film renders me a stranger in a strange land, forced to absorb exotic name brands like Prada, Valentino Garavani, Giorgio Armani, and others I would have to look up on Wiki. I desperately longed for someone to name drop the Gap or Old Navy or Fruit of the Loom, something familiar. Gratifyingly, the story drew me in. The acting fixated me to the screen. I laughed at the right bits and scornfully rolled my eyes at the sheer fanaticism these frantic characters invested in mere articles of clothing. I then went to sleep in my awesome grown-up Underoos.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ01Q3070LT29.html">AQ01Q3070LT29</a><br/><p>20th Century Fox presents The Devil Wears Prada (2006). Rated "PG-13". Running time: 1 hour, 49 mins.<br /><br /> Andrea Sachs (Anne Hathaway) is on a job interview to be an assistant for Runway Magazine in New York. She must survive in the business and according to the very stressed out First Assistant, Emily (Emily Blunt), who has an I-Can-Care-Less attitude, she was the Second Assistant until the other woman got a promotion. Now Emily is the First Assistant.<br />  The CEO, Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep), is about to enter the building. Everyone jumps to attention like a bunch of busy ants. Within seconds, the office is tidied up, papers and files in place, Miranda's drink is ready and everyone stands in their position. Andrea just stands there in awe of what is going on around her.<br /> Miranda enters the elevator. No one else is allowed in the elevator when Miranda arrives. Miranda rides it alone up to her floor.<br />  Miranda is interviewing Andrea only asking 4 questions of her then presumes Andrea does not have any style or sense of fashion. Feeling like she is getting the brush-off, Andrea continues to be nice and says something more factual about herself and her intentions at Runaway. She is suddenly interrupted by Nigel (Stanley Tucci) and is ignored. Andrea says "thank you" and walks away. As she leaves, Nigel calls her "a sad little person".<br />  She makes it to the lobby. Emily calls out to her and motions that she is hired, but rolls her eyes at Andrea like, "why was she hired".<br />  Well, what kind of work experience is this going to be for Andrea?<br /><br />Also in the cast: Adrian Grenier, Simon Baker.<br /> Cameo appearance by Valentino Garavani, Giancarlo Giammetti, Heidi Klum and others.<br /><br /> Audio Commentary with David Frankel, Mark Livolsi, Patricia Field, Aline Brosh McKenna, Wendy Finerman, Florian Ballhaus.<br /><br /> Starbucks get in-film advertising.<br /><br /> The J.K.

Its not a genre I regularly review but I'm gonna try my best. Meryl Streep is just a great actress, she can do anything. Period. She plays the boss from hell so perfectly that there is sympathy for Miranda when she has her little "heart to heart" near the end. Anne Hathaway proves she can do more than Disney films, convincingly leaving that part of her behind and stepping into a more mature role. She plays Andrea very well and she doesn't seem intimidated by Streep at all. Her portrayal as a girl who is naive about the world of fashion but gets sucked into the world of success and begins to lose everything around her is very well done. Stanley Tucci and Emily Blunt are also excellent supporting players in this, Blunt very handily playing the snob and Tucci as the helpful yet sarcastic fashion designer/consultant, whatever. The songs used in the film are superfluous and I wish they didn't have them. They're just really annoying. Well that's all I got on this one.</p></br><a href="../users/A126KX6FVI4T66.html">A126KX6FVI4T66</a><br/><p>The young journalist Andy gets a job as an assistant<br />to a fashion dictator and starts to learn about fashion and<br />how to get ahead in the world of New York.<br />Anne Hathaway is beautiful in her before and after<br />roles, but fashion is a very strange mix of art and snobbery<br />that travels better among the rich of the east<br />than the poor of the west.<br />People always feel that they have to dress the role<br />of their current movement, so changes in dress<br />follow the change in times.<br />Taste is another matter and probably can't be dictated<br />by plastic goddesses? The Quaker plain clothes and plain speaking for me.<br />I liked Hathaway, but despised this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2C5VLIJMDPWHI.html">A2C5VLIJMDPWHI</a><br/><p>From the first few minutes of the movie, I started groaning. I had a boss just like Miranda who worked at a production company I was trying to start a career with.  She was snippy, egotistical, and somehow didn't realize that the 13th amendment had passed.  I lasted three weeks and cursed that lady out so bad she didn't sleep that night.  Andy lasted a long time and I don't understand how, but boy was I entertained to watch her go.  This movie is about a woman who is a little disappointed that she didn't immediately make it as the writer she wanted to be, so she makes due by trying to be a fashion assistant to a major fashion company.  Along the way, Andy meets kiss-ups, fashion extraordinaires, jacks up her social life, and learns how to dress.  I fell on the floor when she asked a caller to spell a certain clothing line--classic entertainment.  A college buddy of mine told me I'd like this movie but it initially didn't look all that interesting to me.  Boy, was I wrong.  I loved it, even all the crude moments when she called this obviously slim woman "the fat girl."  I thought Andy's boyfriend was adorable, was curiously entertained by the guy who kept calling Andy "Size 6," and sadly, started to understand why Miranda was the way she was.  A professional woman wears many hats, and sometimes she's not always pleasant.  What a treat this film was.</p></br><a href="../users/A2QHM5HBSIXRL4.html">A2QHM5HBSIXRL4</a><br/><p>'Devil Wears Prada' ostensibly stars Anne Hathaway and Meryl Streep. Streep upholds her end of the bargain.  Her riff on Anna Wintour (Editor-in-Chief of the U.S. edition of Vogue) is an awesome sight to behold.  But Hathaway is outshone not only by Streep, but also by Emily Blunt.  In fact, Blunt - in conjunction with Streep - steals the movie.  She deserved that Golden Globe.  The line that absolutely killed me was:  "If you lose Paris for me, I will search every Blimpie's in the tri-state area till I find you."  Great line, perfect delivery.  Meanwhile, Hathaway is put in a bad place: she's forced to act in conjuction with Adrian Grenier, who's playing her boyfriend.  He's just totally 'blah' here, no other way to say it.</p></br><a href="../users/AG8U6F6226GBZ.html">AG8U6F6226GBZ</a><br/><p>First of all, I hate the comment "chick flick".  NO matter how good or bad a film is, it's always called a chick flick, if one or 2 women are in it, even if most of the characters are guys such as Jerry McGuire which is a film about a football!  This movie was total fantasy, but not nearly as good as SITC, because the plot was empty.  Meryl Streep makes an otherwise silly movie even though she's a villain and you can't stand her. Don't you just love it when she throws her coat and handbag all around for others to pick up after her. Insane.  Never seen any boss do that before. And if they did, I'd quit. One time I worked for an attorney who yelled at me in front of everybody.  I told him off in front of everybody, and quit on the spot.  Anyway, the way she talks soooo under her breath, and treats everybody as if they were invisible toads made her too one dimensional.  The cast was adequate, and all and all it tried to be an entertaining film, but it had no real plot.  Just a bunch of idiots dressing up in clothes to show off, that few people could pull off, unless they were models. Few people are.<br /><br />Little bit of Sex and the City flashbacks when Carrie went to work for Vogue and had a similar boss with Candice Bergen but Streep played the fashion queen much tougher and snobbish than Bergen.  Anyway, as mean as Streep played it, let's face it, she's made some damn good films. Meryl Streep can be anybody, but let's face it, she'll never be better than the "Choice" she made in "Sophie."</p></br><a href="../users/A1T17LMQABMBN5.html">A1T17LMQABMBN5</a><br/><p>I remember reading the novel by Lauren Weisberger and not being very impressed with it.  However, I heard wonderful things about the movie, and so I decided to give it a whirl.  The Devil Wears Prada is one entertaining surprise!  Andrea Sachs(Anne Hathaway) is a young woman who aspires to become a New York journalist.  But before she could do that, she has to settle for an assistant job at Runway magazine.  This is the job that every girl would kill for because it opens doors to many career opportunities.  The women who work there have to be chic, wear clothes no bigger than a size four and devoted fashionistas.  Which is why everyone is surprised when she is hired to be the second assistant to the infamous Miranda Priestley (Meryl Streep), editor-in-chief of Runway and a force to be reckoned with in the fashion industry.  Soon Andrea discovers what working for Miranda entails and that there is no pleasing the woman.  Her life is turned upside down and she's on the verge of losing her boyfriend and friends because her life is one-hundred percent devoted to her boss.  On the upside, she gets to wear lots of Chanel and Prada.<br /><br />I love how fun and entertaining this movie is.  I enjoyed Anne Hathaway, Meryl Streep, Emily Blunt and Stanley Tucci, but the one I enjoyed the most was the film's biggest star: fashion.  You get a wonderful backdrop of the fashion industry, fashion designers and the fashion magazine industry that is simply irresistible.  If you're not that into fashion, you will very likely be converted after watching this film (or at least you will become more conscious about the clothes you wear).  The outfits, purses and shoes shown here are beautiful and I wish I could afford to buy more Prada and Marc Jacobs.  I also loved the beautiful scenery of New York City and Paris (where Miranda and Andrea travel for fashion week).  The acting is also wonderful.  I'd seen Hathaway in The Princess Diaries and it was nice to see her in a more grown-up role.  Emily Blunt as the snooty English first assistant and Tucci as the sarcastic fashionista are fun as well.  But the best one without a doubt is Meryl Streep.  She once again proves why she's considered to be one of the best actresses of all time.  Her portrayal of Miranda Priestley is controlled and subtle.  Other actresses would taken the easy route with this role and have Miranda behave like a complete diva who shouts and snaps her fingers at people.  Meryl, however, played Miranda with a quiet confidence and elegant prose that made the character all the more intimidating and hateful.  The character itself is one-dimensional, as she was in the book, but Streep played her beautifully.  I cannot recommend The Devil Wears Prada enough.  If you were a big fan of Sex and the City and subscribe to Vogue magazine, this film is for you!</p></br><a href="../users/AZCDCO6KK2T81.html">AZCDCO6KK2T81</a><br/><p>The hype around this film really made me believe that I was going to see a dynomite and insighful film on the clothing industry.  It was insightful at times, but never a dynomite film.  Now don't get me wrong here.  I liked the movie; however, I was disapppointed.<br /><br />Meryl Streep was very convincing in her role which could have easily been played with over-the-top gusto like a Cruella De Ville stereotype, but Streep down plays the role while still commanding the screen.  We see her weakness at times with a passing glance or eyes red from crying.  She has always been a versatile actress and will probably get another Oscar nod for this film and it is deserving (although she will lose to Helen Mirren's "Queen" role).<br /><br />Anne Hathaway has played this role to death in a number of other films, but here she is more believable as she has grown as an actress.  She is a bit more jaded now and less pure; hence, her jumping in the sack with the good-looking journalist less than a day after breaking up with her childish, self-absorbed boyfriend who never supported her much (just like her friends who loved all the goodies she brought them, but wanted her to not succeed without them in tow --what a dislikable lot they were).<br /><br />This leads to me to ambiguous theme of the film.  I got the distinct impression that I was being lectured that one can't have a successful career and still have family and friends.  This theme is handled in a rather heavy handed manner.  I might buy into it if Andrea's friends were more likable, less self-absorbed, and, frankly, less jealous.  They seem to come across as that crowd that sneers at success while wanting it themselves.  Andrea herself starts out that way.  Even her boyfriend at the end of the film tells Andrea of this great new job in Boston that is everything he's always wanted as if expecting her to cheer him on when he never really supported her much.  Granted that Andrea's job did rob her of time with family and friends and being the assistant to anyone famous does often require that sacrifice; however, I feel that success in general is being condemn in this film.  Being successful doesn't always mean in league with the "devil".<br /><br />Well, regardless of all that opinionated stuff I just spewed out, I really did like this film.  It wasn't all I had hoped, but it was good.  Streep is reliable as always and saves the role from stereotype, Hathaway proves she is a "grown up" actress now, and the ever wonderful Stanley Tucci, is solid support as the one who appropriately dislikes Andrea for not liking a job others would die for and for her attitude about the whole business.  All his petty little insults seems to be done with a wink as if deep down he actually likes Andrea for not being intimidated by Streep's Miranda and a business she herself knows little about.  He does a believable 180 when Andrea does the same.  It's a case of mutual respect here and it worked very well in the film.  In fact, it was my favorite aspect of the film.  To each his own.<br /><br />I do recommend the film, just go into for the "fluff" entertainment it is supposed to be.  Don't get pulled into all the 4 and 5 star reviews and claims of an exhilirating, hilarious time.  It simply won't measure up to that hype.  Well, at least it didn't to this reviewer.</p></br><a href="../users/A3QJU4FEN8PQSZ.html">A3QJU4FEN8PQSZ</a><br/><p>... flawed by its inclusion of the usual cliches - missing significant other's birthday party because the boss needs you to do something actually relatively important, for instance - what kind of a choice is that? Does that really show that the protaganist is circling the drain? What is she supposed to choose? Is Hollywood insane? The self-righteous friends and requisite token minorities are also included. Except for the Asian contingent. They need to complain more, I suppose.<br /><br />But it's an otherwise entertaining look at the world of fashion and fashion publishing, with Streep as a driven taskmaster whose every whim is catered to. This she plays to perfection. Stanley Tucci is endearing as the mentor figure. And the part of the "number one" aide is played to comedic perfection, especially a hilarious head-shaking response.</p></br><a href="../users/AXOS8IWBXNZGT.html">AXOS8IWBXNZGT</a><br/><p>I've been to and fro on Northwest so often recently, that I'm running out of movies to watch while in transit. So, I had been avoiding watching this film, until this most recent trip. I was pleasantly surprised...it wasn't as bad as I thought it might be. The film centers on two characters, played by Anne Hathaway and Meryl Streep. MS does a fantasic job of playing the editor of a fashion magazine similar to Vogue, who is very much the dragon lady you might expect. AH does a great job of playing a young graduating journalist who falls into the fashion world as MS's assistant, and suffers accordingly, but then goes through a transformation that she doesn't really understand is going on at first, and then later is very unhappy with. I was expecting vacuous, but this film wasn't that.</p></br><a href="../users/A1WUMTJOASEL5F.html">A1WUMTJOASEL5F</a><br/><p>It's Working Girl all over again with an overbearing boss this time in the world of fashion design.

It is this revelation which makes the successful secretary drop everything, when accused of doing or walking over anybody to simply get ahead. Well made moral, and makes you wonder who the real lucky ones are in the scheme of things. The Miranda's, or the typical everyman.</p></br><a href="../users/A1F2EYORWOZ3G1.html">A1F2EYORWOZ3G1</a><br/><p>Okay, I read the other reviews here. And... quite honestly I think some people are missing the point to this story.<br /><br />This is really the story of Andrea and how she learned what it sometimes takes in this world to move on and up. There are those things we strive toward in life and along the way others have to be discarded. Simple fact of life.<br /><br />Meryl Streep is exquisite as the consummate bitch (as good a job as in 'The Manchurian Candidate' but with a twist). The acting, filming, story and music all come together in this one.<br /><br />Meryl senses something in Andrea which is revealed toward the end of the film. She takes her on and teaches her what it takes in the industry to get to where she got.<br /><br />When Andrea finally realizes her 'job' was actually a lesson and what that lesson was, she walks away from it. But she has gained more insight into herself and discovered what she felt she could never do... she had already done. The name of the game is survival.<br /><br />On the surface this is a well played out dromedy. But it does have a deeper message and all the characters in the movie are easily identified with.<br /><br />Saving going into detail here..... forget the movie is about the fashion industry and watch it. There are life lessons, albeit tough ones, taught here. Watch the interactions and growth in the group of characters and you will be nicely suprised.<br /><br />I don't believe any other movie has played this theme out as well, and as cleverly as this one.<br /><br />Not to be missed!</p></br><a href="../users/AW99SBGWEXP0J.html">AW99SBGWEXP0J</a><br/><p>Andy Sachs (Hathaway) applies for the job of second assistant to Miranda Priestly (Streep), the editor of "Runway" magazine.  "Runway" is THE magazine for the fashion industry, and Andy has no fashion sense.  Miranda is revered by all who know her.  She has the power to make or break people in the industry, and she is not afraid to use this power.  Work for her for a year, and countless doors will open.  Of course, others like Emily (Blunt), Miranda's number one assistant and Nigel (Tucci) have become fixtures at the magazine, while waiting for those doors to open.<br /><br />Miranda hires Andy on a whim, hoping she has what it takes despite her appearance.  Andy dislikes the shallowness of her coworkers, but soon finds herself becoming more like them.  Will she get sucked into that lifestyle, or will she me able to resist and remain true to herself?<br /><br />Meryl Streep makes this movie work, and is the prime reason to see it.  She dominates every scene she is in.  She is both cruel and funny, sometimes at the same time.  Hathaway, Tucci, and Blunt are also very good, especially when playing off of each other.  This is definitely a "chick flick", but is entertaining and really funny at times.  Not everyone's cup of tea, but worth giving a shot.</p></br><a href="../users/A18G7GG53G2X8A.html">A18G7GG53G2X8A</a><br/><p>What I enjoyed most about "The Devil Wears Prada" is that it's an intelligent movie. It maintains a sense of humor without getting juvenile or patronizing, and in an odd sort of way, it indirectly teaches the audience a valuable life lesson. Specifically, it states that you should live the life you truly want to live. I know how hokey that sounds, considering most go to the movies to be entertained. They rarely go to be given a positive message. But this film had that kind of effect on me, and as strange as it may seem, I actually feel better for having seen it. I initially didn't think I could appreciate a story revolving around the fashion industry. I've never been a part of that world, and I have no idea if its representation in this movie is accurate. But as it progressed, I began to see the big picture, one that has nothing to do with fashion. It has to do with maintaining personal integrity in the midst of a cutthroat world.<br /><br />In that sense, this movie can be viewed as a satire. But that may be too much of a stretch, because it's one of the subtlest satires I've ever seen. That's because nothing about it is over the top, despite the quirky circumstances and the one of a kind characters. Even Meryl Streep's performance as demonically career-oriented Miranda Priestly isn't overdone. However, her character does have some distinctly caricature-like qualities: she's the impatient, capricious, and cynical editor of the fashion magazine "Runway," and she demands much out of her employees. Most of the time it's almost too much, and they are barely able to keep up. (Why else would she be notorious for firing assistants?) Yet she expresses herself quietly and calmly, as if she were completely emotionless. Granted, that kind of demeanor does nothing to lessen the tension her presence inevitably causes. Despite a dedicated staff, it seems that no one is capable of handling such a difficult person.<br /><br />Then enters Andy Sachs (Anne Hathaway), a recent college graduate who hopes a job at a magazine will help her on her way to becoming a journalist. The moment she enters the magazine's main New York office, she's bombarded by flurries of activity and demeaning remarks about her sense of fashion (which she receives a lot during the course of the movie). The first person she meets is Emily (Emily Blunt), an outwardly snobby but inwardly insecure British girl who has just been promoted to First Assistant. She clearly doesn't take Andy seriously, and she doesn't expect Miranda will, either. When Miranda and Andy meet for the first time, we're led to believe that Emily was right in how Miranda would feel. Before that day, Andy had never read "Runway," nor did she know whom Miranda was. Why should she take part in a magazine she's completely unfamiliar with? Andy leaves the office feeling rejected, thinking it was a complete waste of time. So imagine her surprise when Emily stops her in the lobby and tells her she's been hired.<br /><br />Thus begins an absolutely whirlwind journey for Andy. She's asked to do a multitude of menial tasks, such as bringing Miranda coffee, picking up articles of clothing, answering the phone, taking messages, and setting up various appointments (among other things). She quickly learns that everything has to be done perfectly and in a timely fashion. Any mishaps or delays meet with intense, ego-shattering criticism, not only from Miranda, but from the other employees, as well. Emily's attempts to brief Andy on technical skills and proper behavior are almost degrading, especially when she gloats about accompanying Miranda to Paris in the spring (for an important fashion show, no less). Encounters with Nigel (Stanley Tucci)--Miranda's wardrobe manager--almost always lead to wisecracks about Andy's figure (she's a size six, which is practically obese in the fashion world). However, their attacks actually do more to teach Andy than they do to defeat her. Gradually, she comes to understand just how this industry works, and to everyone's surprise, she adapts herself accordingly. She wears the correct clothing and dons the appropriate shoes, all the while working to earn the respect of her coworkers (and hopefully Miranda).<br /><br />But there is one thing she fails to learn: she's paying a pretty high price for success. Being at the mercy of a ruthless boss is driving a wedge between her and her social life, especially when it comes to her boyfriend, Nate (Adrian Grenier). From his point of view, she's trying to make herself fit into a preconceived image, in turn making her forget who she really is. The Andy who wore regular, unfashionable street clothes was the woman he loved; she was fun, energetic, and she knew what she wanted to accomplish. But now she wears chic, expensive clothing with gaudy accessories, and she's too busy to spend time with anyone (it reaches a crescendo when she misses Nate's birthday). She's basically trying to reach an impossible standard of beauty, all in the name of success. She initially defends herself, but she eventually realizes that she's sold her soul to the Devil (hence the meaning behind the title).<br /><br />That's when everything suddenly gets complicated for Andy, especially since Miranda is learning to trust her on a deeper level. She now has privileges most new assistants never come close to earning, including access to a mock up fashion book and no longer having to hang up Miranda's coat and bag. She's even offered Emily's ticket to Paris (I won't say if she actually accepts it). However, Andy is still expected to complete difficult tasks, all of which are getting more and more outrageous; at one point, Miranda asks her to obtain the unpublished manuscript of the next "Harry Potter" novel (a gift for her twin daughters who refuse wait for its actual publication). The time eventually comes when Andy has to seriously consider what she wants out of life. She also has to decide whom she wants to share it with; in light of the problems she's having with Nate, she finds herself attracted to Christian Thompson (Simon Baker), the seductive and high profile editor of another New York magazine.<br /><br />All of the relationships in this movie--be it professional, romantic, or friendly--are complex, a quality I found appropriate given the way real relationships work. No one in this film is a flat, undeveloped stereotype. Even Miranda, as hardened as she is, has another side to her; you might even call it a softer side (but I'm using the word "softer" loosely, here). Hidden within these various sides is the key to understanding why the character interactions are so important. Essentially, they're important because everyone's concerned about their current lives and their futures. To give a few examples, Nate wants to be a chef, Emily wants to be respected, and Nigel wants the freedom to think for himself. To some extent, we root for all the characters.<br /><br />But the one we root for the most is Andy, who wants nothing more than to continue writing articles as a real journalist. In witnessing her struggle with the fashion industry, we learn something valuable: we need to be true to ourselves if we want to achieve our goals. It's that aspect of "The Devil Wears Prada" that made it an enjoyable movie. While it may not be inspiring enough to change your life, it at least gets you to think about the direction your life is going in. I think everyone needs to do that from time to time. If it takes a movie of wit and wisdom to make that possible, then so be it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VIOCJZ22JZXT.html">A3VIOCJZ22JZXT</a><br/><p>This is a very entertaining film that explores many of the situations that young adults must master on their way to understanding themselves and their goals in life.  Primarily this means how to balance work demands and the demands of family and friends. I personally think that the years following college graduation and the first successes and failures in business help a young adult clarify their values and the path or direction they wish to take their life. In this regard, The Devil Wears Prada, is right on the money.<br /><br />Anne Hathaway does a great job playing recent college graduate, Andrea, who takes a job as second assistant to a highly demanding supervisor. Meryl Streep, as editor Miranda Priestly, does a superb job of playing a driven, workaholic, creative power-broker in the fashion industry. Strep's performance was captivating yet not 'over the top'. She never was a cartoon witch, just incredibly demanding and self absorbed. The fact that Meryl Streep can take a character that is totally unique and bring out the vulnerable human qualities attests to her superior acting skills. Watching Streep play the Machiavellian diva is worth the price of the DVD.<br /><br />So what happens to little innocent Andrea? She gradually takes the challenge of trying to please the totally unpleasable Miranda. She gradually masters her job and the field of fashion. She also gradually begins to edge out first assistant, Emily Blunt. Blunt is also superb as she trys to imitate her hateful boss, yet always a softer side comes through. Handsome Daniel Sunjata plays a young designer, dependent on Miranda's good graces and opionion. He is willing to change an entire line of his designs to please her.<br /><br />Simon Baker as a jet set journalist, Stanley Tucci as Miranda's second in command, and Adrian Grenier as Anne's college boy friend, Nate, all allow Andrea to see herself as other see her and as she is gradually becoming. Andrea is almost lost, until she discovers that Miranda's position is in jeapardy, and she comes to the loyal defense of a woman most folks consider to be a monster. But Miranda was already aware of the coup, and is willing to double cross her second in command to remain in power. Andrea gets a glimps into the driven inside dynamics of Miranda and at some point realizes she doesn't want this future - even if she may have the instict and brains for such a world. In the end, Andrea makes the right moves, she does not fall for the chaos and competition, and gets her life and love back.<br /><br />You will remain entertained by the beautiful cast, Hathaway and Streep's superb performances, and the stunning designer clothes Hathaway shows us throughout the second half of the film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>The Devil Wears Prada starring Meryl Streep, Anne Hathway, and Emily Blunt is deliciously sinful. Streep has never played such a feisty, fearless, and bitchy character! And by the way honey, a size 6 is not fat (thank you very much!) Hathway brings vunerability and strength to her character, Blunt is hilarious as well as she tries to dodge unwanted criticism from Miranda (Streep).  The Devil Wears Prada can be mean at times but the somwewhat sappy ending makes up for it. Great fashion, clever story, and an outstanding cast is what you'll get from this summer blockbuster. Have fun!</p></br><a href="../users/A2PNTEDGMOLMOY.html">A2PNTEDGMOLMOY</a><br/><p>"The Devil Wears Prada," based on the famously-hilarious novel, is a fairly conventional, if glossy, coming of age tale.  Despite a pretty funny script (watered down from the book) and the usual acting talent present in a major Hollywood production (Anne Hathaway in the title role, Stanley Tucci as a flamboyant designer, etc.), the movie is saved from mediocrity by the performance of Meryl Streep.<br /><br />This wonderful actor, who made her name in such "difficult" movies as "The French Lieutenant's Woman" and "Kramer versus Kramer," sinks her teeth into the role of Miranda Priestley, the editor in chief of "Runway," a fashion magazine.  Priestley has dyed her hair the charming color of steel on a cold day and is one of the leading lights of the fashion world.  She also is the most demanding and unreasonable boss since Kevin Spacey in "Swimming With Sharks."  To say that Streep takes on this role with glee is an understatement.<br /><br />But Priestley is the villain of this piece (or is she . . .).  The heroine is Andrea Sachs (Ms. Hathaway).  A recent graduate of Northwestern University and editor of the prestigious student paper, Ms. Sachs has come to New York with hopes of writing for Vanity Fair or The New Yorker.  Thanks to the screenplay, Andrea gets a job that she doesn't want but is one - as she is told repeatedly - that "a million girls would kill for."  This is one of those "too-good-to-be-true" situations one encounters only on movies or TV - kind of like the apartment on "Friends."  But it's needed as a plot device - you couldn't tell a coming-of-age story about a girl who knew that a million girls got the job and still got the job, because that girl knows how the world works.<br /><br />So commences the education of Andrea.  At first, Andrea - like many in the audience - looks down on the fashion world as super-silly fluff.  Things begin to change as she sees what a dynamic business mind Miranda has, and also when Miranda gives Andrea the detailed fashion history of the frumpy blue sweater she wore to work that day.  Eventually, Andrea sees the light, and after a helpful fashion lesson from Stanley Tucci, starts to wear great clothes and also stop eating so she can become a reasonably satisfactory size 4.<br /><br />This sets up a typical scenario where Andrea starts to lose her old friends to the demands of her job.  Her boyfriend - who looks 18 but will end up becoming the sous chef for a pretigious restaurant (yeah, right) - is typically unsupportive.  The only friend who showed promise was a guy who showed an unnerving fascination with fashion, but that subplot goes nowhere.  But these friends serve as the counterpoint to Miranda, setting up the ultimate choice for Andrea - who does she want to be?  Rich, famous and unhappy, like Miranda?  Or herself?  Ten cents if you guess who she wants to be.<br /><br />Ultimately, this is what is unsatisfying about the movie.  Miranda is not unhappy - she loves who she is and wouldn't be anyone else.  It's just for Miranda, things like a marriage come second.  But we never get a sense of who Andrea wants to be - she's nice, but we see nothing of what animates her as a journalist.  Does she want to be a globe-trotting foreign correspondent?  A literary critic?  An advice columnist?  We are left to wonder, but then we already know that we are more interested in Miranda than Andrea anyway.<br /><br />A fine movie for the younger set - a lot of young people could benefit from even the most shallow bit of introspection.  But if you're looking for a great movie, skip "The Devil Wears Prada."  That is, unless you want to watch Meryl Streep give a master's class in acting.</p></br><a href="../users/A22TZUXUKA11SQ.html">A22TZUXUKA11SQ</a><br/><p>The Devil Wears Prada was an okay book, but the movie fell short of the mark. It wasn't really funny, the added plot elements added nothing to the story, and the best thing about the movie was the clothes. It's kind of disappointing how lackluster this film was, especially considering how much it was hyped. It's basically like a cheap Sex and the City without the comedic banter. Meryl Streep was excellent in her portrayal of the Anna Wintour-esque Mirande Priestley, but that alone doesn't make this film worth watching. I'd just wait for it to come on HBO and not waste the money.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IOJE0W1NXOSE.html">A1IOJE0W1NXOSE</a><br/><p>This movie revolves around Meryl Streep (Miranda), the editor of a prestigious fashion magazine who is, to all intents and purposes, the worst boss ever.  She is cold, cruel, demanding, rude, and altogether wonderful in this part.  Her counterpart is Andy, played by Anne Hathaway, who is hired as Miranda's second assistant despite the fact that she is a size 6 (gasp!) who has no fashion sense and very little interest in the fashion industry.  Her goal is to become a journalist and this job is just a stepping stone along the way.  Andy's honesty and earnest attitude gain Miranda's respect and soon she is transformed into a fashionable, workaholic who sacrifices her friends and social life in order to be at Miranda's beck and call.  She goes along with Miranda's plan to reduce the influence of the first assistant, and thus becomes a full-fledged Junior Miranda.  This is an entertaining movie, slickly produced and wonderfully acted.  Meryl Streep plays Miranda with an understated elegance and feline grace, her humanity lying deep within her cold exterior, only allowed to show through in one brief scene.  As always, Meryl Streep makes this character into someone truly memorable, and the movie well worth seeing.</p></br><a href="../users/A9LAPV8XNKZVZ.html">A9LAPV8XNKZVZ</a><br/><p>But Streep is gold. The lady actually builds some sympathy for a character that could have been a stereotype. Some decent laughs.</p></br><a href="../users/A3HM5G9IV1FTFP.html">A3HM5G9IV1FTFP</a><br/><p>"The Devil Wears Prada" is an example of how the right talent can help elevate somewhat trite material into an enjoyable and decent film. The script itself is really a very straightforward "fish out of water" story of a young aspiring journalist named Andi who takes a job at a high fashion magazine called "Runway". In order to survive and adapt, she has to learn to accommodate her ruthless boss, Editor-in-chief Miranda Priestly, and an environment full of snotty fashionistas. And, of course, along the way she learns important lessons about what she wants out of life.<br /><br />Meryl Streep, arguably the greatest film actress ever, chews up the scenery as vicious, powerful, unapologetic Miranda. One scene, in which Miranda is able to destroy a designer's spirits simply by curling her lip subtly at the sight of one of his dresses, is especially telling. However, a lot of credit also belongs to Anne Hathaway. There are few young actresses who could act alongside Meryl Streep without being blown off the screen, but she not only stands her ground but delivers a subtle, charming, comic performance as a smart, yet naive, everygirl facing her first taste of the grownup world. Streep and Hathaway save the film from mediocrity and help make it a charming, lightweight comedy.</p></br><a href="../users/A3JPFWKS83R49V.html">A3JPFWKS83R49V</a><br/><p>Based on Lauren Weisenberg's book from 2003, The Devil Wears Prada is a fairly good film that follows a naive young woman on her journey from a small town to New York City where she gets hired to work for a popular fashion magazine. This movie is one of a handful of films directed by David Frankel- a man best known for his directorial involvement in various television series and in a few films.<br /><br />The Devil Wears Prada has many of the cliches one would expect in a film that follows an unoriginal plot but it also offers some interesting twists and some excellent performances. The story of a naive small town girl who moves to New York in search of a big career is an old theme for a movie but Devil Wears Prada succeeds more often than it doesn't and it turns out to be an acceptable film.<br /><br />A large part of this movie is spent dealing with Meryl Streep's Miranda character; detailing her ruthless, uncaring persona as she verbally degrades her workers and has everyone around her walking on eggshells. I found myself enthralled with Streep more than anyone else in the film because once again, she excels in every possible way. Like always, Streep is excellent in this role and she is the main reason I recommend watching this movie. Her Miranda character is cold, insensitive, and arrogant, but not as completely obnoxious as she could be. Miranda never raises her voice and often expresses herself very effectively without saying a word. Streep deserves all the credit for making this character so enjoyable to watch and she, alone, makes the movie worth viewing.<br /><br />All of the other performers are very good in this film, including Anne Hathaway in the lead role, Stanley Tucci, Emily Blunt, and others. It was interesting to watch Hathaway's character as she stumbles into this job with a fashion magazine, hoping to use it as a stepping stone to a career in journalism. She changes many things about herself simply to please those around her in the business and ultimately sacrifices much of her personal life. This is the type of situation I cannot personally relate to, but I can think of several individuals who have walked down this same treacherous road, expecting great things in the professional sense but giving up their own personal identity in the process.<br /><br />Where Devil Wears Prada falls short is with the screenplay and the lack of deeper examination of the fashion and publishing industries. A great motion picture could be made about a subject like this but David Frankel decides to keep Devil Wears Prada on the simple side. The movie does a good job with its cross examination of that sensitive area where personal lives and business lives cross each other but it doesn't go far enough to be considered a classic film.<br /><br />Overall, Devil Wears Prada is a good movie with some funny moments but mostly a serious message about work and play. The movie reminds me in some ways of the hit series Sex in the City (David Frankel directed some of the Sex in the City shows) and it succeeds mostly because of the performances- especially that of Hollywood veteran Meryl Streep. Take Meryl Streep out of this picture and you would have another second- rate run of the mill movie destined for ever growing Hollywood bin of mediocrity. But with Streep performing so well and the rest of the cast contributing very good performances as well, Devil Wears Prada turns out to be a good enough film to recommend.</p></br><a href="../users/ATS1HA5M3EPZ4.html">ATS1HA5M3EPZ4</a><br/><p>Ok, I know what Prada is...sort of.  I couldn't pick one out of a line up to save my life but I know it's a fashion line...of shoes, or purses or something.  In any case, I watched this film with my wife because it looked entertaining.  I'm a movie buff and Anne Hathaway is not only cute but she's a talented force coming up through the ranks of Hollywood.  After seeing her in Brokeback mountain, I wanted to see what else she was in (besides the Disney Princess flicks).<br /><br />I was not disappointed.  She gives a great performance as Andrea Sachs, a straight forward girl from the mid-west who applies for a position as second assistant to Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep), the Satanesque Editor in Chief of Runway, a fashion magazine of Godzilla like proportions.  She aspires to be a journalist, not a fashion editor, so she is shocked to find that it's a dream job for many and that if she can hold out for a year she can work anywhere she wants.<br /><br />The unfolding of the film's message is subtle, showing how when one gets ahead in the business they thereby loose everything else in their life, arguably including their soul.  As she starts out snubbing the industry, she soon learns she has to integrate herself in order to make it work (when in Rome...).  Things start to fall apart in her personal life though; her friends loose interest, her boyfriend complains she isn't around anymore and they have nothing in common.  This is done without them becoming unreasonable jerks as well.<br /><br />As for the other performers; Streep runs away with the movie in whatever scene she's in.  Her low key and delicate approach to the character instead of being a high volume demanding taskmaster is brilliant.  Anyone can be a screaming bitch, but Streep puts class in her strut and her dialogue showing why she is one America's premier actresses.  She's a blast to watch but you want to kill her at the same time.<br /><br />Other notable performances include Emily Blunt as the first assistant, Simon Baker as the journalist who may help Andy get her foot in the journalism door and most especially Stanley Tucci, brilliantly playing Miranda's right hand man and lead fashion expert.<br /><br />The movie is very entertaining and a good story that is very relatable to most.  It is thankfully NOT about fashion, or it would have lost me five minutes into the movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1U6B2LDK3BUVU.html">A1U6B2LDK3BUVU</a><br/><p>This movie does not accurately reflect the tone of the book, as a result of a very conscious decision not to do so.<br /><br />The concept of the book is that Andy's boss is "the devil".  She's awful.  She's a nightmare of a boss.  She intimidates all of her employees.  She is not just demanding with them, she is sadistic with them.  She lies to them, puts them through hell for her own amusement, constantly berates them, breaks them down, wrecks them.<br /><br />Meryl Streep in the movie is nothing like that.  She is the Disney version.  She is Carol Burnett at that time of the month, a bit cranky.<br /><br />The book's title villain could best be played by that snippy British lady who hosted The Weakest Link.  She would be perfect for the role of Miranda Priestly.<br /><br />If she were not available for the movie, I'd cast Cruella DeVille in the role.  She hasn't had a decent starring role since knocking us dead with 101 Dalmatians.<br /><br />The book made a statement about the fashion industry being a bad influence on young girls, turning them into self hating anorexics.  The movie did no such thing, and in fact took it in the opposite direction, showing a very positive image of the fashion industry.<br /><br />The most entertaining part of the book was simply left out.  I loved when Andy tried to get into her office building, in a mad hurry, loaded down with four Starbucks coffees and a few dozen scarves, and the security guard at the entrance locked the turnstile, refusing to let her in the building until she sang to him.  I can't believe they left that out.  It was the most fun thing in the book.  And it also set up the big finish in the book, when this same security guard showed respect for Andy as he played with the new girl in the same way he used to tease Andy.<br /><br />All in all, I wish they were truer to the book, because I think it was a very good book.  The movie was good in its way, and had a good ending, but I really wish that these film people would show more respect for the original author and I wish they didn't Disnify things.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ.html">A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ</a><br/><p>Overall, this is a pretty good film, with Anne Hathaway as Andy Sachs, the recent college grad trying to break into journalism who takes the only available job as junior assistant to the high-powered editor of the leading fashion magazine. She's earnest, and cute, and bright -- but Meryl Streep as Miranda Priestly, queen of fashionistas and priestess of the Dark Side of the Force, is spectacular. As the tagline says, Miranda is "hell on wheels." Sadistic, hyper-demanding, not knowing when to quit, lacking in the most basic humanity, willing to blow another marriage, happy to sacrifice everything and everyone around her, convinced that no one else in the universe is capable of doing her job. And yet "a million girls would kill" for Andy's job. It takes awhile, but Andy eventually (of course) discovers she's becoming too much like Miranda and manages to save herself at the last minute.

The job description - to be available for her boss 365/24/7 and to be ready for the labors that even the legendary Hercules would not be able to accomplish.<br /><br />The movie about fashion industry is always fun to watch and "The Devil Wears Prada" is not an exception. I loved the look, the clothes, the shoes (OMG!!), the bags, the clips from the fashion shows. Stanley Tucchi is memorable in the supporting role - this guy is seriously underrated. Anne Hathaway is very likable and she's got beautiful eyes and lips. But THE main reason to see the movie is Meryl Streep who reigns and over-towers everything in it as the Uber-[...] Miranda Priestly. She should play the roles like that more often. Big thumbs up! She looked very sexy too. What I did not like - in the film her Miranda comes up somehow sympathetic. In the book she was totally heartless, self-obsessed and manipulating. There are some changes in the script comparing to the book that make Andy's final decision rather unconvincing. What happened in the book made it much more believable. When it comes to the story and the reasons for Andy's feeling guilt, the movie gets weak. I did not see any betrayal or losing the integrity or selling the soul there. Quoting a friend, "She did NOT manipulate or back stab or undermine her co-worker. She did a better job. And was rewarded. That is NOT betrayal." And one more thing - why did her friend make such a big deal out of Andy's rather innocent conversation with Christian Thompson at the Art show? With all these "serious" conflicts, the movie should be called "Much Ado About Nothing". Once again, bravo to Meryl Streep for her fantastic performance.</p></br><a href="../users/AJMU8VVFKMZI4.html">AJMU8VVFKMZI4</a><br/><p>Meryl Streep was absolutely astounding in this movie.  I'm not a fashionista or even pretend to understand the whoopla surrounding that world.  However, TDWP is a character study movie that entertains and spins out some life lessons.  I do agree with Andrea's take.  If Miranda was a man no one would have said jack about his impossible demands or even blink of what is sacrificed for the sake of success in the business world.  Andrea's ugly ducking transformation is but a small part of the movie.  And frankly if she thinks the rules are any different in the world of hard hitting journalism then she's in for another eye opening experience.  Tucci was also equally impressive in his performance.  But over all I think the screenwriters and the director did a remarkable job on such mediocre "best selling" book.  I love how in the special features section the trip to the big screen that they all but admitted that the book was just one dimensional.  Over all.

Andy, who has never heard of the magazine or Miranda Priestly before her interview, is bewildered as she watches the Runway staff frantically running around in an effort to be ready when Miranda arrives early to work that day.  Also, Andy doesn't make a very good impression due to the lack of fashion sense that she apparently has.  However, though Miranda is initially not impressed with Andy, Andy taking an opportunity to speak up for herself ears her the privilege of working for Miranda in addition to Miranda's other personal assistant Emily (Emily Blunt).  Though thousands of women allegedly would do anything to work for Miranda, Andy's enthusiasm for the job is not great as she comes to grips with running errands such as getting coffee, buying scarves or some other odd, if not impossible, task (such as obtaining a copy of an unpublished "Harry Potter" novel) that Miranda expects to be completed usually sooner than is possible.  Andy is also reminded by Miranda, Emily and other Runway staff, such as Nigel (Stanley Tucci), that she dresses terribly and really isn't taking the job seriously.  Not wanting to be fired, Andy starts to make a greater effort to fit in as a Runway employee, which includes getting an entirely new wardrobe of top-designer fashions, but not with the approval of her boyfriend Nate (Adrian Grenier) or her other friends.<br /><br />All in all, with good writing, brilliant acting (Meryl Streep earned an Oscar nomination for Best Actress), good direction under David Frankel and engaging characters, "The Devil Wears Prada" is a very entertaining film that earns 4 out of 5 stars.  Though ostensibly a chick-flick, many men may not enjoy watching this film; but anyone who has had a difficult manager to work for will probably get a good laugh.</p></br><a href="../users/A1PW6G3EFXCLFJ.html">A1PW6G3EFXCLFJ</a><br/><p>First of all, Meryl Streep is great in THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA (and hence the three stars) as the tough edit-in-chief of Runway, a top fashion mag. Andrea is hired as her first assistant and is, initially, thought of as a fat and unfashionable new hire. Which is quite ridiculous because she looks sleek and quite well dressed to me. Anyway, the moral of this film (and anyone can see this coming) is that capitalists are unhappy if rich and, to be truly happy and save your relationships and your soul, you need to be an artist, sous chef or work for a newspaper. This is just another version of the usual Hollywood liberal propaganda against competition, hard work, big business and success spun as relationships are more important than money or cute clothes. Hey, Hollywood, how about a movie where the girl WANTS to be a success and financially well-off and doesn't want to work for peanuts for a liberal rag like the New York Times. And her boyfriend understands! Now THAT would be different, wouldn't it? Some critic called this a clever, funny adaption of Lauren Weisberger's novel, when really it is only funny to socialists. I am certain that those hard-working people in the fashion industry who love their jobs and have great family lives at the same time, thank you, didn't find this slick socialist screed funny at all.</p></br><a href="../users/ADS5APY1NKTL4.html">ADS5APY1NKTL4</a><br/><p>I will be the first to admit to you, here and now, that I have never owned anything from Calvin Klein, Vera Wang, Jimmy Choo, or Tommy Hilfiger (much less Abercrombie & Fitch).  Yes, Amazon.com readers, I am not a fashion maven.  To be honest with you, most of the fashion references in this film (made by the delightfully wicked Meryl Streep, as Miranda Priestly) went right over my head.  Yet, it worked.  Can you blame poor Andrea Sachs (Anne Hathaway) for feeling more than a little beside herself?  I mean, the girl comes straight out of a good college with a journalism degree, with the aspiration of one day working for the New York Times, and must take an administrative position in a fashion firm (fashion being a subject she knows NOTHING about).<br /><br />Others before me have called this film a--sort of--modern day Cinderella story with a twist.  For me, it was more like a comment on modern day materialism, ambition, and how we all have the option in life to throw our morality to the wayside in persuit of the "American Dream."  This was more social commentary, to me, than anything else.<br /><br />Is this worth seeing?  Yes, I think it is.  Anne Hathaway is absolutely charming as the heroine, Meryl Streep steals the show with her one liners and posturing, and you can tell the whole cast was having great fun with her.</p></br><a href="../users/A3SYMLB8JSW5VD.html">A3SYMLB8JSW5VD</a><br/><p>What not to like about this DVD.

Following Ann Hathaway's character, Andy, who is an aspiring journalist, with minimal fashion sense, who joins a fashion magazine as the PA to the ogre of a boss (played by Meryl Streep) this film is quickly set up for plenty of laughs and over the top fashion flamboyance. I've found Hathaway quite annoying in past films but she is actually very good in this film and plays her part very well. Streep's other PA is also hilarious with her back biting and sniping. Andy is asked to perform various outrageous tasks for her demanding boss and soon struggles to juggle home and work life and this leads to the crux of the film. How will she resolve her dilemma whilst maintaining her integrity? This film has some good laughs and cutting sarcastic wit from Streep and is good for a couple of hours viewing. It is easy going, not too heavy and great for a lazy afternoon. It may be pretty innocuous but it never tried to be too high brow or anything other than what it is, simple chick flick fun.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></br><a href="../users/A10E3F50DIUJEE.html">A10E3F50DIUJEE</a><br/><p>After several attempts to watch this on cable, I have finally seen it all.  With that being said, you are probably better off attempting to watch it on one of its numerous cable/movie channel runs.<br /><br />The story is this: Andy (played by Anne Hathaway) comes to NY in hopes of making it big as a serious investigative journalist, but winds up taking a job that she is not suited for, and does not want, working for Miranda Priestly (played splendidly by Meryl Streep).  As Andy comes to realize more and more everyday just how much she does not belong and hates her job, she eventually tries to make the best of it by the old "grin and bear it" method.  She does end up doing better, but at the cost of her social life.  And the story winds down the predictable path about the choices that Andy must make in order to be truly happy.<br /><br />Not the most unique, but I guess it works, although I found the ending trite and borderline insulting to young professional women.<br /><br />Regardless of that, the film is a wonderful vehicle for the talents of Meryl Streep (of course) and Emily Blunt.  Any one interested in fashion will also be appeased, as it is a fashionista's dream.<br /><br />It is good for a cute goofy movie, but nothing too funny or endearing to make it worth owning.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />If you take aside Meryl Streep's ice queen and the appealingly bitchy Emily Blunt, all you have left is a ridiculously contrived story without an inch of unpredictability; it's disposable entertainment for people who fetishize clothes.</p></br><a href="../users/AE9GUE3HHOX3U.html">AE9GUE3HHOX3U</a><br/><p>There are times where you just want to bash Miranda's face in during this movie.  Meryl Streep plays Miranda Priestley so convincingly, it makes you hate her character to the core.  I hope Meryl isn't like Miranda in real life, if so that would be sad.  I personally would not put up with anything Andie went through with Miranda and her crappy attitude.  I would have spat in her face and walked out on the job.  If that's really how the fashion industry operates, I think it's pathetic and they need to get over themselves because everything they design goes out of style anyways.  This film captures the attitude of the fashion industry and the acting is fantastic by Meryl Streep, I wish she would have won the oscar.</p></br><a href="../users/A8X8D4BUY5DFU.html">A8X8D4BUY5DFU</a><br/><p>I liked but it was not not quite up to the hype.  Perhaps more "In" jokes than I understood</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>I loved the book when I read it, and was looking forward to buying the DVD. I bought it on the second day of release, and watched it a few days later.<br /><br />I was disappointed. The start of the film has a couple of montage scenes (good once, but twice?!) and whole chunks of the book are cut out. Meryl Streep playing Miranda Priestly, was so quiet, I kept turning the volume up, but still couldn't hear a word she was saying. It's said Meryl based this on Clint Eastwood in the Dirty Harry films, but it quite frankly, annoyed the hell out of me.<br /><br />I don't agree with some of the other reviewers who mentioned that the film works better without some of the "duller subplots" from the book. Andy's best friend Lily featured majorly in the book and even had a pivotal role in the finale. So did Andy's boyfriend and her parents. But they're basically forgotten about, apart from a small glimpse of her father. I liked Lily's story in the film, it showed how strong Andy's friendship was, but she gets no more than a couple of scenes, and a couple of forgettable lines. I don't agree the loss of these scenes made for a more "streamlined" film. I actually thought it would have made it better.<br /><br />The first half of the film sticks quite closely to the book, but leaves out the funny moments. The second half more or less goes it's own way, and I ended up losing it, and not really paying it my full attention. There are still some bits kept from the second half of the book, but not enough.<br /><br />The finale of the film is changed as well. With Lily's pivotal role forgotten about, it changes completely, and in a very unsatisfactory way too. I much preferred the ending of the book, but I did think it was good the way you saw Miranda at the end.<br /><br />The only saving grace about this film (apart from Anne Hathaway), was Emily Blunt's scene stealing performance as Emily. She is cattily on target with her portrayal of Emily, a perfect opposite to the wide-eyed innocent of Anne Hathaway. But her storyline gets partly changed as well towards the end, but not in such a major way.<br /><br />Reviewers calling this a comedy are so far off the mark that it's laughable. What did you find funny apart from Emily Blunt's eye-rolls and her witty comments? There's nothing funny about this. As another reviewer mentioned, it could have so been another Princess Diaries - the transformation from "I don't care how I look" to "Wow, don't I look good?" is seen right through the film.<br /><br />If you want to get it, get it cheap, and read the book first. The book is the true gem.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ICHEO78NFE4Y.html">A3ICHEO78NFE4Y</a><br/><p>I love movies with great acting and this movie has great acting.  I hadn't read the book but i heard that the ending is different.  The ending that was picked for this film has a great moral lesson.  I'm sure when your at the top of any back-stabbing company, you must be extremely lonely but the character of Meryl Streep puts awhole new meaning to the works "lonely" and "mean."  The film is funny, whitty, fast moving with increadible costumes.  It would be like watching a Dois Day movie today.  Just beautifully filmed and executed.  I look forward to this on DVD.

Perhaps my expectations had been unrealistically raised.  Perhaps the film was just not that good.  In fact, it was probably a bit of both.<br /><br />I suspect the New York fashion industry has its fair share of piranhas swimming about in the pond.  Yet, having said this, "The Devil Wears Prada" was simply an attempt to use caricature as a vehicle for comedy.  This works for a while but, at some point, it begins to wear a bit thin.<br /><br />Can I recommend this film to the reader?  Alas, no.

Hey writers of this movie, do not paint a guy to be a loser but then try to make him out to be some nice guy with some interest in stuff, guys who sit around eating pizza all day and not giving a crap about the ladies who love them really are losers!</p></br><a href="../users/AMNNPDX9MFEUD.html">AMNNPDX9MFEUD</a><br/><p>I went with the wife to see this back in the summer and enjoyed it so much we caught it a second time and just bought the dvd. I was surprised at how un-chick flick like it was. This is a well made if slightly corny (especially the less-than-satisfying ending) tale of self-discovery. The acting is top notch with Anne Hathaway being the weakest link. Her character has little to convey emotionally and she does a fair job of just that, but the other three major characters at Runway magazine are worth the price of admission. They save what might've been a cliche and turn it into a fun exploration of the world of fashion. Granted, some deep ideas (the double standard applied to powerful women, chosing between career and love) are glossed over, remember it is a fluffy movie based on a fluffy novel, so approach it as such.<br /><br />I agree with the general sentiment that (SPOILER ALERT!!!) Andrea should have blown off her painfully immature friends and gone for rhe gold, having the foresight to know that her relationship with the boyfriend wasn't going anywhere anyway, but she gives in to the picket fence and Hallmark duldrums instead of seizing the brass ring when it is so clearly within her view, but this is overanalysis where it is clearly not called for. Enjoy it for the light and fun treat it was intended to be - in that it succeeds quite pleasantly.</p></br><a href="../users/A31ARSC1LGY8WK.html">A31ARSC1LGY8WK</a><br/><p>"The Devil Wears Prada" is a slight comedy set within the world of high fashion.<br /><br />Meryl Streep plays the head of a fashion magazine and Anne Hathaway her new assistant. How Meryl Streep managed to get a Best Actress nomination for a role in this film beggars belief. Anne Hathaway is quite cute but somebody with a bit more spunk could have made more out of it e.g. Kirsten Dunst.<br /><br />The undemanding, inoffensive plot and the casting of Hathaway would lead one to believe the filmmakers were trying to appeal to the "Princess Bride" audience of Hathaway rather than the "adult" audience of Streep.<br /><br />Yet more formula entertainment from the Hollywood production line.</p></br><a href="../users/A32AK8FOAZEPE2.html">A32AK8FOAZEPE2</a><br/><p>nicely done. only the boy friend cast was not appropriate enough. there's nothing wrong with the materialism, the brands, the brand names. men or women, without clothings, or without beautiful clothings, would all look the same. human beings are differred from other creatures only with clothes. men or women, once naked, would just look almost the same. what makes the world more interesting? those beautiful clothes and the accessories. this is a highly entertaining movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VQBHHXIKHIGS.html">A1VQBHHXIKHIGS</a><br/><p>I presume the book was better.  Here we toss some stereotyped characters into an "oooh, bad office" situation and let them do...nothing.  Meryl Streep brought her character to life, as always, and delivered a remarkable quantity of dialogue, but so what?  The movie goes nowhere.  Bumpkin, bad boss, fashion models...  Like those models, it never gets past the surface, and it's a boring surface at that.  No character, no plot, no witty dialogue, no humor, no point.</p></br><a href="../users/A13E0ARAXI6KJW.html">A13E0ARAXI6KJW</a><br/><p>Even though she portrayed variations of the same demonic character in 1989's "She-Devil" and 1992's "Death Becomes Her", Meryl Streep truly nails it in this smart, creative 2006 comedy by underplaying the role and saving her verbal talons for pivotal moments. As Miranda Priestly, the despotic editor-in-chief of Runway magazine, Streep simply singes the screen every time she appears with her perfectly upswept hair; arrogant couture opinions and frequently unreasonable demands on her staff.<br /><br />Fortunately, director David Frankel has come along well since his 1995 Woody Allen knockoff, the irritatingly unctuous "Miami Rhapsody", and one can see his progression in his smart work on episodes of "Sex in the City" and "Entourage". He moves the film at such a sharp, fast clip that it feels like an accurately frenzied portrayal of the inner workings of the world of haute couture. The one-line zingers also come fast and furious thanks to Aline Brosh McKenna's deep-dish script based on Lauren Weisberger's best-selling novel, but the vitriol does not come at the expense of character development and a shrewdly observed storyline about all-or-nothing careers when working for media royals and courtiers.<br /><br />The plot's protagonist is not Priestly but Andy Sachs, a young idealist and aspiring journalist who just graduated from Northwestern. Even though she has no interest in fashion, she lands an interview at Runway. Because she is not a typically bootlicking, anorexic fashionista toady, Priestly hires her as her second assistant. It becomes a nightmarish trial by fire, as Andy slowly earns the trust of Priestly much to the chagrin of the haughty first assistant Emily. And despite the derision of her circle of friends, including her live-in boyfriend, Sachs starts to respect Priestly's style and power, which leads to the decision to have Andy go to Paris for Fashion Week. Further complications ensue when a hotshot writer takes an interest in her and a power struggle erupts at Runway.<br /><br />It really takes someone of Streep's caliber to pull off the impossible character of Priestly because when she does have a moment of vulnerability, it resonates so much more than it should. Although she is far too pretty to be considered frumpy by anyone's standards, the naturally likable Anne Hathaway plays Sachs serviceably and looks sensational in a series of Chanel outfits. She brings the necessary heart to the story, even though the character arc is rather predictable. It does seem a shame that we are supposed to cheer the character's reduction from size 6 to 4, but that is probably as accurate as anything else in the film.<br /><br />There is terrific work from the reliable Stanley Tucci as Nigel, Runway's no-nonsense fashion director, especially as he patiently works under Priestly's shadow and gives Sachs hard-to-take survival advice, and from Emily Blunt, who plays first assistant Emily with the ideal combination of vitriol and desperation. Overly metrosexualized with the strangest blond eyebrows I have ever seen, Simon Baker lends an appropriately smarmy edge to his writer Christian Thompson. Far less interesting are Sachs' judgmental friends, in particular, Adrian Grenier as Sachs' sous-chef boyfriend Nate and Tracie Thoms as art gallery manager Lilly (whose putdown of Andy seems way out of line). The ending is inevitable, but it moves in a creative way that makes neither Sachs overly heroic nor Priestly absolutely villainous. This is solid entertainment elevated by the artistry of Streep.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ.html">A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ</a><br/><p>Overall, The Devil Wears Prada is a pretty solid, fairly forgetable movie. The entire cast really shines, but none as bright as Meryl Streep. She could have come off as a caricature Cruella Da Ville-ish archetype, but instead she's created a very real portrayal of a success-driven business woman who's devoted her life to her work.<br /><br />I was surprised at how little actually happened in the movie. At several points throughout the film I felt sure that something was about to happen, some event about to occur... but that never really happened. Although the plot does seem to move at a glacial pace, the imagery (New York streets and skylines), script, and acting really hold their own and keep an unveventful movie from becoming boring. In fact, it's quite enjoyable.<br /><br />Parts of the story are a bit contrived, and in a lower-budget movie they would have seemed laughable, but willing suspension of disbelief comes in handy here. If you enjoy fashion and scenes where the "other girls" drop their jaws because they're so impressed with Anne Hathaway's makeover, you will LOVE this movie. If you're not really into that stuff, you'll still enjoy The Devil Wears Prada, you just won't want to buy it, take it home, and wear it.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA may put off many moviegoers because it sounds like a silly bit of fluff best seen when released on DVD. But this is a fine little movie that, despite its rather predictable and silly storyline, gives a number of fine actors the opportunity to sharpen their skills in playing roles not usually associated with their repertoire. Especially in the case of the brilliant Meryl Streep, who here proves she can be a convincing evil witch and yet hold our attention for her rare vulnerable moments.  This is a piece of powerful characterization.<br /><br />The story is both well known because of Lauren Weisberger's Top 10 on the charts novel and because the story of a plain Jane making it big in the corporate world at the risk of jeopardizing her ideals and private life.  But the story works again, this time draped in the fashion magazine industry.<br /><br />Andy Sachs (Anne Hathaway) is a reporter without a job, a girl simple and physically unsophisticated with a chef boyfriend Nate (Adrian Grenier) and extended family, who is placed for interview with Runway Magazine as the personal assistant to the editor Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep). And is dowdy but smart, and Miranda decides to take her one despite her other assistant Emily (Emily Blunt) and jeering crowd's amazement.  Miranda is a Diva who is a control freak, spits out demands as she tosses her wrap and purse on the assistant's desk, communicates only is stingingly acidic one liners,  and is in general a fearsome Titanic of a woman.  The story revolves around Andy's transformation by magazine worker Nigel (Stanley Tucci) et al and within weeks Andy is Miranda's right hand person, responsible to her whims 24/7.  This obligation and change wrecks havoc with Andy's personal life, leads to a Paris fashion trip, an encounter with Christian Thompson (Simon Baker),a hunky writer with high credentials when sets out to woo Andy, and eventually Andy must make some choices about the speedy treadmill on which she finds herself.<br /><br />Yes, it is a bit of Working Girl, Cinderella, etc but it works on screen due largely to the fine performances by the entire cast - but especially for the stunning tour de force by Streep. Clothed in an endless array of fashionable outfits, Streep is the epitome of the fashion guru: she hasn't looked this beautiful in a long time and this film reminds us that she is a very attractive as well as inordinately gifted actress.  This role is so well played that it may even be listed in the Oscar category.  Now who would have ever expected that from the rather silly idea of The Devil Wears Prada?  Strong work!  Grady Harp, July 06</p></br><a href="../users/A34D4KCP94ACJZ.html">A34D4KCP94ACJZ</a><br/><p>Obviously this weekend my wife had control of the television.  That's alright though because whenever that happens I usually end up having lower expectations then usual and find the viewing experience to be better than expected.  This was not the case with The Devil Wears Prada, as this little movie did have a lot of hype, even among movie snobs and cinephiles like me.  It seemed that critically this was on a higher level than the chick flicks I typically find myself rolling my eyes to after my wife has gained control over the television.  After the viewing I think it is fair to say that The Devil Wears Prada deserves every bit of praise it has received in 2006.<br /><br />From what I understand this movie was adapted for the screen from a novel written a few years ago.  Andrea or Andy (Anne Hathaway) is a new Northwestern graduate and somewhat nerdy and awkward girl who just received a job as a co-assistant for a highly demanding editor of a fashion magazine named Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep).  Andy is at least awkward and nerdy in Miranda's competitive and ostentatious world.  Most girls would love Andy's opportunity but Andy doesn't seem to care and for a while even sees herself as above the fashion culture.  Andy fails to fit in well and it grates on her.  She is also employed by a horribly demanding boss in Priestly.  Miranda Priestly is notorious and after some time Andy begins to enjoy the challenge, especially after the entire supporting cast in the film doubts she can last.  Also, Andy's opportunities will expand tremendously if she can prove to exist under Miranda for a significant amount of time.  There are good side plots and certain developments which I won't reveal, but rest assured the film is fun.<br /><br />The screenplay is written to be palpable to a wide audience and that can make a film outside of this viewer's favorite genres more entertaining.  However, it is the cast in The Devil Wears Prada that makes it a success.  Meryl Streep definitely delivered one of the most effective comedic performances I have seen in years.  Her nomination for an Oscar was well-deserved for several reasons. I hold out hope that it is her understanding of the dry humor and arrogance in Miranda's character that earned her the nomination and not the mushy scenes that typically earn attention from the Academy.  Meryl is outstanding and the character allows for an amazing display of her talent.  To Anne Hathaway's credit, she holds her own in each scene and her ability to make Andy likeable in a situation where I could've just as easily sympathized with the villain deserves some praise as well.  I was even more surprised by the supporting cast here, especially Emily Blunt and Stanley Tucci who played distinctively different roles than I'm used to seeing them play.<br /><br />The Devil Wears Prada is a not a profound film that attempts to comment on larger things.  If it did, it would've failed.  That isn't to say the film lacks depth entirely and manages not to say anything.  It has its points.  I had trouble at first trying to figure out where The Devil Wears Prada stood as a critique of the fashion culture it is showing us, but that was not what the film set out to do.  The fashion world is merely the film's setting to tell this story.  One of the best messages I got from The Devil Wears Prada also happened to be the one that placed the film squarely against the grain of on-the-surface similar stories.  The story allowed me to pragmatically support its villain.  If Miranda Priestly were a man she would have the respect of her colleagues but instead they fear her.  That point brought The Devil Wears Prada away from conventional comedy and into a coming of age story for Andy as in many ways she began to respect Miranda just as we do.  It cut much deeper than I expected, even with all that hype.</p></br><a href="../users/A5KJVGJ43ZDC9.html">A5KJVGJ43ZDC9</a><br/><p>I'm embarrassed to say I watched this.

Andy is surprisingly (to herself and to us) hired as Miranda's second assistant: a job that everyone tells her "several 1000 girls would give their eye-teeth for."<br />Andy is subjected to a number of humiliating and challenging situations and by whit of her innate intelligence and talent manages to solve and/or survive all.<br />Streep plays Miranda as if her life depends on it: she is ferocious, haughty, smart and completely dedicated to her job and as Andy comments during the film: "If Miranda were a man, no one would make a comment about her drive for perfection." (paraphrase). There is one scene in which Miranda lets her hair down emotionally with Andy but the scene seems contrived to add another tone (a "female" one)to Miranda's character. Again the director should have left well enough alone, stuck by his character's basic nature and celebrated the strong, powerful woman that Miranda is.<br />If only "TDWP" as a whole had the steely resolve of Streep's Miranda we might have had an important as well as a mildly amusing film on our hands.

Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep).<br /><br />Looking like some high fashion version of Cruella De Vil, Miranda is terryfing, ruthless, demanding and determined; qualities that made the most powerful woman in the bussines and thus, the most feared. She is the high-priestess of fashion; she doesn't follow the trends, she sets them.<br /><br />Into this merciless world enters the wide-eyed and geeky Andy Sachs (Anne Hathaway). With Miranda always scarring off assistants, an opportunity has arisen to take an opportunity at the job "a million girls would kill for." Turns out Andy is not one of them, being one of the few women in New York who isn't aware of who Miranda is and her fearsome reputation. This refreshing confession, is enough to persuade Miranda to hire her.<br /><br />Taking her position behind Miranda's first assistant Emily (the wonderful Emily Blunt), Andy learns why her boss changes assistants like handbags. She also learns what is required to make it in the cut-throat fashion business, placing her personal life second to the needs of her boss. That and transforming her plain image into a wild fashionista.<br /><br />Based on the book of the same name by Lauren Weisberger, The Devil Wears Prada is a devilicious look at the high fashion industry. The brilliant Streep loses herself in the role of the satanic Miranda. But she also humanizes her, showing us bits of the real woman beneath the designer clothes. Miranda wields a great deal of power, and knows it, but she also knows exactly what price she has paid to be at the top of the fashion game. But as Andy notes, if Miranda were a man, no one would even question that; they'd just admire how successful she was at her job.<br /><br />There lies the truth buried deeply in the heart of Prada: the world of professional careers take a higher price from women than from men. A man can be a demanding boss, so long as he's great at what he does, and people will not only put up with it, but respect him for it. A woman like Miranda, on the other hand, is considered a "devil" for doing the same thing.</p></br><a href="../users/A139ZF7CJVVTJU.html">A139ZF7CJVVTJU</a><br/><p>What "The Devil Wears Prada" lacks in substance and originality, it makes up for in scenery.  Lots of sexy, haute couture clothing fills the screen (and, if you listen to the commentary, you'll be treated to a piece by piece deconstruction of it all), and they are usually adorned by equally sexy actors and actresses, most of whom are required to do little more than wink and show off a sultry moue.<br /><br />The story, about fish-out-of-water Andy Sachs (a cute-as-a-button Anne Hathaway) trying to make it as second assistant to the domineering ice queen Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep), opts for easy outs every step of the way.  You have the Ugly Duckling Transformation (which isn't nearly as remarkable as this movie wants us to believe it is; Hathaway's good looks are tousled, not hidden, at the start of the film), the Crisis of Conscience (which is also hard to swallow; Andy "betrays" one of the most unlikeable characters in the film), and the Call to Reality (which includes one of the most over-used lines in film history: "You've become one of them.").<br /><br />Does Andy become one of "them" ("Them," in this case, being overly critical, weight-obssessed fashionistas)?  No.  Not really.  Unless you call wearing better clothing and working a lot more becoming one of "them."  It's hard to imagine a different outcome, when you are working as the assistant to the Editor-In-Chief of one of the world's largest fashion magazines.  Andy's friends (and, specifically, her milquetoast-dull boyfriend, Nate) exist like props to propel the barely-there moral agenda.  They are supposed to show us Andy's earthy, Good Time roots (they playfully toss her phone around when she gets a call from Miranda; what fun!), but they are also there to let the audience know when Andy has Gone Too Far (according to this movie, getting an unsolicited kiss on the cheek is enough to convict someone of infidelity).<br /><br />That's dismissable.  What this movie is really about is Streep's icy Priestly, a tough, shale-edged woman who, if you look closely enough, lets a little humanity shine through her facade.  Streep restrains herself admirably, turning what could've been a one-note character into an entire symphony.  She is also aided by the excellent work of Stanley Tucci who plays Nigel, one of Priestly's helmsmen.<br /><br />Both of these characters (and the actors who give them life) take what could easily have been a horribly trite film and turn it into something that is, if not remarkable, then at least interesting.  The film tries hard to get us to see how Andy has sold out, how she has co-opted her dreams in order to Fit In, but all any intelligent viewer will see is just how fun and exciting Andy's world is once she DOES fit in (and she does it so well).  It's an odd little movie that makes the uncompromising boss seem like the most sympathetic character, while the Family And Friends seem like little more than whiny obstacles, but that doesn't make it bad.<br /><br />Of course, the ending is to be expected, and it feels as if it's been lifted straight out of a Hallmark card, but the real ending is, like most of the movie, all Streep's.  If Andy is the angel fallen from grace, seduced by a well-dressed demon, then this movie is all about sympathy for the devil.  And even if you can't swallow that, you still get to look at a lot of pretty shoes.</p></br><a href="../users/A18IK6YI6T3RK2.html">A18IK6YI6T3RK2</a><br/><p>First of all this has to be one of the best titles for a book and subsequently this movie, and it fit's the great Steep, who channels Ms. Wintour.  I cannot think of any actress better for this part, she owns this movie and is frankly the main reason to see it.  The book was  a fun, quick read, and the movie is fun, but the story light and meandering, like the book..Hathaway does not get in the way and she's good in the role, the movies cameo's are good as well, but again its Streep, that makes this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A27FR2C67JPDRS.html">A27FR2C67JPDRS</a><br/><p>For the person who has suffered working for a boss from hell, he or she can relate to Andy, a recent college graduate who takes a job with the world's most famous fashion magazine, Runway, to get a year of experience under her belt.  Unknowningly, the doe-eyed, fashion-challenged young lady walks into the lair of the devil, Miranda Priestly.  Taking a job in a field she knows nothing about certainly does nothing to impress the vicious and EXTREMELY demanding Miranda, who chews her assistants up and spits them out on a regular basis.<br /><br />From the start, Andy is fighting an uphill battle.  Slowly, however, with the help of Nigel, one of Miranda's right hand men, who has not lost his soul while working for his evil boss, she decides to change and throw all her effort into pleasing Miranda.  Aided by Nigel, Andy slowly emerges as a fashionable, young assistant proving that she is capable of handling any of Miranda's insane and nearly impossible demands.  However, she soons begins to realize that her job is consuming her life and destroying her relationship with friends and her boyfriend, Nate.  The question that she eventually faces, is how far will she will go with her demanding job---to the top or abandon the normal life she enjoyed with her loved ones.<br /><br />I read this book and enjoyed it and was delighted to hear that Meryl Streep would play Miranda.  And while the book is told through Andy's eyes, Miranda is the person you can't look away from and this is the deliciously evil kind of role that any actress would enjoy playing.  It is no surprise that Meryl tackles it with amazing ease and oozes an aura of iciness that would freeze you in your spot.  Without raising her voice, she simply slices you down with a pointed sentence that cuts deeper than daggers or simply gives a look of disgust that makes you want to throw up your lunch---in these girls' cases, that would be a miracle since they eat almost nothing.  At any rate, I would love to see Meryl get a nomination for this role because she simply MAKES the movie.<br /><br />Anne Hathway is a great choice for Andy and your heart certainly goes out to her.  Whether she is trying to get Miranda's hot coffee or trying to get her hands on the manuscript for the latest Harry Potter novel, you feel the dread along with the character as she brings her tasks to the disapproving eyes of Ms. Priestly.  Stanley Tucci also does a great job as Nigel, who takes her under his wing and gives her the chops to make it in the halls of Runway.<br /><br />For those who read the book, you will not be disappointed.  And for anyone who is a fan of Meryl Streep, this is a movie you will want to see (and later own on dvd).  For those who love fashion, of course, this will be right down your alley!  But for all of us who know how bad a mean boss can be, you will sympathize!  Well worth your time and money!</p></br><a href="../users/ABH4G7TVI6G2T.html">ABH4G7TVI6G2T</a><br/><p>THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA is a sinfully delicious comedy set in the cut-throat New York fashion industry.  When journalist Andie Sachs (Anne Hathaway) is hired as the new assistant to Runway Magazine editor Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep), the stage is set for a a legendary culture (or should that be couture?) clash!  Miranda Priestly--inspired by Anna Wintour, renowned editor of Vogue--is one of the most fascinating characters that Ms Streep has ever played on the screen and she really tries to give some depth to Miranda's life away from the spotlight.<br /><br />Anne Hathaway, fast becoming the Audrey Hepburn for Gen. Y., has another of her trademark "ugly duckling to Cinderella" transformations with her role as Andie.  Stealing every scene is the amazing Emily Blunt, playing Miranda's flinty main assistant; plus Stanley Tucci as one of the catty Runway designers.  A modern classic.<br /><br />I've compared the Blu-ray disc to the earlier DVD release and the difference is literally night and day.  Extras include audio commentary with the filmmakers and deleted scenes.  This particular BD disc is encoded for playback in regions A through C.</p></br><a href="../users/A9I40WFF40R4.html">A9I40WFF40R4</a><br/><p>Fresh from A PRAIRIE HOME COMPANION the incomparable Ms. Streep hits the street this time in designer shoes. And the rest is, as they say. . . As always Meryl Streep shows that she can play any role perfectly. Cast here as the dragon lady of a fashion magazine "Runway," she is of course a joy to watch. Anne Hathaway, fresh from BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, is the recent college graduate who lands a job as an assistant to Ms. Streep while waitng for her ship as a fledgling writer to dock. No slouch herself, she gives Ms. Streep a good run for her money, helping Streep find her own heart, however small. The plot is predictable with only a couple of surprises. After all, this is a comedy; and good always triumphs over evil.<br /><br />These two women have a fine supporting staff; and the photography is spectactular, especially the footage of New York and Paris. I haven't seen so much about high fashion in a movie since Richard Gere wore all those Armani clothes in AMERICAN GIGOLO.<br /><br />So treat yourself to an entertaining movie in these, the Dog Days of summer.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>Chick-book writer Lauren Weisberger's 2003 novel comes to fast-paced life in the 2006 film adaptation of The Devil Wears Prada....Rest assured, a movie that is no chick-flick. While some of the fast-paced-ness seems over the top, as a veteran that's worked in the publishing business in NYC, I can say first hand that it is not over the top...for the most part.<br /><br />And the completely obtuse disposition that defines Meryl Streep's character, while perhaps a bit exaggerated at times, is universally known in the industry as the standard by which you should set your expectations for a boss if you are going to work at any of the big firms that publish the fat fashion and beauty magazines. I'd bet that Weisberger, quite contrary to the disclaimer that "this book/movie is a work of fiction", was loosely (or not so loosely) based on a real publisher.<br /><br />Some of the dialogue and situations do indeed stretch the limits of reality, but no more than that of the humorous bits commonly found in shows like HBO's Sex and the City or Entourage. And no wonder...Director David Frankel has made his mark on both of those as a director.<br /><br />Overall, I was completely entertained. I don't know if it's the title using the word "Prada" or if it's some whisper down the line miscommunication that's incorrectly given The Devil Wears Prada the official chick-flick label among the guy community...perhaps cheating this movie out of a much higher dollar gross.<br /><br />Maybe it's a guy mentality thing? Yesterday I told my buddy about how much I enjoyed The Devil Wears Prada. I told him it's a good story; it moves quickly; you can relate to the situations; and the acting is excellent. He said, "Does Anne Hathaway get naked?" Um...no. It's just a very good movie.<br /><br />So my recommendation, guys, see it. But if you were one of the naysayers, be warned: You will need to go back to everyone and confess that you got your butt kicked by a chick-flick.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>Andrea (Anne Hathaway, "The Princess Diaries", "Brokeback Mountain"), fresh out of Northwestern University and clutching her journalism degree, arrives in New York looking for her first job in publishing. At her only interview, she is offered the choice of working at a Car magazine or as the second assistant to Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep), demanding editor of "Runway", THE fashion industry bible. The first meeting does not go well, but Emily (Emily Blunt), Miranda's first assistant informs her she got the job. The next morning, Andrea receives a call at 6:15 am and realizes she is way out of her depth. One day  Nigel (Stanley Tucci), Miranda's favored Print Editor, gives Andrea the lowdown; she hasn't been able to get a handle on the job because she thinks the job is below her. Realizing he is right, Andrea seeks his help with a fashion makeover and she soon proves adept at the job, surprising her boyfriend, Nate (Adrian Grenier, HBO's "Entourage") and a respected writer (Simon Baker) who shows an interest in more than just giving her help her publish `real' writing.<br /><br />"The Devil Wears Prada", based on the enormously popular bestseller, has finally made it to the screen. It is an oft-told tale, many times in a more compelling fashion, but a standout performance and some funny moments help the film stand out. Barely.<br /><br />It is difficult to watch a great actor in a film that doesn't live up to their performance. Meryl Streep is a great actress, but I can be objective ("Prime", "A Prairie Home Companion"). "Prada" is overall better than her previous few films, but it is still along way from great. But Streep is by far the best thing in the film, her performance is outstanding. As Miranda, the demanding, bitchy editor of a "Vogue" like magazine, she embodies the character so fully, we feel a chill running down our spine every time she walks on screen. Many bosses are demanding, domineering and manipulative but the difference is Miranda lives and breathes the job and this magazine. It is her life. As such, she expects her assistants to be able to get things done. Of course, there are bosses out there who take this to the extreme; they begin speaking in shorthand, ask for more things than one person can handle, make outrageous demands. This is where the comedy comes in.<br /><br />It wouldn't be unusual or amusing if Miranda were simply demanding, she has to be impossible. As soon as the office learns she is on her way, they quickly change out of sensible, comfortable shoes into more fashionable pumps. Every morning when she comes in, she dumps her purse and coat on the desk of her second assistant and ignores Andrea's greeting before entering her own office to find a super hot Starbucks and the competitor's magazines laid out on her desk. She expects her assistants to work miracles; get stores to open early (which they do, for Miranda), get the new, unpublished Harry Potter book, the like. Amazingly, Andrea learns how to do this and becomes quite adept.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PBV1899CX3TE.html">A2PBV1899CX3TE</a><br/><p>A delightful excursion through the world of Haute Couture<br /><br />and magazine publishing set amid glamorous Paris and New<br /><br />York. The film is an adaptation of Lauren Weisberger's<br /><br />best-seller, which was based on Anna Wintour (Editor-in-<br /><br />Chief of the U.S. edition of Vogue). Andy Sachs (Anne<br /><br />Hathaway) seems a fish out of water when she interviews<br /><br />for a job as the second-assistant to Miranda Priestly<br /><br />(Meryl Streep), editor of high fashion magazine, Runway.<br /><br />Andy wants to be journalist, and is only working there to get survive until she gets a break for her writing.<br /><br />Miranda Priestly: ...You have no sense of fashion...<br /><br />Andy Sachs: I think that depends on...<br /><br />Miranda Priestly: No, no, that wasn't a question.<br /><br />But Andy is smart, though at first naive, and after being<br /><br />hired, she tries hard to please the devil in Prada,<br /><br />Miranda. Pleasing Miranda, however, is quite a challenge.<br /><br />Completely self centered, she makes impossible demands<br /><br />such as a flight out of Florida during a hurricane, or the<br /><br />unpublished manuscript to the latest Harry Potter book for<br /><br />her twins. Streep is the consummate bitch delivering such<br /><br />lines as:<br /><br />Miranda Priestly: Find me that piece of paper I had in my<br /><br />hand yesterday morning.<br /><br />Miranda Priestly: By all means move at a glacial pace. You<br /><br />know how that thrills me.<br /><br />Miranda Priestly: Details of your incompetence do not<br /><br />interest me.<br /><br />Contrast this Ice Queen with the laid back character she<br /><br />played in Prairie Home Companion, and you begin to get a<br /><br />sense of this actresses extensive range. This role earned<br /><br />her an Oscar nomination. Well deserved, I might add.<br /><br />First-assistant Emily (Emily Blunt) would be only too<br /><br />happy to sabotage Andy, but if she were fired just now<br /><br />that would dash her dreams of attending the fashion events<br /><br />in Paris. Lots of catty comments from her. My fav:<br /><br />Emily: Okay, I am hearing this...<br /><br />[She moves her hand in a speech mimiking sign]<br /><br />Emily: And I want to hear this.<br /><br />[She closes her hand]<br /><br />Can't wait to use that one.<br /><br />Art Director Nigel (Stanley Tucci) gives an excellent<br /><br />performance, mentoring the ingenue, without ever losing<br /><br />his satiric edge or giving in to the sacharine. Upon first<br /><br />seeing her he dashes off the following withering remark:<br /><br />Nigel: Who is that *sad* little person? Are we doing a<br /><br />before-and-after piece I don't know about?<br /><br />When she turns to him, after a particularly cruel session<br /><br />of torture from Miranda, instead of sympathy he tells her<br /><br />bluntly that she disrespects the Art of Fashion, the role<br /><br />of the magazine, and the impact of Miranda upon that Art.<br /><br />Nigel: Other girls dream of working here. You merely<br /><br />deign.<br /><br />Later, after seeing that Andy is smart and capable, and<br /><br />trying to meet the challenges of her job, he gives her a<br /><br />pair of Jimmy Chu high heels. She tells him they are not<br /><br />for her, but soon after when Miranda glares at her<br /><br />sensible shoes, she puts them on Tout de Suite. This is a<br /><br />turning point for her character, who finally gets in the<br /><br />game, embracing the world of fashion, and dances with the<br /><br />devil. Andy is now known as Andrea, and she finally gets<br /><br />some good barbs of her own, such as when sexy writer<br /><br />Christian Thompson (Simon Baker) attempts to seduce her in<br /><br />Paris:<br /><br />Christian Thompson: Je suis tr&egrave;s, tr&egrave;s d&eacute;sol&eacute;.<br /><br />Andy Sachs: You're not that d&eacute;sol&eacute; at all.<br /><br />Director David Frankel was also responsible for Sex in the<br /><br />City, and this film exhibits the same witty dialogue, the<br /><br />same heady mixture of comedy and drama, that will keep you<br /><br />entertained right up to the final d&eacute;nouement.</p></br><a href="../users/AW4MT9WP95TVD.html">AW4MT9WP95TVD</a><br/><p>Prada is a thoroughly enjoyable Boss from Hell movie.

This is one of the few movies that when I watch the first 5 mintues of it, I knew that I was gonna love it.  That's how strong this movie allured you.  That's the way movies are supposed to be.<br /><br />Set in NYC, "homely" Andrea is looking for a job.  She is a law student turned journalist.  Somehow, she landed a job interview with Runway, which is THE fashion magazine that makes or breaks fashion and their respective designers.<br /><br />Andrea is out of the fashion league.  She's homely looking.  Her hair is simple.  Her clothes are frumpy and easy to notice that they're not of "top labels".  She's a regular in-shape girl to many of us.  However, to those in fashion, she's FAT!  Overall, she has no clue in the fashion industry.<br /><br />Enters the EIC of Runway, Miranda Priestly, who is like a demigoddess of the fashion world.  She is feared by her staff and designers.  She is seemingly rude, superficial, snobbish and spoiled.  However, she has thick skin and does know her stuff.<br /><br />With sheer luck, Andrea is hired as second assistant to Miranda.  She does all the dirty work such as putting Miranda's coat away, fetching her coffee and many others.  Meanwhile, British first assistant, Emily, is too busy kissing up to Miranda.<br /><br />Gradually, Andrea works her way up as first assistant.  With the help of the magazine's token gay designer, Nigel, Andrea's fashion improves which also gains Miranda's approval.  She is eventually given the coveted trip to Paris for the exclusive runways of the upcoming fashion.<br /><br />While she's moving up the ladder, she loses her soul.  She starts to blow her friends away.  She starts to put her work as priority over her boyfriend.  She starts to lose her goals as a journalist.  She starts to be like Miranda.  Miranda confirms that Andrea is a younger version of herself.<br /><br />The question is will Andrea give up her soul to remain in the fashion world?  Or will she quit the coveted job that "a million girls would kill for"?<br /><br />Meryl Streep is at her best in this film.  You must pay close attention to her eyes.  Her eyes emit strong meanings.  She'll glare, command, approve, reject, dismiss and all that with just her eyes.  She had me laughing at some parts.  Other parts, she had me commenting "oooo, what a b****!"  You either love her or hate her.<br /><br />Overall, I thought that *The Devil Wears Prada* was a wonderful film.  It's a simple film about moving up in a world that is demanding and determining if it is all worth it.  And if it is...at what cost?</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDNTB7377YH2.html">A1CDNTB7377YH2</a><br/><p>This movie is miles better than the silly Ugly Betty program that is a big hit on tv which has a lot of similarities.  Ana, who dreams of being a journalist takes a job out of desperation with Runway Magazine.  Runway is the leading fashion magazine that is the leader in deciding which designers will have successful lines.  The magazine is run by Miranda (Meryl Streep in a vastly different role than the friendly psychologist in the recent Prime) who controls everything about the magazine and whose pursed lips expression can sink a whole fashion line.  Ana interviews with Miranda to be her assistant and has no clue as to who Miranda is (she even tells her so).  What's more Ana appears to have absolutely no clue for fashion (a la Betty) though she does have good looks.<br /><br />Miranda relegates Ana to running errands with virtually no explanation as to what she wants.  Also, she is plainly told she is the #2 assistant by Emily, who keeps telling Ana not to mess up because she will ruin Emily's chance to go to the big fashion show in Paris (Emily's entire life revolves around being able to go to the show and get all the clothes).  Ana, totally frustrated wants to quit, with great encouragement from her boyfriend.  She is on the verge when she is reluctantly helped out by Miranda's main fashion advisor.  He helps her to make over he look and right away things start to slowly go Ana's way and less Emily's way.<br /><br />The more Ana starts to suceed, the more she moves further away from her boyfriend, friends, and what she believed in and she starts becoming more like the type of person she always despised.<br /><br />The movie is highly entertaining and Streep is amazing in her role (way more ruthless than Glenn Close was in 101 Dalmations).  I thoroughly enjoyed it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>Can you say Oscar nominee? If you can, then Meryl Streep's performance in The Devil Wears Prada should be first on your lips and list. Her witty, cool, and wickedly abrasive character portrayal of Miranda Priestly in this film certain warrants at least that.<br /><br />Simply put, The Devil Wears Prada is about corruption. Not political or business, but personal. The big question this movie asks is "How much of yourself are you willing to let go of to get what you want? Or what you think you want?" In this Summer's blockbuster comedy-drama, this question is not as easily answered as one might think.<br /><br />Miranda Priestly has given up everything to become the president of Runway Magazine, the most expensive, most popular fashion periodical ever to hit the racks. To raise the magazine to such a prestigious level, Miranda has sacrificed everything -- marriages, vacations, family. Her latest need, however, is fairly simple: a new office assistant. Enter Andy Sachs (Anne Hathaway, HOODWINKED) a frumpy looking young lady who recently graduated from Northwestern University with a degree in journalism. Andy tries to use her position at Runway Magazine as a stepping stone to bigger and better jobs, but is soon sucked into the high-price, high-pressure world of fashion. She rapidly becomes Mrs. Priestly's direct assistant and has to be on-call 24/7. This wreaks havoc on her relationship with boyfriend Nate (Adrian Grenier, ACROSS THE HALL) as she shows up late for dinners and even bypasses his birthday party.<br /><br />A dawning awareness of what she's become (or might become) soon hits Andy and she's forced into making a decision that'll affect the rest of her life. Should she stay with Mrs. Priestly and become a wealthy design assistant with an ulcer? Or should she follow her original dream of becoming a journalist? In a set of excellent circumstances where Mrs. Priestly really needs her, Andy finally makes her decision.<br /><br />It's a "stand up and applaud" moment for many viewers and even Meryl Streep's Miranda character seems pleased with Andy's choice ...right before she yells, "Go!" to her driver at the end of the film, indicating she may have approved of Andy's choice, but she's already made her own.<br /><br />Anne Hathaway pulls in a "beauty" of a part as Andy Sachs. Mrs. Hathaway is a great looking lady (even when "frumped" up) but I'd be willing to bet she's never been a size six! She's so tiny!<br /><br />But Meryl Streep's performance is simply amazing. Her b!tchy, bossy, hardheaded, businesswoman performance was absolutely perfect! When she first meets Hathaway's character and says, "You don't have any fashion sense."<br /><br />And Andy says, "Well I do, it's just--"<br /><br />"That wasn't a question," Streep interrupts.<br /><br />That exchange sets the stage for this dynamite relationship between the two.<br /><br />If Streep doesn't get at least a few award nominations this year for her performance, I'll be highly disappointed.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>All that buzz that surrounded Meryl Streep's Oscar-Nominated performance in `The Devil Wears Prada' was deserved, seriously.  But what gets me is the fact that she's really the only one who got the attention despite the fact that three other performances carry this movie just as well as she does, and one of them even outshines her quite a bit.  This is truly an extraordinary movie because it had all the potential to become nothing more than summer comedy tripe but instead, thanks to the wonderful script and brilliant comedic performances, it became one great movie.  From Streep's Cruella turn to Hathaway's wide-eyed innocence to Tucci's comedic timing to the magnificent scene stealing Blunt in what should have landed her an Oscar, everyone here contributes to the greatness that is `The Devil Wears Prada'.<br /><br />The film follows Andrea, a young journalist looking to make it big who finally gets a shot when she interviews for Miranda Priestly, editor of a New York fashion magazine.  She gets the job despite the fact that Miranda seems disinterested in her, but soon she finds that her new found profession may not be what she's been praying for.  Miranda is ruthless, able to be so successful because she has no heart, but this again is further proof that all that awards attention was justified.  Streep plays Priestly with so much conviction and emotion.  She's cold hearted and distant, but Streep gives her layers that we can find if we're willing to look.<br /><br />The question though is will Miranda destroy Andrea's good natured soul?<br /><br />Anne Hathaway is just darling in this film.  I'm really excited for where her career is headed.  I do feel bad for her in the fact that so far she's been in two films garnering other members of her cast awards attention while she just sits back and watches.  Maybe more so with `Brokeback Mountain' since everyone BUT her received an Oscar nomination, but even here when her performance was far more leading than Streep's yet Streep stole her thunder.  Alas, her performance is still memorable and I'm sure this young star is bound for some attention in the near future.  Stanley Tucci is also fantastic here as Priestly's right hand man.  He takes Andrea under his wing and shows her the ropes, helping her to make it in the cut throat world belonging the Miranda.  He's hilarious to watch, but still can't rise above the brilliance that is Emily Blunt.  Her performance here is comedic bliss.  She has the most memorable lines in the film, and her character is a piece of heaven.  Why she got passed up for the nomination for the 6-year old (8, 9 whatever) from the Sunshine movie is beyond me!<br /><br />So, the movie is great, literally.  I was actually shocked to like it as much as I did.  The plot may not really be anything new, and the moral lesson may be the same generic been-there-done that `learn to be a good person and not let the world change you just so you can succeed' type plot that most movies in this genre possess but it does it in such a fresh and exciting way that it's worth every single second.  So yes, Streep is brilliant and deserves the praise, but let's not forget the equally impressive performances that only added to her screen brilliance.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L43KWWR05PCS.html">A1L43KWWR05PCS</a><br/><p>This is the film adaptation of a best selling novel of the same name by Lauren Weisberg. My daughter, who loved the book, was home visiting and suggested that we rent the film. We did so and really enjoyed it. The film is a tightly scripted, well-directed one with excellent performances.<br /><br />The story turns around an aspiring journalist, Andrea Sachs (Anne Hathaway) who lives with her hunky boyfriend, Nate (Adrien Grenier), an aspiring chef. Having just graduated from college, Andrea is looking for a job and improbably gets one working for a top notch fashion magazine. Her job is to be second assistant to the Editor-in Chief herself, Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep), a veritable dragon lady before whom everyone kowtows. It is a job for which many would give their eyeteeth to have. Andrea, however, sees it just as a way station stop to becoming a legitimate journalist, as she is not at all interested in fashion, as evidence by the way she dresses.  Meanwhile, for Emily (Emily Blunt), the catty and acerbic newly promoted first assistant that lives in fear of Miranda Priestly, her job is her life.<br /><br />Thrust into the fashion maelstrom and thought of  as a size six fatty by all the size zeros with which she works, Andrea begins to change as the perks that go along with working for such a powerhouse fashion rag become apparent. The magazine's stylist (Stanley Tucci) ultimately helps Andrea pull together a look that serves to quell all criticism about her fashion sense.  This affects the way she dresses and, ultimately, the way she acts, as she starts emulating, to some degree, the dragon lady herself.  Moreover, the suave, sexy, and sophisticated Christian (Simon Baker), who is a serious and successful writer, sweeps Andrea off her feet.  As her relationships with her boyfriend and friends start to head south due to Andrea's absorption with her career, Andrea gets a wake-up call. The only question is whether she will answer it.<br /><br />Ms. Hathaway give a coltish and engaging performance as our erstwhile journalist, and Adrien Grenier is appealing as her heart stoppingly hunky, personal chef. Christian Baker is dead sexy as the serious writer who has designs on Andrea. Stanley Tucci gives a strong performance as the stylist who helps Andrea overcome her fashion faux pas. Emily Blunt is terrific as the harried first assistant.  The standout, however, is Meryl Streep. Her coolly understated, low key performance as the ruthless and powerful Miranda Priestly gives conviction to the adage that less is more.  Her very whisper commands attention, as her performance is that powerful and should not be missed by anyone who enjoys top notch acting.  The film leaves little doubt as to why Meryl Streep merited an Oscar nomination for Best Actress.</p></br><a href="../users/A29COAL60SB48B.html">A29COAL60SB48B</a><br/><p>I used to work for someone who was exactly like Meryl Streep's character Miranda Priestly (although it wasn't in a journalism setting, unfortunately), so I could relate to this movie all too well.<br /><br />Anne Hathaway's character of Andy Sachs was exactly the way I felt while working for this individual, and I could see myself living with my job the way Andy did with hers.  I felt like a new person when I finally quit that hellhole.<br /><br />I never did have the time for individuals such as the shallow and self-important people featured in the movie.  Everyone is out for #1, everyone is the boss, everyone is the only one who "gets it," and there's a tremendous amount of unnecessary backstabbing and cattiness that goes on.  And the ring leader of the circus (the head boss) just likes to see everyone jumpy and miserable (as Andy stated in a moment of frustration).<br /><br />Meryl Streep, as always, played a believeable mega-boss in Miranda Priestly.  She was so good that I had to remind itself it was just acting.  Anne Hathaway was her usual charming self.  She has worked very well with legendary actresses (who can actually act!) such as Streep and Julie Andrews and her movies with them are enjoyable to watch.<br /><br />"The Devil Wears Prada" is a great movie to show people the pitfalls of tossing aside everyone and everything that you know and love in your quest for number one - and how empty, lonely, and full of "drama" being at the top can be.  - Donna Di Giacomo</p></br><a href="../users/A1IWWRZJOXOSYP.html">A1IWWRZJOXOSYP</a><br/><p>"The Devil Wears Prada" is a funny fast-paced story about the world of high fashion.  Meryl Streeps' performance is riveting.  She has two Oscars (Best Supporting Actress for "Kramer vs. Kramer" 1979 & Best Actress for "Sophie's Choice" 1982).  "The Devil Wears Prada" was her 13th Oscar nomination.  For this film she won awards from the Golden Globes, London Film Critics Circle, National Society of Film Critics, Satellite Awards and Women's Film Critics Circle.  Her performance is an amazingly controlled one.  We see her as the quintessential difficult boss with snide quips and impossible demands.  The scene that totally makes the film for me is the one where she sits in the hotel in Paris without makeup and tells Andy about her latest divorce.  Her disappointment is so real, muted and emotionally deep that it throws all of the rest of the character into perspective.<br /><br />Anne Hathaway's performance is easy to overlook, even though it is the lead.  Her basic chore as Andy Sachs is to make us like her.  She accomplishes this.  She goes from the one they call "the fat girl" to a high fashion professional meeting all of the demands and repeatedly placing job over her personal life.  At the film's climax, she makes her decision & changes course.  She doesn't have any wild quirks like Streep's Miranda Priestly or Emily Blunt's Emily, but she makes the film accessible for the viewer.<br /><br />British actress Emily Blunt plays the first assistant Emily.  (Did they rename the character or was this a coincidence?)  She won the Best Supporting Actress award from the London Film Critics Circle and has translated this high profile role into five upcoming films!  ("The Snow Goose," "The Girl in the Park," "Wind Chill," "The Great Buck Howard" & "The Jane Austin Book Club.")  Her snide quips and cold exterior are hysterically superficial as she treats Andy with a "kick the dog" mentality.<br /><br />Standley Tucci does a good job as Nigel.  His cold wisdom is so picky and prickly that we love to hate him instantly.  Adrian Grenier who was in several films I saw ("Cecil B. Demented" & "Hart's War") plays her boyfriend Nate.  His wide-eyed, slightly ethnic good looks play well opposite Hathaway.  Australian Simon Baker plays the writer Christian Thompson who eventually beds Andy in Paris.  He oozes romantic charm.<br /><br />"The Devil Wears Prada" is about superficiality and artifice, which may make some think that the film isn't about anything significant.  But at its heart is the desire to get ahead and success at all costs.  It asks the cogent philosophical question, "Does the end justify the means?"  However, it also presents a world of perfectionists for whom excellence is the standard.  I found the film funny and moving, filled with excellent performances.  Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>Ever rent a movie simply because nothing came out that week? I decided to check this out simply because there was nothing else I haven't seen and I'm not a guy that shys around from "chick flicks", well obvious ones anyway. I remember it was just sitting on my counter as I watched other movies but then I thought I'm going to have to watch this sooner or later so I popped it in and surprisingly, while it does have some minor faults, I was actually surprised that it wasn't terrible but it was actually...good?<br /><br />It's a cutthroat world in the fashion industry where people are essentially worried about wearing the right clothes, being skinny and caring about material things. This of course makes Andy, (nickname for Andrea so it's not a guy), a smart but inexperienced and a size-6, a fish out of water at a fashion magazine, headed by Miranda Priestley, a nasty brutally honest woman, or just plain brutal. Andy needs the job to get ahead with her career so she has to suck it up and track down everything Miranda asks including skirts she didn't specify as to what kind, an unpublished Harry Potter book and knowing how to drop off things at her house without any problems.<br /><br />I remember working at a radio station where I was essentially tasked to do a few tasks that required a lot of time to finish them properly which of course meant by myself and not having any assistance or deadline extensions. Like Andy, I felt like way too much for just one person so I actually did started to feel sympathy but only thing was Anne Hathaway didn't really feel completely stressed out but more annoyed than anything. Whether it was bad casting or direction, I don't know. Of course the scene-stealer is Meryl Streep who plays probably the meanest thing I've seen. The other cast members are fine in their roles but in terms of characters, Andy's friends seem a bit underdeveloped. We're meant to see the job strain carry over with them but it doesn't feel as it should be.<br /><br />Ultimately though the film's about people's obsession and with that we get a look into people obsessing on clothing and must say, despite Anne's Hathaway's slightly ok performance, she looks quite radiant in the various dresses, including some shots where she switches dresses thanks to directing and editing and it's a good use of it. I find it hard though to accept Andy's reluctance to be Miranda's assistant since it's just simply her way of going about things. Miranda isn't really a devil so much as really difficult so despite my radio station similarity, my case and Andy's were simply unfair but a case of "that's the way the world works" so it was hard for me to feel empathy on that but just a I-know-how-you-feel thing.<br /><br />Unlike some chick flicks where it just oozes with cliche and bad comedic writing like people all of a sudden tripping or banging their heads, Prada feels more like the smart-women's comedy, it goes more for situation comedy rather than a go-for-broke approach. While the story is fairly predictable, it's at least an enjoyable romp that you might forget as easily as the latest trend. Call it the bell-bottoms of movies so to speak.</p></br></body></html>

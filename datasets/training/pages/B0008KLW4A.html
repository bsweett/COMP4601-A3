Halle Berry does a good job with this character.  this catwoman i would say it is in it own class.</p></br><a href="../users/AL277B4AQCWBG.html">AL277B4AQCWBG</a><br/><p>Apart from the apparently unintended irony of a story about the evils of the beauty industry being played out by a digitally-enhanced Halle Berry and a post-operative plastic mannequin formerly known as Sharon Stone, there's something far more seriously wrong with "Catwoman": it's just terminally boring.  It's yet another of those "origins of the superhero" movies merely laying the groundwork for an abortive franchise.  There's nothing wrong with an "origins" story per se, and this one at least has the foresight to turn it into a murder mystery.  Problem is, it takes Patience Phillips (aka Catwoman) approximately 100 minutes to get to precisely the same place the audience is in after just 15: we already know who "killed" her and why.  Watching her slowly, painfully - even if gorgeously - discover what we've known all along isn't fun.  It's agonizing.  The saddest thing is, it doesn't need to be this way.  Tim Burton's "Batman" showed everyone - fifteen years ago! - how the superhero story can and should be told: just assume everyone already knows who the hero is and where s/he came from, and focus instead on creating a gripping adventure and a wonderful villain; flashback to the "origins" story if you like, but why make that the focus if it's going to be dull?  Basically, follow the principles of good storytelling: create a mystery, make us identify with the hero, give the audience reason to keep watching to the end.  Some of the best popcorn movies in recent memory follow precisely that pattern - "I, Robot", "Minority Report", and the "X-Men" series.  In "Catwoman", most of the effort (and budget) seems to have been spent on a handful of absurdly edited and utterly unconvincing fight sequences and some ludicrously elaborate fly-overs of the city skyline.  But no amount of digital trickery can compensate for what has got to be the lamest script this year.  It's about time the John Brancato / Michael Ferris writing duo were exposed for the talentless hacks they are.  "The Game" was their only decent offering, and even that had to be saved by David Fincher's direction.  "Catwoman 2"?  You're all dreaming.</p></br><a href="../users/A2C21DQ4FQARGV.html">A2C21DQ4FQARGV</a><br/><p>This was a great movie. It moved a little slow sometimes but other than that it was really good. And Benjamin Bratt is hot.</p></br><a href="../users/AWG2O9C42XW5G.html">AWG2O9C42XW5G</a><br/><p>Halle Berry Might not be michelle pipfer but she did pull off this movie. she was hot in this film. this movie does take a diffrent look on the catwoman character. this is awesome movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3V5DUZ5KXPGQA.html">A3V5DUZ5KXPGQA</a><br/><p>I rented this film not too long ago to see how terrible it was and I find that the criticism was mostly justified! I say mostly because I rather liked Halle's performance as Patience Phillips/Catwoman and not just for the suggestive poses and the skin tight leather! Her acting in this film is actually quite good in my view. Too bad the script sucked a*#! Her supporting cast was mediocre at best. Bennjamin Bratt (who is usually pretty good) was flat in this and Sharon Stone was just plain awful!<br /><br />I actually didn't mind that this was a different Catwoman but I though some nod to the previous character Selena Kyle should've been included somewhere.<br /><br />Overall, its not the WORST film in history but I wouldn't recommend it for a buy. A rental or if you must buy it, get it used or at a reduced price. Again, Halle is the only redeeming thing in this whole film for BOTH her effort as an actress (considering the script she was given) and the outfit! Beyond that, I can't really recommend this film.</p></br><a href="../users/AYWAY5MKLAITN.html">AYWAY5MKLAITN</a><br/><p>When it comes to comic-book spin off movies; this is the worst case scenrio moment, ladies and gentlemen.<br /><br />Here we have one Pateince Phillips ( This is not the same woman in BATMAN RETURNS. That secreatary was named Selina Kyle and was the love interest in BATMAN RETURNS.), a shy, awkward, intellectually misunderstood woman who uncovers a supposedly deadly secret: The cosemetics company she works for is being ambushed by someone putting poisens into the products. After witnessing the criminals talking, she follows a series of piping that eventually leads to her downfall. She is ressurected, somehow, by cats, and is on a juorney of special-ability discovering.<br /><br />If you ask me, the story is all hype and style and no substance. It's a mock up to the legendary villian that is CATWOMAN. Although Halle Berry looks the part it's just too sloppy of a plot. It's good for a thought but not for a whole movie.<br /><br />There's even moments of a CGI catwoman. God Help them is all I have to say.<br /><br />Along with some crooked lines and too many musical cues, this makes for a music video of Catwoman, Muscial Montage, that is just too long for comfort and too silly to be a movie. They should have left it alone or tried again.<br /><br />Final verdict: Curiousity didn't kill the cat . . .the movie did.</p></br><a href="../users/AIFXFHO2N9WJB.html">AIFXFHO2N9WJB</a><br/><p>Where to start, where to start?  "Catwoman" is simply horrible, there is nothing in this movie that makes it worth watching, not even Halle Berry.  The story is simple and too stupid to be put into any film, the characters are paper-thin, and the CGI effects work is the worst.  I watched the movie all the way through, hoping it would at some point become interesting, but it never does.  If for some reason you are still interested in what this movie is about then read the next paragraph, if all you want is to read about how bad it is, then skip the next paragraph and read on.<br /><br />"Catwoman" of course is based on the character from DC Comics, she is a cat-burglar with an obsession for all things feline (hence the name).  Commonly used as a villain for Batman and at the same time a lover or sorts for Batman.  This movie pretty much ignores everything about Batman, and Catwoman's origins from the comics.  In fact, there are no references to Batman at all in this film.  The story goes like this, Patience Phillips (Halle Berry) works for a cosmetic firm, that is secretly making cosmetics that cause people to deteriorate and therefore, require more makeup from the same company.  Patience discovers this plot and is killed for her discovery, only to be resurrected by cats.  Now Patience has returned to life, but she's more cat-like than human, she likes kitty litter, sleeping on the roof, really stupid stuff that the director and writer probably thought would be cool in the movie but comes off laughable.  Patience eventually turns to crime and dons various costumes to become Catwoman before settling on the final costume which every guy that has seen a commercial or poster for this film knows very well.  It's the bikini top, with shredded leather pants, and a crappy looking mask.  For the most part the moment Halle dons this costume is the best part in the entire film, because this costume really shows off Halle's "assets", which is about the only redeeming quality in this film.  Once this happens of course we are led into the final showdown between Catwoman and the villain of the film (I don't remember her name, but she's played by Sharon Stone).  After the fight the movie ends and Catwoman is left roaming the streets hoping to get a sequel, but God-wiling that will never happen, and the audience runs out of the theater threatening to sue the director, who goes by the name "Pitof" for stealing 90 minutes of their life away.<br /><br />The acting in this movie is simply terrible, one would think that Halle Berry being an Oscar winner would do a better job, but of course she didn't have much to work with here.  Really she shouldn't have even chosen to do this film, I mean to go from Oscar winner to this is terrible.  Sharon Stone, who for some reason is shown in this movie with what appears to be a soft glow around her, possibly to hide her wrinkles, is laughable as the villain.  Hopefully Sharon's return to her greatest character, Catherine Tremmel in "Basic Instinct 2: Risk Addiction" will be much better.  Benjamin Bratt as a cop chasing Catwoman and as Patience's love interest is worthless in this film.  The CGI work is beyond horrible, in this modern age of technology and with all of the great special effects used in movies, you would think they would have done a better job.  I mean, it was so obvious every time they used CGI in this film, it was even used for some of the scenes of Catwoman walking around.<br /><br />Overall, a terrible movie with a beautiful lead actress that should have known better than to say yes to this picture.  I would not recommend watching this movie at all, not even if you are wanting to make fun of a movie, there are plenty of other bad movies that are still watchable that you can make fun of, this one is just not worth the jokes you could throw at it.<br /><br />If for some reason, you do decide to watch this movie, here is the reason it is rated PG-13.<br /><br />"Catwoman" is rated PG-13 for stylized violence, language, and sexuality.</p></br><a href="../users/A3TNM3C9ENUCFW.html">A3TNM3C9ENUCFW</a><br/><p>Halle Berry has certainly got the look (and "got milk?" in one fun scene), in this attempt to bring the marvel character up to date, but sadly that's about it. The most recent comparison would of course have to be Michelle Pfeiffer as the leather clad feline fighter in Tim Burtons Batman Returns, and whereas I understand characters must evolve with the times, they should not be changed altogether. Pfeiffer and Burton came close to encapsulating the multi faceted role, whereas this time around the production team and director seem to have missed by a mile. Ms Berry plays Patience Phillips, a Plain Jane artist, seeking her inner self, and trapped working for a large cosmetic conglomerate as a designer. She overhears something bad about the companies latest product and is dispatched forthwith, by the villainous Sharon Stone, as wife to the head of the company. Reborn with the aid of a mystical Egyptian Mau cat, and a seemingly all wise "little old lady" she emerges as Catwoman, and sets about bringing her erstwhile foes to justice, and in so doing discover her true self. The visual distraction of her in a costume that would have fried the censors back in the 60's may be enough for adolescents, or the less demanding viewer, but this is a pretty poor attempt really. The darkness and depth of the Marvel creation is never seen, as Ms Berry plays out a little girl lost turned Vigilante with a muddled ambivalence. Staying well inside the Politically Correct (PC) line, she is almost shown as a goody two shoes, reluctantly playing a part and keeping everyone happy, rather than getting inside the storybook character. Another BIG complaint for me is the CGI fusion with live action. Much like the "Blade" movies, seeing a cartoon computer overlay scramble up walls, flip, turn, jump and perform inhuman stunts doesn't work I'm afraid, even if you do seemlessly match it with the actor in places. Even impressive SfX should compliment a films story,  NOT try and carry it altogether. There are some nice extra's on the DVD however, and the story is not too ridiculous. The supporting cast are sound, and the visuals OK, but you keep feeling that the script writer and director should have taken the plunge a little more, rather than just dipping their toes into an Iconic character such as they have here. OK for a wet afternoon, and a PG audience, but that's about it. Disappointing.</p></br><a href="../users/A2WP0GOTX13MG4.html">A2WP0GOTX13MG4</a><br/><p>'Catwoman' stars Halle Barry as the title character who brought back from death by a breed of Egyptian cats.  Patience Phillips, Catwoman's alter ego, was murdered by the henchmen of a major makeup producing company when Patience discovers a secret she and the public weren't suppose know about.  Now, as Catwoman, Patience is out to get her revenge.<br /><br />This movie if fun, but there is not a lot to get excited about.  The best part of the movie is Berry's portrayal of a woman that is part cat.  From hissing at dogs to quick head movements while watching fish in a tank, Berry did a good job adding cat manerisms to the character.  She moved like a cat in many of the fight scenes.<br /><br />The ridiculous part of this character was the costume.  The idea was lots of leather and skin.  While Halle looked dynamite, the costume was too far gone from the traditional catwoman outfit.  The costume that Michelle Pfeiffer wore in 'Batman Returns' was far superior.<br /><br />The other actors in the movie were largely misused.  Benjamin Bratt plays an officer that is too far off the character he once portrayed in 'Law & Order.'  However, we don't get much of a chance to really know his character.  His character essentially boils down to sensitive hunk cop.  Sharon Stone looked good in her role as one of the villains, but her screen time and motivations as a character were way too limited.  Her and the other villain's scheme was largely laughable and highly inplausible.<br /><br />While there were some good action scenes, they weren't anything spectacular or original.  Many of them were reminiscent of the fights from the 'Batman' series.  The climatic battle in the end just came off as ridiculous.<br /><br />Overall, the movie was fun, but it was also a disappointment.  As mentioned earlier, the characters were misused and underdeveloped.  Another twenty to thirty minutes might have done this movie some good.  So would some revisions on the script.  Anyway, its worth a rental, but not worthy of adding to my collection.<br /><br />Overall:  2.75 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A2CT2SA6KFE8GC.html">A2CT2SA6KFE8GC</a><br/><p>Common sense kept me away from this film, but I happened to catch some of it.  I didn't catch much, but something tells me I really didn't need to see more than I did.  First off, it's directed by a guy who uses only one name to address himself.  That's a big no-no, especially if you're a nobody.  Second, and this is the most valid point:  How in the hell can you take an insanely sexy concept like Catwoman and an insanely sexy woman like Halle Berry and completely screw it up so it isn't sexy at all??  Only Hollywood can.</p></br><a href="../users/A3O536E2YOKK4Y.html">A3O536E2YOKK4Y</a><br/><p>Ignoring the all-important fact that the catwoman in this movie is not the same character from the comics, take a gander at the dorky catwoman mask. The gay "costume designer" who came up with that hideous thing should be banished from Hollywood forever. Although Halle Berry is an undeniably good-looking woman, she looks anything BUT appealing wearing that dorky mask. What a travesty!</p></br><a href="../users/ASJ89T42CIUHU.html">ASJ89T42CIUHU</a><br/><p>After all of the promotional hype I expected something more from this movie than a catty meow! But I guess comic book subjects aren't rocket science. I just can't understand why Oscar winner Halle Berry would claw her way to the bottom so soon.<br /><br />Catwoman (Halle Berry) rises from the spirit of an ancient cat who breathes new life into a lowly ad-woman. By the light of a full moon Catwoman stalks her prey beginning with ancient jewelry, as a "cat-burglar" and suddenly becoming a crime fighting kitty with heart. Both in and out of costume Catwoman seduces Detective Tom Lone (Benjamin Bratt) with her feline charms. The bad guys run a cosmetics company that fights the aging but makes one sick in the process. Laurel and George Hedare (Sharon Stone/Lambert Wilson) eventually become Miss Kitty's prey in this predictable tale out of Gotham.<br /><br />This overly done film is pretty much a music video for pretty little Halle Berry to strut her well developed stiff to. So it will always appeal to the easily pleased young male mindset. However it is a disappointment to see such a wonderful actress fall so low in the ranks after winning a well deserved Oscar (for Monster's Ball). The costumes and prowling scenes are posed for the young video game enthusiast. The action shots are obviously computer generated and the cuts between the two are simply horrible. Bratt and Berry are convincing enough as romantic leads but somehow lose their context within this movie. Sharon Stone is the one standout, playing a more than convincing aging menace to society.....and she looks great doing it. If you are a Gotham fan looking for good Catwoman material try Michelle Pfeiffer in the role in Tim Burton's film "Batman Returns" (1992), Pfeiffer does a much better job as the playful kitty. Sadly Halle should stick to what she does best DRAMA and leave the meowing to another litter of up and coming starlets without their reputation at stake.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EAU736LWTDCE.html">A3EAU736LWTDCE</a><br/><p>My problem with the movie is she is made to be a hero and a woman with a guilty conscience. Catwoman is a VILLIAN (hello!) she would not write letters of apology or save another persons life. The irony of this movie was sharron stone played more of the roll of the real cat woman then Halle did. This is the dumbest conversion of comic to movie I've ever seen. Cat woman is evil you dorks!<br /><br />How to make this movie a success?<br /><br />Give it the R rating. Make her brutally rip people apart.

Berry stars as a woman who loves cats & after a fatal drowning turns into a human cat, complete with superhuman feline prowess. Sharon Stone co-stars as the main villianess, that Berry seeks to claim vengence upon.<p>I've seen the film and it sucks. Big time. It was a bad idea to turn away from the legendary story of Catwoman (Catwoman is a master burglar & overall thief in the "Batman" comics) and try to take a different more mystical, superhero route with it. After "Batman Returns" came out in the summer 1992, it was quite a hot idea to have a spin-off film with the femme feline in her own film. But, with Michelle Pfeiffer passing on the project early on (she was the original Cat in "Batman Returns". She was hot too!) & the death of the Batman franchise, thanks to the stinkie, cheese bomb that is known as "Batman & Robin", who the hell cares !?!<p>Warner Bros. needs to really smarten up stop making garbage like this. <p>Release the hounds, this cat plays in its own litter box.</p></br><a href="../users/A28GCEHD00JFZG.html">A28GCEHD00JFZG</a><br/><p>Catwoman: 3 out of 10: Halle Berry isn't the first actor to squander Oscar gold (F. cough Murray cough Abraham) but I can't recall an actor doing it so quickly.<br /><br />Sure Oscar winners have old films embarrassingly show up on DVD and after a few years and ex-wives they will take a paycheck role in some European schlock. But in your next movie in which you are the star?<br /><br />Berry isn't awful as simply horrible miscast (lacks a certain erotic nastiness for the role.) and apparently doesn't have the acting chops to make up the difference. One must speculate how the studio felt when the first rushes came in. It sounded so good on paper and Berry is such a big star it's doubtful that any screen test was done. Now the evidence is in front of them and the enormity of the casting mistake is obvious. Was anyone in that room brave enough to admit the emperor has no clothes?<br /><br />Now Berry is hardly the worst actor in the movie (Alex Borstien as the fat horny comic relief is pretty awful but the honors go to Frances Conroy as the cat lady who is so awful one wonders if she has ever had a conversation with another human.)<br /><br />(On a side note it really is amazing that I list the worst actors and Benjamin Bratt doesn't make the cut. Now that is some bad acting.)<br /><br />(On another even more aside note I list the worst actors and Sharon Stone doesn't make the list. Good lord somebody call Guinness)<br /><br />While the movie overall is not nearly as bad as its reputation led me to believe, Catwoman still falls short.<br /><br />Along with the acting there is the horrible horrible (did I mention horrible) music which sounds like a 13 year old girls idea of what is hip; a lot of silly jumping around the city scenes; and the coup de grace, the Ferris wheel scene.<br /><br />Now no-one wants to see Catwoman save cherub face boy from carny ride gone bad'come to think of it no-one wants to see Batman do this either. The direction and scripting on this scene is bad' Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever bad. Between this and the main villain being a cosmetic tyrant whose anti-aging cream is faulty the lightweight plot is not doing the movie any favors.<br /><br />Superhero Karma at the theater is returned. For every Dark Knight there is a Catwoman. This movie might be awful by every conceivable measurement but it helps return a cosmic balance to the universe.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>I admire the approach the filmmakers have taken towards "Catwoman,"  for rather than setting their tale in the same dark, cavernous, largely computer-generated metropolis we are used to in most of these superhero movies, they have chosen to keep it rooted more in the real world.  In a similar way, they manage to keep Catwoman herself believable, vulnerable and realistic, thanks in no small part to the beautiful and beguiling Halle Berry in the title role.<br /><br />Berry plays Patience Phillips, a pretty, but less-than-glamorous advertising artist who works for a major cosmetics company, ruled over by a tyrannical CEO and his equally ruthless wife, the former spokes model for their products.  When Patience mistakenly overhears the corporate bigwigs discussing the fact that one of their best-selling creams is causing women to become seriously ill, she is dutifully murdered by a couple of the boss' henchmen.  However, all is not lost for Patience, for, unbeknownst to her, she has been chosen to receive the special gift of reincarnation in the form of a cat woman who will no longer be subject to the laws of either nature or society.<br /><br />The best parts of "Catwoman" involve Patience's incrementally becoming more and more catlike in her attitude and demeanor, and her slowly dawning realization of what is happening to her.  It takes awhile for her to accept this surprising turn of events, but, when she does, she becomes, quite literally, a new woman, bold, self-confident and willing to take on the oppressors and evildoers in our society.  Patience is paired up with an attractive police officer (apparently the only one ever on duty in that city), who gradually comes to realize who and what she is as well.  Berry and Benjamin Bratt make a very appealing romantic couple, and their scenes together are some of the best in the movie.  Also impressive is Sharon Stone who deserves credit for allowing herself to appear in a role in which her "fading" beauty plays such a significant part (shades of Vivien Leigh playing Blanche DuBois in "A Streetcar Named Desire").  Stone is the villainous wife of the company's CEO who is determined to make sure Catwoman doesn't spill the beans on their defective product.<br /><br />The special effects are probably the least successful aspect of this film.  Catwoman's jumping from rooftop to rooftop looks an awful lot like CGI effects to me.  And the movie does occasionally go on auto pilot (especially towards the end), though, thankfully, not usually for very long.  The literal cat fight between Berry and Stone at the finale is necessary, I guess, but really rather silly overall.<br /><br />Still, considering the pounding this movie received from both critics and audiences when it was first released in the summer of 2004, I wound up being pleasantly surprised at just how enjoyable "Catwoman" turned out to be.</p></br><a href="../users/A141HP4LYPWMSR.html">A141HP4LYPWMSR</a><br/><p>How could you make a film starring the lovely Halle Berry in the starring role wearing a very revealing costume most of the time and still have a disaster on your hands. I'm sure the director Pitof would like to know.<br /><br />Positives: Halle Berry has one of the prettiest faces and figures in film today. You'll probably watch the movie from beginning to end for that reason alone. Benjamin Bratt is terrific as Tom Lone, police detective and love interest to Patience "Catwoman" Phillips and Frances Conroy (Ophelia) provides some much needed depth and occult mystery to the plot as the historian and guardian of the Egyptian Goddess Baast and the "Secret Society of Catwoman."<br /><br />Negatives: Sub-par special effects, silly plot and a little too much S&M motif in the choice of costume for my taste.</p></br><a href="../users/AUTBHG6070SL4.html">AUTBHG6070SL4</a><br/><p>It has Halle Berry displaying a lot of Halle Berry. If you're a fourteen year old boy, or were one, that's probably enough. She doesn't display too much though - mothers of those boys need not worry.<br /><br />The action is strong and bloodless, the minor romantic themes are chaste, and Berry defeats the evil empress of the beauty products empire. (I did say this was a comic book, right?) Some of the "cat" scenes are laugh-out-loud funny, like falling off the shelf.<br /><br />The effects are generally good, and the CGI cats are surprisingly good. It's competent and well made, of its sort, but probably not one for the ages. Well, they don't all have to be. It's a great popcorn movie.<br /><br />//wiredweird</p></br><a href="../users/AER15RIMV8E6D.html">AER15RIMV8E6D</a><br/><p>I have owned this movie for six years, and I finally watched it last night. I honestly don't understand all the low ratings. I know that Catwoman was a villain in the Batman comics and movies, but this was a new version for a new generation. Berry plays Patience Phillips, who is a shy artist working for a cosmetics company. While she is delivering a new design to her boss, she overhears a plot to sell defective beauty products that will make your skin decay. She is murdered and reborn after a cat with supernatural abilities breathes new life inside her. Soon, Patience slowly transforms into Catwoman, and tries to bring her killer to justice. I highly recommend CATWOMAN!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A2XGJ56VCFOKKZ.html">A2XGJ56VCFOKKZ</a><br/><p>I had bad expectations of this film after hearing last summer how widely panned it was and based on the trailer, which didn't really make this film a "must see" for me.  I'm glad I waited, though it wasn't nearly as bad as I expected, and it could stand to be a lot better.<br /><br />First of all, choosing Halle Berry for the latest incarnation of Catwoman was the best decision the producers could make.  She makes a perfect Catwoman and does a great job.  Her costume is better than the one Michelle Pfeiffer used in "Batman Returns", though I still didn't like her mask.  Halle Berry is the best thing about this movie, especially with her whip appeal and sexy moves.  One scene I like in particular is the basketball game between Detective Tom Lone (Benjamin Bratt) and Patience Phillips (Halle Berry), with the hip urban groove music matching the flow and rhythm of the game, which is more a physical flirtation between the two than an actual game.  This occurs when Patience is just learning about her new dexterous style.<br /><br />Now, for the bad...which is nearly everything else about the film.  The plot is flimsy and reminiscent of the first Tim Burton "Batman" film...cosmetics that does more harm and requires continuous use to prevent the scars on one's face.  Patience Phillips is a mousy commercial artist who is so timid and afraid of the boss (played by Lambert Wilson, best known as the Merovingian of the two "Matrix" sequels and essentially plays the same role in this film) that she takes his abuse and scorn.  Sharon Stone plays the wife of Monsieur Hedere, who's every bit as schemeing as her husband, though a bit more deadly.  This leads to the inevitable "cat fights" between Halle Berry and Sharon Stone.<br /><br />Someone complained about Patience Phillips being a mousy lady, but that's the point, at least with Selena Kyle (the original alter-ego of Catwoman).  The transformation of a mousy lady into a fierce, feline, femme fatale is the whole point about Catwoman and the empowerment of such a role.  That's why Patience is "mousy" at first.  What bothered me most about this film is Patience's sidekick, a white co-worker who practically pushes Patience on a date with Detective Tom Lone, and who wants the scoop on every little detail.  It was especially a cringe-worthy moment to hear this plumpy, dumpy white woman tell Patience, "give me my props!" and trying to act hip and cool.  It totally rang false.  The whole friendship between the two of them didn't see authentic, but was a mere contrivance to give Patience a friend that plays a semi-important role for the purposes of dialogue.  Now about that dialogue...very cliched and cheesy (such as Catwoman grabbing hold of a baddie's tongue and then saying, "cat got your tongue?").  The film is full of horrendous dialogue.<br /><br />Another complaint about the film is that too many scenes took place in industrial buildings.  It was just unoriginal and not very exciting.  It lends a sort of "been there, done that, seen that" blase to the whole film.  There's really nothing in here that screams to be seen, that just wows you the way the two "Spider-man" films do.  That movie has heart, this one doesn't.  My final critique is that the background music was often annoyingly distracting and didn't fit the scene (except for the basketball one-on-one game).  The people who made this film either tried to hard or didn't try hard enough...its not very original, exciting, or worth the money and time spent on it.  Halle Berry as Catwoman is the only good thing about this film and she makes it worth watching at least once.  Take her out of the equation and the film is third-rate, first draft stuff that should never have been given the greenlight.  Because this film bombed, there's little chance that a better made sequel will ever get made, which is a shame.  There's so many things one can do with a Catwoman film, but this film isn't it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1E85KPLPYVW8E.html">A1E85KPLPYVW8E</a><br/><p>On one of the featurettes on this DVD one of the producers of 2004's Catwoman states "I think everyone will forget all the other Catwomen when they see her (Berry's) portrayal." WRONG! This complete failure of a movie shouldn't even be compared to any of its Batman predecessors, television and film included. For one, Halle Berry's performance is much more inferior than Michelle Pfeiffer's classic Catwoman performance in Batman Returns. Two, this has nothing to do with its Batman origins. Remember how Batman Returns ended? Why couldn't they have done a movie that showed what Catwoman did after Batman Returns? That would've been so much more interesting than just a stupid, horribly executed, weak storylined spin-off-but-not-really-a-spin-off piece of crap.<br />Aside from all that, all the acting in this movie completely sucked, Halle Berry included. The only moderately okay performance was from Sharon Stone, and even that wasn't that great. I couldn't stand all of Catwoman's horribly cheesey one liners, and there were some seriously ridiculous scenes in the movie that just made me laugh at the stupidity of it all. The scene where Patience (Berry) is rubbing the catnip ball all over her nose. I hope to God Halle realized how stupid she really looked when she saw the final cut. That seriously should've been a deleted scene. And the basketball scene. Don't even get me started there. But the most ridiculous scene was where Patience becomes Catwoman. A magical egyptian cat breathes his Cat Powers into her mouth after she was killed? Have all the writers in Hollywood gone retarded? Of course the scene is equipped with some overly dramatic music. Quite hilarious actually.<br />The only thing this movie had going for it was its sleek and fast visual style which was hardly enough to compensate for everything else that just sucked immensely.</p></br><a href="../users/AB2AQMK9PCWWX.html">AB2AQMK9PCWWX</a><br/><p>....the movie ain't *that* bad, although I wouldn't compare it to Citizen Kane. Besides, you get Berry in that Catwoman suit (Berry continues to provide some jaw dropping moments in cinema.) as well as a fight scene with Sharon Stone who coulda been a Catwoman condender herself. S'More for the Daddies in the family than for the kids...Again, I'd like to say if there's a movie made of a famous comic book character, count on these *experts* to debunk the product because it doesn't fit their mind's eye after years of studying the character....if the director doesn't exhibit some degree of pretension or geekiness, these *experts* make it harder on some productions. Bump that. See this for yourself and draw your own conclusions.</p></br><a href="../users/A146D2LYLICNLS.html">A146D2LYLICNLS</a><br/><p>I'll start by saying that I'm a fan of "Catwoman." I, along with many other fans, like it mainly because of Halle Berry, not because the actual movie is very good. We have to admit that as a whole, this movie is quite mediocre.<br /><br />But now that the DVD has finally come out, I've decided to raise my review to 4 stars. My opinion of the movie has not changed; Halle Berry makes it what it is. I've added on the extra star strictly for this DVD presentation, which is quite impressive. If you didn't like the movie in the theaters then obviously you won't be getting this DVD and might as well stop reading this review right now. But if you're a fan and are thinking about whether you should get the DVD, I strongly urge you to.<br /><br />For one, it has a great transfer with superb sound and picture quality. Colors are vibrant and bright. Blacks are rich and deep, which helps a lot since most of the movie takes place at night. Simply put, this is a DVD that will go quite well with your home theater system.<br /><br />Bonus features are quite good. The "Many Faces of Catwoman" segment has all the actresses who played the role of Catwoman tell about her character, the story of Catwoman, her attributes, and their own opinions and experiences playing that role. This is definitely the gem of the DVD. The other segment, a behind-the-scenes section, is fairly standard stuff and is pretty much the same as any other behind-the-scenes feature. There are several deleted scenes which are worth watching such as when Patience first gets transformed into Catwoman and is chased by a few dogs at a junkyard. Finally, there is an alternate ending which is the actual ending from the Elizabeth Hand novel. It has a more romantic feel to it and I can see why it wasn't chosen for the movie's theatrical ending.<br /><br />All in all, a great DVD. Now only if they released the darn soundtrack! How long do we have to wait for that??!!</p></br><a href="../users/A37ZOGOK3GKF2P.html">A37ZOGOK3GKF2P</a><br/><p>Meow!  Here kitty, kitty.  Halle Berry looked hot, I mean red, white, and blue hot in that leather suit, but gave little effort as Patience, her "human" alter-ego.  The stunts were well done, the fight sequences were awesome at times, and Sharon Stone as the villain was purr-fect.  This film is destined to the "Grease 2", "Xanadu," and other camp-o-rama classics hall of fame.  It's so silly at times, you expect to see "BOOM!" "BOP!" accross the screen its almost disappointing you don't.  Still the film is pretty enough to enjoy.  Good rainy afternoon, popcorn entertainment.  Now where did I put my catnip?  Here, Halle Kitty!</p></br><a href="../users/A1R2URG8OHNEDS.html">A1R2URG8OHNEDS</a><br/><p>"Catwomen" was directed by a guy named Pitof, and it's a good thing that he is using a fake name, because after this mess, he's not going to want to put that name on anything Hollywood makes again. This is one mess of a movie, and I sensed it from the ads, but since I give everything the benefit of the doubt, I had to go check it out. Halle Berry gives one of the worst performance ever, but she was never that great of an actress anyway. I never saw the preformance that she won an Oscar for, "Monsters Ball," but anything has to be better than this. Sharon Stone was awful as well, and Benjamin Bratt, who was never really that good anyway. The script was so weak, with awful lines, horrible situations, and of course, cliche's galore. There was a scene where Berry and Bratt was at a county fair, on a ferris wheel, and there is an electrical breakdown, and somebody almost falls off the wheel, but it's Catwomen to the rescue. There was another classic Berry/Bratt scene where they were playing basketball, and she used all of her new cat skills and cat powers to beat him. Throughout the entire movie there is a sexual undertone, and even when her character and Bratt's character "make love" he does wake up with a scratch on his back. It's actually pretty lame, but briefly funny. I also couldn't understand if Catwomen was supposed to be bad or not. I know that Sharon Stone's character was bad, but Catwomen fights her, which is the good side, but then she robs a jewerly store, which was her bad side. There was so coherent background to the character, and the movie feels like it was made in about eight seconds.<br /><br />The movie actually starts with opening credits, which actually steals the little attention that you would want to have while watching this film. Halle Berry plays Patience Phillips, a young women who has too much patience to put up with all of the people at work. She works at Hedare Beauty, with her friend Sally, and always puts up with her boss George. His wife, Laurel, the face of the business, is going to retire, just as the company is releasing a new product that will reverse aging. The product does have a side effect, a terrible awful horrible one, and Patience ends up seeing the meeting that discusses it. She runs away, but ends up drowning in the ocean, or a lake, I can't remember. But, cats end up resurrecting her, because of Egyptian Mau, who used to hang out in old temples, but has been found around Patiences apartment. There is even a scene where she tries to stop it from jumping off a ledge, and a cop thinks that she was going to kill herself. Enter Tom, who is a cop. When Patience wakes up, her eyes go from the human pattern to the cat pattern, which was one of the lamest special effects I could think of. Patience doesn't remember anything, so she sets out to find out who killed her. She becomes Catwomen, with the slick, letal, sex like, whipping attire, but is then framed for murder. Tom begins to persue Patience, but then things begin to connect, and he could find out who Catwomen really is. . .<br /><br />There was no point in "Catwomen" being made. It has to be the worst superhero movie I have ever seen, and I didn't even know if she was supposed to be a hero or not. I could think of so many things wrong with it, that I can't even praise it. There was a scene where, before Patience discovers that she has powers, she is walking with her friend, and they pass a women walking her dog, and the dog barks at her, and she hisses. It was supposed to be funny, but it was just funny because it was so awful. You end up not caring what happens to anyone, because nobody is likeable enough to care. Tom is always right around the corner to make sure nothing is wrong, and Laurel is so bad that she is always waiting for Catwomen to arrive. It's hard to write a review where there is nothing to say that is good about a movie, because it's so one directional, so I'll sum it all up in a single sentence. With lame special effects, a hack script, and terrible acting and direction, I have to call "Catwomen" one of the worst movies of the year--after "The Girl Next Door," of course. I didn't like it, but you might.<br /><br />ENJOY!<br /><br />Rated PG-13 for action violence and some sensuality.</p></br><a href="../users/A3OMPSEVL59ZDK.html">A3OMPSEVL59ZDK</a><br/><p>Thought Van Helsing was the worst we would see this summer? Think again. Here comes Halle Berry in, what could be, the first huge failure of the summer, both critically and financially. Avoid this one at all costs folks. From the very start, the very idea of basing a film on a Batman villian was a bad idea. Turning her into a hero with super powers (catwoman has no powers, she's just at skilled theif) was a big mistake. With plenty of Marvel Films out there as great examples of HOW to do comic book films, WB's of course thinks they know better. Creating a film that is a mere shadow of the original character.<p>The supporting cast is also filled with terrible choices. Sharon Stone, Benjamin Bratt. When was the last time they made a good film? Remember Halle Berry and her terrible Storm perforomance in X-MEN? Have you SEEN Gothika? She should have her oscar ravoked for those atrocities. <p>Please be smart. Go watch something else this summer. Show WB that their contempt for the movie going audience has reached a new low. Catwoman deserves to bomb and than some.</p></br><a href="../users/A1OBPHRXHZF8P6.html">A1OBPHRXHZF8P6</a><br/><p>Missing her from Batman Returns (1992) I was initially delighted to hear that the Catwoman was being revived for her own big screen project. This character did not recieve her due in the original theatrical release. <p>Until I saw previews for this abomination of a film. <p>Since Eartha Kitt played Catwoman for a stint in the Adam West-era Batman, I am not bothered by the ethnicity of the character. I am concerned about the apparent 360 of the plot. <p>Selina Kyle is supposed to be a lowly executive assistant who eventually snaps and fights back. Nothing I have seen indicates the production crew is reasonably going to live up to the earlier release. It honestly looks like Charmed with fur and a tail. <p>Halle Berry is a good actress, but I must wonder what made her sign on to this train wreck in waiting. Not even her star power will be able to bail out this disaster.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>Reviled by most critics.  Winner of four Razzie awards.  A real loser, right?  Not really.  Granted, CATWOMAN is not a work of cinematic genius, nor is Halle Berry ever going to live down the fact that she made this movie after winning an Oscar.  But as far as lightweight, implausible entertainment, CATWOMAN's not really all that horrible.  It sometimes seems more like an episode of TV BATMAN, with its droll humorless humor, and it's tongue in cheek.  Just watching Berry sashay around on rooftops with that tremendous swing on her back porch is enough to classify this as camp entertainment.  Berry is joined by Benjamin Bratt as her cop boyfriend, and the delighftully catty Sharon Stone as the villainess.  It's really no worse than THE CROW or FANTASTIC FOUR; I think it got such bad reviews because we expect more from Berry?  Oh, well, I'm in the minority and that's purrrfectly okay with me.</p></br><a href="../users/A3S98L5B1SR9P1.html">A3S98L5B1SR9P1</a><br/><p>Although, this movie is filled with big names like Halle Berry and Sharon Stone, it lacked originality and substance. This movie started off right with it's brief tease of it's originality with scenes of "cat woman's" origin, but then got lost in the lack of thought in the story line thereafter. Making this movie very predictable and boring.  This movie depended on too many special effects and not enough realism to enjoy the characters. Even the romance scene was lacking the animal attraction and chemistry between the two characters, making their romance a very forgetable one.  Although, Ms.Berry is a very beautiful and attractive woman, this movie focused more on her sexual appeal in a cat suit instead of her ability to act. As she uses her whip and shows some skin to draw audiences, mainly of the male species, her true ability as an actress is over shadowed. Bottom-line: it was very disappointing to say the least.</p></br><a href="../users/A2J57EQ9KPGXR9.html">A2J57EQ9KPGXR9</a><br/><p>This movie is not great, but it is not awful either. I've seen films that are MUCH worse. You see, Catwoman used to be just another colorful Batman villian, a simple jewel thief with a costume, until writers at DC decided to make her a romantic interest (bye-bye Ertha Kitt, hello blonde bombshell Michelle Pfieffer)  which spawned the "Birds of Prey" comic and TV show.<br /><br />Now Halle Berry and director Pitof (I guess Dieter was busy) take a crack at putting Catwoman on the silver screen, delving into the whole quasi pro-feminist, Egyptian mythology based history behind this shallow comic character. I give them points for trying. The main villain is played by Sharon Stone, an evil cosmetics magnate who plans to sell bad makeup to the masses. It confirms my opinion: Sharon Stone cannot act but marries well.<br /><br />Yes, Halle Berry is grade-A hoochie material enhanced by the leather Catwoman costume (personally, she looks hotter in her Ororo X-Man costume) but SHE can act, which helps this film. Department store dummy Benjamin Pratt shows up as the love interest - YAWN...<br /><br />The fight scenes are OK, boarderline bad but I have seen worse (the last Batman film for example). Catwoman is worth a look, but buying it would'nt be a great idea.</p></br><a href="../users/A2A6NH6DPE0VXR.html">A2A6NH6DPE0VXR</a><br/><p>I've heard for years and years that they were gonna make a Catwomen movie with Michelle Pfeiffer returning as Selena Kyle. That never got off the ground though and stupidly Warner Brothers decided to do it without Selena Kyle. It bugged a lot of comic fans that they'd do it without even having the character from the comic. It's not even original either, she even becomes Catwomen the same way Pfeiffer did in Batman Returns. Plus it's played out like Halle Berry has 2 peronalities and she has no control what she does when she has on the costume. Which is pretty silly and doesn't work. Plus the direction is done like a music video, hell think the director even started out making music videos. The action is too fast and messy looking to even be entertaining. Not one once of the action scenes even look realistic.<br /><br />  I always thought that if Michelle Pfeiffer wouldn't come back that Sharon Stone could replace her. Instead of thinking...duh Sharon Stone could play Catwomen they cast her as an aging model obsessed with looking good. She has Halle Berry killed because she discovered that her aging make-up is dangerous. So Berry is brought back by cats and doesn't find it strange that she's more athletic and has a craving for cat food. She out plays Benjaman Bratt in Basketball and by jumping all over walls and being super athletic. Yet he doesn't figure out right away that she's catwomen. Oh plus she clawed his back when they had sex and...duh.<br /><br />  It's not a good movie, not by a long shot but still Batman & Robin makes it look like Spiderman 2.  Halle Berry thinks she's too good to have a small role in X-Men as Storm but hey at least those are good super hero movies. Plus after embarrassing herself in this she should settle for playing Storm with open arms. If they couldn't get Michelle Pfeiffer back they should've just said ok that's it...no movie. Either that or could've just had someone else play Selina Kyle. This movie is some fun here and there but the dialogue is awful. Plus isn't that much of a difference between Halle Berrie's performance here and Elizabeth Berkley's in Show Girls.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IO3LVYV5ZMK8.html">A1IO3LVYV5ZMK8</a><br/><p>Catwoman isn't a movie but more of a flashy music video that features raw special effects and is littered with cheesy dialogues with a lack of emotional core. Clearly this movie has deviated from the portrayal of the dark feline heroine to a lame exercise in waxing empowerment in women. Halle Berry is the lone bright spot in the movie, playing Catwoman with a sensual grace and giving us a convincing transformation from the silenced mousy designer Patience Philips to the heroine who battles an over-the-hill cosmetics mogul (Sharon Stone) out to destroy beauty. Seeing her prancing around in her tights and wielding the whip should be worth the ticket price for some. Catwoman clearly aspires to be a C-grade popcorn movie with high camp value. In this aspect, it succeeds - the bad script and exaggerated cat-fights really left me unexpectedly hysterical and even embarrassingly at times purring in delight.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>There is universal agreement that Halle Berry is a beautiful woman, and after winning the Academy Award for "Monster's Ball," she has the bona fides of a legitimate actress.  Hiring Berry to play "Catwoman" makes sense, because there is a tradition of the character being sexy and smart going all the way back to the campy "Batman" television series where Julie Newmarr and Eartha Kitt essayed the role of the felonious feline.  But when it becomes clear in this 2004 film that the primary emphasis of Halle Berry as Catwoman is on her breasts, then I think it is clear this movie has lost definitely its focus on what makes Catwoman work.<br /><br />Catwoman first appeared in the final story in "Batman" #1, when she was simply the Cat (a.k.a. Selina Kyle), the world's greatest cat burglar.  She was devoid of superpowers, although she certainly employs her many cat-like qualities to her advantage.  She walks the line between being good and bad, which explains why she is so attractive to Batman, since the Dark Knight's vigilantism has him walking that thin line as well.  But in this story/screenplay by Theresa Rebeck, John Brancato & Michael Ferris, and John Rogers neither Selina Kyle nor the Batman make an appearance.  For fans this becomes the obvious place to point a finger and start wagging it disparagingly.<br /><br />In this incarnation Berry plays Patience Phillips, a talented commercial artist who designs print advertisements without a shread of self-confidence at H&H, a cosmetics company run by the husband and wife team of George (Lambert Wilson) and Laurel Hedare (Sharon Stone).  Laurel has been the face of the company since its inception, but now she is being replaced by a younger face, and she is not at all happy about this changing state of affairs (you have to think this plot is hitting really close to home for Stone).  There are some rather serious problems with the cosmetics H&H is putting out, and when Patience stumbles across something she should not see in some place she should not have been, she is killed.<br /><br />When Patience is murdered she comes back to life after Midnight, a cat whose lineage goes back to the cat gods of ancient Egypt, breathes the power of Catwoman into her.  But even though there is Ophelia Powers (Frances Conroy), a character who exists to provide Patience with the necessary background information, there is no real point beyond the exposition.  Usually when someone is granted superpowers like this, from another being, there is a mission statement.  Instead, what we get is a checklist of cat powers as more of an instructor's manual.  Since Patience was murdered, Catwoman has a reason to do something about that, although it does not seem too much of a pressing concern to her.  But there was an entire history lesson shown behind the opening credits and you would think it would actually lead to something significant in the film itself.<br /><br />When this Catwoman steals some jewels, it seems just a nod to the comic book character, and not a serious bit of motivation.  Instead of a bad girl who sometimes does good things, what we have is a woman dealing with a split personality.  At this point I was reminded that the idea for a "Catwoman" movie was first floated after Michelle Pfeiffer's turn in "Batman Returns," which would explain the character's personality disorder.  But while this makes sense when Catwoman/Selina Kyle is faced with Batman/Bruce Wayne, it has no resonance with the lead character is dealing with a cop, Tom Lone (Benjamin Bratt).  He sees the world in black and white terms, while Catwoman works best as a gray character.  But in this film she is bouncing back and forth between Patience and Catwoman without any rhyme or reason that resonates with the audience.<br /><br />Catwoman's final costume, the infamous dominatrix outfit, is wrong for the character and actually extremely unflattering to Berry.  Why anybody would want to make a movie with Halle Berry and make her look bad is beyond me, but this film manages to do it.  I also think the character worked better with the long hair along with the full-body suit, which did not have to be made of leather.  Then, to cap off the string of disappointments, we have the climatic cat fight between Catwoman and Laurel, whose use of cosmetics has had an interesting side-effect that could have been taken advantage of in the big fight but was not (because that would have made sense).  Still, given that the film is devoid of thrilling stunts or memorable one liners, it is not surprising that it is a complete failure across the board.<br /><br />Of the DVD extras the best of the bunch is the retrospective on the character of Catwoman, narrated by Eartha Kitt, who does the best purr in the history of the world.  Watching the documentary it becomes clear that all of the actresses who have played Catwoman have had both a better respect for and a better understanding of the character than those who put together this film.  The irony that "Catwoman," one of the worst comic book movies of all time, came out the same summer as one of the very best, "Spider-Man 2," is not lost on those of us weaned on comic book superheroes.  Hopefully the people who are doing the next Batman movie will have figured out which of those two to hold up as a role model.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EIK4L9730WWJ.html">A2EIK4L9730WWJ</a><br/><p>When i saw this movie i thought it was great it had lots of action and it was nice to see a villian from the batman series to have her own movie!!!!!!

Not worth renting, watching at the bigscreen, watching it on HBO cable, or downloading on DVD burner. Sharon Stone has become un-attractive especially in this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3W1JJGJHRPH4Y.html">A3W1JJGJHRPH4Y</a><br/><p>I'll cover the good points first. Halle Berry did a good job considering the material she had to work with. Why she chose this role, I am not sure. Maybe she knew she would look really good in leather. Pratt was okay considering it wasn't much of a role. He was basically a boy toy (or cat toy?) Stone had a horrible role so I'm will not comment on her acting in this movie. How can you act when you are suppose to have a stone face?<br /><br />The bad points are plentiful. The plot was unbelievable. The dialogue was horrendous. The CGI was unconvincing. The characters were silly. The mythology was laughable. At least Spiderman had a good message: "With great power comes great responsibility." Catwoman's message seems to be: "Don't stand in the way of an independent woman." Morality is ambigious. Independance is key. Oprah and Martha would be proud.</p></br><a href="../users/AE9GUE3HHOX3U.html">AE9GUE3HHOX3U</a><br/><p>"Catwoman" was not nearly as bad as I thought it to be.  Considering it won the worst film of the year award from various sources, one can only expect "the worst".  The only thing that saves "Catwoman" from being a total loss is the "camp" value and the "so bad it's good" quality that made many a film famous including "Showgirls".  Halle Barry has never been an A List actress so you can't really expect much from her, but she does know how to gage her characters to a degree where it's effective but not spectacular.  Sharon Stone enters to add a strange chemistry with Miss Halle and oh NO!, that is when the movie gets really funky and oh so.... CAMPY!! (the word d'jour).  A most meomrable line from the movie that gives this film it's campy kick goes something like "It's OVER. No......It's over......TIME!!!!!!!. Yeah, you tell em girrl!

I had my misgivings about the costume, but in this city, in this storyline...well it does work. Halle is serviceable as Catwoman and Sharon Stone is just plain embarassing as a washed-up model. I loved the scene where Catwoman was cracking her whip in the middle of that techno club. Scenes like that worked because it was able to stand on its own. On the flipside, the CGI effects were awful. It was like watching an X-box game on the big screen. The CGI cat that &quot;re-awakens&quot; patience was equally terrible and I was a bit bummed that the cat did not stick its head in her mouth liek the one in Batman Returns. In all, not as bad flick...but the true Catwomen are Julie Newmar and Michelle Pfeiffer.</p></br><a href="../users/A370Z6I5GBWU44.html">A370Z6I5GBWU44</a><br/><p>I had ample warning before I saw this movie that it was going to be bad. But as they say, curiosity killed the cat.. pun intended. At least it was just my friend's DVD, because if I had paid anything to see this, I would be really angry.<br /><br />I do not know what the heck was going on in the writing room when they came up with this or some of the plot points and details. When Catwoman saw the pictures of famous historical figures in the past, I was cheesed off to see a picture of Empress Dowager Cixi with cats, this is a historical inaccuracy as the Empress was a dog person. Please do not make up things about historical figures to 'add' to your 'movie'. Some of the other scenes, like the basketball one, were truly painful to watch.<br /><br />And the outfit - Good God, what the heck was that? Who came up with it?

But in a world that has given us "Manos: the Hands of Fate", "Dungeons & Dragons" and "Starship Troopers: Hero of the Federation", that doesn't really say much.<br /><br />I watched this movie because I have a morbid curiosity about bad movies. Particularly, figuring out where they went wrong. And the consensus here is ... pretty much everywhere.<br /><br />Let's start with the story. The villain's dastardly plan revolves around marketing a facial creme that rejuvenates the skin, but, if one stops using it, has some very mean side effects. That's about it. MAKEUP! Oh no! The world will never be able to recover from that diabolical blow! Sure, the Joker (in Tim Burton's BATMAN) used personal grooming items seemingly at random to inflict mild cases of death on the unsuspecting public in his sadistic mind game to cause horror among the population of Gotham, but we're talking about a creme here that actually makes you look uglier if you stop using it! NOOOOOOO!<br /><br />Okay, snark aside, I just couldn't care about the "evil plot" except for the fact that they killed our heroine to keep their little secret.<br /><br />Which brings us to the next point. Giving Catwoman superhuman powers because she is brought back to life by some mystical Egyptian cat? Really? You're going to stick with that? That's not quite the MO for this character. Sure, she may act catty at times, but there is nothing supernatural about her. Adding this mystical element just distances the audience even further from the character. Revenge we understand. Slight insanity? Got it. Superhuman cat powers? You lost me.<br /><br />Then there's the kinetic, motion-sickness-inducing direction. Do you think you could lock that camera down for a minute or two? Please? The lighting and coloring don't help in the least. It is just way too visually busy. I understand trying for "artistic" filming, but this is ridiculous.<br /><br />In the end, the only reason I gave this more than one star is that, for those who want to see how to ruin a movie, this is something you could actually sit through and take notes. As the movie ends, you truly don't care about anyone or anything in the whole movie. So it gets one extra star for the education it gives in bad film making.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>I often cite films by Ed Wood and Uwe Boll as perfect educational films. Why? Well they're perfect examples of how not to make a film. So when films come out every year that are really terrible, you just gotta ask "is this worse than Plan 9 or Alone in the Dark? Well with Catwoman we find a film that's better than those but that's not saying much.<br /><br />Patience Phillips(why they changed it from Selina Kyle is beyond me) works as an advertisement artist for a beauty creme company. In order to make a deadline, she searches an old factory and finds out something bad about the upcoming Beau-Line(prounounced Beeyoo-Lin for some reason) and gets washed up in the river. Brought back to life by a mystical cat, which for some reason worked better under Tim Burton, she comes back as Catwoman ready to do battle against justice, and flirt with a cop.<br /><br />I haven't heard of a Rogues Gallery villain in Superman or Batman that got their own movie. You don't see Brainiac trying to save the world somewhere, or Two-Face fighting crime. So when Batman comics jewel thief becomes a crime fighter, it's kind of "huh?". And like I said, the decision to name her Patience Phillips instead of time tested Selina Kyle is forever lost to me. Imagine Superman being called Trevor Smith. Not to mention the costume looks quite ridiculous since not only does Halle Berry have an obvious skin tone but it just smacks of laziness.<br /><br />An unfortunate by-product of upstart directors is they're a little clueless on how to edit action scenes, believing the more faster the cuts, the more energetic it is. Compare this to Spielberg, Cameron or Zemeckis films that allow the action to unfold at its own pace. Here it's literally blink and you'll miss it shots. I know kids today have ADD when watching a movie but this is pushing it.<br /><br />It's right up there with Punisher and Fantastic Four as bad comic book movies but it's kind of borderline dumb entertainment and nothing more...unless you get a kick in seeing Halle Berry in her costume.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>What can you say about this flick that hasn't already been said.  The film that launched a thousand bad puns.  I tried to ignore the Razzie people's seven nominations for this film but they seem to have gotten it right.  Halle Berry should fire her agent.  The Academy is asking her for it's Oscar back.  Where to begin?  Bad direction.  Never trust a director with a one name monicker(i.e. McG of "Charlie's Angels:Full Throttle" fame).  Pitof seems to have gotten his start in making bad music videos and translated it to the big screen.  Bad script.  The writers of this drivel have never met a cat joke it couldn't resist.  My personal fave is when Halle is revived from the dead by the cats it looks like she's coughing up a hairball.  Bad acting.  Halle looks ridiculous playing the frump at the beginning and doesn't have a clue as to how to play Catwoman.  The best part of her performance is when she sports the leather catsuits.  The gymnastics are impressive but it's obvious that they were done by stuntdoubles and computer graphics.  Sharon Stone is not entering middle-age gracefully.  She comes off more shrill than villainous.  Only Benjamin Bratt as Halle's cop boyfriend escapes this fiasco with any dignity.  I would give this film one star but I don't truly hate it.  I had fun picking apart the film's faults.  Besides, with the purchase of this DVD I can get two free issues of "Suede" magazine with the option to subscribe.</p></br><a href="../users/A13TO1ZFAH9SVN.html">A13TO1ZFAH9SVN</a><br/><p>I'm a lifelong Batman fan and let me say this movie makes me mad. It's not even close to be accurate by any means to the DC comic book character. The trailers for this movie have looked horrible.<p>In the comic book Salena Kyle is a depressed secretary. She hates herself and has no confidence. She ends up striking back at the people who hurt her and calls herself Catwoman because she loves cats. She has her cat Isces and thats the only friend she has had. She has no special powers.<p>The trailers from the movie make this look like a completely different character. Halle Berry has the lead role as Catwoman. This is a miscast. She's not white and blonde. Wild Wild West has shown that you can't change a major characters race and have it work no matter how popular the actor or actress is. In the trailers I've seen and promos I've read Paitience(they couldn't even keep her real name) in the movie gets involved in a conspiracy in the cosmetic company she works for. After a freak accident she is turned into a catwoman. She has the instincts, strength, and agility of a cat. She then stars using her newfound powers to commit crime which could cost her relationship with detective Tom Lone(Benjamin Bratt).<p>The trailers remind me of Daredevil in the way that Catwoman uses her senses which is stupid. The outfits that Catwoman wear in the movie look stupid as well. (...) .<p>This movie just looks like it belongs in the litter box. It's not accurate at all and it looks bad. They are going to run it into the ground with advertising and it's going to fail. This moive really does remind me of Wild Wild West in that it's going to make some money, but in the end we are all going to wonder why we wasted our time with it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1PASRZ81DY9C.html">A1PASRZ81DY9C</a><br/><p>Viewed: 8/06<br />Rate: 2<br /><br />8/06: Catwoman is a lot better than a `1' picture, but there are too many flaws about the film. First off, the acting is somewhat decent. The story moves along, making the picture to be watchable. On the other hand, the directing effort, especially by (gee whiz...the name) Pitof is horrendous. The way the scenes were...shot...shot...shot...shot...in an extremely rapid fashion. It's too sophomoric for a director with an infantile, silly name. Moreover, Catwoman depended too much on unnecessary computer graphics work. Less is more. Repeat after me, less is more. Got it? For about an hour or so, there were way too many cheesy scenes, but Catwoman got better thereafter and ends fairly well. I see a lot of potential in Catwoman, and I wouldn't mind if there was a part two. Of course, it's nice to see a picture with very little profanity, but there were too much sexual innuendos thrown in. For example, in poor taste, was basketball sex in front of second graders! Come on, decency is needed. My suggestion to improve Catwoman is to cut out much of the computer graphics work and just let Catwoman be a normal picture. Really, Catwoman is better off that way. I think I would keep the acting and the story intact because it's not bad at all. While maintaining the profanity level at a low level, it would be nice to cut out the cheesiness and keep the sexual stuff, subtle or not, at minimum. Overall, probably, Catwoman would have been much better. Oh yeah...get rid of that lame-name director and get somebody else who knows how to direct and who also has a better name.</p></br><a href="../users/A228JH8V9Y700G.html">A228JH8V9Y700G</a><br/><p>How did this ever get made?  Oh this movie was so so bad.  While Halle Berry seems to have worked hard enough to make a name for herself, this movie set her back past Square One.  She has to reestablish herself all over again thanks to this tripe.<br /><br />Halle Berry plays a churchmouse clerk named Patience at a cosmetics company that is about to introduce a new beauty cream.  When she discovers that this new miracle product has tragic side effects, she is done away with by the top executives of the company.  She survives the attack and becomes the inner vamp, Catwoman.<br /><br />While this is certainly true to the roots of Catwoman in the comics, this movie is so terrible it's almost painful.  Halle Berry is acting like a cat (the jerky movements watching fish in an aquarium, liking sushi, etc.) and it looks ridiculous rather than insightful method acting.  The plot descintegrates as she is attempting to battle the evil corporation from releasing this product, her relationship with Bejamin Bratt goes to weirdness, and we are treated to little if anything than looking at her perfectly fit, cut body in those skin tight leathers with a whip.<br /><br />Why 2 stars rather than 1?  Sharon Stone was pretty good in this movie, despite what she had to work with she is a great actress.  Plus on the special features section, we see a history of Catwoman hosted by Eartha Kitt which is very good.  Catwoman is a great character, the inner vamp that no one, not even Batman himself can catch, but this movie was weak, campy and just plain bad.</p></br><a href="../users/A329U9CDUPKXAC.html">A329U9CDUPKXAC</a><br/><p>First of all, I went into this movie with incredibly low expectations after hearing all the dreadful reviews and Roger Ebert putting it on his list of the worst movies of 2004. So that in mind, I was able to find things I liked about Catwoman. The movie is nice to look at. Catwoman bouncing off the walls was enjoyable to watch. She was sort of like a female Spider-Man. The colors and the sets were all done very well. So that's where my praise for this movie stops. I was really amazed at how bad these actors could act. The actors didn't believe the lines they were speaking and it showed. It had to be some of the worst acting I've ever seen. The story is incredibly stupid. Beauty cream that turns people's skin to stone??? And why would the villain want to sell this much less USE it??? Did she know she'd be battling Catwoman one day? Or does she just want to feel like a brick? It's best not to think about these things. Turn your brain off and watch the movie. It might be able to hold your interest till the end.</p></br><a href="../users/A27FR2C67JPDRS.html">A27FR2C67JPDRS</a><br/><p>I hope that Halle Berry and Crew make a sequel to "Catwoman" and improve on this first movie.  My first complaint about this film is that it is not Selena Kyle and the Catwoman of the Batman comic series.  I would loved to have seen them base it on this character and had Catwoman in Gotham City.  My second complaint is that Sharon Stone makes a GREAT villian and I just don't think she was given enough to do as supermodel femme fatal.  Francis Conroy's character wasn't really explained and Benjamin Bratt's character wasn't all that interesting.  That said, I liked Berry as Catwoman.  I though she was very sexy and given the chance, could improve in the role (thought I still like her as Storm of the X-Men better).  Pitof's use of camera angles and the way Catwoman really moved like a cat was really cool and one of the best things about the film.  With the origin of our feline heroine out of the way, the sequel (should they make one) should be more focused on action and a good story.  And, if they are gonna get someone like Sharon Stone as the villain, make sure and use her to her potential and not let a really fun actress go to waste.<br /><br />Berry fans will want this as a part of their collection but I'm not sure I'd recommend it to everyone.  Hard core comic fans will be disappointed.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GKPMHV4U64IY.html">A3GKPMHV4U64IY</a><br/><p>This time we have a slightly different Catwoman than comic book readers are familiar with.  This time, Catwoman is merely the current incarnation of a long-running historical character that goes bach through the ages.  Patience (Catwoman) gets her start when she dies.  Mystic cats resurrect her and give her her new abilities.  Patience/Catwoman then has to balance between her two personalities as she tries to find her life's path.<br /><br />This is a very feminine movie.  Our hero represents a female warrior archetype.  She must face and foil the world of men (the police and authority).  Her foe is the maker of beauty cream.  But the new beauty cream could be dangerous to all women who would use it.  All in all most of the characters and imagery are feminine in nature.  This should appeal to female audiences while the skimpy costume should keep the testosterone wielders interested as well.<br /><br />The disk comes with an interesting documentary about the many faces of Catwoman with interviews with the various women who have taken on the role as well as others involved in the television/film versions.  All in all a pretty good disk.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VLX5Z090RQ0V.html">A3VLX5Z090RQ0V</a><br/><p>"Catwoman" is so repulsive, it made anime catgirls who watched it hack up feces and throw the content at a hero's face, and then have him scratched into pieces.  It's a amalgamation of Warner Bros' heinously-produced superhero movies of the past, thinly-disguised as an empowering chick flick.  Not to mention the public attention of having one of the worst superhero costumes ever, but to be fair, despite looking like a dominatrix mouse with clothes taken from a thrift store, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1563899086">at least she didn't wear those ugly goggles</a>.  It's kind sad that such attention goes for such a wear, because she actually work a decent 'prototype' costume before her official wardrobe disaster: it was a tight leather pants (unshredded) and a long-sleeve jacket followed by black mask; she looked presentable, and she didn't seem less agile wearing more clothes than she does wearing less.  If she just cover her head with a bandana (and wearing cat ears), that would've been the right costume for her, but no, she wanted to look like a laughingstock to even perverts.<br /><br />It's about a not-Selena Kyle named Patience (Berry), a weedy design for ads in a big make-up business owned by a rich jerk and her wife, the latter played by a not-looking-good-in-her-older-years Sharon Stone.  When Patience was about to fall from her apartment after saving a mysterious cat, she was rescued by detective named Rico Suave---that's not his actual name, but Benjamin Bratt played a character who did nothing but coming on to the lead actress, so that name is appropriate.  Later, Patience went into a make-up facility when she overheard that her company's new product is tainted and dangerous for anyone who tried it; she was killed as a result.  And then came the stupidest plot-device happened: the same mysterious cat walk on her corpse, YAWNED AT HER FACE, and not only did it revived her, it gave her acute senses and extreme agility.  But such dexterity comes as a price when she has to carry all of the quirks of a cat; walking on thin ledges on her own two feet, having an obsessive craving for fish, having dogs bark at her, and having a fear of rain.  Oh, and she can teleport from one place to another, though that sounds more like a magician that a cat's ability.<br /><br />I wish I didn't make this sound stupid, but it really is.  What's next, does she bath herself with her tongue and does she breed 3 litters after 3 months?  Not even a few comics I read and some cartoons I've seen painted "Catwoman" in such a literal manner.  The stupidity didn't help but how warped the film is directed.  It seems like Pitof, the film's director, has see the first "Spider-Man" and wanted to imitate its free-flowing camera angles.  Except he wanted to use more of that style, whether it be backgrounds shots, interiors, character POVs, third-person perspective, wherever it can move around. This approach to filming is so tacky and distracting, it actually makes the film look fake (especially during Catwoman jumping across buildings); half the time I thought I was watching a 3D-animated movie, except this is live-action.  Editing is another seque to nitpick.  Some of the scene edits are weird, like that one scene where the guy was taking, and the scene keeps cutting to the same character in the same position (i.e. opening scene for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6302261589">"Cool As Ice"</a>).  Sometimes, the film even has a few goofs, like when a burglar tried to break a glass class with his gun, but the glass case was smashed before his gun even made impact; it's a notable goof, and it's been done twice!<br /><br />Halle Berry tried to do something with her character, but she was totally boned.  She made horrible puns, her assertive attitude is laughable, and she did nothing to make Catwoman act sexual as well as appear sexual; she can be even too enamored with herself, like when her superego is dancing around on the center of a club stage and is lashing her whip around.  The story was stupid, the acting was weak, and fights are meandering.  "Catwoman" failed to be a provocative movie as well as being popcorn entertainment.</p></br><a href="../users/A11XKY4EIU2KNR.html">A11XKY4EIU2KNR</a><br/><p>Everyone hated Batman II even though it had Michelle Pheifer running around in black leather. So what do the genious minds from Hollywood present us with almost 15 years later? A Cat Woman movie. How unoriginal.<br /><br />Well in the 90's Hollywood's gas tank was on empty, we had a decade of movies made from long dead TV shows (Beverly Hillbillies, Brady Bunch, etc.) We still have it today with Charlie's Angels and Starsky and Hutch. To mix it up a bit, the suits are now presenting us with an endless supply of Marvel Comic Superheros. Spider-Man, good. Hulk, bad. Cat Woman? Bottom of the barrel.<br /><br />The title of this movie could have been "Watch Halle Berry run around in a cat-suit, you know you want to". That's really about it. I'm not a Halle Berry fan. I don't think she's all that. Maybe she would look better if she wore her hair like a woman.<br /><br />Anyway, I'm rambling. If you are a Halle Fan you will see this no matter what anyone says. If you are a leather fetishest, you will to. So why does anyone bother to review this?</p></br><a href="../users/AR37967IAR6ZT.html">AR37967IAR6ZT</a><br/><p>Oh my God, this movie was terrible. Of course, I expected it to be a fun sort of terrible, which it was. But, nonetheless, this was a catastrophe. Or make that a &quot;cat-tastrophe.&quot;<br /><br /> Don't blame Halle Berry for this, even though she starts out the movie tellingly &quot;dead in the water.&quot; She proved in &quot;Monster's Ball&quot; that she can act. And she looks great in this movie. But I didn't buy her for one second as Catwoman. And I didn't buy her boring romance with Benjamin Bratt either. It just wasn't sexy.<br /><br /> Blame Pitof, who was likely responsible for the non-stop camera movement, the constant editing, the computer-animated cat who mounts Halle to revive her from the dead and the overall emphasis of style over substance. I swear, this movie gets so out-of-control with its editing at times that I fear for any epileptics going to the theater. &quot;Catwoman&quot; will cause seizures.<br /><br /> Poor Sharon Stone doesn't even deserve this. Though she fares well in the final fight scene, not that you can ever tell anything that happens in any of the fight scenes, she's given ridiculously over-the-top scenes to play out using every histrionic possible. Her costuming is ugly. She's freakishly overlit in every scene in the movie. And the plot twist involving makeup that somehow makes her invincible is just plain stupid.<br /><br /> This whole mess is far from &quot;purr-fect.&quot; So far from perfect, in fact, that I laughed out loud when the thing ended.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>Superheroes have always been the object of a systematic cult in the USA. So sooner or later a woman had to come into the picture and since Supergirl never satisfied anyone, they had to look for someone else, someone a little bit more attractive. And since Spiderman had many long legs and arms blocking the way they had to look somewhere else farther out of the way. They looked in Egypt, they looked in China, they looked in the Middle Ages for an animal connected to women and who was both satanic and in relation with freedom, liberty and freewheeling. That's how the cat came out of the wizard's hat or bonnet. Catwoman was thus saved from the water of the river, which is absolutely accurate, and brought back to life in the human world of the night. She became the queen of the roofs. Then add a dishonest but successful industrialist exploiting women with beauty products that you must definitely not stop if you don't want to develop some strange Karposi syndrome or cancer. Then add his wife, an old belle who has aged faster than necessary and who wants to get rid of her husband and put her hands on the golden goose and the bank reserves before he finally realizes he does not need her anymore. And then you have the perfect thriller. A little bit of romance between the cop who is supposed to arrest Catwoman and the woman she is supposed to be and you have a heartbreaking story. But the poor Catwoman cannot stay because she is nothing but a living dead. So sadness takes over and she can only exist at night and on the roofs of the city. And there you have some kind of a myth of the cat seen as a symbol of ... what have I said already? But what's the meaning of this fable? Nothing is crystal clear in this tale, or if it is clear it is just as clear as black pudding juice at the bottom of a completely opaque wooden bottle. Only a cat can see anything in there. God bless the child.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>This film version based on one of Batman's most revered supporting characters bears little resemblance to the slinky, smart, and sophisticated character that comic fans have read for years, and that's not even half of it.  Even when Catwoman was in pre-production, it was a forgone conclusion that this would be an absolute bomb.  Directed by french director Pitof, the film has no real visual flair besides the very sexy Halle Berry strutting around with hardly any clothes on, and there are quite a number of plain old bad CGI shots.  Sharon Stone gives her most wooden performance in her career, and other cast members Benjamin Bratt and Frances Conroy are wasted.  Not to mention, this movie has no original idea anywhere in it.  The tagline of the film trailers proclaimed, "a cat can bring a soul back to the world of the living to make the wrong things right".  Gee, anyone else remember the Crow?  If you're a fan of Berry, this is worth watching to see her gorgeous body in action, but if you are going to watch this strictly for that, your best bet is to fast forward through the rest of the film.  Other than that, this isn't even worth seeing, and is undoubtadly one of the worst comic to film adaptations of all time.</p></br><a href="../users/A1N8K1X0OLLADY.html">A1N8K1X0OLLADY</a><br/><p>The only reason to see this movie is to see Hallie in a sexy outfit. As for the movie itself, I'm sure that it will be similar to Underworld....ANOTHER TERRIBLE MOVIE.<p>Do you know the television series "Lost World".

She too also shows a lot of cleavage (Yummy).</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ.html">A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ</a><br/><p>In the wild world of cinema, we're living in an age of comic heroes -- Spiderman, Hellboy, Daredevil, the Hulk, the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen and now... &quot;Catwoman.&quot;?Sadly, this film is just an excuse to have Halle Berry purr around in a leather dominatrix outfit.<br /><br /> Patience Phillips (Halle Berry) is a mild-mannered, rather dull woman in an ordinary job at a massive cosmetics firm. But one day she has the misfortune to hear her bosses talking about a new beauty product -- it causes the skin to disintegrate if you stop using it, but they don't plan to recall it. But when Patience is caught, they kill her and flush away her body in a wash of toxic waste. Enter Egyptian deity cat, who resurrects her and endows her with catty powers and a new punky attitude.<br /><br /> Like any superhero worth her scanty leather catsuit (no pun), the reborn Catwoman wants to kick the behinds of the people who did this to her. But her ex-boss Laurel Hedare (past-her-prime ex-bombshell Sharon Stone) has a secret of her own -- cosmetic cream that makes her skin hard (Botox, anyone?). Can Catwoman thwart the evildoers? Will anyone care?<br /><br /> It's difficult to understand why the talented, beautiful, Oscar-winning Halle Berry would attach herself to this ghastly, almost unredeemable story. There is literally nothing worth checking out in &quot;Catwoman,&quot; unless you happen to be a hormone-raddled teen boy whose only plot requirement involves Berry in kitty dominatrix gear. (Complete with whip!)<br /><br /> The dialogue is truly horrendous. Berry is reduced to reciting lame one-liners like &quot;I'm bad, but only as bad as I wanna be.&quot; Director Pitof relies heavily on T&A shots of Berry bouncing around and slinking seductively over rooftops, not to mention the bad CGI shots. Perhaps worst of all, Pitof overuses the silly &quot;cat&quot; element -- we're treated to shots of Berry sleeping on the roof, licking up tuna, snorting catnip. It's funny, but not meant to be.<br /><br /> Berry really does seem to be trying. But she can't hope to overcome the script and direction, It's all the more tragic because she has the presence and smoldering quality to make the role sexy and complex. Benjamin Bratt is utterly forgettable as Catwoman's cop boyfriend. And Sharon Stone's big comeback just reaffirms the obvious: She can't act. She struts through every scene reciting her lines in a robotic voice (&quot;Now I can... kill you.&quot;)<br /><br /> &quot;Catwoman&quot; is a cat-astrophe. With ghastly acting -- despite the best efforts of Berry -- a putrid script and a ridiculous director, this is undoubtedly among the worst films of 2004.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BT7IC8PT1ZC9.html">A2BT7IC8PT1ZC9</a><br/><p>This movie had some of the worst special effects I've ever seen!  They were so bad, they were actually amusing.  I found the acting to be terrible too.  One last thought, wasn't the original Catwoman white? Avoid this one.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ.html">A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ</a><br/><p>You know the old saying, "Do not change horses mid-race", well I think that heavily applies to this film.  I think the biggest hurdle that most of us had to overcome in this film was that Catwoman was not Michelle Pfeiffer.  Most of us are still a generation of Batman Returns fans, as well as Tim Burton's darkness, and Halle just couldn't fit those shoes.  Pfeiffer gave us this unbridled performance as this tormented woman who is given a rebirth by some cats, while Berry continually felt as if she was just going through the motions in order to try to be cooler than Pfeiffer was.  You could see the competition going on in the film, and it hurt the overall story and characters.  I will agree, this film had a very weak plot, but with the right person behind the mask of Catwoman, this could have been a decent film.  Sadly, Berry just didn't put the force into it that I felt Pfeiffer did.  There wasn't enough passion in the eyes, just this uncanny ability to act like a cat.  Catwoman was more than "just a cat", she was this troubled soul that had to deal with both the good side of her actions as well as the devilish.  That is what never came through with Berry.<br /><br />Outside of the complete miscast of Halle Berry, there were a couple other points that I just felt cheated after watching the film.  The scene where the cat breaths on Halle was too eerily like Ralph Wiggum's "My cat's breath smells like cat food" moment.  I kept waiting to hear that whenever possible.  It would have granted this film one additional star more.  Sadly, we had to live with what was in this film, and not what wasn't.  What was in this film was shoddy acting, a very flimsy script, and scenario after scenario that just didn't seem to work.  I realize the Pitof (the director) was trying to show a very feminine film that could be seen as a feminist picture, but to me it just didn't work.  All of the sudden this cat brings out what Patience couldn't in the past?  Suddenly, with the quick breath of a cat, she could play basketball better than ever, crack a whip, and drive a motorcycle.  There was no development here, just plain assumption.  I needed more development of this character instead of just this light-speed characterization that lead nowhere.<br /><br />Another element that didn't brood well with me were the villains.  Who were they?  What was their purpose behind their situations?  Without giving us any of this information, we can only assume that they really weren't evil and that perhaps Catwoman was caught up in this big misunderstanding?  I know that is far fetched, but honestly Sharon Stone and Lambert Wilson were not that sinister.  Sure, every company that you work for has that boss that is not going to treat you with the greatest of respect, but does that make him the super-villain?  Then you have Sharon Stone with this pathetic super power that works and doesn't work half the time.  I just didn't care at this point what Catwoman was to do to stop the corporation.  It was this huge dilemma that I could have solved quickly by perhaps incorporating something about the Umbrella Corporation and a tie into Resident Evil 3.  Anything could have been better than what Pitof presented here.<br /><br />The themes were also as jumbled as a child's playroom.  Scattered throughout this picture you had different themes that never quite tied into the big solution.  There were the feminist issues, the skin care/growing old is "ok" theme, the dual personalities and to live life to the fullest moments, and then there was the pro-self sidesteps that just never took us anywhere.  It was like bobbing for themes in this mess.  Nearly every five minutes, Pitof would present to us either a new theme or an older one that should have been dropped, but instead found itself back in the picture.  It became increasingly clear with these scattered themes why Berry couldn't quite capture her character.  There were supposed to be several layers to her character, but instead with all the layers everywhere except on Berry, it became increasingly more difficult to uncover.  This caused both problems for the film itself as well as for the audience forced to sit through this mess.  I mean who wants to visit a place of rest and have to clean up before being able to enjoy it.  Not me, and that is how I felt with this film.  I felt that it was this huge mess that Pitof created and wanted me to clean up.  It was pathetic.<br /><br />Overall, I was not happy with this film.  Either Pfeiffer should have been in it or it should have been shelved.  With the growing business behind superheroes in today's cinema, Hollywood studios will have to pick and choose which ones they think will be big.  You cannot release them all, and it proves with the attempt to capitalize on this small hero that ultimately failed.  I hate to go with the rest of the critics with this one, but I just did not enjoy the final result.  The costume, the style, the themes, and the acting all put a hinder on this film that was unrepairable from the beginning.  This is a perfect example of a film that should have been scrapped from the beginning instead of rushed to theaters.  Procrastination does not pay off in the long run!<br /><br />Grade: * out of *****</p></br><a href="../users/A33CLVW2K7SL1P.html">A33CLVW2K7SL1P</a><br/><p>There was absolutely *nothing* believable or credible about this film. At times, Berry as Catwoman was dark - even when fighting her love interest, Benjamin Bratt. Why in the world would she be trying to hurt him? I understand that he was trying to arrest her, but there were better ways for her to escape than by knocking him around. I'm sorry, but donning that mask doesn't change her personality, any more than when Batman puts his mask on his personality changes. Bruce Wayne IS Batman, in suit or out.<br /><br />Given the films we've seen lately (for example, Spider-Man, 1 or 2), the special effects were heinous. When Catwoman was bounding from wall to wall it you could see the generated effects, and you're not supposed to. Again, especially not today. When Sharon stone fell, at one point in her fall you could actually see that it wasn't a person - it looked like Raggedy Ann dressed in white.<br /><br />To have a successful movie that involves a comic book hero, you need a good villain, a good plot, and something to care about. This had none of the aforementioned. The villain was a company and it's male C.E.O. trying to market a product that could potentially scar women for life (and what a ridiculous product name that was - Beau-line). Then the villain became his wife. A plot twist? I suppose so, but an entirely ridiculous one. Sharon Stone's character claimed that she had been using Beau-line for years. How is that possible? They're only just now getting ready to release the product. A product goes through years of research and testing, with trial and error, until the formula comes out right. So she's been using it during the research and testing period? Not likely.<br /><br />The plot - who cared? Did anyone really care about Beau-line? Of course not! I *cared* about the Green Goblin and Doc Ock. I cared about the Joker in the first Batman movie, and definitely about Catwoman in the second (Michelle Pfeiffer, for what it matters, completely outperformed Berry in the role). There was some serious tension between these superheroes and their villains. But how could tension be created through the wiles of a corporation?<br /><br />Also, how did the mild mannered little girl who was frightened of everything, it seems (but who walked out on a ledge to save a cat - um, duh?) manage to have that revolting leather costume in her closet? Seriously, that was deplorable.<br /><br />What's very interesting about certain statistics regarding this film is that on pro.imdb.com (the professional version of the Internet Movie DataBase), those who liked the movie most, in each age category, were women. I was surprised, as I thought adolescent boys would be much more interested. Perhaps not enough adolescent boys subscribe to pro.imdb.com.<br /><br />Also, this movie won 4 Razzie awards: worst actress, worst director, worst picture, and worst screenplay. It was also nominated for three others.<br /><br />The only reason I rented this was to see how truly bad it was. I think that it may have been worse than I expected it to be.</p></br></body></html>

I also appreciated the spirited performances of both Ben Affleck and Samuel Jackson.  Ben Affleck managed to shed some tears, hoping for that Oscar nomination.  Ok now the bad news.... There were a couple of parts in the film that were so unrealistic.  Like the part when Ben Affleck is being sh**-canned by his father in law, afterwards he turns on the fire alarm and all the water begins to spray the office!?!  Please give me a break, no one would do that in real life. He would have left that office, got in his car and cried the whole way home. The most far fetched thing about this movie is these two men would have ended up killing each other for the things they did.  They would not have become friends at the end and try to help each other out. The ending of the movie is what ruined it for me, it was phony and hollywoodish....</p></br><a href="../users/A327YZ9EDPHDOQ.html">A327YZ9EDPHDOQ</a><br/><p>Depending on whether or not you like Ben Affleck and Samuel Jackson, this movie unfolded into the relationships of two men angry at one another and the frustration that followed them throughout the movie. I thought it was a good movie myself with good performances all about.</p></br><a href="../users/A461VTLW9G9YB.html">A461VTLW9G9YB</a><br/><p>I actually enjoyed this movie even though I think Ben Affleck is a really really bad actor</p></br><a href="../users/A1EI65WJC85U68.html">A1EI65WJC85U68</a><br/><p>Gavin Banek (Ben Affleck) is a young lawyer who works for a powerful firm and is married to his boss's daughter (Amanda Peet, Banek's boss/father-in-law is played by director Sydney Pollack).<br />Doyle Gipson (Samuel L. Jackson) is an average working class Joe and recovering alcoholic. Both men obviously have nothing in common, but their paths cross when their cars collide on the freeway. Late for work, the self-absorbed yuppie Banek offers Gipson a blank check and hastily abandons the scene of the accident. However, Gipson has stolen one of Banek's legal files containing info which is pertinent to a case he is trying. Luckily for him, the judge gives Banek till day's end to recover the file. Sounds simple? No way, Jose. Because the collision has also had an undesirable effect on Gipson's day as well; as his lateness has cost him a custody battle for his sons. What is the obvious solution to the problem? Good ol' reliable blackmail, of course.<br />Later Banek and Gipson's paths cross again and Banek once more attempts to make amends or the accident, but Gipson is a man with a chip on his shoulder the size of Al Gore's ego and he's not about to make life easy for Banek; who just happens to be married to the boss's daughter.<br />CHANGING LANES is a movie which is never boring, and is helped a lot by Jackson's usual strong performance. Ben Affleck on the other hand, is Ben Affleck. It's amazing how with all the money he's made Ben doesn't seem to possess the initiative to take acting lessons; and it's also a shame that Toni Collette isn't given much to do in her role here as Affleck's secretary. That's my only complaint. CHANGING LANES is one of those pictures which is becoming a rare commodity in Hollywood these days: a film with intelligence and integrity (plus the requisite car chase sequence). Well worth a look.</p></br><a href="../users/A2198FZZMTJ38H.html">A2198FZZMTJ38H</a><br/><p>"Changing Lanes" is everything that its trailer is not, and that's a good thing. Movie previews for this refreshingly different thriller tout it as a fast-paced revenge machine, but in actuality, it moves at a much slower speed, developing its story and characters in a manner that brings us into their lives rather than placing us on the sidelines. The ending is a bit meak, but the suspense is non-stop, the acting superb, and the overall effect a satisfying one. <p>The beginning keeps details at bay, introducing fragments of the puzzle that will later come together. Ben Affleck plays Gavin Banek, a successful young attorney who has been sent by his firm to deliver important files concerning A) a charitable institution, and B) a very disgruntled granddaughter of its now-deceased founder. On the opposite end of the spectrum, we meet Samuel L. Jackson's middle-class father, Doyle Gibson, who is in the process of taking out a loan for a home in the hopes that his ex-wife will accept the action as a peace offering instead of taking their two children to Oregon. <p>The two men are both on their way to the courthouse. They have an accident after Banek attempts to change lanes, causing Gibson to careen into a freeway divider. Gibson wants to exchange insurance information ("I wanna do things the right way"); Banek, in a frenzied rush, gives him a blank check and speeds off, unaware that in his search for his checkbook, an important file landed on the street. Gibson retrieves the file, thumbs a ride to the courthouse, too late to make his statement in the custody case; Banek, who discovers his file is missing, is given an end-of-the-day deadline to come up with the document. <p>This all occurs within the first twenty minutes of the film, but not to worry: there's more to it than what we've seen, or what we think will happen. Much of what goes on centers around the important document, that which delegates the power to make decisions for the institution to the law firm. Banek lies to his two partners, telling them the case was ruled in their favor to tide them over while he attempts to get the file back from Gibson. <p>This is where the good gets even better, as the two men engage in a battle of wills and wits. It's like a game, really, an ongoing silent war in which a double-cross is payed back within the hour. Banek enlists the help of a hacker known for his ability to "help out with things that need helping out." He infiltrates Gibson's bank accounts, bankrupting him of his precious loan ("I need this loan for my life," Gibson later pleads with the teller), setting in motion a chain reaction of events that lead to an uncertain destination. <p>I must say, the film packs a real whallop in its first and second acts. The somewhat slow pacing is in its favor, allowing us to understand the characters while at the same time putting real effort into the explanations of various plot twists and new developments. There is an underlying web of deception underneath the action that centers around the document, the law firm, and the institution, that which I will not reveal. This subplot turns out to be the basis for the thrills, and it is smart and cooly calculated without insulting one's intelligence. <p>Also backing the film is its terrific cast, featuring two leads who play off one other so well, they could carry the movie by themselves. Jackson is a man of many virtues, and he displays a versatility here that is mesmerizing and intense. We feel for this man as a father, and as a person, and can come to understand his reasoning. Affleck has found a role befitting of his acting ability; there is a diversity of emotions to Banek's character, much of which revolves around being held at the whim of a man he hardly knows, and Affleck portrays this exquisitely. <p>The film worked for me right up until the ending, a well-intentioned morality lesson that doesn't quite live up to the goals the material sets for itself. But to think about it further is to realize that there is really no other way for "Changing Lanes" to end without descending into the ludicrousness that plagues most thrillers; the ending we are supplied with is safe while not being totally satisfactory. Up until this point, there are thrills, surprises, and acting gusto aplenty, making the experience an enjoyable and involving one.</p></br><a href="../users/AL277B4AQCWBG.html">AL277B4AQCWBG</a><br/><p>After a mid-morning scrape on the FDR, two men from radically different backgrounds become locked in a high-stakes game of revenge. That premise is enough for a decent movie, but its power is doubled here by an intelligent moral subtext. What could have been just another urban action film becomes not only an exciting thriller, but a finely nuanced commentary on contemporary values: in a corrupt world, doing the right thing can be more revolutionary, more "edgy", than doing the wrong. Affleck is wonderful as Gavin Banek, the morally-conflicted Wall Street attorney desperately trying to recover a lost file; and Jackson, as Doyle Gipson, sets aside his trademark coolness to convincingly portray an estranged, alcoholic father struggling to salvage what's left of his life. The tone is elevated enormously by some inspired casting in the supporting roles: William Hurt as Doyle's AA sponsor; Sidney Pollack as Gavin's venal father-in-law and boss; Dylan Baker as an online Mr Fix-It; Toni Collette as Gavin's co-worker; and Amanda Peet as his pragmatically devoted wife. Roger Michell's direction is never self-consciously showy, yet perfectly captures the feeling of a frantic struggle through the oppressive streets of a rainy New York day. There are some speechy moments when the morality theme is hammered home a little too hard, but for the most part writers Chap Taylor and Michael Tolkin manage to show it rather than say it, and at 99 minutes they know precisely when to cut it off. It isn't perfect - there are some odd jumps, sloppy writing (why is the stock market open on Good Friday?), and a heavy-handed bar scene that could've been cut.  Still, that this film could so easily have settled for being a cat-and-mouse story of visually spectacular revenge makes it all the more thrilling that it isn't. The artistry and intelligence of its creators and performers ensure that "Changing Lanes" is not only entertaining, but intellectually engaging on an entirely different level.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>Any thoughts that &quot;Changing Lanes&quot; would be a predictable film should have gone out the window as soon as you saw Samuel L. Jackson was involved.  The story is about two men who do not have time for a freeway fender bender.  Gavin Banek (Ben Affleck) is a lawyer who has some important papers to file to prove an ailing millionaire signed over control of his foundation to Banek's law firm.  Doyle Gipson (Jackson), also has to get to court so he can show he got approved for a loan to buy a house so that his wife will not move with his two sons to Oregon.  The accident itself is really nobody's fault, but everything that happens after words in this escalating war of words and deeds can be laid at the feet of Gavin and Doyle, who dive off into the deep end.<p>The movie ads proclaimed &quot;One wrong turn deserves another,&quot; and it helps set the audience up for the carnage these two reap on each other's lives as their frustrations give way to anger.  They have good reason to be frustrated: Doyle gets to court too late and his last chance to keep his family together is gone; Gavin arrives at court only to discover he has left the most important document behind.  It turns out that this document is so important that not having it can put him and the bosses at his firm, including his father-in-law, in prison.  These are two men whose lives have come to major crossroads.  This is news to Gavin, but the impact is not less than it is on Doyle.<p>The trailer for &quot;Changing Lanes&quot; emphasizes the horrible things these two men manage to do to each other during the course of what is clearly the worst days of their lives.  Gavin uses a computer wizard to destroy Doyle's credit rating.  Doyle loosen the bolts on the wheel of Gavin's car.  If somebody does not end up dead by the end of this film, then we are all going to be very much surprised.  But that is what makes this film worth watching is that it is surprising, as when Gavin and Doyle both discover the true value of the lives they have been trying to lead are found in the women they have married (Amanda Peet and Kim Stauton respectively).  <p>Ultimately, it is the ability of the script by Chap Taylor and Michael Tolkin to surprises us and lifts &quot;Changing Lanes&quot; above the standard Hollywood tale of urban violence.  These two men could be cartoonish figures, but they become fully developed characters; not because of what they do to each other, but because of what they articulate about their lives in talking to others.  Gavin confesses to his former mistress (Toni Collette) while Doyle bare his soul to his AA sponsor (William Hurt).  In their initial conversation after the accident Gavin and Doyle are too worried about where they should be to have a civil conversation.  Their next words are insults that they shout (and fax).  But the film holds the promise that once these two men hit rock bottom that they might final turn on one another and talk.</p></br><a href="../users/AHABFECTNE15I.html">AHABFECTNE15I</a><br/><p>Version: U.S.A / Paramount / Region Free<br />Aspect ratio: 2.40:1<br />MPEG-4 AVC BD-50 / AACS<br />Running time: 1:38:44<br />Movie size: 30,29 GB<br />Disc size: 34,15 GB<br />Total bit rate: 40.91 Mbps<br />Average video bit rate: 31.95 Mbps<br /><br />Dolby TrueHD Audio  English  3585 kbps  5.1 / 48 kHz / 3585 kbps / 24-bit (AC3 Core: 5.1 / 48 kHz / 640 kbps)<br />Dolby Digital Audio  French  640 kbps  5.1 / 48 kHz / 640 kbps<br />Dolby Digital Audio  Spanish  640 kbps  5.1 / 48 kHz / 640 kbps<br />Dolby Digital Audio  English  224 kbps  2.0 / 48 kHz / 224 kbps / Dolby Surround<br /><br />Subtitles: English SDH, English, French, Portuguese, Spanish<br />Number of chapters: 15<br /><br />#Audio Commentary by Director<br />#The Making of Changing Lanes (SD - 15m)<br />#A Writer's Perspective (SD - 6m:30s)<br />#1 Extended Scene (SD - 4m:37s)<br />#2 Deleted Scenes (SD - 4m:55s)<br />#Theatrical Trailer (HD)</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>This film is much better than the average thriller and it will hold your interest to the end.

For me this movie however, fell a bit flat - I kept expecting something much more than I saw, and the ending seemed as if the Director had run out of ideas, and had to go with the "off the shelf" crowd pleaser finale. I wouldn't say that this movie was a waste of talent, or particularly bad. It's just true that a book cannot be judged by it's cover, anymore than a movie can be judged by it's cast.

Though a little preachy at times and a bit too pat [especially at the end], it manages to bypass many of the cliches we have become accustomed to in such films. It casts an unflinching eye on its characters and their place in a world which sometimes seems to have lost its moral compass. Directed at a brisk pace by Roger Michell ["Notting Hill"] and beautifully photographed by Salvatore Totino, "Changes Lanes" is a thinking man's thriller. [The testosterone and adrenaline crowd should probably pass on this one because nothing is blown up and nobody dies.]<p>On a cold New York morning, we find two men racing to court. Doyle [Samuel L. Jackson] is going to Family Court to try to prevent his wife from moving to Oregon with their two boys. Gavin [Ben Affleck] is a lawyer who's on his way to Probate Court to seal a deal that's of great benefit to his high-powered law firm. Along the way they are involved in a fender bender. Gavin is polite at first but becomes increasingly agitated when Doyle wants to take his time `doing the right thing'. He winds up leaving Doyle stranded. Consequently, Doyle is late to court and loses his case. Gavin, meanwhile, arrives at his destination only to find he has accidentally left an important document in Doyle's possession. Without it, he can not win his case. What ensues is an increasingly nasty game of "Gotcha" between two very angry men, neither of whom is entirely right or wrong. <p>Few mainstream movies ask us to examine current moral values or to question the ways in which we deal with each other. Fewer still question the value of righteous anger. "Changing Lanes" doesn't hesitate to address these issues head on. It does so in a way that is both entertaining and enlightening.</p></br><a href="../users/A15MLF38WROSWU.html">A15MLF38WROSWU</a><br/><p>20 minutes of lost time causes Doyle Gibson to lose a custody battle with his exwife.  The lost time was caused by Banek cutting off Gibson on the FDR (I'm a former NY'er and I've had this happen to me!!!)  Doyle wants to do the right thing and exchange information, while Banek just wants to give him a blank check and be gone.  Banek is in such a rush he does not realize that he lost a file for the court case he is on his way to.  To get back at Banek Doyle holds the important file hostage!!!  This starts a series of events that just sets of a domino effect of I'm going to do you worse!!! Closing accounts, threatening phone calls, and possibly worse!!<p>The movie is about morals, and doing the right thing.  The movie was not great, but it held my interest.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M5O6UHXO9IBU.html">A3M5O6UHXO9IBU</a><br/><p>Which is a very American obsession rather like political correctness. As in the white guy has to be a corrupt, privileged lawyer while the black guy is an honest Joe driven to alcoholism by the prejudice of the white man whose keeping him down (see Tiger Woods speech in bar followed by beating. Hey, they had it coming.) The white guy needs enlightening, but he's white, so whose he gonna call? He needs a fortune cookie, but fast. Preferably from a black man whose also an attempted murderer who doesn't care how many other road users he might potentially kill while the lawyer's car is spinning out of control. That sort of fortune cookie. The film delivers quite a few. Such as a black wife is honest and forgiving while a white wife is dishonest and forgiving. Now, I could be wrong, but people who set out to help death row prisoners for little pay are usually ideologically committed from day one rather than having experienced a road to Damascus like conversion on the way to the fish and chip shop. But I could be wrong. I'm white, after all.<p>File under wet file. Which, of course, they wouldn't have noticed after he set off the sprinklers. Probably because the whole office suddenly became miraculously dry and habitable afterwards as if nothing had happened.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>I bought this mainly for Ben Affleck (big fan so shut up), and while he was OK, Samuel L Jackson bettered (that's bEttered, not battered) him in the better star/character stakes. I found Samuel's character and whole storyline a lot better, and more endearing to the audience.<br /><br /> This movie has been described as a 'thriller'. I'm sorry to say I have to disagree. I certainly wasn't on the edge of my seat at anytime, and found my eyes wandering to the clock a lot. It simply drags. And there are no fancy effects to talk of. So if you're looking for fancy action, or scantily clad girls - you're gonna be watching the wrong movie.<br /><br /> Sometimes, the film seems slightly rushed, even though other parts are extremely slow - the finale for example, it just seemed too convenient, that everything worked out OK (or not?), and you're left wondering where on earth Hollywood got the idea for this movie. At times, it seems like you're back in school, with two little boys in the playground accusing each other of starting it first.<br /><br /> The thing that does get me sometimes, is the fact that Samuel L Jackson seems to play the exact same role, and you can recognise the role he has played many times before. Maybe that's just me.<br /><br /> The trailer doesn't do anything for the film, the trailer seems to say it's more fast paced than it actually is. The rest of the extras are your average lot really, no bright ideas when it came to these: commentary, making-of, deleted and extended scenes, alternate endings, and &quot;A Writer's Perspective&quot; featurette.<br /><br /> You may find this movie disappointing, if you're watching it purely for Ben Affleck. Don't expect a fast paced film whatever you do. If you want a fast paced THRILLER, go for Phone Booth.</p></br><a href="../users/A35XMSURGM0L1N.html">A35XMSURGM0L1N</a><br/><p>Changing Lanes is most of all a story about good and bad and how far people will go to improve their own life over the lives of others. <p>Due to a strange mixup the lives of Samuel L Jackson and a good Ben Affleck are changed forever. Jackson plays an alcoholic who wants his children back and Affleck plays a lawyer on Wall Street. Evryone around him is urging him to bend the rules to get things done, something he regrets in the end.<p>it's a good thriller with almost no violence, explosions etc. It's worth seeing, also to see what a great actor Jackson is.</p></br><a href="../users/A25ZVI6RH1KA5L.html">A25ZVI6RH1KA5L</a><br/><p>`One Wrong Turn Deserves Another", that's the tagline for the film Changing Lanes (2002), starring Ben Affleck and Samuel L. Jackson, directed by Roger Michell, someone I've never heard of before here, but I found out he also directed the Julia Roberts film Notting Hill (1999), which I have yet to see, mostly because Julia Roberts kinda scares me with those big horse teeth of hers.<p>As the film begins, we sort of meet two individuals, a fancy schmanzy lawyer named Gavin Banek (Affleck) and a telephone insurance salesman Doyle Gipson (Jackson).  The two men, while both on their way to court, Banek involved in a case worth a lot of money to the law firm he's a partner in, and Gipson involved in a custody hearing with his divorced wife, get into a car accident with each other.  Gipson wants to handle the situation in the correct manner, but Banek, who caused the accident, has little time to deal with the formalities, tries to deal with the matter expeditiously, pawning off a blank check on Gipson, leaving not only the scene of the accident, but leaving Gipson stranded as his car is totaled.  In his haste, Banek accidentally leaves an important document with Gipson, one that could potentially cost his firm over 100 million dollars and even prison time for Banek.  As a result of the accident and being stranded by Banek, Gipson misses his appearance, and the court rules against him, allowing for his ex-wife to move away with their two sons.  Banek, in the meantime, is allowed until the end of the day to produce the lost document, and later discovers Gipson still has possession of it, but is disgruntled over the treatment he received from Banek and losing his custody hearing, setting up a cycle of revenge between the two men, each sort of `one upping' each other to increasingly dangerous and life-altering levels.<p>First of all, I just had a hard time buying Affleck as a partner in a big law firm, despite the fact that his father-in-law, played wonderfully by Sidney Pollack, is also a partner.  I think he's a decent actor, a bit over-rated, and he's certainly got the smarmy quality down, inherent in many of his roles, but I didn't feel like he had the level of intelligence required to hold the position he does...and are all lawyers smarmy, greedy, opportunistic liars looking to rip people off?  Maybe...I don't know, but this movie would have you believe so...Jackson is pretty good, but he's pretty much playing a role I've seen numerous times before from him, the angry, loud black man who yells a lot.  It's toned down a little here, but not much.  In the film, we find his wife left him because of his problem with alcohol and his addiction to rage.  Throughout the film, she would seem on the verge of possibly reconciling with him, but then would quickly change her mind.  This happened three or fours times, and given the film takes place over the course of one day, I could see where Jackson's character might react the way he does, given that she has such a penchant for flip flopping.  One of the things I disliked about this film was each time one of the main characters would initiate some form of revenge on the other, they would suffer from moralistic pangs, which would soon pass as the cycle continued.  And honestly, there weren't really any likeable characters in this film, despite any attempts of redemption by the characters within the story.  Banek is a self-serving lawyer, one whose professional dealings seem awful shady (he struggles with this throughout most of the movie, as we are supposed to believe his conscious is now bothering him, despite his previous actions).  Oh yeah, he's also an adulterer...and Jackson's character, a recovering alcoholic telephone insurance salesman with confrontation issues, one who his AA sponsor (played by William Hurt) say is `addicted to chaos'.  We do see him desperately trying to put the pieces of his life back together and develop a relationship with his two young sons, but I always got the feeling like his attempts were always too little, too late.  I did like the performances by Pollack and Hurt, even though they got so little screen time and it seemed like their characters were a bit contrived as plot devices, both seemingly only present to serve as external forces for good, with Hurt and Jackson, and bad, with Pollack and Affleck, to put it simply.  Toni Collette makes an appearance or two, as a colleague of Affleck at his law firm, but her character is almost a non-character, offering little more than a foil for Banek to bounce off of as he deals with his conscience.  And I have to say, while I think she's normally an attractive woman, she did not look good here, with here bleached out hair.  I was expecting a much different direction at the end, as the film reminded me slightly of the 1993 Michael Douglas film Falling Down, in that events continuously build on each other leading to an inevitable conclusion, but here, things wrapped up just a bit too convenient for my tastes, especially given the self destructive nature of the characters and events that transpired.  <p>The wide screen anamorphic picture here looks wonderful, and there are a few special features available including a really worthwhile commentary track by the director, a 15 minute `Making of' featurette, deleted and extended scenes (only about three total and not really offering much more to the story), a five minute `A Writer's Perspective' featurette, and a theatrical trailer for the film.  The product page here mentions alternative endings, but I didn't see those listed in the special features of the disc.  By the way, if you ever get into a one upping contest with Samuel L. Jackson, check your car's lug nuts regularly.<p>Cookieman108</p></br><a href="../users/AO3JW5VHT2GQ.html">AO3JW5VHT2GQ</a><br/><p>Summary:<br />Gavin Banek (Ben Affleck) and Doyle Gipson (Samuel L. Jackson) just happen to meet when neither of them can really afford to, because when they do, all hell breaks loose.  Gavin is a high-powered attorney on his way to cheat a charity out of millions of dollars.  Doyle is an insurance salesman and a recovering alcoholic who is about to lose his children in a custody hearing.  When Gavin swerves into Doyle on the freeway while distracted on his cell phone, Doyle tries to do what is right by getting Gavin to exchange insurance information.  But Gavin is in such a hurry that instead he simply offers Doyle a blank check.  And even though they are headed to the same courthouse Gavin refuses to offer Doyle a ride.  As it turns out Gavin leaves the major document in his court case at the scene of the accident where Doyle picks it up.  Doyle, not having a ride, rushes to the courthouse but is too late to prevent his wife from gaining complete custody of the kids so she can move out of state and prevent him from seeing them anymore.  <p>Gavin, to save his job and prevent himself from going to prison, needs the folder with the documents from Doyle.  Doyle is upset with Gavin because if he hadn't run into him or, even then, if Gavin had given him a ride, Doyle wouldn't be loosing his kids.  What results is an hour and a half of two men vacillating between trying to kill each other and then trying to help each other for an a very long day. <p>My Comments:<br />First of all, the acting wasn't atrocious, which to me is surprising seeing as how Ben Affleck is, well, a mediocre actor at best (don't believe me? watch Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back).  And Samuel L. Jackson is typically only good when he is violent, which he does get to do occasionally in this movie; otherwise I don't think he can't really act (don't believe me? watch Star Wars: Episode I).  So, the movie was actually surprising in terms of the acting, perhaps because I didn't have very high hopes to begin with.<p>The story idea was actually kind of interesting, but only after they tried to really hurt the other person the first time.  After the five millionth time they tried to hurt the other person the movie lost my interest completely.  I was continuously staring at the time counter to see how long the movie was going to continue, and it just kept going and going.  What's worse, nothing is ever really resolved in a satisfactory way - Gavin is still a crook, but what's worse, he blackmails his bosses who are crooks (making him doubly crooked?).  <p>Which leads to the next point, the whole subplot of Gavin finding out that he is a 'dirty' lawyer was pretty [weak].  It was almost as though the director of the movie realized that the main plot was only worth about 50 minutes of screen time so he had to come up with some pretty [weak] subplots to fill up another 40 to 50 minutes.<p>After the movie was over my wife was convinced that she had just lost nearly two hours of time - time that was completely wasted.  When I pressed her for what she thought, her first comment was, "Do you really think people would behave that way?"  My response, "Well, would we really want to watch a movie where the people were normal?"  But, I must admit, the movie was remarkably far-fetched, at least from my perspective.  I'm not a New Yorker and I've never been to New York, so perhaps the portrayal of these two New Yorkers as vicious, almost homicidal, maniacs was accurate, but I highly doubt it.  <p>Anyway, I think you could possibly enjoy this movie if you watched about the first 30 minutes then about the last ten.  The repeated attacks back and forth are tedious, pointless, and tiresome.  I don't recommend this movie unless you enjoy road rage.</p></br><a href="../users/A91LE0MPYE8GJ.html">A91LE0MPYE8GJ</a><br/><p>My thoughts of this movie....Well it wasn't what I'd expect it to be and Samual L.

I did like him as George Reeves in the Superman movie but for god sake... this guy is like a piece of notty pine. He is just plain horrible as an actor. He should stick to kissing Kevin Smiths butt and being in his stupid movies because he is a bad actor.<br /><br />Samuel L. Jackson was funny at first. But his cussing and shouting gimmick has really gotten old.<br /><br />This movie is predictable, simple and just a bore.</p></br><a href="../users/A34D4KCP94ACJZ.html">A34D4KCP94ACJZ</a><br/><p>South African director Roger Michell directs this hit suspense thriller starring Ben Affleck and Samuel L. Jackson.  Michell is actually very skilled and has a tremendous amount of mainstream appeal.  He also directed last years Venus, which was another solid film albeit very different from Changing Lanes.  Ben Affleck plays Gavin, a successful Wall Street attorney who must file a power of appointment for his company, which is run by his father-in-law played by Sydney Pollack.  The document will sign a company over to his law firm and that company is owned by a dying man.  Ethical questions certainly surround the document and as things unfold we find out even more.  Doyle is played by Samuel L. Jackson, he is an insurance salesman and a recovering alcoholic who wants badly to restore his family before his wife takes his children away to the west coast.  We get the feeling that Doyle is a wounded man and his actions are unacceptable at times.  Actually both characters are deeply flawed and that is what makes their collision so engaging.<br /><br />On his way to court to file this crucial document, Gavin gets into a car accident with Doyle.  He doesn't prioritize the accident and instead must leave the scene to make it to court on time.  Doyle's car will not drive and he is in the middle of a highway median when Gavin takes off in a rush.  It of course begins to rain.  Doyle himself was on his way to court and when he eventually gets there he finds out that he is too late.  His goal was to surprise his wife with a mortgage loan he just received so his family would stay.  He was attempting to get some resolution to whatever chaos he may have caused his family before this movie begins.  Unfortunately for Gavin the power of appointment was left at the scene of the accident and is in Doyle's possession.  Doyle, sour for being left in the rain on the highway and missing his chance in court, refuses to give Gavin the document.  Needless to say they both have reasonable vendettas against one another and the battle they have escalates throughout as the film goes forward.  These two men are basically dehumanized to one another and it doesn't help matters that they both come from entirely different worlds. They are opposites in life, so they are fundamentally opposed to one another when the first sign of conflict surfaces.  It turns out that Changing Lanes evolves into a unique commentary on the darkest sides of human nature.  It is unique because we visit these dark decisions by way of likeable and real character portrayals.  To avoid spoilers, I won't reveal anymore than I have already.<br /><br />Samuel L. Jackson is obviously an outstanding actor and he is great here but the most surprising thing is Ben Affleck matches him and then some.  It's a shame Ben's reputation as an actor was so horrible at the time Changing Lanes came out because his performance definitely deserved some praise.  Sydney Pollack is also outstanding as an exceptionally believable and accessible villain.  A lot of the credit goes to the screenplay here for exposing pragmatic reactions to specific circumstances instead of superficial morality.  There are no purely ethical and moral figures in Changing Lanes, but then again I can't think of too many in real life either.  If they did exist in Changing Lanes then its commentary would be disrupted completely, but I still held out hoping reason would creek into the picture.  Chaos reigns here and humanity is called upon to prevail.  It puts suspense on a much larger societal scale for me.  I know that the ending bothered those hoping for something more retributive but try to see Changing Lanes as a story about healing, not revenge.</p></br><a href="../users/A3L2U581LL17EB.html">A3L2U581LL17EB</a><br/><p>Changing Lanes happens to feature two movie stars in the lead roles and is funded by Paramount Pictures, one of the top film production studios. So is it with anything less than pure surprise that this doesn't turn out to be an action or buddy picture? Not only does this film happen to be a character-driven thriller, it's also an intriguing look at societal pressures on the human individual, delivering in a manner that is intense, edgy, and perhaps even quite frightening.<p>Ben Affleck stars as Gavin Banek and Samuel L. Jackson is Doyle Gipson. Banek is a high-priced lawyer who is ready to finalize a big deal with will turn over a recently deceased millionaire's entire fortune to his firm. Gipson is a recovering alcoholic who's doing everything he can (mainly by purchasing a house in Queens for them to settle in) to save his marriage and keep his wife from taking the children and moving to another state. Both Banek and Gipson are on their way to court when their cars crash into each other. <p>Gipson wants to get everything done legally, "the right way," but Banek is in too much of a hurry, so he simply leaves a blank check and takes off to court, leaving the other man stranded. However, Banek leaves the most important file at the scene of the accident (which Gipson is now in possession of), and Gipson misses his own court hearing, losing any chance for custody of his kids to his wife. Banek's determination to get the file back and Gipson's anger and frustration turns this cross of paths into a game of cat-and-mouse and revenge which makes for probably the most lopsided day of their lives.<p>Changing Lanes is a film that surprised me almost every minute of the way. There's a lot of plot and theme at work here, but I want to emphasize that this is hardly pretentious filmmaking; it's an honest look at just how far pressure can push normal men, as well as how such pressure can bring out the best qualities in these same people. After a rather clumsy introduction and a chaotically directed crash scene that felt rather rushed, the film settled in comfortably into its main story. On the surface, the movie plays perfectly well as a thriller, certainly enough to satisfy thriller buffs looking for hard-edged suspense. <p>But further yet, the film becomes a character study of two men who lead opposite lives, but perhaps aren't as dissimilar as each may think. Rich and affluent, Affleck's Banek is a man on the top, but despite his seemingly arrogant and impatient behavior, he displays a moral and conflicted center, torn by what's right and what everyone else-namely his boss, co-workers, wife-says is right. Undoubtedly the most complex character Affleck has ever played, this is also the young actor's best performance to date.<p>Samuel L. Jackson is easily one of the best actors around, and his portrayal here is absolutely terrific, perhaps his most substantial performance since his role in Pulp Fiction. Gipson is certainly less priveleged than Banek, and this societal gap displays an interesting effect once things get out of hand. Gipson represents the majority of us, the working middle class that's frustrated when fate hands him a wrong turn.  The disastrous day that Gipson endures is affecting, and it's both simultaneously crushing and exhilarating to see a reasonable man go to the extremes.  <p>There are far more themes at work here, and I've only touched on the surface.  For instance, there's a powerful scene where Amanda Peet (as Banek's wife) delivers a coldly manipulative speech that clues us in as to why Banek would cheat on his beautiful wife with a less physically attractive, but far kinder, more emotionally supportive woman (played well by Toni Collete).  Another similarly powerhouse sequence is Sydney Pollack's (playing Banek's boss) diatribe on ethics in business and why the cutthroat method is the only effective tool for pressing business matters.  With an abundance of moments like these, there's so much theme at work in the script that the film simply demands repeat viewings.<p>Changing Lanes is always entertaining, thanks to Roger Mitchell's well-paced and sure-handed direction, and the script never falters when it comes to both story and thematic material, mixing both together without ever coming off as preachy. The film has lots to offer, and for viewers willing to take the ride, the rewards are plentiful. It's been a fine year for movies so far, and without a doubt, Changing Lanes is one of the best cinematic offerings to date.</p></br><a href="../users/A457S8SW690NM.html">A457S8SW690NM</a><br/><p>This movie has got to be one of my favorite movies by far because it's different. It's unique, it's just different from other movies and should be put in a different gnere for that reason even though it's a drama movie. Ben Affleck plays an attorney while Samuel L. Jackson (one of the best actors!!!) plays a car salesman. When there is a car accident between the two, the attorney leaves the scene because he has to be in court. But the car salesman also needed to be in court so that he can get joint custody of his children. But, his car doesn't work now, and he loses custody of his children. In the meantime, the attorney is missing important paperwork which he accidentally left at the accident and the salesman now posseses and refuses to give back. The two then engage in a "war". But, the protagonist clearly is the salesman as you feel terribly for him after what the attorney does to him. The movie is sad and tragic with an amazing performance by Jackson and I shall always remember it for it's unique plot and amazing delivery. Highly reccomended.</p></br><a href="../users/A1J2931UBBJPXM.html">A1J2931UBBJPXM</a><br/><p>With the advent of the internet, all things electronic or digital, and fast food, our world has become altogether too small, and everything moves entirely too fast.  With so much happening all the time, everywhere, and with so many different ways to go, people have become preoccupied, which can be dangerous if the momentum propelling an individual happens to come to cross purposes with that same kind of momentum driving another, and the two converge.  And it happens.  "Things" happen; and when they do, the important thing is that all parties involved react responsibly and focus their individual attention on the matter at hand.  If either side fails in this regard, it can mean big trouble.  it means you suddenly have a situation; and it's just such a situation that is explored by director Roger Michell in "Changing Lanes," a tension filled drama starring Ben Affleck and Samuel L. Jackson.<p> Gavin Banek (Affleck) is a successful lawyer, a partner in the firm and married to Cynthia (Amanda Peet), the daughter of his boss, Stephen Delano (Sydney Pollack).  He's currently handling a probate case worth millions to the firm; he's due in court, where he simply has to present a document that will, for all intents and purposes, wrap up the proceedings.  But fate is waiting in the wings.  In another part of town, Doyle Gipson (Samuel L. Jackson) is also about to wrap up a deal-- a loan for a house that will keep his estranged wife, Valerie (Kim Staunton), from moving with their two boys, Stephen (Akil Walker) and Danny (Cole Hawkins), to Portland, Oregon, or as Doyle sees it, half way across the world.  <p> When Gavin and Doyle get into their respective cars to head to court, they are strangers to one another; they are about to meet, however, when heavy traffic on the expressway and their own preoccupied mental states precipitate a collision-- a minor car accident that ultimately effects a much bigger wreck in both their lives.  In his rush to meet his appointed court time, Gavin leaves the scene of the accident and, more importantly, leaves Doyle-- who also has an appointment in court (his child custody hearing, no less)-- stranded, and out of time.  Ironically, the document Gavin must file in court is inadvertently in the confusion of the accident left behind on the expressway, and is now in Doyle's hands.  And so the conundrum; loss of the document may mean jail time to Gavin.  To Doyle, the loss of twenty minutes may mean losing his children.  The question now is, how will these two men solve their dilemma?  One has what the other needs, but how do you give "time" back to someone?<p> This film, nicely fashioned by screenwriters Chap Taylor and Michael Tolkin, and extremely well crafted and delivered by director Michell, is at it's core a character study that examines the effects of desperation and the emotional responses elicited thereof.  It explores how anger and frustration can in the heat of the moment negatively affect even an individual who under normal circumstances is predisposed to abiding by his own conscience; how even the most rational among us has the capacity for irrational behavior if provoked by unmitigated circumstances.  At one point in the film, one of the characters observes that it's like two guys have been dropped into a paper bag together and shaken up, just to see what happens; and that about sums it up.  And Michell does an excellent job of keeping the story on track, setting a good pace and maintaining the tension that keeps the audience involved.  It's straightforward storytelling that is well presented and effective.<p> As Gavin, Affleck gives a solid performance, developing his character quite nicely as the story unfolds.  When the film begins, Gavin is in a comfort zone, a place that allows him the tunnel vision necessary to do what he does with a clear conscience.  In a way, he's naive; a guy who's been led down the path and made to believe that all is well in the land of the free.  By the end of the film, we see a different Gavin-- or at least an "awakened" Gavin; the same man, perhaps, but with an entirely different perspective on life.  And Affleck's portrayal makes it convincing, and brings Gavin to life in a very real way.  A good job by a fine young actor with the ability to tap into that emotional depth that makes his character believable.<p> Samuel L. Jackson hits his stride, as well, as Doyle, a character whose outward demeanor masks the complexities lying beneath the surface, but which Jackson brings incisively to light.  Doyle is your average guy, an insurance salesman, but a man plagued by the demons of addiction; he's a man addicted to chaos, evidenced by the failed relationships in his life and his inability to cope with the situation engendered by his encounter with Gavin.  Jackson creates a character with whom you can empathize, even as he makes you aware of the rage within him that could explode at any minute.  Doyle understands only too well the dire, probable consequences of being unable to quell his anger, and through his portrayal, Jackson makes the audience aware of it, as well; and it's a pivotal point in the story, which he successfully conveys.  And it's that unstable element of Doyle's personality that makes this more than just a story about right or wrong, or who's going to win; it means anything can happen, and it keeps you wondering right up to the end what that something is going to be.<p> The supporting cast includes William Hurt (The Sponsor), Toni Collette (Michelle), Richard Jenkins (Walter), Tina Sloan (Mrs. Delano), Ileen Getz (Ellen), Sam Rovin (Paralegal) and Jennifer Dundas (Mina).  A morality tale that, be advised, does not take too kindly to lawyers, "Changing Lanes" is an engrossing film that delivers much than what is promised, even, by the trailers; a worthwhile cinematic experience.</p></br><a href="../users/A17FLA8HQOFVIG.html">A17FLA8HQOFVIG</a><br/><p>Starring Ben Affleck and Samuel L. Jackson, this is the story of how a seemingly small fender-bender incident changed the lives of two men forever. Affleck is cast as Gavin Banek, a young Wall Street lawyer married to the boss's daughter, who is on his way to court to file some papers that were obtained unethically. He doesn't have the document with him, however, and realizes he  lost it during his encounter with Jackson on the expressway. Jackson, cast as Doyle Gibson, is a recovering alcoholic, who is also on his way to court.  He's in the process of obtaining a mortgage on a modest house and is trying to keep his wife from moving across the country with his two young sons. When he is 20 minutes late for the custody hearing, he loses his case. Both men are now hurtled into a series of confrontations with the kind ofescalating intensity that kept my eyes glued to the screen as the tension increased.<p>The screenplay, by Chap Taylor and Michael Tolkin, was excellent, and kept the audience not only wondering what would happen next, but also gradually understanding the character of each man, and how this affected their next moves.  The plot twisted and turned as the men became more and more real, with the human frailties that hurtled the action along, showing how the way that each had been living his life contributed to what would happen next. Some deeply moral and ethical questions were raised with no easy answers. And in, at the end, as each man had to deal with his own personal demons, the conclusion was resolved on a positive note, leaving everyone wiser.<p>Roger Michell, the director, was able to get outstanding performances out of all of the supporting cast members, as well as the stars - most notably Toni Collette as a colleague and sometime mistress of Affleck, Amanda Peet as his wife, Sidney Pollack as the head of the law firm, and Kim Staunton as Jackson's wife.  The New York setting was also wonderful and I'm glad that a decision was made not to edit out the World Trade Towers.  It was a real and important part of New York, and I personally enjoyed seeing them there, a visual reminder of how quickly things can change, which fit in perfectly with the story.<p>I highly recommend this film, not just for the action, but also for the uncompromising view of how a person's character determines the outcome of situations and the hard choices that have to be made every day.  See it!</p></br><a href="../users/A2198FZZMTJ38H.html">A2198FZZMTJ38H</a><br/><p>"Changing Lanes" is everything that its trailer is not, and that's a good thing. Movie previews for this refreshingly different thriller tout it as a fast-paced revenge machine, but in actuality, it moves at a much slower speed, developing its story and characters in a manner that brings us into their lives rather than placing us on the sidelines. The ending is a bit meak, but the suspense is non-stop, the acting superb, and the overall effect a satisfying one. <p>The beginning keeps details at bay, introducing fragments of the puzzle that will later come together. Ben Affleck plays Gavin Banek, a successful young attorney who has been sent by his firm to deliver important files concerning A) a charitable institution, and B) a very disgruntled granddaughter of its now-deceased founder. On the opposite end of the spectrum, we meet Samuel L. Jackson's middle-class father, Doyle Gibson, who is in the process of taking out a loan for a home in the hopes that his ex-wife will accept the action as a peace offering instead of taking their two children to Oregon. <p>The two men are both on their way to the courthouse. They have an accident after Banek attempts to change lanes, causing Gibson to careen into a freeway divider. Gibson wants to exchange insurance information ("I wanna do things the right way"); Banek, in a frenzied rush, gives him a blank check and speeds off, unaware that in his search for his checkbook, an important file landed on the street. Gibson retrieves the file, thumbs a ride to the courthouse, too late to make his statement in the custody case; Banek, who discovers his file is missing, is given an end-of-the-day deadline to come up with the document. <p>This all occurs within the first twenty minutes of the film, but not to worry: there's more to it than what we've seen, or what we think will happen. Much of what goes on centers around the important document, that which delegates the power to make decisions for the institution to the law firm. Banek lies to his two partners, telling them the case was ruled in their favor to tide them over while he attempts to get the file back from Gibson. <p>This is where the good gets even better, as the two men engage in a battle of wills and wits. It's like a game, really, an ongoing silent war in which a double-cross is payed back within the hour. Banek enlists the help of a hacker known for his ability to "help out with things that need helping out." He infiltrates Gibson's bank accounts, bankrupting him of his precious loan ("I need this loan for my life," Gibson later pleads with the teller), setting in motion a chain reaction of events that lead to an uncertain destination. <p>I must say, the film packs a real whallop in its first and second acts. The somewhat slow pacing is in its favor, allowing us to understand the characters while at the same time putting real effort into the explanations of various plot twists and new developments. There is an underlying web of deception underneath the action that centers around the document, the law firm, and the institution, that which I will not reveal. This subplot turns out to be the basis for the thrills, and it is smart and cooly calculated without insulting one's intelligence. <p>Also backing the film is its terrific cast, featuring two leads who play off one other so well, they could carry the movie by themselves. Jackson is a man of many virtues, and he displays a versatility here that is mesmerizing and intense. We feel for this man as a father, and as a person, and can come to understand his reasoning. Affleck has found a role befitting of his acting ability; there is a diversity of emotions to Banek's character, much of which revolves around being held at the whim of a man he hardly knows, and Affleck portrays this exquisitely. <p>The film worked for me right up until the ending, which is well-intentioned, but doesn't quite live up to the goals the material sets for itself. But to think about it further is to realize that there is really no other way for "Changing Lanes" to end without descending into the ludicrousness that plagues most thrillers; the ending we are supplied with is safe while not being totally satisfactory. Up until this point, there are thrills, surprises, and acting gusto aplenty, making the experience an enjoyable and involving one.</p></br><a href="../users/A2F3M93RRLFQNJ.html">A2F3M93RRLFQNJ</a><br/><p>Most movies have good guys and bad guys, or at the very least, protagonists and antagonists.  You watch the film and you understand who to root for.  This movie does not fit into that category.  The characters alternate between being heroes and villains and you're never quite certain who to sympathize with; done properly, this can be compelling, but here, it is a mixed success at best.<p>The two principal characters are as similar as they are different.  Affleck plays a lawyer who has pawned his conscience for a beautiful wife and a nice car; Jackson is an insurance salesman whose alcoholism masks his true problem of a vicious temper.  Both are flawed characters and not very likeable, so it is hard to care about either of them.  In addition, if either of the characters practiced anything approached true civility, they could have defused the situation (and of course ended the movie).<p>Affleck's character alternates between minor evil and minor good, while Jackson is more extreme on both ends.  It is a creative device, but it only partially works, and if there was enough to have kept me watching, there wasn't enough to really make me care.</p></br><a href="../users/ATS7LYGLUX34L.html">ATS7LYGLUX34L</a><br/><p>A simple traffic accident causes two very different men, who ordinarily would never come into each others orbits, to become inextricably linked in a day-long game of cat-and-mouse, with each man's future hanging in the balance.<p>  Ben Affleck plays your typical slimy uptown Lawyer. He's involved in a shady deal, where he and his partners are bilking a charity they're representing, he's cheating on his wife, etc., etc. Samuel L. Jackson is a recovering alcoholic trying to pick up the pieces of his shattered marriage. When a poorly-timed (Both men are due in court- Jackson for a custody hearing, Affleck for the aforementioned Charity-bilking scheme...) lane change on Affleck's part causes the two men to meet, Affleck's rude handling of the situation causes Jackson to be late for Court. He loses custody of his Kids, and it looks as if he may never see them again. But Affleck is missing an important file...it seems as if he handed it to Jackson at the accident scene, and without it, not only might he lose his case, but he might lose his freedom as well. <p> The movie screams along as the two resort to ever-increasing levels of anti-social behavior (Affleck needs the file back, Jackson wants his LIFE back.), and even though it's pretty much a big morality play (Be nice to others and play fair!), it never bogs down into preachiness, and the ending is a nice change from what I went in expecting. Very different.<p>  The performances are solid, especially the ever-dependable Jackson. Sidney Pollack is very manacing as Affleck's boss....<p>A very impressive effort all around.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IOJE0W1NXOSE.html">A1IOJE0W1NXOSE</a><br/><p>Ben Affleck and Samuel Jackson play two men who meet by chance during a traffic accident.  Both are in a hurry to get to a courtroom, Affleck for a business matter and Jackson, to try to get custody of his two boys.  Affleck leaves Jackson stranded at the scene of the accident, not knowing that he has left him with a crucial file.  Jackson arrives at the courthouse too late to plead his case and thus a vendetta begins.  The men play a life-or-death chess match, each striking at the other's weaknesses in order to gain an advantage.  The feud continues on a downward spiral until jobs, wives, homes, and lives are threatened.  The viewer is forced to examine himself and ask what he would do in a similar situation.  The answers are not easy or comfortable.  This is an excellent movie, a morality play that asks the question--does the end justify the means?</p></br><a href="../users/A1FG91CM8221X1.html">A1FG91CM8221X1</a><br/><p>Thanks to enthusiastic reviews and my admiration for the lead actors, I was really looking forward to "Changing Lanes." Jackson and Affleck certainly didn't disappoint, and the film provided a decent share of thrills and suspense, yet it left me oddly unmoved at the end. After thinking about the movie, I know why: "Changing Lanes" focuses so single-mindedly on Jackson and Affleck that no one else registers. Every other character is a plot device existing only to influence Jackson and Affleck in their escalating war against each other. The only exception is Toni Collette as Affleck's colleague and ex-lover, and her character becomes steadily less significant as the film progresses. Thus the film becomes simultaneously too claustrophobic and too scattered; since Jackson and Affleck share very little screen time, they spend most of their performances wandering among ciphers. This is too bad, because Jackson's controlled rage--which suddenly flares with hellfire fury--is very impressive, as is Affleck's delicate balancing act with conflicting feelings of smugness, frustration and remorse. Those two fine actors make "Changing Lanes" worth seeing--but at a bargain matinee, rather than at full price.</p></br><a href="../users/AU25GMX57XBVO.html">AU25GMX57XBVO</a><br/><p>Don't get me wrong, I am a big fan of Samual L.

Miller</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>This film is surprisingly strong despite a few clich&eacute; areas and some overly preachy and sympathetic moments.  The idea behind the film was interesting, and the construction (and marvelous direction) keeps the audience on the edge of their seats throughout the films running length.<br /><br />The film tells the story of two men (one down on his luck reformed alcoholic and one successful attorney working on the deal of his career) who are thrust into each others lives through a car accident.  Gavin, the attorney, is on his way to court when he causes a collision of sorts with Doyle.  Doyle is in a hurry too, rushing to get to a different kind of court, the kind where you fight for custody.  Because of the accident, and Gavin's rudeness, Doyle is late and loses custody to his wife.  What is worse, his wife is leaving town with the kids which means that Doyle will barely see them, if at all.  What he soon realizes is that he has something very important in his possession; a file that Gavin left at the scene of the crime that Doyle can now use as a means to get back at him.<br /><br />But that document is too important for Gavin to just give up.<br /><br />`Changing Lanes' has some genre issues, and it certainly loses a little of it's gruff realism to the clich&eacute;s of the genre (it makes some generic decisions that lead it in directions I wasn't hoping for) but in the end the film really pops visually and emotionally, which is needed in character studies like this one.  It also boasts some nicely crafted performances by two men known for their charm and charisma.  While I don't consider either of them `great actors' (well, Jackson WAS superb in the 90's, but he has lost a lot of steam for me as of late), they both turn in excellent work in this film, especially Affleck who may deliver the performance of his career.  He battles Gavin's internal struggle effortlessly, shifting from corporate villain to frustrated `human' with ease and believability.<br /><br />You hate his actions but you are strangely endeared to him.<br /><br />I thought that the character of Doyle was too much of a clich&eacute; to really rally behind.  It isn't to say that Gavin's character was devoid of clich&eacute;s (but, to be honest, it was really his work plot that was the clich&eacute;) but the script was kinder to him.  Doyle's character just melts down into something very predictable, which I wasn't happy with considering the promise he held.<br /><br />Still, Jackson made the most of it.<br /><br />In the end I'm giving this thrill ride a solid B.  Director Roger Michell REALLY understood how to create a bounty of tension, and he draws from his actors to elevate the issues in the script.  If it had a tighter and less conventional script (yes, the idea has flares of originality, but it is woven rather generically) then this could have been a near flawless film.  Instead, it'll have to settle for underseen and undervalued.<br /><br />Watch it.</p></br><a href="../users/AJUFIGATSP9AQ.html">AJUFIGATSP9AQ</a><br/><p>A city highway bumper becomes a major modern tragedy.

Commentary seemed slow at times but there were a good amount of behind-the-scene tidbits on working with the various talent, deviations from the original screenplay but most of all, how they wanted to handle the scenes that featured the World Trade Center as he felt despite shooting the footage in Jan. 2001, having removed it post 9/11 but then deciding to keep the Twin Towers in the final cut.  Michell is very complimentary to his cast and crew but showing how people working on the film did a wonderful job when it came to cinematography and even production design.<br />  * The Making of Changing Lanes - A 15 minute featurette that is a making-of, with interviews with the cast and crew about the making of "CHANGING LANES".  And quite interesting that you have the movie man doing voice overs at the beginning and end.<br />  * A Writer's Perspective - A six minute featurette on the overall screenplay with interviews with screenplay writers Chap Taylor and Michael Tolkin who both seem to enjoy the lunch between Gavin and his wife.<br />  * Deleted Scenes - A total of two deleted scenes.  One featuring Gavin with a student Gordon Pinella who needed to be interviewed for a job and another with Doyle meeting with his boss in regards to his performance at work.  Two scenes that deserved to be cut from the film.<br />  * Extended Scene - Featuring a single extended scene when Gavin was at the church and in the confession booth as he puts the blame on Doyle for what is happening with his life.  In the film, we know how Gavin's state of mind, so I'm glad they shortened it in the film and not let it run this long.<br />  * Original Theatrical Trailer - The original theatrical trailer in HD.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />"CHANGING LANES" was a film that definitely had an interesting premise.  What if these two men who feel their lives were wrecked because of their one incident, tried to one up each other and nearly destroy themselves in the process.<br /><br />People who let their anger and their hatred get the best of them and while its nearly too late, just enough time to see how they let it go too far.<br /><br />What Chap Taylor and Michael Tolkin are able to come up with for the screenplay is to manipulate the audience into rooting for a certain side and then you just realize that these two men are just too flawed and are way over their heads.<br /><br />If anything, it's the "what if" that becomes an entertaining experiment of exposing the human element of revenge.  We hear and read about vindictive people getting back to each other, "CHANGING LANES" shows people of that unthinkable moral potential if one is able to go too far.<br /><br />Samuel Jackson does a wonderful job of playing the character of Doyle Gipson but most of all, a man that has his own demons to contend with and in one scene, is told that he enjoys living in chaos.  If anything, the interaction with Jackson's Gipson and Affleck's Gavin Banek made Affleck's performance much more believable.  Sydney Pollack, Kim Staunton and Toni Collette also do well onscreen despite their short duration onscreen.<br /><br />Overall, "CHANGING LANES" is one of those clever films that is enjoyable but as for owning it on Blu-ray, its left to the viewer's choice if its a film worthy of repeated viewings.</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>This smart anagram resumes this dramatis personae between two strangers who will be implied in what it seemed to be an unpleasant encounter in the m the middle of a vial artery in Manhattan.<br /><br />Two citizens, one of them is a desperate man, who must assist a very important legal question, the other is an unworried and prestigious lawyer.

I have to say that Chap Taylor & Michael Tolkin wrote a great story for this film. Each little thing that happened in this film had me hooked waiting on what would happen next. Also Director Roger Michell did a great job with this film; his vision for this film was great. Of course you know that the acting in this film was great, Samuel L. Jackson as always was perfect in is role as the down & out good guy who deserves better. And at the opposite end of the spectrum is the high class, highly paid lawyer who has slipped from his moral ways played perfectly by Ben Affleck.<br /><br />The story for all those who don't know is about two very late people who end up in a very bad situation. One is a down 7 out man {Jackson} who just needs to get to court to try and get his kids. The other is a lawyer {Affleck} who is running late to put the last nail in the coffin of some one who used to tryst him. Well neither gets what they want when they have an accident on the road which causes both to be very late. Jackson doesn't get any custody rights to his kid, and Affleck loses a paper he needs. It turns out Jackson's character has the paper and the two have an all out war over that little piece of paper.<br /><br />If you haven't seen it I recommend that you do, this is a very entertaining film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2XVRCU5DQBULH.html">A2XVRCU5DQBULH</a><br/><p>Ben Affleck has really grown as an actor in the past year. This is his best performance since &quot;Chasing Amy,&quot; and that's a hard one to beat. He plays Gavin, a lawyer who gets in an auto accident with Doyle, played by Samuel L. Jackson. Doyle gets his hands on some documents that Gavin needs for a case that very day and thus the two get into a cat-and-mouse escapade that feels surprisingly real as things unfold. The one thing this movie contains is an element of harsh realism and believability. Our characters are well scripted and the audience really understands them. We're never once asked to like our characters nor hate them. Instead, we are asked to empathize with them, especially Doyle, who is having family trouble and because of the accident is late to his divorce hearing. The one character we should like is Doyle, but even he has his faults. William Hurt plays an AA mentor who bails Doyle out of jail at one point and the two have a well-scripted conversation in which Hurt points out the faults of Jackson's character. &quot;Changing Lanes&quot; is definitely not a cheery film, but it is great in that the characters are three-dimensional and the acting is extremely good, especially from Affleck and Jackson. While this may not be one of Samuel L. Jackson's best films, at least it showcases Affleck as a talented, capable actor. I reccommend it to anyone looking for a movie that will make them think and requires more intelligence than the average popcorn flick.</p></br><a href="../users/AZ5250G2U795I.html">AZ5250G2U795I</a><br/><p>Changing Lanes is one of the more interestingly-premised psychological thriller-type films. (It definitely is more difficult to pinpoint this one...it manages to navigate through several different genres rather effectively)  While it borders on predictably formulated, Jackson's performance in this is, not surprisingly, terrific.<p>Two strangers find their lives intertwined unexpectedly after a car accident.  One is on his way up, and one is on his way out of the gutter, for lack of a better term.  Affleck, in a role seemed tailored for him, plays the young attorney on his way to power.  This role didn't seem like one of his greatest acting stretches, but it also wasn't mishandled.  He does manage to guide his characters zig zag-ing perceptions of right and wrong with the skill you would expect.<p>Jackson handles his part with much more of what you've come to expect.  He expertly handles his character's seeming disregard for all he has rebuilt in reaction to the sheer frustration and absurdity of his situation.  It's a much more complext part than is appears, and Jackson, again, is worth watching.<p>From a story perspective, it's not the tightest thriller you have ever seen, but it is an interesting twist on the typical cat-and-mouse game genre.</p></br><a href="../users/A19V0VJMKKRMC8.html">A19V0VJMKKRMC8</a><br/><p>I See What All The Buzz Was About.

While millions of people around the world are commemorating the crucifixion and atonement of Jesus Christ, Banek and Gibson find themselves acting out a little morality play of their own in the streets and skyscrapers of downtown Manhattan.  Along the way, they too will confront the issues of right and wrong, sin and redemption - and find out just how far into the depths of depravity their own moral codes will allow them to go.  Interestingly, the heightened unreality of some of the characters' more extreme actions brings to the tale much of the quality of a parable.  As a result, we don't have to believe every twist and turn of the plot in order to validate and appreciate it.<p>As the title of the film suggests, the theme revolves around what happens when the paths of two very distinct lives "accidentally" intersect.  These two individuals are total strangers before fate, chance, providence, the gods - whatever you want to call it - conspire to bring them together.  Banek is a hotshot young attorney who has married into his father-in-law's wealthy firm, while Gibson is a recovering alcoholic and AA member who is trying desperately to close the deal on a house so that his fed-up wife won't move with their boys to Oregon, far away from Gibson's deleterious influence.  Both desperate to get to their respective court dates - Banek to argue an important case and Gibson to plead for one more chance to keep his family from moving away - the two harried men meet up in a mild fender bender during morning rush hour traffic.  When Banek callously palms Gibson off with a blank check and leaves him stuck in traffic to fend for himself, the wheels are set in motion for the strange, offbeat tale of revenge and recrimination that ensues.  In the confusion of the accident, Banek does not realize that he has accidentally left a crucial folder in Gibson's possession.  Gibson, mistreated by Banek at the scene of the accident and refused a hearing by the court because of his tardiness, finds himself in no mood to turn the other cheek and help Banek by returning his folder.  The resultant game of cat-and-mouse, which could so easily have devolved into a cheap, tawdry melodrama of violence and revenge, instead achieves surprising moments of thought provoking depth and insight.<p>"Changing Lanes" is, indeed, that rarity among American films: a drama more concerned with issues and ideas than with cheap thrills and emotional exploitation.  Within the context of a densely plotted thriller, writer Chap Taylor has fashioned a film that is nothing less than a study of the part ethics plays in our daily lives.  Like all of us, Banek and Gibson contain within their beings both the seeds of goodness and the germs of evil.  The question becomes how far each is willing to go to cultivate those qualities when faced with the dilemmas and vicissitudes life throws their way.  Both men, though basically decent at the core, find themselves doing deeds that surprise even themselves when pushed into a corner by despair and desperation.  Rarely in the movies do we find characters this concerned with analyzing both the motives and the consequences of their actions.  In fact the film plays out like a classic morality play, with each man engaging in an internal struggle with his conscience as well as with the other person.  The underlying cynical subtext is, of course, that, in the corporate business world, all morality is relative, a fact Banek, in particular, is ultimately forced to face up to - and, by extension, to act upon.<p>Although it does seem to strain a bit to make its point every now and then - employing overemphasis when subtlety is what is really called for - the film boasts a number of beautiful and haunting moments such as when the director, Roger Michell, intercuts between a quiet, but highly charged and revelatory conversation Gibson has with his longsuffering wife and a scene of Banek seeking surcease from his guilt in a quiet confessional. <p>Ben Affleck and Samuel L. Jackson both do superb work at getting to the bottom of their respective characters' innermost feelings and thoughts.  David Arnold's somber musical score and Salvatore Totino's moody cinematography lend an appropriately otherworldly quality to this stark morality play, making the everyday world of city streets and soaring skyscrapers seem strangely twisted and menacing.  <p>"Changing Lanes" does lose its nerve a little at the end, as evidenced by a certain softness in its resolution. Nevertheless, it still deserves enormous credit for attempting to do what few other films even have the courage to try.  It's truly refreshing to see a film that respects the intelligence of its audience and which provides moviegoers with a little nutritional sustenance to go along with all that cinematic junk food Hollywood normally provides for us in such abundance.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZTSOBAPOWT3.html">A1ZTSOBAPOWT3</a><br/><p>An excellent movie about ethics. Ben Affleck and Samuel L. Jackson deliver emotionally charged peformances and touches the heart. How two different worlds can meet in a single moment can change everything. You'll have to watch it. People can change if their conscience tells them to do the right thing. So, pay attention Earth.</p></br><a href="../users/A1E0RPGCXS4L2G.html">A1E0RPGCXS4L2G</a><br/><p>While this movie did have some philosophical questions as to how far one will go to get what he wants it left me feeling like there should have been more presented in the movie.  I did not think on this movie for days like I have some in the past.  Samuel L. Jackson turned in a fine performance and Ben Affleck's was equally engrossing.  For Affleck's character to have a 100% turnaround at the ending and do the things he did for Jackson's character are unbelievable.  Without giving away too much of what happens it is just not feasible, in my opinion, to go to the depths that these characters did only to end up where they were at the end of the movie.  Maybe they were trying to show that good men and bad men are each less so than they appear.  <p>Unfortunately I left the theater feeling that I had seen the best parts of the movie in the previews and thinking to myself, "was that it?" "I thought there should have been more to it."  <p>Final assessemnt - wait for the video.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZHH7AK83JB5G.html">A2ZHH7AK83JB5G</a><br/><p>I was really impressed with the first thirty minutes or so of this film.  The movie is set in a very specific time and place - a rainy Good Friday in contemporary Manhattan (sometime before 9-11 as we see the World Trade Center and the release date was early 2002). In a morning auto accident hotshot Wall Street lawyer "Gavin" played by a barely adequate Ben Affleck hits a car driven by recovering alcoholic insurance salesman "Doyle" excellently portrayed by Samuel L. Jackson.  Both men are made late for court appearances and Affleck's character has inadvertently left an important legal file with Jackson  causing repercussions that lead to  escalating and improbable acts of revenge during the course of this spring Friday.<br /><br />One of the problems with the film is Affleck is unbelievable as Gavin as he does not impart the intelligence or drive one would expect to see in a rising Wall Street attorney.  One can never imagine him possessing the power and gravitas his father-in law (played by Sydney Pollock) commands as a senior partner.  Both his soft spoken pretty wife (Amanda Peet) and his career girl mistress (Toni Collette) are much stronger and decisive. Furthermore Gavin's "ethics crisis"  seems phony as we are supposed to believe an insider in a high power firm is suddenly opposed to white collar flimflam when he is not above some evil mischief against Doyle or cheating on his wife.  Samuel L. Jackson is excellent as Doyle a man who has anger and alcohol problems but desperately wants to get back in the good graces of his divorcing wife and two sons.  However he is so out of control (in one day we see him throw a computer through a bank window, beat up some characters he meets in a bar, attempt to kill Gavin by loosening his wheel and yell and scream at various other people) even when sober that it is difficult to believe he is functioning at all in life let alone on a job with some responsibility.  The premise of the film is good but the script needs more believability to rise above the typical Hollywood offering.</p></br><a href="../users/A3CWH6VKCTJAD.html">A3CWH6VKCTJAD</a><br/><p>It completely escapes me how this film got so many good reviews.  This is a good concept completely butchered by a ridiculous script.  I cannot begin to count the number of totally implausible situations that are conjured here.<p>Gavin Banek (Ben Affleck) has got to be one of the stupidest characters ever written.  This is supposed to be a bright young lawyer whose ambition has gotten the better of his principles.  Instead he comes across as a hapless loser.<p>When one understands that lawyers can lose their license to practice law for committing felonies even if they don't go to jail, and also knowing that Gavin's entire existence depends on his being a lawyer, almost everything he does is utterly illogical.  He leaves the scene of the accident with Doyle Gipson (Samuel L. Jackson) when he could easily have called the court to advise them that he had been in a wreck.  Contrary to how it was portrayed, that hearing could have been rescheduled.  The judge probably would have required some proof of the accident, but that's about it.  Yet he drives off knowing he could go to jail and lose his law license for this.  Nonsense.<p>It gets worse.  He decides to alter financial records, (a felony), so he can blackmail Gipson (a felony) and he LEAVES HIS NAME ON GIPSON'S VOICEMAIL TO TELL HIM THIS?!  As if Gipson would tell no-one and the FBI wouldn't be at his office in 15 minutes to lock him up.<p>That's just the warm-up.  In the course of the next hour, the two of them commit about a dozen felonies between them, and then inexplicably do a 180 degree turn and become the Justice League of America.  I guess this is supposed to erase all the mayhem they caused during the first 90 minutes of the film and make us feel like they are great guys for realizing the errors of their ways.  <p>Samuel Jackson gives another excellent performance rendering the only character that is remotely believable other than Sydney Pollack who is credible as the crooked law partner pulling all the strings.<p>Ben Affleck is awful, but to be fair his character is so moronic that it would be hard for anyone to play this part and not look foolish.  Affleck's biggest mistake was agreeing to take this part in the first place.  Toni Collette and Amanda Peet both come across as gutless whiners.<p>This film is an insult to the audiences' intelligence, not to mention to lawyers in general.  This is not to say that there aren't crooked lawyers, but they are lawyers for heaven's sake; they know the law.  When they break it, they usually do it deviously, not like common street thugs.<p>Other than Jackson's performance, there is not much to recommend this film.  I rated it a 3/10.  Don't waste your time.</p></br><a href="../users/A2Q457CES5ZUZ.html">A2Q457CES5ZUZ</a><br/><p>Director Roger Michell scored big with "Notting Hill," a feel good movie about love in which the unlikely pairing of film superstar Julia Roberts and impoverished book store proprietor Hugh Grant resulted in gloriously unselfish love.  "Changing Lanes" is a drama about greed tugging at the soul of society and how one young man responds, producing another feel good movie of sorts by the film's finale.<p>Ben Affleck is a "What Makes Sammy Run?" style lawyer from New York who at the tender age of 29 has already made it to partner level in the highly successful firm run by his father-in-law, played by prominent director and talented character actor Sydney Pollack.  On his way to court and an important probate hearing for control of the foundation previously headed by a now deceased, wealthy entrepreneur-philanthropist, the young man in a hurry becomes involved in a fender bender with Samuel L. Jackson.<p>The fender bender has a major impact on both drivers.  Jackson, an insurance salesman fighting a battle against alcohol addiction, misses a crucial custody hearing involving his wife and children.  His wife is slated to move to Oregon and seeks to take Jackson's children with her while, through great effort, he has managed to string together a deal for a fixer-upper house, hoping this will keep her in New York and prompt her to drop her divorce action against him.  The accident makes him late for the hearing as full custody is granted to his wife.  He does not get to make his case.<p>Affleck suffers in a different way.  In the mixup following the accident Affleck leaves behind the all-important file containing the signature of the dying philanthropist granting the law firm for which the young lawyer works total control of the foundation's money.  This crucial document ends up in Jackson's hands.<p>When Affleck through happenstance manages to see Jackson on the street and seeks help, the angry insurance salesman lets him know what he thinks of his discourtesy and indifference to his plight, reminding him that he fled the scene of the accident.  When Affleck plays hardball and has Jackson's credit ruined through employing a skilled Internet hacker, his tough adversary fights back on his own terms.<p>After the action has escalated to an accelerated level the two adversaries develop a respect for each other and begin to recognize that in such a situation an ethical solution is the best course for both of them.  <p>Affleck grows up in a hurry, facing the blunt truth that in securing the signature of a dying man no longer in control of his faculties he has engaged in fraud on behalf of the firm.  When he expresses his misgivings to Pollack, he is bluntly told to wise up and do his job.  Pollack states that the philanthropist used some shady methods to acquire his fortune, and that is the way the game is played in the corporate and professional big leagues, in a take no prisoners manner with moral qualms left behind.  To do less is to lose the race.<p>At the film's end Affleck is a changed man who is able to turn the tables on Pollack in a clever manner.  He will no longer be a hired gun who abandons ethical considerations in the pursuit of more money and fame.</p></br><a href="../users/A20ZFWGBY4REFX.html">A20ZFWGBY4REFX</a><br/><p>"Changing Lanes" is a film that is nothing short of being brilliant! The direction of Roger Michell ("Notting Hill") is outstanding! And the top-notch performances from Samuel L. Jackson ("Shaft") and Ben Affleck ("The Sum of All Fears") were played with perfection all the way! The film centers around two men: The first man is Doyle Gipson (Jackson), a recovering alcoholic who tries to pick up the pieces of his once happy marriage and tries to provide for his family by buying a house for them. The other man is Gavin Banek (Affleck), an ambitious high-powered attorney involved in a shady deal with his business partners who are biking a charity. Doyle Gipson and Gavin Banek had no reason to meet...until that fateful day on the freeway. The two men are in a rush to get to their court appointments when a fender bender puts them behind schedule. Banek's rushed handling of the situation, including leaving the scene of the accident saying the words "Better luck next time!", has resulted in Gipson not only being late for his court appointment, but he also lost custody of his kids and it looks like he might not see them again. As for Banek, well, not only is he also late for court, he has also lost a very important file of his...at the scene of the accident...with Doyle Gipson! And not only does this mean that Banek has lost the file, it could also cost him his job and his freedom as well! So what started out as a simple fender bender on the freeway became a conflict between two different men...each with two different agendas...and one with a very important file that the other wants back as soon as possible. And the film goes on from there. "Changing Lanes" is a contemporary American thriller that will keep you on the edge of the seat from start to unforgettable finish! With two of the biggest stars today, a great supporting cast (Toni Collette, William Hurt, Amanda Peet, Sydney Pollack, Richard Jenkins, Kim Staunton), and powerful storytelling, "Changing Lanes" is a must-see for DVD!</p></br><a href="../users/A18CRS4FLVH5YW.html">A18CRS4FLVH5YW</a><br/><p>Ben and Sam goin neck and neck in a game of &quot;who's gonna top who?&quot;  Makes a moviegoer simply salivate at the thought of such a plot.  There is something to be said, however, if you use too much you've spoiled the dish.  This movie exceeds the extremeties at times and makes for a film that will either grab you or send you to the grocery store to look for the newest version of &quot;movie repellent!&quot;  Each scene is carefully structured here and the director of this film certainly knows how to create mood and tension between characters.  What's sad is there is simply too much of these colors swirled in the mix and it tries too hard to envelop the audience.  Sam Jackson portrays (quite brilliantly) a guy who is hit in the face from all sides, making revenge his only mainstay for survival.  Ben Affleck is the top star lawyer who isn't having too good of day either but in reality you know this scenario simply wouldn't and couldn't rightfully happen.  Knowing well that this is a movie, I can buy the idea of watching something a little over the top.  I can handle that and I am sure audiences can handle that but there is a limit to what a movie should do to be a REALLY effective thriller.  This movie unfortunately exceeds on too many levels and goes overboard with too many dramatics and too many things that simply would not happen in real life.  It simply does not suspend disbelief long enough for a person to come down and think about what is really going on here.  One thing really going for this movie, however, is it's superb work as a brilliant character study of survival of the fittest.  I still think this movie should have had a much more sinister and darker ending to rightfully match what we were seeing throughout the film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2582KMXLK2P06.html">A2582KMXLK2P06</a><br/><p>Changing Lanes is about Ben Affleck and Samuel L. Jackson's character getting into a car accident in the middle of a busy, fast-moving freeway. Ben is a lawyer and he's late for a court hearing, meanwhile Samuel has a court hearing himself relating to important matters concerning his family life.<br /><br />They don't exactly end up in the same courtroom however, since I'm sure you're probably believing that's where it's going. Nope!<br /><br />Well, Ben's character being young and impatient, basically says "I'm late for work, goodbye!" after the accident takes place, leaving Samuel's character confused and really angry. Well Ben happens to leave an important file in the possession of Samuel L. Jackson, so Samuel eventually uses that file to get his revenge and make Ben's life a living nightmare after the two of them fail to negotiate in a proper, adult manner.<br /><br />My only gripe with the storyline is that, well for one thing the ending is melodramatic and unmemorable (though to be fair, perhaps the writers were going for something different from the norm, which is a respectable move I suppose).<br /><br />The biggest problem is that the actual nightmare scenarios Samuel puts Ben through isn't NEARLY as intense or as exciting as you're probably hoping for, especially if you've ever watched Samuel's frightening performance in Lakeview Terrace. The same can be said for Ben's revenge against Samuel. Basically the storyline is that Ben and Samuel keep going back and forth at each other trying to one-up the other person in terms of being aggressive and vengeful.<br /><br />But again... the ending. It should have been better. Alright alright, I don't really care about the ending. It was different. Besides that, it's worth your time.</p></br><a href="../users/A1PASRZ81DY9C.html">A1PASRZ81DY9C</a><br/><p>Viewed: 1/08<br />Rate: 6<br /><br />1/08: Changing Lanes is bit of a rocky roller-coaster ride for me, sometimes good and sometimes bad. I went from `7' to `5', then to `8'; then the rating nosedived to `4' before finally settling on `6'. It's not that I didn't like the movie much but rather overwhelmed with too much happenstances that occurred during the film. In a certain way, the events that unfolded in Changing Lanes seemed to be over-the-top for me. The acting is not that bad at all, and I was at the verge of saying, "My dear Ben...you cannot act." before stopping myself, thinking that he was all right yet sleazy and so Ben Affleck-ish. Samuel L. Jackson holds his water. I think Changing Lanes is more of a story-driven film than by performances. Several moments during Changing Lanes seemed to be illogical to me. One particular scene where Gavin Banek pulls the fire alarm, resulting in activation of sprinklers, and goes to the boss' office to pull out a paper from a file cabinet. You know, at that point, the sprinklers are going off, the water is pouring around, and what are the odds that the water will not affect the document that Gavin was reading? Another scene where Gavin's car sees its tire go unhooked seems to be too good to be true. Normally when a car is left ditched, that car shouldn't have remained there for a long period of time. So, when Banek's car crashed, he gets out and walks past by the car. That's another fascinating coincidence. If Roger Michell had focused on two or three twists, Changing Lanes would have been more acceptable, but he decided to push the envelope too far. The ending wasn't all that satisfying for me, and I also got disgusted when Banek came to the school, where the black sons of the father attend, and made up lies about the father. That moment was unsettling and disappointing. Having William Hurt in a cameo appearance was a nice touch. Toni Collette, the lady from Shaft, looks like she is suffering from bone marrow cancer. All for its worth, Changing Lanes came off as a good, although provocative, film but could have been a lot better.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>One more lawyer in one more law firm and one more crooked situation.

The other one loses his case. And then everything goes down because each one will try to pressurize the other into repairing the damage and they will cause even more damage by doing so. The film then is a thriller in a way since we expect any moment more violence and more retribution and more vengeance. Dependence is the worst thing that can hit a man, be it tobacco, alcohol, drugs or plain catastrophe or anti-social reactions. Lawyers are all crooked and perverted and sick in their minds and you can decide to do more good everyday than you do evil, if you are a lawyer you can be sure you will never keep that word. So you better give five dollars to the beggar round the corner in the street: that will probably be the only good action you will do today. Good action? My foot! Since that money is going to enrich a bar tender because the bum is going to drink it. And if you are a mischief maker, a catastrophe bringer, a crash perpetrator, you better stop drinking, stop smoking, stop getting under the influence of anything and retire into some kind of padded monastery or reclusion center for the mentally insane because there is no way you will change and the world will change. So better get used to it and let things go down the chute from bad to worse and then to the worst. Apart from that dark vision of life the film will keep you up for a while, awake too, because of the rather fast rhythm.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGID</p></br><a href="../users/A11PTCZ2FM2547.html">A11PTCZ2FM2547</a><br/><p>Been there, done that.  You have an important event coming up in the day, then something totally unexpected happens to throw you off your game and disorient you, then the next thing you know you're spending the rest of your time fighting uphill.  So I lended a sympathetic eye to the intriguing film CHANGING LANES, when a young attorney (Ben Affleck) on his way to court to file a questionable document at best has a fender bender with an insurance salesman (Samuel L. Jackson) on his way to court to salvage his family and his life.  Once Affleck leaves the scene (and his highly prized document) everything starts to unravel, pitting the two men against each other in ever-increasing altercations of rancor and anger.  Yet as both men find their respective situations spinning out of control, both also learn some very basic things--about themselves.<br /><br />Affleck and Jackson are superb; they're totally and utterly believable as honorable men who find it all too easy to cross the civility line and allow darker thoughts to prevail.  Yet they both show their characters as men with consciences; this dichotomy is riveting to watch.  Compound this with the fact Jackson's character is a recovering alcoholic and the tension becomes even more compelling.  Other noteworthy performances include William Hurt as Jackson's sponsor and the ever-great Sydney Pollack as Affleck's unscrupulous father-in-law and senior law partner.  This is exceptional drama, although at times Jackson is a tad over the top (but name me a performance where he isn't).  CHANGING LANES is like having a whole month of Bad Mondays.<br />--D.

Very smart script here. It builds as each incident combines to gather steam towards a finale that, while predictable, at least comes after some great dialogue by all concerned. No, it's not the least bit credible, if you stop and think about it. But it is a movie after all, so we suspend our cynical views and watch the steamroller go on to conclusion. The end is a little ambiguous. But this movie is about the journey.</p></br><a href="../users/A3PCTD8QM1BIXI.html">A3PCTD8QM1BIXI</a><br/><p>Channging Lanes is one of few films that can start out great and then have a crappy enidng.

The screenplay by first timer Chap Taylor is also very good however I do wish that the ending that was originally involved Ben Affleck and Samuel L.

After seeing the movie I truly could not understand why this movie did not make a splash. I never even heard of it until I saw it at the rentals. The movie basically has Ben Affleck playing a hotshot lawyer who on his way to a very important court case has a small accident with Samuel L Jackson who was on his way to the court as well to appear for his child custody case. Ben offers a blank check to Samuel citing he has to be some place and thus does not have the time to check and share insurance information. When Samuel does not accept the blank check and says he wants to do this the right way, Ben  leaves the scene leaving Sam stranded without a ride. Samuel cries out to Ben for a ride and not to leave him there stranded. Ben disregards this and is off. Back at the court, Ben realises when he is arguing the case, that he can't produce a very important document (a power of appointment) given by a deceased client of the firm which gave Ben's law firm the power to be trustees and caretaker of the money left behind by the deceased guy. He realises he must have dropped it at the accident site  (which Sam has picked up as good samaritan despite the harsh treatment he was given by Ben Affleck). Sam, due to the accident delay and due to not getting a timely ride to the court reaches late and as a result looses his right to say his piece before the judge and looses custody of the children. Ben then tries to get the power of appointment from Samuel. Being enraged on Ben for stranding him and thereby making him loose his childeren's custody, he refuses to return the document that Ben needs. Ben then uses the services of a guy who does network hacking jobs and gets Samuel's credit turned off. Sam thus gets refused a loan which he needed desperately to buy a house with, to persuade his estranged wife to live with him so he can be close to the childeren. Samuel now gets further enraged and then makes it a mission to make life tough for Ben. Samuel tears up certain parts of power of appointment, threatens to destroy the book if the credit is not turned on. Ben tries to get it turned back but the hacker guy is not able to reverse it, Samuel is further enraged and sabotages Ben's car by loosening the wheels. Ben nearly gets killed. This draws a response from Ben. Ben then calls Samuel Saying his boys have been kidnapped while informing the School that an unstable man will try to run away with this childern. A Distraught Samuel goes to the School in concern for his children which is misread by the School as a father who is trying to kidnap his children. So right from the accident, it's a case of Ben and Sam one-upping each other and trying to view the other with harmful intent and each end up doing things that they would otherwise normally not do. It basically showcases the depths to which a normal noble law abiding logical person can sink to and how easily in a second he can chose to give up the very moral fibre by which he lived his life all along and how this can be brought about by a single seemingly unimportant incident which can have meaningful negative consequences for a person. This is a film about the fine line that we tread between leading our lives with the moral code or making an exception and sometimes doing the immoral thing. I believe each of us who see this movie can relate to this movie because  no one can claim to be saint. We all in our past, be it small instances and incidences, have made some choices which we saw as right and just and correct in the heat of the moment but when the spite and anger over the situation passes we find ourselves questioning our very own actions which we thought were justifiable and correct beyond a shadow of doubt at an earlier point in time.<br /><br />regards, Vikram</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>Ben Affleck as Gavin is introduced by giving a eulogized speech on a recently deceased millionaire who has donated money to charities in great amounts.  Affleck is an attorney who is facing charges that the will stipulating that his law firm handle this charitable donation is not valid.<br />Samuel L. Jackson is Doyle Gipson, an alcoholic attending AA classes shephereded by William Hurt.  He is also in a brutal custody battle for his two children, and has applied for a loan to buy a house to keep his wife from taking his boys to Oregon.<br />Both men are on their way to the courthouse when inattention on both drivers' parts results in a fender-bender.  Affleck offers a blank check to Jackson for the damages, but Jackson wants to do it the right way, refusing the check.  Affleck blows him off as he must get to the courtroom to present his documentation.  He leaves Jackson stranded, along with the document of assignment that he dropped out of his briefcase.  Jackson finds the document and takes off with it to court.  Ironically, both men were going to the same courthouse and had Affleck offered Jackson a ride, fate would have turned out differently.<br />From this point on, it is a desperate game of payback and lies as Affleck tries to get the document back.  He arranges for a computer geek to &quot;bankrupt&quot; Jackson and Jackson loses everything; it also appears that Affleck may lose it all, too.<br />CHANGING LANES is a dark, yet ultimately, rewarding experience. Jackson plays against type; Ben Affleck shows a lot of maturity in his performance, and they have a strong supporting cast in Richard Jenkins, Sydney Pollack and Toni Collette.<br />CHANGING LANES shows how a quick, irresponsible action can make a drastic change in one's life.<br />Compelling and well done.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZS82R4RC0I2N.html">A1ZS82R4RC0I2N</a><br/><p>This engaging, clever thriller is in fact a morality tale that shows the importance of tolerance, patience and respect in today`s society. Although this may sound preachy, the movie is actually quite compelling and consistent, showcasing the darker side of an average person. Ben Affleck and Samuel Jackson give convincing performances as the two antagonists who have a car accident in a morning. Problem is, that little accident will lead to a twisted, troubled day where a revenge process builds a road to insanity and despair. Director Roger Michell knows how to build tension and suspense, delivering a tight social thriller after his previous and unengaging work in "Notting Hill". Sometimes the mood and atmosphere comes close to that of a David Fincher movie, discussing urban paranoia and the anger it generates. Unfortunately, the predictable ending steals some of the impact of the picture, approaching a typical Hollywood resolution. Still, "Changing Lanes" is a very well-crafted movie and one of the more intriguing surprises of 2002.</p></br><a href="../users/A1YQ6QB2127AJ4.html">A1YQ6QB2127AJ4</a><br/><p>This is a great edge-of-your-seat movie filled with darkness and drama.  It has a creative storyline, though the level and frequency of events seem unrealistic.  It still fits the production.  It explores one day in the life of two revengeful men who meet in a freeway after their cars crash one another.  Once Ben Affleck's character says "better luck next time", the thrills begin and don't end until the movie's end.  Samuel L. Jackson wonderfully plays his nemesis.  The other issues involved, including attempted adultry, alcoholism, child care, etc., are expressed wonderfully by every actor.  "Changing Lanes" is a great movie for those who like unique and unpredictable plots.</p></br><a href="../users/APOGXH3A74CM3.html">APOGXH3A74CM3</a><br/><p>As the title suggests, drivers change lanes.

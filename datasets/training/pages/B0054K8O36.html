One of the "shill" critics said it was the best of the series -- and there's a big grain of truth in that.<br /><br />"PotC2" and "PotC3" -- regardless of their merits as stories -- were plot-heavy. That there were three groups with differing, conflicting goals -- which were never particularly clear -- didn't help one's enjoyment.<br /><br />"PotC4" has a clearer and less-baroque storyline. There are still three groups, but we know what two of them are doing, and why. (The Spaniards' motive isn't revealed until the end, and it's a real -- and highly logical -- surprise.)<br /><br />Johnny Depp is back to playing the (relatively) more-sober and less-overtly flamboyant Captain Jack of the first film, a major plus. (Don't forget that he got an Oscar nomination for that performance. A best-actor nomination for fantasy, sci-fi, horror, or action roles is almost unheard-of. *)<br /><br />The first two-thirds are extremely funny, but the story turns uncharacteristically (for this series) dark towards the end, becoming a kind of "Splash Meets Jaws". Also uncharacteristically, the story (semi-)seriously examines issues of morality and redemption. The ending is startlingly misogynistic -- which is not surprising behavior for pirates.<br /><br />If I have any generic complaint about the series as a whole, it's that there are no //really good// sword fights. This is probably for practical reasons -- none of the stories builds to a sword-fighting climax (as "The Adventures of Robin Hood" and "Rob Roy" do), so there's no point in training the actors. The days of Errol Flynn and Basil Rathbone are long gone.<br /><br />The PG-13 rating is justified -- this is not a film for the youngsters. (I seriously question the ethics of LEGO's marketing products based specifically on this film.)<br /><br />I really enjoyed "On Stranger Tides", when I didn't expect to. I can't guarantee anything, but if you liked the first one, you'll probably like the last.<br /><br />* Frederic March got an Oscar for "Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde", and Anthony Hopkins got an (undeserved) Oscar for "The Silence of the Lambs".</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>Currently a captain without a ship - the Black Pearl having been shrunk and placed inside a sealed bottle, at least for the time being - the inimitable Jack Sparrow finds himself impressed on a vessel, captained by the Spanish pirate Blackbeard (Ian McShane), that is hot on the trail of Ponce de Leon's famed but ever elusive Fountain of Youth. Meanwhile, a British contingent, led by peg-legged "privateer, not pirate" Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), is on the same mission, though he claims to be doing it not for personal enrichment but for king and country.<br /><br />"Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," with a screenplay by Ted Elliott and Terry Rosio and direction by Rob Marshall, keeps the storyline fairly simple and streamlined this time out, avoiding the overstuffed, convoluted plotting that often made the earlier installments all but impossible to follow. Even Johnny Depp himself, in the spirit of the enterprise, seems to have toned down some of the more flamboyant qualities of his earlier performances and appears to be relishing playing a pirate who is less in charge of his own fate and more at the mercy of the other characters this time around. Yet, he's still able to land a sharp-tongued barb with the best of them, whether it be against Blackbeard, Barbossa or Angelica, the feisty love interest played by the beautiful Penelope Cruz.<br /><br />As is par for the course, the movie runs on far too long, padding out its length with a sappy romance between a preacher-man and a mermaid and a few too many distended swordfights for the movie's (and the audience's) good, but, overall, this turns out to be one of the less top-heavy and heavy-handed of the "Pirates" films.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GPN2VKS8E77C.html">A2GPN2VKS8E77C</a><br/><p>Note: I saw this movie with XFinity On Demand.<br /><br />Thus far in my travels with the Pirates Of The Caribbean, I've experienced The Curse Of The Black Pearl, opened the Dead Man's Chest, and sailed the weird and haunted shores At World's End. So, when the opportunity arose for me to set sail once again On Stranger Tides, how could I resist? Personally, I enjoy all three previous entries in the series, with my only complaint being that there are no deleted scenes on the DVD of Dead Man's Chest (some scenes were filmed, but ultimately cut; I think it's always nice to include deleted scenes from a movie and know why they were excised, as some think the scenes were absolutely neccessary whlle others might might not, but enjoy seeing them nonetheless), and only two deleted scenes were included on the DVD of At World's End (I know that twenty minutes worth of footage was cut from the film, including a scene where Admiral Norrington tries to persuade Governor Swann from killing Davy Jones, and for some reason, those twenty minutes were not included on the DVD as deleted or extended scenes). But I digress.<br /><br />This latest voyage with the Pirates Of The Caribbean is another gold mine for Walt Disney Pictures. The twists keep on coming, there's still action & romance a-plenty, and of course, a dash of rougish charm. Captain Jack is back, and this time, he's joined by yet another lovely young lady who is easy on the eyes (as well as a good actress), and Barbossa has apparently switched sides. As with the previous films, the plot is very engaging, and you're never bored for a moment. The score is excellent, remeniscent of the first three movies while incorporating new themes as well.<br /><br />Biblically speaking, there is barely any offensive content, as is usual with Disney films, and consistent with the previous three movies. There is violence, but as expected, it is never graphic and mostly bloodless. There's one moderate imprecation used (during the film's climax), but it's appropriate, given the situation. And of course, there is the innuendo, but given that it's a pirate film, but a Disney movie at heart, it's always light and humorous. I admit, I had my reservations about the mermaids when I saw the trailer (I thought, "Do they HAVE to be topless? This is a DISNEY movie.") As it turns out, my reservations were unnecessary, as the screenwriters and director were discreet in filming the scenes with the mermaids. Nothing is shown. There is a Christian missionary in the film, and he is portrayed in a positive light, unusual for a non-Christian movie, but of course very commendable. Though he IS on the receiving end of some light-hearted quips, his calling is never disrespected, and as per the previous movies, God's name is never taken in vain. (It's a Disney film, and with the disappointing exception of the recently released John Carter, which I have not seen, Disney has respected the Name of God, at least when it comes to their movies; in television, that's another story). SPOILER ALERT!!! As in the previous entries, Jack sacrifices his own selfish desire to do what he knows in his heart is the right thing to do. SPOILER ALERT OVER!!! I highly recommend that you accept this latest invitation to sail with the Pirates Of The Caribbean: On Stranger Tides.<br /><br />I think the film could have been rated PG.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ01Q3070LT29.html">AQ01Q3070LT29</a><br/><p>I watched this on Amazon.com Instant Video using my Amazon gift e-card balance. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005W6UT1W">Pirates Of The Caribbean: On Stranger Tides</a><br /><br />Running Time: 2 hours, 17 mins.

Indiana Jones. Die Hard. Rambo. Scream. All of varying worth. Many critics say that these long running franchises returning for a 4th film never live up to the hype or to the series they are a part of. Well, 'Pirates 4' comes along to change all that. It is a sequel, coming 4 years after the last one(which is like 10 years in this generation where last week is old), it is a part 4, and it's wonderful. Critics say otherwise, but this is one movie where the audience has spoken, and they are loving it.<br /><br />I could go into the story, but why bother? By now, everyone should know that Capt. Jack Sparrow(Johnny Depp)is back, and he is journeying to the famed fountain of youth, along with old foe Barbarossa(the great Geoffrey Rush), evil Pirate Blackbeard(the even better Ian McShane), and old flame Angelica(Penelope Cruz) who may or may not be Blackbeard's daughter. Along the way, our characters run across exciting adventures and scary mermaids.<br /><br />First of all, people and critics were quite vocal on how the two sequels were too complicated, over-stuffed, and confusing. Thankfully, this latest adventure simplifies the material in a way that harkens back to the wonderful, and now classic, original 2003 film. There is now B and C storylines to dampen down the festivities. Everything is pretty simple and crystal clear and easy to follow along. In fact, the whole movie has such a refreshing air to it, that it really does go back to the original. The immense charm of the original film with Depp's Sparrow and humor is here in full force. The magic is there. The fun time, popcorn blockbuster is there. Part 3 was disappointing and was missing most of this, but it's here in spades with part 4. Also in abundance is the action. Part 3 was so long that the action felt few and far between. Here, there is plenty of action. The movie never slows down and is never boring. Ever. New director Rob Marshall keeps things moving at a fun and brisk pace. It's continuously watchable and gorgeous, like all the others, to look at. It is, without a doubt, the most fun and entertaining movie in the franchise since the first one.<br /><br />The cast is great. Johnny Depp is these movies. People come to see him in this role and he doesn't disappoint in this one. He seems more alive, lively, refrshed, and as amusing as ever. Elsewhere, you will be wondering "Orlando and Keira who?" You won't miss them. Penelope Cruz holds her own as Angelica. Rush is as great as he always is in the other films. And then there is Ian McShane. He is just cool. Blackbeard is a character to be reckoned with, and McShane is so evil and icy cool, that he owns every scene he is in. There are new characters littered throughout the film, but none of them really bring much. I will say though, that the actrss who plays Serena the mermaid, and I don't remember her name, may be one of the loveliest beauties I have seen on the silver screen in some time.<br /><br />The critics have not been kind. Some have been downright savage, and I cannot understand why. The audienc I saw it with clapped at the end. "On Stranger Tides" may not be so strange, but it delivers what everyone wants and hopes for in a Pirate's movie. Easily the best of the sequels, the movie is great fun. It has a new zest of life and has a sharp script filled with rousing action, some great dialogue, and some great humor.  What more can you ask for? I am a huge fan of the franchise. Part 3 was not what everyone wanted, but "On Stranger Tides" does a great job of steering this mighty franchise back on course. Part 5 cannot come fast enough!</p></br><a href="../users/A2FRKEXDXDN1KI.html">A2FRKEXDXDN1KI</a><br/><p>If there is one thing that is consistent with "Pirates of the Caribbean", you know that this film will make a ton of money in the box office.<br /><br />And while many thought that the "Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End" was finished with the third film in the trilogy, "At World's End" would be the last we would see of Jack Sparrow.  But the truth is, that no matter how film critics have shown their declining interest in the film, the audience have not.<br /><br />And with the release of the fourth film "Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides", once again, the audience have shown their love for this film as it became the 8th highest grossing film of all time (worldwide), the third highest grossing film of 2011 and following "Dead Man's Chest" and "Toy Story 3', the third highest grossing film for Disney.  The film  which cost anywhere between $150-$250 million to make, earned over $1 billion in the box office.<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />"Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1).  And as one can expect from Disney, the picture quality is fantastic.  The majority of the film is shot outdoors, at sea or during day or night and for the most part, detail is high, skin tones are natural and blacks are deep and inky.<br /><br />And once again, cinematographer Dariusz Wolski should receive credit for his spectacular cinematography, from the "Pirates of the Caribbean" films to "Alice in Wonderland", Wolski is an expert in shooting in the darkest of scenes, underwater, in smoke and chaotic sequences and there is no artifacts, banding or any problematic situations in the picture quality at all.<br /><br />Overall, "On Stranger Tides" is a fantastic looking film and looks absolutely wonderful on Blu-ray!<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />What best than to present this film with a lossless English, French and Spanish 7.1 DTS-HD HR presentation.  The surround channels are heavily used in Hans Zimmer's wonderful score to the swordfights, the sound of boots walking on the deck, the sound of blasts, the growl of the mermaids and scenery ambiance, and throughout all this immersive sound, dialogue is crystal clear and understandable.<br /><br />The LFE for the film is wonderful and like the wonderful picture quality of the film, the lossless audio soundtrack is also fantastic!<br /><br />Subtitles are presented in English SDH, French and Spanish.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES<br /><br />"Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides" comes with the following special features:<br /><br />  Disney Second Screen - Viewers can watch the film simultaneously through their iPad or computer.<br />  Disney Second Screen Bloopers of the Caribbean - (3:25) Outtakes rom the making of "Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides".<br />  Audio Commentary - Featuring audio commentary by director Rob Marshall and executive producer John DeLuca discuss the cast members, the making of the film and its challenges during production and more.<br />  LEGO Animated Shorts: Captain Jack's Brick Tales - (5:19) Featuring five Lego animated shorts for "Captain Jack's Brick Tales".<br /><br />EXTRAS:<br />"Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides" comes with a slip cover case. The Blu-ray release comes with the DVD presented in widescreen 2:40:1 - Enhanced for 16?9 televisions, English, French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital, English DVS 2.0 Dolby Digital and subtitles in English SDH, French and Spanish.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />When it comes to popcorn action films "Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides" manages to incorporate the fun, swashbuckling action of Jack Sparrow and Johnny Depp does a wonderful job of playing Jack Sparrow.  But one's enjoyment is subjective, especially whether or not you have felt that your passion for the film series is starting to wane a bit.<br /><br />After the third "Pirates of the Caribbean" film, I have to say that "At World's End" left me feeling bitter because it was not a great film to end the trilogy.  But because these films make a tremendous amount of money, there is no way that we are going to see an end to this film series.  In fact, a fifth film is being planned and Johnny Depp is returning, so as long as the audience continues to come out to see the films, I don't see why Disney should stop.  People still love "Pirates of the Caribbean".<br /><br />Personally, I enjoyed the film but unlike previous "Pirates of the Caribbean" films, it felt a bit light when it came to Jack Sparrow because there is so much emphasis on other characters.  In fact, I found myself enjoying scenes with the Christian Philip  (played by Sam Claflin)and the mermaid Syrena (played by Astrid Berges-Frisbey), which for me was the replacement characters for Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann (Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley's characters for the previous films).  But unfortunately, where Turner and Swann had staying power for three films, not sure if we are going to see Philip or Syrena ever again.<br /><br />While "On Stranger Tides" continues to be a fun, adventurous popcorn action film, I did enjoy seeing Penelope Cruz playing the character of Angelica Teach, a compassionate/cutthroat ex-lover of Jack Sparrow and Ian McShane as the legendary dark pirate Blackbeard was quite fun to watch as well.  And seeing Barbosa, it was no surprise to see his return to the film as well.<br /><br />But "On Stranger Tides" tries to showcase many other characters as well and truth be told, aside from Gibbs who has a place in the PotC films, everyone else didn't.  For example, in the first film, there was a sympathetic feeling towards Sparrow and his crew, but this time around, you really had no sympathy for anyone's crew.  If anything, you just wondered when will Jack Sparrow be back on his ship instead of being Indiana Jones/Blackbeard's grunt.  This is one side of Jack Sparrow that we have not seen in previous films and I'm not sure if I like him in such a non-commanding role.<br /><br />But however one feels about "On Stranger Tides", similar to films like "Transformers", these are popcorn action films that people come to see and have a good time, not for anything deep or mind-blowing.  You get action and a ton of special effects and in that sense, "On Stranger Tides" does not disappoint.<br /><br />But when it comes to this Blu-ray release, one thing that does disappoint is the fact that we are getting far less than the five disc version when it comes to special features.  Picture and lossless audio is fantastic but I was surprised to see only three special features including the audio commentary included with this release.  But it appears that Disney really is pushing for the 3D 5-disc version which has nine special features over its 2-disc counterpart which has only three minus the second screen.<br /><br />Overall, "Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides" is a fun film and from the crew fight on the Queen Anne's Revenge, Jack Sparrow's escape from British custody to the encounter with the mermaids, there are many fun action scenes in this film.  But in terms of story, I still prefer the first original film, but there is no doubt that the visuals and overall production design is much improved in this latest film.<br /><br />If you are a fan of the series and own the trilogy on Blu-ray, or you are just a big fan of the film or its talent, you're definitely going to want this film in your collection.  But if you are wanting the best version of this film released on Blu-ray, you may want to look into the 5-disc version over this 2-disc combo pack as Disney chose to include most of the bonus features on the 5-disc release.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X1CEGHTHMBL1.html">A1X1CEGHTHMBL1</a><br/><p>Fishermen pull a body from the sea and it comes alive.  They take him to the king of Spain and the man talks of the Fountain of Youth and Ponce De Leon.  Meanwhile Captain Jack Sparrow is on trial and he escapes and is captured again and taken to the king of England who wants to know the secrets and location of the Fountain of Youth. At the same time, an imposter Jack Sparrow is recruiting for a crew to go look for the Fountain of Youth but the real captain is Blackbeard and his daughter.  So now we have three competing groups of people searching for and seeking the benefits of the same prize.<br /><br />While this movie had some good spots and lots of action I actually found it boring at times.  Too many scenes were just dark and foggy and walking through the forest or swamp at night.  I also found the dialog to be too overdone and frankly not interesting.  The action scenes were great but they were separated with dull script and dark scenes.  Only Captain Jack Sparrow is the star in this movie and Penelope Cruz as Angelica just didn't do a great job.  Geoffrey Rush playing Captain Hector Barbossa was the pirate leading the English expedition in this movie and his role was fairly good as well as Ian McShane who played Blackbeard.<br /><br />Over all the movie was Jack escapes, Jack is captured, Jack changes teams, Jack escapes, Jack is captured, Jack changes teams, over and over and over!  For the limited plot the movie just seemed too long.  I would rate this 5 stars as the special effects were good and Jack's escape scenes were funny but this edition of the movie series just doesn't expand the characters and the story was to repetitious of the first three movies.  This movie needed one other super character to stand out and it did not happen for me and the script should have stayed livelier.  It sadly drops to 3 stars because of its shortcomings!</p></br><a href="../users/AHL35XZ3OND2Z.html">AHL35XZ3OND2Z</a><br/><p>I'm not going to pass this off as Best Picture, but I dragged into this fearing the worst.<br /><br />Stranger Tides turned out to be alright.  There is a somewhat coherent storyline and the annoying Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightly are long gone.  I think when you're in the mood for something dumb but sorta fun, this is the type of movie you want to see.  The Blu-Ray looks great, sounds even better.  The image is a tad soft (shot on digital) compared to the first Pirates - which was tack sharp, but nothing to be ashamed of.<br /><br />Look, if the last two movies in the series never would have been made and this would have been the real Pirates sequel, it would be much higher rated.  It really is a huge improvement on Dead Man's Chest and World's End.  Those movies were genuinely awful.  This is harmless fun.</p></br><a href="../users/A2W2ODLRQ2L8LE.html">A2W2ODLRQ2L8LE</a><br/><p>This film is a another very well placed original installment in the Pirates of the Caribbean series. There is a nice mix of humor, surprises, tension and adventure all nicely wrapped together.<br /><br />The storyline has been well constructed, and there are numerous twists and turns to keep you on the edge of your seat, and to ensure that you won't be easily able to guess what is going to happen next.<br /><br />In my opinion, this movie is just about on par with the previous films, so if you liked the other Pirates of the Caribbean movies, you will surely enjoy this one as well.</p></br><a href="../users/AV6QDP8Q0ONK4.html">AV6QDP8Q0ONK4</a><br/><p>The film starts out with ominous music. An old sailor is discovered who was once on a ship that was looking for the Fountain of Youth...200 years ago! This sets off a frenzy to look for the Fountain. You would think without Orlando and Keira, the movie would be a bust. What I missed more than those two stars were the minor actors who played the crew. They were colorful characters who we have come to know. Alas, except for a few, they're  gone. The action is the same: sword fights, impossible escapes, humorous dialouge, and unexpected turns. We get to meet Jack's father and Angelica Malon (Pen&eacute;lope Cruz) the later of which Jack supposedly deflowered right before she was getting ready to take her vowels in a Spanish convent. No surprise there.<br /><br />Now in order to use the Fountain of Youth, there must be a ritual. We discover early on the ritual requires two silver chalices and a mermaid's tear. We also discover that the Black Pearl has been sunk and Hector is working for the crown. Through a series of events, Jack becomes Shanghaied on Black Beard's (Ian McShane) ship. We have 3 groups after the Fountain, the Spanish, the English who have Gibbs who has memorized the map, and Blackbeard. While Jack is in the hold, Angelica is Black Beard's first mate having convinced him she is his long lost daughter. As always in these movies everyone has their own ideas, desires, and shifting alliances.<br /><br />The group must go on these quests to gather the items before going to the Fountain. (I see an RPG in the making.)<br /><br />The silver chalices are not just any 2 silver chalices but the ones that belonged to Ponce De Leon.<br /><br />The mermaids have the beauty and allure of a Siren, but when they attack they have super-human strength and vampire teeth, making their capture a bit tricky and deadly. I fell in love with the doll face of the first mermaid (Gemma Ward who actually plays a character called Dollface in "The Strangers".) I know this is a Disney movie and this should go without saying...The mermaids are indeed topless, but the camera angles, hair and arm placements prevent any kind of "R" view. There might be a parent or two concerned due to some of the photos that are out there.<br /><br />One piece of dialouge:<br /><br />Jack: "You lied to me by telling me the truth?"<br /><br />Angelica: "Yes."<br /><br />Jack: "That's very good. I'll have to use that."<br /><br />Good View on the big screen. Lacks the ornate special effects of the other 3 movies as well as many of the characters. It appears they did this on less of a budget in order to get a larger net return.  4 1/2 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A27P0MW8TE1JQP.html">A27P0MW8TE1JQP</a><br/><p>Can't say I miss any of the absent original cast members... Johnny Depp is so perfect as Capt. Jack Sparrow you likely won't notice either. Although Geoffrey Rush returns as Capt. Barbossa as well as Sparrow's first-mate. This time Jack is searching for the Fountain of youth. Ian McShane (of Deadwood is electric as BlackBeard. Penelope Cruz is mostly forgettable , the mermaids may have the uppper hand for on screen female presence. I certainly enjoyed it more than the last movie of the film series. The ending is painfully predictable, but it made infinitely more sence than the last two... Although clearly every pirate in the Disney Universe is packing magic and zombies.. I can't wait to see how they supe-up Long John Silver in Pirates V.</p></br><a href="../users/A2A6NH6DPE0VXR.html">A2A6NH6DPE0VXR</a><br/><p>Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is back and now looking for the fountain of youth. Sparrow isn't alone on that journey though, because Black Beard (Ian McShane) and Barbosa (Geoffrey Rush) are also looking for the fountain. Jack finds himself, a prisoner of Black Beard and the former love of his life Angelica Malon (Penelope Cruz), who just might be Black Beard's long lost daughter.<br />  Depp has already signed on for more sequels, that's how much he loves playing Jack Sparrow, but before he puts on the eye liner again, he needs a script that's worthy to him and the character. The last 2 sequels would have been better if they were a lot shorter and if the stories weren't so confusing with too many double crosses.<br />  On Stranger Tides has a story you can wrap your brain around and makes a good adventure/fantasy due to having zombies and dangerous mermaids and etc, but Jack Sparrow is too heroic this time around, which is pretty out of character. Despite being the main star, Sparrow also feels as if he's just on the outside looking in through a lot of the film as well. While Ian McShane, is well cast as Black Beard but is the weakest villain of the films due to being pretty under-used and not as threatening as Davy Jones or Barbosa.<br />  While the film would have felt more alive and memorable if the original director, Gore Verbinski came back. Rob Mashall tried hard with this film, but Verbinksi's films were at least great to look at with well shot sword fights and ship battles. After the first film blew me away, I never felt as if any of the sequels lived up to their potential though and On Stranger Tides is no exception. It kind of just floats along until it's time to get to the fountain of youth, so thank god it wasn't almost 3 hours. I really hope, they at least try harder to give us a film as good as the first with part 5.</p></br><a href="../users/A1YB29BIDULEYE.html">A1YB29BIDULEYE</a><br/><p>Giving you a brief rundown of where I stand, I didn't much like 1. (2 stars) I thought 2 was A LOT BETTER. (4.5 stars) And I thought 3 was better still. (5 stars)<br /><br />I would have been happy to 3 end the saga. But I suppose a mediocre 4th film is better than none at all.<br /><br />Depp and Mr. Gibbs find themselves on the run again, and are captured and forced into the service of King George II. Rush seems to have found his way into a safer job in the service of King George II. (For the record, King George II was the last king to lead troops into battle, and was known for his bravery.)<br /><br />To make a long story short, Depp escapes, but Gibbs is caught and Rush forces Gibbs into his service to find the fountain of youth. And later, Depp is forced into the service of Black Beard to find the fountain of youth as well.<br /><br />Ian McShane as Black Beard had a very difficult (if not impossible) hand dealt to him. This film is dealing with the loss of Orlando Bloom, Kiera Knightley, Pintel, Rhagetti, James Norrington, Tia Dalma, and Davy Jones. McShane had the difficult task of  filling the shoes of Davy Jones. But in all honesty, he really did the best he could with the bad hand he was dealt. It is interesting that he played Judas Iscariot in "Jesus of Nazareth" (1977). This gives a real chilling irony when he talks to the young and untainted religious man: "Do you want to know when I think of God? When I see suffering, pain, and anguish." Also when he comments on how some souls are doomed and don't have the luxury of choosing their fate. This is an irony only someone who had played Judas Iscariot could have given. As someone who remembers him as Judas Iscariot (and thus having been close to Jesus and exposed to his teachings), one moment I found especially powerful in a dark way was when he told the young and untainted religious man: "Well, here's the chance to prove the worth and powers of your prayers. Pray that he may be delivered from...evil?"<br /><br />You'll probably notice that the film drags more than 2 or 3. It does appear at times they were trying to make Rush evil again. But it really doesn't work to do that. Once a villain makes it to a 3d gray character, you really can't push him back to a 2d villain.<br /><br />Cruz is an interesting character in that she appears to be a villain, but we are allowed sympathy for her in that she was an almost nun who Depp corrupted. And she does love her father. Funny that she plays a former almost nun, and the actor who is her father had played Judas Iscariot. I should probably add that he played Judas in the most tragic and sympathetic way possible.<br /><br />The final fight lacks the fun energy of 2 and 3. But it's decent all things considered. There are some Shakespeare techniques as well. Like Laertes, Rush kills with a poisoned sword. (from "Hamlet")  Cruz's final pleas to Depp are not unlike Joan of Arc's final pleas in (1 "Henry VI"). And Black Beard has a Macbeth moment when he knows he will probably lose, but bravely fights.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed it better than 1. But not as much as 2 or 3.<br /><br />But it was nice to see Depp, Gibbs, and Rush again. And I do applaud Ian McShane for doing the best he could with a difficult hand. He provided an irony only someone who had played Judas Iscariot could have.<br /><br />If you're a major POC fan, you will of course want to add this to your collection. If you're only a so so fan, I suggest you borrow it before you buy.</p></br><a href="../users/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z.html">AEQFYOI6YJ83Z</a><br/><p>He's baaaaaaaack!  The first PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN movie introduced Johnny Depp to a much, much wider audience; as Captain Jack Sparrow, he was a wonder, cracking wise and kicking butt (often at the same time).  CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL remains a family-friendly action/adventure classic.  It's sequels...eh.<br /><br />ON STRANGER TIDES makes no sense.  Okay?  Should this surprise you...you're in the wrong genre, my friend.  It's big and bold (though not nearly as much as its two predecessors, thank God), features some mediocre acting (Depp and Geoffrey Rush remain strong, and Ian McShane is fantastic even though his character is crudely drawn), a few genuine laughs, a few false laughs, a few failed bits of choreography, and a whole lot of fun.  Maybe not as much fun as back at the beginning, when all of this was new, but you'll still enjoy yourself...probably.<br /><br />The plot?  Something to do with Blackbeard (McShane), his daughter (Penelope Cruz; finally, a strong female character, or at least a strong female actress); Captain Barbosa (Rush) as a British emissary; a shirtless priest who falls in love with a mermaid (you think I'm joking, but I'm not); the fountain of youth; and a bunch of good pirates and evil British guys.  Oh, and Keith Richards.  Rock on.<br /><br />If I sound sarcastic, it's because you just can't take this movie seriously, not even on its own terms.  But trust me: ON STRANGER TIDES is, at the very least, a fun movie (note the three stars).  Jack Sparrow is getting rather tired (I would much rather watch the first film on repeat), but Depp still has enough charisma to breathe a little bit more life into him.  If nothing else, the visuals remain spectacular, the plot interesting enough for us to forgive the fact that it is so full of holes an elephant could waltz right through it, and the pirates still delightfully funny (I'd love to see the "realistic" version of this film...well, maybe not).  It could stand to be a little darker and scarier (the mermaid premise, as awful as it originally comes across, actually had some promise), but we're willing to settle for what it is.  And that, at least, is worth a viewing or two.</p></br><a href="../users/A28MM46KI4EQB2.html">A28MM46KI4EQB2</a><br/><p>Though I liked some of the earlier ones just a little bit better, this installment of the Pirates series is still pretty awesome. I love these movies! I have the original trilogy on Blu-Ray, and will be adding this one to the collection as well!</p></br><a href="../users/A1C58YXM2A30CY.html">A1C58YXM2A30CY</a><br/><p>[This review is the theatrical release.]<br /><br />With a mix of historical fact, some mythology and lots of suspension of disbelief, I enjoyed watching Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides.<br /><br />Themes & Plot:<br /><br />I like how the movie starts out with an imposter Jack Sparrow, rumors of putting a crew together and various secret plans and maps to find Ponce de Leon's fountain of youth.  The problem with the fountain is that you steal another's life and gain their years.  It's not a simple matter of taking a drink.<br /><br />Interesting myth-making here.  The tear from a mermaid, two silver goblets and a victim.  Piece of cake!<br /><br />The character driven story was much more involved than the special effects CGI-fest of the past films.  I was a bit surprised at the rocky Florida coast and lighthouse castle (rocky coasts in Florida??) and enjoyed the pirates Blackbeard and the one-legged pirate played by Ian McShane.  Penelope Cruz as the sexy pirate was also fun to watch - but really, I doubt women at the time were ever permitted onboard these vessels as officers, much less there at all!<br /><br />The life aboard ship was antiseptic as is expected from a Disney film.  The "zombie-fied" slavers whipping the boys into shape, the sexy but deadly mermaids and the various subplots, such as the romance between mermaid and minister - made for a well-paced film.<br /><br />There are a few slow points and that's why a four rather than a five star film.  The acting was well-done, the special effects were good without being overdone, and the discoveries of various creatures and activities was interesting as well as the supernatural.<br /><br />The Spanish explorers were into destroying what they considered pagan or supernatural, which is in conformance with their historical voyages of destruction of the native peoples' cultures in this area.<br /><br />Bottom Line:  More character driven than the others; recaptured for me the pacing and the art of telling a story that the first film had.  Johnny Depp and Penelope Cruz make a great couple.  And the in-credits scene opens the door for yet another sequel!<br /><br />Other Pirate Films in the Series:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004D8P230">Pirates of the Caribbean Trilogy (Seven-Disc Blu-ray)</a></p></br><a href="../users/AUEHG0DB54B7K.html">AUEHG0DB54B7K</a><br/><p>After reading several negative reviews about Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, I had small expectations when I went to see the film.  In my point-of-view, the critics are dead wrong.  One of the critical objections that I looked for was a lack of "chemistry" between Johnny Depp and Penelope Cruz. I don't know what the critic thought was missing but considering that neither Jack Sparrow nor Angelica can afford to trust the other, their performances were spot on.  I also cannot agree that Johnny Depp's performance was lacking anything; his performance had the freshness of the first film in the series.<br /><br />On Stranger Tides is an entertaining movie with an excellent story that has several interesting twists and turns (some minor spoilers follow). The opening of the film finds Gibbs (perfectly played once again by Kevin McNally) on trial for being mistaken as Captain Jack Sparrow only to be saved by Sparrow impersonating a judge.  The elaborate escape that follows, with plenty of excellent stunt work (including a cameo by Dame Judi Dench), is beautifully carried out.  Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) has joined the Royal Navy in this installment and is seeking to be the first to find the Fountain of Youth for King George II (nicely played by Richard Griffiths of Harry Potter fame).  Barbossa is as slippery as usual but is never as ruthless as Blackbeard (Ian McShane) is.  It has been predicted that Blackbeard (who has an array of black magic powers) will meet his death soon so he will stop at nothing to be the first to the Fountain. The mermaids were a marvelous addition to the story.  I don't buy the comparisons to vampires just because the mermaids show fangs.  I also liked the role of Philip (the preacher, sensitively played by Sam Claflin) who falls in love with the captured mermaid Syrena (end of spoilers)<br /><br />Altogether, On Stranger Shores is an entertaining action film. There is plenty to like from the special effects, to the verbal sparing between Penelope Cruz and Johnny Depp to the malevolent evil of Blackbeard.  This film is more a true successor to the original film in spirit and story than the second and third installments.</p></br><a href="../users/AWG2O9C42XW5G.html">AWG2O9C42XW5G</a><br/><p>this is an awesome movie. it is not as good as the first one. but it is still good. i thought the story and the actors and the special effects were awesome. i will have to say this if johnny depp was not in this movie as jack sparrow then the movie probably woul of bombed. i love this movie, hope they make more. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do</p></br><a href="../users/A3GRN6J64F2C3X.html">A3GRN6J64F2C3X</a><br/><p>I caught "Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides" a few days after it opened in theaters, and liked it well enough. Thrills, laughs, scares, they're all there. However, it didn't have anywhere near the ambition and scope of the last couple of Pirates movies, "Dead Man's Chest" and "At World's End", nor the variety of characters.<br /><br />On that last point, there aren't many "normal" characters this time, like the previous films' Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) or Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), for the larger-than-life characters to contrast with and stand out against. Here, nearly everyone is a big, eccentric character... Johnny Depp's Captain Jack Sparrow, Geoffrey Rush's Captain Barbossa, Ian McShane's Blackbeard, among others, which eventually makes everything feel somewhat over the top. Making these characters seem even more eccentric is the fact that there isn't a big, ambitious story for them to fill this time, just a fairly modest one about different interests racing to reach the Fountain of Youth.<br /><br />Despite the smaller, less epic story, there are some high points in the movie, however, including a terrific set piece involving Blackbeard and his crew, with a conscripted Jack Sparrow along for the ride, trying to lure a school of mermaids into a trap, in order to secure the tears of one of the lovely but deadly creatures (the tears being needed to activate the Fountain of Youth once it's found). The whole mermaid sequence starts out bad for the hunters then gets worse, eventually resembling the "Pirates" version of a fire fight with the Vietcong. It's something to see.<br /><br />I could tell you a few more things, some good and some less so, about the movie. But in the end, if you liked the other "Pirates of the Caribbean" movies, you'll probably enjoy this one enough to justify a trip to the theater. You may even like it more than the last couple, if you felt those were getting a bit too bloated and complicated. Me, I found "On Stranger Tides" to be a bit of a step back in most key areas, but not enough of one to get upset about. I'm glad I saw it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FY3H6F4249E0.html">A3FY3H6F4249E0</a><br/><p>Very enjoyable movie!  It is about opposing forces, all in search of Ponce de Leon's Fountain of Youth.  Our hero, Captain Jack Sparrow/Johnny Depp, also has to contend with the infamous Blackbeard the Pirate (Ian McShane).  Penelope Cruz plays Angelica, a swash-buckling counterpart to Captain Jack who is obviously enamored with him.  Much of the film is on the sea, as one would expect.  We encounter mermaids on our journey which are not the nice ones we are used to - but then, they don't think humans are very nice either.<br /><br />It's a good time, all 2 hours 21 minutes of it!  There's lots of action, stunts, and funny one-liners with impeccable timing (e.g. I hope there are no termites in your wooden leg.) The movie was engaging the entire time.<br /><br />I LOVED the film and would definitely watch it again.  I give it 5 stars.<br /><br />My 37-year old son also loved it.  He has watched the other 3 Pirates of the Caribbean movies many times.  He gives it a 4 ? star.  The only thing he found was he believed the music to be not as well synced with the scenes as the other 3 movies.  He would watch it again also.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZBOBV9H1HDV.html">A3LZBOBV9H1HDV</a><br/><p>"Pirates Of The Caribbean: On Stranger Tides" is great! This is how the story goes: When Captain Jack Sparrow crosses paths with the enigmatic Angelica, he's not sure if it's love -- or if she's a ruthless con artist who's using him to find the fabled Fountain of Youth. When she forces him aboard the "Queen Anne's Revenge," the ship of the legendary pirate Blackbeard, Jack finds himself on an unexpected adventure in which he doesn't know whom to fear more: Blackbeard or Angelica, with whom he shares a mysterious past.<br /><br />The cast led by Johnny Depp (returning in his Oscar-nominated performance as Captain Jack Sparrow), Penelope Cruz (as Angelica), Ian McShane (as Blackbeard) & Geoffrey Rush (also back as Barbossa) is great. The directing by Rob Marshall is great. The screen story (based on suggestion of the novel "On Stranger Tides" by Tim Powers) & screenplay by Ted Elliott & Terry Rossio (both of them also executive produced) is great.<br /><br />The music by Hans Zimmer is great. The cinematography by Dariusz Wolski is great. The film editing by David Brenner & Wyatt Smith is great. The casting by Lucy Bevan is great. The production design by John Myhre is great. The art direction by Drew Boughton, John Chichester, Robert Cowper, Zack Grobler & Tomas Voth is great. The set decoration by Gordon Sim is great. The costume design by Penny Rose is great. The special and visual effects are great.<br /><br />This is a great summer movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat, your heart racing and your mind guessing, at the same time. This is just as great as the first three "Pirates Of The Caribbean" movies. This is one of the best movies of the summer season, so far.</p></br><a href="../users/A3TYC8T6W81DDB.html">A3TYC8T6W81DDB</a><br/><p>The Pirates of the Caribbean films have never pretended to be anything that they're not. Their inspiration was an amusement park ride after all. The films seem to be more of a vehicle for Johnny Depp to step inside of a character he has a little too much fun playing and are aimed toward women (and men, in some cases) who like to oggle him more than anything. The sequels just felt like an already thin premise was stretched beyond its means, which resulted in lackluster sequels that came off as being too similar to the original film. They were still entertaining on some level and people really seem to love the franchise. But you can't expect a new sequel to come along and break the mold, especially when the previous films have made over $2.5 billion at the worldwide box office. On Stranger Tides pretty much offers more of the same for its fans.<br /><br />The Pirates films have never shied away from action, but On Stranger Tides seems to have even more than the films before it. It's Jack Sparrow's first film away from Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann, so some over the top antics can probably be expected. Most of the film felt like an episode of "The Dukes of Hazzard" except it was centered around Jack Sparrow instead of the Duke boys and revolved around the open sea and The Black Pearl instead of Hazzard county and General Lee. Most of the scenes could basically be described in that voice over that'd say something along the lines of, "Jack's sure gotten himself into one heck of a pickle this time. How in the world will he swashbuckle his way out of this one?"<br /><br />With Jack worming his way out of several crazy situations and nearly non-stop swordplay and action, the film's cast could probably be considered better than decent. Geoffrey Rush and Kevin McNally are the only returning cast members from the previous films other than Depp and they slide back into the Barbossa and Gibbs characters just as easily as Depp channels Jack Sparrow. Angelica, played by Penelope Cruz, was a little too convenient of a character. A former love interest of Jack's who hasn't forgiven or forgotten the way things ended between them. Their relationship and the way things pan out between them just seemed rather predictable in the long run. Ian McShane was pretty disappointing, as well. He's given this incredibly cool character in Blackbeard. All pirates fear him; he has this awesome pirate ship, and can bring men back from the dead. He even has a few memorable one liners, but the guy couldn't have looked more bored during the entire film. Johnny Depp looks to be the only guy actually having fun in this film while everyone else just sees it as another job. On Stranger Tides still has an entertaining vibe to it, but also feels like a film we've seen three times before.<br /><br />Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides is familiar territory. By now you should have a good idea of whether or not you'll enjoy the film or not. It follows the same formula as the previous three films, but is the shortest of the films and seems to be lacking a story that really reels you in. Audiences love Johnny Depp, so there's no doubt it'll be a success. The action does seem to be amped up a bit, but Jack Sparrow seems goofier than ever. It's humorous at times, but similar to Homer getting dumber in every new season of "The Simpsons." While the film wasn't a huge home run with critics, it's still the explosive and extravagant return of a character everyone loves and is bound to set the box office on fire once again.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KFBAPAKMEQUF.html">A1KFBAPAKMEQUF</a><br/><p>Definitely by far the best of the Pirates movies.  Funny, witty dialogue, interesting villain, a fantasy romance between a mermaid and a missionary and a race to the mystical Fountain of Youth -- what more could you ask for?<br /><br />Wasn't going to watch because I was so disappointed with the 3rd movie, but this one brings the fun back to the series.  Looking forward to the next one.  Penelope Cruz did an amazing job.  She and Depp have great chemistry together.</p></br><a href="../users/A16XRPF40679KG.html">A16XRPF40679KG</a><br/><p>This one integrates the real pirate 'blackbeard' into the storyline. The real blackbeard was a very fearsome and bloody pirate who got his head cut off in battle with the british navy off the coast of america. He was a american pirate for sure , although americans were really mainly british at this time. But this version is a good one , he's a truly nasty piece of work and that's a good thing. THe plot is easier to understand than the third one too. The action is very good the story is acceptable. There hasn't been a bad pirates of the carribean movie yet though. People expect too much from sequels usually. THe first is always going to be the freshest. The 3d version is the one to get as that is how it was shown at the theaters. And it is a good showcase of 3d. I must say I am tired of getting dvd's and digital copies in my package though because it drives up the price. I don't NEED a dvd copy.. They are wasting money doing that. The blu ray looks stunning and the extras are nice. Obviously if you don't have a 3d tv then only need the standard blu ray. Either version looks stunning on disc and is worth owning if you like the series. This is a fun movie and the acting is as good as the other versions with penelope cruz doing a fine job as the lead actress. Get it if you like the series, it's got plenty of action and humour in it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BSZPRBKYAB2K.html">A2BSZPRBKYAB2K</a><br/><p>I was relunctant to see this at first because of watching the other "Pirates of the Caribbean" series.  They showed the sneak previews of this movie OVER and OVER again, and I wass going to skip it at the theatres and wait for the DVD (which I did).  I finally purchased this when it was for sale as a regular DVD.  I didn't buy the 3 pack combo.  I was suprized at how intrested I became in the plot of Jack Sparrow in this addition.  I enjoy Johnny Depp's acting and so I wasn't disappointed in this movie.  The supporting actors and actresses did great as well.  From Penelope Cruz as a pirate and former love, to Geoffrey Rush as Captain Barbossa and Ian McShane as the infamous Blackbeard.  The plot has twists and turns that keep your interest.  The locations and special effects in the movie are good and amusing.  The end is not bad (though you can tell who is not going to make it).  Overall, I am glad I have it in my "Pirates of the Caribbean" collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A9RNMO9MUSMTJ.html">A9RNMO9MUSMTJ</a><br/><p>Watching Johnny Depp, you can sense that he is tired of playing this part. There<br />is less glitter in his eyes as the previous pirate movies.<br />But with the boatload of money Disney has, this sequel was done and it does<br />look pretty with great sets, mermaids and other goodies.  I did watch it and<br />at some level it did entertain me but im really glad that i only rented it.</p></br><a href="../users/AER15RIMV8E6D.html">AER15RIMV8E6D</a><br/><p>I'll admit that this installment is better than the previous two movies, but definitely not better than the original. Only Jack Sparrow, Barbossa, and Gibbs return for this adventure. Elizabeth, Will, Pintel, Ragetti, Cotton, and Marty are gone, but it's still an interesting hilarious action-packed new chapter in the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' franchise. Jack is still up to his old tricks and is asked by King George II to lead an expedition to find the Fountain of Youth. Jack must soon deal with his former lover, Angelica, who happens to be the daughter of the new villian, Blackbeard. They need the tear of a Mermaid and two silver chalices to make the fountain work. If you love the series, and especially Captain Jack Sparrow, you'll love PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: ON STRANGER TIDES!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A18HHKM6WGEF9D.html">A18HHKM6WGEF9D</a><br/><p>I think this series has definitely run its course. I love Johny Depp, but even his charms cannot save this film. The plot is basically another variation on the treasure hunt, although this time they are looking for the fountain of youth. Capt. Barbossa, played again by Geoffrey Rush, is also after it, allied with the British crown. Blackbeard, played by Ian McShane, is the third contender and he's accompanied by his daughter, played by Penelope Cruz. Although it's basically a simple plot, there are various twists and turns that are hard to follow, partly because of the strong accents. My husband couldn't follow it all, having not seen the prior film, and I'm not sure I did either. It also simply dragged on too long - it seemed a little caught up in itself, and the cast seemed a little caught up in themselves (most of the time having more fun than us I suspect.)<br /><br />The settings and special effects are great though, as they have been in the other films. A mermaid scene is especially impressive, and helped save this film from 1 or 2 star status for me. I also liked the chemistry between Cruz and Depp, and their interactions were a highlight of the film. So it's a 3 star for me. I think I'm done with this franchise though, I hope the studio agrees.</p></br><a href="../users/AE9V37MS6QY8D.html">AE9V37MS6QY8D</a><br/><p>The problem with the fourth installment of the "Pirates" series is that even though it tries to recharge a flailing saga, it still comes up short. While I am happy that Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley did not return for this film (don't get me wrong, I like their characters, but what other stories could they tell with these characters?), the addition of Cruz seemed a bit out of sorts. Even though the romantic history and sexual tension was there between her and Jack, I still didn't really believe it. She seemed more like just another enemy in disguise, almost Jack's equal. McShane was good as Blackbeard. The other thing that threw me off was the side story of Sam Claflin's Philip and &Agrave;strid Berg&egrave;s-Frisbey's mermaid Syrena, which was a great aspect of the film. However, their story ends with no real closure or clue as to their fates. It's as if the writers just forgot all about them. After seeing this, I was hoping that the film series would come to an end, but, with the post-credits scene, I fear we still have more to come from this dying franchise.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EHTFVSD0H7I6.html">A1EHTFVSD0H7I6</a><br/><p>For number 4 in this series, this bad boy isn't a stinker. I did miss Bloom and Knightley, but Depp is still good/bad ol Cap'n Jack, and Rush is back as well bringing his creepy elements to the whole story. Penelope Cruz adds a little feminine touch as the daughter (? is she or isn't she?)  of the infamous Blackbeard.<br /><br />And speaking of feminine touch. I will NEVER look at a mermaid quite the same way again. Shudder. Who knew?<br /><br />If you are a big fan of Depp and Captain Jack you will probably need to watch this at least once. And if you are waffling as to whether to invest your money and your time in number 4... Red Box or Netflix it. A few laughs, some neat special effects, a couple of fights, some nastiness and those mermaids....ugh.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HVL790PBWYTU.html">A2HVL790PBWYTU</a><br/><p>It's not easy to impersonate Captain Jack Sparrow. For one thing, he's got that mincing walk. Still, someone's going around passing himself off as our favorite pirate, recruiting sea hands for a run at Ponce de Leon's mythical Fountain of Youth. And this poser isn't the only one after the key to life eternal. The Spanish are curious. The British are curious because the Spanish are curious. Edward Teach, a.k.a. the notorious pirate and dark sorcerer Blackbeard, is another buttinski. And, the honest-to-gosh real Captain Jack Sparrow, who had just about given up his own quest for the Fountain of Youth, reinvigorates himself to the cause. He has a map and all.<br /><br />PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: ON STRANGER TIDES is a hell of a long title, and it's a fairly long movie. I liked it enough that I'm recommending it. But I didn't enjoy it as much as the previous three films (including the way over-the-top AT WORLD'S END). Turns out, I missed Kiera Knightley and Legolas something fierce. Turns out, Jack Sparrow is better served when he's coming at you sideways, when he's not featured as so obviously the central character. Partly, it's that, at this stage, we know that Jack Sparrow is a good guy, no matter that he walks like a silly ponce and that he sports sinister gold teeth and heavy eyeliner. By now, it's difficult for the film to employ trickeration on a savvy audience. And Jack Sparrow loses a bit of something when you know without a doubt that he's an honorable scoundrel. Even if he's still peculiar in his habits and methods.<br /><br />Saving the ever reliable Geoffrey Rush, Johnny Depp has no actor with enough of a presence for him to effectively bounce off from, and right there I guess I just elevated Orlando Bloom's acting chops. The new characters don't resonate for me, not Penelope Cruz's winsome pirate's daughter (and Sparrow's old flame), not Ian McShane's cursed Blackbeard, and certainly not that actor who plays the uncharismatic missionary/clerk/all around boredom-on-legs.<br /><br />Hell, I even miss that short, bald pirate and his mate with the wooden eye.<br /><br />No surprise, the film is visually stunning; it looks very good. It's loud, bombastic, and drawn out. The f/x and stunts are rather spectacular. As ever, Jack Sparrow's antics are to be appreciated. I particularly liked the scene in the British king's palace, in which the movie audience sees a captive Jack, in delightful off-the-cuff fashion, plan and stage his eventual escape, a key component of which is that chandeliered dessert.<br /><br />The film tries to distract you with plot candy such as lost magical chalices and mermaid's tears, and zombies and a Keith Richards cameo. But it all feels like filler. There's something missing from the core of the story. And Jack Sparrow, unruffled and odd and improvisational, is still best when utilized as misdirection. But, for that to be, you need someone else to also focus on. That missionary dullard sure can't cut the mustard or capture big screen interest. Which leaves Jack shouldering the hero tropes. Here, he's clearly the hero and central protagonist and even the lead in the love story. Jack, you've gone all domesticated, yo. It doesn't quite suit you.<br /><br />I will say that Astrid Berges-Frisbey, who plays the mermaid Syrena, is a stunner. I do challenge the laws of gravity which always seemed to place her hair in such a strategic way that Disney is able to maintain its PG-13 rating.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>The saga is going on and will never stop. The pirates are eternal and Jack Sparrow's fame is eternal since he discovered the Fountain of Youth. It is not a master piece but it is very well done and highly entertaining.<br /><br />We expect and we get all the battles, fights, struggles, duels or whatever with the pirates on one side, the English on the other side and the Spaniards on the third side. That coin is definitely magical with its three sides. The interest in these battles is the sites, the costumes and the details. The English king, the German George, the one who brought Handel to England, I guess, is a fat slob and I am amazed they still can find actors to play such roles. They must be highly handicapped in real life.<br /><br />The treasure chase is original again and this time we have to go up more often than down and the fountain of youth is higher than its source. But this time there are no monsters, monkeys, spiders, hardly one snake, no crocodiles, no sharks or whatever. The only exotic beings are mermaids. They must have mobilized the whole Olympic swim team to take care of the flotilla of mermaids that attack the poor sailors. I must admit the love affair between the Catholic missionary and the mermaid is sentimental enough to be dramatic.<br /><br />On another hand they always use some family connections which are both false and true, just like all the sworn promises are both truthful and fakes, and the promises are always respected and yet always turned around and broken, not directly, as if it were an accident. Here it is very useful to get rid of a couple of old pirates that will no longer be there next time and that will be a good thing. They deserve to retire or be marooned on some desert island.<br /><br />So enjoy this long film the way it has to be enjoyed, like a beautiful piece of entertainment and a very well performed and acted piece of cinema.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU</p></br><a href="../users/A2U80IPZXN5V1U.html">A2U80IPZXN5V1U</a><br/><p>It's already been four years since the last Pirates of the Caribbean movie, now Jack Sparrow and his matey's are returning for a third sequel with On Strangers Tide. This fourth Pirates of the Caribbean film is of course going to be a bit different from previous Pirates movie as a result of the original trilogy concluded and some characters that are no longer present.  This time the charismatic Jack Sparrow is on a new quest this time looking for the fountain of youth, with some old acquaintances of past making an appearance.  On Strangers Tide wastes no time and goes straight into action and asks questions later. There is more dialogue and development in the second half of the film than in the first half, where the viewer is thrown into action almost right away. Pirates of the Caribbean movies always take a certain time to really get started but this one is exception to the rule. At 137 minutes, On Strangers Tide is a little shorter than the previous two POTC films, Dead Man's Chest (2006) and At World's End (2007) but its length is still over 2 hours and comparable to The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003)'s 143 minutes.<br /><br />Will and Elisabeth are not in this fourth film but I didn't miss them or at least not as much as I thought I would. While it would have been nice to see Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley return (maybe they will in a future Pirates who knows?), this movie kept me plenty interested and those actors not being present did not hurt the movie at all. Johnny Depp remains excellent as Jack Sparrow this fourth time around, as good as ever.  Geoffrey Rush was once more terrific as Barbossa. Penelope Cruz was great as Angelica, a former lover of Sparrow and daughter of Blackbeard. Depp and Cruz had on screen chemistry and were believable and worked out well. Ian McShane delivered a solid performance as Blackbeard but I guess I somehow expected him to be a more frightening character perhaps because of the Blackbeard legend. I can understand why some fans may not enjoy this fourth entry as much as the others. Some reviewers complained that the movie has too much action and maybe that's true but I can hardly see a fan of the series hating this one, liking it less or being disappointed perhaps. The fountain of youth was a decent enough storyline and the inclusion of the mermaids was a nice one and was very fitting into this Pirate universe (I still think they don't have fangs). To me, the mermaid attack scene shown in the previews is a highlight of the movie. I was slightly worried about the zombie pirates because I thought it may have been too over the top but that turned out fine as well. I quite liked the concept for this fourth film, the chase for the fountain of youth, and I thought the inclusion of famed pirate Blackbeard and the mermaids were interesting and in a way even breathed new life into the series while still being familiar and true to the previous films.<br /><br />As for the 3D effect I must say it was surprisingly good, I don't mean amazing or revolutionary but I simply like how the effects didn't overshadow any event or were purely useless. What we have with On Strangers Tide is an effective 3D and that's coming from someone who's not a fan of 3D films. They didn't make the movie about 3D which some modern movies do; this one doesn't rely solely on 3D effects because it doesn't have to.<br /><br />I like On Strangers Tide and find it to be a very enjoyable Pirates film overall, to me this one is much better than the third film, At World's End. On Strangers Tide may not be the best POTC movie but it has an interesting story, is entertaining and watchable which as far as sequels are concerned is always a good thing. I feel OST is maybe a little less complicated than earlier Pirates film, it's easier to follow that someone who has never seen any POTC films would not be lost. This is Definitely not the best in the series but to me is superior to the previous entry and manages to be a worthwhile sequel that was better than anticipated. It's been four years since the last POTC movie but even with two of the original characters gone, this one manages to be a very good sequel and perhaps, makes way for a new trilogy (there is after all, some talk about making 1 or 2 more movies). Some fans and critics didn't like it but I sure did. 4/5.</p></br><a href="../users/AUTBHG6070SL4.html">AUTBHG6070SL4</a><br/><p>Depp adeptly keeps this franchise fresh, this time with the quest for the fountain of youth. As always, Jack Sparrow navigates the straits between the straight-laced royal military, the villains mor evillainous than he is, and the supernatural forces that he seems to take for granted so casually. Chemistry with Pen&eacute;lope Cruz works well, but lacks some of the spark he had with Keira Knightley. Effects work beautifully, even if a few seem not to have been thought through fully. (That aquarium full of water would have weighed what? And would have taken how many to carry it?) The romance between two side characters adds a sweet touch to the mix, too.<br /><br />This isn't the first "summer movie" of this summer season, but it sets the bar high for the ones that follow.<br /><br />-- wiredweird, reviewing the release to theaters</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>It has been four years since the last we saw Captain Jack Sparrow in the bloated third film of the Pirates of the Caribbean series, but this time he is back in a stand alone story that has little to do with the previous three. This may be the shortest of the four movies as well (around 2 hours and 15 minutes) and it's never boring, but for some reason it still seems too long. I must admit that I liked Dead Man's Chest and At World's End, but the first one, as with most movie series, will always be the best. On Stranger Tides might even be slightly better than the last two sequels. At least it's not as confusing as At World's End, but I can pretty much say that if you didn't like the last two you'll probably feel the same about this one.<br /><br />Johnny Depp it seems will keep playing this character until the day he dies. I read that he wants to do at least two more PotC movies. Yes he has created one of the most memorable characters in movie history, but too much of a good thing can turn annoying real quick. I think he fares quite well this time around, more so than the last two, even though Jack Sparrow gets more and more goofy with each outing. Geoffrey Rush is back as Captain Barbossa and has his moments. Ian McShane has the look suited for Blackbeard, the most feared pirate of all time, but they should have made him much taller as was the real man. Depp even towered over him in some scenes, making him less intimidating. He also didn't do as much with this villainous role as I was hoping for. Those who have seen McShane on Deadwood know what I mean. Since Orlando Bloom and Kiera Knightley are gone, Pen&eacute;lope Cruz tries to fill the void as the daughter of Blackbeard. She looks good of course, but there wasn't much chemistry between her and Depp. The addition of mermaids was my favorite part, and these are like no mermaids I've ever heard of. Their beauty lures you in before dragging you underwater to be drowned and devoured.<br /><br />I read that the budget was half of the last film (around 150 instead of 300 million), but I really didn't notice. The CGI and sets looked up to par. Of course you also will get more than enough of that loud Han Zimmer score that runs through the whole series.<br /><br />Overall, Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides is not a great movie and it might leave you with the impression that you have already seen this before, but as a mindless piece of summer entertainment it gets the job done.<br /><br />Oh, the IMAX 3-D looked really clear, but I'm not sure it was worth double the price.<br /><br />3 and 1/2 out of 5 stars</p></br><a href="../users/A39W3263A9HCMN.html">A39W3263A9HCMN</a><br/><p>I am really unsure of how to sum up On Stranger Tides in simple words. Before I begin this review, let me state 2 things: 1. I absolutely love the first three movies, and 2. To that guy who said "the skinny girl is not in the movie", that skinny girl is named Kiera Knightley. OK, now moving on, sort of.<br /><br />The first three movies were good old fashioned fun that didn't take themselves too seriously. I enjoyed them all very much and have seen them numerous times. I thought Verbinski did a hell of a job, considering he was a punk rock video director before a filmmaker. When I heard a fourth movie was being made, I got super excited. However, I had a stirring feeling of disappointment when I found out Verbinski was not directing. I'm not down with Rob Marshall- I thought Chicago was overrated and Nine was a confusing and slow mess. But, it's a Pirates movie, so I figured it'd be fun.<br /><br />Since I'm kinda pressed for time, I will sum up what I liked and didn't like.<br /><br />FIrst, the cast were great as per usual. Visually it was entertaining and the movie moved along at a nice pace... for the first hour. That, and Penelope Cruz is hot!!! And she did a great job as Angelica. Blackbeard was a cool villain, and Ian McShane does a fantastic job. There's a creepy scene involving mermaids, and that got a good reaction from those at the theatre.<br /><br />The bad... is everything else. First off, Barbossa is in the movie for only 20 minutes. The last hour is boring, drags a lot, and that's not all- there's a MAJOR plot hole involving the fountain of youth which is really annoying. And the 3D sucked.<br /><br />Overall, this is not a bad movie, but the writers are running out of ideas and it's clear.<br /><br />PROS:<br />-Great acting<br />-Hans Zimmer's score rules<br />-Nice after the credits coda<br /><br />CONS<br />-Pointless characters including the mermaid and the religious dude<br />-About 30 minutes too long<br />-Jack thinks far too much in this film<br />-Drags greatly in the second half</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>Very often, the dollar signs in a studio executive's eyes prove to be too powerful a draw, leading them to offer huge sums of money to stars to reprise their roles. A director is found who can, at the least, maintain the status quo and not kill the lucrative franchise. And a sequel is born. But sequels are almost always a case of diminishing returns, both financially and creatively. Such is the case with the "Pirates of the Caribbean" films I hoped the series was killed by the critically panned third installment, but it made a bounty of cash. And before you could say "Davy Jones' Locker", Johnny Depp was offered a huge sum of money (I heard rumors of $40 million), a new director was brought on board (Rob Marshall, director of "Chicago", "Memoirs of a Geisha" and "Nine") and producer Jerry Bruckheimer was able to offer Disney an almost certain money maker for Summer, 2011. This should help make up for his recent duds "The Sorcerer's Apprentice" and "Prince of Persia: Sands of Time".<br /><br />The good news? "On Stranger Tides" is better than "At World's End", but that isn't saying much. It's not worth paying extra dollars to see in 3-D. It is worth, at most, the cost of a bargain matinee.<br /><br />Captain Jack Sparrow (Depp) crosses paths with an old flame, Angelica (Penelope Cruz), who is posing as Jack to recruit a crew for a mysterious voyage. Jack is soon shanghaied and quickly learns Angelica is posing as Blackbeard's (Ian McShane) daughter in an effort to tag along as he searches for the fabled Fountain of Youth. Meanwhile, Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) has joined the Royal Navy and seems determined to use the new resources and power at his disposal to hunt down Blackbeard. Eventually, both groups will cross paths with a group of Spanish sailors who also seem to be looking for Ponce de Leon's treasure. Along the way, they try to collect pieces of the puzzle; legend dictates they will need the tear of a live mermaid and two of Ponce de Leon's silver chalices.<br /><br />Directed by Rob Marshall and written by Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio (among others), "On Stranger Tides" benefits from a few changes but suffers from some big narrative problems.<br /><br />I'm not sure why the producers decided to leave Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley out of this adventure, but it was a good decision. Quite frankly, each looked both bored and angry at the same time throughout "At World's End". I really doubt they turned this installment down - if they were considered valuable enough, huge sums of money would have appeared to help entice them. It certainly worked with Depp. I have never been a fan of Bloom, but I do enjoy Knightley's work. That said, "Stranger Tides" seems to have more energy due to their absence. The filmmaker's still deemed it necessary to have a younger couple along for the ride so they have created a new couple, a young priest who falls in love with the mermaid they have captured. Their budding romance is sweet, but the two actors do not have the magnetism or presence of Bloom and Knightley.<br /><br />At this point, it would just seem odd, just seem "straight-to-DVD" to have a new film without Captain Jack. Depp is so memorable in the role that Captain Jack has become part of the film lexicon, much like Hannibal Lecter, Ripley, Danny Ocean and others. That said, in the new film, Depp really doesn't do anything new with the character. Everything seems rehashed or recycled, from his exaggerated flouncing about to the mannerisms borrowed from Keith Richards (who makes an improbable cameo). He also continues to shift his allegiance from moment to moment; he wants to help Angelica, then he enters into an allegiance with Barbossa, then he seems to be out to find the Fountain of Youth for his own gain. This was amusing and fun to watch in the first film. Now, in #4 (and the already announced fifth installment), its just more of the same. When you think about Johnny Depp's work, that is usually the last thing that comes to mind. Its sad when a once formidable talent, who used to do strange, unusual and exciting work, begins to do work that can be described as 'more of the same'.<br /><br />Geoffrey Rush's Barbossa fares about as well as Depp. From the moment he shows up dressed in Royal Navy garb, we know he is playing a game to achieve some goal. When the goal is revealed, it comes as no surprise. Rush is a very good actor who has done many very good films. But he is clearly in this film for the money. I can't fault him for wanting to collect a big paycheck, but he could've done more with the role.<br /><br />Penelope Cruz is fine as Angelica. She runs around with a certain sense of abandon and seems to have fun in the role. But the whole 'posing as Blackbeard's daughter' ruse is never explained or justified and just seems odd.<br /><br />Ian McShane is the best part of this new movie. As Blackbeard, he introduces a new character, a new menace and it is fun to see this character come to life. When we first meet the fabled pirate, he leaves his stateroom to address his crew. Upset, he barely raises his voice, but his character and figure are still alarming, still menacing. His beard, the ends braided, is on fire. Why? Who knows, but he doesn't seem to notice or care.<br /><br />Marshall seems to have fun breathing life into this story. The action scenes seem a little madcap and lively. In fact, I get the definite sense they are trying to shift the balance back to hand-to-hand combat away from heavy CGI work. There are a lot of personal fights and sword battles and very little heavy computer graphics. This is a nice idea, almost as though they are paying homage to the pirate and swashbuckler films of the 40s and 50s. Really, Depp's Sparrow is not that far from Burt Lancaster's "The Crimson Pirate". At least in temperament and tone.<br /><br />An early scene in London provides an excuse for Sparrow to escape from the Royal Guard by jumping from the roof of one moving carriage to the next, swinging from bunting and falling into the lap of a very surprising cameo. Later, the swordfights and a scene between Sparrow and Barbossa aboard Ponce de Leon's shipwreck, all help to recreate the sense of daring and speed we love about the first (and maybe the second) "Pirates" films.<br /><br />As Angelica is an old flame, Sparrow turns on the charm, trying to flirt his way back into her good graces. But these moments are too familiar and become boring. He tries the same moves on Keira Knightley in the first three films, with the same success rate, the same reactions and the same expressions when they don't work. Well, she isn't receptive this time, best to keep trying... And trying... And trying. The difference between Cruz's Angelica and Knightley's Elizabeth is that Angelica is allowed to flirt back every so often. Elizabeth was attached to (shudder) Will, Bloom's character. It took all of her energy to create something with that vacuum of emotion, she didn't have anything left for Depp. But seriously, because she and Will are always circling one another, and because these are Disney films, she couldn't show any interest or return Captain Jack's attentions. In "Stranger Tides", Angelica masquerades as Blackbeard's "daughter", leaving her free to flirt a little because she is romantically unattached.<br /><br />I found the last "Pirates" film to be a complete misfire. It seemed like director Gore Verbinski was trying to legitimize the success of the series and make a 'serious' pirate film. That film runs for two hours and forty five minutes and the characters stand around and talk for a good two hours. These are popcorn films. Yes, we need story, we need character development. But if the writer(s) and director have their jobs well, they have created a viable, visual, interesting universe for the characters to inhabit. If they have done their job really well, they don't need to legitimize anything and the audience will enjoy the ride. For "At World's End", they didn't do their jobs that well.<br /><br />So for "Stranger Tides", they made some changes. Depp is in practically every frame of the film, a big change from the last film. There is also very little exposition. If they take any time to elaborate the plot, they do so right before, during or right after some action. Marshall seems to get what this film should be. It should be fun. The amped up action and Jack's increased presence are good changes.<br /><br />But the film suffers from too little exposition. The opening scenes in London involve Jack posing as a judge in an attempt to free his long-suffering First Mate Gibbs (Kevin McNally). Much later, they cross paths again and this seems to remind Jack of the man's very existence. Why go to so much trouble and risk to save someone only to completely forget about them? Later, there is a pretty significant plot hole which isn't necessary. Because the writers and director are creating this universe, they are creating the rules. If you have to break your own rules, you didn't do a good enough job in the first place.<br /><br />"Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides" is a step in the right direction. It features a good performance by McShane, but it is still far away from the magic of the first film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R1HAXRNU0QX7.html">A2R1HAXRNU0QX7</a><br/><p>Alright, let's just cut to the chase.  PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: ON STRANGER TIDES is a huge disappointment.  It will make lots of money and spawn more sequels...but the spark has gone out, and frankly, I'm not sure anything will help.  As long as Capt. Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is the major character, these films just aren't going to cut it.<br /><br />Think back on the first film in the series POTC: THE CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL (goodness, typing all these long titles is tedious).  It starred two lovely up-and-coming performers at the height of their popularity (Keira Knightley and especially Legolas...oh, I mean Orlando Bloom).  And Johnny Depp was there too...a popular, slightly hip actor.  And the film featured state of the art effects, some juicy supporting performances (especially from always reliable Geoffrey Rush) and was a burst of fresh air.  A lush pirate adventure that was actually fun!  Knightley and Bloom were lovely to look at and feisty and witty.  And Depp was a revelation.  His Sparrow was a unique and amazing creation.  (I won't run down all his now very familiar characteristics.)  So much so that Depp was nominated for an Oscar and went from modestly successful leading man to full blown STAR.  The world was drowned in Depp and we embraced his oddball characterizations.  He went on to receive another Oscar nomination for FINDING NEVERLAND and to considerable oddball success in more and more Tim Burton films.<br /><br />Meanwhile, POTC: DEAD MAN'S CHEST arrived.  Packed even more full of effects, it still had lots of fun...but suffered from sequel-bloat.  More was not always more.  But I still found it quite enjoyable, with some stunt work that was fun (the big "hamster ball" scene is still clever).  Depp was now solidly the star, but Sparrow was still new enough that we wanted more.  But by the time POTC: AT WORLD'S END came along, the film was SO special effects laden, SO loud and SO Jack Sparrow centric that I felt the series was pretty much played out.  The movie was long and frequently boring.  Big CGI battle scenes were not enough to engage.  The characters were so familiar.  There was nothing new that Jack Sparrow could bring to the table.  His strange accent, odd mincing and fake-drunk demeanor were totally familiar.  But of course, we viewers attended dutifully and saw the series wrapped up.  The Knightley / Bloom characters had their arc more or less wrapped up (and by now, Bloom was not even remotely a movie star any more).  It was a disappointing end to a series that started so well...but it really did seem to be the end.<br /><br />Now a new director and a producer Jerry Bruckheimer and star Depp have "rebooted" the series.  And in some ways, they have listened to the criticisms of the past.  The special effects, while still impressive, are significantly dialed down.  There has been an effort to return to character and not just noise for the sake of it.  And aside from Depp & Rush, they've pretty much abandoned all the previous characters.  But Sparrow is still very much the focus, and with stripping away most other distractions, it was painfully clear to me that Sparrow has nothing left to offer us.  There is NO surprise left in this character.  Depp tries hard...but he's not really acting any more, he's recreating mannerisms that once grew organically from Depp the actor.  He's become Depp the Jack Sparrow impersonator.  He can put on the makeup and costume...but not really anything more than a characterization.  Sparrow is a cartoon now.<br /><br />The movie still features some clever "chase" scenes, including an early scene involving horses and carriages that feels like something Jackie Chan might have staged.  But there's lots of talking in the first half of the film.  Lots of exposition.  Something to do with finding the fountain of youth, and who has stolen whose ship and why is the pirate Barbossa now the captain of an English military vessel.  And who is this woman (Penelope Cruise) with a complicated past history with Depp?  They were clearly lovers once, but are now bitter rivals.  But that romantic spark remains.  (Yet Cruz and Depp have no chemistry.  Really, when was the last time Johnny Depp had any real romantic chemistry with an actress?)  And then it turns out she's working with the evil pirate Blackbeard (Ian McShane)...the most evil pirate ever.  I found the first hour of this two hour fifteen minute film to be mostly quite tedious, and my eyelids frequently drooped.)<br /><br />Things perked up a bit when Blackbeard and his crew reach the mysterious island where mermaids live.  These mermaids are gorgeous sirens who lure men to them and then turn into some fairly vicious, fanged creatures.  The scene when Blackbeard is trying to trap one of these creatures is actually pretty impressive, and my interest in the film finally rose above lukewarm.  But that interest waned fairly soon.  And when Depp and Rush teamed up towards the end, I realized that the same "been there, seen that" feeling I had about Sparrow also applied to Rush's Barbossa.  Rush brings his best efforts, but the character is what it is...and so he's grown tiresome too.<br /><br />As always, the films are technically impeccable.  (I'd advise saving your money and passing on the 3D version.  That's what I saw, and the 3D added nothing to the film except unneeded darkness.)  But with a needlessly complicated plot, awkward exposition and a lead character who has evolved from surprisingly delightful to dishearteningly mundane...the PIRATES series has worn out its welcome.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KIQ4P4ZW3ALF.html">A1KIQ4P4ZW3ALF</a><br/><p>First, and most importantly, Depp has gotten into a rut, whereas his previous performances in the Pirates series had a novel, wacky, spontaneous nature to them this performance seemed too rehearsed, too practiced. It lacked imagination, energy and fantasy. One example, was his hanging on to a banner and running/riding on horse drawn carts and platforms. Besides being an old and tired routine it seemded added just to inject some energy into what was a pretty tiresome movie. Other than her physical appearance Cruz added little to the movie.<br /><br />Second, part of that can be attributed to the script which lacked imagination and the dark, foreboding comedy and fantasy we've come to expect. The Cruz as daughter, the mermaids and the fountain-of-youth subplots seemed to be something borrowed as a shortcut through a lack of creative effort; to show us something truly fantastical. The mermaid graphics besides being cheap looking seemed more appropriate for showcasing a Victoria's Secret modeling exhibition. The sword fighting scenes looked like a high school stage revue. And, of course, the same old tavern look. Thus the hackneyed flow to the story. But of course this is a Disney movie so there's no secret to where the monied priorities lie.<br /><br />A very forgettable continuation of the series. That is often the case when the sequels continue primarily because they've become an easily reworked cash cow.</p></br><a href="../users/AJD9EA658HCFW.html">AJD9EA658HCFW</a><br/><p>After the disappointment of the third Pirates film, I knew there would be a break. However, after a four-year break, producer Jerry Bruckheimer decided to take the franchise in a new direction. Instead of continuing where the story left off at the end of "At Worlds End", Bruckheimer thought it would be best to start fresh with a new plot line.<br /><br />"On Stander Tides" is about Captain Jack Sparrow trying to find the fountain of youth. He is competing against his old foe Captain Barbossa and the Spanish to find it.<br /><br />With the new plot and characters, "On Stranger Tides" is better than "At Worlds End" but is nowhere near "The Curse of the Black Pearl".<br />If you are a fan of Captain Jack Sparrow, you will find this film entertaining as Johnny Depp does a great job as Captain Jack Sparrow.</p></br><a href="../users/A1WUMTJOASEL5F.html">A1WUMTJOASEL5F</a><br/><p>My favorite POTC flick bar none, because it was goofy fun, and the 3D effects were special, and seamless photography makes you feel you're in every cave, ship,  banquet room, beach, grotto, and lighthouse. The third installment kind of rubbed me the wrong way because of excessive chatter and bargaining.  The script in this fourth one is merely the pause between many action scenes, and a wine cellar keg full of rambling shots involving sword fights, nasty escapes, and tumbling action aboard ships and village streets. The familiar soundtrack is here once again, proving the original filmakers knew what they were doing with the upbeat score.  Great fun if one can just give themselves up to fantasy with pirates ships, lost hearts, and vicious mermaids.  One of the Jack Sparrow best! Er, that's Capt. Jack Sparrow . . .</p></br><a href="../users/A3TNM3C9ENUCFW.html">A3TNM3C9ENUCFW</a><br/><p>This is a review of the movie seen at the theater, NOT the BD release planned for the future.<br /><br />Chances are if you're reading this you're a fan of the Pirates franchise, and/or Depp and company so are willing to overlook the fact that this is a money spinning exercise set squarely in the "popcorn flick" genre of summer blockbusters.<br />Much has been made of the absence of Orlando Bloom, and Keira Knightly, in so far as they thought it enough of a ridiculous and unnecessary 4th outing as to not be involved, but the inclusion of Penelope Cruz, and Ian McShane more than make up for that anyway (in my opinion).<br /><br />This latest, somewhat shorter installment treads much of the same ground as the previous 3 to no surprise, and like them or hate them, you have to agree in part to continuing a winning formula. A critics dream this is not, but of course it will still wow plenty of summer audiences, and no doubt be a financial success.<br /><br />So to my "muddled" comment. Well the story (which was probably conceived as a good idea somewhere) revolves around Jack Sparrow searching for the fountain of youth.<br />Tagging along are the ever pleasing Jeffrey Rush as Barbossa chewing scenery as he goes, and arch nemesis Ian McShane as Blackbeard, complete with beautiful daughter Cruz.<br />Secret silver chalices, CGI mermaids that change from beauty to beast while attacking, and an ever present need for the cast to explain what is going on, just makes the whole thing look muddled.<br /><br />Depp's antics stretch credulity even more than usual, as does most of the story, from an initial escape (again) to the plot twisting quest. Another criticism for me would be that Cruz and Depp do not have the spark or chemistry they should, probably safer to say that Depp and Rush have more.<br /><br />Of course it's a PG-13 so the action and eye candy abound. That's probably what saves the movie somewhat, it's less plodding than the previous movies, and as long as you can suspend disbelief enough, you'll enjoy the action sequences that seem to bombard most of the film.<br /><br />No spoilers here, just accept it for what it is. 3 Stars</p></br><a href="../users/AAZRWLML88IZK.html">AAZRWLML88IZK</a><br/><p>Disney has gotten a whole lot of mileage out of the Pirates franchise, considering it's based on one of its amusement park rides, and this fourth installment would test the true star power of not only its lead actor, Johnny Depp, but the saucy, wisecracking Jack Sparrow. How so? Well, with On Stranger Tides, Depp would have to make a go of it without three-time co-stars Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley, as well as director Gore Verbinski, who had also helmed all three previous films. No, this time around, Jack Sparrow would have to contend with Angelica, a woman from his past who may be out to con him, and the fearsome pirate Blackbeard in a Rob Marshall-directed quest to discover the Fountain of Youth. As it turns out, On Stranger Tides is the worst of all the Pirates films, and it made the least amount of money at the box office, but when you consider the performance of the first three installments, which all had diminishing box office returns and got progressively worse, it's not quite so bad. Despite its jumbled plot and overabundance of noisy action sequences, Pirates 4 still earned a worldwide sum of over $1 billion, so if all you needed was a little more Jack Sparrow, this will suit you just fine.</p></br><a href="../users/AUM3YMZ0YRJE0.html">AUM3YMZ0YRJE0</a><br/><p>This is one of those franchises that most parents must tolerate:  it is character-based, the story barely matters, and you either get it or you don't.  To be honest, I never have quite gotten it.  I like the actors very much, esp. Depp, but also the original cast of Rush, Orlando Bloom, and Keira Knightly, etc.  However, I find the plot, the entire concept, extremely lame, kind of an excuse for endless action sequences  that are simply tiring after a while.  The visual effects didn't carry it for me either.<br /><br />OK, Depp has a map of the Fountain of Youth.  Add to the intrigue an old lover of his, the amazing Penelope Cruz as well as Blackbeard, played by the wonderful Ian McShane.  Again, these are first rate actors.  So what happens?  They find it, with all sorts of sword fights, and sirens added into the mix, including Spanish Catholic fanatics who want to end all this pagan business.  It is an absolutely incoherent mess.  Nothing is believable, even my son barely laughed while maintaining that he liked it, and it fails to advance whatever the base story line is.<br /><br />I think this is a complete failure, merely trying to give more of the same to viewers who will pay.  I can't believe it is a Disney thing, which is unusually successful at adding magic to traditional stories or creating them.  Perhaps others that are better will follow, particularly with the ending and all the threads left hanging from the original trilogy.  But really, why bother?</p></br><a href="../users/A2INL3AYAT6325.html">A2INL3AYAT6325</a><br/><p>Well, here I go again with the comments I have been forced to input since fall 2009.<br /><br />What is Disney thinking?  This Release ONLY blu-ray packages BUT we DVD people have to sit & wait for that package?<br /><br />Terrible.  I hope Disney loses a lot of money again because of this idiot choice.<br />I can NOT afford regular DVD's, how can I afford blu-rays?<br /><br />The film is decent.  Jumps around is she or isn't she with Cruz.  At least she can say she has a hit box office movie now.<br /><br />The changing of the Rush's character.  Been in all the films but they keep messing with the character.  And, his character was not even spoken of on the promotional part on the DVD case.<br /><br />It is okay to surprise your audience, but the story jumps EVERY TWO SECONDS get to be a bit much.<br /><br />Johnny can do the Jack character in his sleep.  Bringing Keith Richards back for a cameo.  Only other past character coming back was Gibbs.<br /><br />Now, this LAME, CHEAP BLU-RAY PACKAGE.<br />Yep, I paid an expensive amount of money for a OLD DAYS BUT NOT FOR DISNEY PLAIN SILVER DVD & A COLORFUL FRISBEE.<br /><br />Back when DVD's came out in the late 1990's remember Disney films had colorful discs.  BUT EVERYONE IS DOING BLU-RAY DISNEY.  Does anyone think Walt would have allowed there cheap looking DVD's to be released if he was still alive?  No, I do NOT think so.<br /><br />How about these plastic cases WITH THE INTENTIONAL HOLES IN THEM.  CHEAP, CHEAP, CHEAP. So discs can be damaged SO YOU ARE FORCED TO BUY ANOTHER.<br /><br />No chapter list, any information on the film.<br /><br />Film is fine, best of course is still the 2003 original.  But, DISNEY DVD PEOPLE ARE STILL OUT HERE SO RELEASE THEM PROPERLY & STOP THE CUTTING OF CORNERS.</p></br><a href="../users/A2AK7ZFKW08HID.html">A2AK7ZFKW08HID</a><br/><p>Johnny Depp is back as Captain Jack Sparrow and he does a terrific job as usual. This movie was alot easier to follow than at worlds end was. This made it alot easier to just enjoy the movie. Now the 3D was not all that spectacular, that is why I only gave it 4 stars. If it would of had better 3D effects 5 stars no doubt.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AFXJ8U72MD6L.html">A1AFXJ8U72MD6L</a><br/><p>Better than 3, maybe 2 but not 1 of the series. Most of the old gang is back and this time they're seeking the Fountain of Youth but lots of other parties are involved in the mad race to this mythical location. Depp is his usual Captain Jack Sparrow, Rush is a bit more refined but still a rascal underneath it all and Ian McShane gets a nice introduction. Penelope Cruz may have been the weakest of the main stars and somebody should have given her some more practice with a sword because she just didn't look right. That said, it's a romanticized version of the life of a pirate so you have to sort of take it all in good fun. The tale was well constructed and better than most blockbuster films. Believe it or not models with natural curves were brought in to play the mermaids, including Gemma Ward as their creepy leader. The latter half was a lot more interesting than the first half. Inspired by a Tim Power's novel. Apparently it was Depp's idea to have the Spanish follow the protagonists in the tale but don't worry the writers did their share of the work. As usual for a blockbuster that does well the critics mostly slammed it and once again show they aren't in touch with the masses. The cost of this film was somewhere between 150-250M but it made over $1B at the box office. STORY/PLOTTING: B plus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE (based on archetypes): B plus; SPECIAL EFFECTS/ACTION: A minus; WHEN WATCHED: today; OVERALL GRADE: B plus. BEST DIALOGUE: Jack Sparrow: [to Angelica] I thought I should give you warning. We're taking the ship. It's nothing personal. /// Angelica: You were the only pirate I thought I could get away with. Jack Sparrow: That is NOT a compliment. // Captain Teague: I heard where you're headed. The Fountain. Jack Sparrow: Have you been there?<br />Captain Teague: Does this face looks like it's been to the Fountain of Youth? Jack Sparrow: ...Depends on the light. /// Angelica: Admit it, Jack. You still love me. Jack Sparrow: If you had a sister and a dog... I'd choose the dog. /// Jack Sparrow: [to king George II] You seem somewhat familiar. Have I threatened you before? //// Angelica: I love you Jack [Leans in to Kiss] Jack Sparrow: [Just about to kiss] I have to go [leaves]</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>Part Four of the Disney money soup and the concept keeps riding high. Not a whole lot of story here, this version is more just allowing a group of terrific actors to strut their stuff in hilarious semi-drag and play it for what it was meant to be - Disney entertainment.  Johnny Depp continues to be the raison d'etre for the project and he is in fine form with antics that include a lot of sword play and harrowing escapes, and yet all the while maintaining that inimitable twinkle of the eye that makes these films fly.<br /><br />Some new folk are around - Pen&eacute;lope Cruz is lovely and lush but without a whole lot to do in this search for Ponce de Leon's site of the Fountain of Youth.  Ian McShane is the peg-legged Blackbeard, Geofffrey Rush hams it up as Barbossa,  and Richard Griffiths has a terrific time as the blubbery old fop King George - a role that deserves some awards for best supporting actor.  The show is mighty and loud - Hans Zimmer's musical score drowns out most of the dialogue, but then that is no great problem as the dialogue is secondary to the action.  In all this is a rather long in the tooth production, but with the likes of Johnny Depp having the obvious raging good time it is entertaining.  Keep lots of popcorn handy....Grady Harp, October 11</p></br><a href="../users/A2OCJNB6B46OKP.html">A2OCJNB6B46OKP</a><br/><p>After 7 years we return back to the days of Captain Jack Sparrow and the swashbuckling mayhem of Pirates of the Caribbean. Under new leadership of Rob Marshal and replacing Orlando Bloom & Kiera Knightly (For now) with Ian McShane & Penelope Cruz it makes for another action packed, laugh filled Pirates adventure.<br /><br />Simply put, if you have seen the first 3 and you liked the first 3, then 'On Stranger Tides' will be movie you will like as well. I was glad that they went back to the first film and realized that a simple easy to follow story is better than something overly complicated. Having Johnny Depp & Geoffrey Rush do what they do best as Jack and Barbosa, it's a winner. Still, the fact that it is just another 'Pirates of the Caribbean', well it may not always be a good thing.<br /><br />So apparently there will be a possible Pirates 5 & 6 as a "New Trilogy" I am wondering where the next adventure will be.</p></br><a href="../users/A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ.html">A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ</a><br/><p>To be honest, the movie bored me.  Sure, there is "action" in nearly every other scene, but it's all incredibly predictable from beginning to end.  On top of that, Johnny Depp's mannerisms as Capt. Jack Sparrow have grown old, and Penelope Cruz is not a suitable replacement for Keira Knightley.  Not by a long shot.  Aside from Cruz, the usually cast is there: Geoffrey Rush as Barbarossa, Ian McShane as Blackbeard, the monkey as the monkey.<br /><br />Did I mention this film is roughly 43 hours long?  Well, maybe not that long, but that's how long it feels.  Honestly, how many sword fights, ridiculously complex escape plans, and identical score accompaniment can there be?  It's a revolving door of POTC, with only minor additions - some of which are subtraction by addition.  For instance, there is a mannequin missionary portrayed with concrete-settling zeal by Sam Claflin, and let's not forget Oscar Jaenada as "The Spaniard," a character so stiff it made Barbarossa's wooden run (hop) a mile.<br /><br />The plot revolves around Sparrow and an imposter Sparrow, who is rounding up a crew, meeting up and butting heads while mutually racing, along with the Spaniards, for the legendary Fountain of Youth.  The aforementioned paths' also cross with a British ship captained by a semi-reformed Barbarossa, and Queen Anne's Revenge, captained by Blackbeard and Sparrow's former lover Angelica - who may or may not be Blackbeard's daughter.<br /><br />Long title, long film.  Nothing terribly new for the series, and only fans will like it a lot.  Fans of the purely aesthetic will appreciate the filming.  Some very majestic scenes on open water.  Fans of the series will probably love it.  Pirate fans will hang the movie posters in their spare rooms.  If you're not in those groups, however, it will feel recycled no matter how much misdirection and subplot is involved.<br /><br />(Note: Review title is a nod to the classic Monty Python skit and relates to this movie in a semi-specific manner.)</p></br><a href="../users/AHIK7BUXFRMT8.html">AHIK7BUXFRMT8</a><br/><p>Much has been written and reviewed concerning the movie so I decided to limit my review to the new Blu-ray five disc release package. It is outstanding and completely satisfying on many levels. It includes the 3D and the 2D Blu-ray versions, a special features Blu-ray disc, a DVD version and a digital copy version. There's enough in this package to satisfy almost anyone who has an interest in the franchise.<br /><br />The 3D effects are rather modest but provide an interesting alternative for those who have taken the step into 3D. The picture and the sound are both first class; the movie features dts HD Master Audio 7.1 and the surround speakers are given a serious workout as is the subwoofer. There is an interesting surprise awaiting those who decided to watch all the way to the end of the credits; don't miss out on this one.<br /><br />Another very gratifying plus is the use of dts HD Master Audio 5.1 on the Bonus Disc; not only is the picture 1080P but it features an aggressive sound package which gives all of the speakers a good workout. The bonus features are interesting and well done; they're fun to watch.<br /><br />I have found this to be a lot of entertainment for the money; even at the somewhat higher price being charged I felt I got good value. When you divide the cost by five you find out it's a remarkable deal.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>You've got to hand it to Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio. They are a winning team of writers with a pretty good resume of flicks that they've combined on. They did <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0054K8JSG">the first three Pirates movies</a> and are together again for 2011's Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides. Some of the key characters from the predecessors are gone and some are are back in Stranger Tides...while director Gore Verbinski is out and Rob Marshall is in. Together the cast and crew still manage to keep the franchise alive and entertaining<br /><br />The special effects are great. The movies are visually spectacular with realistic looking at-sea adventure featuring legendary pirates, ghosts, sea monsters and now mermaids...I'd say the amazing effects actually contribute a full star to all of the Pirates movies in this series. There's lots of silliness in the Pirates movies, but it's deliberate. There's slapstick. There are death-defying feats. There's Johnny Depp (Captain Jack Sparrow) doing his best imitation of Keith Richards (true factoid, he has publicly commented that Richards is his Jack Sparrow character persona inspiration...and by now everyone knows who notice who plays Captain Teague, right?). And all the silliness mostly works. After all, this is Disney and indeed supposed to be a movie for kids too, no?<br /><br />I find it amazing that On Stranger Tides alone has grossed over $1,000,000,000 (that's a BILLION dollars according to Box Office Mojo). It's a good movie that kids can watch too so that's certainly a recipe for success. But a billion dollars?!? Wow. On Stranger Tides, At World's End and Dead Man's Chest are more between a 3 and 4 star rating than the solid 4 star that Curse of the Black Pearl would earn alone. But numbers don't lie. People are drawn to this franchise. I am drawn to this franchise. So bottom line: all four movies offer like 9 hours of time that can be spent nuzzling up with your kids.<br /><br />No, this franchise's ship has not sailed...yet. It continues to please audiences and of course carries an ending that suggests that it has at least one more life left in it. Hence, my recommendation: Add the Pirates series to your cart (and hope that it doesn't take another 4 years for the next installment).</p></br><a href="../users/A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO.html">A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO</a><br/><p>Pirates of the Caribbean:On Stranger Tides(released May/11)is a welcome comeback for the franchise,which had bogged down in the second film,and started a slow climb up in the third;but not reaching quite up to the scale of the first film or this one.This one finds Depp firmly back in Sparrows character with all the "isms" he can muster,with a nicely edited and fast moving piece. .<br />The plot finds Sparrow in London and his first mate Joshamee Gibbs (Kevin McNally)has been mistakenly dragged into court to face charges as...Jack Sparrow.The presiding judge is none other than the real Sparrow and he sentences his first mate to life in prison.In a typical switcharoo Sparrow accompanies his first mate as they are taken to prison,but when they arrive it seems they are both sentenced to die.Sparrow is brought before King George II(Richard Griffiths),who wants him to accompany his old nemesis Hector Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush),to find the fabled fountain of youth(remember that compass from the last film?).Sparrow will have none of it and slips away from the crowded room.During his escapes he briefly runs into his father who gives him warnings re the fountain of youth and about an imposter of him that is trying to put a crew together.Sparrow ends up at a tavern and he meets his imposter,one Angelica(Pen&eacute;lope Cruz),who he deflowered in a convent years before and had not seen since.She claims she is the daughter of the infamous pirate Blackbeard,and before you can say Black Pearl,he is waylayed and brought on board Blackbeards ship.Back at the prison Barbarossa forces Sparrows first mate into servitude aboard his ship,as Gibbs also knows the location of the magical waters.<br />No one has seen Blackbeard,so Sparrow instigates a mutiny on his ship.He almost succeeds until Blackbeard appears before the crew and stops the mutiny in its tracks.With things settled into a manor more sided towards Blackbeard's purposes,the ship sails to find a mermaid from which its tears may be extracted,and Ponce de Leon's ship and the two chalices on board.Barbarossa is sailing also for the fountain but with a different purpose.It was Blackbeard that took the Black Pearl away from him and forced Barbarossa to cut his own leg off to save his life;so revenge,not youth,is on his mind.Add to all this the Spanish,who are also intent on finding the fountain,but again cross purposes to Blackbeard and Barbarossa;to destroy the fountain which is blasphemous to them and their Catholic beliefs.<br />Blackbeard captures a mermaid for her tears after a drawn and bloody battle.When they reach the land of the fountain,a decided impasse in the form of a cavernous ravine appears before them,at the bottom of which is a fast flowing river.Blackbeard forces Sparrow to jump into the water to search for Ponce De Leon's ship and the chalices.Jack finds the ship and Barbarossa;who has beat him to it.The ship sits on the edge of a cliff and they must both do a balancing act to get the cups.But they find the Spanish have beaten them to the punch.<br />Sparrow and Barbarossa raid the Spanish encampment and steal the cups.Jack and Barbarossa agree to work together to defeat Blackbeard.Sparrow returns with cups and takes Blackbeard to the fountain.Before long Barbarossa enters the picture,then the Spanish.A drawn and drag em out fight ensues with the Spanish trashing the fountain,Barabrossa getting his revenge on Blackbeard and Jack using the fountain to save Angelca's life.<br />Sparrow however strands Angelica on a desert island,Barbarossa returns to pirating on Blackbeards ship and Jack and his first mate start looking for a way to get the Black Pearl,in glass jar from Blackbeards ship,out of its prison.The film fades out as a voodoo doll of Jack,which Blackbeard had made,floats into the possession of a smiling Angelica.<br />Fast paced,well acted and scripted,the film is filled with Sparrow-isms and good doses of comedy.It is what made the first film so successful and I'm glad they have returned to this way of doing Pirates,once more.<br />Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:40:1 and is clear and crisp.The only extras are commentary and deleted scenes.<br />A highly recommended fourth installment in the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise.Its pace and sense of humour harkens back to the first one,taking most of its good,and dispensing with most of the bad.4-4 1/2 stars.</p></br></body></html>

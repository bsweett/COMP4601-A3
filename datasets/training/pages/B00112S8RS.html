Maybe my memory is incorrect, but it seems to me that there should have been some nominations here for Finney, Hoffman and possibly Hawke.  Their performances were as strong and emotional as any that were given last year.  Hoffman's meltdown in his car with his wife beside him, after a funeral, hits you right in the gut.<br /><br />Perhaps it's the small scale, intimate nature of the film that kept audiences away.  It's not a sweeping gangster epic with "stars" in it; instead, it's a poignant, painful, wrenching story of two brothers who need money so desperately that they decide to steal from their own parents.  They try to rationalize it--no one is supposed to get hurt, the business is insured, etc.--but as is often the case, the robbery goes horribly and tragically wrong and they must deal with repercussions and damages they had never anticipated.<br /><br />What's especially interesting is the director's narrative style here, going back and forth from the days before the robbery to the day it occurs to the days afterwards; and the revisiting and expanding on certain scenes from different angles and from different characters' perspectives.  It is done in such a way that it is not at all confusing for the viewer.<br /><br />Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>Before the Devil Knows You're Dead is a well acted and scripted story, but you might find it hard to ever watch again due to it's depressing nature (worth a rental for sure). The cast is very good across the board, with Philip Seymour Hoffman being the absolute standout. I'm really surprised he got an Oscar nomination for Charlie Wilson's War instead of this movie, though he was good in that one as well. The storyline does jump back and forth quite a bit, but not in a confusing way. I really just liked how one simple plan turned into something sinister that just kept getting worse and worse until the fitting end.</p></br><a href="../users/A153NZD2WZN5S3.html">A153NZD2WZN5S3</a><br/><p>Is this movie about non-grateful sons or selfish parents sleeping on money might then go to hell but making their closest relatives, offspring no bit happy?<br /><br />Sex is awful and film is long and boring colapsed in a drama must and could be avoided in less goods-rich but more spiritually abundant families.</p></br><a href="../users/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ.html">A12X2J7AVZ04IQ</a><br/><p>The amazing career of Sidney Lumet is Hollywood legend, and at age 82, he's as fresh as ever. He's transcended the current trends, whether the "in your face" drama of the 50's (12 Angry Men), faithful adaptations of great plays (Long Day's Journey into Night), powerful irony of the 70's (Network), and now the popular and effective "flash-back" ideas of the 2000's. Each one is character driven to the max, and his choice of actors is always right-on. p>"Before the Devil Knows You're Dead" is a riveting account, thanks to writer Kelly Masterson, and a brilliant cast led by P.S. Hoffman, Ethan Hawke, Marisa Tomei, Albert Finney, and ALL involved. Mr. Lumet controls the mayhem with a sure hand and total understanding of his material. That this film was totally ignored at the Oscars escapes me, though many critics included this in their Top 10 list, not to mention a few that gave it Best Ensemble Cast recognition. The editing is exceptional. p>The DVD is fine, with some good extras and a great commentary from Messrs. Lumet, Hoffman & Hawke. Definitely worth a look.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>"May you be in heaven half an hour...before the Devil knows you're dead." Thus begins the 45th film of Sidney Lumet's 60-year directing career, a New York crime drama with an intimate feel and a gamut of emotions. Andy Hanson (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is an upper-middle class executive living beyond his means. His brother Hank (Ethan Hawke) is a working class divorc&eacute; with burdensome child support payments. They both need money in a hurry. The cooler Andy cajoles the malleable Hank into robbing their parents suburban jewelry store. And one disaster leads to another.<br /><br />"Before the Devil Knows You're Dead" shows us the robbery first, then jumps back in time to what led to it. The mystery is not who committed the crime, but why. We see the days leading up to the robbery more than once, but nothing is actually repeated, as we are seeing events from different perspectives. Then it is forward in time, to the aftermath. The story is told through conversations in closed spaces, which create an accelerating sense of the world caving in on Andy and Hank, a downward spiral from which they try to escape with increasing desperation.<br /><br />Sidney Lumet was quick to label this film a "melodrama", and if viewers take it any other way, credibility will be strained. People tend to think of melodrama as something that goes over the top, leaving the audience either laughing or dozing off out of incredulity. That's melodrama done badly. I'm a huge fan of the crime thrillers and murder dramas of the 1940s that came to be known as "film noir". They're about extremes of behavior. Pure melodrama. They succeeded because they were introverted, and the actors emoted as little as possible. They barely moved their facial muscles.<br /><br />Ever since more histrionic styles of acting came into fashion in the 1970s, melodrama has been a risky undertaking. Bizarre behavior and emoting are a dicey combination. Performances can easily slip into the realm of the ridiculous. This happens a few times in "Before the Devil Knows You're Dead", but the mundanity always overcomes the melodrama. The film grounds itself in constant reminders of just how mundane it all is. The score and all the little middle class details tell us how ordinary these lives are, even as they are flipping out. So we can enjoy the fireworks without questioning the behavior.<br /><br />The DVD (ThinkFilm 2008): There is a featurette, a theatrical trailer, and an audio commentary. '"Directed by Sidney Lumet: How the Devil Was Made" (24 min) interviews Sidney Lumet, actors Philip Seymour Hoffman, Ethan Hawke, and Marisa Tomei, and producers Michael Cerenzie and Brian Linse, about the script, melodrama, Lumet's directing style and rehearsal process. The feature commentary is with Sidney Lumet, Philip Seymour Hoffman, and Ethan Hawke. In a friendly tone, they discuss shooting in HD, working with familiar New York actors, casting, and provide some scene-by-scene commentary. Subtitles are available for the film in English SDH and Spanish.</p></br><a href="../users/A25QJBK33C4O0R.html">A25QJBK33C4O0R</a><br/><p>I went into watching this film having remembered that it was talked about as a possible award winner for some of the persons involved, but was left disappointed in a film that was too predictable and relied too much on a story-telling device that just didn't work that well for me.<br /><br />Don't misunderstand, I enjoy non-linear story-telling when it makes sense, and I've thoroughly enjoyed some films that others felt went on far too long (see Taratino's Jackie Brown as an example in that area), telling the tale too many times and from too many different angles (perhaps), but this film, Before the Devil Knows You're Dead, just isn't as good despite decent performance from the actors and actresses involved.  Where I should have been surprised by twists, I was left nodding my head at how things were just as I expected and predicted.  Seeing parts of the story told again and again, just from different perspectives, just seemed to be a waste of screen time for this film and that is disappointing to me.  I didn't necessarily expect more, but still felt disappointed by not finding it in the film.<br /><br />Sidney Lumet has done great work in the past and I don't think he did horribly here, but it's far from his best.  Though the product description calls this as a suspense thriller and it tries to deliver, it seemed lacking in that area for me because it was too easy to anctipate what was coming next.  Oh, there are a few twists, but those twists burn quickly and barely raise the interest that they should.<br /><br />The film is worth seeing, but it isn't a film that would be interesting to watch multiple times, leaving the value as a potential purchase lacking.  It is a dark film and is depressing.  A crime gone wrong with horrible consequences and a look at the events leading up to and after the crime all played out several times just so we can be sure we didn't miss something along the way.  When all is said and done, there are other films that do a better job for me (though I'm hard pressed to think of exactly which films those would be at the moment), and certainly other films that make good use of the actors that worked here.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ARRAMXWT83PT.html">A2ARRAMXWT83PT</a><br/><p>Excellent! One of the best films of the year. You can't take your eyes off of it. Totally riveting from start to finish! The performances are spectacular all around, the direction is flawless, the writing - AMAZING! One of Lumet's best films since "Dog Day Afternoon". Talk about a robbery gone wrong...geez.<br /><br />There aren't enough words to describe it, you just have to see it. NOW.<br /><br />Oh, yeah...the sex scene at the beginning is both pointless AND disgusting. There was NO NEED for that. Buhhhh.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DHQ5WO80X1IZ.html">A3DHQ5WO80X1IZ</a><br/><p>First off, any movie that has Marisa Tomei naked in three different scenes automatically gets four stars. However, this movie is even better than that! It's incredible that the guy who made movies like '12 Angry Men', 'Serpico', 'Dog Day Afternoon', 'Network' and 'The Verdict', can actually come out with one of his best at age 83. This is a great crime drama about a heist where everything goes wrong. But it's not really a heist movie, that's just the outline for the in-depth character studies. Philip Seymour Hoffman is his usual amazing self, Ethan Hawke matches him as his brother; Marisa Tomei is hotter than ever (did I mention that she gets naked? three times?), and does a good job playing Hoffman's depressive wife. Albert Finney is Oscar-worthy as their father, and there's even a small role for Amy Ryan, who shined in the movie I watched the previous evening, 'Gone Baby Gone'. One of Sidney Lumet's best movies, and that's really saying something.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VABWDOUQLULZ.html">A1VABWDOUQLULZ</a><br/><p>Everything about this film was well done except the plot.  The situation was relatable, the acting superb, the direction clear albeit nonlinear.  The story was thought-provoking if not eerily recursive.  However, once the secret is out the momentum dropped drastically.

Consider for starters - Henry Fonda's lone dissenting juror in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010YSD7W">12 Angry Men</a>, Katharine Hepburn's delusional Mary Tyrone in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001US6DM">Long Day's Journey Into Night</a>, Rod Steiger's conflicted concentration camp survivor in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000EYUES">The Pawnbroker</a>, William Holden's wintry lion in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CNESU8">Network</a>, and Paul Newman's alcoholic lawyer in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000O77SPY">The Verdict</a>. The list encompasses some of the finest screen work of the past half-century, and you can safely add Philip Seymour Hoffman's desperately controlling Andy Hanson to the ranks. At 83, director Sidney Lumet shows no signs of octogenarian fatigue, and in fact, he revels in the melodramatic turns of first-time screenwriter Kelly Masterson's thickly plotted script.<br /><br />The scale of the story is deceptively small as it focuses on the moral compromises that unravel in a family where two brothers have become desperate for immediate cash. Woody Allen followed a similar fraternal dynamic in his last film, the oddly pinched <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013D8LC2">Cassandra's Dream</a>, but Lumet is neither pinched nor cautious in his fierce approach to this inescapable tale of ambiguity and deception. The plot revolves around a crime that was meant to be victimless. Embezzling funds from his real estate company's payroll to keep his neglected wife Gina happy and to satisfy an expensive drug habit, smooth-talking Andy is about to be exposed in an IRS audit. Meanwhile, his younger brother Hank is a mass of post-divorce, codependent insecurities falling way behind in his alimony and child support payments.<br /><br />Andy concocts a supposedly foolproof plan to rob their parents' suburban jewelry store while neither of them is supposed to be there. The goal was for the brothers to collect the haul and the parents to claim the insurance. Murphy's Law intervenes in every possible way starting with Andy pressuring Hank to do the job himself. After some brotherly cajoling, Hank agrees to it, but too scared to do it alone, he recruits a reckless, gun-toting busboy to handle the robbery. By fate, the heist occurs on the one day that Andy and Hank's mother is opening the shop, and things quickly spiral out of control from there. Although the back-and-forth storytelling technique is not new (for example, Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001CNRRU">21 Grams</a> comes to mind), Masterson's approach works effectively in delineating certain events from multiple perspectives so that you understand how each character is led to the repercussions of the unfortunate event.<br /><br />The acting is pitch-perfect starting with Hoffman's riveting performance as Andy, a Machiavellian reptile whose cool exterior and innate amorality mask layers of resentment toward his family. I thought he was great in Tamara Jenkins' <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014GI6I2">The Savages</a>, but he is even better here. Lumet even draws a solid performance from the usually insufferable Ethan Hawke as Hank, imbuing him with the emasculated weakness that informs his every ill-planned move. As their embattled father, Albert Finney acts with his typical late-career bluster, but he provides the necessary foundation for the Oedipal-level complexities. Marisa Tomei is a smart choice to play Gina, as the actress economically keys in on the responsive, watchful nature of a small but pivotal role. The estimable theater veteran Rosemary Harris (now better known as Peter Parker's aunt in the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UR9T82">Spider-Man</a> trilogy) has precious little time as the mother, as does Amy Ryan as Hank's bitter ex-wife.<br /><br />There are scenes that border on excess, especially as the situation becomes increasingly desperate for the brothers, but the principals inject such energetic brio to them that the flourishes become forgivable. After the disappointment of the cartoonish <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FFJ826">Find Me Guilty</a>, it is refreshing to see Lumet in peak form here. The 2008 DVD offers terrifically informative commentary from Lumet, Hoffman and Hawke, all of whom converse with ease and insight throughout. Along with the original theatrical trailer, there is also a better-than-average 24-minute featurette, "Directed by Sidney Lumet: How the Devil Was Made", which features on-set footage and snippets of interviews with Lumet, two of the producers and the principal actors.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GCHG6U8HTVIT.html">A2GCHG6U8HTVIT</a><br/><p>The contradictions, and especially the indulgences, in Sidney Lumet's Before the Devil Knows Your Dead are queasily evident in the first and last scenes. In the first, which pops up as soon as the lights dim, we have a nude, pale, flabbily fat actor doing Pin the Tail on the Donkey with a nude actress on her knees, hips high, in front of him. The only image that came to mind was of a quivering Moby Dick throwing the harpoon at Mrs. Ahab.<br /><br />The last scene -- spoilers alert! -- gives us an old man who had to study like a son of a gun just to pass his written driver's test suddenly smart and clever enough to know how to fake out a heart monitor machine in a busy hospital so he could smother to death a gunshot victim and not be caught.<br /><br />In between these two points are the bones of a hard-edged story of unlikable people that could have been a classic. Instead, we admire the potential but are bored by a lot of the show-off flash. Lumet has always had the reputation of an actors' director, a man who can pull great performances from a cast. Actors, in turn, have always been eager to work with Lumet. At least in part, now we know why. Frequently with this movie, the story, the tension and our interest come to a screeching halt when Lumet permits Philip Seymore Hoffman as Andy to plunge headfirst into "acting"...or to permit Ethan Hawke as Hank to plunge headfirst into "acting"...or to permit the two of them to share intense scenes of "acting," all the while with the camera respectfully observing the performances. Only a disciplined director able to impose his will on actors will be able to convince most actors that less is more. It seldom happens here, and the movie -- despite the potential for classic unhappiness and despite scenes of real tension -- winds up as self-conscious melodrama. This is a frustrating situation because Hoffman is riveting at times as a slick, sick manipulator whose life for quite a while has been on the down escalator. Hawke as Andy's shlumpf of a younger brother is stuck in a losing role as an unsympathetic weakling. Albert Finney as their father, who, with his adored wife, owns a small jewelry store, does Albert Finney again. To give him credit, he picks up steam when his character decides to be the avenging angel.<br /><br />It's Andy's plan to rob his parents' store that goes bad, but it's Hoffman's indulged acting, approved by Lumet, that's the real crime. Even some of the secondary actors, particularly Michael Shannon as Dex, over emote...and actors playing secondary characters wouldn't do that without the specific encouragement of the director. Rosemary Harris, as the two brothers' mother and Finney's wife, does the real acting. Harris is one of the great actresses of the American and British stage (and the mother of Jennifer Ehle). Her role is brief, just two real scenes. One shows her affection for her aging husband and the other as the frightened victim of the robbery who decides to resist. Harris knows the value of less is more. She gives to a small part real strength and motivation, and makes Finney's motivation for revenge believable. The irony is that while many movie fans will be thrilled by Hoffman's performance, most probably won't even notice how good Harris is or even recognize her name.<br /><br />Lumet must have been aiming for tragic drama but he wound up with the Hollywood version. This was a real disappoint for me because I have a lot of respect for Lumet and for a number of his actors.</p></br><a href="../users/AJRFZ0VZ0LD26.html">AJRFZ0VZ0LD26</a><br/><p>The storytelling in this film is worth comparing to a modern Shakespeare.  This is not just some sort of tragedy.  This is a tragedy of gigantic proportions.  We see fantastic cast of actors (Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Ethan Hawke, Marisa Tomei and Albert Finney) assembled in this sad family saga.  Two brothers, one seemingly well off and married to a beautiful woman and the other a complete loser without career, money and divorced, agree to commit "victimless crime" by robbing their parent's jewelry store.  The idea is that the insurance would cover the loss of the jewelry that is estimated to $500,000-$600,000 value. Brothers would take care of their financial responsibilites and start their lives fresh.  At least that is the plan, until everything not only fails but spirals down with dizzing velocity.  I have not seen film this good since "All the King's Men" came out couple of years ago.  This film will shake you in more ways than one.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MNMZMM6BGLTA.html">A2MNMZMM6BGLTA</a><br/><p>I found this movie to be very disappointing.

Ethan Hawke has not grown as all as an actor and I think he is pretty poor. Marisa Tomei was naked in the movie, that is the best I can say for it and I find her to be a poor actress as well.

That was a visual treat!  The rest of the movie was nothing short of painful for me; vile, despicable, unlikable characters taking us through a truly uninteresting story of two poor excuses for brothers who decide to rob their own parent's jewelry store (the locale of the store that was supposed to be Westchester was actually Bayside, Queens).  Of course, the robbery goes wrong and blood is spilled.<br /><br />I usually enjoy robbery/heist movies, provided the crime is perpetrated by somewhat intelligent and likeable characters.  Not ONE performer in this film is capable of providing either trait.<br /><br />Despite this horrible viewing experience, I will try my best to remember that Sidney Lumet is still a legendary director who is responsible for films like 12 ANGRY MEN, SERPICO, MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS, DOG DAY AFTERNOON, NETWORK and PRINCE OF THE CITY.</p></br><a href="../users/A10E3F50DIUJEE.html">A10E3F50DIUJEE</a><br/><p>I am surprised how highly praised this film is ... I thought it was bad.  Shockingly bad because there are so many great actors in this film: Philip Seymour Hoffman, Ethan Hawke, Albert Finney, and even a little Rosemary Harris.<br /><br />It was weird, yet intriguing in its stylized design.  The family dynamic was also interesting to watch as it unfolded.  But you could never truly connect to these characters or their problems, because you never truly understood them.  The scenes are just short snippets.  Even so, this is not a flaw, but rather just a detached film.<br /><br />The plot is weak; leading me to believe the dynamic style was an attempt to cover up a rather mundane, short, predictable film.  Two brothers plot to rob their parent's suburban shopping mall jewelry store, when things suddenly fall apart.  The rest of the film is a flashback/forward of each character's take on the robbery, its precedents, and its aftermath.  The acting is not necessarily bad, but it definitely is not good.  Ethan Hawke and Philip Seymour Hoffman do a convincing job, but they cannot save this hopeless film.<br /><br />Marisa Tomei is a huge disappointment.  Apparently this was a low budget film because there was not enough money to buy her a decent wardrobe (she likes to spend several prolonged, and unnecessary scenes naked or nearly so).  What happened to her career?  This is a sad film for her most of all.  Unless you really like one of these actors, or love Sidney Lumet, I would not waste your time on this film.  Truly disappointed.</p></br><a href="../users/A3QJU4FEN8PQSZ.html">A3QJU4FEN8PQSZ</a><br/><p>Warning! THIS IS NOT A "THRILLER"!

First time screenwriter Kelly Masterson (with some modifications by director Sidney Lumet) has concocted a melodrama that explores just how fragmented a family can become when external forces drive the members to unthinkable extremes. In this film the viewer is allowed to witness the gradual but nearly complete implosion of a family by a much used but, here, very sensible manipulation of the flashback/flash forward  technique of storytelling.  By repeatedly offering the differing vantages of each of the characters about the central incidents that drive this rather harrowing tale, we see all the motivations of the players in this case of a robbery gone very wrong.<br /><br />Andy Hanson (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is a wealthy executive, married to an emotionally needy Gina (Marisa Tomei), and addicted to an expensive drug habit.  His life is beginning to crumble and he needs money.  Andy's ne're-do-well younger brother Hank (Ethan Hawke) is a life in ruins - he is divorced from his shrewish wife Martha (Amy Ryan), is behind in alimony and child support, and has borrowed all he can from his friends, and he needs money.  Andy proposes a low-key robbery of a small mall mom-and-pop jewelry store that promises safe, quick cash for both. The glitch is that the jewelry story belongs to the men's parents - Charles (Albert Finney) and Nanette (Rosemary Harris). Andy advances Hank some cash and wrangles an agreement that Hank will do the actual robbery, but though Hank agrees to the 'fail-safe' plan, he hires a friend to take on the actual job while Hank plans to be the driver of the getaway car. The robbery is horribly botched when Nanette, filing in for the regular clerk, shoots the robber and is herself shot in the mess.  The disaster unveils many secrets about the fragile relationships of the family and when Nanette dies, Charles and Andy and Hank (and their respective partners) are driven to disastrous ends with surprises at every turn.<br /><br />Each of the actors in this strong but emotionally acrid film gives superb performances, and while we have come to expect that from Hoffman, Hawke, Tomei, Finney, Ryan, and Harris, it is the wise hand of direction from Sidney Lumet that make this film so unforgettably powerful. It is not an easy film to watch, but it is a film that allows some bravura performances that demand our respect, a film that reminds us how fragile many families can be. Grady Harp, April 08</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZLROGIL2V7GV.html">A2ZLROGIL2V7GV</a><br/><p>"Before the Devil Knows You're Dead" is one of the best movies to come out of 2007.  It's involving, thrilling and even at times terrifying to see how normal everyday people can do terrible and unimaginable things.  It's also a film that shows you that nothing is ever simple and even what seems to be the most simple or "victimless" crime can lead to devastating consequences that can shatter lives.<br /><br />"Victimless."  That's exactly the term Andy uses when he explains to his brother how they can get some easy cash.  Both are in desperate need of money.  Andy says that there is a solution to all of their problems, and that is to hit a mom-and-pop jewelery store that they both know very well.  No guns will be used.  No cops will be called.  And most importantly, nobody will get hurt.  How can it go wrong?  Very wrong, that's how.  Wrong as in that people do get hurt and that the aftermath can lead to the destruction of an already damaged family in the gripping melodrama that goes to show you just how evil the world can be sometimes.<br /><br />Not a moment went by where I didn't find myself hooked.  Not a minute went by where I could predict what was going to happen next.  That's a real treat when you are in the presence of a confident film that won't resort to the usual cliches or predictable twists and turns.  The writing and performances are outstanding.  Phillip Seymour Hoffman gives one of his best and darkest performances as a man who can be so manipulative and cold, yet you sense that there is a longing for love and acceptance that he has inside of him that wasn't shown to him when he was younger.  Ethan Hawke, Marisa Tomei and Albert Finney are also terrific and deserve high praises.<br /><br />There is a risk that comes with a film like this, and that is the fact that there will be a lot of people who won't like it.  It's very dark, depressing and even gives you a sense of hopelessness that things can ever be good for these characters.  But, because this movie is so well executed, it makes you want to take the trip even if it's not a joyful one.  The DVD includes cast and crew commentary, a theatrical trailer and a making of featurette.<br /><br />I have seen this film many times now, and it never loses its power and emotion for me.  True, "Before the Devil Knows You're Dead" is not for everybody, but it is a remarkable film that deserves to be seen.  If you're looking for a crime story where you actually care about the characters, as flawed as they may be, then this may be the one for you. -Michael Crane</p></br><a href="../users/A4UKBG3M5U5TI.html">A4UKBG3M5U5TI</a><br/><p>"Before the Devil Knows You're Dead" is a tough crime drama that exposes the seamy underbelly of life.  Philip Seymour Hoffman and Ethan Hawke star as an unlikely set of brothers, both of whom are having money problems.  Hoffman devises a plan to help them both get some cash - not surprisingly, the plan turns sour.  The rest of the movie concerns the fallout of their actions.  The plot jumps back and forth in time and is told from multiple perspectives; there are also some nifty plot twists, the biggest of which is revealed very early in the movie.<br /><br />During the 1970s and early 1980s, Sidney Lumet directed a number of great movies focusing on big city corruption (Serpico, Dog Day Afternoon, Network, Prince of the City).  He got off track afterwards, only rarely scoring with a moderate critical hit (Running on Empty, Night Falls on Manhattan).  By returning to his theme of the evil in seemingly good New Yorkers, Lumet rises to his earlier directing glory - "Before the Devil" is easily his best work since 1982's "The Verdict."  He's aided by a stellar cast, which includes Albert Finney and Marisa Tomei, who is so often under-used in films.<br /><br />Many of the biggest critical hits of 2007 explored dark themes - "No Country for Old Men," "American Gangster," "Eastern Promises," and "There Will Be Blood."  This film can hold its own against these heavyweights; unfortunately, "Before the Devil" was criminally neglected during awards season, scoring only a few wins from minor film critic societies.  Hopefully on DVD it can reach a far wider audience.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TPW86OHXTXFC.html">A1TPW86OHXTXFC</a><br/><p>"Sidney Lumet's "Before the Devil Knows You're Dead" is such a superb crime melodrama that I almost want to leave it at that. To just stop writing right now and advise you to go out and see it as soon as you can. I so much want to avoid revealing plot points that I don't even want to risk my usual strategy of oblique hints. You deserve to walk into this one cold." Roger Ebert<br /><br />Sidney Lumet at the age of 83 has again directed a film for the ages. A film of a family falling down, round and apart. Philip Seymour Hoffman is amazing as the older brother in the family. He works for a successful real estate office in NYC. His younger bro, Ethan Hawke shows us how very great an actor he can be, and works for the same agency.  The Greek Tragedy begins when a plan to rob a suburban jewelry store goes all wrong.  The mom  and pop of this store are in reality Andy and Hank's parents.  Would you, could you rob your own family? You could if you needed money badly enough it seems.  Andy and Hank are in great need of money. Hoffman as Andy, has a habit that leads him to illegal drugs. Hank Hanson, Ethan Hawke, has a snarly ex-wife who wants her child support and cares naught how Hank gets the money. As Sir Francis Scott has said 'Oh what a tangled web we weave, when first we practice to deceive'.<br /><br />Albert Finney plays Andy and Hank's dad. His fine acting lends this film the reality of the quintessential dysfunctional family. His actions, so akin to a Greek Tragedy seal the fate of this film. The two sons who have always pandered for best loved son, can now give it up. The family relationships are not explained and it is up to us to get to know them. Mom, Rosemary Harris, has a small part but is the agent of change in this film. Marisa Tomei the wife of Andy and lover of Hank, ah, we are beginning to see the light here, plays the tragically ignored wife.<br /><br />"My grandfather, whose background was not so different from Mr. Lumet's, was dismissive of movies that seemed overly dark or despairing. "There wasn't a single decent human being in the whole movie," he used to complain. He might not have found any in "Before the Devil Knows You're Dead," but he would also have recognized the humanism that saves this harsh tale from nihilism. The screen may be full of losers, liars, killers and thieves, but behind the camera is a mensch." A O Scott<br /><br />Messy, emotional, melodramatic, film noir is my beat.

For you fellow fans of old crime novels, this is the kind of story that would be at home in a Jim Thompson, David Goodis, or James M. Cain book.  Flawed characters, broken relationships, hopeless situations, it's all here.<br /><br />To paraphrase director Sidney Lumet in the well-done "making of" featurette on the DVD, "Before the Devil Knows You're Dead" is a classic style melodrama, but with "melodrama" being meant in a complimentary sense.  That is, the film isn't meant to be campy or overacted, just "amped up", depicting people and situations at their various breaking points.<br /><br />Lumet also noted in his comments that good melodramas always have the situations driving the characters, not the characters driving the situations.  That may be true to some extent here (the characters certainly have to react to a lot of intense developments, which serve to reveal their innermost, hidden traits), but their basic personalities certainly influence the events, too.  For example, if Philip Seymour Hoffman's "Andy" character wasn't so cold and calculating, he never would have devised the attempt to rob his parents' jewelry store in the first place, and if Andy's brother wasn't so fearful and jittery (likely due to a lifetime of intimidation by his brother), he never would have brought in his loose-cannon friend to help with the robbery, which of course turned out to be a disastrous move.<br /><br />In any event, this dark, violent, sexy crime tale is strongly recommended for fans of tough crime tales.  Just don't expect hearts and flowers at the end and you'll do just fine.</p></br><a href="../users/A1OBJ2263JCK5.html">A1OBJ2263JCK5</a><br/><p>Every once in awhile, you come apon a film, that just totally blows you away. It's just great from the very first scene to the last one.The only thing you can say to yourself as the end credits roll is "wow, thats' what great filmmaking and acting is all about". Such is the case with Director, Sidney Lumet's powerhouse of a melodrama, "Before the Devil Knows You're Dead".<br /><br />In this film we are introduced to two adult brothers, Andy (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and Hank Hanson (Ethan Hawke). Both men are extremely different people, who lead very different life styles. But besides DNA, they do share one thing in common...money problems. At the start of the film, Andy pitches Hank an unusual ideal. He proposes, that they rob their own, elderly parents' small, suburban jewelry store. Andy assuredly presents this as a golden opportunity to solve their individual financial problems. An easy, victimless crime, that in the end will be covered by the insurance company. Hank is less sure, debating and arguing both the moral and practical implications of committing such an act. This sounds like a really bad, crack-pot ideal...right? You betcha. In the course of the actual robbery, everything that could go wrong, does go wrong with horrendous results.<br /><br />But this is all just a jumping off point for the story. In a non-linear, "Pulp Fiction"-like fashion, we are slowly presented with both the events, that lead up to the robbery and the aftermath, in which both brothers are desperately trying to cover up their crime. The dominoing  consequences end up tragically, devastating everyone involved and leads to the revelation of long buried, emotional family problems and dysfunction.<br /><br />Director, Sidney Lumet, who's long and storied career includes many cinematic classics ("12 Angry men", "Dog Day Afternoon", "The Verdict", "Network") has made a truely great film. Maby, I'm committing a form of 'ageism', but I'm just amazed that a director, who's in his eighties is producing work, that has so much creativity, energy and vitality to it. My hat is off to him. Sidney Lumet is truely a consumate film artist.<br /><br />The same can be said for the film's cast, which includes Philip Seymour Hoffman, Ethan Hawke, Albert Finney and Marisa Tomei. These four actors give just all around fantastic performances, that are at the top of their craft. In particular, I am quite impressed with Hoffman's turn as Andy. At first he presents us with a man, who seems composed, placid and assured in what he is doing. But as things start to fall apart, we watch this character just slowly implode into a mess of insecurities and dysfunction. Philip Seymour Hoffman may have won the Academy Award for "Capote", but this has to be one of his best performances ever.<br /><br />The DVD features an interesting, short documentary on Sidney Lumet and the making of this film. Also included is a commentary track featuring Lumet, Ethan Hawke and Philip Seymour Hoffman. If your a fan of crime thrillers, good drama or just great filmmaking in general, then check out "Before the Devil Knows Your Dead". Excellent movie! Highly recommended!</p></br><a href="../users/A2UUP58XPQW3GF.html">A2UUP58XPQW3GF</a><br/><p>Sidney Lumet, the acclaimed director responsible for "Serpico" and "12 Angry Men" returns with another thrilling slice of human drama in "BEFORE THE DEVIL KNOWS YOU'RE DEAD". The man definitely knows how to make a melodrama seem thrilling and immersive. I'm not going to argue with him, Lumet insists that this film is a melodrama rather than a crime thriller. Melodramas is one of the most underestimated genres in film. Whatever genre it may be under, the script by Kelly Masterson comes to life with Lumet's touch. It is a surprisingly powerful thriller (ahem), I mean melodrama.<br /><br />Two brothers; Hank (Ethan Hawke) and Andy Hanson(Philip Seymour Hoffman) have their own share of problems. Hank is way behind in child support payments and Andy is having some marital issues with Gina (Marisa Tomei), and his miss-dealings at work is in danger of becoming uncovered. They hatch up a supposed "perfect" crime to rob their parent's (played by Albert Finney and Rosemary Harris) small jewelry store to escape their issues. Unexpectedly, the robbery goes awry, and the Hanson brothers find themselves in a deeper predicament than ever before.<br /><br />According to legendary director Sidney Lumet, a melodrama is a film whereas the characters drive the plot rather than the screenplay. The film was originally meant to be a crime caper-thriller but with Lumet's very steady hand, it becomes more a slice of life or rather a very black view of a dysfunctional family. The film begins with a scene in Rio with Andy and Gina making love; yes, there is graphic sex and nudity but the way Lumet handles the scene is quite ingenious. The scene serves up a lot of character development for our main protagonist Andy. Gina (Marisa Tomei) is also having an affair with her husband's brother Hank, that also serves up a lot of "amped" up intensity in their relationship. The screenplay by Masterson originally wrote the two as only friends and thank goodness for Lumet's insistence that they be written in as brothers. However dark and bleak the film's premise is, it succeeds in serving up the needed credibility and believability in its characters and the situation they are in.<br /><br />The film's first half is in a fragmented style and it works. The film deals with Hank, then Andy and then Hank again. The sequences occur 3-4 days before the robbery and gives definite focus as to why and the how the two brothers could come up with a devilish scheme such as this. At first, I had some difficulty believing that two off springs could carry out a crime such as this, but as the film progresses, the character-driven plot is given room to convince. Andy is an individual who just cannot appreciate what he has and Hank is well, as their dad says, "like a baby". The film has some very noteworthy scenes before and after robbery that gives the plot a lot of emotion.<br /><br />Of course, for an emotionally-charged melodrama, the cast has to perform almost remarkably, and they do. Academy award winner Philip Seymour Hoffman actually carries most of the film, but it would be unfair to say that the film is a success because of his superb performance. Ethan Hawke also does a convincing job as the nervous, "loser" brother who is also a father in a bind. Academy award winner Marisa Tomei's character, Gina may be a little underdeveloped, but the actress does maximize whatever she had to work with. Tomei plays her character with a sort of a mild femme fatale in the beginning, Marisa is so sexy and her facial expressions can work the camera when it comes to emotion. Albert Finney plays the father determined to find those behind the robbery, and his mannerisms and actions display pure emotional pain.<br /><br />Sidney Lumet definitely knows how to bring the best out of his cast and this film is another testament to his directorial skills. The script may not offer that many surprises, (you can tell from a mile away that the film will be bleak and black) and the climax may feel a bit perfunctory and opens up a few unanswered questions but the structure and the direction is solid enough to immerse the audience. For me, at least, the ending gives an exclamation point and serves up some details left for our imagination and understanding.<br /><br />"Before the Devil knows your dead" makes for a very gripping and bleak melodrama and it comes with a highly recommended rating from me. The characters do come alive and the film's plot is interesting enough to keep you glued to your seat. You are about to be taken for a ride...<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! [4- Stars]</p></br><a href="../users/A34D4KCP94ACJZ.html">A34D4KCP94ACJZ</a><br/><p>Directed by the great Sidney Lumet (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006JU7T">Serpico</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NOKJEU">Dog Day Afternoon</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010YSD7W">12 Angry Men</a>), this is a dark heist drama about terribly corrupt people.  Fairly ordinary in its theme these days but Before the Devil Knows You're Dead is remarkably deep in engaging and underrated performances.  The cast includes Ethan Hawke, Marisa Tomei, Albert Finney, Brian O'Byrne, Amy Ryan, and of course the amazing Philip Seymour Hoffman in a role worthy of incredibly high praise, especially considering how unique the role is for Hoffman, who normally plays characters with a small fraction of the presence and confidence he has here.  He is actually intimidating in some scenes which is a far cry from his equally engaging performances in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E33VWW">Capote</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008WI9N">Love Liza</a>.<br /><br />Hoffman is Andy Hanson, an executive of seemingly solid repute, who has embezzled from his employer and is about to be audited.  He needs money to make up for the losses due to his theft.  Either that or he needs money to run far away from the law.  He convinces his brother Hank (Hawke), who is also in need of money for his own reasons, to plan an armed robbery on a jewelry store.  The moral dilemma here is that the jewelry store belongs to and is run by their parents.  The plan fails in ways I won't reveal and eventually leads to various forms of further descent for the two characters.  Albert Finney plays the father of Andy and Hank.<br /><br />Before the Devil Knows You're Dead is shot on high definition video and it is one of the first times I've seen the format used this effectively for a fairly low-budget feature length film.  I guess even at 83 years old, Lumet is still evolving as a filmmaker, albeit the subject matter is still pretty consistent.  He understands the technical end and he has always known how to tell a good story on film.  The quick release on Blu-Ray was also welcome and of course consistent with the move to film on high definition.<br /><br />The story is told in various segments that bounce back and forth in time surrounding and during the events mentioned in the brief summary above.  This was probably done to show the various character's perspectives on the events and was pretty effective for that.  The movie was made on Lumet's own terms and that is something I can respect, but what made it surprising to me was the power of the characters and the performances of the actors in their roles.  It really is a highlight on the resumes of all the actors involved and that is saying something for the likes of Finney, Hawke, and Hoffman. It is dark and has its own pace but I definitely recommend seeing Before the Devil Knows You're Dead.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>From legendary director Sidney Lumet comes Before the Devil Knows You're Dead; a dark, bleak, and absorbing tale of a family that borderlines on Greek tragedy.  Philip Seymour Hoffman stars as Andy, a desperate and drug raddled payroll executive who convinces his cash-strapped brother Hank (Ethan Hawke) to pull off what could be the perfect crime.  The crime is knocking off a mom and pop jewelry store, that just so happens to be run by their actual parents (Albert Finney and Rosemarry Harris).  That's what makes it perfect: mom and dad get taken care of via insurance, and Andy and Hank's money problems are taken care of.  However, things don't go as planned, and quickly spiral out of control, leading to a climax that you may not see coming.  Though the script from Kelly Masterson tends to rely a little heavily on the whole "repeat scenes from different perspectives", it works very well in Lumet's hands, and the work from the cast is nothing short of superb.  Hoffman, Hawke, and Finney are wonderful and magnetic, while Marisa Tomei delivers a sympathetic performance as Andy's long suffering wife.  Even relatively minor roles from Michael Shannon, Brian F. O'Byrne, and Amy Ryan manage to be memorable.  All in all, Before the Devil Knows You're Dead is a spectacularly dark and absorbing film from the legendary Sidney Lumet that deserves your attention.</p></br><a href="../users/A2QHM5HBSIXRL4.html">A2QHM5HBSIXRL4</a><br/><p>This stirring drama from master Sidney Lumet - 84 years young at the time of this filming with nothing off his fastball - brings together a group of brilliant Broadway actors for a cracking tale.  Joining co-leads Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Ethan Hawke are established Broadway veterans Amy Ryan, Michael Shannon, Rosemary Harris and Br&iacute;an F. O'Byrne.  Also on hand are Marisa Tomei (and how) and Albert Finney.  When Sidney Lumet puts on a show, the names come out.<br /><br />The storyline itself is one of a family's destruction from within.  Director Lumet had the good sense to suggest that screenwriter Kelly Masterson re-work his two protagonists to be brothers.  It's that dynamic that drives the film.  We see the lives of two brothers gone slowly wrong, the plan they set up as their way out, the execution gone terribly wrong (like these two would suddenly get it right after so much gone wrong?) and the shocking fallout.  Lumet expertly tells the tale and ratchets up the tension at each mile marker.<br /><br />If you liked <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305417830">A Simple Plan</a>, this film is in the same genre: greed; half-baked 'genius' plots; poor execution; family fallout; bad endings for lots of people.  The tension in 'A Simple Plan' was almost unbearable at times.  I got the same feeling here at points.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TEMNM9ZEOLJ6.html">A1TEMNM9ZEOLJ6</a><br/><p>The pacing, cinema style, storyline, acting, cutting, directing and overall look of this are stunning. At age 83, Lumet ("Dog Day Afternoon" etc) makes a movie like a 30-year-old would. Hoffman and Hawke are perfectly dysfunctional brothers here. Finney, the old pro as the father, is stunning. The plot is just convoluted enough and the tactic of replaying scenes through the now-familiar concept of time-shifting works very well. There's an operatic quality to the film, and of course, a Shakespearean tragedy going on as the family implodes after the brothers' decision to rob their parents' bland suburban jewelry store. I'd overlooked this upon release. Don't make the same mistake now. Watch!</p></br><a href="../users/A3N5XIM9R2OQH0.html">A3N5XIM9R2OQH0</a><br/><p>Sidney Lumet's Serpico/Dog Day Afternoon heyday may be several decades behind him, but with Before the Devil Knows You're Dead he's crafted a smartly written, complicated, and ultimately gut-wrenching suspense film that doesn't pander to its audience with cheap plot twists or manufactured happy endings but instead resides squarely in the real world throughout.  If you're watching this movie in a dark frame of mind, you're in for a treat--its cynical, uncompromising view of the world and of human nature make it about as heartwarming as a Joy Division album.  Relentlessly exploring the way unintended consequences can pile up on even the most seemingly well-thought-out schemes, the movie makes a compelling case that the perfect crime is nothing more than a fantasy.  Before the Devil Knows You're Dead is a welcome rarity in that it's an almost entirely character-driven thriller, a trick it manages to pull off because while it follows many of the conventions of the thriller genre, the movie remains firmly rooted in the dysfunctional relationships and day-to-day financial pressures that are a reality for all too many people.<br /><br />After a brief intro, the movie jumps right into the meat of the plot, as an attempted robbery at a mom-and-pop jewelry store in suburban New York ends up with mom and the would-be robber shooting each other to death.  It quickly emerges that the robbery was engineered by mom and pop's sons, yuppie d-bag Andy (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and slow-witted, Fredo-esque Hank (Ethan Hawke), who mistakenly believe the family store will make an easy target and a quick fix for their respective troubles.  Each has a compelling reason for wanting to get rich quick--Hank is drowning in child-support payments to his shrewish ex-wife (Amy Ryan, excellent as always in a minor role), while Andy dreams of escaping to Brazil with his unsatisfied wife Gina (Marisa Tomei, still hot even in her 40's), who just happens to be carrying on a side affair with Hank.  Focusing mainly on the two brothers, the movie tells the main characters' stories in parallel, jumping around in time to cover the days both leading up to and following the robbery, and while this isn't exactly an innovative device at this point Lumet brilliantly exploits it to build dramatic irony and parcel out the revelations in the most organic fashion possible.<br /><br />Even if it's not always the most ambitious movie ever made, Before the Devil Knows You're Dead manages to more than get by on the intelligence and depth of its writing, directing, and acting, especially from Hawke and Hoffman as the almost comically mismatched brothers.  At times it's hard to decide which brother I wanted to punch in the face more--the weak, whiny Hank or the smug, repressed Andy--which is a testament to how believable both actors are in their roles.  While Hawke certainly holds his own, Hoffman as usual is the star of the show as Andy, a drug-abusing snake and unavailable husband who exploits people and violates the law with no apparent reservations.  In spite of his occasional moments of introspection, at bottom Andy is just a calculating, self-interested sociopath, as the movie's devastating final act makes perfectly clear, and Hoffman is perfect at making you almost feel for Andy in spite of his repugnant actions (also, his non-reaction to one of the big revelations late in the movie is beyond priceless).  In the other central role, Albert Finney turns in a legitimately moving performance as Hank and Andy's father Charles, who suddenly finds himself aimless and obsessed with revenge in the wake of his wife's death.  Finney's role doesn't appear all that substantial at first, but it eventually turns into an examination of the plight of the marginalized elderly on par with Bruce Campbell and Ossie Davis's performances in the great Bubba Ho-Tep.<br /><br />Overall, Before the Devil Knows You're Dead is an extremely impressive effort in a thriller genre whose releases seem to be getting increasingly interchangeable these past few years.  There's a palpable sense of foreboding that hangs over everything, which is brilliantly enhanced by Lumet's stark, unstylized direction.  The violence is pretty minimal, but what there is is suitably blunt and unflinching, and attempts to soften the characters or the world they inhabit are thankfully rare.  Best of all, it carries with it a strong moral about the folly of trying to find a quick fix for your troubles, especially when it involves trying to steal from your own family.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>****1/2<br /><br />Irony and Fate are the true, de facto stars of "Before the Devil Knows You're Dead," an ingeniously constructed and beautifully crafted tale of an attempted robbery - one that winds up going awry in ways that the participants could never possibly imagine or foresee.<br /><br />Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Ethan Hawke play two brothers who have recently fallen on hard times.  Andy (Hoffmann) is a real estate accountant who needs money to feed his secret heroin addiction, while Hank (Hawke) is a doting dad who is already three months behind on his alimony and child-support payments.  Hank, the "weakling," is initially reluctant to turn to a life of crime to solve his problems, but desperation and the persuasive powers of his domineering older sibling finally convince him to do it.<br /><br />"Before the Devil Knows You're Dead" is the latest work by veteran director Sidney Lumet, who in his prime gave us "Twelve Angry Men," "The Pawnbroker," "Dog Day Afternoon," "Network," and "The Verdict," and who here demonstrates that, even in this his sixth decade of moviemaking, he is still at the top of his game.  In his most famous - invariably urban-based - dramas, Lumet has always been far more concerned with character study than with plot mechanics per se - even when, as is certainly the case here, the film boasts one of the most purely fascinating storylines of any movie in recent memory.  For, indeed, with every twist and turn of the narrative, Lumet and screenwriter Kelly Masterson reveal new and fascinating aspects of the characters, as we watch the brothers becoming ever more entangled in a web of their own making, till, finally, no good options are left.  To draw us deeper into the plight of the characters and the world they have created for themselves, the filmmakers have come up with a demanding and complex - but always comprehensible - multi-level time structure through which to tell their story, creating a fascinating puzzle for the audience to solve.<br /><br />Thanks to brilliant performances by Hoffmann, Hawke and Albert Finney as the boys' father, the movie evolves into a gripping family drama in which feelings and resentments, simmering just beneath the surface for decades, are suddenly brought to the fore by the heavy-handed machinations of Fate.<br /><br />"Before the Devil Knows You're Dead" has all the earmarks of a classic tragedy, with one glaring exception:  Andy and Hank demonstrate little of the potential nobility whose fall we would normally be called upon to mourn.  This makes the movie a true product and reflection of the times in which we live.<br /><br />First-rate on every level, "Before the Devil Knows You're Dead" stands as one of the top movie releases of 2007.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PNTEDGMOLMOY.html">A2PNTEDGMOLMOY</a><br/><p>Sidney Lumet's "Before the Devil Knows You're Dead" is a two-hour romp for any sadist who revels in emotional rather than physical torment.  It's hard to say if this is a good movie - I am in such a foul mood after watching it that I can't appreciate its merits.<br /><br />I guess if the movie aims to make you depressed, and you emerge depressed, then it must be good.  Oh well.<br /><br />A first-rate cast elevates a dark story. Two brothers, Andy (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and Hank (Ethan Hawke), are circling their respective drains.  On the surface, Hank is the worse off - divorced and crippled by child support payments and an incapacity to think for himself.  Andy is apparently more successful - a high-flying corporate executive, married to Marisa Tomei (who we see a *lot* of), and suave in his chunky way.  But in many ways, Andy is much worse off.<br /><br />To save themselves, Andy and Hank agree to rob their parents' suburban jewelry store.  This goes badly, and the movie follows Hank and Andy's downfall.  This is dark, tortured stuff as the botched crime rips open old family wounds and exposes new secrets.<br /><br />This is a feel-bad movie.  Unfortunately, unlike "Boys Don't Cry," this isn't a great feel-bad movie.  A chopped chronology reeks of dozens of indy movies since "Pulp Fiction," and there is hardly a moment of hope or levity to lighten the mood one iota.  Save for the good performances, this movie is not a recommendation.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6X0DAM87GN4.html">A3C6X0DAM87GN4</a><br/><p>At age 83, Sidney Lumet proves all the nay-sayers wrong who argue with age comes a loss of talent. "Before the Devil Knows You're Dead" is one of Lumet's best films.<br /><br /> Two brothers, Hank (Ethan Hawke) and Andy (Philip Seymour Hoffman) decide to rob a jewelry store. Their motives are admittedly cliche. Hank is divorced and behind on his child support. Andy has to maintain a certain lifestyle for his wife (Marisa Tomei). Both of whom claim to only be happy and at peace when on vacation in Brazil.<br /><br /> Still despite this cliche idea; one last heist will set us free, Lumet makes sure nothing else is predictable, from whose jewelry store is robbed to the film's climax. In fact that's what hurts the film a little. It has some moments which seem unreal, not believeable. But because the film is directed by Lumet I trust his instincts and feel he won't let the film get carried away with itself. He'll somehow make it all believeable. And to a very large extent, he does!<br /><br /> The relationship between the brothers and their relationship with their father feels true. I almost wish the film had spent more time on the relationship between Andy and his father, Charles (Albert Finney). Andy is the older brother, the leader. He is the emotionally strong one whereas Hank is a baby, both in birth order and maturity. Hank is weak and dependent on his brother. Yet Andy has his weak moments as well. He has an emotionally distant relationship with his father. There is one powerful scene where each man apologizes for not being what the other wanted.<br /><br /> Hoffman has had a strong year, appearing in three heavily favored films; "The Savages" and "Charlie Wilson's War" but it is his work here which truly touched me. I felt for his character. It is an emotionally complex, roller-coaster character and in my opinion a disgrace he didn't receive an Oscar nomination for his performance here. I know everyone and their brother agrees Daniel Day-Lewis will win for "There Will Be Blood (and his performance does make that film) but Hoffman's performance got to me more. Personally it is my favorite performance of the year because I can relate to this character.<br /><br /> But it is not just Hoffman who I feel was wrongly snubbed . Hawke is convincing in his role as is Finney. And where's Lumet's nomination for directing? He orchestrates the film wonderfully. There are certain editing choices I didn't like, the film is told out of sequence, but, he brings out some great performances from his actors. You have to give him credit for that.<br /><br /> "Before the Devil Knows You're Dead" was the most draining experience I had at the movies. To call the film a downer is to understate the film. It is unrelenting in its intensity. It just brings you down. But that is not a fault because Lumet remains consistent with the tone. And because of that it is fittingly paced. We slowly become more and more absorbed.<br /><br /> I mentioned the film becomes unbelieveable, but, I didn't reveal why I felt the climax is and who they rob. I did that on purpose. I don't think you should know. And if you do know in advance, don't blame me, it's not my fault. The movie works best when you know as little as possible about where the plot will take you. Like a good heist, it's the element of surprise that counts. *** 1\2 out of *****<br /><br /> Bottom-line: One of Sidney Lumet's best films despite some minor flaws. Effectively paced. Lumet gets some strong performances out of his actors.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>Sidney Lumet is a master filmmaker. I don't think anyone could dispute that. Even with his occasional missteps ("Find Me Guilty!" starring Vin Diesel) he has created more memorable films than many younger filmmakers could ever hope to include on a resume.<br /><br />The director returns to form with "Before the Devil Knows You're Dead", an independently made film featuring exceptional performances from Philip Seymour Hoffman, Ethan Hawke, Albert Finney and even Marisa Tomei. This powerful film had me riveted to my seat, unable to tear my eyes away from the screen for even a moment.<br /><br />Andy (Philip Seymour Hoffman) meets his brother, Hank (Ethan Hawke) at a local bar. Andy and Hank work in the same real estate office and share a lot as brothers, including their personal and financial problems. Because of this, Andy knows Hank has a lot of financial problems; a divorcee, the younger brother struggles to meet the alimony and child support and lives in a dump, sleeping on a sofa bed. But Andy has problems of his own; he tries to give his wife (Marisa Tomei) the finer things in life, things he can't afford, he has fallen into quite a bit of debt as well. He has the perfect plan. There is a small jewelry store in a strip mall in the suburbs. They are both intimately familiar with the store and everything they steal would be insured. It would be a victimless crime. Hank soon realizes Andy is talking about the store their parents (Albert Finney and Rosemary Harris) own. He doesn't want to do it. But the financial pressures force him to reconsider and he enlists the aid of a shady friend, Bobby (Brian F. O'Byrne) to help him rob the store. When they arrive, Hank gets a queasy stomach as they watch Hank's dad (Finney) drive up and drop off his mom (Harris); Hank almost decides against it, his mom wasn't supposed to be there. But Bobby is going through with it anyway and decides to go in alone. Then everything goes wrong.<br /><br />Directed by Sidney Lumet and written by Kelly Masterson, "Devil" is a film concentrating on the story and the performances with little in the way of flash or flourish to stand in the way of the characters and plot. The one concession to modern filmmaking comes when Lumet wants to shift the focus of the story. When the film begins, we watch the three days before the store robbery from Hank's point of view. When the story reaches a pivotal point, we shift to four days before the store robbery, but this time, from Andy's point of view. So we see many of the same things twice, but with different events leading up to the same conversations or meetings. In one story, we might watch a character listen to his phone ring and when he finally decides to pick it up, there is no one on the line. Later, we see the other brother making that call, and why. As the story continues, we soon start to watch Charles' (Finney) point of view. It is an interesting method to show us all of the different thought processes and the consequences of various actions, not just on one character but on everyone involved in the story. Sure, this is the type of device made famous by Tarantino, but it is not really copies here so much as it is given new life.<br /><br />The key to this film's success if that we believe everything we see. Two brothers decide to rob their parent's business. Even if they believe it will be a victimless crime, what sort of thought process leads to this moment? As "Devil" begins, we see evidence of the financial cesspool each of the brothers is in, and they are in deep, each for different reasons and in different ways. But we believe Hank and Andy can barely breathe due to the anxiety surrounding their every moment. It makes sense each would welcome any opportunity to keep their heads above water. So when Andy suggests the plan, we can see why he would sink to such a level. Lumet convinces us of their need to get money. During the film, we see evidence of the other influences and problems in their lives. We have to believe there is more than just a financial strain, there has to be a missing mental connection.<br /><br />Naturally, with an actor the caliber of Hoffman, he shows this in spades. As the story progresses, he reveals the many layers of Andy's character. All of the bad decisions he has made and continues to make and he has made many. It is a wonder Andy is able to fool anyone, but he succeeds. On all levels, at first glance, Andy appears to be a completely normal person, and everyone is fooled. But the botched robbery proves to be the unraveling point and he desperately tries to keep everything going, to maintain his image, hoping, looking for an escape.<br /><br />Hoffman does an outstanding job making Andy come alive. He has to make Andy's attempts to appear normal and respectable believable, yet reveal little bits of this to us as he does so. Then, as everything begins to unravel, he shows us how hard Andy continues to try to make everything work. And below all of this, a seething rage threatens to break out, yet another facet of his character he has to control, yet subtly reveal to us.<br /><br />Ethan Hawke plays Hank, the younger brother and the more established screw-up. He seems to have never made a good decision in his life, and these mistakes have continued to compound throughout the years, causing him more and more problems. As Hank's problems continue to grow, his brother is aware of the trouble he is in and comes up with the plan for both of them to gain some independence.<br /><br />But Hank is the type of guy who always has cold feet and finds problems with everything. Even after he agrees to go ahead with the plan to rob their parents' jewelry store, he starts to change his mind and Bobby has to go ahead and commit the robbery without him, leaving him alone in the car outside. Hank can't even complete this action, something so reprehensible no son should even contemplate in the first place, but since he has decided to go ahead with the scheme, you would expect him to be able to follow through.<br /><br />Throughout the film, we see illustration after illustration of Hank's inability to cope with anything and everything. It is amazing he is even able to function at the level he does. So when he leaves the operation in Bobby's hands, it doesn't really come as a surprise. And the consequences of these actions, which are very bad, also make sense, given what we know about Hawke's character.<br /><br />Hawke does a great job of making Hank desperate in his attempts to control the universe around him. He is late with alimony and child support so decides to lash out against his ex-wife when she continues to nag him for the money. As soon as his daughter enters the picture, he turns on the charm and sweetness. As soon as she is gone, he hurls a lame rebuttal at his ex-wife. There, he showed her. It is as convincingly lame as it sounds and adds a lot to his portrayal of this loser. He has no power or control over his life and tries to prove it every minute.<br /><br />When I first saw the trailer for "Devil", it ends by noting the Academy Award Hoffman won, the nomination Hawke earned, the Academy Award Tomei won and the nomination Finney has earned, in that order. What is wrong with this picture? Marisa Tomei has won an Academy Award and Albert Finney hasn't? Tomei has contributed some interesting performances to a number of interesting independent films since her Academy Award win for Best Supporting Actress in "My Cousin Vinny", but she hasn't done anything Oscar worthy. Ever. Unfortunately, this is not an isolated example of Oscar mistakes.<br /><br />In "Devil", she plays Gina, Andy's (Hoffman) wife. As the film opens, she and Andy are in Brazil, enjoying a vacation. "What if we could stay here forever?" Andy asks. Gina doesn't take him seriously, but she should because he is about to set into motion the plan at the center of the story. As the situation spirals out of control, she plays the supportive spouse, trying to help the family through this crisis. But she also plays an unknowing role in the plan.<br /><br />It is a good performance from Tomei. As Gina begins to realize the problems her husband is facing, she tries to get him to talk but he only says "I'll take care of it" or grunts in response. She is used to this and makes no effort to hide the problems she and her husband are having, engaging in questionable activities of her own. But even she comes to a point where she can't handle it anymore.<br /><br />Albert Finney plays Charles, the patriarch of the family and he is largely quiet through the entire story. This makes sense, given the circumstances. But as he struggles with how to cope with the situation he has been placed in, we see various bursts of rage, anger, remorse, confusion and shock. Amazingly, Finney portrays these with very little outward movement. A mere glance is used to convey one feeling. A small gesture another. Charles is in shock because of what has recently happened to his family. As he begins to realize what is going on, in the background, what set all of these events into motion, he moves with his mouth hanging open, determined to find out all of the details, yet dumbfounded at the same time. It is a performance only a master of the craft could make work. Finney makes it work.<br /><br />"Before the Devil Knows You're Dead" is a fantastic film, an in-depth look at the actions and consequences of two royally screwed-up brothers. It is the type of film only a master director could make work. Sidney Lumet makes it work.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>Before the Devil Knows You're Dead is a film that will leave you speechless and wanting more. Directed by Sidney Lument, this drama will definitely catch your eye especially after the first scene and the bank robbery that goes terribly wrong. Philip Seymour Hoffman gives a blistering, unsympathetic peformance...he is without a doubt the finest, most gifted actor to light up the screen in years! Ethan Hawke, Marisa Tomei, and Albert Finney also deliver flawless peformances. There is not one negative thing about this movie, amazing piece of art!</p></br><a href="../users/A17FLA8HQOFVIG.html">A17FLA8HQOFVIG</a><br/><p>I couldn't take my eyes off the screen as I watched this 2007 electrifying crime drama which moved at the speed of light and kept me alert and at the edge of my seat for its entire length.  Directed by the then 83-year old Sidney Lumet, his master's touch can be seen throughout in this debut original screenplay by Kelly Masterson.<br /><br />The story surrounds two brothers, Phillip Seymour Hoffman as a dishonest payroll executive with a drug habit who convinces his younger brother, Ethan Hawke, to rob their parents' suburban jewelry store.  Hawke needs money badly and he agrees to the heist, enlisting a local thug.  The robbery goes horribly wrong however and what follows is high drama in every sense of the word.  Marisa Tomei is cast in the role of Hoffman's wife who is having an affair with his brother and her role just adds to the high degree of tension of the film.  Rosemary Harris is cast as the mother and Albert Finny as the father, who plays a strong and touching role as a man on a mission with a need for justice.<br /><br />How this all plays out is real and violent and ultimately satisfying as a high tension classical drama which goes far beyond the crime genre.  This is a winner in every sense of the word.<br /><br />And, by the way, the title of the film is based on an actual old Irish toast at a funeral.</p></br><a href="../users/A1UFV4HALV2OXW.html">A1UFV4HALV2OXW</a><br/><p>The cast - Philip Seymour Hoffman, Ethan Hawke, Albert Finney and Marisa Tomei - rise to the occasion in this recent film by director Sidney Lumet. Like an ancient tragedy, it is a melodrama told in out-of-sequence episodes (with captions so you know where you are) of the botched robbery of a mom-and-pop jewelry store. Lumet's tale seems rooted in the new middle-class money hunger and its deeply emotional consequences.</p></br><a href="../users/A3O536E2YOKK4Y.html">A3O536E2YOKK4Y</a><br/><p>Sidney Lumet's 2007 film "Before the Devil Knows You're Dead" is a drama/crime thriller about two brothers who decide to solve their money problems by robbing a jewelry store, and not just any jewelry store. It's a "victimless crime" argues the older brother and mastermind (Phillip Seymour Hoffman). The younger brother (Ethan Hawke) is hoodwinked into the harebrained scheme, but makes the mistake of adding a third person to the mix. From there it's a steady downward spiral.<br /><br />Marisa Tomei plays Seymour's wife and, although her character is shallow, materialistic and immoral, Marisa never looked better (at 42). She appears in a couple of very adult-oriented scenes, so stay away if that deters you.<br /><br />Albert Finney plays the grieving and vengeful father.<br /><br />The story is akin to 1998's "A Simple Plan" in regards to a money-making scheme gone awry. The difference is that the loot in "A Simple Plan" was drug money from a crashed plan, which was basically up for grabs. Hence, the characters are never viewed as criminals by viewers. They're just regular folks taking advantage of a pot of gold thrown into their laps. Their lust for filthy lucre is their downfall. By contrast, the scheme in "Before the Devil..." is a clear-cut crime right out of the gate, even though Hoffman justifies it as victimless. With the possible exception of the wimpering Hawke character none of the people win the viewer's sympathy. They're getting exactly what they deserve.<br /><br />Another problem is the ending. The scenario in the hospital room is unrealistic. A 3-Star review by a physician (Judith S. Inouye, June 2, 2008) gives the details of why this entire scene is implausible. Check it out.<br /><br />That said, the film is expertly made. Roger Ebert gives it a perfect score. Some complain about the mixing of chronology, but I found it well done, interesting and easy-to-follow.<br /><br />The main problem is that the film revels in the worst in humanity. Take, for instance, Hawke's ex-wife who can't say one word to him without cussing and sheer antagonism. Or how about a peripheral character's brother who seeks to extort money from Hawke, an obnoxious tough guy who evidently thinks he's immortal? Or what about the father, Albert Finney: Can the tragic events be an opportunity for him to search his own heart and work toward positive changes, investigate the "sins of the fathers", discuss things, etc.? Forget it. With the possible exception of one character these people are too far gone.<br /><br />So what's the point? Don't commit crimes to make fast cash? Don't develop an expensive drug habit? Don't marry a selfish, unfaithful, materialistic woman? Don't marry a witch with a capital 'B'? The sins of the father will pass on and multiply? Arrogant tough guys must die? Perhaps all the above.<br /><br />"Before the Devil Knows You're Dead" is a hard film to rate. It's well made and maintains your interest. Most importantly, it lingers with you, which is the main reason I recommend it. It offers wisdom to stay on the straight and narrow. But, come on, can't we have one person with redeemable qualities, even if it's an enlightened change of heart?<br /><br />I give it 4/5 Stars but I can understand why some rate it lower and others higher.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />A thriller that sucks the audience in and doesn't let them go for the entirety of its running length, Before the Devil Knows You're Dead features crafty direction, perfect performances and a level of characterization rarely seen in thrillers: it's a film to bump to the top of one's queue.</p></br><a href="../users/AIMR915K4YCN.html">AIMR915K4YCN</a><br/><p>An entire family is annihilated after a desperate businessman named Andy (Philip Seymour Hoffman) convinces his weak-willed brother Hank (Ethan Hawke) to commit a robbery.

I kept wanting the situation to improve, knowing full well that things could / would only get worse. Marisa Tomei (Danika) plays Andy's frustrated, cheating wife. Albert Finney is Andy and Hank's tormented dad. BTDKYD has a delightfully bleak atmosphere throughout. I like the way it develops from a semi-humorous caper into an outrageous tragedy.

The catch:  It's their parents' store.<br /><br />Wow.  I'll say it again:  Wow.  This movie is the most powerful and exciting film I've seen in a long time.  The acting is outstanding, the script is clever and full of surprises, and the direction by Sidney Lumet is superb.  Supporting the two stars are Albert Finney as their father and Marissa Tomei as Andy's wife; they are both excellent.  The story reminded me a lot of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305417830">A Simple Plan</a> which also had two greedy brothers with a can't-miss scheme that quickly and tragically becomes a nightmare.  This movie is so intense, I was often saying, "Yikes!" to myself and holding my breath a lot.  It's that good.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't like is the way the story constantly goes back and forth in flashbacks; I don't think that added anything and it was a bit frustrating for me.  But I still recommend it:  If you like emotional crime thrillers, you'll love this movie.  Explicit sexuality, violence, and profanity.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>I'll start by saying that `Before the Devil Knows You're Dead' has a brilliant premise; utterly brilliant.  It doesn't always go about delivering that to us in the best way, but all nit-picking aside, there is no denying that the story itself is masterful.  I'll also say that Philip Seymour Hoffman is flawless in this movie.  I almost wish that I had watched this one more time before finalizing my personal awards for the year (`The Ellington Awards') for I most likely would have nominated Hoffman for his riveting and impeccable performance.<br /><br />No use griping about that now I guess.<br /><br />The film follows two brothers, Andy and Hank, as they embark on a twisted and disturbing attempt to make some quick cash.  Both Andy and Hank are dissatisfied with their lives.  Andy's wife Gina is depressed with the way her life is going and as the startling opening sequence proves; unless she's away from it all she is not satisfied.  He desires to make her happy, even if that means packing up and moving away.  Hank on the other hand is dealing with his hotheaded ex-wife Martha who is demanding unpaid child support from him.  Both brothers need money to fix their problems and Andy has a solution.  Andy proposes that they rob their parent's jewelry store.  They both used to work there so they know the safe combinations and they know the layout.  It seems like a flawless plan.<br /><br />But there is a flaw.<br /><br />`Before the Devil Knows You're Dead' brilliantly captures the steady decline of sanity when everything around you begins to fall disastrously apart.  After the botched robbery both Andy and Hank are left with a huge mess to clean up and as they try time and time again to make things go away the problems grow until there seems to be no way out for either of them.<br /><br />The films success relied heavy on the shoulders of the cast, but sadly Hoffman is really the only one who sinks into character.  Ethan Hawke has some great moments (his first scene for instance had me expecting him to dominate this movie) but he tends to get weepy and redundant.  Almost every scene shows him making the same clich&eacute;d mannerisms and expressions of guilt.  I've never thought of Hawke as a great actor.  He's touched upon greatness on a few occasions (I remember liking him in `Great Expectations' and `The Newton Boys') but he's never really crossed that line for me.  Marisa Tomei probably does the finest job here next to Hoffman.  Her portrayal of Gina is delicate and fabulously delivered.  Amy Ryan comes across like a very clich&eacute;d ex-wife.  Her character is nothing new and or different.  Albert Finney, an actor who is above and beyond brilliant, fails to really grab me here.  Like Hawke, his expressions of pain and sorrow are manic and generic.  He doesn't add any realism to his performance, which I found disappointing.  I expected more from him.  His final scene was flawlessly executed but until that point I had really no interest in him.<br /><br />I know that sounds like a lot of bad news, but none of the actors are `bad' in the typical sense.  All of the performances are well done it's just that Hoffman and Tomei are really the only two that stand out for me.  The other performances are fine, they are just clich&eacute;d, and this script deserved better than clich&eacute;d.<br /><br />Hoffman though is able to really get inside Andy and make him real to us.  While Andy has to deal with some clich&eacute;d `failing marriage' issues (and he does have that obvious drug habit) he commits one-hundred percent to making his character unique and memorable.  He is the only actor who displays a wide range of emotions, from self confident dominance to self pitied arrogance to uncontrolled rage to bitter solitude to repressed sorrow to released sorrow and even a bit of genuine joy.  He displays all of these emotions flawlessly.  Like I said, I really wish I had watched this another time before compiling my `best of the year' because this performance is brilliant.<br /><br />The script rarely disappoints.  I didn't care for some of the redundant dialog between the brothers but that really wasn't enough to harp on.  There are some extremely memorable scenes, especially when concerning Andy, scenes that help develop his character.  Character development was something I felt the movie soared in.  We really get a grasp of the desperation befalling these two brothers, as well as the grief stricken state of their father.  While Hoffman is the only one of the three who takes advantage of the scripts development and chews it up you can't deny that the characters are three-dimensional, every one of them.<br /><br />In the end I'll close by saying that `Before the Devil Knows You're Dead' is a great movie, one I highly recommend.  It is five-star material and truly would have received them had Hoffman had some exceptional support.  In all actuality I would have rated this movie one of the top ten of the year, maybe even top five.  The story is probably one of my favorite of the year, concept wise (can't get past the clich&eacute;d characters), and the overall flow of the film is absorbing (Lumet directs with passion as always).  So see the film, for the story and for Hoffman and enjoy it because it truly is a very good film.</p></br><a href="../users/ABN5K7K1TM1QA.html">ABN5K7K1TM1QA</a><br/><p>(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book "Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!" Get it at Amazon.)<br /><br />This is a thoroughly diabolical tale of just how bad things can go wrong.  A simple robbery.  Pick up some serious change.  Get our finances together and everything will be hunky-dory.  But--mom and pop's jewelry store?  No problem. Insurance pays for it all.  No guns.  Nobody gets hurt.  Easy money.<br /><br />Older, more successful (it would appear) brother Andy (Philip Seymour Hoffman) has a few minor problems. Heroin addiction, cocaine habituation.  A wife (Marisa Tomei) that...well, he can't seem to perform for.  His flat belly days long gone.  Younger, sweet, slightly dim-witted brother, Hank (Ethan Hawke) with a few dinero problems of his own.  Behind in child support payments for his daughter, in debt to friends and relatives, not exactly wowing them in the work of work, etc.<br /><br />Sydney Lumet, in this performance at the age of 82 (!), directs and gets it 99.99 percent right, which is hard to do in a thriller.  I have seen more thrillers than I can remember and most of the time the director gets the movie printed and lives with the plot holes, the improbabilities, the cheesy scenes, and the hurry-up ending.  Here Lumet makes a thriller like it's a work of art.  Every detail is perfect.  The acting is superb.  The plot has no holes.  The story rings true and clear and represents a tale about human frailty that would honor the greatest filmmakers and even the Bard himself.<br /><br />Hoffman of course is excellent.  When you don't have marquee, leading man presence, you have to get by on talent, workmanship and pure concentration.  Ethan Hawke, who is no stranger to the sweet, little guy role, adds a layer of desperation and all too human incompetence to the part so that we don't know whether to pity him or trash him.  Albert Finney plays the father of the wayward sons with a kind of steely intensity that belies his age.  And Marisa Tomei, who has magical qualities of sexiness to go along with her unique creativity, manages to be both vulnerable and hard as nails as Andy's two timing wife.  (But who could blame her?)<br /><br />It's almost a movie reviewer's sacrilege to give a commercial thriller five or ten stars, but if you study this film, as all aspiring film makers would be well advised to do, you will notice the kind of excessive (according to most Hollywood producers) attention to detail that makes for real art--the sort of thing that only great artists can do, and indeed cannot help but do.  (By the way, I think there were twenty producers on this film--well, maybe a dozen; check the credits.)  All I can say in summation is, Way to go Sydney Lumet, author of a slew of excellent films, and to show such fidelity to your craft and your art at such an advanced age--kudos.  May we all do half so well.<br /><br />Okay, the 00.01 percent.  It was unlikely that the father (Albert Finney) could have followed the cabs that Andy took around New York without somehow losing the tail.  This is minor, and I wish all thrillers could have so small a blip.  Also one wonders why Lumet decided not to tell us about the fate of Hank at the end.  We can guess and guess.  Perhaps his fate fell onto the cutting room floor.  Perhaps Lumet was not satisfied with what was filmed and time ran out, and he just said, "Leave it like that.  It really doesn't matter."<br /><br />And I think it doesn't.  What happens to Hank is not going to be good.  He isn't the kind of guy who manages to run off to Mexico and is able to start a new life.  He is the kind of guy who gets a "light" sentence of 10 to 20 and serves it and comes out a kind of shrunken human being who knows he wasn't really a man when he should have been.<br /><br />See this for Sidney Lumet, one of Hollywood's best, director of The Pawnbroker (1964), The Group (1966), Serpico (1973), Dog Day Afternoon (1975), Network (1976), and many more.</p></br><a href="../users/AUM3YMZ0YRJE0.html">AUM3YMZ0YRJE0</a><br/><p>Wow, you can't get much worse than this:  a family heads towards utter oblivion and it is completely believable.

Andy and Hank  (Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Ethan Hawke) plan a perfect heist of a jewelry shop, which happens to be owned by their parents.  They are sure a trusted employee, a lady clerk of about 65 years old will be there early in the morning alone.  It is sweet and simple, the insurance company will reimburse their parents, and they will get away with about $600,000 to pay bills, as they are both deeply in debt.

Time is used like a net that entangles events together as we learn of the circumstances that lead the two brothers, played by Ethan Hawke and Phillip Seymour Hoffman, to plot the robbery.

She's taken off life support soon after. Then, it's their Dad, Charles (Albert Finney), who's on a relentless hunt to find out who the accomplices were.

Brilliantly acted by a large cast - it doesn't strike one false note. Yes it's very dark but it doesn't wallow in the excessive violence of a Coen brothers' film.

But of course, someone gets hurt. Actually, very seriously. What was thought a very easy way of getting money turns out a big mistake, and as the melodramatic story unfolds, things get out of control leading to more disastrous consequences.<br /><br />I know my summery is vague, but I believe you should enjoy this kind of first-rate thriller without knowing anything about it. I can promise "Before the Devil Knows You're Dead" has terrific acting of two leads Philip Seymour Hoffman and Ethan Hawke as brothers. I never was a big fan of Ethan Hawke, but I was quite impressed with his superb performance here. As to Philip Seymour Hoffman, he proved his enormous acting talent again. Some may complain (understandably) that they don't look like brothers, but maybe that is the point. The fact doesn't change that the scenes their characters share are strong and dramatic.<br /><br />Sidney Lumet, acclaimed director of "12 Angry Men" "Serpico" "Dog Day Afternoon" and many other masterpieces, has come back with this highly emotional crime drama. Frankly this is a bit of surprise because he hasn't made a great film since the 1980s when he did "The Verdict" and "Running on Empty." (And he shouldn't have made "Gloria"). I also admit "Before the Devil Knows You're Dead," engrossing as it is, is not his best. The now familiar non-linear narrative method (with flashbacks) starts to look repetitious in the second half of the story, and some characters (especially female ones) are slightly flat.<br /><br />You may not the tone of the film. You may think it is too depressing. This is not "Pulp Fiction" or "The Bank Job" (both my favorite films). "Before the Devil Knows You're Dead" may make you think, but not smile. Still its tension and great acting is undeniable, to which my four stars go.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>'Before The Devil Knows You're Dead' will make you think twice about doing something you know is bad, but you do it anyway! With a premise that shows how wrong a seemingly easy solution can go horribly wrong this film pulls no punches! An engrossing story of two brothers in desperate need of cash, decide to pull off a robbery!....that's as far as I'll go with the plot. What happens next is absolutely tragic.<br /><br />The story is told flash back and flash forward style, which works well in story for the most part. Although, I did feel the film dragged needlessly in the middle sometimes because they didn't reveal enough new information during some flashback/forward segments. This didn't hurt the overall experience, but with a little more information, it would have really pulled me in. Regardless, it's a very solid film with solid performances. The ending was abrupt and left a couple of important loose ends. For those small grievances I deduct 1 star.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZOF747O5EB6R.html">A1ZOF747O5EB6R</a><br/><p>"Before the Devil Knows You're Dead" is a dark tale of human greed and deceit.  What starts out as a thoroughly corrupted crime against parents descends into something even worse.  There is a horrible viscous circle at work which no one is able to right.<br /><br />Andy Hanson (Philip Seymour Hoffman) convinces his younger brother, Hank (Ethan Hawke), to rob their parents' jewellery store in the suburbs of New York.  The parents are not meant to be working on the day of the heist and, although they may be disturbed by the crime, insurance will cover their losses.  The brothers each have their own financial difficulties and the robbery will relieve them of their troubles.<br /><br />The crime, however, goes terribly wrong.  Their mother is unexpectedly working on the day and dies of a gun shot wound.  The trail left by the brothers slowly unravels and the especially conniving Andy is seen for being the epitome of evil.  Needless to say, the brothers are found out.  In a particularly bleak scene, Andy gets his comeuppance.  At least some justice seems to be at work in a roundabout way.<br /><br />The performances of both Hoffman and Hawke are good.  They are plausible in their roles.  Their father, played by Albert Finney is also well managed.  His grief at times is palpable.<br /><br />Overall, the film is good without being great.  It is worth the effort but is unlikely to win a swag of awards.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>When I heard aging director Sidney Lumet was attached to BEFORE THE DEVIL KNOWS YOU'RE DEAD, I was dubious about its success. Not because Lumet has any stains on his record! Quite the contrary. With films like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010YSD7W">12 Angry Men</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006JU7T">Serpico</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NTPG7K">Fail Safe</a> to his astounding credit, he is well-known as a vintage director of classic melodramas. But his age (83 at the time this film was made) could've been a factor; old-style filmmaker does old-style job again. But any fears were quickly whisked away once I started watching his latest film.<br /><br />Not surprisingly, when Hollywood heard the name "Lumet" and that it was involved with a new movie, several bigshots jumped at the chance to be in it. And this was a very good thing. Philip Seymour Hoffman (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E33VWW">Capote</a>) heads this all-star melodrama (yes, it's still a melodrama and that's a VERY good thing) alongside Ethan Hawke (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EWBKK8">Lord of War</a>) and the incredibly sexy Marisa Tomei (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QFCD86">Wild Hogs</a>). Forming a kind of triumvirate of misfits, Lumet takes the audience on a wild ride both in terms of how the timing of the film is laid out (jumping from date to date and perspective to perspective) and what each of them is up to. Hoffman turns in another excellent performance as Andy, a man with financial and drug issues and married to the beautiful Gina (Tomei). Gina is lost amidst her husband's distant actions and shut-in existence and finds solace with his brother Hank (Hawke).<br /><br />Hank is also having financial woes and isn't the brightest bulb in the package. And when his brother Andy (Hoffman) comes to him with a plan to hold up a jewelry store in order to solve their problems, Andy is hesitantly for it ...until he learns Andy's plan is to rob their own parents' store. Store owner and parents Charles (Albert Finney, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I5XOWI">Tim Burton's Corpse Bride</a>) and Nanette (Rosemary Harris, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UR9T7I">Spider-Man 3</a>) are completely oblivious to their son's plan and when Hank hires a man to help him rob the store, things go horribly wrong.<br /><br />It is to Lumet's credit that he spearheads the issues each character deals with and does so without extending it/them into boredom; an area that has plagued many past melodramas. Sexy, dangerous, and frighteningly realistic, Lumet delivers a film that picks up tension as the characters spiral out of control. Even Charles (Finney) isn't immune to the pressures of these horrific events, finding himself making a decision no father should ever be in the position of making.<br /><br />Again, it is to Lumet's credit that he's not afraid to move with the times and show us he knows what works for audiences. The opening sex sequence will certainly grab many viewers. Lumet also isn't afraid to use new technology in his filming; he's all digital. This speaks to his understanding of how well he sees filmmaking as an art, which includes how light falls onto film versus into the digital 1s and 0s.</p></br><a href="../users/A17LEYMZI8OYOQ.html">A17LEYMZI8OYOQ</a><br/><p>Director Sidney Lumet's BEFORE THE DEVIL KNOWS YOU'RE DEAD was one of the very best pictures of 2007, and it's a shame that it was ignored during the Academy Awards.  Certainly the script, direction and performances were much better than in many of the films that were honored.<br /><br />A melodrama in the best sense of the word, the New York-based film, written by Kelly Masterson, tells of two brothers (Philip Seymour Hoffman and Ethan Hawke) who are desperate for money.  They decide to solve their problem by holding up a suburban mom-and-pop jewelry store, an easy target.  The problem is that the store owners are the boys' parents (Albert Finney, Rosemary Harris) and, during the robbery, actually carried out by Hawke's buddy, something goes terribly wrong.<br /><br />Now, the brothers have to not only cover their tracks because Finney is determined to find the guilty party, but they must also deal with a blackmailer.<br /><br />The climax is both shocking and violent, as everything for the brothers seems to spin out of control.<br /><br />Marisa Tomei co-stars as Hoffman's wife, who just happens to be having an affair with Hawke, and Amy Ryan plays Ethan's former spouse.<br /><br />?

People rating this movie poorly because it's depressing, because the characters are slimy and because they can't keep up with the time jumps???  Excuse me, where was it written that movies are supposed to be happy go lucky affairs with lovable characters and easy to follow narration?  The negative reviewers probably need to stick with Disney movies which I think will have more of what they're looking for in a movie.<br /><br />If however you want to see a film with phenomenal acting, and with a powerful twist on the common theme of greed/money/drugs corrupting and ruining lives you've found your film.  I was left emotionally exhausted after watching this movie, as I have encountered similar low and dark periods in my life.  The scene where the character played by Philip Hoffman starts randomly knocking stuff over in his apartment on purpose really hit home.  For anyone who's hit a similar low in their life, you'll know what I'm talking about.<br /><br />I can't recommend this movie enough.  I don't write many reviews on amazon and usually only take the time to do so for something I either really hated or really loved.  Warning, this is not a feel good movie at all!  It is meant to be depressing and the characters are meant to be slimy.  That's life folks.  It would be great if life was like a Walt Disney movie, but it's a big, scary, mean, depressing world out there and this movie does an amazing job of presenting it in all it's glory.</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>The great director Sidney Lumet reappears after a long rest, based on an impeccable and well zealous script to give us an approach of a well known thriller with taste of Greek tragedy .<br /><br />Two brothers Andy (the smart guy) and Hank (the black lamb) decide to robe a modest jewelry who belongs to their own mother. The original idea, according Andy (Philip Seymour Hoffman) was nobody resulted wounded it's to say a clean heist. Meanwhile hank is the secret lover of Andy's wife and Hank decides to hire a junk to make the task, but as always nothing happens as in theory and after several shots both die.<br /><br />Since that moment the life of these brothers is a true messy hell; on the other hand their father is not only emotionally destroyed, but he seeks revenge for those who killed his beloved wife.<br /><br />As you may suppose all the members of the family are really trapped in a web of lies, betrayals and double crossing, due the normal desperation and the complex of guilty that hovers th3 conscious of these two brothers.<br /><br />All the cast is effective. Albert Finney once more, stands out as the father, Seymour Hoffman outstanding, Ethan Hawke is brilliant and the always beautiful and alluring Marisa Tomei shows us her deserved Academy Award in My uncle Vinnie was not a mere casualty. The fresh narrative style of Lumet making smart flash backs completes a well rounded film that meant an original thriller of unpredictable final and hair raising suspense.</p></br><a href="../users/A36HBE2C5SQ2E6.html">A36HBE2C5SQ2E6</a><br/><p>Two Brothers (Hoffman and Hawke) Andy and Hank, desperate for some cash, decide to rob their parent's jewelry store. They decide to split the money that is in the safe. The day of the robbery, Hank uses a accomplice instead, that has disastrous results and ends up making their father (Finney) seek vengeance on the people that had done him wrong. What you reap, you sow.<br /><br />I have been a fan of Lumet since I saw Dog Day Afternoon, and heard Al Pacino utter "Attica", I was impressed with the way the film had been with the opening song, then silence afterwards. It showed the director had a talent that I liked. The director had this air of originality around him as the film went on. Directors, when they age, tend to lose their magic of their earlier films, and end up making not as good films. Lumet has a brilliant porfoilio of works that range from 12 Angry Men to Serpico to Network. This can be added as it is a work that is alike but different in so many ways. He takes the film places that have not been gone before. It is a biting movie that plays out as a Greek tragedy that takes place in modern day society. The film is vicious.<br /><br />The performances in this film were outstanding. Personally, I am not that big a fan of Ethan Hawke, as he is a decent actor, but his performance in the film was heavy. He uses desperate and pathetic as his adjectives to push his performance forward towards great. The performance, though, was outdone by Philip Semyour Hoffman, as yet again, he adds to his long list of characters that are weak willed, and He steals the show by making his character so outlandishly distant from reality.<br /><br />I also liked the film transfer as it gave it a clean, sharp look. It is indeed the wave of the future. Also, the only real problems I had was with Marisa Tomei's peformance. Also, why did her breasts appear every 2 minutes? they deserved their own credit for appearing so much, and I disliked the weird scene transitions, as they came out of nowhere some points. But, after those minor flaws this film is really one that could be overlooked, and it needs to be seen by upcoming directors as it shows how exactly to direct a really masterful crime thriller with some of the best actors.<br /><br />See it before it's too late.</p></br><a href="../users/A3CN9CCJUNIPKT.html">A3CN9CCJUNIPKT</a><br/><p>This is a very dark, ugly tale about two brothers who plot a crime together that explodes in their face. It wouldn't be accurate to say that the disastrously botched job ruins their lives, though, for as the film unfolds we find that both brothers were already beyond hope or redemption.  The failed heist only brings things to a head... I was engrossed for the first half of this film, repelled for the rest, as layer after layer of tawdry, icky back-story reveals itself.  If you like dark material, boy, is this movie for you... If, on the other hand, you're already overwhelmed by the ugliness in life, well... maybe you should pick another rental.  (Slipcue film reviews)</p></br><a href="../users/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z.html">AEQFYOI6YJ83Z</a><br/><p>Andy Hanson has a plan.  He and his brother Hank are both in financial trouble; Hank has a daughter to provide for, and Andy has some accounts he needs to settle at his firm.  The solution: Rob a mom and pop jewelry store.  Not just ANY mom and pop jewelry store, however--the jewelry store owned by Andy and Hank's parents.  It's the perfect crime: they know the layout of the place, they know who works and when...what could go wrong?<br /><br />A lot.<br /><br />Philip Seymour Hoffman proves once again that he is one of the best actors in Hollywood today, plain and simple.  He oozes greaseball charm.  Ethan Hawke reeled me right in--amazing, considering I've never been a big fan of his.  Albert Finney is a wonder to behold.  Rosemary Harris and Amy Ryan (who, let's be honest, plays one of the best b****es in town) are both greatly underused, which is one of this movie's two main flaws.<br /><br />The other flaw?  The transition between scenes gets old fast.  The movie jumps back and forth through time--not an astounding concept, and we can put up with it if it's done correctly.  But here, it just seems a bit forced.  Smoother transitions would have been prefered, definitely.<br /><br />Still...the writing is sharp, and Sidney Lumet's directing is dead-on.  With superb casting, a brilliant script, and a unique and interesting plot, BEFORE THE DEVIL KNOWS YOU'RE DEAD is one of the must-see movies out there.  See it and be moved.</p></br></body></html>

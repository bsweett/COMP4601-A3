Even though he is definitively the emotional locus, he is intriguingly not the protagonist of the story. That role belongs to young James McAvoy, who plays Nicholas Garrigan, a precocious Scottish doctor who ventures to Uganda to satisfy his need for adventure after graduating medical school. By happenstance, Garrigan is called upon to help Amin with a minor sprain after his private car plows into a cow. Impressed by the young man's lack of hesitancy to take action, Amin appoints Garrigan to be his personal physician, a post that seduces the impressed doctor into the Ugandan dictator's political inner circle and extravagant lifestyle.<br /><br />Scottish director Kevin MacDonald brings his extensive documentary filmmaking skills to the fore here, as he creates a most realistic-feeling atmosphere in capturing the oppressive Uganda of the 1970's. Helping considerably with this image are the vibrant color contrasts in Anthony Dod Mantle's cinematography and the propulsive action induced by Justine Wright's sharp editing. Screenwriters Peter Morgan (who also wrote "The Queen") and Jeremy Brock have developed a sharply delineated character study of Amin, who evolves from a magnetic leader giving hope to his people to a scarifying tyrant conducting murders on an imaginable scale (at least until the genocides in Rwanda and Darfur). It is impossible to over-praise Whitaker's towering performance here. He conveys the dictator's playfulness as well as his unmitigated rage moving from simmering to full boil with a power that is at once bravura and subtle. His relationship with the fictionalized Garrigan turns out to be the plot's essential pivot point, although the contrast between the two can be almost too extreme at times.<br /><br />While McAvoy admirably captures the boyish naivet&eacute; of Garrigan, the character is drawn out in rather broad strokes that make his irresponsibility and self-delusion all the more contrived as the story progresses. To intensify the political upheaval portrayed, the plot takes a melodramatic turn into an adulterous affair and even folds in the infamous 1976 Entebbe hijacking incident to illustrate Garrigan's increasingly precarious situation. It's all exciting and even downright brutalizing toward the end, but it also starts to feel a bit too Hollywood in execution. Kerry Washington shows genuine versatility as Amin's cloistered third wife Kay, while Simon McBurney oozes cynical suspicion with ease as a British operative. A convincingly Brit-accented Gillian Anderson makes her few scenes count as a weary clinic physician who proves to have better instincts than Garrigan. But see the movie for Whitaker's magnificent work. He is that good.</p></br><a href="../users/A345WVAVMMO6F0.html">A345WVAVMMO6F0</a><br/><p>the whole reason to see this bloated movie is forrest whitaker, who manages to contain himself just enough to avoid making the crazed dictator idi amin into a total cartoon.  that is not an easy task, since idi amin is a cartoon, especially in the memory of those of us who lived thru the 70s; does anyone else recollect punch magazines "report from our ugandan correspondent"?.  unfortunately, as is so often the case in stories about third world figures, it has to be told thru the eyes of a white man, who of course gives the proper perspective on the savage.  remember that awful movie about steven biko?  the scottish doctor, who is in actuality the main character, is a buffoon and a bore.  the only reason we want to see the movie is idi amin -- why not just admit to that?</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>When an actor gets "into" a role, it can often make or break a film. If they've researched and prepared and are ready to give 100% to the production, then you're more than likely going to have a successful movie. Movie-goers saw this with Phillip Seymour Hoffman in his portrayal of CAPOTE which won him the Oscar, the Golden Globe and so many other accolades that it'd take up half of a page to list them all. Not surprising, Forest Whitaker has mirrored Hoffman's success with last year's astounding THE LAST KING OF SCOTLAND.<br /><br />When you don't see the actor and only see the character, the person doing the portrayal has bottled solid gold for viewers, and Whitaker certainly did this. His breathtaking performance as the deranged dictator General Idi Amin, former president of Uganda, was perfect. Mannerisms, voice, those strangely vacant eyes, they were all eerily present.<br /><br />Although a fictional representation on real events, The Last King of Scotland holds more fact than fiction. Even though one of its main characters (James McAvoy as Dr. Nicholas Garrigan) never really existed, the film inserts him in order for us to see what it was like being on the inside of this bizarre man's government. The brutality of 300,000 slaughter Ugandans is never seen but only hinted at because Dr. Garrigan and the rest of Amin's advisors are never privy to such information, being held tightly to the General's chest. As Idi Amin's paranoia begins surfacing more and more, Dr. Garrigan realizes how dangerous a position he's in -- that being so close to such an unstable figurehead.<br /><br />The cracks in Amin's persona are brutally and perfectly presented by Whitaker. His mood swings from friend to foe happen in the blink of the proverbial eye, and Whitaker makes it all completely believable. The stress Dr. Garrigan (McAvoy) feels is ratcheted up as he realizes he's not really the President's doctor but the prisoner of a genocidal maniac. This added an excellent level of texture to the film, giving the audience someone to care and worry about.<br /><br />Probably the strangest thing about this entire time in history is that many Ugandans still view Idi Amin as a "great President/leader." This is focused on in the extra features of the DVD, making many watchers scratch their heads in dismay, no doubt.<br /><br />Regardless of your views on the man, Whitaker's portrayal of Idi Amin is so impressive you won't be able to take your eyes off the screen.</p></br><a href="../users/A32XW50ILWOXNO.html">A32XW50ILWOXNO</a><br/><p>Every political dictator is really schizophrenic con artist:  A persona of intellect, charisma, paranoia and greed, trying, suddenly, to project benevolence. Many dictators fail because what lifts them to power - murder, theft, fear and ruthlessness - contradicts with the practicality needed to keep it. What a frantic, random life they lead. One eye open in bed. Two death squads open for business.<br /><br />Ugandan general Idi Amin's angle was to play the lovable, chummy, gun-toting teddy bear.  He was a guy who'd take his own shirt off his back. Who'd let his soldiers dine before he did. Who believed Uganda was the root of civilization, and promised to restore its greatness.<br /><br />He also proclaimed himself "Lord of All Beasts on the Earth and All Fishes in the Sea" and expelled Asians from the country because God told him.  From 1971 through 1979, as Amin ruled Uganda, he ordered the murders of possibly 500,000 political opponents. Brutal, meticulous, torturous murders.<br /><br />So it makes sense that "The Last King of Scotland," a fictional account of Amin's reign, is a nasty piece of business.<br /><br />But does it need to be this ugly?<br /><br />The last act of the movie plays like a contemporary tour of Dante's Inferno, tinged with the twisted vibe of the 1970s, and we're led through it by a character nearly as rotten as Amin. It's a lurid experience that, frankly, takes dead aim at women. Every female character is a target for infidelity, a one-night stand, or abuse.<br /><br />One character is disemboweled. Another is hung by his skin. Director Kevin Macdonald has crafted an effective, tense movie of tight close-ups and jarring violence.  But he reduces the movie to the violent fantasies of misanthropes. "The Last King of Scotland" is pulp fiction. Even the terrific Forest Whitaker, who plays Amin, can't escape it.<br /><br />Screenwriters Jeremy Brock and Peter Morgan tell the story from the perspective of Nicolas Garrigan (James McAvoy) a young Scottish doctor who spins a globe and lands his finger on the middle of Africa. He starts in a rural Ugandan clinic. After a chance meeting, Amin offers Garrigan the job of personal physician. Garrigan accepts and finds Amin calling him "my closest, most trusted advisor."<br /><br />Movie ads are misleading, because Garrigan is really the center of the movie, and he's no innocent. In fact, he's a punk blown in from "Trainspotting." Banging around Amin's palace, wolfing down steaks, attending meetings, he falls under Amin's spell until he plays a (willful) role in the murder of a colleague. He's clued in to Amin's tactics, but it doesn't stop him from  tossing Amin's pretty third wife (Kerry Washington) against that aforementioned wall.<br /><br />Garrigan's creepy libertarianism leads "The Last King of Scotland" down a more melodramatic path than it needs to be. Amin killed so many innocents,  so it's odd that Macdonald fixates on Amin's personal war against a guy who kinda deserves it.<br /><br />Yes, the character is meant as a symbol of white decadence in Africa, and the cost of kicking up dirt in the backyard of a civil war. But it's no mystery that Europeans, with the help of guys like Amin, raped and pillaged the whole continent, leaving it decades behind in political and economic development. Based on a recent glut of movies about Africa, Garrigan's indulgence seems more exploitative than informative.<br /><br />McAvoy's annoyingly Scottish performance makes Garrigan harder to like. He hits the accent hard, especially in scenes where he's asked to sneer at British diplomats. He also seems to take Whitaker's cue in adding a bunch of flourishes to his performance. Confidence is compelling, but McAvoy acts like he's been Ewan McGregor for the last 15 years.<br /><br />As Amin, Forest Whitaker tears into his role to create a ravenous-yet-calculated man. He's moody, and, frankly, very funny. There two or three good, full laughs in this movie, and Whitaker is able to bury and excavate his character's dual personas within a scene. Amin understands, like few people do, both wit and slapstick. If the performance seems cartoonish, it's on purpose: Amin wanted to be a mascot to his people.<br /><br />Sadly, the filmmakers trust Whitaker's acting so much that the story hardly explores the sociopolitical aspects of Amin's rule. Crucial decisions and events are seen from afar. The Entebbe incident,  in which Amin allowed a hijacked Israeli airplane to land in Uganda before Israeli troops staged a rescue operation,  is presented more as a cliffhanger for Garrigan than the end symbolic end of Amin's legitimate claim to power.<br /><br />What makes Idi Amin tick? It is  unclear. "The Last King of Scotland" is more content to let us laugh his comedy, and shudder, however briefly, at the thought of his brutality. It seems so unhinged, its depiction of dictatorship so exotic and foreign, that we are left with, like "Scarface," "Fight Club" or "Full Metal Jacket," a piece of art easily manipulated for prurient desires.<br /><br />Don't be surprised if "Uganda!" quietly slips into the language of pop culture over the next few years as an expression of joy, anger, or both. That's a compliment to the movie's allure. And a fierce criticism on its lack of nuance.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJPMB7N776WS.html">A1TJPMB7N776WS</a><br/><p>On the day after he graduates from Med school in Scotland, smart-aleck, babe-in-the-woods, pie-in-the-sky, Nicholas Garrigan (a scruffy, semi-jerky James McAvoy) spins a world globe to decide where he will go to practice medicine and his finger lands on...Canada. Not exciting enough, so he spins again and it lands on Uganda. And so Nicholas jumps on a plane, having no idea whatsoever that the country is in turmoil socially and politically and goes to Uganda: land of Idi Amin (a massive, magnificent Forest Whitaker).<br />For most of "The Last King of Scotland," Nicholas lucks into much of what happens to him. What Nicholas doesn't realize, at first at least, is that he is not in control of the events of his life....the events are in control of him.<br />Much sooner than later, Nicholas is schmoozed by Amin himself to become Amin's personal doctor: a position that allows him entry into the personal as well as the political life of Uganda and of its leader. This of course proves to be a double edged sword and it is from the friction of this blade slicing through all strata's of Ugandan and Amin's life  from which the drama of this film is derived: privilege always comes with a price, political privilege  comes with a bill that inevitably finds us lacking the emotional currency to settle.<br />The big deal here is without a doubt Forest Whitaker's Idi Amin. Whitaker's resume is jam-packed with excellent performances: Bird in "Bird" to name one. But his Amin is a miracle: it's on a grand scale as befits its subject but it's also about the small nuances. Watch how his mind works behind his soulful, expressive eyes. There is an intelligence and heart at work here that cannot be ignored and for once after so many wonderful performances, Whitaker's day has arrived. And it's about time.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FG91CM8221X1.html">A1FG91CM8221X1</a><br/><p>Kevin Macdonald's "The Last King of Scotland" has won renown for Forest Whitaker's justly Oscar-winning performance as Idi Amin. If there has ever been a cinematic performance that can truly be said to burst out of the screen, it's Whitaker's. His Amin is intensely alive, unpredictable, and terrifying; staring at the other characters with his unreadable, strabismatic gaze, you never know whether he's going to hug or kill them (there's a 50-50 chance between the two). Therefore, it's a surprise when seeing the film for the first time that Amin is not the lead character. It's Nicholas Garrigan (James McAvoy), a young Scottish doctor who's an amalgam of several Europeans unlucky enough to have been in Uganda in the 1970s. Garrigan, who comes to Uganda on a lark, is fun-loving, well-meaning, vaguely idealistic but with a wobbly moral compass. A chance meeting with Amin leaves Garrigan intoxicated with Amin's powerful charisma and charm; Amin, for his part, is convinced that Garrigan is the miracle-working adviser he's been seeking. Thus begins a toxic relationship in which Garrigan, first naively and then willfully, blinds himself to the obvious warning signs of Amin's true nature. By the time Garrigan finally wakes to Amin's insanity and the hideous carnage of Amin's rule, he finds he has no friends; all those opposed to Amin see Garrigan as Amin's "white monkey," as a British diplomat sneeringly tells Garrigan. Eventually, even Amin passes moral judgment (as well as judgment of another kind) on Garrigan: "Did you ever do anything in your life that is good?" the bloody butcher asks the well-meaning but silly doctor. And that is a judgment, Macdonald implies, that could have been passed on far too many of us in that situation. McAvoy is excellent as Garrigan, but the character's behavior is so stupid at times that you just want to slap him. When Whitaker is on screen, the movie really comes to life. And we, like Garrigan, are seduced.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>To watch "The Last King of Scotland" means to see terrific Forest Whitaker and his fascinating portrayal of the evil personified. His literally towering presence as Amin is both seductive and terrifying at the same time, something you will not forget easily.<br /><br />The film is not a bio-pic of Ugandan president Amin. It is more like a political thriller seen from the eye of fictional young doctor Dr. Nicholas Garrigan, recently leaving his country Scotland, and arriving at Uganda. Though he is nice as a person, it is suggested that his motive is not always honorable. The film spends some time to set up his character as na?ve and slightly callous doctor who does not know what he is doing. Actually many will find him annoying, but that is exactly the point.<br /><br />Before him and another doctor Sarah (Gillian Anderson, too brief appearance) President Amin shows up, cheered by the excited crowd. Then Garrigan is given a chance to treat Amin's minor injury, and Amin, who had recently seized the power, in turn invites him to his office and asks him to be his doctor. Amin says to Garrigan, "Uganda embraces you," but they young doctor finds the true meaning of it a bit too late.<br /><br />Director Kevin MacDonald, like his previous "Touching the Void," blends reality and fiction, but for "The Last King of Scotland" he leans more on `fiction' side of the script which includes several incredible episodes, like ones you might find in spy novels. Still the film looks often very real. It is actually shot in Uganda and its capital Kampala (by the photographer Anthony Dod Mantle, "28 Days Later") and the fate of Amin's second wife Kay (Kerry Washington) is based on truths.<br /><br />Though the film includes violence (torture scenes and one horrible death), the atrocity of Amin's regime is not directly shown on the screen. It is taken as granted that the audiences have already known the fact, and the film focuses on Amin himself who develops paranoia, perfectly presented by Forest Whitaker's great acting. The film is not perfect as thriller, but still that doesn't change the fact that Oscar-winning performance as President Amin alone is worth your time and money.</p></br><a href="../users/AMKZHBOK7VMQR.html">AMKZHBOK7VMQR</a><br/><p>Whittaker is amazing in his frightful portrayal of Amin as an insecure man who gradually turns into a monster as the power he wields over his poor country leads to excessive violence. Whittaker should get instant Oscar consideration for his absolutely convincing depiction of Amin. The supporting cast is excellent but Whittaker dominates every scene hes in.<br /><br />The film recaptures the horror of Uganda under Amin and personalizes the story as we see him through the eyes of a Scottish Doctor who goes to Africa to work in a clinic and is caught up in events and accepts the job of Amin's personal physician. Through his eyes we gradually see his innocence melt away as he grows in awareness of what is really happening in the country. James MacAvoy os wonderful as the Doctor.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NYQCLFQRTI74.html">A2NYQCLFQRTI74</a><br/><p>Dr Garrigan (James McAvoy) expects to find exotism in Uganda. He certainly will find it, especially after meeting the country's President, Idi Amin (Forest Whitaker) and becoming his personal physician. A chain of events will change Garrigan's life, forever.<br /><br />Absolutely wonderful, brilliant cast. I especially approve of Whitaker's "African" accent in English. Excellent portrayal of those people. McAvoy's character is extremely naive and he does a great acting job.<br /><br />The ending may be quite shocking to some, I myself couldn't bear to watch a few minutes of very gruesome (but necessary and justified) violence (after 1h45 minutes of watching).<br /><br />Certainly not a disappointment.<br />A well directed film, I highly recommend it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2809U2S14N0K1.html">A2809U2S14N0K1</a><br/><p>The story is a young doctor searching for adventure comes to Uganda and accidentally makes a friend of the rulers of the country. Soon he discovers that it is not a game and he is lucky to escape alive although he leaves badly hurt.<br /><br />The story itself I thought needed some work, as I found it hard to believe that a person could be so naive as this doctor pretended to be about what was happening in Uganda during Idi Amin rule. But maybe as I have read true stories of people in Stalin Russia being even more naive then this. I suspect that the film was made for a general viewing as it did not show much of the atrocities that Idi Amin created and what it did show was fairly mild.<br /><br />The acting is reasonable. Forest Whitaker, who played Idi Amin, was extremely good.<br /><br />The filming is good.<br /><br />An interesting movie, I thought.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IWWRZJOXOSYP.html">A1IWWRZJOXOSYP</a><br/><p>Director Kevin McDonald won an Oscar for Best Documentary Feature for "One Day in September" in 1999.  His next (non-documentary) film is "State of Play" that stars Brad Pitt.  He does an excellent job with this film, bringing the horrific reign of Idi Amin to the screen with enough humor & humanity to make it watchable.  Jeremy Brock, who did the screenplays for Judy Dench's "Mrs. Brown" & Cate Blanchett's "Charlotte Gray," does a good job of adapting Giles Foden's novel into a workable film.<br /><br />This may well be Forest Whitaker's most memorable role, despite such excellent work as in the Clint Eastwood picture of Charlie Parker's life titled "Bird" for which he won the Best Actor Award at the Cannes Film Festival & in a lesser-known drama <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005QCVX">Ghost Dog - The Way of the Samurai</a>.  In addition to the Oscar for this film, he won similar awards from the British Academy Awards, the Golden Globe & film critics awards from Boston, Chicago, Dallas-Ft. Worth, Kansas City, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, New York Film Critics + NY Online Critics, Oklahoma, Phoenix & Washington D.C.  Idi Amin is known as one of the most brutal dictators in modern history, joining Lenin, Hitler, Pol Pot & perhaps Sadam Hussein in that nefarious category.  In order for the film to work, Brock's screenplay had to show the various levels for the character, which Whitaker delivers with a cinematic payload.  We see the humor, the paranoia, the immaturity, the ruthlessness & the bravado of the character.  It is an amazing performance.<br /><br />James McAvoy, who had a small part in "Wimbledon" and played in "The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch & the Wardrobe," plays the film's protagonist, Dr. Nicholas Garrin.  He's a young recent graduate trying to escape the esteemed shadow of his father in Scotland, which makes him decide to arrive in Uganda, where he is ignorant of the politics.  On one hand, it seems unbelievable that a character could graduate as a doctor and have such little maturity.  On the other hand, we watch TV's "Grey's Anatomy" & see varying levels of maturity among doctors.  McAvoy delivers a good performance as he grows up considerably before our eyes.  We learn to care about the character and wonder what the next chapter of his life might be like.  McAvoy will next be in "Becoming Jane," opposite Anne Hathaway as Jane Austen.<br /><br />Of the smaller roles, there are some standout performances.  Kerry Washington, who breezed through two "Fantastic Four" films, "Mr. & Mrs. Smith" & played Della Charles opposite Jamie Foxx in "Ray," plays Idi Amin's wife who is the mother of an epileptic child.  In caring for her child and in her position as "third wife," she is seduced by Dr. Garrigan and pays the price.<br /><br />Gillian Anderson, who will forever be known from her work on the TV show "X-Files," has a stunningly different blonde look and does a good job in this cameo.  Simon McBurney from "The Manchurian Candidate" & the upcoming "The Golden Compass," plays the disagreeable British diplomat Stone to perfection.  We really hate him, as we are supposed to do.  David Oyelowo's cameo part as Dr. Junju who is the conscience of the clinic does an excellent job.  Stephen Rwangyezi as Amin's assistant Jonah Wasswa does good work in a small part.  "The Last King of Scotland" is not always pleasant, but Whitaker's celebrated performance makes this essential viewing.  Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>The Last King of Scotland (Kevin MacDonald, 2006)<br /><br />Idi Amin was one of those dictators who really lived the seventies--excess, lack of restraint, far more interested in having fun than in actually running his country. Unfortunately, like his contemporary Pol Pot, he also had little use for anyone who criticized him. So much so, in fact, that three hundred thousand of his critics ended up dead during his brief eight years in power. It was a weird time, it was. Not that our particular time period is any less weird, who'd have thought that the (fictional) memoirs of Amin's doctor would get made into a movie, and that Forest Whitaker would win a Best Actor Oscar for playing the demented dictator?<br /><br />I will admit to not yet having read Giles Foden's book, so I can't comment on the faithfulness of the adaptation, but I do know that the movie version turned out like gangbusters. Whitaker's Amin is a fascinating chap, though one has to wonder at the portrayal of the man as less a ruthless dictator than an idealist who eventually succumbs to paranoia. James McAvoy (The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe) plays Nicholas Garrigan, a doctor in the bush who, after a chance encounter, finds himself invited to be Amin's personal doctor, a situation he uses to escape an awkward relationship with his boss' wife (Gillian Anderson) at the village hospital. In fact, much of what we see of Garrigan defines his life in terms of running away from things; he's in Uganda in the first place because he couldn't stand the thought of going into general practice in his family's sleepy small Scotland town. Much of the non-Amin-related drama from the movie comes from Garrigan, who starts off as a devoted believer in Amin's regime, becoming disillusioned enough to find the willpower not to run away (until, of course, not running away is the difference between life and death).<br /><br />In every way that Garrigan comes off as mousy (or, as British agent Nigel Stone [Simon McBurney] calls him, "Amin's White Monkey"), Whitaker's portrayal of Idi Amin is boisterous. Amin comes off as larger than life, a guy whose main purpose in life is to have a good time. Give him a little power, it goes to his head, and suddenly the buzz-kills start getting murdered. But it's all good, because there's still money, power, women, and everything else that comes from being the president of a mid-sized African country. And, at the heart of it all, there is Nicholas Garrigan, who goes from being Amin's doctor to being his closest advisor, a man who doesn't know about most of what's going on and is torn about calling Amin to task for the rest and defending Amin's judgment.<br /><br />History has portrayed Idi Amin as one-dimensional, an insane dictator whose sole purpose was to kill his countrymen. The Last King of Scotland pushes the balance back the other way a bit, I think; while it never glosses over the fact that Amin was, in fact, an insane dictator, it makes sure we understand that that may not have always been the case, and turns Amin into a complex, three-dimensional character who is endlessly fascinating. This is a good movie, this is. Worth your time. *** ?</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>"The Last King of Scotland" is based on the novel of the same name by Giles Foden, set in Uganda in the1970s during the reign of bloodthirsty President Idi Amin. The picture it paints of Idi Amin attempts to be accurate in tone and deed. But Foden places a fictional Scotsman who becomes an advisor to Amin into the historical context, turning the story into a thriller and giving us an insider's eyes through which to see Amin. Dr. Nicholas Garrigan (James McAvoy) is feeling restless in his father's medical practice in Scotland. Eager for adventure and new challenges, he goes to Uganda to assist at a small hospital in the jungle. Nicholas' bold response to a crisis impresses the nation's President, Idi Amin (Forest Whitaker), who recently took power in a military coup with Britain's blessings. Amin asks Nicholas to become his personal physician and help create a new Health Service for the country. Nicholas' vanity gets the best of him, and he finds himself beholden to Amin's whims and complicitous in his abuse.<br /><br />"The Last King of Scotland", named for Idi Amin's love of all things Scottish and his support for Scottish nationalism, is accurate in the big picture of what went on in Uganda under Amin, while it changes details and rearranges events to serve Nicholas' story. The film's greatest attempt to inform is in the depiction of the charismatic, capricious Idi Amin. Forest Whitaker won an Oscar for his portrayal of this larger-than-life personality who was as charming and perceptive as he was paranoid and immoral. James McAvoy deserves a lot of credit as well for his vain, naive, and ultimately desperate turn as Nicholas. Nicholas represents Britain's view of Amin as it changed from hope to denial to horror over the course of his presidency. "The Last King of Scotland" is a fantastic marriage of history and thriller with a dose of politics as well. Nicholas' actions propel us through the story without missing a beat. The atmosphere is superb. Director Kevin Macdonald's first fiction film is successful in every way.<br /><br />The DVD (20th Century Fox 2007): Bonus features include 2 deleted scenes with optional director's commentary, a theatrical trailer (2 min), 3 featurettes, and an audio commentary. "Capturing Idi Amin" (29 min) is a BBC short documentary about the real Idi Amin, how Ugandans perceived him,  facts vs fiction in the film, and the challenges in placing a fictional story in a historical context. "Forest Whittaker - Idi Amin" (6 min) interviews actors Whitaker and McAvoy about the character of Amin. "Fox Movie Channel Presents: Casting Session" (8 min) interviews the film's director, producer, and casting director Jina Jay about how they cast Forest Whitaker, who talks about preparing for the role. There is a good audio commentary by director Kevin Macdonald. He talks a lot about locations and people in Uganda who were involved with the film, provides some additional information about Amin, and addresses character development. Subtitles are available for the film in English, Spanish, French. Dubbing available in Spanish.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZOF747O5EB6R.html">A1ZOF747O5EB6R</a><br/><p>"The Last King of Scotland" is a truly great film.  It entrances the viewer with its mixture of horror, crowd magnetism and spine tingling drama.  I can recommend this film unreservedly.<br /><br />It would be a particularly unworldly or uninformed person who was not at least broadly familiar with Idi Amin.  His role as the dictatorial president of Uganda in the 1970s was unfortunately typical of corruption in African politics.  He presided over the systematic slaughter of 300,000 of his fellow citizens whilst simultaneously destroying its economy.  It was Winston Churchill who referred to Uganda as "the pearl of Africa".  It was Idi Amin who debauched it.<br /><br />Forest Whitaker plays the role of Idi Amin.  He is absolutely spell binding and, hopefully, will receive a best actor Oscar for his efforts.  Whitaker shows the brutal and lethal mix that was typical of Amin.  He would be a combination of ignorance, great charm and ruthless tyrant with scarcely a breath between each.<br /><br />"The Last King of Scotland" is based on the book of the same name by Giles Foden.  It covers the sometimes morally ambivalent behaviour of a young Scottish doctor (Nicholas Garrigan played by James McAvoy) who travels to Uganda to "make a difference".  Unfortunately, the young doctor easily falls under the spell of Amin and becomes his personal physician.  Through a series of unquestionably dubious decisions, he is drawn further into the maelstrom of Ugandan politics.  The story becomes increasingly chilling and has an ending of mixed emotions.<br /><br />I would encourage all readers of this document to see this film.  You will not be disappointed.

Even the presence of James McAvoy, one of my favorite young actors, didn't do much toward salvaging what this motion picture, by its closing act, had become. The Last King of Scotland had a lot of talent behind it and the first half showed that, but the promise of its beginnings was simply annihilated in its muddled second half, which was little less than a cinematic disaster. I can't recall the last time I saw a plot go to pieces quite as badly as was the case here. A very real shame, too! Yes, Whitaker was brilliant, the scenery was impressive, the story of Idi Amin was ripe for telling, but this almost totally fictionalized would-be bio-pic was a letdown of major proportions.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>`The Last King of Scotland' opens almost childishly, kind of amateurish, as if it was going to make light of a very serious subject.

Told through the eyes of fictitious character Dr. Nicholas Garrigan, `The Last King of Scotland' attempts to give the audience a ringside seat to the tragic events surrounding Amin's rise to power; and for the most part it succeeds very well.<br /><br />One must remember that this is not a true story.  It is a fictitious account of historical events.  You can liken it to `Titanic', for it is a fictional story woven around a foundation of actual events.<br /><br />The film opens with Scottish Doctor Nicholas Garrigan making his way to Uganda to help care for the sick villagers but is soon persuaded by the power behind Idi Amin (who has a soft spot for the Scottish) to leave his original plans and become Amin's personal physician.  This decision proved to be devastating for Garrigan, but that realization would come at a time that was almost too late for him.  As Garrigan becomes more knowledgeable of the truth behind Amin's reign, his initial admiration turns to disgust as he realizes the weight of the situation he now finds himself.  Garrigan finds himself acquainted with those in Amin's circle, including one of his wives named Kay with whom he starts a very dangerous relationship.<br /><br />The film is strengthened by the phenomenal performances by the two male leads, both Forest Whitaker and James McAvoy delivering career best performances.  Whitaker delves into the real man that is Idi Amin, the brutality festering beneath his surface always showing through in his eyes.  (His performance reminds me a bit of Yul Brenner's Oscar winning performance in `The King and I', a portrayal of a man savage by nature who tries to justify his actions with a fa?ade of kindness.  Yes, they are two different people in the end, but he similarities are obvious.)  His performance garnered him award after award (a sweep to be exact) and finally got him recognized among his peers.  His performance is extraordinary, but to be honest he is not as good as McAvoy who fleshes out Garrigan with expert precision, creating a character who is complete and real.  As Whitaker slips Amin into savagery, McAvoy is slowing peeling away Garrigan's sanity to unveil a man scarred by his surroundings and paralyzed by his newfound predicament.<br /><br />I was a little let down by Kerry Washington, not because her performance was lacking (it was quick good) but because the script didn't allow her to become someone truly real to us.  The film was so focused on Garrigan's relationship with Amin that it didn't take a few moments to really flesh out his relationship with Kay, and if it had then her performance would have seemed richer.  That is really the only fault I have with the script also, that it fails to fully invest itself in the entirety of Garrigan's surroundings, targeting his interactions with Amin and allowing the rest of the events around him to become mere side-points.  The film is not particularly long so it could have benefited from a few more minutes added to flesh out the entire plot.<br /><br />But, that is really just a small issue, not anything that should detract anyone from seeing this film.<br /><br />The final moments in `The Last King of Scotland' literally took my breath away (and single-handedly landed Whitaker his Oscar, when if the Academy would look at the less showy performance in the same scene they may have made a different choice).  It is in those moments that the entire film comes to a traumatic and emotionally rooted climax.  Many will see this film for Whitaker's lauded performance (as did I) but what you will find is a diamond in the rough; a truly outstanding fictional biopic that tantalizes every one of our senses.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TEMNM9ZEOLJ6.html">A1TEMNM9ZEOLJ6</a><br/><p>Forrest Whitaker was born to play Idi Amin, evidently. He's got him down. He's even better in this than he was being Charlie Parker in  "Bird." The script is a fanciful take on an imaginary doctor who becomes the dictator's advisor. There are a few love interests. Not too much violence. An entertaining watch.</p></br><a href="../users/A56AA52NMMKYQ.html">A56AA52NMMKYQ</a><br/><p>Forest Whitaker gives a thoroughly believable performance as Ugandan dictator Idi Amin in this movie.  James MacAvoy as the protagonist Nicholas starts as an idealistic doctor aiming to help treat villagers.  Through happenstance, he becomes acquainted with Amin and is bit by bit drawn into his spider web.<br /><br />Making small concessions at first, Nicholas realizes he is compromised ethically and becomes desperate for a way out of Amin's coterie and a way out of Uganda.  His problems extend to the fact that he cannot "keep it in his pants," and he has an affair with one of Amin's wives, who he impregnates.  Not a smart move and perhaps indicative of a death wish.  Will he survive?  Will he be able to leave Uganda?<br /><br />A suspenseful film based on true life events in Africa.</p></br><a href="../users/A2JHHYYOOO4DS6.html">A2JHHYYOOO4DS6</a><br/><p>Absolutey brilliant performance by Forest Whitaker in portraying how cruel humans can be to each other.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VQBHHXIKHIGS.html">A1VQBHHXIKHIGS</a><br/><p>A very powerful film, and I don't have to tell you why because you can read so many other reviews.

The acting in this film is definitely very good, I liked the amount of tension it builds and how it kept me engaged and concerned. Weak points, if any, could be the central character's defiance is shown with a touch too much uplomb, I felt. Not exactly riveting but definitely enthralling. Leaves a mark, one of the films you discuss with the best friend of yours especially the aspirin plus beer scene.<br />I also find Last King of Scotland is particularly overlooked by audiences and movie lovers worldwide because it isn't exactly too pomp on the mainstream meter. Over look that and you have one fine exhibit of human spirit or lack of it. If you liked this film, I would recommend "Seven Years in Tibet"</p></br><a href="../users/A3VIOCJZ22JZXT.html">A3VIOCJZ22JZXT</a><br/><p>This is a highly entertaining film that gets more intense as the film reaches the end. Forest Whitaker does a wonderful job of playing General Idi Amin Dada, a man who rises to power in Uganda becoming the dictator of the country. He is genuinely frightening. James McAvoy plays the young immature Scottish medical doctor, Nicholas Garrigan, who finds himself in a lot of trouble in this troubled nation.<br /><br />The film and the main character, Dr. Garrigan, are fictional; however they are based on the actual history of Idi Amin Dada's genocidal tyranny and the PLO high jacking in Entebbe. Nicholas comes to Uganda on a lark and works in a mission clinic where he tries to seduce the physician's vulnerable wife with little regard for those around him. He meets the General by accident and impresses Amin. Nicholas Garrigan is at first entranced and entertained by Amin Dada's commanding personality, sarcastic wit, and unique views. However the longer Nicholas remains in the court of Amin Dada, the more complicit he becomes to the evil that is generated and the more mistakes and false steps he takes that begin to distance him from Amin Dada.<br /><br />In some ways the film is about maturity. Clever, witty, intelligent folks from privileged Western backgrounds will sometimes underestimate the level of threat and danger present in situations outside of North American culture. Dr. Nicholas Garrigan is one of those folks and his underestimation of the forces of evil bring great harm to those around him and to himself.  Amin confronts him at the end of the film for being an egotistical Westerner who had decided to play with the natives for a lark. Amin shows him that the natives don't play.<br /><br />The Entebbe Airport high jacking by the PLO is relevant to the story and young Nicholas comes very close to losing his life. Will he be a wiser man due to his painful experiences? McAvoy does such a great job of portraying this flippant egotist that even after much pain and death, I doubted that he had changed his ways. This is not a very optimistic vision of human character. In fact it is darkly pessimistic. Idi Amin Dada is a rare occurrence, a homicidal tyrant who thinks nothing of genocide. But Dr. Nicholas Garrigan is not such a rare specimen, for he represents the smart young brass egotist who can do great harm because he lacks the experience and especially the wisdom to avoid danger. When his egotism involves others in exposure to danger he certainly becomes less charming and sympathetic a character.<br /><br />The film is great entertainment, great suspense, and great acting.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FWEZ0QS8N7A7.html">A2FWEZ0QS8N7A7</a><br/><p>There is not much new light that The Last King of Scotland brings to the tragedy of Uganda under Idi Amin.  This is not history, but fiction.  Young white Scot becomes closest adviser to a brutal dictator?  That's preposterous enough, but ladling on Dr. Nicholas Garrigan's naivete and philandering with one of Amin's wives brings Last King down near the absurdist level.  The Africa portrayed, and very richly so with close-ups and other careful cinematography, is new only to Garrigan and those who have never had contact with the continent.  To those who have, it hits all the cliches and not much more.  Still, Last King has two big pluses.  First, the story -- absurd as it is -- is absorbing throughout and, second, I now understand why Forest Whitaker won the Oscar last year.  He nails Amin, his appeal, his brutality, and his buffoonery.<br /><br />Be warned -- some of King is very rough going.  Two scenes in particular -- a dead mutilated body and torture involving grappling hooks  -- are among the most disturbing I've seen in a film.<br /><br />Bottom line -- Whitaker captures Amin, but Last King does not do justice to Africa.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MNMZMM6BGLTA.html">A2MNMZMM6BGLTA</a><br/><p>I thought this was a pretty good movie.

Directed by Scotsman Kevin Macdonald, "The Last King of Scotland" filmed with breathtaking cinematography in Uganda chronicles the rise to power of Amin through the eyes of young doctor Nicholas Garrigan.<br /><br />Garrigan played by James McAvoy, was a naive, idealistic newly graduated physician who set out to Africa with the idea of helping the needy in a rural Ugandan clinic.  As a result of a chance meeting with newly annointed Amin, Garrigan becomes his personal physician and confidante.  Much to the dismay of the Brits who let Amin ascend to power, Garrian kowtows to Amin and gets on the program, being elevated to a high ministerial position.<br /><br />Seduced by the power bestowed upon him by Amin, the young doctor is blinded to the corruption of Amin's regime which has degenerated into one of torture and genocide.  Too late he realizes his mistake but is unable to leave the country being shackled by Amin and he begins to fear for his life.<br /><br />Director Macdonald takes some liberties with history but nonetheless provides a disquieting window into the morass into which Uganda was plunged by the dangerous policies orchestrated by the crazed and paranoid Amin.<br /><br />Simon McBurney playing Nigel Stone, a British foreign officer stationed in Uganda was very good in his role as was Kerry Washington playing Kay Amin.

At first enthusiastic---and taking the opportunity to get some Black female tail---the Scotman eventually realizes that Africa is no place for whitey and wants to go home. Amin hangs him from a pair of meathooks instead.<br /><br />  A vanity piece designed to get Whittaker an Oscar for playing Amin, the film is one of those White man goes to someplace third world and learns a lesson movies---usually that white people should not go or get involved with non-white countries. These can work as a ploy to use the character as a device to tell the history of that country---but this only works if the film places the character where he can see things---so the audience can see them and that the character is both likable and has a moral center. The film flounders in that the Scotsman is usually never where he should be and consequently the viewer never learns just what is going on. Unless one is cognizant of Ugandan history, the viewer cannot expect to come away from the film with anything but the most basic idea that Amin overthrew a Communist govt(NO!!!), killed many people and was possibly insane. The Entebbe ending will be inexplicable to anyone who does not know the Entebbe story. Way too much time is expended on the Scotsman having sex with Blacks and not enough with Amin. While Whittaker is very good APPEARING as Amin, he never actually PLAYS Amin. His scenes feel like a series of cameos where a main character will encounter a historical personage for a scene or two and then move on. Amin never develops as a person. We know he has personality and went bad but we never learn why. He just is always as the Scotsman finds him. The film ends during the middle of the Entebbe affair so we never even get to the end of Amins dictatorship. The film just stops. The second flaw is that the Scotsman is a potty mouthed over sexed dim bulb twit who, as, at least, two character observe rightly, really has no reason to live. So the film has no moral center at all. There is nothing there to engage or hold the viewers interest. Whittaker would have been better served by doing a straight forward biography of Amin and dumping the fictional Scotman.<br /><br />  Anderson--with a great British accent and looking like sex served up on a plate--gives a solid performance------in a nothing part that could easily should/could have been cut. She seems only to be there for the scene where she walks away from the Scotsman--and the viewer--so we can get a look at that fine jiggly thing she has down there.<br /><br />  But is that something we should be concerned with in a film about a homocidal maniac who murdered over 300,000 of his countryman and was allied with MUslem barbarians??<br /><br />  Not a bad film. Worth seeing but mostly forgettable. The definative Amin film still waits to be made.</p></br><a href="../users/A9TG2NFA614S9.html">A9TG2NFA614S9</a><br/><p>The Scottish doctor in this film chooses to hero-worship the wrong man--Idi Amin, the Ugandan dictator played brilliantly and flamboyantly by Forest Whitaker in an Oscar-winning performance. (Of course Whitaker looks like the monster.)  Amin charms and massages the ego of the star-struck physician who is insecure and incredibly na?ve. Graduating from Amin's personal doctor to his trusted advisor, he crosses the line and finds himself entrapped by his libido and his gullibility.<br /> The movie has an air of authenticity that makes you think you are actually in Uganda. It looks and feels very real and believable and gives a picture of Africa that rings true.<br /> Whitaker is extremely credible as the spellbinding leader who is also incredibly nasty to his own people. When the doctor tries to escape from Amin's clutches, he discovers firsthand the brutality of the tyrant. It's a brilliant film which uses the doctor's experience as the crucible to bring Amin's malignant dictatorship home to the viewer.</p></br><a href="../users/AE9GUE3HHOX3U.html">AE9GUE3HHOX3U</a><br/><p>This is one of my favourite performances by a male actor in film history.  Forest Whitaker is something else.  He just totally embodied his character, and he gets so into his craft.  He's one of the few actors left with total passion and heart.  My favourite scene is when they are at the airport and Forest Whitaker finds out his assistant/doctor is trying to poison him, and had an affair with one of his wives.  When he gets in his face and breaks it down to him, it was a classic cinematic moment and brilliant acting.  I also love the way "Last King of Scotland" was filmed.  All the technical aspects were overlooked by Forest Whitaker's oscar performance.  They really made it look like the 70,s.  The whole film had that 70's feel.

He arrives just as General Idi Amin Dada takes over the country in a coup, overthrowing a corrupt regime and apparantly replacing it with a populist government. Garrigan becomes Amin's personal physician and slowly begins to get sucked into the madness that overwhelms Uganda as Idi Amin brutally eliminates his enemies, real and imagined, expels the Asians who run the small country's economy and establishes an oppressive regime of his own.<br /><br />The film certainly captures the look and feel of Africa of that time, with many details you might not notice if you didn't know to look for them. The film does allow itself to reflect unnecessarily graphic violence and nudity, though. One thing I thought was interesting was how such a low-born uneducated man like Amin was able to charm the media, especially during one key TV event, and the answer is obvious: they WANTED to be charmed, they WANTED to be fooled. It is a trend that goes on today.<br /><br />The addition of actual historical footage at the end of some of the events of Idi's regime was a nice touch.

Of course it is the oft told tale of the corrosive effects of absolute power corrupting absolutely. Forest Whitaker playing dictator Idi Amin has the performance of his career.

I thought that Dr.Garrigan was interesting,but while the Movie had strong points, i just felt that Forest Whitaker was the main reason why this film worked because alot of the film was kinda there.if this film had have matched Whitaker's Intensity then this film would have swept at the Oscars in a Breeze.</p></br><a href="../users/A27H9DOUGY9FOS.html">A27H9DOUGY9FOS</a><br/><p>Before going any further, let's be upfront about what "The Last King of Scotland" is. It is essentially a fictional thriller, with a political/historical backdrop. With Forest Whitaker's highly touted performance as real-life Ugandan dictator Idi Amin, it may be natural to assume that the film is biographical in nature, but it is not. While many of the events portrayed within the film are based on actual incidents, the primary story involving Amin's white Scottish doctor (James McAvoy who is the actual lead performance) is a complete work of fiction by "Scotland" novelist Giles Foden. Interestingly enough, the original conception for this character was loosely based on the valet from Moliere's "Don Juan"--but he was promoted to a doctor, in this story, to generate more compelling ethical questions. With that clarification in place, "The Last King of Scotland" is one heck of a ride--it is a riveting thriller that also manages to provide relevant insight into the complexity of Amin's private and public personas.<br /><br />The story framework and basic setup is not unfamiliar, we've seen it in many other genres--from political films, financial thrillers, corrupt cop stories, mob portraits, and even in supernatural hokum. Basically, an ambitious young man is seduced by wealth and power. Falling under the spell of an engaging mentor, he buys into the glorious lifestyle that he has always dreamed of--sacrificing a bit of himself, and making some moral compromises, in the process. Ultimately, though, the situation gets out of hand, but it may be too late. He is now complicit in the same crimes he wishes to extricate himself from. In this case, McAvoy plays a Scottish medic who arrives in Uganda, on impulse, to "make a difference." As Amin is rising to power, McAvoy gets caught up in public sentiment and a chance meeting brings doctor and dictator together. Amin is fascinated by the young man's brash and bold nature, and the doctor is enthralled by Amin's power and charm. Forming a strong initial bond, things soon start unraveling as Amin's real nature starts to become more clear.<br /><br />The power of "Last King" comes from the fact that this bond, this relationship, is actually quite believable. You understand what would bring these two men together, and ultimately what would drive them apart. Credit the screenplay for these interactions, but it's also the actors who breathe life into a great story. Forest Whitaker, having won 1042 acting prizes for this role (OK, maybe not quite that many), is indeed phenomenal as Amin. Expertly capturing both his charm and his dangerous paranoia, it is a spot-on recreation of a man who loved the limelight. If you aren't familiar with the actual Amin, check out Barbet's Schroeder's documentary "General Idi Amin Dada" (available from Criterion) to see just how astute his portrait is. McAvoy, who some find less convincing, is actually the dramatic center of the film, however. It is his evolution from callow youth to coconspirator to victim that the film revolves around. I, for one, thought he brought a lot to the role. His casual indifference and moral ambiguity heighten this tale--it's not just a routine good versus evil story.<br /><br />Anyway, with great performances, realistic action sequences, and a tight script--I really enjoyed "Last King." It was a thriller that I found to be genuinely thrilling, and the Ugandan backdrop is portrayed perfectly. At times harrowing and brutal, this bit of fiction succeeds not only as rousing entertainment, but as a relevant historical portrait as well. KGHarris, 02/07.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TWTULVD6F22O.html">A1TWTULVD6F22O</a><br/><p>Jeremy Brock, who is a television writer, wrote a fine script a few years ago for the film "Mrs. Brown", a tale of Queen Victoria, starring Dame Judi Dench.  Brock gets another chance to deliver in his work with "The Last King of Scotland". This time his director is Kevin MacDonald. MacDonald has not yet found fame, but his 1999 documentary, "One Day in September", about the killings at the 1972 Munich Olympics put Spielberg's "Munich" to shame. MacDonald uses a semi-documentary style in creating the arresting film that is "The Last King of Scotland". So, too, like "Mrs. Brown", is the film made memorable by a performance so compelling it will be the stuff of legends, and an arresting supporting performance. "The Last King", which saw limited release, came back to many American theaters in the past month as a tribute to the Golden Globe and the newly won Oscar by Forest Whitaker for his role as Amin. In his shadow is a fine performance from James McAvoy as the FICTIONAL, callow Dr. Garrigan, the personal doctor to Amin.<br /><br />Dr. Garrigan meets Amin just as he comes into power, and quite by accident, is connected to the arresting Amin who loves all things Scottish. In 1971, at the time the movie begins, Amin overthrew then dictator Obote in a coup that was lauded both in Uganda and abroad. Obote supporters persisted in Uganda and Tanzania, attempting to assassinate Amin more than once. Amin quickly morphed from a benevolent commander of what he envisioned as a democratic, western-type rule, to a treacherous paranoid. Ethnic violence resulted in a wave of tortures and assassinations throughout the country. Amin turned on the country's Asian (mainly Indian) population and cast out Hindus, Muslims and Jews. He looted their businesses.<br /><br />Aligning himself with Muammar al-Qaddafi, the Soviet Union and the PLO, Amin was shunned by the British government and the foreign press. His behavior became more and more unhinged as he attempted to keep close to the customs he had once revered by dressing in Scottish garb, throwing fetes with Scottish themes, and finally resorting to costumes of all kinds. In 1976, PLO supporters hijacked a French plane and 256 hostages were held at Entebbe, on the ground in Uganda. Amin visited the hostages and finally brokered the release of all but Israelis and Jews. Israel launched a rescue, which has been featured many times on film and in books, which freed all but one of the hostages, and 3 which had been killed by Ugandans under Amin's auspices. The world shunned Amin, and the knowledge of his practices of genocide (estimates of Ugandan's killed in the 8 years of his regime range from 80,000 to 300,00) became known. All charm and pretense disappeared in his last years, and his increasing paranoia and illness rendered him a monster. He was driven into exile by Tanzanian-Ugandan forces in 1979.<br /><br />In the film, against this backdrop comes the story of Amin's friendship and leverage on young Dr. Garrigan, who initially is blinded by the charm that Amin exhibits, and who slowly comes face to face with his erratic behavior and the personal threat that Amin poses to the Doctor. The film take us through Garrigan's early denials, and later to his bleak despair, unmindful affair with one of Amin's wives, and his eventual torture. It culminates in the scene at Entebbe, with the world watching.<br /><br />While the relationship deteriorates, the viewer is fascinated with Whitaker's captivating leadership and vision for a bright future for Uganda. He's persuasive, confident, and exudes charm and intelligence. He yells and shows his anger and penchant for violence with no remorse. Contrarily, he's childlike in his delight for things. He's a man for all seasons and Whitaker, with his powerful physique and a voice he is said to have taken lessons to enhance, is perfect for the role. As paranoia, greed and fame set in, Whitaker dissembles into the real Amin  - his eyes twitch, adrenaline makes him shudder and lope, he generates an aura of danger and unpredictability that has seldom been seen on the screen before. He IS Amin. McAvoy plays him off with the dawning realization of the danger his is in and his need to placate the man, while continuing to make reckless decisions that will eventually cause Amin to turn on him.<br /><br />Surrounded by the scenic beauty of the real Uganda, the red earth, the air that shimmers, the lushness of the territory and the beauty and terror of her people, Whitaker takes the film to a stunning and brutal conclusion that leaves you shaking in your seat.<br /><br />There are some editing flaws, notably in Whitaker's action scenes, some decisions made by the director that make the film sometimes a documentary, sometimes a feature. Ultimately the film is not great, just grand. And Whitaker, who has given us legendary work before in "The Crying Game" and "Bird",( and a 20 year career of dedication to acting as a craft) deserved every award he received this season.<br /><br />A fascinating film, sure to be a popular DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/A27CHILBK6HIL2.html">A27CHILBK6HIL2</a><br/><p>MOVIE: Nicholas Garrigan is a free spirit young man who has just finished med school and is aching to get away from his parents. He spins the plastic globe in his room and lands his finger on Uganda. The movie jumps right there as he travels to a missionary to be a volunteer doctor. From the opening credits and his actions with Sarah Merrit (Gillian Anderson) at the missionary we can see that this character is immature and just looking for a fun way to live.<br /><br />  One day he is stopped by the President's army because apparently the President is in need of a doctor. He drives up to find the President standing next to his car in the ditch and a dying longhorn bull laying on the side of the road. A giant deal is made over a simply bruised hand and during the chaos Nicholas takes the President's gun and puts the screaming animal out of its misery. I suppose it was the strength that Nicholas demonstrated then and there that appealed to Idi Amin (Forest Whitaker). From that point on a new friendship is made as Amin takes Nicholas under his wing to be his personal physician. Nicholas is reluctant at first to accept the offer because he knows that the missionary is in need of his help much more than the charming dictator. Of course we can't forget that Nicholas wants to live the good life, and he cannot resist all that Amin offers him. He cannot resist temptation and gives in, practically selling his soul to the devil if you will. From that point things begin to escalate and Nicholas sees what Amin truly is, and that is a power hungry murderer.<br /><br />  The story itself is an easy one to follow, and we immediately connect and relate to the main characters.  Director Kevin Macdonald gets us acquainted with Nicholas and Amin, so we sort of open up as an audience to them. We follow Nicholas' journey in that we accept Idi Amin as a fun loving and passionate leader. But as the story moves along we as an audience move away from both Nicholas and Amin. Nicholas's fatal flaw as a character is greed since he is easily tempted with material goods and the promises of fame and fortune, not to mention sexual temptation with one of the many wives of Amin. We begin to pity him for the moral mistakes he makes, but deep in our hearts we want him to survive because he was truly taken advantage of by a powerful figure. Paradise soon becomes hell, and a struggle to escape the closing grasp of darkness begins. The only flaw of the film was in its structure. Things move really quickly, it's a fast paced film, but I would have liked to linger a bit more with Nicholas' character at the missionary. I felt we jumped in way too fast, and the entire timeline of Idi Amin's reign felt like it occurred over a week. The film's events felt consecutive which made it feel like the entire film happened in a month, yet in actuality the timeline spans from 1971 to 1979.<br /><br />ACTING: Forest Whitaker gives the best performance of his career. You will not see such a captivating and authentic example of acting anywhere else. Will he win the Oscar? If it were up to me he would, but it's been hard to predict the Oscars the past few years. Now, I could go on and on about Forest Whitaker's performance, but then that would be injust to James McAvory. McAvory was introduced to American audiences last year when he played Mr. Tumnus in The Chronicles Of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch & The Wardrobe. In this film he sells the character completely and makes him very accessible. His change of character once he figures out deep of a hole he has dug himself in is perfect for the film, and he gives an equally good performance as Whitaker. Fine acting from the two, very fine.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Structural problems are minor and don't hinder the film enough to hurt its impact, the film is intense and captivating. It will be a politcal portrait that will be remembered for years to come.</p></br><a href="../users/A2VD2D1QHCMF9Q.html">A2VD2D1QHCMF9Q</a><br/><p>The portrayal of Idi Amin is right on.  His violent outbursts, followed by periods of normalcy, including immense cruelty and apparent irrationality are just what he was, as described in the media at the time.<br /><br />What is puzzling is why a young doctor had to be invented for the movie.  This fellow, just having graduated from medical school, would be intelligent enough, one would think, not to spend his career in a country he picked blindfolded, sticking a pin in a map.  And was Amin's personality so warped that he would have entrusted state decisions, and the welfare of his family, to such a person.  And the Doctor was shown as incredibly naive, in [...] a colleague, in his personal affairs . . it didn't make sense.<br /><br />The Ugandans are not portrayed very well.  They rallied for Amin's predecessor, were overjoyed when he was overthrown by Amin, rallied for Amin, and then were overjoyed again when Amin was gone.  When Amin said to the Doctor . . what do you think . . that we are children that who you can come and play with . . the movie confirms it.  These people are shown to be as children, and the Doctor does seem to be there to play his own ego games with them.<br /><br />Excellent acting by Whitaker, but the rest of the movie falls short.</p></br><a href="../users/AW99SBGWEXP0J.html">AW99SBGWEXP0J</a><br/><p>Scottish doctor Nicholas Garrigan (McAvoy) leaves Scotland after his graduation to get away from his father.  He goes to Uganda around the time that a military coup puts General Idi Amin (Whitaker) in charge of the country.  When Amin is injured in a car accident, Nicholas treats him.  Amin likes Nicholas and offers him a position as personal physician to the President.  He accepts, and soon finds that although Amin is personable and charismatic, he is also paranoid and brutal.  This is further complicated by Nicholas having an affair with Amin's third wife (Washington).  With each passing day, Amin becomes more unstable, and Nicholas finds that he cannot escape.<br /><br />"The Last King of Scotland" is an excellent film.  The two leads, Forest Whitaker and James McAvoy deliver standout performances.  They hype for Whitaker in this movie is well deserved.  It is a shame that McAvoy has not garnered similar praise.  This film offers a look into how the charismatic Amin became one of Africa's most vicious dictators.  I highly recommend this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3572FTYUQQW3P.html">A3572FTYUQQW3P</a><br/><p>This is truly an outstanding movie and Forest Whitaker clearly deserves the acclaim he is receiving from his oscar worthy performance of Idi Amin.  James McAvoy playing the doctor also did an outstanding job but is not receiving the attention he deserves but in the end this is a two man show that really just skims the surface of the characters as well as the times.  Only the two lead characters develop any depth and all of the other actors are little more than props.  Nevertheless the film is beautiful and a pleasure to watch.  In many ways this is a morality play that shows how the young doctor-- like most young men -- longs for excitement and desires to see exotic places and do exciting things, but pays for his naivete`.  We find him in Uganda caring for the poor, which he wanted to do, but he is very quickly overwhelmed by the sheer number of them, the long hours, and the lack of progress. Doing good seems to be a lot less fun than he expected and the isolation as well as the work pall. Through some very believeable happenstances he is suddenly thrust into luxury surrounding the military dictator Amin. Thus begins the doctor's transition from callow youth seeking fun and excitement into trusted confident, then into co-conspirator, and finally just another victim of the dictator's paranoia.  There are several lessons delivered by this film.  The first quite obviously is to be careful what you wish for because you just might get it.  But it also teaches you to be careful how you treat others because you may find that you need them later on.  The gratuitous insults hurled by the doctor at the British diplomats come back to haunt him in full measure.  Then we see Idi Amin who is both charming and paranoid because like Richard III when you seize power by force you can never relax or trust anyone.  So Amin sinks into paranoia and distrust and he begins to eliminate all suspected of disloyalty.  He trusts no one including the doctor and surrounds himself with thugs willing to kill and torture for him-- but this is the fate of all dictators from Tiberias to Stalin to Amin.  Eventually they live in fear and rule by fear.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this film and the characters were quite believable.  Whitaker IS Amin -- it is hard to realize that he just acting.  However, as powerful as his performance was I thought Dicaprio's performance in the Departed was better.  Plus I thought Whitaker's role was more of a supporting role.  Nevertheless this is an outstanding film and McAvoy and Whitaker deserve all of the kudo's they are getting.</p></br><a href="../users/AZCDCO6KK2T81.html">AZCDCO6KK2T81</a><br/><p>I was overjoyed to see one of my favorite and underappreciated actors, Forest Whitaker, win Best Actor for this film as it rare for African-American actors to get juicy complex roles like this one.  This film is nothing less than riveting from beginning to end.  ALL actors absolutely shine in this film, including a wonderfully and surprisingly understated performance by the nearly unrecognizable Gillian Anderson (Scully on X-Files) as a Britsh missionary.  The writing is tight with no scenes or dialogue as "filler."  In addtion, the direction is crisp and confident.<br /><br />While the historical background is fairly accurate, the story itself is fiction and was done to provide a means for the audience to get a supposedly "inside" look to this horrific, yet charming dictator and on that level and with those intentions this film succeeds.  Some of the specific brutality we see in this film (hanging people by hooks and dismemberment) committed by Gen. Amin is fictionalized so that we get an impression of the real crimes he committed against his own people.  This is admittedly exercising artistic license, but it's handled well and, I think, appropriately.<br /><br />This is a haunting film that you soon won't forget experiencing and I do mean it's an experience.</p></br><a href="../users/A30TK6U7DNS82R.html">A30TK6U7DNS82R</a><br/><p>We were determined to see all the movies that will be Oscar nominated this year, so we were overjoyed to see this one playing on Jet Blue in early January during a long slow flight battling winds on all sides.  One wanted distraction and this movie provided exactly that, buoyed by James McAvoy's delightful performance as Nicholas Garrigan, a fictional doctor drawn into Idi Amin's web of paranoia and nation-building.  A title tells us this movie is "Inspired by Real Events" but it doesn't let on that its entire frame story is a fictional construct.  We get to see Idi Amin from his doctor's point of view, only we don't of course, that's all just a story-telling gambit.  Those of you who are looking for some sort of docudrama of real events had better look elsewhere.  This is just the same olf story of, LOOK BEFORE YOU LEAP.<br /><br />Nicholas is a fun-loving hooligan from Scotland with a weakness for healing young children and taking sexual advantage of all the willing black and white women in Africa.  It's 1972 after all, no AIDS on the horizon, so as soon as Nick gets to Uganda he smiles that insouciant grin at a fellow passenger on one of those funky, strap goats to the roof buses they have in movies about Africa, and instantly the two of them are hard at it in a bus shelter.  He's adorable and deserves a special Oscar all of his own for, oh I don't know, cutest grin.  Next up, Gillian Anderson playing the Angelina Jolie part of the heroic white doctor's ignored wife, smouldering in the dust while children not her own die all around with flies on their eyelids.  Her name, Sarah Merritt, also a fictional character.  She falls hard for young Doctor Galligan, and her desire for him only increases as he charms the native children and proves himself a fit ally for her husband.  Before long, he's trying to kiss her under the Ugandan moon, and she gets all skittery like a sixteen year old virgin.<br /><br />The uproar about Forest Whitaker's performance is justified.  He really hollers great, in a new range of basso profundo we haven't heard out of him before.  Voice lessons helped him ease his way into a challenging part, but other than that it's the same old Forest we've loved since THE CRYING GAME and that movie where he's a psychic.  His eyes twitching in different directions, his vapid grin that freezes into a rictus of calculated ire.  The soundtrack of this film features a lot (and I mean A LOT) of Scottish standards re-done in African rhythms, like that movie last year in which every one of Bowie's greatest hits were sung to samba beats by that Brazilian guy.  If you liked that, and so many people do, you will definitely want to add a star to my review of THE LAST KING OF SCOTLAND.</p></br><a href="../users/A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ.html">A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ</a><br/><p>Every year I sit back and watch the OSCARS and realize that politics, popularity and past losses play into the equation too much. Yet, this time, I believe they got it right.<br /><br />In the DVD special features, the director of THE LAST KING OF SCOTLAND said that the script for the movie had been in lingo for a long time because it relied so much on casting. They had to have the right man to play Idi Amin. He had to be charismatic, youthful, large, larger than life and able to tap into a tremendous evil that erupted at appropriate times. Boy, did they find the right man.<br /><br />The movie is based on a novel written by Giles Foden. The novel depicts a fictional account of a Scottish doctor who manages to get in with the powerful leader and become his right hand man. He's blindly drawn into Amin's world, oblivious to the cruelty Amin is amassing all over the country.<br /><br />The only unfortunate thing is that IT IS a fictional account, but amazingly it gives an indepth look into a side of the man that has never been seen. The Scottish doctor, Nicholas Garrigan (played by James McAvoy), was created based on a collaboration of hundreds of stories, myths and inside tales that have circled over time.<br /><br />The unmistakable truth about THE LAST KING OF SCOTLAND is the death count and the carnage that the man is accountable for. 300,000 Ugandans lost their lives under Amin's ethnic cleansing and struggle to maintain power, including Kay Amin, and many other family members. THE LAST KING OF SCOTLAND and Amin's wrath is a testament to what can happen when power and ego corrupt a leader.<br /><br />Forrest Whitaker is amazing and the movie is not to be missed.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ.html">A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ</a><br/><p>Last King of Scotland is a strange movie. A movie that without Forest Whitaker's performance really would have fallen by the wayside in the theatres this year. Luckily for everyone involved with the film, and for audiences everywhere, it does contain Whitaker's intense portrayal.<br /><br />The story doesn't actually center on Whitaker's Idi Amin, however; it centers around James McAvoy's fictional Scottish doctor Nicholas Garrigan: a spoiled young man who feels unappreciated by his father and so chooses to spin a globe and head to the first country he lands on. This ends up sending him to Uganda.<br /><br />The sheltered, naive way that Garrigan looks at the world ends up costing him when he is enlisted to be the personal physician of President Idi Amin after a chance encounter. This film could be seen as a psychological thriller where "nothing is as it seems". It's simply set on a grander scale where you have an infamous dictator as the deceiving friend.<br /><br />The film itself gets a little slow at times, and it's difficult not to be annoyed with some of the poor decisions that McAvoy's character makes, but the acting pulls this slightly above average script into something audiences can really enjoy, although most audience members will find themselves watching passively, anxiously awaiting Whitaker's next appearance on screen, as he really carries the picture.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AYN3IIUNQCIA.html">A1AYN3IIUNQCIA</a><br/><p>young Nicholas is a scottish doctor who decides to go to Africa and become the personal physician for the Ugandin leader Idi Amin. as the doctor becomes more engrossed into the leaders life, we slowly see how Amin rises to power and in the process slowly delve into madness until he would forever be remembered as one of the most ruthless tyrants ever known. i will admit just like everyone else that Forest Whitaker's Oscar winning performance is really the driving force of the whole movie. his potrayl of Amin is both suductive and tyranical, sometimes even at the same breath. you can just feel the power he admits of screen and slowly but surley delve into a dark recess of his mind that explodes in kinetic energy. MacAvoy more then holds his own with Forest, in a role thats is a nice change from playing a fawn in The Chronicles Of Narnia. i want to clear up an issue most people are having with the film. most people are saying that Forest's role is only a supporting one and that MacAvoy is the real main character. let me be clear, according to Academy rules, an actors performence can be considered either a leading or supporting role. it all depends on what the people lobby for, trying to give the actor a better chance at winning. example, Jennifer Hudson was nominated this year for supporting even though she has more screen time then Beyonce, the leading role but they lobbied for supporting to give her a better shot at gold, which she won by the way. comprende? and plus, its really Forest who is the real lead in this film. so to see a true powerhouse performence, Last King Of Scotland is the one for you. see it for Forest.</p></br><a href="../users/A1K3NQAO49LXL2.html">A1K3NQAO49LXL2</a><br/><p>"If we had monkeys in Scotland, we'd probably deep fry them."

Although not a hero, for the bulk of the movie he was a little bit charming...therefore, he did not come off as a monster/evil dictator.<br /><br />The protagonist was not that innocent. His promiscuity (especially having sex with Amin's baby's mama and trying to bed his employer's wife) made him kind of deserve the enivitable wrath coming his way.<br /><br />The movie was okay but it had no more impact then a made for tv movie.

During his reign, three hundred thousand of his countrymen were killed.  This flawlessly-executed (no pun intended) film is a snapshot of those years through the eyes of Nicolas, a brash young doctor from Scotland who travels to Uganda via a random spin of the globe.  At first joining a medical mission desperate for doctors, he soon falls under the spell of the eloquent and unique general Amin. The Last King of Scotland title refers to Amin's years in the British Army, and his penchant for kilts.<br /><br />In this mesmerizing and alternately funny and chilling film, there are a host of high caliber perfomances, including Gillian Anderson (Scully from the X-Files) as a harried doctor who represents Nicolas' conscience, which he gladly - and somewhat understandably - abandons for the posh life as private doctor to Amin and his three wives and children.<br /><br />History is accurate here, including Amin's macabre penchant for cutting off the legs of his enemies, and putting the right leg to the left side of the body, and the right leg on the left side.  Also shown is the tense drama that was Entebe Airport, when Palestian gunmen, heeding Amin's promise of asylum, hijacked an airplane of Israeli civilians.<br /><br />This film was made entirely in Uganda, with Ugandans making up the supporting cast and the hundreds of extras.  Enjoy, but be sure to have your popcorn and snacks finished before the gruesome last quarter of the movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A31U2QT7SAL7K.html">A31U2QT7SAL7K</a><br/><p>Frightening yet captivating, Forest Whitaker appears larger than life in a role that he was destined to play, that of Ugandan dictator Ida Amin.  Possessing the imposing physical stature of the African leader, Whitaker effectively delivers as the man that brought terror and death to thousands of his countrymen as he claimed to bring "independence" to his nation.  As an actor that has portrayed characters of quiet dignity in the past, Whitaker pulls out all the stops and is deserving of all the accolades heaped upon him for his performance.<br /><br />Besides Whitaker's bravura acting, the film boasts fine work from fellow cast mates James McAvoy as Amin's idealistic yet naive personal physician, Kerry Washington as the dictator's third wife, Simon McBurney as an Englishman that truly understands the dictator's true nature, and David Oyelowo as an Ugandan doctor with hopes for his country despite the totalitarian nature of its leader.  It's good to see Gillian Anderson, late of "The X-Files" in a supporting role, though brief.<br /><br />Director Kevin MacDonald keeps the pace brisk.  Although there are some slow passages, Whitaker's riveting presence, along with Alex Heffes's tense score, makes this one truly one of the best of 2006.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NM0RAYSL6PA8.html">A3NM0RAYSL6PA8</a><br/><p>The Last King of Scotland is the story of a shallow, narcissistic young doctor who journeys to a remote clinic in Uganda for no better reason than to escape his father's shadow. Of course, like all great stories, Dr. Nicholas Garrigan isn't so much trotting across the globe as descending into his own subconscious, a place populated with the angels and demons that lurk within each of us. Is he in Uganda to help the poor, to sleep around, to play out some paternalistic fantasy, or for something else? Does -- or could -- Garrigan even know? The Last King of Scotland understands that this is the essential, and essentially unanswerable, question of who and what we are.<br /><br />While McAvoy, as Garrigan, is wonderful as the smart, but self-deceiving doctor, his real accomplishment is holding his own in the face of as astonishing performance by Forest Whitaker as dictator Idi Amin. Whitaker brings to life a multi-dimensional, manipulative psychopath drunk with the thrill of adulation and power. Garrigan becomes more than Amin's personal physician, and, eventually, emerges so enmeshed in the psychopathology of Amin that, in defending the indefensible, he is defending himself and the monstrous adoptive father he will ultimately betray.<br /><br />Gillian Anderson, of X-Files fame, is emaciated and almost unrecognizable, with a brief, and fairly weak, turn as the wife of a clinic doctor and the target of Garrigan's blunt efforts at seduction. Kerry Washington, in contrast, shows startling power as the elegant and extraordinarily beautiful wife that bore two of Amin's sons and, ignored by him, falls into a torrid affair with Garrigan.<br /><br />The ending sequence of The Last King of Scotland is brutal and difficult to watch, but ultimately redemptive. Like another great film of 2006, Pan's Labyrinth, it is a very adult meditation on the nature of our humanity in all of its nobility and brutality.</p></br><a href="../users/A140XH16IKR4B0.html">A140XH16IKR4B0</a><br/><p>What a wonderful first half of a movie! James MacAvoy was tremendous as the na?ve Dr. Nicholas Garrigan, a young med school grad who traded a safe career as a country doctor in his dad's practice for a life of adventure in a mission hospital in Uganda. Garrigan is a skilled doctor, but also incredibly callow. Arriving in Uganda at the time of Idi Amin's takeover in 1971, he intends to boff everything in sight, including the wife of his fellow doctor. Coming on the future dictator whose car has collided. Garrigan inadvertently finds favor with the strongman and soon finds himself the his personal physician. Amin then begins to give the doctor more and more responsibilities, until he is so enmeshed he cannot escape.<br /><br />(Note: some spoilers follow)<br /><br />First off, Garrigan is fictional, which gives the filmmakers a couple of options. They can either make him the eyes of the audience, a  means for letting them see events in a naturalistic fashion. Or they can use him allegorically, making him stand for something larger than himself. In the case of "Last King," the filmmakers seemingly tried to use him as both, but without success. Large swaths of Ugandan history are kept from Garrigan's eyes, and therefore our own. Amin is portrayed as large and lovable, with only a hint of the beast within. When it comes time for Garrigan to realize what a murderous monster Amin really is, Garrigan is brought up to speed in just a few minutes. It's at this point that the movie became unbelievable. We are asked to believe that everyone but Garrigan knew what was going on in the country. But the good Doctor was hardly kept in isolation, so his continued ignorance (when surrounded by those who knew the truth and were trying to tell it to him) is incredible. Garrigan doesn't even function as an allegorical figure, represting the outside world, since Amin's brutality was well known outside his own country.<br /><br />I demur from those who admire Forest Whitaker's depiction of the dictator. FW is too much of a teddy bear to function as homicidal maniac. His sudden turn from genial, oafish strongman to brooding maniac comes too swiftly to be believable. Watch the shots of the real Amin at the end of the film and in the additional material. He was a scary guy, with cold, piercing eyes. Sorry, Forest, but I would not have voted you the Oscar.<br /><br />"Last King of Scotland" is a perplexing film that could have been much more. The final scenes, depicting the Entebbe raid in 1979, exist less for what they say about Amin or Uganda than as a convenient means for letting Garrigan escape the country. Why else the brutal scene in the room adjacent to where the hostages were kept? The film's first half promised a real classic about Africa and the forces that created a man like Amin. The failure of the film's second half, with its bloody scenes of torture, indicated a failure of nerve to follow through on that promise.</p></br><a href="../users/A9I40WFF40R4.html">A9I40WFF40R4</a><br/><p>Forest Whitaker as Idi Amin deserves all the praise and awards he has received for this stunningly rich performance. He becomes the cruel dictator for every moment he is on the screen in this two-hour film and plays Amin as an extremely complex man who has had an interesting experience in the British military, loves all things Scottish and is willing to put his complete trust in a young white physician Nicholas Garrigan (James McAvoy) who goes to Uganda in the early 1970's to begin his practice of medicine. Young and full of optimism, he goes to Uganda to "make a difference," becomes Amin's personal physician quite by accident on his part and gradually becomes sucked into the maelstrom of the dictator's evil machinations.<br /><br />The music is beautiful--  for example, a native singer performs a soulful rendition of Kris Kristofferson's plaintive "Me and Bobby McGhee"-- and the filming comes off as completely authentic. My only concern with this must-see movie is that McAvoy looks too young to be a physician. Surely he would have had to have been approaching thirty to have just finished medical school, but he looks much younger. I heard an African American professor giving a civil rights speech shortly after Whitaker won his awards who in passing criticized this film because Amin is "saved and protected" by a white man, the physician. (Garrigan is a fictionalized character from the novel by Giles Foden.) I would argue just the opposite since Garrigan's life is saved by an African physican who loses his own for saving Garrigan's.<br /><br /> The DVD version has documentary footage from Amin's life that is certainly worth seeing along with this highly suspenseful movie that is not to be missed.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R602SXNGOMJ4.html">A1R602SXNGOMJ4</a><br/><p>Forest Whitaker gives a titanic performance as Idi Amin, Ugandan dictator who rose to power in the 1970s. James McAvoy plays Nicholas Garrigan, a Scottish physician who travels to Uganda for the adventure and wins Amin's affections, becoming his personal doctor. Garrigan enters into a moral crisis as he begins to realize the kind of man Amin is, and begins to fear for his own life as events spiral more and more out of his control.<br /><br />Whitaker seizes the chance to play this larger than life character and runs with it -- I've never seen Whitaker give so convincing and transforming a performance. However, as good as he is, McAvoy impressed me more. His performance as Garrigan is not as showy, but it's much more textured and subtle, and his character has the bigger arc from start to finish. Gillian Anderson also does terrific work in a small role as a fellow doctor, who understands things about Amin and the African culture that Garrigan does not.<br /><br />Unlike other recent thrillers set in African nations ("The Constant Gardener," "Hotel Rwanda"), "The Last King of Scotland" is not greatly concerned with the geo-political implications of Amin's reign. The atrocities he committed against Ugandans are given only the barest of mentions, and the film sticks almost exclusively to Garrigan and the danger he himself faces. Some may think the film is irresponsible for this reason -- that the plight of one man pales in comparison to the plight of thousands, and I can see where a criticism like that is justified. But the movie packs a powerful wallop regardless, and complaints like this seem like quibbles when up against such an entertaining movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A13DQTXG02HZC1.html">A13DQTXG02HZC1</a><br/><p>There's a saying that those whose power isn't backed up by wisdom shall fall under its own weight.

For those that are familiar with the Director's highly acclaimed "Touching the Void", "The Last King of Scotland" is depicted like a documentary with 60's grainy colour & ocassionally hand-held cameras. It's told through eyes of personal physician of Idi Amin, who happened to be a Scotsman. The movie is entitled so due to Idi's profess love of Scotland. Forest Whitaker is outstanding as the main character.  He's been known as a method actor who would BE Idi Amin himself throughout the duration of filming & he would interview Idi's family members to get his essence as right as possible.  Gilian Anderson's convincing as an English missionary doctor's lonely wife, James McAvoy who played the half man, half horse beast in Narnia is excellent in his portrayal of Idi's personal physician & so does Kerry Washington, who plays Idi's third wife. The movie has an authentic feel about it considering that it's filmed at Uganda. We must ask ourselves the purpose of having this film made.  Is it to raise awareness of the plight of Ugandans or is it simply to make a movie about a madman?  If the purpose is for the Ugandas, why is it that Uganda is still under the rule of a dictator to these days, who has reigned for the past 20 years? Perhaps, the message is the same as another movie that's in Oscar contender, Blood Diamond that "This Is Africa".  Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/ATQTE464YAZM1.html">ATQTE464YAZM1</a><br/><p>Hearing about this film was the first time I had learned of Idi Amin. I became interested with him and did some research. I read "A State of Blood," written by Idi Amin's former Health Minister Henry Kyemba, and watched "General Idi Amin Dada," the documentary shot while Amin was still in power. With knowledge of who Idi Amin was and what he was like, I went into the film excited. I couldn't wait to see how Forest Whitaker portrayed him, and how the events would be depicted. What was my opinion? Well, unfortunately, I was disappointed.<br /><br />For one, I don't see how Forest Whitaker won the Best Actor oscar. I'm not referring to his acting - that was fantastic! He portrayed Idi Amin as I imagined him from my research - a charismatic man who would win you over as a friend, then in an instant betray you without thought or emotion. The problem is, however, he's not the main character. That role goes to Dr. Nicholas Garrigan, the fictional character of the young Scotsman who Amin takes in as his chief physician. Nicholas not only has more screentime than Amin, but he is the one doing much of the action and moves the plot along. The Ugandan dictator pretty much takes the back seat to the antics of our main hero, and I agree with one reviewer that this film seems more about the folley of youth than the plight of the Ugandan people.<br /><br />Some problems arise from this. Nicholas is an odd character. He's a goofy young college kid who earns his doctor's degree and then goes to Uganda just for the heck of it, sleeps with a woman he meets on a bus and hits on the wife of the doctor he works with. While it's believable that Amin may hire someone on the spot (Amin would promote his drivers to generals) the feel of the character is just all wrong. Actor James McAvoy seems like he belongs in a teen drama rather than a biopic about Africa's worst dictator. It's also odd how he goes from supporting Amin to hating him in split seconds. It's also funny that he seems completely oblivious to all Amin is doing - I cannot believe that Amin's ministers knew of his secret killings and actions (hence why so many were defecting or getting killed left and right) yet his personal physician would not have.<br /><br />I also believe his character would have been more succesful as an observer to what was happening, rather than taking an active role. He regularly tells Amin what to do, chooses the design for a building, gets involved in intrigue with British (well, English) diplomatic officials, and is portrayed as the cause of Kay Amin's fatal pregnancy. Having fictional characters talk with real people is one thing, making them pregnant is another. (imagine an Abraham Lincoln movie where the fictional lead shoots him instead of John Wilkes Booth) It hurts the historic value of the movie, especially when it tries to do justice for Amin's victims. It also makes the opening title of the film ("This film was inspired by real people and events") a paradox.<br /><br />In truth, I did not feel like I was in Amin's Uganda. So much focus was on Nicholas and not Amin and his actions. You see one clip of someone getting stuffed into a car's trunk by Amin's men, you hear about the Jinja barracks riot, he announces his intention to kick out the Asians from Uganda on TV, and you see the fate of Kay Amin, but you do not see Amin's killings and instead are told of them word-of-mouth from a British (well, English) official. There is a lot of myth surrounding the personality of Amin, and apparently the writers were so afraid of putting any in the movie that they kept to the bare bones. Watch a documentary on Idi Amin and you'll probably get more information on what he did than this film shows.<br /><br />Actually, the final sequence in the film (involving the Entebbe scandal) is the most bizarre. Entebbe happened from July 27 to July 4, yet the movie makes it seem like it happens within 3 days. In one day the Palestinians land at the airport, Amin addresses them, Dora Bloch is sent to the hospital, and non-Israeli hostages are released - the end credits later say that 48 hours later the Israelis freed the hostages. (uh...what?) To top it off, Amin has his men torture Nicholas right there at the airport, with lots of international witnesses and the international press nearby. His men then, for some bizarre reason, leave Nicholas alone right there in the open where any one could see him - apparently because they thought they'd have a drink before killing him. (don't they do that in Bond films?) What happened to killing someone and feeding them to the crocodiles, or making it look like an accident?<br /><br />On a final note, the directing by Kevin Macdonald is erratic and at times annoying. Any time Amin does something with his hand there's a zoom in: beats his chest, zoom in; points his finger, zoom in; taps his forehead, zoom in. Many scenes involving action or tension involve random close ups and shaky cam - which I really, really hate. When something happens you expect that the audience would want to understand what's going on, but ever since "The Blair Witch Project" and "The Bourne Identity" it seems like directors think audiences want the movie to enduce vomit. Some of the more artsy sequences are hit and miss: the sequence where Nicholas learns of Amin's mass killings was well done, but the sequence where Amin announces on TV that the Asians are being expelled plays like something from a sci-fi movie.<br /><br />"The Last King of Scotland" is not necessarily a bad film - it can be enjoyed as a one-time viewing, in fact it should be watched so that it can be proved that Forest Whitaker has been the most underrated actor for the past few decades. It is, however, not the great shining film of the year as so many critics made it out to be. It may have been a goal to tell the true story of Amin and the horrors of his regime, but it turns into a story of foolish youth and another chance to stick it to the British. (well, English)</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>This is one of the few times I actually dozed off to sleep from time to time while watching a movie. Forest Whitaker is the real deal here and deserves his praise, but I still can't believe Leonardo DiCaprio didn't get a nomination for The Departed. That was the performance of the year for me. The movie was pretty good at times, but it just didn't have enough substance to interest me for the entire length. It was good to see Agent Scully again (aka Gillian Anderson), but she was barely in the film.

I found that while this movie is a bit slow-paced, it's totally character driven and the acting from Forest Whitaker is so powerful. He's portrayal of the monstrous and deceptive president of Uganda is right on the money. I just hated his character so much and it was so hard to watch this movie for that reason, but his performance is so captivating that it was no suprise that he took home the Oscar. I also like James McAvory very much, though he's obviously upstaged by Whitaker effortlessly. Kerry Washington was very convincing as one of the wives whose infidelity caused her a tragic ending. I was rather surprised that Gillian Anderson was welling to do this movie, considered that she had to look so pedestrian and her role is minimalistic and too little screentime. There is some very disturbing killing and torture scenes that might be a bit like Hostel or Saw....</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDZNPO7U4E6N.html">A1CDZNPO7U4E6N</a><br/><p>Despite all the hype surrounding this movie, I thought it was kind of dull. All the blood, guts, and gore I heard people talking about was almost non-existant. I was expecting to see the real story of Idi Amin, something harsh and brutal, but what I saw was a disapppointment. I didn't get to see any of those things. This movie is about his pyhsician..NOT HIM! Frankly, I this movie didn't show me anything but the rantings of a madman, and you sort of have to use your imagination for the rest of it. It had just a few scenes that make you cringe. Overall, I think that it failed to capture the whole story. They told you about the killings throughout the movie, but they never actually show you him killing anyone. I'm sorry, I just didn't get the full effect that I was expecting. Don't get me wrong, Forest Whitaker is awesome as always, and he did a good job playing this role, I just wasn't impressed with this movie. Frankly, I'm not the type that gets easily moved by blood, guts and gore, but if you're gonna make a movie that is based on a real person and real events then you shouldn't hold back. I couldn't help but think they could've taken this a step further, but they chose not to. I think that it focuses more on Dr. Nicholas Garrigan, and how he was mezmerized by the person he thought Idi Amin was in the beginning, so much to where he even became his personal physician. Then, he slowly realizes that the man that he has so much respect and admiration for indeed a murderous madman that's corrupted by power. I think I was expecting this movie to go more into depth about the vicious tyrant Amin was, and show more of his tirades and massacres, instead of them just telling me about it. They never show him refer to himself as "The Last King of Scotland" the press said that's what they heard he was calling himself. The stories suggest that he was a cannibal. I saw nothing to support or deny that either.  This review is only an opinion, and we all know what they are like, but I just don't share the same feelings that a lot of other viewers did. On top of that, the documetary on the DVD "Capturing Idi Amin" doesn't make him seem so bad. In fact, it seems like despite the stories we have heard about the killings of over 300,000 Ugandans a lot of them still love and respect him, and some still consider him a good man and a hero.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M5O6UHXO9IBU.html">A3M5O6UHXO9IBU</a><br/><p>Does anybody else find Forest Whitaker irritating? It's probably sacrilege to say it, but I've always found him over-earnest, even in junk like "Species". Anyone who caught him recently in "ER" vicing someone's hand were subjected to the full range of tics, eyeball bulging, sweating and imposing theatrics he could muster until total thespian meltdown was achieved.<br /><br />This film didn't appear to have any purpose other than to distress the viewer as much as possible. The Man Called Horse scene right next to an international incident was silly and if Amin didn't sow his wife's body parts up in funny ways as most commentators have suggested, why pander to possibly racist myths? Most puzzling.<br /><br />I did however like the Scottish guys performance and the direction was reasonable. Amin was miscast but that is where we came in.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>Such a character as Amin Dada is hateful, and absolutely repulsive. To make a film about him is even worse than the character himself because we cannot dismiss the story at the end of the film and have to realize it is a true story that can happen again any time. Some westerners will come along and install some bloody tyrant in the place of a leader the said westerners will not like. Then they will always manage to get rid of this tyrant after, in this case, six hundred thousand dead. It is always easy for the west to sacrifice a few hundred thousand people in some supposedly backward and underdeveloped country. But the film is disgusting because a young and small Scottish doctor who is running away from his oppressive father gets baited by the monstrous grotesque and disgusting tyrant in some kind of perverse father transfer. This young kid is silly, unconscious, absurd, idiotic, criminal, absolutely spaced out to the point of making love to the President's wife and what's more getting her pregnant. She will end up dismembered and a few other Elizabethan niceties in front of her own children and he will nearly die hanging from butcher's hooks in the chest and bled like a pig if a Ugandan doctor did not save him and help him escape though he will die, and he knew it, five minutes later with a bullet in his head. We can always content ourselves with the idea the tyrant was a tyrant. But how can we satisfy our doubts with the idea that a western doctor could be the willing accomplice for a while at least and then the cowardly accomplice in spite of all his education and oaths. He does not even have the courage of killing himself to maybe remain clean in his own eyes.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine & University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne</p></br><a href="../users/A1VABWDOUQLULZ.html">A1VABWDOUQLULZ</a><br/><p>I'm always a bit miffed with theatric portrayals of historic events that seek to make a real life tragedy more dramatic.  What happened in Uganda didn't need embellishing for mass consumption.  That said, the film was well done and Whitaker earned his accolades fairly.  McAvoy was great in it, as well.  The writing was not terrific by any stretch, and either the direction or editing caused the plot to fall apart about a third of the way in.  I'm not sure which it was, but after a wonderful carefully paced setup, events encapsulated and started to be so disjunct that they seemed out of character.  I stuck through the latter half of it mostly to stay with Whitaker's performance.</p></br><a href="../users/AUDSM2CTLLW1Q.html">AUDSM2CTLLW1Q</a><br/><p>A slightly fictionalized story set against the backdrop of one of the more horrific dictatorships in history, "The Last King of Scotland" proves to be a cinematic gem with one of the most outstanding performances in film history.<br />  Forest Whitaker portrays the notorious Ugandan dictator during his rule in the 1970's.  To provide a reference angle for that time, the composite character of Nicholas Garrigan (played by Jim McEvoy) is created.  Loosely based on several individuals from that time, he is reckless, bored young doctor who travels to Uganda in search of adventure and ends up becoming Idi Amin's personal physician where he is charmed, intoxicated, and eventually terrified by Amin's power.  He bears witness Amin's purges of his enemies (real and imagined), his paranoid expulsion of Asian business from the country, and his involvement the Palestinian terrorists who hijacked an Air France passenger jet.  While there is certain dramatic license taken with actual events, this film does a masterful job at portraying this monstrous individual.<br />  Whitaker gave his all to perform the role of Ugandan dictator Idi Amin.  He learned Swahili and was able to adopt his West African accent.  In addition, he learned all the mannerisms and personality traits of Amin.  His transformation was so completely that, for months after filming was completed on this film, Whitaker would still slip into his Idi Amin persona.  The result was almost indescribable in its excellence.  Whitaker may have been the most deserving winner of the Best Actor Oscar in history.<br />  "The Last King of Scotland" derives its title from Amin's obsession with Scotland.  He even offered to be Scotland's King (hence the title), but the offer was understandably rejected.  This movie is not a film for the faint of heart.  It is unflinching in its portrayals of Amin's atrocities.  But, for those who do see it, the power of this portrayal will stay with you long after you leave the theater.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL.html">A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL</a><br/><p>The first thing that strikes me about 'The Last King of Scotland' is that it is such a rewarding movie to watch.  Thinking it would be a politically correct history lesson, I was happy to find it has a compelling story, as well as a striking portrayal.  While recent nominee, Forest Whitaker, as the self-titled bloody dictator, Idi Amin, has been justly heralded, the whole movie is effective and includes other fine performances.<br /><br />It all starts in 1970 in Scotland where Nicholas Garrigan (James Mc Avoy--remember him as Mr. Tumnus in 'Narnia'?) becomes a doctor with glowing admiration from his doctor father.  Rebelling against the mold as many of his generation, he spins the globe to give himself the fate of going to Uganda.  There he immediately makes a big impression, even at first making a dent at the local clinic.  He's come at a crucial time when a military general has taken over the government.  He and his love interest, Sarah (Gillian Anderson), go to one of Amin's speeches.  They leave early, but are diverted to meet the charismatic leader after he has hurt his hand in an auto accident.  Helpful from the first, Nicholas is summoned to become Amin's personal physician.  He declines at first, wanting to be the humanitarian he came to be, but, after a party and a series of assignments, he can no longer refuse.  Amin was a polygamist with many children from each wife. After healing a boy after an epileptic fit, Nicholas becomes a top aide.<br /><br />What's so effective about how director Kevin Mc Donald unfolds the story is that, even knowing Amin's history, the brutal nature of his bloody regime reveals itself as if for the first time.  McAvoy's performance puts us in the driver's seat, and from there we get conflicting evidence.  There's a harrowing scene as Amin's enemies fire at Nicholas and the tyrant in Nich's newly acquired car.  Then, there's the nature of Amin himself.  He is so funny and affable--such a likable host, we briefly forget that he's a dictator.  In one scene he has a double as himself play a practical joke on Nicholas.  (The jokes are more unnerving than his temperamental side, for it has us holding our breath for the other shoe to drop.)  His generosity toward Nicholas make him seem so human.  That is until we start to see his paranoid and fickle side slowly develop.  In the meantime, Nicholas is approached by a British official, Nigel (Simon McBurney), who seems to be steeped in his own self-interest...even though eventual mounting evidence supports his claims.  He also develops a dangerous alliance with Kay (Kerry Washington), one of Amin's wives.  Between his slowly growing knowledge and some unmentioned missteps, Nicholas is sitting on a ticking time bomb.  Harrowing, but more thoughtful than most chase movies, 'The Last King of Scotland' is a sharp and skillful reinenactment of a dark chapter of history.</p></br><a href="../users/ABP69F7LFTI1R.html">ABP69F7LFTI1R</a><br/><p>Edy Amin was so unstable and childish, but he was very charming when he wanted to be or wanted something. He also wielded a lot of power, his army was loyal and would do his bidding.  He was a complex leader who's intense paranoia lead to his eventual downfall. Forest nailed the part.  Excellent movie, don't miss it.</p></br><a href="../users/AY46DEOJJYFTW.html">AY46DEOJJYFTW</a><br/><p>Dr. Garrigan(James McAvoy) graduates from medical school and heads to Uganda to escape his overbearing father and fullfill his idealistic dreams of helping the poor. Through his eyes we see a nation in the grip of a military takeover under the powerful and mad despot Idi Amin. Forest Whitaker gives a stunning, mesmerizing performance. When Dr. Garrigan witnesses then helps Idi Amin after a car accident, Idi Amin is taken by the young doctor and offers him a job as his personal physician. Against his better judgement and against the advice of some more world weary Brits, Dr. Garrigan is taken in by the affable and personable dictator. Much like the nation is until the dark side of the man is revealed. In an incredible scene when he is first presented Forest Whitaker shows the persona, the danger and the monster of Idi Amin. You know this is road to danger but you can't help but follow the powerful story. Dr. Garrigan's naivety is sometimes unbelievable but this movie is wonderfully shot, told and written.</p></br><a href="../users/A39IBJB2PBVC7I.html">A39IBJB2PBVC7I</a><br/><p>What you notice most about The Last King Of Scotland is excellent cinematography, the recreation of Uganda in the 1970's is lovingly crafted and convincing, from the interior decor to the music to the colorful clothing and culture clash of western influence with African traditions.  Director Kevin Macdonald does what only great directors can; he takes you to another place and time and lets you inhabit it.<br /><br />Watching the film I was reminded of Caligula, whose descent into madness bathed Rome in blood and cruelty.  But Caligula was never charming.  The first half of this movie shows a charismatic Idi Amin, larger than life, riding high on the love of his people.  (This was before he slaughtered 300,000 of his countrymen and fed his ex-wives to crocodiles.)  We are swept up into his force of personality just as our protagonist, Dr. Nicholas Garrigan, is swept up in it.  That works, although it must be pointed out that despite a terrific performance by James McAvoy as Garrigan, he is dreadfully miscast.  Despite all that happens to him, he never looks older than 19, which compounds his already maddening innocence.  Next to Amin, Whitaker, he looks 12.<br /><br />Whitaker's performance has been justifiably praised; it's a performance of a lifetime for him.  However, that sleepy eye of his is really getting tiresome, especially when playing a historical figure whose face is well known.  Also, there is a weight to Whitaker's persona that is distracting, one gets the sense that he is so profoundly miserable, nothing could ever make him even slightly happy.  This gloom is highly evident in interviews.  Though he is clearly of the "method" school, this ponderous quality does make it difficult for him to disappear into parts, often he wears them.<br /><br />One quick aside regarding Gillian Anderson who plays Sarah, wife of Dr. David Merritt.  Ever noticed that when Brits venture forth into the most God-forsaken remains of the empire to live on beetles and grubs and do good in a general sort of way for no particular reason, they invariably look like ex-runway models?  Ms. Anderson is breathtaking, and the alleged romantic encounter with Dr. Garrigan, still shaving with a rubber razor, is beyond ludicrous.<br /><br />The film concerns two men, Amin and Garrigan, both losing their souls in parallel.  Garrigan is a clueless twit high on a sense of adventure.  Amin is more duplicitous, and as Garrigan grows foul with corruption, Amin grows horrific in his madness.  The most memorable exchange of the movie comes when Garrigan tells Amin that he is a child, and that is why he is so terrifying.  That's quite true.  On the world stage, Amin was always a joke, a sort of revolting, embarrassing joke that made you ashamed to be a human being.  Director Macdonald took on a hard topic with The Last King Of Scotland, and he truly did it justice.  Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A34PAZQ73SL163.html">A34PAZQ73SL163</a><br/><p>I just saw this movie for the first time today and can say little more than that I was stunned by its flow, power, and excellence. Whitaker's portrayal of Amin was absolutely magnificent. Indeed, I don't see how his roll could have been improved by any other living actor. We find Amin haunting, crazed, diabolical, and charming--traits which completely summarize the man. The seduction of the main character is in keeping with the unique allures of evil and its corruptive power. I suspect that a lot of viewers may feel rather uncomfortable with the naivet&eacute; of Dr. Garrigan in regards to his master and towards Africa on the whole. It's a good thing they do because his character personifies a common western attitude towards the continent. Personally, I meant what I wrote in the title as I could not stop watching the movie once it began. Kevin Macdonald is an outstanding director and I look forward to his work in the years to come.</p></br><a href="../users/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ.html">A12X2J7AVZ04IQ</a><br/><p>This is said to be fiction, but the subject of that fiction is as frightening as anything you may ever see. Idi Amin certainly had charm, charisma, and all the things I've learned to avoid in people as I've gotten older. It's never what it seems... James McAvoy is really the lead, and it's his observations that create the center of this fine film. Forrest Whitaker justifiably won many awards for his powerful, insightful portrayal, though he really wasn't the lead character. Known for generally sweet-natured performances, Mr. Whitaker has a repertoire that is most respected. This display of total control and command of the character is frightening and complete, a tour de force. Anyone remember his magnificent performance as Charlie Parker in Eastwood's "Bird"? Though he wasn't the main character, this man created memorable moments (not unlike other Oscar winners with limited screen time, like Anthony Hopkins in "Lambs" or Geoffrey Rush in "Shine").  James McAvoy was given a bad rap by many, but I thought he was terrific. Kerry Washington, too was excellent, and te direction & editing were to the utmost power of the simple story being told.DVD extras are insightful, and Mr. Whitaker's humble approach to the frighteningly powerful role is well examined. The atrocities committed by Idi Amin are only history now, and the idea that such people still exist cannot be ignored. Even as fiction, this depiction of a power hungry maniac can't be discounted by a caring world public.</p></br><a href="../users/A1POFVVXUZR3IQ.html">A1POFVVXUZR3IQ</a><br/><p>The Last King of Scotland truly showcases Forest Whitaker's talents as an actor. He brings to life the brutal dictator Idi Amin of Uganda, who during his reign as President of Uganda, was responsible for the murders of 300,000 people, thus earning himself the title of one of history's worst mass murderers. Forest Whitaker is able to personify Amin through his authentic accent, his gestures and mannerisms, and it his electrifying portrayal of Amin that makes this movie shine. The other main character, the fictional Dr Nicholas Garrigan, is played effectively by James McAvoy, and his portrayal of the charmed and naive young doctor who later views Amin with repulsion is convincing. The one complaint I had with the movie was the lack of depth in exploring further the complex character that was Amin, who at first seems the benevolent leader, and gradually turns into a despot, & ruthless murderer, appearing more deranged as his reign finally came to an end with his expulsion out of Uganda. For a more in depth insight into Amin, I would recommend General Idi Amin Dada - The Criterion Collection [DVD].</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>THE LAST KING OF SCOTLAND delves into the history of Ugandan leadership in the 1970s with gusto.  One of the characters (Sarah, the doctor's wife) wisely observes that the crowds that fill the streets cheering as Idi Amin takes control from Milton Obote had the same reaction for the previous dictator and will have the same for the one who follows Amin.  It is that aspect of this very fine film that hits home: the people desperately want to be ruled by a hero who will care for them and they maintain hope that each successive 'hero' will be better.<br /><br />Director Kevin Macdonald bases his 'biography' on the fictionalized novel of the same name by Giles Foden, transformed into a fine screenplay by Jeremy Brock.  In order for us to understand the full nature of Idi Amin the story is told through the eyes of a fresh young Scottish physician Nicholas Garrigan (James McAvoy) who leaves his home looking of adventure and settles in Uganda as a mission doctor with Dr. David Merrit (Adam Kotz) and his beautiful wife Sarah (Gillian Anderson).  Garrigan learns his role quickly, is attracted to Sarah, but Sarah is wise and turns Garrigan's attention to the rising problem of the overthrow of the Ugandan government by the enigmatic Idi Amin (Forest Whitaker).  An incident occurs that draws Garrigan into Amin's favor and much against the advice of Sarah, Garrigan falls under the spell of Amin, becoming his official physician.  The two men form a warm bond of friendship and trust and it is through this bond that we see the human aspect of Idi Amin, a man born poor but who has risen to power due much to the connection with the British he loathes.<br /><br />Gradually Garrigan sees the inner workings of Amin's mind, his madness and his ever-increasing brutality as he faces a world as the dictator who will control everything.  Garrigan has an unfortunate affair with one of Amin's wives Kay (the very beautiful and gifted Kerry Washington) and as the country is falling under the slaughtering of Amin, Garrigan finally sees his implication in the rule and undergoes the turnabout effects of Amin's brutal strategy.  The film ends very quietly with and reenactment of the incident at Entebbe that brought the world's attention to the heinous dictator of Uganda.<br /><br />Forest Whitaker is brilliant as Amin: he has obviously studied the man from newsreels and has been able to go beyond press reports to find the humble man who rose to power.  McAvoy embodies the fictional physician and has far more screen time and a more sophisticated role than Whitaker and deserves more praise for this performance than he has received.  The entire cast is excellent. For once a film about the violence that erupts too often in Africa pays more attention to characters and the gorgeous landscape of Africa than to fighting and killing: the evidence of Amin's mass murders is shown in photographs and the monstrosity his deeds is carefully focused on one particularly heinous death.  The musical score by  Alex Heffes uses native songs and rarely calls attention to itself - the mark of a brilliant composer.  In the end THE LAST KING OF SCOTLAND serves up a hefty slice of history altered by fiction to enhance the storyline but presents a case for how Amin came to power and the indomitable spirit of the people of Uganda despite the government.  A fine film on many levels.  Grady Harp, April 07</p></br><a href="../users/A2R6RA8FRBS608.html">A2R6RA8FRBS608</a><br/><p>"The Last King of Scotland" impressed me greatly. This is a story that deserves to be told so that the world will always know the ruthlessness and brutal violence perpetrated by Idi Amin and his regime while Amin was in power in Uganda during the 1970s. Even though I had a fairly good idea of how it all would play out after the first thirty minutes or so, I remained glued to the screen by the acting and the overall story line being played out so very well. Forest Whitaker's performance as Idi Amin lacks nothing; he deserved both the Oscar and the Golden Globe awards that he won for his performance. Equally convincing and special is the fine acting work of James McAvoy as the young doctor Nicholas Garrigan. Kerry Washington turns in a stunning performance, too. The cinematography and the choreography are wonderful and the musical score enhances the movie even more.<br /><br />When the action starts at the beginning of the 1970s, we meet young doctor Nicholas Garrigan (James McAvoy) who, fresh out of medical school, travels to Uganda to help the poor and needy who don't have access to doctors there. However, Nicholas is rather na?ve; the extreme paucity of medical care shocks him and he feels overwhelmed. Nicholas and his boss' wife Sarah (Gillian Anderson) attend a speech given by new Uganda leader Idi Amin (Forest Whitaker). Although Sarah remains unconvinced that Amin will be anything different from his far less than admirable predecessors, Nicholas falls for Amin's charm and optimistically enjoys the event. Unexpectedly, on the way back from the rally Nicholas is called to help Amin who has hurt his hand in a car accident; and it isn't long before Idi Amin invites Nicholas to his presidential home in Kampala where Amin alternately insists and sweet-talks Nicholas into becoming his personal physician.<br /><br />Nicholas is swept up into Amin's world and for a while he enjoys the benefits of his new position and power--Amin buys him expensive suits, a Mercedes and introduces him to VIPS at social parties and government events. Amin even asks Nicholas to take his place at a meeting where he must pick a design for a new building in Kampala! Nicholas is particularly struck by one of Idi Amin's beautiful wives Kay (Kerry Washington); Nicholas is something of a womanizer and the attraction between Kay and Nicholas becomes part of the plot.<br /><br />It also isn't long before Nicholas begins to realize that Idi Amin might not be such a wonderful man. Nicholas eventually discovers that Amin orders hits on people who oppose him politically; and there's even one occasion in which Nicholas himself accidentally becomes a catalyst for someone being killed. Once he realizes that Idi Amin is inhumane and vicious to say the least, Nicholas wants to leave Uganda to return to his native Scotland; but Amin refuses to let Nicholas go! There is also some racial tension building as the movie progresses; Nicholas is increasingly seen as "the white man" even though he harbors no hate toward Ugandans.<br /><br />I've left out some of the plot so as not to spoil it for you; and I won't say much more about what happens during the rest of the movie in case you do not know where all this leads. Suffice it to say that there are a few interesting plot twists and you will be fascinated by the action. However, there are also a few grisly scenes especially near the end of the movie so I certainly wouldn't recommend this film for young children or anyone else who might be sensitive to this.<br /><br />The DVD comes with a few extras: an optional running commentary by director Kevin Macdonald; deleted scenes; a bonus entitled "Capturing Idi Amin;" "Forest Whitaker `Idi Amin'" and more!<br /><br />"The Last King of Scotland" showcases spectacular performances by Forest Whitaker, Kerry Washington and James McAvoy; it's an essential film for fans of these actors. At the same time, of course, the film tells the story of just how brutal and inhumane Idi Amin was during his reign of power; this is a story of a mad dictator that deserves to be told and remembered for all time.</p></br><a href="../users/AJ9W09EUQPAKE.html">AJ9W09EUQPAKE</a><br/><p>The Last King of Scotland is both a showcase of superb acting performances and a taught, suspensful thriller. I highly recommend adding it to your collection.<br /><br />Few people are familiar with Idi Amin, not one of the 20th Century's more famous dictators, but extremely bloody with an estimated 300,000 Ugandans killed under his regime. Forrest Whittaker deserves his oscar as the paranoid, playful despot capturing the ruthless side but also, most difficult, his playful side. There are superb moments such as when the dictator's eyes light up at the sight of Dr Garrigan's Scotland vest and he impishly declares his son is called Campbell in honour of his love of Scotland.<br /><br />McAvoy is also superb as Dr Garrigan, a naive and cocksure young Scottish doctor who becomes embroiled in the terror, paranoia and corruption of Amin's regime, and there are masterful support roles, most notably Simon McBurney as the pompous British Foreign Office official who informs the arrogant Garrigan of his mistakes.<br /><br />The final scenes featuring mutilated cadavers and meat hook torture is not for the faint hearted. But the violence is structurally necessary and not at all gratuitous.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ARRAMXWT83PT.html">A2ARRAMXWT83PT</a><br/><p>Very powerful true story, starring two excellent performances from Forest Whitacker and James McAvoy, as a doctor who travels to Uganda and becomes the personal assistant to the president, who is a brutal tyrant and a ruthless murderer. For Whitacker, this is the role that will be remembered for years to come. At once awkwardly friendly, then vicious at the drop of a hat, he creates a character that is so authentically realized, you forget that he is delivering a performance.

From this close perch, McAvoy's character (Nicholas Garrigan) is witness to the cruelity and brutality of Amin, played by Forest Whitacker. Mr. Whitaker is no less than sensational as the paranoid, murderous, emotionally immature dictator put in power by the Bristish (or so the film implies). Mr McAvoy at first seems a light weight both physically and dramatically to Mr. Whittaker's overpowering Amin, but as the film proceeds, Mr McAvoy develops a stronger screen presence. THE LAST KING OF SCOTLAND is an entertaining peek at some contemporary African history, unfortunately all too often tragic.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PBV1899CX3TE.html">A2PBV1899CX3TE</a><br/><p>In The Last King of Scotland, Forest Whittaker won an Oscar for this portrayal of Ugandan dictator, Idi Amin. Forest has a slight asymmetry to his face, where his eyes don't quite match, and while Idi Amin didn't possess this facial quality, Whittaker made good use of it for a "crazy eyes" effect. Soon you totally accept him as Idi Amin, you can't see the Forest for the Idi, you might say. He has a great accent, too, speaking with a British accent, reflecting his time in the British Army, since Uganda was a British colony up until 1962. What made the Oscar people take notice, I think, was how he was able to capture the mad dictator's charisma, the sweet and seductive charm, and then gradually reveal the terror of what was happening in Uganda.<br /><br />In interviews with the actor and director Kevin Macdonald included with the DVD they talk about how they didn't want to demonize Idi Amin. It is not exactly Springtime for Hitler, but it does show another side of him. He is ultimately revealed as a monster, but he was also a charismatic leader who did a lot of good for his country and people--when he wasn't killing them.<br /><br />The screenplay was based on a novel by Giles Foden. The story is told through the eyes of a totally fictional character, Scottish doctor Nicholas Garrigan (James McAvoy). He is a strange looking man, and one of the opening scenes shows him screaming, as if having a nightmare, and he looks positively wraith-like. Not sure if this was supposed to be foreshadowing of the horror to come, or if he was just screaming out of boredom. Wanting to get out of his hum drum life and have some adventure. Once he gets to Uganda and becomes Idi Amin's personal physician, he proves an excellent foil for the dictator, and provides an interesting perspective to tell the tale. Whittaker has a way of calling his name, "Nicholas, Nicholas" that is sweetly sing songy, but becomes increasingly disturbing as the terror ratchets up.<br /><br />Alex Heffes composed music for the soundtrack, that is mostly good to adequate, but the best part of the soundtrack is the different African songs used. They really convey the excitement, vitality, and promise of an old country struggling to come into the modern world. Toko Momo by Wandel, Nakawunde by Percussion Discussion Africa, Afro Disco Beat by Tony Allen, Save Me E. T. by Mensah & The Tempos Band, Grazing in the Grass by Hugh Masekela, Kasongo by Afrigo Band, Fever by Jingo, Bukom Mashie Mashie by Oscar Sulley & The Uhuru Dance Band, Love Is You by Ofo The Black Company, and Acholi Pot Song by Ndere Dance Troupe really contribute to the excitement of this fine film. There are even a few songs done African style that speak volumes about Uganda's colonial past: Me and Bobby McGee by Angela Kalule and The Bonnie Banks O' Loch Lomond by Nyzonza Singers.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>As much as I enjoyed this film Forest Whitaker's portrayal of Idi Amin is frightening. When you first meet Amin he is fun, approachable and it was easy to find inspiration in his words and personality. Throughout the movie his personality changes from inspiring to paranoid and terrifying. Whitaker's performance flows naturally in and out of these two men trapped in one body. He never misplaces his anger in a sweet scene; his glints of admiration never seep out during a frenzied rant. Whitaker avoids all hints of schizophrenia and ignores all opportunities to dive into multiple personality disorder. Garrigan is unaware of what's happening in Uganda at first, but even after he realizes what Amin is doing, he does nothing to stop him. During the movie, I had to restrain myself from yelling at Garrigan to stop what he's doing, to leave right away or to just do what had to be done. McAvoy's seamlessly grows his character from an acorn to a diseased oak.<br /><br />The supporting cast isn't outshined by the main characters. Kerry Washington plays Kay Amin, Idi Amin's third wife. Her performance is tender, perplexing and sexy. Gillian Anderson plays Sarah Merrit, Garrigan's first love interest in the story. Her sage words and cool demeanor will be left ringing in your ears by the end of the movie. Simon McBurney, Nigel Stone's character, is monstrous in the covert, James Bond sort of way. His maniacal character is not over acted, absolutely to the credit to Stone.<br /><br />Jeremy Brock and Peter Morgan use an historic figure to tell a cautionary tale about what happens when you let fear decide who runs your country and what happens when your blind ambition overrules your moral center. Their characters are complete and lacking no texture. The temptation to make characters who are strictly monsters or heroes is avoided. Each character, even Amin, is not strictly good, nor bad, but products of their circumstances. I found the recipe for creating a monster far too realistic to be comfortable and for that I thank the writers for giving me the opportunity to feel that level of discomfort. Even the hero of this movie is only slightly heroic; leaving the melodramatic phony heroics for a superhero movie. Garrigan's transformation left me wondering if I could be any stronger than he is, given the situation he got himself into. I was impressed that the cinematographers and directors made a point of changing the camera style, lighting and framing to fit the mood of the movie. There are scenes where the sweat on someone's face seems radiant in the dark. There is an impressive use of light to set mood that doesn't fall into the clich&eacute; parenthesis.<br /><br />This shattered my personal peace. It has left me to question my own behavior. Have I paid enough attention to my own life? Have I let raw, unadulterated ambition kill parts of my humanity? What would I do in that situation? At what point would I run screaming from Uganda? Can we afford to be afraid and let that fear color our decisions when it comes to our government? How can I tell if someone is a monster when they are so charismatic? Has my ambition hurt other people?" The Last King of Scotland" is a heart pounding drama that left me uneasy, utterly disappointed with the quality of the characters' behavior and inspired by the quality of the film making. Missing this movie would be bad for your cinematic knowledge and for your personal growth.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5.html">A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5</a><br/><p>"The Last King of Scotland" is one of the most heart-pounding thrillers I have ever seen due in no small part to the fact that the film is loosely based on real life events. Despite knowing the history, I found myself cheering when Idi Amin (Whitaker) made his first speeches to the Ugandan people, about being a simple man and wanting a better Africa for all his people.  Whitaker played it like he meant it--and perhaps Amin did at the first.  Though I knew better, I truly wanted to believe.<br /><br />As Machiavelli says, "Absolute power corrupts absolutely," the veneer disappears fairly quickly.  People once in power disappear and the nightmare grows worse from there.<br /><br />There were long stretches, where I almost forgot I was watching a film instead of color newsreels.  The cast and crew of this film really created an atmosphere of being there.  "Last King" is a strong film, beautifully acted, filmed, and directed.</p></br><a href="../users/A461VTLW9G9YB.html">A461VTLW9G9YB</a><br/><p>Very good movie.

I thought he did a great job of bringing the violent, former Ugandan dictator, Idi Amin to life on the silver screen.<br /><br />Throughout the movie, I thought the character of Dr. Nicholas Garrigan was completely naive and bogus, but a REAL PERSON..... so, I kept wondering how could someone of his stature and educational level be so naive about Idi Amin's violent character for so long when he had such close personal contact with him?<br /><br />Then at the end of the movie when I was watching the special features I discovered that Dr. Nicholas Garrigan wasn't even a part of Idi Amin's inner circle and that he was a fictionalized character! No wonder Dr. Nicholas Garrigan felt completely off the entire movie, he didn't exist in real life!<br /><br />Had the unbelievable character of Dr. Nicholas Garrigan not been in the movie I would have given this movie a higher rating.</p></br><a href="../users/A27H9DOUGY9FOS.html">A27H9DOUGY9FOS</a><br/><p>Before going any further, let's be upfront about what "The Last King of Scotland" is.  It is essentially a fictional thriller, with a political/historical backdrop.  With Forest Whitaker's highly touted performance as real-life Ugandan dictator Idi Amin, it may be natural to assume that the film is biographical in nature, but it is not.  While many of the events portrayed within the film are based on actual incidents, the primary story involving Amin's white Scottish doctor (James McAvoy who is the actual lead performance) is a complete work of fiction by "Scotland" novelist Giles Foden.  Interestingly enough, the original conception for this character was loosely based on the valet from Moliere's "Don Juan"--but he was promoted to a doctor, in this story, to generate more compelling ethical questions.  With that clarification in place, "The Last King of Scotland" is one heck of a ride--it is a riveting thriller that also manages to provide relevant insight into the complexity of Amin's private and public personas.<br /><br />The story framework and basic setup is not unfamiliar, we've seen it in many other genres--from political films, financial thrillers, corrupt cop stories, mob portraits, and even in supernatural hokum.  Basically, an ambitious young man is seduced by wealth and power.  Falling under the spell of an engaging mentor, he buys into the glorious lifestyle that he has always dreamed of--sacrificing a bit of himself, and making some moral compromises, in the process.  Ultimately, though, the situation gets out of hand, but it may be too late.  He is now complicit in the same crimes he wishes to extricate himself from.  In this case, McAvoy plays a Scottish medic who arrives in Uganda, on impulse, to "make a difference."  As Amin is rising to power, McAvoy gets caught up in public sentiment and a chance meeting brings doctor and dictator together.  Amin is fascinated by the young man's brash and bold nature, and the doctor is enthralled by Amin's power and charm.  Forming a strong initial bond, things soon start unraveling as Amin's real nature starts to become more clear.<br /><br />The power of "Last King" comes from the fact that this bond, this relationship, is actually quite believable.  You understand what would bring these two men together, and ultimately what would drive them apart.  Credit the screenplay for these interactions, but it's also the actors who breathe life into a great story.  Forest Whitaker, having won 1042 acting prizes for this role (OK, maybe not quite that many), is indeed phenomenal as Amin.  Expertly capturing both his charm and his dangerous paranoia, it is a spot-on recreation of a man who loved the limelight.  If you aren't familiar with the actual Amin, check out Barbet's Schroeder's documentary "General Idi Amin Dada" (available from Criterion) to see just how astute his portrait is.  McAvoy, who some find less convincing, is actually the dramatic center of the film, however.  It is his evolution from callow youth to coconspirator to victim that the film revolves around.  I, for one, thought he brought a lot to the role.  His casual indifference and moral ambiguity heighten this tale--it's not just a routine good versus evil story.<br /><br />Anyway, with great performances, realistic action sequences, and a tight script--I really enjoyed "Last King."  It was a thriller that I found to be genuinely thrilling, and the Ugandan backdrop is portrayed perfectly.  At times harrowing and brutal, this bit of fiction succeeds not only as rousing entertainment, but as a relevant historical portrait as well.  KGHarris, 02/07.</p></br><a href="../users/A2QHM5HBSIXRL4.html">A2QHM5HBSIXRL4</a><br/><p>Forest Whitaker is spectacular here in his portrayal of Idi Amin in Kevin Macdonald's adaptation of Giles Foden's 1998 novel of the same name.  What makes Whitaker so good is this:  he doesn't portray Amin as some megalomaniac nut from the get-go.  Someone like Amin could only get to the top of the heap through a mix of talent, bravado and charisma.  And that is what Whitaker gets across:  when we first meet his Amin, you're prone to instinctively _like_ the guy.  He's charming, persuasive, personable and charismatic.  James McAvoy's character is immediately won over.  The key to the movie is that the audience has to see why Garrigan (McAvoy's role) is so smitten with a guy the world now associates with unimaginable atrocities.  Whitaker's performance conveys that initial "likeablity" in spades.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R8PXSFGY9MC2.html">A3R8PXSFGY9MC2</a><br/><p>This is the much lauded film about Idi Amin and his rise to power, his tenuous grip on his advisers and his own sense of reality and his relationship with his personal physician. It is infused with his paranoia and maniacal flips from joviality to aggression. Forrest Whittaker and Jame McAvoy play their roles superbly and Gillian Anderson is excellent, but sadly underused as an actress. This film is rich and colourful and shows to some extent what life may have been like in Seventies Uganda. I found it to be perfectly watchable and the acting impressive, but I wasn't as engrossed or engaged as I'd been lead to believe I would be (hence the 4 stars). But this is a good story, directed well, with a great African soundtrack.

Once the co-star of the film, James McAvoy as "Dr.Nicholas Garrigan," became Amin's personal doctor this film, like a good book, became really difficult to put down.<br /><br />It was a very interesting story which got better and better as it went along. It's also one you won't forget about in a few days. This one stays with you!<br /><br />In real life, Amin was a brutal man and much more so than he is portrayed in this film. It's a disgrace he was able to live comfortably in exile until 2003. Whitaker's portrayal of the sociopath doesn't touch the surface of the Amin's evilness, but Amin, truth be told, was also a charmer. It's amazing how a little charm can make even a mass murderer look like a nice guy.<br /><br />In addition to the fine acting performances of Whitaker and McAvoy, I thought the camera-work in here was well above-average, too. This is a nicely-filmed movie, and credit should go to cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle. I don't hear much praise going his way but I really liked the visuals in here.</p></br><a href="../users/A11PTCZ2FM2547.html">A11PTCZ2FM2547</a><br/><p>I distinctly remember Idi Amin.  I remember his reign of terror, his regime's genocide, his banishing the Indians and Jews who had made Uganda their home.  Then I would see a clip of him on the nightly news; Amin was smiling, he was gregarious, charming--it just wasn't possible so likeable a man could be capable of such atrocities.  When Idi Amin disappeared into exile, in 1979, he disappeared from my memory.<br /><br />Until I saw THE LAST KING OF SCOTLAND.  When I saw Forest Whitaker, the way he carried himself, the way he spoke, the way he could be so calmly maniacal. . .the hairs stood up on my neck.  Before my very eyes, Whitaker became Idi Amin, which is why this film is so believable--even though it's a fictional account of his regime.<br /><br />It's an account about Amin and the relationship he has with his personal physician, Dr. Nicholas Garrigan (James McAvoy).  Nicholas wins instant points with "President" Amin because the young doctor is Scottish--and the Ugandan leader is an enthusiastic fan of Scotland and its culture.  In the beginning, all is well and good; Nicholas becomes intoxicated with his newfound wealth and power--with his ever-increasing influence with Amin.  But everything is an illusion; Uganda is unstable, Amin has many enemies, and when the enemies rebel, the dictator responds with an iron fist.  And the relationship with his physician becomes strained; Nicholas's naivete suddenly yields to remorse, to fear, to helplessness.  This thriller ends at Entebbe Airport, in one of the most brutal and disturbing cinematic scenes I've ever seen.<br /><br />Whitaker, McAvoy, and the rest of the cast furnish unforgettable roles--especially Whitaker, who won an Oscar.  Kudos to director Kevin MacDonald for making a film that is beautiful yet brutal, a film that has heart-pounding suspense.  THE LAST KING OF SCOTLAND sends one chill after another down the spine, and brings Idi Amin back to vivid life.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning</p></br><a href="../users/A18IK6YI6T3RK2.html">A18IK6YI6T3RK2</a><br/><p>This is a fascinating film, dealing with a fictional Scotish doctor as witness to the horrors of Amin's Uganda.  The idealistic Scot is quickly charmed by the Ugandan dictator.  I think McAvoy is a perfect choice, he says so much just through his eyes, he is a witness to the horrors of this British made Frankenstein and you feel his desperation as he tries to find a way out.  Whitaker is fantastic as Amin, he is at once charming at next glace an absolute horror.  The brutality is sickening to watch, especially what is done to one of the central female leads, it's very graphic, but this guy was a sociopath of the first order.  Filming on location in Africa really makes the film come alive.  Its hard to believe that Amin lived out the rest of his days in exile in Saudia Arabia and died of natural causes in 2003, never having paid for his crimes against Uganda.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R1HAXRNU0QX7.html">A2R1HAXRNU0QX7</a><br/><p>LAST KING OF SCOTLAND suffers from some of the same problems as HOTEL RWANDA.  It is timid in its exploration of the atrocities committed by Idi Amin.  While I  have no interest in seeing horrible things happen to humans just for the sake of entertainment (I can watch HOSTEL if that's what interests me), I also feel that a true understanding of what Amin inflicted on his country is missing from this film.  The way  he's presented, he mostly seems like a charismatic but unstable leader, who become increasingly paranoid and blithely knocked off his inner-circle of advisors left and right.  He did do these things...but he inflicted so much more agony too.  If a viewer came to Idi Amin for the first time through this movie, they would wonder what much of the fuss is about.  It needs to show the SCALE of the horrors this man inflicted...just like HOTEL RWANDA needed to show us the true face of those atrocities.<br /><br />A movie like SCHINDLER'S LIST made the holocaust a personal story, but also showed the horrors on a broad scale.  LAST KING OF SCOTLAND could have done the same. (Although no doubt not as powerfully...that was Spielberg's finest effort, after all).<br /><br />But this disappointment aside, there is much to admire about this excellent film, starting WITH the charismatic performance by Forest Whitaker.  Whitaker is never less than compelling to watch.  We see many facets of Amin...from bold leader, to national hero, to simpering child, to loving father, to paranoid lunatic, to delusional monster.  Whitaker makes the man likeable for much of the film...which is important, because he is viewed mostly through the eyes of a young, white British doctor (James McAvoy) who is enticed to join Amin's inner circle.  If Whitaker played him as just a nut-case, why would McAvoy ever allow himself to become part of the "team?"  Whitaker has always been a very good actor, with a wide range.  But his Amin is the shining high point of his career thus far.  He digs into this character with great intensity...I doubt the sweat that's always beading on his face was created by the makeup team.  He looks like a guy always on the brink of exploding...whether in raucous laughter or frightening rage.<br /><br />The script hints at the horrible things Amin is up to...but Amin himself never references them.  He hides the truth from McAvoy...and thus from us.  We feel as though the good doctor is anxious to get away from Amin only because he fears for his own life...not because he's seen what is happening to the country of Uganda.  While Whitaker more than delivers on his responsibilities to present Amin as the dangerous tyrant he was...the script allows few opportunities to show what Amin DID.<br /><br />So McAvoy is sometimes left looking more mildly concerned than terrified and outraged.  Later in the film, he suffers a personal tragedy and this energizes him...but for a lot of the movie, I was wondering how in the world he was so oblivious.  McAvoy (ATONEMENT) is a charming and capable actor...but he comes across as a bit of a lightweight in comparison to Whitaker's booming presence.  But the way  his character was developed (and the doctor IS the lead role), there probably wouldn't be many actors who could have made the part as interesting as Amin.  (Although here's another problem with the script:  McAvoy's character is fictional, so part of me felt that the filmmakers were wary of showing the story through any point of view other than that of a white person.  So often the plight of minorities is depicted through the eyes of the white majority...MISSISSIPPI BURNING is the first example that pops to mind, but there are lots of others.)<br /><br />The film also offers a brief but lovely performance from Gillian Anderson, hair dyed blonde and skin deeply bronzed.  At first, I just enjoyed seeing how different she looked from Dana Scully...but ultimately I was captured by her quiet charisma.  Sadly, she is only in the first third or so of the film.<br /><br />The film also has beautiful cinematography.  The film stock was highly saturated, making the colors richer than real life.  This has the effect of conveying not only the beauty of the land, but the intense heat.<br /><br />Despite my problems with the way the script decided to tell this story, and with its assumption that we all remember the famous "Raid on Entebbe" that brought Amin to the world's attention...I still recommend the film highly.  Whitaker certainly gave a performance worthy of Oscar consideration, and the story we do get is fascinating.  I'm frustrated it wasn't more...but I very much was engaged in what we were given.<br /><br />This is the kind of film that will have folks hitting the internet for more information of Idi Amin.  That can't be a bad thing.</p></br><a href="../users/A141HP4LYPWMSR.html">A141HP4LYPWMSR</a><br/><p>Introduction: The '06 drama 'The Last King of Scotland' delivers a stellar performance by Forest Whitaker as Idi Amin in a well conceptualized, fictional account of the rise and fall of the Ungandan dictator as played out in a relationship with a visiting young Scottish Doctor Nicholas Garrigan (James McAvoy) who has come to Ugana in search of both purpose and adventure. he found both.<br /><br />Critique:<br />Positives: It was fascinating watching how the charming and charismatic Amin slowly evolves from national savior and hero to murderous madman as seen through the eyes of the na?ve Scotsman. I also appreciated how the film created the presence of violence and horror without actually having all the gratuitous visuals that we see all too frequently.<br /><br />Negatives: The one drawback for me was the portrayal of Doctor Garrigan. It's not the performance of James McAvoy I'm refering to but the character itself. Garrigan is a self-indulgent, morally weak individual who simply isn't a sympathetic figure. When things start falling about and his life is threated I really didn't care whether he survived his African adventure or not.<br /><br />I consider the 'The Last King of Scotland' to be a good but not great film. However if nothing else it's worth a watch or two for Whitaker's performance alone.</p></br><a href="../users/A5X1B2HBQUR3P.html">A5X1B2HBQUR3P</a><br/><p>Although it is based on the true backdrop of the rule of idi Amin, this is actually a fictional account. The main protogonist who plays the doctor is fictional and so should be his portrayed affair with one of Idi Amin's wives. The performance by Forest Whitaker takes the cake. He makes Idi Amin's terror convingly real. THis movie should be just seen for the performance of Forest. The climax is also just a fictional dramatization. It's for giving a good ending to an expansive film. Great cinematography and uganda locales. But just see this for Forest whitaker's performance. It's that good.<br /><br />regards, Vikram</p></br><a href="../users/A3R2YB0WTTB0IJ.html">A3R2YB0WTTB0IJ</a><br/><p>***** 2006. Directed by Kevin Macdonald who was already responsible for the great <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00020BW4G">Touching the Void</a>. Academy award earned by Forest Whitaker (Best Actor) and innumerable prizes throughout the world for the movie itself which is based on Giles Foden's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0375703314">The Last King of Scotland</a>. Idi Amin Dada seen through the eyes of a young Scottish doctor. If you liked this film, you have to see Barbet Schroeder's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000063N7E">General Idi Amin Dada - Criterion Collection</a> as a good complement.</p></br><a href="../users/A2582KMXLK2P06.html">A2582KMXLK2P06</a><br/><p>The Last King of Scotland started out slow with hardly any excitement for the first 35 minutes or so, but gradually you began to get into the story when you started noticing the king was an evil guy who wasn't afraid to kill someone.  This is when the storyline really began to pick up and catch my interest.  Forest Whitaker's acting performance was about as great as always.  It's a movie you really should watch, if you can find the patience to sit through a pretty boring build up in the beginning.  You should also know that a large part of the story is about a doctor from Scotland who becomes close to Forest's character. It's not all about Forest Whitaker as the king- there's more to it than that.</p></br><a href="../users/AJRFZ0VZ0LD26.html">AJRFZ0VZ0LD26</a><br/><p>Perhaps the best way to start this review is to praise Forest Whitaker and Gillian Anderson on their powerful performances in this movie.  Both have delivered strong characters with grace and poise.  Their accents are impeccable and portrayal of Ugandan leader Idi Amin is chilling to say the least.  Filmed from the perspective of young Scottish doctor who ends up being Amin's personal physician this portrayal of the heartless charismatic leader from an African country is unique.  It seamlessly portrays Amin's rise to power and his decline as his authoritarian regime swallows all around him, including the closest government advisors and even his family members.  Narrated from the perspective of foreigner, an outsider, young and naive Scottish doctor, gives this portrayal humanity.  No matter how flowed our young doctor is,  there is no way to justify atrocities that surround him and torture that he personally experiences.  Definitely film for young children, but absolute must for anyone interested in Africa, power and story about failed dictatorship inside an independent country trying to define itself in a new, post-colonial world.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IOJE0W1NXOSE.html">A1IOJE0W1NXOSE</a><br/><p>A young Scottish doctor longs for adventure so he spins a globe and decides he'll close his eyes and point to the place where he will go.  His finger falls upon Uganda and his fate is sealed.  At first he works at a clinic, but then his path crosses that of dictator Idi Amin and his life becomes inexorably intertwined with that of the Ugandan ruler as he becomes his personal physician.  The movie is dramatic and fast-moving and the performance of Forest Whitaker as Amin is truly memorable.  Fiction though it may be, the film is very entertaining and it does give the viewer a look at the havoc that one man can cause when given absolute power.</p></br><a href="../users/A2G8D1VN3MVB6F.html">A2G8D1VN3MVB6F</a><br/><p>This movie ia a good story, but it does not make for real great fact. Aside from that fact, it was a good way to spend a few hours. The acting was first rate as Whitaker was very convincing as a crazy maniacal madman who cannot admit the reality that surrounds his world. To Amin, the outside world is something to be denied in the pursuit of his own interests and dreams. When the outside hinder s his goals, Amin's answer is to kill those who would acknowledged the influence the outside upon his interests. The one bit of real fact that the movie catches is the suffering imposed upon the people of Uganda. Amin's terror rested great suffering upon the individuals of Uganda.</p></br><a href="../users/A39IY0JU5JI69G.html">A39IY0JU5JI69G</a><br/><p>I passed on seeing this film when it came out in the theaters, in spite of all the hype and Forrest Whitaker's Oscar win.  I thought it was going to be a biopick of Idi Amin and that didn't interest me.  However, I got it free at the library and, the night before the DVD was due, I put it in the machine to see if I might be interested.<br /><br />The fact that the protagonist was really the young Scottish dr. made it more interesting to me than I had expected.  When I watched it, I assumed that it he was a real character.  Then, by reading the reviews here I discovered he wasn't, which puts the whole film in a different place in my head.  How much was real and how much wasn't??  It could worry me a little but I chose to let it go and just enjoy it.<br /><br />Actually the use of the dr. is a smart device that works well and it certainly makes for an interesting story.  James McAvoy is a bit annoying, but that is good, too, given the nature of the fellow he's portraying.  At first I thought he was going to be a real hero and I kept wondering when he was going to wise up and get out of there. A lot about him was "wrong" --he looked way too young and was just too scrawny and silly looking to have so many women falling for him.  And what was he, really, a good decent guy who wanted to help out, or a spoiled punk who was just out for an adventure???  I thought the character was really very well written and acted by showing the complexity of the guy.  I ended up by seeing him as totally believable.<br /><br />Forrest Whittaker was superb and surely deserved the Oscar. He portrayed the full range of this distressing man's personality with brilliance as everyone here has remarked.  I especially liked the childlike, innocent facet.<br /><br />But, after all the smoke cleared, it was the character of the dr. that most interested me.  Too bad, he was fictional!</p></br><a href="../users/A31I3HXMD5H1EL.html">A31I3HXMD5H1EL</a><br/><p>Chilling, funny, ruthless, yet childlike, Forest Whitaker's 'take' on Ugandan dictator Idi Amin is truly a career-defining role, and "The Last King of Scotland" is a film worthy of all the accolades it has received!<br /><br />Told through the experiences of a young, fictional Scot doctor (James McAvoy) who comes to Uganda on a lark, and is drawn into the charismatic Amin's inner circle, director Kevin Macdonald (making his feature film debut), allows the characters time to grow, giving the film a believability that another recent political thriller, the remake of "All the King's Men" sadly lacked.<br /><br />With the naivety of a smug, skirt-chasing youth, the doctor 'buys into' Amin's promise of wealth and an idyllic existence, and the dictator's combination of flattery, lofty goals, and boyish charm seems irresistible. But, gradually, paranoia, ruthlessness, capricious abuse of power, and lack of concern over human life would reveal a far darker Amin to both the doctor, and to the world, building to a climax both frightening and brutal.<br /><br />Whitaker is the 'glue' that holds the film together, and his ability to make Amin both repellent and charismatic provides one of the screen's most fascinating portrayals of this decade. He certainly deserved his Oscar!<br /><br />Perhaps the film is a bit simplistic on the issues (England's role in Ugandan politics and Amin's rise to power wavers between self-serving and altruistic), but as a thriller, it is very effective.<br /><br />A remarkable film, not to be missed!</p></br><a href="../users/A1CYRTQ04LYI55.html">A1CYRTQ04LYI55</a><br/><p>Forest Whitaker stars as Idi Amin, in the role of his lifetime.  The movie is (very) loosely based on both the truth, and the book of the same name.  It covers a Scottish doctor who falls for the charisma of Amin, and eventually serves as one of his closest advisors.  The backdrop is the history of Amin's consolidation of power in Uganda, and other events such as the expulsion of the Asian community and the famous highjacking at Entebbe.<br /><br />The movie (more specifically Whitaker) succeeds in showing the dualily of Amin - his good humor and charisma, as well as his raw evil.  It also shows the complexity of relations between Africa and the West in post-colonial Africa.  Certainly the West is not left with clean hands.</p></br><a href="../users/A2JXAQ92WYPAAR.html">A2JXAQ92WYPAAR</a><br/><p>This is a terrific horror film to be compared favorably to "Silence of the Lambs." What a chilling, nightmarish story. I got totally caught up, especially in the decadence, which struck me as very realistic. The basement bunker filled with Idi Amin and his followers seems right on. I can easily imagine that kind of "scene" - we have seen this before with American rock stars and now with rap stars who have hit it big and don't know what to do with their power and money. It's girls girls, girls, drugs, then violence every time. The acting is very strong. Forest Whitaker is amazing, completely convincing as the sentimental monster. The rest of the cast is forgettable, but adequate; perhaps this is due to under writing the parts. None of the women for example is developed. Still, the movie is carried by Whitaker who turns in an extraordinary performance.</p></br><a href="../users/A1I7QGUDP043DG.html">A1I7QGUDP043DG</a><br/><p>Forest Whitaker as Dictator Idi Amin of Uganda will take your breath away with his performance! Based on some true events, Amin befriends a young Scottish doctor trying to find his place in the world, but Dr. Garrigan isn't prepared for the moody dictator's secret dark side. Amin betrays his friends, family and his people when his positive speeches of helping all Uganda turn out to be a layer of lies. Amin's rule becomes a nightmare and Dr. Garrigan doesn't open his eyes to the truth soon enough. The acting in this movie is just outstanding with very memorable roles. I'm certainly prompted to pick up the book that inspired the movie given the great visual version of this story.<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author</p></br><a href="../users/A2FBIF1FKBC193.html">A2FBIF1FKBC193</a><br/><p>Talk about tackling the big and prickly issues. Anyone familiar with the African continent, the wide range of countries with their respective governments will most certainly understand the poverty, misery and suffering that pretty well blankets it all.<br /><br />Idi Amin was not a verfy likeable character and he managed to keep control of his empire by taking ALL his political enemies with him whenever he left the country. By doing this 24/7 he managed to calm his paranoia until the end of his reign when things went 'amuk'. Idi Amin was one of histories smartest dictators attesting to he fact that he died of illness in Saudi Arabia many years after being ousted. That in itself was quite a feat.<br /><br />This movie takes all these issues into account and does not place itself in a position of criticism of Amin but rather that of a story teller without getting into the violence of what was realty.<br /><br />The acting is stupendous and the movie was a real pleasure to watch.....</p></br></body></html>

Movie fans expected a straight-up "Alien" prequel, complete with queens, face-huggers, and worker aliens, and 2. The film does not have a neatly laid out, simplistic plot like the usual fare we see nowadays. Director Ridley Scott decided to go his own way, not taking the easy and simple route. The result is a masterpiece of mystery and questions. Lost by the critics is Scott's examination of human nature and the desire for absolute power and immortality contained within the search for our origins.<br /><br />Prometheus asks big questions about the creation of life on Earth, as well as what might be out there in deep space beyond our present technological capabilities. Human civilization has existed for a mere few thousand years, but the universe is billions of years old. The foolish belief by many of us today that we somehow have it all figured out is exemplified in the film by the monumental hubris of Peter Weyland, who selfishly set up the expedition to somehow cheat death-and to profit by whatever else it found.<br /><br />The fact that the Engineers in Prometheus were able to create magnificent technologies on such a vast scale only amplifies the mysteries of what we don't know. The universe is vast beyond our comprehension, and the world Ridley Scott creates in this film, with it's monsters, spacecraft, and buildings reinforce his plot device. The ending of the film, with the robot David and Dr. Shaw leaving LV-223 in the Engineer spacecraft, tells us in no uncertain terms that there remains a great deal still to be discovered.<br /><br />Think about it! Humanity has only begun to scratch the surface of space travel; we've only landed a few men on the moon, and the sum total of our exploration beyond that is limited to our own solar system-which constitutes a tiny portion of the Milky Way galaxy. We humans are like a speck of sand on the shores of a vast ocean-but one must remember it was only a few centuries ago that we thought Earth was the center of the universe!<br /><br />It takes a bit more than Transformers or the Avengers (which is a good movie for its intended audience) to touch on the kind of questions Scott is tackling here. He assumes his audience will consider the questions his film is asking. Many critics condemned "2001" and the original "Alien" for the very same things people are saying now; they weren't easy to understand, they didn't fit into established categories, etc.<br /><br />"Prometheus" thus fits into something the ancient Greek philosopher Socrates said 2400 years ago: "I know nothing except the fact of my own ignorance." Scott asked us to open our minds, and see beyond the usual formula stuff. It seems some lack the imagination to follow where he leads. That's okay. I'm quite willing to go on the journey.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>Well, with almost 650 very mixed reviews already on Amazon for Prometheus, there is more than a fair share to help you determine whether or not you should be viewing this via Instant Video, renting or purchasing the DVD. I opted for Instant Video and I think that the movie is so good that I should have purchased it to put in my Blu Ray collection next to my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000VCZK2">Alien Quadrilogy</a>.<br /><br />Prometheus is a must for fans of the Alien franchise. It takes a more philosophical turn than the action-heavy Alien movies, but that's what makes it uniquely great. And don't get me wrong...there is ultimately plenty of action. It's just that Director Ridley Scott and his writing team decided to throw in the "all important" controversial questions: Evolution created Man? God created Man? Both??? Prometheus takes a ride down this slippery slope that is sure to get the ire up more from the pro-religion crowd than the scientific crowd.<br /><br />I'd be surprised if there's anyone here that already isn't aware of the movie's premise, but basically here's what you get: Some scientists/geologists/archeologists discover a clue on Earth to the beginnings of mankind that takes them to a planet/moon that will be familiar to Alien fans. There, they hope to have "the all important question" answered. And you know--by at minimum watching the trailers--that the crew get a lot more than they bargained for than just answered questions.<br /><br />The acting is awesome and the special effects are top notch. I was glued to my seat. I felt that the movie moved at a quick pace, and I thoroughly enjoyed every bit of the just over 2-hour flick.<br /><br />Is the movie flawless?...Heck, no. And if you've already seen the movie and you have not read the 1-star review on the front of the Prometheus product page here at Amazon called "Take the Scientist's Survival Pop Quiz v2.0!" on September 23, 2012 by Arthur J Bullock Jr, it is worth the short, accurate and amusing recap of the movie's major holes. If you've not seen the movie, I'd stay away from Mr. Bullock's review due to the spoilers involved.<br /><br />My take is that Prometheus fits in as an outstanding, unexpected, unique and unpredictable prequel to some of my favorite movies ever made.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RHQMV5GD18Z8.html">A2RHQMV5GD18Z8</a><br/><p>I've had the pleasure of seeing Prometheus twice. The first occasion was my first exposure to IMAX/3D and it was easily the best presentation I have ever seen in a theater. That prompted me to share the experience with two UK friends who were in town for my 50th birthday. Yes, I'm old.<br /><br />The most difficult thing to overcome when reviewing Prometheus is separating the incredible presentation from the story. Should I review the experience, or just the movie itself? I have chosen to comment on both elements.<br /><br />The opening shots immediately draw you in and establish that you are about to witness something special in terms of presentation. As the camera pans over the surface of a moon, you are part of the experience. As with Avatar, you are transported to a different world. The first shot of the ship is also effective, with the roar of the engines. Kubrick would probably turn over in his grave at the technical error of portraying sound in space, but it does add something for the viewer.<br /><br />Prometheus is quite ambitious. It does a good job of explaining some of the events that led up to the mission in Alien. We are shown some of the discoveries which prompted the Weyland Corporation to explore deep space. A crew is sent to search for an incredible secret, which I won't reveal here. Unlike other films in the Alien franchise, the presence of an android is explained from the beginning. David (Fassbender) is accepted for what he is without anything being hidden. The one thing that does remain consistent is that the android knows more than he admits. Where did he get that information?<br /><br />There is more than one alien species present in Prometheus, plus the humans. The story explains the origin of the type of ship discovered in Alien and we experience a small thrill of recognition. Ridley Scott balances new information with previous events in an effective way. I came away feeling like I knew a lot more about this universe, but I didn't feel that the original film had been betrayed in any way.<br /><br />It took me several viewings over a number of years to raise my rating for Alien to 4.5/5. Perhaps because I know that film so well, Prometheus had more of an immediate impact. However, there is one thing preventing me from rating the film as highly. The character of Fifield (Sean Harris) is a blatant flaw in the film. He's a British geologist with the personality of an idiotic criminal. He's clearly intended to provide comic relief, and I admit that the audience did laugh at his comments during both viewings, but his inclusion felt so out of place. Up until that point, the film had me fully engaged. The story seemed plausible and interesting. Fifield would never have passed any serious attempt at psychological screening by the Weyland Corporation and would never have become part of the crew in any realistic scenario. His inclusion pulled me right out of the movie as soon as he spoke his opening dialogue. His scenes with Millburn (Rafe Spall) were all ludicrous and I'm forced to deduct half a point just because of their presence.<br /><br />Everything else worked.<br /><br />I'm not against the idea of humor in a serious movie. Vickers (Theron) and Janek (Idris Elba) did have an amusing exchange which was handled in a far more intelligent manner. Theron played her part well and her icy personality was believable.<br /><br />The highlight of the film for me was the unexpectedly wonderful performance from Noomi Rapace. I liked her portrayal of Lisbeth Salander in the original Dragon Tattoo trilogy and was pleasantly surprised to see her tackling a role in English. Like Alien, the movie ends with a fight for survival, and Shaw (Rapace) is the equivalent of Ripley. There's one sequence which made me laugh because it was so outlandish, but Rapace played it totally straight and still had me on the edge of my seat and rooting for her. This will upset some people, but I think she was a more effective character than Sigourney Weaver's Ripley. I like both tremendously, so I guess it doesn't matter.<br /><br />Prometheus delivers in terms of story, action, and special effects, and most of the acting is good. The conclusion left the possibility of a sequel and I wouldn't be sorry to see that happen. It's always tricky when a franchise is continued after a long absence, but Scott really pulled it off. See it in IMAX/3D while you can and buy the Blu-ray when it is eventually released.</p></br><a href="../users/AQZH7YTWQPOBE.html">AQZH7YTWQPOBE</a><br/><p>Many have described Prometheus as Ridley Scott's attempt to take Alien to the level of Kubrick's Space Odyssey: 2001, and I think that's broadly a good assessment. However, while I found the film enjoyable, it never quite reaches the heights of either of its spiritual predecessors.<br /><br />MINOR SPOILERS BELOW<br /><br />When I first heard about the concept of aliens creating men, I was worried. However, it's important not to take the science in the film too seriously. Even Ridley Scott says this isn't a science class. It is kind of silly that these large humanoid aliens called the "Engineers" (or Space Jockeys for fans of the original Alien) created humans. The film even points out the ridiculousness of the concept when the biologist jokes it would throw out "300 years of Darwinism." In watching the movie, it becomes clear pretty quickly that the plot is a device to answer philosophical questions about the nature of God, creation, and death. The atmosphere and story during the first half of the movie is great.<br /><br />The acting is also surprisingly good. Other reviewers have gone on about how good the big three - Michael Fassbender, Noomi Rapace, and Charlize Theron - are, so all I'll say is that I really enjoyed their performances. Fassbender's performance as the android is stunning in how calmly chilling he is. Some of his lines were so cruel, yet so innocently recited, that I want to rematch the movie just to see him. Most of the other characters I thought were fine, with some exceptions (particularly Noomi Rapace's character's husband who came off as a lame Ashton Kutcher wannabe).<br /><br />The problem with the movie is that its exploration of these themes and acting are hampered by action/horror scenes that clearly weren't well thought out. As other reviewers noted, many of the deaths are caused by characters making stupid decisions. Many reviewers have criticized the crew for taking off their helmets, which at first is fine because one would expect that alien microbes would not be able to infect humans. However, once it was apparent that the Space Jockey DNA was the same as humans AND that one of the crew members was infected, they still continue to take their helmets off! Other stupid decisions include the biologist's attempt to pet a snake; the captain's decision to open the ship's door when a crew member's signal is detected without receiving audio confirmation from him; and the fact that the characters can only run straight to avoid a rolling ship. Overall, the action scenes seem like they were a symptom of today's brain dead Hollywood.<br /><br />For me, the biggest drawback to the movie was pacing. The beginning was slow, which was fine by me. However, when the action starts, it never really slows down. The audience isn't given time to breathe and absorb. The tension never really builds. For example, after Noomi Rapace's infamous scene, she runs down the hallways and has a conversation with the crew, and then they go try to communicate with the Space Jockeys. First of all, the fact that Rapace's character doesn't even inform the other crew members about what happened to her is ridiculous. But then the movie switches gears so quickly that it's like it never happened. Rapace's character is clearly hurting from the encounter, but not as much as she probably would in real life.<br /><br />Another major problem is that the film leaves a lot of questions unanswered. I'm not an Alien fanboy - I don't need to know every detail about the Space Jockey's origins. However, major plot points that are (deliberately) left open, setting it up for a sequel. I like some mystery, but for most viewers the movie will seem incomplete or ridiculous. For example, as many other reviewers have noted, it seems pretty stupid for one of the Space Jockey's, presumably an intelligent alien species, to simply start killing humans, arguably an intelligent species, when he wakes up after sleeping for 2,000 years. The film hints that there might be a reason why the Space Jockeys hate humans so much, but you'd think he would at least be confused at seeing humans or worried that they were able to travel so far. As it is the Space Jockey's actions look more like Hollywood's attempt to throw in some mindless violence. Maybe it'll all make sense after we see the inevitable sequel, but too much of it just doesn't seem to have been thought through very clearly.<br /><br />Overall, if you like sci-fi, especially the Alien franchise, Prometheus is well worth seeing. Don't set your expectations too high, and be willing to accept some thoughtless plot points. I'd give the movie 3 stars. If Ridley Scott and his scriptwriters had put a bit more thought into the plot, it could have been so much more.<br /><br />UPDATE on Blu-Ray (10/15/12):<br /><br />My initial review was a bit harsh, but upon rewatching the movie I think it was eminently justified. While there are some interesting philosophical concepts, they're buried deep beneath stupid characters and poor scriptwriting. The contrast with Scott's Alien, which I also recently rewatched, is telling. Alien never pulled me out of the movie and the characters seemed utterly believable. It's just a shame Prometheus didn't quite work on that level.<br /><br />The blu-ray set comes with all the standard deleted scenes, making-of documentaries, and commentaries. The deleted scenes are definitely the highlight. As happens so often, I wonder why they were deleted. The deleted version of the Fiefield fight uses a much more interesting Fiefield monster concept than the ugly guy we saw in the film. Also, Vickers has a few compelling character moments in the deleted scenes. Even the Engineer has more character. The deleted scene gives him a very compelling reason for attacking the Promtheus crew, whereas in the finished film he seems like a mindless brute. In short, Prometheus would have been a much better movie with these scenes incorporated.<br /><br />The 4-disc set comes with even more impressive special features, particularly the 3-hour "The Furious Gods". This is the documentary that the ads claim will "answer" the questions left from the film's plot holes. While that goes a bit too far, "The Furious Gods" is rich in content. I enjoyed hearing about the making of the movie, from beginning to end. It is definitely revealing, both in good ways and bad, However, I really don't like the idea of "enhancement pods", which essentially require you to interrupt the documentary in order to watch shorter featurettes. I'd have preferred if the short featurettes were simply part of the feature documentary.</p></br><a href="../users/A5TZXWU8AALIC.html">A5TZXWU8AALIC</a><br/><p>I was really psyched about seeing PROMETHEUS and it was a big visual feast in an IMAX theatre with 3D glasses...but, afterward, thinking about the story...this movie was a wreck.<br /><br />There's a hilarious youtube video where one guy rants about all the things that don't add up in the film (and he's right).  I can't link it here, but it's really funny.  Some guy on a couch sitting next to another guy sitting mutely.<br /><br />Basically, scientists assemble cave drawings that point to an outer space connection to life on earth.  The aliens who probably started mankind, as well as life on earth, are called the Engineers and the scientists head into deep space to find them.  Good start.  Man searching for his origins.<br /><br />But then the story begins to fall apart.  And the scientists appear to be the dumbest people on this mission.  The usual corrupt elements who want to screw over the hapless humans on the mission to get alien specimens jump the gun for some reason and turn the crew into their little experiment...a long, long way from home...and threatening to cut off their way home...wait...WHAT'S GOING ON IN THIS MOVIE?  Knowing this film is somehow tenuously connected to ALIEN is like waiting for another better movie to barge into the movie you're watching.  And then it happens.  And you have no idea what's going on.<br /><br />But, hey, it looked awesome on the big screen in 3D.</p></br><a href="../users/A1V3TRGWOMA8LC.html">A1V3TRGWOMA8LC</a><br/><p>I saw the two original Alien movies when I was young enough that they would forge my lifelong love of movies. These films transcended the science fiction I was used to seeing and offered a grown-up, more cynical and dangerous version of Star Wars, Star Trek and the like. So I was one of the first in line to get tickets to Prometheus which I hoped would reboot the franchise and erase the memory of the later inferior Alien films.<br /><br />Overall, there are moments of supreme cinematic greatness combined with a few gaffs of bad science and plot logic but largely it's a fusion of some of Ridley Scott's most brilliant themes.<br /><br />*** Potential spoilers ahead ***<br /><br />First, the weaker parts: scientists discover a drawing of 5 dots in a cave in Scotland which they've seen in other caves throughout history - they take the massive leap of logic to presume that not only did these come from aliens as a map, but these same aliens were the creators of humans. These scientists use this flimsy thesis to convince a death-obsessed rich guy to funnel one trillion dollars into developing the technology to reach the dots.<br /><br />The really bad science doesn't end there. Once we reach the alien cave, they continue to make one bad decision after another despite some very scary things happening. This is where it lurches more into the teen horror flick genre where characters disband, poke around the dark and inevitably meet their Alien-oriented grisly endings.<br /><br />There are also some weaker moments of dialog that seem like a tack-on from test audience screenings not understanding what's happening: one has Shaw discussing her infertility with her partner in a conversational segway that's really off. Later, Charlize Theron reveals her true relationship with Weyland which is a little tired. I'm probably being a little harsh because I expect so much from this film.<br /><br />But on the plus side, this is an excellent movie in any regular context but also a welcome addition to the Alien universe. There is so much overlap from Alien and Aliens that there is a sense of having seen much of it all before but large parts of the idea do stand on their own. There are some truly great horror moments that are simultaneously gripping, revolting, disturbing and original, and it's these handful of scenes that stand out after watching the whole thing.<br /><br />The visuals have never been better, featuring an alien landscape that's seductive, fluid and organic, supported by the invisible use of first class CGI - and it looks even better in 3D. Whereas Alien pulled back from the full sexuality of H R Giger's designs, this film doesn't pull punches in the creature designs and attacks of the face-huggers. The design of the engineers, the creative use of holograms and look of the ship are all extremely well conceived.<br /><br />This is also an exceptional cast. Noomi Rapace reminded me of how great Sigourney Weaver was and delivers ferociously in this role. Similarly Michael Fassbender crafts a delicate performance as the ship's android, treading the line between its appreciation of the beauty of life's designs and the psychotic nature of something that can think but not feel. His character is essential in connecting the themes of death being a part of life and the desire to meet and sometimes destroy your creator.<br /><br />This is all wrapped in a very, very complicated backstory about how the engineers spread life around the universe like space-travelling gardeners. There are mythical connections to Prometheus (wiki it to see) and some not-too-subtle religious parallels (Shaw is a barren woman made pregnant by God?). There are strong themes of selfishness and self sacrifice, natural death and immortality, and many many references to other science fiction works.<br /><br />It's worthy of five stars since it's a league ahead of anything else I've seen this year and it's good to see Ridley Scott at the top of his game.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJIJKKN15KR9.html">A1TJIJKKN15KR9</a><br/><p>Ridley Scott's legendary attention to detail is on full display here, although I couldn't help but wish for a more complete, uninhibited storyline to go along with it. For all his promises that this wouldn't just be a direct prequel to Alien, the director sure seems to stretch this concept to bring the two films together, rarely to the benefit of either. That's a pity, because while the core questions that Prometheus has to ask are worthwhile if not unique, its constant urge to poke and prod several of Alien's richest, most eccentric mysteries keep it tethered to the ground floor. A more compassionate cast may have smoothed over some of those rough spots, but this tight squad of explorers is thoroughly cold and conniving, naive and unlikable at their best. I wanted to adore this, and for the whole of the concept-heavy first act I did, but by the onset of the final standoff I'd been bucked like a fledgling cowboy. Fantastic, breathtaking special effects, stirring atmosphere and an astounding vision of near-future tech can only go so far.</p></br><a href="../users/A1XT8AJB7S9JJG.html">A1XT8AJB7S9JJG</a><br/><p>"You don't understand, this place isn't what we thought it was. I was<br />wrong. We were so wrong. We must leave!" When scientists Elizabeth<br />(Rapace) and Charlie (Marshall-Green) discover a pictogram that matches<br />many others found around the world they think they finally have enough<br />evidence of life from other worlds. They along with many others board a<br />ship called "Prometheus" to venture many light years away from Earth to<br />test their theory. What they find is beyond what they were ready for,<br />and more then they can handle. I have never really been a big fan of<br />the "Alien" movies but this one looked really good to me. I have to say<br />this was much better then I was expecting. The beginning was<br />interesting and once it got going it was a very tense and a sometimes<br />scary experience. I have to admit that I was totally sucked in to the<br />movie and it made me want to re-watch the other "Alien" movies to see<br />if this one gave me new found excitement for them. I recommend this to<br />all sci-fi fans and for those that loved the original movies this is a<br />must see. Overall, an extremely entertaining adventure that is well<br />worth your time. The last scene gave me a chill. I loved it. The only<br />complaint I have is that Charlize Theron's character seemed a little<br />unnecessary. This like so many other prequels though fall in to the strange aspect of the technology of movies makes it seem like they had cooler stuff in the beginning of the sagas then in the originals which is set in the future. I give it an A.</p></br><a href="../users/A1Y0HX12MCT6OR.html">A1Y0HX12MCT6OR</a><br/><p>Prometheus came out with high, high expectations, so it's no biggie that it didn't live up to that hype. No, there were many different problems, but the biggest one I had with it was that it awkwardly shifted between horror and sci-fi, and doing neither effectively.<br /><br />Actually the horror aspect wasn't so bad, I got truly scared when I first saw one of the scientists had a pink mowhawk and tattoos. I was really scared for how the movie would turn out. So a crew is sent on a trillion dollar mission to search for life on a distant planet, judging by the sheer enormity of the mission you'd think they'd send only the best and brightest right? Well no, not at all. Almost every crew member makes completely baffling stupid decisions throughout the movie, and the ones that don't make stupid decisions are completely underutilized.<br /><br />Once they arrive on the planet, they drive down one little valley to the 'tomb' or whatever is located, so that's all you see of the planet, that little valley and the one tomb, ok whatever. So they get into the 'tomb' and one of them decides to pull off his helmet because the air is breatheable. Ok? So what if it's breatheable, what about alien viruses, toxins, bacteria, aren't you guys supposed to be really smar-oh great now they're all removing their helmets. So Ridley Scott made this movie to appeal to mouth-breathing neanderthals, ok whatever maybe it'll be a good horror movie.<br /><br />So the Punk Scientist (I can't believe what I'm typing) and his ambigiously gay friend go split off from everyone in true bad horror movie writing, and can't find their way out for plot convience. Eventually they get trapped inside the tomb because of a storm and the ship is monitering them. Well only one guys is monitering these two idiots stranded on a planet and all he says to them is 'sleep tight' then laughs at his gay joke. Don't worry it gets dumber. Charlize Thereon, who's made out to be this cold calculating badass captain decides to sleep with the only guy watching the two stranded crew guys, and I think it was at this point where I started chucking candy at the screen. This was directed by the same guy that did Alien, Black Hawk Down, and Gladiator?<br /><br />So the two scientists are scared s***less about the crew finding other signs of life in the tomb, but when some snake-like creature comes out of the water they're next to, what do they do? Well the choice is obvious, stick your arm out and try to pet it. Then goofus and gallant get picked off in admittably creepy ways while the whole crew on Prometheus is busy f***ing each other. Later in another scene the captain realizes that one of the crewmembers is contaminated and can't come back on the ship, however later when one of the idiots who's been missing for like a day comes back the crew just opens up the hatch without checking him out first, not realizing that the guy is now some angry giant mutant straight outta the Hills Have Eyes.<br /><br />So it seems like this is going to go for to pure adrenline-rushing horror, but instead Prometheus takes a left turn and brings Guy Pearce in a cheap old man costume out for no reason other than to throw in a tweest, and none of the crew members seem to care, I sure as hell didn't. The rest of the movie turns into some stupid social commentary, such as "they ain't stupid 'nuff to build weapons of mass destruction on their front doorstep" or "what did we do to deserve to die"? Great, now this movie thinks it's smart.<br /><br />So Prometheus could've been a solid albeit dumb horror movie, but instead it tries to expand upon it's vague half-baked typical self-loathing hollywood message that humans don't deserve to live. Then Ridley Scott shoves his 'working class good, corporations bad' message AGAIN. We see the white collar members are up to no good, scheming behind everyone's back while the cool down to earth blue collar guys are the good guys. The crew don't even get picked off in a tense cool way of getting hunted or anything, they ram their ship into another ship, dying in the lamest way possible. See kids, Prometheus is too smart to be fun.<br /><br />So later the crew with Old Guy pearce meet up with the engineer who was sleeping and when they wake him up, does he want to communicate with the beings that he supposedly created? Does he want to assess the situation to know there's a giant ship outside ready to ram his if he tries to escape? Nope, he goes on a gorilla rampage beating everyone then jumps into his ship. Then after the multi-cultural blue collar folks ram into his ship the two leading ladies are being chased by the donut-shaped ship rolling along, only one of them realizing that you should move out of the direction that it's rolling in.<br /><br />Prometheus is a flat out disappointment. Nice set designs and atmosphere don't erase poor script-writing and a geniuenly lame story, Prometheus is made for idiots who want to pretend that they're smart.</p></br><a href="../users/APOGXH3A74CM3.html">APOGXH3A74CM3</a><br/><p>This film is a visual beauty, it really is, but that beauty is only skin deep when it comes to the story.  The plot has too many holes and gaps for the viewer to fill in.  There's no clear motivation for the actions of the characters, stretching the story way beyond any credible suspension of disbelief.<br /><br />The film glosses over the philosophical questions it started off trying to answer, coming off as more of an existential mess.<br /><br />I'm a huge fan of Ridley Scott, he's truly brilliant, so maybe my expectations for this film were too high.  Some of the Alien franchise movies are true classics, but that sadly won't be the case with this film.<br /><br />Something went terrible wrong with the story.  I'm sure I'll see this film again, it really is a visual joy, but sadly not as good of a story is it could have, and should have been.</p></br><a href="../users/A35L2E8M7S59MQ.html">A35L2E8M7S59MQ</a><br/><p>Who created us?<br /><br />That is perhaps one of the greatest questions ever asked by mankind and is the driving idea at the center of Ridley Scott's new science-fiction adventure Prometheus, the first entry of a proposed trilogy from the celebrated British director who brought us ALIEN, and Blade Runner. This story detailing a possible origin of mankind follows journey of a research team traveling in a spaceship years away from home in search of their creators. Prometheus is a fantastic looking movie set in the same fictional universe as Ridley Scott's sci-fi/horror classic ALIEN (1979) and uses the mythology suggested by Dan O'Bannon's original script to fashion an entirely new sci-fi adventure.<br /><br />Prometheus is the name of a trillion dollar research vessel created by Weyland Industries. A science team along with an assorted group of professionals has been recruited to find a planet that has been depicted in numerous cave paintings back on earth. Dr Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace, Sweden's original Girl with the Dragon Tattoo [2009]) , and her lover Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshal Green) leads the science team under the critical, cold gaze of Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron). It takes over two years for the Prometheus to reach LV-223, during which the human crew is watched over by David 8 (Michael Fassbender), a highly advanced robotic organism programmed to simulate human life. Once they arrive on LV-223 they discover a structure left behind by the previous inhabitants. There Shaw and her science team searches for the key to mankind's creation, but instead finds a weapon with the potential of destroying all life on Earth.<br /><br />The break out character of the movie is Michael Fassbender as David 8. We meet David going about his daily routines while the rest of the crew is asleep in one of the best scenes the movie offers in ways of character development. David eats, watches over the crew, plays basketball by himself, learns new languages, and memorizes lines from his favorite movie, Lawrence of Arabia. Here's how I'd descrive this character: Imagine if HAL9000 from 2001: A Space Odyssey could take human form; if you could see him actually grappling and occasionally hinting at signs of having developed genuine emotions. That is David 8.<br /><br />As Elizabeth Shaw Noomi Rapace's first leading role in an English-language movie begins shaky, but by the end of the movie she's hit her stride, bringing Elizabeth Shaw to life. Her performance lacks the subtle nuance of her portrayal of Lisbeth Salander in the original Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, but it does pack a punch. By the end of the film she does firmly step into her action heroine shoes.<br /><br />A character I liked that not many people talk about as much is the Prometheus's Captain Janek, an underutilized character who had more potential than the movie allowed him. He starts off as an outsider to the worlds of Shaw, Vickers ,and the expedition, but by the end has completely devoted himself to it.<br /><br />Ridley Scott's stylish direction played a huge part in cementing ALIEN and Blade Runner as two of the movie world's science-fiction masterpieces and there is no doubt that Prometheus is a great looking movie. When Ridley Scott does science-fiction he knows how to make it look right, and that still holds true thirty years after Blade Runner. The full-scale sets are fantastic, there are plenty of great special effects. You shouldn't wait to see this movie on your home television: it needs to be seen on a big screen.<br /><br />That brings me to 3D. I saw this movie in IMAX 3D, and it is one of the best movies I've seen in 3D...That being said I still fail to see why on earth anyone cares about 3D. I've given Coraline, Avatar, TRON: Legacy, Hugo, and Prometheus a fair chance to dazzle me with this recent development in price raising- I mean exciting technology. These are some of the best movies to see 3D in, and yes they look good, but all of them I've also enjoyed just as much, if not better in 2D. If you really are obsessed with 3D then yes, knock yourself out, you're going to have a blast. But, if you're like me and still aren't sold on 3D this movie will not be an eye opener.<br /><br />The most important thing one needs to understand before sitting down for Ridley Scott's Prometheus: this is NOT an Alien movie. It takes place in the same universe as Alien, has visual elements of Alien, has locations and even the fledgling evolutionary stage of what will become the monsters of the 1979 classic, but alone Prometheus is not a straight-up ALIEN prequel. Prometheus is a standalone science-fiction adventure, and it is one that in my humble opinion works extraordinarily well. Ridley Scott announced he intends Prometheus to be the first part of a science-fiction trilogy set within the Alien universe. That means you should expect H.R. Giger's infamous monsters to be leaping around. This movie is about the creation of man, with the creation of what ultimately becomes the xenomorphs by the time the Nostromo arrives at LV-426 in the first Alien movie.<br /><br />Do not go into Prometheus expecting a direct ALIEN prequel.<br /><br />I feel I need to clarify that Prometheus is not an Alien movie because too many disappointed, annoyed, or downright angered reviewers are coming down hard on Prometheus for not filling the shows, or delivering the same goods of Ridley Scott's 1979 classic. To go in expecting another Alien movie would be to set yourself up for disappointment. This is Prometheus, part 1 of a new science fiction trilogy. It is not Ridley Scott's ALIEN 2 Electric Boogaloo.<br /><br />At times Prometheus is a bit in over its head with the scope of its ambition, but at the same time I love this idea of searching for a possible extra-terrestrial root to man's DNA. Sure, the plot has been done several times in books, but only a few times in movies, and I honestly feel Prometheus has done a better job of it than does other films.<br /><br />Prometheus isn't ALIEN but it is a damn good first step for what could be a great new series. For what it's worth: I loved Prometheus. Even with its flaws.<br /><br />Here's to the hopes of a brilliant trilogy from Sir Ridley Scott!</p></br><a href="../users/A1JH5J1KQAUBMP.html">A1JH5J1KQAUBMP</a><br/><p>The crew of Prometheus travels to a distant planet in search of the Engineers, whom they believe are responsible for the creation of the human race.<br /><br />This is a tough film to award stars for.  I really wanted to like it and it delivers masterfully on a visual level.  There are also some very good individual scenes.  Unfortunately, the screenplay is pretty much a mess.  It's hard to imagine that such an unprofessional, irrational group of characters would be selected for such an important mission.  Exhibit A: the team members who decide to bail in the middle of a trip to an alien relic because they decide it's too scary but also think it's a good idea to try to pet a weird-looking alien.  The film also raises a lot of unanswered questions about the Engineers and their motivations.  I enjoy it when a well-written film declines to answer all the questions it raises, but this script has so many inconsistencies that any planned ambiguities get lost in the general sloppiness.<br /><br />Nevertheless, since I can't award half-stars, I'm going with four instead of three.  I was consistently entertained by the effects and performances, there are some great set pieces (such as a brutal dust storm), and I can't deny a certain thrill at the iconic sight of (SPOILER AHEAD!) an Engineer transforming into the Space Jockey from "Alien" as he seats himself at the controls of his ship.  I will be there for the sequel.  I want to see what becomes of Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and David (Michael Fassbender).  I will be really wanting to like it and really hoping not to be disappointed again.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LGT6UZL99IW1.html">A3LGT6UZL99IW1</a><br/><p>The movie has been reviewed to death. Nothing much I can add there - except that some parts will really make you squirm!  The quality is flawless, the effects mind-blowing, the ancestral/nascent versions of the Face Huggers and Aliens is friggin great.<br /><br />So I'll review the product.  Movie: 5 stars. Digital extras, etc. - 0 stars. The digital download options are horrible. You can pick the new "Untraviolet" option - this requires that you join one of two streaming video services. It's 10 minutes of jumping through hoops, answering questions, entering the same code multiple times and verifying email accounts. You can't simply copy and play.<br /><br />The other option is using iTunes to copy the movie. What if I don't have iTunes or don't want to use iTunes?  So I went to my old computer that did have iTunes. It won't accept the code. It gives an error that the movie must be redeemed using the DVD. The DVD runs a program that simply opens iTunes and instructs you to manually enter the code. The end result - no digital copy on iTunes. After six tries it finally worked. The program was not loading iTunes correctly. Want to watch it on your Droid tablet? Forget it - unless you want to stream the Ultraviolet version. I don't want to waste my battery powering WiFi when I don't need it.  But I can't copy the digital version to my tablet. So much for watching it "anytime, anywhere."<br /><br />While that's going on, I decided to scan the QR code on the insert "to learn more."  Too bad it can't be scanned. Droid X phone, Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 tablet, iPhone4 and iPad2 - none of these could scan the QR code. I guess the designers never bothered to test it.<br /><br />So I figured I'd try the app. What an irritating, frustrating little program this is. It just screams "DELETE ME!" Slow, clunky, half the options just give an error that it has to be synced to the movie to work - and even then they don't.<br /><br />This disc was obviously designed to push Blu-Ray to it's limits. Interactivity, menus - you name it. The problem is that they pushed it too far, to the point that unless you have a top-end player, the entire system fails miserably. For example - In the main menu, I could not navigate to any option except "Play" unless I powered down the player, powered up again, and immediately selected a different menu option, such as "Extras". If I played the movie first, then went back, it locked.  As for the "Easter eggs" - forget it. Could not get one to work. Locked up or did nothing.<br /><br />The deleted scenes - not too many. A couple were interesting, and you could tell that they could have played the characters a couple of different ways.  "Alternate ending" - could not get it to work, and that's assuming I even found the correct menu option. Again, the power-cycling between options was frustrating.<br /><br />So if you want a great movie on a fantastic format - and don't care about the digital copies or app, then you'll be thrilled.  Expect anything else to work? Forget it.<br /><br />Final insult: I have three Blu-Ray players. All three have the most current firmware. The DVD will only play on one of them. Won't play in my Samsung or Sony, but it will play in my Sanyo. But it takes forever to load, and sounds like an old computer floppy disk on and off for a minute - The rattly sound when it loads data and the machine-gun staccato when it resets.<br /><br />One final comment. They used the cheapest possible case for this product. It offers almost no protection, and is way too flexible. The DVD cases were great - this is not much better than paper. As for printed extras - just the insert with the redeemable code.</p></br><a href="../users/A34D06JL7LC6MU.html">A34D06JL7LC6MU</a><br/><p>Prometheus marks Ridley Scott's first science-fiction film since Blade Runner 30 years ago and returns to the universe of his seminal, 1979 masterpiece <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00498VS1E">Alien</a>. The question over whether or not this is actually a prequel to Alien (as was originally intended) has been thoroughly exhausted at this point and ultimately irrelevant. You need not have seen any other film to appreciate, admire, and enjoy Scott's latest sci-fi venture. Prometheus takes place in the same universe and references Scott's earlier film, but it really does function as a stand-alone film. With a budget somewhere between $120 and $130 million, there is little to separate Prometheus from a typical summer blockbuster. What ultimately does separate it is Ridley Scott, a man gifted in making big films with big ideas. There is enough action and visual effects to please the average moviegoer, but Prometheus is backed by an intelligent script that asks a lot of questions, answers few of them, and gives us something to ponder instead of just mindlessly blowing things up. Take that, Michael Bay.<br /><br />The hypnotic opening sequence (shot in Iceland) shows a humanoid alien standing above a waterfall, drinking a mysterious liquid that induces vomiting and rapid decay. This scene is ambiguous in that it gives us no information about where he is, what he is, and or what the implications of this moment are. It intrigues us for a moment, before the film jump cuts to the year 2089. Here, archaeologist Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) has discovered a star map among wall paintings from several unrelated cultures that she views as an invitation from the Engineers that may have created human life. Funded by Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce), the elderly CEO of Weyland Corporation, Shaw and a crew embark on a voyage to the distant moon LV-223 aboard the vessel Prometheus. Travelling in stasis and monitored by the android David (Michael Fassbender), they arrive in 2093 and embark on their mission to find their creators.<br /><br />Despite taking place in the same universe as Alien, the world created by the extravagant sets in Prometheus evoke a world all its own. The sets are intricately designed, large-scale creations; early contenders for the best set design Academy Award next year. Scott masterfully blends large sets, special effects, and good location scouting to create an atmospheric new world. If Prometheus offered nothing else by way of quality, it's an amazing film to look at.<br /><br />It recalls Alien most noticeably in that both have a strong female protagonist and both emphasize patient, slow-burning suspense, atmosphere, and an intelligent script that equally balances a complex narrative with beautifully integrated special effects. Prometheus does not jump directly in to the action. You'll be intrigued before you'll be amazed. In a genre that frequently allows acting prowess to take a backseat to hyperkinetic imagery, you'll find some fine performances here too.<br /><br />Fassbender, always the fascinating actor, wonderfully captures the ambiguous emotions of his android character. His performance is sophisticated, robotic, and yet layered with depth. It's as if HAL-9000 had assumed the look of T.S. Lawrence and was allowed to freely wander the ship. It's a performance that hurtles him ever-closer to the A-list. Rapace makes a strong, sensitive substitute for Sigourney Weaver and Charlize Theron sternly embodies a character that metaphorically holds the entire narrative subtext together.<br /><br />Prometheus is imperfect, but these flaws are few and far between. Sure, fanboys may find fault with how it works chronologically with Alien (despite the fact that it's not a prequel officially), but my issues come from two much different aspects. One is Guy Pearce's makeup. When compared to the seamless visual effects, his makeup seems unconvincing and overdone. Granted, I didn't initially recognize Pearce, but I also didn't believe that Peter Weyland was an elderly man. Another issue comes from something I've already praised; the script. As intelligent and thought-provoking as it is, it doesn't offer anything new by way of story structure. It follows the template seen in Alien and more recently in Sunshine (as well as, I assume, several movies in-between). It just follows too many cues that the seasoned moviegoer will recognize right away (establish reason for mission, upon arrival there's a change in the mission, the characters begin exploring, ominous things happen, characters get scared and die unbeknownst to the others, etc.). Sure, writers Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindelof have fashioned something spectacular, but it wouldn't hurt to break from the template and create something wholly new.<br /><br />Minor issues aside, it's terrific summer entertainment and a roaring return for Ridley Scott to the genre in which he made his name. Prometheus is a terrific film and one of the better high-minded science-fiction films to emerge from Hollywood in several years. It has suspense, horror, intelligence, drama, and depth typically eschewed in favor of a special effects extravaganza during Hollywood blockbuster season.</p></br><a href="../users/A2D8CUJPOSRPNA.html">A2D8CUJPOSRPNA</a><br/><p>The 1979 film ALIEN took the modern-day lead in alien invasion and/or possession movies with some fairly gruesome special effects (remember the alien bursting through John Hurt's chest?), and making it so that any film of this sort more or less has had to utilize those same methods from that point on, with the most noticeable example being John Carpenter's 1982 opus THE THING.  And now, in a new century, thirty-three years after that huge box office achievement, ALIEN (and BLADE RUNNER) director Ridley Scott has returned to this theme with PROMETHEUS.<br /><br />Named for the Greek god who stole and gave the gift of fire and was cast out from Mount Olympus, the spaceship "Prometheus" and her crew are venturing through the galaxy to find the origins of the strange lights in the sky that ancient Earth civilizations, including the Egyptians and the Mayans, reputedly saw some thirty-five thousand years before--an idea floated around by theologian Erich von Daniken.  When they arrive on a planet hundreds of billions of miles from Earth, they find evidence of this in a huge hollow mountain on the surface.  Unfortunately, what they also find is that this alien presence is extremely hostile; and one by one, they die very horrible deaths.  In between, they come to realize that these aliens are actually intent on hitching a ride on "Prometheus" and coming to Earth in order to either destroy or possess every living human being there.  In doing so, they have to sacrifice themselves, often in the most horrible ways; and in the end, one of the female crew members (Noomi Repace), who had initially been infected and impregnated by one of the alien beings, manages to escape the planet in one of the various spaceships left over from the alien race.  But there's something she doesn't know yet....<br /><br />Although he had done some impressive work following BLADE RUNNER, including GLADIATOR, BLACK HAWK DOWN, BLACK RAIN, and 1492: CONQUEST OF PARADISE, Scott had been basically been overshadowed by his younger brother Tony, who co-produced PROMETHEUS with him, David Giler, and Walter Hill (the last two the original co-producers of ALIEN), and had upped the hyper-directional stakes with 2004's MAN ON FIRE and the 2009 reworking of 1974's THE TAKING OF PELHAM ONE-TWO-THREE.  In essence, Ridley was going back to the basic premise of ALIEN, so much to the point that it could be argued that basically PROMETHEUS itself is a basic reworking of ALIEN, with a "Chariots Of The Gods" plot thrown in, and some up-to-date and extremely graphic alien special effects.  The crew of "Prometheus" here is far less well known than the cast that comprised the crew of "Nostromo" in ALIEN; only Charlize Theron, who had won an Oscar in 2003 for portraying a serial killer in MONSTER, and Guy Pearce, who was in the 1997 film noir hit L.A. CONFIDENTIAL, have any real "name value." As a result, whatever success PROMETHEUS can claim, though it is substantial, must rest on how well the entire cast, the gruesome plot, and Scott's direction hold up under very close scrutiny.  In general, Scott is a fairly classical director, relying more on what he learned from masters like Stanley Kubrick and Orson Welles than his younger brother, who has taken the MTV "splinters to the brain" style of direction to new highs and lows, this in spite of the many special visual effects, and the many ultra-gory make-up effects sequences as well.<br /><br />Given how many dozens of alien invasion movies there have been since he made ALIEN, one wouldn't understand what more Scott could do to make PROMETHEUS really stand out.  And in truth, he really doesn't.  But the one thing he does different from most alien invasion films is that he is given a good plot outline from Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindelof (based on unused elements from the original Dan O'Bannon/Ronald Shusett script for ALIEN), a good cast, and credible production values, the kind that somehow seem to fly out the window in most blockbuster films because of the need to concentrate on spectacle.  Therefore, despite some imperfections and a lot of gruesomeness, PROMETHEUS succeeds better than most others of its kind today.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HVL790PBWYTU.html">A2HVL790PBWYTU</a><br/><p>PROMETHEUS may be a prequel to ALIEN, but fixating too much on making those connections will probably sabotage your overall enjoyment of the film. After more than three decades Ridley Scott returns to the franchise that established a new watershed mark for sci-fi horror. That's plenty of time to stew things over for a sequel. But while PROMETHEUS does address a few questions, it frustratingly raises even more. Case in point, the mystery of the Space Jockey figure. Still, I appreciate that the narrative doesn't spoonfeed you the answers.<br /><br />In 2093 the deep space vessel Prometheus, spurred by a clue 35,000 years old, journeys to a distant and inhospitable moon in search of mankind's origins. Prometheus is manned by a crew of seventeen, many of them anonymous cannon fodder. On the barren moon a scouting team eyes a vast, unnatural construct and explores it. Inside they find air that is breathable... and the remains of an ancient alien civilization.<br /><br />Prepare to be gobsmacked by the eloquence and scope of Ridley's storytelling. The set designs are magnificently realized and, gratifyingly, still very much influenced by H.R. Giger's ominous surrealism. For those who may get their Scotts and Camerons confused, PROMETHEUS is more reminiscent of ALIEN in its slow burn evocation of atmosphere and tone. The tone itself is contemplative. There's an exploration into the metaphysical stuff, into the relationship between science and religion. The story takes its time but builds to a blistering crescendo. The spooky bits are parceled out in measured doses; Scott once more prefers to let your imagination do the work. Honestly, the film is heavy on mood but light on terror. It does eventually unleash several nice scares, and ****REST-OF-SENTENCE SPOILER NOW**** particularly one harrowing moment involving a cringe-inducing bout of self-surgery.<br /><br />Next to THE AVENGERS and THE DARK KNIGHT RISES, PROMETHEUS is this summer's most anticipated film. Which leaves it vulnerable for a letdown, expectations being so high. Those going in the theater salivating for a comprehensive backstory will probably exit grumbling. There is a connective tissue, but Ridley Scott doesn't confine himself to the ALIEN mythos and with crossing t's and dotting i's. He expands on it, paints a bigger canvas. He introduces even more concepts. He lays in the puzzle of the Space Jockeys, who we learn are genetic engineers who may have created humanity. We're left questioning their motivations with regards to the human race.<br /><br />The film gives us expert direction, staggering visual effects, marvelous acting. Noomi Rapace's archaeologist Elizabeth Shaw emerges as our point-of-view character. She starts out as this sort of sweet, unprepossesing scientist willing to be coddled by her more adventurous scientist partner. In time, when it all turns to sh--, we see her channel the strength and awesome kickassery of Sigourney Weaver (although Rapace doesn't quite match Weaver's thunder). A deliciously creepy Michael Fassbender plays David, the android whose motivations seem mercurial and ever suspect. The excellent Idris Elba, as the laid back ship's captain, provides a dash of levity and a much needed human touch. And stepping in the shady Paul Reiser "company man" role, Charlize Theron is so icy and impassive that debate immediately surfaces regarding her true nature. Is she or isn't she? What she is, is underused.<br /><br />I rate PROMETHEUS 3.5 out of 5 stars. The stuff I liked, I liked very much. But the flaws... aaaiiyeeee! Or is that perceived flaws? I'm a bit torn about something. I refer to Ridley Scott's measure of ambiguity and his reluctance to produce those big reveals, to provide an even more pronounced connective tissue to ALIEN. One thought is that he's holding out for a sequel, in which case I'm on board. There's something to be said for slow burn gratification. But other elements undermine the film. Bits of metaphysical exposition come off as heavyhanded. I hate that a sizable chunk of the narrative stems from the scientists' making so many poor choices. Personnel eschew proper protocol. They throw caution to the winds and discard their oxygen helmets. They abandon their observation posts for a quickie while other crewmen are stranded off the ship. They think menacing tentacles emerging from inky pools are cute and harmless. I won't even go into Guy Pearce's unconvincing old man make-up. These nitpicks wouldn't be as readily apparent were this film not a furtherance of the classic ALIEN mythology. You can probably brush them off on BATTLESHIP or the TRANSFORMERS sequels. But there's a level of intelligence attached to this franchise that is compromised here. So, to sum it up, PROMETHEUS is a dazzling, powerful visual feast and thought-provoking enough, and it does give you moments in which you make those instant connections. Its grand scope absolutely begs for a viewing in the movie theater (you can probably give the 3-D a pass). I wouldn't mind seeing the survivor(s) in a follow-up picture. I wish it were better.</p></br><a href="../users/A356RFKNIG043B.html">A356RFKNIG043B</a><br/><p>4.5 stars<br /><br />Prometheus sure ain't for everybody; it's too slow for horror fans, too horrific for art house fans, too anti-romantic and too weird for many in general. But I've been loving Scott's work since going to Alien as a kid in 1979 and for me this is perhaps the perfect summation of many of his themes and the consummation of many of his incredible visual signatures.<br /><br />The opening of Prometheus is just mind-blowingly stunning, Lord Of The Rings epic but with its own special otherworldly feel. The Iceland landscapes are stunning, and as at various points during the film my jaw literally dropped in true amazement at both the perfection of the framing and the insane depth and color of the blu-ray image. This has got to be the best BD transfer I've ever seen except perhaps Baraka and Up.<br /><br />Add to that the sort of attention to quality and detail that all good movies deserve on BD, and you've got a disc that's well worth the 20 clams they want here. The dvd is only a sad reminder of how awesome 50gb of BD space can be when used for an image this crisp and a soundtrack this wide and how 7.4 gigs just can't ever compare.<br /><br />How much time did they spend making this blu-ray good? Well, the movie audio has 28 different subtitle tracks. 28! Including two commentaries in various languages. Even the well-laid out deleted scenes have 18 subtitle tracks. Normally it's a miracle to get one. The Weyland film they made just as an extra is another excellent addition with lots of good ideas the film couldn't assimilate.<br /><br />But caring about every detail like that is Scott's hallmark, and his exemplary commentary is typically sharp and incisive, with many drily humorous thoughts on the film making process and some great jabs at the moneymen who still don't let him do what he wants, despite a career as fine as almost any modern director's.<br /><br />The deleted scenes extra shows how wisely ruthless Scott can be as an editor; many fine things were dumped but in hindsight you can see why he cut each one, as good as some were. He wants to preserve the mystery and weirdness that comes with leaving out some details, and he gets so much intense atmosphere so often that he makes most directors seem like they're still in film school.<br /><br />Whereas the details he leaves in, with many references to his own masterpieces Blade Runner and Alien and also 2001 and other sci-fi landmarks, all work together to highlight the truly interesting central conceit here: the earth as petri dish for people. If you've read much Sitchin you know this idea is rich with possibility and perhaps even probability. Scott plows into it with verve, and the effects and cgi folks do him proud.<br /><br />There are some cgi scenes here that redefine the art, especially the alien ship cosmos map scene. Wow. Watch that in slo-mo on a good LCD screen and be awestruck. I really wish I'd seen this in an Ima. Sigh.<br /><br />But movies do not live on images alone, and the performance that really carries the drama is from Fassbender, who takes Rutger Hauer's emotional ice from Blade Runner and warms it up to vapor, saying volumes as the perfectly sly cyborg with wry glances and deft details of movement.<br /><br />Rapace and Elba certainly have their moments, and no one is weak, but it's the visual splendors that are the real star of this film.<br /><br />All that said, this is not for everyone. It's too harsh and too slow if you're not totally into the tale, and I could see where it could drag. But if you love sci-fi, the art of film and an epic film maker with a truly unleashed imagination, Prometheus is a delight that will only get better as time goes by.<br /><br />It also highlights various parallels between Scott and James Cameron in both epic scope and idea (each also chose Sigourney Weaver as his favorite hero archetype---the indomitable professional woman), but Ridley is more about the mind game while Cameron goes for the heart. This makes his films much more successful, but I think as time goes by Scott's vision is emerging as one of the finest of all living filmmakers. Who else has done a film like this and also (the sadly neglected but wonderfully sharp) Matchstick Men? Now that's breadth.<br /><br />I've always dreamed of a sequel to Blade Runner, and I guess this is as close as we'll get. And while it lacks BR's once-in-a-lifetime feel, it has a visual sophistication that not only makes BR seem primitive but redefines how wild a movie can look while still seeming real. My eyes are still reeling.<br /><br />The main qualm I have is the music, which is always big but never deeply memorable like Vangelis' incomparable Blade Runner OST. It's the Giger-esque imagery that haunts the brain most here, and Scott's various tributes and nods to his filmic past make Prometheus a many-layered visual and mental splendor for cinephiles with patience, open minds and hungry eyes.</p></br><a href="../users/AHIK7BUXFRMT8.html">AHIK7BUXFRMT8</a><br/><p>I am a fan of the Alien universe series and knew I would have to watch and would probably wind up buying this one too. Well I saw it on opening day and found it to be a worthy addition to the franchise so I've pre-ordered the 3-D version and look forward to getting it when it becomes available. There are a number of unanswered questions the film leaves the viewer wondering about and I hope that I find some clues on my second viewing when the disc comes in.<br /><br />The movie itself is about a discovery which promises to reveal important information about the origins of man. An expedition is sent across space to try and uncover more truths about this discovery. What they find turns into a challenge for their survival as very unfriendly forces are unleashed which must be defeated or the crew from earth will all suffer death.<br /><br />The movie ends just as the story takes a new direction which is setting up the audience for a sequel. Should that one get made I'll probably get it too for my "Alien" collection. Although this story takes place in the familiar alien universe it is pre-Ripley and not directly related to the older movie, "Alien." The story line is similar in that a strong female personality survives adversity and an aberrant android with a hidden agenda complicates life for all of his unsuspecting shipmates.<br /><br />The movie was actually less violent than the previews of coming movies that were shown before "Prometheus" started. This is one of those sci-fi action flicks that are reasonably cerebral with sufficiently toned down violence to avoid running off the non-fan of the franchise.<br /><br />We found the movie satisfying and entertaining and I look forward to seeing it again. I recommend the movie for the fan of the franchise as well as general sci-fi action movies.</p></br><a href="../users/A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ.html">A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ</a><br/><p>Those who are familiar with the names Ridley Scott, H.R. Giger & "Alien" got a slow trickling of information about the movie release of "Prometheus". It's story, plot and origin were a complete mystery and should remain that way until you view it. The mystery surrounding the movie is as intense, mysterious and teasing as the trailer included with this review. In fact, the trailer is a fair depiction of what you will get with the film. You will get great science fiction, intense gut wrenching scenes and mysterious cave drawings that lead scientists to another world.<br /><br />Don't talk to many people who have already seen "Prometheus" before going. You don't want to know. If you enjoy great science fiction and you enjoyed the "Alien" series of movies, just go. "Prometheus" is beautiful and horrifying at the same time. It isn't for the squeamish. I will be ultra careful not to tell too much as well.<br /><br />Those familiar with the "Alien" series are also familiar with the name "Weyland Industries". They are the corporation behind the original "Alien" movies. They are the money and brains behind the operation to explore alien life forms. So when Elizabeth Shaw, played by Noomi Rapace (who rose to fame with the Swedish "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" movies), finds cave drawings all over earth that are similar, it leads her and her boyfriend Charlie Holloway to question our origins. Who are we and where did we come from?<br /><br />"Prometheus" is more thought provoking than action movie. Not to say that the action isn't plentiful, but the thought and development that went into the film are top notch, as well as the acting, direction and cinematography. There really isn't much to criticize about the film. "Prometheus" is pure and simple, great escapism cinema. You will be gone away for two hours to a place that will have you thinking, wondering and cringing.<br /><br />There have been a great variety of summer movies this year and Hollywood has finally learned a valuable lesson about moviegoers. We want variety. "Prometheus" is possibly one of the best science fiction movies of all time, emphasis on the science. It mixes the "Alien" genre with a great movie like "2001: A Space Odyssey". It does what every great movie should do, make you question and make you think. Go, before you hear anything more about it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>I'm a big fan of Alien and Aliens, thought Alien 3 was decent at best and really hated Resurrection, so with Ridley Scott taking us back to the start of the series, Prometheus was one of the top films I was looking forward to in 2012.<br /><br />The plot is mostly about the creation of life on Earth and where we came from. The events take place about 30 years before Ripley and her crew land on a neighboring planet, where they find the same huge alien species that suffered the same fate here. Yes it is confusing at times (hence the four star rating), but I did manage to have most of my questions answered on that one big movie site (ya know the one). It does tarnish the mystery element of the Space Jockey from the first film, but I didn't think it took away anything from the series either. Maybe it didn't reach my high expectations as a whole, but I couldn't take my eyes off the screen.<br /><br />The acting from Noomi Rapace (the new Ripley, or is it the old?) and Michael Fassbender (the new Ash/Bishop android) stole the show. Both were very convincing. Charlize Theron also added quite a bit as well.<br /><br />The IMAX 3-D visuals were clear and impressive. None of the CGI looked bad...well the last minute or so could have been less blurry. You'll know the iconic moment when you see it.<br /><br />I read that Ridley Scott said he will be releasing the Blu-ray with 20 extra minutes. Like Kingdom of Heaven, I think this will elevate the movie even farther than this shorter cut.<br /><br />Smart, beautiful, intense and full of questions to ponder over long after you have left the theater, Prometheus is one of the strongest Sci-Fi films I've seen in a long time.</p></br><a href="../users/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z.html">AEQFYOI6YJ83Z</a><br/><p>Let's get this straight: PROMETHEUS is a polarizing film for many reasons.  I personally have yet to truly make up my mind about it.  Do I think it's an epically-drawn sci-fi piece, or an ego-driven effort into heady ideas and special effects?  I can't tell you.  Probably because, truthfully, it's both.<br /><br />The plot begins simply enough: a pair of scientists discover ancient cave drawings that they feel point toward a distant planet.  This planet may or may not hold the secret to life on Earth.  The scientists gain funding, a crew, and a spaceship, and head toward said planet.  Bad things happen when they get there.  Very bad things.<br /><br />There's a lot of good to be said in PROMETHEUS's favor.  The acting is solid; mainstays Charlize Theron, Noomie Rapace, Guy Pearce, and Logan Marshall-Green deliver solid, if not altogether memorable, performances.  Idris Elba is a standout in his supporting role.  Undoubtedly the best thing to be said about the film, everything else aside, is Michael Fassbender's performance as the LAWRENCE OF ARABIA-loving android David.  Fassbender has Peter O'Toole down pat, quoting him left and right in a near-perfect imitation, while keeping his character ambiguous and vaguely threatening (think Lance Henriksen's Bishop, but British).  Fassbender possibly deserves an Oscar nom for this one...but then, he usually does.<br /><br />Other good things: cinematography, special effects, overall ideology.  This film was a labor of love, and it truly shows.  There are some shocking scenes; there are some funny scenes; there are some touching and haunting scenes.  Bad thing: these scenes don't necessarily congeal.  Or maybe they do.  It depends if you buy into the overall goal of the movie, the point that it either makes or doesn't make (depending on how close attention you pay to details and plot holes).  The script is decidedly lackluster; it's bland and cliched, especially in dialogue.  Where the film excels is ideas.  The question is whether those ideas are carried out effectively.<br /><br />MILD SPOILERS MAY FOLLOW (though I give nothing away that I didn't know going into the film; if you are overly cautious, skip to the final paragraph).<br /><br />Here's the thing: PROMETHEUS tries to do too much.  It's a sci-fi adventure film; it's a borderline-theology piece; it's needlessly a part of the ALIEN universe (as though director Ridley Scott forced his writers to add that in there); it's a commentary on the human desire to know everything, and the consequences that come with such knowledge.  It is all of these things separately; it is rarely all of these things together.  There are many great ideas buried at the core of PROMETHEUS; Scott and company mine deep enough to give us a glimpse of most of these, but rarely go far enough to fully dig them out of the ground.<br /><br />Ultimately, whether you enjoy PROMETHEUS is based on your ability to suspend disbelief, open your mind, and marvel in what is otherwise a solid B-movie with A-list special effects and talent behind it.  If you can't do that, don't fret--PROMETHEUS doesn't work hard to make you to believe.  Instead, it bombards you with ideas.  It's supposedly the first of three films, so hopefully the second entry will settle all of the unanswered questions, and perhaps explain many of the plot holes.  (Though again: shouldn't this film answer all of its own questions?)</p></br><a href="../users/A2BFIYZYNK54QX.html">A2BFIYZYNK54QX</a><br/><p>Ridley Scott, while making many other films during his almost 40-year career, is still most beloved for his work within the Sci-Fi genre with the original ALIEN and the neo-futuristic noir BLADE RUNNER. While I don't share most fans' love for ALIEN (I think it's a triumpth of design and style over substance), I do go gaga over the fascinatingly dark and deeply intelligent BLADE RUNNER. So I'm relatively sure that it will anger some people out there that in my opinion, Ridley Scott's return to the Sci-Fi genre after a 30-year absence in PROMETHEUS is a thematically superior film to ALIEN, but will never be a classic such as ALIEN was destined to become.<br /><br />I will never fault a film or its creators for thinking big, and that's definitely what's going on here. Written by master mindbender Damon Lindelof (the love him/hate him co-creator of LOST) and Jon Spaihts (writer of the high-concept flop THE DARKEST HOUR), we start with a bizarre, mood-setting prologue presumably millions of years ago, and then jump to the year 2089 where we have Doctors Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace of the original Swedish MILLENNIUM trilogy) and Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green, who looks like a stringier Tom Hardy and that character name HAS to be a easter-egg reference to LOST) discovering on Earth a pictographic pattern amongst great civilzations of the past separated by centuries and great distance. They believe it to be a star map and present this to the old, dying trillionaire Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce in convincing old-man makeup) and thus begins the adventure of discovering the origins of Earth's species in a two-year space flight in the massive ship dubbed "Prometheus" named for the Greek mythological figure who stole fire from the gods and gave it to humans. Upon arrival at their destination they pulled from this star map which is a moon for the planet LV-223, all of the crew members are awoken from their cryogenic sleep by David (Michael Fassbender), the resident synthetic (or "artifical person", if you will). The crew, led by company woman Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron) and the ship's captain Janek (Idris Elba), set down on a moon in this far-flung galaxy. Once there, they start exploring a pyramid-like structure and, in true sci-fi horror fashion, the greatest discovery in scientific history may very well mark the end of our history.<br /><br />The film has a number of problems once things really get underway. My first problems are matters of pet peeves rather than distinct criticisms: I do NOT like it when futuristic films put a specific year on them; just say "The Future", or put it so far in the future that this technology may seem charming and antiquated. Also, as in the STAR WARS prequels, it's not a terribly good idea to have technology be more advanced than what we see in the stories that are supposed to come AFTER this. Now comes my real criticisms: Certain members of the crew are such obvious "red shirts" that you know they will meet their fate before too long, however that works both ways as a major character meets their fate somewhat early on in the film which does up the ante for all of the crew. Some of the dialogue is clunky, and some character motivations are murky or just plain indecipherable. Noomi Rapace as Dr. Shaw is obviously meant to fit into the Ellen Ripley mold, which is especially apparent during the film's most visceral and suspenseful scene which involves a horrifying self-surgery, but she somehow doesn't quite fit. She's alternately too demure and then too aggressive. There is also a significant reveal that comes near the beginning of the third act that should have more impact than it does, but it just feels inorganic. Also the character of Vickers as being the "company woman" for Weyland Industries is designed for you to hate almost immediately; she's far too cold and self-serving. She plays the role very well, but when her character is given a spin that could make her more sympathetic, it doesn't go that way. Even Carter Burke had moments of genuine likability. The character of Janek, as played by Elba, is less of a character and more of a cliche, and it's a sad waste of such a talented actor (He's Stringer Bell, for god's sakes!). And Scott doesn't really have too many edge-of-your-seat moments that a film like this would need particularly in the film's climactic 'battle' which is more of a footnote rather than epic confrontation. Another big problem is that this has essentially already been designed as a franchise rather than a self-contained story. That may be a studio decision (knowing Fox, it probably was), but it still hurts the film more than helps it. And there is a death of another major character in this film that is done so ridiculously that it actually made me kind of angry.<br /><br />However, when the film does work, it REALLY works well. The scenes of initial discovery are incredibly absorbing and the production design work by Arthur Max (designer of every Ridley Scott film since G.I. JANE as well as David Fincher's SE7EN) is stunning to behold. The cinematography of Dariusz Wolski (DP of all of the PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN films, but my favorite work of his is Alex Proyas' underrated masterpiece DARK CITY) is crisp and moody, and the team at Weta Digital who did the effects work did some eye-popping work as well. The philosophical/theological themes and ideas are handled in an intelligent and thought-provoking fashion, and when the suspense is really unleashed, it's far more effective than the large-scale set pieces. The show is essentially stolen right out from everyone else by the brilliant work by Fassbender (who I believe to be one of the hardest working men in the business right now), who is charming and eerie in his childlike fascination, and seems so eager to please, despite his true motives. His moments, even when he's done something truly terrible, are still done with such a benevolence that you know that everything terrible he's doing is not his responsibility, and he does play to a certain regret as he seems to grow throughout the film. Marc Streitenfeld's (also all of Scott's films since AMERICAN GANGSTER) score is somewhat restrained, and that's unusual in a film like this, until the suspense racks up and we're flooded in sound and fury.<br /><br />While this doesn't directly link to the ALIEN franchise, it obviously went out of its way to make sure it was in the same universe, with the whole expedition being financed and overseen by Weyland Industries (which would later become Weyland-Yutani, the company that sent out The Nostromo), and finding these strange and aggressive species on LV-223. As I stated before, this film doesn't present a self-contained story lending itself very obviously to a sequel or entire new franchise for Fox to explore (and eventually exploit, because after all... it's Fox) and so, all the questions that are posed in this film are left relatively unexplored and whether or not we'll see more classical versions of face-huggers, chest-bursters or xenomorphs in future films is up in the air. There is something to work with there both on a thematic and visceral scale, but like the previous ALIEN franchise, it's unlikely that we'll see Ridley Scott returning.<br /><br />I certainly didn't love this film, because when it is good, it's really very good, and when it's bad, it's more innocuous rather than totally debilitating. But unless Fox decides to cede more (or less, depending upon whatever made the film less than stellar) control to the creative team of this film, I'm sure that any further adventures of the remaining crew members of PROMETHEUS might be similarly hamstrung.<br /><br />3.5/5 Stars</p></br><a href="../users/A3QLAOOTFEHCJI.html">A3QLAOOTFEHCJI</a><br/><p>If asked what my favorite "type" of movie is, I'm apt to respond science fiction.  Yet the genre is a relatively small percentage of my film collection.  The fact is that they are rarely done well.  Having said that, a few rank high on my favorites list.  Two were directed by Ridley Scott ("Alien" and "Blade Runner").  Scott's "Prometheus" will join that list.  It is no secret at this point, but this film is a prequel of sorts to "Alien."  Not that there is a direct linkage, but as Scott says there's common DNA.  Indeed human DNA is a source for this story.<br /><br />Numerous discovered cave art from across Earth have been analyzed to suggest a common cluster of stars and perhaps the origin of human life.  Two prominent scientists, who happened to also be romantically attached, are hired by Wayland Corp. (also from "Alien") to travel to a distant moon to investigate the possibility.  Wayland's representative on the trip is a stone-faced Meredith Vickers played by Charlize Theron, reenacting a similar sinister character from the recent "Snow White and the Huntsman."  As in all the "Alien" films the corporate representatives are never there to help.<br /><br />Other key characters include scientist Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green) a true evolutionist and God-fearing girlfriend scientist, Elizabeth Shaw played by Noomi Rapace ("The Girl Who Played With Fire") in another memorable performance.  The other performance to watch is the amazing Michael Fassbender ("Haywire") as the android called David.  In an early scene check out how David acquires his "personality."  He emulates blond Peter O'Toole from his favorite movie, "Lawrence of Arabia."<br /><br />Ridley Scott's return to the franchise allows him to follow-up on the neglected sequence when the "Space Jockey" is found in the original film.  Who was he?  What was he after?  How did he die?  Where did he come from?  Some questions are answered.  Some will have to wait for a probable sequel and before we get the direct connection to "Alien."  Scott, who always seems to direct films with strong female leads, makes no exception here.  Rapace's Dr. Shaw is no shrinking violet and takes the most courageous actions of the ship's crew, aided by Captain Janek (Idris Elba).  She even undergoes a self-directed but machine automated surgical procedure which will get you squirming in your seat.<br /><br />There are some ever engulfing scenes of the ship (Prometheus), the vastness of space and the confines of caves that are in a word, magnificent.  I saw this movie in 3-D and it looks great.  There are few, if any, in-your-face effects but the overall quality of the camera work is excellent.  The 3-D adds depth to many of the shots and doesn't darken the picture.  Ultimately, the film doesn't answer all the questions, but gives us enough to conjure plenty of ideas.  More please.<br /><br />BLU RAY UPDATE (10-11-12):  I wasn't surprised to find this Blu ray transfer to be near perfect.  Since I don't have 3-D at home yet I opted for the Blu ray/DVD/Digital copy version.  The video is in 1080p as you would expect and has a 2.40:1 aspect ratio nearly identical to the original theatrical release.  Lighting is a major factor in the film.  It is dark (takes place in space) so director Scott and his crew had to manage cameras and lighting to get the proper intensity.  The transfer looks beautiful. Stunning.  Gorgeous. Spectacular.  Detail is excellent.<br /><br />The audio is likewise perfect.  The prime track to sample is the DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1.  If you have a properly set up rig, this soundtrack will knock your socks off.  The subs and woofers will get a workout, but none of the small sounds are missed either.  The great orchestral score washes over the entire picture.  Optional audio includes Dolby Digital 5.1 tracks with Enlish descriptive, Spanish, and French.<br /><br />There are plenty of interesting special features as well.  Audio commentaries are provided by director/producer Ridley Scott and another by writer John Spaihts and writer/executive producer Damon Lindelof.  There are 14 deleted/extended/alternate scenes that total about 37 minutes.  Finally there is a segment called "The Peter Weyland Files." This consists of some video files reflecting some insider info on the fictious Weyland Corp.  Great movie and Blu ray package.</p></br><a href="../users/A28MM46KI4EQB2.html">A28MM46KI4EQB2</a><br/><p>When it comes to the Alien universe, the first 2 Alien movies will always be my favorites!  After that, I'd say I enjoyed Prometheus even a bit better than the 3rd & 4th Alien movies.  It was cool to finally witness how the xenomorphs inevitably came to be...and I must say that this movie was pretty intense, as it should be!<br /><br />I have never honestly read the book, so I don't pretend to know how close the movie actually comes to it in comparison, but I've never been a big reader anyway...there are books I do like and will read, but my taste in sci-fi literature is pretty limited.  However, I love sci-fi movies!<br /><br />All of the actors in this movie did a great job I felt.  I had only ever previously seen Noomi Rapace in Sherlock Holmes A Game of Shadows, in which I felt she did very good, so I had no doubt she'd be good in this movie.  Then there is, of course, the ever awesome Michael Fassbender...I have liked him as an actor ever since Centurion, though his best role in my opinion so far has been the younger Magneto in X-Men First Class.  There was also the always cool Idris Elba and Charlize Theron.<br /><br />What it boils down to if this...if you enjoy good sci-fi, especially if you're familiar with the Alien movies (which any sci-fi love probably is), then I highly recommend giving this movie a watch.  I for one will be adding this to my collection once it releases!</p></br><a href="../users/A1GB0HW46Y2EB.html">A1GB0HW46Y2EB</a><br/><p>The purpose of Ridley Scott's film "Prometheus" apparently is to explain the origin of what was found on the hostile planet by the group of space travelers in the beginning of the original film "Alien" (1979).  The conclusion of "Prometheus" may be rather ambiguous to those not have seen it and seems to be setting us up for yet another sequel.<br /><br />There are, as expected, amazing optical effects compared to the earlier "Alien" films, but I had difficulty in becoming emotionally involved with  the characters in "Prometheus" as I did not in "Alien" and especially in the later film "Aliens."  I have had the complete Alien collection for a couple of years now and  I still haven't gotten around to watching the third and fourth films in the series and possibly never will.<br /><br />I'm not sure why, but I am coming to regard "Bladerunner" as my favorite Ridley Scott sci-fi film.  In its odd way it perhaps creates characters and a universe you can believe.  The Blu-ray release of this film is especially impressive and greatly encourages repeat viewing.  While "Bladerunner" cannot boast of the technical sophistication of "Prometheus" there is an atmospheric aspect to "Bladerunner" that cannot be denied that "Prometheus" somehow lacks.</p></br><a href="../users/A4SY5RCGC5CH9.html">A4SY5RCGC5CH9</a><br/><p>This revised verdict contains SPOILERS:<br /><br />This High Court finds the accused guilty of:<br /><br />1) disappointing the expectations of large numbers of devoted fans and admirers<br />2) soiling his own legacy<br />3) dumping garbage in theatres around the world<br />4) insulting the intelligence of the viewers<br />5) wasting the talent of good actors<br />6) robbing defenceless Engineers of the totality of their "cool" factor<br />7) wagging his 3D in public, in a crowded area, without any valid reason<br />8) using office staples in medicine<br />9) causing waste of perfectly good popcorn in a world where hundreds of millions do not have enough to eat<br /><br />Justification: A LOT was expected from "Prometheus". It is however the finding of this Court that this film failed to meet the required standards to such a point, that it is at best an average SF film, many quality levels beneath "Alien" and in fact not even as good as "Alien3"... This Court finds particularly reprehensive the fact, that Sir Ridley Scott, one of the greatest directors alive, accepted a piss-poor scenario, which, unlike in his masterpieces ("Alien", "Blade Runner", "Blackhawk Down", etc.) doesn't make any sense. This Court rejects with extreme energy the argument of the defense, that the scenarist is responsible for this film fiasco. The director is the person really in charge of the film and therefore the responsibility is all his, for everything, including the scenario. Also, as the scenarist is currently hiding in his own butt and refuses to come out (understandable under the circumstances), his testimony couldn't be heard - and therefore the whole point is considered moot and irrelevant for the present proceedings.<br /><br />This Court finds particularly offensive to common sense that the whole idea of First Contact with intelligent aliens was wasted and played at the level of a B-class "direct to DVD" SF film. It can be resumed briefly - an intelligent entity, belonging to a race which could fly interstellar spaceships already at least tens of thousands years ago, wakes up and sees smaller creatures, clearly intelligent because they obviously made it out of their solar system. So what does it do? It doesn't even try to communicate, but just starts to rip them apart. This Court allows itself here the right to laugh its (---) off, but with much underlying sadness.<br /><br />As a mitigating circumstance, this Court finds that there is a possibility that this deplorable scene was caused by the android David messing up the communications. The android seems to have learned alien's language from ancient human inscriptions - which certainly did not include phonetics (this is why NOBODY today can say with certainty how the Latin was REALLY spoken). So it may be that what the alien heard from the android was in fact: "I fart in your general direction. Your mother was a hamster and your father smells of elderberries". Which would explain everything... All doubts being considered in favour of the accused, those mitigating circumstances will be duly weighted at the sentencing, below.<br /><br />There can be however no mitigating circumstances concerning another weakness of the scenario, namely the fact that a mission which cost Weyland Corporation a trillion of dollars is manned by a bunch of total IDIOTS! This Court reminds here, that the crew of "Nostromo", made just of hard working blue collar people, acted with much more logic, caution and discipline than the 17 crew members of "Prometheus", who are for most part simply pathetic. This Court acknowledges however, that captain Janek, pilot Chance, navigator Ravel and medical officer Ford are - to some extent - exceptions here.<br /><br />In the interest of justice, this Court presents here some most blatant examples of above mentioned idiocy:<br /><br />- you were selected to be part of a trillion dollars interstellar mission - so the first time you see an alien skellington you panic and run like crazy away from others!<br />- you were selected to be part of a trillion dollars interstellar mission, because you are a renowned biologist - so the first time the guy next to you sees an alien skellington, panics and runs away like crazy, you scream like a little girl and run after him, so you can get lost together in a maze of dark underground galleries (even if it is YOU who have the only map)...<br />- on a planet able to support life you find an alien underground complex and the atmosphere is OK! Let's all take off our helmets, so we can inhale all the local bacteria, viruses and other stuff against which we have no immunity!<br />- a living creature, vaguely snakelike, appears and approaches - let's give it our hand immediately, after all this is how we handle cobras and vipers on our planet - and I should know, I am a biologist!<br />- oops, I am contaminated by an alien organism and there are already little tentacles growing out of my eye - as I am an educated person with a PhD, I will not say one word about it, I absolutely want this thing to develop until I can not be saved anymore; also let's contaminate the others, after all, Mum always told me it is nice to share!<br />- a guy who was missing for 24 hours signals his presence at the spaceship entry - let's not even have ONE LOOK at him, like for example to see if it is REALLY him, BEFORE opening the doors!<br />- two of my people are stranded in a weird underground complex and there are signs appearing that there is SOMETHING alive inside. Should I maintain regular contact and keep a careful watch over them until they are recovered? Naah! Let's just get drunk and get laid, they will be surely fine... And anyway there is no manpower for this, there is only 15 people left on board...<br />- last but not least, on a trillion dollar interstellar mission on a planet which can support life (and therefore presence of predators can be expected) the whole arsenal on board consists of one shotgun, one handgun and two little flamethrowers - and therefore at some moments it will be down to knives, axes and wrenches...<br /><br />Idiocy being contagious, it is the finding of this Court that the giant aliens a.k.a. Engineers, also caught it:<br /><br />- I am a supremely intelligent ancient life form; I wake up from cryogenic sleep and see facing me five smaller, but clearly intelligent life forms; because I am evil and aggressive I wish to destroy them; of course it doesn't matter that I am alone here and unarmed, and there may be a hundred other small life forms waiting outside, packing heat; it doesn't matter that there is their whole SPACESHIP somewhere outside, which definitely must be packing REAL heat (if only for its propulsive system and mass); it doesn't matter that for all I know there can be a whole FLEET of spaceships on the orbit - no, I am going after them with my bare hands, without collecting the slightest intelligence, without even trying to find some weapons, maybe wake up some reinforcements. Tens of thousands of years of brilliant intelligence development = charge at sight and fight bare handed!<br />- I am a suppremely intelligent ancient life form and my spaceship was just downed by those pesky small life forms; it appears that one of them is still alive and hiding in a small sized but sophisticated container; I want to kill this life form! Should I find a weapon? Use the equipements of my ship which still function to scan the alien container and check for booby traps or weaponry? Go find another spaceship and use its weaponry to vaporize the intruder? No! The correct answer is to charge blindly towards the alien container, with my bare hands, without even having a look for any possible traps or surprises.<br /><br />This Court admits that the casting was made skilfully, but many actors were underused. Idriss Elba (captain Janek) plays very well a tough and brave man - but his screen time is surprisingly limited! Charlize Theron looks in this film as a goddess - frankly, at some moments this Court almost had the impression that looking at her hurt this Court's eyes, so beautiful she is. Her character (Meredith Vickers, mission supervisor) is IMPRESSIVE - but again, the scenario mostly leaves the lead to others and her part in the second part of the film is especially disappointing. Guy Pearce plays Peter Weyland, the CEO and owner of the redoubtable Weyland Corporation. But Peter Weyland is a venerable, truly ancient old man - and Guy Pearce is not, which forces him to wear SO OBVIOUSLY a silly rubber mask! Why Sir Ridley couldn't hire just an old actor (there must be some in Hollywood), is beyond this Court's ability to understand - and forgive.<br /><br />An even more serious charge concerns messing with elements linking "Prometheus" to "Alien". The Engineers, mysterious giant humanoids furtively suggested in the alien spaceship wreck in "Alien" (the giant skeleton sitting in the chair), were a very promising thing for more than 30 years - and in this film all those promises were betrayed! Helmets? Really!? And the short scene revealing the origins of creatures from "Alien" made this Court frankly laugh (and it was a sad laughter...)<br /><br />Some mitigating circumstances are nevertheless recognized:<br /><br />- Michael Fassbender is the real star of this film as he steals the show as David the android.<br />- Noomi Rapace cannot (nobody can!) match Sigourney Weaver, but she still gives a honourable performance. It is highly appreciated by this Court that her character is a believing Christian, even if she seems to be the only one on board (captain Janek may be the second one, but there is not enough hard evidence to prove this). Much will be pardoned to the director for the scene in which she says "This is the Year of Grace 2093".<br />- Another mitigating factor is the scene in which the alien ship develops a crush on Charlize Theron and she in return imprints on it...)))<br />- And finally, it must be recognized that the accused is still suffering from PTSD following his association with a film about Fat Robin Hood and Old Maid Marian...<br /><br />Therefore, taking all the evidence in account, this Court decides as follows: 1. The film itself receives two stars. 2. The director is sentenced to a total of no less than 5 and no more than 15 years of bitch slapping by an alien queen of average size and temper, in a facility to be determined at a further hearing. 3. The sentence is suspended until the opening of the sequel of "Blade Runner" - it will be however executed in full if this film proves to be another disappointment.<br /><br />This Court is now adjourned and will drown its sorrows by ingesting Black Slime. God bless America!</p></br><a href="../users/A9RNMO9MUSMTJ.html">A9RNMO9MUSMTJ</a><br/><p>How many good alien/space/monster movies are out there.....a lot...and lots of them<br />are thumbs down....

Charlize Theron, in particular, put on an exceptional performance. Her character, with never a gelled blond hair out of place, came across as steelier and more robotic than the robot character. On anyone else with a gorgeous figure like hers, the cat-suit would have enhanced the feminine side - on her, it just smoothed over those human little bumps and folds, giving an inhuman impression of plastic perfection.<br /><br />What's not: Pretty much everything else. The space-suit helmets reminded me of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019BI1DM">Outland</a> - the lights pointed inwared, conveniently illunminating the characters' faces, but blinding them in the process. Utter lack of quarantine against alien biota wroked well for the plot but badly for common sense. The android's bio-sabotage of a fellow crewman came across without feeling - not even malice or greed, just one more chore to get done. And, although enjoyable in itself, Noomi Rapace's underwear scene just couldn't compare to Sigourney Weaver's back in the original Alien.<br /><br />If you haven't seen the original <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000VCZK2">Alien</a> movies, and Weaver's "Ripley" character in particular, this comes across as a perfectly adequate SF/monster flick, maybe a cut above in its production values. Alien is iconic, though. Prometheus gives it nothing to fear in its position at the head of modern scary-monster movies.<br /><br />-- wiredweir</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ.html">A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ</a><br/><p>"Prometheus" is an ambitious movie -- it wants to answer (in a sci-fi way) the questions that have haunted humanity for eons.<br /><br />And... it doesn't. This sorta-kinda-maybe prequel to the "Alien" franchise raises a lot of scientific/philosophical questions and never really answers them. But if you can bypass that, it's still a very solid, harrowing sci-fi adventure, with some powerful lead performances and truly brilliant direction by Ridley Scott.<br /><br />Dr. Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and her partner Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green) have discovered ancient star maps that may lead to the Engineers, aliens responsible for making the human race. So with the funding of elderly bazillionaire Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce), they set out to a remote moon on board the Prometheus.<br /><br />Upon landing, the crew finds a vast torc-shaped spaceship, filled with the dead bodies of Engineers. But there is also a bizarre black liquid that ravages anyone who is exposed to it -- and leaves Shaw threatened by a bizarre alien life form. As she discovers the ugly true reason behind the expedition, she also finds that the Engineers are not what she expected...<br /><br />"Prometheus" can be kind of frustrating -- it has a lot of unanswered questions and dangling plot threads, and eventually it makes you feel like it's the first half of a two-part story. And there's a lot of scientific/philosophical/religious stuff that is lightly touched on, but isn't really handled in an insightful way (although it was nice to see a scientist who is also religious).<br /><br />But despite those flaws.... "Prometheus" is actually a really enjoyable movie. There's a lot of passion and earnest intensity to this movie, and it was clearly made with a lot of love.<br /><br />And Ridley Scott's direction is absolutely brilliant -- he interweaves slimy tentacled horror with sleek, shadowy sci-fi, until they are indistinguishable from each other. Everything grows more intense as the black liquid starts mutating the crew members, until the climax explodes into a chaos. Things just spiral more and more out of control, and you never quite know what's going to happen.<br /><br />You also wouldn't recognize Rapace as the girl with the dragon tattoo here -- she's elfin and luminous, with enormous expressive eyes and a mop of rumpled hair. She handles the role of Shaw beautifully -- a person who is deeply religious but also devoted to science, extremely intellectual but also very strong (particular in the... um, medical procedure scene).<br /><br />She's also flanked by awesome performances by the icy, rigid Charlize Theron and the pleasant, charming Idris Elba. But the scene-stealer is Fassbender, who plays a charming, elegant android who occasionally shows some flickers of human emotion. At times he seems soulless and cold, but then we see him watching his favorite movie or asking questions about faith.<br /><br />"Prometheus" is a riveting sci-fi story, albeit a flawed one that never answers most of our questions. Here's hoping "Prometheus 2" is a bit more satisfying.</p></br><a href="../users/A24F1UX8ZT5IXY.html">A24F1UX8ZT5IXY</a><br/><p>When I saw Prometheus in the theater, I thought it messed with the entire mythos of Alien, and pretty much undermined most of that amazing film -- but that Ridley Scott had crafted a science fiction experience unlike any other in years. It was quite mesmerizing to watch, and anything that has to do with discovering hyper-advanced Alien technology is sure to have me hypnotized  -- and there's a lot of that here.<br /><br />But take away the set pieces and this thing is a cobbled-together mess of a film. Not only is it totally new-agey, but it comes across as a juvenile recreation of 2001; the visual cues and themes are all over the place. And we all know that Scott loves Kubrick (just check out The Duellists). The plot winds up pulling some pretty clever tricks out of its hat with its total re-imagining of the Alien universe, and I think it should be given credit for some brilliant ideas particularly regarding the development of the species.<br /><br />But for me where the wheels come off is with the characters. Aside from the outstanding performance and subtext to Michael Fassbender's character (David), no one else in the film is anything better than standard Hollywood fare. Noomi Rapace is okay, but Charlize Theron is positively godawful and Guy Pearce is poorly misused.  The rest of the crew is totally throw-away, and as many other have pointed out, only seem to exist to serve the plot contrivances.<br /><br />So on the positive end of the spectrum you have some of the greatest, jaw-dropping (and thrilling) effects work in years taking place on a planet light years from earth, involving Alien technology, mutated viruses and androids -- while on the other end are weak characters, a gimmicky plot, and an underdeveloped metaphysical theme. Not the first time for Scott with that. The first film said everything that needed to be said, and only had to hint at the larger and more frightening aspects of the material. The biblical allegories are all over the place here -- just look at what he's saying about the development of the planet itself.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>Ridley Scott takes us once again on a dark journey to an alien planet that may be even darker than ALIEN.  Not only is the planet ominous and foreboding, but the space vehicle itself offers little refuge from the outside world.<br />Initially planned as a prequel to the ALIEN franchise, Scott decided to explore the origin of man, constructing a bold scenario to offer one possibility.  Parts of the script seem convoluted and while Noomi Rapace generates some thespian fireworks, Sigourney Weaver's Ripley is too iconic to compare.<br />PROMETHEUS  is a visually stunning movie and the creature effects are fascinating and repulsive.  Michael Fassbender as the android David is excellent and Charlize Theron oozes ice as the evil corporate entity.  Logan Michael Green and Idris Elba lend good support, while Guy Pearce is unrecognizable in a small but pivotal role.<br />Two more PROMETHEUS films are planned which may answer some of the unanswered questions in this film.<br />PROMETHEUS is good film making that is also thought-provoking.</p></br><a href="../users/A17NVM7IAPF2NS.html">A17NVM7IAPF2NS</a><br/><p>...I still enjoyed the hell out of it anyway.<br /><br />First - let's get a major (or not considering how often this is covered in movie reviews) spoiler out of the way.  This is NOT an Alien movie.<br /><br />It is, however, set in the same universe.  Do you recall the ship on LV426 in the first Alien movie discovered by the ill-fated crew of the Nostromo?  Ever wonder who the other aliens were, the ones who originally piloted the craft which included the well-preserved remains of a giant humanoid featuring a chest wound that only foreshadowed what was to come?<br /><br />Ridley Scott answers those questions.  You may not like the answers, but the answers that Ridley Scott does provide are plausible and yet raise more questions at the same time.  Where did humanity come from?  Did we originate from elsewhere?  Does life exist elsewhere?  Do ancient sigils hail from somewhere else?  Two archaelogists would love to find out although their opinions differ from the scientific on one end and from faith on the other.<br /><br />Ridley Scott doesn't usually make the same movie twice and if you're expecting a Blade Runner or Alien out of Prometheus, you will be sorely disappointed.  Prometheus (unlike the Nostromo) is lavishly appointed by its funder, Mr. Weyland, and features state-of-the-art navigation and equipment unlike the funded-for-blue-collar-workers' ship, the Nostromo.  Our crew is also well-equipped to map out the areas, although they do take questionable risks at times.<br /><br />Even so, what they encounter ultimately will change the origins of the Alien mythos and their intended purpose may not be as far off from the vision that Weyland-Yutani had in mind for them later on in the franchise.<br /><br />Yes, you'll read in some of the reviews that some characters are cardboard cutouts, some lines are cliched, and it is also not a game-changer in the sci-fi genre, but what Ridley Scott still manages to accomplish is an enormous sense of scale in both his world creation, environments, and scope of story.<br /><br />This movie certainly invites additional outings to be sure and with additional questions to be answered, I hope that he's on board to continue the ride.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZBOBV9H1HDV.html">A3LZBOBV9H1HDV</a><br/><p>"Prometheus" is excellent! This is how the story goes: A team of explorers discover a clue to the origins of mankind on Earth, leading them on a thrilling journey to the darkest corners of the universe.

It is also a well-crafted, well-made film that is conceptually different than other sci-fi films of its kind. Ridley Scott's return to sci-fi after 30 years is impressive, another excellent film for him, as well. Noomi Rapace & Michael Fassbender lead a well-rounded cast of characters.

Wanting to try to figure out all the ambiguities of that film, & it was very ambiguous, with no clues about the xenomorph & the alien spaceship, & where they came from. So, all I have to say about "Prometheus" is, without giving it all away:<br /><br />Genius, pure, genius! It answered all my questions about the first film, then some! It also created more ambiguities, but that's the charm of many great films, leaving the viewer wanting more. Just like life, there is never no complete answers on where you'll be tomorrow, what will happen to you after you die, or who is responsible for life on the grand scale. So goes "Prometheus," for it can't answer those questions either, but it does make you wonder.<br /><br />A new chapter has been born, one that leaves room for other, maybe more intriquing chapters to come, full of more ambiguous questions for the next film to explain?<br /><br />Quite the accomplishment, Mr. Scott!</p></br><a href="../users/A1KD8NJPZ01R37.html">A1KD8NJPZ01R37</a><br/><p>Foremost, Ridley Scott. The name is practically synonomous with something that will entertain you.<br /><br />And second, who would find fault with a genuine attempt at a good movie??<br /><br />Okay, there are a few problems, but nothing that would prevent me from thoroughly enjoying this movie. It was awesome.<br /><br />For factual people out there, there are some very legitimate "problems" with our whole history of evolution. What has been taught and thought for the last 100 years has been a questionable enterprise. There are historical sites around the world that call into question some very basic ideas that most of us hold as TRUE. Current underwater archeology has shown cities that are not where they should be. That the 11 or 13,000 years of human activity may actually be a LOT longer. I know, it infuriates some people to think that some of the human history we accept, may be a little off. Or totally wrong, different, longer. Using Procession of the Earth, some very respected scientists are dating the Great Pyramid to an age of 13,000 years (this would be to accurately point the 'holes' directly at those stars, and there's no way to carbon date the Pyramid, so who's to say?).<br /><br />The point is, that our history IS ACTUALLY a mystery, the greatest mystery. And for someone to offer up a fictional story, exploring an idea is wonderful. No, I don't think that Prometheus accurately tells our historical beginnings, but why not think outside of the BOX? It's the only way we will ever get closer to the truth. The TRUTH, IS INDEED STRANGER THAN FICTION. If anything, I believe that. So go on Ridley, you keep at it, I AM ENTERTAINED. That's the whole point of a good story, NO??</p></br><a href="../users/A1KZQ5DIX0YUE1.html">A1KZQ5DIX0YUE1</a><br/><p>Where do I start? Do I praise the visual effects and amazingly detailed sets? Do I call out the haters and point out that the bulk of their complaints were based on the movie not being what they thought it'd be? What about the epic 7.1 soundtrack and score? The ferocious Noomi Rapace? The synthetic David? The fact that the Prometheus ship looks like a Firefly on steroids? There are a few hundred reviews that wrongly wax on plot elements and acting. Here's the film AND the BD review:<br /><br />This IS an ALIEN movie. We are watching the start of it all. While the film takes place in the same meta-plot, it is easy to see the creatures presented being some how related to xenomorphs... maybe with a dose or two of Cthulhu mentality - tentacles a plenty.  The BD release has some great features by way of deleted scenes (some that might have done better to have been kept in the film), commentary tracks (Ridley Scott pretty much narrates the film, but it's not as bad as it sounds; he gets really excited about this film), and a background featurette that focuses on Wayland. The visuals are amazing on an up-to-date BD player, and as I said, we get the treat of 7.1 (which shook my apartment, literally, at normal volumes; so be mindful of the volume unless you want your photos and whatnots to get shaken off the walls at what you might consider a 'normal' volume). It's overpowering at points, but it sounds great despite the heft of it.<br /><br />Enjoy this for what it is - a long awaited reunion to the Alien epic universe. We're just going to be experiencing some elements that were never covered in the Alien franchise. Where does that leave us?<br /><br />Where else, but in the trusted hands of Mr. Ridley Scott. It seems this new trilogy is going to answer more than the questions left open by the film Prometheus. We're getting to see some answers that have gone unanswered for over 30 years. Key word there - some.<br /><br />I've waited this long; the promise of two more films in this series have me waiting, hopeful, that Mr. Scott can deliver the next movies on the same level that is Prometheus. Beautiful. Epic. Eerie. And more than a little... alien.</p></br><a href="../users/A3TYC8T6W81DDB.html">A3TYC8T6W81DDB</a><br/><p>This film is absolutely gorgeous from beginning to end. The "beginning of time" montage that starts the film is beautiful; roaming shots of the Icelandic countryside and angry waterfalls wash over you as the score tries to soothe you in a way that feels like it's trying to mislead you. It's as if it's trying to say, "There there, it'll be alright," and pats you softly on the hand like a caring grandmother before turning around in the next scene and growing to its peak as something horrific takes place on screen that wasn't expected mere moments ago.<br /><br />Everything is awe-inspiring to look at. One of the reasons for that is that Scott tried to use as little CGI in the film as possible (although there are over 1300 digital VFX shots) and mostly stuck to computer generated shots being used in space. If you're not blown away by the scenery, their exploration of the planet's surface and what that leads to, or the incredible shots in space, the technology they use in the film is beyond astounding; Reacting with holograms, 3D maps that can be accessed with the swipe of a finger, and an android capable of doing things some people only dream of is only scratching the surface.<br /><br />Where do we come from? Who are our makers? Will we still trust our faith when we find the answers? These are the questions "Prometheus" explores in its story. You also have a pretty great idea of just what the heck a Space Jockey is by the time "Prometheus" ends. The thing is that if you go into this expecting a straight shooting "Alien" prequel, you'll more than likely be disappointed. There are definitely nods to it and parts of the film play out similarly to "Alien," but this is more like taking place in the same universe as "Alien" and more of an indirect prequel. That quote Ridley Scott gave about this "having 'Alien' DNA," is extremely accurate.<br /><br />"Prometheus" isn't perfect. It may be really slow moving for some. It takes its sweet time establishing its atmosphere and you may be left wanting a bit more action. Patient viewers who can sit still and admire dialogue and a solid story will be rewarded while trigger happy viewers will more than likely get antsy. The ending, although somewhat satisfying, is mostly just this huge tease. If a sequel isn't made, we should probably riot; although, with repeat viewings, it's less of a problem.<br /><br />The biggest issue people may have is that technology seems so much more advanced in the past than in the future. "Prometheus" mostly takes place in 2093 while "Alien" takes place in 2122. You also have to keep in mind that the Prometheus is a more advanced ship than the Nostromo, a towing vessel; more of a grunt ship. So the argument could go either way.<br /><br />Repeat viewings also leave you with more questions. The main one being why did the atmosphere have such an altering affect on the ampule room yet didn't affect the cargo hold at all?<br /><br />"Prometheus" is really freaking superb on one hand. Its cast is ridiculous and every one of them delivers, the visuals are fantastic, and the storyline is mostly incredibly enthralling. Imagine being a film critic who's used to taking notes throughout the duration of a film, but during "Prometheus" you were so absorbed in it that you didn't write anything down other than the title. That's kind of a big deal.<br /><br />On the other hand, something more definitive seems like it would have been more gratifying. With stakes so high that define what we, as humans, actually are, an open ending leaving room for a sequel feels like a bit of a cop out. "Prometheus" is still spectacular and mesmerizing. Ridley Scott is back in top form, but "Prometheus" suffers from pulling (and relying on) the strings of anticipation a bit too much.</p></br><a href="../users/AE9V37MS6QY8D.html">AE9V37MS6QY8D</a><br/><p>For those of you wondering ... yes, this is a prequel to the 1979 sci-fi hit <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00011V8IQ">Alien (The Director's Cut)</a>. However, it is notsomuch the origin of the Alien (even though that is included), but it is more of the origin story of the Weyland Corporation (from the Weyland-Yutani Corporation of the original "Alien" movie franchise) and his true obsessive reasoning for space exploration. The overall story structure of the film follows closely to the original "Alien" in regard to the fact that it starts out slow and appearing as some mere space exploration film, but then all hell breaks loose! Not much happens in the exact story, but the overall legend that this story adds to the Alien universe is essential! Plus, "Prometheus" has a scene involving a high-tech operation table where my jaw literally dropped; I couldn't believe that writers Lindelof (of TV's "Lost") and Spaihts went there! And just when you think, "What's gonna happen now?", the film answers your question but with one minor caveat (the ending is still somewhat open), and ultimately ends on a great note that will give film geeks that orgasmic feeling. Performances are wonderful, effects are even better and the alien design is exquisite! Kudos, Mr. Scott! Kudos.</p></br><a href="../users/A3HM5G9IV1FTFP.html">A3HM5G9IV1FTFP</a><br/><p>Ridley Scott's "Prometheus" is the yin to "Avatar's" yang. Both are high-budget, visually stunning sci-fi films. But while James Cameron's "Avatar" was a crowd-pleasing affair, creating a vibrant, almost psychedelic world, "Prometheus" is a somber, cerebral and ambiguous piece of filmmaking.<br /><br />Two archaeologists, Elizabeth (Noomi Rapace) and her boyfriend Charlie (Logan Marshall-Green) discover cave paintings around the world, all from different civilizations and eras, which point to a moon far away in space which has the ability to support life. The two are convinced that the creators of human life (or "Engineers" as they refer to them) are from there, and that the paintings are an actual invitation to visit. They find a corporate sponsor (Wayland Corp.) willing to bankroll a trillion-dollar space mission to the faraway moon to investigate (although it's clear from the beginning that they have their own motives beyond just the archeologists' fantasy of meeting humanity's creators). So off Elizabeth and Charlie go, along with an entire crew which includes android David (a spellbinding Michael Fassbender) and Wayland Corp. administrator (an icy Charlize Theron).<br /><br />And so it begins. Anyone who's seen any of the "Alien" films will have no doubt that the crew is not, sadly, going to be meeting up with a benevolent, advanced civilization that created humanity and welcomes them with open arms. The film is called "Prometheus," which refers to a Greek myth about a god who is punished for helping humanity by being forced to have his liver eaten, and then regenerate in order to relive the ordeal day after day. In my opinion, the myth of "Oedipus" would be just as fitting a reference for this film; Oedipus' fatal flaw, his relentless need to learn the truth, is what caused his downfall and suffering. Similarly, the main characters in the film mostly share a need to find the origin and meaning behind human life, and suffer greatly for it.<br /><br />"Don't we all want to see our parents die?" asks David at one point, which is a strange question coming from an android who doesn't actually have parents per se. But the film explores, on many levels, the oftentimes antagonistic relationship between parent/child and creator/creation.</p></br><a href="../users/A35R8PJSEURHHF.html">A35R8PJSEURHHF</a><br/><p>The movie kept my interest the whole way through!

It is the year 2093 and there may be life present on this remote planet. This prequel to the great 1980 film Alien contains the pre-story to the discovery of the species that terrified the crew of that film. Modern-day expertise has improved the visual capabilities that filmmakers can achieve, which are enhanced further by 3D technology in this film. Unfortunately, Ridley Scott populated this film with characters that you don't get to know well and don't particularly care about, sans one. However, the movie is exciting and visually stimulating enough to make it a worth while film-going experience.</p></br><a href="../users/A1845IJB63D5H7.html">A1845IJB63D5H7</a><br/><p>The contrast between the very advanced animation art and the mediocre planning of the crew, in Prometheus, is an afterthought. The story for searching for the creator was compelling in the sense that the Earth explorers, via comparative studies of various Earth's civilizations were hinted that a specific planet in a nearby star-system might host the original creators of our Earth species. Up to this point, everything looks very realistic.<br /><br />Skip the funding alibis; get to the machine that will voyage to the remote planet and its crew. The spaceship was truly impressively depicted. With onsite surgical robot in case of medical emergency, plenty of dream automated technologies that captured the imagination and render the movie enjoyable.<br /><br />Things get annoying when the exploring crew move into the mysterious structure on the remote planet and start violating the protocol of exploration. Even a dialogue between a smoker explorer and a nonsmoker shows the improper embarking on incompetent people for such extremely complicated mission. All exposed individuals got infected with mysterious parasites or DNA altering agents.<br /><br />With few crew members, taking the risk of making stupid mistakes and ending up being exterminated, in order to spare the remaining crew the risk of spread of infection, rendered the science fiction less challenging. There was compelling sequence of events that certain human activities were in process in the parked spaceship on such remote planet. Such compelling logic could have be farther enhanced to advance a more intriguing conclusion than spoiling the scenario with some foolish errors by scientists uncaring about the basics of their craft.<br /><br />In comparison to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0083SBJXS">Marvel's The Avengers</a>, which I enjoyed watching few times, Prometheus is not that kind of movie that would attract me to see it more than once. The few memorable scenes were silent, gray, and not very engaging.<br /><br />One would question the rationale of inserting into the movie a robot of the exact likeness of man, then let that robot conspire to transmit DNA stolen from the site of exploration into the drink of the principle investigator of the expedition crew, which led to the death of the crew member and the impregnation of his mate with alien fetus. In fact, David the robot was entirely a misfit. Likewise, the ship captain performed as if he was a cap driver, with very limited intellectual feel of his role in scientific expedition. It is truly fortunate that the moveimakers are not entrusted with selecting scientific crews of such eminent tasks.<br /><br />Mohamed F.

It is the same star cluster as painted in numerous cave paintings found around the world and made by civilizations separated by thousands of miles and thousands of years.

It is 200 trillion miles from earth and its crew of 17 is awakened by the ship's systems and the on board robot who has cared for the ship during their sleep.  Will they find the clues about the origins of mankind or unlock Pandora's Box....<br /><br />This movie is touted as a prequel to the Alien series of movies.  It has a great story line and a good cast so the movie had a lot of potential.  I wind up rating it as a 4 star film but it was somewhere between a 3 and a 4 star movie.  The special effects were very good and the acting was also above average.  What lowered the movie in my opinion was the silliness of the script and the actions of the characters.<br /><br />If you were to write down the 10 to 15 things that any intelligent person would not do in the event of an alien encounter while on another planet and watch this movie then you would see them do every one of them in about 2 hours.  What is it with Hollywood that makes them think that having characters behave like this is entertaining?<br /><br />This movie had the potential to be a 5 star movie as the premise was excellent.  The execution of the characters behavior was just outlandishly silly.  I will not list the flaws of the movie here because it would expose too much of the details of the film but to me it dropped the films rating.  I gave it a 3 star rating and my wife gave it a 4.  Since my feeling was between a 3 and a 4 star I compromised to a 4 star.<br /><br />The movie is reasonably entertaining it just is not spectacular in its production.  It is now where near as scary, entertaining or suspenseful as the first Alien movie with Sigourney Weaver.  It had the same potential but poor script writing made you just wish that some of the characters would die because they deserved to for being stupid.<br /><br />It is worth while watching but don't expect a classic that will receive top notch reviews from everyone who sees it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3QJU4FEN8PQSZ.html">A3QJU4FEN8PQSZ</a><br/><p>In this movie, Scott explores again the theme of creator versus creation. However, it is maddeningly incomplete - sometimes purposefully, I hope. (POSSIBLE SPOILERS)<br /><br />A pale-skinned "god" sacrifices himself to seed a planet - ours? - with his DNA. Why is his dramatic death necessary? How about a blood extraction? It appears to be ritualistic and gratuitous. Perhaps it speaks to the theme of God's self-sacrifice in Christianity, and is meant to be a basis (racial memory, etc.) for such elements in religion.<br /><br />So, the team takes off in a Weyland ship to meet their makers. On the journey, we are entertained by watching David, the android, who passes time shooting hoops, watching movies, and eavesdropping on his co-passengers' dreams. Rapace's Shaw remembers her father, who passes on to her his reasons for belief - "choosing to believe" - which Shaw echoes.<br /><br />On the one hand, this sounds maddeningly unscientific, which is Scott's intent. However, as recent philosophers and historians of science have come to agree, Shaw's answer is actually the only basis for believing science can tell us anything - faith in a rational God who is consistent (due to his promises) is the underlying foundation of modern knowledge. As Nancey Pearcey summarizes for us in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0891077669">The Soul of Science: Christian Faith and Natural Philosophy (Turning Point Christian Worldview Series)</a> Rejection of this foundation has left the sciences (and even math) in deep confusion, although we see the external shell continuing to operate.<br /><br />Also, in our real world, many scientists or agnostics have embraced "faith" due to what they have discovered in science (e.g. Allen Sandage). But that's another story. I doubt that Scott, whose "1492" was filled with historical gaffes (no one during Columbus's time thought the world was flat), was even aware of these points.<br /><br />Things start to not make sense. Finding that the air is breathable, they remove their helmets. That's right. Who needs to worry about infectious agents in an alien world? Then two scientists, including the one who mapped the alien structure/ship they find, get lost. Later, one of them tries to pet a hitherto unknown alien life form, with bad results.<br /><br />Some of the crew are dismissive of David, almost rude and contemptuous. This behavior is hard to believe, unless we accept this as objective, scientific callousness (they know David has no feelings - or does he?), but is needed for a creepy plot point where, in conversation with David, one of them essentially approves his own demise. It's a very effective and squirmworthy scene.<br /><br />In another scene, the captain opens the door to an unexpected visitor. Right. Chaos ensues. In a way, it's all rather silly, if you think about it.<br /><br />There are questions. Is Vickers an android as well? Or is she Weyland's daughter? Weyland says David is the closest he'll have to a son, and Vickers looks pained. Some think this means she's really human (along with the fact that she has sex with humans). Yet later she slams super-strong David against a wall to get him to divulge something. Is this super-strength or is David merely humoring her? (The fact that she calls Weyland "Father" means nothing. Androids tend to become unpredictable in the movies, and David is no exception, either.)<br /><br />Also, why do the Engineers want to destroy us? Are we a threat? There is a phrase in the movie to the effect that "sometimes to create you first have to destroy." Likewise, Vickers is waiting for Weyland to die so she can take over ("A king dies ...") and David seems to want his creators dead ("Doesn't everyone ...?") Do the Engineers want to start over? Or is it just a necessary step in their whole scheme of things? Is something else going to take over from us?<br /><br />Or ... are we their creators? Wow.<br /><br />Why does the awakened Engineer go beserk? What did David say to him? A great scene underscoring the importance of android-thought-process monitoring, but somewhat abrupt.<br /><br />And why are there still other ships and Engineers on the planet, after 2,000 years? Are they on Union rules? (Note: this seems to be a different planet than the one in Aliens.)<br /><br />So many questions, hopefully to be answered in a sequel, where Scott can really jump the shark. A real fear, if you know what his "twist" in Blade Runner (regarding Tyrell) was supposed to be, thankfully averted.<br /><br />Note, though, the movie's tie-ins to "In the Mountains of Madness". I don't know how much Scott sticks to that plot, but it may explain most everything.<br /><br />The CGI is mostly great, except for the Engineer's death at the start (looks a little cartoonish). But otherwise the visuals are sci-fi wonderful. The monolithic spaceship hovering over the barren planet. The Prometheus, the Porsche to the Nostromo's Tonka. The Engineers. The Engineer seated in his slithering seat. The falling of the alien ship. (Too bad the cause was telegraphed in the trailers - I would have liked that to be a surprise.) The color palettes and production design demand to be seen over and over again. And I can't wait to see this on a 3D TV.<br /><br />The score evokes a theme or two from Blade Runner, appropriately.<br /><br />Ultimately, it's a little confused or confusing. The people don't behave logically, and some plot points don't make sense. But any fan of Blade Runner and sci fi will enjoy it nevertheless. Fassbender's David is spellbinding, and is reason alone to enjoy this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>&lt;strong>Prometheus&lt;/strong> (Ridley Scott, 2012)<br /><br />You know what? If &lt;em>Prometheus&lt;/em> had been directed by anyone other than Ridley Scott, or if it hadn't been marketed as an &lt;em>Alien&lt;/em> prequel--I am working on the hypothesis that it originally was not, and the &lt;em>Alien&lt;/em> elements were retrofitted either at the insistence of the studio or when Scott and Spaits/Lindelof realized how much there was in common there--we wouldn't be having any of the discussions we are currently having about this movie. We'd probably be pretty united in hailing it as one of the more inventive (if derivative), and certainly one of the most technically accomplished, science fiction movies in recent memory, probably the best sci-fi movie since &lt;em>Cube&lt;/em> almost fifteen years ago. From a technical standpoint, &lt;em>Prometheus&lt;/em> is unassailable; the acting is pitch-perfect, the direction is exactly what one would expect form the guy who brought you &lt;em>Gladiator&lt;/em> and &lt;em>Bladerunner&lt;/em>, every member of the crew brought his or her A game, the 3D is hands-down the best I've seen since &lt;em>Cave of Forgotten Dreams&lt;/em> (and is used much in the same way, to my delight). In short, this is the type of movie for which the word "sumptuous" was coined. Forget all that Merchant-Ivory boondoggle. (After all, what are sci-fi films if not period dramas for periods that haven't happened yet?) It is, in short, an impressive achievement by any empirical yardstick one would choose to measure it with.<br /><br />The problem is, of course, that it &lt;em>was&lt;/em> directed by Ridley Scott, and even if you hadn't caught all the in-jokes and references in the script before you hit the final sequence, well, when you get to that point there's no denying this is an &lt;em>Alien&lt;/em> movie. (And in a movie that seemed awfully retrofitted, that final sequence was the most garishly tacked-on bit. But I am getting ahead of myself.) Now, while I am a pretty darned big fan of the Alien series, or at least the first three movies (I still to this day have not gotten round to seeing &lt;em>Alien Resurrection&lt;/em>, despite pretty much everyone I know telling me how much better it is than &lt;em>Alien&lt;supr>3&lt;/supr>&lt;/em>, a movie I actually quite liked), and even the one guy in the room who actually enjoyed &lt;em>Alien vs. Predator&lt;/em> for the stupid fun fanboy movie it was, I'm still a casual fan of the series as opposed to a true &lt;em>otaku&lt;/em>. You kind of have to be, in order to enjoy the big stuff-blows-up stupidity of &lt;em>Alien vs. Predator&lt;/em> in any way.<br /><br />There's also another layer to this, and one that most people don't seem to have thought about, but that's come up a few times in my discussions on the movie since I saw it Friday night (I'm writing this on the following Monday afternoon); there's a meta layer that was absent from the other films. And perhaps I'm overstepping the bounds here, but it seems to me that Scott and co., and specifically Avy Kaufman, who cast Noomi Rapace as a character named Elizabeth (and in at least one place during an action scene, an actor slips up and calls her character Lisbet), pretty much invited this meta layer into the film. And it casts an interesting light on what has become one of the movie's big controversies. But again, I'm getting ahead of myself.<br /><br />NOTE: There is one thing revealed in the synopsis that I can't believe is a spoiler, though there is a scene in the film that leads me to believe it was meant that way. If you are especially spoiler-sensitive, you may want to skip over the synopsis.<br /><br />Plot: two sceintists, Elizabeth Shaw (Rapace, rocketed to fame through playing Lisbeth Salander in the Millennium trilogy) and Charlie Holloway (&lt;em>Devil&lt;/em>'s Logan Marshall-Green), uncover what would seem to be a star map in the cave paintings and stone carvings of half a dozen, maybe more, ancient civilizations. Thanks to new-and-improved 2089 technology, they pinpoint the exact star system those paintings depict.<br /><br />[Problem #1: 35,000+ years later, the positions of some of those stars will have changed; after a tenth of that, some of the Greek constellations have lost their original shapes to modern eyes.]<br /><br />So Weyland Technologies, headed up by the very, very old Peter Weyland (&lt;em>The Adventures of Priscilla&lt;/em>'s Guy Pearce, and I'd be tempted to ask him which film had the tougher make-up job) and his ice-queen daughter Meredith Vickers (&lt;em>Monster&lt;/em>'s Charlize Theron), send a ship out to this star system, which happens to contain one very earth-like moon revolving a Saturn-like planet. The ship contains seventeen crew members, including various scientists, navigators, Vickers as the Weyland Technologies representative, and an android named David (&lt;em>Shame&lt;/em>'s Michael Fassbender) who learns human mannerisms from watching old movies obsessively, but, as a hologram of Weyland reminds us during the mission briefing, has no soul. Holloway and Shaw believe this planet to be the home of a race they call the Engineers--advanced beings who created the human race. When they get to the planet they do indeed find evidence that something other than nature has been there ("God does not create in straight lines," as Holloway tells us), but of course, what they are seeking and what they find are two entirely different things...<br /><br />As regards the meta I spoke of earlier, and its particular application to &lt;em>Prometheus&lt;/em>: Michael Fassbender garnered a great deal of critical acclaim for his role in &lt;em>Shame&lt;/em>, playing a sex addict. An interesting choice to play the role of an asexual robot, especially when so many of your audience members leave asking themselves (or the people they were with) "was David gay?". It's a frankly ridiculous question to even be asking, and while half of me doubts that 90%+ of the people involved in the debate are even aware &lt;em>Shame&lt;/em> exists, it still feels like that particular casting choice forced the issue, rather like not changing the name of Noomi Rapace's character. And I've been mulling on this for days without being able to come up with another motive than "provide non-controversy to get butts in seats." Which seems to be working, but it feels a little disingenuous.<br /><br />But you know what else? I'm going to ask you to forget all that. I'm also going to ask you to forget about all those plot holes that aren't really plot holes (if you're watching the movie on DVD, pause it when they reveal the designation of the planet, then go back and watch the first &lt;em>Alien&lt;/em>; they're two different, albeit somehow related, planets), forget about the anachronisms that make this ship so much technologically cooler (despite predating it) than the Nostromo, forget this movie is in any way related to the Alien franchise, which it actually &lt;em>is&lt;/em> possible to do until you get to that last sequence that drove me up the wall. Instead, focus on the other obvious source material from which they drew when writing this script: &lt;em>2001&lt;/em>. All the stuff about exploration and the dawn of man and all that. That, to me, is where the core of this film lay: in the sense of wonder at the discoveries they were making. &lt;em>That&lt;/em> is what this movie was about, and in that, it succeeded as well as it could given the script tinkering and retrofitting and all the other silliness. All of which means this is not a perfect movie by any means, but it is a lovely one, and worth seeing. *** ?</p></br><a href="../users/A26IVJJTXOE85B.html">A26IVJJTXOE85B</a><br/><p>"Prometheus" is a glorious sci fi masterpiece. I haven't felt so enthralled by a film like this in years. When you see this film, you will realize how many of the sci fi films of the past fifteen years were all style over substance. Special FX films like "Avatar" and "Revenge if the Sith," which I love, cannot compete with this original vision and deep level of storytelling. Aside from films such as "Inception" and "Children of Men," many of the sci fi films that come out today lack originality, deep character development, and intelligence. Prometheus gives us that in spades, along with a sense of sci fi mysticism that I haven't felt in over a decade. It is amazing how Ridley Scott emulates everything that made his original Alien so great, while at the same time being able to stand completely apart from that film. It is rare that a sequel can stand on its own and at the same time give us the best of what the original gave us. In fact, this is exactly how I felt while watching this film; it gave me the same suspense and intrigue I had when watching the original "Alien" when I was a young boy. I am a huge movie buff and I have seen thousands of films and I can honestly say that this film will be around for a long time, being studied and revered for its great achievement in character development and film making. I honestly want to say that this is the best film in the "Alien" franchise since the original. Yes, "Aliens" was awesome but let's be honest; that was an action film. "Prometheus" takes us into the unknown and abandons us in filmmaking heaven; we don't know if whether we want to stay and marvel at the wonder of it all or flee in utter terror.<br /><br />I was completely blown away by all the actors. Everyone is raving about Fassbender's performance, which was great but Noomi Rampace was mind blowing. In my honest opinion she touched me on a more emotional level than Ripley ever did and that says a lot. I almost can't believe that I just typed that!<br /><br />The cinematography was breathtaking and the set pieces and designs make "Avatar" look like a Disney channel show.  I haven't seen sci fi FEEL so realistic since the early 80's films. Then again, that's why you hired the man; Ridley Scott!!<br /><br />The story is mesmerizing and captivating. Those who subscribe to or are interested in the ancient astronaut theory regarding the origins of man will adore this film. It will be twice as nice if you subscribe to the ancient astronaut theory and love "Alien", like me!! This film gave the "Alien" universe more credibility. It no longer feels like Hollywood magic. It feels like the possibility of an unknown terror being linked to the human destiny is out there in some dark corner of our universe. This film goes way deeper than any of the other "Alien" films ever did.<br /><br />There are also 2 scenes from this film that will stay with me forever. I couldn't stop thinking about these 2 sequences when I left the theater. It was like seeing the alien pop out of John Hurt in "Alien" for the first time. The reason why these 2 scenes are so powerful is because of the emotional resonance they have with the viewer, not because of gore, which is something rarely felt and seen in films today.<br /><br />SPOILER<br />I'm talking about the scene where Noomi gives herself a C-section, racing against the birth of her "alien" and when her lover is set alive on fire by the flame thrower. Boy, did this chick go through some tough stuff and I felt for her every minute!<br /><br />END SPOILER****<br /><br />This film will be misunderstood. People expecting to see a lot of action will be very disappointed. This film is all about mood, character development, mystery and suspense. Many people claim that this film doesn't have any answers, regarding the Alien mythology but I completely disagree. I left the film feeling 100% satisfied and received answers to nearly all my questions. Put it like this: the people who don't get this film are the same people who didn't understand Inception. The people who won't like this film are the people who didn't grow up to the original Alien or are turned off by films that don't have much action. For those who didn't get the "answers" to your questions, what is it exactly that you want? You want the film makers to spell it out for you? You want them to chew your food too?!<br /><br />Well I'll do it for you!! Really fast!<br /><br />SPOILERS!!<br /><br />The space jockey in the very beginning commits suicide because he has been stranded with malfunctioning biological weaponry created to destroy the human race, a race they genetically engineered. This biological weaponry is out of control and killing the space jockeys in terrible ways. Archeologists discover many ancient artifacts and relics throughout various cultures that depict the origins of our creators to be in the system of planets that the space jockeys are using to create their biological weaponry. An expedition goes underway and scientist come across some sort of a microbial black ooze and other substance in vases that eventually contribute to the creation of an evolutionary prototype of the face huggers (from Alien) when fused with a human. Apparently this black ooze is what the space jockeys have been engineering on the planet and when it comes into contact with another life form, it fuses to create something quite ghastly. Example, the black ooze merging with the worms  (this is slightly ambiguous but they showed those earth worm things for a reason) which caused the death of the two geologists who were stranded. The thousand year old black mural depicting the traditional alien we all know and love, and the fact that the dead engineers had burst chests, infer that the aliens are out there; a result of biological weaponry engineering and that black ooze. The engineers were perhaps experimenting with them, or trying to recreate them. Now when the black ooze merged with a human it drove them mad and through sexual reproduction creates a primitive form of the face hugger. When the face hugger merged with the space jockey it created a Xenomorph prototype. Basically, engineered microbial substance from vase + human + plus sexual reproduction = primitive face hugger. Primitive face hugger + space jockey = primitive Xenomorph. The Xenomorhps we know and love are both a product of biological engineering by the space jockeys and evolutionary adaptation. We don't see the exact aliens from the Alien franchise but we see their evolutionary ancestors and how they were created. The end.  HOW DID YOU NOT UNDERSTAND THIS PEOPLE??!!!<br /><br />As far as questions such as, "Where are the space jockeys from?" "What about that specific space jockeyship that was in "Alien", where is that?" For me those questions don't matter because the film stated that there was more than one ship on the planet and those ships can easily be hosting another space jockey. Honestly I could care less because all my bigger questions were answered about the space jockeys and the alien as a whole and I really don't care too much about that exact specific ship that was seen in Alien.<br /><br /> "Why did the space jockeys change their minds about the human race?" Just turn on your local news channel, you'll see why! It's ambiguous and it's supposed to be. The filmmakers want you to reflect on some of the themes presented and I thought that was great! It was awesome how the film doesn't give you all the answers. That's what made some of greatest films. That's what made Alien, Blade Runner, Inception, and Children of Men so great. This is one of those films people are going to watch over and over and keep finding new things in it every time...kinda like a couple of other movies buy this guy named Ridley. Thank you Ridley. Thank you for more poetry on celluloid.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GD1G8XXPRYQ8.html">A1GD1G8XXPRYQ8</a><br/><p>Prometheus got the story, visual effects, but it lacks action. I watched the first hour of the movie and I felt boredom. Then, almost at the end I got my desired action. Another disappointment is lack of aliens from other movies. I don't know whether it was good or bad. We saw the new species, but as the prequel to alien I expected to see at least one facehugger. I don't really see much connection between Xenomorphs and those aliens. Then, at the end I wanted to see the scientist travel to another planet. Those who watched the movie, know why she would travel on that planet, but still they could just give another 30 minutes to show exactly what would happen. Ending didn't satisfy me. There will be no second part to the movie, so I felt disappointed. Still, it isn't a waste of time, just a little boring movie. And last but not least, I knew there would a famous actress playing in Prometheus. I expected Angelina Jolie. But Charlize Theron was chosen and she was great! I really thought that this decision would suck. I was wrong. She was by far my favorite actress in the movie. Others played good, but I had no feelings to them.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ICW5OUWX2A2V.html">A2ICW5OUWX2A2V</a><br/><p>Prequels to extremely popular films rarely turn out well.  By and large, they're not great, and only occasionally good.  Even rarer is a prequel that is just as good as the originals...but "Prometheus" is not one of them.  It gets so tantalizingly close to reaching that coveted rank, but just misses it.<br /><br />In the near future, a group of scientists travel to a distant planet for the scientific expedition of a lifetime: the chance to learn exactly where humans came from, and the chance to meet with our creators.  But upon arriving, they quickly learn that they may have discovered something that will lead to humanity's end.<br /><br />In many ways, "Prometheus" is an excellent film: its basic concept (what if humans were created by aliens and we could go and meet them?) is fantastic; the atmosphere and visuals are top notch, and when the film hits it's stride, it's an undeniable masterpiece, especially during the first half, where there's a constant sense of exploration and adventure, of finding new things and getting closer and closer to a coveted goal.  "Prometheus" functions as a prequel to 1979's, "Alien" and although events in this film do not lead into the original, there are numerous winks and nods towards what has come before, which are a delight for fans of the Xenomorph creature.  I especially loved learning more about the so called, "Space Jockey" creature that was seen in the original, and learning more about it's species, which arguably makes for the most engaging moments in the film.<br /><br />Sadly however, while "Prometheus" is more often then not, a fascinating film, it makes some huge blunders along the way.  The pacing in the second half of the second act unexpectedly ratchets up from slow paced to breakneck, with things happening so fast it's easy to loose track of what's going on, especially with regards to the characters (of which there are too many), and why they act the way they do; for a bunch of scientists, they make some really stupid decisions (look!  An alien life form!  Let's try to pick it up when it's clearly angry at us!) and do really bizarre things (one character, after going through a rather horrific act, goes back to wandering around the ship/exploring without bothering to tell anyone what happened, which bugs me to no end).  David the android, in particular, while fascinating to watch, lacks the simple, effective characterization that Ash and Bishop had; he does things seemingly out of random, and even two days after seeing the film, I'm still trying to figure out his motivations.<br /><br />The editing also adds to the frustration, as I got the sense that a lot was cut out of the finished film, as the rushed pace feels like a lot was cut out to save on the running time.  But worst of all is the feeling of not getting any closure. "Prometheus" raises questions it has no intention of answering, and with the ending hinting towards a sequel, the movie feels frustratingly incomplete, rather then a stand-alone film.<br /><br />While "Prometheus" comes so tantalizingly close to being a perfect film, it's incomplete feeling, breakneck speed, and choppy editing pull it down (though the third act does manage to recover, and ends with a rather spectacular finale).  It's a great movie, and when it worked, I was more absorbed in it then any other film in recent memory, but I was left with the maddening feeling that it could have crossed the threshold into classic territory if it had been a little more focused and tightened up.  Still, for what it is, it's a great ride for anyone who's ever wondered if we owe our existence to beings beyond the stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A3SS6VRWCTB7V.html">A3SS6VRWCTB7V</a><br/><p>First of all, "Blade Runner" is the best SYFY movie I have ever seen and I have seen plenty and "Alien" was one scarey, very good, movie BUT Scott......why???

But this movie is not in the same league as many, many, other SYFY movies by lesser known or celebrated directors. SO, all that said, perhaps not a bad movie rental. Date movie? I guess, maybe. Blah, wishes I could give it a good review but I just can't. Hope Scott does better next time.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>"Prometheus" is a Ridley Scott sci-fi action movie, which means it has amazing cinematography and tough heroines. If you are looking for them, you will not be disappointed. But how about the story? Please don't expect an intelligent and intricate screenplay here because "Prometheus," an indirect prequel to the "Alien" franchise, is a typical case of Hollywood blockbuster full of sound and fury, a visual extravaganza with so many big plot holes.<br /><br />Set in 2093, an expedition team of scientists and experts including an archaeologist Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) is sent on a mission to the moon LV-223. This is a trillion-dollar project financed by the Weyland Corporation (the CEO Peter Weyland is played by a nearly unrecognizable Guy Pearce), to discover the "Engineers" and secrets about the origin of the humans.<br /><br />The film starts promisingly, benefitting the veteran director's assured control of scenes, but as the story of "Prometheus" (script penned by Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindelof) unfolds, you may have a very strong feeling of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu. While the film's main theme is very ambitious, each set-piece looks as if borrowed from some other sci-fi films including Ridley Scott's own works.<br /><br />Michael Fassbender plays an android David. Though Fassbender as always delivers a solid performance, the android's decision making is random and sometimes unaccountable. The way he speaks reminds us of HAL9000, but Fassbender's character behaves more illogically than the computer of "2001: A Space Odyssey." In fact, there are so many illogical motives and implausible situations in "Prometheus," where characters almost always end up doing things in a wrong way.<br /><br />Had "Prometheus" been directed by someone other than Ridley Scott, what would the film have been like? A terrible mess of a grade-B sci-fi movie, perhaps. "Prometheus" is a gorgeous-looking and action-packed sci-fi film, of which poor storyline is barely covered by the special effects.</p></br><a href="../users/ANOAF9M5MTJHN.html">ANOAF9M5MTJHN</a><br/><p>this is over all a four star movie as good entertainement but for the science  or physics or reality is not true  to fact . first in seventy five year world will not be traveling in space like this movie say more like five hundred years from now . and why is the bad the blondes now in movies . while the darkys are the heros oh  i see more darky in usa now .</p></br><a href="../users/A18GP1PWVTKXQQ.html">A18GP1PWVTKXQQ</a><br/><p>***This review may contain spoilers***<br /><br />No matter how much he and his fellow scenarists deny it, Ridley Scott's 'Prometheus' is very much a souped-up update of Scott's 'classic' 1979 sci-fi horror show, 'Alien'. The film begins with a cryptic scene set during pre-historic times when a space traveler (who looks like a muscle-bound 'Mr. Clean' with pasty skin) drinks a dark liquid concoction that causes him to disintegrate. We find out later, that quite incredibly, the traveler's disintegration causes a biogenetic chain reaction, which is responsible for the origin of life on earth.<br /><br />Cut to 2089. Archaeologist couple, Elizabeth Shaw and Charlie Holloway, make a new discovery of an ancient cave drawing that's similar to other cave drawings already discovered, pointing to a distant moon where Mr. Clean might have come from (these humanoids are dubbed 'Engineers'). Cut to the Prometheus, a giant spaceship financed by multi-billionaire Peter Weyland, CEO of the Weyland Corporation. Weyland is played by Guy Pearce, made up to look like a senior on his last legs (despite a ton of prosthetics, the make-up department ends up managing to turn Weyland into a clone of Biff Tanner from 'Back to the Future, Part 2').<br /><br />Weyland gives the Prometheus crew a pep talk after they wake up from suspended animation, except he's a hologram. We're told by Vickers (Charlize Theron) that Weyland had a few weeks to live before the Prometheus took off but it turns out that he's been in stasis in private quarters, off limits to the rest of the crew. Weyland can't accept the idea that he's soon going to kick the bucket and hopes that the Engineers will restore his youth. Boy is he in for a big surprise!<br /><br />Before the ship arrives at its destination, David the Android house sits while crew members sleep in their pea pods. David, designed by Weyland, has a mind of his own and a nice British accent to boot. He keeps himself busy before the crew wakes up by studying thousands of obscure languages and watching old movies. For some reason, David doesn't seem to be programmed to obey orders and ends up digging around for clues by himself once the crew lands on the moon.<br /><br />Despite all the neat special effects, 'Prometheus' is saddled with one clich&eacute;d character after another. Holloway, the archaeologist leader, is the skeptical scientist who's contrasted with his lover Shaw, the 'believer', who is still bent on finding out the 'meaning of life' at film's end. Holloway is virtual cannon fodder after David infects him with the dark liquid seen earlier. Holloway proves to be thoroughly expendable when he becomes a virtual Zombie and Vickers must torch him to death with a flamethrower, to prevent him from getting back on the ship. Theron's Vickers, who turns out to be Weyland's daughter, has no interest in alien first contact and is a most unlikeable, one dimensional villain. Like Holloway, she's easily disposed of when she's crushed by the Engineer's disabled ship, during the denouement.<br /><br />The bulk of the action takes inside a giant cave which turns out to be the Engineer's spaceship. Crew members Milburn and Fifield, decide to run back to the Prometheus after they're spooked by all the bad vibes inside the cave. As there is no discipline amongst the crew members, they're allowed to abandon their colleagues and promptly end up getting lost. Of course they're the first ones to be dispatched by the alien monsters, squid like creatures completely reminiscent of Scott's '79 'frightfest'.<br /><br />Scott must have reasoned that audiences today still want a taste of that old 'Alien' magic, so Milburn and Fifields' demise must go the usual route of having the creature's tentacles reach inside the victims' bodies (through the mouth) and then having them subsequently disemboweled from the 'inside out'. But wait! Scott must up the 'ante' and he does so by having Shaw impregnated by an infected Holloway. Since she's now got an alien embryo in her belly, she's informed by David that she's now three months pregnant after one day! Not to worry! Set your self-service 2093 surgery machine on automatic pilot and let the device remove the nasty creature for you. Just make sure you give yourself enough shots of morphine, or whatever pain-killer does the trick!<br /><br />It turns out that David has discovered that one of the Engineers is still alive, inside one of those pea pods inside the cave. When they wake him up, the crew members who went back into cave (including Weyland), have to deal with the humanoid's 'anger management' problem, which they didn't count on. Everyone is killed and David gets his head ripped off (don't worry, he's somehow still able to think, talk and communicate!).<br /><br />It's not enough for the director to channel 'Alien' but why not a dose of 'Alien vs. Predator' while you're at it? That's essentially happens when the surviving bad-guy Engineer takes on the giant squid-like Alien, in a fight to the death struggle. Guess who wins?<br /><br />Leave it to Shaw (the aforementioned true believer), to want to go off to distant places, in an attempt to extract an explanation from the Engineers, who seemingly gave humans life but then changed their minds. As Shaw jets off with the help of David, one wonders why Shaw seems to ignore all the unpleasantness associated with her first encounter with the surviving Engineer. Is there any reason why she wouldn't get her head ripped off, during a second encounter with these baddies?<br /><br />If you're going to see 'Prometheus', it's for the special effects and not the characters. There's actually some neat visuals in this film, including a wondrous sandstorm and a star map highlighting Earth. But in the end, most of this stuff we've seen before. One thing I did learn from 'Promethesus' is that inside every giant squid-like alien, is one hell of an adorable gargoyle calling the shots!</p></br><a href="../users/A2TLLX0ZBMZTK7.html">A2TLLX0ZBMZTK7</a><br/><p>Eh, I thought Prometheus was only okay. Decent. Not great or anything. I had a hard time getting into the story, and I thought the majority of characters could have been better. I didn't feel a whole lot of suspense throughout the movie either, but there were some parts that may seem gory and intense to some. I didn't care for the android character, felt too much like something I'd seen in Alien. And the ending was way too much like Alien, I won't spoil how or anything though.

In punishment God chained him to a rock and bade an eagle perpetually eat his liver.<br /><br />In Ridley Scott's new film we open with sweeping aerial shots over a steaming, blasted landscape that may be Icelandic and may be Martian. We alight on a waxen figure of titanic Grecian aspect, standing astride a great waterfall, who may be Prometheus himself, "chained" to his "rock". Overhead, a higher power is concluding a visit. It does not appear to have been a cordial one.<br /><br />I do not know this for sure, and Scott does not explain further. That mysteries are more potent unexploded is a significant theme of this motion picture.<br /><br />We are pitched forward 35 millennia, to 2093, and into the face of Dr Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace), an anthropologist out in the field, clawing at an aperture into a concealed cavern with cavalier disregard for that theme. Dr Shaw and her partner Dr Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green) have discovered cave paintings suggestive of the intervention of an advanced civilisation. This is, of course, the stuff of Erich von D&auml;niken, fashionable as long ago as the 1970s but long since discredited. Nonetheless, Shaw and Holloway propose a multi-billion dollar, ten year expedition to a remote star system to further investigate. Elderly philanthropist Weyland (a rubber-suited Guy Pierce) green-lights the proposal.<br /><br />It must have been one hell of a business pitch.<br /><br />We jump forward a further four years and 50 billion light years (the laws of physics being due an overhaul between now and 2090) to the spaceship Prometheus, which has arrived at that star system. Without ado the ship fetches up on a blasted, steaming landscape, adjacent to a quite <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0425166805">von D&auml;nikenesque</a> archaeological complex.<br /><br />House android David (an excellently Hal-like Michael Fassbinder) and ship commander Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron) are busily waking up their scientists and nursing hidden agendas. It quickly becomes clear that the crew of scientists, shaken from their stupor, have their own agendas too. Thus do we conform to the deep space adventure playbook established by the likes of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HEBCZQ">2001: A Space Odyssey</a> and, well, Alien. Yet note a dissonance here: just as the dialogue starts in earnest, Scott shifts our gaze from the reverend contemplation of the immortal to the petty melodramas of some new characters with whom we cannot, yet, empathise. Naturally there are figurative parallels but, all the same, this shift in perspective risks rendering the cosmic mundane.<br /><br />I mention this because but for the wonderful production design and those grand metaphysical thoughts there is really nothing really new about the first hour of Prometheus. It is to Alien what <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HF4U04">2010: The Year We Make Contact</a> was to 2001. In place of ineffable profundity there is talky exposition.<br /><br />Ridley Scott renders the cosmic mundane in another way too: We are treated again to HR Giger's stunning necro-organic architecture, rendered briefly in Alien and largely unexplained in the form of a ghastly skeleton with a blown out rib-cage. But this time Scott indulges in exposition: he begins to fill in the details of this race of &Uuml;bermensch, ascribing them motives and agendas. We even meet one. It was better not knowing.<br /><br />In Alien the titillating ambiguity of their remnants left the job of world construction to the viewer. In Prometheus Scott takes away the viewer's autonomy, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00498VS1E">Alien</a> dictates a back story, and opens himself wide to plot illogicalities and non-sequiturs. Disappointingly the Engineers' motivations are base, predictable, and not worthy of the phallic grandeur of Giger's production design.<br /><br />By half time in this two hour picture the studied monkishness of its opening has entirely given way to melodramatic space opera, rendered in haphazardly-directed action set pieces. As convention dictates, the dysfunctional crew must be picked off, but this is accompanied by none of the grimness of Scott's original, because the characters are only caricatures of the real men and women we met aboard the Nostromo.<br /><br />There are, generally, too many of them, and they spend too much of the picture gabbing at each other in the meter of stock Hollywood dialogue, depriving the screenplay of the air it needs to work up a genuine chill or to properly frame its grand eternal cogitations.  There are about three false summits before the final denouement, which falls on an offbeat not quite accented enough to justify its build up.<br /><br />This makes me sound too negative: I enjoyed Prometheus a great deal, but hoped to enjoy it immensely more still. It is a beautiful picture to look at, and many of the action set pieces are well executed (Noomi Rapace has her own John Hurt moment, self-inflicted, and it is in equal parts horrifying and (deliberately) hilarious.<br /><br />Ridley Scott has famously railed against studio demands to tinker with the final edits of his pictures. Here, I suspect he had full autonomy. I left the cinema wondering what might have been had someone been more assiduous in that regard: this is a good movie which could have been made great had there been a director more prepared to cut.<br /><br />Olly Buxton</p></br><a href="../users/A1OS2HX2CWQIC7.html">A1OS2HX2CWQIC7</a><br/><p>Exiting a screening of Ridley Scott's ludicrous, inexplicably acclaimed sword-and-sandal epic twelve years ago, I vowed never again to pay for the trial of enduring one of his movies. Both then and now, most entries of Scott's filmography following his first three miraculous features are at best underwhelming. Though he's never demeaned himself by defecating Baysian action tripe as his sibling Tony does so often, Scott has turned out an appalling abundance of fatuous genre pictures: derivative, bloodless crime dramas (Someone to Watch Over Me, Black Rain, American Gangster, Body of Lies); obnoxious, misguided feminist concessions (Thelma & Louise, G.I. Jane); visually sumptuous yet dramatically empty and woefully inaccurate period adventures (1492: Conquest of Paradise, the aforementioned Gladiator, Kingdom of Heaven, Robin Hood); worse of all, a pair of clumsy, painfully unfunny comedies (Matchstick Men, the abominable A Good Year). However, Scott's two early works of science fiction cinema are not merely among the finest of that genre and deserving of their tremendous popularity, but also admirable assays of filmic horror and crime. What's more, the veteran director's stewardship of these classics is quite the opposite of George Lucas' bungled Star Wars revisions: his director's cuts of Alien and Blade Runner are exemplary, seamlessly incorporating previously cut footage that augmented both films' subtext and impact while removing objectionable elements. Better still, neither were intended as replacements for their theatrical antecedents.<br /><br />Scott's shrinking yet devoted fanbase has defended the aging filmmaker for decades; when engaging one of his fans in argument, one can always concede that an oeuvre of three great works and at least fifteen resounding artistic failures yields not so bad a ratio by current standards. Considering this substandard output in addition to to two abysmal latter Alien sequels (Joss Whedon being at least so responsible as Jean-Pierre Jeunet for the abject idiocy of the last, despite his inarticulate falsehoods otherwise), can a divergent precursor of the venerated first picture generate sufficient interest among its enthusiasts? On the strengths of the Alien director's cut and promise of some notable assembled talent, this reviewer revoked an oath of a decade and two years prior, and justifiably so. By its faults, Prometheus is denied indisputable grandeur, yet its colossal proportions, magnificent conceptual scope and assiduous realization may well instill some awe in even the most jaded cineast.<br /><br />In rural Scotland of 2089, a pair of archaeologists (Noomi Rapace, Logan Marshall-Green) discover a peculiar cave drawing depicting a star map identical to others unearthed at numerous locales across the planet. Having identified a location specified in these ancient illustrations, they embark on a journey of two years to a small, distant moon courtesy of the superannuated CEO (Guy Pierce, nigh-unrecognizable beneath elaborate makeup) of a massive corporation (Weyland, precedent of notorious, interstellar, terraforming conglomerate Weyland-Yutani). Under the inflexible authority of a frigid mission director (Charlize Theron), the crew of spacecraft Prometheus (so christened to reflect its mission's exploratory ambitions) is comprised of its captain (Idris Elba), two pilots (Emun Elliott and Benedict Wong), a medical officer (Kate Dickey), a biologist (Rafe Spall) and geologist (Sean Harris), and the aforementioned archaeological pioneers. Secrets extracted upon and within the planetoid provide unimpeachable evidence of mankind's origins, exceeding expectations and dashing hopes of benevolent higher intelligence elsewhere in the galaxy.<br /><br />None of Prometheus' philosophical themes or physiological implications are reconciled or addressed satisfactorily - a limitation that both compliments and impairs its audacious narrative. Those seeking an exposition concerning the species of Alien's space jockey will undoubtedly be wholly satisfied. Perhaps the movie's best aspect is a retention of mystery: to provoke its viewers' imaginations, it presents at least so many questions as answers. Readers of Lovecraft will hardly find its otherworldly enigmas and adventuresome dread especially novel; At the Mountains of Madness and Dune are perhaps its most cognate literary equivalents and influences, from which screenwriters Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindelof owe a heavy debt to Lovecraft and Herbert for their historied fantasies of alien ecology, biology, technology and culture traced from inception to apex to ruination.<br /><br />If Scott has demonstrated any expertise, it is indisputably that of a filmmaker whose fabricated worlds are conferred the most exquisite detail and immersing quality. A skilled illustrator, he draws nearly all of his own storyboards and has interacted successfully with no small number of design and effects luminaries. Here, the photography of Dariusz Wolski (likely the most unremarkable competent DP of his field) is typically faultless and drab, but he was wisely chosen - his invariably muted hues complement this story's foreboding ambiance and environments. However, Arthur Max's production design and the efforts of the extensive art and effects departments bore terrific fruit. Prometheus boasts enormous, spectacular sets, most of which are visually astonishing and entirely credible. Although the titular vessel features many design elements first seen in its utilitarian successor Nostromo as designed by Jean Giraud, Chris Foss, and Ron Cobb, its more advanced navigational interfaces and investigative apparatuses may be attributed to its specialized purpose - one hardly considered by the crew of a cargo tug! The extraterrestrial interiors are gargantuan, redolent of millennial inertia, supreme advancement and unimaginable peril. Most wondrous of the many discoveries therein is the activation of an elaborate, projected galactic orrery of three dimensions, as beautiful as suggestive of boundless purpose. Original creatures designed by Conor O'Sullivan, Carlos Huante and Neal Scanlan under Max's supervision are hardly so innovative as those of H.R. Giger (which are featured throughout), but nonetheless intelligently conceived and appropriately gruesome. Janty Yates' attractive, lithe spacesuits grant the cast comfortable mobility, but introduce at least one question of continuity: why were those of the Nostromo's crew so cumbersome?<br />Should this production be faulted, blame must be assigned to its aural elements. Marc Streitenfeld's score is lush, lovely and not at all intrinsically obtrusive, cleverly quoting Jerry Goldsmith's classic Alien score at least once...but it's overused in almost every scene by Scott, who's apparently forgotten the provocative effect of silence so efficaciously exploited in his great first few flicks. Worse, the sound design is evocative but too prominent - chewing, vomiting, squirming, slithering, pounding noises are both too loud and prevalent, and silly besides.<br /><br />While I can readily accept Ridley Scott as a movie maker who routinely cultivates visual splendor, I cannot assent to the absurd notion that he is or has ever been an actor's director. Few directors of any credibility have coaxed so many awful performances from so many actors, many of whom were otherwise reputable. At the early peak of his powers, Scott wisely afforded the best performers available to him (Keitel, Weaver, Hurt, Hauer, et al.) carte blanche with fantastic results. Were he still so inclined, and more great Anglophone actors available to him, Prometheus wouldn't be burdened by so much overacting. If Rapace imparts no great depth to her role, her histrionics in two scenes of harrowing suspense do distinguish an otherwise unexceptional adequacy. Unfortunately, her partner in excavation and romance as portrayed by Marshall-Green is too vulgar to receive seriously, which leads one to ask why he and his interdisciplinary male colleagues comport themselves like frat boys rather than scientists. Worst of this lot is hammy Sean Harris, as angst-ridden as a teen following the confiscation of his iPod and bedecked with red mohawk and facial tattoos. No geologist known to me appears or postures so, and if Scott, Spaihts and Lindelof deem this a legitimate means to bestow personality to their cast, they've descended to Roland Emmerich's low standards. Despite some rather stupid dialogue assigned her that she delivers well, Theron is convincingly malefic as the mission's authoritarian ice queen, and certainly more memorable than the remainder of the ship's crew. I'm not yet entirely convinced that Michael Fassbender is the savior of the western world in light of its contemporary dearth of great screen thespians, only because my exposure to his potent talent is limited to two very fine Steve McQueen offerings. In this franchise, his performance is second only to that of Ian Holm's as requisite android of the mission, and every bit so nuanced. Fassbender's cunning, unfailingly polite robot is cool (never stiff) in imitation of human behavior (especially Peter O'Toole's Lawrence), and subtly expressive of amusement, offense borne and an understated hint of contempt. Perhaps the script's greatest profundity can be evinced in the contrast of Fassbender's relationship with his creators to they with theirs.<br /><br />Despite its flaws, Prometheus provides its viewers a fine, richly mounted cinematic undertaking commendable for its prodigious sights, stimulating exploration of eternal themes and at least a couple of very good performances. It is unnervingly suspenseful, if very seldom frightening. Possibly its very worst failure is a shift from morbid fascination to contrived heroics during its final twenty minutes, in which plot holes abound. In lieu of an ominous, ambiguous denouement, Scott cheaply spoon-feeds his audience selfless victory by explosion and closure suggesting the possibility of a sequel.<br /><br />Lovecraft's intrepid characters guided his readers to worlds both known and enigmatic, witness to outlandish auspice and atrocity. Those most fortunate among them were left traumatized, while his hapless were devoured by either what they sought or far worse beyond. By confronting the cosmic unknown of a titanic scale, Scott aspired to create a legend; in suggesting that humanity may intervene meaningfully in its affairs, he fell far short.<br /><br />Perhaps it ought have been titled Icarus.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q4XAQXKKV6V.html">A3Q4XAQXKKV6V</a><br/><p>Hard to believe this movie is so revered. It's been done. In fact it's a checklist of pretty much every scifi movie ever made...the entire run of this was so nostalgic, from bringing an alien specimen on board (which is always a bad idea, and has a predictable outcome) to the indispensable robot who in the end is the one man for the job.. are people really this forgetful? The casting, other than the Bishop/Aliens ripoff were simply not memorable. I didn't identify with or care about ANY of these characters -- even WITH their names plastered unnecessarily on their heads.<br /><br />Spoilers --<br /><br />Lets not even mention the giant continuity problems like the scientist lady who bares some type of octopus formed alien, then the Borg looking "baddie" alien (who shares our EXACT DNA so therefore should produce an identical style alien) bares a -- wait for it -- classic alien model just in time for the credits.<br /><br />I wouldn't necessarily say skip this movie, but you've seen it. It has some impressive visual effects for someone who has never played a modern videogame, but it lacks any sort of soul and the script could definitely use a strong central character..but I suppose when you've cast 9 unlikeable actors - who would you choose?<br /><br />PS - couldn't they find an OLDER actor to play the part of the old man? The "old guy" visuals looked really poor..and they kept out someone who possibly could have made this film seemed a little more grounded.<br /><br />''Hi---- I'm REALLY OLD. I want to find an alien species because they MUST KNOW how to stop aging -- even though I have no proof they know anything of the kind.. if they even exist AT ALL."<br /><br />''HI, I'm hot and blonde and my dad is 75 years older than I am."<br /><br />did anyone watch the movie -- or just the holographic pretty lights?<br /><br />"Hi, I signed up for a mission I didn't know didn't allow guns -- apparently we never discussed the parameters of the mission."</p></br><a href="../users/A319SKSB556033.html">A319SKSB556033</a><br/><p>Spoilers thar be, Maytees.<br /><br />Is a man created by man still a creature of God or is it a monster? Do we have the right to create meta-human life? What if we are the children of unknown fathers? For answers please consult Frankenstein. For self-important, barely comprehensible drivel please consult Prometheus.<br /><br />Great direction can save poor scripts. A director seduced by CGI shooting an incredibly weak screenplay by an overrated pair of writers will not. How on Earth Lindelof and Spaihts got the gig is beyond me. There are strong writers in Hollywood and others trying to get a break that could have done a better job, a MUCH better job.<br /><br />Ridley Scott, like Spielberg, has forgotten what making a raw, honest movie is like and is far too distracted with how excessive CGI can make it look pretty. Alien was a dark, cold, spartan film set in a bleak, merciless universe. The budget and effects limitations at the time meant that Scott had to use his imagination to create dread. Here he has all the money and effects he can ask for and the resulting film is the polar opposite. Less is more. A filmmaker like Scott should know that. All 4 Alien movies were filmed on a soundstage (save for one 'beach' shot in Alien 3). They were confined and claustrophobic. Prometheus is set in massive, wide-open spaces, which I assume is supposed to make us feel desolate and isolated. But when it cuts back and forth between interior and exterior so much the opposites negate each other, meaning we feel neither confined nor abandoned.<br /><br />The story is set a number of years before Alien in which a bunch of expendable characters (including a lot of nobodies) travel to a distant planet (a 4-year round trip) to find the beings that created life on Earth. When they get there they discover...a load of confusing, muddled nonsense that is far from frightening and is only just barely above mildly interesting.<br /><br />Alien was populated with 7 single or double-syllabled characters that felt real and authentic thanks to their quiet interactions and dialogue. We learned their names and positions quickly. Prometheus has more characters than I can count (some appear out of nowhere and quickly disappear as fast) with some of them not even being coherently named. Not that coherence is this film's strong point.<br /><br />Noomi Rapace is cute as Elizabeth Shaw, the lead scientist who believes in 'The Creators' (the Space Jockey creatures), but she's very miscast. Michael Fassbender as android David is the only other character who gets a notable amount of screen time. You'll care about none of them.<br /><br />Scott once said that the film wasn't a prequel to Alien (after originally announcing that it was) then changed his mind a short while later. If this was supposed to keep us intrigued it didn't work. If anything it only got the confusion going before anyone even saw the movie.<br /><br />It has some lofty ambitions, and succeeds at neither of them. The opening scene of a Creator sacrificing himself at an indefinite point in history to create mankind by putting his DNA into our water is nonsense. Was disintegrating himself the only way of doing this? Could he not have just bled into the primordial soup? Did he create the dinosaurs too? Was it a scene set just after the last ice age? Did they accidentally create primates in the process? Why did they create us in the first place? How did the early civilizations learn of the Creators? Did they visit? Why did they have a star map that led to a planet that was just a testing field?<br /><br />The creation of the famous Xenomorph Alien is so convoluted and preposterous. Let's see if you can follow this:<br /><br />Android David finds a vase of goo in the pyramid/mountain place. He touches it to his finger. He deliberately puts his finger into Holloway's champagne, infecting him as he ingests. Holloway gets sick. Before the symptoms become obvious he mates with his infertile lover Elizabeth. She becomes pregnant and quickly goes into labor. She aborts her 'hell baby' by caesarian section but just leaves it there in the operation room. Some time later the angry Creator is attacked by the full grown hell baby and is consumed by it, to a degree, for unknown reasons. That dead Creator then births a primitive Xenomorph.<br /><br />Pardon me, but that is a load of garbage. I honestly cannot believe something that ludicrous made its way into, what is essentially, an Alien movie. The original had so much purity and mythos. Did Ridley Scott not even watch his own movie for pointers? Lindelof and Spaihts have really painted themselves into a corner with that dumb ending too. When Shaw gets to the real Creator planet she will be the only human being in the film, if that is the way the speculative sequel will go.<br /><br />The mystery of the Space Jockey has been completely ruined. It could have been so much better. But Scott needs to be brought back down to Earth (pun intended) and he should have chosen his writing team more wisely. Still, it was nice to hear Jerry Goldsmith's Alien theme, albeit briefly.</p></br><a href="../users/A15Q9YEG1XPEJN.html">A15Q9YEG1XPEJN</a><br/><p>Take a top notch director, several Academy Award winning actors, a script from the discard bin at the SyFy channel and a couple hundred million dollars - and this is what you get.<br /><br />THIS MOVIE DOESN'T MAKE SENSE!<br /><br />There is no logical motivation for the basis of the storyline.  It's all a bunch of nonsense that provides no purpose.<br /><br />The previews of this film with its horrifying soundtrack made this film look like the must-see film of the year! Too bad the previews were the best thing about this film.<br /><br />Oh I can see where the money was spent - it's a big involved production and they've got some really great talent wondering what the heck they're doing in this lousy film.  I'm sure the producers had to pay the actors more when the actors realized what a horrible film this was.<br /><br />Why is Charlize Theron - arguably one of the most beautiful women in the world - and an incredible actress - ....why is she only delivering a flat "angry" performance? No range. Terrible.<br /><br />Guy Pearce - why bother hiring this fine actor if you're going to cover him up in some of the poorest old age make-up I've seen this side of a high school play?  He's completely wasted - but then so is the whole storyline involving him.<br /><br />Is there any reason that "humanoid" beings populated the Earth and finding them so Pearce's character can find immortality?<br /><br />The plot line is paper thin and very juvenile compared to the original Alien and its first sequel Aliens. The characters are so poorly drawn that you really don't care whether anyone lives or dies.  When they do start dying, I began rooting for the aliens because the humans were all so pathetic and uninteresting.<br /><br />If we don't know who these humanoid beings are, then why in the "universe" would we assume that they can grant immortality?

It's very pretty looking<br />2. It's better than the Phantom Menace<br /><br />Seriously. People keep comparing this to The Phantom Menace, and that's so unfair. It's easily better. For one it's prettier and there's some nice creepy characters. But ultimately, Prometheus is a movie so bad that I can only recommend it to people the same way I recommend The Phantom Menace: not at all.<br /><br />Before people tell me I didn't get this movie or I didn't grow up in the time the Alien was released: I actually grew up with these movies in my video collection. I like Alien, Aliens and Alien 3, but Alien Ressurection disappointed me greatly. And let's not even get started on those horrid Alien Vs. Predator movies- those movies are just plain insulting to both franchises. And sadly, so is Prometheus. Oh, and I got it just perfectly. It's too bad the film is just a steaming pile of crap, though.<br /><br />One thing I could imagine was that Ridley must have overheard his 5 year old grandson telling a friend a story when coming up with the idea for the film. Seriously. "And then a robot can see people's memories, and then they go to a planet, and there's a cave with all these coccoons, and then they find a head, then they bring it back to their ship, then they revive it, then it explodes, and then the robot puts alien blood in a guy's drink, and then the woman scientist has a baby in her tummy, and then she removes it from her stomach but it's not really a baby but an alien and then the guy turns into an alien, then they go to a cave, and then they meet a bald guy, and then the robot gets his head torn off, then the woman goes back to the ship, and then the alien from her tummy didn't die there and fights the bald guy that followed her..." seriously. As Peter Griffin says, "There, I just saved you two long and boobless hours!"<br /><br />In addition to such a ludicrous plot, There's also hideously bad acting- I typically love Noomi Rapace but she was abysmal. Not her fault, she is a Swede, so why make her a Brit? Charlize was just boring to watch and spoke all her lines in a similar fashion to Kristen Stewart. Shaw's boyfriend was bad too, and the only good performance was from Michael Fassbender. I felt sorry for him, watching him be the one good actor in a film riddled with bad performances.<br /><br />Then there's the dialogue. Dear lord. I swear for 10 minutes the dialogue consided of "Prometheus are you seeing this? Prometheus did you catch the image I just saw? Prometheus are you still following us?" I swear if I heard the word "Prometheus" one more time I was going to walk out of the cinema. And that horrid "I am your father" moment... UGH.<br /><br />Just avoid this film at all cost. It will ruin everything you love about the Alien movies.</p></br><a href="../users/AQUVTQFFXP4AC.html">AQUVTQFFXP4AC</a><br/><p>I think the movie's near-hysterical marketing campaign did it in more than any number of flaws and acting problems in the movie itself.  Being billed as somehow the next generation of movie-making, an epic so incredible and so beyond the medium of cinema itself, with a plot supposedly so spellbinding and powerful that it has to be kept secret until the screenings.<br /><br />And I can safely say there was almost nothing original, colossal, or paradigm-shifting in this entire movie.<br /><br />The plot is basically the next step to the Ancient Alien craze brought on by the crazies on "Ancient Aliens" on History Channel (IF ALIENS DIDN'T EXiST, HOW DID THEY BUILD EVERYTHING?!  I DON'T KNOW, THEREFORE ALIENS), by having someone rich and stupid enough front a trillion dollars for a deep space vessel to follow up on what they think to be a starmap in the form of pictographic carvings found all over the earth from far-flung, disconnected civilizations all portraying the same set of circles in the sky.<br /><br />Leaving side the obvious conjecture that maybe they all saw the same cosmic event or series of meteors rather than assuming it's somehow alien-related, the fact that this starmap leads where it does makes it a gaping plot hole, considering that the location the go to is one where the aliens clearly would never want us to ever find if we did manage to reach the technological level to find it and go to it.  Add to that the fact that it's a trillion dollar mission that could have ended up leading to nowhere if my hypothesis that it wasn't aliens was correct.<br /><br />There are no real "characters" to this story; they're little more than cardboard cut-outs with their personalities etched in their faces and speech.  Archetypes largely consisting of people with no discernable purpose beyond dying and being "sciencey".  Their only role in this movie is as "Meat 1", "Meat 2" and so on.<br /><br />Considering this is a TRILLION DOLLAR MISSION trying to find THE FIRST ABSOLUTE EVIDENCE OF LIFE OUTSIDE OF EARTH, much less ALIENS WHO CREATED US, this is facepalmingly stupid the cast of cretins they've gathered up for this mission.  I literally thought the random punk guy was some random mercenary hired on for protection, so I was genuinely shocked when they started relying on him being "sciencey" later on in the movie.  The rest of them are stupid enough to make people with even the most basic knowledge of archaeology and biology shake their heads.<br /><br />Considering once again that this is a TRILLION DOLLAR MISSION bent on finding LIVING ALIENS, I honestly thought it was either an inside joke or a jab at the people when they walk into an ancient cavern on the alien planet, unopened in 2000 years, and start TOUCHING everything, stepping everywhere, and SITTING on the artifacts.  There's a reason archaeologists use those tiny little brushes to dust off found artifacts; THEY'RE TRYING TO PRESERVE AND DOCUMENT A SITE; THEY DON'T JUMP INTO A PIT OF BONES AND START KICKING SKULLS AROUND.<br /><br />They also see fit to take off their helmets, just because the air is breathable.  Nevermind the fact that people are strongly urged to immunize just to visit another country for fear of contracting some unknown disease, these people are on a WHOLE OTHER PLANET UNTOUCHED BY HUMANS OR ANY LIFE FORM FOR TWO THOUSAND YEARS.  The TRILLION DOLLAR MISSION could've ended then and there with all of them dying of space-smallpox, and all due to their own stupidity.<br /><br />Pretty much from the moment of their arrival, the movie plays out less as THE STORY OF OUR BEGINNING and more like a typical horror movie.  I had constant instances of deja vu with this movie reminding me of scenes from "Alien vs Predator".  Even the characters had exactly the same tones and reactions as those in AVP.<br /><br />Michael Fassbender is a great actor, but his performance here is terribly uneven, though it seems more to me symptomatic of bad writing than any fault of his own.  His entire opening sequence of him watching Lawrence of Arabia, combing his hair like Peter O'Toole, riding his bike while shooting perfect hoops in basketball, and just walking around maintaining the ship play him up as a bright-eyed innocent, an android fully aware of what he is and giddy to learn more about the world and himself.  Then at random instances, he becomes sarcastic, dry, seemingly malevolent, even snotty, enough to arouse suspicion in a child, much less supposed scientists on a TRILLION DOLLAR MISSION.  He then pulls a temporary heel turn with a little "science" experiment that would be considered crude and reckless by Medieval standards of medicine---people DID practice quarantine back then.<br /><br />I say temporary because as the film progresses some more, this action of his not only proves to be pointless, but is subsequently dropped and ignored for the rest of the film.<br /><br />Then comes the whole moral of the story... I see a lot of positive reviews mentioning that it's okay that the story "doesn't explain" everything, or that it's not the film at fault if you "don't get it".<br /><br />Well I got it.  What I got was grade-school navel gazing hiding its own childishness behind a slick veneer of cool and hip to dismiss any criticism as "You just didn't get it".<br /><br />As much as I trash on "Ancient Aliens" on History Channel, I find the idea of paleolithic contact to be utterly thrilling, only waiting for even the slimmest shred of evidence to justify giving it further exploration.  This movie began with something like that, and close to the end, completely dropped the existential navel-gazing unaddressed to turn to the philosophical quandry of a bawling child wondering "Why is daddy hurting me?"<br /><br />From there, another gaping plothole emerges; the aliens are suddenly hostile towards us, and the humans can't understand why.  They then proceed to make up reasons that completely ignore the facts; we're BAAAAAD people!  We burn fossil fuels!  We don't recycle!  We kill each other!  We eat animals!  We invent big shooty guns and bombs!  We touch ourselves at night!<br /><br />It never gets that specific, but the "Why me?" wailing gets tired, fast, and suddenly I realized I don't care what the aliens wanted.  If they have a problem with us and are unwilling to negotiate, we can just kill them all.  They DID leave their planet full of a self-replicating biological superweapon ABANDONED for two thousand years, and then left us with the starmaps all over our planet!<br /><br />The ending is typical, and would seemingly open the door for sequels, though of the sort that would be close to nothing like this movie, and thoroughly unwanted or uncared about.  Considering they had devised this great plan for the human race, it seems downright nutty of the scientist to STILL want to meet with them and ask them "Why me?"<br /><br />As for visuals, I suppose they were impressive.  I wasn't impressed with them; CGI is cheap, fast, and easy these days.  A dozen movies are churned out with better and better visuals and plots and characters just as bad every year.  Boasting the greatest special effects with no substance to justify them will only make the movie look quaint and silly in 5-10 years when something better is done.<br /><br />I found a slight comparison with this film and "2001: A Space Odyssey" and realized it was literally the exact same basic plot:  Man finds evidence of ancient aliens, invests in a deep space mission to seek out the aliens based on their map, stuff happens, only one survivor and their pet robot.<br /><br />What separates this from "2001" is that "2001" told a story that needed no words; it was the story of us, open to all manner of interpretation, with scientists actually behaving like SCIENTISTS---Poole and Bowman kept their calm when they suspected HAL of lying to them, they casually gathered inside a space pod to discuss it, they didn't freak out and start cursing at each other or playing childish games of pretend with a damn SUPERCOMPUTER thinking they could outsmart a machine designed to read people like a pamphlet.<br /><br />In "Prometheus", they don't let you think, at least not the way you're expected to.  You're not left thinking about our beginnings, or the ancient alien concept, so much as wondering the same dumb question of "Why us?".  In fact, when we saw the movie, the only thing we kept wondering about is exactly what the alien at the prologue did and whether he knew what was happening.  I don't think that is what the filmmakers wanted.</p></br><a href="../users/A2W00XKTTF1G0Z.html">A2W00XKTTF1G0Z</a><br/><p>MOVIE REVIEW #37: " Prometheus "<br /><br />Director and Producer Ridley Scott (Gladiator, Blade Runner) is back and unfortunately (or apparently) he didn't read this script very closely. I am a big fan of ALL of Ridley Scott's projects and even his weakest films (1942, Kingdom of Heaven) have had something of value in them in regards either their characters or story - but Prometheus - wow...I was a severe disappointment.<br /><br />Let me tell you what's good about it - It does have two really great performances by the creepy and mysterious Android David played amazingly and hauntingly by Michael Fassbinder (300, X-Men First Class) - and - the spaceships main scientist (Elizabeth Shaw) played by intensely and passionately by Noomi Rapace (Sherlock Holmes: Game of Shadows, The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo). These were some of the most dramatic highlights/scenes of the film.<br /><br />The story written by first time writer John Spaihts and Damon Lindeloff -(Cowboys & Aliens, Lost) - takes a giant leap from the original Alien four films and is trying to be a prequel to the entire franchise. The story is full of holes, the logistics of some of the action had the audience rolling their eyes in `you gotta be kidding' style. The theatrical trailer made me excited and eager to see this film - coupled with the fact it was directed by the `former' master of modern-day suspense Ridley Scott.  I was so disappointed. Yes it has Aliens - different in style, face-huggers that now look like octopuses and the incubation process is completely different - involving worms in the eyeballs! Need I say more?<br /><br />The Prometheus crew is assigned on a two-year long term mission to investigate a serious of pictographs found in various Earth cultures over centuries of time which leads them to the race of super tall beings (great CG effects here) that actually `seeded' Earth millennium's ago. Turns out - they - made a mistake - we don't know why - but apparently they create a biological weapon (i.e. the Aliens) to destroy their mistakes all over the universe - apparently.<br /><br />The special effects, the score by Marc Steitenfeld  (Gladiator, Black Hawk Down) and the cinematography by Dariusz Wolski (Pirates of the Caribbean, Sweeny Todd) are state-of-the-art, extremely realistic, very enchanting and incredibly imaginative. Using the production design that reminded my of the first two Alien films in a more cleaner and sleeker design. But this film lacked the story, realistic actions and the heart that the first two Alien films had and it was extremely unbelievable to me.<br /><br />Charlize Theron as the daughter of the mission financier (Snow White and the Huntsmen, Monster), Idris Elba as the Captain of the Prometheus (Thor, 28 Weeks Later) and a mission specialist Logan Marshal-Green (Across the Universe, Devil) all gave some not-so-impressive performances that made me appreciate the Android David (Fassbinder) and the Chief Scientist Elizabeth Shaw (Rapace) that much more.<br /><br />I wish it was better. I was hoping it would have been better. But this is a direct to video/DVD or Netflix film. Not worth $12 to $16! Not a lot of substance. Just a lot of special effects!</p></br><a href="../users/AHL35XZ3OND2Z.html">AHL35XZ3OND2Z</a><br/><p>More is definitely less.<br /><br />"Did you ever see the movie 2010?" Stanley Kubrick once asked a resident screenwriter.  "They ruined it. They explained everything."  There's an old maxim in creative writing.  Never TELL your audience - SHOW them.  That maxim has been both ignored and abused in the case of Prometheus. The filmmakers show you too much and explain just about everything too.  Director Ridley Scott's return to the Alien universe is mostly non-triumphant.  On revisiting a flame he he first ignited in 1979, one done with a great minimalist and atmospheric effect, Scott has betrayed his success by employing a genuinely odd and disjointed script, perfunctory direction and an endless hall of monster's closet scares.  Ridley is much better than this.  In fact, I'm hard pressed to find if he's ever been worse.  If you don't want to read the rest of the review, I'll cut to the chase right here.  You ever see the recent prequel of The Thing?  It was good, not great, but good.  Well Prometheus is pretty much the exact same movie, but much much stupider and no where near as absorbing.<br /><br />Prometheus is a concept film, wrapped in leftover sets and costumes from Avatar and spiced with Creature from the Black Lagoon.  Despite how hard the movie  tells the audience what we are watching is an Alien "prequel," (or by the end he's trying to tell us its a prequel to a prequel), I'm hard pressed to find any substantive in execution to connect Pormetheus Alien, Aliens or even the jumbled Alien3.  Those films were at best, riveting.  At worst, in the case of Alien 3, boring.  I will stop there with comparisons because all that followed Fincher's mess really don't bother mention and I believe this one could fall into that category.  Aliens vs Predator may even have a better script..<br /><br />I know right?<br /><br />Exposition is at a premium here but development is scarce.  From the first scenes, mystery is left to the dogs and before we can immerse ourselves in the unknown, voluble lectures of the plot yet to unfold are given ad nauseum. Prometheus is essentially two films.  One is a concept of human origin, the other, and the majority in general, is an endless series of monster's closets.  Just when things settle down and it feels as if we could be watching an actual science fiction movie, the jumpy music cues, gooey scares and terrible dialog set in.  Then there's the other half.  A nebulous origin story - one that could be interesting - is buried under rubber chicken on the string gags.  Oh but there are mysteries.  Why do they keep taking the helmets off?  Why bother having them at all?  Why did nobody ask Liz about her quickie operation and that nasty "leftover?"  That's just the short end of it.  How can we trace our DNA to these tall aryans?  Then what the heck were the Neatherthals and all the other humans we share nearly identical DNA with? The script displays the trademark ravenous touch for dead ends of writer Damon Lindeloff, one of the head writers of TV's LOST.  He should stick to television or perhaps working the McDonalds drive up, or would he screw that up too?  Deus ex machina is at a premium, character exchanges are laughable, scenes pace with the tempo of a video game commercial and I still can't count how many endings the movie had.  That last "reveal"  was certainly a laugh, because a lot of the people in the theater found it funny.<br /><br />But it's not all bad.  Noomi Rapace is a decent match for Sigourney Weaver and proves yet again, even in the face of a terrible script, she will pull off anything handed to her.  Just like in the superior Swedish Dragon Tattoo film, her unwavering commitment to her character shores up a meager story and holds us to the end.  Michael Fassbender too gives a noteworthy play as the android and gives Lance Henrickson's turn in the same boots a run for his money.  I don't know what Charlize Theron and Guy Pierce were doing here but she and everybody else are simply cashing a paycheck.<br /><br />Where did humans come from?  I don't know but the mystery of who bankrolled a script this bad is a conundrum worth solving.  It is pretty obvious why Ripley never wanted people to know where the Aliens came from.  She saw Prometheus and knew it sucked.  Ripley warned us and tried to save us, but we had to ask.  Now we know Ripley, now we know.</p></br><a href="../users/ANAYSRE3LX8GZ.html">ANAYSRE3LX8GZ</a><br/><p>Well, as you should have gathered by now, this a prequel to Alien/s. With that said, it was more a very try-hard effort to try and inter grate the two together, meaning, it's really only the end of the movie that kind of ties it... it's like it was either meant to be an unsuspected surprise, but with every critic already telling you it's confirmed it is a prequel, that surprise has been blown away, and the ending it self looked like it was included at last minute.<br /><br />The story is probably what you expect from seeing trailers. In 2090 or so, a couple of archeologists/explorers find a cave in Scotland with some ancient paintings on the wall that show a star system. Putting two and two together, they link this start system to a bunch of other ancient drawings from around the world and luckily have the technology to head towards those stars in hopes of discovering where mankind evolved from. When they get there, they find it has a moon orbiting a planet that has an atmosphere that is not quite breathable to humans, but it most likely is the planet they have come to explore. They land on the planet and discover a bunch of structures that they decide to go into and blah blah blah blah... outbreak.<br /><br />The characters of the movie aren't so much the reason I didn't enjoy this film. For the most part, every actor did a decent job in being a believable character. All but two actors. One being the old man who has terrible make-up, and the other being whats-his-face who played a robot (that guy from X-men First Class as Magneto) despite the bad make up of one, both characters seemed very dry and make you beleive they are planning something very sinister only to be killed off in seconds when their time comes (Well, the Robot guy doesn't die, but still), which left me thinking, "what was the point of all that crap building up to this then?"<br /><br />The other thing that brought the whole thing down was the pace. It was too slow, and focused too much on creating a CGI environment and wasting time with pointless character interactions that lead to nothing. An example of that would be the Charlize Theron's role of being something of a dull and lifeless military woman who you wonder if she is human or not, but by the end of the movie, you realize, it wasn't leading up to something with her useless scenes of showing she is heartless, no, it was just a terrible role, much like the other guy who played Magneto.. whatever his name is... dull, lifeless, almost completely pointless.<br /><br />If only Elvis was around to tell Riddley Scott that he needs a little less conversation and a lot more action, then there might have been a decent flick here, but instead, it did the cheap thing it was most likely written for, to get Alien fans to hear it's a prequel, then suck them into any old rubbish, and end it on a note that there will be a sequel to this prequel.... and I won't be wasting my time with it if it does.</p></br><a href="../users/A3H9JSM1SUTE4O.html">A3H9JSM1SUTE4O</a><br/><p>This hugely anticipated film was attended by me and my family that range in age from teens through 70s.  After a very long discussion at lunch, none of us felt we were satisfied and we agreed the story was convoluted and ineptly told.  So many unanswered questions and so many dumb scenes and situations that seemed contrived or exploitive and in no way touched on the very big issues that were hinted at.<br /><br />We're all educated and we love movies of all kinds.  We discussed the hints of pagan and Christian mythology as well as possible source material for the story (such as it was) on screen.  Was it lifted from Ray Bradbury's poem "Christus Apollo"?  And why does it have an eerie resemblance to a "Dr. Who" episode that includes a Dr Shaw character, Prometheus and a big element of one of the apparent central themes?<br /><br />That said, Noomi Repace was excellent and so was Michael Fassbender as an android.  The visuals were of course cutting edge as in all of Ridley Scott's films.  But that's not enough for a satisfying movie experience.  This near debacle of a movie does not even come close to ALIEN.  The whole enterprise was either not thought out enough or way over-thought.  Or it was just a quick way to make a buck.  Too bad.  So sad.  It could have been stupendously magnificent.</p></br><a href="../users/A1H4NFXAJQRQ2K.html">A1H4NFXAJQRQ2K</a><br/><p>Saw the movie again, the Zionist overtones made me see it again to re-access my view of the film since the last scene left me with a bad taste, "this is Elizabeth Shaw signing off in the year of OUR LORD" blah blah whatever. After watching it again, references to the holocaust, focussing on her christian faith over and over, demanding her crucifix back etc. I now hate the movie completely as a British Zionist propaganda film. There is no room for Zionism in any science fiction film for me. I have lost almost all respect for Ridley Scott, the film Alien and Prometheus shamelessly rip-off Planet of the Vampires, but pollute a simple science fiction film with pathetic Zionist overtones, and in light of the wars in the middle east this type of holy crusade indoctrination is completely objectionable to me. If Scott had simple left off with a benign neutral statement of the folly of using weapons of mass destruction and them coming back to haunt and destroy their very creators, I'd have thought it a great theme, BUT Scott CHOSE to make the Shaw character blatantly take the stance of a blindly devote christian holy warrior marching off into the unknown, "in the year of OUR LORD 2098" or whatever. Huge mistake, and ruined a fine science fiction movie completely. I cannot separate the blatant Zionism from the material as a whole... since Britain is the home of the Zionists and give power to Israel etc.</p></br><a href="../users/A2JDYUSI2RILEB.html">A2JDYUSI2RILEB</a><br/><p>Ridley Scott's triumphant return to the science fiction genre may have started off as a prequel to his 1979 classic "Alien," but PROMETHEUS is a very different type of picture: a suspenseful and captivating film with provocative concepts and thematic material that challenges the viewer as much as it satisfies on a rich aesthetic level.<br /><br />Its "Alien" aspects - and there are some - are secondary to a story that asks where the human race came from, how we got here, and where we're going. Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindelof's screenplay posits these eternal questions in a manner that's positively refreshing in our current age of soulless blockbusters, opening with an utterly beautiful prologue set on Earth at the dawn of time (shot in Iceland by Scott) and proceeding to follow a spaceship crew in the late 21st century setting out to uncover the answers.<br /><br />Among the crew of the ship "Prometheus" are scientists Noomi Rapace and Logan Marshall-Green, gruff captain Idris Elba, icy cold Weyland corporation exec Charlize Theron, and a curious android named David (Michael Fassbender), the work of the elderly Charles Weyland (Guy Pearce) himself, who funded the mission to track down the whereabouts of beings who left "calling cards" on ancient cave paintings around the globe. Upon arriving on a desolate planet, Rapace and company find a dank, deserted chamber with remnants of an alien race that fled the scene some time before - as well as a gooey chemical substance that's anything but benevolent.<br /><br />It's easy to see why some viewers expecting a straight-ahead "Alien" prequel may be turned off by "Prometheus": this film isn't just a variation on its predecessor, with a group of disparate characters running around in the dark from a monster. Its brilliance is due to Scott's blending of familiar genre conventions with a story line that's deeper and more involved than most viewers may be prepared for. Granted, there are times when you wish certain plot points were clarified more than they are - especially in a mid-section that seems a bit rushed - but what's left unanswered aren't so much flaws as they are concepts left intentionally dangling for viewers to further contemplate. It may be less accessible to the masses than "Alien" but it's also emotionally stronger and deeper in terms of what it's attempting to do and say.<br /><br />Rapace's sensitive performance resonates strongly here in the latter regard, giving her character an emotional vulnerability that's wholly sympathetic - not just a Ripley clone, her Elizabeth Shaw is the moral epicenter of a crew that watches as their lofty hopes of finding out where life came from turns into a nightmarish assortment of questions about why the would-be Gods are trying to destroy them. Shaw's unshakeable faith is intriguingly tested by both the circumstance the crew finds themselves in, as well as her unusual relationship with the mysterious David, whose motivations are never entirely made clear in an otherwise fine performance from Fassbender.<br /><br />Scott's penchant for amazing visuals are, of course, on-hand throughout the film, and there are a handful of dynamic set-pieces: a thrilling storm that threatens the crew is later followed by a harrowing "medical" sequence and a sensational finale with a truly miraculous sense of scale. The director said in pre-publicity that he wanted "Prometheus" to be "big" and the film is indeed that, both in the messages it develops and the visuals on-screen. Spectacular effects and haunting creatures include concepts that resemble the work of H.R. Giger, giving fans a taste of the universe that Scott first brought to the screen with "Alien" but here in a very different context. (In fact, if there's a moment that feels somewhat out of step here, it's in a quote from Jerry Goldsmith's unused main title from "Alien" that comes across as unnecessarily shoe-horned into the picture).<br /><br />Dariusz Wolski's cinematography and even the score, credited to Marc Streitenfeld but enhanced with a lovely theme by Harry Gregson-Williams that's used throughout the picture (so much that it's surprising he only received an "Additional Music" credit), are likewise effective: this is a film that's filled with so much artistic invention and memorable images that one can see sci-fi fans returning to "Prometheus" for some time to come, both to dissect its narrative as well as take in its amazing artistic design.<br /><br />Throughout his career, Ridley Scott has shown himself to be a master craftsman in terms of imagery: not just in his classics like "Alien" and "Blade Runner," but also in the commercial failures of "Legend," "1492" and "White Squall." Throughout them all, Scott has brought the beauty of nature and, indeed, different worlds and even whole universes to life, very much like an artist painting on a blank canvas. While not without its flaws, "Prometheus" ranks not only with those films visually, but has one of the most compelling story lines from any of Scott's works, as well as an emotional range that's particularly surprising at its conclusion. It's a movie that stays with you long after the credits have rolled, a film that entertains and engages, a sublime mix so rarely seen at the movies any more.</p></br><a href="../users/A20IIR0422G3A5.html">A20IIR0422G3A5</a><br/><p>I'll get the visceral reaction out of the way quickly. I was disappointed with the movie the first time I watched it, from a director who gave us the original "Alien" and "Blade Runner" plus gripping non-sci fi films such as "Black Rain" and "Gladiator". The best thing I can say for Director Scott is that I believe the primary problem is not with the premise, which had enormous potential, but in the plot and the line by line writing. But, I watched it a second time the next night, and some of the kinks were ironed out by noticing some lines. Also, the relevance of the Prometheus myth became far clearer, and through it, I realized an important back story explanation which was obscured by the characters' ignorance. Read the Prometheus story before watching the movie and pay very close attention to the opening (and think 2001 opening.)<br /><br />One indicator of how incomplete things seem is that the very old billionaire, Peter Weyland, is played by a fine middle aged actor, Guy Pearce, but we never see him younger in flashbacks, which were probably cut from the final editing. Without giving too much away, the Peter Weyland character adds very little to the story aside from being the person who funds the mission.<br /><br />I sensed something was seriously out of joint when the "away team" enters the cavernous artifact. After encountering something just a bit squeamish, the geologist Fifield (Sean Harris) and biologist Milburn (Rafe Spall) decide to return to the Prometheus (the name of the humans' interstellar space ship.) The remaining team does a fair amount of exploring. Among other things, they see a hologram of the intelligent giants, drawings of whom they found on Earth. they are seeking running from some unseen danger. I saw no clue to what triggered the hologram. Following the hologram, they find the decapitated head of one of the giants (as opposed to the 'aliens' we encountered in earlier films).<br /><br />The captain of the Prometheus sends them a message that a serious storm is approaching. The team, with the usual annoyingly distracting side efforts which slow them down, reach the entrance and begin driving their vehicles back to the ship. But, and here the train falls off the track, never to return, we find Fifield and Milburn still in the artifact, when they said they were returning to the ship. They found some kind of life which intrigued the biologist. But why didn't the team returning to the ship notice that none of their vehicles were gone. Why did they leave the other two behind? Somehow, the two truants don't get the warning about the storm, or ignore it, so they become stuck in the artifact.<br /><br />There are loose ends aplenty with the alien fauna on this desolate world. My expectation coming in was that the film would explore the origins of two creatures, the "Alien" and the race of the giant pilot discovered by the crew of the mining ship Nostromo in "Alien". We meet the giants soon enough, but we also encounter at least three other life forms which have a passing resemblance to THE Alien, but their connection to the life cycle of the Alien is never explained.<br /><br />I'm entering dangerous "spoiler" territory now, so I will not discuss any more of the plot except to say that there are a number of unexplained events. Mysteries are great in the middle of the film, but one expects most of these to be wrapped up and revealed at the end of the picture. Many are not, leaving a huge jumping off point for a sequel to "Prometheus".<br /><br />Part of the special attraction of this story is that the audience knows full well what will eventually happen, so there is a lot of mental "don't go there" and "don't do that" moments, because we already know what things that look like that can do. The problem with that is that there is too much "quoting" from "Alien" for my tastes. Most of it is done relatively well, but it becomes more and more obvious as time goes on, and increasingly annoying. There is also ample quoting from other major Sci Fi movies such as 2001: A Space Odyssey (both in situations and in dialogue). There are also some subtle cinematic (visual) quotes from "Avatar" and "Jurassic Park".<br /><br />One of the bright spots, aside from the imaginative, well done CGI and cinematography, is the acting, which I always thought was a weak spot in "Alien". The crewmen, such as Captain Idris Elba, are spot on (unlike Yahpet Kotto in "Alien"). Instead of the strong Ellen Ripley character, we have the physically smaller and less imposing archaeologist, Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) who sports a convincing English accent as the lead character. Charlize Theron's character is restrained and unlikable. Like both Scott and Cameron's "Alien" and "Aliens", this movie has an android (artificial person) as a principal character, in a role much fuller than in the earlier movies. The only thing which distinguishes 'David', Michael Fassbender's android from Scott's earlier android Ash (Ian Holm, Alien) and Cameron's Bishop (Lance Hendrickson, Aliens)is that David is ever so slightly stilted, somewhat like Data from "Startrek, The Next Generation."<br /><br />I will give this the benefit of the doubt for now, but I found a strong disjoint in the rationale between two early scenes and the climax. I sense Scott wanted to leave plenty of meat on the bone to support a sequel. (In contrast, Avatar is almost totally devoid of preparation for a sequel I suspect I will need to revisit this review after seeing the film again. If my suspicion about gaps and disconnects is born out, I may have to lower my rating to 3 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/AYBL30P5NXNZ4.html">AYBL30P5NXNZ4</a><br/><p>Watching Scott's re-entry into the world of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004RE29T0">Alien [Blu-ray</a>] reminds you that there just aren't enough filmmakers around who really believably create philosophically interesting movies, in painstakingly created universes, designed to both entertain and make you think.  It's a treat to see him back in the genre.  Here, his original Alien movie has been used as a kick off point only.  Although, as he puts it, the `DNA' of that movie can be found here, this is not a direct prequel.  It simply happens in the same world, and has some fanboy satisfying nods to the original.  Here, the tone is markedly different, setting out a larger question on a more epic scale... how were we created? If life can be created in a lab, who then is the god?<br />We start briefly on Earth, where a couple of scientists have found common themes in petroglyphs around the globe, persuading them that these are a map, an invitation if you will, to come visit.  And so this movie is that deep space expedition, now funded by Weyland Corporation represented by the icy cool Charlize Theron.  Of course, things don't work out for the scientific expedition quite as expected once they arrive.  Soon vials of black goo are infecting the crewmembers and creatures start to appear in which the sharp eyed will see links back to Giger's original designs.  Don't go expecting the same claustrophobia of the original however.  Here the canvas is much more open, with sweeping vistas and grand set pieces.  Scott's eye for design is as evident as ever, and the effects uniformly satisfying, not least due to his penchant for creating real sets and props as much as possible, limiting the uses of cgi to areas you might not even realise.  Ultimately though, the movie is most satisfying in its almost arthouse beauty and grandeur in the first half.  As it lurches into elements of action and horror, the tension is never as vivid and the action beats never as shocking as you might expect.  Crucially, some plot elements are just a little fuzzy, and it takes the captain of the vessel to walk in to one scene and in a few sentences of exposition suddenly explain out of the blue what is happening, for things to start to come together.  The nagging questions at the end are mostly deliberate creation of mystery, but there are a few things that are not obvious that perhaps should be, and so the end is not wholly satisfying.<br />The 3D is actually probably the most satisfying since Avatar, in that it is never obtrusive or distracting, and the extras, ranging from the multiple commentaries, 3 hour 40 minute documentary (in modular format to let you jump in and out as you wish) and myriad of other materials including about 40 minutes of deleted and extended scenes, make for a terrific package.  Certainly watching the documentary was gripping and exhaustively illuminating in its discussion on how the details of the design came together, and the deleted scenes help illustrate some of the ideas that were left on the shelf.. and its nice to find the scene that was intended as a precursor to that scene of the Captain's exposition, to understand it was not always intended to be so out of the blue.<br />All in all, this is a great package, of a fascinating, though not perfect movie.  Even where it doesn't work completely, the ambition and vision is laudable.  Recommended - 7/10</p></br><a href="../users/ALWB64XOXNMDP.html">ALWB64XOXNMDP</a><br/><p>I'd have to sum up Prometheus like this:  Five stars for art direction, one star for the script.  It was fantastic to look at. However, all the character archetypes are still there. It's esscially the original Alien with a few changes.  That being, how they originated.  While I wanted to like this film; Ridley should have stepped in and made changes to the script.<br /><br />This prequel is to be part of a trilogy, according to Scott.  Where is he going to go from here?  I'd make Prometheus a dream if I were a director.  Without giving away major elements of the story, for those who haven't seen this movie, all the mystery is gone.  We are left with a very simplistic answer to all the questions that have been part of the franchise.</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>Ridley Scott wanted to make a film that asked big questions but, at the same time, could be tied into the same universe he pioneered for the "Alien" franchise. Although flawed "Prometheus" does have merit. You can read all the pro (5 star) and con (1 star)reviews to determine the brilliance or stupidity of this film.<br /><br />I'd argue that eventually "Prometheus" may, like "Blade Runner", see its reptutation rise with time. Either way, "Prometheus" is an often stunning looking film from Scott and, in spite of its narrative flaws (the script does have issues), the larger-than-life production values certainly make the film appear impressive looking.<br /><br />You're mileage may vary but try and ignore the hype associated with the film and put your expectations aside. If you ignore both you may find the film enjoyable.<br /><br />The 3D Blu-ray disc looks positively stunning--Scott shows an instinctive feel for 3D--the director uses the process to impress with the gradeur of the film and not as a gimmick. The transfer looks brilliant with deep, inky blacks and an amazing amount of detail evident. During the starmap sequence in particular the 3D effect is positively stunning. Depth is remarkably strong throuhgout the presentation.<br /><br />The regular Blu-ray also looks stunning BUT some players are having some issues (Sony players for example even with the latest upgrade for firmware)with pixelation and cubing where the image breaks up. Usually this is an issue with the disc itself and I'm going to assume that it is in this case although it would be wise to make sure your firmware is up-to-date.<br /><br />The 3D four disc edition comes with a DVD of the film in addition to the 3D and 2D Blu presentation. All three discs have the commentary track and there are deleted/alternate scenes (some of which should have been kept in the film despite pacing issues as they explained the behavior of some characters and gave others additional depth).<br /><br />The fourth disc features a terrific, in depth documentary on the making of the film directed by Charles de Lauzirika. "Furious Gods" covers everything from the conception of the film (it began as an "Alien" prequel/reboot), changes to the script over time, production designs and changes to the look of the film as pre-production progressed to production. We get plenty of behind-the-scenes footage. At three hours it's a massive documentary that is equally as impressive as the film looks.<br /><br />We also get the "viral" videos made of a younger Weyland, information on the production of "David" the android and other bits and pieces (including a bit of text that "suggests" a link between "Blade Runner" and "Prometheus" --something that Damon Lindelof had in mind while writing the script but never made explicit).<br /><br />Although flawed with dumb behavior by characters, plot holes that, in this version, you could fly a spaceship through "Prometheus" still manages to be entertaining particularly if you set aside the expectations created by the hype associated with the film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3CN9CCJUNIPKT.html">A3CN9CCJUNIPKT</a><br/><p>----------------------------------------------------------<br />"Prometheus" (2012)<br />----------------------------------------------------------<br />In this eerie prequel to the "Aliens" franchise, director Ridley Scott shows himself firmly in command, a skillful, dynamic auteur with a capacity to evoke wonder and inspire awe. Although tied to the Alien films, "Prometheus" is creepy and suspenseful but doesn't dwell in the high-octane gore of the original films -- it's there, but it's not the whole point of the film.  Instead, big concepts about the conquest of space, cosmic seeding and the spiritual yearnings of aliens, androids and man are probed and examined, and many big questions are left dangling, tantalizingly in need of further exploration. I can't remember a recent movie I've wanted a sequel of more than this one - I'm itching to see what happens next!<br /><br />In addition to the direction and special effects, the acting is also pretty good. I did not care much for the pair of lead actors Noomi Rapace and Logan Marshall-Green (the scientists behind the expedition) although Charlize Theron is fine as their unlikable corporate minder, and Idris Alba is fun as the noble spaceship captain (with major props to the supporting actors who played his crew...) The breakaway star of this show, though, is the steely-eyed Michael Fassbender, who plays David, the film's obligatory android, who is a spine-tingling combination of 2001's HAL and Star Trek's Data, one of the best portrayals of an AI being you'll ever see. Truly delicious. The aliens look cool, too.<br /><br />Bravo for Ridley Scott, who is back in the saddle again... Hopefully the studios will be smart and keep him at the helm for the planned sequels... Can't wait until they're out! (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)</p></br></body></html>

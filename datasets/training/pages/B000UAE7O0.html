I recently purchased it and I definitely have a different view of the movie and really enjoyed it. I have watched it several times since the purchase. The characters are hilarious cliches. I really enjoyed Jeff Fahey and Michael Biehn as two brothers trying to get the best BBQ sauce in Texas. Josh Brolin is excellent as Dr. Block and his wife Dakota and her father are just great characters.<br /><br />Really like this movie for all it quirkiness and for it drive in style.</p></br><a href="../users/A161ANWB62G3M8.html">A161ANWB62G3M8</a><br/><p>This is quite a gross movie, but it's so entertaining it works.<br /><br />There's a lot of funny violence but it takes a strong stomach to enjoy it.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1906669023">Sherlock Holmes and the Flying Zombie Death Monkeys</a></p></br><a href="../users/A3N6GAJTEOF4MO.html">A3N6GAJTEOF4MO</a><br/><p>Grindhouse was originally released in theatres as a nostalgic look at the matin&eacute;e style movies of the Grindhouse theatres. These movie theatres would usually display 1, 2 or even 3 movies in a row. The movies were relatively low budget in exchange for high levels of advertising. Both Tarrantino and Rodriguez have spoken of their love for the Grindhouse theatres as kids. They both set about to make two separate movies that would be shown in succession, but in between would feature commercials for further fictional movies. This, in their mind would create the same atmosphere that they experienced as kids. It didn't work and a lot of the time, after the first movie would end (Either Planet Terror or Death Proof) movie go'ers assumed that was it and would leave. Not knowing there is another movie to follow after the commercial breaks. Because of this failure, against their will both Rodriguez and Tarrantino decided to release the movies separately and the success grew from there. I've seen Tarrantino's Death Proof, and I must say I didn't really care for it. This is why we have Planet Terror. In case you don't have the attention span to follow an hour or so of dialogue, then at least you get this movie in which people get blown to pieces every couple of minutes. I am the latter and I absolutely loved this movie.<br /><br />It had cheesy dialogue that, at times made no sense and had no place in the situation our heroes where presented with. The gore was reminiscent of my beloved classic sci-fi gross out flicks that, instead of using CGI endeavored to create the gore for real (not using actual body parts though). This made some of the craziness more genuine and in Planet Terror actually made my stomach turn.<br /><br />In Texas, a gang leaded by the black market dealer Abby faces a group of renegade militaries leaded by Captain Muldoon in an abandoned military base. During their shootout, Abby shoots a recipient of biological weapon, releasing an experimental highly-contagious gas that turns humans to flesh-eating zombies. Meanwhile, in the local hospital, Dr. Block sees an epidemic with many patients with the same nasty symptoms. When the outbreak affects most of the local population, a group of people with immunity leaded by the mechanic Wray, Sheriff Hague, the stripper Cherry and the Dr. Dakota, fight to survive and become the last hope to save the world.<br /><br />This was an awesome mind numbing movie that went at a mile a minute. It doesn't seek to be intelligent or even have a go at some random intelligent speeches. Be warned, this movie is stupid and watching it may make you a few points lower in your IQ. One thing I have to tell you is that it's really worth it as it's so much fun. I'm actually disappointed that Tarrantino's installment didn't really deliver for me.<br /><br />Buy it and enjoy it.</p></br><a href="../users/A34HYQ9BQZPE78.html">A34HYQ9BQZPE78</a><br/><p>"Planet Terror" is one of the most unique films I've seen in quite a while. It's a sort of parody/ tribute to the drive-in/ exploitation movies of the 1970s. Now here's my Top Ten Reasons Why You Should Watch "Planet Terror":<br />1) It's brought to us by Robert Rodriguez, the same man that gave us "From Dusk Till Dawn", so you know this is gonna be something interesting, and especially well-made.<br />2) ...and, like "From Dusk Till Dawn", this movie starts off serious but is able to do a 180 about 40 minutes into it. This basically means that the pacing of this movie is good and time really flies, even though it's about an hour and forty minutes long.<br />3) There's plenty of odd characters, and while there isn't any real plot, all the characters contribute to the charm and appeal of this movie.<br />4) A reason you MUST watch this movie, a girl has a machine gun for a leg! She doesn't get it until the last, twenty minutes or so, but when she DOES get become our loveable Machine Gun Sally...WATCH OUT!!! This includes when she shoots the ground and flies thirty feet over a wall like a comic book superhero. That's a clip you will DEFINITELY wanna watch again.<br />5) Gore, gore, gore!!! This movie is packed with plenty of horror-related action, alongside LOTS of headshots and the red stuff flies like ducks flying south for the winter.<br />6) Tom Savini makes an appearance as a police officer, and it's always cool to see Tom land a spot in a cool movie.<br />7) The whole film even feels like a sort of '70s movie, if you forget the fact that it's a tribute to these types of movies, so we get the nostalgic feel and classic sorta setting.<br />8) All the actors do a very good job at playing their roles, so this breathes even more life into the film.<br />9) There are so many, ridiculous moments, like the guy that jumps around like a martial artist and rips zombies apart one after another after another!!! This movie is chock full of awesome moments and true novelty ideas that put a real twist on this type of movie.<br />and Reason Number 10:<br />10) This movie is a real treat because it doesn't follow the rulebook on what a horror/action/exploitation movie should be. Like "From Dusk Till Dawn" it is such a novelty item and SO COOL, it's a movie you just can't watch once. It's a fun-filled, action-packed, zombie-raging movie that YOU DON'T HAVE TO TAKE SERIOUSLY! Just kick back, grab a bottle of your favorite iced tea, and let the DVD play.<br /><br />Well, if you made it this far into the review, I wanna say thanks!!! If you're looking for a fun, exciting, gory, and actually rather funny movie, "Planet Terror" is a newfound gem that's sure to withstand the test of time, and can almost be called this generation's "From Dusk Till Dawn". Robert Rodriguez sure is making a name for himself as a writer and director, because both these movies are flat-out awesomeness!<br />If you're looking for a horror/action-comedy movie that'll bring you a good time, "Planet Terror" will be your Knight in Bloody Armor...WITH the machine gun leg! LOL. Thanks for the time, and peace.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GHUN5HXMHZ89.html">A1GHUN5HXMHZ89</a><br/><p>Could I have watched this at the Starlight Drive-in 35 years ago? No, but it sure feels like it. It has the look and feel of one of the double feature B movies we saw back then. I applaud the production, directing, casting, editing, and camera work. All went into making it look and feel older. The cast does a fine job with their parts and add to the illusion of an older B movie, but with some satire that let's us smile along with them as we know they aren't really serious when in the older movies they were funny unintentionally and they were serious about it. I really enjoyed the characters in this movie and it kept my interest the whole time. Well worth at least a rental and I think this one is a keeper and the price makes it a steal. It has some great acting, effects, and the story is just plain fun. Good quality DVD with plenty of replayability. If you enjoyed this catch "Sin City" and "Kill Bill". - C. Luster</p></br><a href="../users/A13IKSGDYNBNQS.html">A13IKSGDYNBNQS</a><br/><p>The film commences with "Our forthcoming presentation" an excellent fake trailer for "Machete". However if you check the IMDB you will find that Machete is a film in production! In the trailor for Machete the whole plot seems to be given away - now doesn't that sounds familiar. So what about Planet Terror? Well having recently watched Death Proof I really wasn't expecting much, but this is much nearer the mark than Tarantino's effort.<br /><br />A zombie movie, with classy B movie actors who supply the type of performance you would expect from a major production that pays homage to many movies from the 1970's and 1980's. So long as you've got a reasonably strong stomach and you don't mind the slightly 1970's misogynist edge to the whole thing its really entertaining.<br /><br />I was never a fan of Rodriguez until I saw Sin City, and this is almost as good as that. It only lets itself down in one area, that is the fake early 1970's era scratchy film quality which is over-played hugely. Its a one-joke technique played for 1 hour 40 min. Overall though great fun.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>If ever there was a "popcorn movie" this is it! A hybrid throwback to the days of cheap explotation films, this film is just too much! It's funny, it's tense, it's gory and it's stupid, but it's the most entertaining rocket ride I've been on in a long time! The film starts out with a mock trailer that's right out of the 70's it's totally hilarious! What makes the entire film even better it that it has scratches and wear throughout just like those old drive-in movies! If you love movies, you should check this one out....it's a blast!</p></br><a href="../users/A20DZX38KRBIT8.html">A20DZX38KRBIT8</a><br/><p>Amazing horror comedy.  Breath taking effects and gore, cool story, over the top fighting sequences and great acting.  I want to see more of these movies!</p></br><a href="../users/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z.html">AEQFYOI6YJ83Z</a><br/><p>Bruce Willis and his cohorts have unleased a deadly gas into the atmosphere--one that rots away at the flesh, and turns the populace into cannibalistic monsters.  Caught in this nightmare is Cherry Darling, a go-go (not cry-cry) dancer who loses a leg and gains some self-respect; a mysterious truck driver named El Wray, who is handy with a gun and never misses; the local sheriff who's been around the block and is rather weary of it; the local barbeque chef who just wants to make his recipe the best he possibly can; and the frantic mother who's just trying to save her child from her sadistic husband.  Together, they must combat these hordes of zombies before the zombies eat them.<br /><br />That's basically it.  Never fear, though--"Planet Terror" isn't meant to be anything more than exploitation fun, which is what makes it so tantalyzingly enjoyable.  A stellar cast (Rose McGowan, Freddie Rodriguez, Michael Biehn, Jeff Fahey, Josh Brolin, Marley Shelton) leads the way, with wonderful supporting roles from Willis, Michael Parks, Tom Savini, Quentin Tarantino, and Robert Rodriguez's own son providing ample and talented back-up.  The writing is crisp; the action flows along smoothly.  There's little pondering about WHY people are becoming zombies; there's no room and no need for it in a movie of this sort.  This is an exploitation movie, and as such is not meant to be thought-provoking, only chilling.  You'll cringe in spots; yes, even you, the die-hard horror movie fans, will squirm in your seats.<br /><br />A note about "Grindhouse" overall.  Tarantino's half, "Death Proof," was a more serious, thoughtful effort; while I admire Tarantino, and absolutely love his contribution, Rodriguez's would have to be my favorite half.  I'm not sure why...maybe because it's just good fun.  For those of you who, like me, saw the movie in theaters, you'll be happy to note that the scratches are still here; the missing scene is thankfully still missing (I was upset that Tarantino put the "lap dance" scene back in "Death Proof," but it's all for the best, I suppose); and the "Machete" preview has been tacked onto the beginning of the movie.  Rodriguez also makes mention, in the bonus features (well worth watching, by the way), of a future double-disc "Grindhouse" release...so hopefully the rest of the mock-previews will be included there.  It'd be great to see this feature in its entirety.  If nothing else, these seperate releases help us view the movies on their own terms; both live up to their hype (and, in many instances, surpass them).  So go ahead and buy them individually; I did.  And I'll buy the "Grindhouse" feature when IT comes out.  Because, let's face it--these are just two great movies.</p></br><a href="../users/AN8M401S8Y6DA.html">AN8M401S8Y6DA</a><br/><p>Cherry Darling played by Rose McGowan who strips to get a "leg up" and make "ends meat" realizes her destiny with a little help from her ex boyfriend "El Ray" and a machine gun leg after an experimental bio-weapon is released turning everyone into zombie like creatures.  At the end in her Arab like garments and how far she'd come it reminded me of Lawrence of Arabia albeit by means of a fun gore fest b horror movie about three hours shy of David Lean's epic masterpiece and instead a cool Rodriguez film.<br /><br />There are some other minor plot points such as Bruce Willis and his ties to Osama Bin Laden.  A love triangle between Fergie of the Black Eyed Peas (along with a few gratuitous shots of her) Marley Shelton and her abusive husband played by Josh Brolin there both doctors and this comes in handy as she can keep needles under her garter.  A sheriff played by Michael Biehn (Aliens, Terminator) who wants his brothers barbecue recipe and last but not least keep an eye out for the babysitter twins.<br /><br />Out of the two grindhouse features I found Tarantino's Death Proof to be the more artistic and probably better film although I found Planet Terror to be the better action movie and a fun ride, although Death Proof did have one of the best car chase scenes I've seen perhaps since The French Connection.  It's kind of the way I view Alien and Aliens.  Alien to me is a great film and to me superior however Aliens is also great and one of the best action movies I have ever seen.<br /><br />All and all released together or separately or if they come out with more editions there both two cool movies and some of the best of 2007 and a worthy add to any collection and both dvds are filled with extra, I've listed Planet Terror's below.<br /><br />You do get one of the fake trailers on this one Machette at the beginning of Planet Terror it's a Mexploitation film.<br /><br />DISC I Feature Film<br />Extended and Unrated<br />Feature Commentary by Rodriguez<br />Audience reaction track<br />International trailer and poster Gallery<br /><br />DISC II<br />10 Min film school with Rodriguez<br />The Bad babes and tough guys of Planet Terror<br />Casting Rebel<br />Sicko's bullets, and explosions:  The stunts of Planet Terror<br />The friend, The doctor, and the real estate agent.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>This movie is great and the ones that watch it with me had a blast. Rodriguez had already indulged himself to his heart's content in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004RJ74">From Dusk Till Dawn (Dimension Collector's Series)</a> which was also about a group of people fighting off warring vampires in a night club from, as the name indicates, from dusk till dawn, which makes "Planet Terror" an encore exercise of pretty much similar plot, similar format and similar execution. As his other movies like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000A2ZTY">El Mariachi (Special Edition)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000A2ZU1">Desperado (Special Edition)</a> are themselves (quite stylish) derivatives of the exploitative genre, it is difficult to find any redeeming value in the repetition, even if it is done in zest and playful ribbing, which reduces "Planet Terror" a Cliff Notes' version to "From Dusk till Dawn".<br /><br />"Planet Terror" features a giant cast of big names, small names, and names a few of us grin fondly at. The most fun, though, comes from the lead characters of Wray and Cherry, handled deftly in regards to pure entertainment by lesser-known Freddy Rodriguez Rose McGowan. Wray seems like an insignificant nice guy who drives a wrecker, but he has a mysterious past and combat skills that are brutally efficient. Cherry is a go-go dancer that used to be involved years ago with Wray and happens to find herself back in his company on the bloody night our story transpires. Watching Wray take charge of the survivors and kick butt all over is fun, doubly so because he is such a likable and unassuming hero. And Cherry, who loses one of her legs early on for the sake of "running" gags and a wonderfully absurd series of action scenes where a machine gun has replaced her leg, is mostly pleasant as a damsel in distress who must become an involuntary mistress of destruction. This movie has so many fantastic moments, subtle touches, and ridiculous humor.<br /><br />Rodriguez has always handled the cinematography, editing, and music for his pictures-- he coined the phrase "shot, chopped, and scored" for his Renaissance man approach to his pictures. While I have often wished he would find himself an editor, he has always excelled at the shooting and scoring, and not only does he deliver a nuclear explosion of talent for those this time, his editing manages to work superbly in this genre's already choppy format. The film is a visual extravaganza, not only for the gore and make-up artistry (be aware this is one of the biggest gross-outs I have ever seen on screen recently), but for Rodriguez's keen eye for photography on films of this ilk as well as the artificial flaws he implants in the movie to lend authenticity to the idea that this film was meant for another era. Scratches on film, color errors, skipping frames, burn outs on reels as well as a missing reel (a humorous tool Tarantino employs in his offering as well) give "Planet Terror" an atmosphere of cool.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>I approached "Planet Terror" with some trepidition because Quentin Tarantino's segment of "Grindhouse", "Death Proof", was such a crashing bore.  Well, Robert Rodriguez's flick is the polar opposite of that self-indulgent mess.  Rodriguez inherently understands that the whole grindhouse experience is about fun and he delivers it in buckets.  Whereas Tarantino had to spell out in capital letters his influences(we filmgoers can't be as knowledgable as the former video store clerk), Rodriguez references the work of George Romero and Tobe Hooper with maybe a touch of Sam Peckinpah without rubbing our noses in it.  For sure there's a lot of gore here but Rodriguez presents it in such a hilarious tongue-in-cheek manner that you're never repulsed by it.  Rose McGowan gives a star-making turn here and she has a classic beauty that reminded me of a latter day Rita Hayworth.  I also liked Josh Brolin as a physician treating the infected.  Brolin is a terrific actor and you should check him out as the heavy in the underrated "Into the Blue".  Rodriguez with this film and "Sin City" puts himself in the first tier of American directors if only the critics would get over their aversion of the genres he works in.  On a final note will somebody make a full-length version of "Machete", the film trailer that stars Danny Trejo and Cheech Marin.</p></br><a href="../users/A1W702WG1LC6R3.html">A1W702WG1LC6R3</a><br/><p>Rose McGowan and more star in Robert Rodriguez's<br />2007 action horror film.

Her gun leg is cool and there is good humor here and there.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>Two masters of modern action cinema, Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez, have come up with a jim-dandy of an idea for their first collaborative moviemaking effort, "Grindhouse."  They have decided to make two `70-s-style exploitation pictures (the kind of movies on which these two directors were obviously weaned), package them into a double feature, then add a coming attractions trailer and a note from the theater management to make the "experience" complete (please note that this review is based on the split-DVD versions of the film, not the original theatrical release).  Although the films are set in the present day, the directors have made them appear to be un-restored relics from three decades ago.  The poor lighting, faded colors, missing frames and surface scratches all make the prints look very old and worn indeed.  In fact, were it not for the cell phones and references to Chris Rock and Osama bin Laden contained in the film, one would swear Tarantino and Rodriguez had just found these long-neglected movies moldering away in some dusty vault somewhere, possibly on the lot of American International Pictures.<br /><br />But beyond the obvious technical triumph, is there anything of substance to "Grindhouse"?  Well, if by "substance," one means "food for thought," then the answer is probably no.  But if there is intrinsic value to be had in simple camp and parody, then Tarantino and Rodriguez clearly deliver the goods.  While both films suffer from over length and hit a point of diminishing returns before reaching their respective conclusions, "Grindhouse" provides entertainment in extremis for schlock-meisters everywhere.<br /><br />The first up is "Planet Terror" (directed by Rodriguez), a cheesy zombie picture decked out with absurdly over-the-top action sequences and a great deal of good humor (it`s amazing just how close some of this gets, in terms of storyline and detail, to the later "I Am Legend").  The large cast consists of Freddy Rodriguez ("Six Feet Under"), Josh Brolin ("No Country for Old Men"), Bruce Willis, Naveen Andrews ("Lost"), Rosa McGowan, and Harley Shelton, all of whom get into the spirit of the enterprise by ginning up their energy levels and playing their roles with deadpanned earnestness.<br /><br />The second feature, "Death Proof," is considerably different in style from Rodriguez` entry, with Tarantino bringing his trademark mixture of snappy dialogue and graphic violence to the offbeat tale of a homicidal movie stuntman (Kurt Russell) who employs his souped-up, "death proof" car as a weapon of mass destruction.  There are those who will find "Death Proof" to be too talky and slow-moving for their tastes, especially in contrast to the hyper-kinetic "Planet Terror," but Tarantino's more cerebral approach makes it possible for him to achieve a tone of genuine menace in the second half of the story.  He also undercuts audience expectations by casually doing away with most of his main characters partway through the movie.  Restless action movie aficionados should also note that all the talk is merely a lead up to a spectacular car chase sequence guaranteed to have them gripping the arms of their seats in excitement.  An affectionate homage to all those car-demolition epics from the 1970's - "Vanishing Point," "Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry," "Gone in 60 Seconds," etc. - that one scene alone is worth the price of admission.  (Oddly, at about the midpoint of the movie, Tarantino suddenly drops the pseudo-'70's look in favor of a more contemporary style).  Russell has a grand old time playing the grizzled serial killer, while Rosario Dawson, Vanessa Ferlito, Jordan Ladd, Sydney Tamiia Porter, Tracie Thomas, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Zoe Bell and Marcy Harriell provide eye-candy aplenty as the various women and/or victims who come his way (though, why oh why does Tarantino keep insisting on casting himself in his own pictures?).<br /><br />The faux-trailer that the directors have attached to the beginning of the movie (it's for a film called "Machete") comes about as close as possible to looking like the real thing, with one key exception:  it features swear words and nudity, something that no coming-attractions trailer, to my knowledge at least, has ever done.<br /><br />As a pastiche of raw-boned, off-Hollywood moviemaking, "Grindhouse" is a mixed-bag of virtues and flaws, and it won't be everybody's cup of tea by any stretch of the imagination.  But lovers of '70's movie schlock should have a decent enough time with it - provided they have the patience to sit through it that is.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>"Planet Terror" is Robert Rodriguez' contribution to "Grindhouse", where it was double-billed with Quentin Tarantino's "Death Proof" and complemented by fake movie trailers to recreate and re-examine the exploitation film experience of the 1970s. Truth be told, "Planet Terror" owes a lot to 1980s sci-fi action-horror, but this homage to zombie movies surpasses most of the films it emulates. I expected to be bored. I was surprised to find myself giggling at the gorefest. There are severed limbs, vile disease, splatter, and grotesqueries galore. But it's a hoot.<br /><br />Go-go dancer Cherry Darling (Rose McGowan) crosses paths with ex-boyfriend El Wray (Freddy Rodriguez) just as a dispute between a rogue Army officer (Bruce Willis) and a mercenary scientist (Naveen Andrews) results in a toxic biochemical agent being released into the air in their small Texas town. The gas turns those who ingest it into grotesque zombies who prey on the living, ripping their victims limb from limb. The lovers lead a motley group of survivors against the zombies -despite Cherry's newly-acquired disability.<br /><br />"Planet Terror" is scratched and speckled, recalling a film that has run through the projector too many times. The film in the Weinstein 2007 2-disc set is 10 minutes longer than the theatrical double-bill version, but there is still a "missing reel". One fake trailer, for Mexican vigilante flick "Machete", precedes the feature. Tarantino's "Death Proof" is more cerebral in its comment on exploitation cinema, but "Planet Terror" is better-paced and has more laughs. "Planet Terror" manages to be both self-parody and a terrifically entertaining example of those films which it parodies.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>Planet Terror is without doubt the best 'good' movie that I've seen this year. It's certainly no 5-star classic, and it hardly borders on being 'great', but for a deliberately over-the-top, 70's Horror/gore-sploitation spoof, it easily takes the 2007 best-of cup.<br /><br />Have you ever seen that campy flick from the 80s called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002KQNL8">Return of the Living Dead Part II</a>? You know, where some government bio-warfare chemicals are accidentally released and turn anyone that comes into contact with the agent into a brain-craving zombie? Well, Planet Terror Director Robert Rodriguez clearly has seen it, and he ultimately made what could be considered a *much* better than the original remake of ROTLD II with PT.<br /><br />Unlike its Grindhouse partner, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000R7HY0K">Death Proof</a>, Planet Terror goes mainly with the 'that's just plain silly' instead of the 'this could really happen'. The situations in Planet Terror are over-exaggerated (deliberately); the gore is way over-done (deliberately); and the movie is as much a Comedy (deliberately) as it is a Horror film. Keeping the 'deliberateness' of the movie in mind makes it all work quite well.<br /><br />Planet Terror is full of actors you know, and many are usual suspects in the Tarantino/Rodriguez shop. The actors really help make this movie successful at what it's trying to do by taking their roles seriously in a not-so-serious movie.<br /><br />What exactly is Planet Terror trying to do? Entertain. It does so...thoroughly.</p></br><a href="../users/AB0W9GTNGHSI3.html">AB0W9GTNGHSI3</a><br/><p>looking for crazy funny sexy and straight up action here it is to the fullest any1 that gave this 1 star didnt know what they were going to watch just watch the preview and u will know what ur looking for-- excelent movie and very creative!!! buy or rent this one</p></br><a href="../users/AQ0EO10KTRJ4V.html">AQ0EO10KTRJ4V</a><br/><p>PLANET TERROR was good for what it was..... namely a zombie spoof film that paid homage to Drive-In films of the 1970s.<br />Of course it was over the top and cheesy.<br /><br />The budget, special effects, and other film making aspects of the film were quite good which made me think to myself.......

Written and directed by Robert Rodriguez. When a toxic product is released in the air, infected people who died become zombies and terrorize the rest of the population. PLANET TERROR is a popcorn movie, that's about all I can say about this motion picture. And I can say the same thing about every Robert Rodriguez movies I've seen, with the exception of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BCKFWK">Sin City - Unrated (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)</a> maybe because the material Rodriguez worked on wasn't his. When Quentin Tarantino is able to create a film with the same material, Robert Rodriguez will only make a motion picture. That's the difference between an author and a very talented director who hasn't nothing peculiar to say.

Rose McGowan alone makes this movie as she is one of the sexiest looking stars in movies.  During the movie she loses a leg but her boyfriend later replaces it with a machine gun for which she then starts mowing down the zombies.  My only question is how did she fire that gun since it is attached to a hook on her leg stump?</p></br><a href="../users/AER15RIMV8E6D.html">AER15RIMV8E6D</a><br/><p>I thought Planet Terror was awesome and the better of the two Grindhouse movies! We first meet Cherry Darling doing a sexy go-go dance, but she wants to quit. During this time, some Military men are meeting at a Military base with a scientist named Abby. The Military need a huge amount of deadly biochemical agent called DC2. When the deal goes wrong, Abby shoots the DC2 and it all fills the night air and infects some of the town's residents. Then we meet Dr. Block and his wife, Dakota. They work the graveyard shift at the hospital. Meanwhile, Cherry runs into her old boyfriend, El Wray. During a ride in his truck, they run into some trouble with zombies! Cherry loses her leg, and Wray takes her to the hospital. At the hospital, the bodies keep rolling in, and the zombies take over. Cherry, Wray, Dakota, and the sheriff all meet at the sheriff's brother's BBQ place called The Bone Shack. They try to figure out how to survive the zombie outbreak, and get taken to the military where the final battle between the living, and the dead! There were a lot of awesome gore scenes!

It basically aid that independent film, really independent film, could have a platform if something like this succeeded. The format would be one that allowed for all types of terrible things to happen, and it didn't have to apologize for it. Over-the-top action, horrid effects just for the sake of shock, acting that can be questionable or beautiful; everything funny in the world of movies could live under one roof. It sounded so beautiful. Sadly, there are some downsides to that as well and they dealt with making a film like this just to do it: fake problems with the film, fake missing reels, false problems hoping to mirror working with only a master. This creates some problems, too, and those problems were self-inflicted injuries on what could have otherwise been a great movie.<br /><br />As far as Planet Terror goes, it is funny and builds a surprisingly good movie for the first half of the film. I was actually caught up in it, enjoying the chemical problem the town had and the over-the-top characterizations showcased on the screen. I didn't really like the fact that the movie came with cigarette burns that were placed in the movie on purpose, that the film was grainy and that was also on purpose, but it helped the movie as I watched half of it. Then a little segment called " Reels Missing" came up and, after that, the movie kind of dragged on.<br />If it would have continued with the tale, not doing that to try and be like something old-school, it would have been a lot better.<br /><br />I'm not saying that Planet Terror didn't have anything to offer or that it wasn't entertaining. I liked a lot of it and it had some funny things happening. The problem here, the gimmick, was one that wasn't subtle and wasn't needed and ending up hurting the movie. It took the linear interaction between the audience and the people in the film and made them that and that alone; had the gimmick not been the primary kicker I think it would have been noticed more.<br />Watch if bored but don't think that the box office bomb was because of anything save a lackluster execution on what was an otherwise entertaining outing.</p></br><a href="../users/A100JCBNALJFAW.html">A100JCBNALJFAW</a><br/><p>dont get me wrong i like death proof but planet terror i love more so!<br />plant terror is your basic gore fest! the tounge scene is bad A**!<br />in a nutshell its dawn of the dead meets the stand meets outbreak meets rose with one leg! there is alot of comedy in this film as well. it would really suck to have your package just kind of melt away.<br />but all in all the film is great. p.s ONE OF THE TRAILERS ARE BACK!</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>After an experimental bio-nerve gas is accidentally released at a remote U.S. military base in Texas, those exposed to the gas turn into flesh-eating, mutating zombies out to kill.

While these two cinemaphiles always appear to have a blast making their movies, the "Grindhouse" project may be the paragon of their mad-cap filmmaking self-indulgence.<br /><br />"Grindhouse" was a double-feature in which RR and QT each provided a flick designed to be a homage to the low-budget horror/exploitation films of the 60s and 70s.  "Planet Terror" is RR's entry, although QT makes quite an impression in an extended cameo as a deranged military nutcase.  QT's half was "Death Proof," which I won't review here, but it's definitely of a piece with "Planet Terror."<br /><br />Zombie films are seemingly as popular now as ever, so RR's spoof/tribute is timely.  The flick opens with a hilarious mock trailer for "Machete," an X-rated revenge flick.  The film quality of the trailer is terrible - RR fakes wear-and-tear on the film and includes skips and flaws in the soundtrack as a tribute to the grindhouse experience.  This works fine in the trailer, but as it continues into the feature film, it gets more than a little annoying after 60 minutes.<br /><br />"Planet Terror" opens up with a zombie outbreak in Texas, thanks to military hijinx led by Lt. Muldoon (Bruce Willis) for reasons unknown.  Soon zombies are tearing across the countryside, rending the innocent and not-so-innocent limb from limb.  Unfortunately, "Planet Terror" is aiming more for humor and gross-outs rather than genuine scares, so be prepared to wince rather than cringe.  Some of the jokes really work, such as several close-ups of the "humps" of Black Eyed Peas singer/ornament Fergie, just before the zombies tear her humps apart.  There's also a clever "Missing Reel," alert, with apologies from theater management, just when a love scene between stripper Cherry Darling (Rose McGowan) and Wray (Freddie Rodgriguez) gets its most "exploitative."<br /><br />Ultimately, this is not a good horror movie in that it will not create any genuine terror, a la the original "Halloween," "Nightmare on Elm Street," or even "Dawn of the Dead."  But it must be said that there are two types of horror movies, and this is the second type - the kind that goes for dark humor, ridiculiously-sensational death scenes, and blood by the barrelful.  That kind of horror movie doesn't appeal to me all that much, truth be told, but if that's your game I expect "Planet Terror" will find its way to the top of your DVD stack pretty quickly.<br /><br />For what it is, I cannot imagine a movie doing a better job of hitting its target than "Planet Terror."  It is a tribute to bad taste and bad movies - and for what it is, almost as much fun as RR and QT had making it.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>The best part of Grindhouse (besides the fake trailers) was Robert Rodriguez's Planet Terror, which is now on DVD nearly a month after Quentin Tarantino's Death Proof was released.  Though the Weinstein Company sadly decided to split the films for home video release (besides Machete, the fake trailers aren't here), the pair's Grindhouse films are an experience to say the least.  Planet Terror revolves around Go-Go dancer Cherry (Rose McGowan) and her ex-flame El Wray (Freddy Rodriguez) who are caught in the middle of an undead outbreak.  As survivors gather together, the military steps in with their own intentions, and thus let the blood bath begin.  What really makes Planet Terror so good is that Robert Rodriguez is clearly having a blast with the proceedings, as he pays delightful homage to the exploitation flicks that inspired Grindhouse as a whole.  There's nifty gore effects from industry master Greg Nicotero, and the rest of the cast, including Bruce Willis, Josh Brolin, Marley Shelton, Michael Biehn, Jeff Fahey, Stacy Ferguson, and Lost's Naveen Andrews, make memorable turns as well.  Instantly enjoyable for zombie addicts and Rodriguez fans alike, Planet Terror is a deliciously bloody and gooey treat.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>You've gotta love blood, gore, sex, lesbianism, and impossible human feats to enjoy something like PLANET TERROR. It is, in essence, a hardboiled 70s slasher/zombie film with all of its nonsensical sexual under (and over) tones surrounded by reel-to-reel style filming with its scratchy and skipping that those who've spent time at the drive-ins of ol' will no doubt enjoy as it harkens them back to days gone by (gotta love that run-on sentence, eh?)<br /><br />Rose McGowan (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000R7HY0K">Death Proof</a>) plays Cherry Darling (no, it's not a p0rn name ...although it could be), a strip dancer who's suddenly thrust into the middle of a pending apocalypse. The military has unleashed a zombifying chemical and it threatens Cherry's nearby one-horse town.<br /><br />She is quickly reunited with El Wray (Freddy Rodriguez, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JLTR8Q">Lady in the Water</a>), a lost love turned truck driver who's never forgotten her. The two zip this way and that in an attempt to avoid the newly walking dead but Cherry meets up with a hungry bunch and has a lower leg gnawed off. She's taken to a local hospital where it rapidly becomes apparent that the zombies are taking over.<br /><br />Meanwhile, El Wray is taken into custody by Sheriff Hague (Michael Biehn) and there's an unmentioned tension between the two that escalates as the Sheriff's town begins falling apart. But the Sheriff knows how good El Wray is with a gun ("I never miss.") and eventually hands over his pistols to him. The ensuing head shots are gruesomely wonderful (I believe the handgun was a .45).<br /><br />Also amongst this chaos is the strained marriage of two physicians, Dr. William Block (Josh Brolin, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MTFFO0">The Dead Girl</a>) and Dr. Dakota Block (Marley Shelton, DON'T COME KNOCKING) who work at this hospital where zombies begin increasing in numbers. William suspects his wife is having an affair and it is later confirmed; but it was with another woman, something that incenses him. Dakota is excellent at anesthetizing patients and her skills with her sexy syringe-stuffed garters comes in handy.<br /><br />The running gag throughout the film is a take on a barbeque restaurant which is besieged by the undead. It is run by Sheriff Hague's brother and the two are at odds over a secret sauce recipe. The brothers eventually come together in a very destructive way, but come together they must.<br /><br />In the end it is El Wray and Cherry who save the day. El Wray with his dead aim and Cherry with her newfound leggy weapon (gotta love the handicapped!)<br /><br />This will be a film of contention for many. For those who want a serious telling of a great zombie flick, they won't find it here. For those wanting a laugh-out-loud comedy in-line with such things as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006A9FKA">Shaun of the Dead</a>, they won't find it either. But it is nicely wedged in-between those two, with some rousingly good gore and a few chuckles thrown in for good measure.<br /><br />A decent film for those that might enjoy a stroll down memory-film lane.<br /><br />(Note: This is part 2 of 2 in the Grindhouse Film duet. The first movie, Death Proof, was directed by Quentin Tarantino and the two were broken up upon DVD release. The two films come with an intermission that shows a few hilarious "coming soon" featurettes.)</p></br><a href="../users/AER15RIMV8E6D.html">AER15RIMV8E6D</a><br/><p>I thought Planet Terror was awesome and the better of the two Grindhouse movies!

This was originally part of the double-feature presentation "Grindhouse" along with Quentin Tarantino's DEATH PROOF, and whilst both movies play well as a double feature, you can easily enjoy PLANET TERROR as a stand-alone movie experience.<br /><br />Rose McGowan is a natural fit for the role of Cherry; and it's a complete mystery--to this reviewer at least--why it's taken her so long to be the leading lady of an action/horror film; she's perfect!

For instance 'death carries a cane' from 1971 looks as scratched up as they these were made to look and then someone put out with a great print remastered in austria. I ditched my scratched up one and bought the newer one.  Why?  because films don't start out that way. And when I saw grindhouse movies at the drive in or a cheap theater back when they  didn't start out trashed often. They wore them down sure but I would go to them when they first came out.  However the spirit of those 70's and 80's grinders is alive in the movies themselves for sure and for that I love them. I could have done without the scratches and I was grateful to get the scratchfree nagative print , it's so much better than the scratched up one although the machete trailer is not on that option it's still on the other regular option so you can laugh at that one still. Of course low budget gh stuff is unintentially funny and this movie captures the whole experience completely. Low budget horror is like this no film critic would ever give most horror more than a few stars so I put them in their own five star ratings how good is a low budget film in regards to others of it's type?  Anyways this movie is alot of fun and laced with humour of purpose whereas most gh was dead on serious (but funny sometimes because it's so over the top)  unlike lets say giallo movies which is like gh but more slasher and was huge during the 70's too. Anyways this blu ray version shines and I am glad I got it and if you are a fan of gh get it. Or even if you look down on gh films get it because it's wild and funny and could fit right in with any drive in movie of that lost era.  The blu ray has extras galore on two discs and is well worth owning.</p></br><a href="../users/A1A69DJ2KPU4CH.html">A1A69DJ2KPU4CH</a><br/><p>Words can barely express how much I love this movie. It has to be one of the best horror/zombie movies ever made. There isn't a bad performance in this movie, the blood and gore is over the top, and you will lose count of the hysterical one-liners throughout. One minute you're busting out laughing, the next you're watching a zombie rip someone's intestines out.<br /><br />What I love about this movie is how honest it is. It doesn't try to be something it's not; it's not deep, philosophical, or thought provoking. There is no hidden message or hidden agenda, it's just pure balls to the walls blood, gore, action, suspense, and plenty of laughs. Even though there isn't much of a plot to speak of, and even though there is hardly any character development, you actually care about these characters and their well-being. The reason you care about them is because they are so unique, quirky, and interesting. These aren't cardboard cutout, throw-away characters who you won't remember the minute after they're killed. No dopey teenagers in this movie, except for the Mexican twin sisters who coincidental were the only characters I could have done without.<br /><br />This film is definitely a modern day grindhouse film, and manages to capture the feel of 70's/early 80's grindhouse movies, right down to the grainy film and occasional missing real. I love it!<br /><br />You can tell everyone involved with the movie had a great time making it, and that completely comes through in the performances. It's just a fun movie that doesn't take itself seriously and doesn't require the viewer take it seriously either. I have a feeling Gen X'rs will appreciate this film far more than Gen Y's as many of us remember the real grindhouse movies of our youth. It's like a trip down memory lane if you were into those kinds of films when you were younger (which I was!). The humor will probably go right over the heads of tweens, but if you're a fan of grindhouse, horror, and humor you simply have to get this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A6VXZ1EEPRTLV.html">A6VXZ1EEPRTLV</a><br/><p>Directors Robert Rodriguez and close friend Quentin Tarentino, conceived `Grindhouse' as a theatrical double feature salute to 70's exploitation cinema, featuring Rodriguez's film Planet Terror, and Tarentino's Death Proof.<br /><br />Planet Terror is a fun, and campy romp, that even with some significant gaps in the plot, stays pretty much on track up to its explosive conclusion.  It's a not unfamiliar story, where a chemical weapon produces horrific results, with a band of survivors battling to stay alive.<br /><br />The strong cast is led by Rose McGowan who takes on the physically demanding role of Cherry.  Freddy Rodriguez is the mysterious Wray, a man with an assortment of deadly skills.  Michael Biehn, Josh Brolin, Marley Shelton, Naveen Andrews, Jeff Fahey, Tom Savini, and Michael Parks, all excel at playing some rather unusual characters.  Topping it off are appearances by Bruce Willis, and Mr. Tarentino himself, as dedicated military men on very different missions.<br /><br />There is a wealth of information in Rodriguez's commentary track, and the bonus materials on Disc 2.  John Carpenter is repeatedly mentioned as an influence.  Casting was done with a minimal script, and Rodriguez then finished the screenplay, writing with the actors that he had cast in mind.  The decision to make Cherry a dancer, and open the film boldly with her performing on stage, is a character embellishment that many will appreciate, as Ms. McGowan certainly has the moves down.  The reasons for using the `missing reel' ploy are explained, and though it jumps the action to the middle of a firefight, whether it makes for a `better' story is open to discussion.  The feature '10 Minute Film School' reveals how many of the special effects were accomplished.  Other featurettes highlight the cast, including some unlikely members from Rodriguez's real life.  It's not mentioned, but when Cherry has a minigun attached to her leg, it appears that more of her real leg remains than was previously shown.<br /><br />The film was shortened to make it more suitable for the theatrical release.  This expanded version contains some additional scenes that fill in a few of the gaps.  Some may feel that an incompletely developed story, detracts a bit from the film's luster, while for others it may not be an issue.  Either way, Planet Terror gets mostly positive marks as a fun film, with some cool action scenes, and the machine gun legged Cherry is hard to forget.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LBAC84TLIGAX.html">A1LBAC84TLIGAX</a><br/><p>Planet Terror quite simply is an UNBELIEVABLY AWESOME ZOMBIE FILM! This is one of the most violent, most bizarre, and most action-packed zombie films ever made. It's bloody, it has a cast of demented characters, lots of guns, a hot one-legged woman with a gun for a leg, and it even has a small guest appearance from Tom Savini (The make-up and gore effects maker for Romero's Dead franchise, and makes small guest appearances in both Dawn of the Dead films). What is there not to love about this film?<br />WHAT IT'S ABOUT: When a container is broken, a deadly gas is released and it starts turning people in the nearby town into the hungry undead. Now a rogue group of survivors must kill their way through the undead and fight off another group from killing them. The cast of characters is insane. One is girl with a gun for a leg, a woman who is a former doctor who has obsession with needles and likes women, a criminal who is a very good shot with his guns, a man obsessed with keeping his barbeque recipe secret, a cop who hates the criminal, two angry and abusive twin sisters, an owner of strip club, and a man who cuts the balls off of  his enemies and keeps them in jars or bags, and even crazier characters are in this film.<br />MUSIC: This film has music similar to films from the 70's, and it fits the mood quite well.<br />ACTION: The film has a grainy quality to it like a 70's film. This film is very bloody, loaded with blood, guts, and severed limbs all over the place. This film is also loaded with shootouts and mature material that certainly earns the Unrated label. This is no film for kids for its mature material and disgusting bloody violence. This film is absolutely awesome, but is only for adults.<br />ACTING: This is an all-star cast, and with them comes great acting with their roles. I loved the actors and I loved the demented characters they played.<br />OVERALL: Fantastic! Nearly perfect! A must-have for any zombie fanatic.<br />THE GOOD: Lots of blood, lots of guts, lots of guns, great acting, great storytelling, lots of action, the 70's retro feel, and the mock trailer for the mock film Machete (Really funny and vulgar).<br />THE BAD: Some scenes go a little too far over the top.</p></br><a href="../users/A5TZXWU8AALIC.html">A5TZXWU8AALIC</a><br/><p>The GRINDHOUSE experience, as portrayed in this double offering of PLANET TERROR and DEATH PROOF, stirs up more confusion than nostalgia.  The authentic clips introducing the fake Coming Attractions hits the mark perfectly!  WEREWOLF WOMEN OF THE S.S. is dead on.  The echoing, minimalist voice over for the THANKSGIVING trailer is perfect.<br /><br />But the movies themselves end up being too schizo to really evoke the 1970s drive-in "grindhouse" experience.<br /><br />First of all, you have an A-list production of special effects, photography, etc....but they added scratched film effects.  Both films appear to be in the present when bell-bottom pants, big porn moustaches and horrible 70's hair would've worked better than the scratched film effect.<br /><br />And, really, most modern movies are this "bad"...or worse.  Is PLANET TERROR really that different than the monthly zombie movies we're getting all the time?  The gore and the violence are as bloody and grotesque as anything else we're getting a steady diet of.  RESIDENT EVIL, 28 DAYS LATER, "WHATEVER" OF THE DEAD, etc.  I know the rifle attached to Rose McGowan's leg is supposed to be so over-the-top that it's funny...but aren't all the other modern movies this stupid that it doesn't seem so extreme?  It really didn't seem that out of place these days.<br /><br />Still, PLANET TERROR is far more entertaining than DEATH PROOF, although the zombie thing has been (literally) done to death.  How about doing a parody of ABBOTT & COSTELLO MEET THE DAWN OF THE DEAD?  Now there you'd have something that wouldn't look like everything else these days.<br /><br />(And can Quentin Tarantino look any creepier in his cameos?  His role as "The Rapist" in PLANET TERROR was mercifully brief, but he just comes off as a creepy bartender in DEATH PROOF surrounded by sideshow freaks between shots of hot chicks and their feet.)</p></br><a href="../users/AAECAHBNP1VD2.html">AAECAHBNP1VD2</a><br/><p>If you know Rodriguez going into this, you'll enjoy the film. Just suspend all disbelief and watch. As many have said, there are girls and gore galore, but there's more too. Rodriuguez has given us a sort of homage to zombie flicks while again walking the difficult edge between comedy and horror for almost the whole film. To that end, a lot of the cast are incredibly effective, especially Bruce Willis who (likely intentionally) overacts outrageously, Josh Brolin, and Freddy Rodriguez. Rose McGowan is also near-perfect in her role; a great actor wasn't required, just an effective one. To describe much of the film is to ruin it for someone who hasn't seen it. Definitely worth a watch or maybe two. If you're a Rodriguez fan, just buy it. The extras are nice, too.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DAOL3NMHEPLS.html">A1DAOL3NMHEPLS</a><br/><p>Well, I finally got around to watching this movie and I was kind of disappointed.

Loved Rose McGowan; she's super-hot and comes across as a sharp, funny lady. Otherwise, I found the movie kind of tiring after a while. I'd give it 2.5 stars if Amazon allowed half-star ratings.</p></br><a href="../users/A18MBO1U4DPY20.html">A18MBO1U4DPY20</a><br/><p>Planet Terror is a satire.

I thought it was terrible to honest especially cause I loved Death Proof. Now, you're laughing thinking I'm the only person who probably liked Death Proof more. Planet Terror is like a flaky irritating push on all action films that have been made. It tries to be clever but then even Scary Movie tried.<br /><br />Overall, a 5/10<br />Bruce Willis has no role, Naveen Andrews is after testicles in the film (!) and the storyline is just a sham. The sort of film I don't want to be reminded of. Even the average 28 Weeks Later was better.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LGT6UZL99IW1.html">A3LGT6UZL99IW1</a><br/><p>Look, when I plop down $$ to see a flick, or pay even more $$$ to purchase the DVD - especially when it's by these director's, I don't want art.  I want entertainment.  If I want art, I'll let my girlfriend pick the flick.  I want entertainment and action.  Death Proof was just plain painful to endure.<br /><br />Planet terror, part two of the double billing, is fun, but I could do without the fake file burn, missing reel, scratched, color washes and the like.  The cameo appearances are cool, and the gunfights are typical of the old drive-ins:  a revolver shoots 20 rounds, etc.  I hardly used the >> button at all. The movie unabashedly rips off zombie flicks, Samurai Jack (The Scotsman's Machine Gun Leg), and others - just like those old films did.<br /><br />I've wasted more money on worse movies.  If you like zombie flicks, Bruce Willis, or strippers with full-auto appendages, then this is an enjoyable way to spend around 80 minutes.<br /><br />The fake trailer for Machete was fantastic - especially the bike mounted Vulcan mingun!</p></br><a href="../users/AYWSFRCIMOAYE.html">AYWSFRCIMOAYE</a><br/><p>No wonder it is called pulp movie.

First off, its a take off of an old B rate movie, the simulated poor film quality and editing.  With all the movie technology and graphics and film options, I don't want to see and old choppy/scratchy film.  If I wanted that, I'll rent attack of the Killer tomatos, or planet of the apes, something classic, not simulated.  Second off, Its a zombie movie, what the heck.  Nothing fancier than a B rate zombie movie.  I guess there must be a market for this Artsy stuff, or the film wouldn't have been made.  I guess I am to sober of a person to "catch the buzz" about this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A29R3O02O0PON4.html">A29R3O02O0PON4</a><br/><p>Well, I think my title says it all.<br /><br />"Planet Terror"...Robert Rodriguez's first half of the experimental 2007 Grindhouse experience.  As the cliche goes...before you go in leave your brain at the door.  But in this case, that could be taken literally (as one scene in the film will explain that.)<br /><br />Anyway, is this film good?  No, not really.  Its premise is just as stupid as countless other Seventies Grindhouse-style films.  But what makes this one different is that it was made in the digital film age, so the special and visual effects are better than those achieved 30-40 years ago.  Of course, the aging, scratching, and even film melting effects are put in it intentially which actually disguises it to the point of it being such a bad movie thus making it somewhat of an instant classic.</p></br><a href="../users/A3E975KR2HRERX.html">A3E975KR2HRERX</a><br/><p>but ol' roddy boy had to show his True colors in regards to (S)outh (O)f the (B)order problems, with the Murders, Kidnappings-leading to Murder after the monies recieved-, coyotes running up SOBs into America, drug running of CRACK cocaine, etc. That's barely mentioned in main Slime media and this happens like it does in france!

A throwback to the B-movie nastiness of the 1970s, the flick centres of a group of survivors, including a mysterious drifter, El Wray (Rodriguez), a solicitous stripper (McGowan) and a doctor desperate to escape her possessive husband (Shelton) - all of whom are immune to a toxic gas that is making the majority of the town hungry for blood and guts. They must fight off the zombies using seemingly every weapon imaginable, to endure the night and get safely to Mexico. Easily the strongest part of the proposed double-feature, Planet Terror is a horror film very much in the vein of earlier Rodriguez cult classic From Dusk Till Dawn - inexplicably entertaining and cheesy at the same time. However, some of the dialogue feels tongue-in-cheek, while other scenes are played arrow-straight and suffer as a consequence. Rodriguez is widely-regarded as one of the most innovative directors working today, and if Planet Terror does nothing else, it proves that point unequivocally.</p></br><a href="../users/A2A6NH6DPE0VXR.html">A2A6NH6DPE0VXR</a><br/><p>Planet Terror is Robert Rodriguez's best movie since Shark Boy and Lava Girl....j/k I mean his best since Sin City lol. It's about a gas that's released on the world that turns people into zombies. What seperates this from other recent zombie films though is the great cast and the great action and b-movie goofiness.<br /><br />  Rose McGowan has been good in movies like Scream but she shines here more than she has in other movies. She also wasn't bad in Quinten Tarantino's Death Proof. But here she steals the show as an extremely sexy stripper that loses a leg due to a zombie attack. She soon is transformed into the toughest chick with one leg when El Wray (Freddy Rodr&iacute;guez) gives her a gun for a leg.<br /><br />  Of course you also have people like Bruce Willis, Josh Brolin, Marley Shelton, Nicky Katt and Naveen Andrews in good form. But what I also love about the movie is that it casted Michael Biehn (Terminator, Aliens) as the sheriff and Jeff Fahey (LawnmowerMan) as his cook brother. Although he's the sheriff, Biehn also wants a recipe that his brother won't give him. Anyway what I like about them being in the movie is that they haven't been in many in years. Although I hear Fahey will be in Lost season 4 which is pretty cool. Now if only they had a part for Biehn lol. What I'd also like is another Grindhouse double feature but that probably won't happen since for some reason the Planet Terror and Death Proof combination didn't do fantastic in theaters.</p></br><a href="../users/ADLVFFE4VBT8.html">ADLVFFE4VBT8</a><br/><p>What more is there to say about what, in my view, is a brilliant, unashamed exploitation zombie movie that's already a classic? Yes, I know, the Grindhouse double-feature didn't too so well in the theaters but maybe the public wasn't yet ready for such advance cinematographic material. Maybe it still isn't and maybe it will never be. I know that I will never get myself tired of anything Tarantino or Tarantino-related and a movie where Tarantino, if fact plays a part and it's supposed to be the B-movie to Quentin's 'Death Proof' is a Tarantino movie to me (sorry, Robert Rodriguez). Just for the fun of name-dropping, did you know that Fergie (yes THAT Fergie) ends up eaten here? That Bruce Willis falls flat on the floor, as it decomposes? That Carlos Gallardo (El Mariachi) plays the main gunslinger? That Robert Rodriguez kills (the character played by ) his own preschool son - his son plays a part where he ends up dead. That his real-life family doctor actually plays a doctor? There's so much to learn and talk about and it's all on second disk's extra but Rose McGowan absolutely steals the show. She played a relatively short part in Death Proof but her Planet Terror role is likely to be the role of her lifetime. She's simply perfect, sensational, stunningly beautiful and deadly accurate when it comes to shooting with that leg-mounted machine gun.<br /><br />But, I wasn't planning to talk much about the movie itself. I only wanted to make some brief remarks about the Blu-ray edition of Planet Terror.<br /><br />To my surprise, Planet Terror goes a lot farther than any of the previous Tarantino-related (yes, I know, it's Robert Rodriguez) Blu-ray releases in actually taking advantage of the Blu-ray technology. A lot farther than Death Proof, Kill Bill or Reservoir Dogs.<br /><br />Disk one, has TWO versions of the movie. The 'scratched' original and, surprisingly (because Death Proof lacks it) a mostly 'clean' copy. In addition to the 'regular' and the traditional 'commentary' sound track it's possible to select the 'audience reaction track' (available on the 'scratched' version only. Interestingly, the 'clean' version does not include the 'Machete Man' introduction.<br /><br />The sound track is Dolby TrueHD or Dolby 5.1 in English and it is so on both the 'regular' and the 'audience reaction' tracks. French and Spanish tracks are also available in Dolby 5.1 only. Subtitles are English or Spanish but not in French.<br /><br />As it is the case with Death Proof, BD Live is one of the options listed as a 'special feature' but, when selected, you are told to that it is not available at this time and to 'check back later'.<br /><br />The second disk is full of rather interesting featurettes. There's an 11 minute one titled '10-minute film school' where Robert Rodriguez talks about the making of the movie, there are shorts on 'the gals' and the 'boys', extras on the special effects, trailers, etc., etc., etc. and, to my surprise, the quality of extras is quite decent.<br /><br />Briefly: it goes a long way but not 'all the way' toward taking advantage of Blu-ray, some of the options and features implementation are confusing (see above), for reasons impossible to comprehend it claims to have BD Live but it does not, the second disk, full of extras is actually worth watching.<br /><br />This edition earns its 4 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A370Z6I5GBWU44.html">A370Z6I5GBWU44</a><br/><p>This movie might not be for everyone, but for those who love fun horror romps, this is a treat! With a interesting premise, characters, and some awesome action scenes, I have enjoyed this movie immensely. Just be careful of the gore - there's a fair amount of it and definitely not for the squeamish.<br /><br />One thing to remember - if you have a gun for a leg, you can kick @55 anytime!</p></br><a href="../users/AXV9GS0TMSVW.html">AXV9GS0TMSVW</a><br/><p>I had the pleasure of seeing Grindhouse the way it was meant to be seen and in a theature it was meant to be seen in - the Alamo Drafthouse - with real grindhouse trailers playing as preshow entertainment.  The whole thing amounted to a great theatrical experience - one that hasn't been able to be replicated on video - here in the US at least.<br /><br />So we are left with two seperate releases.  Planet Terror fares better on its own.  Even though its left without its partner in crime, its still an homage to the old Grindhouse flicks.  It exploits the over top horror, stylized shots, and campiness of those films.  It does one better by having a higher quality and because unlike those films, which mustered up cheap shots in order to get tickets sold, the creator is out to deliver a fun film.  Rose Macgowan gets a gun for a leg!  Freddy Rodriguez is really good with guns!  And just wait til you see what happens to special effects expert Tom Savini!<br /><br />Still, on its own, there are some issues.  Notably, the film is almost too long.  The "exteneded and unrated" notification is to be taken almost as a warning.  A lot of the so called "unrated" scenes, were cut for pacing.  They don't add anything really.  A sad testament to this was Robert Rodriguez's commentary, as he states several times that scenes were cut for good reasons.  Still, this is a fun film.  However, if you can't wait for the inevitable proper cut in the US on DVD, have some dinero and a multiregion DVD player, Grindhouse can be experienced properly via the 6 disc editon available at Amazon's Japanese site.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ROE64EVHDTTV.html">A3ROE64EVHDTTV</a><br/><p>The Good Things:<br />*Good, exciting, engaging story with lots of action.<br />*No shortage of violence and gore; fans of blood and guts should be satisfied with this.<br />*Some action scenes are downright awesome (like when Cherry uses her leg-gun to kill a bunch of zombies...).<br />*Characters are good.<br />*Dialogue is good.<br />*Music is great.<br /><br />The Bad Things:<br />*This is definately the grossest movie I have ever seen.  Lots of gut-ripping, heads-exploding, brain-eating, torrents-of-blood, melting tallywackers, and other gross bits all over the place.<br />*Also lots of disturbing tidbits (but could also be good, because it makes the film edgy).<br />*Some campiness and plenty of parts that are very absurd (but this could be a good thing, because it's stylish and entertaining).<br />*All of the movie is made to look old on purpose (which I think is good, because it's adds some interesting effects and serves as homage to 70s films (and older "Grindhouse" films)).<br /><br />At last, a zombie movie that's not overly dreary, dumb, or boring! Much like "Sin City," this film is an action flick with lots of blood and gore, but with none of the seriousness of "Dawn of the Dead" or "28 Days Later." Instead, you can have fun with this one.  It may not be as deep or intelligent as other zombie movies, but it still has good characters, some suspense, and a pretty good story.  Highly reccomended for anybody who likes blood and gore, zombie movies, or absurd movies (like "Sin City" or "Shoot 'Em Up").<br /><br />This feature was released alongside with "Death Proof," which is sold separately (but I think $20.00 is still good enough for one good movie).</p></br><a href="../users/AD0J5KK4WQXNS.html">AD0J5KK4WQXNS</a><br/><p>Planet Terror is the sort of the film that you enjoy because you know that the actors and producers had probably more fun making it than you do watching it. There is a lot to like about Robert Rodriguez' new horror film which is just a usual run-of-the-chemical-factory zombie movie with a budget. Those who remember the zombie flicks of the 1980s, which didn't take themselves too seriously, were heavy on the splatter, and got a few laughs along with the high haemoglobin count, will be at home with Planet Terror. Those expecting something of the calibre of the Dawn of the Dead remake will not be so impressed.<br /><br />The cast contains very interesting performances, bringing some dead actors and actresses back to life. Planet Terror plays homage to every movie that has had a trickle of blood in it. There are big nods to Peter Jackson (head splitting gore) and Sam Raimi (the hero is an amputee). It does manage to try and flesh out what could have been paper-thin characters. Even the scene of one brother spilling his barbeque recipe manages a touching moment in a film which thinks having the heroine launch herself into the air from machine-gun-leg-recoil doesn't challenge our fresh brains.<br /><br />In an era of direct-to-shelf bad horror movies, Planet Terror stands out because it does its best to revive the genre.</p></br><a href="../users/A3STFVPM8NHJ7B.html">A3STFVPM8NHJ7B</a><br/><p>I never got the chance to see this in theaters and I wish they left the movie like it was. The movie itself was a decent flick. Lots of big name stars who didnt really seem to gel with the type of movie. Fergie? come on. Dont look for the meaning of life in this film. Just action, gore, and a few laughs. I was bored during the middle of the film but the end was pretty over the top. They say on the back cover one of the most memorable screen heroines ever. Considering she is that for the last fifteen minutes, id disagree. It was cool character but not something i'd watch a awhole movie about. Pretty good if you just want senseless killing and lots of blood.</p></br><a href="../users/A1COW0UIB5HA9J.html">A1COW0UIB5HA9J</a><br/><p>A deadly military experiment is accidently released as a gas turns some of the soliders into vicious flesh-eating mutant zombie-esque ghouls that begin to spread a virus through their bite that can turn people into the same creatures. Sexy stripper Cherry Darling (Rose Mcgowan) whom just got her leg ripped apart by those creatures joins forces with a maverick (Freddy Rodriguez), a female smuggler (Naveen Andrews), a restraunt owner (Jeff Fahry) and a female doctor (Mary Shelton) as they must battle every one of those abominations and find out what is behind all this madness.<br /><br />Co-starring Bruce Willis, Tom Savini, Quentin Tarantino and Josh Brolin this is an electrifying and funny Sci-fi horror action packed rollercoaster ride of a film. Writer-director-producer Robert Rodriguez ("Sin City", "Desperado", "El Mariachi" and "From Dusk Till Dawn") with producer and co-star Quentin Tarantino have conjured up the best of the two stories on 2007's experimental cinematic flick "Grindhouse". It's got lots of great performances including some 70's 16mm style grainy filming including a brief missing reel part to make it seem like the audience is in a grindhouse theater, i also love how the heroine in this movie is very sexy yet original as she's like no other heroine to hit film before yet she kicks ace. This movie is loaded with non-stop action and graphic scenes of gore such as castration, cannibalism, exploding heads, brains exposed including everything but the kitchen sink.<br /><br />This 2-Disc Blu-Ray set offers awesome surround picture and sound that will rock your home-theater as it's presented in it's uncut and extended version with footage not shown in theaters. There's some great extras like audio commentary, audience reaction track, Trailer, additional scratch free version, BD-live, 10 minute film school featurette, featurettes, reel of casting and poster gallery.<br /><br />Also recommended: "Night of the Living Dead (1968 and 1990)", "Re-Animator", "Dawn of the Dead (1978 and 2004)", "Day of the Dead (1985)", "Return of the Living Dead 1 2 and 3", "The Hills Have Eyes (2006)", "Dead Alive (a.k.a.

Of course, it won't do much for your mind -- unlike some grindhouse flicks that play with intriguing subtexts underneath all of the shock-inducing and exploitation schlock -- Robert Rodriguez just wants to ramp up the insanity step by step, piling up absurd but effective and increasingly over the top gory elements until, after the climax, it all ends on a strangely sentimental note.<br /><br />The plot, for what its worth, is cobbled together to create maximum opportunity for thrills and mayhem.  There's a stripper who gets her leg bitten off, only to have it replaced by a prosthetic machine gun/rocket launcher.  Her lover is a tow truck driver who is really the incognito of a superheroic and psychotic gun-wielder.  There's an anaesthesiologist mother on a rampage with hypodermic needles when her husband tried to kill her after her lesbian lover shows up half eaten in the hospital.  Throw in a Texas barbecue king, a jealous sheriff and a bunch of less than fully competent deputies, two crazy Latina twins, a cowardly stripclub owner, into a small town where a military operation gone bad has released a poisonous gas that turns men and women into highly infectious flesh-crazed rot-faced cannibals.  What have you got?  Mayhem, exploding bodies, exploding cars, zombie action, leering men, attractive women alternating between nails tough and sexy.<br /><br />The thing I liked least in both Grindhouse films were the cameos by filmmakers.  In Death Proof, both Tarantino and Eli Roth show up and Roth plays (badly, since he can't really act, and it does him a favor to assume he is trying to act because if he is really like the character he plays on screen, he's a real ... well, you know) an extremely despicable and loathsome misogynist; in this one Tarantino himself plays (once again, badly -- while he is a very competent director who knows how to get intriguing performances from his actors I've never seen any indications that Tarantino himself can do more than bluster on screen, but I'm pretty sure that is acting because from what I know of him he strikes me as very likely more decent and certainly more self-aware than the characters he plays on screen) another despicable character with a gun, prepared to use it to enable himself to act out the macho woman-hating fantasies that Roth's character talked about.  He played a similarly psychotic character in that roadhouse vampire flick that he and Rodriguez made (From Dusk Till Dawn) -- I'm not quite sure why he likes to use himself as a mouthpiece for the most vile and disgusting references to women that appear in their films.  Is it ironic self-critique or is it narcissistic opportunism: the chance to play out a fantasy of perversion under the guise of ironic self-critique?  I can't tell.<br /><br />Anyhow, once again, Rodriguez shows himself to be a visually inventive genius who knows how to make the most of a moderate budget but is once again apparently wasting his talents on entertaining but ultimately ephemeral material.  I guess this is what he likes -- so all power to him.  For my part, with the possible exception of Spy Kids (which is one of the better and more engaging children's action films, in part because the Latino sensibility that pervades it brings a freshness to what could have been a pretty generic plot) and maybe Sin City (in which the original material has a haunting texture that he is able to bring to life), I don't think he has lived up to his promise and potential (unlike Tarantino, whose films bring both intelligence, and a wide understanding of cinema culture, to his grindhouse sensibility).  Here's hoping Rodriguez's next film will be both visually exciting and at least somewhat stimulating for the brain (and stimulating in some other way than like the green gas that induces a zombified hunger for blood and mindless thrills).</p></br><a href="../users/A1AYN3IIUNQCIA.html">A1AYN3IIUNQCIA</a><br/><p>Like i mentioned in my previous review for Death Proof, i have no problem with them releasing the films seperatly but my one thing is with the exclusion of the hilarious trailers. And then when i found out they weren't going to be on this DVD either, now i'm pissed off. but other then that, the movie, Planet Terror, is by far the better half of the Grindhouse feature.<br />The action takes place in a small town where a goverment faction has been conducting experiments that turn the dead into the undead. Now a small group of townsfolk must fight through the zombie hordes and make it to safty.<br />Now, this is the film i think really captured the whole Grindhouse experince. while Death Proof seemed to have given up on the whole experince about halfway through the film, Planet Terror makes full use of the whole fun of the Grindhouse. with its grainy picture, missing reels, outrageous plot elements, it was honestly one of the most fun i had at the movies.<br />Like i said before, i do hope they release the movies in one single DVD set, trailers and all, with loads of extras. But until then, for those of you who can't wait to see the films, two options. rent the two films at your video store and watch them back to back. or if you can't wait, get Planet Terror and stave of getting Death Proof until the deluxe edition comes out (if ever). I promise you, Planet Terror will have you laughing, pukeing, and at the edge of your seat all at the same time.</p></br><a href="../users/AK0CENM3LUM28.html">AK0CENM3LUM28</a><br/><p>Planet Terror / 796029803878<br /><br />*Spoilers*<br /><br />If there's one thing I like more than zombie movies, it's parodies of zombie movies. "Planet Terror" delivers in a huge way, by spoofing just about everything you could hope for.<br /><br />Just because this is a hilarious parody/comedy doesn't mean it's for kids, though. There's a lot of disturbing material here, often more disturbing because it's humans behaving badly, rather than simply zombies doing what zombies do. In one of the most horrific cinema scenes I've ever scene, a young boy shoots himself because he is too young to responsibly handle a gun (or he doesn't feel capable of being saddled with the instruction to kill anyone who approaches - even his abusive father). In another scene, an attempted rape comes to a disturbing halt due to the inability of the would-be rapist to maintain...structural integrity of his melting genitals. This isn't exactly light-viewing we're talking about.<br /><br />Yet as a deconstruction of the genre, "Planet Terror" is superb. Every trick in the director's book is used with hilarious effect, including a false "missing film" / "intermission" during which all the introductory misunderstandings and usual "coming to grips with the situation" material all occurs without the audience being privy to the material. This is a particularly nice touch, in my opinion, since the "let's face it - they're zombies" speech really has nothing new to contribute at this point anymore.<br /><br />If there is a downside to this movie, it is that Rose McGowan receives her leg-weaponry far later in the film than previews would have viewers believe - but every second afterwards is golden, climaxing in a truly hilarious ending that will have all zombie fans rolling on the floor laughing. If you like zombie movies, and like making light of them, "Planet Terror" is for you.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>Because of a totally awful local theater, we never got the full "Grindhouse" experience with 2 films and several fake trailers. Not that it mattered since most people avoided the film anyway, proving that great ideas for film geeks don't mean a thing to Joe Casual Moviegoer. I watched the film's second half "Death Proof" done by Quentin Tarantino and found it kind of a bore with a car crash and a thrilling chase being the highlights. Now we have "Planet Terror" done by Robert Rodriguez which is probably some of the most fun you can have in a movie, theater or otherwise.<br /><br />Cherry, a former go-go dancer with dreams of being a standout comedian, meets her ex Wray who has a mysterious past. Elsewhere, husband and wife Michael and Dakota are going through some marriage problems with Dakota being unfaithful. However, they will all meet when a viral infection hits town, turning the unlucky into pus-covered crazies with a taste for humans so they all, as well as the local sheriff, a barbecue cook and a scientist, need to escape town before they become lunch.<br /><br />"Death Proof" talked a lot about things evoking the feeling of old 70's cinema but as a film it just felt empty with a bunch of characters talking, and talking (and talking) with each segment bookended by a great sequence. "Planet Terror" on the other hand feels like an exploitation film would feel like: it's campy funny, it's campy gory but vastly entertaining. Deaths are disgusting yet a level of fun is injected to not make them too overtly violent. We also have the print which has been intentionally altered to have print flaws, scratches, image which seems to pulse and even a image burning up, revealing the "missing reel" which isn't included since it was always part of the joke that it was missing.<br /><br />Whereas Grindhouse's second half had unsympathetic characters but anchored by a great Kurt Russell performance, here it's basically's Rose McGowan's show and everybody else is just appearing in it. Sympathetic, believable yet able to kick undead (or whatever they are) ***, she's the scene stealer here. But then again we have Freddy Rodriguez who's finally used more than he was in Poseidon and Lady in the Water; Michael Biehn, James Brolin and Marley Shelton also appear as well as Naveen Andrews of Lost fame and Bruce Willis. The only weak link strangely is Tarantino playing a soldier/rapist who kind of hams it up a bit.<br /><br />To be honest I always found Sin City aesthetically pleasing but kind of emotionally-inert with one-note characters besides Mickey Rourke. While I'm not sure if I can call this Rodriguez's best film, it's certainly one of his most entertaining on par with Desperado.</p></br><a href="../users/AIMR915K4YCN.html">AIMR915K4YCN</a><br/><p>PLANET TERROR is a grand tribute to all things drive-in, 70s, and exploitive!

Always looking for a new place to stick a gun, he is one of the few directors who can grab a genre and re-energize it; This movie is just fun all around; I found it much more entertaining than Deathproof(too much talking for me...), and seemed to capture that style, camp, and look of the 70's exploitation movie just a little better. I loved alot in Deathproof, but felt it could have lost a little more in the editing room, made it a little tighter... Rodriguez keeps the quirky talk and moves us right along with it; Way over the top, ultra violent, and some things you may not have seen in a movie before(everyone knows about the machinegun leg by now, but I think it's a first!).

Largely, it's because of dudes like Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Taratino, both of whom go their own way and offer up something that's so distinctively theirs that their names have become name brands for a certain type of film. When they collaborated on GRINDHOUSE, I knew it was gonna be something outrageous and offbeat, something decidedly unhomogeneous. With fanboy nudges and winks galore, these two maverick directors take us back to 1970s shlock with their gleefully offensive homage. In its sheer excess and blatantly hokey sensibilities, their efforts pull no punches. The audience is treated to crass, old school sensationalism, incidental nudity, fake-looking geysers of blood, and rampant and visceral disembowelment. I loved the hell out of it. In their simulation of that grungy sensation one feels when in them cruddy, shady theaters of old, Rodriguez and Tarantino willfully insert scratches on the print, projector miscues, sound goofs, and bad dubbing. We even have title cards apologizing for missing reels, which occur in the most inconvenient of times. My neighbor, who is old as dirt and had also frequented this film, remarked that that exactly was what it was like when he attended those low-rent, B-movie playhouses of yesteryear. I realize that this DVD only has PLANET TERROR, but I'm stubborn enough to not split the two films. I'll be mentioning both as watching them back-to-back in the theater enriched my original viewing experience. The double-feature bill trots out Rodriguez's PLANET TERROR and Tarantino's DEATH PROOF. Let's start with PLANET TERROR or, as I like to call it, Rodriguez's cheesily apocalyptic PLANET TERROR.<br /><br />THE film title alone is reminiscent of many of those old time, sci-fi/horror B-movies. The plot centers around a mass zombie attack. We witness humanity's last stand as embodied by a one-legged go-go dancer (played with jaded brusqueness by Rose McGowan), her inexplicably lethal boyfriend (Freddie Rodriguez), an adulterous, needles-touting nurse, and a few others. It's a cup overflowing with campy dialogue and over-the-top, hilariously staged horror and action sequences. It also offers up a print that is marvelously grimy and grainy, and Rodriguez himself comes up with a pretty effective John Carpenter-like synthetic score which helps to drive the storyline. By the way, creature make-up artist Tom Savini gets a bit part here as he plays a digit-less deputy, while Naveen Andrews is great fun to watch as a testic1es-collecting bio-engineer. Fun, fun, fun.<br /><br />The second billing is Tarantino's very talky DEATH PROOF, which is a callback to films such as VANISHING POINT, DIRTY MARY, CRAZY LARRY, and the original GONE IN 60 SECONDS (all of which are referenced in this flick). And, if anyone's seen the 1965 flick FASTER, PUSSYCAT! KILL! KILL! then DEATH PROOF will strike a certain familiarity. Kurt Russell does a deliciously villainous turn as the scarred Stuntman Mike who applies his death-proofed vehicle to do away with gorgeous females. But he makes the worst mistake of his life when he picks on fellow stuntperson Zoe Bell (who doubled for Uma Thurman in KILL BILL and who, here, plays herself).<br /><br />With respect to the very natural Zoe Bell and her awesome ship's mast stunt, to me, the one to watch is Sydney Poitier (yes, it's his daughter) who plays the casually sexy Jungle Julia, she of the ravishing feet. Meanwhile, Rosario Dawson again can't help but sizzle on screen, while the very pouty-lipped Vanessa Ferlito... pouts her lips. If you're into extended dialogue which bears that distinctive Tarantino flourish, then the first half of this film is right up your alley because it's all significantly verbal and catered to the gentler sex - "gentler" being qualified here in that f-bombs are dropped with relished abandon. However, if you're an action fan, just wait 'til the second half because, then, Tarantino not only pulls out the stop signs, he smashes you in the mouth with 'em.<br /><br />I have to mention the quartet of coming attraction trailers which ran in the theater. They ranged from the hilarious (MACHETE - "He just f***ed with the wrong Mexican!") to cliched shlock (DON'T and WEREWOLF WOMEN OF THE SS) to vaguely disturbing (I don't even want to know what was going on in Eli Roth's THANKSGIVING). MACHETE's faux trailer was so outrageous that it inspired an actual motion picture. There's also an ad for some kind of Tex-Mex restaurant with dubious shots of its menu samples, which made me queasy just looking at 'em.<br /><br />Rodriguez and Tarantino, in their celebation of exploitation films, inject GRINDHOUSE with their exuberance and subversive humor and their love for shlocky cinema. By doing so, they elevate this film tiers above the basement genre of their intended tribute. Their gifts for crafting cinematic icons are again on display as Cherry Darling, Stuntman Mike, and Zoe Bell - &agrave; la the Bride or El Mariachi - have become film cult figures. At three hours long, yeah, my bum did fall asleep, but it's a small price to pay to gain admittance into blissfully trashy paradise.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AFXJ8U72MD6L.html">A1AFXJ8U72MD6L</a><br/><p>An homage to the zombie genre and old exploitation films. There's some cute moments in here (the one legged woman) but I think I prefer the old original movies flavor wise. This isn't really terrifying and tries to go for the dark humor of the genre and sometimes succeeds. But overall this film made me wanting to watch something else but I was surfing the Web as I did it so it didn't matter too much.

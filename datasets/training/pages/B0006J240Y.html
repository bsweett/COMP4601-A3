As the answer to the puzzle of the missing children is slowly revealed to the viewer, it becomes progressively less believable and ultimately ridiculous. All the tension built up through the first part of the movie is just lost in a predictable and unsatisfactory ending.<br /><br />Having said that, the movie isn't all bad. There were at least 2, maybe 3, scenes that caused the entire theater to leap right out of their seats. It was great to see Alfrie Woodard for the first time in a long time, albeit in a role unworthy of an actress of her talent. The first half of the movie is intriguing, and had the(ultimately unrealized) promise of a fairly good thriller. It was enjoyable as a free sneak-peak, but I'm glad I didn't pay $8 for it.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>THE FORGOTTEN has as many mixed reviews as about any movie of the last season and for folks who like to feel secure about plot lines from beginning to end, that disparity of response is warranted.  But for the casual viewer who just picks up this DVD to view because something  (the cast, the graphics, the tone) appealed, this is a fine little thriller that engages your interest and your compassion and ultimately your mind.<br /><br />It has been 14 months since an airplane with five Brooklyn children went down at sea and Telly (the always impressive Julianne Moore) is still grieving for her lost 9-year-old son Sam.  She savors photographs, memories (in flashback sequences which are about as tender as mother/son relationships have been pictured), and yet cannot let go and move on.  Her husband (Anthony Edwards) is supportive as is her psychiatrist (Gary Sinise), but gradually Telly discovers that photographs and memorabilia of her son Sam have been altered or have disappeared.  Confrontation with her husband results in her being told that she never had a son, that she is delusional, and all of her support systems vanish.  Convinced she is right she encounters Ash (Dominic West) who, though now a drunk, was 'apparently' the single father of Sam's best friend Lauren, although on the surface he denies ever having a child.  Telly finds ways to convince Ash to remember and together they set out on a string of events that leads to occult questions about 'The Experiment' that is apparently known to the FBI (among them Lee Tergesen) but has not convinced the local law enforcement (Alfre Woodward).  Odd creature signs appear (in the character of the alien-like Linus Roache), and Telly and Ash are on the run, determined that their children are alive, and in the end the quest of the 'experiment' to discover the particular bond between mother (or father) and child is strained to the bizarre conclusion.<br /><br />The script by Gerald DiPege and the direction by Joseph Ruben work well in synchrony and though the story may offend viewers who disdain the possibility of life outside the earth's surface, the amount of emphasis on parent/child relationships far outweighs the potential hokiness of the manner in which that aspect of the film is challenged.  Julianne Moore, Dominic West, Alfre Woodward, and Gary Sinise give excellent performances (along with a superb supporting cast) and the commitment these actors display makes the movie solid.  Ease up on credibility issues, go out on a limb,  and take this flight of fantasy as a means to explore larger issues and you'll find this film has more merit than you would expect.

She has a supportive husband (Edwards) and a capable psychologist (Sinise), and is making progress towards acceptance.  Then, suddenly, little things start to happen.  Her car is parked in a different space than where she left it.  A cup of coffee she is drinking disappears.  These events concern her, but it isn't until her son's things start to disappear that she really freaks out.  All of a sudden no one seems to remember her son, although the memories are quite clear to her.  Teaming up with the father of a girl who was killed in the same accident as her son, Telly sets out to figure out just what is going on.  And that is as far as I will go story-wise, because I don't want to give too much away.<br /><br />Moore does a good job as the grieving mother who is determined to get to the bottom of this mystery.  In fact, she gives the stand out performance in this movie.  The special effects, when used are very effective, especially the "snatching" effect seen in the previews.  The story is interesting, but fails somewhere along the way to really make sense.  When everything is revealed, it does not entirely support what has gone before, and the "happy ending" that is tacked onto the end really makes no sense at all...it just serves as a giant "reset button" that seems cheap.  The point of the story is nice though, and that gives it some points in my book.  All in all, I would recommend waiting for DVD on this one.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R6ST52EBN2FK.html">A3R6ST52EBN2FK</a><br/><p>I found this movie to be great and with a cast of some of the best actors.

The film itself is terribly, painfully, slow with an ending that is even more stupid than the ones they had in arthouse 60s science-fiction porn0 flicks.<br /><br />Trash unless you are 10.</p></br><a href="../users/A39AWL2FKWDFK6.html">A39AWL2FKWDFK6</a><br/><p>"The Forgotten" is a forgetable tale surrounding the apparent death in a plane crash of a weepy Julianne Moore's 9 year old son Sam.  In the 14 months since the tragedy Moore has spent her time doting over her beloved son's memory, unable to let go.<br /><br />Things start heating up when items such as pictures, newspaper accounts and videos chronicling Sam's existence begin disappearing.  Moore, of course gets frantic because she's the only one that can acknowledge these vanishing items.  Her husband played by a gruesome looking Anthony Edwards is unsympathetic calling her delusional and claiming that there never was a son.  Moore's shrink played blandly by Gary Sinise agrees threatening hospitalization.<br /><br />Moore thinks she's psychotic until she hooks up with acquaintaince Dominic West, an ex-hockey player whose daughter also apparently perished in the same plane crash.  He unfortunately cannot remember his daughter but with prodding from Moore his memory returns.<br /><br />It soon becomes apparent that there is some sort of clandestine government plot as West and Moore are being pursued by federal agents.  This seems to be orchestrated by a mysterious stranger played by Linus Roache who is imbued with supernatural abilities.<br /><br />This flick represents 96 minutes of uninspired movie making.  The plot is never fully explained and outside of a few startling moments is boring.  The acting is unremarkable except for veteran actress Alfre Woodard who plays a sympathetic New York City detective.<br /><br />My advice is to pass on this one.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>**1/2<br /><br />In "The Forgotten," Julianne Moore plays a grieving mother whose young son was killed in a plane crash less than a year before.  Or was he?  Despite the fact that she has pictures, videotapes and her own memories of the child, we begin to suspect that he might never have existed at all and that she is suffering from a psychotic delusion brought on by a miscarriage years earlier.  The plot becomes more complicated when she meets up with a man whose own daughter may have also perished in the same alleged accident.  Together they search for answers as to why no record remains of their children ever having existed.<br /><br />Despite having some talented performers in the cast, "The Forgotten" is a gimmicky thriller that telegraphs its solution early on.  Even Moore - who seems to be slumming a bit after all her work in high-toned features over the past several years ("Far From Heaven," "The Hours" etc.) - can't overcome all the paranoid-thriller cliches that come to dominate the screenplay:  the couple on the run from nameless terrors, the sympathetic and credulous investigator, the subsidiary characters who may be part of an elaborately worked out conspiracy and hoax.  The movie has individual moments of intrigue and suspense, but the plot holes are legion and the resolution lacks any significant wallop or punch.<br /><br />With a story as unmemorable as the one we have here, could the title actually be referring to the movie itself?</p></br><a href="../users/A3O536E2YOKK4Y.html">A3O536E2YOKK4Y</a><br/><p>Written by Gerald Di Pego and released in 2004, "The Forgotten" relays the story of Telly (Julianne Moore), a mother who discovers all traces of her deceased 9 year-old son have been erased, including photos, videos, documents and the memories of other people. Her psychologist (Gary Sinise) and husband tell her she's delusional, but she KNOWS otherwise. Thus begins a thrilling search for the truth where she teams up with Ash (Dominic West) whose daughter seems to have been erased from memory as well. They end up tangling with National Security Agents and more.<br /><br />I almost missed out on "The Forgotten" because of the very conflicting reviews. Two reliable reviewers gave the film 5/5 Stars, whereas other intelligent reviewers give it 1 Star. The reactions couldn't be more opposite, which isn't necessarily a bad thing since some of the best artistic items polarize opinion. In any event, I'm glad I decided to give it a chance because this is a powerful picture.<br /><br />In style, "The Forgotten" is very similar to "The Mothman Prophesies;" so if you like that film, you'll likely appreciate this one. There are similarities to The X-Files with the two protagonists, including a female redhead, searching for the truth in what is essentially a sci-fi/mystery tale. I've seen over a handful X-Files episodes in my day and I can honestly tell you that "The Forgotten" blows those segments out of the water. Don't get me wrong, the show's okay, just a tad overrated and boring IMHO. Gillian Anderson was the only noteworthy part of the show to me. (If you're a fan of the show, I'm not here to argue with you. People have different tastes).<br /><br />I'm not a super Julianne Moore fan, but I'd take her rather than leave her. What really works is her team-up with Dominic West. These two have phenomenal chemistry together.<br /><br />Because of the highly mixed reviews I was watching the first 15 minutes only half-attentive, but when Telly (Moore) confronts Ash (West) and subsequently teams up with him my attention immediately perked up. Ash is an ex-NHL player who's given up on life and turned to alcohol to drown out his sorrows. What tragic event happened that would cause him to throw in the towel and turn to the bottle? I'll leave that to you to discover.<br /><br />Anyway, remember the great masculine actors of the past, like Charleton Heston, Clint Eastwood, Burt Reynolds and even Marlon Brando (of course Brando's in a league of his own)? There was just something about them that set 'em apart and made you take notice when they were on screen. Dominic West is such an actor. He's very reminiscent of James Remar (remember him in "The Warriors"?) This was my first exposure to West and it's my hope that he moves on to bigger and better things. He's that good.<br /><br />The subplot of Ash's drunkenness struck a chord with me because I know people -- incredibly talented people like Ash -- who've essentially given up and given in to alcohol, wasting their lives away. Not to mention the fact that I've been seriously tempted to give up as well at times (albeit not to alcohol). I can relate and I'm sure you can too.<br /><br />As noted, the film is a sci-fi/mystery tale and therefore the explanation (no spoilers) is rather outlandish, but not necessarily unbelievable. 2005's "Flightplan" was a similarly-themed film; although its explanation was not outlandish it was totally unbelievable; hence, it's not worth seeing as far as I'm concerned. So, anyway, if you can't handle outlandishness I suggest you forget "The Forgotten."<br /><br />Why do I say the outlandish explanation of the story is not necessarily unbelievable? Well, let me put it this way [POSSIBLE SPOILER, but not really]: If you were able to communicate with rats, would the rats believe you if you told them there were superior beings who wanted to use them to conduct important experiments? It's true whether the rats believed or not. Let's not be arrogant and think we're the all-and-end-all of the universe. We may be, but -- more likely -- we're not. That's all I'll say. [END SPOILER]<br /><br />"The Forgotten" is essentially a story of love v.s. cold analytical thought. Personally I fall right in the middle between these two forces. This conflict is what made the character of Spock so fascinating. Remember the Star Trek episode "This Side of Paradise" where he was able to walk free of his strict adherence to logic and experience the warmth & joy of love for the first time? At the end of the episode he sadly states that it was the first time in his life that he was truly happy.<br /><br />"The Forgotten" is a story of tortuous struggle and potential triumph, for both Telly and Ash.<br /><br />Although logic is important, love is more powerful. Not to mention warmer and joy/life-inducing.<br /><br />The film is short and sweet at a mere 1 hour and 26 minutes before credits. The dvd features an extended cut with an alternative ending wherein the possible conspiracy is less malevolent. Watch the theatrical cut first and then simply go to the deleted scenes section and watch the two deleted scenes and the alternate ending (unless you want to watch the ENTIRE film twice, that is; it's just not necessary). I'll say this, the kissing scene should have never been omitted. It works. But perhaps the filmmakers didn't want to paint Telly as a potential adulterer, which isn't a bad thing.<br /><br />Don't listen to the grumps who didn't 'get' "The Forgotten." The reason they didn't 'get' it is because their pendulum veers too heavily toward cold logic, but they don't have to stay that way. :)<br /><br />GRADE: A-</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>Supposedly Julianne Moore is a good actress.  She has a strong fan base that glorifies her with godlike titles and stand behind her work one-hundred percent.  She may be a good actress, but I present to you exhibit A as proof that she is a dumb one.  I don't know what distresses me more about `The Forgotten', the fact that I expected more out of the plot or the fact that I expected more out of Moore herself.  I remember vividly when this film was released and being intrigued by the way the trailer emphasized the creepy atmosphere of the film, and atmosphere this is all but absent in the actual film.  I remember being excited by the premise, a premise with lots of potential that quickly evaporates in the climatic scenes and fails to live up to its potential.  I remember saying to myself, Julianne Moore is supposed to be a good actress, a great actress even so this has got to be good.  Like I said, good actress or not, this film is just one of many that prove she's pretty stupid.<br /><br />`The Forgotten' plays out like a C-Grade alien flick complete with fields of tall grass (you ever notice how they always tend to show up in alien films).  The story revolves around Telly Paretta, a young woman who has lost her son in a plane crash.  She's still in the thick of the grieving process and has to see a shrink to help deal with the pain.  She spends hours in her son's room looking through his things, feeling his baseball glove, staring at his photographs until one day they all disappear.  There is nothing in his drawers and his face has been removed from all the family photographs.  She thinks her husband is trying to force her to move on but he insists that she never had a son, that she had suffered a miscarriage and has been pretty much batty ever since.<br /><br />The remainder of the film consists of Telly and another grieving parent Ash trying to find their children they claim have been taken from them.  The feds are after them and so they must stay in hiding, and then there's this strange man who keeps showing up, a man they are just certain had something to do with their children's disappearance.  The film to me starts to fall apart the minute Telly's husband forgets who she is.  To me that was just too far because it really has nothing to do with the end result of the film.  This is about a world forgetting about a child and a mother being the only one to remember him.  Having her husband forget who she is was just out of place and unnecessary.  Maybe it was just a way to eliminate the need for his character anymore, but it was just stupid.  In fact, the character of Ash as well was a little to open ended.  He really has nothing to do with the final outcome.  This is a story about Telly and having another parent, especially a male, going through her turmoil was pointless.<br /><br />I think what really did it for me though was the way the film ends.  We're waiting for this explosive conclusion, something really earth shattering and in the end it's utterly disappointing.  It leaves the audience feeling ripped off, seriously ripped off.  The alternate ending provided on the DVD is even worse than the one used in the film.  I'll say this, to me this film works like a loose plot build around a cool special effect.  It's almost like some kid was sitting at his computer messing with some video feed and figured out a way to make people fling carelessly into the sky and said "this would look awesome in a movie" and so they found a way to use it.  And that's just it.  The scenes where people are being extracted into space is actually pretty cool, especially when the whole cabin room flings off, but aside from a cool special effect `The Forgotten' is a forgettable mess of C-Grade cinema.<br /><br />Sorry Moore, but in this case less, or none at all, would have been preferable.  Here's to hoping you smarten up because what I saw in `Far From Heaven' or even `Boogie Nights' is far removed from the poor excuse I see in this drivel.<br /><br />*I just want to say that I'm really struggling with a rating for this film.  I can see how some would find some satisfaction within but overall it is a messy and somewhat boring endeavor.  I'm going with 2 stars against my better judgment (my instinct says 1) based solely on the fact that those special effects are spectacularly used and Dominic West actually does some convincing acting no matter how unnecessary his character really was.*</p></br><a href="../users/A3GKPMHV4U64IY.html">A3GKPMHV4U64IY</a><br/><p>Julianne Moore plays a mother who has lost her child.  He simply perished in a plane crash one day with a number of other children on the way to camp.  Now she is undergoing therapy to deal with her loss.  But soon we begin to wonder if she ever really had a son.  No one else acknowledges that he ever exited.  They all say it is a delusion she created when she had a stillborn child.<br /><br />Julianne refuses to believe the delusion and fights even harder to get her son back.  But her search takes her to another parent who lost a child but he doesn't remember having had a daughter.  Suddenly the Feds show up and the pace of the movie really takes off.  Searching for the truth and avoiding the Feds moves the story forward at an almost breakneck pace until the final revelations and solutions.<br /><br />Although there are some other names in the movie (Gary Sinise and Anthony Edwards), this is almost a one-woman show.  It sort of reminds me of a mother's version of Finding Nemo with the parent doggedly pursuing and facing impossible odds.  There are some aspects to the movie that can keep it from being popular and the original marketing made the movie out to be quite different, but this one is definitely worth taking a look at.</p></br><a href="../users/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD.html">A3PPXVR5J6U2JD</a><br/><p>My parents liked The Forgotten. I mean, really, really like it. Once a week, they would ask "did you see The Forgotten?" And then when it came out on DVD, "did you rent The Forgotten?"  Finally, they just bought the CD, propped toothpicks under my eyelids, and made me watch it.<br /><br />Telly (Julianne Moore) and Jim Paretta (Anthony Edwards) and Ash Correll (Dominic West) have lost their children to a mysterious plane crash. Telly is a wreck, but she's trying to get better. She regularly visits a psychologist (Dr. Jack Munce played by Gary Sinise) to help her deal with her son Sam's (Christopher Kovaleski) death.  Ash finds his counseling at the bottom of a bottle.<br /><br />Then one day, all evidence of Sam disappears.  And suddenly, everyone in Telly's life has forgotten she ever had a son.<br /><br />It's a mother's worst nightmare multiplied by a thousand: it's bad enough that Telly loses her son, but her inability to grieve makes her pain all the worse. Convinced she is not insane, Telly tries to convince Ash that he had a daughter who also died in the plane crash.  When she makes some progress, things get weird.<br /><br />It's to the movie's credit that Telly and Ash never sleep together.  This is a character piece, not a popcorn flick. Just in case the guys get bored, I should point out that we do get to see Telly in some decidedly unmatronly underwear.  But that's about as hot as it gets.<br /><br />Things go from bad to worse as NSA agents and a very weird guy that never blinks (Linus Roache) begin stalking the pair.  They finally get a break when they turn the tables on an agent, knock him out, and begin forcefully interrogating him.  When pressed, he finally admits, "they're listening." And then...<br /><br />And then...<br /><br />Well you know what happens because you saw the trailer.  Indeed, if you've seen the trailer, you've correctly guessed the big secret behind the entire movie.  And that's a shame, because the movie hangs much of its suspense and terror on that curious plot point.<br /><br />Plot-wise, there are a lot of problems with The Forgotten.  The fact that Ash (an ex-hockey player) and Telly (an editor, if I remember correctly) become these amazing commandos who can put the drop on an NSA agent seems fishy.  That they then become an amazing Good Cop/Bad Cop duo that can wring the truth out of said agent is preposterous.  But then, the movie doesn't invest too much in logic.<br /><br />That's not to say that The Forgotten is boring.  Once the first agent gets sucked up into the heavens, you're always waiting for it to happen again.  Too bad the characters act as if they never witnessed such an event.  I don't know about you, but if I watched the roof get blown off of a cabin and a grown man shoot skyward, I'd be burrowing underground and hiding in subways.  I would NOT 1) stand outside, talking about the insanity of it all, 2) drive in open country, talking about the insanity of it all, 3) run around on beaches, talking about...you get the picture.<br /><br />The movie really hinges on Moore's acting ability, which is in full strength here.  At least, her tear ducts are; it's a rare moment when she's not weeping.  Still, she manages to switch between motherly love, heartbreaking sorrow and parental rage with expression alone.  West makes a great ex-hockey player, but he's a little too conflicted to scratch beneath his surface.  Just about everyone else is window dressing, or worse, mumbles their lines.  That includes Sinise, who really deserves more respect.<br /><br />Joseph Ruben expertly directs the movie, with long floating shots and stalker-cam views.  Almost all of The Forgotten is filmed with a blue lens, and the music is perfectly matched to the mood. Let there be no doubt, The Forgotten's got style.<br /><br />But ultimately it's a movie without a lot of depth.  The alternate version explains things a bit more but has far less pathos.  In the end, The Forgotten feels a lot like a really creepy Twilight Zone episode than a fully formed movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2DSXA1E02C86D.html">A2DSXA1E02C86D</a><br/><p>When Captain Kirk ordered, "Beam me up, Scotty!", he didn't have this in mind.<br /><br />Julianne Moore is Telly Paretta, a grieving mother that lost her 9-year old son in a plane crash months previous. Her memories of him are vivid. Trouble is, her husband (Anthony Edwards), shrink (Gary Sinise), and a former baby-sitter, claim that the boy never existed. In psychiatric techno-babble, she's "nuts". It doesn't help that any pictures of Telly and her son together now display with the latter missing. Creative PhotoShop editing by a guv'mint conspir'cy, perhaps? Or maybe space aliens?<br /><br />The beginning premise of THE FORGOTTEN is engaging enough through the first half or so of the film. Then, as Telly gets closer and closer to the truth, the plot becomes ridiculous. First, the National Security Agency (representing that inevitable guv'mint conspir'cy) makes its appearance, then ... well, Kirk would have had Scotty up on charges for heavy-handedness with the transporter. The film's concluding scene at the children's jungle gym in the park made me pause for a moment and reflect on the disconcerting inconvenience that time warps would add to our lives.<br /><br />Moore, who can be my Mommy anytime she wants, is a wonderful and gorgeous actress who deserves better. Who's her agent, anyway? In any case, her fine job in this stinker is the only reason for more than a two-star rating.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NM0RAYSL6PA8.html">A3NM0RAYSL6PA8</a><br/><p>The Forgotten rings true to its name, with a stunningly lame and forgettable ending that makes your regret having invested even a small amount of time giving it a chance.  What begins as a strange and reasonably provocative melodrama of a woman who remembers a child that everyone else believes is a figment of her deranged imagination turns into "Plan 9 From Outer Space" silliness about a emotionally immature group of emotionally maladjusted aliens who engage in silly experments on a group of generally mediocre actors.<br /><br />Save your self the money and the time.</p></br><a href="../users/A15G70V9OBTOVO.html">A15G70V9OBTOVO</a><br/><p>I missed this when it was new because the trailer made it look like a horror movie when in fact its an X-Files type story.  While The Forgotten does not have the humor or chemistry of the best X-Files episodes, its ok.  It escapes being predictable by being so implausible.  When the whole thing is revealed, there is no explanation as to why anyone (or thing) would bother tampering with people's lives in this way.  But even if you just want to watch Julianne Moore through a blue filter as she runs all over NY and NJ, with a soundtrack that sounds like Liz Story, its enjoyable.</p></br><a href="../users/AIMR915K4YCN.html">AIMR915K4YCN</a><br/><p>THE FORGOTTEN is a creepy, paranoia inducing tale of memory loss, deception, government conspiracy, abduction, and possible insanity. Telly (Julianne Moore from Hannibal and Safe) is a mum who is 14 months into grieving for her dead son. Or is she? Pictures and videos of the boy begin disappearing, while those around her seem to have no memory of her son's having ever existed! This leads Telly on a quest for the truth, no matter how terrible or bizarre it may be. Ms. Moore is always a pleasure to watch, as her talents lift even the most preposterous material into the realm of believability. She is the heart and soul of THE FORGOTTEN.

She has lost her son in a plane crash with several other children.  We come in on the movie some time later as she is seeing a therapist and still dealing with the loss.  She constantly revisits photos, toys, baseball paraphernalia and books that her son had in order to keep remembering him.  His room is still just as it was and she can't seem to let go of his memory long enough to get back to her real life.<br /><br />When she suddenly starts to see evidence of her son missing, thinking it's her husbands doing in order to help her let go, she gets angry and is told by her therapist (Gary Sinese) that she never had a son, that she had made it up in her head.  She finds a fellow parent (Dominic West) who also lost his daughter in the crash but doesn't believe she ever existed.  Together they begin putting together pieces of the puzzle that lead to a striking revelation.<br /><br />Many people may think the shift to Science Fiction in the middle may be a cop out, but to try explaining it any other way would be ludicrous.  Juliana Moore gives a strong performance as always in another one of her mediocre choices of movies.  The movie is dark and creepy with washed out color and overcast outdoor shots, making the film look bleak.  The mystery of the disappearance is pushing for this Hitchcock feel but it never quite reaches that point.  Overall, it is still an entertaining movie if you like Sci-Fi/Thriller films in the X-Files genre.</p></br><a href="../users/A2I7ZAB04Q0DML.html">A2I7ZAB04Q0DML</a><br/><p>Yes, I realize my title does little to conceal the outcome of this movie, but I think that it does save the viewer an hour of wasted time to reach the, forgive me, fairly ridiculous conclusion that is set before us.  I am not going to get longwinded on this review, this movie isn't worth it, but I will say that I am thuroughly disappointed in the outcome of this one....NOTE, SPOILERS AHEAD...the alien abduction theme is tired, and the idea of alien experimentation is also tired, and this movie does little to attempt any new ground with the genre at all.  Instead, it build the premise of a woman who has had a mental lapse at the death of her son.  As time passes, parts of her memory conflict with the appearant reality around her...before long, she is convinced that her memory is accurate and that everyone else around her is delusional.<br /><br />If the movie had stopped establishing plot right here and played out the argument of her sanity, I think they coudl have made a really interesting movie.  Instead, they bring in the alien element.  Aliens, working in secret and looking like us (X-files ring a bell???) have arrived and are experimenting on the bond between parents and their kids and they are surprised to find this intense bond between Julianne Moore's character and he son...and that, in a nutshell, is the second half of this story...Julianne hunting down the bad alien scientest and fighthing to get her son back.  For those of you who are still considering it just to find out what happens, she gets her son back, so no worries.<br /><br />The movie was a huge letdown...its only saving grace is a top notch performance by Moore, who can take second rate material and make it shine.<br /><br />Better luck next time...and next time, FORGET the aliens and stick to psychological plot drama.<br /><br />Scott</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>With a plot that seems like you've seen and heard it before, the Forgotten is intriguing for a while before it veers into Twilight Zone territory.  Julianne Moore gives a mostly solid performance as a grieving mother whose husband (Anthony Edwards) informs her that their child never existed.  It's impossible, she's sure of it, and she's even more ure of it when she meets a similarly grieving father (the Wire's Dominic West), and soon enough both are up to their eyes in a mysterious plot involving the NSA, and those that are even "higher up".  Normally the big twist and revelation wouldn't bother me as much as it did here, but it feels so hokey and tacked on that other plot holes and inconsistencies will soon make themselves apparent.  The Forgotten is still worth a look for mindless entertainment, and that's pretty much all to be expected from this.  Also featuring Alfre Woodard as a detective, Gary Sinise as a shrink who knows more than he's letting on, and HBO's Oz great Lee Tergesen as an ill-fated agent.</p></br><a href="../users/AYWAY5MKLAITN.html">AYWAY5MKLAITN</a><br/><p>Forgotten, when it comes right down to it, is a good story but ,like the title, it'll be one of those movies where its hard to remember why it is that you watched it or what it was all about. What I lkied about it was the fact that it did something different. It toyed with people who were forced to forget something for whatever reason. But, through strength and hope, one woman still remembers her old life that got taken away from her. But, the thing that didn't work for me is the fact that there were a lot of questions in this and only a fraction of them were answered. But, Hey, I dunno, Maybe that's closer to real life.<br /><br />Rent it, don't buy it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ.html">A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ</a><br/><p>Ever since I saw the first trailer, I was fascinated by the premise of this movie - the memory of a dead child being erased from the minds of everyone but his mother - and wondered just how a story like that could possibly end.  Having read some of the reviews, my expectations were a little bit lowered as I finally got the chance to view The Forgotten.  It turns out that I need not have lowered my expectations at all because I loved this movie.  I honestly can't see why so many people were disappointed with it.  I had no preconceived notions of the ending, and I must say the conclusion not only made sense, it felt right to me.  I'm not saying that the whole explanation behind everything doesn't have a few weak spots, but it certainly works for me.  And the special effects - Wow!  I wasn't really looking for any blow-you-away effects, and a couple of them really did a number on me - especially that first one.  I didn't even see it coming.  I wouldn't say I jumped, exactly, but there was definitely a twitch involved with the experience.<br /><br />When you get right down to it, The Forgotten is really about a mother's love - probably the strongest force in the universe - and I think there is really something poignant and life-affirming in my reaction to what I saw here.  Julianne Moore really is a great actress; she is definitely the rock upon which this story is built.  Her character, Telly Paretta, loses everything - first her son in a tragic plane crash, and then what is left of her life as everyone around her forgets the son she is still grieving for.  Every piece of evidence for young Sam's existence disappears - photos, scrapbooks, etc.; her husband insists that they never had a child; and her psychiatrist, Dr. Munce (Gary Sinise), explains to her that she invented all of her memories because of some kind of psychotic break from reality.  Still, she never doubts what she knows inside.  Fortunately, she does manage to awaken the forgotten memories of another girl's father, and that is when things really get weird.  Suddenly, Telly and Ash (Dominic West) are being aggressively pursued by National Security agents, and that makes their job of finding out what is going on all the more difficult.<br /><br />I understand that some won't really like the direction the story takes, but I was very impressed by the script and, especially, the convincing performance by Julianne Moore.  I can't really argue the merits of the story without giving anything away, but I did think everything was laid out quite well.  It's a mystery, a psychological thriller, and a drama all rolled up in into one, and I for one won't be forgetting The Forgotten any time soon.</p></br><a href="../users/A3JPFWKS83R49V.html">A3JPFWKS83R49V</a><br/><p>The "Forgotten is a frustrating and suspenseful film about a woman who loses her son in a plane crash only to find that everyone around her is convinced she never had a son at all and that she is losing her mind. The main character goes to great lengths to preserve/discover the memory of her lost son, even though the people around her are convinced she is crazy.<br /><br />Julianne Moore plays the main character, Telly Parada. She performs her role very well, with plenty of emotion. One of her co- stars, Dominic West who plays Ash Correll, is also pretty good. Ash is a guy who lost a daughter in the same plane crash and he, too, cannot recall ever having a daughter when the two meet for the first time after the accident. But Telly's persistence jogs his memory and he realizes he does have a daughter but he has no idea what has happened to her or what has caused his lapse in memory.<br /><br />This movie offers some good suspense and some good shock value. You don't know exactly what will happen and you find yourself slowly putting the pieces of the puzzle together as the film progresses. And there are some great, shocking scenes. Be careful what you have in your hands when you watch this movie because there is a good chance you will end up wearing any food or drink that happens to occupy your fingertips.<br /><br />On the negative side, this movie has some gaping holes in its plot and it leaves many questions unanswered. At the end, you feel relieved that Telly has found out the truth because you can easily see how this ordeal is driving her (and you) crazy. But you don't feel a sense of completeness with so many unresolved issues/questions.<br /><br />Still, the Forgotten is a fairly good movie. It's not going to take home any Oscars and most avid movie goers will have "forgotten" all about this film a few weeks after viewing. But it still has enough positive qualities to give it a small recommendation.</p></br><a href="../users/A1V3IO23FZFF9L.html">A1V3IO23FZFF9L</a><br/><p>The Forgotten is a movie that wants to be big and extravagent, but fails in one thing - a lack of a plot.

Some parts are much better than others, but it is never boring to the point where you would give up watching through to the end.  Julianne Moore is (as usual) great and lifts this movie up due to her perfomance alone.  Some good moments, a couple a chills and a less than thrilling conclusion, but worth a viewing if your in the mood for a B-level thriller.</p></br><a href="../users/A6ADO7B6FUVN.html">A6ADO7B6FUVN</a><br/><p>The review contains spoilers that might affect the potential cinematic experience.  Thus, consider yourself warned before you continue to read the full review.<br /><br />Forgotten opens with a number of very good shots where the camera seems to be floating high up in the air watching down on the city of New York and the people as if they were ants.  These shots bring a nauseating experience if you suffer from fear of heights, as the camera ultimately lands in a playground where Telly Paretta (Julianne Moore) sits on a swing.  Telly appears to be deep into her thoughts as she moves from the playground to a child's room in her home where she begins to fondle a baseball glove as if she tries to remember something.  Consequently, the audience finds out that she has lost her son, Sam, about 14 months earlier in a plane crash.<br /><br />Shortly after the opening, the film gets into a similar theme to Michel Gondry's Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind (2004), which focuses on the element of voluntary amnesia in cases of painful memories.  In Forgotten everyone else, except Telly, seems to suffer from amnesia, as she is the only one that remembers her son.  The people close to her believe that she suffers from severe delusions and is slightly psychotic, as she acts as if she has created a memory from having a still-borne child.<br /><br />In panic, Telly flees her persecutors, and begins to investigate Sam's plane crash.  Telly discovers that all the news in regards to her son's accident is suddenly gone.  In search for some conformation of her son's existence Telly bumps into another parent, Ash Correll (Dominic West), who she recalls also lost a child in the same accident.  Ash does not seem to recognize her, but Telly remains persistent as he somehow finds out that he once had a daughter.  Together Telly and Ash embark on troublesome journey to uncover the truth in regards to their children, as an unknown enemy seems to pull the strings from a high place--pun intended.<br /><br />The film initially sets up with an interesting plot with amnesia and psychological suspense.  However, it quickly turns into a quagmire as the film turns into a bad episode of the TV series X-Files.  Many of the ideas are never completed and instead of completing a notion it jumps a new thought, which convolutes the cinematic experience.  On occasion, Forgotten shines with remarkable effects, good cinematography, and great possibility.  In addition, Julianne Moore offers, as usual, a solid performance.  But it does not save the film, as it never come close to cinematic greatness, as the audience will feel that it might best be forgotten.</p></br><a href="../users/A1G69BQLIUMWPN.html">A1G69BQLIUMWPN</a><br/><p>I would claim this to be one of my favorite movies if they didn't ruin it in the end with the people stealing kids being aliens!  I mean the whole consept of the FBI stealing kids was a great story line (totally scary because it would be believable), but like any truly great movie it had to be ruined by aliens.  Which for me didn't work in this movie.  I just was disappointed that the acting and story line of missing kids would be overpowered by aliens and their plot.  Those of you who enjoy alien stories may enjoy this those of you who didn't know it had aliens unti I said it may want to wait until it comes out on video.  It may be something you like or it may disappoint you as it did me.</p></br><a href="../users/A38QJ7JUUTVLKX.html">A38QJ7JUUTVLKX</a><br/><p>Why on earth are people dissappointed when then film does something that they were expecting? Do want the film to be predictable? What if you were told that every moment you experienced and every memory you held dear never happened? In Revolution Studios' haunting psychological thriller The Forgotten, Telly Paretta (Julianne Moore) is tormented by the memory of her eight-year-old son Sam's death in a plane crash 14 months ago. While trying to work through her grief, and her subsequent estrangement from her husband Jim (Anthony Edwards), she is informed by her psychiatrist, Dr. Munce (Gary Sinise), that she is suffering from delusions, that her son never existed and she is fabricating his memories. Stunned, she tries to find evidence of Sam's existence photos, videos, scrapbooks. But it has all disappeared. Telly is convinced she is going mad until she meets Ash Correll the father of one of the other plane crash victims. Together, they embark on a search to prove the existence of their children and reclaim their sanity. So what's the problem? The premise grows too ridiculous to take seriously. That's what is wrong with it. Beautifully shot, some so-so preformances, some good scares but nothing that'll keep you up at night. Rent it.</p></br><a href="../users/A37ZOGOK3GKF2P.html">A37ZOGOK3GKF2P</a><br/><p>Scary, chilling, and a not so suprise twist ending best describe this thriller that feels like an expanded "X-Files" episode.  The cast is superb.  The special effects are effective.  Not a real gory tale, but plenty of action and thrills.  Great direction  and spooky score also are a plus.  The story is pure and simple:  People seem to be disappearing all over the city.  Along with the person the memories also are missing, except for one mother.  She remembers her son, but no one else does.  Is she crazy?  Has she gone completely insane, no!  I won't give away what happens to them (for that is the twist) but think "X-Files."  I miss Mulder and Scully.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ATTCCO32ZXET.html">A3ATTCCO32ZXET</a><br/><p>I hate to sound like a PTA lady or something, but you just cannot know certain emotions until you have experienced your own children.  Lest you scoff, I used to roll my eyes when people would wax sentimental about their kids.  But this really is a different ball game my friends, and until you have felt that peculiar pull in your chest as the chubby hand of your toddler grips your index finger to cross the street, you just won't get it.  For that same reason, (I believe) the movie The Forgotten won't be experienced the same way by childless people as it will by parents.<br /><br />The following is all information that was previously given away in the theatrical trailers:  Telly (Julianne Moore) has been grieving for her son Sam for 14 months now, following his death in a plane crash.  Imagine how she is simply unable to accept her therapist's sudden diagnosis one day that Sam was a figment of her imagination; in fact, her husband, friends, everybody in her life sincerely claims he never existed.  There are no pictures, no records of his birth, his life, or the crash. You will begin to wonder along with Telly if she isn't crazy, that is until she meets another parent of a child in that same crash whom she convinces to remember his daughter, using undeniable physical proof.  Obviously two strangers don't normally share in the same elaborate delusion, so some kind of conspiracy must be going on...but why, and how is it  *humanly* possible?<br /><br />Julianne Moore, who only gets more attractive with time, was the flawless choice for the lead in this film.  She so convincingly portrays a grieving mom who just can't let go that my throat was tight with sympathy throughout half the film.  Played by unknown Dominic West, the only other parent she locates is an alcoholic who is punishing himself for forgetting the most precious person in his life.  One of my favorite (and underutilized) actors, Gary Sinise, was a natural for Telly's therapist, although his role was somewhat minimized.  I have noticed that very few critics have been able to fault any of the leads in The Forgotten despite what other misgivings they may have.<br /><br />And what misgivings are we talking about exactly?  More or less, they were disappointed that there was a Sci Fi explanation for the events of Sam's disappearance.  It would seem that naysayers would have preferred find out that the whole thing was a delusion or a mundane government conspiracy. Given the info that we all got from the trailer (see above), those really weren't logical options, now were they?  You may now picture me shaking my head sadly as I confront the critical ones with a Tsk Tsk, and "Weren't you paying attention?"<br /><br />The secondary strength of The Forgotten was its themes.  Explored here are the strength of the parent/child bond, questions on the relativity of reality, and the place of humankind in the greater scheme of things.  Not easy material to cram into less than two hours, but handled nicely in this story.  Applause also goes out to the art direction and sound editing.  The depth of emotional response was underscored deftly by DTS.  This is one to see with the full advantage of a loaded sound system.  Without giving too much away, trust me:  you will appreciate those moments of pure physical thrill that a good sound format can highlight so effectively.<br /><br />Perhaps this film would not have affected me so viscerally if I had not been a parent.  Perhaps therefore non-parents cannot be blamed for getting less out of it, as much of its effectiveness relies on empathy with Telly and Ash.  Still, there are many other worthwhile reasons to see The Forgotten, and I humbly hope that I have just explained why.

The problem is they keep "losing" their memories or worst, clear possessions of their child they know they once had.  It feels like their memory of their lost child is being `erased' from them or that they might be going crazy.  That's lots of fun to watch.  Of course, the spouses are trying their best to deal with this annoying craziness, but there is only so much a person can do!  Director Joseph Ruben inserts lots of mind-bending special effects and after an hour you wonder what in the heck is going on here?  Suffice it to say that if you ever saw a movie where it turns out everything was really a dream, you know how ripped off you felt.  Well, the ending here is no less interesting and as much of a letdown.  Think of a bad television version of the "X-Files"!</p></br><a href="../users/A2UN5UY8Q6YMOF.html">A2UN5UY8Q6YMOF</a><br/><p>I chose this movie under the assumption that it would be a psycological thriller with perhaps a touch of the supernatural much like the 6th Sense.  Instead, it turned out to be a cliched government conspiracy, alien UFO movie.  At times I thought I was watching a poorly made episode of the X-Files.  Is it a coincidence that Julianne Moore plays the red-headed lead named "Telly", while the X-Files female lead was another red-head by the name of "Sculley"?  Maybe I'm paranoid, but this movie stinks.  The writers could not even come up with a plausible reason for the aliens' experiments.  The DVD contains 2 endings, both of which were garbage, but the theatrical ending was actually the worst.  Julianne does a compentant job playing a grieving mother, but the rest of the cast is forgetable.  Julianne seems to be a fine actress, but when has she ever picked a good script?  At least the title is appropriate since this movie should be among the forgotten.</p></br><a href="../users/AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ.html">AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ</a><br/><p>Everybody wants to be the next M. Night Shyamalan, don't they? It would appear that way with the super-natural thriller genre getting a serious kick in the pants over the past couple of years based on the number of projects, some have worked (The Ring) but for the most part audiences have come away disappointed by the far from quality Shyamalan's films were known for. Now with the now famous director's latest work, The Village, far from meeting fan expectations, could the door be open for a new one to take over now that essentially Shyamalan wants to move on to different projects? Already The Forgotten has labeled itself this year's The Sixth Sense, whether it be the rumors of this being a knock-off of the 1999 hit or studio enthusiasm, so whatever way it goes shouldn't be shocking, just as its finale is.<br /><br />The story for The Forgotten follows a grieving mother as she attempts to track down the truth about her eight year old son who was believed to have died in an airplane tragedy but now appears to have been part of an orchestrated cover up. Telly Paretta, like any parent would be in this situation, has never felt the same way since two years ago when her son Sam was killed in a tragic plane accident the killed five other children on their way to summer camp. Every day, for at least an hour, she slips back into her son's room, looks at old scrapbooks and watches videos of him through his short-lived childhood, thus keeping a part of her son alive - his memory. When she discovers that the videos have been erased and the scrapbooks emptied, she becomes furious at her husband who she claims wants their son forgotten from their life so that they can move on. But her psychiatrist reveals to her that Telly and her husband never had a son, or at least a living one, as she miscarried and nearly died after giving birth to their still born son. He states that it is normal for a woman in this situation to create imaginary children and friends to fill the void that has been lost in their life. Telly refuses to belief this and runs off searching for a man whose daughter was friends with her son before the crash. When he comes to realization that he had a daughter, the two run off together in search of the truth while being constantly pursued by National Security attempting to cover up a conspiracy they don't want dug up. The story for The Forgotten is quite simply one of the most pathetic and miserable scripts created for a feature film, not sent direct to video, this year. To be fair, the first one-third of the film in which Telly is told by her psychiatrist that she may be psychotic, specifically making up a child in her mind to deal with the miscarriage, was an intriguing piece of work and may have kept the interest of audience had the screenwriters followed through with that premise. Unfortunately The Forgotten, much in the same way as another horror rip-off, Godsend, earlier this year, decides to veer so severely off course from reality that you are left with more questions by the end then when you started off.<br /><br />The film has a perfectly assembled cast, , unfortunately all that priceless talent is wasted in this hopeless tripe of a film. Julianne Moore, better known for her brilliant performances in more independent fare like The Shipping News and Far From Heaven, gives tremendous emotion to the character of Telly Paretta, a woman who will do anything just to have her son back in her life. Her specific actions and moods will connect instantly with parents while those not yet blessed with a child in their lives may struggle to accept some of the events occurring but will at least understand them. Dominic West, a rising up and comer in Hollywood, does an exceptional job with the role of man who's practically sent his life down a drunken spiral ever since he lost his daughter in what supposedly a tragic plane accident. Applause must be given to the screenwriters for getting at least one thing right in this script and that was for Moore and West's characters to have an intense relationship together but not have them collapse into yet another pathetic "romantic" escapade as in other films of this genre. Alfre Woodard and Anthony Edwards are two support characters that could have easily been down-sized based on their roles in the feature or completely eliminated altogether as they do little, if anything seriously, to the progression of the story. And Gary Sinise, now known as the star of the recently launched CSI: New York series on the C-BS television network, does the best he can with the material that is given to him but unfortunately for him the character is seriously flawed. Without giving too much away, though, to be honest, there's too much confusion to clearly give anything away in this film, Sinise's character knows of the "experiment" going on near the end of the film but states he isn't a government agent, just a guy who knows. Then why wasn't he abducted? Is he one of "them"? What is his specific role in this cover up? These are just a few of the absurdly large amount of unanswered questions poised at the end of this film that may never be answered.<br /><br />Overall, The Forgotten is by no means, in any shape or form, this year's The Sixth Sense, though it does share a trait with another Shymalan film, The Village, namely that the audience feels cheated in part to its cheap thrills but mainly for an ending that feels ripped an old episode of either The Twilight Zone or The X-Files. There will be those out there who want others to believe that this film is a wonderful send up to the classic B-movie science-fiction thrillers of the 1950s but, as illogical as those films were, they never contained plot holes as gigantic as the ones that occupy The Forgotten's premise. How is it that the Telly is the sole obsession of this "alien life form" conducting this experiment and not Ash as well? Though it did take a little coaching, he did remember his daughter nearly as well as Telly remembers Sam. Granted he was eventually abducted but still doesn't he get a little credit in all this? Though mothers do share a much closer relationship with their children then do the fathers, which can not be denied, the film's ending is a bit of an insult to fathers who care deeply for their children and would do just as much as the mothers would to protect them. If these "things" are able to instantly "abduct" human beings, like Alfre Woodard's character, simply for knowing about what is going on then wouldn't it be simpler for them to abduct everyone involved with these children in order to have them forgotten? What are these "things" that are supposedly monitoring the planet and conducting experiments on us? Why are they being conducted? For what specific purpose? Why Earth and not some other life-inhabited planet? Even if one ignores the mind-numbing amount of holes presented in the film's sense of logic, though they are pretty hard to ignore once you get down to the bare bones of it, it must be admitted the film's ending, whether it be clich&eacute;d or admirable, is wrapped up too neatly and without any sense of surprise what-so-ever. No matter how you dress it up, The Forgotten is yet another disaster in the area of science-fiction thrillers this year joining the ranks of Godsend and The Village on the trash-heap of the box office.</p></br><a href="../users/A10X0JN8KTK89H.html">A10X0JN8KTK89H</a><br/><p>Julianne Moore rarely gives a bad performance. It's amazing to watch her in this film brilliantly rejuvenating crappy dialogue and stupid plot turns. Dominic West does a decent job as well. The chemistry between the two is established nicely. Along with the performances by the film's stars, some of the special effects are truly great. "The X-Files" could have learned a lot from this film in the effects department. Otherwise, this is an easily forgotten movie.<br /><br />The film starts off with a great premise: A woman mourns the death of her son through emotional rituals lasting over a year. Shortly into the film, she is told that she never had a son, that her memories of him are made up. Sounds like I'm giving away the movie, doesn't it? I would be if the film actually followed such an interesting story. But no, get ready for some conspiracy theory weirdness and a totally out-of-this-world-stupid plot.</p></br><a href="../users/A39IBJB2PBVC7I.html">A39IBJB2PBVC7I</a><br/><p>There are those among us who cast a jaundiced, skeptical eye upon the heavens and conclude that there is nothing out there but blank, frigid emptiness, the occasional congealed dust bunny and/or burning orb, and astronaut flotsam and jetsam.  These heathens believe that the rational beings on earth are alone, unique among the galaxies, masters of all.  But The Forgotten begs to differ.  Indeed, individuals unwilling to concede that malevolent forces interfere in the lives of mankind and treat human beings with the same dispassionate cruelty scientists reserve for lab rats would have a hard time explaining the W. Bush administration.  But then, so would the W. Bush administration, should it ever feel the need to do so.<br /><br />Critics and audiences alike seem to have held The Forgotten up to a rather high standard and consequently missed the boat.  Undoubtedly this was due to the presence of Julianne Moore, a marquee actress.  They astutely pointed out the lack of concrete proof that space aliens control our lives!  They also pointed out that being the editor of children's books doesn't exactly qualify you to outmaneuver Federal Agents!  Zut alors!  Imagine this, improbability in a film!  However, they failed to light on the nice idea that memories themselves play a large role in shaping who and what we are - and stealing them away not only will drive us mad - it will make us malleable and easy to exploit.  This interesting notion is elegantly wrapped in a dressy psychological thriller that features good acting, cracker-jack special effects, and excellent pacing.<br /><br />Yes it is implausible that space aliens are using human beings as part of a science project to be presented at an inter-galactic parent's night.  But let's just say that the sci-fi angle is in there for purposes of plot convenience, and the "aliens" in question are the top 1% who very conveniently sit on the same boards of the same companies and shuffle quietly in between government posts and lucrative private sector appointments with an uncanny knack for attracting government contracts.  Does the idea of erasing collective memory seem quite as improbable now?<br /><br />The Forgotten is not a great movie, but it's a good and well made movie that's a lot of fun to watch - and recall.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>The Forgotten starring Julianne Moore and Domnic West is a slow, tepid, and hard to grasp film. The previews for this film were better than the actual movie, I guess that's a bad sign that the movie isn't going to be great (I'll try and remember that next time). The only reason I am giving The Fogotten 2 stars is the scene with Alfe Woodward, you'll know what I mean when it happens, the scence is scary and comes out of nowhere, very intrguing spurprise awaits.

The only thing I could figure out was that both Julianne Moore and Dominic West were playing characters who could afford to let their children go on special plane flights for kids on QuestAir, but you don't have to be a millionaire to go on a plane, and these people are living in these fantastic apartments that are easily as big as plane hangars.  They're all gloomy too, well, that figures.  It's like GREY GARDENS without the occasional musical numbers.<br /><br />How many times does Julianne Moore have to introduce herself with the catchy mnemomyic, "I'm Telly Paretta"?  Someone, perhaps the hard-working psychiatrist played by Gary Sinise, should have asked her why her mom and dad named her after TV's KOJAK and saved himself months and months of analytical discovery.  Sinise is the only actor who could have played this part, Dr. Muntz, who browbeats the police into letting him accompany them at all times for he must be there when they recapture Telly otherwise she'll suffer a psychotic break.  Yeah, like the police would really pay attention to this worry wart.  And yet the plot is constructed so that this has to happen.  I also enjoyed the part where Telly, adopting the pleasant guise of a personal assistant, tricks an auditor into giving up a suspect's home address: "165 Colony Road, Long Island."  Gee, that'll be easy to find!  Didn't they want to name a real town?<br /><br />Anyhow I loved the movie and couldn't bear to see it end.  I bought it for my own DVD collection and probably will see it over and over, it will help me with my own feelings of anxiety and inadequacy about not having kids.  You know how sometimes one wakes up feeling so spacey that, if Anthony Edwards told me I had had a miscarriage and didn't really have any children at all, I'd believe him, for he has such an innocent face and it's so great he got a part in a major studio movie again after being stigmatized by his "Mark Green" role in ER for for many years during which time he was graylisted by Hollywood and went completely, utterly, bald like Otto Preminger.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>I got really anxious when I put in the DVD for "The Forgotten" and was given an option of watching the original theatrical release or the extended version with an alternate ending.  Given what I knew about this 2004 film, to wit, a mother is the only one who remembers that she had a son, I was worried that the two endings might represents completely opposite resolutions to the situation.  Fortunately, that is not the case, and I think the alternate ending is slightly stronger than the original (actually, to a great extent they are pretty compatible).  But the proliferation of alternative endings on DVDs worries me, because if you are not sure where your movie is going to end when you start making it I think you are in serious trouble.  Besides, I have horrid visions of the alternate endings for "Gone With the Wind" and "Casablanca."<br /><br />"The Forgotten" is a film with an interesting idea, but the trailer gives away a bit too much so that you have no doubt as to which way you are supposed to be leaning on this one.  Telly Paretta (Julianne Moore), has been mourning the death of her 9-year-old son, Sam, for over a year (she can do months, days, and hours).  Sam was killed in an airplane crash, along with nine other kids.  Telly is seeing a psychiatrist, Dr. Munce (Gary Sinise), but resisting treatment, the goal of which is for her to spend less time each day looking at Sam's toys and photographs of the boy.  Then she comes home one day and finds everything is gone and her husband, Jim (Anthony Edwards) is insisting she never had a child but had suffered a miscarriage.<br /><br />The idea of a woman who has created a fictional child who ends up getting killed is rather compelling (even if you are suddenly thinking "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"), but that is not what is going on here.  This is one of those movies were a mom, against great odds, fights for her child.  Part of the problem with "The Forgotten" is that the odds against which Tally is fighting might be the greatest in human history.  While this is also an interesting idea, it is played out against such monumental odds that the point Gerald Di Pego's script is trying to make about the power of a mother's love gets a bit lost.<br /><br />Tally is able to enlist a couple of allies, Ash Correll (Dominic West), an ex-hockey player who does not remember the daughter Telly insists he had, and Detective Ann Pope (Alfre Woodard), who is suspicious of the feds chasing a crazy women and who finds it hard to believe that two people would be suffering parallel delusions.  But the initial flaw in this film is that we know Tally is not crazy from the start and I really believe that ambiguity needs to be a bigger part of the first act of the film.  The longer the film cuts both ways, the stronger this sort of story tends to be.  But director Joseph Ruben apparently does not recognize this is the smart way to go.<br /><br />The major flaw with this film is that once we get to THE EXPLANATION as to what is going on, your awe over the sheer magnitude of the power and magnitude of what is going on is mitigated by the simple question of "why go to all the bother?"  After all, when you think about the final scene, it sure seems like a bit much for a statistical aberration, and that is without even getting into the whole question of how it is done (not that any explanation would be forthcoming, but you can appreciate the idea).<br /><br />This is too bad because not only is the idea of a woman inventing a fictional child rather interesting, Moore provides an anguished performance as this particular mother, capturing both the pain of loss and the power of motherhood, and West certainly gives his role a nice little twist from what we have come to expect in such films that throw two people together.  But primarily "The Forgotten" is a film that wastes several talented performers.  Most of Anthony Edwards scenes are in the trailer, Sinise has to wait most of the film for a scene worthy of his talents, and "The Forgotten" is a movie that literally throws away Alfre Woodward.</p></br><a href="../users/AZCDCO6KK2T81.html">AZCDCO6KK2T81</a><br/><p>I can't say much about this film as it is just a real dud.  The plot is totally unbelievable although it has a clever premise.  The acting is strictly by the numbers, the direction pedestrian at best, and the effect were just average.  Maybe I'll rewrite this review when I'm in a better mood, but for now, this is film is one to forget renting or buying.</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>What if everything you knew began to slip away like a fading memory? The premise of The Forgotten seems like its out of The X-Files territory. Telly Paretta (Julianne Moore) is in therapy trying to come to grips with the loss of her 9 year old son in a plane crash. Fourteen months have passed and she still feels his presence vividly expecting him to walk through the door. While visiting her therapist (Gary Sinise) she discusses her sense of loss and her inability to move on. Later, she discusses her son again and he tells her she never had one.<br />They never discussed him. That she's having a delusion and creating an imaginary son to help her deal with other issues. When she discusses this with her husband (Anthony Edwards) he echoes her psychiatrist; they never had a son. Suddenly, photos that she was familiar with featuring her son begin disappearing replaced with others featuring only her and the husband.<br /><br />Then how can her memories be so vivid? How can she still smell his hair, remember the texture of his skin, the color of his eyes, the day he first walked? How can she create a life that never was? There's no evidence he existed even the photos that she looked at the day before that had the three of them together now shows only Telly and her husband. Telly's conviction carries her on a search for her son that she knows in her heart exists. Telly discovers a series of frightening truths along this journey and that she doesn't need to take the journey alone.<br /><br />A disturbing suspense thriller that takes a number of unexpected twists and turns, The Forgotten has something that most thrillers lack-heart and soul. Julianne Moore's powerful performance anchors even the most incredible scenes in the movie. It's her performance that holds the film together even as it threatens to fly apart. With a strong, memorable supporting cast The Forgotten will stay with you as will the questions that it asks. If you're looking for a clearer solution to the story's mystery, I'd suggest watching the extended version that didn't play in theaters. It paints the conclusion with more solid colors although there's much that isn't explained. That's just as well as the best suspense thrillers always leave some loose ends. For those who want a  conclusion that's less clear cut, I'd suggest watching the theatrical cut. Both have their merits and both work extremely well but the inclusion of a couple of scenes might make the difference between accepting the conclusion of the film or not.<br /><br />As I mentioned previously the DVD sports two versions of the film and the extended cut with the alternate ending provides a great extra for fans that want to experience a slightly different version of the film. The extended ending really consists of one sequence that pushes home the conclusion of the film a bit more aggressively and leaves the conclusion a bit less nebulous than the theatrical cut. Both versions have their merits. We also get a short documentary on the making of the film beginning with the germ of the idea and how it occurred to writer Gerald DiPego and how he developed it to the involvement of Julianne Moore and director Joseph Ruben. Many of the behind-the-scenes production talent appear in this documentary discussing the development of the project. The featurette on the making of the film provides glimpses behind-the-scenes on the making of the film with sound bites featuring the main cast discussing their roles and what attracted them to the project in the first place. Both are done exceptionally well and make up for a lack of additional extras on the optical effects used for the film. We also get deleted scenes many of which did not end up in either version of the film.<br /><br />A gripping thriller that will have you guessing about the fate of the various characters in the film The Forgotten isn't likely to be a memory that'll fade away like an old photograph. The rich performances particularly by Julianne Moore, Gary Sinise, Anthony Edwards, Dominic West and Alfre Woodard ground the film in a sense of reality just as Telly's world appears to depart from it. Well directed with an intelligent script that doesn't take any short cuts, The Forgotten will linger with you like the memory of your first date or seeing the first steps your child takes. Some things can't be forgotten or taken away and the rich themes at the heart of this film will make that very clear. If you're someone looking for clear cut resolutions, you may want to watch the extended version and rent before buying. If it appeals to you, I guarantee you'll come back to it again and again. That might make it a worthwhile purchase for you.</p></br><a href="../users/A2F3M93RRLFQNJ.html">A2F3M93RRLFQNJ</a><br/><p>Poorly written, poorly acted and poorly directed, there is enough in Forgotten to dissatisfy most people.<br /><br />The movie follows a mother played by Julianne Moore, who is still in mourning over the death of her son a year earlier.  This tragic event takes on an extra level of grimness when all records of her son begin to disappear:  except for her, no one remembers him, and photos, newspaper articles and other documents no longer prove his existence.  Either Moore is crazy or something sinister is going on, and when shadowy government figures get involved, we know it's the latter.<br /><br />In theory, this could be a good movie, but the story is executed so poorly that its potential quality remains a mere hypothetical.  Perhaps the most grating moment comes around a third of the way through the movie, when Moore visits a man who is the father of another child who died, but who cannot remember his daughter.  Fortunately, the power responsible for these existence-erasings - a force powerful and intelligent enough to alter minds and documents - just bothered to poorly wallpaper over the girl's room, allowing Moore to expose the conspiracy.<br /><br />There are other laughable idiocies: the government agents who have no idea how to arrest a person, allowing chases that could have been avoided if they were semi-competent; the police detective who - with little real evidence - easily believes Moore's tale of conspiracy; and so on.  Rather than relying on cleverness to move the story along, this movie uses dumbness.  In a comedy, this might work, but not in this humorless horror movie.  If you feel an urge to watch this film, find an old X-Files or Twilight Zone episode instead.  You'll be much happier.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>I cannot say I completely loathed this film. The mood and atmosphere of the film was eerie and creepy, but nothing we haven't seen before. Julianne Moore did an excellent job as the terrified, confused and frightened mother, who has been told her son, who has been dead for 14 months, never existed. However, her abilities start to fall apart at about the same time as the movie does.<br /><br />This film begins to build a dynamic story very early on. Great twists and turns in this movie, so much so that I don't want to mention very much, except the initial premise that Julian Moore has been grieving for years about her lost son, and suddenly her husband, her doctor - everyone - has no memory of her son, they act is if Julianne has lost her mind. Unfortunately, it gets lost in itself and crumbles towards the middle and especially by the end.<br /><br />What probably started out as a decent alien abduction flick, turned sour and became another in a long line of Sixth Sense or The X-Files rip-offs. There was nothing that really jumped out and grabbed the viewer by the throat and made them afraid for their own children. I think that really could have been the selling point of this film. The make people afraid to let their children out of their sight. I mean, the idea of this happening in real life would be the scariest part of all. This film was building up to that, but again, it crumbled way too fast. The ending was different, but bland. Julianne Moore's character is able to overcome the odd experiment she is being forced through, because her love for her son is too strong.<br /><br />The Forgotten has some good action, some good mystery; and it would be an excellent Twilight Zone material. But it really works best if you don't know already how the story unfolds. Interesting, but a trifle underdeveloped and almost seemingly tacked on.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MG8DHACXH5MS.html">A2MG8DHACXH5MS</a><br/><p>Twilight zone meets A Beautiful Mind.

As I watched the first half of the movie, there were some compelling sequences and a couple of generally frightening scenes.  Julianne Moore and Dominic West were doing a great job in involving me in their plight.  One could sense sinister underpinnings from Anthony Edwards as Moore's husband and Gary Sinise as her psychiatrist.  Then, halfway through, the movie takes a strange turn and once you realize where it's taken you, you feel cheated.  It has one of the most anti-climactic and outright dull endings in recent movie history.  Even the alternate ending included on the DVD doesn't make up for the movie's lack of commitment to the viewer.  Who is doing this?  We are never really told.  Why are they doing this?  We are never really told.  And by the end of the movie, where are we timewise?  Before or after the fateful plane crash scenario?  It's a shame because it could have been a much better movie had the writer and director respected its audience a little more.  Writing a plot that is so open-ended and where everything is left to the viewer's own interpretation does not spell good moviemaking to this viewer.</p></br><a href="../users/A22J9WI2PDAVJ.html">A22J9WI2PDAVJ</a><br/><p>The Forgotten starts as suspense thriller, but ends with a lot of unanswered questions. Telly Paretta (Julianne Moore) is grieving the loss of her son Sam (Christopher Kovaleski) who seemly died in a plane crash. Her psychiatrist (Gary Sinise) is trying to convince her that she never had a son. Who and  what is behind this?<br /><br />The NSA cover up leads to alien abductors experimenting with humans has been already covered. The X-files and Twilight Zone shows come to mind. The acting was great and visual effects were enough to carry this movie to the box office. I was disappointed with the unexplained alien interaction with the human element. The movie ends as a Sci-Fi thriller that does not deliver. I guess the aliens are running the world. (Were have I seen that before?)<br /><br />The relationship between mother and child is the unbreakable bond that not even an alien can break. There are two stories here that should have been separated.<br /><br />Alfre Woodard (Detective Anne Pope) and Anthony Edwards (Jim Paretta) play supporting roles and are under utilized.</p></br><a href="../users/A3STFVPM8NHJ7B.html">A3STFVPM8NHJ7B</a><br/><p>Julianne Moore stars as Telly, she is a mother who loses her son in a plane crash and refuses to let him go. She is swinging outside and the film gets really dark where you can barely she whats going on but it does clear up. Then all of the suddence, people around her do not remember her even having a son. Yes, it sounds oh so promising but that's where the movie goes into the toilet. She spends the night at one of her son's friends fathers home, not sexually but just happens to spend the night there. He does not remember having a daughter until she tears down some old wall paper in his office but he calls the cops. As she is escorted out, he remembers having a daughter and they go together to find out the truth and someone is chasing them and trying to stop them. Yes, the movie does have promise.  The ending is so stupid that I won't spoil it for anyone.<br /><br />Overall, you can probably find this movie really cheap. It's not a bad movie but like so many sci fi movies out there today ala The Knowning or The Box for example, it starts off good but the ending makes you scratch your head and yell at the screen--What the %^(!. There is an alternate ending but i've yet to watch it but I would like to check it out.</p></br><a href="../users/A4F8CJ1L4348V.html">A4F8CJ1L4348V</a><br/><p>I really liked this movie. It does show how strong a parent's tie with thier children certainly are. Watching this movie certainly made me think of all of the parents that have lost thier children via accidents, child abductions or run-aways and how the parents must feel. Appreciation of what you have comes to mind and love the ones that you have, because tomorrow they could be gone. I liked this movie because it told of the "real pain" that Telly was feeling when her child was gone and "others" tried to erase her memories. I did watch the extended alternate ending which I do recommend in seeing. This movie is an on the edge of your seat thriller and I do recommend it to anyone!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A31U2QT7SAL7K.html">A31U2QT7SAL7K</a><br/><p>As others have stated, there are too many similarities between this film and an episode of the recently departed "The X-Files": an alien with regenerative powers, mindless government agents, too many chase scenes, dimly lit streets, a cop (Alfre Woodard) that discovers "the truth" a little too late, all frequent elements of the show.<br /><br />Even James Horner's subtle score treads musical ground better covered by "Files" composer Mark Snow.<br /><br />And poor Gary Sinise probably needed to move to television ("CSI: New York").  It's become obvious, as of late, that whatever character he portrays in a film has a hidden agenda.<br /><br />The saving grace of the film is Julianne Moore, an actress that deserves better than this easily "forgotten" film.</p></br><a href="../users/AMIGVTZZIWS6I.html">AMIGVTZZIWS6I</a><br/><p>The Forogotten certainly had the potential to be a great movie, but it is just weighted down by a B-Movie plot about (**SPOILER**) alien experiments on parents.  The best thing about the movie is Julianne Moore's wonderful performance as a mother who refuses to forget the son everyone tells her never existed.  In the end, it's that mother's love, that fetal link between mother and child, that is ultimately the undoing of the alien experiment.  Because of that, the movie is certainly worth viewing.  If you have the opportunity, watch both the theatrical version and the extended alternate ending.  In my opinion, the theatrical ending is the much better of the two.  The alternate ending is just too X-Files for my tastes.</p></br><a href="../users/AILBDL6ATVDCJ.html">AILBDL6ATVDCJ</a><br/><p>Julianne Moore is NOT my favorite actress, but after having seen just about every movie in the video store I had little choice except to give The Forgotten a look.<br /><br />Maybe it was because I wasn't expecting much that I found this movie actually very good.  It was a little like being on a roller-coaster ride where ya can't see the next turn or twist.  I thought the story moved along well, the acting was convincing, and the dialogue fit the happenings in a decent manner.<br /><br />I think the less a person knows about this film before viewing it, the more they will enjoy it.<br /><br />There is action, suspense, drama, and a little bit of (well, sort of) romance (maybe kindness is a better word).<br /><br />I recommend this film, and since I am such an awesome movie reviewer, you should listen to me and buy it.

What she has left is photos and video footage of her son but things start to go weird when she sees that her son is not in a picture. She then starts to breakdown and her doctor...Gary Sinise (The Big Bounce, Snake Eyes) thinks he made up her son in her imagination. Moore meets Dominic West (Rock Star, HBO's The Wire) who's daughter was friends with her son but he swears he doesnt have a daughter but then when he says her name as he stands in her old room he starts to remember, so Moore and West run around the city being chased by guys in nicely pressed suits and the cops as well. The end result was predictable...why, well if you watched the trailer..you knew it was gonna be the green creatures but they take the form of humans. The message was that the beings took the children to observe the parents. The funny thing is that the aliens created a airline....hilarious. Though the only impressive scenes would have to be when the people get sucked up into the sky but otherthen that...it's not even that scary and it's pretty much like I said, predictable. Also starring Linus Roache (Hart's War, Wings Of The Dove) and Alfre Woodard (Crooklyn, Mumford).</p></br><a href="../users/A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2.html">A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2</a><br/><p>The Forgotten starts off with an interesting premise--a bereaved mother who finds everyone forgetting about her son--and progresses to some moments of great tension, but ultimately is a disappointment.<br /><br />The look of the movie is vintage X-Files, with its gritty realism and its hand-held camera work.  The visual texture of the film reflects the emotional progression of our heroine, Telly Paretta (Julianne Moore).  However, it also tries to bring us in on the director's mindset.  I agree that Moore is a beautiful woman, but the long lingering shots of her face and body slow down the progression of the plot.<br /><br />Paretta is accompanied in her effort to weed out her frustration by Ash Correll (Dominic West), who loses the memory of his daughter but then recovers it.  Ash is an interesting character, but the enforced sexual tension between him and Paretta is distracting and, since nothing ever comes of it, a red herring on the part of writer Gerald Di Pego and director Joseph Rubin.<br /><br />These leads are supplemented with a million-dollar supporting cast, including Anthony Edwards, Alfre Woodard, Robert Wisdom, and Gary Sinese.  All the actors work hard to create a careful and nuanced ensemble performance, and I really enjoyed watching them.  However, they all seem to be held hostage to the tender mercies of the script, which doesn't relent an inch.<br /><br />For example, in an attempt to frustrate Paretta's investigation of why everyone forgot her son, they also wipe away her marriage.  Her husband has no idea who she is.  But the police investigation he initiated on her behalf continues.  Why?  Because the plot demands it.<br /><br />The plot demands are unforgiving to the characters.  There are three major twists in the story.  I saw two of them less than fifteen minutes into the story, but the third, having to do with Sinese as Paretta's psychiatrist, came so far out of left field and was so unearned that, at a key moment when I should have been powerfully empathic with these characters, I only wanted to jeer.<br /><br />There are also a lot of scares in this movie.  In this way, as with others, it tries to mimic the success of the X-Files.  But rather than building on creeping dread or a fear of the unknown, the scares are based on jolts and shoults of "Boo!"  I jumped several times as I was watching, but I doubt if I went back and saw this film a second time that I'd be particularly flustered.<br /><br />Perhaps the biggest problem with this movie was that it seems to have been transplanted from another script.  Or several.  With the flexing of reality around our protagonist, I kept expecting Hugo Weaving to appear around the corner and growl, "Mr. Anderson..."  And with the number of men in black, I was waiting for the one rogue, played by David Duchovny, to try and unseat them.<br /><br />This movie isn't out-and-out bad.  It has a good underlying premise, an engaging look, and characters we genuinely want to care about.  But the movie is hostage to the writer and director, who seem to want the audience to react so specifically that they're not above manipulating the world of the film to get that.<br /><br />Wait for the DVD to come out with this one--it's good, but not good enough to justify the steep price of theater tickets.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FY3H6F4249E0.html">A3FY3H6F4249E0</a><br/><p>Well, I see the other reviews are all over the place on this flick.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.  It is about a mother's love for her child.  She refuses to let go of his memory when others try to tell her he never existed.<br /><br />The movie opens with Telley Paretta (Julianne Moore) on a swing, thinking.  Later, as she goes through her son's photos, belongings, and home movie clips, you hear Telley talking with her Psychiatrist (Gary Sinise--aka Lieutenant Dan in Forrest Gump) about the loss of her 9 year old son, Sam, 14 ? months ago.  It seems several children boarded a plane and there was a plane accident.  Husband James Paretta (Anthony Edwards) seems supportive.  She has regular sessions with the Psychiatrist.  Telley is forgetting little things here and there, but we all do that.  Then, photos of Sam disappear, as do home movies.  Sam even disappears from family photos, as if he never existed.  All traces of him are gone. Telley blames her husband for getting rid of the memories, but then the Psychiatrist explains she never had a son, but a miscarriage.  He says her mind made it all up.  While James is present, the doctor threatens to hospitalize Telley (for her own good, of course).<br /><br />Knowing this is all a lie, and realizing they are all against her, Telley takes off on the run.  She goes to a male acquaintance who also lost his daughter on the same flight.  All of a sudden, the FBI and the National Security Agency are involved.  The local police detective also realizes this just doesn't make sense.  The movie is pretty fast paced and action packed.  It's an "on the run" type move that takes place in New York, while the two grieving parents search for the truth.</p></br><a href="../users/A2VMT89TCSF105.html">A2VMT89TCSF105</a><br/><p>"The Forgotten" is a science fiction movie featuring Julianne Moore, Dominic West and Gary Sinise.<br /><br />The actors are good, the concept interesting, but the movie never delivers. Unfortunately, I have to agree with the critics: "The Forgotten" is a film best forgotten. It comes across as a second-rate "X Files" rip off.<br /><br />The main character, Telly Paretta, has lost her son Sam in a plane crash. About a year later, all memories of Sam mysteriously vanishes, Telly's doctor tells her that she is delusional, and neither her husband nor her babysitter remembers anything. However, Telly finds one person who does remember: a former NHL player turned heavy drinker named Ash whose daughter was on the same plane. Together, they try to find out the truth about the missing children. Soon, both Telly and Ash are hunted by the National Security Agency. Before long, they realize that the federal government have struck a deal with a group of space aliens who abduct children to conduct weird experiments.<br /><br />It would have worked in the hands of Chris Carter. In this production, the idea never really takes off. "The Forgotten" isn't even scary, and only the first part is psychologically interesting. The alien is very bland, and the only worked out characters are Telly and Ash. The end of the movie is ridiculous. I got the impression that the scriptwriter didn't really know how to end the movie, and invented a "Pamela and Bobby Ewing" kind of twist, just to end it all!<br /><br />It's a real pity that "The Forgotten" wasn't better, especially since so many good actors participated in this project. In the end, it didn't satisfy anyone. It's too weird for a regular drama, too bland for science fiction, and not psychological enough for a psychological thriller.<br /><br />And now...sports.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>A small film that is suspenseful and well done as altogether. But... Some extraterrestrials are alluded at as experimenting on human beings. But nothing is really shown of them, about them, concerning them. They are a total mystery. They are trying to erase the memory of human beings but we will never know why nor how nor what for. They are doing some experiment for the sake of doing it. Then what kind of appreciation can we put forward? Memory is both erasable and un-erasable. When we are dealing with children, abducted children, the mother has an advantage because she is going to remember the child physiologically in her own body from even before he was born. But that is rather trite. It leads to no kind of conclusion. So who can have any interest, and what interest, in erasing people's memory, that memory people love forgetting, disguising and losing as fast as they can invent some substitute recollection to replace the truth? The end then is like a happy unexplainable return of the lost and the forgotten and appears like a vague fragrance, taste or perfume wafting along in some windy corridor. The technique of the film is good but it has no depth, hence no real meaning.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines</p></br><a href="../users/A3AEYDNYCWH2IZ.html">A3AEYDNYCWH2IZ</a><br/><p>Not what I expected but very good.

I stopped watching at this point, so I did not find out whether these cheap dramatics were followed by a scene of Scully Moore fast asleep while Lush Mulder frequents the local licka sto, as my homies in South Central like to say.  If this was not the ensuing development then either the movie is totally lacking in realism or the audience is treated to a plot line that involves Scully Moore contending with Lush Mulder coming down with the French Fits whilst they are on the lam from the saucer people and the NSA and posssibly also the Lizard Men from Denver Airport and the Rand Corporation and some members of the British Royal Family.  Yes, I imagine that the rest of the movie went something like this:  "Scully, I think I figgered it out.  The saucer people are sending pink elephants to steal our memory.  That explains my blackouts, don't it?"  "Jesus Mulder, can't you keep it together here?"</p></br><a href="../users/A23GFTVIETX7DS.html">A23GFTVIETX7DS</a><br/><p>This sci-fi thriller starring Julianne Moore attempts to cross "The X-Files" and one of those harrowing made-for-TV movies about missing children - and fails.  Telly (Moore) is still grieving for her nine year old son Sam who was killed in a plane crash three years before.  Her husband (Anthony Edwards) tries to be sympathetic to her crippled emotional state, and her therapist (Gary Sinese) gently tries to help her move on from the tragedy.  When Telly comes home to find that all the photographs containing Sam's image have vanished, with those of Telly and her husband as a couple in their place, she first blames her husband.  But Telly finds a much more complicated truth as all the evidence that Sam existed begins to disappear.  She teams up with an ex-hockey player, Ash, who shares a glimmer of memory of his own daughter, and together, they pursue an explanation<br /><br />Everything in this film comes easily, making the film flat and uninteresting.  The screenplay never digs deep enough to be satisfying and instead remains a glossy chase scene that ends with a breathless revelation that makes little sense. Moore has such a generalized expression of distress that it's difficult to imagine her as a mother desperate for her only child.  Sinese is much better as her quiet, contemplative therapist.  Dominic West as Ash is, well, (and you knew I had to say this before the end of my review) forgettable.<br /><br />Skip this one.  Even the weakest "The X-Files" episode was more compelling than this.</p></br><a href="../users/A3IDMLOWLHWNDJ.html">A3IDMLOWLHWNDJ</a><br/><p>Juliane Moore stars in this steaming celluloid melting pile of retardedness that takes everything bad about "The X Files" & stretches into an hour & forty five minute embarassment on how to properly screw up one's movie career.<br /><br />The film starts with Moore's character losing her young son. No, he didn't die he just "disappeared". She's told to believe he died in a plane crash. Thinking its all a cruel practical joke she confronts her husband portrayed by Anthony Edwards (its "Goose" from "Top Gun"!). Her husband doesn't know what she's ranting about because he knows they don't have children. She, of course, thinks otherwise and finds the father of one her sons friends who was also on "the plane".<br /><br />After some investigating both the mother & the friends father find out that the truth is out there & find out that both of their kids were abducted by aliens. In order to save her son, the mother must confront the aliens.<br /><br />My God did this movie suck major league ass. I couldn't believe it. If you took any episode from "The X Files" that dealt with Scully & her baby, twist some plot threads around here & there you would have "The Forgotten". Even the scene in the film where Woodard (there's a great cop. Not!) shoots the human alien in the back seven to ten times is taken directly from "The X Files"!<br /><br />Whats wrong with this film? Its a bit weird to see Moore and Edwards in the same movie as husband & wife. Why? They both worked together on "ER" years ago!<br /><br />The film wasn't scary or chilling at all.<br /><br />Where are the damn aliens?! The human equivalent doesn't count.<br /><br />I busted a gut laughing when the guy gets sucked up in the air after he says "They are listening." I was waiting for the Wicked Witch Of The West to show up!<br /><br />I could go on all day, but you get the drift.<br /><br />This movie lives up to its name. Whats the name of this film? Don't ask me, I've learned to forgive & forget.</p></br><a href="../users/ACMAUJEBY6GJF.html">ACMAUJEBY6GJF</a><br/><p>...and actually in the start (the first 45 minutes or so) I found myself missing the unpleasant atmosphere required from any good supernatural thriller. But then; Bang! I jumped high in my seat four times after I had reached the last part of the movie (and when finally it begins). The special effects including the sound is amazing, and sneakes in on the viewer unexpected and sudden -just when I was getting a little bored (not that the story is non-involving, it's interesting and had my attention absolutely -well, it starts out a bit slow) things start to take a different turn than what I had expected. Not that the plot is Sixth Sence-amazing, but the film-makers have done their very best with what they've had to work with. So, where "White Noise" failed to have a completed plot but managed to contain the scary atmosphere instead -it's sometimes the oposite with "The Forgotten". But some scenes here were really amazing, and the movie is highly entertaning. This being said; I am a big fan of the supernatural thriller genre, and I find this among the better. And it was less X-files than I feared.

This one has an excellent surprise climax.<br /><br />  A woman (Julianne Moore) is still mourning her son 14 months after he is gone.  She regularly sees her psychiatrist who is trying to help her get back to normal.  Then one day all the photos in her album are gone and the home movies are blank. her husband (Anthony Edwards) tells her he did nothing to them.  There is no child.  later, she talks with her lunch-friend.  She doesn't know about her son either.  Everyone tells her their is no son.  She goes to the library.  She can't find the newspaper story about the plane crash.<br /><br />  One night, she meets a man, Ashton (Dominic West).  His daughter use to play with her son and they died in the same plane crash.  This is just the beginning of the story.<br /><br />  DVD includes the theatrical version and a choice to play the Extended Version with Alternate Ending.<br /><br />  Please watch the theatrical version first, so you will be totally surprised.</p></br><a href="../users/A1XJOSJN6FHFO0.html">A1XJOSJN6FHFO0</a><br/><p>I just got up from watching this outstanding movie. Here we have a young woman who believes she had a child, 9 year old Sam, but who is told that the child only exists in her mind.<br /><br />Even her husband tells her that, but she cannot let go of the belief that he truly lived, and was killed in a plane crash with a group of other children.<br /><br />  This movie was a real pull on the mind.  You knew what she was feeling was true or there would be no storyline, yet could everyone in her world be in on the  evil of making her believe Sam never existed?  Interesting! And to find out it was forces not of this world was really entertaining.<br /><br /> I loved some of the scenes when the characters were pulled out of this world, it was great, just where did they go anyway? And having a happy ending for mom and child was the cream on the cake.  Of course, one can't help but wonder what happened to all the other children that were 'forgotten.' All in all I think this movie was very good and I believe you will enjoy watching it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2N69DJM8NVYZ6.html">A2N69DJM8NVYZ6</a><br/><p>I watched this movie couple of times, but still didn't get the plot of the movie.

I didn't like it, not worth watching it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KD8NJPZ01R37.html">A1KD8NJPZ01R37</a><br/><p>I thought fer-sure this was going to be yet another stupid (kinda) sci-fi or horror movie that turns out to be all in the main character's mind. Mulholland Dr., Secret Window, etc.. BUT, that's not the case here, as you discover pretty early on in the movie. When the NSA shows up, you know there's something to it -but what?? This movie definitely falls into the catagory of good sci-fi/drama/mystery, yet did'nt spend a zillion dollars to make it, and it still has a great story and delivers entertainment.<br /><br />It's pretty good, and people's claims that they actually jumped in their seats a few times, are not exaggerated.<br /><br />There's not much in the theatre's right now either(10-18-04), so pickins are slim anyway.

Then, upon watching this episode, we would realize that not all of our questions were answered, but instead left on the table to allow us to figure out ourselves or not at all.  That was a huge downfall for The Forgotten that really irritated me throughout the picture.  Here we had the gorgeous concept of abduction, a mother's ability never to forget the child she lost, and this enormous possibility of government conspiracies, but it literally went nowhere.  Throughout the film new concepts, new ideas, and possibilities that seem endless constantly attack us, but we are given no explanation.  That is what bothered me the most.  We had the framework for a very decent little sci-fi thriller, but instead director Joseph Ruben decided to go with a familiar story that would appeal to a non-intelligent audience instead of a crisp thriller that could have really bent your mind.  I wanted my mind to wrap around this film, but instead I think my mind fell asleep.<br /><br />Julianne Moore did a decent job in this film, but perhaps gave a bit too much emotion behind her character.  If she wasn't crying than she was screaming or running.  I wanted to see the strength of this woman and her perseverance to find her missing child, not this emotional nutcase that has a reaction to everything that happens to her.  I know that Moore can do a very emotionally heavy film, but I didn't think that this project needed her to be at such a top level.  Perhaps that is what was wrong with this film.  The focus was completely off.  Here we are focusing on the emotional struggle that Moore is going through, when we really should be trying to uncover the truth behind the disappearance.  There was nearly no attempt to find out the truth.  For some strange reason, I remember feeling like the honest truth was difficult for our actors to say.  I felt as if they were forced into this side event that would stop Moore from being so emotional.  Or, perhaps, nobody really knew what the truth was.  Here we had this huge surprise Shyamalan-esque styled ending, but I never really felt as if the actors were on the same page.  I could hear Ruben gasping from excitement in the background, but Sinise, West, and even Woodard seemed less surprised by it all.<br /><br />I think that this film didn't do as well as hoped because the lines between what type of genre this was were skewed.  Was it a sci-fi?  People flying up into the air just doesn't quite do it enough for me (kinda felt like a cheap way of explaining things).  Was Moore really just imagining all of this?  Yet another question that needed a definite answer by the end because there were so many other elements happening that a direct answer would have only strengthened the entire film.  Did anyone really care why the child was abducted?  It seemed a bit flimsy to me, but again, I am no mother.  I needed something, perhaps others did not, but there were these huge gaping plot holes in the film that needed to be filled somehow, but apparently the repairman couldn't make it to the set.  We just jumped from moment to moment without any further explanation or reasoning.  I cannot express this enough.  That is the ultimate downfall for this film, the utter lack of coherence and connection between everything.  I felt like I was watching a connect-the-dots that followed no order and the performers just went where ever they wanted instead of going from point A to point B.<br /><br />I think I have gone a bit sidetracked here, but when I think of this film, I just cannot put everything together.  I don't need something handed to me on a silver platter, in fact, I love movies that make me ponder the truth.  The sad part about The Forgotten is that I nearly forgot why I was watching it midway through the film.  I was connected to nothing and the unanswered questions that only broadened the scope of the film into this massive ordeal that nobody, from the director to the actors could handle.<br /><br />I would also like to comment on the DVD itself of this film.  For me, the theatrical version was much better than the extended version.  I have heard others say that they would prefer to watch the extended because it gives us a better answer to the end (and I won't get into unanswered questions again), but for me the original ending was a hair better.  Perhaps it is because I watched the extended first and it gave me such a sour taste in my mouth that the original might have just helped dissipate that sour sensation.  Either way, that is my two cents.<br /><br />Overall, I thought this was nothing more than just your standard issue sci-fi thriller that could have been pushed into the category of interesting or creative if it wasn't so clich&eacute;d ridden with this overwhelming desire to be "secretive".  The secret is given away by the middle of the film, which still doesn't answer the questions that we have.  Ruben was working with too big of a concept for his britches with this project and you can tell by the finished product that more could have been done to capture the sensationalism of aliens and abduction.  It has been done before in other films, why couldn't he do it here?  Yet another question that will never be answered as this film becomes just another cinematic mediocrity.<br /><br />Grade: *** out of *****</p></br><a href="../users/AVCRD98TH48RN.html">AVCRD98TH48RN</a><br/><p>There are clues laced throughout this para-normal mind-bender that invoke many questions and possible explanations as to what is happening.  I rented this film with the only expectation being that it will probably be something along the lines of an "X Files" episode with Julianne Moore in the title role.  Just from the packaging I was reminded of another film, "The Mothman Prophecies," that eerily has more than a few things in common with "The Forgotten."  By the end of the film I was also comparing it to another film called "Dark City."  I liked both of those films, and the "X Files," so it is really no surprise that I went along for the ride on this one as well.  There is a mystery to be solved with potential for altering perceptions about our place in the world, or perhaps it is just a showcase for how exquisitely bizarre the workings of the human mind really are.  I enjoyed this mystery tour enough to follow along and be eventually rewarded for my participation.  What sets this film apart from the rest in its genre is that there are some real people at the center of the story, ones that are easy to relate to and worth caring about.  Julianne Moore carries the film on her small shoulders with great depth of character and obviously affecting the performances of all that come into contact with her immense talent.  On the DVD there is a second, alternate ending that is clearly not the better choice; but there is one of the deleted scenes that should have been included in the final cut because I was wondering by film's end what happened to that particular character, and it would have tied up that loose end neatly.  The theatrical release ending is more ominous while the alternate is much lighter and less provocative.  There are some slow, even bewildering moments, but the payoff in the end is worth the journey.  Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/ADKA2MJQQCMTO.html">ADKA2MJQQCMTO</a><br/><p>A pretty decent preformance by Moore, a great first-half, and some genuine "jump" moments just aren't enough to save "Forgotten" from itself.<br /><br />Without giving anything away, "Forgotten" takes a left turn in the second half that's so severe and so ridiculous that it's hard to take seriously anymore.  At that point, a decent story is driven straight into the ground.<br /><br />There simply wound up being one too many moments when I found myself saying "They can't be serious?"</p></br><a href="../users/AVQJD41PLPOOQ.html">AVQJD41PLPOOQ</a><br/><p>The first half of this film takes you into a psychological mystery that succeeds in keeping you wondering.<br /><br />However, by the time the mystery is finally revealed, you're ultimately let down by what feels like a cliche of the "aliens stole my brain!" revelation (hey, it practically happened to Arnold in TOTAL RECALL).  Unfortunately, even Julianne Moore's good acting can't save this one.<br /><br />Perhaps if this ridiculous story had been used for an X-FILES movie of the week, it would have made more sense.</p></br><a href="../users/ANAYSRE3LX8GZ.html">ANAYSRE3LX8GZ</a><br/><p>Well, I did not have a clue what this film was about when my girlfriend recomended it. I did not have a clue what it was going to be about, but as it started I thought it was gonnah be about a women who's made up something in her head but beleives it happend. And the film does try to make you beleive thats the case for a while. But then things pick up and more comes into play and it beacme intreaging for me with a plot that I did not know where it was going, but was anxious to keep watching and find out. The end I guess was acceptable, but I kind of was expecting things to be resolved in some kind of sci-fi confrentation, but the film leaves you with a lot un-anserwed.<br /><br />Anyway, theres nothing anyone can do to change that now. So this is a movie you might wanna see or might not, but expect the unexpected... I see there is a fair few thumbs down from reveiwers here, but make up your own mind.

At best, there's a few "thrilling" parts to it, including probably the best and most effective car crash I've ever seen in a movie, a couple of kinda freaky parts with people being sucked into the sky and an alright idea for a story. At worst, a lot of the dialogue in the movie just flat out seemed phony to me, especially in the early scenes where Telly (Julianne Moore) is freaking out on her husband for changing the picture and freaking out on her psychiatrist for telling her that her son Sam never existed. This rather cheesy dialogue in this early of the movie made the rest of the film hard to take seriously.<br /><br />The biggest drawback in the movie for me was its anticlimactic ending. Very non exciting and predictable. I watched the ending of the extended version with the alternate ending hoping that maybe it was just the studio's fault for producing such a weak ending, but I honestly couldn't tell any difference between the theatrical ending which I just watched and the alternate ending. So all in all, offers a couple of okay moments for a thriller, but is just too dull and anticlimactical for my taste.</p></br><a href="../users/AUHG8KSHI529U.html">AUHG8KSHI529U</a><br/><p>"The Forgotten" is a strange movie to review.  I really like the performances in the movie and most of the scenes are very effective (although there is much more running and car chasing than a psychological drama really needs).  However, the premise of the movie completely undermines the actual story presented on the screen.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I can't really talk about the plot twists because I don't want to give anything away.  However, let me say this.  Given what is finally revealed in the movie, if that is the real universe this movie inhabits, the story as presented is actually meaningless.  Yes, Telly Paretta's (poignantly played by Julianne Moore) story is sad and we feel for her.  However, there were several characters in this story, given the final state of things, whose story would have been much more interesting and central.  This story is like focusing on a farmer whose pig goes missing in Stalingrad in December 1942 and treating the Nazi invasion as incidental because the farmer gets his favorite pig back.  I mean, aren't there bigger issues here?<br /><br />Anyway, the disk provides an "extended version with alternate ending".  There really isn't much extended here, but the alternate ending is better, but still is not enough to really save the movie.<br /><br />So, ok if you like Julianne Moore and if you like sad, moody tales.  However, if you leave your brain turned on please remove any hard throwable objects from your immediate viewing area or you could end up losing your television.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KEZLJ59C1JVH.html">A3KEZLJ59C1JVH</a><br/><p>I was afraid that "The Forgotten" was going to be just like all the other crappy thriller/horror movies that have been released over the past few years, but this film was pretty interesting and the ending was not at all craptastic.<br /><br />Basically, the movie opens by introducing Telly (Julianne Moore) as a grieving mother whose nine-year-old son supposedly died in a plane crash 14 months ago. In a very "X-Files" sort of way, Telly is stunned when her husband Jim (Anthony Edwards) suddenly tried to convince her that their son never existed. Everyone is under the impression that Telly is delusional...no one else in town has any memory of her child. Telly finally meets up with her neighbor, Ash (Dominic West), whose daughter was also aboard the plane that crashed. At first Ash has no memory of the children and is convinced that Telly is crazy, but she finally helps him trigger memories of his daughter. The two parents embark on a desperate and dangerous search in order to determine the truth behind what happened to their children and ultimately discover who (actually, more like WHAT) is behind the mystery.<br /><br />I think it would have been interesting to include a better explanation of why the "experiment" occurred in the first place. (I'd go into more detail, but I really don't want to spoil the plot for anyone!) I also would have appreciated having a better understanding of what Gary Sinese's character was up to at the end of the film and what the hell happened to Jim (is he still wandering around dazed and confused somewhere?). The movie doesn't go into great detail about HOW all these crazy things are happening and what exactly the "creepy people" (including Linus Roache's character) are supposed to be. That didn't bother me too much, but some people might not appreciate it. I was just happy that there were plenty of shocking moments in the film (I think I lost five years off my life when that car hit Telly's passenger door...that made me scream!) and that the ending was not stupid or predictable.<br /><br />"The Forgotten" is not a great movie, but it's a pretty good one...definitely worth checking out.</p></br><a href="../users/A391YPR0NFTCLK.html">A391YPR0NFTCLK</a><br/><p>This is just a neat movie, its entertaining and relaxing.

I have to give due to Julianne Moore on making this film actually work - with a different actress, it could have died a death. (Nicole Kidman was originally rumoured to have the lead role, do we really think that would have worked? A bit too Others-ish I think.)<br /><br />The film is based around a very elaborate mind game, which does get a bit confusing after a while, but on a second viewing, you could probably see things starting to happen, which will make more sense as the film carries on. Telly (Julianne) being able to taste coffee, and wanting to know where hers was, despite not having coffee that morning, thinking that she did have a pen in her bag, when she didn't, and thinking her car was parked in one place, when it was parked in another. There's an awful lot that could have come straight out of an X-Files episode, and sometimes it does feel like it should have stayed as an episode, rather than being stretched to a full length movie.<br /><br />There are some fantastic scare moments in this, including people getting snatched off the ground and a car crash scene that works so well, I actually screamed. Thank God I wasn't holding my drink at the time, I believe I would have soaked myself. I got another shock at the end, as Linus Roache, who appears with very little dialogue, actually gave me the fright of my life, as he looked an older version of someone I know. It actually gave me shivers up my spine. (Interesting little fact, all the characters remain in black, apart from their memories, up until the end.)<br /><br />There's a little bit of a romantic subplot thrown in there, which works, but doesn't in a way. It feels wrong to be thrown into this movie, while Telly is desperately trying to figure out what's going on in her life.<br /><br />The film seems to end, and doesn't really end up explaining itself in any way whatsoever. You're left confused, wondering what on earth happened, and especially what happened to the people who were snatched off the ground! Where did they go?<br /><br />If you want a scare, and a curiousity-rousing movie, then go for this. Otherwise leave it well alone, cos you'll end up more puzzled than you did at the start.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KB1H0S7T6JX1.html">A3KB1H0S7T6JX1</a><br/><p>The Forgotten brings to the screen the story of a mother who refuses to accept what everyone (including her own husband) seems to be telling her about her son never having existed and having been part of her imagination all along.  Things get more complicated when she begins sensing not only that she did have a son, but that he is still alive, and that there are others who are also having similar feelings...<br /><br />It is a movie about human relations, hope and second chances, but most importantly about trust, inner strength, courage, sacrifice, and how love-motherly love, can overcome and prevail even in the most difficult of situations.<br /><br />There are slight hints of Arrival, and strong/obvious elements of the X-Files.<br /><br />Julianne Moore, Dominic West, Gary Sinise, and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least.  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)!<br /><br />The only setback is in relation to these characters not having, not having parents-grandparents, brothers-sisters, best friends-distant friends, or is everyone under the effect?

But the movie is certainly beautiful to look at with the gorgeous Julianne constantly bathed in ghostly and ethereal hues of blue and grey that contrast startlingly with her fiery red hair- there's also some fabulous aerial views of New York City, the symbolic significance of which becomes obvious later in the movie.<br /><br />Questions of loss, grief, and the special union between mother and son form the thematic center of the Forgotten, as Moore plays Telly Paretta, a woman haunted by the memory of her son Sam. The child died in plane 14 months ago, and her worried and affectionate husband, played by Anthony Edwards, and her composed, consoling psychiatrist, Dr. Munce (Gary Sinise), try in vain to help her cope with her sudden loss. She constantly watches a video of Sam, moons over photographs of him, and lovingly touches a baseball mitt that he left behind.  Telly is obviously exploring the emotional pain and grief experienced by a mother, and is trying desperately to move on. She's recently decided to return to her job as a freelance editor.<br /><br />It soon becomes clear that things are not as they seem. Sam's image mysteriously begins to disappear from the photographs, and then her husband, her doctor, and even her neighbors tell her that she never had a son. Telly is convinced they are wrong, and fiercely maintains that her son was real. One night, in the local leaf blown and windswept park, she meets the drunken Ash Correll (Dominic West), the father of a girl who was also supposedly killed in the same plane crash with Sam. She desperately tries to make him remember. Ash, a former professional hockey player, is drowning in booze and fiercely denies ever having a daughter. At first he thinks Telly is crazy but then he uncovers some evidence, and is forced to face up to the truth.<br /><br />There's lots of gratuitous action - mostly a lot of running - interspersed with some quieter moments as Telly and Ash try to reconcile their differences and stay focused on finding out whether their children are really dead and where they might be hidden. There's also a constant eerie and peculiar atmosphere created as Telly becomes convinced that both her and Ash are constantly being watched by "something." The acting is pretty good, with Moore and West giving the strongest and most provocative performances, and the interplay between them is full of tension, but also interspersed with some nice moments of quiet intimacy. Moore is particularly good - bringing a blunt, gustiness to the role, and she is totally convincing as a mother who obviously had a very special bond with her son. Telly and Ashe are two very different people who normally wouldn't have had much to do with each other, but who have been flung together through monumental adversity.<br /><br />The cinematography is quite beautiful and the film generally has a great sense of pacing. Viewers will find themselves trying to figure whether there is some grand conspiracy or not, but the eventual resolution, while surprising, still leaves a lot of questions unanswered.  But with all its faults, The Forgotten is an interesting, mind twisting thriller, that effectively explores the intensity of memory, the sadness and desperation of grief, and how the human mind ultimately handles these intense emotions.

All of the elements are there; a strong cast (Julianne Moore, Dominic West, Gary Sinise), a fascinating plot, eerie music and cinematography, and enough on-screen jolts to leave you with an empty popcorn bag by film's end.<br /><br />The problem is this; the screenwriters set up such an enigmatic, mind-boggling story that it soon became apparent to me that a plausible, satisfying explanation would not be possible.  And I was right.  "The Forgotten" starts off with great promise but it ultimately has nowhere to go.  The script becomes so tripped-up in itself that it ultimately results to cheap, supernatural occurrences in order to explain away everything that's happened throughout the entire film.  I felt cheated.<br /><br />Once the filmmakers resort to a certain overly-used special effect to pull their picture out of a nosedive, "The Forgotten" shape-shifts from a psychological thriller to science fiction and lastly to comedy, and unintentional comedy at that.<br /><br />This wasn't easy film to bring together, I'm sure. The filmmakers tried to keep a balance between creepy weirdness and unbelievability. However, the final premise was just a little too silly to really believe. I was frustrated with this film because I think it actually backed itself into a corner, and then took the clich&eacute; out.<br /><br />Overall, "The Forgotten" is a truly frightening and entertaining film despite its glaring story problems.  I loved how I was getting goose bumps, jumping out of my seat, and yelping throughout the movie.  It was a fun, SCARY experience and I can unashamedly say that I enjoyed myself.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FBGZ4E6KGIW2.html">A3FBGZ4E6KGIW2</a><br/><p>At first, I was really into the movie.  I really wanted to know what was going to happen.  Toward the middle, I started to lose a little interest.  I would have given this movie a better rating if it wasn't for the ending.  I wish they would have done something else with it instead of having it come off so weak.  Overall, it's worth a rental when there is nothing better on TV.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZBOBV9H1HDV.html">A3LZBOBV9H1HDV</a><br/><p>"The Forgotten" is great! A well-made, psychological thriller that keeps you guessing. It is well-executed, well-conceived, and superb. Julianne Moore (who was recently on screen as Audrey Woods in "Laws Of Attraction" (2004) stars as Telly Paretta, a woman whose son died in a plane crash and finds out that she created memories of a son never had. Dominic West (who was last seen on screen as Bill Dunbar in "Mona Lisa Smile" (2003) plays Ash Correll, a man whose has the same experience as Telly. They both go on a quest to search for the truth. They are also being chased down by government officials who don't want them to remember. Julianne Moore's performance is well-executed and superb. Dominic West's performance is great and superb. Anthony Edwards (who was recently seen on screen as Brains in "Thunderbirds" (2004) & as Happy in "Northfork" (2003) plays Jim Paretta, Telly's hubsand. Gary Sinise (who was recently on screen as Ray Ritchie in "The Big Bounce" (2004) plays Dr. Jack Munce, her psychologist.

This movie makes you think.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KUUII2GSHN7T.html">A3KUUII2GSHN7T</a><br/><p>I'd been scouting the upcoming films and it didn't look promising. So when I saw a trailer for The Forgotten, I said to myself, "This is a godsend." My conjecture was right on the money. This is an outstanding film; in fact, I'd give it a 8.5 out of 10 if possible. The premise is solid, with only a few weak points, and the special affects are stunning.<br /><br />As for plot.......<br /><br />A mother's life suddenly turns from bad to horrid when all the remnants of her dead son - pictures, video clips, etc. - suddenly turn up missing, as if he's been completely wiped-out from the memory banks of the world. Is she going nuts or is there something more sinister at work here? Well, the latter soon proves to show its menacing-self at just the right moment.<br /><br />I can honsetly say I was on the edge of my seat for the last half of the film, and I'm usually a brutal skeptic in my criticism of film.<br /><br />With a fall lineup that included Alexander as the looming blockbuster(gag me with a wooden spoon), this film will probably go overlooked. But that doesn't mean it's not the standout film of the fall.</p></br><a href="../users/AL277B4AQCWBG.html">AL277B4AQCWBG</a><br/><p>I wish I'd stumbled across this late one night on TV, with no idea of what it was going to be about.  But if, like me, you've seen the trailer, then don't even bother.  You'll be waiting 85 minutes for confirmation of everything you've already guessed.  It's a good-looking, well-crafted movie of course, with a wonderful cast and a delicious premise, but it's let down by the screenplay.  About on par with a reasonable episode of "The X-Files", Gerald Di Pego's tale of abducted children and their seemingly delusional parents falls too quickly into the repetitive pattern of a chase movie and never really makes the most of the potential for ambiguity at its core.  There's nothing clever about it, nothing that throws you off.  Nor, once all is revealed, does it sufficiently explain how the aliens managed to do what they did, or when, or why.  I presume we're meant to forget about that as our eyes well up over scenes of familial reunion.  Whatever.  This could have been a wonderful story about the psychology of grief or a creepy sci-fi thriller.  In the end, it manages to be neither - trivializing one for the sake of the other.  Julianne Moore fans might be interested to see her give another emotionally-fraught-yet-filled-with-inner-resolve performance, but that's about all that's really of interest here.</p></br><a href="../users/A2582KMXLK2P06.html">A2582KMXLK2P06</a><br/><p>This is one case where explaining the storyline would totally spoil the mystery and suspense of the Forgotten, so I flat out *refuse* to do that. Approach with extreme caution when reading reviews for this film as they *will* spoil the majority of it. The Forgotten is honestly the kind of movie where absolutely *nothing* should be explained for fear of giving away unnecessary spoilers, other than the following-<br /><br />- Julianne Moore plays a convincing mother character who strongly believes her son was alive and well at one point but everyone in her life (such as her husband and psychiatrist) do a remarkable and believable job convincing her otherwise. The million, billion, trillion dollar question is this- is she just imagining she had a son, or did he really exist? That's ALL I'm going to say about the storyline. It simply CANNOT be spoiled.<br /><br />- Expect incredibly interesting, complex and satisfying story development throughout the movie. You won't be able to predict where it's going, believe me. Totally shocking.<br /><br />- Expect a LOT of suspense. This is most certainly not a slow-moving, barely exciting type of film. No way.<br /><br />- I've really grown to appreciate the acting talents of Julianne Moore over the years, but this movie finally has me convinced she's really believable and talented. I will never underestimate her skills again.<br /><br />And that's it folks. I will say no more about it than this.  It's for the better, believe me.</p></br><a href="../users/A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ.html">A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ</a><br/><p>The Forgotten features Telly Paretta (Julianne Moore), who has been in mourning because of the death of her 9-year-old son, Sam.  She's been grieving for over a year, and like a prisoner counting the days incarcerated, she can recite the time since his death down to the millisecond.<br /><br />The thing is, everyone is telling her she's delusional.  Even though she swears he lived, and subsequently died in a plane crash, everyone, her shrink (Gary Sinise), and even her husband Jim are telling her the kid didn't exist.  They even go so far as to remove all personal objects one day when she is gone, just so they can convince her she is insane.  Telly, on the other hand, knows what she remembers, and enlists the help of Ash Correll (Dominic West), the father of a little girl who was killed on the same plane flight.  Ash doesn't remember his daughter, but with some help from Telly, and the Detective on the case (Alfre Woodard), they are able to convince Ash.<br /><br />I suppose this could have been taken two ways.  One, we know beforehand that she had a kid, and the kid is missing, but everyone is trying to convince her otherwise.  Or, two, the suspense and mystery is lengthened so that we are unsure if she is actually delusional or not.  As it stands, we know she is telling the truth, and that all others are attemping to convince her otherwise for some strange reason.<br /><br />Anyway, the suspense is top-notch, and the audience is kept guessing until the very end.  It's god an eerie, old-school Alfred Hitchcock feel to it.  What I mean by that is the story is told in such a way that there is genuine intrigue, and not the foreshadowing nonsense of most contemporary movies that allows the audience to figure things out about halfway through the viewing.<br /><br />Be on the lookout for a specific special effects scene in which a reverse bungee jump type maneuver is accomplished.  It's gasp-worthy, and a nice touch that allows the viewer to empathize a bit with the helplessness being experienced by Telly.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>And thats the problem with this B-Grade thriller.  It's completly and utterly FORGETTABLE, and I say that mostly because it fails to deliver when it has the chance to.  The plot is actually pretty unique in itself, the idea of waking up one day and having everything you've thought you've known be a lie, the children you've raised never existing and everyone you've ever known is convinced your crazy.  Yeah, so the plot is decent and the acting is pretty good.  Julianne Moore is a good actress and she plays the distressed mother quite well.  So in this film she plays a woman whose son was killed in a plane wreck or so she thought.  She's been seeing a shrink for some time trying to resolve her feelings of loss.  But soon things start to change.  The pictures in the house of her son are gone, his room has changed, his things are missing and all of a sudden her husband and friends and shrink are all saying that she never bore a child and that she's been living a lie for years believing something that never happened.  Add in some aliens and you have a classic B-Grade sci-fi film.  The only problem is that, while building up great suspence and delivering some eerie performances the final few frames just fall to pieces.  It's almost like the writters sat down and said "we have a great concept and a great two thirds of a script, but I just can't fingure out how to end this $hit...what should we do?" and the producers said "anything, I need my movie" and so they just threw together an ending that is probably the worst ending I've ever seen.  It makes no sense and all the suspence and drama that had built up throughout the film is null in void after watching the pathetic excuse for an ending...and don't even get me started on the alternate ending supplied on the DVD...it's even worse!  I just was dissapointed, as were the critics since for the most part this film was panned.  It has it's moments, and there are a few jumpy scenes, and if it weren't for the appauling ending this film would be a decent thriller (nothing brilliant) but at least stomachable and worth a watch every once in a while, but the ending kills it for me.  And that's why I say it's forgettable, because it builds up speed as it races towards it's finale but it never quite makes it off the runway, it never delivers that final blow that could have sealed the deal and made this a great thriller...instead it fizzles and dies and remains a lame attempt at a cheap thrill.</p></br><a href="../users/A39NS429FYXAD1.html">A39NS429FYXAD1</a><br/><p>The fantastic, committed performances of the talented cast sustains this overlong episode of THE TWILIGHT ZONE worth watching.  Julianne, Dominic, Linus, Alfre, Gary...even the kids...not a bad apple in the bunch.<br /><br />Two endings included to choose from, so take your pick.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the commentary track from the Writer & Director doesn't offer much behind-the-scenes insight, except to point out the distressing (and all too common) reality of how little communication and understanding existed between them during production.<br /><br />If nothing else, it's great to watch these talents actors and be reminded of the superheroic potential of that great invisible weapon: the permanent umbilicle cord that exists between mother and child!</p></br><a href="../users/A1R602SXNGOMJ4.html">A1R602SXNGOMJ4</a><br/><p>Even after seeing this film I'm still not sure what to think.

She is stunned when her psychiatrist and her husband tell her that she has created eight years of memories of a son she never had. But when she meets the father of one of her son's friend who is having the same experience, Telly embarks on a mission to prove her son's existence and her sanity.<br /><br />That's the plot but I don't understand it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2WX1UESDOLXRE.html">A2WX1UESDOLXRE</a><br/><p>Certain moments made me gasp or hold my breath. Others left me going, "That's it?" I'm sure that other people, who have seen the trailer and heard the hype, may be left thinking just that-- This is it? That's all? Come on, give me a little bit more! Despite it's shortcomings, The Forgotten is a passable thriller that will at least keep you guessing, even if you don't feel like guessing any more.<br /><br />Julianne Moore is Telly. She's grieving for the death of her 9 year old son, killed in a plane crash. She's seeing a therapist (Gary Sinise) who tries to help her cope and her husband (Anthony Edwards) is understanding. Everyday she goes to her son's dresser and looks at photos and holds his baseball glove. One day at the dresser, the photos are gone. It's like her son has been erased. Her therapist tells her that she never had a son; she miscarried and imagined a life with a son. She doesn't buy this theory at all, confident that there is a conspiracy. Ash (Dominic West) is also a grieving parent (his daughter died in the same plane crash). But suddenly one day, he doesn't remember his own daughter, until Telly rips the wallpaper off in one room, revealing that it was in fact his daughter's room. The two spend the rest of the film together, running from people who keep chasing them for reasons we don't know and trying to figure out what the heck happened to their children and their own memories.<br /><br />It is a bit clunky. The overall premise is exciting. What would you do if one day someone told you that you never had a child? Or husband? Or wife? But the payoff in the end is, I feel, a cop-out. Short of giving the end away, I'll just say that it's very X-Files-ish. So if you like that show, you'll probably like this movie. It does bend your mind and about 60 minutes in, you'll be rubbing your head wondering what in the world is going on. Julianne Moore and Dominic West are great together, stopping to be sad just when they've stopped being chased.<br /><br />Check this out sometime, it's an interesting ride. RECOMMENDED!</p></br><a href="../users/AVOCNUFOXUCA6.html">AVOCNUFOXUCA6</a><br/><p>Going into this movie, one has to expect it to be some kind of sci-fi or horror movie, and it certainly is.  It's essentially an episode of the Twilight Zone, stretched into a long and tedious movie.  Stripped of filler and reduced to its essentials, this actually could have been an excellent 30-minute TV segment.  There are some interesting ideas in here.  Sadly, as a movie it fails to engage the viewer's interest to any degree.  It's no wonder this movie seems like little more than a long television episode; virtually all of the screenwriter's previous credits are for television material.  Even the direction seems more like TV direction than movie direction.<br /><br />A big problem with this movie is its lack of internal logic.  In any sci-fi or horror movie or book, the events and actions may be as fantastic or unreal as the creators wish, but the audience can only suspend its disbelief if the story hews to some kind of internal logic.  The story must make sense in terms of the ground rules it sets up for itself.  Sadly, toward the end of this movie, any pretense of internal logic goes right through the roof, and the audience is left scratching its head about what exactly went on.<br /><br />The performances are not to blame for the flaws of this film, which is why I give it two stars instead of one; the cast valiantly does its best with the material given to them.<br /><br />This isn't an awful movie; you won't be throwing things at your TV wishing you had 2 hours of your life back after it's over.  But you may find that by the time the movie is over, you've started to do your bills, or make a snack, and not quite realize it's over.  You won't be inclined to go back and see what you missed.</p></br><a href="../users/AJMU8VVFKMZI4.html">AJMU8VVFKMZI4</a><br/><p>This is a horribly implausible storyline, but probably could have been better executed had it been an episode of the defunct X-Files.  The begining is intriguing but somewhere in the middle you sense that the writers didn't truely know where to go.  I think I could have swallowed this more, if in fact 'The Others' needed the children for something-not simply to watch this woman go crazy like a lab rat.  Her doctor even says that they've been doing this sort of thing for years-decades even.  So you're telling me they've been success of making people disappear and just watching the festivites?  For their own amusement?  But didn't the NSA guy-say something about survivial?  SO which is it?  You needed the children to survive or do you need them for amusement?  And even if you buy that this is a one time experiment gone wrong-and you buy into the Disney-like fairy tale ending-that still leaves the problem of aliens hoovering above doing what they will.  So is the ultimate goal to get the children back or do away with the aliens.  How can you buy into the peace of mind and security when the children return but know they are still out there?<br /><br />Julianne Moore give a good performance-for the material, I think.  Dominic West made me wince each time he came onto the screen.  Overall-save ninety minutes of your life and skip this one.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>The Forgotten (Joseph Ruben, 2004)<br /><br />This is one of those movies I really wanted to see, then forgot existed, then remembered, and finally got round to renting on DVD. The trailers made it look like it was going to be a fun, turn-your-brain-off suspense thriller with aliens capable of ripping roofs off houses. I dig it.<br /><br />The problem is that about halfway through it got ludicrous, and no roofs had been ripped off yet. (Except in the trailer, which committed the unpardonable sin of showing scenes from way, way farther in the movie than it should have.) After that, it just kept getting more and more ludicrous. I kept watching, though to be honest I'm not quite sure why, right up until the end. I was writing the review in my head while watching, a horrible vice of mine, and I was saying "ludicrous, but watchable." Then came the end, and my skull went "OMGWTFBBQWORSTENDINGEVAR!!1!!~!1!" Once my head cleared, I realized it wasn't, in fact, the worst ending in film history (and had, oddly, not a thing to do with barbecuing-- all films should end with a big barbecue, the world would be a much happier place if they did. But I digress.), but man, it was a stinker. Had they cut off the movie five minutes before they did, it would be ludicrous but watchable. Tacking on the final scene made it ludicrous and just plain bad.<br /><br />Telly (Julianne Moore, who needs no introduction) lost her son Sam (Mind the Gap's Christopher Kovaleski) in an airplane crash fourteen months before the story begins. She is still obsessed over his death, and her husband Jim (ER's Anthony Edwards) and her therapist, Dr. Munce (The Stand's Gary Sinise), are trying to convince her. Then, out of nowhere, something odd happens-- all the pictures and video of Sam vanish. Jim and Munce, realizing the gig is up, inform Telly that, in fact, she never had a son; the whole thing is in her head. She thinks she's going nuts until she runs into Ash (Chicago's Dominic West), whose daughter Lauren was killed in the same crash as Sam.<br /><br />All the pieces are there for a good psychological thriller. A good conspiracy film. Even a good film about alien abduction. (I know, there's never been such a beast, but there's always a first time.) This, however, is not it. It goes for all the predictable plot twists, adds car chases wherever possible, and goes for the ambiguous-yet-sappy ending that Hollywood so loves, but manages to not satisfy a single filmgoer with half a brain. If you've seen the trailers, you've already seen pretty much the entire film, and you don't have to put up with the horrible ending. **, because the first half is at least watchable.</p></br><a href="../users/ANIMV3SPDD8SH.html">ANIMV3SPDD8SH</a><br/><p>A woman is told her nine year old son, who reportedly died in a plane crash, actually never existed. Is her missing son part of a diabolical plot or is she merely delusional? Unfortunately, it's the former, and the 'diabolique' comes in the form of modern movie super-villains, (think X-Files). A schizophrenic would have been far more interesting, but it moves along swiftly, like a glossy moralistic episode of 'The Twilight Zone', and never tries to be anything more than a big budget 'B' movie for bean brains.</p></br><a href="../users/A3OEECMCM2T4KQ.html">A3OEECMCM2T4KQ</a><br/><p>This unusual feature film seems to have come directly from the offices of Chris Carter. (Millennium, The X Files) When first seeing the previews, I thought, considering the talent, Julianne Moore and Gary Sinese, that this would be a disturbing though sophisticated psychological thriller, a woman haunted from repressed memories, revealing, in the end, a traumatic and evil event. Remembering this past event would be terribly dangerous for her, culminating in a white-knuckle climax. What I didn't expect was this kind of film - a quasi science fictional tale, which, for the most part, leaves the viewer unsatisfied.<br /><br />The performances were all first rate. Julianne Moore is an excellent actress and Gary Sinese as the concerned therapist, although a small role, delivered his usual high standard work. However these fine actors are wasted on a script that was not thought through... perhaps this sounded like a great idea in fifty words or less, pitched to the movie executives over a long, liquid lunch, but the final product misses something, and that is a movie which had the potential to be great and ended up being mediocre.<br /><br />It is impossible to write about this film without giving too much away, though to be fair, a few scenes that used special effects, particularly those characters literally being whisked away into the sky, was quite impressive.<br /><br />There is so much one can do with the notion of memory, false memory and lost memory, in a fictional tale. A great film that comes to mind is the 90's thriller, Memento, directed and written by Christopher Nolen, starring Guy Pearce as the amnesiac and avenger of his wife's killer. This was a clever film that had the audience guessing from beginning to end.<br /><br />The Forgotten starts compellingly, with Telly Parada (Julianne Moore) struggling to cope with the loss of her 9-year old son. In the first ten minutes of the story, mementos such as photos and videos of the boy start to go missing, until every remnant of his existence vanishes. Is Telly delusional? Did she ever have a son? Her psychiatrist seems to think she's loosing her mind and her husband does as well. Telly won't give up, however, looking up another parent who has also lost a child in the same alleged plane crash. As the film progresses we are informed of the secret, and the story slowly becomes a silly moral tale about the indestructible bonds between mother and child.<br /><br />This is one of those films that has a great director, extraordinary talent, a suspenseful soundtrack and great special effects, unfortunately set against a script that would have been rejected by Chris Carter of the X Files as too silly to be even considered.</p></br></body></html>

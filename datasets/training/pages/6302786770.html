Practically all three leads are interchangeable, as Clint Eastwood's character, mysteriously nicknamed "Blondie," is certainly a bad guy, plus after his desert ordeal, he's quite ugly (for a while).<br /><br />A bit overlong at 162 minutes, yet there would be little fat to trim here (perhaps the bridge sequence?) if cuts had to be made.<br /><br />Saw this in first run a very long time ago. With the advent of home video in the '80s I've been able to reexperience it umpteen times since. During the most recent viewing, I looked beyond familiar characters, plot and dialogue and studied other details, such as camera panning during Eli Wallach's worried search for a gravemarker while Ennio Morricone's magnificent "Ecstasy of Gold" plays, also Leone's timing of facial closeups and quick edits during the climactic three-way cemetery showdown. That all these guys are grimy, sweaty, unwashed and unshaven is certainly accurate for an age and place where fresh laundry and bathtubs could be few and far between.<br /><br />Although filmed in Spain, backgrounds suit the American West nicely. How much of the Civil War was fought in this country's more arid areas is a legitimate question.<br /><br />Morricone's main theme is heard throughout, always in variation. As a very amateur musician and singer who favors harmony, bassline structure and counterpoint to melody, an almost-syncopated downscale string countermelody in this piece, especially as Eastwood gallops off at the end, is a real attention grabber. It's an inspired bit of orchestration, at least for me.<br /><br />Few movies stand up to the scrutiny of repeated viewings as well as this one, and not many American westerns have ever been as good. Bad and/or ugly, maybe.</p></br><a href="../users/A20568D9GRC08W.html">A20568D9GRC08W</a><br/><p>This is Clint's best movie EVER! Not my favorite western, but still pretty awesome. If you're a western fan and you haven't seen this masterpiece, BUY IT NOW!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A1AFXJ8U72MD6L.html">A1AFXJ8U72MD6L</a><br/><p>I watched this again for the DVD commentary. Turns out that Clint and the director were at odds in several areas. Clint actually got some residuals from this movie. He didn't like that the explosives were real and was surprised no one got hurt. I didn't realize Eli Wallach was The Ugly (he was the old guy in THE HOLIDAY) and his army doctor background helped with the torture scene. MY GRADE: A minus to A.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>On of the most impressive things about "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" ("Il Buono, il brutto, il cattivo") is that it is not director Sergio Leone's best film, which would be his next one, 1968's "Once Upon a Time in the West" ("C'era una volta il West"). But this 1966 film has is where Leone moves from his first two spaghetti westerns, the Akira Kurosawa inspired "For a Fistful of Dollars" ("Per un pugno di dollari") and "For a Few Dollars More" ("Per qualche dollaro in pi&ugrave;"), and starts playing on a grander scale.<br /><br />In listening to the commentary on the DVD version of "Once Upon a Time in the West" I learned that all of the actors in his films were dubbed because Leone did not bother with sound when he went out to shoot his movies. If you remember how the invention of sound destroyed the more cinematic aspects of the movies by restricting movement so that actors could be near microphones, then you can appreciate the sense of freedom this gave Leone. The result is a distinctive style that goes well beyond Leone's signature juxtaposition of wide vistas and extreme close ups (often in a single shot, without a cut). Leone also likes to take his time, as evidenced by the final three scenes of the film, where Tuco searches for the grave with the gold, the three-way gunfight, and the parting of the two survivors. His films ran long and were routinely shortened (read: "butchered") for their American releases. But even so, there is a clearly boldness and a flavor to Leone's cinematic vision of the west that is as distinct as that of John Ford or any other classic Hollywood director of westerns you want to name.<br /><br />In the final film of Leone's "Man With No Name" triology, Clint Eastwood (now called Blondie instead of Joe and Manco but obvious the "Good" guy) has a new scam going as a bounty hunter who saves his captures from the rope so that the reward goes up and he can move on to the new town and do the same thing all over again. His pigeon, the "Ugly" Tuco (Eli Wallach), is not exactly happy with the arrangement and finally has the opportunity to reverse their situation. However the former partners find a new unity of purpose when a dying man tells each of them part of the secret location of $200,000 in captured Union cold. Our story takes place in the New Mexico territory (that is where the two particular generals mentioned had minor skirmishes during the Civil War), and the Yankees and Rebels are between the two and the gold. Then, there is the "Bad" Sentenza (Lee Van Cleef), called Angel Eyes, who has also been on the trail of the gold.<br /><br />From an acting perspective the most impressive performance is that of Wallach, although this is partly by default. Tuco never stops talking while Blondie is a man of very few words (but great timing) and Angel Eyes communicates best when he narrows his eyes and glares at people. In the hands of another actor Tuco might have been more of a buffoon, but Wallach develops one of the most multi-dimension characterizations in the history of Westerns. In those brief moments when Tuco stops talking you can see his mind turning over what to do next before heading off full throttle in a new direction.<br /><br />"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" does stand on its own, even though it is the final film of a triology. I originally saw the film in a movie theater and did not see the previous two Leone-Eastwood collaborations until decades later on late night television. But while the order in watching Leone's films is of little consequence to the appreciation of any particular one of them, at some point you should enjoy going through them in chronological order to see exactly how within a five year period he went from ripping off Kurosawa to creating what remains my favorite western of all time.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ01Q3070LT29.html">AQ01Q3070LT29</a><br/><p>Clint Eastwood and Lee van Cleef return in this third film which follows A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS (1964) and FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE (1966). Eli Wallach as &quot;Tuco&quot; is the ugly one. Also with Aldo Giuffre and Mario Brega.<br /><br /> The catchy tune that we have grown to know by Ennio Morricone is in this film. Lyrics by Tommie Connor for the song, &quot;The Soldiers Story&quot;.<br /><br /> Eli Wallach knows where some money is buried. he only knows the name of the cemetary. Clint eastwood knows the name of the grave. This grave contains $200,000. &quot;Tuco&quot; calls the Man With No Name, &quot;Blondie&quot;.<br /><br /> Best of the film series and very clever finale.<br /><br /> The follow-up film (without Clint Eastwood) is: ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST (1968).<br /><br /> DVD includes Theatrical trailer. Separatly, this DVD will show you the 7 Italian deleted scenes, 14 minutes in all, never-before-seen.</p></br><a href="../users/AVCRD98TH48RN.html">AVCRD98TH48RN</a><br/><p>4.5 stars.  In so many words, this is a classic Western.  Anyone who loves Westerns does or will love this film.  The three main actors are all memorable, the story is engrossing, and Sergio Leon's direction is excellent.  The cinematography is superb, ranging from widescreen vistas baked under the Spanish sunshine to repellent close-ups of dirty bounty hunters and the like.  What I did not remember about this film is how incredibly huge it is!  Some of the location shots are extensive and a couple of the scenes encompass Civil War magnitude with thousands of extras(no CGI here, thank the Lord!).  Anyway, I could praise the film, the acting, and all that to no end...but this particular DVD package is fairly lame.  True, it is cheap, but the fact that the sound is only 2-channel is a big disappointment.  With only two of my five speakers blasting that most famous score had me a little deflated, to say the least. However, the picture quality is better than has been suggested, and there is a specail feature of 14 minutes of footage that was flitched off for the U.S. release of the film.  This film is very entertaining, and for the measely price they are asking for one could certainly do worse than this DVD.  Just be sure to wear headphones so you won't notice the 2-channel effect so much.  Take it easy.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y.html">A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y</a><br/><p>This is eastwood's best(along with dirty harry) This has to be the best western ever if not one of the best, it is high up there, It is one of the best movies ever made, with a soundtrack to match.

Every character has its own charm-be it Clint's reluctant style, or ugly's cunning nature and the cruel "bad" guy (determine for yourself who is good, bad or ugly). The music has become kind of an anthem for the "wild wild west" movies and has been copied the world over. I have seen the movie half a dozen times, still I cannot resist playing the DVD whenever I get time. Would highly recommend it to everyone.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />It's not about any "theme," has no deep message, and contains a lot of carnage, but The Good the Bad and the Ugly is in its own way a great movie; always interesting and always moving, the film is carried by its lead actors (especially a scene-stealing Eli Wallach), inspired direction and one helluva score by Ennio Morricone.</p></br><a href="../users/A161ANWB62G3M8.html">A161ANWB62G3M8</a><br/><p>This is a fantastic film, a brilliant example of a western or a war film, as well as being a very entertaining movie.

The character is sort of an even more stylized riff on the bandito, Calvero, he essayed in The Magnificent Seven, which saw that character absorb some of the lunacy of the samurai played by Toshiro Mifune in Seven Samurai; but that's what makes it even better. It's simply one of the greatest comedic performances in film history. He owns the picture, much in the same way as the Lee Van Cleef character owned For A Few Dollars More, and like Van Cleef's character, in that film, Tuco often outsmarts the Eastwood character, One simply cannot turn away, lest miss a sight gag or joke or wince of frustration that sets the screen alive. Much of this is due to the fact that Wallach is, simply put, one of the best and most versatile actors of the last six decades, but much also has to be granted to the film's screenplay, penned by Leone, Agenore Incrocci, and Furio Scarpelli, from a story by Leone and Luciano Vincenzoni. It crackles with depth, humor- especially quotable one and two liners, pathos (see the scenes with Union and Confederate soldiers), and rage, and is one of the rare films that deserves the moniker epic.<br /><br />The Good, The Bad And The Ugly, despite some flaws, is a great film, for it is so engaging and well written that it moves far faster than its three hour time, actually `feeling' more like a 90 minute film; an effect that often occurs in the long and slow films of Bela Tarr. From its opening credits to its end the film never takes itself seriously, which helps mitigate said flaws, and the trilogy, as mentioned, and as a whole, is probably the best example of an artist recognizing his own flaws and correcting them with each subsequent film. This trend would reach its apex in Once Upon A Time In The West, but it started here, in this trilogy. Watch all three films, and especially this one, to see the proof that the terms `high art' and `fun' are not mutually exclusive. Now, get goin'!</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZLROGIL2V7GV.html">A2ZLROGIL2V7GV</a><br/><p>"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" is Sergio Leone's epic masterpiece.  While it is part of his Spaghetti Western Trilogy( all three films have different characters and plots), the film stands on its own and really shows you how good a movie can really be.  This movie has it all.  It has action, drama and even some comic relief in it.  It is a timeless classic that is unforgettable.  When I first saw it, I was a little kid and couldn't truly appreciate it as I can now at age 22.<br /><br />Blondie (The Man with No Name) isn't your typical good guy.  He mainly does things that suits his own agenda.  However, when compared to the murderous Angel Eyes and the greedy Tuco, Blondie is a saint.  This tale involves bloodshed, shoot-outs, search for treasure, and double-crossing.  And it all takes place while the Civil War is going on, which makes things a lot more "interesting" for the notorious three.  The West has never been wilder or more unpredictable than it is now.  With an incredible score, excellent acting, and superb story-telling, this is one memorable film that you will never forget.<br /><br />As I said in the beginning, the first time I saw this was when I was a little kid.  When I just recently purchased this new edition of the movie, it truly was like I was watching it for the first time.  Coming from a guy who isn't a big fan of Westerns (I don't mind them, but I don't watch too many of them), I absolutely LOVED this film.  In fact, I wanted to give it a standing ovation when it was all said and done due to how moved I was by it.  This really is filmmaking at its finest.  I wasn't terribly impressed with Leone's "Once Upon a Time in America," but he is absolutely flawless with this amazing and timeless Western.  It is slower than the second film ("For a Few Dollars More"), but I think that makes this all the better.  The build up of tension is much more present in this film, and you really get the sense that these characters are real people.  Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef and Eli Wallach are brilliant in their roles, and a lot of props need to go to Lee Van Cleef as he is absolutely chilling in his role.<br /><br />This new edition really does the film the justice it deserves.  The film has been restored to the director's original vision as much as possible, giving you an extra 18 minutes.  You will notice the added scenes as the voices have been re-dubbed (the first time you will notice this will throw you, as I think that specific part has the worst re-dubbing, but the other added scenes are done a lot better, even if you still notice it).  The picture looks incredible and the sound is great.  Extras included are commentary from Richard Schickel, a couple of documentaries and featurettes, poster gallery, deleted scenes and the original theatrical trailer.  Along with the nice packaging, you get an 8-page booklet that includes pictures from the film along with Roger Ebert's most recent review of the film.  And, you get some mini-posters included inside the packaging as well.  A superior edition of the movie, without question.<br /><br />"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" is a pure triumph in filmmaking and should be seen by everybody at least once.  Don't let the fact that this is a Western throw you.  I think this can be enjoyed by everybody, and even by those who are not big fans of Westerns.  A film filled with authentic emotion and action, this is one that shouldn't be missed by anyone.  I LOVE this movie, and I cannot express that enough. -Michael Crane</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJIJKKN15KR9.html">A1TJIJKKN15KR9</a><br/><p>The high point of the Spaghetti Western sub-genre, Sergio Leone's dubiously-titled masterpiece is a living, breathing encapsulation of everything that made its peers so notorious. Whether you're after atmosphere as thick as smoke, tight-lipped anti-heroes, charmingly bad audio dubs or a cast of thousands, this grand adventure delivers in excess. With a run time of just under three hours, it should go without saying that the narrative sprawls at times, yet expert cinematography, intriguingly era-authentic landscapes, a variety of fresh, varied locations and rich characterization keep the picture from stagnating even when it's been ten minutes since the last line of dialog. Naturally, Leone regulars Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef bring the goods as remotely feuding foils with a penchant for sharp, icy glares; though I preferred their dynamic in the preceding For a Few Dollars More, the two make for a stunning combination whenever they share the screen and it's a shame this marks the end of that brief partnership. It's a terrific picture if you've got the time to really pore over it, but works equally as well as simple background noise.</p></br><a href="../users/A331OF34UX4Y1K.html">A331OF34UX4Y1K</a><br/><p>Nothing much left to say about this one here. Its majestic, phenomenal, has stand the test of time. And, fortunately, digital transfer was satisfactory.</p></br><a href="../users/AY12DBB0U420B.html">AY12DBB0U420B</a><br/><p>Let's see. The good guys wear white hats. Right? The bad guys wear black. Well, it used to be that way. But here with "The Good, The Bad and The Ugly" separating the two becomes almost impossible since there's three and they all have temporary fleeting alliances in the greedy search for gold coinage at about the time of the civil war. Anything goes. It makes for an interesting story and fascinating character study, if you like your stories punctuated with a lot of assorted violence and gunfire. So be it. Director Sergio Leone does a masterful job of telling said tail in a stark dreary, wild-west environment. As with most Clint Eastwood movies, everyone gets beat to a pulp but manages to come back to deliver revenge and put bullet holes through an astonishing number of people. It's action packed and rather fun to watch. Rated R for violence, and it earned it.<br /><br />Gary Peterson</p></br><a href="../users/ADLVFFE4VBT8.html">ADLVFFE4VBT8</a><br/><p>THE MEANING OF SERGIO LEONE'S WORK<br /><br />Spaghetti Westerns were the first significant movies I watched as a little boy growing up in some East European backwater, back in the late sixties. And Sergio Leone was the Spaghetti king. What could be more subversive in a world aiming at total or totalitarian state-enforced collectivism than watching these rugged individualists, Italian-speaking 'cowboys' answering to American names, relentlessly and usually violently pursuing their own greedy goals while the world around was cracking and collapsing with a so-called 'civil' war raging? Add to that those wide shots of small men under immense, blue, cloudless dessert skies and Clint Eastwood's cigars and the effects of all those years of constant and persistent indoctrination were irreversibly blown away by 3 hours of movie viewing.<br /><br />It's hard to quantify the role Sergio Leone and Clint Eastwood played in the collapse of communism - after all, what followed isn't exactly the happy-go-lucky Wild West - but almost certainly we wouldn't have the Tarantino some of us love and the massive Stephen King's Dark Tower saga might not exist at all - and this is just scratching the surface. Maybe Sergio Leone is not the sole mother of all contemporary creative artistic expressions but he's clearly one of their more prominent godfathers.<br /><br />THE RESTORATION<br /><br />These being said, the restoration and actual reconstruction of his work was something that HAD to be done because we can't afford having these masterpieces degrade any further. What came out is certainly not 'perfect' but it's great work for sure and, as a digital product, it can't degrade any more.<br /><br />The restorers succeeded in giving us, Americans, what Europeans always had - the 'full' movie, not the butchered American version, 15 or 20 minutes shorter, made so to meet the business demands of theater operators. It was hard to find film of an acceptable quality for all the chapters and, at least in one instance, what was found was too damaged to be included in the film but, whenever possible, the lost content was added and the restorers even brought back Clint Eastwood and Eli Wallach to do their voices over the Italian-speaking cuts. The picture was cleaned up and the restorers even managed to turn the mono sound track into a 5.1 surround, adding a few sound effects when needed - yes, it's not 100% the original sound track but I'm not complaining.<br /><br />THE BLU EDITON<br /><br />This edition is the 2003 restored movie. As I noted above, it gets a DTS-HD 5.1 Master Audio sound track and it's 2 minutes shy of 3 hours long. For a 1966 movie done on the cheap back then - it cost only a little over $1 million to make it - the restoration quality is above expectations. Not everything is perfect. Sometimes we even get to see the proverbial 'hair' at the bottom of the screen and not a lot of time was invested in creating the 5.1 sound track but what we get is probably better than what I saw as a little boy in the movie theater.<br /><br />In addition, there is a serious complement of extras. There are two separate commentary soundtracks by Richard Schickel, an Eastwood biographer and by Christopher Frayling, a noted authority when it comes to Sergio Leone. Then, there's the "Leone's West" documentary, discussing the making of the movie, another featurette on Sergio Leone himself, a short on the actual Civil War events that the movie seems to refer to, a very informative short on the restoration process and two extras on Ennio Morricone, the composer responsible for the innovative sound track.<br /><br />Sadly, the packaging is not what I expected. The disk comes inside one of the cheapest Blu-ray case made so far - the kind that has holes in it to save one or two pennies worth of plastic but... I can live with that.<br /><br />OVERALL<br /><br />I am VERY happy with this restoration. I think it's the best we are going to get for many years to come so... enjoy it. I know that I am. It's 5 stars without hesitation.</p></br><a href="../users/ASJ54MITON1NO.html">ASJ54MITON1NO</a><br/><p>This was the best Leone film of the series, starring Clint Eastwood. Most noteable for the look of the film, using close-ups, cut to: master shots, on the wide screen format. It had a European quality to it, even though it was a Western, due to the fact that the director was Italian. In any case, the film although lengthy, is easy to watch, because the story carries the viewer along rather well. I bought a copy of the dvd at a grocery store for $9.99, but disc two, doesn't really interest me, with it's special features.

As they travel, sometimes alone and sometimes together, across a surreal landscape made anarchic by war, director Sergio Leone presents a world in which all of man's finer instincts and civilized institutions seem to have failed.  Our three protagonists keep faith in one thing only--the existence of treasure at the end of their quest--and they go to heroic lengths in service of that faith.  Leone's despairing vision is fascinating, and as an action movie, it is just downright terrific.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GD9BKIUT3I89.html">A3GD9BKIUT3I89</a><br/><p>Four decades after it's release the FULL version of Sergio Leone's epic THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY is finally being seen in North America.  Because the film was cut before it's U.S. release none of the footage was ever dubbed into English.

I'm not sure he was right, but he might have been right about Hollywood westerns.  The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is so good that it's title has become a part of the English language lexicon.  The movie is, in it's own way, a comedy but there are moments of stark realism and pathos.  The movie is not particularly logical or consistent but more than makes up for it with gritty characters and austere symbollism.<br /><br />I hate it when people summarize films and books.  Why should a reviewer want to give the story away to people who haven't seen it?  I will hit some high points, however.  The movie starts with a very dangerous scam.  Eli Wallach--Tuco, The Ugly--is wanted for a long list of crimes.  Eastwood turns him in and collects the reward money.  Tuco is convicted to hang.  Just as the door door is fixing to drop, Eastwood from some distance away, shoots the rope in two. Both Eastwood and Wallach ride off to rip-off another town.<br /><br />The Civil War is raging in New Mexico and Blondy finds a wagon loaded with dead Confederate soldiers and houseflies.  One man, dying, mentions Confederate gold buried...somewhere.  Tuco and Blondy, dressed as Confederate troopers, are captured by Yankees.  When in the prison camp they encounter Lee Van Cleef, the very, very Bad.  While soldiers sing sweetly outside, Van Cleef and his henchmen beat our boys for information about the gold.<br /><br />There is escape and treachery.  Eastwood drags Wallach through the desert heat on the end of a rope.  He releases him and Tuco, in a wonderful scene, barges in to a gun store, looking for the right weapon.  Not satisfied with any, he starts taking them apart and putting parts together again.  Satisfied with his new weapon, he terrorizes the shop keeper and steals the revolver.<br /><br />In another scene Wallach encounters his Catholic Priest brother who curses him for being an outlaw.  Wallach smacks him down and disgustedly tells him that after his brother went to the seminary, the family starved.  Banditry was the way he fed the family.<br /><br />In another scene, the comical Wallach is taking a bath in a Civil War battle under fire from Yankee field guns.  A man who hates Wallach for some previous wrong, sneaks in to shoot him.  Wallach shoots him, instead, because, as it turns out, Wallach always bathes with his revolver on his waist.<br /><br />Another fabulous scene involves a battle.  After the fighting is over and the soldiers have left, Eastwood finds a dying Southern soldier.  Without a word being spoken, they exchange a cigarette back and forth until the soldier dies...one small act of humanity.<br /><br />The last scene is truly amazing...even spectacular.  The Good, the Bad and the Ugly face off in a three way duel in a cemetary.  Nobody knows who to shoot at first.  The camera pans up and you can see that the cemetary is an ampitheatre with the dead as the silent spectators.  Dead people viewing an act of death.

Most people know the storyline of three violent men and their pursuit of $200,000 in Confederate gold coins buried in a cemetery. Allowing nothing to slow them down, the trio cuts a violent path to the gold. For the extended version DVD, 14 minutes of footage has been added to the movie that were never part of the American release. Clint Eastwood and Eli Wallach re-recorded the dialogue in these scenes because an English audio track was never created. It is almost forty years since the movie was made and Eastwood and Wallach have aged which is noticeable in their voices, but that doesn't detract from the overall viewing pleasure of the movie. My only problem with the DVD is the gunshots. Spaghetti westerns had a distinctive noise when guns were fired. Here on this DVD the gunshots have been changed to a more Americanized gunshot. Minor squabble, but I had to get it off my chest. Even with this minor problem this is an incredible DVD that fans of the movie need to have in their collection.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood is excellent as Blondie, "the Good," a bounty hunter who by accident discovers the name of the grave where the gold coins are buried. Lee Van Cleef is equally as good as the steely-eyed Angel Eyes, "the Bad," a vicious gunfighter who will stop at nothing to get his hands on the gold. Eli Wallach steals the movie as Tuco, "the Ugly," the Mexican bandit who knows the name of the cemetery, but not the name on the grave. The trio are great throughout, providing plenty of great shootouts, but also some great dialogue. The movie also stars Luigi Pistilli as Father Ramirez, Tuco's brother, Mario Brega as Corporal Wallace, Aldo Guiffre as an alcoholic Union captain, Aldo Sambrell, Benito Stefanelli, and Al Mulock.<br /><br />The Extended Version Collector's Set is full of extras viewers will eat up. The DVD features the widescreen presentation of the movie with 14 additional minutes of footage, audio commentary from film critic Richard Schickel, "Leone's West" a making of documentary with cast(Eastwood and Wallach) and crew interviews, "The Leone Style" a featurette about director Sergio Leone's unique style, "The Man Who Lost the Civil War" a documentary about the actual happenings of the Civil War that take place in the movie, "Reconstructing the GBU" on how the audio recording was done, and "Il Maestro" a feature about composer Ennio Morricone and his famous score. The DVD also has two deleted scenes that weren't able to be inserted into the movie, a French trailer with other missing footage, a US trailer that identifies Tuco as the Bad and Angel Eyes as the Ugly, several collectible mini-posters from around the world, and a collectible booklet with an essay by Roger Ebert. If you have the original DVD, I recommend you keep it just to have the original US release, but buy this DVD as well. This Extended Version DVD is truly one of the few movies you can say is a must have DVD. Buy this movie!</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>This is the film that laid the groundwork for director Sergio Leone's masterpiece, "Once Upon a Time in the West".  Leone was a genius in the sense that he did not so much evoke the West but he reimagined it with a European's sensibility.  In doing so he placed himself on the same pedestal as his idols John Ford and Howard Hawks.  His storytelling here is great.  The acting, with the possible exception of star Clint Eastwood, who legend has it was growing tired of "spaghetti westerns" and wanted to return Stateside, is stellar.  Lee Van Cleef is memorably cold-hearted and evil as Angel-Eyes.  The real star is Eli Wallach as Tucco.  Though the film designates him as "the Ugly", Tucco is the character we can most relate to.  Yes, he's done many bad things.  There are two scenes here that elicit empathy for Tucco.  One, where Tucco attempts to embrace his brother, a priest, and is subsequently rebuffed.  The other, where he is frantically racing through the endless cemetery for the buried gold.  It does not so much elicit sympathy for him, but you can feel the pathos.  Recently, a commercial TV station was showing "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly" in a two hour time slot.  They cut the cemetery scene out completely.  That's like showing "Citizen Kane" without revealing what Rosebud is.  Needless to say, Ennio Morricone delivers another classic score here.  I didn't find critic Richard Schickel's commentary on the DVD as being very informative;more like tedious.  The deleted scenes didn't add much to the film's narrative.  Nor were the documentaries much to write home about.  The theatre cards included in the package were pretty cool though.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>I wasn't a big fan of Leone's &quot;Once Upon a Time in the West,&quot; so I took a gamble and bought this new extended cut of &quot;GB&amp;U&quot; for a low price. I am truly glad I did! I saw this film once before about 8 years ago and I didn't remember it being that great. I can now say that this is not only my favorite Leone western, but my favorite western period. The acting of the three leads, the music (of course), and the storyline are some of the best ever in this genre of movies. The Dvd is loaded with interesting features, with Clint Eastwood and Eli (the ugly) talking about the fun times and near death experiences when making this classic film. This movie is a real testament to the west and the seal of greatness that will forever live on with the name Sergio Leone.</p></br><a href="../users/AFMUUJT7J32LN.html">AFMUUJT7J32LN</a><br/><p>WOW. I have watched it so many times its embarassing. Its good and ugly and bad.

As in some of the best Spaghetti Western movies, in "The Good, The Bad And The Ugly" there are no heroes, only antiheroes at best, all the characters are capable of anything in order to remain alive.<p>Ennio Morricone's score is another character in this epic set in a Western, the main theme is one of the most well-known songs in the world of the music from the movies. The photography is flawless, as well as Sergio Leone's direction. The characters are so fascinating that the audiences are interested in them from beginning to end.<p>"The Good, The Bad And The Ugly" is one of the two best westerns, both this movie and "Once Upon A Time In The West" are essential videos, both films made by Sergio Leone.</p></br><a href="../users/A3A48XEYWLWH7T.html">A3A48XEYWLWH7T</a><br/><p>And there it is, the three hour magnum opus and finale of the Leone / Eastwood trilogy.  Spaghetti Westerns reach their zenith in this grand epic that tracks the inter-weaving adventures of three very different, but similarly driven gunfighters in the waning days of the civil war.  The seemingly convoluted plot has Clint, Lee, and Eli racing towards a quarter million dollars in gold.  Each man holds a piece of the puzzle and needs the other to complete it.  Beautifully filmed and paced, all the sand, grit, blood and sweat combine with that haunting musical score to hold the viewer breathless.  The character studies are equally interesting, the more time we spend with the principals the less we ultimately know about them.  Brutal commentaries on the absurdities of war are as timely now as presumably they were back then, especially the bridge scenes.  Through it all, Clint rises above as the omni-powerful Blondie, always a step ahead and almost paternalistic in his treatment of Tuco.  Lee Van Cleef oozes black bile as Angel Eyes, and ranks up there in Western if not all film villainy.  It is a tiring movie to watch, the journey seems to take so long but you realize with each scene that you're seeing great directing, acting and period pieces.  It looks beautiful on widescreen TVs, definitely recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ODBHT4URXVXQ.html">A2ODBHT4URXVXQ</a><br/><p>Okay, who holds the record for having seen this movie the most times?? I've seen it maybe 5 times, and I know I'm not even in the running. My 18yo kid says he's seen it about 10 times (and he says he wants Blondie's cigar). My father, who is 89, has seen it maybe 20 times (by his admittedly vague recollection).<br />Any movie that can span the affections of 3 generations deserves 5-star rating.<br />Why can't all Westerns be like this, made up of bad guys, badder buys, and the really bad, bad guys? Angel Eyes is the personification of suave evil, like a beautiful deadly snake; Blondie represents honor among thieves. But oh, every time Tuco comes on the scene, he steals the show. Who will ever forget his wavering alliances, his race through the cemetery, his face at the stagecoach when he realizes Blondie holds the missing piece of information: the name on the grave where the gold is buried, his whimpering at the end as he balanced on a crumbling cemetery cross with a noose around his neck? And the music! Doo-y-ooo-y-oooooo....Wah WAH Wah... Spectacular. 10 stars, please.<br />Now I'm going to go watch it again, and try to catch up with my dad.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TMAVN4CEM8U8.html">A1TMAVN4CEM8U8</a><br/><p>The Good, the Bad and the Ugly  DVD<br /><br />The Good, the Bad and the Ugly  is the finale of Sergio Leone's trilogy about the "Man with No Name", Clint Eastwood's most famous role outside of Dirty Harry.

One can't help but wonder how that happened, considering how unusual and seemingly uncommerical it is. It is a film about style and mood, which means it is not a strictly staged and constructed production designed to funnel us through all the plot points and mandatory gunfights with a maximum of speed and a minimum of effort from either the producers or the viewers. It has a central plot, for sure, but nothing to demand the 3 hour running time. Not even half of that really. Instead of letting the plot create and then rule the world, Leone created a world and allowed the plot to creep its way through it.  This is something which is disappointingly rare in film, and Leone has made a film which is exceptionally good at performing this rare trick. This style can be a good or a bad thing, depending on who you are, but it's usually a good thing for me, and this film is pretty damn great film, no two ways about it.<p>The basic plot synopsis goes that the 3 titular characters are searching for a hidden treasure of Civil War gold, and though they don't trust or like each other, they need to work together to some degree because no one of them has all the information necessary to find the gold. That however, doesn't tell you a fifth of what actually occurs during the film, and nothing that really matters as far as watching or enjoying the film is concerned.  This is a genuinely epic tale, which is set in a dark, filthy and corrupt world.  This provides a strong contradiction, as there is no epic hero, and no fantastic setting, but instead we have a trio of outlaws, and the backdrop is a long, highly destructive war.(which the characters are not concerned with.) Thus the characters tranverse many miles and do many unlikely deeds, but they do not change the world, and do not care to.  And although they are all outlaws and killers, the sort of destruction they reap pales in comparison to what is occuring around them.  So as this and the other westerns of the era de-mythologized the old west, this film de-mythologizes the rest of the world as well, reminding us that violence, death and corruption were hardly unique to the old west.  Yet this is not all the film is about, and it isn't as dark and cynical as that may make it sound. It still has humor, still has excitement and intrigue and countless other things.(much like the real world) Wisely, no one theme or motif is allowed to dominate for too long. The tone shifts from the comedic to the hyper-dramatic to everything in between at various points in the film, and Leone does them all with ease.  <p>Contrary to my expectations it's Wallach's Tuco Ramirez that dominates the film, not Eastwood's Blondy.  Tuco stands in strong contrast to the other 2 leads, as he is a nervous, tittering character who is often played for laughs yet is still violent and deadly and occasionaly truly brutish and sadistic.  Lee Van Cleef is great as Angel Eyes. He manages to portray an utterly heartless and irredeemible character without turning him into a ridiculous caricature.  These two characters illustrate what makes this film so good.  They stand very close to the edge, nearly becoming overblown and ridiculous, but never going so far as to actually become so.  In many ways Eastwood's Blondy is the least interesting of these 3 characters, but is largely redeemed by the fact that he is, well, cool.  His cool demeanor and sardonic dialogue stand in opposition to the more extreme, polarized characters, and he thus provides a sort of base for the highly-dramatic and stylized film.<p>Good characters aside, the real strength of this film is in the visual and audio presenation. Cinematography and sets are fantastic.  Not so gritty as to be unpleasant to look at but not overdone and overly picturesque either.  Lots of great wide angle shots, particularly during the bridge scenes.  Morricone's famed score is great too. The main theme is overused a bit, but the rest of it is strong, particularly the brilliant Ectasy of Gold and The Trio in the closing scene of the film.  The gunfights are just great.  On one level, they are a sort of anti-action scene, as they are all build-up with little action.  The final shootout in the graveyard naturally stands out, and is one of the great scenes in all film.  It is a clinic in the Leone style, contrasting the beautifully conceived long shots with countless close-ups  of the 3 characters doing essentially nothing. 5 minutes pass between when the last word of dialogue is spoken and the first round is fired in what proves to be a very brief exchange, yet it does not disappoint.  The blaring score and the frantic editing just before the first blast are the true climax, and it is as effective as one could hope.  It is, as many have pointed out, dramatized and extended far more than is reasonable, but it holds up emotionally and visually and thus works beautifully.  The early scene between Angel Eyes and his first target is similarly effecting, and is another standout.  It's got darker more horrific scenes as well, such as Tuco's torturing of Blondy and his later torture at the hands of Wallace.  And many of the scenes with the armies have great sorrow and desolation. In fact, it pretty much all works, so while not every scene may be utterly necessary to move the plot along, they all manage to entertain in varying ways.  Most movies have difficulty entertaining on one level, so this is quite an accomplishment.<p>This is a fine DVD. It looks great, even the restored scenes.  Too bad they don't have old dialogue for them, and you'll definitely notice the new dubbing, but this should only be a mild annoyance at worst.  The extras seem pretty interesting, though I haven't watched them all.  All in all, a good version of a classic. Get it.</p></br><a href="../users/A192KEPM0HW6AC.html">A192KEPM0HW6AC</a><br/><p>&quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot; is Sergio Leone's magnum opus. An audacious undertaking, it would have flopped miserably in any other director's hands. Only someone so commited to his artistic vision as Leone could have pulled off this bombastic pageantry of human nature in all its facets, its capacity for cynicism, greed, bloodlust, revenge, heroism, redemption and honour.<p>This movie must be *experienced.* Put the DVD in, turn the stereo all the way up and let it pummel you from the moment the Lardani titles blast onto the screen in a blaze of Technicolor fury. The montage of colour, interspersed by stark black and white visages of Eastwood, Van Cleef and Wallach is a tough act to follow, like Saul Bass' mesmerising titles for Hitchcock's &quot;Vertigo.&quot;<p>The wait is now over! Last year, MGM/UA issued a restored 35mm print, which showed at the Film Forum in Manhattan. First restored in Italian by Cineteca Nazionale, the English-language restoration was spearheaded by Martin Scorsese, whose efforts with the Film Preservation Foundation have helped fund preservation of America's celluloid heritage. Both Eli Wallach and Clint Eastwood returned to the sound studio to dub new dialogue for approximately 20 minutes of restored footage. Both sound a little older and scratchier, but these added scenes help to explain both Tuco's and Angel Eyes' gangs and some plot points that were previously unclear. However, they both sound great! (Van Cleef's voice was dubbed by a professional voiceover artist, and sounds almost on target). The movie now has the true feel of a sprawling epic, one that's earned its right to take its time.<p>This special edition DVD features the movie restored to its original length in the Italian version, and comes jam packed with interviews with Eastwood, Wallach, producer Alberto Grimaldi and -- most importantly -- Mickey Knox, who wrote the English language dialogue. Knox crafted lines that lived up to the larger than life screenplay. You'd swear the original was in English, the dialogue is so perfectly tailored!<p>But the vision is singularly Leone's. It starts slowly, as  a band of bounty killers home in on their prey, small-time bandit Tuco Ramirez (THE UGLY, played by the venerable Eli Wallach). They pile through a saloon door, then the camera imediately pans away laterally. Suddenly, his body hurtling through the front window in a rain of glass, Tuco bursts onto the street -- in what has to be the most absurd grand entrance in screen history -- revolver in one hand, a chicken leg in the other. It's total chutzpah on Leone's and Wallach's part.<p>If you think *that* can't be topped, watch Wallach's entire performance. Animated is putting it mildly. More than a performance, Wallach is a one-man band, nay, Army. Never has such a selfish, petty, ratty and shifty little man been played so larger than life. Wallach smirks, scurries, grimaces, chuckles, shouts, bellows and slyly oils his way across the screen in what has got to be the hammiest performance ever by a method actor. Or *any* actor: He makes Orson Welles, Burt Lancaster and Charles Laughton look like the grey and sullen cast of Woody Allen's &quot;Interiors,&quot; he's so alive with passion that he literally sweats his performance out through the filthy pores on his stubble-ridden face. And he's wonderful!<p>If that's a tough act to follow, you haven't met the bad. They don't come any badder than Angel Eyes, Lee Van Cleef's hired killer who's got ice water running through his veins. Van Cleef is ruthless, bold and heartless. Riding out of nowhere onto a doomed man's rancho, Angel Eyes pays a visit, carrying out a murder for hire. The price: $500. But the victim offers him $1000 to look the other way. No dice: Angel Eyes isn't in it for the money. Rather, he's a man who loves his work, and always sees the job through. So, the poor sod dies anyway.<p>Clint Eastwood is as cool as a cucumber as The Man With No Name (but really one with sort of a name, in this case &quot;Blondie,&quot; which is Wallach's moniker for him). It's fun watching the ongoing relationship between Blondie and Tuco as bounty hunter and prey. In another life, they would have been great pals, but in this life (&quot;we're all alone in this world,&quot; Tuco confesses to Blondie, half seriously, half cynically) their love of money is thicker than friendship. So, they invent ingenious and cruel ways to exact revenge of each other.<p>It's during one of Tuco's sadistic plots - in which he marches the pale-skinned Eastwood across 100 miles of scorching desert - that the plot finally comes to a head: A driverless stagecoach full of wounded Confederates happens across their path, and through a twist of fate, Tuco and Blondie each have two halves of a secret which, if put together, will make them a quarter of a million dollars richer. But, without each other the two halves are worthless. Thus does Tuco do a 180 from brutal executioner to Blondie's would-be saviour. Now that he could be rich, he suddenly realizes how valuable their friendship is.<p>It's not before long that they wind up with Angel Eyes, as they're captured by Union soldiers. At the prisoner of war camp, a deadly game of cat and mouse begins. Van Cleef is now more restrained and less thuggish as he deals with Tuco to extract the secret; his henchman Wallace (Mario Brega, a Leone stalwart), pummels it out of Tuco.<p>In epic fashion, after a shootout in a deserted town and a bridge demolition that explodes across the screen, Tuco, Blondie and Angel Eyes make their way to the cemetery where the treasure is buried. In a fanfare of brass, percussion and chorus, the three face each other down in the cemetery plaza. It's a gorgeous and cathartic set piece. Credit must go not only to composer Ennio Morricone but also to musical director Bruno Nicolai, who conducts the score con fuoco.</p></br><a href="../users/A29QA79VLQGHY6.html">A29QA79VLQGHY6</a><br/><p>Sergio Leone proudly served up his finest spaghetti Western to a Roman audience in the final days of 1966. The premiere print of &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot; sprawled over three hours in telling its tale of three desperados in search of gold amid the chaos of the Civil War.<p>The men from United Artists also were on the trail of treasure. American audiences, they knew, would not sit for a 178-minute Western, especially not an import starring a TV actor (Clint Eastwood).<p>Out came 17 minutes, and so was breach-born the version of &quot;Good, Bad, Ugly&quot; that has endured as a male-bonding touchstone for four decades. Looking to make things right (and to mine more gold), MGM a few years ago decided to re-create the storied film that unspooled in Rome that night. The restored, full-length English version of Leone's epic is worth every  dollar in this two-disc DVD Collector's Set.<p>Sure, Leone's film loses much on the small screen -- its borderline-surrealistic vistas shot in Spain are legendary -- but the DVD's visuals are clean, with decent contrasts (anamorphic widescreen, 2.35:1). Compared to MGM's 1998 release, there's a dramatic reduction in flatness, speckling and miscellaneous wear. The 5.1 Dolby Digital audio has its moments but isn't up to the standards of the imagery.<p>The DVD medium is, of course, unrivaled at presenting the history of complicated productions like these. MGM's set gets that job done, for the most part. Eastwood biographer Richard Schickel does the heavy lifting in a commentary that, amazingly, runs on fumes only near the end of three hours. The 2002 restoration project is covered in an 11-minute docu that goes over the added/restored scenes. They mostly just smooth out the narrative, but it's hard to reimagine the film without them.<p>&quot;Good, Bad, Ugly&quot; is as closely associated with composer Ennio Morricone as with Leone. Film music historian Jon Burlingame talks about the maestro in a short featurette and in a more-detailed audio lecture. No explanation is given for Morricone's lack of participation on the DVD, and you get the feeling he's been downplayed for not playing along.</p></br><a href="../users/AIIR8E34EDKCQ.html">AIIR8E34EDKCQ</a><br/><p>Sometimes there's nothing better than a solid classic western on a warm Saturday afternoon. I have heard all the praises of this movie but after watching it I think my opinion of this paramount achievement rose way above my expectations.<br /><br />Great reason for watching this movie other than the simple fact how fabulous it is the quite modern story with twists and turns as things happed in the Wild Wild West . I was entertained for the whole time with no slow moments and the never ending looming spiraling staircase of misfortune and quirky scenarios that kept happening to Blondie, as they called Eastwood and Tuco, his partner in crime. Without spoiling too much all I can say is that they both know a part of a secret, of a buried treasure; two hundred thousand dollars and each one of them knows on part of the location as they realize they need to join forces and overcome their differences in order to find it. Hot on their tail is the bad guy, known as Angel Eyes who has no soul and will kill anyone who gets in his way and who is also after the treasure.<br /><br />Eastwood is a great bad ass tough character, with that cold intelligent stare and his favorite cigar hanging in the corner of his mouth, and when he is squaring off with an opponent you just know who is quicker and who will win.<br /><br />Sergio Leone proves as a superb director with  flawless movie technique with short funny smart moments, fancy tricks, quick escapes and our main characters stepping on each others toes, turning against one another, trying to kill each other off until they reach their goal; the buried treasure. This movie might be almost 40 years old but its still 100% pure and solid entertainment, whether you like westerns or not, this is simply good fun. This saga of sun and gun stories involving clever characters are bound to be around for as long as movies are watched, and I promise that after watching this movie no one can feel anything other then a sense of great self worth and time well spent.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZSC81MXLBELX.html">A2ZSC81MXLBELX</a><br/><p>There's $200,000 in gold buried in a secret place.The Man with No Name, or "Blondie" as he is so affectionaly called in this one(Eastwood), "Tuco"(Eli Wallach) and "Angel Eyes"(Lee Van Cleef)are all intent they they will be the one to walk away with it.Not even a little thing like the Civil War will keep them from their quest!<br /><br />This is the third and final film of the "Fistful of Dollars" trilogy. It reunites Eastwood, Van Cleef(as a different character in this one), Director Sergio Leone and Ennio Morricone with another great "Spaghetti" Western and marvelous score to go with it.In this one there is also the addition of Eli Wallach who steals the show as  "The Ugly".<br /><br />"Blondie" and "Tuco" are already partners of sorts. They have a scheme going where the "Wanted" Tuco, who has a price on his head that is ever growing, is captured and brought in to hang. Blondie, always at the last second and with his sure shot, shoots the hangman's noose, the two escape and split the rewards.When these two part ways(and are done torturing each other)they each discover the other has a piece of the puzzle needed to find the gold!They must reunite to chase their prize.But Uh-oh... there is a third though who is also real interested in this gold. It is the very "Bad" "Angel Eyes". He discovers their secret, and will use any means neccessary to retrieve the information and secure the loot for himself.So the three form a sort of unholy alliance, make their way through scorching deserts, Civil War battles, and betrayals to get this buried treasure. Who will be the last man standing? Who will get rich? Well You Know.......<br /><br />It's a wonderfully filmed western that has everthing needed to keep you invovled. The camera shots and angles are incredible,Morricone has once again added a score that is a part of the story itself. There is lots of action, some terrific explosions,humor, and a great script.Eastwood, Van Cleef and Wallach will draw you in to their characters and keep you there until the final frame! It's a Western lover's Western! Oh and you will find the answer to the question I left my review of "For a Few Dollars More" with,  "Where did Clint get that wonderful pancho?"(This film is actually a prequel)<br /><br />Five stars to the film. It's fabulous. I can't go with that for the entire package though. The DVD(MGM) looks great. The picture is the best I've ever seen it. It is sharp and clear.The "Technicolor"looks good. It is presented in the original theatrical widescreen. You can see all the action in all the edges. I was a bit dissapointed with the sound though.Although, not bad in the Dolby Digital, it did not seem like an improvement on the Vhs. It seemed low and the dubbing was off quite a bit. It just doesn't seem to come up to par with other films (on DVD) of this age in that department. That's my only reason for 4 stars instead of 5.(Sometimes I wish we could add a Half a star)There is some excellent extra footage in the special features sections. It is of deleted scenes that are still in Italian only. I enjoyed viewing those. There are also some production notes, you can view it in French or Spanish and there are also subtitiles if needed.<br /><br />Even with the little problem of the sound, I still love this DVD and hope someday an even better one will come along.If you're a big fan of this trilogy, Eastwood, Leone,or a good western, it's a must have in any form DVD or VHS!<br /><br />Eastwood fans, you can find this trilogy in a set along with many other Eastwood films packaged together - for action/adventure/thriller check out:<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000094J9Q">The Gauntlet/True Crime</a><br /><br />Eli Wallach fans - don't forget:<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000059TFW">The Magnificent Seven (Special Edition)</a>(see my review for film and dvd details<br /><br />So Saddle up with Blondie..he's sooo "GOOD!" and enjoy..Laurie<br /><br />also recommended:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0790731959">Absolute Power</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000JGOG">True Crime</a></p></br><a href="../users/A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK.html">A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK</a><br/><p>I was fortunate enough to see this movie the first time in 1968, in a drive-in theater.  It seemed to me to be an epic, complex western, and perhaps the best movie I had ever seen in my life at that time.  This movie is epic, it is complex, and is certainly one of the best westerns ever made.<br /><br />Sergio Leone made this movie at a time when Italian movie-makers were known for their intensely artistic visions.  Sergio keeps his movie sufficiently within the mainstream so that the movie is very accessible, yet there are numerous artistic elements, including symbolism and film angles that were intended to be artistic, and turned out to be incredibly evocative and beautiful cinematography.<br /><br />Before proceeding with this review, I should mention the wonderful soundtrack by Ennio Morricone.  The music enhances each situation beautifully, and is one of the best soundtracks for a western of all time.  The signature song with the predominant drum and vocal is unforgettable, and perfectly formed to each scene in which it is used.<br /><br />The story takes place during the Civil War.  Clint Eastwood is essentially a con artist, turning in Eli Wallach for a reward, and then saving him by shooting the hangman's rope at just the right moment.  Clint and Eli have a falling out and the two separate.  Clint finds a new partner and is in the process of saving him when Eli runs into him.  Eli wants a little revenge on Clint, and is torturing him by walking him through the desert when they stumble on a wagon full of dead Confederate soldiers; except one is still alive.  The dying soldier tells Clint where $200,000 in gold is buried and then dies.  Suddenly Eli has to keep Clint alive.  The search for the gold is the true story to this movie, though it takes a significant portion of the movie to discover this plot.  The beginning of the movie to the start of the search for the gold is used to introduce each of the main characters and to establish their personality.<br /><br />This movie is full of highly detailed and complex scenes, each of which is a mini-story in its own right.  Perhaps the most memorable portions of the movie occur near the end.  In one scene, Confederate and Union soldiers are dying endlessly and pointlessly over a bridge that neither side can seem to capture.  The Union captain would love to see the bridge destroyed to stop the endless and pointless killing, but he is under orders to take the bridge intact.  Given the violence of this movie, it is ironic that this entire scene is about the futility of war.<br /><br />In a subsequent scene, Clint Eastwood finds a dying Confederate soldier and comforts him, covering him to keep him warm and sharing a cigarette.  Clint looks away to see Eli Wallach riding off on a horse, and the soldier dies.  The scene visually illustrates how fleeting life is.<br /><br />The final scene is classic western combined with Sergio Leone's masterful artistic touch.  The three principal characters meet in a graveyard where the gold is supposedly buried.  The confusion of Tuco (Eli Wallach) as he searches for the grave is illustrated visually.  The background music is eliminated in favor of natural outdoor noise for portions of this scene as the three principal characters participate in a dramatic three-way gunfight.<br /><br />Even with this scene, Sergio Leone was not quite done.  He had an afterward that reflects on how the movie began.  The ending is Sergio's impression of the classic American western, with a man riding off into the hills and theme music accompanying him, with soaring camera angles to illustrate the western ideal of independence and self-reliance and the American theme of individualism.<br /><br />You need not understand the artistic elements of this movie to be able to appreciate it.  You will sense the elements are there, if only subconsciously, and you will realize that this is a wonderful and great movie.  This movie is one you will want to see again and again, especially if you are a fan of westerns or epic movies.  Well worth buying and worthy of a 5 star rating.<br /><br />Note that several versions of this movie exist.  You should review the versions available and purchase the one that meets your needs best.</p></br><a href="../users/A2H22I2RWE0HOV.html">A2H22I2RWE0HOV</a><br/><p>Out of all the spaghetti westerns ever made, Sergio Leone made his Man With No Name trilogy rock when spaghetti westerns had never rocked before.  This is hands down one of the coolest westerns ever made and one of the coolest Clint Eastwood flicks!  Gut-wrenching camera work and killer music, this is the movie you want when you need to see a good western.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EAI4948TW53X.html">A2EAI4948TW53X</a><br/><p>The entire trilogy was awesome, but the final of the series is the best.  Clint Eastwood returns as &quot;the man with no name&quot;.  Throw in Eli Wallach as &quot;Tuco&quot; and Lee Van Cleef as &quot; Angel eyes&quot; and you have one hell of a matchup.  The story is a little slow moving at first, but you get hooked.  It somewhat follows the previous movies.  But the character interaction is the best of the three.  The shootouts and unintentional humor make this a classic and must see for fans of the western movie genre.  You can't go wrong with this masterpiece!</p></br><a href="../users/A1S3C5OFU508P3.html">A1S3C5OFU508P3</a><br/><p>It took approximately 45 minutes of viewing before I began to get the general idea what the plot of this movie was. Three gunslingers with varying levels of viciousness are making their way through life in the United States during the time of the Civil War. Clint Eastwood plays the man with no name and fills the position of the good, although that is a relative term. In the opening, Eastwood is partnered with the Tuco character played by Eli Wallach. Tuco has a large price on his head and their scam is for Eastwood to turn Tuco in, collect the reward and then when he is being hanged, shoot the rope and then the hats off of the leading citizens. Tuco has few redeeming qualities; he will not hesitate to turn on anyone if it suits his purposes.<br /> Lee Van Cleef plays Angel Eyes, another ruthless killer with no scruples. Angel Eyes is searching for a man that has buried $200,000 in Confederate gold in a cemetery, but the "team" of Tuco and Eastwood encounter him first. As he is dying, the man tells Tuco the cemetery where the gold is buried but tells Eastwood the name on the grave. Therefore, both men need each other so they form an unstable partnership as they move through territory where the Union and Confederate forces are battling. As the team of Tuco and Eastwood pursue their goal, the ruthless Angel Eyes pursues them.<br /> This was a big budget picture and for the time, broke the mold of what was considered the standard western plot, with good guys going up against bad guys. In this case, the guy closest to good is still a ruthless killer with a lust for gold. It lags at times and has many logical holes, for example Eastwood and Tuco are able to move through combat zones without being challenged by the forces of either side. It was a time of spies and other espionage, so that seemed odd. The scene in the cemetery where the camera is spinning goes on way too long and can easily make you dizzy.<br /> The best characteristic of the movie is the acting of Eastwood, Wallach and Van Cleef. They are all humorless and impart more communication with their facial expressions and body language than many actors do with several sentences. My favorite was Wallach; despite his many faults it was easy to have some identification with the Tuco character.</p></br><a href="../users/A3TNM3C9ENUCFW.html">A3TNM3C9ENUCFW</a><br/><p>If you haven't seen this movie, it represents one (if not THE) best of Sergio Leones &quot;Spaghetti&quot; westerns. At a hair under 3 hours, this is also up there with the likes of Once Upon a Time in the West (also by Leone) but moves with considerably more flow, and I think is a better script, story and movie overall. Clint plays the &quot;Man with no name&quot; a drifting, quick drawing hombre with a mean streak a mile wide, and tenacity to match and is the &quot;Good&quot; as referred to in the title. The story centers around gold buried in a cemetary, and is something of a multi subplotted journey to find it. Supported ably by Lee Van Cleef, and excellently by Eli Wallach as the unkempt and greedy &quot;Ugly&quot; part of the trio, this is a classic western in all senses. Sweeping vista's, bar room brawls, gunfights, hangings, and even a brief stop off in a War on the way. But the movie never plods, and any stale moments are usually livened up with some of Eli Wallachs comic relief (albeit playing straight). With a host of goodies on this collectable release including 4 documentaries, trailers, music and the newly renovated extended version in anamorphic widescreen, this is certainly worth owning. The transfer isn't bad, but please remember these movies were made nearly 30 years ago, and then on something of a budget. Often filmed in Europe, and South America, and sometimes dubbed over with local foreign extra's they have stood the test of time well, and look pretty fine on DVD - but there not perfect by a long way, Most will probably be forgiving however on content alone. 4 stars, but not quite 5 - Enjoy</p></br><a href="../users/A3O2RCKAMSE9X7.html">A3O2RCKAMSE9X7</a><br/><p>Before Clint Eastwood and Sergio Leone began to collaborate in the mid 1960s with A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS and FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE, the western epic had been pretty much running true to form for more than fifty years.  The lone cowboy rides into town to chase out the outlaws and saves the populace.  These movies, usually starring John Wayne and his clones, were fixedly predictable in their portrayal of the laconic hero.  Except for Gabby Hays, humor and style were too often lacking.  In the first two of Leone's homage to the sprawling western, he tried to break out of this tried and true mold.  Eastwood star charisma allowed Leone to fashion a new prototype, but it was not until Leone added Lee Van Cleef and Eli Wallach to the mix that he found exactly the right note of violence, humor, music, and camera angles, all of which still mesh as perfectly today as they did back in 1967.  <p>The plot has been borrowed from dozens of oaters.  A trio of gunslingers seeks to recover a hidden cache of gold with only one emerging triumphant.  What sets TGATBATU apart from its predecessors is a sense that despite the crushing reality of the harsh Civil War days, there is a leavening humor that keeps it from being squashed flat by the violence of both sight and sound that assault the senses in nearly every other scene.  Eastwood plays straight man to Wallach's Lou Costello, feeding him lines that are truly funny.  Their continuous interaction that bounces back and forth from mutual self interest to several aborted instances of near murder keep the emotional focus of the film on track. Eastwood's face is frozen into a featureless frown, while Wallach's radiates a goofy grin even as both dispatch legions of inept cowboys with gunshots that reverberate as loudly as thunder blasts.  Lee Van Cleef is the 'Bad' one of the title, and he is bad indeed.  Eastwood kills to stay alive while Wallach does so with a flair that Jack Nicholson would later emulate in THE SHINING.  But Van Cleef manages to infuse his killing with a viciousness that well suggests his rat-faced persona.  <p>During the course of the movie, all three work variously, singly, in twos, and in threes, but the thrust of their interaction leads inexorably to the triangular showdown that in its blending of sight, sound, and action, has never been equalled.  This is a long movie, as any epic should be, but it never drags.  From the opening scene where Van Cleef blasts a family apart to the closing delicate balancing act of Wallach on a grave cross, the audience is carried along and finds itself teetering with Wallach in sympathetic rhythm.  The fact that the audience can overlook the obvious Italian flavor of cast and crew is a memorial to the seamless melding that Sergio Leone has established as the pinnacle of the western epic.</p></br><a href="../users/A2S166WSCFIFP5.html">A2S166WSCFIFP5</a><br/><p>The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly is Sergio Leone's classic spaghetti western. This is the one everyone remembers. It's shot in Spain, where the terrain looks similar to the American west, but gives it its special feel. The cinematography is a beautiful job. Ennio Morricone's score takes on the aspects of another character in the film, and it has become synonymous with the american west. this is an all time classic. great film, i love the fact that there is no dialogue for the first 10 minutes of the film. really shows what movies are meant to be. the dvd also contains about 15 minutes of footage deleted from the u.s. version (it's in italian). <p>this is just one of those movies everyone loves and everyone should own.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R9GZ8FC44MF5.html">A1R9GZ8FC44MF5</a><br/><p>This film feels like Tarantino, its not however, its Leone who you can tell inspired Tarantino.  Hell Tarantino even used one of the songs from this movie in Kill Bill Vol 2.  This movie has a little bit of action, a little bit of drama, a little bit of comedy, and a whole lot of style.  The only real flaw is the sound editing when people talk, sometimes it feels like one of those sucky Bruce Lee "films" where you hear different things then how their mouths are movin, this happens sometimes, not the whole time, but enough to make it kind of irritating, its a small flaw but after 3 hours it gets to ya.  There is one other thing that really isnt a flaw but is somewhat annoying, the pace, sometimes it takes the characters 3 minutes to walk acroos the room, or 5 minutes to start talking, i know its suppose to build tension or suspense, but once you get 2 minutes of a guy standing there not doing anything i think we get the point, another small thing.  Apart from that the movies is brilliant, the music is freakin awesome definetly inspired Tarantino, the characters names ( good, bad, ugly) more style and original, there is some cool western action and a civil war scene where they blow up a bridge (thats very cool), and theres lots of funny things that just supply more entertainment.  I give the movie a 9 out of a 10, those 2 things make the overall feel suffer alittle, but trust me its the best western ever made, one that you can watch without and enjoy not just watch and hope to die.  Its definetly the only western i like, in fact i think its Leones best, i also like the fact that he didnt put tons of smut in this one like he did with Once upon a time in America, a good movie but way too much smut, see this movie its a classic, its like watchin Tarantino do a western a couple of years ago thats all, totally kick ass.</p></br><a href="../users/A2LGRPM88JDWP6.html">A2LGRPM88JDWP6</a><br/><p>Extended cut but not as good a restoration as The Searchers or the James Bond movies.</p></br><a href="../users/A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z.html">A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z</a><br/><p>The third and best installement in Sergio Leone's western trilogy involving the characters of Tuco (Eli Wallach), Setenza a.k.a Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef), and Joe Manco/Blondie/The Man with no Name (Clint Eastwood.)  One of the best-known westerns along with its legendary music composed by Enio Morricone.<br /><br />As with its two predecessors, it was the last in a series of westerns that broke the traditional good vs. bad cowboy, sheriff v. desperado, plots and themes that dominated virtually every western film to precede it.  The characters are archetypes to set a particular mood of a land immersed in utter lawlessness.  Although Clint Eastwood's character is the hero, he's hardly a model of virtue as a bounty hunter who catches his fugitives only to save them later to increase the bounty.  Lee Van Cleef's character is the total sociopath who needs to keep up his reputation as a reliable hired killer even if it means killing his own employer. Tuco Benedito Pacifico Juan Maria Ramirez is the epidemy of the Mexican desperado: instead of being the stern, cold-blooded Angel Eyes, Tuco is the repulsive yet likable bon vivant bandido who's always emotional; like everyone else, he wants all the gold for himself.  The shifting scenes showing the grimy faces and twitching hands of the gun slingers adds to the tension and mood of the film: sheer survival in a very Wild West.  Slow and detailed camera shots revolve around the characters while Morricone's brilliant brass symphonic arrangements make the audience feel as if they're watching a matador preparing to run his sword through a ferocious snarling bull. All of this is presented through close shots of the twitching eyes, dripping sweat, and nervous hands hovering over the grip of a Peacemaker. The humourous treatment of the characters keeps it as a satirical action-adventure western instead of a drama genre.<br /><br />An excellent film that should be in every western genre lover's collection without exception.  Don't miss watching one of the greatest westerns ever made.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly (Sergio Leone, 1967)<p><p>There are a number of great things about this movie. The first ten minutes. The last ten minutes. The theme music, which has come to be synonymous with the American west. Lee van Cleef, who was great in every role he ever played.<p><p>And then there was the middle hundred sixty minutes.<p><p>There's an odd tendency among filmmakers to take a razor-thin plot and stretch it far too long. Such is the case here, with the plot being a race between the Man with No Name (Clint Eastwood), a hired gun named Angel Eyes (van Cleef), and the Man with No Name's on-again off-again sidekick Tuco (Eli Wallach) to find a cache of stolen gold during the Civil War. This plot meanders for two and three-quarters hours before getting on track, and that's about anhour and three-quarters too long. The subplots are never developed, nor are the characters. Tuco switches allegiances every ten minutes. After a while, it gets just plain boring.<p><p>Definitely could have used a good editor. Eastwood's westerns got better with age (his, not theirs); Unforgiven and Pale Rider are better, tighter films. **</p></br><a href="../users/ATZ1LTONGHOP6.html">ATZ1LTONGHOP6</a><br/><p>Set against the backdrop of the American Civil War, three men, one "good" (Clint Eastwood), one bad (Lee Van Cleef) and one "ugly" (Eli Wallach), race to find $200,000 in buried gold.<br /><br />At the time of writing this review, "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" was number 4 in the IMDb Top 250. Although it is a very well made movie, with impressive cinematography, and one of the most memorably scores of all time, storywise, it's not actually all that great a film and there are many other westerns that are far superior ("Rio Bravo" and "High Noon" are two that spring to my mind). Its main problem is that it is just far too long. The story is a relatively simple one, but it takes about an hour (out of 2 1/2) for the main goal of the characters to become apparent, and the remainder of the film is cluttered with many scenes that, although interesting as stand-alone scenes, don't do anything to further the story. To add insult to injury, Lee Van Cleef's character vanishes for a good chunk of the film, making him an incredibly ineffective villain.<br /><br />In the film's favour, "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" was one of Stephen King's inspirations for writing the Dark Tower series of novels, and even though I didn't particularly like this film, as a King fan, I did find it interesting to watch this film in order to learn what was in King's mind when he wrote these books. Seeing the landscapes of "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" enriched my vision of the "Dark Tower" world and actually made me want to re-read these novels.<br /><br />Overall, I would strongly recommend this film for fans of Stephen King's "Dark Tower" books, but if you're not a King fan and not into the Western genre, then you're probably not going to enjoy this film at all.</p></br><a href="../users/A1U6B2LDK3BUVU.html">A1U6B2LDK3BUVU</a><br/><p>Fairly interesting script, done too slow.  Parts of the movie drag.  Nothing exceptional about it.  Overrated.  The best thing about the whole movie is the musical score.  By far.  It really underlines the action.  I think when people rate this movie as an all time great, what they are reacting to is the music.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood isn't all that good and Eli Wallach isn't ugly.  The bad guy was awfully bad though, so at least he wasn't misnamed.<br /><br />The movie is about the search for buried treasure.  Eli Wallach finds out what cemetery it is buried in, and Clint Eastwood finds out what grave it is located in.<br /><br />There is an unreal quiet throughout a lot of the movie.  You don't get the feeling that you are on earth.  You are out in some windswept dustbowl or desert.<br /><br />This movie is stylized, and that, plus the excellent musical score, are the reasons that it is vastly overrated.  Actually it's not that easy to sit through the whole film at one time, in excess of two and a half hours.  I couldn't do it.<br /><br />When someone calls this one of the greatest films of all time, he's falling for the stylization.  It's like The Emperor's New Clothes.  There's really not enough excitement here to make a really great action movie.<br /><br />Another thing people may be falling for is just how cool Clint Eastwood is.  Remember, guys, it's in the script.  He's not that great a shot in real life.  It's make believe, kids.  He's the Marlboro Man.  So what.</p></br><a href="../users/A3D6OI36USYOU1.html">A3D6OI36USYOU1</a><br/><p>C'mon people, time for a little objectivity here. OK, I understand the deconstructionists love this movie for obvious reasons, but to call this the "best western ever"??? Hell, it ain't even in Clint's top three! OK we have three great characters, great cinematography, a unique, quirky, and sometimes powerful score, the first ten minutes, and the last ten minutes of the movie that are all dynamite...but then there's all that crap in between!<br /><br />Apparently, after 'A Few Dollars More' somebody convinced Leone he was a great maker of CINEMA(rhymes with enema) and so he set out to create this interesting but overlong sojourn to a Civil War ravaged New Mexico where bandits roamed freely between the Union and Confederate armies. Nice premise but everything drags and drags and drags-JEEZ! Each scene develops on an excruciating timeline and if you view this as a serious Western you'll be asleep 30 minutes into it...that's always the effect it had on me-even when I was 16 on it's release. But if you plant your tongue in cheek and forget about the artistic grandeur of it all then you might enjoy this thing.<br /><br />For example-let's dissect the famous bridge scene. (spoiler alert) So we got a drunken Union commander leading the charge (and he even looks a little like Grant but he never led any charges except to the bar at the Appomattox Holiday Inn) back and forth, to and fro...cannon fire.. boom boom...drag the dead back...yawn! Now Blondie and Tuco got to get to the other side of the river, but there's this battle raging on and on and on over this bridge so it's logical that our heroes have to blow up the bridge right? We don't know WHY but we want to see Clint blow the hell out of something don't we?? Me, I would have fjorded the river, which appears to be about waist deep, somewhere downstream of all the fighting but that wouldn't suit our purpose here. I fall out of my chair everytime I see our boys knock that poor wounded yankee off his stretcher so the can load it up with dynamite to haul it down to the river. So the boys wait for an intermission in the battle, wire the bridge while no one on either side is looking, blow said bridge, jump behind the sandbags for cover but one of our heroes-Tuco, has his butt stuck up in the air just waiting for one of the Rebels to shoot it off. More cannon fire..boom boom...now EVERYBODY is dead, except of course our two anti-heroes who miraculously survived. Even Tuco's a$$ survived all the shelling which took out everybody and everything in sight! Now with everyone dead it's safe to walk across the river to get the gold. Oh, did I forget to mention that? Yeah, they're after $200,000 in gold and there's another character in hot pursuit but I'm getting to that. First Clint/Blondie finds a cannon that hasn't been fired yet pointing in the opposite direction of the battle which suits him just fine cause it's aimed towards Tuco who is racing off to find the gold. Now Clint is so cool he never even so much as flinches when he lights the fuse with his cheroot...without a doubt the coolest scene in the film. The three finally converge at the location of the gold, there's some witty repartee' between our hero/villains, and then we all square off for a three way gunfight. Tuco, Blondie, and Angel Eyes.......eyes, guns, fingers, eyes, teeth, guns, twitching fingers, more eyes, jeez get on with it! I'm sorry people but this is not a serious western and I laugh jingos off everytime I see it.<br /><br />Not only is this not the "greatest" of all time, hell it ain't even in the top 50 IMHO. I will give the director his due for a number of innovations that have been roundly lauded here, and I even thought the Confederate Pep Band at the prison camp was a cute idea-silly as it was. They really needed a tuba though and the woodwind section was sorely in need of beefing up, but other than that? This thing is at least an hour too long but as a satire of the western genre I can live with it. I can't however live with this "best ever" tag which is an insult to the genre and to the myth, which is a myth to begin with. 3 stars, but only for making me laugh.</p></br><a href="../users/A2Q7YBUV8IPTLW.html">A2Q7YBUV8IPTLW</a><br/><p>Especially in lieu of the many other Clint Eastwood/Sergio Leonne collaborations that far outdistance this predictable and utterly ridiculous story.<p>Clint as always is great.

They draw their pistols and rush in. Shots are fired, and Tuco escapes. Then a bounty hunter visits an isolated house, searching for "Jackson". He learns the new name of "Bill Carson" (they were part of a gang of robbers). There is an exchange of opinions, shots are fired. The bounty hunter leaves to report to his boss, and perform another job. Next we see a wanted man captured by three men. Another man shows up to eliminate the competition, like a lion driving away hyenas. The wanted man is turned in for the reward. But his hanging is prevented, and he rides away to be recycled. [Can you believe this?]<br /><br />Tuco catches up to his former partner and captures him, the tables are turned. [This is like a cartoon.] Just like it looks like it is over for "Blondie" a runaway wagon appears to begin a new story! A dying man tells of a buried treasure of stolen payroll. Now Tuco must care for "Blondie" because he knows the name on the grave that contains the treasure. As they ride away, they see a gray troop of cavalry coming for them. The gray turns out to be dust on their blue uniforms. [Another joke.] Now they are prisoners and sent to a camp. [Was there really combat in the southwest?] This film is like a succession of short stories linked through the same characters.<br /><br />Tuco manages to escape from the train. Later "Blondie" escapes and they meet again. There is more gunplay in eliminating the competition for their business deal. They arrive at a huge cemetery, much too large for the small town shown in this film. [Obviously staged.] And so there is a showdown between the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly. Scratch one rival. The film ends with a sick joke about hanging. I wonder why some people rate this film highly?<br /><br />The vocalized song means there is no problem in translation to another language. [Isn't it funny?] The most interesting part is how a 1950s style Western was created by Europeans after they became obsolete in Hollywood. Not that they can't do better.</p></br><a href="../users/A22VNXHU6IZ5MT.html">A22VNXHU6IZ5MT</a><br/><p>Finally "The Good,The Bad and The Ugly" finally gets the red carpet treatment it deserves from the guys at MGM Home Entertainment!!!

While reading commentary by Stephen King regarding the influences of his Dark Tower series, I noticed that the Good, the Bad and the Ugly had an huge impact on his desire to create the series. So, loving the Dark Tower books, I decided to view this classic Western, not knowing what to expect.<br /><br />Let me state that outside of Firefly, I know little about westerns and the genre. I was neither hot nor cold before watching this film. I was prepared to watch a good movie, and I was not disappointed.<br /><br />The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is an epic movie with a expansive, almost endless feel. The scenery in the movie left me feeling that the Western land in the film went on forever.<br /><br />The story follows 3 men, Clint Eastwood as Blondie, Eli Wallach as Tuco, Lee Van Cleef as Angel Eyes, as they search for $200,000 in coins. Eastwood does an amazing job as Blondie.<br /><br />Eastwood defines the hard-nosed, cowboy hero/anti-hero role with this performance.  And Eli Wallach plays Tuco perfectly. You sometimes love Tuco, and sometimes hate him. At the end of the movie, half of you wants him dead and the other half wants him to live. Cudos to Eli Wallach. Lee Van Cleef puts in a wonderful performance as well. The opening scene in which he stands in the doorway, and interacts with a remote family is brilliant.<br /><br />For a long movie, the Good, the Bad and the Ugly does not drag. I fell in love with westerns as a result of seeing this movie (and Firefly), and am now planning on adding a few more older westerns to my "must see" list.<br /><br />If you haven't seen this movie, please do so. It is a classic, with great acting, an awesome feel, a great story, and wonderful cinematics.

More than just the average spaghetti western, this cinematic mastepiece has been regarded by everyone from Quentin Tarantino to Robert Rodriguez as one of the greatest films ever made. With this new double-disc special edition, this film has been fully restored in an extended three-hour version that features over eighteen minutes of new scenes that have been dubbed in English for the first time for this release. <p>Our three title characters are all after one thing: a large helping of Confederate gold hidden in an unmarked grave. They all go back and forth in forging false alliances with one another in an attempt to get what they need. Wallach knows the name of the graveyard where it's hidden and Eastwood has the name of the grave while Van Cleef is ready to kill at will to find the treasure. This all makes for an intruiging adventure as the three travel on their own respective paths through the burning desert, the war-ravaged towns, and the vast mountains. The only common ground they share is their journey for the prize and their willingness to shoot and kill anyone including each other who stands in their way. <p>This DVD edition of &quot;The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly&quot; is about as good as it gets for longtime fans of the movie. While some might be able to notice the difference between the newly-dubbed scenes and the original U.S. version, it's well worth it to finally see the movie the way Sergio Leone wanted it to be viewed. In additioned to finally getting the fully-restored extended cut of the film, there is another disc of added bonus features. There is a featurette explaining all of the hard work that MGM had put into reconstructing the new version of the film. There is also a featurre and accompaning commentary on the spectactular Moricone score. There are two &quot;deleted scenes&quot;, a longer and more violent cut of Van Cleef's brutal interrogation of Wallach, and a detailed video outline of the incomplete Socorro sequence. You're also getting three documentaries, one on the making of the film, one about Sergio's film style, and another one titled &quot;The Man Who Lost The Civil War&quot;, which has nothing to do with the film itself but is more of a historical reminder of where the movie came from.  <p>Having grown up in the 80's, I was never a huge fan of Westerns and in fact, I had never seen this film prior to purchasing it but after seeing it, it joins the ranks of such films as &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; and &quot;Scarface&quot; in becoming an instant favorite after just one viewing. It has clearly influenced so many of the films that followed it with its groundbreaking visual style. Eastwood's quiet but cool stranger was obviously used as the blueprint for many action heroes that followed. Even if you've never seen or heard of this movie, you will recognize Ennino Moricone's infamous musical score. If you are the type who has never cared enough to pick up a Western film, I encourage you to drop all preconceived notions about the genre and pick up this DVD. &quot;The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly&quot; isn't just some cliche-driven cowboys and robbers movie, it is a stylish and well-photographed action adventure. I think a lot of you will be pleasantly surprised in what you find.</p></br><a href="../users/A16KRCLLTHSB5F.html">A16KRCLLTHSB5F</a><br/><p>I can only agree with everything positive that's been said here. But what struck me most about the movie is that, although at first it doesn't seem like it, Eastwood's character really does earn the title of 'good' throughout the course of the film. Leone establishes that virtue consists of more than being the one most wronged in a situation or killing the villains with some small amount of reluctance. Although he is no great samaritan, The Man With No Name is willing to go to great and elaborate lengths to do the right thing and give someone else a chance at redemtpion. In the end, I think this movie is really about Tuco - caught between the extremes of Angel Eyes and TMWNN, he lives a life of crime out of neccesity, because life is more difficult for him than for an unreal character like TMWNN, but he has the potential for both good and evil.</p></br><a href="../users/A30TK6U7DNS82R.html">A30TK6U7DNS82R</a><br/><p>It's great that so much of the director's print has been discovered and fit in so seamlessly with the rest.  And the documentary outlining the reconstruction of GBU is super, what a treat to see old Eastwood and even older Wallach mouthing their young dialogue into their young mouths in the cushy recording studio, a far cry from the plains of New Mexico.  It makes you long for more, for there is probably another ten minutes of the complete version to be found, restored, and interpolated with the new extended version so splendidly presented here.<br /><br />The movie itself is one of the masterpieces both of Italian and US cinema, and how many films get to boast of that?  When I was a boy, the Morricone whistling theme became a top pop single, a feat that very few Westerns of recent vintage can aspire to.  It's a haunting melody and watched with Leone's trademark close-ups and then sudden cutaways to long grand vistas, it gives you the chills of sudden fear from your spine to all your extremities.</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>While I still find Sergio Leone's Once Upon A Time in The West to be his best and most morally complex western  (it's also the only spaghetti western that had footage shot in the United States in Monument Valley a classic John Ford setting), The Good, The Bad and The Ugly is certainly one of his most entertaining and interesting westerns. <p>I'm not going to recap the plot beyond saying that the trio of main characters featured here (well played by Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef and Eli Wallach)form an unholy alliance to recover confederate gold. All three manage to cross and double cross each other and while Eastwood's Man With No Name character may be the "good" of the title, he's by no means the type of hero you would find in a John Ford or Howard Hawks western. <p>The picture looks very nice on this DVD single disc release but (I may have a disc that is flawed) the deleted scenes have no audio. It says it features the original Italian audio but, in fact, the sequences are silent (which would explain why Eastwood and Wallach went back to redub the restored version released this year). When you do hit the audio button on your DVD remote it does say the soundtrack is the Italian version but, again, there's nothing to hear. The sound is so-so and that's not a surprise given that the original soundtrack was in mono and it would be very difficult to locate the original source audio for a digital remix for true 5.1.<p>If you're a fan of the film and can find this at a bargain, by all means pick it up. If not, wait until the restored version that Scorese worked on is released on DVD. Since that will include the 16 minutes of footage missing from the film with redubbed dialog by Eastwood and Wallach, that version would be the must have for fans of the film. I'm hoping that MGM is planning on releasing this fairly soon (much like they did with the restored Escape from New York which which is being released in December of 2003)as a two disc set with all the extras the film deserves. <p>One of the criticisms about the film is that it doesn't capture the true flavor of the old west (don't recall who wrote the review). That's not a surprise given that the film was made by an Italian film director with a love of American westerns. Leone's films are self reflective--by that I mean they are films about other films [...] You only have to watch this film and Once Upon a Time in The West to get this sense; there's references to a number of classic westerns in either film including The [...]other major and minor classic films. <p>Leone was interested in using the American archetypes created by [...] and other American film directors and bringing a sense of irony and cynicism. The films exhibit a European flavor and that's to be expected. Most importantly, Leone helped spark the interest in reviving westerns by American film directors. The western had largely fallen out of favor. Without Leone's trilogy there would have been no High Plains Drifted, The Outlaw Josey Wales or any number of mid-60's westerns.<p>Eastwood later refined Leone's vision with a uniquely American perspective in the classic films High Plains Drifter, The Outlaw Josey Wales and The Unforgiven. This cross pollenation of European art western and American pulp western gave new life to a genre that had played itself out by the early 60's. Every so often a film director comes along to breath new life into a dying genre. Leone just happened to have the artistic ability and creative tenacity to pull it off.</p></br><a href="../users/A17NFLRFTMYXF5.html">A17NFLRFTMYXF5</a><br/><p>Blondie and Tuco<p>Look for the gold, learn to trust,<p>Run from Angel Eyes</p></br></body></html>

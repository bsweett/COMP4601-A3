While this film is obviously more expensive, and has many more expensive "set pieces" it is much more like what I had expected from the first film: basically a roller coaster ride with a few amusing things to look at and a couple of semi-predictable moments where you get submerged in darkness and are whooshed along up and down the tracks.  What made the first film a nice surprise was that it transcended the "amusement park ride made into a film" genre.  That is to say: if such a genre had existed, that film would have transcended it by having characters who were fairly interesting, played quite well by excellent actors who were clearly having fun, and who "grew" along the way -- in addition to being taken along for a roller coaster ride.  The problem in this film is that for the most part these characters are taken for granted and then taken for a ride along with the audience.  The idea seems to have been: let's take every one of the exciting parts of the first film and make them bigger and more exciting and let's take all the "boring" parts of the first film (like characterization and plot) and see if we can fit them in there in between without interrupting the action.  A series of events takes place that washes the characters along, and the characters sort of move up and down along roughly the trajectories that their characters already followed in the preceding film: Jack Sparrow sometimes seems like he cares about others (the point he had seemed to arrive at by the end of the first film) and sometimes seems to be out only for number one (the point where he began in the first film), mostly in this film he seems to be playing up the caricature that in the first film seemed like just the surface of a fairly interesting character; Elisabeth sometimes emerges as a clever swashbuckling hero who takes a back seat to no one that she seemed to have become by the end of the first film, and sometimes, unexpectedly, she mopes and sits around while the men fight or pines over the fact that it seems she will never have the storybook wedding she had dreamed of.  This film is bigger than the first one, and as a couple of other reviewers have mentioned, there are a number of subplots that the filmmakers have set into motion making this a more complex film (I guess), but that just shows that bigger and more complex is not necessarily better, except in the amusement park.  On a rollercoaster the twists and turns are inevitable, and since you can't get off the anticipation mixed with anxiety is just part of the ride; in a trilogy you can get off and by the end you have to care about the characters and believe that it matters.  In this film (without giving anything away) by the end I had mostly lost my interest in the characters (since the film wasn't much about them, and primarily used them as a vehicle for "big events" like chases through the jungle, Krakens destroying boats, and swashbuckling fights on a rolling waterwheel).  Yes, Will's father shows up.  But their relationship is assumed rather than developed.  Yes, there is another cursed group of pirates that threatens to destroy stuff, and there are more allusions to Jack's past and the animosity and admiration he has inspired in others -- but other than his remarkable knack for getting out of sticky situations (which is mostly inexplicable dumb luck, combined with a Columbo-esque tendency to put people off guard by seeming oblivious while actually making plans, that are never foolproof but are of the sort that are "so crazy they just might work" and almost invariably and remarkably do), it is hard to see why he inspires such fierce loyalty or hatred.  I don't mind implausibilities in this kind of story, as long as the characters and their motivations are plausible, and I care about them enough to maintain interest in what happens to them, and in this case I gradually lost it.  Mild spoiler warning: The final scene, in which every one of the characters is devastated by the apparent loss of one person, and willing to go to "the ends of the earth" to save that person (because, in one of the Deus Ex Machina moments that was necessary to keep the franchise going, a strange gypsy woman explains that it is inexplicably still possible to save someone who has been eaten by a giant squid), in spite of the fact that lots of other people had died, and completely overlooking the fact that some of them had already found what they'd been looking for, and others still had other pressing and still pending obligations, and others had proven never to be motivated by loyalty but only by greed.  Nevertheless, they all "heroically" stand up to the task of undertaking another mission, i.e. they all symbolically agree at the end of the film to appear in another movie and we are supposed to say, like eager children who have just completed a rollercoaster ride "let's get back in line to go again!"  I'll probably see the next movie with my kids when it comes out on video -- but I'm no longer waiting in line, eager with anticipation.</p></br><a href="../users/A16Q1LYIDE2WDZ.html">A16Q1LYIDE2WDZ</a><br/><p>I loved this movie just as much as I loved the first one. It has a fast pace, lots of action, many funny one liners and a great cast. It's a long movie but doesn't seem long because there is so much going on. I was not bored once. Depp was HOT, Knightly was hot and the ending left me hoping that part 3 will come out soon! True, it's not a realistic movie and the fight scenes are really far fetched but it's a fun movie and I was entertained. There are some gross scenes and it's slightly scary but for kids who can handle it, it's a really a great family movie and also a great date movie with something for guys and gals alike. Some might find this movie childish but if you are looking for something light-hearted and funny that will be good for all ages, this is the movie for you!</p></br><a href="../users/A3RTMB76CJWY9U.html">A3RTMB76CJWY9U</a><br/><p>I'm not quite sure what began the trilogy trend, though I have a guess.<br /><br />For movies, it was probably Star Wars. Star Wars, itself, likely was a trilogy to follow in the footsteps of the Lord of the Rings. Interestingly, Star Wars was originally conceptualized as a trilogy of trilogies (9 parts, comprising three sets). The first number of book series made from the Star Wars universe all had to be trilogies, too (like the Zahn series).<br /><br />Whatever the origin, the fact is that any book or movie today which touches on the fantasy/sci-fi universe *must* be a trilogy. It's expected.<br /><br />While Pirates of the Caribbean is only roughly fantasy, it certainly draws on the same sort of fan base. And, sadly, it suffers from the same disease. As soon as the first movie was successful, its backers *didn't* say: "Ooh! A hit! We should make a sequel"; what they said, instead, was: "Ooh! A hit! We should make it a trilogy!"<br /><br />Why? Why two more films, and not just one more? Was it, like George Lucas, that they'd already planned out an entire series, and so Dead Man's Chest was already a vital part in the larger, overall plot? Was it like Tolkien who, ironically, never envisioned the Lord of the Rings as a trilogy--did they simply write one huge movie that had to be divided into three parts so that audiences could view it comfortably?<br /><br />No. Pirates of the Caribbean, like the Matrix debacle of a few years back, is a trilogy simply because it is expected of them. And, watching this second film, you can tell.<br /><br />Dead Man's Chest is going through the motions. And there are, apparenly, a lot of motions to be gone through--this is a long film, clocking in at about 2 and 1/2 hours. It concerns that lovable rogue Captain Jack Sparrow as he does his damndest to escape the business end of the deal he'd made with Davy Jones--100 years of servitude on board his barnacled ship. Sparrow seeks the "Dead Man's Chest" which holds a power over Jones, while other players (i.e. Turner and Norrington, naturally) seek the same Chest for their own purposes. Adventure and hilarity ensue. Kind of.<br /><br />The plot of this movie is stretched rather thin, and cannot support the incredible running time. It's almost as though they'd taken half of what might be a good idea, and tried to make it into an entire, feature-length movie. It's propped up with some very long action sequences (much like Matrix Reloaded) which, I have to admit, are pretty frikken rad and inventive. Those action sequences are the best part of this film, excepting for 14 year old ladies who would probably vote Depp and Bloom as the best parts, without even needing to see it.<br /><br />The characters, themselves, don't get a lot of dialogue time with one another because they're all separated for most of the picture. It's a shame, too, because their interactions were such a strong part of the first. Their characters kind of need one another to play off of, and so Turner and Swann and even Sparrow all seem less charming, and less interesting, while off on their own adventures.<br /><br />The humor is intermittent, though the two "chorus" pirates (one of which is Mackenzie Crook--Gareth from the original BBC version of The Office!) are wonderfully funny, all the way through.<br /><br />All in all, I think it's a shame that they tried to stretch this out into three movies. It's clear from watching Dead Man's Chest that they really didn't have a whole lot to say in this film (there are only a handful of moments that really matter, and most of those come at the very end of the film, to set up the third). And so, instead, they just have the characters running around, telling jokes and getting into various awkward situations because the writers feel impelled to fill the time somehow. It weakens the characters, makes this movie feel long to sit through and hurts the franchise, itself.<br /><br />The Curse of the Black Pearl was wonderful--a five star film. This one only deserves three. I sincerely hope (because I'm going to be in the theater with all of you, watching it) that the third movie manages to reclaim this series' once-held substantial merits.</p></br><a href="../users/A32XW50ILWOXNO.html">A32XW50ILWOXNO</a><br/><p>"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest" is an aspiring screenwriter's paradise, a dense, twisting, bulky construction that, in terms of sheer scope, is one of the more ambitious action scripts ever written: Here is a picture, written by Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio, that not only fleshes out some of the details from "The Curse of the Black Pearl" but gambles by resurrecting characters who easily could have been left dead. The three films are to be a sincere trilogy: The final plank, "At World's End," will likely better inform "Black Pearl," and vice versa. And the "Dead Man's Chest" is not predictable.<br /><br />But it's comfortable - because it's true - to dismiss "Dead Man's Chest" as a draining, boring experience, so plot-heavy that it tears at the sense of fun established in "Black Pearl." The two big action scenes are nearly identical and steal too much from the "Indiana Jones" series. Johnny Depp, as Captain Jack Sparrow, has vaguer, more passive role that mostly requires him to lurch through the story. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley are purposely kept apart. And so on. There are too many crews, too many heavies and too much exposition. "Dead Man's Chest" is an overdose. It is not a film I ever need to see again.<br /><br />A too-deep breath is required to explain all of the gunk trotted out over nearly three hours, so here's the very skinny: Captain Jack, Will (Bloom) and Elizabeth (Knightley) are all more or less after the treasure chest of Davy Jones (Bill Nighy), a half-dead squid man who commands a crew of half sea animals who sold their soul to him. Now, best I can tell, this ship, the "Flying Dutchman," zips about with its giant kraken floating underneath it plundering boats and capturing more souls. Jones wants Jack's soul, Jack wants the chest, Elizabeth, quite oddly, finds herself wanting Jack, Will wants, it seems, to simply get out of this movie, and somewhere behind all this is a Lord Beckett (Tom Hollander) of the East India Trading Company and the now-disgraced Norrington (Jack Davenport) dragged in from the first film.<br /><br />There are pardons, keys, cannibals, those two dummy pirates from "Black Pearl," two or three trips to Tortuga, an elaborate scene featuring Elizabeth's wedding dress, a letter from the king, a voodoo priestess, Jack's loyal crew, a dog, five attacks by the kraken, a giant water wheel, fruit, cages made of human bones, Will's half-dead father, a game of dice, a drunken brawl, two giant pigs and a scene where Jack shoots himself out of a coffin. It just goes on and on.<br /><br />Director Gore Verbinski falls into an easy trap: He takes the franchise too seriously. The music swells in this movie like a constant squall. Action is created in a sheer flurry without much interest in skill or believability. It's created for spectacle, not pace or purpose, as when Will, Norrington and Jack engage in a triangular swordfight that because begin to make much sense. Davy Jones is a remarkable creation, but without humor or dash like Geoffrey Rush in "Black Pearl." And Knightley resembles a sullen, withdrawn Rachel Ward from "Against All Odds": Save one juvenile scene, there is none of the girl's good-natured, brash pluck to enjoy. When a person is gifted with the ability to embody sunny cheer, it seems a shame to have her mope incessantly.<br /><br />Bloom just has no charm or wits at all as Will, and Depp seems to have lost something as Jack - he's too much a dope. He meanders around. He talks a lot. He runs like a cartoon, arms flailing, legs scampering. Really try to sprint like this for 100 meters, and see if you're still standing upright. It's not the boozy devil of "Black Pearl" but a boozy dummy. Davenport, as Norrington, actually has the most presence and cleverness. Hollander, too, embodies a crisp intelligence. While the rest of the cast plays around in drunkenness, wild-eyed lust and debauchery, the two boring villains walk in, survey the landscape, and calmly grab the picture. They're creeps. But focused.</p></br><a href="../users/A1N49TOJZFG48H.html">A1N49TOJZFG48H</a><br/><p>starting to get kinda busy . a significant step down from the first (character driven) comedy . thus begins the cavalcade of needless characters and deminishing return . bring on the computers . genuine filmaking exit up ahead .

The thought of having to sit through a 2+ hour movie dismayed me. Well, I hadn't seen the original "Pirates" and that probably turned out to be a hinderance. As the whole thing unraveled I became rather awe struck. So what did I expect, the Disneyland ride? The entire movie was unrelenting action. At no place did the activity level lull. The visuals were spectacular and interesting in a bizarre way. The stunts were amazing. Most of the characters were ugly and repulsive, both in looks and in person. The whole movie reminded me of a wild out-of-control dream, and it made about as much sense. The pure stupidity of the unfolding scenes actually brought out a lot of laughs in me. Both the high activity level and the visuals kept me from ever getting bored and I was surprised when it ended. It seemed much shorter than the indicated running time.<br /><br />The story line was exceedingly weak. Furthermore, the movie required a strong belief in the supernatural in order to get into it. I lack such belief and most of the plot, if there was one, was exceedingly hard to follow. Oh well, this was not a movie to promote deep thinking. What unfolded for me was an unrelenting stream of unrelated activity, most of it violent in one way or another. In places it was quite funny in a visual sense. I wondered how they could possibly put such a thing together. It must have taken an enormous amount of computer animation. Am I looking forward to "Pirates 3?" No.<br /><br />In any case, the movie came back to mind as I was browsing through the DVD bins in my local warehouse club. It was an interesting and enjoyable movie to experience and I've enjoyed writing this review. Would I buy the DVD? Not likely.</p></br><a href="../users/A77184QJM3PM.html">A77184QJM3PM</a><br/><p>It's amazing, really, to see how the whole world went ga-ga over "Piates" this past year. From a Hollywood dirty word, to a hot-hot-hot property, pirate films are "IT" now. I must admit I wasn't too sure about this film. I loved the first film, "The Curse of the Black Pearl", but I knew it was a stand-alone piece, while the next two films in the series were meant as a two-parter. Meaning, of course, that there would be no real ending to the second film, only a lead-in to the third. That said, I enjoyed this film. There is a noticeably darker tone right off the bat, which never lets up, even in the lighter moments. From the ruined wedding to the cannibalistic natives to the evil Davey Jones himself, not to mention the darker side shown to miss Elizabeth Swann and the fall from grace of Commodore Norrington. True, the critcs were not kind to the movie, and yes the plot does meander all over. Again, the film is saved by the performance of Johnny Depp as CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow. One watches and really wonders if he is really that bad, or is he hiding a heart of tainted gold under all those swaggers and innuendoes? Whatever the case, Johnny Depp is mesmerizing in the role. You simply can't take your eyes off him. Kiera Knightley and Orlando Bloom give more rounded performances this time around, and Jack Davenport is much more intrigueing this time around as Norrington on the fast track downward. The films effects are top-notch, almost overwhelming. At times, it seemed that the director just thought of something else to pop in and wrote a scene for it. There are some excessive scenes, but also some tender ones as well. The scenes between Will Turner and his father, Boot Strap, are well done. All in all, this movie isn't as well-conceived as the first one, but it is entertaining, and does get you ready for the third film, the series finale. Certainly, the surprise at the end caught me off-guard, and has me ready for the wrap-up! Yo-Ho-HO!</p></br><a href="../users/A2D0PJFW2VY8G.html">A2D0PJFW2VY8G</a><br/><p>Johnny Depp had been making great films for years before his role as Captain Jack Sparrow in Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003) propelled him to world fame as one of Hollywood's best actors. As much as I enjoyed his performance as Jack Sparrow I will be honest and say that for me it isn't Depp's best role and that I thought he was narrowly edged out by Geoffrey Rush as Captain Barbossa. I felt the first Pirates of the Caribbean film was good but the thought of three sequels concerned me. Having avoided watching any other films in the series I felt it was time to board a ship, brave seasickness and return once more to the Caribbean.<br /><br />Dead Man's Chest has a busy plot which splits into numerous strands. It begins with Will (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth (Keira Knightley) having their wedding interrupted when they are arrested by Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander) of the East India Trading Company. Their crime is preventing the execution of Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) in the first film and as a result they face death. Beckett does a deal with Will, sending him to locate Jack and retrieve his compass which points in the direction of what one most desires. Meanwhile Jack and his crew are searching for a key to the chest of the film's title but Jack finds himself on borrowed time when Will's ghostly father Bootstrap Bill (Stellan Skarsgard) informs him Davy Jones (Bill Nighy), Captain of the Flying Dutchman, is searching for him and has unleashed the dreaded Kraken to hunt Jack. What follows is a series of pursuits through the Caribbean, divided loyalties and intrigue as the various characters look to safeguard their own futures with some choosing to do so at the expense of those they profess to be friends.<br /><br />Dead Man's Chest jumps around a lot and I do recall some audiences lamenting the different threads of the storyline they had to remember as it all slowly pieces itself together. There is a lot going on in Dead Man's Chest with Jack separated from his crew when he is worshipped on an island of cannibals as a god, while Will and Elizabeth have their own adventures throughout the Caribbean as they search for Jack. As a result there were some parts of the film that were less interesting than others and only when everyone comes together do things start to improve. The introduction of Lord Beckett offers a new enemy for our heroes to contend with as does Davy Jones who makes for a fearsome villain, condemned to a purgatorial prison at sea where he is permitted to set foot on land only once every ten years. Barbossa's living dead pirates of the first film have been replaced by Davy Jone's aquatic crew of malformed and rotting pirates.<br /><br />As with the first film there are some great set pieces, particularly the naval battles but there were some other moments which amounted to sheer slapstick. Jack's escape from the cannibals is somewhat farcical, but still funny, as is that of his crew who remain in a cage but manage to climb a cliff and escape the natives before their prison is smashed after a fall into a gorge. Sword fighting returns as well with a decent but at times silly exchange between Jack, Will and the now disgraced Lord Norrington (Jack Davenport) with Elizabeth looking on and getting into a strop about pirates in general. The effects in the film were generally good with the likes of Davy Jones and his crew appearing quite fearsome and gruesome. The budget for the Kraken must have been sadly limited and it's fortunate the majority of its appearances are reduced to its tentacles protruding from the ocean waves. When it does appear in all its grisly majesty it's far from impressive.<br /><br />There are plenty of good moments in Dead Man's Chest, more than I expected to be honest, but there are some weak points. The subplots are too numerous and although everything comes together it's a bit of a toil in places. Depp is excellent again as Jack Sparrow but inevitably he isn't as striking as in the first film but that's unavoidable to be fair. Bloom was better in this one than the predecessor but I felt Knightley again was there as something nice to look at rather than to offer much in the way of an engaging character. I found Nighy a welcome addition as the repulsive Davy Jones as well as Skarsgard as Bootstrap Bill and Hollander as Lord Beckett. Geoffrey Rush was sadly missed in this sequel and his absence is hard to overlook despite some commendable villains taking his place here.<br /><br />Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is not a bad sequel to The Curse of the Black Pearl but it could certainly have been better. A more structured plot, some better effects and less complication could have made this much more accessible for audiences. Though better than I expected Dead Man's Chest fails to recreate the appeal of its predecessor and I think it will be considered in the same way Back to the Future Part II is, a quite good gateway between the brilliant original and the third part.</p></br><a href="../users/A370Z6I5GBWU44.html">A370Z6I5GBWU44</a><br/><p>Some sequels turn out to be really bad, but this one was highly enjoyable (if not as good as the first) and I really liked the character of Davy Jones, man oh man what a great villain! Johnny Deep does a great job as Jack Sparrow (as usual) and if you liked the first movie, you definitely should enjoy this!</p></br><a href="../users/A3N8RZSXKN1OR2.html">A3N8RZSXKN1OR2</a><br/><p>On the day that Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) is to be married to Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), a detachment of East India Company Marines, headed by the former Lieutenant (now Lord) Gillette, suddenly arrives with warrants for their arrest, based on the part they played in saving Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) from the hangman's noose.  Though Elizabeth's father the Governor (Jonathan Pryce) protests that they are under *his* authority, not the King's, Gillette is adamant.  The only option he'll suggest is that Will fetch him Jack's peculiar compass (which never points north) and a strangely configured key.  If he does, he and Elizabeth will be freed and Jack will be furnished with letters of marque, making him a privateer of the crown.  Will doubts that Jack will be eager to give up his freedom, but he has no choice except to go along.  Jack, it turns out, has troubles of his own.  To gain a captaincy he made a bargain with Davy Jones (Bill Nighy), the demonic captain of the Flying Dutchman, who is now ready to demand payment.  Jack protests that a mutiny deprived him of 10 of his promised 13 years, but Davy isn't interested in excuses, and he wants Jack's soul.  Jack knows that if he can gain possession of Davy's heart--reputed to be locked away in an iron chest whose key is the same one Will is seeking--he can save himself, and even for old allies Will and Elizabeth he isn't willing to share.  But when Will discovers that his own father, Bootstrap Bill Turner (Stellan Skarsgard), is a member of Jones's crew of the damned, he resolves to obtain the heart himself and use it to kill Jones and free his crewmen.  Then former Commodore Norrington (Jack Davenport), who was cashiered from the Navy after twice failing to capture Jack, enters the picture, resolved that gaining the heart will help him "get his life back."  So now there's a three-way race for the heart--or maybe five, if you count Jones and his crew, who are trying to protect it, and our old friends the formerly-undead Pintel (Lee Arenberg) and Ragetti (Mackenzie Crook), who don't know what's in the chest but can plainly see that a lot of other people seem to want it.<br /><br />Convoluted though this plotline may sound, it all works out surprisingly well, with plenty of top-notch special effects and costumery (especially the design of Jones and his crew, all of whom partake of the characteristics of assorted sea creatures ranging from hermit crab to hammerhead shark); Jones himself is one of the best--one of his forearms is actually a giant lobster claw, but his head and face are based on some kind of tentacled univalve, possibly a nautilus, and the tentacles on it are in constant writhing, restless motion.  (He and his crew, and the gigantic Kraken he commands, may be a bit scary for the youngest kids, which is probably the reason for the rating.)  Add in a brush with a tribe of cannibals, storms, escapes, and wonderful swordfights, plus Depp recreating his slightly fey piratical character, and you have a very satisfying, if rather long (over two hours), adventure/fantasy movie.  Hans Zimmer provides a thrilling score <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FTCF2M">Pirates Of The Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest</a>.</p></br><a href="../users/AXSH6O4OP5L4M.html">AXSH6O4OP5L4M</a><br/><p>I wasn't as sure I liked this film as much as I had the earlier one.  It relied much more on CGI for its impact.  Furthermore the story line seemed rather thin.  While it brought up a lot of questions regarding personal agendas and conflict of interests, it also seemed to go on forever without purpose.  It seemed as though "adventures" were added ad infinitum until the movie was "long enough" at which point it was brought to a d&eacute;nouement.  It seemed that manic hijinx for its own sake should carry the film.  After a repeat of a marginally funny uncontrolled roll down a hill into water, I felt that even the insanity was too staged.<br /><br />What really put me off, though, was that the d&eacute;nouement had "to be continued" written all over it, which suggested a far greater desire to milk financial gain from a popular first film than for the entertainment of the audience.  It was very formulaic, sort of A + B + C = movie--or more properly $.  A definite disappointment.<br /><br />I also ended up feeling sympathetic with no one.  Well, perhaps a little with Jack.  Though he is his usual reprehensible but charming self, he was never less than honest about whom or what he was, so he seemed less objectionable!  More than anything, I felt this film had less of the light hearted insanity of the earlier film.  Despite the impressive CGI and the constant bedlam, it seemed a much darker work.  Again there was a sense that "more was to come," and indeed it almost guaranteed that the viewer would return to have his sense of balance restored, which seemed manipulative.  I chose not to purchase or attend the film until after the third was available.  One could only hope that by the next film the series itself would be redeemed.</p></br><a href="../users/AUM3YMZ0YRJE0.html">AUM3YMZ0YRJE0</a><br/><p>While I love some of my kids' films, such as the Harry Potter series, Depp's Pirate series does very little for me.  It is very hard for me to get into it, to believe it while I am watching it with them.  They absolutely love the raucous nuttiness of it, the impossible feats, and the outlandish characters as they switch sides and pursue interests impossible to fathom.  I envy the way they scream and laugh as they watch it, so I am glad to have them put it on.  But the way we use it at home is to get them out of our way so that we can do things around the house rather than as a family viewing experience.  I find the battles tedious, the characters and situations unbelievable, and somehow lacking in spirit, like it was written by a marketing committee rather than conceived as a story.  I also find the acting rather flat and unengaging, which is unfortunate given the quality of the cast.  I guess this reflects the fact that the film idea comes from an existing ride in the theme park rather than a story that on its own inspired a new theme-park experience.  So my wife and I are willing to put up with this as background noise.</p></br><a href="../users/A1YB29BIDULEYE.html">A1YB29BIDULEYE</a><br/><p>Being honest, I did not much like the 1st "Pirates." However, I found this 2nd chapter to be a major improvement. A certain annoying character kind of ruined the subtle spooky horror Part 1 could have had. But fortunately, he never reappears now.<br /><br />Johnny Depp (Sparrow, I mean of course Captain Jack Sparrow) has of course gotten his ship back. But we see that he is in trouble with Davy Jones. (Depp owes a huge debt that has to be payed.) So, Depp is doing what he can to win some negotiating power of Jones. (Find his weakness, namely his heart, and hold that over Mr. Jones.) Will finds himself trying to save Elizabeth, and then his father. Of course fate will bring Depp and Bloom together. Granted the island of 'some undefined religion' seems a little silly, but at least it offers some laughs.<br /><br />In an interesting plot, Elizabeth joins the party looking for Will. We also meet a worn out James Norrington. While he was pompous and not so likable in Part 1, his destroyed defeated state allows us sympathy for him now. While we're on this subject, Elizabeth's father has also become a more sympathetic character.<br /><br />It's hard too say much without ruining the movie, but we have an interesting situation where we feel at least some sympathy for Captain Sparrow, Will, Elizabeth, and even James Norrington. But we also know that they aren't all going to get what they want in a neat package that doesn't do anyone else any harm.<br /><br />Another character worth some attention is Mr. Davy Jones. He is this interesting character that has elements of Gothic Horror but yet also sea horror. (A nice character who fills the emptiness left by Geoffrey Rush's death in Part 1.) Mr. Jones is really, really, bad. But he carries a charm that makes it virtually impossible not to like him a little. He wants Captain Sparrow's soul. But he is willing to negotiate. For 100 souls, he will consider Captain Sparrow's debt payed.<br /><br />Perhaps the most sympathetic character in the story is Will's father Bootstrap Bill who is trapped in Davy Jone's service. In a game of dice, he gives up any hope of salvation to save his son from Davy Jone's wrath. (Try to keep a dry face when he helps his son escape and says: "What more can they do to me?")<br /><br />Without going on too long, Captain Sparrow and his 'friends' find Mr. Jone's heart and only vulnerability. Then, we find that Captain Sparrow, Will, and James Norrington all want Mr. Jone's vulnerability for different reasons, and we have a dramatic, but not totally void of laughs 3 man sword fight. Soon, we see why we needed a few laughs here.<br /><br />There is a huge fight at sea. Mr. Jones is of course trying to get his one vulnerability back into safe hands. And he unleashes his HUGE monster. Captain Jack Sparrow wants to run, but he has a crisis of conscience and in a dramatic moment, flips the tables at least for the moment on this terrible monster. This really serves to underline the atrocity of betrayal from Elizabeth.  If you're on this website, you probably already know what happens after Johnny Depp pulls out his sword and says: "Hello Beasty."<br /><br />From here, there is utter sadness and what I consider the most sad, evil, and totally void of conscience cliffhanger end I have ever known. There is some hope when a character from Part 1 (who should be dead) suddenly returns to offer help. But of course, we want to know how he cheated death, and of course why he would offer help to his former enemies. (One of who killed him in Part l.)<br /><br />If you haven't seen his yet, I strongly suggest you have a copy of Part 3 "At World's End" on hand. You probably won't want to wait too long before you know what happens from here.</p></br><a href="../users/A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO.html">A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO</a><br/><p>Pirates of the Caribbean-Dead Man's Chest"(released June/06)returns us to the wonderful world of swordplay and swashbuckling that made the first installment such a hit.However something is amiss in this film and things don't hit the mark like they did in the first;not by a country mile.Let's look and see what happened.<br />The story this time takes us back to the exploits and troubles of Capt.Sparrow.The EIT(East India Trading Company) now holds sway in Jamaica and their number one man Lord Beckett.He controls the British fleet in the area and has sentenced Will and Elizabeth and ex-Commodore Norrington(in absentia)to die.However he will stay his order if Will and Elizabeth hunt for Sparrow and his errant compass.To buy time they agree and set off.<br />Their search leads them to an island where the Pearl has run aground and Jack and his crew are indentured to local cannibals;with Jack as the head of a tribe.Will and Elizabeth eventually free Jack and his crew and they head for the sea.Jack persuades Will to help him find the key to the chest which contains pirate Davy Jones'(Bill Nighy)heart.Sparrow's time is now up and he must change places with Jones as its captain.Jack will give Will his compass if Will will help,but a dark priestess Tia Dalma(Naomie Harris)tells him the compass won't work unless the person who possess it really knows what he wants.While at sea however Jones in the Flying Dutchman catches up to the Pearl and captures Sparrow.Jack puts off his purgatory by persuading Jones that he can get 100 souls for his crew within three days.Will is left behind as collateral.<br />Back in Jamaica a grieving Governor frees his daughter Elizabeth and at gunpoint she retrieves a letter from Lord Beckett which originally was to hire Sparrow as a privateer but she now wants for Will.She steals aboard a ship which lands in Tortuga just as Jack is there recruiting crewmen/souls for Jones' ship.After finding Jack he lets Elizabeth in on the compass's secret which he gives to her;and to their amazement it seems to get a bearing.They head off with a now disheveled and disgraced Commodore Norrington aboard also.<br />They eventually reach an island and all three join up with Will,who with the help of his father,had escaped the Flying Dutchman.They find the chest with Davy Jones heart inside but Will has the key which he stole from Davy Jones.A fight breaks out between the three men but Norrington escapes with the heart and the letters from Lord Beckett.Sparrows crew escape with the(empty)chest and outrun the Dutchman in hot pursuit.Jone's has no choice but to call on the Kraken to kill Sparrow.As everyone abandons ship Jack is finally devoured by the beast and Jones calls the debt settled.However he is less than happy to find the chest empty.<br />Back in Jamaica Norrington delivers the letter and heart of Davy Jones to Beckett.Tia Dalma meanwhile is host to Elizabeth,Will and the remaining crew of the Pearl.She asks if they have the courage to sail to the ends of the earth to return Sparrow back to the living.All are in agreement and who should agree to Captain the venture.....old Captain Barbossa.<br />This movie like the first has non-stop action and alot of humour throughout but this time around something has gone awry.The movie seems to have psyched itself out by trying to do TOO much with the plot.There are so many plot twists in this film it is very easy to lose track of who knows what or who is doing what to whom at any given moment.There are also sequences on the Cannibal island and the deserted island where the chest is located which are far less than what they should have been.In the former when the crew is rescued the action goes on interminably long with them dangling over cliffs and their inter action with the natives.On the island where the chest is located again the fight scenes which are supposed to be funny aren't and the silly three way fight scene on the turning wheel falls flat.Some judicious editing should have been done here.However the most important factor in this movies' lackluster performance falls on the one person who made it the success it was in the first place;Johnny Depp.The off beat eccentric character with all his eccentricities are not there as they were in the first one.Here Sparrow is more often than not quite serious and circumspect and the underlying "flakiness" is not to be seen.This totally deflates the impact the movie would otherwise have had and had it been there it would have deflected attention from the shortcomings I listed previously.No matter how talented the actors are if the same qualities that make an original do not make a sequel,then my maties,there be troubles ahead!This "ship" definitely hit the doldrums.<br />Technically the movie has been transferred well in sight and sound and is presented here in its widescreen version.The only extras available in this one disc DVD are some bloopers and audio commentary.<br />All in all a big disappointment from the first film.The film tries to do way too much and the plots twists can leave your head spinning.Depps' characterization of Sparrow is NOT what is was in the first film and this especially drags the proceedings down.The fine SFX effects are there as are the solid cast but it can't overcome its own hurtles.Let us see what the third installment does.</p></br><a href="../users/AER15RIMV8E6D.html">AER15RIMV8E6D</a><br/><p>This is a really good sequel that takes place a few months after the original. Will and Elizabeth are offered clemency by Lord Cutler Beckett if Will can get Jack's compass which points to what its possessor wants most. Along the way, Will runs to the Flying Dutchman, and meets Davy Jones who is also after Jack. Eventually, Davy sends out the Kraken, the large beast who belongs to Davy that stalks the waters. I highly recommend PIRATES OF THE CARRIBEAN: DEAD MAN'S CHEST!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />The first hour of this sequel is fun and appropriate to the original, but Dead Man's Chest soon gets buried under endless sword fights and a convoluted plot; it runs far too long and doesn't end at all, making this an unsatisfying middle entry.</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>After seeing all three of the "Pirates Of The Caribbean" films, I still think this second one was easily the best of the three. Most friends disagree with me on this, but.....hey, we all look at films differently.<br /><br />This was the best "Pirates" to me because it had some fascinating new characters; it did not have the sappy or annoying characters and romance of the first film; it had just the right mix of action and lulls and it had some super special-effects and humor. Much of that good stuff, unfortunately, was overdone in the third film.which also dragged on too long. This movie isn't short, but none of the action scenes go on too long and so the entire two-and-a-half hours is entertaining.<br /><br />Also (and this goes for all three of the movie) it looks absolutely super on Blu-Ray. It's the reason POTC is often shown in electronic stores promoting high-definition televisions because this film is about as good-looking as it gets. It's incredibly sharp.</p></br><a href="../users/A27P0MW8TE1JQP.html">A27P0MW8TE1JQP</a><br/><p>"UNDEAD MONKEY! Top that!"....Well, Pirates of the Caribbean 2 has a solid go at topping the top-grossing film of 2003.<br /><br />Johnny Depp, Oscar-nominated for the role of Capt. Jack Sparrow, possible the best-worst pirate ever owing a life  debt to Davey Jones, Captain of the Flying Dutchman, another cursed ship. Also returning, Orlando Bloom as Wil Turner, the decent colonialist, who in the spirit of Flynn's CAPTAIN BLOOD,  is drawn into the pirate's life along with Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Swann.Wil and Elizabeth are arrested instead of wed and slated to be executed for their part in Sparrow's escape. Wil cuts a deal to bring Jack;s quirky compass in return for a pardon for he and Elizabeth. The three become involved in Sparrow's struggle to free himself of eternal servitude onboard the Flying Dutchman, along with "Bootstrap" Bill Turner aka Wil's Dad. Captain Jack and Wil Turner's unlikely friendship continues in one misadventure after another, with more returning character's from the original than you can swash a buckle with, like Elizabeth's father Governor Wetherby Swann (Jonathan Pryce), the lovable buffoons  Pintel and Ragetti (Lee Arenberg and MacKenzie Crook), first mate Gibbs (Kevin McNally) and the fallen Commodore James Norrington (Jack Davenport).<br /><br />Director of the original, Gore Verbinski again throws the pirates into one amusing action sequence after another, from island cannibals, to an inevitable bar fight, some Treasure Island homages, battles with barnacled minions of Davey Jones and a runaway mill-wheel-three-way duel between Jack/Wil/Norrington that is worth the price of  admission and beverages.<br /><br />Depp's swaggering-staggering Sparrow makes any scene fascinating with his rock star take on pirates. But be WARNED: Pirates of the Caribbean 2 and 3 were produced back-to-back to allow for quicker release of two, meaning Dead Man's Chest is "a link film." And for those of us who endured the ending wait between The Empire Strikes Back and Jedi, you know what I mean. Pirates 2, ends with a bit of a cliffhanger which is always risky. The ending leaves almost nothing resolved and no villain thwarted.<br /><br />The locales as breath-taking and effects are as stunning as the original, in particular the ship swallowing Kracken. Sadly the brilliant Bill Nighy as Davey Jones is wasted as the overly CGI and effect laden character, who could have been anyone and was less striking than the previous films nemesis. In fact, I would rather see Nighy play Sparrow's dad (who was supposed to be briefly in the 3 movie due out in 2007)</p></br><a href="../users/A27CHILBK6HIL2.html">A27CHILBK6HIL2</a><br/><p>MOVIE: Here we go, probably the most anticipated blockbuster of the year. When the first Pirates Of The Caribbean came out it became an overnight success, and of course immediately greenlit two sequels. Dead Man's Chest is a little different than the first film, which is definately a good thing. I would absolutely have hated to watch the same movie again, and thankfully this film brings a different approach to the story and the characters. The first movie was more epic in my opinion. It was very grand with open-sea ship battles, pirates swinging from ropes tied to the masts, firing cannons, and one on one sword fighting. This movie continues in that tradition a bit, but also brings fresh action and humor to the table. Instead of Barbossa and his cursed crew we have Davy Jones and his sea crew. Jack Sparrow is in debt to Davy Jones and in order to keep his freedom he must in turn find 100 men to be on Davy Jones' crew on the Flying Dutchman. In a seperate conflict we have Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann who had their wedding ambushed because a corrupt politician wants to find the dead man's chest so that he can control the assests of the East India Trading Company. Jack Sparrow on the other hand wants the chest so that he can have control over Davy Jones and keep a creature known as the Kraken away. The film basically follows our main characters from one island to another in search of this mysterious chest and the contents it contains. The film is the perfect blend of action and humor that keeps it exciting and entertaining. This is really one of the best action movies ever made. The set design, costumes, makeup, and visual effects were just breathtaking. Davy Jones and his crew are the most creative and amazing CGI characters I have ever seen on film. This usually never happens to me, but I am still in question whether Davy Jones' face was all CGI or a blend of prosthetics and CGI. The area around his eyes, nose, and mouth seemed so real and perfect that I am actually in question if it's CGI or prosthetics. It is simply amazing how much detail has been put into this film. Hans Zimmer steps up as composer after replacing his good friend Klaus Badelt from the first film. Zimmer's score really made the movie for me, it borrowed the themes we love so much from the first score and blends it in with darker and heavier music that truly makes this movie a swashbuckling movie. This movie was so much fun, it was so entertaining, so exciting, and funny. You will have a hard time finding a better time at the movies than with Pirates Of The Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest. It is an amazing continuation of the first film and a great lead-in to the final installment in the trilogy, which will be released next summer.<br /><br />ACTING: Johnny Depp got an Academy Award nomination for his portrayal of Captain Jack Sparrow in the first movie. Depp is one of the most versitile and talented actors that we have ever seen on the screen. He truly has a presence that cannot be matched and he has crafted an iconic character with Jack Sparrow. Orlando Bloom and Kiera Knightly provide great acting in their supporting roles even though they have less to do with the main plot this time around. The real highlight here is the character of Davy Jones who is played brilliantly by Bill Nighy. Nighy is a British actor relatively unkown to American audiences. He was recently seen in The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy and The Constant Gardener, and he adds perfection to the character of Davy Jones. The cast makes the movie and they are all perfect in it.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: What more can you ask for? The movie has everything you would want in a summer adventure fare. The first movie was one of the top grossing films of the year when it came out, and I have no doubt that this will do the same. Gore Verbinski was able to handle all that story and make it flow seamlessly, it was always entertaining and never felt long dispite it's long running time. The film was perfect in my opinion, I really would not change anything about it. Also, there is a little bonus for those who stay after the credits. So, go and enjoy the summer's best movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R602SXNGOMJ4.html">A1R602SXNGOMJ4</a><br/><p>Let me start off by saying how much I loved the first Pirates of the Caribbean.  Johnny Depp was brilliant, the story was fun, it was immensely entertaining, even Orlando Bloom didn't annoy me as much as he usually does.<br /><br />I think Disney let their idea people get out of control. The movie just got too crowded with special effects and totally goofy plot twists, which eventually robbed a good cast of any opportunity to actually act. Davey Jones and his crew are so over-endowed with gimmicks squirming over their bodies that they ended up more being more distracting than entertaining. And why did the director need to get so focused on being as gross as possible? Johnny Depp nibbling on a necklace made of human toes was something I didn't get; I didn't need it, and neither did the movie.<br /><br />Compared to the first film, Dead Man's Chest was a let down. I can't think of any redeeming qualities, except maybe that it is making a few people a lot of money.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PNTEDGMOLMOY.html">A2PNTEDGMOLMOY</a><br/><p>Take your logic, your intellect, and your cynicism and chuck it over the side - the "Pirates" franchise is back and bigger than ever with "Dead Man's Chest."  And that's a darn good thing.<br /><br />This is a series that knows what it is - popcorn fodder extraordinaire.  I could try to recap the plot for you, but there are so many twists, turns, and subplots that I'd quickly run out of space. Suffice it to say that this is "Curse of the Black Pearl," only turned up to 11.<br /><br />What does it say about a flick when Stellen Skarsgard and Bill Nighy can play characters that resemble aquatic genetic mutations crossed with a zombie and still say that they get completely upstaged by another monster, the Kraken?  "Dead Man's Chest" is action, but with a brain and a wondrous imagination.  Too many sequels are extended reprises of the original, including dubious self-references to the first film.  While there is some of that here, most of it is done lightly and with tongue firmly in cheek - you can't help but grin when Jack Sparrow quickly mutters "Hide the rum" when encountering Keira Knightley's Elizabeth again.<br /><br />And ultimately Depp makes this movie, just as he did the first go-round.  Sure, he's surrounded by some excellent actors and special effects, but Depp carries this franchise as few have been carried - with a drunken stumble and a hilarious leer.  God only knows if Depp really hates or loves playing Sparrow, but he surely plays him with the same zeal that Mike Meyers brings to Austin Powers/Dr. Evil or that Jim Carrey brings to Ace Ventura - this is a character for the ages.<br /><br />Family-friendly but definitely scary at times when the Kraken shows up, "DMC" is a worthy second act in a three-act series - "At World's End" is teed up about as well as a next installment could ever hope to be.</p></br><a href="../users/AYWSFRCIMOAYE.html">AYWSFRCIMOAYE</a><br/><p>Not as funny as the Curse of Black Pearl. It drags in many places.<br /><br />It's still worth watching once.</p></br><a href="../users/AIFXFHO2N9WJB.html">AIFXFHO2N9WJB</a><br/><p>In Hollywood, what would seem to be the primary ingredients for making, what would hopefully become a successful sequel? Well, there's the bigger and supposedly better story, returning cast members, possibly the same director that crafted the previous film, and of course, the mentality of use what has worked before and don't change much of anything. Sometimes all of those components when mixed together works rather well, giving audiences another fun movie experience in the vein of the original while being different enough to keep our interest (examples are "Terminator 2: Judgment Day" and "X2: X-Men United"). For every success story, there is always a failure, where the components are all there but something went wrong along the way, and the movie felt too much like we've been there done that (examples are "Home Alone 2: Lost in New York" and "Ocean's Twelve"). So, after Walt Disney Studios achieved a surprising box office smash with "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl" it wasn't all that shocking to learn that they had pushed into production not only one, but two sequels to cash in on the pirate mayhem with 2006's "Pirates of the Caribbean 2: Dead Man's Chest" and 2007's "Pirates of the Caribbean 3: At World's End".<br /><br />"Pirates of the Caribbean 2: Dead Man's Chest" begins with Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) having their wedding interrupted by being arrested for their actions while aiding in the escape of Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp). To earn their freedom, they must track down Jack and retrieve his compass, but this is no ordinary compass. In fact the compass is linked to the legendary Davy Jones (Bill Nighy), an undead pirate with a squid-like face, whom Jack just so happens to be indebted to for being made Captain of the Black Pearl. As if this wasn't enough to worry about, along their journey Will discovers that his father is actually still alive and living out his days as one of the undead crewmen aboard Davy Jones' ship, the Flying Dutchman. Now, Will and Elizabeth must find a way to ensure their freedom, while helping Jack settle his debt, and somehow freeing Will's dad from his curse. Let the pirate fun begin.<br /><br />Well, did Disney make the right decision in making a sequel to their blockbuster film "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"? Essentially, yes, the decision was smart, but the execution was somewhat questionable. Disney made a ton of money off of this film, and the movie was very good for the most part. The story was much bigger than that of the first film's; however, it was almost too big at times with so much happening that the viewer almost loses track of some of the plotlines. Of course, this decision makes more sense due to the fact that this film was being made simultaneously with the third film 'At World's End' and when both were completed they would essentially combine to form one giant movie. So, the seemingly bloated storyline wasn't as overblown when viewed from the perspective of this film being only the first part of a new two-part story. With that being said, I did enjoy the story for this film, I thought the essence of the story was still very much in touch with the first film, though somewhat darker than the original, there was still plenty of fun throughout the picture. The characters had all moved forward to an extent from where we'd left them at the end of the first film. Well, all except Jack, of course. He's still the same old quirky, somewhat out of his mind, yet somehow manages to survive pirate as he's always been. It was nice to see that the stakes were all much higher for each of the main characters this time around, and that their lives were all much more complicated by choices that they made in the first film and apparently some made during the time between the two films. This film had a very distinct 'reap what you sow' theme running through it, which was a nice touch, since that was in some ways the theme from the first film, a good way of linking the films other than just having the same basic cast of characters.<br /><br />The cast was great, especially Johnny Depp in his Oscar nominated role of Captain Jack Sparrow. Just as he did in the first film, Depp manages to steal every scene he is in, and at times you wish he was on the screen more because some of the scenes seem to kind of drag by without his presence. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley were even better as Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann this time around. Orlando seemed much more sure of himself, and was much more of a leader type than he was in the first movie. While Keira's character of Elizabeth was less the damsel in distress, and more of a heroine who was quite capable of taking care of herself, which was a nice advancement for her character's overall story arc. The newest additions to the cast with Bill Nighy as Davy Jones, who was a much more menacing and deadly villain than Barbosa, and Stellan Skarsgard as Bootstrap Bill Turner (Will's father), were both excellent choices for new characters that fit in perfectly with this film series.<br /><br />The motto that Disney must have used in regards to this film, and its sequel, must have been "Bigger is better", because everything about this movie lives up to that statement. From the sets to the action, from the story to the special effects, every aspect of this film is way beyond the scope of the original, which is great except by setting the bar so high with the first two movies, it would be difficult to top with the third film that finishes the story started here.<br /><br />Which leads me to my complaint of this movie not having a proper ending. The first movie was self-contained, but when you get to 'Dead Man's Chest' you have a little over a two-hour movie that when it ends you still don't have any sort of resolution, instead you have to watch another film to see how it all ends. Why not make this movie relatively self-contained as well, with only a few loose ends to tie up, that way you don't rely on the next film to be great to ensure that audiences will continue to enjoy this film. I know why Disney opted for this route, the strategy of filming back-to-back and linking the movies directly into one another worked for 'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy, and since they knew they were going to be making two sequels why not film back-to-back. That decision was fine (and was probably smart), but that doesn't mean you have to make the sequel remain unfinished and finish the story in the next movie like the 'Rings' trilogy did. It's highly frustrating to me when I have to watch the next movie in a series to know whether or not I'm going to fully enjoy the movie I just got done watching. I want to be able to judge the one movie by itself without needing to know what will happen next. That's why I can't enjoy this movie as much as the first film, because it's an unfinished movie.<br /><br />With all that being said, "Pirates of the Caribbean 2: Dead Man's Chest" is a fun movie to watch, it is darker than the first film, so parents may want to consider that before letting little kids watch it. Definitely a great continuation of the 'Pirates' series, but shows signs of possible trouble for the franchise by setting the bar too high with the first two movies so that the third may disappoint, and by relying on the third film to complete the second. Regardless of all that, if you enjoyed the first film, do check this one out.<br /><br />"Pirates of the Caribbean 2: Dead Man's Chest" is rated PG-13 for violence.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RKI7RPP5CJMG.html">A2RKI7RPP5CJMG</a><br/><p>That's probably what you'll be asking yourself as you watch "Pirates of the Caribbean:  Dead Man's Chest."  At first, the film seems to come off as just a blur of swordfights and tentacled menaces, but it's more than that.  The tale begins with Liz Swann preparing to marry her love, Will Turner.  Of course, the East India company decides to arrest both of them for aiding Captain Jack Sparrow.  They have to bargain to save their own necks.  Mentioning Sparrow, he and the crew of the Black Pearl are after a key.  What's the purpose of this key?  It's the key (pun not intended) to breaking a pact between Sparrow and one Davy Jones (of the Locker fame) whom Sparrow owes something very valuable.  I won't go into particulars for the simple fact that this will ruin parts of the film for newcomers.  Meanwhile we are introduced to a horde of cannibals, voodoo queens, the Flying Dutchman, and a slew of new and old characters that truck the story along at a very, very brisk pace.<br /><br />At almost two-and-one-half hours, you'd expect to tire after awhile, but that's not the case.  All of the swashbuckling adventure is bridged at perfect distances by a swift-moving plotline that isn't boring and leaves the viewer hanging on for the third film which is to come out next year.<br /><br />The special effects are wonderful and do not get in the way of the film.  By now I'm sure that most folks have heard about the Kracken, but this isn't the Kracken of "Clash of the Titans" as envisioned by the master of stop-motion animation, Ray Harryhausen.  Instead, it's a very large, very tentacled sea monster who sinks any ship to the depths at the command of Davy Jones.  Jones' primarily CGI'd crew are all pieced out wonderfully, especially the hammerhead pirate.  Jones is also a wonderful creature to see on the screen.  He's part squid, part lobster, and maybe even a little jellyfish, and definitely has a nasty attitude about him.<br /><br />Johnny Depp, Keira Knightly, Orlando Bloom, Jack Davenport, and a host of other actors from the original film reprise their roles.  All of them do a wonderful job on the screen.<br /><br />In closing, I've noticed that a number of reviewers have compared this flick to "Empire Strikes Back" as being a bridging film.  In my book, that's quite an honor considering that "Empire Strikes Back" is one of the most loved films in the original "Star Wars" trilogy.  Sure, the ending may not be what you expect or hope for, but it baits you for what will probably be a stunning conclusion to a story that started out as a theme park ride and has grown into its own thanks to a wonderful story, dashing heroes and heroes, wicked villains, and a colorful captain that everyone knows by now, that being, of course, Captain Jack Sparrow.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GHUN5HXMHZ89.html">A1GHUN5HXMHZ89</a><br/><p>This being the second of the planned trilogy is somewhat more predictable. Second movies are always the toughest for directors since they have to spend much of it tying everything together for the first and the third. This doesn't allow as much time for creativity. In fact some parts seemed stretched to fill time in  this sequel. Don't get me wrong I enjoyed the movie, I just didn't have as much fun as in the first one. It made me think of other second movies that are dark like "Back to the Future 2", "Temple of Doom", and "The Empire Strikes Back". My wife and others have said they thought the special effects were great, but the barnacles and some of the makeup was just to creepy. Being as this is Disney family fare I tend to agree. This is not "The Ring" or "Thirteen Ghosts" so it does not need to have overly scary effects to get the job done. You want kids to enjoy it as well without having nightmares. The overall story is okay. I think a little more time on editing and comedy and less on makeup and effects would have been well spent. This time Captain Sparrow, played by Johnny Depp, owes Davey Jones his soul, and of course he isn't ready to pay up. The action and comedy were not as spontaneous. Rather than new fresh things, it felt like much of it was just carrying on from the first movie. I would still recommend seeing it and buying the DVD when it comes out. I am looking forward to seeing the third movie next year.</p></br><a href="../users/A26A64X86VL1R4.html">A26A64X86VL1R4</a><br/><p>'From the  beginning credits with a souped up Disney logo, to the opening shot of a roiling dark sea accompanied by a heartbeat, Dead Man's Chest announces itself as a rollicking, fantastic adventure plumbing the dark depths of human passion and greed as symbolized by the pirate.  Our characters are caught up in a wild treasure hunt which has high stakes--if the treasure is not found, Captain Jack Sparrow must lose his life to the dreaded Davy Jones!<br /><br />In order to really enjoy this show, you must take embrace the notion that you are on a fun-house ride with a pirate motif.  Then you can really enjoy the fun of the piece.  Johnny Depp is absurdly likeable and genuinely funny as he swishes and capers for the camera and employs body movements similar to cartoon figures.  It is clear that in Captain Jack Sparrow, Depp's homage to Brando's effeminate characterization of the macho man is taken to a burlesque level.  It worked for me! This was partly due to Depp's commitment to his interpretation of the role.  His silliness was nicely contrasted by the sensuality of his glance and enhanced by the heavy kohl around his eyes.<br /><br />Dead man's chest is a pun about treasure.  Is treasure gold or "something shiny" residing in a wooden treasure chest as suggested by the snaggle toothed pirates of the film?  Or is treasure what resides in the human chest-treasures of the heart?  Despite this rather depthful notion, this pirate movie does not explore this motif in detail.  Rather our heroes careen around the Mediterranean, like the boats in the Pirates of the Caribbean ride, from one skirmish to the other, seeking treasure.<br /><br />My only quibble might be that the ending left us with no resolution but rather an abrupt stop suggesting a sequel.</p></br><a href="../users/A1SPB225CVTRUU.html">A1SPB225CVTRUU</a><br/><p>I was not a fan of the first Pirates of the Caribbean, and I was just as surprised as Johnny Depp about his Oscar nod which was a total fluke. Not that I don't think he's a great actor or his performance sucked, he was good playing the role with the right amount of camp, but it's a cartoonish character, and it's got no depth like say his other less "successful" roles in Ed Wood and What's Eating Gilbert Grape, and Don Juan Dimarco. It's less interesting to see him play the same part, because it's just a bit repetitious. I must say that his performance still outshone Keira Knightly and Orlando Bloom. Amongst other supporting players, I was quite impressed with Bill Nighy(the "tako sunomono" villian), and the near-unrecognizable Stellar Skarsgard. Oh, and there is the scene-stealing Naomi Harris who was wickedly memorable. The fight scenes were better this time around and lots more special effects. They even let different ethnic actors play the creatures. I noticed the "Headless Sea Creature" spoke Cantonese in one brief scene. They do look very real and creepy, can't imagined the amount of prep work put in by the SPFX and Prosthetics department. The Production is quite lavish and impressive. Got to love the breakdown and continuity of the wardrobe department, even thought there is only a few changes for the cast. Wonder how many shirts they used for Bloom? The audiences is obviously divided into two sides; one will laugh at the physical and verbal jokes easily, and the other thinks they are not funny at all. I am more of the latter. Oh, do watch for a cameo appearance by Geoffrey Rush. I think he's going to make a comeback in Pirates 3, and I am certainly looking forward to seeing Chow Yun Fat's participation!</p></br><a href="../users/A2M597GCCE1N2S.html">A2M597GCCE1N2S</a><br/><p>Pirates of the Caribbean, Dead Man's Chest, is a fun movie to watch, even if the plot may make several people roll their eyes a little. It definately is exciting, the action is intense and the special effects are truly something to be seen (examples that come to mind are Davy Jones' tentacle face, the sea monster called the Kraken when it attacks ships in the open sea, and when Davy Jones' ship dives underwater) Some may not like the ending as a cliffhanger, but I found it a great way to lead into the third and (hopefully not) the final movie of this great story.<br /><br />Johnny Depp returns as the charming, yet off his rocker pirate known as Jack Sparrow. He has a life debt to the mysterious and deadly Davy Jones and cannot sail out in the open sea for fear of Davy Jones's sea monster, the Kraken, eating him and his ship The Black Pearl. Desperate to stay one step ahead of Davy Jones and his damned crew of sailors, Sparrow heads toward dry land.<br /><br />Orlando Bloom and Kiera Knightley return as well as Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann who are about to be married. However they are roped into finding Jack Sparrow as Will sets off to bring back Jack's broken compass to Cutler Beckett, a powerful and ruthless EITC agent who arrests Elizabeth Swann and Will Turner shortly before their wedding. They were arrested because they helped Jack Sparrow escape hanging in the previous film, and after being arrested Will makes a deal with Beckett who wants Sparrow's compass.<br /><br />The whole movie is about a giant cat and mouse game with plenty of humor sewn in between to bring it all together. Johnny Depp once again steals the spotlight as Jack Sparrow, and Davy Jones is another great treat to watch in this movie from his tencle face all the way down to his walk that he does as he paces back and forth in front of his crew.<br /><br />The action is spectacular but really far fetched in some places (an example that comes to mind is a three way sword fight on top of a rolling wind mill) not to mention a scene where the Kraken attacks the Black Pearl, but it is exciting just to watch. I actually went back the second the fight scene was over and watched it all over again!<br /><br />Extras include:<br /><br />Behind the scenes look at the entire movie<br /><br />director's commentary<br /><br />deleted scenes<br /><br />the making of Dead Man's Chest<br /><br />and much more!<br /><br />Anyways this is one movie that is awesome to see. Some may not find it as good as The Curse of the Black Pearl, but this is definately a good way to keep the entertainment at an all time high! recommended</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest" surprisingly holds its own and provides solid entertainment. Director Gore Verbinski pulls off a dazzling hat trick by managing to make the sequel entertaining despite all of the excess baggage it carries into theaters. "Dead Man's Chest" is a fun movie pure and simple. Enjoy it for what it is-- a summer movie designed to provide refuge from the heat and you'll have a good time. The film may not be quite as consistent as the first "Pirates" film but it's still enjoyable fun. A plot synposis is below for those interested. There are some minor spoilers so if you don't want to read them and be completely surprised (as I was) by the film, don't read any further.<br /><br />I should warn parents that this, like the first film, might be a bit too scary for some younger kids.<br /><br />***Minor plot spoilers in the third paragraph below***<br /><br />***<br /><br />Captain Jack Sparrow (Depp) must find Davy Jones' (a digitally enhanced Bill Nighy of "Love Actually" and "The Constant Gardener) locker to get out of an agreement to give up his soul to the sea dwelling captain. Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) are both arrested on their wedding day for aiding Sparrow's escape. The only way they will avoid prison and the death by hanging is to retrieve Sparrow's compass on behalf of the East India Trading Company and Her Majesty. All of this is somehow mysteriously tied into Sparrow's search for Jones' locker.<br /><br />***<br /><br />End of spoilers<br /><br />"Dead Man's Chest" succeeds as entertainment and while it may lack the surprises of the first film it goes down like a delicious desert. Fans will enjoy "Dead Man's Chest" but will have to wait till next year for the resolution to the cliffhanger.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NLZVP501JM5Z.html">A1NLZVP501JM5Z</a><br/><p>I'm not one of the people that scream, "ITS ORLANDO BLOOM!!!!!!!!!"  Actually I would be screaming, "KEIRA KNIGHTLEY IS HOT!"  But anyways I know that this movie is a set up and that it doesn't take the plot anywhere really, BUT this movie is just too much fun.  Johnny Depp is amazing as Sparrow(Some complained that his act got old)he is just as funny as he was in the first one. Bill Nighy is awesome as Davey Jones, somehow he manages to act even though he is entirely CG(great CG work in this film)I honestly cannot wait to see Geoffry Rush coming back.<br /><br />The direction is once again top notch, again some critics have said that this movie was too long, BUT I could care less about watching a long movie if I'm having a great time and while watching POTC 2 I was having an awesome time.<br /><br />Overall this is a movie that is good old classic fun.  If your looking for a great plot and a story that will make you think get a drama movie.  Pirates is a fun, rousing, adventure tale that lets you grab a bowl of popcorn, sit back with some friends and have a heck of a time watching it.<br /><br />Is this as good as the original?  I say yes because both films transport you to the Carribbean and make you believe once again in magic.....</p></br><a href="../users/A2A6NH6DPE0VXR.html">A2A6NH6DPE0VXR</a><br/><p>Sequels that have been filmed back to back tend to be disapointing, like the Matrix sequels. Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest doesn't disapoint though. It can drag on and on but once it's over it actually makes you want more that very second. The action, direction, effects, make-up and performances are all in top form. Even Orlando Bloom is better than usual and gives a better performance as Will Turner than he did in the first movie. His character is better developed as is Keira Knightley's. While Johny Depp is as unpredictable as always as Captain Jack Sparrow. The script is smart how it uses all of them, they all have something to do and just aren't back for the hell of it.<br /><br />  The new additions to the cast also do excellent jobs. Bill Nighy is wonderfully evil as the squid faced Davy Jones. Stellan Skarsg?rd is also really good as Bootstrap Bill Turner. He's half alive with starfish stuck to his face and forced to serve Davy Jones. Although he's not new to the cast, Jack Davenport gives us a different Norrington than the one in the first film. Here he's about as dirty as Jack Sparrow and short of dignity after he lost Elizabeth (Keira Knightley) and his duties as a soldier. He has no choice but to join Jack Sparrow's crew when he despises him.<br /><br />  Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is pretty long but offers more thrills and surprises than Superman Returns I must admit. It's action scenes are often either silly or exciting. While Gore Verbinski is an expert at making a good pirate movie. His Pirate of the Carribean movies are full of lively and interesting characters. I can't wait to see what he has instore for us with part 3 since he threw so much excitement at us just in the second installment.</p></br><a href="../users/A2K3L0DOPQQ697.html">A2K3L0DOPQQ697</a><br/><p>Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest does the right thing as a sequel: It maintains the same carefree spirit of the original and creates an even more fitting story to the whole Pirates lore. After narrowly escaping the gallows--with the help of his friends Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley)--and reclaiming his cursed Black Pearl, it still seems Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) has a few more fish to fry. More specifically the barnacle-encrusted undead on board the ghostly Flying Dutchman, lead by Mr. Octopus Face himself, Davy Jones (Bill Nighy). Jack apparently owes a blood debt to the inky captain and if he can't find a way out of it--namely locating the secret contents of Jones' famed locker--Sparrow will be doomed to eternal damnation and servitude in the afterlife (insert Jack Sparrow's face of disgust here). Making matters worse, Sparrow's problems manage to interfere with the wedding plans of Will and Elizabeth, who are forced to join Jack on yet another one of his misadventures.<br /><br />Depp's Oscar-nominated performance as Captain Jack is still a marvel in slovenly pirate behavior, with his slurred speech, swaying swagger and slack, waving arms. But whether channeling famed Rolling Stones' guitarist Keith Richards or not, it's the duality of the character that continues to intrigue us. He is a lusty, fearless man with a deeply defiant and somewhat sneaky streak but whose delicate features, long, dread locked hair, Kohl-rimmed eyes and almost girly mannerisms give him a subtly effeminate air that belies his macho antics. This time around, young Brits Knightley and Bloom have a little more to do, with Elizabeth's growing attraction to Jack and Will's reunion with his father, Bill "Bootstrap" Turner (Stellan Skarsgard), who's soul is stuck on the Flying Dutchman. And Nighy (Love Actually) once again makes his mark as an effective villain, infusing his rather quirky acting ticks--the laconic delivery, the laid-back attitude--which shines through all the special effects make-up. Let's just say, Nighy certainly rivals Depp in the arrogant rock star stance, even if he has tentacles for a face.<br /><br />The other thing Dead Man's Chest does right is make things bigger and better. From a hair-raising sword fight on top of a spinning water wheel to the way Davy Jones and his crew look--all water logged and crustacean-like--the film's production value is simply amazing. Returning producer Jerry Bruckheimer and director Gore Verbinski make sure the action sequences, the sets, the costumes, the make-up and the special effects give the audience a familiarity to the original while also taking them on a whole new adventure. And if you are a fan of the Disney park attraction (the one at Disneyland, not Disney World), the elements that got missed in the first one--the creepy bayou, the beating heart in the treasure chest--are in this sequel. Dead Man's Chest does lag a bit from time to time, especially in heating up the Jack, Elizabeth and Will love triangle. But that's OK. We enjoy watching their banter, as much as we do the rest of it. And for those who'll want more adventure after the movie ends, Dead Man's Chest gives us a promise the third installment will be just as much pirate fun.<br /><br />9/10</p></br><a href="../users/AUHG8KSHI529U.html">AUHG8KSHI529U</a><br/><p>What a hoot!  This movie is an amazing amount of fun.  It has adventure, fresh takes on the pirate and sea story genre, has some wonderfully creepy villains, has some laugh out loud hilarity, and is even touching at times.  It is one of the most fun movies I have seen in quite awhile.  I recommend it to everyone who likes to have fun watching movies.  And it is a decent family film, but NOT for young children.  The PG-13 rating makes sense because some of the creepy / frightening moments are even effective for adults.<br /><br />If you haven't seen the first movie, I would suggest you see it before you see this one.  It isn't absolutely required, but you will know the characters in a way this films assumes you do when it opens.  The movie opens with Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and his lady love, Elizabeth Swann (Kiera Knightley) being arrested by Lord Beckett (Tom Hollander).  They are to be hanged for helping Capt. Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) escape in the first movie.  I don't want to go into the plot any more than this because every detail of it is so much fun to discover for the first time.  Let me just say that you will not expect or predict much of what happens in this movie.  Even when you think you know what is going to happen, what actually is put on the screen is fresh and that goes for the sound of the movie, as well.<br /><br />Even the Capt. Jack Sparrow of Johnny Depp is given new twists and depths and delights.  Sure, there is the Keith Richards aspect, but then there is the shish kabob.  You will have to see it to believe what you are seeing.  I do want to praise Bill Nighy for being able to bring so much expression to Davy Jones behind that octopus mask.  That is not easy to pull off, but he does.<br /><br />This is a movie worth seeing several times.</p></br><a href="../users/AKT8TGIT6VVZ5.html">AKT8TGIT6VVZ5</a><br/><p>Run, do not walk, to your nearest movie theater, if you haven't seen "Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest" yet. I haven't had as much fun spending more than two and a half hours watching a film since seeing the last of Peter Jackson's "Lord of the Rings" films or the first "Pirates of the Caribbean" film. Although this installment of "Pirates of the Caribbean" is much darker in tone than its predecessor, this is one film which virtually anyone between the ages of 5 through 105 shall enjoy with ample surprise and pleasure, in store for those fortunate to see it. Admittedly, "Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest" isn't quite the perfect sequel, since the film itself could have used at least ten minutes of editing, most notably in a brilliantly staged scene set on a rolling mill wheel in which three of our protagonists, Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), and former Royal Navy Commodore Norrington (Jack Davenport) engage in a memorable - if a bit long - menage a trois of a fierce swordfight. But I strongly recommend "Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest" for both its fast-paced action and the splendid acting from its talented cast.<br /><br />I'm not exaggerating when I think the acting in "Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest" is better than its illustrious predecessor, "Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl". Johnny Depp's Captain Jack Sparrow comes across as a bizarre 18th Century version of Mick Jagger; funnier, with perhaps a bit more than a touch of insanity, than in the first "Pirates of the Caribbean" film. Some of his most memorable scenes are performed opposite Keira Knightley's Elizabeth Swann, who shows she can hold her own against Depp as a dashing heroine to the rescue. Jack Davenport's Norrington is even more memorable than his portrayal in the first film; this time offering a moodier, darker portrayal, that reminds me of Pierce Brosnan's James Bond, since Norrington is now down on his luck, as a former Royal Navy commodore, with no choice but to join his erstwhile enemy Jack Sparrow as a new crewman of Sparrow's pirate ship Black Pearl. And Orlando Bloom is quite convincing too as the young Will Turner, offering a performance as memorable as his Legolas in Peter Jackson's "Lord of the Rings" films. Stellan Skarsg?rd offers yet another mesmerizing performance as Bootstrap Bill, Will's enslaved father, trapped as a crewman aboard the phantom ship Flying Dutchman. Kevin McNally turns in another fine performance as Gibbs, Jack's first mate aboard the Black Pearl. So does Jonathan Pryce once more as Governor Weatherby Swann, Elizabeth's father. Last, but not least, Naomie Harris is excellent too as the mysterious Caribbean vodou priestess Tia Dalma, during her all too brief moments on screen.<br /><br />In "Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest", Captain Jack Sparrow must take his ship Black Pearl on an epic quest in search of Davy Jones's chest, after receiving an  unexpected visit from Bootstrap Bill, in a Ghost of Christmas Eve-like appearance,  warning Jack that Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) seeks his soul now, as payment for a Faustian bargain struck between Jack and Davy Jones thirteen years ago. Meanwhile, Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) and Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) are forced to postpone their wedding, finding themselves under arrest for aiding and abetting Jack Sparrow's escape (which was depicted in the previous "Pirates of the Caribbean" film). So the stage is set for a memorable series of encounters with Davy Jones and his favorite beastie, the deadly Kraken, and, at the film's end as a surprise, an unexpected appearance of a leading protagonist from the first "Pirates of the Caribbean" film. Director Gore Verbinski does an admirable job in steering his cast and crew through the cinematic mayhem which follows, offering riveting excitement for most of the film's length. Now I am eagerly awaiting the final chapter in this rousing cinematic trilogy, which is due out next spring in May 2007, but I have no doubt that I shall see this film again, long before its sequel arrives in theaters next year.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ01Q3070LT29.html">AQ01Q3070LT29</a><br/><p>DVD Running Time: 2 hours, 30 min.

It was a masterpiece in story, effects, and acting. This film (along with A.W.E.) just did not have the same feel of the first, nor a plot that I got into. I'm just not a fan of this film. It deserves only one star for some good acting and special effects. My recommendation is that you stick with the original and not see the sequels.</p></br><a href="../users/A18RQ2URRGIIEA.html">A18RQ2URRGIIEA</a><br/><p>Three years following the highly successful 2003 film "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl", Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightly and much of its cast reprised their roles for the 2006 sequel named "Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest".  Taking up where "Curse of the Black Pearl" ended, the audience learns how Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) acquired the infamous pirate ship named "The Black Pearl": he entered a blood-debt with the ghostly Davey Jones (Bill Nighy), the captain of the infamous pirate ship named "The Flying Dutchman".  Apparently, the Flying Dutchman still operated within deep ocean depths and would periodically attack other ships when Davey Jones would call upon the fearsome creature from ancient Norse mythology known as "the kraken": a giant octopus.  Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) had been told that his father drowned at sea, but that was not entirely true: his pirate father known as Bootstrap Bill Turner (Stellan Skarsg?rd) accepted becoming one of Davey Jones' ghostly crewmen rather than die.  Davey Jones and the rest of the Flying Dutchman crew had slowly transformed into creatures that were part human and part sea creature (various sea creatures).  In the meantime, Will Turner and his bride to be, Elizabeth Swan (Keira Knightly), were arrested by Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander) for having previously assisted Jack Sparrow escape; but grants them a reprieve if they can obtain a certain object from Jack: his special compass.  To save himself and Elizabeth, Will goes after Jack; who then abandons Will to the ghostly Davey Jones after persuading Will to try and steal a very precious key that Davey Jones always keeps on his person.  The key unlocks the contents of Davey Jones' legendary locker, whose contents will grant the owner power over Davey Jones and the kraken.<br /><br />With the usual sword fights, wonderful special effects and various twists and turns in the world of pirates, "Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest" is entertaining, but unlike its 2003 predecessor, the story lacked continuity and its characters were less engaging.  Some new interesting characters introduced in this film include Davey Jones, Bootstrap Bill and the voodoo-like priestess Tia Dalma (Naomie Harris).  Other returning characters included Elizabeth's father Governor Weatherby Swann (Jonathan Pryce), the comical pirates Ragetti (Mackenzie Crook) and Pintel (Lee Arenberg), and several of the crewmen from the Black Pearl.  Johnny Depp has been nominated for a Golden Globe for "Best Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy" for his portrayal of Captain Jack Sparrow.<br /><br />Overall, I rate "Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest" with 3.5 (rounded to 4) out of 5 stars. With the film's cliffhanger ending, we will have to wait for the next film, "Pirates of the Caribbean: At Worlds End", which is to be released in theaters in 2007.</p></br><a href="../users/A2JYIDH7JIG48H.html">A2JYIDH7JIG48H</a><br/><p>While I don't particularly like pirate stories (with exceptions like Treasure Island, and space pirates), I enjoyed Dead Man's Chest immensely.  It's a fun story with good performances and spectacular effects.<br />As someone with a life-long interest in special effects and animation, I especially liked the Kraken, a giant sea monster that reminded me of Ray Harryhausen movies - but it's so good you can't tell which parts are CG. Most impressive, I am told Davy Jones is entirely CG - there's no actor involved - and the same is true of his entire crew save one, Bootstrap Bill.  No doubt this one will get an Oscar for the special effects / animation.

I lost track how the heart got out of the closed jar. If Davey Jones couldn't set foot on land, why would he keep his heart locked in a chest on dry land?  A few of the stunts were good. The sword fight on the water wheel was creative. The main problem was that the plot was lame. Frantic action does not make up for a thin story line. Orlando Bloom was captured so often it defies imagination. Depp was good. It was a typical bad sequel. The producers must have thought more stunts, uglier monsters, and more danger would be better, but it wasn't. They lost most of the charm and the humor. I was just bored and then it was opened ended so they can have another sequel. They should have stopped with just one.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>The second `Pirates of the Caribbean' is actually a very long (2 h 31 m) and costly teaser for the next entry that will be released in 2007. I don't mean to say the first sequel has no merits. It is fair to say that this film is entertaining enough with so many adventures, but at the same time I'm afraid that the magic that worked in the original is almost gone ... for now.<br /><br />The weakest point of the `Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest' is obvious from the very beginning. It is the script by Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, who attempt to draw a bigger picture than it should be, trying to contain as many elements as possible. The basic story is about pirate Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp, good as ever) and Davy Jones (unrecognizable Bill Nighy), the latter claiming Jack's soul for an old contract.<br /><br />Besides that, there is another plot about the parenthood of Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), less memorable character from the first film. Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) also comes back, together with Norrington (Jack Davenport) a forgettable character that few people would remember. So many characters are crammed into the 150-minute film, and you will never see the point of the story unless you have seen the original. Or maybe you won't if you have.<br /><br />The good news is Jack Sparrow (for which Johnny Depp was Oscar-nominated) retains his amusing eccentricity. Depp's interpretation of the character as rock-and-roll version of pirate is still the most attractive part of the series, and probably will be. Some delightful characters are back such as the comic duo of Pintel (Lee Arenberg) and Ragetti (Mackenzie Crook), both funny as before.<br /><br />Except for some set-pieces (like Jack's `fruits-throwing' sequences, funny slapstick), the second `Pirates' film has lost the unpredictability and originality of the first one. The film looks great, and entertaining as a whole, but is a letdown when seen beside the original. Let's wait for the next entry and what Chow Yun-Fat can do.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TAPL67U2A5HM.html">A2TAPL67U2A5HM</a><br/><p>Pirates of the Caribbean - Dead Man's Chest (Widescreen Edition)~ Johnny Depp is a bombastic sequell to the first poc movie and is just as good as the orignal but different in many ways. The script is a bit more one dimentional. Yet this is not bad since this what one expects from such a movie. It is not like one can expect a movie in the style of Ben Hur since this movie is based on action and not plot. Johnny Depp is amazing in the role of Jack Sparrow and once more he steals the show with his crazy ideas and wacky behavior. The special effects are even better then the first movie and the music adds nicely to the atmosphere. Highly recommended indeed and I easily give it 5 out of 5 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A8X8D4BUY5DFU.html">A8X8D4BUY5DFU</a><br/><p>Good pirate movie but not quite the dash of the "curse" also with a little sense missing.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DK5AZMXS1QA3.html">A1DK5AZMXS1QA3</a><br/><p>POTC2 received bad reviews from critics, yet fans loved it; as witnessed by the huge ticket sales both in the US and overseas.  It was the highest grossing movie of 2006, the most anticipated sequel of that year, and counter to what many critics claimed, a unique movie unto itself.  The first POTC was a great action-adventure flick, with scenes of situational comedy spliced in.  However, the action and the comedy were usually kept separate.  POTC2 is different in this respect; the comedy is inherent in the action scenes.  Examples include the swordfight in the water wheel, Jack's escape from the roasting pit, and the simultaneous escape of the Pearl's crew from the cannibals.  Hence whereas the first POTC had irony, sarcasm, wit and sitcom humor to provide the laughs, the second POTC relies on pure, unbridled, and very original slapstick.  The result is a mix of Three Stooges and Indiana Jones on the high seas.<br /><br />Similar to the first movie, POTC2 authentically recreates the sailing life and world pre-Industrial Revolution.  Whippings of crew members, superstitions, general illiteracy, and the looming power of large shipping companies (played by the East India Trading Company here) were everyday features of the seafaring life in the 1700s that are completely absent today.  This second POTC has many of the same tunes as the first POTC, with several key additions; most notably the music for the Flying Dutchman, the Kraken, and Davy Jones himself.<br /><br />This DVD contains the movie, some special features, but no extra scenes.  Overall, a great movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AOKQCH0YBZDS.html">A3AOKQCH0YBZDS</a><br/><p>I am mainly giving this movie such a high rating for the following reasons:<br /><br />1) Johnny Depp is perfectly cast as Captain Jack Sparrow in this movie and gives a phenomenal performance that no other actor could have given this role. Just the facial expressions and body language Depp employs for his role alone, shows his immense talent as a skilled actor.<br /><br />2) The costuming, make-up, set design, lighting and cinematography are phenomenal for this movie and look very realistic..... especially for the character of Davy Jones and his crew.<br /><br />3) Phenomenal computer generated scenes with the kraken/squid attacking the pirates ships at sea.... It is truly amazing how far computer generated scenes have come.<br /><br />I think what was a deterrent for me in terms of watching this movie and why I didn't rate it as "5 stars" was because:<br /><br />1) This movie's storyline dragged out way too long. I felt that a lot of the scenes were just used as fillers/fluff to stretch out the movie and make it longer..... Along with showing off all of the special effects that may be employed today. I think this movie would have made a lot more sense to the viewer in terms of the storyline, if it could have been made shorter.<br /><br />2) This movie was reminiscent of the Jules Verne novel 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.<br /><br />3) Keira Knightley can't act. Sure she makes nice eye candy, but that is about it. I think that some other actress with better talent should have been cast in the role of Elizabeth Swann.</p></br><a href="../users/AYWAY5MKLAITN.html">AYWAY5MKLAITN</a><br/><p>"Absoluetely great"<br /><br />"The Crave has just been satisfied!"<br /><br />"Captain Jack is Back!"<br /><br />"Better than the first!"<br /><br />"Overshadows the first!"<br /><br />Anyway you put it, Dead Man's chest has really been getting Rave Reviews. I saw the midnight showing of this movie and let me tell you that it was TOTALLY AWESOME!!!!! Who wouldn't enjoy this movie?!<br /><br />This movie is not just another plot, the same characters and all that jazz. This movie picks up right where the original left off. In fact, this time there are new baddies. You'll find out how captain Jack became a captain, you'll find out why his compass does not work, you'll find out what Davy jones has to do with it.<br /><br />In this movie there is heavy swashbuckling, gigantic sets, hilarious jokes, and more rum. It makes you feel like a kid again to see these characters outwit, stumble, and get back up again. It even had an Indianna Jones type feel to it. And a real plus is the fact that Captain Jack Sparrow hasn't changed at all. At not one moment did Johnny depp depart from the persona of this funny bugsbunny/groucho marx character. Yes, in this movie, his part is somewhat trimmed but that's even better. the writers of this movie are brilliant, becuase having his screen time trimmed just means that you're that much eager to see the next scene with him in it.<br /><br />But I'd have to say that the real thing that sold me on this movie was the last 10 minutes of the end! It will totally warp your mind but you will be thrilled when you see it! I was completely shocked and giddy when I saw the end and so were my friends!<br /><br />It's a pirate movie that you do not want to miss!<br /><br />It's been only one day since the movie has been out and already people want to see Pirates of the Carribean: At World's End right away.<br /><br />Captain Jack Is back, Mates!!! And he's better than ever!!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A3JLOIXFM75QNV.html">A3JLOIXFM75QNV</a><br/><p>I adored this movie. I have heard from people that they found it confusing, but I disagree. I got everything perfectly the first time around and loved it from beginning to end. The acting was great, Johnny of course was awesome as usual and the effects were amazing. I loved the length of the movie too. Most people would think it long but it had me completely enthralled that I forgot about the length. Its just a great fun popcorn flick. Actually, its the epitome of popcorn flicks.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NIQK6ZLYEP1L.html">A3NIQK6ZLYEP1L</a><br/><p>I loved the first movie and still find the character of Jack Sparrow, excuse me, Captain Jack Sparrow funny and also somewhat realistic in how he acts and responses to those around him.  Even his outfit is realistic when compared to other pirate movies.  After having said that I have to point out that all the special effects and pirate humor in the world can't save a weak plot.  It WAS written on the spot, the many special features dealing with how the movie was made tells us that!<br />They took from everybody.  The black spot is from Treasure Island, the cannibals from the Muppet's version of Treasure Island, the hanging cages from Time Bandits and, YES, even the title for the film comes from the SEQUEL to the book Treasure Island.  Also, I have a few nitpicks.  First off, Davy Jones was never captain of the Flying Dutchmen.  Also, why was the East India Company in the Caribbean?<br />I know this is the first movie of a two part movie deal but that is no defense.  The Empire Strikes Back and The Two Towers were, alone, great movies and they were part of a larger series.  Why were they so good?  The great stories they started out with.<br />But, as I have already pointed out, Dead Men's Chest is nothing but scenes and gags glued together, made to hold us in our seats till the third movie came out.  And I haven't seen the third movie so I am NOT impressed by this one.</p></br><a href="../users/A2OCJNB6B46OKP.html">A2OCJNB6B46OKP</a><br/><p>I knew that as successful that the first Pirates was there was no doubt going to be a sequel in the works. So this time when the trailers were being released for 'Pirates Of The Carribean: Dead Man's Chest' I was eager to return to the theaters and get great for another wave crashing roller coaster.<br /><br />With a successful first time around this movie got the same actors but a much bigger budget so now it was time for the story to take a back seat and let the special effects have their day in the sun. First and foremost the movie was not bad, it still had the same writters and cast so the jokes and action were still at its peak. Also casting Bill Nighey as Davey Jones was a stroke of genius because he also like Geoffrey Rush can nail the fierce pirate persona. The only thing was there were some scenes where it just didn't make any sense and also the movie was much longer than the first so there were points where things were just being taken too over the top to the point where a person can rise up in a crowded theater and scream 'Enough already!'<br /><br />Once again with more plot twists and very shocking cliffhanger ending, wehn the credits start rolling you will still put your hands together and clap and be a little happier because now you know the final instalment is on the way and you will finally get your answers. (Part 2 of 3)</p></br><a href="../users/A30LMTLC9XVWKJ.html">A30LMTLC9XVWKJ</a><br/><p>I finally saw this at a theatre this weekend. I love movies but hate theaters. But I was in the middle of three days of eight and under fastpitch softball, it was 95 degrees at the nearly shade-less softball complex, and the small town theater had $4 matin&eacute;e prices. About midway through I got a headache but that could have been from the 32 ounce slushy rather than the film. Considering this has been out for five weeks there was fairly large crowd in the theater.<br /><br />Basically it was an entertaining film if not as good as the first one. It was really too long (most of the cannibal scenes should have been cut as the film really dragged at this point).<br /><br />The assembly of the film was horrible, making the story hard to follow and failing to build up even a tiny bit of suspense. But it works fine as a comedy.<br /><br />Knightley's character has less screen time than the original and her stuff is more silly than funny. You could say the same for Depp and Bloom as there is more focus on the supporting cast (a good thing in the cases of Davy Jones and the bubbling pair of Black Pearl crewman-a bad thing otherwise).<br /><br />While certainly better than recent CG mega-movie like "King Kong", the unprecedented attendance is hard to understand. These computer generated action sequences are getting very old and losing their effectiveness with seasoned viewers ("20,000 Leagues Under the Sea" did scarier stuff using rubber tentacles almost 50 years ago) and the CG scenery backgrounds are little better than the old painted backdrops.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ.html">A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ</a><br/><p>There is a trend with sequels to a great original never being able to match the first film or best it. Every once in a while there is a sequel that acheives one of those feats. 'Dead Man's Chest' is one of those rare films. It isn't necessarily better than the first film, but it's every bit as good. And that's really good. Our favorite cast of characters return as Will Turner and Elizabeth Swan(Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightley)are imprisoned and set for death for letting Captain Jack Sparrow escape. Will cuts a deal with a man to find Jack and bring back his compass. Meanwhile, Jack is battling the evil Davey Jones(insert "Daydream Beliver" joke here), a sea creature pirate Jack owes a debt too. Then the race is on to find Davey Jones' heart, buried in a chest, and destroy it. The plot and main focus here get shuffled in all the action and great set pieces. And what great set pieces they are. Director Gore Verbinski has crafted one amazing looking film. The cinematography is sharp and sparkling, and his eye for detail is amazing. The action scenes raise the bar from the first film, including a water wheel fight that is nothing short of brilliant, and a giant sea monster destroying the Black Pearl that has some of the best effects I have seen. The film itself is a bit darker in tone than the first, is a tad bit more violent and may be a bit more terrifying for younger viewers. But the spirit and the humor is still there in full bloom. If there is one problem, it's that the film seems to go on forever. This usually doesn't bother me, but even I felt like it would never end. It's about the same length as Superman Returns, and that didn't bother me. As for the ending, it's jaw dropping superb. It's not a cheat and will not upset you. It's perfect. It will make you want to see part 3 even more. It's like a "Star Wars" cliffhanger, which makes sense since this movie is like the "Empire Strikes Back" of the Pirate movies. Bravo!. The score is wonderful as well. Hans Zimmer does another great job to make the music lift the already rousing scenes and action moments to even greater heights. But really, this is Johnny's movie. Captain Jack has lost nothing. He has another classic and memorable entrance in this one as he did in the first. I can't say enough about it. There has just never been a character, or a performance, like Depp's. He's a genius. Bloom is steady, but his parts are the least interesting. Knightley is breathtakingly beautiful, but she doesn't really serve the script much. Jack Davenport returns as Norrington, and Jonathan Pryce has another small role as Governor Swan. The sea creatures are unbelieveably designed and acted out. Bill Nighy, as Davey Jones, does wonders with the role. You haven't seen anything like this villain before. I loved "Superman Returns" to death, but this is the movie to see this summer. It's the perfect summer movie. What big summer blockbusters were made for. But see Supes's big return as well. I for one cannot wait until next May. Spider-Man 3?. Nah. Pirates 3 all the way. Yo ho ho!.</p></br><a href="../users/A13E0ARAXI6KJW.html">A13E0ARAXI6KJW</a><br/><p>Johnny Depp's preening cheekiness as Captain Jack Sparrow continues to be the invaluable glue that holds together this action-packed, over-the-top movie, the second in a trilogy inspired by the well-loved, nearly forty year-old ride in Disneyland. The jam-packed story picks up relatively soon after the point where the last one left off with spunky Elizabeth Swann about to marry adventurer Will Turner. Complications come in the form of British East India Trading Company's Lord Cutler Beckett, who charges the couple with conspiring to help Sparrow escape from the company's clutches. Death is their fate unless they can secure Sparrow's magical compass for Beckett. Sparrow has troubles of his own as he has sold his soul to the legendary dawn-of-the-dead pirate, Davy Jones, fabled captain of the Flying Dutchman, in exchange for the right to command his vessel, the Black Pearl. Sparrow's one option is to find the key to a chest containing Jones' still-beating heart.<br /><br />The storylines eventually collide but not before the main characters run into a voodoo woman, Tia Dalma, full of mystical advice on how to get the key; Elizabeth's jilted swain, Commodore James Norrington, out for revenge against Will; Will's lost-soul father, Bootstrap Bill Turner, somewhere between life and death; and a mammoth, octopus-like sea monster named Kraker. After a shaky start with far too much exposition, director Gore Verbinski gets the momentum finally going in the second hour with heart-racing action escalating in both scope and absurdity, although screenwriters Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio tend to layer all the developments in a most convoluted manner. Despite the pacing problems, what I do like about the film is its persistently irreverent tone and the way death is treated not as the final end but as a relative inconvenience. From my perspective, this is what makes the movie's spirit come alive for a contemporary viewer.<br /><br />Beyond Depp's devilishly clever performance, the real star is unsurprisingly the CGI-generated special effects, whether it's Jones and his ocean-morphed crew of half men/half sea creatures (the hammerhead shark is a particularly creepy figure to watch); Kraker and its engulfing destruction (though this gets repetitive in the story); or the variety of memorable action set pieces, such as the Black Pearl crew swinging in a ravine to escape their suspended spherical cages, or concurrently, Sparrow precariously maneuvering a pole where he inadvertently becomes part of a fruit shish kebob. My favorite set piece is the runaway waterwheel on the island where Will, Norrington and Sparrow are preoccupied with their swashbuckling and the search for the chest. The audacious silliness of these action sequences is what keeps the movie afloat.<br /><br />Both Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom return from the first film as Elizabeth and Will. Looking beautiful, even disguised as a boy, Knightley has been promoted into more of an action role here and handles her part with aplomb. Bloom is still a relatively colorless presence but fulfills the heroic dimensions of the part almost by default. As Davy Jones, Bill Nighy is able to create an intriguing character underneath the CGI-generated visage of octopus tentacles, and in a tribute to Jules Verne's "20,000 Leagues Under the Sea", has a great scene where he plays the numerous keys of a pipe organ all at once. Granted, at 150 minutes, the epic movie does run too long for the story it tells, and the lumbering series of climaxes seems excessive. Regardless, it's still grand fun thanks to Depp and the oozing, barnacle-encrusted realism of the CGI effects.</p></br><a href="../users/A1OBJ2263JCK5.html">A1OBJ2263JCK5</a><br/><p>When I originally saw the first "Pirates of the Caribbean" movie in 2003, I had grave reservations that it would be any good. (It was based on a Disney theme park ride for goodness sakes!) But all my reservations were swept out to sea, when the film proved to be jolly good, popcorn munching, swashbuckling, summer movie, which featured a tight, entertaining script, excellent direction, an endearing cast and amazing special effects. Apparently about a zillion other people agreed, because it made gobs of money and a francise was born. It was inevitable a sequel would follow.<br /><br />That sequel turned out to be "Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest". Expectations were high between myself and my young, five year old son (an admitted pirate fanatic) going in. I personally was disapointed the first time I saw "Dead Man's Chest" in the theatre (Though my son loved it!). The film seemed very long, flabby and over wrought, hard to understand, with multiple, complicated plotlines, that were hard to follow. To say I was disapointed coming out of the theatre, would be an understatement.<br /><br />But then something odd happened along the way. I bought the DVD for my son and and starting watching it with him. And believe it or not this film turns out to play quite well on DVD! With  a few viewings (and the sub-title feature on) the mulitple complicated, plotlines became untangled and are in fact, quite interesting. To sit and explain it all would be mind-boggling, but in the end it involves control of the high seas, the search for lost love, rescue and redemption, and of course Captain Jack Sparrow, attempting to get his scallywag b*tt...once again, out of one heck of a fix.<br /><br />Once, I had begun re-watching this film on DVD, I started noticing the artistry, that had gone into this movie. Gore Verbinski's direction is still steady and sure. I love the beautiful opening showing Will Turner & Elizabeth Swann's wedding being interrupted. The images of the fine china in the rain..its' almost poetic in it's imagery.<br /><br />The cast is all still uniformly excellent. Johnny Depp contines to create a memorable screen icon out of Capt. Jack Sparrow, that is now part of movie history. Kudos, continue for Orlando Bloom as the heroic, Will Turner and Kiera Knightley as the beautiful & gutsy, Elisabeth Swann. New cast additions include Bill Nighy as the terrifying Davy Jones, a half-man, half sea creature. Even under tons of CGI affects and makeup, Nighy gives a wonderfully, expressive performance, that is filled with both villiany and pathos. Also, new is Stellan Skarsgard as Will Turner's mournfully cursed father, Bootstrap Bill. He gives a pivotal performance, that gives gravity to the film.<br /><br />The film also shines with its' beautiful cinematography, art direction, costumes, and set design. I was especially impressed with the amazing visual effects (2007 Academy Award winner for "Best Achievement in Visual Effects") that are throughout the movie. The film's horrific, sea monster known as 'the Kracken' is a sight to behold. It makes you wonder about how far movie special effects have come in the last twenty some years!<br /><br />While this movie dosn't exactly come up to being the sleek, thrill-ride, that the original is... it is still mighty impressive. It is the rare, interesting, sequel that actually takes some chances. This is the type of film, that the DVD format was just made for. With each succesive viewing you will find a new plot twist, a new nuance, that you never realized before. Give it a chance. It just might be the pirate booty your looking for!</p></br><a href="../users/A2PN7Z2VTHICL8.html">A2PN7Z2VTHICL8</a><br/><p>This second in the 'Pirates' series starts out with the arrest of Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swan (Keira Knightley) for previously aiding Captain Jack Sparrow (the fantastic Johnny Depp).  Will is released on the condition that he brings back Sparrow's compass.<br /><br />But the search isn't really for the compass, its for the key and the contents of the infamous 'Dead Man's Chest', which supposedly contains the still beating heart of legendary Captain Davy Jones, captain of The Flying Dutchman with its crew of dead, and rather intriguing, men.<br /><br />The Flying Dutchman's crew has long since molded themselves to the sea, one being a hammerhead shark, another being a hermit crab, and yet another molded into the boat itself.  Captain Davy Jones is a squid with crab claws, and the FX on these costumes is among the best.<br /><br />The race is on to find the key, and the chest, between three men who each want the heart for their own selfish purposes.  Will, Sparrow, and the disgraced Norrington.  Not to mention Captain Jones.  Will is in for a surprise when he's bargained to Jones by Sparrow, finding his father among the disfigured dead, trapped on Jones' crew for eternity.<br /><br />For a Disney film, 'Dead Man's Chest' is a little rough for the kiddies.  I certainly wouldn't want my little ones watching a crow peck out a man's eyeball or seeing some of the nightmarish creations of Jones' crew.  But as an adult, it's extremely entertaining.  The escape from the island is particularly hilarious.<br /><br />My only complaint with the movie is that a) it's a bit long and b) it's only a chapter.  The ending holds no resolution and is an obvious continuation to part three when it comes out.  Too many important plot factors are left up in the air.  Overall, its just as entertaining as 'Black Pearl' but with far better FX and a bit more jaunty action.  I consider this movie worthy of a purchase.  Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/AOXL514GEE4AA.html">AOXL514GEE4AA</a><br/><p>Captain Jack Sparrow is back and the action is twice as big. The adventure picks up with Capt. Jack in trouble again, this time with Davey Jones looking to collect a debt now due him. The plot thickens when Will Turner learns his father is a crew member aboard Jones' Flying Dutchmen and will do anything to free him of his service. All this and the East India Trading Company is hunting down not only pirates but the means to control the sea! This is probably the weakest of the 3 and it still gets 5 stars. Simply great fun!<br /><br />NOW FOR MY BLU-RAY THOUGHTS: Another EYE POPPING blu ray! The picture and sound are what blu-ray is suppossed to be! The special features are carried over from the dvd with blu-ray special features added. It's worth every penny. FINAL VERDICT: Walk the plank if you don't upgrade matey! ABSOLUTELY UPGRADE WORTHY!</p></br><a href="../users/A18IK6YI6T3RK2.html">A18IK6YI6T3RK2</a><br/><p>I swear these movies go nowhere, I mean on some level they are swashbuckling fun, but it gets old quick and this opus is almost three hours.  The screenplay is all over the place, I mean do you expect to find a voodoo priestess in the south pacific, it's like the writer was just like..why not?  I like everyone else, liked Depps Keith Richards impersonation in the first movie, but it's a one note trick, it's like ok we get it, you're doing Richards.  Frankly, im no fan of Bloom, he just does not responate, he gets lost when he is on screen with Depp or Knightly but I did like many of Sparrows crew, they were very funny at times.  The special effects were excellent, no doubt much money was spent on this film and you can help but be awed by it, but this is without question the weakest of the three movies; it's overlong and short on story, that sound contraditory I know, but there it is..enjoy.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MFNDNS1L7D16.html">A2MFNDNS1L7D16</a><br/><p>the Black Pearl. Too long & boring. It drags in a lot of spots.  If you're a big Johnny Depp fan you'll enjoy Capt. Jack Sparrow mincing around but that's about it. The rest of the cast walks through their parts. Hope the third installment picks up.</p></br><a href="../users/A220FJEQNGMSRN.html">A220FJEQNGMSRN</a><br/><p>The movie business is a law unto itself. After Polanski and Carolco both near bankrupted themselves on pirate pics, nobody expected the original Pirates of The Caribbean to do anything but sink with all hands, let alone be both entertaining and hugely successful, and a few years later nobody expected its vastly inferior sequel, Dead Man's Chest, to do even better business and become only the third film gross more than a billion dollars.<br /><br />It's not a bad film and offers a fair amount of enjoyment, but the script lacks the polish, wit and surprise of the original and the film feels like it was thrown together in far too much of a hurry to get the best out of the footage (the three-way swordfight sequence in particular never feels that they had enough time to get right in the cutting room). The special effects and Bill Nighy are good, but it feels like they never had a full script and were writing it from day to day. But the biggest problem for me is that whereas the original boasted perhaps Keira Knightley's only okay performance, she more than makes amends here by delivering a performance of such staggering incompetence that it's almost physically painful watching her scowl or over-enunciate her way through her scenes. Surprisingly average.</p></br><a href="../users/A345WVAVMMO6F0.html">A345WVAVMMO6F0</a><br/><p>i wasnt overly impressed by the first one, i liked this one even less, and i bet that by the time i get suckered into seeing the next one, ill like IT least of all.</p></br><a href="../users/A3RMAWK4ELOLRZ.html">A3RMAWK4ELOLRZ</a><br/><p>Johnny Depp is back as Captain Jack Sparrow.  When Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) is put in prison for whatever reason, it's up to Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) to get Jack's compass to give to whoever put Elizabeth in prison in order to set her free.  Jack also needs Will's help with finding a key that will open a special treasure chest.<br /><br />"Pirates 2" has non-stop action from beginning to end, and I was at the edge of my seat watching intently.  Meet the most disgusting-looking characters (sea phantoms), such as octopus-head (I forget his name in the movie - The Dutchman, I think!), and that other guy who had a head as a saw fish.<br /><br />I recommend watching Pirates to anyone who saw the first one.  It's long, but it's worth every minute.</p></br><a href="../users/ALG7QH2L5JL2L.html">ALG7QH2L5JL2L</a><br/><p>There appear to be numerous people who expected more of the same of what was in _Curse of the Black Pearl_ and complain that either they didn't get it, or else that what they got wasn't the part of what they expected. Which makes one wonder what they expected or had hoped for to begin with; and why they would be deluded enough to think that it was even possible to provide said elements. 'The same only different' is almost impossible to deliver. Every time it's been tried, it failed to excite, excepting neophobes. _Dead Man's Chest_ provides a nice combination of some of the expected, with a fairly good and sensible continuation of the story. Reminds me of Star Wars, episodes 4-6. Only this one is better. There you go: heresy!<br /><br />Seriously though: think of where PotC:CotBP ended. Sparrow gets away, but is likely to be pursued by Norrington across the seas. Jack has unfinished business with dark powers. Will and Elizabeth plan to marry. Pirates are about to be executed en masse, what with there being no anti-capital-punishment demonstrators handy. The East India Trading Company, an organization with a tainted history, and one of the precursors of modern multinationals, invades the Caribbean, piggy-backing its activities on the military colonial presence. The nasty monkey from PotC:CotBP steals a piece of gold and becomes immortal; but you had to watch through the end-credits to see that bit. Someone from the East India Company watches a DVD of PotC:CotBP, and so finds out about the Aztec treasure and that it is to be avoided at all cost.<br /><br />SPOILERS following, so be warned!<br /><br />What follows in this sequel is, as far as one can expect this in a silly fantasy flick, a view at the possible consequences. Norrington fails to find Jack and becomes a drunk eager to get back into the good graces of the powers-that-be; revealing dark streaks to his nature. Dark elements also surface in Elizabeth, who has always been a bit attracted to Jack and he to her, and who uses this for an act that she eventually probably regrets; something so ultimately pragmatic and survival oriented that I couldn't believe it at first. Will tries to be noble, but finds it extremely difficult, even though he's far more naive than his fiancee. Confronted with his father, he is pushed to places he might not otherwise have gone.<br /><br />The darknesses found in the characters reveals depth, as darkness always does, and makes them very much more interesting and three-dimensional. As a result the movie bears about the same relationship to the original that The Empire Strikes Back had to the original Star Wars. In many ways it works better, because one has the feeling that the writers aren't going for some grand deep-and-meaningful cosmic salvage plan, and are also avoiding thoroughly annoying elements like those pesky and tedious Ewoks. There is very little 'cute' factor in Dead Man's Chest; some pretty horrific stuff, implied and off-camera, but potentially disturbing for children; nice gross creatures; lots of "har har"; evil multinationals represented by psychopaths; great visuals and lots of noise; more twists and turns that you can shake a stick at, which a lot of people found confusing, but who cares about them; lots of shtick; and a Johnny Depp, who treads a fine line between being funny and becoming annoying, so much so that I almost hope we won't see much of him in the final instalment, but focus on the interesting people in the mix: those less concerned with parodying themselves.<br /><br />Despite Depp it was thoroughly enjoyable, and I have no problems with the lack of denouement. We lived through LotR, did we not? Except, of course, that there we knew the outcome...<br /><br />Till Noever, owlglass.com</p></br><a href="../users/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD.html">A3PPXVR5J6U2JD</a><br/><p>The first Pirates of the Caribbean movie, Curse of the Black Pearl, was a surprise hit. A movie based on a theme park?  Come on! For evidence of just how hard it is to sell such a film, one need only look at the broken and battered body of The Haunted Mansion.<br /><br />But none of that matters, because my wife is an avid fan of Johnny Depp, so we were going to see it, flop or not (see my review of The Astronaut's Wife for the suffering I'm willing to endure).  In the first movie, Captain Jack Sparrow (Depp) swashed and swished his way through a madcap pirate adventure involving stolen Aztec gold.  In the process, he united, then separated, then united Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley).  Somewhere in there was a snooty British bad guy named Norrington (Jack Davenport), Elizabeth's father and governor Weatherby Swann (Jonathan Pryce), a bumbling fat and skinny duo known as Pintel (Lee Arenberg) and Ragetti (Mackenzie Crook) and last but certainly not least, the superb Geoffrey Rush as Barbarossa. If that sounds confusing, it is, but we didn't mind. The movie was fast-paced, hardly linear, and hummed along mostly on the strength of Depp and Rush, who I could just watch chew scenery all day.<br /><br />I didn't think it was possible, but Dead Man's Chest actually retains ALL of those characters and then adds a few more.  Amongst the additional protagonists is Davy Jones himself (Bill Nighy), a half-octopoid Cthulhu-esue monstrosity who mans (err, squids?) a ship of equally motley half-human, half-aquatic aberrations.  Manipulating piratical events is the new snooty British villain, Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander).  Doesn't that name ooze bad guyishness?<br /><br />The plot is so convoluted that I can't possibly cover it all here.  Suffice it to say that there are several deus ex machinas, including a compass that points to whatever its holder wants most and a voodoo priestess (Tia Dalma, played by Naomie Harris) who provides information whenever our gang of adventurers gets lost.<br /><br />Ironically, I happen to be playing a Dungeons & Dragons campaign that's a lot like this one.  Using the Freeport campaign setting, Cthulhu and pirates have never gone better together.  So it's a strange bit of cultural zeitgeist that the most popular pirate movie (and, at this point, the best box office opening of a movie ever) happens to mix the two different genres as well.<br /><br />For the uninitiated, Cthulhu is an H.P. Lovecraft creation that involves slow dread and tentacled, awful things from Beyond. Not only is Davy Jones an octopus, he also commands a terrible beast known as the Kraken. This whirling mass of tentacles and teeth can rend ships in two.<br /><br />Improbable fights happen along the way that vary from ridiculously silly (stop fighting and just GET OFF THE WATERWHEEL!) to hilarious slapstick (Sparrow does an inspired homage to Chaplin while tied to a bamboo spit). The monstrous crew squishes and oozes their way on screen.  And somewhere in the middle of the madness, Sparrow gets darker, meaner, and a little less lovable as a character.  Of course, he's in the middle of a spiritual journey of sorts (as is his female counterpart, Elizabeth) and we expect good `ole Jack to eventually come full circle by the end of the film.<br /><br />But that's not what happens.  Just when I was at a point where I wondered how the film was going to wrap up and thereby release my bladder from its torment of the 150-minute run-time, the film ended abruptly.  And I mean you're-driving-along-and-OHMYGODLOOKOUTFORTHATWALL! abruptly.<br /><br />I couldn't help feel a little cheated.  While I understand that the film is the middle of a trilogy, even Lord of the Rings did a better job of giving some form of closure to the second part.  It's like the producers ran out of time, and just cut the film when it hit 150 minutes.<br /><br />This second installment of Pirates of the Caribbean needed some serious editing.  It feels rushed.  For example, Davy Jones and his crew are a CGI-marvel, but they're a little less enthralling in full daylight, and certainly far too much of a distraction to actually focus on their dialogue. There are too many characters: we don't need Norrington at all and we certainly didn't need the comic relief of Pintel and Ragetti. Although I must admit that retaining the "undead monkey" was an inspired choice.<br /><br />Why did Pirates do so well?  I suspect it's due to the fact that pirates are hot right now, the sex appeal of the cast, and the combined star wattage of three actors who are now much more famous than when they started the series.<br /><br />Pirates of the Caribbean is fun, but fun in a not quite mature, making funny faces kind of way.  It could have been better, and it leaves nothing resolved; sorry guys, but I don't consider fighting the Kraken to be an actual plot resolution. The third movie better be fantastic to make up for it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AKPY4LXIC24O.html">A3AKPY4LXIC24O</a><br/><p>Hollywood these days seems to work along the lines of monkeys in a room with typewriters producing Shakespeare.  Eventually something truly great, exciting, and visually rewarding emerges and everyone rejoices.  The first Pirates of the Caribbean film seemed like one such instance of cinematic brilliance, an amazing and unexpected movie that reminded people that big studios can consciously make good flicks.<br /><br />However, when I heard that two more Pirates films were in the works, I winced with expectant misery of being subjected to a rushed and unfullfilling trilogy.  Would the care (and necessary budget) be applied to these films?  Happily, if Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is any indication, this series should end up being the most amazing and entertaining movie series of the decade.<br /><br />Why should folks go see this movie?  Three words:  Captain Jack Sparrow.  Johnny Depp's reprisal of the equillibrium challenged pirate should (if there's any justice in the world) lead to a second Academy Award nomination for the same character.  Jack Sparrow is quickly becoming the new James Bond, in terms of name recognition.  The difference is NO ONE ELSE could play Jack Sparrow, so (hopefully) this series shouldn't be driven into the ground like 007.<br /><br />I've been saying the word series alot in this review and there is a reason for that.  Amongst the enormous pile of things the film makers got right, with the first two movies, is the presentation.  Folks, a long time ago people would watch serials in their theaters before the feature presentation.  Ongoing stories that kept people coming back to the movies.  Pirates of the Caribbean is a feature length serial, with all the action, drama, mystery, humor, and this time around, horror that any movie fan could want.<br /><br />What else was done right?  How about the special effects.  Obviously this is a movie about pirates but there be monsters here as well.  In fact, there's a whole pirate crew of damned souls in servitude to Davy Jones, all of which have characteristics of some sea going creature.  Davy Jones himself (played vividly and unforgettably by Bill Nighy) bears an unmistakable resemblance to an octopi, complete with flowing, squirming, and tentacled locks.  The SFX are both gross and gorgeous, any worries about topping the moonlight skeletons from Curse of the Black Pearl should be keelhauled immediately.<br /><br />But wait, there's more.  This movie has some of the most entertaining action sequences in any film I've ever seen.  Gore Verbinski should be the new go-to guy for action in Hollywood.<br /><br />Keira Knightley really vamps it up this go around, clearly she's grown with her character (even if she's more on the sidelines this time).  Sexy, thy name is Keira.<br /><br />No cracks about the Kraaken.  The mythical beasty makes several sizeable appearances with many loving nods, er, tentacle wags toward Ray Harryhausen.  The Kraaken is one gigantic, angry, and hungry sea monster that adds to the rewatchability factor at least ten fold.<br /><br />A word of caution to parents who might want to bring their little ones to see this.  First, it's almost three hours long.  Second, it pushes the limits of the pg-13 rating.  This movie might be too intense for the kids.  Aww, who am I kidding.  Pirates of the Caribbean is a movie worth letting your children have nightmares over.  They'll thank you when they're older.<br /><br />If you're looking for rip roaring fun at the movies this summer Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is the film to see.  100% Buckle Swash Guarantee.<br /><br />P.S. In the immortal words of Captain Jack Sparrow "You Smell Funny".</p></br><a href="../users/A2BPDFR58H9575.html">A2BPDFR58H9575</a><br/><p>I probably would've liked it even more if it were 20-30 minutes shorter in the middle but as it is - great fun. Jack is back and he is magnificent -drunk most of the time, his morals as unstable as his walk, lying, seducing, running, hanging by his leg on the rope, and always irresistible. Depp's Capt. Sparrow is the reason to see the movie but there is so much more. The movie's last hour is simply awesome and the way its creators prepared us for the third film is very clever. I am happy that one of my favorite characters from the first movie made the appearance and will be the part of this trilogy (?) final(?) chapter. The film is exiting, has stunning special effects and I was sure that the make up artists would be nominated for all possible awards in the end of the year (they deserved them all). Well, I was wrong about make up artists but the movie has recieved the nominations for Best Achievement in Art Direction, Best Achievement in Sound and Sound Editing, and Best Achievement in Visual Effects and it is very fair. I will not mention the plot - it is there but it's not that important after all. The film is a rare case of equal opportunity entertainment and enjoyment - for the young children, their parents, cynical teenagers, sophisticated intellectuals, rednecks - for everybody and their uncle Max.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>Yo ho, yo ho, a pirate's life for me.<br /><br />As I watched the new sequel, "Pirates of the Carribean: Dead Man's Chest", I felt transported back to the Black Pearl, as the dulcet tones of the crew singing a shanty enveloped me like a sea mist...<br /><br />Yo ho, yo ho, a pirate's life for me...<br /><br />Avast ye maties. Thar be a rip roaring adventure out there for all to enjoy. The sequel to the enormously popular film based on a ride at the Disney theme parks. "Dead Man's Chest" be one of those rare things, more precious than a Black Pearl, it be a sequel that works well. So far, "Dead Men's Chest" is the most enjoyable big studio release of the summer.<br /><br />We pillage, we plunder, we rifle, we loot...<br /><br />Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) watches as rain pours down, destroying the area where her wedding was to take place. Soon, Lord Beckett (Tom Hollander), a leader of the East India Trading Company, arrives to arrest Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth, forcing the wedding to be cancelled indefinitely. But he doesn't really want either of them, he wants Captain Jack Sparrow's (Johnny Depp) compass, which can lead people to the location of what they most desire. But Sparrow has problems of his own. Regaining control of the Black Pearl, he soon realizes he has the Black Mark and must repay his debt to Davy Jones (Bill Nighy), the Captain of the Flying Dutchman, a creepy ship with a crew of Pirates who have died and pledged their allegiance to the half-man, half crustacean leader of the deep. If Sparrow is unable to repay the debt, Jones will release a terrible beast called the Kracken to reclaim the Black Pearl to the sea. But Sparrow is on a quest of his own, he wants to find a key; the key will open a buried chest containing the most prized possession of Davy Jones. Soon, all three are back together, fighting against one another and for the same cause.<br /><br />Drink up, me `earties, yo ho...<br /><br />One of the great pleasures of "Pirates of the Carribean" is Johnny Depps very eccentric performance. As Captain Jack Sparrow, he flounces around, channeling the spirit of Keith Richards into a boozy, effeminate ne'er do well who always manages to keep one step ahead of the authorities, enemies and death.<br /><br />We kidnap and ravage and don't give a hoot...<br /><br />Depp always provides an interesting performance, even when the film is less than spectacular. "Pirates" Sparrow seems to be the perfect combination for this esoteric actor's charms. Let's face it. Sparrow is an over the top character; a pirate who walks in a vapor of rum fumes, his dirty dreadlocks and bad teeth shining like beacons as he slurs his words. This pirate provides the actor with the perfect avenue for his abilities. In lesser hands, the character would be a disaster. But Depp embraces the role, kidnapping our better judgment, ravaging us with the persona. And he doesn't give a hoot.<br /><br />I have no doubt the character will be remembered for a long time.<br /><br />Drink up me `earties, yo ho...<br /><br />A key part of Depp's performance is Sparrow's constant influx of booze. In "Dead Man's Chest", he spends a significant amount of time worrying about his store of rum.<br /><br />Yo ho, yo ho, a pirate's life for me...<br /><br />Part of the reason for the success of this sequel is the return of the entire cast and key members of the crew. Depp, Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightley, Jack Davenport (British TV's "Coupling"), MacKenzie Crook (British TV's "The Office") and more. All of the actors from the first have returned, which is a bit of a spoiler. Think about it. Think about it. This means the sequel has a higher chance of being consistent with the first. In fact, they filmed both "Dead Man's Chest" and "Pirates 3" at the same time, ensuring even more consistency.<br /><br />But consistency can be bad. In some cases, this works. In others, it doesn't. Because the first film was so enjoyable, chances are the sequel would follow in the correct footsteps. Naturally, there are no guarantees. Look at "The Matrix" trilogy for how wrong this can go. First film, brilliant. Second film, good. Third film, a disaster. "The Lord of the Rings" trilogy was made as one large movie, with the cast and crew working consistently for years, and director Peter Jackson created a trilogy that will be remembered for ever.<br /><br />So far, we have a great first entry and a very enjoyable, amusing second.<br /><br />We extort, we pilfer, we filch and we sack...<br /><br />The biggest drawback to "Dead Man's Chest" is the lack of surprise in the performances. Much of the fun of the first film was watching Depp's great performance as he revealed more and more nuances. The performance is amusing and fun, but it doesn't surprise us.<br /><br />Unfortunately, bringing all of the characters back means Orlando Bloom returns as well. Bloom is good looking, I get it. But he is also one of the most boring actors to ever grace the silver screen. His stock and trade seems to be one facial expression, determined, his mouth, his eyes, nothing ever changes, no matter what the situation. His only concession to creating a character seems to be responding to others when they call his character's name. "Will?" "Yes."<br /><br />Drink up, me `earties, yo ho.<br /><br />The main addition to the cast is Bill Nighy who plays Davy Jones. You may not recognize the name, but I can guarantee you have probably seen him in some British film or other. He generally plays eccentric, older men, like the aging rocker in "Love, Actually". In "Dead Man's Chest", he has so much make up on, you would never recognize his face.<br /><br />As Davy Jones, he plays the Pirate of folklore who lives at the bottom of the sea. The filmmakers have created a very unique visual look for Jones and his crew; because the pirates are living in the sea, they have begun to assimilate various fish and other sea creatures into their bodies. Jones is part octopus, barnacles, crab and lobster with a whole host of other creepy crawlies crawling out of every orifice. It is a great look and helps to make the legend believable.<br /><br />Jones's ship, the Flying Dutchman is equally impressive. Covered with barnacles and living creatures, the sails are covered with eels, it has the ability to submerge and reappear above water at will.<br /><br />Maraud and embezzle, and even high-jack...<br /><br />I always find it a little easier to lose myself in a fantasy if there is at least a little basis in reality. In "Dead Man's Chest", the new `villain' in the film appears in the form of Beckett (Tom Hollander), the officer of the East India Trading Company. This company is so powerful and sponsored by the British Government, they are quickly taking over every port in the Carribean, extending their reach and their influence, running the pirates out of business. Actually, they are simply legalizing piracy, making it their own, and taking control of it.<br /><br />Beckett wants a compass in the possession of Sparrow and he needs Will to get it for him. This is the start of the adventure and ultimately will bring the three main characters back together.<br /><br />Drink up me `earties, yo ho...<br /><br />The other major addition to the cast is Stellan Skarsgard who plays Bootstrap Bill, Will's (Bloom) father. A pirate, he has made a deal with Jones and now serves as one of his crew. Throughout the film, we see his transformation, as barnacles and other sea creatures slowly attach to him, making him one of Jone's crew for the rest of eternity.<br /><br />Yo ho, yo ho, a pirate's life for me...<br /><br />The film is simply beautiful to look at. Using some spectacularly beautiful locations in the Carribean, the film seems to shimmer with color. As the action moves to a port, or to a shack in a swamp, the crew is clearly modeling the look after the popular ride, and fans of the ride will love the references, but the attention to detail is superb.<br /><br />We kindle and char, inflame and ignite...<br /><br />There are a couple of spectacular action sequences. The first is a lengthy bit involving circular cages made of bones. All of Sparrow's men and Turner are captured by a band of natives and imprisoned in two balls hanging over a gorge. Their method of escape is truly interesting, unusual and fun.<br /><br />But the real standout is a lengthy duel between Sparrow, Turner and Norrington. I know you have probably seen duels before, but this is a standout sequence. During a chase through the countryside, they end up in a broken down mill. Soon, the action shifts to the old water wheel on the outside. The three men end up on the wheel and it breaks off the structure, rolling down the hillside, with all three inside. As it moves, the three men end up in various fighting positions; imagine three hamsters in an exercise wheel, but fighting one another.<br /><br />Drink up, me `earties, yo ho.<br /><br />"Dead Man's Chest" isn't a perfect film. In addition to Orlando Bloom, the film is about 15 minutes too long and it simply stops, not really ending, providing a starting point for the third installment. This give "Dead Man's Chest" an incomplete feeling.<br /><br />These minor quibbles aside, "Dead Man's Chest" is a rousing adventure which will provide a lot of fun for everyone. Drink up, me `earties, yo ho.</p></br><a href="../users/A1K31NF81TS0CO.html">A1K31NF81TS0CO</a><br/><p>I heard this one is fantastic.  While I never see movies in the movie theater, except very rarely, I willl definitly plan to watch this on DVD.  It really rocks the house!<br /><br />I highly recommend getting this on DVD, immediately at launch!<br /><br />EDIT June 5, 2007:<br />Well, how quickly the tides have turned.  This movie franchise was the "golden child" it's first go around, getting loads and loads of awesome support and reviews.  Now look at it.  Just fresh from it's third run from the theater, and getting scathing reviews, movie goers complaining that it's "too long and draggy," plot-less, poor writing, etc. etc. etc."  Well, I viewed this 2nd movie, the first sequel the week it came out on DVD.  And I couldn't stay in my seat.  It was that bad.<br /><br />Boooooring snoozefest.<br /><br />Not recommended!<br /><br />MC White<br /><br />MC White: Said check it out!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A27FR2C67JPDRS.html">A27FR2C67JPDRS</a><br/><p>Cap'n Jack Sparrow is back, with his crew of sea-loving thugs, including Will Turner and the lovely Elizabeth Swann in this sequel to the smash hit "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl".  I, like everyone else who enjoyed the first film, have been looking forward to the return of the wickedly funny pirate captain and the swashbuckling adventures that won us over a few years ago.  Though I didn't hate this film, I have to admit I was disappointed with this second feature.  While the first was fresh and charming, this sequel seems to rely too heavily on the special effects (which are quite good, I won't deny!) and a rather weak story that left me wishing they had taken a little more time and invested in a plot that really pulled me into the movie.<br /><br />Johnny Depp is good, as usual, as Captain Jack but Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightly, with all their glowing beauty in tact, just don't achieve their character's charisma the second time around.  Davy Jones is an interesting villain and an amazing CGI creation but he just doesn't pack the punch of Geoffery Rush's Captain Barbossa.  Davy Jones' cronies are interesting CGI creations as well, not to mention the Kraken, that feared "beasty" with tenacles that can drag an entire ship into the murky depths.  Visually, the film is stunning and the cinematography is beautiful but pretty pictures does not a great film make!<br /><br />Thankfully, this film is a bridge to the final movie in the triology, "Pirates of the Caribbean:  At World's End".  The ending definitely leaves the door open for the beginning of the third with a very welcome surprise appearance.  With the confirmed appearance of Keith Richards as Jack's father and the faith I have in Gore Verbinski and Johnny Depp, I believe we will see a better movie than this next year in May.  If you are a fan of Johnny Depp and the original film, you will still want to see this film on the big screen.  However, one trip to the theater is enough for this one.  The original I saw a couple of times on the big screen.  While Pirates has done gangbusters at the box office this weekend (an estimated 132 million, breaking all records) you would do better to see "Superman Returns" or "The Devil Wears Prada", both better movies than this one.  Recommended if you have nothing better to do on a Sunday afternoon!</p></br><a href="../users/AZCDCO6KK2T81.html">AZCDCO6KK2T81</a><br/><p>As I said in Pirates 1, there isn't much one can add to the discussion of these Pirate films at this point and with not having reviewed them before and after a weekend of watching Pirates 1 and 2 in anticipation of 3 next week, I thought it time to write up something on this sequel.<br /><br />I sincerely doubted that the team that gave us Pirates 1 could possibly top themselves with Pirates 2, but it appears that if they didn't top themselves, they at least succeeded with a film that, for the most part, is as equally good and entertaining as the first.  Oh, how rare that is in "sequelville."<br /><br />Everything I thought was great about the first is present in the second, except that this film is a bit less original, but still enormously clever.  It does what a sequel should do in that it gives us more of what we liked in the original film, has the storyline continue in some digestible manner and not just rehash the previous film, and has our characters not only be as familar as they were in the first film, but grow in the sequel as well.  Pirates 2 does all this and with great gusto and skill.  The special effects are different rather than better, but they are just as enjoyable and don't detract from the story or attempt to make up for poor writing. Gore Verbinski, the director, continues to captain this fleet of films with confidence and clear direction.  Hans Zimmer's music which although repetitive in this film is very welcomed as it really helps to define the Pirate films.  It's one of the best scores to a series of films since Indiana Jones.  Lastly, you have to love how this team found another great entrance for Depp.  I thought the first was the best I had ever since for a leading man and this one has to be the second.  Kudos to the writers for their cleverness and creativity there!<br /><br />Lightning can strike twice and boy I'm praying that it can three times.  I have never looked this forward to sequels before and I doubt I ever will again.  I'm good for more sequels and even prequels from this team.</p></br><a href="../users/A2582KMXLK2P06.html">A2582KMXLK2P06</a><br/><p>I was never a fan of these Pirates of the Caribbean movies.  I mean, they have plenty of exciting and distinct scenes that make the movies stand apart from other pirate films, but trying to follow along to any kind of plot is a very difficult thing to do.  What was going on throughout the movie?  Why were certain fight scenes happening?  What were those giant worms that were popping out of the water and attacking the ship?  I guess the overall weirdness is supposed to be unique to the viewers, and the reason the series caught the attention of millions, but, I don't know.  I'd just like to know what was going on.<br /><br />Also, I'm not a fan of the way the movie comes off like I'm watching a play.  Seriously, it's like the whole time I was sitting in the audience watching Johnny Depp do his typical weird pirate mannerisms on a giant stage.  That's kind of a turn off.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>'Pirates Of The Caribbean - Dead Man's Chest' is but the second installment (the third has already been shot) in the series of movies based on a Disneyland ride: strange nidus for a story idea and one that takes a bit of patience to sit through, but a fun evening nevertheless.  Though the first installment took the audience by surprise with the character of Jack Sparrow so inimitably portrayed by the gifted Johnny Depp and therefore served as a tastier treat, this second installment substitutes sea-dead cum barnacles for the dancing skeletons of the first and is a bit more grisly...and a lot less fun.<br /><br />But Gore Verbinski knows how to choreograph these outings and he is able to marry some very fine special effects to the genuinely good cast of characters and the result is a fantasy that is a visual delight.  The cast  includes Depp, Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightley, Jack Davenport, Bill Nighy who is completely covered in tentacles as Davy Jones, Jonathan Pryce, Tom Hollander, Stellan Skarsg?rd,and Naomie Harris and they all seem to be having a glorious time.  It is a bit long for a slight story (well in excess of two hours) and the special effects of the kraken (octopus like tentacles) overwhelming boats becomes tedious, but it is a fun outing and it all too blatantly sets us up for part three due our next spring.

Can he find the Dead Man's chest? Watch this movie and find out, well worth buying the DVD (either edition single or double disc).

I saw it at a matinee showing last weekend.<br /><br />I have to say, I was somewhat disappointed, in comparison to the original. It was difficult to put my finger on why, exactly...at least at first. In the past week, here's what I've noted.<br /><br />I enjoyed the supporting cast's performances more than that of the three primary stars....with one notable exception. I was happy to see Jack Davenport (of Coupling fame) put in a great performance as Norrington. The actors playing the pirates put in great comedic and supporting efforts. Bill Nighy continues to impress me; in this case, he's able to put emotion on the screen through all of that costuming, by his voice alone.<br /><br />Tom Hollander, who plays the villian Beckett, was the lone supporting cast who didn't really pull through here. You just know that a good smack to the head, and he'd just cave...which is not how he's really intended to portray the character.<br /><br />Orlando Bloom...either he's playing woodenly, or his character is written one-dimensionally, or both. I know if my love were threatened, I'd act with a little more depth of emotion than Bloom brings to the screen here.<br /><br />Keira's one of the saving graces...not just because she's easy on the eyes, but because she can portray emotion, and emotional changes, and because she sells her character as a match in wits against Jack Sparrow.<br /><br />And then there's Johnny...a great job, right up until his last scene.<br /><br />So, this brings us to the plot. It's too linear. The first film in this trilogy had a complex storyline, because the A story and the B story were given equal weight. Here, there's almost no weight put upon the B story. And, there are no real twists, at least not until the very end.<br /><br />I'd recommend the movie...it's light summer fare, great for the kids and to beat the heat. But, it's not as hefty as the original, so be prepared.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D3XQC2DIT.html">A1D3XQC2DIT</a><br/><p>I was entertained. That said, there was a lot that was left to be desired from this film. I would not try to dissuade anyone from seeing this movie, but I would add the simple advisement that this falls under the sweeping generalization that the sequel is almost never as good as the original.<br /><br />It always amazes me when a sequel falls short, not just of the expectations of greatness after such a good original film (Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl), but of the level of the first film. I figure they should at least be able to make it as good as the first, if not better.<br /><br />"Black Pearl" was so visually awe-inspiring. The moon-light effects, which should have earned the film an Oscar if not for the Lord of the Rings conspiracy, were vastly superior to the effects in "2." The effects in "2" were basically limited to Davy Jones's crew and those scenes were too dark to appreciate the level of detail. It was as if the mentality was to steal a character from Star Wars, call him Davy Jones and spend all of the time and money making him look real, which they did. It was just not enough to impress me.<br /><br />What worked in "Black Pearl"?<br /><br />Johnny Depp was flawless as the charismatic, smooth-talking Pirate Captain Jack Sparrow.<br /><br />What was changed in "2"?<br /><br />Depp was still flawless, but he had much less camera time. He did not have many, if any, chances to talk himself out of anything or others into anything. His logic, though perfect in his own eyes, is a little skewed. This leads to confusion in other characters, and laughs for the audience.<br /><br />They also added too many sweeping panoramic views. Yes, you are filming the Caribbean, we know. And yes, we would all like to go there someday. It is some of the most blatant product placement I have ever seen. I just hope the Caribbean tourism authority paid a pretty penny for those scenes.<br /><br />The movie was 2.5 hours long and in that time, officially, nothing happens. The story goes nowhere. There were many things built in to simply make the movie drag on and on without progressing the plot. Davy Jones grants Captain Jack 3 days to get him 100 souls in exchange for his own, why? So Jack can actually provide him with 100 souls? No, just to add a few extra scenes that are completely inconsequential to the plot, though they make the movie longer. What about the sword fight scene on the mill's water wheel? Did it look cool? Sure, it looked cool. But did it need to go for so long? No, it did not. The fight between Norrington and Will Turner has absolutely nothing to do with the storyline, yet we must endure a drawn-out fencing sequence between them.<br /><br />I understand the lack of closure from the standpoint that "2" and "3" are two parts of the same movie, but I think they left a few too many loose ends. Wait, another comparison to Lord of the Rings? I think they are leaving too much for the third and final installment. There will just be too much to cover. What is the main plot in "3" going to be? Is it to help Jack? Or is it to still rid the sea of Davy Jones? And what about that annoying little British fellow? I'm sure he'll have a hand in the last movie as well...<br /><br />I know I did not take it easy on the movie and you may be having a hard time believing that it is actually worth seeing, but like I said it is entertaining. Especially if you have a longer attention span than I.<br /><br />Oh, did I forget to mention how absolutely amazing Keira Knightley looked? Weird. KeiraJokr. It has a nice ring to it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1I7QGUDP043DG.html">A1I7QGUDP043DG</a><br/><p>I'm always in awe of Johnny Depp's love of acting and his dedication to the roles he plays, especially when his character is the pirate Jack Sparrow. I wonder if playing pirate was a boyhood dream, for he gets into it so very well. This sequel is a smooth transition in keeping with the lineal plot of the first film while creating vivid, new characters to spin off on their own. The result is the fresh fringe of fantasy that Disney does so well. I especially love the bizarre sea creatures/sailors that serve the dead Davey Jones, captain of the ghost ship, the 'Flying Dutchman'. Though the end is clearly devised to set us up for another sequel (a trick that makes some viewers go 'Arrgg!'), the tension and absorbing sword fight scenes will satisfy action film seekers, and especially pirate fans, of all ages!<br /><br />Chrissy K.

This sequel starts off with a bang and gives back all our favorite characters, but goes downhill from there. There are too many subplots and too many loose ends that are never tied up. The movie gives us plenty of dazzling swordfights - but they're dragged out for too long, and improbability is only entertaining for awhile before it becomes simply absurd.

I want to preface this review by stating that I absolutely ADORED the first "Pirates of the Caribbean" film, and I've been anticipating the sequel for years. Now that I've seen it, I almost wish it hadn't been made at all. It was such a letdown!<br /><br />I think the biggest problem with "Dead Man's Chest" is that the plot is incredibly confusing and difficult to follow. There's just too much going on at once. Things get off to a rocky start right from the beginning: at first I thought the opening scene was just a dream sequence or something, but then I realized that it was ACTUALLY HAPPENING. Basically, the movie begins by showing Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) crying in the rain on her wedding day. It seems that her fiance Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) has been arrested by a newly appointed official of the British government, Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander), for helping the pirate Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) escape. Elizabeth soon finds herself under arrest as well, and Beckett threatens to hang her and Will unless they agree to coerce Jack into stealing the key to Davy Jones' locker.<br /><br />While all this is going on, Jack and his crew are busy manning the Black Pearl. Jack is stunned to discover that Will's father, the legendary pirate Bootstrap Bill (Stellan Skarsgard) is still alive. Bootstrap reveals that Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) is looking for Jack in order to resolve an old debt. Unfortunately for Jack, Davy Jones is basically an undead sea creature/pirate. Yes, that's right: remember how in the last movie Jack was running from a haunted pirate ship that was manned by a crew that turned into skeletons in the moonlight? Well, this time Jack is running from SEA MONSTER PIRATES! I wish I was making this up, but I'm not. Basically, it's "SpongeBob SquarePants" meets "Night of the Living Dead." The costumes and special effects are impressive, but the sea monster pirates are extremely creepy, and not in a good way. Why do the bad guys all have starfish and coral growing out of their faces?! It's so wrong! And if that's not bad enough, Davy Jones commands a giant sea dragon to do his bidding. The sea dragon (basically a Loch Ness Monster/giant squid combo) attacks unsuspecting ships and pulls them to the bottom of the ocean.<br /><br />Are you confused yet? You should be...and I haven't even explained half of the plot yet! I'm not even going to try. I left out a bunch of other random stuff, like the Pygmy tribe that thinks Jack Sparrow is a reincarnated god, the crazy voodoo witch doctor who I couldn't even understand half of the time, and Elizabeth's makeout session with Jack...yes, with Jack! (That last part was pretty funny, though.)<br /><br />The bottom line is, this movie just doesn't flow very well. It's too confusing and I really didn't understand the whole sea monster theme that they have going. There are some good things about the film: the costumes and special effects are amazing and all of the actors delivered outstanding performances, especially Depp. However, the script really sucks, which is such a shame. The jokes weren't all that funny and the storyline was just plain ridiculous at times. I liked the way Commodore Norrington (Jack Davenport) was worked into the story so well, but even that was ruined for me at the end of the movie. There was hardly any swordfighting in "Dead Man's Chest," and then Jack, Will, and Norrington finally started going at it, but then they jumped on that huge wheel and started rolling around the island and I just couldn't take it anymore. Sigh.<br /><br />Here's how the movie ends: Captain Jack Sparrow is swallowed by the giant squid creature. No, I am not making that up...I wish I was! Jack gets swallowed up and we have to wait until the third "Pirates" movie to see what happens to him. "Dead Man's Chest" was really part one of two...it ends with a big cliffhanger. The one redeeming bit of news at the end is that we learn Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) is still alive and will be prominently featured in the next "Pirates" film. (I have no idea how they're going to explain that, since he seemed pretty dead at the end of "The Curse of the Black Pearl," but I guess anything is possible. It almost seems like Barbossa is going to HELP Will and Elizabeth save Jack, which makes absolutely no sense to me at all. Barbossa is supposed to be a VILLAIN! Bill Nighy was fine as Davy Jones/Octopus Man, but another reason "Dead Man's Chest" came up short is because Barbossa wasn't in it.)<br /><br />If you were a fan of the first "Pirates" movie, I'm sure you'll want to see "Dead Man's Chest." Prepare to be disappointed like I was. The movie just didn't do it for me. (It's make a heck of a lot of money at the box office, though, mark my words!)</p></br><a href="../users/A355WMP0CQBJFX.html">A355WMP0CQBJFX</a><br/><p>great movie! it has pirates, monsters, wierdos, and a lot of laughs. depp is a great actor this one is just at the top of his list. his role is perfect and kiera is a beaut. lovely actress and does justice for all women. davy jones a great villan, love him too, especially his speech. unforgettable. all the friends and pirates from part 1 reunite to break hell all over the seas once again. this time on a mission to retrieve the heart of davy jones because the one who does will command him and his army. they are on a quest, and battle once again against everyone even each other. except this time we have the mighty cracken to go against. it's funny gots tons of fighting scenes, and as long as johnny depp is involved you know you're in for a treat. from start to finish you it's exciting and a great big adventure. a must see!!</p></br><a href="../users/A141HP4LYPWMSR.html">A141HP4LYPWMSR</a><br/><p>`Pirates of the Caribbean - Dead Man's Chest' released on `06 is the highly anticipated second installment of the Captain Jack Sparrow trilogy. While Captain Jack and the film doesn't retain the humor and lighthearted charm of the first film, it does compensate for the loss of innocence with a dark, haunting Lovecraftian vision and some of the most amazing special effects to date. Wait till you see the Kraaken.<br /><br />Make no mistake `Dead Man's Chest' does have some flaws. It doesn't quite hold your attention as well as the first, there are some undeniable slow sections and the film is a little too long overall. However it still contains lots of witty lines of dialogue from your favorite pirate and a surprising number of unexpected twists in the plots. The ending is absolutely perfect leaving you breathless for installment three. Ah that Disney really knows how to do it, don't they. Not as good as the first film, but it doesn't miss by much.</p></br><a href="../users/A4F8CJ1L4348V.html">A4F8CJ1L4348V</a><br/><p>I liked this movie just as much as I did the first one.

This is a little bit better than "The Curse Of The Black Pearl" (2003). Johnny Depp is back and excellent as Captain Jack Sparrow, the role that garnered him an Oscar nomination! Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley as back as well as Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann. Gore Verbinski's (he also directed "Curse Of The Black Pearl") directing is excellent! The story & screenplay by Ted Elliott & Terry Rossio (both who wrote "Curse Of The Black Pearl"), and also based on characters created by Elliott, Rossio, Stuart Beattie & Jay Wolpert, is excellent! The music by Hans Zimmer (who also did the music to "The Da Vinci Code" (2006) & was a music programmer, score & soundtrack producer to "Curse Of The Black Pearl") is excellent! The cinematography by Dariusz Wolski (who also did the cinematography to "Curse Of The Black Pearl" (2003) is excellent. The film editing by Stephen E. Rivkin & Craig Wood (both who did the film editing to "Curse Of The Black Pearl" (2003) is excellent. The casting by Denise Chamian & Priscilla John is excellent. The production design by Rick Heinrichs (who won the Oscar for his work on "Sleepy Hollow" (1999) & and was also a set designer on "Edward Scissorhands" (1990), both which were directed by Tim Burton and starred Depp) is excellent! The art direction by John Dexter is excellent! The set decoration by Cheryl Carasik is excellent! The costume design by Liz Dann & Penny Rose (both who did the costume design to "Curse Of The Black Pearl" (2003) is excellent! Everyone that worked on this film will return to do the third film, "At World's End" (2007) which is slated for released May 25, 2007, on a Friday, just like this one.

Along with him, of course, comes Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), the two would-be married lovers whose wedding is interrupted by the corrupt and unscrupulous Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander), a true marketeer for the East India Trading Company.<br /><br />The continuing story. Jack, sashaying his way across the Caribbean, is trying to continue his infamous ability to cheat death. Problem is, though, is that he owes a life-debt to the dreaded Davy Jones (come full-on as a character and not just a small piece of sea karma by Bill Nighy). Davy Jones and his barnacled crew take the souls of those not willing to venture into the Great Unknown and apparently Jack had met Mr. Jones previously and wrangled a deal: he'd captain the Black Pearl for 13 years, and now that 13 years is up. So, in true Captain Sparrow fashion, Jack decides to cheat, steal, manipulate, and do whatever is necessary to save his skin. Even if it means finding the heart of Davy Jones (which is stowed away ...somewhere, waiting to be found). The more trouble is that Beckett wants the heart of Jones so that he can control the seas (he who controls Davy Jones' heart controls something called the Kracken, a mythological beast ...more on that in a minute) and thus be the only trading ships on the ocean. But Will Turner also needs the heart in order to save Elizabeth from the deadly clutches of Beckett who has promised to hang both Will and Elizabeth if he doesn't get it. The race is afoot! And what a race it is!<br /><br />As far as summertime blockbusters go, you'd have a pretty tough time finding something as entertaining as Dead Man's Chest. The action is incredible, the dialogue fun, and the special effects first-rate. Johnny Depp, as always, inhabits the role of Jack Sparrow. His mannerisms, line delivery and antics are just a sheer joy to watch. Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom are also fun to watch but not nearly as much as Depp (who steals every scene he's in).<br /><br />There are problems though (Argh!). Length is an obvious issue. At 2 and 1/2 hours, younger kids might find it a bit irritating to sit through something so long. Indeed, little youngsters should avoid the film altogether as it has some rather gruesome if not downright frightening scenes in it (gaining its full PG-13 rating by having images of eyeballs being plucked out of living and caged pirates, etc.) The other problems involve the meshing histories. A tenuous connection between Davy Jones and The Flying Dutchman can be made, of course (the true captain of the Flying Dutchman was NOT anyone named "Davy Jones" but the myth is adequate enough to have him helm the ship). The other issue is Davy Jones' mythological undersea monster, the Kracken. The Kracken is a beast related to Greek and Norwegian mythology, not something as current as Davy Jones (who's myth started, I believe, in the early 1700s). My only other movie experience with the Kracken was in the sad, sad, sad B-movie CLASH OF THE TITANS (maybe not a true B-movie, but it sure felt that way!) I will admit, however, that Dead Man's Chest got the creature's features down more appropriately according to legend.<br /><br />At any rate, this is a wonderful summer film. Blockbuster? Definitely. Disney has done something amazing in their marketing, too: pulling stories from rides at their theme parks is a sure way to ensure that people come back to Disneyland and Disney World time and time again. Sheer genius.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DY46ZABF4CMQ.html">A3DY46ZABF4CMQ</a><br/><p>Pirates Of The Carribean: Curse of the Black Pearl was an enjoyable, creepy and funny pirate movie. Dead Man's Chest, the film's first of many sequels to come, has Johnny Depp (Donnie Brasco) delivering an extraordinary performance once again, but the movie overall gets washed away into the sea with the Black Pearl.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed some of the film's action sequences, but it didn't awaze me as much as the original did (maybe I'm not a pirate fan after all!). What struck me about Pirates 2 were the cliches (a disgusting Octopus-like creature using its arms to snatch people and destroying the ship has been used before, and is used twice in the film), Depp's satirical performance (running around tied to a barbeque stick), and the cliffhanger ending (brace yourselves for a Pirates 3 movie coming out soon!).<br /><br />Maybe it is me, but Pirates 2 really didn't cause me to jump, cheer, and go insane. Maybe I'm getting old to watch all these Disney films, or maybe the film itself is lacking substance or new material to deliver. It's up to you to judge. One thing I can assure you of is that Pirates 2 is a much better sequel than Superman Returns. Unlike the latter, Pirates succeeds in staying true to its predecessor.<br /><br />Mildly recommended<br /><br />C</p></br><a href="../users/A3ICHEO78NFE4Y.html">A3ICHEO78NFE4Y</a><br/><p>Somehow i just don't find this movie all that entertaining.  Johnny Depp looks bord in many of the scenes of this film.  Special effects are not anything i really enjoy or get excited about but give me the older days when pirates were pirates.  He sort of look like a badly made up drag queen.  To me the good films of today are very few and far inbetween.  This one is way far inbetween.  Don't bother.  Rent yourself an old Gene Kelly MGM Pirate movie instead.  Actors today,,,,yuk!</p></br><a href="../users/A1EOLRV216BXJ9.html">A1EOLRV216BXJ9</a><br/><p>This sequel has given Captain Jack Sparrow, Elizabeth Swann and William Turner even more action sequences to perform. Compared with the Curse of the Black Pearl, the plot may not be that alluring. Yet the movie should be credited for daring to be different from the first. Instead of monsters under moonlight and treasure hunt, here we have sea battles in daylight, leviathan and cannibals on a beautiful island. Moreover, Keira Knightley has a bigger role here - more adventurous, sophisticated and she looks charming. So does Bill Nighy (Davy Jones) in his own way.  It is interesting to see some mutual attraction between Elizabeth and Captain Sparrow. To be frank, Johnny Depp is still the one to watch. Without this Captain Sparrow, the movie will be just another big budget summer movie.</p></br><a href="../users/AGKPTMTR3UX1R.html">AGKPTMTR3UX1R</a><br/><p>SOME MILD SPOILERS INCLUDED<br /><br />There are two, and only two, reasons why PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: DEAD MAN'S CHEST is not quite as good as the original: Length, and the fact that we've seen CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL. Standing alone, DEAD MAN'S CHEST is as fine a film as any. It's a FOUR-AND-A-HALF star flick.<br /><br />In DEAD MAN'S CHEST, Johnny Depp reprises the role of Captain Jack Sparrow, this time far more fey, who is trying to avoid payment on a debt to the nefarious Davey Jones---his soul. The key to the story is literally a key, the one which opens the Dead Man's Chest, which contains---ah, but what fun would that be if I told you?<br /><br />The difficulty is that an unscrupulous East India trader has become Governor of Port Royal. In order to retrieve the key, the chest, and it's contents, the new Governor arrests the former Governor's daughter, Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) and Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) on their wedding day, and sentences them to hang by the neck until dead for aiding in piracy---and gives Bloom the opportunity to find Jack Sparrow who is the only one who knows where the key is.<br /><br />In the meantime, Sparrow has his own problems. Now worshipped by cannibals who think he's a god, Sparrow is doing whatever he can to avoid setting foot on a ship again, where he will be easy pickings for Davey Jones. Forced by circumstance (he becomes the next planned entree) to go back to sea, he quickly runs afoul of Jones (a humanoid squid) and his equally bizarre crew aboard "The Flying Dutchman". These characters are wonderfully original and inventive.<br /><br />The majority of this two and a half hour film is loaded with fantastically well-produced action sequences, spectacular special effects, and belly laughter humor. At first a little too frenetic, DEAD MAN'S CHEST soon settles down into its own high-energy groove, and never leaves it. More traditional in its storyline than CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL (here, there's a hunt for pirate treasure that must be taken, not put back), the cast, along with Director Gore Verbinski, play it to the hilt, swashbuckling (or in Depp's case, possibly swishbuckling) across the screen, cutlasses at the ready and huzzahs on their lips.<br /><br />Where DEAD MAN'S CHEST isn't playing sea monster make-believe, it is surprisingly historically accurate, and its evocation of place (Port Royal, the pirate haven of Tortuga, and Hispaniola) all ring true. There's even a nod to Shakespeare in Keira Knightley, who masquerades as a young seaman in order to stow away aboard an East Indiaman.<br /><br />Bloom and Knightley and Jack Davenport reprise their earlier roles well. Elizabeth Swann has become a pirate lass, as competent with a cutlass as any man, and Will Turner has changed from the staid village blacksmith into Douglas Fairbanks in THE BLACK PIRATE. Jack Davenport's disgraced Commodore has also gone pirate, and his scornful, bitter, wry sarcasm is delightfully British.<br /><br />If there are slight disappointments here, they are in the length of the film (at 151 minutes, it's a leviathan, and lasts about a paltry but crucial five minutes too long), and in Depp's dialogue, which lacks some of the rapier-sharp wit we've come to expect from Captain Jack, and his portrayal, which waters down, not much but just enough to be noticeable, the snide, crafty schemer that we've come to know. The film is also much darker than its predecessor, taking place largely at night and 'tween decks. If films reflect their era, then we are living through a Dark Age for sure, but mordant wit and sticking to principles may yet save the day. Huzzah!</p></br><a href="../users/A2UZLIH3BSGJ3N.html">A2UZLIH3BSGJ3N</a><br/><p>The second installment of Pirates of the Caribbean is finally here and the third film cannot be made quickly enough. Well,I can wait,no sense in rushing a good thing, and Disney knows when it has a good thing going and does everything in their power to capitalize on it. The film itself tops  the first by bringing to light some of the other mysteries of the original. For instance,Jack's  mysterious compass that only he can make sense of and how he came about comandering the Black Pearl.Two small pieces of information, but very big puzzel pieces to say the least are brought in. There were just as many, if not more laughs in this one. The new sequel picks up shortly where it left off. Jack pilaging and stealing with Will Turner not too far behind. A new villian comes into the plot(Lord Beckett) wanting one thing of Jack's that he keeps with him at all times and talks Will into obtaining it from Jack,i.e-the compass in order to pardon Will and Elizabeth for past crimes (real and imagined).Jack himself has his own problems, the compass isn't working like its suppose to, and low and behold is visited by a ghost of his past and warned,"It's done Jack,he comes for you now" meaning the very real and feared Davey Jones.This immediately sends Jack into a panicked frenzy to run the Pearl to the shallows and onto land in order to avoid the Kraeken,a mythical sea creature that is more real than many people know.Eventually Will finds Jack and the two conspire(yet withhold vital details from one another)and work out a deal. Jack wants the key to Davey Jone's box, where the real treasure is and he talks Will into getting it. Will soon finds himself onboard the Flying Dutchman with Davey Jones at the helm and soon meets his very dead,yet alive father cursed into 100 years of servatude aboard the Dutchman.He learns of some secrets and again is brought to light of truths he was not aware of. Will eventually finds a means of escaping Davey Jones along with his very protected key, and the hunt is on. Davey Jones will stop at nothing to retrieve the key and tirelessly persues The Black Pearl while Jack is on the run/hunt for the box to which it opens. Ultimately the Pearl is corned and Davey Jones sicks the Kraeken on it eventually pulling it back to the dark crushing depths of the ocean and Jack along with it. The end leaves you hang'in and panting for the third film and I can't wait to see what they do next. This film has wonderful humor and even more action than the first topped with the fantastical special effects that ILM is know for producing. Fortunately the CGI effects do not get in the way of the story,characters or slow the film down,and that much I am greatful for because it could easily be spoiled. This is well worth owning and making a fine addition to any film fan collection.I highly reccomend it and is great fun for the whole family.</p></br><a href="../users/A3IDMLOWLHWNDJ.html">A3IDMLOWLHWNDJ</a><br/><p>Disney has announced single and double-disc editions of "Pirates of the Carribean: Dead Man's Chest" which stars Johnny Depp, Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom. Each will carry a 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen presentation, along with English Dolby Digital 5.1 tracks. The single-disc version will include two writer commentaries and a blooper reel. The two-disc collector's edition will include that along with a number of behind the scenes featurettes that detail the characters, stunts, special effects, and Pirates lore.

I don't know if the Pirates writing crew is making this up as they go along or if they have a vision, but this film certainly hinted at a much broader vision of things to come with numerous references to past battles, loves lost, and hearts kept under lock and key.  It is a much more encompassing movie than was The Curse of the Black Pearl, but it is much more loose in structure.  Verbinski keeps the action going despite what is a pretty complicated set of stories, more or less interwoven together but ultimately left unresolved.  Johnny Depp may get top billing but it is Orlando Bloom who takes the lead in this movie, holding his own against sea-monsters and the King's men alike.  With nothing more to go on than the image of a key, Will Turner and Captain Jack Sparrow are reunited (sort of) in an attempt to unlock a chest that offers a strange treasure indeed.  Keira Knightley is reduced to a stowaway, with some memorable scenes, but not as big a role as she had in The Black Pearl.  Bill Nighy steals the show as the incredible Davy Jones, a half man/half sea monster that draws on Captain Nemo more than the Flying Dutchman, but develops a troubled dark soul all his own.  Naomie Harris makes for a fetching Voodoo Queen who ultimately unlocks the secret of this adventure, aiding Captain Jack and crew on their dark voyage.  Jack Davenport returns as Norrington, a much more compelling character this time around than he was in The Black Pearl.  Having fallen from grace, he completes the triangle that makes for some pretty tense action, especially in the closing scenes.<br /><br />Be warned that Dead Man's Chest is an open ended movie, setting up what promises to be a thrilling third installment to Pirates of the Caribbean.  Not only that, it hints at possible prequels because it covers so much territory in this sprawling movie that it leaves you craving for much more.</p></br><a href="../users/ANGH6401L9Y0T.html">ANGH6401L9Y0T</a><br/><p>Yes, it is possible to get too much of a good thing. Unrelenting action, confusing twists and turns of plots and sub-plots, creative special effects -- yes, this movie is just too full. And, to be blunt, too long.<br /><br />OK, I love Johnny Depp about as much as it's possible to love any actor. One who hasn't actually showed up at my doorstep in the flesh, that is. (That's the only thing wrong with Johnny; he apparently does not even know I exist.) But the last hour of this movie could have been edited down to half an hour without losing anything all that great. We can only have so many clashes of one faction against another, only so many people slamming against the deck as the Kraken's tentacles sway menacingly and curl around everything they touch, only so many scenes of using the little undead monkey for comedy relief . . . I think I actually nodded off there for awhile.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the movie on the whole. But frankly, the members of the Davy Jones crew are indistinguishably horrible, and I never did get up any perceptible sympathy for Bootstrap Turner.

The plot is pointlessly byzantine, messy, and unoriginal. The acting ranges from earnestly average (Orlando Bloom) to casually shallow (Kiera Knightly, who looks downright emaciated) to uninspired and campy (Johnny Depp), all of which isn't helped by the script.<br /><br />It's excessive ... throwing a kitchen since of repetitive plot points and special effects in lieu of a few memorable ones.<br /><br />It's way too long ... at least by thirty minutes.<br /><br />It's unfocussed ... meandering, unentertainingly, through sequences that range in feel from a bad sitcom to a lifeless epic, including this detour to deal with "natives" (who look and act like a combination of stereotypes from old, mediocre movies) and a badly filmed fight sequence in this giant wooden wheel that keeps rolling through the rain forest ... and rolling ... and rolling ... and zzzzzz.<br /><br />Overall, this sequel presents as a something no one took seriously -- figuring it would make money even if it ended up being hours of self-indulgent, overwrought slop.<br /><br />Which it is.</p></br><a href="../users/A22BPC7LRSGSYQ.html">A22BPC7LRSGSYQ</a><br/><p>I saw Pirates Of The Caribbean - Dead Man's Chest (2006) at a drive-in back in July 2006.  The best part of that whole night was the awesome summer weather we had.  It was great sitting in the back of the car, eating hot dogs, candy, soft pretzels, drinking pop, etc. under a starry night sky.  As for the movie, well, I was somewhat disappointed.  This movie is not as good as the first movie, Pirates Of The Caribbean - The Curse Of The Black Pearl (2003).  It seems so different.  What I mean is that the story seemed rather thin while most of the emphasis was on the CGI effects.  I agree with another reviewer who pointed out that the movie came off as more of a marketing opportunity toward kids than a movie with a good and believable story.  A lot of what I saw seemed childish and unbelievable.  Johnny Depp's character seemed more cartoon-like in this movie.  It wasn't his fault, though.  The movie seemed rather "flat" overall and made my mind wander, even though there was a lot of action in it.  There was an EXCESSIVE amount of meaningless action.  Everything was OVERDONE in this movie.<br /><br />If you want to see the best movie of this series, see the first one.  Based on the reviews here on Amazon, it looks like the ratings of the movies in this series so far have gotten progressively worse.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>This was such a fantastic film! Johnny Depp is fantastic once again and the storyline here is much darker and more compelling.</p></br><a href="../users/A5TZXWU8AALIC.html">A5TZXWU8AALIC</a><br/><p>The first PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN was fun but I think its huge success went to the filmmakers' heads because the excesses of the sequels definitely take a toll on the franchise.<br /><br />More, more, more...of everything, except the fun.  Long, convoluted action scenes, a jumbled mythology weighing everything down.  Heavy helpings of CGI and stock plots.  Excess ruined THE MATRIX trilogy and it also nearly sunk the Pirates.<br /><br />There was a decent balance of the thin characters in the first movie but more of these people are definitely less.  Does anyone really care about Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley's lovers?  In the sequels, they both appear to be doing nothing but posing and defiantly jutting their jaws at the never-ending battles.<br /><br />Yes, there's action and special effects and fighting and swordplay and cannons...but eventually it's just noise.</p></br><a href="../users/A2LR4NR0G8KO7C.html">A2LR4NR0G8KO7C</a><br/><p>The first movie already contained a lot of bollocks, but this practically identical sequel just goes beyond a certain limit. Again we find brave Will, spice girl Elisabeth and Captain Jack Sparrow up against a seemingly invincible opponent, Captain Davy Jones who has, yes here the bollocks really kicks off seriously, a face made of octopus. Jones and his also half man half fish crew have controls over a huge sea monster and live under water. Sofar the real scary plot...everything is just way too smooth. There are no real bad guys and all violence comes with a smile. In that case I rather watch the old A-team series again instead of this. Part three will be out next year and no doubt it will break new records again. It is impossible for true film fans to love this movie. (SARR)</p></br><a href="../users/A2INL3AYAT6325.html">A2INL3AYAT6325</a><br/><p>I enjoyed the film.  Critics did not like it.  Yes, it was too long.  So was the first film.<br /><br />Not quite as good as the first one.<br /><br />Missing were any mention of things in the actual Disneyland attraction. Hearing the song would have been nice like they did in the first film.<br /><br />A COMPLAINT I KEEP MENTIONING MORE & MORE ON DVD PACKAGES & THE MAKERS ARE NOT PAYING ANY ATTENTION-THESE HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE PACKAGES WITH THE LITTLE FLIP OPEN PARTS.  I HATE THEM!!  THEY ARE USELESS!!<br /><br />And, a technical error on this disc, just like when playing the DVD for "Cars".  If you see the subtitles for the hearing impaired.  The subtitles are NOT correct in several areas.  They omit words from the script the actors are saying.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GPN2VKS8E77C.html">A2GPN2VKS8E77C</a><br/><p>This action-packed sequel to the 2003 Walt Disney Pictures hit "Pirates Of The Caribbean" is crammed to the brim with a great storyline, spectacular action scenes (especially one terrific swordfight atop a mill wheel), awesome special effects, good performances and, as usual, Disney humor. I won't spoil the storyline, for the sake of those who haven't seen it, but I will say one thing. If you loved the first movie, which grossed $650 million (so far, this film has grossed $361 million, with a budget of $225 million), you will enjoy this one even more. Keira Knightley is as charming as ever and her performance is well-done, exuding greater empathy and fire. Orlando Bloom is good as Ms. Knightley. Jack Davenport, looking more like Pierce Brosnan in the torture scenes from "Die Another Day," is good. However, this movie is entirely Johnny Depp's. Having seen him in the family-friendly J.M. Barrie biopic "Finding Neverland" and the first "Pirates," he has proven his worth to me as an actor. Ms. Knightley proves herself worthy of holding her own in period pieces and against her male co-stars. I love this movie.<br /><br />Word to parents: Despite Walt Disney Pictures producing this wonderful movie, this film is darker than the original and is therefore not suitable for very young children (depending on their tolerance for the heavy material, of course; thanks, in part to Jerry Bruckheimer-"Pearl Harbor," "Remember The Titans"- and the excellent script by Ted Eliott and Terry Rossio-the writers behind the smash box-office hits "Aladdin" and "The Mask Of Zorro"). This film, along with the first movie, should have been rated PG. The violence (period-style swordfights) isn't graphic (you'd expect that from Walt Disney Pictures, a company which prides itself, and made its name on, family-friendly entertainment; the camera cuts away before any graphic execution takes place) and there is absolutely no language or sexual content (the cleavage shown in the films is consistent with the period in which the films are set-England in the 1600's). Walt Disney is still riding high. Watch for "Pirates Of The Caribbean 3: At World's End" due out next summer. Rated PG for action-adventure violence.</p></br><a href="../users/ANEDXRFDZDL18.html">ANEDXRFDZDL18</a><br/><p>I really enjoy Dead Man's Chest. Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), was a scene stealer, and as far as I'm concerned Keira Knightly and Orlando Bloom were just so much dead weight. The plot is rather simple, standard action affair, but the special effects were breathtaking. I do wish they'd toned down the 'barnacles' on the dead sailors. Some of the scenes were gag-provoking. Jack Sparrow was the hero of the show, fun to watch in every scene he was in.<br /><br />On the negative side, I do think some scenes were a bit overdone. The scene with Orlando and the ex-captain fighting on the water wheel was just hokey and lasted too long. Likewise some scenes on the ghost ship were just a little sickening (the barnacles) etc.<br /><br />Overall, a fun, fast action flick. Sure to entertain.</p></br><a href="../users/ABFOAYZA2UHD3.html">ABFOAYZA2UHD3</a><br/><p>That's what this movie is. That's what the first one was, too. Maybe the One was better in terms of story, but there is nothing wrong with the Two (cept length, boy there WAS room to cut it shorter). Cast eqally as amazin in both. Depp hilarious!!<br /><br />Went "uh-oh, there's gonna be a Three" when I saw the ending. It does not end, it goes "to be continued". Hope we don't have to wait too long.</p></br><a href="../users/AW99SBGWEXP0J.html">AW99SBGWEXP0J</a><br/><p>Captain Jack (Depp) is back, and causing trouble for Will Turner (Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Knightley).  Their marriage is interrupted when they are arrested for aiding in the escape of Captain Jack.  Lord Cutler Beckett (Hollander) does not want to see them die, and wants to make a deal.  If they help him get Jack, they will not be put to death.  Will finds Jack being worshiped as a god by a bunch of cannibals.  After a fashion, they escape to the Black Pearl, where Jacking is looking for a mysterious chest that belongs to Davey Jones (Nighy).  Jones is trying to get to the chest before Jack for reasons of his own.  Amongst all this, Elizabeth shows up to join the hunt, and finds a new interest in Captain Jack.<br /><br />"Dead Man's Chest" delivers all that "Curse of the Black Pearl" delivered, but the difference is that "Black Pearl" was new and fresh, while "Chest" gives off a feeling of "been there, done that."  That is not to say that "Dead Man's Chest" does not deliver the goods, but it is not as original, and that is a slight drawback.  Another negative is the running length.  At 155 minutes, it is longer than it needs to be.  That being said, it is good to see Captain Jack and the gang back in action again.  The action is well done, and the special effects are top notch, especially the squid-faced Davey Jones.  A few cliffhangers thrown in at the end assures "Pirates 3" a warm reception come May 2007.  If you like the first film, you will like this one.  I recommend it, and hope that "Pirates 3" can take it up a notch to end on a high note.</p></br></body></html>

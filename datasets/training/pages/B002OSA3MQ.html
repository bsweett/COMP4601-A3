This film won Cannes Festival 1949.<br />You will never get tired of watching over and over this giant work. A Cold War spy classic. From Graham Greene novel.<br />Magnificent!</p></br><a href="../users/A2Q457CES5ZUZ.html">A2Q457CES5ZUZ</a><br/><p>Anyone who has net yet seen this cinematic masterpiece is in for a rare treat.  &quot;The Third Man&quot; is both a brilliant achievement from the standpoint of superb black and white photography, with an Oscar being won in that category by cameraman Robert Krasker,and in dramatic storytelling with British fiction great Graham Greene delivering the premier screenplay of his notable career.<p>The film captures the dark and suspicious Vienna underworld by night during the black market and rationing period following World War Two.  American Holly Martens, played with an appropriate bumbling innocence by normally suave Joseph Cotten, leaves his middle class existence as a pulp fiction writer of westerns to fly to Vienna after an invitation from his longstanding friend, Harry Lime, played with a colorful ruthlessness by Orson Welles, to join him in a business enterprise.<p>The film's first shock occurs at the beginning of &quot;The Third Man,&quot; when Cotten is informed on arrival that Welles has been killed after being accidentally hit by a car.  Cotten is suspicious from the beginning.  His skepticism accelerates after talking to Welles' girlfriend, played with a sexy nonchalance by Alida Valli.  Eventually he learns that Welles is very much alive.  His anything but surefooted detective activities cause concern for British Army captain Trevor Howard, who fears that Cotten will be killed by Welles or another operative in his syndicate, which specializes in stealing penicillin, dilluting it, then selling it at enormous profits to hospitals.<p>&quot;The Third Man&quot; exudes effortless suspense from the opening scene up to the film's dramatic end.  British director Carol Reed was at the peak of his career when he did &quot;The Third Man.&quot;  Once your appetite has been sufficently enhanced by this film, make sure to also view two other Reed classics of the period, &quot;Odd Man Out&quot; and &quot;The Fallen Idol.&quot;<p>William Hare</p></br><a href="../users/A1DTCJV6KOMJOA.html">A1DTCJV6KOMJOA</a><br/><p>I was blown away the first time I saw The Thid Man! Everything about this film is genius. It takes place in the after shock of war of a torn a sunder Vienna. The streets full of shadows and cobble stones drenched in mist and puddles. Holly Martins (Cotten) is called to the city to attend his beloved friend Harry Lime's (Welles) funeral while he plans for his visit to be short he finds things aren't as they seem and Harry may not be dead and Martins also falls for Harry's lover played by Valdi. The camera angles are constantly changing giving the viewer a feeling of unbalance and unease. The acting is perfection Cotton is perfect as Harry Lime. The director Reed, wanted James Stewart but thank god Sleznick wanted Cotton. Stewart's everyman looks and drawl voice would have slowed the pace of the film greatly. Instead Cotten gives Martins a snide and swarmy appeal and in the end you never question why Cotten's Character befriended Welles' Lime. Because Martins'(Cotten) has a little of Lime's (Welles) persona in him. Valli is brilliant in her role as Anna Schmidt. She is both distant and lonely for her departed lover and will always love the man she thought Lime was instead of the monster that he is. Welles is brilliant! When we first see him in the building's foyer he smiles like only Wellels can. Like he knows something we never will it's not a smurk but a hint of evil lurks behind his eyes and cherub face. This film is mesmerizing!  Watch how Anna just goes through Lime's apartment knowing where everything is without even looking down to find what she is looking for-even though she just told the authorities she's never been there. Listen to how she constantly confuses the first names of Cotten's and Welles' similiarly named characters Holly and Harry! Little nuances like this makes films of this stature a gem to own. The final chase scenes through the vast and maze like sewers of Vienna is both daunting and claustrophobic to watch! And when welles slivers his hand through the grate your heart skips a beat. Simply the best thriller ever made!</p></br><a href="../users/A17N23WXA7EAF.html">A17N23WXA7EAF</a><br/><p>1. Graham Greene is a brilliant story teller and "The Third Man" is a fascinating, beautifully crafted tale that lends itself perfectly to the screen<br /><br />2. Few actors living or dead can be considered a phenomenon and Orson Wells is certainly one of them. He brings genius and energy to the screen even though his character is absent for most of this film.<br /><br />3. It must have been a director's dream to be able to film in bombed out, ruined post-war Vienna. It was eerie and fascinating to see this drama played out among the ruins that were quite literally a shadow of the catastrophic war that had preceded it.<br /><br />4. The music in this film is amazing and I haven't encountered anything like it in any other.<br /><br />5. I happen to love film-noire (except for Bush's speeches) and "The Third Man" is subtle, exquisitely refined film noire.<br /><br />6. I am also interested in transpersonal psychology, so I always love it when stories mingle personal drama with larger than life events which this one did.<br /><br />7. From a purely cinematic point of view (I'm no expert, this is just my opinion), this film is beautifully shot with not a single superfluous or disconnected scene.<br /><br />8. The film contains wonderful ironies including the historical fact that post-war Vienna's International Zone was occupied by joint, British, French, Russian, and American troops (literally one of each in a jeep driving along the ruined streets) who could only communicate with each other in German--the language of their defeated enemy.<br /><br />9. The characters are not cookie-cutter good guy, bad guy ,police man, and girl. They are flawed and interesting in their own ways which makes them much more believable and fun to watch.<br /><br />10. I just saw "Until Sunrise" a few weeks ago, so it's fun to do mental comparisons between bombed-out, post-war Vienna, and the hip, cool Vienna of the 90's.</p></br><a href="../users/A1K3NQAO49LXL2.html">A1K3NQAO49LXL2</a><br/><p>Voted the best British film of the 20th century, and regarded as the best film ever filmed in Vienna, The Third Man was the first of its kind in many ways: filmed in 1949, it was the first British film shot largely on location, it was also the first to focus on a single musician rather than an orchestra for its soundtrack.<br /><br />This Criterion Collection DVD is loaded with stuff. The first DVD comes with the full movie, plus three additional audio tracks: commmentary by Stephen Soderbergh and screennwriter Tony Gilroy, commentary by film scholar Dana Polan, and an abridged recording of Graham Greene's treatment of the story, to follow the whole film, as ready by actor Richard Clarke. There is also a video introduction by director Peter Bogdanovich. The second DVD has three documentaries, two radio plays based on The Third Man, photo data, the two alternate opening narrations, and a bunch of other stuff.<br /><br />Bogdanovich, in his intro, calls it the best "non-auteur" film ever made. Carol Reed is underrated, probably because his last films weren't so fantastic. Great black and white photography, the real star of the film, showing the wetness of the stones. Orson Welles had told Bogdanovich "Black and white is the actor's friend. Every performance is better in black and white. Name me one great performance in colour, I defy you." Peter Bogrdanovich agrees, as there is a lack of distraction by familiar colour themes, and the focus is on the drama instead. Orson Welles says it's the greatest "star part", in the way that he doesn't step onstage until late into the movie. Welles says he had no influence on the film, he only wrote the cuckoo clock speech. The film is called daring and fast cutting, and Bogdanovich recommends the In Search of the Third Man book. The documentary notes that Guy Hamilton, an assistant director on this film, went on to direct three Bond films, including "Goldfinger," and explains how Graham Greene went to Vienna for a few weeks, arriving on February 11th, 1948; on the last day he heard from the British intelligence about the penicillin scam, which gave him his idea for the plot. The UK intro to the film was narrated by Carol Reed himself ,the US intro by Joseph Cotton. "Oh, I want to tell you about Holly Martens." Walks under a ladder (why is it there? it's a prop, he's been scripted to walk under a ladder... it's foreshadowing!), talks to an old Austrian porter (famed Austrian actor Paul Horbiger, actually), who tells him that Harry Lime, the man he is looking for, is dead and either in Hell (he points up) or Heaven (he points down). This is a mixup of language, but it also shows how upside-down everything was in 1949.<br /><br />There is some great German dialogue by the famed Austrian actress Hedwig Bleibtreu: "Die Befreiung habe ich mich ganz anders vorgestellt." (I had imagined that the Liberation would be much different than this.) "Oh, danke, Sie sind wirklich das eingzige anst&auml;ndige Mensch hier." (Oh, thank you, you are really the only decent person here.) Crooked frames in some shots describe the chaos, sprial staircases hint at madness. Holly is bitten by a cockatiel, then there is the chase through the streets of Vienna. "You were born to be murdered" Callahan says to Holly. Extra content - director Reed and producer David Selznik had disagreed over Welles, who was Reed's choice but who Selznik considered box office poison. There were three units - day, night, and sewer, and the on-site production continued over seven weeks. Director Carol Reed chewed benzedrine in order to be able to direct all three units, nearly 24 hours a day. Reed cut a Vienna at night series, but couldn't use it because he believed that every shot must be functional (where is it? why isn't it in the Criterion Collection version of the film?!?!). Since Welles came late, many shots were done with stand-ins; and since he was appalled at the filth of the sewer, a sound stage was built at Shepperton Studios to recreate parts of the sewer system. Austrian actors were flown in for this too. In the studio at the same time were Cary Grant, Montgomery Clift and Ann Sheridan. Viennese musician of note Anton Karas played at the welcome reception for the film actors when they came to shoot on location, Carol Reed was taken by the instrument he played at the recdption, the hitherto-unknown (to him, and to British and American actors and directors) zither, and recorded hours of his music in his hotel room. When it was decided to use the music in the intro, it was unprecedented because film scores were always orchestral and didn't focus on solo instruments.<br /><br />There is archival material, such as the press pack, and the original trailers: (man's hard voice) "Hated by 1,000 men", (woman's desirous voice) "desired by one woman." (man's voice) "The Third Man - hanging's too good for him"; (woman's voice, desirous) "Nothing's too good for The Third Man". Crazy titles like "He'll have you in a dither with his zither" (ugh!!!). Then there are the documentaries: Shadowing The Third Man is a documentary that shows long snatches of the film and moves along slowly, as it would if it was sold to fill a 90-minute space but had less than 10 minutes of real content; the film provides at the start some Zeitgeist, it seems that 270,000 men were killed in World War II, and 500,000 were in prisoner of war camps or in exile, so women were largely responsible for rebuilding the city. Reed and Selznik argued over Anita Valli's clothes, Selznik thought that they were too dowdy for a big star. Paul Horbiger couldn't speak a word of English and had to be coached by phoneticists. Hedwig Bleibtreu, the landlady, was 82 at the time, but she always showed up on time for filming, never arrived late. A now-adult Hansi talked about his role, how he was just playing himself. The documentary shows cool morphs from modern Vienna to scenes form the movie, such as the cat scene, and the 300 km of sewers. The Ferris Wheel was deep in the Soviet zone, a sort of propaganda set to display the wonders of communism. "Harry is in only 10% of the film, the love triangle is only complete for a sort scene. Welles wondering "how anyone can work in these conditions. Sewer police were mobilised for the shoot. In some scenes we can see Orson Welles' breath in the cold weather, these were the scenes filmed on site. Also, we learn that those are Carol Reed's fingers poking through the grill to demonstrate some great non-verbal dialogue. There are also four very important lines cut from the end of the film:<br /><br />  - Calloway - What happened?<br />  - Martins - I couldn't bear his pain, I put a bullet through him."<br />  - Calloway - We'll forget that bit."<br />  - Martins - I never shall!"<br /><br />The dialogue, however, is replaced by Harry's nod, and some of the body language between Cotton and Welles (and Trevor Howard, in a few seconds) is just what it is.<br />The script called for, and the crew filmed, a scene where Anna was kidnapped by the Soviets, but this was cut from the film to make it less political (I almost wish that they had included it - there was so much noise about her passport and the Russian authorities, it was irritating and irrelevant otherwise. On the other hand, it also never got boring.<br /><br />"The Third Man theme" was a #1 hit on the Variety Charts in the week ending June 10th, 1950. Hard as it to imagine, for a brief period the world was in the grips of zither mania!! But as a result of the European success of The Third Man, Korda kidnapped the negative, and the relationship with him and David Selznik deteriorated.<br /><br />There are two tracks of commentary on the DVD, one by filmmakers Stephen Soderbergh and Tony Gilroy that is not very interesting at all, but film scholar Dana Polan offers a strong commentary throughout the film, and we learn a few things from him, as well as the film theory stuff about the type of film that it was, a "binary film" that provided tension between values, identity, moralising, as well as between the old world and the new, the artistic world of European film and the commercial world of Hollywood, which is already suggested in the credits. Polan describes Holly as a brash, cocky American who's a bit slow on the uptake and a prime example of the ugly American abroad (Soderbergh and Gilroy are harder on his character, calling him a blank nothing who never really succeeds at anything of his own accord - he's a bit of a Jeffrey "the Dude" Lebowski in that regard). For the early scene of Martins walking under a ladder, it depicts him walking of his own volition right into a world of bad luck. Holly was supposed to be a British cahracter, but David O. Selznik insisted on an American. Bernard Lee, who was M in the Bond films, plays Seargent Paine. Parallels exist in the film with the formula westerns that Holly writes, that whole "sherrif telling the stranger to be on the next stagecoach out of town if he knows what's good for him."<br /><br />The packaging of the DVD is stunning also - the first disc shows the full ferris wheel on its round shape, while the second disc shows the mesh of cables and supports seen from inside a cabin, symbolically depicting the object from the outside (the full movie) and its inner workings (the documentaries about the movie and its dissection).<br /><br />"Who Was The Third Man" is a documentary in German by Austria's Wien-Kanal, it starts with a jazz intro with the theme song. It gave more zeitgeist than other films, explaining that on March 10th, 1950, the film opened in Vienna, and 120,000 went to see it in following weeks, curious to see how Vienna would be portrayed in an American film.<br /><br />Someone made the comment that the grave where they filmed Harry's multiple burials is not occupied by someone called Gr&uuml;n, which is German for "green"; Lime also means green. There are other similarities - Greene stayed at the Hotel Sacher, like the writer Holly Martins does, and he was also in 1948 to give a talk at the British Council, like Martins also is. Stylistically, the documentary moves from colour to black and white, as if to achieve some goal. But the documentary does explain that Greene knew British spymaster and traitor Kim Philby, who was in the area at the time, and how Greene rubbed shoulders with master spies, and after he had rubbed shoulders with these people, had heard the racketeering tales. There's footage of Paul Horbinger talking about the film in 1979, and more discussion about the soundtrack. Reed wanted a non-virtuoso to do the zither soundtrack, wanted it to sound broken and cracked, like Vienna itself. For the first recording, all that Anton Karas did was a first take, and for the first recording all he got was a blue suit, he was happy. Later he became a millionaire, selling 40 million records, and opened up his own club. Couldn't read or write music, though, it seems.<br /><br />The sewers: there were 7,500 km when the documentary was made in 2007, but in 1949 when the film was made there were 3,000 km). Sewer shooting needed four weeks. Welles' body double was a butcher Otto Schusser. Then there is a nice final shot of the long walk - the host walks down the side as they re-produce the original film's final shot.<br /><br />Another documentary is Graham Greene: The Hunted Man, A 1968 profile of Graham Greene with Christopher Burnstall, which touches on nearly all of his work up until that point except for "The Third Man". Funny. Starts off with Greene's passport, and its many stamps, all from countries that we know he's visited because his stories are set there. Then there is the discussion - which Greene only allowed to be audio-taped, he didn't want to become a non-serious writer who becomes a TV comedian - that touches upon so many topics, such as Greene's life, and where he felt hunted: Indochina, during the London Blitz, and by the Catholic faith. "Human nature is not black and white, but black and gray." The conversation takes place on the Orient Express from Paris to Istanbul, traveling through Switzerland, Italy, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Greece and Turkey. Three days, two nights, with no restaurant car. Feels a writer should not be recognised, likes borders, but never wants to stay in any one place too long or let the ice get too thick. Used to play Russian roulette, but one bullet in a chamber was too few for him, he lost the kick, so he put in two bullets! He met the pope, who had read The Power And The Glory and was surprised that his books were black listed. "Some parts of your books will always offend some Catholics; you shouldn't pay any attention to them whatsovever." Talks about smoking opium in Indochina, but that he'd only have 10 pipes on three occasions in a given week and that real addicts would have 50-250 pipes a day. Smoking in pairs is social, and anyone could get a full night's sleep with any amount. How wonderful.<br /><br />There are brief interviews with students: "I don't think that any of Greene's heroes are heroes; they're just ordinary people who've gotten themselves in a mess."<br /><br />  - The war does spoil everything,doesn't it?<br />  - it gives the young men a chance.<br /><br />Greene became a Catholic before his first book, and it was a secret for 10 years, but by Brighton Rock it was obvious. Never wrote about Nazi Germany, Hitler was a boring subject. Liked gossip, would listen to what women, priests, lawyers and doctors had to say to each other. Did psychoanalysis, needed to keep a dream diary. Used to write 500 words a day, later came down to 200 words a day. Continues to write, even when it is going badly. Beginning and ending of a project is clear in its framework, then there's the mountain range in between the two and a hope for surprises.<br /><br />Extras: Anton Karas in London, a snippet, beautiful, hypnotic. A feature on the sewer brigade, which polices the sewers. "There are strange jobs in this world, but surely none so weird as these police of the underworld." "The Lives of Harry Lime: A Ticket To Tangiers." Radio play, broadcast August 24th 1951, from a soundplay written by Orson Welles. "Harry Lime had many lives. How do I know? My name is Harry Lime." Answered ad in Paris, went to Tangiers, fell in love, got trapped into a strange game, got attcked, turned it all around, and beat the crazy rap. Wild, man, wild...</p></br><a href="../users/A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV.html">A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV</a><br/><p>"I never knew the Vienna before the war"....<br /><br />Thus begins one of the greatest films ever made and one of the greatest film characters ever created in the charismatic and brilliantly dangerous Harry Lime. Who created him has been argued about for years. Welles was always diplomatic and gave credit to Carol Reed, but anyone who has ever seen this film knows better. Fans of Orson Welles can easily discern his fingerprints everywhere.<br /><br />He brings the enigmatic Lime to life, his genius hanging over every frame of this wonderful Carol Reed production. Joseph Cotten, a friend and staple in a lot of his films, is on hand as pulp western writer Holly Martins. When Cotten comes to postwar Vienna it is an uncoordinated international mess, the black market thriving in the chaos. When Martins discovers his old friend Harry Lime is dead this film really begins.<br /><br />Alida Valli is the strikingly beautiful actress Cotten falls for, but has no chance with because she's in love with his old friend Harry. But Harry might not be so dead after all, at least not according to Trevor Howard, the detective hot on Harry's heels for racketeering. Cotten is having none of it and sets out to clear his friend's name. What follows is the most stylishly filmed noir in film history.<br /><br />The stark black and white photography and the off-kilter camera angles serve to highlight a postwar world where things are not quite right. From the moment Welles steps out of the shadows into the streets of Vienna we are mesmerized. Harry Lime is almost amused by the chase and the proceedings. The scene on a ferris wheel between Martins and Harry, who may not be the same man he knew, is unforgettable, as is Lime's views of the Swiss!<br /><br />If you haven't seen this film, you've been missing one of the five best films ever made. Whenever I think of Welles, this is what I think of. His Harry Lime is unforgettable. Welles would later portray the same character on a weekly radio show. When Martins discovers what Harry has been up to he must make a decision that will change his chances with Valli, and could cost him a lot more.<br /><br />Anton Karas' zither theme helps set the off-center mood for this film and is justly famous. It is not something that would work independent of the film but is a perfect match for what is happening onscreen. All the extra goodies on this Blu-Ray Criterion edition are listed in the product description. The most fabulous of these, for radio lovers at least, is Welles' portrayal of Harry Lime in one of the finest from that radio series.<br /><br />Every single part of this film works within the atmospheric framework to create a dark and exciting jigsaw puzzle you'll never forget. A true screen classic.</p></br><a href="../users/A3V6Z4RCDGRC44.html">A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</a><br/><p>The Third Man is a true classic, and worthy of its vote as #57 in the AFI top 100. Even over sixty years later, the story draws you in and keeps you fascinated.<br /><br />The location is post-war Vienna, dark, seedy, watched over by four different countries who do not get along entirely well. There are bombed-out ruins in all directions. The black market thrives and the locals are nervous about the occupiers. Into this complicated mix of cultures and emotions comes Holly, an American writer of cowboy stories. He's upset when he finds his friend Harry has just died, and outraged when the police and others indicate that Harry was a racketeer. He is convinced that there's a conspiracy to blacken his friend's name, and he's going to get to the bottom of it.<br /><br />He's soon chasing down the doctor who Harry went to, other friends of Harry's, as well as Anna, Harry's girlfriend. Holly begins to fall for Anna, and assembling together the threads of a story. But things are even more complicated than they appear.<br /><br />The characters are great, and the cinematography is brilliant. The shadows hide and reveal characters, Motives slide and slip. The movie gets better with subsequent watchings, as you sense the hidden motives and see the subtle touches, the hiding of the photo, the playing with the dice. The children pushing the carousel because they can't afford tickets.<br /><br />A classic scene involves characters high in a ferris wheel, talking about the people below as "dots" - about whether anyone really cares about those tiny dots. Does anyone really care whether they live or die? It's a powerful view of the world, and an insight into the way the characters view the world. I love the discussion about how the quiet Swiss culture produced cuckoo clocks, while the violence-laden Italian culture of the Renaissance created fantastic artwork.<br /><br />While several AFI top 100 movies are good to watch just once for historical purposes, this one is well worth owning and rewatching several times.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AFXJ8U72MD6L.html">A1AFXJ8U72MD6L</a><br/><p>This is a film you can't watch casually. If you do you'll miss a lot of the nuances. Don't feel bad if you have to watch it more than once to get it either. You won't be the first. On that note this is one of the Noir classics. It's won a ton of awards, including AFI's Top 100 and Britain's Academy Awards for Best Film. Tale focuses on an author of Westerns who comes to Vienna because his friend, Harry Lime, offered him a job. However, when he arrives he finds out that Harry Lime was killed in a car accident yet when he investigates it he finds contradictory facts being tossed out to him. That's where the title comes into play. Look for the extreme close ups and strangely placed camera angles. The American writer's optimism and sometimes blind loyalty to his friend contrasts vividly at times with the cynical Post War gloominess of Vienna. In Austria, "local critics were underwhelmed" and the film ran for only a few weeks; William Cook, after his 2006 visit to an eight-room museum in Vienna dedicated to the film, wrote "In Britain it's a thriller about friendship and betrayal. In Vienna it's a tragedy about Austria's troubled relationship with its past." The musical score is strangely alluring.

The cuckoo clock.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z.html">A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z</a><br/><p>The 50th Anniversary Edition of THE THIRD MAN has been digitally restored to near perfect visual and audio condition. It's advertised as a Director's Cut, which is partially true. There have always been two different versions of this movie. The British release has an intro by director Carol Reed, while the American one includes narration by Joseph Cotten. Additionally, Daryl Zanuck made a few minor edits in the U.S. version. To be a true "director's cut," this film would incorporate the Reed comments as well as the restored segments.<br /><br />The VHS release of THE THIRD MAN has been fleshed out to a full two hours running time with the inclusion of a pre-movie analysis by Peter Bogdonovich, plus several items after the film, such as Anton Karas performing the theme song in a coffee house setting, a vintage advertising trailer, Gaumont newsreel footage and of especial interest, a comparison of film portions before and after digital restoration. These magical efforts have made a bona fide classic positively sparkle-- the movie has never looked better. The plot is of course always engaging while Cotten, Valli, Howard and Welles are simply unforgettable.

Starring in this fascinating film noir is glamorous Rita Hayworth, who attempted unsuccessfully to reconcile with co-star and estranged husband Welles during this film's production.</p></br><a href="../users/A36EW68H08UOCS.html">A36EW68H08UOCS</a><br/><p>Carol Reed directed Graham Greene's script and the result is the sort of film that still shows up on "greatest movie" lists 50 years later.<br /><br />Joseph Cotten plays Holly Martin, an American who writes pulpy Westerns. Holly has come to Vienna just at the end of World War II to visit his old friend, Harry Lime. He arrives just in time to hear about Harry's funeral.  Vienna is a city full of rubble and debris from bombing.  It has been divided up into four sectors governed by Americans, British, French and Russians.  The black market fluorishes.<br /><br />Holly discovers Harry's girlfriend, Anna, played by the enigmatic Valli, and he discovers that Harry was one of the dirtiest and most opportunistic of the black marketeers.<br /><br />Harry Lime is played by Orson Welles, and the part has as much "bang for the buck" as any in cinematic history.  In the accompanying documentary Peter Bogdonovich recalls speaking with Orson Welles and remarking that Harry Lime was one of the great parts of cinematic history.<br /><br />"Oh, yes", Welles said.  "It's a great Mr. Wu part."<br /><br />"Mr. Wu?" Bogdonovich asked.<br /><br />"Yes, you know - 'you'd better watch out for Mr. Wu.... did you run that by Mr. Wu? Then at the end of the first act you see Mr. Wu in silhouette far away standing on a bridge.  By the time 'Mr. Wu' actually shows up in the film his stature has become so built up in the minds of the audience he is MUCH bigger than life."<br /><br />Harry Lime is one of those characters.  This is one of those movies.  The further the story progresses the more layers of deceit and wrongdoing are uncovered.  Feelings are hurt, hearts are broken, innocents are hurt and killed.<br /><br />This film has several of the most famous scenes of movie history.  Roger Ebert writes that the appearance of Harry Lime is the most famous entrance in cinema.  The ending surprised even the actors.  The "cuckoo clock" speech is said to have been improvised by Welles, and it's difficult to think that anything written by Graham Greene could have been improved, but it's impossible to think of the film without this speech.<br /><br />If you haven't seen it - dive right in.  Go with Holly Martin and Anton Karas' famous zither score.  Fall in love with Anna.  Smile with Harry and take your choice - War and Da Vinci or Peace and the Cuckoo Clock?</p></br><a href="../users/A16QODENBJVUI1.html">A16QODENBJVUI1</a><br/><p>One could make an exceptionally good case for this being the best film ever made by a British production company. Certainly, it is at worse one of the very best. The film impeccably freezes in our imaginations images of post-war Europe in general and Vienna in particular. And anyone who has seen this will discover scene after scene emblazoned in his or her memory. Indeed, this film is a succession of stunning images and scenes: the first time we see Harry Lime (Orson Welles), lurking in the shadows of a doorway, hands in pockets, an ambiguous, almost apologetic yet amused smile. The Ferris wheel towering over Holly Martins (Joseph Cotton) as he waits to meet Harry Lime. The extraordinary "Cuckoo Clock" speech that Harry delivers as he and Holly ride the Ferris Wheel high above the "ants" below. The chase through the sewers. The unforgettable as Anna Schmidt (Valli) walks towards and then past Holly as Anton Karas plays utterly unforgettable zither piece known today as "The Third Man" theme.<p>An enormous amount of great talent was involved in this picture, and nearly all were at the height of their powers. Graham Greene produced one of the great scripts the movies has seen, about an hack writer who has arrived in post-war Vienna to take a job that has been offered him by his old friend Harry Lime, only to discover that he has died in a car wreck. In talking with various friends, the friend, Holly Martins, discovers that the various stories told about Lime don't quite mesh with one another. The climax of the movie comes when Holly learns that Harry not only didn't die but also is making a fortune on the black market. Joseph Cottons turned in perhaps the finest performance in his career as the good natured, but always-one-step-behind Holly Martins. Orson Welles was never better as an actor than he was in this film as the enigmatic Harry Lime, managing to be both thoroughly charismatic and completely reprehensible at the same time. Trevor Howard was as solid as always as Harry Lime's nemesis Major Calloway. Many, many of the minor characters turn in memorable performances. Today, Carol Reed is not well remembered in the United States. This is unfortunate, because he was a truly first rate director with many very fine movies to his credit (among which I do not include the hard-to-take OLIVER). Part of the reason for this has been the widespread influence of French auteur criticism, which pretty much tarred all British cinema with the same inconceivably broad brush, excepting perhaps only the work of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger. As much as I enjoy the work of the latter (jointly known as "The Archers"), I believe that Carol Reed is not as appreciated as he deserves. This film certainly is highly regarded, but he left behind many, many other superb films that also deserve continued viewing. At any rate, regardless of the amount of attention his work as a whole received, this film incontestably remains one of the truly great films in the history of cinema.</p></br><a href="../users/ANGH6401L9Y0T.html">ANGH6401L9Y0T</a><br/><p>Graham Greene wrote the book, but I admit I've never read it. Seems amazing that this is my first encounter with so famous a movie and/or book. Anyway, I recognized the theme music.<br /><br />Holly Martins (Joseph Cotten) arrives in Vienna just in time to catch the funeral of his friend Harry Lime (Orson Welles). Lime's girlfriend Anna (an actress named Vallei) is at the funeral, and Martins ends up involved with her life for a variety of reasons, among them the fact that her passport (she's Czech) was forged by Lime. Since Vienna is ruled by a four-nation coalition of Americans, British, French and Russians, the Russians want to repatriate her, treating her as a member of the Soviet Union.<br /><br />But there's more. Martins soon begins to suspect that Lime's death was not an accident, especially since different witnesses give different accounts of what happened the night he was killed. The title "The Third Man" relates to the fact that one witness said there were three men who carried him to the sidewalk after being hit by a truck, whereas the other witnesses say there were two.<br /><br />Next, he discovers that the police are searching for an associate of Lime's that disappeared a couple of weeks earlier, and everyone keeps telling Martins to go back to the states and not get involved. Involved in what? He's just trying to find out how his friend died. But the more he probes, the more he discovers that there's a lot more here than a simple accident, or even a murder.<br /><br />Nothing is what it seems at first in this movie. Nothing, really nothing. Good guys, bad guys, motives, even real facts. There's very little I can add without telling you too much. I think you will find the ending unexpected no matter how closely you pay attention. But that's fine; it's worth seeing twice to catch what you missed.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z.html">A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z</a><br/><p>All three photos on this product page are of non-studio videotapes, recorded at slower than SP speed and usually without a HiFi audio track.<br /><br />.<br />Orson Welles once explained to Peter Bogdonovich that a true star role is one where others talk about an unseen person for 45 minutes before he finally appears.

One of its hallmarks is the exceptional camera work by cinematographer Robert Krasker, for which he won an Oscar. The lighting and angles he used cannot be forgotten. But equally memorable is the music by zither artist Anton Karas, for which he was nominated. It is one of the very few films in which a single instrument carries the entire score.<br /><br />The story and screenplay by Graham Greene form the foundation for this post WWII thriller set in Vienna about the missing friend (Orson Welles) of an American western novelist (Joseph Cotten). Alida Valli portrays beautifully Welles' illegal actress-girlfriend, and Trevor Howard is the Rock of Gibraltar as the British sergeant responsible for solving the mystery of Welles' disappearance. Old Vienna is wrapped in mystery and fog, full of suspicious people and suspenseful moments. The final chase through the sewers is among the most classic scenes in all of cinema.<br /><br />Even though Reed did not receive the Oscar for Best Director for his masterpiece, he did win the Cannes Film Grand Prix, and proved his genius as a director. (Welles was not above taking some credit for the success on the basis of association.) Before this, Reed had directed Odd Man Out (1947) starring James Mason, and The Fallen Idol (1948) - another Graham Greene story and script - with Ralph Richardson. After this, he directed Trapeze (1956) with Burt Lancaster and Tony Curtis, and Our Man In Havana (1959) with Alec Guinness and Maureen O'Hara - again, a Graham Greene story and script. Even though The Agony And The Ecstasy (1965) with Charlton Heston and Rex Harrison was a well crafted film based on a Philip Dunne script, it was a box office flop. Only Reed's final film, Oliver! (1968), would again attract the public, and Oscar - this time with eleven nominations, taking home five including Best Picture and Best Director.<br /><br />Waitsel Smith</p></br><a href="../users/A3MV1KKHX51FYT.html">A3MV1KKHX51FYT</a><br/><p>The Third Man, 1949 film<br /><br />The film begins showing post-war Vienna which is divided into four sectors.

The sparkling, sylphlike strumming makes an ironic, dramatically effective counterpoint to the foreboding atmosphere of a bombed-out Vienna barely recovering from the war. There are many ironies embedded In the story, no surprise given that the screenplay is penned by novelist Graham Greene, whose best work reflects the pervasive moral ambiguities surrounding modern man and the moral ambivalence that complicates otherwise comfortable lives.<br /><br />The intricate story focuses on Holly Martins, a semi-renowned pulp fiction writer of westerns, who comes to Vienna at the request of his old friend Harry Lime. Unexpectedly, Lime turns out to be dead, and Martins begins to discover that his friend was not what he claimed to be but an immoral racketeer dealing with tainted penicillin on the black market. The rest of the story depends on plot twists too rich to divulge here, but suffice it to say that things are not what they appear. Problems for Martins are compounded by the political divisions of the city (Vienna was in four quadrants like Berlin); the limited disclosures of Major Calloway, a likeable British policeman on the Lime case and the allure of Lime's beautiful, mysterious lover Anna.<br /><br />Graham masters the treacherous turns of the script with his trademark humanism and spirited wit, and Reed brings a cinematic style that recalls not coincidentally Orson Welles's masterpiece, "Citizen Kane". Both films involve the precarious nature of male friendships and feature two of the same leading actors, Joseph Cotten and Welles himself. Working to represent the perspective of the curious viewer, Cotten is terrific in his career-best role as Martins. Welles shows up late and elliptically in the film as the central figure in the plot, but he makes every moment count, especially the suspenseful chase scene through the Vienna sewer system at the end. Eschewing the romantic yearning he displayed three years earlier in David Lean's "Brief Encounter", Trevor Howard plays Calloway sardonically but with a palpable sense of humanity. As Anna, Alida Valli provides a Dietrich-like sultriness that works, even though her thick accent gets in the way of some of Graham's deft dialogue.<br /><br />Another nod to Welles can be found in Robert Krasker's expressionistic cinematography full of deep shadows and off-kilter angles. It's masterful mood-setting work. The lengthy, melancholic last shot summarizes the story perfectly. Celebrating the film's fiftieth anniversary, the 1999 Criterion Collection DVD package provides a crisp print of the black-and-white film, equally impressive audio, an alternate opening which includes more of Holly's first-person narration, a couple of related radio shows with Cotten and Welles. This is a genuine film noir classic well worth your time.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>The Third Man (Carol Reed, 1949)<br /><br />Pauline Kael once said of Citizen Kane that it was the most fun you'd ever have watching a great film. I agree with the sentiment--I'm sure everyone has at least one movie they feel that way about--but for me, its recipient has always been Carol Reed's The Third Man, one of the many fine Graham Greene adaptations that's made its way to the screen (there are some authors whose work seems almost immune from being destroyed by bad adaptations, and Greene may well be one of them; of course, it helps that he adapted this one himself). No less an august body than the BFI called The Third Man the best British film ever produced. I'm not sure I'd go that far, but I just checked my list of the hundred best movies ever made, and only three British films rank higher. (None of them, I'm sure, has ever been mentioned by the BFI in remotely the same breath as this movie; my tastes tend to diverge from the crowd somewhat. And for the record, they're Richard Eyre's Iris (#11), Alan Parker's Pink Floyd: The Wall (#33), and Harry Bromley Davenport's XTRO (#36). The Third Man sits at #38.)<br /><br />Every film on my top 100 list is there for different reasons, but many of them share certain qualities. One of those is rewatchability; with very rare exceptions, it seems to me that one can't truly call a movie great if one can't imagine oneself watching it over and over again as time goes on, always deriving great pleasure from it. I've lost count of the number of times I've seen The Third Man over the years; certainly more than a dozen, probably closer to twoscore. It's a movie that has everything; a fantastic script, wonderful acting, a director and cinematographer who were both at the tops of their respective games, wonderful scenery, and, perhaps most strikingly, a rare star turn from the early career of Orson Welles in a movie he didn't direct.<br /><br />If you've somehow been in a cave for the past sixty years, here's a quick rundown of the plot: Holly Martins (Joseph Cotten), a hack writer, is summoned to Vienna, Austria, by his old school friend Harry Lime (Welles), who wants Martins to write some promotional materials for Lime's prescription drug business. Arriving there, however, he gets to Lime's apartment and finds out the man's just been killed in an auto accident. He manages to get to the funeral just in time, where he finds himself embroiled in a game of cat and mouse involving a couple of stiff-upper-lip British military police (Trevor Howard and Bernard Lee), Lime's beautiful girlfriend (Alida Valli), and two of Lime's shadier friends (Ernst Deutsch and Siegfried Breuer). Supposedly, the two friends were with Lime when he died, but the porter in Lime's building swears there was a third man helping to carry the body after the accident; who was the third man? And what if it wasn't an accident at all?<br /><br />This is the kind of mystery that no one knows how to do any more (with the arguable exception of Hideo Nakata, whose Chaos borrows, visually, from The Third Man more than once). Reed unravels the mystery here just as much visually as he does through Martins' detective work. The viewer is expected to pay attention, to see the mystery rather than simply learning about it through the characters' conversations. What was the last Hollywood mystery you saw that did such a thing? Not that a great mystery can't be done conventionally; both The Maltese Falcon and The Usual Suspects come to mind as examples. But The Third Man is, as far as I can tell, unique in the way Reed unfolds the story; it's not enough that Graham Green wrote (and adapted) a cracking good mystery, and that the casting director staffed it with such phenomenal actors, each of whom turns in a stunning performance. It's Reed's visual language that takes this out of the realm of the good and into the realm of the spectacular. Everyone remembers Orson Welles' cuckoo clock speech, to be sure, but everyone also remembers the climactic scene with those fingers sticking out of the sewer grate; how many times have you seen it used in a movie since? It's become part of the language of film. Or Cotten standing at the base of the Ferris wheel? There's a reason is shows up in those best-movies-ever TV shows all the time; it's become iconic. But it's not just those scenes, of course. The entire movie is chock full of incredible images like this. Just rent it, put it on the DVD player, sit back, and enjoy the spectacle of the thing. And if you happen to get caught up in the engrossing story and wowed by the acting, well, that's just icing on the cake sometimes. Graham Greene could turn out a mystery like no other, and The Third Man began the golden age of Carol Reed's career (aside from collaborating once again with Greene on the other best Greene adaptation ever, Our Man in Havana, he was also responsible for such classics as Trapeze, Oliver!, and The Agony and the Ecstasy); there is almost nothing wrong with this movie at all. (The one thing that always nags me, however, is Harry Lime's first spoken lines; Welles always did have a tendency to go for the overly theatrical...) If you've never seen it, run, do not walk, to your nearest video rental store and pick a copy up. One of the hundred best films ever made. **** ?</p></br><a href="../users/A2BPDFR58H9575.html">A2BPDFR58H9575</a><br/><p>Who was Harry Lime (Orson Welles)? An evil man, devil in the flesh who was responsible for the unspeakable crimes, yet brilliant, cheerful and charismatic. His most famous words, a short speech written by Welles himself, say a lot about his character and motivations:<br /><br />"In Italy for 30 years under the Borgies they had warfare, terror, murder, and bloodshed, but they produced Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, and the Renaissance. In Switzerland they had brotherly love - they had 500 years of democracy and peace, and what did that produce? The cuckoo clock."<br /><br />No wonder, we like him, even though we know what he'd done...<br /><br />It has been said thousands of times about the greatest movie entrance ever - but what about his 'exit' - the fingers on the street? I think it is one of the greatest, too...<br /><br />A beautiful mysterious girl with tragic past was in love with him and the unforgettable ending, so anti-Hollywood, so true to the film - was about her love that goes beyond the grave. I read that both Selznick (the producer) and author Graham Greene had initially argued for something more upbeat (Holly and Anna walking off arm-in-arm), but Reed disagreed. I am so happy that Reed won (I am sure millions of fans are, too). That was the way to finish the movie and make it much more than just typical noir. Makes the viewer think about love, friendship, betrayal, loyalty, the price one pays for them.<br /><br />Amazing film - perfectly shot; almost flawless. It looks and feels like Welles himself could've made it. The influence of Citizen Kane is undeniable. The only problem I had - the music. I like it but it was very strange to hear it in the film like The Third Man. Maybe that was a purpose - instead of somber, moody, and ominous music that would be expected for the noir film, something completely different and out of place - cheerful but melancholy in the same time...<br /><br />Criterion DVD is wonderful - the restored version of the film shines. There are two openings of the film available - British and American, and a lot of extras.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FRKEXDXDN1KI.html">A2FRKEXDXDN1KI</a><br/><p>In 1950, Carol Reed's "The Third Man" would gain worldwide recognition for its story, cinematography and it's soundtrack.  Winning the 1949 Grand Prix at the Cannes Film Festival, the film would win a British Academy Award for Best Film and an Academy Award for "Best Black and White Cinematography".<br /><br />Directed by Carol Reed (The Running Man", "Oliver!", "Follow Me"), "The Third Man" is an adaptation of a novela by Graham Greene ("The Quiet American", "Double Take", "Strike It Rich")  who also penned the original screenplay.  The film would feature music by Anton Karas and cinematography by Robert Krasker ("The Criminal", "Cry Wolf" and "The Quiet American").<br /><br />But the film would also receive top honors with the film being selected by the British French Institute as the best British Film of the 20th Century, 57th on the American Film Institute's list of top American films and  is regard by cinema fans as one of the great films made of all time.<br /><br />Although released on DVD from THE CRITERION COLLECTION in the past, the film has now underwent through modern restoration and was released on Blu-ray in Dec. 2008.<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />"The Third Man" is presented in 1080p High Definition with an aspect ratio of 1:33:1.  According to Criterion, "The picture has been slightly windowboxed to ensure that the maximum image is visible on all monitors.  On widescreen televisions, black bars will appear on the left and right of the image to maintain the proper screen format.  This high-definition digital transfer was created on a Spirit Datacine from a restored 35 mm time-grain master positive."<br /><br />As with most Criterion Blu-ray releases, the company also had thousands of instances of dirt, debris and scratches removed using the MTI Digital Restoration System.<br /><br />The picture quality, although in black and white, looks incredible for a film created in 1949.  Black are nice and deep but you can see a lot more detail in the surroundings.<br /><br />Suffice to say, THE CRITERION COLLECTION releases films with how the director intended the film to be.  There is no DNR (digital noise reduction) and no softness and the film keeps the grain and retains its film-like quality.  The film just looks beautiful on Blu-ray!  I didn't own the previous Criterion release on DVD, fans of the film have commented that this Blu-ray release features the definitive picture quality for the "The Third Man".<br /><br />Although Robert Krasker's cinematography was criticized at the time for using an tilted/angled view, fans have shown their appreciation for Krasker's artistic style.  I personally enjoyed the cinematography of the film.<br /><br />As for audio, the soundtrack was mastered at 24-bit from a 35mm optical soundtrack and audio restoration tools were used to reduce clicks, pops, hiss and crackle.  The audio has an uncompressed monaural soundtrack.  My Onkyo receiver received a multichannel signal (via bitstream) but overall, audio dialogue is understandable and clear.

For one, the talents were well-cast, the cinematography and the amount of cuts and smooth editing was fantastic, the music was memorable and most of all the storyline was well-planned.<br /><br />Because the film took place right after World War II, the destruction of Vienna and what was going on at the time with people having to sell their jewelry and belongings just to get bread and butter due to the heavy rationing at the time is captured.  The penicillin stolen from American medical areas and were meant to take care of the wounded and sick but being sold in the black market and that story of racketeering is captured in the film.  Also, how Vienna was separated into four zones is integrated into the storyline of the film through the various shots of key locations was well-planned.<br /><br />So, in some sense, this film is also a snapshot of a time in history and why it remains so popular in the minds of many cinema fans but also a sign of pain for some who live in Austria and seeing how things were at the time the film was being shot.  Even many historians on Vienna's history are impressed of how much the film captures that difficult time in Vienna history and also has actual footage from that time.<br /><br />But there are just so many memorable scenes that stick in my head.  From the music (which was #1 in the charts and started a zither craze) to certain shots where shadows were effectively used, Vienna was well integrated into the film and who can forget the child screaming after his father is killed and trying to place the blame on the wrong person.  Or even the final shot of the film.  There are so many moments in this film that stay strong in your head.<br /><br />But what I found so fantastic about this release from THE CRITERION COLLECTION was the amount of bonus content.  It's one thing to get audio commentaries but two documentaries, radio shows and many more.  That's awesome to receive so much content for an older film such as "The Third Man".  Bonus content that actually is quite entertaining, especially when you find out how volatile things were behind-the-scenes.  Surprising to say the least.<br /><br />Overall, "The Third Man" is a film and a Blu-ray release worth having in your HD collection.  It's also important to note that because THE CRITERION COLLECTION has recently lost the rights to this film, if you want to own the definitive version of this film, you better get it now before the prices skyrocket for the Blu-ray or DVD release.<br /><br />"The Third Man - THE CRITERION COLLECTION" is highly recommended!</p></br><a href="../users/A2V3P1XE33NYC3.html">A2V3P1XE33NYC3</a><br/><p>Poor Orson Welles. My earliest memories of the man come from the 1970s and early 1980s, roughly the last ten or so years of his life. People told me he once had Hollywood in the palm of his hand, that he was a cinematic genius, and that his tempestuous relationships with the studios ruined his career. An impressive list of information pointing to a powerful man, wouldn't you say? Sadly, I heard these things when Welles was doing wine commercials to make ends meet. "We'll sell no wine before its time" doesn't evoke visions of a cinematic genius, that's for sure. Nor did his physical presence impress me all that much. Orson Welles, according to information I have seen, weighed nearly 350 pounds at one point and remained severely obese until the end of his life. I'm not knocking on people with weight problems, but it's just another example of how difficult it was for me to imagine the man as a Hollywood heavyweight (no pun intended). Then I grew up and watched some of his classic films, i.e. "Touch of Evil," "Citizen Kane," and the incredibly atmospheric "The Third Man." The glowing accolades started making a lot more sense. No wonder filmgoers love this guy's films; they're masterpieces in nearly every way.<br /><br />"The Third Man" takes place in the shattered ruins of post-World War II Vienna. Holly Martins (Joseph Cotton), an alcoholic hack who bangs out western novels, arrives in town to a mystery greater than anything he ever wrote about. His old friend Harry Lime (Orson Welles) sent him a letter some time before offering him a job in Vienna, but Martins discovers when he gets there that his pal recently perished in an unfortunate traffic accident. The writer shows up in time to witness Lime's funeral and to meet his buddy's beautiful girlfriend Anna Schmidt (Alida Valli). He also runs afoul of the British occupation force, especially Major Calloway (Trevor Howard), a man who has nothing nice to say at all about Harry Lime. In fact, Calloway insists that Martins leave town immediately, much to the writer's consternation. Fortunately for Holly, a local reading group discovers he is an author and invites him to give a lecture a few days down the road. This gives Martins an excuse to stick around and investigate the increasingly suspicious nature of his old friend's passing. Questions about how the accident unfolded bring conflicting answers from witnesses. Anna Schmidt, who faces a possible expatriation to the Soviet Union's sector of the city, provides few answers to Martins's questions. Something sinister is going on in Vienna, and Holly Martins wants to get to the bottom of it.<br /><br />I'm not spoiling a thing by saying that Harry Lime never perished in that traffic accident. Why he staged his own passing, and how Holly Martins discovers the ruse, is the central element of "The Third Man." It turns out Lime is involved in a particularly loathsome black market scheme, along with several unsavory European characters, that threaten the health of Vienna's children. Calloway shows Martins up close what Lime's handiwork has done to the city's youths. The British have been on Lime's trail for ages, and that is why he doesn't want Holly Martins lurking around Austria. Once the British officer knows that the writer isn't about to condone what his friend is doing, he lets him in on the case and tries to use Martins to bring Lime out of the woodwork. There are only two things complicating the search for Harry Lime: Martins falls in love with Anna Schmidt and Lime is one slick operator who isn't about to go down without a fight. When the two old friends finally meet on a Ferris wheel, the encounter turns into a memorable exposition on the merits of right and wrong. Despite Lime's blithe belief in what he's doing for a buck, his time is about to run out. Holly Martins can't save his friend even as he cannot convince Anna to give up her love for Harry. The two sequences at the end of the film, the sewer chase and the funeral scene, will stay you with for eons.<br /><br />What's not to like about this movie? Try as I might, I can't think of anything I would want to see changed. The performances are magisterial, the dialogue transcendent, and the set pieces perfectly match the sordid storyline. Repeatedly, memorable scenes march across the screen. The shadow of the guy with the balloons looming on the buildings, the vividness of the wet cobblestones in the nighttime street scenes, and the hunted look on Harry Lime's face as the authorities corner him in the sewer like the rat he is all stick in the memory banks with the tenacity of molasses. Just as memorable is Anton Karas's zither score, an odd choice for a noir film yet a tune that fits the story perfectly and will have you humming for weeks afterwards. The question I ought to ask should go something like this: what I can say about this marvelous picture that hasn't been said by others a million times before? No one with an ounce of appreciation for the cinematic form, regardless of their personal favorites, can deny the beauty and power of this film.<br /><br />Criterion goes above and beyond the call of duty with their DVD version of the film. Supplements are plentiful and lengthy: an alternate opening voice narration track, footage of Anton Karas playing the movie's theme on his famous zither, a short documentary about how the Viennese police patrol their extensive sewer system, an introduction by Peter Bogdanovich, episodes from Welles's Harry Lime radio show, and much more. The picture quality looks great, the sound quality is very nice, and the movie is a masterpiece. Don't wait as long as I did to see this phenomenal picture; it's every bit as good as you've heard.</p></br><a href="../users/A3CFT5LHFCB46K.html">A3CFT5LHFCB46K</a><br/><p>After hearing so many great things about this movie, I decided one day to take the initiative and buy the Criterion Collection DVD of The Third Man. Since I hadn't seen the movie before (Except for clips on the AFI's broadcast of the most thrilling movies), some might call this a mistake. I call it a good, though not wise, investment. <p>Holly Martins (Joseph Cotten) goes to Post World War II Vienna to visit his friend Harry Lime (Orson Welles). After he arrives, however, he finds that Harry had been killed a few days before. Holly investigates into Harry's death, only to find himself entrapped in murder, racketeering and visits of friends from beyond the grave. He also finds that he has fallen in love with Lime's ex-girl Anna (Alida Valli). <p>The Third Man is a rare perfect marriage of performances, cinematography and music. Cotten is excellent in his role as Martins, while the rest of the supporting cast (Especially Valli as Lime's ex-girlfriend and Trevor Howard as British Major Calloway) are just as good. The Oscar winning cinematography of Robert Krasker is superb in the way it brings to life the darkness of Vienna. It brings a sense of depth and realism to the movie. A viewer feels like putting their hand on screen and touching the water soaked walls. Could a similar feeling have been reproduced if the whole movie was filmed on soundstages? But what the movie is probably best known for is Anton Karas's Zither score. The themes of it are difficult to explain. Sometimes the music is happy and cheerful and other times we feel a sense of sorrow. Some thought of it as a mistake that the music of the entire movie should be done with one instrument. Today, it's unthinkable without it.<p>Criterion has always been known for their quality and they don't disappoint with The Third Man. The picture has been digitally restored to where it looks as new as anything being made today. It might possibly be newer. The sound is perfectly clear. In fact you'll be adjusting the volume to lower the sound. The supplements are also excellent. First, there is a restoration demonstration, which will make one appreciate much more how much care Criterion put into this movie. Then there is vintage newsreel footage of the Vienna Sewer Police as they perform their duties in the film's famous sewer location and footage of Anton Karas performing &quot;The Third Man theme&quot; at a club (Reportedly in the same way he was found by director Carol Reed). There are production notes that cover many aspects of filming the movie and have some interesting trivia. There is also an interview with director Peter Bogdanovich and an alternate opening voice over for the American release. The main extra highlights though are two radio broadcasts: Orson Welle's presenting &quot;A Ticket to Tangiers&quot; from The Lives of Harry Lime and a radio presentation of The Third Man. <p>Criterion has overall made an excellent DVD and should be applauded for it. Buy it, watch it, cherish it and listen to Welles' famous speech: <p>&quot;In Italy for 30 years under the Borgias they had warfare, terror, murder, and bloodshed, but they produced Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, and the Renaissance. In Switzerland they had brotherly love - they had 500 years of democracy and peace, and what did that produce? The cuckoo clock.&quot;</p></br><a href="../users/A3APW42N5MRVWT.html">A3APW42N5MRVWT</a><br/><p>Indeed a masterpiece. Subtly disturbing, creative framing. A score seeming at odds with the tone of the film but which ends up heightening the tension as a result. Fine performances. A must-see film.</p></br><a href="../users/A16GAIJJE39T1S.html">A16GAIJJE39T1S</a><br/><p>Joseph Cotton is wonderful as Holly Martins, an out of work writer of pulp cowboy novels who finds out from an old friend about a job that has opened up for him in 1948 Vienna Austria.  The intoxicating atmosphere of this film noir gem owes much to the musical score laid down by zither virtuoso Anton Karas, as well as iconic scenes made possible by Vienna landmarks.  There is also the intrigue of a city partitioned by the Allied powers in the fashion of Berlin--I remember as a student visiting the monument to the Russian liberation!  It seems that the hero's old friend has gotten mixed up in the smuggling of the precious penicillin upon which such many lives depend, and is now suspiciously reported as dead (or is he?).  Holly is soon hot on the trail of the malevolent beings thought to be responsible for these alleged crimes.  His search leads to an encounter with his nemesis, in a car of the Rad (the giant Viennese ferris wheel) perched dangerously high above the city, that is saturated with lethal menace.  Even Holly's surprise invitation to the prestigious Viennese Literary Society (supposedly for the benefit of those intrigued by pulp cowboy fiction) is full of troubling questions.  The final scene as the hero views the girl who has captivated him, as she strolls indifferently by down the lane though the Vienna Woods, is practically a movie into itself.</p></br><a href="../users/A22RY8N8CNDF3A.html">A22RY8N8CNDF3A</a><br/><p>"The Third Man" was made in 1949 showing the Black Market thriving in Austria as Europe struggled to rebuild.  The music throughout was "The Third Man Theme" with the zither's upbeat circus-like twang ringing oddly between the film's dark and shadowy black and white murder mystery.<br /><br />Unemployed pulp mystery novelist, Holly Martins (Joseph Cogtten) arrives in post-world-war II Vienna, hoping to live with a childhood friend Harry (Orson Wells).  Holly is "between books" and has little income, so he is grateful when his friend offers him room and board in Vienna, as well as a one-way airline ticket to get there.  When he arrives, Holly learns that his friend Harry has died in an accident.  He is in time for the burial and arrives at the graveyard confused and shocked at the events.  Compelled to investigate the death, Holly slowly uncovers startling revelations about Harry's life.<br /><br />The visuals alone make this film (DVD) worth owning.  The movie dragged a little in the beginning and Orson Wells does not appear until after about an hour of viewing.  Many questions arise during the first part that are chewed over with looks and glances, but no real "grab" to the viewer.  After Orson Wells appears there is more action and interest.<br /><br />There are a lot of dark corners, nighttime chases on cobblestone streets as well as beneath Vienna's rubble in sewer labyrinths.  The close-ups and angles give the film a touch of class as the mystery unfolds.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z.html">A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z</a><br/><p>Unfortunately, ELP and LP-recorded budget-label VHS tapes don't do proper justice to such a superb motion picture, thus this product is NOT recommended.<br /><br />Orson Welles once explained to Peter Bogdonovich that a true star role is one where others talk about an unseen person for 45 minutes before he finally appears. Perhaps Welles was defining in this bit of philosophy his own status as Harry Lime in THE THIRD MAN.<br /><br />It's difficult to think of Harry as a star role, for the man is an unmitigated and unrepentant scoundrel who sold diluted penicillin to hospitals-- tampered-with medicine that caused the death or permanent disabling of dozens of children and adults. Even as Harry looks down from the height of a Ferris wheel at ant-sized people he expresses to friend Holly Martins (Cotten) his disdain and unconcern for humanity. Lime is a classic sociopath, and yet the "star" of this Carol Reed picture? No, that honor must go to Mr. Cotten, who's in almost every scene and raises a fine movie to the level of a genuine classic.<br /><br />Original zither music by Anton Karas is unforgettable as is cinematography of war-scarred Vienna, battered but still beautiful and at times forbidding. Kudos to Alida Valli as a Czech refugee actress who fears deportation by the Russians. Her unshakeable devotion to Harry defines blind love and makes this girl easiest to sympathize with. Trevor Howard brings to his British major a perfect mix of business-like military demeanor and well-masked concern. Minor characters like a so-called 'Baron' and other shady types keep Holly and us always on our toes.<br /><br />This noir classic well deserves its Top 100 Movie status. Highly recommended to all!<br /><br />Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 imdb viewer poll rating.<br /><br />(8.5) THE THIRD MAN (UK-1949) - Joseph Cotten/Alida Valli/Orson Welles/Trevor Howard/Bernard Lee/Paul H&ouml;rbiger/Ernst Deutsch/Wilfrid Hyde-White (uncredited: Lee Strasberg)<br /><br />Two years before his turn in THE THIRD MAN, Orson Welles directed <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004W229">THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI</a> (DVD).

In 1954 I was stationed in Vienna with the U.S. military police company that included the International Patrol featured in the movie. Seeing the streets I knew so well was a treat. I saw the movie in 1949 and like many others was captivated by the Anton Karas's zither title theme and music from the movie.<br /> What makes this a classic motion picture?--the superb acting (particularly Joseph Cotton, Orson Welles, Trevor Howard, and Alida Valli), the flashes of humor (witness the Wilfred Hyde-White scenes), the gripping black and white photography, the suspense, the chase sequences (especially the one with the little boy chasing and accusing the couple through the dark streets), the use of ominous shadows, the build-up of the mystery of the third person at the death scene, the use of Vienna as a major player, and the innovative zither sound track.<br /> Also: the great direction by Carol Reed surpassing Hitchcock's similar work, the love interest, the enormity of Harry Lime's crime in human terms, the little insights into characters (Baron Kurtz and Dr. Winkel were probably lovers), the police procedural component (the British military police), and Graham Greene's great script based upon his novel. Like other golden movies, it is able to draw you into its being so you get completely enveloped in it like a Venus fly trap. Great movies transport you into their world.<br /> Some footnotes: The movie has some eccentric characters as side effects. Reed focuses on little details that catch the viewer's attention like Lime's cat. The sleazy Casanova Club is part of the Viennese backdrop. Lime is a boy who "never grew up." Popescu says, "Everybody ought to be careful in a city like this." Lime hides in the shadows, and Cotton is unaware of it as he says, "Come out, come out, whoever you are." The giant ferris wheel in the Prader was a sight I had to see and ride for myself after having seen it in the movie. The chase in the sewers stays with you long after you have seen the movie.<br /> It's a movie I never tire of.</p></br><a href="../users/AGI3VJ0I04QO7.html">AGI3VJ0I04QO7</a><br/><p>I have the criterion single disc so wont be purchasing this double disc just fo the extra 90 minute doco.

That's the one everyone remembers, but in truth Graham Greene, a wry British post-modern wrote the screenplay.  He had Kim Colby, Stalin's, suave foreign office spy in mind.  Carol Reed directed a very Citizen Kane like film in the ruins of 1946 Austria.  Everyone will recognize the unusual film angles, scene cuts, and black and white shadows as Orwellian.  However, I'm taking nothing away from Reed.  This film is as good a European Film Noir as you'll find.  The film glides effortlessly till the ending in the sewers under Vienna.<br /><br />Cotton plays the naive American that arrives in Vienna to take up a job with a flamboyant, immoral, schoolboy friend, Harry Lime (Welles).  However, Harry Lime in reality is running a black market scheme in stolen penicillin, which results in the death of hundreds of innocents.  Cotton learns Harry has been killed in a suspicious car crash.  Cotton then runs into Trevor Howard, a British Military, Lime's girlfriend, actress Alida Valli, and assorted suspicious characters.  Nothing is what it seems and Cotton is soon involved in international intrigue.  A mandolin plays in the background and it's very unsettling.<br /><br />Films about the gray area between good and evil and the unintentional foolishness of do-gooders are not easy to complete without created cardboard characters, but there's no need to fear for The Third Man is damn near perfect, one of the best films ever made.</p></br><a href="../users/AHABFECTNE15I.html">AHABFECTNE15I</a><br/><p>Version: U.S.A / Criterion / Region A<br />Aspect ratio: 1.33:1<br />MPEG-4 AVC / BD-50 / AACS / High Profile 4.1<br />Running time: 1:45:13<br />Movie size: 27,23 GB<br />Disc size: 43,30 GB<br />Total bit rate: 34.51 Mbps<br />Average video bit rate: 30.48 Mbps<br />Subtitles: English SDH<br />Number of chapters: 23<br /><br />LPCM Audio  English  768 kbps  1.0 / 48 kHz / 768 kbps / 16-bit<br />Dolby Digital Audio  English  192 kbps  1.0 / 48 kHz / 192 kbps<br />Dolby Digital Audio  English  224 kbps  1.0 / 48 kHz / 224 kbps<br />Dolby Digital Audio  English  224 kbps  1.0 / 48 kHz / 224 kbps<br /><br />#Video introduction by writer-director<br />#Two audio commentaries<br />#Shadowing "The Third Man" - Making of (2005 - 90 mins)<br />#Abridged recording of Graham Greene's treatment<br />#Graham Greene: The Hunted Man, 1968 episode of the BBC's Omnibus series<br />#Who Was the Third Man? - Austrian documentary(2000 - 30 mins)<br />#The Third Man on the radio: the 1951 "A Ticket to Tangiers"<br />#Production history / behind-the-scenes photos, original UK press book<br />#U.S. trailer<br />#Actor Joseph Cotten's alternate opening voice-over narration for the U.S. version<br />#Archival footage of postwar Vienna<br />#A look at the untranslated foreign dialogue in the film<br />#Liner notes booklet</p></br><a href="../users/AXQ8T2D9IT6UG.html">AXQ8T2D9IT6UG</a><br/><p>"The third man" is a CLASSIC, in capital letters. That is, one of those few films everybody that loves well-made movies should watch at least once. Directed by Carold Reed, and based on a script written by Graham Green, this film has action and a mystery, but also some romance, and a beautiful cinematography that you cannot help but admire. In my opinion, this is simply the kind of movie you will not be able to forget, if you give yourself the opportunity of watching it.<br /><br />The story begins when a novelist without a dime, Holly Martins (Joseph Cotten), arrives to Vienna in search of a job his friend Harry Lime (Orson Welles) has promised him. Unfortunately, he learns from the police that Harry has died in dubious circumstances, and that he was involved in criminal activities. Refusing to believe that, Holly decides to investigate what really happened to Harry, in order to restore his reputation. But can knowledge be a dangerous commodity in post World War II Vienna?<br /><br />On the whole, I think you will love this splendid noir movie, and that you will be fully immersed in the mistery of "The third man" as soon as you begin watching it. What will happen to Holly Martins in his search of truth? And who was Harry Lime? Those are answers that you will only find in this film, not in this review. I can promise you something, though: you will not find it boring!<br /><br />Belen Alcat</p></br><a href="../users/A2RH7ARWQSUVQV.html">A2RH7ARWQSUVQV</a><br/><p>Harry Lime--a wonderful man by almost everyone's estimate--has died in a very ordinary traffic accident in Vienna.  His best friend, Holly Martin [Joseph Cotton], can hardly believe that such a great man has died in such an ordinary way, starts a one-man investigation opposed by the British occupation police, personified in the Major [Trevor Howard].<br /><br />There's a mysterious beautiful woman--Harry's mistress--who grieves pitifully at the loss of her lover.  Holly tries to console her but the woman is riven by grief and spends much of the film in tears.<br /><br />The film is dark and brooding.  The effects of lighting and angle are superb.  Vienna is still larely wrecked by Allied bombing and many of the scenes show a background of rubbled buildings on which workmen are laboring exactly like busy ants.  This depersonalization of human beings plays into the film.  Turns out that Harry wasn't quite the savant his friend, Holly, thought him to be.  Harry was the brains behind an opperation in which limited Penicillin supplies are diluted and sold to doctors, hospitals and clinics with the results that patients, including children with meningitis, are damaged or die.<br /><br />From a ferris wheel, Harry explains his philosophy to Holly.  I'll paraphrase.  'See those dots down there [meaning people].  What difference does it make if they keep on moving or are blotted out?  Remember the Italian Wars?  They went on for hundreds of years and produced Michelangelo, da Vinci and the Renaissance.  The Swiss, at the same time, had 500 years of democracy and produced the---Cuckoo Clock.'<br /><br />The last scene, by the way, is very 'unHollywood' and is one of the great scenes in cinema.</p></br><a href="../users/A16XRPF40679KG.html">A16XRPF40679KG</a><br/><p>I have seen some other blu ray editions of older black and white movies and they are all pretty good. This one is also pretty good, however the print as pointed out before is grainy. In fact I would say that hd does bring out the grain in any movie that were shot that way. This movie was cleaned up though from it's damaged shape that existed before,  and is the same print that you'd get on the standard edition , this one is clearer than the standard edition and if it were still in print I would still say that you are better off with this blu ray edition than the standard dvd one.  However, I would not spend 58.00 to get this one because people are selling it as a rare item now.  It's not worth the extra money over a standard version because of this.  It was worth it at 20.00 or so used over a standard priced dvd; however now that it's out of print I would say hold off unless you must have this as a blu ray edition in your collection. The film itself is one of the cinemas most influential movies and is a true classic. That being said avoid the blu ray version unless it comes back into print because the clarity is better but the grain of this movie really comes out on this version. I didn't mind it because I didn't pay some seller a overprice on it.  I have read that other criterion blu rays are less grainy so it's this print that was shot that way probably.  However if you can get a cheaper copy of this one on blu ray then grab it.  This edition has the same bonus features including the alterante opening, several radio shows featuring Orson Welles and the Harry Lime character. And other features, It also gives a good impression of how shattered austria was after the world war but at least Austria had the soviets leave it and the whole country was allowed to become a democratic nation.  The underrated Joseph Cotton also shines in this movie and it's one of his best performances.  This movie is a masterpiece well worth owning in your collection but you can't expect the type of blu ray clarity that a modern movie has. However I do agree that grain should be removed from older movies if possible. But it is a better looking print than any that have been around for a long time.</p></br><a href="../users/ASHT96DUVMF1S.html">ASHT96DUVMF1S</a><br/><p>When I throw a penny in the wishing well I wish Hollywood could make movies half as good as The Third Man.  This movie is written and directed so well. Many scenes stand out in my mind like the Ferris wheel, and the sewer chase.  Criterion collection has made this film enjoyable. The picture is almost flawless. I don't think this movie could work in color.  The black and white scenes work to enhance the streets and the sewer along with cinematography.  This is a classic and should be watched by anyone calling themselves a movie fan.</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>If you want to enjoy great camera-work, please see this movie on the Criterion DVD. That's not a plug for the company. It's just that no one else has ever offered a cleaner version of this film. After suffering for years with lousy VHS transfers of this gem, it was nice to see it given justice.<br /><br />To me, the visuals here make this DVD worth owning because the story is okay, but nothing super. To an average first-time viewer, the first hour of this film can drag. I found that to be the case on my first viewing, but the more I watch this, the better the story seems to have gotten for some reason. Despite his billing, Orson Welles has a small role in here. He doesn't even appear until after 65 of the film's 104 minutes have elapsed. Meanwhile, Joseph Cotten dominates the story, along with Alida Valli, sort of a poor man's Ingrid Bergman. Those two are okay but the story picks up dramatically after Wells finally appears.<br /><br />In addition to the fabulous cinematography, an unique feature of this movie is the music, which is very strange for a film noir. It's lighthearted music from a zither, almost circus-like in its sound and melody....but I liked it. It helps make this movie different.<br /><br />The visuals involve a lot of nighttime photography, lots of shadows and cobblestone streets. The tilted camera angles and the closeups - all traits of Wells the director, are here to enjoy</p></br><a href="../users/A20EEWWSFMZ1PN.html">A20EEWWSFMZ1PN</a><br/><p>This is one of those films that everyone thought he/she saw.

However, you can see the different versions compared on the DVD extras. Speaking about extras, one of the best extra  is that of the abbreviated play being read voice-over the film.  I defiantly ordered the book.<br /><br />This film is presented in black and white.  You can see how tight the presentation is without a wasted word or glance. The Music is also one of the main characters of the film.  I only remember the Blu-ray version so I cannot tell the quality of the other versions.<br /><br />Even though the book looks from the view of Major Calloway (Trevor Howard in the film) and the film from the view of Holly Martins, it is the character of Sergeant Paine (Bernard Lee) that we find endearing.<br /><br />Holly Martins (Joseph Cotton) an out of work novelist (Westerns) is offered a job in post war Vienna by his friend Harry Lime (Orson Welles). When Holly arrives he finds he is late for Harry's funeral. The authorities are besmirching Harry's memory. Harry's girl (Alida Valli) after hearing of a mysterious third man at Harry's car accident suggested that Harry's death may not have been an accident.<br /><br />Now it is up to Holly to clear Harry's name.

The application of the camera upon the storytelling process is a truly eye-opening experience; the angles, the lighting, etc., is truly inspiring.  However, when the camera takes on a more traditional position in several scenes woven into the tale of Harry Lime, the narrative arguably grinds to a halt.

Cotton plays Holly Martins, the long time American friend of Orson Wells' character, Harry Lime. Martins shows up in Vienna and ends up attending Lime's so-called funeral. Quickly, everyone in the cast seems suspicious. Martins starts asking questions to several people who witnessed the truck accident that supposedly took Lime's life. When the stories don't match, Martins decides to spend a little more time in Vienna to investigate. Along the way he meets the beautiful Anna Schmidt (played by Alida Valli) and falls for her. As the police and neighbors try to get Martins out of town... Martins sees Harry Lime alive and well in the shadowy streets. As quick as he can blink, Harry disappears and the chase is off thru the beautiful streets of Vienna. The climax comes when the chase goes down into the sewers underground with Martins and a whole squad of police chasing Harry down. This is a film Hitchcock would have loved to have his name on. This black &amp; white film is beautifully shot... lighting, intense shadows, old classic European architecture in the background, a larger than life ferris wheel, great cast, great acting... and a movie filled with suspense, love, and a whole lot of deception. Cotton is superb throughout. Wells doesn't show up until you're well into the 2nd half of the movie. The 1941 classic &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;, or &quot;A Touch Of Evil&quot;, or maybe &quot;The Stanger&quot; are better films featuring Orson Wells... but, Wells has such a huge presence on the screen that he steals the show almost every time. As good as Wells is here, I still believe Cotton's performance is equally on par with Wells. Look for Cotton in other classics like &quot;Deul In The Sun&quot; (with Jennifer Jones), &quot;Niagara&quot; (with Marilyn Monroe), &quot;Othello&quot; (with Wells), &quot;Soylent Green&quot; (with Charlton Heston), and as one of the main characters with Wells in &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;. The extras include original trailers, old footage of the real &quot;sewer police&quot; in action, &quot;Third Man&quot; radio broadcast, and the treatment of the film being remastered showing before and after examples of photos and movie footage. Great movie... yet still puzzled as to the expensive price.</p></br><a href="../users/A1M9DQDGE07Q0U.html">A1M9DQDGE07Q0U</a><br/><p>The Third Man was in a terrible state of disrepair before Criterion got their hands on it.  Unfortunately, this edition of the film suffers from extreme grain, digital and film, shimmering details and a rough appearance that still makes for a gritty viewing experience despite considerable restoration efforts.  Orson Welles is Harry Lime, a con artist who's black market insulin sales have either killed or crippled hundreds. Joseph Cotten is Lime's best friend and totally unaware of the scam.  The film is one of the post war cinemas greatest acheivements.  Unfortunately, it needs a more pristine transfer than this to make it worth the while and price that Criterion is asking.</p></br><a href="../users/AL4MKKO24563R.html">AL4MKKO24563R</a><br/><p>The Third Man is a wonderful atmospheric film set in postwar Vienna. There are so many great and thrilling scenes in this film: Orson Welles' entrance, the confrontation on top of the ferris wheel, the final chase through the sewers. As a suspense thriller alone, The Third Man is a very good film.<br /><br />However, for me, what makes The Third Man a great film is its tale of frustrated love. Joseph Cotten's Holly Martins is a good man who loves Alida Valli's Anna Schmidt. However, Anna loves Orson Welles' Harry Lime, an evil charmer who sells tainted black market penicillin, considers killing his best friend and would abandon the woman that loves him to save his own skin. Of the three major characters, Cotten's Martins is the one person who does the right thing. He does so reluctantly, although that reluctance stems from his loyalty to Harry and his love for Anna. Holly is the only person who really cares about Anna, but Anna rejects him in favor of Harry anyway. In the end, even though Holly is just doing the right thing, Anna hates him for betraying Harry and shooting him. The audience roots for Holly -- a rooting interest made even more poignant when, after Harry's funeral, Anna walks past Holly and out of his life.<br /><br />So many times, the movies portray love stories as happy endings. John Hughes made a career out of having the kind, awkward social misfit end up with the prom queen or the high school jock. But, in real life, the object of our affections many times can't recognize the person who really cares about them -- instead choosing a lover who isn't really interested in love. It's unfair, it hurts, but, unfortunately, it's life and those who are rejected have to pick up the pieces and try to find love somewhere else -- now saddled with the added element of self-doubt. Holly Martins represents all of us who seek love, but who struggle to find someone who will return that love.</p></br><a href="../users/AD2BIAIH78QI5.html">AD2BIAIH78QI5</a><br/><p>And with that half-considered remark by Valli, Joseph Cotten is struck as if by lightning and the zither music wells up into an impassioned frenzy. This is Sir Carol Reed's absolutely perfect film, "The Third Man", about a hapless American named Holly Martins (Cotten) who comes to postwar Vienna at the invitation of an old school chum, Harry Lime. What a surprise is in store for him when he is told that that very day is his friend's funeral, having been knocked down by a speeding automobile. Cotten does a marvelous job as a clutzy hero, trying to solve a murder nobody else believes was committed and trying also to win his school chum's girlfriend Anna (Valli) on the rebound. Excellent supporting cast including Trevor Howard as Calloway, the British officer in charge of the investigation, and a wonderful foreign cast. "The Third Man" was filmed on location among the ruins of Vienna following the Second World War, and uses very sophisticated camera work to convey a world Harley just can't master.

When he arrives, Lime is not there to greet him. Apparently, Lime was accidently killed after being hit by a car, and their &#65533;meeting&#65533; is at his funeral. The one discrepancy that bothers Martins is that in the official report, two men were said to have carried Lime from the street to the sidewalk, still alive at that point; but an eyewitness claims not only was Lime killed instantly, but another man--a third man--helped carry him. Martins, curious of the accident, begins to investigate and hears contradictary stories about the circumstances surrounding Lime&#65533;s death.<br /><br />Exactly how did Harry Lime die? That question is the engine driving the plot. The film constructs a picture of Lime through the comments of all those who knew him. Martins remembers Lime as a loyal friend. Lime had a girlfriend named Anna (Alida Valli), who speaks very highly of him. After all, he was the man she loved, and apparently still does. Anna&#65533;s unquestioning devotion paints the picture of Lime as a romantic. There is obviously something likeable about him, given the attitude Anna has for him and the way the tenants in the rooming house feel, but Calloway (Trevor Howard), the British officer in charge, says Lime was an evil man and advises Holly to take the next train home. He shows Martins the effects of Lime&#65533;s work in a hospital full of children dying from the watered-down vaccines that were part of the dead man&#65533;s &#65533;business enterprise&#65533;.  <p>This all makes for a fun, entertaining and intriguing thriller that may be implausible, but will keep you on the edge of your seat, anticipating all the twists that keep coming!</p></br><a href="../users/A26HFSVLAGULIM.html">A26HFSVLAGULIM</a><br/><p>PLOT ELEMENTS IN A NUTSHELL: [contains spoilers]<br /><br />Holly Martins (Joseph Cotten) is a hack, American pulp fiction writer, who arrives in Vienna just after the end of World War 2. Harry Lime (Orson Welles), his close friend, had promised him a job. Upon his arrival, Martins is shocked to learn that Lime has been killed in a traffic accident. In fact, Lime's funeral is taking place almost at that very moment. Martins meets the pleasant-enough-acting Major Calloway (Trevor Howard) and actress Anna Schmidt (Alida Valli) who is weeping rather conspicuously at the eulogy taking place at the gravesite. There the Major informs Martins that his deceased friend, Harry Lime, was a "thief" and a "murderer". Martins is at first outraged, like any loyal friend would be. Gradually, however, through the course of his own personal investigation, he realizes that Calloway is correct. Even more shocking, Martins eventually concludes that the man lying in the coffin in the film's early scenes was not his friend Harry Lime. Lime is still alive and, in fact, appears to have been the mysterious "third man" at the scene of the fatal accident where he [Lime] supposedly died.<br /><br />NOW WASN'T THAT PLOT QUITE A MOUTHFUL?:<br /><br />All of the above is the set-up for what the film is ultimately all about. We wait through roughly 2/3 of the film to meet Orson Welles in this movie and the question must be "was it worth the wait?"<br /><br />ORSON WELLES IS, WELL, ORSON WELLES:<br /><br />In any and all scenes, it seems, Orson Welles steals the show. In this movie, it happens most apparently on the ferris wheel where he more or less lays things out for his friend, Holly Martins. "Why can't Welles be in the whole film?" one might be tempted to ask. Perhaps it would be too much of a good thing, like putting too much sugar in one's tea or too much ice cream in one's ice cream float. Anyway, the film needs more of Orson Welles, but probably can't do that without an Orson Welles overdose or a rest-of-the-film underdose. I'm not sure, but it just seemed like Orson Welles really unbalances the film. When he's on, HE'S THE MAN and when he's not, HE'S MISSING! Sort of like Brando in the Godfather or Welles himself in CITIZEN KANE. Aha! Now we are on to something! THE THIRD MAN IS NOT CITIZEN KANE AND IT'S NOT THE GODFATHER. That's right. This film is not a cinematic masterpiece. Many reviewers rate "The Third Man" as 5-star entertainment, but it just lacks the depth and meaning of either of the aforementioned movies.<br /><br />SEE THE THIRD MAN AS A HALF-FULL RATHER THAN HALF-EMPTY GLASS:<br /><br />I felt exactly the same way about "The Wild One" with Brando and "A Touch Of Evil" with Welles. After contemplating this for a while, I realized that "The Third Man" is actually a lot like "A Touch Of Evil" and that Welles has really spoiled me with his sensational performance from start to finish in the equally-sensational film "Citizen Kane". After accepting that, I can now appreciate "The Third Man" and see the film (as well as Welles' role in it) as a half-full rather than half-empty glass.<br /><br />WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT:<br /><br />There is, at the climax, a rather dramatic chase scene in the Viennese sewers. We are left with the feeling that Europeans have a certain distaste for the simplistic view we Americans have toward the issues and problems that they [foreign nations] must deal with and overcome. Holly Martins embodies this common American attitude in the film and we should see the Viennese reaction to his character as the reaction toward Americans in general during this period in history.<br /><br />SO WHO'S IN THIS FLICK?<br /><br />ACTORS:<br /><br />Joseph Cotten  - Holly Martins<br />Alida Valli  - Anna Schmidt<br />Orson Welles  - Harry Lime<br />Trevor Howard  - Maj.

To my taste, This film is a little unnecessarily dark, stark, and dank, but that is no reason not to see it.

I believe it was written by Orson Welles himself. Graham Greene would never have been so flip, nor would he have inserted such an empty wisecrack. The line should have been: "In Italy for thirty years under the Borgias they had warfare, terror, murder, bloodshed. They produced Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci and the Renaissance. In Switzerland they had brotherly love, five hundred years of democracy and peace. And what did they produce  --- Albert Einstein. So long, Harry." Of course, it would have to have been said by Holly.<br /><br />The camera angles also seem to have been heavily influenced by Welles's Citizen Kane, but here they work much better, since they are mostly non-studio. After reading all the reviews, I'm amazed at how this picture divides opinion, and equally amazed by some of the remarks. I can't understand why Hitchcock keeps getting mentioned. This film is quite unlike anything by Hitchcock. Although I believe Greene and Hitchcock have the influence of the Roman Catholic church in common, which causes them both to be concerned with the question of guilt, Hitchcock is an out-and-out Freudian, which means he is not really interested in the morality of human motivation; whereas Greene doesn't appear to be a Freudian of any sort at all. His concern is with questions of good and evil: the choices facing humans when they are presented with a dilemma. What is right, and what is wrong. This film is superb in the way it presents these dilemmas. Cotten is absolutely ideal as the weak, undecided, ordinary man, fascinated by those who are more charismatic than himself, and stumbling in his attempts to discover the right decisions to make. James Stewart would have been nothing like as good. This film isn't about the Orson Welles character, it's about Holly Martin. Martin is himself the real third man, hovering between two extremes in a very grey area between black and white.<br /><br />The ending is exceptionally good, as the desirable woman walks straight past him, having come to her decision on purely emotional grounds, unaffected by the immorality, callousness or cynicism of the man she had committed herself to. Holly's feeble attempts to do the right thing leave him floundering. He would have done better, like everyone tells him, to fly straight back home and forget about the whole thing. After all, that's what most average Joes do: just ignore anything difficult or unpleasant, and look the other way. This is pure Graham Greene-land. It's not in any sense a thriller, or a suspense story, but an intellectual debate about right and wrong. Some of the comments by the reviewers on this site seem so mentally dense it makes one weep.<br /><br />Now that I've watched the really outstanding documentary on the second disc, with the commentary spoken by John Hurt --- a great actor --- I'm even more staggered by the out-and-out stupidity of some the site reviewers. This analysis of the film, and its making, shows up precisely what an intellectual jerk Selznick must have been, what a sucker-milking money-maker, just like Harry Lime himself, and how a huge percentage of Americans are simple-minded hicks, without the remotest conception of aesthetics, or the multi-layered meanings of Europe's two thousand years of history, culture and suffering.<br /><br />After watching Murnau's Faust, it becomes even clearer that, at the height of the ferris wheel, Welles has been cast as Satan tempting Everyman.</p></br><a href="../users/A1BA72K4VK1UN1.html">A1BA72K4VK1UN1</a><br/><p>Graham Greene originally wrote "The Third Man," a fine novel of intrigue about Post WW II Vienna, Austria, when the city, for a time, was divided up amongst frequently adversarial "Allies".<br /><br />In both the book and the movie, a man named Holly Martin (Joseph Cotten) is down on his luck -- a well-to-do acquaintance in Vienna, Harry Lime (Orson Wells), sends him passage to this city of possible opportunity in which Holly envisions a lot of promise... but when Holly arrives in Vienna, his pal, Harry, is being buried! The ambiance of the book/film is that of political intrigue combined with a murder mystery.<br /><br />I'll summarize this film up front: Here, we have yet another bizarre film associated with Orson Wells. Yes, the film has been highly acclaimed in the past by critics as being "artful"... but this movie fails utterly for the average viewer today.<br /><br />The transitions from one scene to the next are very abrupt. This is quite distracting. Also, they've taken Greene's clear, straightforward story and made it notably incoherent. And it's clear that a huge priority for Orson Wells was to focus upon his personal "surprised-look-profile" for whatever time he's on screen -- his personal vanity ultimately dominates the story. The film climaxes in a multi-national foot chase through the active underground sewers of Vienna which drags on for much too long.<br /><br />The worst facet of this flick is the weird filmscore -- the director decided to have the entire filmscore rendered by some guy who singularly played old Bavarian pub songs on a Zither! Don't know what a Zither is? It's the only musical instrument that is actually more noxious than an accordion! The end product is that the music comes off as distracting and totally inappropriate to the various dramatic scenes.<br /><br />Finally, I DO need to point out that Joseph Cotten's performance in this film was indeed very good. Unfortunately, he had little with which to work.<br /><br />You might wish to view this film as a curiosity but, beyond that, you're probably going to be shaking your head at what they did to Graham Greene's fine volume of period literature.</p></br><a href="../users/A2F3M93RRLFQNJ.html">A2F3M93RRLFQNJ</a><br/><p>I enjoy a good suspense movie and especially enjoy the works of Hitchcock.  When I finally had an opportunity to watch The Third Man, I was prepared to be delighted, having heard so many good things about the movie.  Unfortunately, I found the movie to be just okay and far from spectacular.<p>There were three essential flaws in this film. For one thing, Joseph Cotten, the hero of the story, is basically unlikable and his motivation to find the killer of his friend Harry Lime hardly is enough to motivate the viewer to care.  Secondly, the musical score is not only the same basic tune throughout the movie, it has no relation to the mood of the scene and in fact, its light tone often contradicts the seriousness of the scene.  Finally, this is a movie that is overdirected, with some shots at strange angles for no special reason.  Probably Carol Reed's direction is in fact the main flaw that is responsible for the other two.<p>The story itself is okay, written by Graham Greene who adapted it from his own novel.  Some of the scenes do look nice and the look of postwar Vienna is appropriately glum. Nonetheless, this seems like someone trying to make a Hitchcock movie without really succeeding.  Perhaps in some alternate universe, Hitchcock did direct this movie and it turned out well; in this universe, however, we must settle for this one.</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>Who is Harry Lime? As his writer friend Holly Martin (Joseph Cotton) discovers when he arrives in Vienna to meet up with his old friend and college chum Harry became quite a different person than he was earlier in their friendship. He's also either dead or simply vanished and Holly decides he must find out what happened to Lime and who he truly was.<br /><br />Carol Reed's brilliant film of Graham Greene's post-War novel quickly turns into an existential noir mystery capturing the creepy look and feel of post WWII Vienna which has become a black cauldron of pararnoia as the Americans, British and Russians occupy the city each trying to outwit the other.<br /><br />This reissue from StudioCanal/Lion's Gate is inferior looking to the superb brief release by Criterion (before their license was up). That transfer was crisp looking with considerable repair work done in the digital realm to the film while the transfer itself was sharper with solid blacks, great fine detail considering the age of the film and grain management wasn't over-the-top. This edition features the over use of digital noise reduction often smoothing out the noir look of the film by robbing it of its atmospheric grain resulting in the images looking a bit softered and smeared.<br /><br />The audio isn't as clear or as consistent as the Criterion release; you can hear the pops and imperfections from the original analog soundtrack here whereas Criterion smoothed those out removing them and also did some leveling so that the dialogue and music is consistent throughout in terms of volume neither of which is the case with this new edition of the film.<br /><br />That isn't to say that the StudioCanal/Lion's Gate version is horrible; "The Third Man" looks decent although there's evident damage to the print that hasn't been repaired that crops up throughout the movie. Compared to the Criterion edition from 2008, the StudioCanal/Lion's Gate version is inferior in every way but not a bad presentation of the film by any means and is worth the upgrade if you are a hugh fan of the film.<br /><br />The extras here are different than the Criterion edition. The Criterion had among other things a 90 minute excellent doucmentary that "shadowed" the making of this terrific film as well as the original treatment by Greene, a radio episode of Welles' excellent series "The Lives of Harry Lime", two exceptional audio commentaries for the film and press booklet materials and an hour program on writer Graham Greene.<br /><br />THIS edition has an excellent commentary track featuring Welles biographer and actor Simon Callow along with assistant director Guy Hamilton and script supervisor Angela Allen. It's a fairly lively and entertaining commentary track that covers everything from Greene's original script, issues they had shooting on location to working with Welles and Cotton (and disspelling some myths about Welles "directing" his own scenes). It's the best special feature here and kudos to StudioCanal/Lion's Gate for assembling it. I do wish more thought had gone into the other special features however.<br /><br />We get an interactive tour of post WWII Vienna, interviews with Joseph Cotton (from 1987) and Graham Greene as well as a 1951 episode of "The Lives of Harry Lime" entitled "A Ticket to Tangiers". The Lux radio adaptation of "The Third Man" and a featurette on the zither played by Cornelia Mayer who played the instrument in the film. We also get the alternate opening narration, stills and other minor extras.<br /><br />If you missed the chance to pick up the Criterion on Blu-ray, this edition is a good second choice. Although the film doesn't look quite as good in its presentation and while some of the extras are very similar we are missing the excellent 90 minute documentary on the making of the film as well as the other two audio commentary tracks from the Criterion, a 60 minute program on Greene and a 30 minute documentary from down under. Unlike the recent "The Stranger" on Blu-ray that was a public domain print, this edition of "The Third Man" is from similar elements (and perhaps the same print)as that provided to Criterion with just the clean up work and restoration that Criterion did missing here.<br /><br />Still recommended but if you have the Criterion--keep it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3H9JSM1SUTE4O.html">A3H9JSM1SUTE4O</a><br/><p>Film buffs have a reason to celebrate.<br /><br /> Carol Reed's "THE THIRD MAN," perhaps the most highly-regarded film in world cinema is now available in a jaw-dropping Blu-ray transfer.<br /><br />This wondrous movie has never looked better and it is hard to imagine anything more that could possible be done to improve the image quality.  It looks like a first viewing directly from the lab.  I doubt Carol Reed ever saw it in such a pristine condition!  The blacks are velvety and the grays and whites shimmer with a silvery sheen.  And the retro mono sound is sharp. This ultimate edition deserves a special place in the digital library.<br /><br />The plot is minimal.  American pulp novelist Holly Martins (Joseph Cotton) travels to post WW II Vienna to see his friend Harry Lime (Orson Welles).  But instead ends up investigating the apparent death of the black market operator in a city of fractured, shadowy loyalties.  It is a tale that, on the surface, is about love, deception and murder.  The dark trinity of great noir mysteries.<br /><br />But it is not so much the plot that makes this remarkable film so highly-regarded but rather the extraordinary sense of time and place.  Graham Greene's acerbic dialogue seduces and cuts.  There's the brilliant black and white photography by Robert Krasker -- often slight askew and reminiscent of German expressionism.  And the audacious zither score by Anton Karas perfectly frames the mood and atmosphere of this unforgettable film that somehow burns itself into one's own experience.<br /><br />If the story is secondary, what is this film really "about"?  Perhaps it is about being lost in a fractured landscape where old ideals and values have evaporated.  Where meaning is ephemeral.  It is a post-modern amorality tale awash in the frisson of deception and cynicism of the time. The war's over -- now what?  How do we know what's real and true and good?  But whatever existential metaphors are embedded in the film, it is a hypnotically compelling exercise that is much more than the sum of it's masterful parts.  Unquestionably a great film as well as art.  A rare achievement indeed.<br /><br />This hi-def disc is a  transfer identical in content to the previous, restored, two-disc edition.<br /><br />The extras are generous and defined in the product description.</p></br><a href="../users/A13E0ARAXI6KJW.html">A13E0ARAXI6KJW</a><br/><p>Rarely has background music made such a transcendent impact on a film-going experience, but such is the case of Anton Karas's haunting zither in Carol Reed's 1949 dark thriller, a genuine classic of post-WWII deception and desperation. The sparkling, sylphlike strumming makes an ironic, dramatically effective counterpoint to the foreboding atmosphere of a bombed-out Vienna barely recovering from the war. There are many ironies embedded In the story, no surprise given that the screenplay is penned by novelist Graham Greene, whose best work reflects the pervasive moral ambiguities surrounding modern man and the moral ambivalence that complicates otherwise comfortable lives.<br /><br />The intricate story focuses on Holly Martins, a semi-renowned pulp fiction writer of westerns, who comes to Vienna at the request of his old friend Harry Lime. Unexpectedly, Lime turns out to be dead, and Martins begins to discover that his friend was not what he claimed to be but an immoral racketeer dealing with tainted penicillin on the black market. The rest of the story depends on plot twists too rich to divulge here, but suffice it to say that things are not what they appear. Problems for Martins are compounded by the political divisions of the city (Vienna was in four quadrants like Berlin); the limited disclosures of Major Calloway, a likeable British policeman on the Lime case and the allure of Lime's beautiful, mysterious lover Anna.<br /><br />Graham masters the treacherous turns of the script with his trademark humanism and spirited wit, and Reed brings a cinematic style that recalls not coincidentally Orson Welles' masterpiece, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CX9E">Citizen Kane</a>. Both films involve the precarious nature of male friendships and feature two of the same leading actors, Joseph Cotten and Welles himself. Working to represent the perspective of the curious viewer, Cotten is terrific in his career-best role as Martins. Welles shows up late and elliptically in the film as the central figure in the plot, but he makes every moment count, especially the suspenseful chase scene through the Vienna sewer system at the end. Eschewing the romantic yearning he displayed three years earlier in David Lean's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0780023420">Brief Encounter</a>, Trevor Howard plays Calloway sardonically but with a palpable sense of humanity. As Anna, Alida Valli provides a Dietrich-like sultriness that works, even though her thick accent gets in the way of some of Graham's deft dialogue.<br /><br />Another nod to Welles can be found in Robert Krasker's expressionistic cinematography full of deep shadows and off-kilter angles. It's masterful mood-setting work. The lengthy, melancholic last shot summarizes the story perfectly. Even though the Criterion Collection released an excellent fiftieth anniversary DVD just eight years ago in 1999, they have produced an even robust two-disc 2007 DVD package that will no doubt please followers of the classic film. Same as the 1999 DVD, the newer release provides a crisp print of the black-and-white film, equally impressive audio, an alternate opening which includes more of Holly's first-person narration and a couple of related radio shows with Cotten and Welles.<br /><br />The 2007 additions include an informative video introduction by filmmaker Peter Bogdanovich; an enthusiastic commentary track by director Steven Soderbergh and screenwriter Tony Gilroy; a second, more academic commentary track by NYU film professor Dana Polan; and an audio reading of Graham Greene's treatment for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0140286829">The Third Man</a> by actor Richard Clarke and played as an alternate track. One of the best extras is a ninety-minute 2004 documentary, "Shadowing the Third Man", where assistant director Guy Hamilton and script supervisor Angela Allen tour the film's locations in modern-day Vienna. There is also archival footage of composer Anton Karas playing his zither in a London supper club, as well as vintage newsreel footage of the Vienna sewers. This is a genuine film noir classic well worth your time.</p></br><a href="../users/ABN5K7K1TM1QA.html">ABN5K7K1TM1QA</a><br/><p>I'm not one to rave about "glorious black and white" cinematography.  Generally speaking, if it was good in black and white, it would be even better in color (although NOT colorized).  However, there are exceptions.  Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove would not be improved in color, and Orson Welles' Citizen Kane would not even work as well in color, partially because of the "Movietone" and front page photography feel that Welles wanted, but also because color would add nothing to the sharp focus on an ultimately empty icon of an entirely black and white medium.  And Sir Carol Reed's The Third Man is a strongly atmospheric film that clearly is better in black and white.  It might be said that if there isn't enough light, it is false to pretend to color.  Flowers that bloom at night are usually white.<p>It's Vienna, in a winter month, just after WWII.  The city is still in ruins and rubble, still occupied by Allied troops.  There is a forlorn sense of loss and waste hanging in the air like a dark blanket of gloom, and the citizens still suffer from a shortage of consumer goods and basic medicines; a good part of the economy is still driven by the black market.  Spring and a colorful rejuvenation seem remote.  And so the sharp black and white Oscar-winning cinematography of Robert Krasker, imaginative and deeply evocative of a great city in darkness, was perfect.  From the ornate facades of old buildings to the wet catacombs of the sewers to the suddenly illuminated face of a slyly smirking Orson Welles, the camera carries the story driven by the zither theme, played over and over again, sometimes loud and insistent, sometimes soft and yielding, commenting all the while like an ironic jester.<p>But The Third Man is more than brilliant cinematography set to a haunting melody.  The well-chosen cast, led by Joseph Cotton as an urban American who writes pulp Westerns, and Alida Valli (who followed this performance with a long career in the Italian cinema) as the misplaced Anna Schmidt, and Trevor Howard as British Major Calloway, and of course Orson Welles as the dark and mysterious Harry Lime, was excellent all around.  The script by Graham Greene from his novel of the same name is intelligent and compelling.  The editing and direction by Reed paced the story nicely, neither too sharply cut nor too drawn out because this is a film that demands both quick action sequences and moments of mirthless pause for mood and reflection.<p>This is a great film because almost everything was done right.  The result is a work of art that invades and sets up permanent residence in our psyches.  I saw this for the first time as a boy many years ago and it remained in my memory as the most mysterious and eerie movie I had ever seen.  Seeing it again in the twenty-first century only confirms the experience of that small boy.<p>This is included in the film noir canon, and indeed it represents itself well there.  But The Third Man is better understood as a film of stark realism as well as a mystery in the tradition of an older genre that accepts the common standards of human decency as right and correct (as Catholic Graham Greene believed them) and does not give way to amorality or the success of evil.  Harry Lime is a man of charm and character, of intelligence and worldly wiles, but he is also a man with a sociopathic personality and a callous disregard for human life other than his own.  It is giving away nothing to realize that such a man in Greene's world, in the world of the mystery story--like something from Agatha Christie, perhaps--will not succeed in the end.  But what actually does transpire in the end, indelibly marked by the final shot of Anna walking directly in the middle of the road between two matching lines of cold, leafless trees, is from the school of realism, a realism born of nearly a century of intermittent war and recurrent human tragedy for Vienna, for Austria, for most of Europe.  There is in this film no compromise with that truth.<p>See this for Orson Welles, the 25-year-old wunderkind director and star of Citizen Kane (1941), here in his early thirties, enjoying the supreme compliment of starring in a film in which are employed, in frank imitation of his work in Citizen Kane, some of his original cinematic techniques.</p></br><a href="../users/A39IY0JU5JI69G.html">A39IY0JU5JI69G</a><br/><p>Having just seen The Third Man, I feel that I must go back and subtract some stars from other films I've reviewed.  They do not belong in the same class as this one.<br /><br />It's extremely entertaining, it has a deep moral base, the acting is superb, it's visually awesome, and the music is like none other you've ever heard.  (How many films have a zither background?)<br /><br />I'm not going to retell the story as there are plenty of other reviewers doing that.  I just want to add my vote to this totally satisfying film.</p></br><a href="../users/A17FLA8HQOFVIG.html">A17FLA8HQOFVIG</a><br/><p>Adapted from Graham Greene's book which was written with a film in mind, Carol Reed did a masterful job of directing this 1949 film which won Academy Awards for film editing, black and white photography, and directing.  It's a bit of a masterpiece and holds the viewer in a suspended state of suspense, heightening the tensions as it moves swiftly along.<p>Starring Joseph Cotton as Holly Martin, an American who comes to Vienna at the request of an old college chum, Harry Lime, played by Orson Wells, the scene is set for intrigue from the very beginning.  Martins is immediately told that Harry Lime has been killed in an accident and that his funeral is in progress.  The plot thickens as he encounters a British policeman and learns that Harry might not have been such a nice guy after all.  Martin suspects murder and goes about investigating on his own, finding himself attracted to Lime's girlfriend, played by Alida Valli.<p>Orson Wells doesn't appear until more than half the film is over, and only appears in three major scenes.  But these scenes will be remembered forever especially the one where he and Joseph Cotton confront each other on a moving Ferris Wheel. <p>Wells and Cotton are the stars of this film but the there's another star as well. And that's the City of Vienna in all its wartime devastation.  There is real rubble everywhere and the oblique angled shots, distorted wide angles and stark black and white photography create a surreal and bleak landscape.  And then there is the haunting original zither music by Anton Karas, which became a top hit in 1950.<p>I recently read the book by Graham Greene and therefore knew the plot.  In a way this spoiled the suspense for me.  Freed from that however, I was able to concentrate on the details of the directional techniques and the cinematography.  There's no doubt about it.  This film is a winner.</p></br><a href="../users/AL4MKKO24563R.html">AL4MKKO24563R</a><br/><p>There are so many great old films that suffer due to scratched and inferior video copies. The Third Man is such a film. My old VHS copy of the film had numerous splices, dirt marks, etc. In addition, the sound was  muddled and murky, making it hard to understand what the characters were  saying. Anton Karas' unique zither score was ruined, and Graham Greene's  unforgettable dialogue was almost unintelligible.<p>The DVD edition,  however, is clear with great sound. The dialogue is distinct and the  musical score sound great. The DVD details the restoration and shows before  and after clips that make you truly appreciate the work The Third Man's  restorers put into it.

Looking for work, American pulp fiction novelist Holly Martins (Cotton) arrives in Vienna to accept a job he has been offered by his old friend, Harry Lime (Welles), who he has not seen in many years.  But Martins is greeted at his hotel-- not by Lime, as he had expected-- but with the news that Lime is dead, having been hit by a truck two days earlier.  Arriving in time for the funeral, where he takes note of those in attendance, Martins afterwards makes the acquaintance of a select few who knew and were involved with his old friend, Harry, beginning with a representative of the authorities, a certain Major Calloway (Trevor Howard).  Lime, it seems, was a wanted man, connected with some nefarious dealings on the black market.  Initially, Martins is skeptical, but it's only the beginning of the mystery that is about to unfold about him.<p> In talking with those who knew Lime best, especially those present at the time of the accident, Martins begins to notice some inconsistencies in their accounts of what happened that day.  And the one discrepancy that bothers him the most is that in the official report, two men were said to have carried Lime-- just after he was hit-- from the street to the sidewalk, still alive at that point; but an eyewitness Martins uncovers claims that, not only was Lime killed instantly, but that another man-- a third man-- helped carry him.  So the mystery begins; the report says two men were with him when he died, and heard his last words.  A reliable witness, however, puts someone else at the scene.  And Martins realizes that therein lies the key; that to find out what really happened to Harry, he must learn the identity of the third man.<p> Working from the exceptionally well written screenplay by Graham Greene, Reed rivals the best of Hitchcock with this richly textured, stylistic offering.  The mystery begins to mount with the opening narration (by Reed in the British version, by Cotton in the U.S.)-- delivered in a conversational tone that is in itself unique compared to the usual cinematic narrative form-- and the tension-filled suspense begins to build from the moment Martins arrives, and is maintained by Reed until the denouement.  And-- in a sense--beyond, right up until the final frame of the film.  Outstanding performances, combined with the stark black &amp; white photography (for which cinematographer Robert Krasker won an Oscar)-- enhanced by Reed's artistic handling of the camera and his use of light and shadows-- as well as the zither-driven score by Anton Karas, makes this one of the most memorable mysteries ever filmed.<p> Cotton delivers a brilliantly understated performance as Martins, which provides a solid foundation upon and around which the mystery surrounding Lime develops.  And though Lime is afforded little actual screen time as Martins assembles the bits and pieces he's uncovered through his investigation, his enigmatic presence is felt in every scene as if he were there.  When he does appear, Welles embodies him in such a way that the mystique of this man that has been so cleverly and acutely developed is effectively maintained.  Welles, in fact, with his naturally dominating countenance was the perfect choice to play Lime, and he certainly delivers.  His few scenes with Cotton, especially one that takes place on a ferris wheel (which offers a telling perspective into Lime's character), are the most memorable of the entire film.  <p> Cotton's performance, however, is the real thread that holds it all together, and as Martins, he demonstrates his generosity as an actor; for it's that "regular guy" persona with which he imbues his character, that insures the emergence of Welles' Lime as so larger-than-life.  The same can be said, as well, for the effectiveness with which the mystery of the woman in Lime's life, Anna (Alida Valli), is established.  Again, Martins becomes the sounding board through which Valli's character reverberates so convincingly.  Her performance is strong, but her interaction with Cotton allows her Anna to shine all the more brightly.  It's a perfect example of having all the elements that go into the making of a film working together to produce a true classic in every sense of the word.<p> The supporting cast includes Paul Horbiger (Porter), Ernst Deutsch (Kurtz), Erich Ponto (Dr. Winkel), Siegfried Breuer (Popescu), Hedwig Bleibtreu (Old Woman), Bernard Lee (Sergeant Paine) and Wilfrid Hyde-White (Crabbin).  Intelligently conceived and written, and imaginatively and creatively delivered, "The Third Man" is a masterpiece that works on every conceivable level.  The purity of the film is inspiring; the integrity of the story is never compromised in any way by the sensationalism or cheap gimmicks that seem to plague even the best of today's offerings-- the fact of which many contemporary filmmakers would be well advised to take notice.  In the final analysis, this is simply a truly exceptional film; one that belongs in the library of every serious collector.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GCHG6U8HTVIT.html">A2GCHG6U8HTVIT</a><br/><p>Everything about this movie works. If anyone wants to see how a movie should be directed and edited, or a screenplay written, or complex characters acted, or a film photographed, this is the one to flip in the DVD machine.<br /><br />Holly Martins, a down-on-his-luck writer, shows up in post-war Vienna looking for his old friend, Harry Lime. But he's told Lime died in an accident, the military tell him to go home, and he's attracted to a mysterious woman he sees at Lime's grave. He sticks around, gets different stories about Lime, but finally understands Lime was an unscrupulous black marketeer, dealing in adulterated drugs among other things. And he realizes that Lime is alive.<br /><br />Carol Reed was at the top of his form with this movie. His partnership with Graham Greene (they had collaborated the year before on The Fallen Idol and would again in 1959 with Our Man in Havana) is unusual in that both were heavyweights in their fields.<br /><br />Joseph Cotten as Martins strikes just the right note of charm, inquisitiveness and weakness. He's the kind of a guy who would most likely follow the strongest person around, and that has been his old friend, Lime. And what a great voice Cotten had. Orson Welles, who could be so hammy, reins it in here. He doesn't have a lot of screen time, but his character dominates the movie. And the two work perfectly together. Welles' cuckoo speech has been mentioned so many times in so many places that it has lost much of its charm for me. It sounds to me now more like an alienated high school kid's idea of philosophy. But Lime's discussion of all those little dots goes to the heart of his character. The interplay on Cotten's and Welles' faces as they discuss how easy (or how difficult) it might be to get rid of Martins on the ferris wheel is masterful, and so is Welles as he teases out of Martins what Martins may have told the military police. Alida Valli as Anna is terrific as a woman who loves Lime but has no illusions left. I suspect Trevor Howard took the role of Major Calloway because he wanted to work with Reed and Greene. In 1949 he was a major star in England, with Brief Encounter under his belt. I've always liked him, even in most of the later lousey movies he signed up for.<br /><br />And the look and sound of the film...glistening, damp cobblestones at night, bombed out buildings, off-angle camera shots, harsh nightime lighting and deep shadows. The chase through the sewers with only the sounds of rushing water and footsteps. The first glimpse of Lime, nothing but deep shadows in a doorway and then a pair of shoes of someone unseen standing there. The sound of the zither playing the main theme over and over.<br /><br />The ending is one of the most understated and powerful I've ever seen. Lime has been shot in the sewer by Martins. Martins and Calloway leave the funeral in a jeep to catch his plane home. Anna ignores them and leaves the cemetery on foot. The jeep passes Anna but then Martins asks Calloway to let him out. He obviously has feelings for her. Martins leans against a cart on the side of the road as Calloway drives off. The camera doesn't move. Anna, in the distance, walks toward him. Without looking at him she walks straight past, and past the camera. Martins lights a cigarette, looks after her, then tosses the match away. And that's it.<br /><br />The Criterion edition is just as superb as the movie, and the extras are worth  watching.</p></br><a href="../users/A1MX6D3JK6IKDW.html">A1MX6D3JK6IKDW</a><br/><p>Classic post World War 2 film, appropriately shot in black and white. This film seems to hold up better than most, but would tend to appeal mostly to collectors or cinematic students. Vienna in those days was partitioned much the same way as Berlin for a short time after the war, and Cotten is back trying to determine the fate of an old friend, Harry Lime. All reliable sources have Lime either dead or missing in another quadrant of Vienna. The police know Lime well, giving Cotten a tour of a local hospital, where Lime's racket of selling watered down penicillin at inflated prices has permanently ruined many lives, mostly children. The old friends meet on a ferris wheel, Lime admits his guilt, and soon it's Cotten and the police against Lime, accompanied by Director Reed's use of zither background music, which drives this reviewer crazy. The climax is grotesque and painful, but fits the entire tenor of the film. The story is well told, and the minor players, save for a whining tot, all play their roles well.This production is an old favorite of mine. Give it a try!(Obvious reporting error-Film was made in 1949, not 1933 as listed).</p></br><a href="../users/A1GB0HW46Y2EB.html">A1GB0HW46Y2EB</a><br/><p>This film will undoubtedly be ranked as among the great films of the 20th century.  It's all been said before so I won't get into writing a review of the film itself.  However, there is one point I wish to bring up.  I bought the Criterion DVD  which for picture and sound has all anyone could wish.  However, like all non-anamorphically processed DVDs containing a non-widescreen movie, it  has the aspect ratio of 1.33:1, which is, of course, the standard for NTSC television since 1941.  However, many people don't realize that the standard set in 1931 for motion pictures was 1.37:1 and remained so until 1953 when a wider aspect ratio was introduced, varying from 1.66:1 to 1.85:1, optional with the directors and/or producers.  As a result all DVDs containing movies from the 30s, 40s and early 50s have been processed at 1.33:1 to conform to the prevailing television standard.<br /><br />Now with HD television and Blu-ray discs, the 1.33:1 standard is no longer an issue.  All pre 1953 movies released on Blu-ray can be and one hopes will be presented in the 1.37:1 aspect ratio.  I was happy to see that Warner Bros. released the Blu-ray version of "The Wizard of Oz" using the 1.37:1 standard even though the packaging states it as 1.33:1.  The difference is small but it's definitely there.  Here's hoping it will be maintained by all providers of Blu-ray titles.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KMG1AIUS00DC.html">A1KMG1AIUS00DC</a><br/><p>It's heartening to see that more and more classic films are being released in the Blu-ray format, which offers a crisp, sharp, High Definition picture and greater clarity of sound.  The latest is "The Third Man,"  the 1949 film about post-World War II intrigue set in a Vienna divided into French, American, British, and Russian zones, each containing its share of suspicious characters.<br /> Alcoholic pulp Western author Holly Martins (Joseph Cotton) has come to Vienna at the invitation of his friend, Harry Lime (Orson Welles), who has offered him a job, but Holly arrives just as Lime is being buried.  The film is based on the question, "Who killed Harry Lime?"  We hear contrasting opinions of Lime.  A British officer, Calloway (Trevor Howard), states unequivocally that Lime was a black market profiteer and deserves to be dead.  Lime's girlfriend (Alida Valli) tells Holly that Lime is not the man Calloway has described and sets out to clear his name.<br /> "The Third Man" was made by a team who experienced firsthand the war-torn devastation of Europe.  Director Carol Reed worked for the British Army's wartime documentary unit and writer Graham Greene not only wrote about spies but sometimes was one.  Reed filmed entirely on location in a Vienna still strewn with rubble and bomb craters four years after the war ended.<br /> One of the film's most memorable features is its all-zither score by the Austrian Anton Karas.  In fact, "The Third Man Theme" became one of the biggest hits of 1950.  The music is certainly unique in the annals of film scoring and gives the film both an upbeat feel and an old world quality.  In addition, the movie features a beautifully staged chase sequence that leads to the city's sewer system.  The photography by Robert Krasker in this sequence is especially impressive, as long shots with bright light sources just out of sight throw elongated, distorted shadows, a characteristic of film noir.<br /> The Blu-ray edition contains a restored high-definition digital transfer; a video introduction by writer-director Peter Bogdanovich; two audio commentaries; a 90-minute documentary on the making of the film; "Graham Greene: The Hunted Man," a 1968 episode of the BBC's "Omnibus" series; a 1951 episode of the radio series "The Lives of Harry Lime" written and performed by Orson Welles; archival footage of postwar Vienna; and a booklet featuring an essay on the movie and its impact.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AUECYM0M0YSX.html">A3AUECYM0M0YSX</a><br/><p>The folks at Criterion never give up short of perfection.

While the information is fascinating, and will shed much light on this noir, the filmmaker's style is pretentious, and distracts from the content.<br /><br />Other extras are the original U.S. trailer (grossly inappropriate for this movie, but probably closer to the type of film Selznick wanted to make), vintage footage of Vienna and Zitherist Anton Karas, and a photo album of the production--all also included in the prior Criterion release.  There's also a mini-doc on the film--much more straightforward and to me more interesting--with all still photos.  Even though it's all stills I found this short 10 minute presentation very riveting.  Then there's a featurette that shows many of the scenes of German-speaking players with their lines translated (they were deliberately left untranslated in the film so that the audience would feel as confused as Holly), a UK vs. US comparison of the openings, several of the radio shows that used the Harry Lime character, and a profile of writer Graham Greene from a 1968 British television program.  Oh, and did I mention there are two commentaries, one from filmmaker Steven Soderbergh and screenwriter Tony Gilroy and one from film distorian Dana Polan.  Oh, and there's a very stylish 26-page booklet insert.  And you know what?  There's probably other stuff I've forgotten.  These discs are cram-packed.<br /><br />In short, this is a whole college-level course on The Third Man in a little box.  It'll keep you watching for weeks.<br /><br />In case Amazon ever deletes the first Criterion edition of this DVD from their site, here's a cut-and-paste of my original review of the film itself:<br /><br />###<br />Reportedly Orson Welles replied to people who asked if he'd "really" directed The Third Man that Carol Reed was a great director who didn't need his advice. Yet this feels very much like Welles in many ways. First of all there's the subject matter--like Citizen Kane, this film deals with money and power, shattered idealism, and an elusive figure everyone knows *of* yet few people know. Like Kane, the cinematography is striking (though in a different way) and an integral part of the plot. Like Kane, the music is memorable and tells much of the story, yet again in a different way. Like Kane, the film was greeted coldly by many critics on its initial release and had to be shelved for many years before people realized it was a masterpiece. And last but not least, like Kane, it stars the great Joseph Cotten.<br /><br />The Third Man benefits enormously from being shot in post-war Vienna (in record time by using three crews simultaneously). You can taste the atmosphere. The locations are a "star" as much as any of the human players. Selznick wanted Reed to film on Hollywood back lots, and he wanted Jimmy Stewart to star. He objected to the zither music. He objected to the canted shots. (William Wyler reportedly gave Reed a level to put on his camera after seeing The Third Man!) Most of all, Selznick wanted a happy ending, where Holly gets the girl. But without Reed's vision, the film would have been a typical glossy Hollywood film now seen at 2 am on local UHF channels if at all.<br /><br />Reed gave Welles one of the great entrances in screen history. Welles gave Reed a hard time by refusing to work in a sewer and returning to England, forcing Reed to build a sewer set there just for Welles' part. Welles says he only wrote the "Cuckcoo clock speech," but leave it to Orson to give us the most memorable dialogue in a movie filled with memorable dialogue.<br /><br />Then there is the issue of The Woman. Often she will make or break a film like this, and here Alida Valli (or "Valli" as she preferred to be billed in the film...maybe it's an Italian thing that started long before Madonna) is the perfect choice, brooding and un-glamorous and yet all the more alluring because she's un-glamorous. It's easy to see how impressionable Holly would fall for her. It's harder to see why she would still defend Harry, but love is not always logical. Or is this just selfishness? There doesn't seem to be room for love in Reed and Greene's postwar Vienna...<br /><br />Criterion has done a loving restoration of The Third Man. While not up to the standard of the Citizen Kane DVD (which is not done by Criterion, incidentally) it is superb considering how poorly prints of this film have been handled over the years. Criterion performed many computer-repairs of tears and splices that make once-damaged scenes play perfectly. The gray scale is finally restored! (So many prints of this film are stark and grainy black and white and nearly unwatchable.) There are some extras, such as footage of Anton Karas performing on his unique instrument, documentary footage of the real Vienna sewers, the original trailer, the re-release trailer*, the alternate American opening, and fascinating production photos and commentary. Once again Criterion hits a home run.<br />###<br /><br />Make that a grand slam.<br /><br />*Not included in this version.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>In this film by Graham Greene we are in Vienna after the war where some shady and immoral business is going on, for the profit of some entreprising ringleaders. An American writer of western novels arrives here to visit of friend of his. He finds him dead and buried. But he asks many questions, too many actually, and finds out that the police report of the accident that killed his friend does not know about a third man on the accident scene. The film is a masterpiece of suspense and plot with a touch of romance. Yet this film is also very political playing on the rivalry between the western allies and the soviets who jointly occupy the city. The immoral businessmen use this rivalry to navigate freely in the city. Yet the International police and the austrian police will find out the truth and will bait and catch the main ringleader. The question asked in the film is a comparison between the Borggias who produced the Renaissance with intrigue, plot and blood, on one hand, and brotherly democratic Switzerland that produced only the cuckoo-clock, on the other hand. Which one is better ? The question is not answered in the film because we are big enough to make up our minds alone. Let say that the ending is moral.<p>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU</p></br><a href="../users/AUHG8KSHI529U.html">AUHG8KSHI529U</a><br/><p>What movie better captures the descent of the victory over the Nazis into the suspicion, paranoia, and corruption of the Cold War?  The movies strange off-angle camera shots, the way the plot twists and shifts who is covering up what and why is simply wonderful.  It is one of those rare movies that absolutely convinces you it is one kind of movie and ends up being another.<p>The always commented upon zither music does contribute mightily to the atmosphere of the film.  So does the untranslated German used throughout the film.  The palpable tension between the occupied Germans, the communists, and the allies is done better here than almost anywhere else.  I think it helps that the film was done at the time all the post WWII occupation was actually happening and still new.  <p>Orson Welles, Jospeh Cotten, Alia Valli, Trevor Howard, and all the rest are wonderful.  And the way Criterion has done the transfer is magnificent. <p>There is also an intro by Peter Bogdanovich, trailers, info on how the restoration was done, some radio shows from the Third Man, and some reading of Graham Greene's treatment.<p>This is a great disk.</p></br><a href="../users/A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO.html">A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO</a><br/><p>Well,Criterion has another release triumph here with "The Third Man".Criterion is well known for its' quality and an eclectic array of films already released in its' catalogues with many more on the way.Most are unavailable anywhere with Criterion consistently setting the release standards for DVDs,and this film is no exception.<br />"The Third Man" is a film originally released in /49 in Britain to great acclaim(this is the film we see),then released a year later in the U.S.The latter market had about 11 minutes cut out of it and the opening narrative changed from director Carol Reed's voice to star Joseph Cottons'.<br />This two disc collection includes everything you ever wanted to know about this film,and so much more.Included is a nine minute vignette with a self explanatory title "Insiders' Info" ,the US Trailer,the UK Press Book,another small vignette translating the foreign language sequences into English with sub-titles(five min.),a /51 radio show starring Orson Welles as "Harry Lime" in "Ticket to Tangiers",a Lux Radio Theatre show from /51 of "The Third Man",an award winning documentary from 2000 called"Who was the Third Man?"(30 min),a /68 profile of Graham Greene from the BBC show "Omnibus",a three min./54 newsreel of zither player Anton Karas at London's Empress Club,another three min.Pathe newsreel of the policing of the Vienna sewers called "The Underground of Vienna",and "The Third Man's Vienna",a background vignette on the real post war Vienna that Greene brings to life in the film.To top this all off is a 26  page booklet with several articles about the making and producing of the film which are quite intriguing,along with production credits,transfer specs,cast credits and much more.<br />I won't go into the plot as it is very well known by most by now.I must say that I have never seen the film looking as good as it does in this release.They made a great transfer using a high grain positive master and took out thousands of extant marks,dirt,etc, to bring the B&W print gloriously back to life.It's not perfect but it is light years beyond anything I've ever seen before.I've always said that a great print can only add to ones enjoyment of a film and the proof is abundantly clear in this "pudding".<br />The film comes from the "Janus" collection which,as I noted in my review of Criterions'glorious release of "Pandora's Box",has been known to me as a firm that has released only countless cut and butchered films over the years.However,as I have nothing to compare films with(as I did with Pandora)I can only say that nothing appears to be amiss here so I will leave it at that.<br />In conclusion this is a film which belongs in every serious film collectors collection.A classic of its' genre,"The Third Man" is without doubt a very important film.Its' cast is rock solid,the script and on film atmosphere that is created through its' brilliant use of lighting and cinematography,serves to enhance the films' quality and stature.<br />With all the extras included,and this being a Criterion product which is ALWAYS a superior product,it is a must have DVD set.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>When I first saw `Citizen Kane' I was completely smitten with Orson Welles and his brilliant performance.  I had always heard wonderful things about Welles, but I had never really gotten around to delving into his filmography.  The other night I picked up this classic film for the mere fact that Welles was in it, and what I found was one of the tightest film noirs I've ever seen; a film that I'm sure will steadily climb my favorites list for it is seriously one of a kind.<br /><br />The film follows author Holly Martins as he arrives in Vienna after his old friend Harry Lime sends him a plane ticket.  Upon arriving though, Martins receives some disturbing news.  Harry has died, been hit by a car, and is being buried.  Instead of getting on the next plane and returning home, Holly decides that he is going to look into his friends untimely death for he's not so sure it was an accident as so many around him claim it to have been.  Holly struggles with Major Calloway, a British cop convinced that Lime was an unsavory character, not to mention trying to gather information from those who knew Harry, especially his beautiful girlfriend Anna Schmidt.  What Holly uncovers is far more than he expected, and much worse than he could have imagined.<br /><br />Writer Graham Greene and director Carol Reed have crafted a marvelous film noir in `The Third Man', a film that is so superbly constructed it will never leave your mind.  Reed's effective use of lighting and sound is marvelous, and the rich black and white just elevates the mood of the film.  Seriously, I'm beginning to question why we ever moved over to color in the first place.  That zither score is unique and, while at first I didn't think it would work, ultimately it proves to be one of the films greatest facets.<br /><br />The film instantly draws you in to the characters that their situation and manages to keep you guessing and ripe with anticipation as you uncover, along with Holly, the tragic truths behind Lime's fate.<br /><br />Aiding Reed and Graham are the entire cast, Joseph Cotton stepping into the lead role of Holly Martins, and doing a fabulous job at that.  Cotton gives Holly a real sense of spark and determination, proving to the audience the importance within his motivations.  As the film spirals towards its dramatic closing we see the layers stripped away from Holly and are allowed to see his humanity battling itself, which is something I always love to see plaguing my actors.  Alida Valli is drop dead gorgeous as Anna, but she is far more than just window dressing.  She captures the struggle of a woman in love who cannot bear to accept all that her lover really was.  The single shot of her teary eyes is probably my single favorite scene in the film; a beautiful example of Reed using her actors to the full.  Trevor Howard also turns in a grand performance as Major Calloway, a man that is easy to dislike yet the only one you can truly trust.  He understands the true meaning of a supporting role, allowing Cotton to shine brightest yet never allowing his own character to suffer because of it.<br /><br />And then that leads me to Welles, the `third man' from the title.  Welles single-handedly steals this entire film with a mere ten minutes or so of screen time.  When we first see him standing in the shadows (one of the greatest cinematic entrances of all time) we are intrigued, but when his character finally meets Holly face to face we are presented with Welles undeniable presence and ability.  He acts circles around Cotton and delivers a superb, undeniable performance that becomes the highlight of the film.  He is unforgettable in every sense of the word.<br /><br />`The Third Man' truly lives up to the hype surrounding it.  The classic use of shadows throughout creates a vibe of uneasiness that elevates the drama and helps instill in the audience a mystery that is slowly unfolding before them.  When you add to this the immaculate script and the sublime performances you have a film that is not soon forgotten.  I saw this movie for the legend that is Orson Welles, but I kept watching because of everything else that so perfectly creates a marvelous cinematic experience.  There are few movies that come along like this one, movies that cannot be improved upon.</p></br><a href="../users/AN9J46667D80O.html">AN9J46667D80O</a><br/><p>Ah, what an excellent, entertaining little film this is! I'd heard of it, off and on, throughout the years, but never seen it until I had the joy of getting the Criterion Edition of the film, so I come to it as fairly recent first-time viewer.<br /><br />The movie's plot, as you know, centers around an American writer, Holly Martens, who goes to post-War Vienna to work for a friend named Harry Lime. When he gets there, he finds that Lime has met an untidy end, one that gets more and more untidy as Martens begins to pull at the loose threads of the story, until finally he finds a truth he never expected.<br /><br />As I said, I'd only recently seen the film for the first time, and I was very impressed by it! The acting was amazingly good as was the direction, and the plot was sensational! Kept me guessing all the way through (am I the only one who thought the balloon-man was a certain character in disguise? I bet not).<br /><br />The film is also filled with incredible moments. The aforementioned ballon-man. The appearance of Welles, which is probably the best reveal in movie history. The cukoo-clock speech. The chase through the sewers was VERY impressive and that alone makes the film worth watching!<br /><br />The movie was based on a story by Grahm Greene. I've never read any of his works, but this movie makes me want to. Likewise, while I've heard of Orson Welles and Joseph Cotton, and admired their performances in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CX9E">Citizen Kane</a>, I'd never heard of Carol Reed until this movie. Apparently I now have some catching up to do.<br /><br />The extras on the DVD are all reasonably nifty. It IS a Criterion DVD, after all, and they seldom disapoint. The price tag might be a little steep, but who cares? It's one of the best movies ever made, and worth every penny.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AUECYM0M0YSX.html">A3AUECYM0M0YSX</a><br/><p>Reportedly Orson Welles replied to people who asked if he'd "really" directed The Third Man that Carol Reed didn't need his suggestions.

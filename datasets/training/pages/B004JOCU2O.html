Based on a real life incident, a mile long freight train carrying toxic chemicals is turned loose - by accident not terrorists - across the Pennsylvania countryside.  Frank (Washington) and Will (Chris Pine), become reluctant heroes who get stuck on the same track.  The film is the right length (98 min.) and has the right plot.  That is, not much of one.  Just the train hauling ass across the state.  Not much sidetracks the action.  Just how it happened, how can it be fixed and can it be done in an hour and a half.  Granted there's nothing of heft here, just thrills.  Yes, there are a few too many police cars showing up in critical scenes and one too many car crashes, but I sure liked the 70 mph locomotive demolishing things that get stuck on the track.  Plenty-o-fun.<br /><br />This is a solid Blu ray transfer with excellent detail and a vibrant (and loud) surround application.</p></br><a href="../users/A2KWQ64TRHB3YH.html">A2KWQ64TRHB3YH</a><br/><p>This non-stop action film, from beginning to end, is based on true events about a runaway unmanned train. A series of human errors occur because of distractions and overconfidence and the lack of sufficient knowledge about how trains function. These are intensified by rivalries between older and younger generations and family problems. As a result a train is moving unmanned at 70-75 miles an hour, toward Trenton, Pennsylvania, filled with hazardous materials that will, unless stopped or at least slowed down, turn over when it reaches a turn at the town and, like a missile, destroy the town and kill people. The movie depicts the various attempts made to stop the train.</p></br><a href="../users/AU25GMX57XBVO.html">AU25GMX57XBVO</a><br/><p>Tony Scott is much better than this.  He has produced many great movies but this one was just ok in my opinion.  The title basically tells you about what you are going to watch leaving little to really see.  Maybe a different title and few adjustments here or there could have made it better.  Overall, if your a Denzel Washington fan for sure worth a watch but look towards 'The Last Boy Scout' or 'The Taking of Pelham 123' for a better Tony Scott production.<br /><br />Peter J.

It's THAT good!<br /><br />I'm still pretty darn amazed just how much I enjoyed Unstoppable while watching it this afternoon.  I *almost* passed it up too, believing it couldn't be anywhere as good as the description says.  I was totally wrong!<br /><br />It's exactly what you've been reading about- a train goes out of the control when the driver makes a silly, critical mistake and is forced to jump off the train to correct the problem (while the train is in motion).<br /><br />Of course he's so out of shape he's unable to get back on the train before it takes off on its own and eventually builds up enough speed to become a serious threat to major populated areas.  Not only that, but the train is carrying dangerous chemicals that threaten the safety of innocent people all over town.<br /><br />Throughout the film many people try to stop the train but everyone fails hard and heavy.  I'm surprised how much detail was involved pertaining to train knowledge.  The movie writers must have brought in some professionals to make everything seem so believable.<br /><br />Overall, the action is beyond amazing and continuous, the acting is really intense and defines edge of your seat suspense the way it involves a rookie train driver clashing with the professionals and attempting to make a point that even a rookie can get the job done, and it's just a really spectacular movie overall.  Expect to have a LOT of fun watching this.</p></br><a href="../users/A11PTCZ2FM2547.html">A11PTCZ2FM2547</a><br/><p>The brothers Scott are among the best moviemakers in the business; Ridley and Tony know how to tell a story via stunning visuals and heart-pounding action.  In UNSTOPPABLE Tony puts on the proverbial throttle from virtually the beginning of the film and doesn't even think about pulling it back; the result is nonstop mayhem, violence, and destruction that very much makes the film's $100 million budget not surprising.  Tony gets to tear up a lot of. . .stuff. . .in UNSTOPPABLE, a movie about a doofus who leaves his moving train to personally throw a switch--only the train gets away from him.  And speeds up; we're talking 70 mph speeds as it races through rural Pennsylvania on its way to a fictionalized metro (Stanton?), where certain derailment awaits--and of course the train is pulling several tankards of highly toxic chemicals.<br /><br />Yep.  That's why I took my heart pills as I was watching this puppy.<br /><br />While the railroad's execs dither on what to do another locomotive is in the area, operated by a crafty veteran engineer (Denzel Washington) and his wet-behind-the-ears conductor (Chris Pine).  When they're not snapping at one another Denzel's character is waxing philosophical while Pine's character is trying to smooth over a restraining order filed by his wife.  Ignoring the orders of the execs--who have decided to derail the train before it reaches the city--the rogue team pursues the train--in reverse--in an effort to connect to the runaway train's last car; then, they theorize, they'll put on the brakes to slow the runaway down.  Naturally, Scott really ratchets up the action here, and UNSTOPPABLE hurls like a rocket towards its climactic (yet sometimes cartoon-like) ending.  And Rosario Dawson looks darn good as a railroad operations supervisor, even though all she does is basically talk into a headset.  (Lucky headset.)  UNSTOPPABLE is an appropriate title, as it aptly identifies this film's thrills.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning</p></br><a href="../users/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ.html">A12X2J7AVZ04IQ</a><br/><p>I really enjoyed "Unstoppable" for lots of reasons. There's very little soap opera back-story, as in so many disaster films, and the story gets off the platform from the beginning. At a crisp 96 minutes, this story that is "inspired" but not "based" on actual events is no end of fun and excitement. Acting is fine, and the editing is remarkable, as are the special effects.There's time to know the characters' motivations without intruding on the action at hand. This review may never be read, but I was compelled to get in my 5-stars. I had no problem with my enjoyment of "Unstoppable". Comparisons to "Runaway Train" with Jon Voight ('85) are not realistic. Different venue, different situations. The DVD I watched (Netflix) had no extras. That would've been nice.<br />UPDATE (8-24-12): So very sorry to hear of Tony Scott's tragic death. He will be missed.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FY3H6F4249E0.html">A3FY3H6F4249E0</a><br/><p>This was a very enjoyable movie.  Although it seemed to get just a tiny bit slow in the first half, it still kept me tied to the screen.  The conductor of a train makes a stupid mistake and leaves a moving train for just a second.  The internal switches slip and it becomes a runaway train, gradually increasing speeds.  It just so happens that there are several cars of a toxic substance on the runaway train.<br /><br />Denzel Washington plays a veteran train engineer (of 28 years I think) who knows the tricks of the trade that you cannot find in books.  Chris Pine (of Star Trek) plays a young conductor.<br /><br />Realistically, I don't know why they could not have fixed the situation earlier in the movie, except that it was written in the script that way.  STILL, I enjoyed it.  It also touches on dumb management decisions, management arrogance, and the stupidity of a company wanting to get rid of older, experienced workers so they can hire younger ones (probably at a lower salary and less benefits).<br /><br />The plot takes place in Pennsylvania and is said to be based on true events.</p></br><a href="../users/A18HHKM6WGEF9D.html">A18HHKM6WGEF9D</a><br/><p>Although this film claims it is 'based on a true story', upon looking it up I discovered the real story was quite a bit tamer - a train did get away, pretty much in the same way it is portrayed here, and it was eventually stopped the same way, but it was going at a MUCH slower pace, and the other dramatic attempted rescues portrayed in the film didn't happen. Which makes sense, because much of the film I just couldn't quite suspend disbelief, and kept rolling my eyes going 'no way!'<br /><br />Putting all that aside though, overall I enjoyed the film, mostly because of Denzel Washington. In my opinion, he is just riveting to watch in almost anything, and I enjoyed him here, even though he doesn't get that much to work with dramatically. What he does get, he spins into gold.<br /><br />The movie is also non-stop excitement - like the train, it never stops moving. So Denzel + non-stop action = 4 stars to me, even if the script and story were less than stellar.</p></br><a href="../users/AWG2O9C42XW5G.html">AWG2O9C42XW5G</a><br/><p>this movie is awesome. i love this movie. it keeps you entertained from start to finish this movie rocks. the actors and the story is great. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do</p></br><a href="../users/A3R8PXSFGY9MC2.html">A3R8PXSFGY9MC2</a><br/><p>`Unstoppable' is a film that is so gripping and exciting that it will have you on the edge of your seat for much of the duration.<br /><br />Inspired by true events this film follows Frank Barnes and Will Colson as they attempt to stop a runaway train in Pennsylvania.  When a set of unlucky circumstances come together and a train is left without an engineer, carrying a highly flammable, toxic load, into a highly populated area at great speed, it will take great bravery and forward thinking to stop it.  Fortunately you get exactly these attributes in Frank and Will.<br /><br />Washington (as Frank) is as good as we have come to expect and Chris Pine plays the roll of Will very well indeed.  There are other excellent performances, most notably from Rosario Dawson as a railway despatcher clearing the line and giving advice.<br /><br />This is a relatively short film at around 98 minutes, but it kept me hooked and jittery throughout.  There is something about a runaway train that makes you very nervous.  The extra elements of the flammable cargo and the fact this is based on true events make it all the more potent.<br /><br />This is well scripted, directed and acted and made for one exciting and compelling film and I recommend it highly indeed.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></br><a href="../users/A24IJY3V0804WJ.html">A24IJY3V0804WJ</a><br/><p>Tony Scott teams up with his muse Denzel Washington to direct this action thriller. As the name suggests this is about a train run amok laden with toxic chemicals and heading straight for a populated town. This is a movie where one can easily speculate the end but the film succeeds because it was partially based on real life experiences, the editing, action sequences and the direction stand out. The lead actors do not have much to do but play out the age old rookie and veteran roles. I could not take my eyes away from the screen; the last time this happened to me was when I watched `Speed' many years ago. Four stars. 4/22/2011</p></br><a href="../users/A18758S1PUYIDT.html">A18758S1PUYIDT</a><br/><p>I want to find out what this was based on since apparently it really happened.  Nice job of location filming in PA, good performances from Denzel, Pine, and Dawson in the lead roles; suspenseful action sequences as a train rushes out of control down the tracks with perilous toxic cargo.<br /><br />Good action flick.</p></br><a href="../users/A168VXSISJWQN9.html">A168VXSISJWQN9</a><br/><p>I'm a railfan and I like watching trains. I therefore am awarding this movie one star more than I think should really be the case. It's a well-made film, with lots of action and just enough character development to make the principle characters (though not what they are portrayed as doing) credible. The star of the movie is the train, and here I must give a tip of the hat to director Tony Scott for using as much real railroad footage as possible, even though I have to say that to someone accustomed to watching trains the speeds claimed by the movie are patently not the speeds at which the trains are running.<br /><br />Never mind, it's all good, clean, edge-of-the-seat fun and if the ending is rather predictable (and belies the title) I'm old-fashioned enough to be happy with that.<br /><br />The two documentaries are very good, but I'd caution anyone who decides to switch on Tony Scott's commentary that his style is a stream-of-consciouness ramble which tells you a lot about Tony Scott but not much about what you are watching on the screen. Four stars for railroad buffs- perhaps an 'It's OK' three stars for everyone else.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AFXJ8U72MD6L.html">A1AFXJ8U72MD6L</a><br/><p>Similar to SPEED but not quite as good.  Tale focuses on a train that gets out of control and starts to pick up speed, creating danger for the community.  Washington and Pine do good to very good jobs with their characters but some of the supporting cast members are more memorable.  There's some good heart pumping action moments in this film.<br />Overall, I thought this would be a great film when it was only good.  It's hard to describe other than I didn't feel every scene overlapped properly, but, since this isn't film school I won't go into the details.  Overall, a good movie and better than most but not "A" quality.  I found the last few minutes to be cheesy.

Director Tony Scott lets nothing stand in the way of the action, yet still manages to present characters we care about and an intelligent story (screenwriter Mark Bomback) that clearly explains the factors that led to the disaster and the steps taken to rectify it.  The result is an efficient, thrilling action picture that is easy to recommend.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>Taking a cue or two from 1985's Runaway Train, Unstoppable is a breezy, flashy, yet undeniably entertaining Tony Scott vehicle.  Scott favorite Denzel Washington plays a veteran train-man who, along with rookie Chris Pine, find an ordinary work day going straight down the toilet when an unmanned train carrying toxic chemicals rages through western Pennsylvania.  Such things as story, character development, and even the laws of physics to a degree are inconsequential.  Despite that though, Unstoppable somehow manages to work regardless.  Washington and Pine are both insanely likeable, the action is wonderful, and the film is surprisingly suspenseful as well.  Rosario Dawson is also on board as a driven operator guiding our heroes along, and she fares better than anyone else here other than our two heroes.  All in all, Unstoppable is a fun blast while it lasts, and you can't really ask for much more than that.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LSDDSM4PGOU5.html">A1LSDDSM4PGOU5</a><br/><p>though i did enjoy this dramatic action thriller,i thought it was missing something.there was drama,to be sure,and plenty of action.but it was not as thrilling as i had hoped or expected.there was enough tension to keep me watching,but none of the 'edge of your seat 'or nerve shredding intensity.it wasn't boring,by any means but compared to the tension in Crimson Tide,for instance(also directed by Tony Scott)there was no comparison.Scott really reigned himself in here(which he usually has trouble doing(see Domino)but in this case,he could have let loose a bit.still,the movie was entertaining enough.for me,Unstoppable is a 3/5</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>"Unstoppable" is a heart-pounding action flick that reminds me a lot of 1999's superb "Speed", with its cast of ordinary citizens and an ordinary vehicle hurtling toward destruction. At Fuller Yard in Northern Pennsylvania, the 39-car train 777 gets away from its operator when he abandons the cabin to fix a switch. Meanwhile, at Brewster Yard in Southern Pennsylvania, veteran engineer Frank Barnes (Denzel Washington) and novice conductor Will Colson (Chris Pine) don't quite hit it off. They're heading toward Stanton in train 1206. When it is discovered that 777 is not coasting but is under power and picking up speed, carrying a load of molten phenol and diesel fuel, the Fuller yardmaster Connie Hooper (Rosario Dawson) clashes with her company's VP Oscar Gavin (Kevin Dunn) on how to cope with the crisis.<br /><br />The day begins slowly, as people go about their jobs on the railroad. It takes everyone a while to grasp the extent of the problem. The audience gets to know them. The film's title sequence claims it was "inspired by true events", a reference to a 2001 train mishap in Ohio involving a runaway train carrying molten phenol. It wasn't nearly so hair-raising in real life, but the element of near-plausibility makes "Unstoppable" more compelling. It's a race against time, not against high-tech gadgetry. The train must be stopped before it reaches a curve in Stanton, which will cause it to derail and spew toxic chemicals. The technology that can be brought to bear on the problem is limited. It's a railroad. So this is an old-fashioned action movie, punched up with some doom and gloom and the occasional explosion, but thoroughly enjoyable.</p></br><a href="../users/A3JLOIXFM75QNV.html">A3JLOIXFM75QNV</a><br/><p>So this film is literally all about a runaway train. That's pretty much it. Denzel Washington and Chris Pine's characters spend the last half hour of the film trying to be heros and stop the train all by themeselves in their own little train, going backwards. Oh and of course there are dangerous chemicals onboard the runaway train and of course it is heading towards a highly populated city where it will surely run off the track if no one stops it and disintegrate everything in the area. Oh, there's a pointless subplot about how Pine's character has a restraining order and can't see his son and wife and of course Washington's character has a small issue with his two daughters too. I'm pretty sure I covered the entire movie. That really is it. Zero suspense, predictable ending and can't forget the clich&eacute; characters!</p></br><a href="../users/A1UNJ46NSB352E.html">A1UNJ46NSB352E</a><br/><p>I don't know - there's something about Tony Scott films that interest me.  I can't place my finger on it.  I knew before watching "The Taking of Pelham 123" that I shouldn't like it, and I knew afterword that I probably still shouldn't have enjoyed it.  The same is somewhat true here.  The story is elevated because of the cast - Denzel Washington, as always, turns in a workmanlike performance.  Chris Pine doesn't exactly stretch his acting legs, but he does fine as the new guy.  It's never bad to have Rosario Dawson in your film.  Plus, Kevin Corrigan's in this one.  The story is pretty simple here, and there won't be a lot of surprises.  It's probably worth 90 minutes of your time, though.  The Blu-Ray picture quality was excellent.  I won't comment on the sound quality since I am installing some new flooring and currently have the surround sound in storage - that said, I can only assume that would enhance the viewing.  Overall, the movie has its flaws, but it's a fairly enjoyable ride.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EARN5PUVIF1S.html">A1EARN5PUVIF1S</a><br/><p>This is a taut and suspenseful action thriller with excellent lead performances from Denzel Washington, Chris Pine, and Rosario Dawson.<br /><br />Based on a true incident, the film tells the tale of a runaway freight train that threatens to derail around a curve in Stanton, PA, spewing its load of toxic chemicals on the surrounding community.<br /><br />Bucking the unfortunate trend of DVDs packing minimal extras, this disc includes both a commentary by director Tony Scott as well as an informative "making-of" featurette that impresses the viewer with the scope of the production and the director's insistence on shooting as much as possible "in the camera" -- i.e. no CGI effects.<br /><br />Though stopping the runaway train is the primary story here, the vet engineer and rookie conductor played by Washington and Pine have credible back stories that give their relationship an additional edge.  Dawson lends strong support as the dispatcher who is trying to keep track of the situation as it spins out of control due to an arrogant and inept engineer and bad calls by a bottom-line-driven railroad exec.<br /><br />Action thriller fans will be munching fistfuls of popcorn as the runaway train picks up speed, and fans of good acting will appreciate the star turns of the leads.<br /><br />Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A3TYC8T6W81DDB.html">A3TYC8T6W81DDB</a><br/><p>Remember Speed from 1994? It was that action film that everyone seemed to love during the nineties and for good reason; it had high octane action, a great cast, and it managed to just keep going even when you thought it was going to end like ten minutes prior. Now get rid of the bus and replace it with an out of control train carrying explosive chemicals. Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock are now Denzel Washington and Chris Pine, which means Joe Morton is now Rosario Dawson and Dennis Hopper is Kevin Dunn...or something. Anyway, the point is, Unstoppable in a nutshell is basically Speed on a train.<br /><br />The first thing that comes to mind with Unstoppable is how incredibly LOUD it is. It seemed like the knob to the volume was broken off after it was turned past its limitations during the sound editing process. If you aren't listening to an out of control train squealing on railroad tracks, it's the soundtrack full of heavy guitar riffs that rumbles the floor under your seat. The other kind of bizarre thing was the weird zoom-in Unstoppable used in the first half of the film. We'd open on a shot of actors talking, but then the camera would zoom-in slightly sometimes more than once. It was probably used to try and add suspense to whatever the actors were talking about at the time, but it came off as irritating more than anything. Thankfully, it wasn't done the entire film. I seem to remember it happening during another recent film that I can't put my finger on, but it's more than likely another Tony Scott film.<br /><br />In a film like this, acting is kind of secondary. As long as they're reacting to whatever threat is currently posed against them in a way that seems realistic, then it's safe to say that they've done their job well. This isn't the best work of any of the actors involved. Denzel Washington definitely shined brighter in both Man on Fire (another Tony Scott film) and The Book of Eli from earlier this year and Chris Pine hasn't really done anything as impressive as his portrayal of Captain James Kirk in last year's Star Trek. Then there's Rosario Dawson whose role as Connie seems kind of safe for the actress as it seems way too similiar to most of the other roles in her repertoire. The thing is though that it all works out in the end to deliver a film that is both thrilling and exciting. People go to the movies to be entertained and this film does that very well. The one problem with Unstoppable is that it doesn't seem to give any weight to the several emotional factors of the film. We know just enough to realize both Frank and Will will lose a lot if they fail at trying to stop this train and while it does work, I can't help but feel like the film would have had an even bigger impact if we had spent a little more time getting to know Frank's daughters or having a little more depth to Will's situation with his wife and son.<br /><br />Unstoppable is a white knuckled, edge of your seat thriller that has a way of making you feel like you're thrown in front of the railroad tracks as this unstoppable train approaches during the most suspenseful and knuckle biting scenes. The thriller is very similar to what Speed would be like today if it took place on a train, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. Unstoppable is definitely an exciting way to waste an hour and a half.</p></br><a href="../users/A356RFKNIG043B.html">A356RFKNIG043B</a><br/><p>Unstoppable is indeed very stoppable, and blessedly so; hitting pause while going to get a beer has rarely felt like such a relief. The first hour is so full of modern film cliches that it was just plain annoying:<br /><br />-Shaky Hand-Cam TM that's supposed to make you feel excited but just makes you feel ill<br />-pointlessly sudden close-ups that achieve the same effect as the shaky hand-cam<br />-unbelievably manipulative music that tells you what you're supposed to feel just before you could ever actually feel it from what's on screen...and way louder than the dialogue so you have to lunge for the remote or have your eardrums assaulted<br />-brief and all-too-standard character bios that reveal the same tired character types, especially the young married couple on the rocks (gee, all they need is a good disaster to rekindle their love!)<br />-product placement galore (like we don't get enough Faux News in "reality" these days?)<br />-etc etc<br /><br />Scott and Denzel hit a home run with Man On Fire but have since tried variations on that pattern to ever-less success, and Unstoppable is so formulaic that these two seem to be on auto-pilot. Yes, it's based on a true story, but there are so many hackneyed tropes here that it might as well be entirely fake, I mean fictional.<br /><br />[Spoilers] The train literally turns the magic final curve on half its wheels?! Are you kidding? Why not have Superman come down and set it straight while you're at it? Ridiculous. Either you're going for realism, or you're not. Which is it?<br /><br />We're told the train is going 71 mph and is 10 miles from the next Big Event...and then it takes 20 minutes to get there, with no apparent back-time shots, etc. What, we can't do math?<br /><br />The tv helicopter hovers over the entire ride and almost hits the rescue chopper...and not one person ever mentions the danger or stupidity of that? Come on.<br /><br />Denzel is just getting lazy, or maybe he has no acting chops any more, or something, because every role he takes seems to require less and less thought and feeling, with the script supplying all the dramatic movement while DW just grimaces and looks fully committed to whatever crazy stunt he's about to let his stunt double do. Speaking of which, the hopping across trains at 75 mph at 60 years old with nary a hitch? Pull the other one.<br /><br />Pine is fine but feels like Paul Walker or any other of the new blond pretty boys who think scowling equals acting. Ditto most of the other actors here: bland. It just never felt right or real, but instead like a movie hyping itself at every turn.<br /><br />The final 20 minutes are better than the rest, but not by much. The final screen shot showing that Denzel's character got his full pension back is so funny it's a joke. The guy saves the entire company and gets a pat on the back? Believable, but for the movie to show it as some sort of justice is, like so much of this predictable Hollywood tripe, self-defeating.<br /><br />I love popcorn movies, and this is surely one, but both the director and star can do SO much better. Too bad they're just going for the easy money now.<br /><br />Speaking of which, this blu-ray package is a rip-off at 39, or even 20. Who needs a BD hi-def picture for a movie purposely shot extra-grainy and shaky to get that "real feel"? Nobody. This blu-ray is a waste of money, and the extras are also on the dvd, so get that if you must, but better yet just rent this, or best yet, watch any of a thousand better popcorn action thrillers before you pop this one in the player. It's only Unstoppable if you let it get started...and even then that beer break will be such a relief. You might just want to stay in the kitchen and turn on the radio.</p></br><a href="../users/ALLIGF5OZM1I6.html">ALLIGF5OZM1I6</a><br/><p>UNSTOPPABLE<br /><br />STARRING: Denzel Washington, Chris Pine, Rosario Dawson, Kevin Dunn, T.J. Miller, Ethan Suplee and Kevinn Corrigan<br /><br />WRITTEN BY: Mark Bomback<br /><br />DIRECTED BY: Tony Scott<br /><br />Rated: PG - 13<br />Genre: Action / Thriller<br />Release Date: 12 November 2010<br />Review Date: 09 November 2010<br /><br />Unstoppable is the perfect title for a Denzel Washington flick because that is exactly what he is. He simply doesn't make bad movies and his performances are always riveting and dead-on. And if you were to surround him with the talents of Chris Pine and Rosario Dawson, you really couldn't go wrong.<br /><br />Director Tony Scott has done just that with Unstoppable, marking it as his impressive 16th feature film and fifth collaboration with Denzel. From Top Gun and Days of Thunder to Beverly Hills Cop II and The Taking of Pelham 123, who better to direct an action picture based on true events of a runaway train carrying tons of deadly chemicals, than Tony Scott?<br /><br />That's the plot and you know the actors so let's meet the characters. Denzel plays Frank; a single father to two teenage daughters working their way through college by waiting tables at Hooters. Don't trouble yourself; Denzel makes the joke for you. I'm just curious if Hooters paid Fox or if Fox paid Hooters? Frank has been working in a rail yard for 28 years and today he's got a new partner.<br /><br />Chris Pine plays Will - said partner, and the two don't hit it off so well at first. Frank is old school and Will is new school and there's no teacher around to make sure they play nice. It's just them and us in the cockpit of their train for the majority of their screen time. Don't think we spend the entire film stuck in a conductor box with these two though because we don't; they're not on the runaway train by the way.<br /><br />The train has runaway (is it just me or does the term runaway train just sound funny?) due to the incompetence of two idiots played by two funny and good actors whom I'll save for you. Their boss Connie, played by the lovely Rosario Dawson, must clean up their mess, serving as mediator between them, other employees, Frank and Will, an inspector, and her stiff corporate A-hole of a supervisor, Galvin (Kevin Dunn).<br /><br />Galvin is more concerned with the potential financial tragedy of a `train wreck' as the beast is half a mile long (a lot of money folks), than he is with the moral dilemma of how many lives will be lost should a wreck occur. The train has to go somewhere and it's headed straight for a big town; of course. Frank, Will and Connie aren't having it though because they're the good guys after all; so they devise a plan to earn that title.<br /><br />Unstoppable is about a train on the loose - but it's good, fast, funny and fun.</p></br><a href="../users/A319SKSB556033.html">A319SKSB556033</a><br/><p>Don't be fooled by the title, this film is anti-climactic and thus disappointing.<br /><br />Washington (in his second train-based film in a row with Scott and 5th film with him overall) and Pine play the cliched due of retiring veteran and rookie who are grinding away another day at the train yard. But the incompetence of a fat yard worker allows a half-mile long freight loaded with hazardous chemicals to get loose and tear through the countryside. Our heroes then put aside their usual chores to catch up with the loco and hit the brakes all while head office and the media watch and wait.<br /><br />Sound exciting. It's not. There's no real sense of speed. Tony Scott tries to make the audience believe that the train is going really fast with lots of quick, shaky camera pans and some annoying stutter cuts (when will THIS dumb trend come to an end?). It hits a few bumps and scratches a few cars, but no significant damage is done and no breathtaking destruction fills the screen with eye candy.<br /><br />I really have to wonder where the appeal was in the script. There's really nothing worth mentioning between the moment the trains starts and stops (yes, it does indeed stop). If this were a 70s disaster epic it would be 140 minutes long (as opposed to 98), would feature many, many deaths, even more obstacles, and would end with the train blowing up...and all with a PG-rating. In 2010 an easy ride with a couple of flash pans is apparently the best that they can do.<br /><br />Not a keeper.<br /><br />The Blu Ray looks and sounds great in 2.40:1 1080p with DTS HD-MA 5.1 and plenty of features.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>Mind set for a mindless thriller....check!, Popcorn....check!,  brain removed....check! 'Unstoppable' is a very fast paced and fun ride, just keep in mind that there are some extremely ridiculous and unintentionally funny scenes. Slickly made with a likable cast, the film never rises above "edible garbage"(I know you love that term Andrew!:-D!). As long as you know what you're in for you'll have fun watching this silly action flick.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>Tony Scott's latest film "Unstoppable" is exactly about what the title describes: a runaway freight train with highly toxic materials. Because of several human errors, themselves simple, no one is on board to stop the train, and "dead man's switch" is of no use. As Rosario Dawson's yardmaster says, the worst scenario is "a missile the size of the Chrysler Building." The only hope to evade the catastrophe is a veteran driver Frank Barnes (Denzel Washington) and a newly-hired guard Will Colson (Chris Pine).<br /><br />The story, inspired by the real-life event in 2001 Ohio, is simple, and it works. This is a non-stop ride of action from start to finish. Tony Scott's trademark fast-cut visual style and fast-paced narrative captures the deadly power and speed of the rushing train, greatly supported by the impressive stunt work. To create tension, the film does not rely on CGI effects overused these days. The film shows what it is being "unstoppable."<br /><br />"Unstoppable" is not without flaws. For all the strong acting from the leading actors, characters (especially those who make wrong decisions) tend to be stereotypical. Action set-pieces are gripping, but I for one prefer less hectic camera work.<br /><br />Still this is a hugely entertaining film, plenty of action and speed that goes faster and faster as the film's story unfolds. Highly recommended.<br /><br />(Not to be confused with the 2004 Wesley Snipes film of the same name.)</p></br><a href="../users/A2R1HAXRNU0QX7.html">A2R1HAXRNU0QX7</a><br/><p>Normally, I can barely tolerate Tony Scott's frantic, even frenzied, directing style.  He's all about fast cuts, swooping angles and cursory character development.  He's often a bit like Michael Bay, with at least with a better visual sense.  His films often indicate changes in time or mood through a change in color saturation.  You CANNOT see one of his films and not constantly be reminded that you're watching a movie.  Films like MAN ON FIRE and TAKING OF PELHAM 1 2 3 give me a headache.<br /><br />UNSTOPPABLE is a film that finally has Scott back on track (pun intended).  His directing style hasn't changed...heck, it even stars his constant collaborator Denzel Washington.  But the story matches his style.  A runaway train, however scary such a thing might be, can pretty much only go straight and predictably...but Scott's over-baked sound mix, crazy editing and challenging camera angles make this hurtling train feel like a living monster.<br /><br />The story is set in Pennsylvania.  At one end of the state, a bunch of useless railyard workers, through a series of bad choices, send a train pulling a large load of toxic chemicals on its way with the throttle down and no one on board.  Coming in the other direction are various obstacles...and another freight train carrying experienced railman Denzel and rookie conductor Chris Pine (from the recent STAR TREK).  Eventually, these two guys find themselves needing make some difficult choices in order to try to stop this crazy train from killing thousands of people.  That's really about all the film is about...yet it is very gripping.<br /><br />We learn (or feel like we're learning) a lot about the workings of trains and rail systems.  Rosario Dawson, in a thankless role, is the person in the control booth with all the lights and microphones and computers around her (you know, sort of like the room Washington sat in for most of TAKING OF PELHAM...).  Her job is to spout statistics and physics, and to get into ridiculous yelling matches with the corporate suits, who can't make a single reasonable decision.  It's one thing to try to cast scorn on corporate types...it's another to make them behave about as brightly as a teenager in a slasher movie.<br /><br />But the movie rests very comfortably on the shoulders of Washington and Pine.  Washington is in coasting mode, relying primarily on his still considerable charisma.  But he's smart and funny, and is simply a professional doing a great job of playing another professional in another profession.  But best of all is Pine.  I liked him a lot in STAR TREK (as Captain Kirk), but I worried that he was getting by on good looks and a smart mouth, coupled with a spectacle of a movie.  But here, he's still "hunky", but he feels blue collar and convincing.  When called upon to act bravely, he doesn't come off as a hero, but as a guy making tough choices in order to protect loved ones.  The two men have good chemistry...there's a little bit of the "old timer giving the new kid a hard time" banter...but less than I would have expected.  I wouldn't say their scenes are particularly well-written; they simply do a nice job with what they've got.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the two trains hurtle, helicopters fly, mishaps and crashes occur all leading up to a remarkably tense and exciting final 15 minutes.  UNSTOPPABLE is not a classic action film...but it is a very worthy effort and it made for an excellent evening at the movies.  I also liked that it is a comfortable PG-13...there was plenty of noise and crashing, but no gratuitous death and gore.  It was a good blue collar film about some great blue collar guys.</p></br><a href="../users/A1V3TRGWOMA8LC.html">A1V3TRGWOMA8LC</a><br/><p>Unstoppable is a really pedestrian film that bad in all departments except that Denzel helps drag it above the quality level of an episode of Burn Notice. The basic premise is that a train carrying some toxic chemicals has been sent on its driver-less way because the driver decided to get out of the hotseat after pressing the "Go" button. The obstacles and problems are all the sorts of things you'd get at a Screenwriters 101 course:<br /><br />- There is a train full of schoolchildren coming the other way.<br />- The head boss corporate guy is trying to cover it up and/or cut corners.<br />- There's a nice little town in the way that looks like Main Street 50 years ago and it's going to get wiped out.<br /><br />Although not a total train wreck (excuse the pun), I think director Tony Scott needs to step up his game.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>UNSTOPPABLE is adrenaline-driven escapism at its best.  Cliches?  Yes, but in an expected way.  We watch this movie to see the train run away.  The subplots are the necessry "evil", but Denzel Washington and Chris Pine are appropriately likeable so we care about their personal crises/cliches.<br />Director Tony Scott keeps the action moving and the camera/stunt crew are professional.<br />It's entertaining and worth a look!</p></br><a href="../users/AUUH6Z8MSGGF.html">AUUH6Z8MSGGF</a><br/><p>"Unstoppable" was directed by Tony Scott and stars Denzel Washington, Chris Pine, and Rosario Dawson in this story of a half-mile long runaway train that is compared in dialogue to a missile heading towards very populated areas. These characters all dance around the train, but the train itself in all its fire engine red glory is the star. How I wish they had just put more stuff in front of the train for it to destroy...<br /><br />The movie introduces the characters quickly. Chris Pine is Will, a rookie conductor trying to make ends meet while being separated from his wife and kid after a misunderstanding. Denzel Washington plays Frank, part of the old guard in the train yards and resentful of newbies coming in and taking their jobs. There's a bit of tension but eventually they will begrudgingly respect each other through the upcoming crisis.<br /><br />Some dimwits eating fast food and rushing their word accidentally set a large train in motion that has failed air brakes and accidentally put itself into gear. In a different light, the director could've played the possessed train with a taste for vengeance card, but instead it focuses on the fact that the doofusses were being morons. Rosario Dawson plays Connie, the woman communicating between all the trains and attempting to avert disaster while being stuck under management's thumb.<br /><br />Something that really bothers me about Tony Scott films is the shaky, blurry camera work to introduce a movie and make it INTENSE. He did the same thing with another train film, this one underground "Pelham 123". It's almost unwatchable. Very predictable. Dan turned to me before it started and asked, "How much you wanna bet it opens with a sunrise coming over the train yard with a train drifting into view" and BAM! There it was. Our big bad mean train is so cleverly painted RED so you'll never miss it in any shot. The little tiny train that Frank and Will drive is blue, the same color as Thomas the Tank engine and it's old and has everything against it, but darn-it-all, it's going to be the "little engine that could" by the end of this, you can just smell it.<br /><br />The train's speed starts high and just gets higher. Even when it's going 10mph, it looks like it's going 60 in the opening shots so the challenge Tony Scott has to face is how to make an already ridiculously fast looking train, get FASTER! There are tons of close calls and a cheap teases that children are going to be injured. And "Unstoppable"? Spoiler alert, it's false advertising. ;-)  Fine for a random high-speed action movie, but you won't really care about the characters, just the train hitting stuff.<br /><br />Bonus Features:<br /><br />The Bonus Features are all starring THE TRAIN. In "The Fastest Track: Unleashing Unstoppable", Tony Scott discusses his love affair with helicopters, using them, shooting from them and how no one does train movies (except him I guess) and he really loves trains. In "Derailed: Anatomy of a Scene", you get to see the behind-the-scenes look at...a really fast train and the stunts that go along with it. Specifically in "Hanging off the Train: Stunt work", you see Chris Pine getting pelted with Sugar Puffs five inches away from serious injury. "On the Rails with the Director and Cast" is where the cast and Tony Scott stop and talk about how important it was to have such a good story and these "well-developed" characters (two of which work at Hooter's) and how that factored into deciding to do the movie. Yeaaaahh. I'm pretty sure it was for the train. ;-) There's another feature on script development, but we know that part wasn't extremely important and audio commentary with director Tony Scott involves him talking about the characters and story, but he really focuses on trains, cars, and helicopters.</p></br><a href="../users/AGKPTMTR3UX1R.html">AGKPTMTR3UX1R</a><br/><p>There was a 1986 film called RUNAWAY TRAIN with Jon Voight. There was the exciting 1974 version of THE TAKING OF PELHAM ONE TWO THREE with Walter Matthau and Robert Shaw. There was the not-too-exciting 2009 version of THE TAKING OF PELHAM 1 2 3 with Denzel Washington. Everybody I knew who had seen the original was convinced it was going to suck, and it did. Nevertheless, Tony Scott liked his own work in PELHAM 1 2 3 so much that he immediately rehashed it with UNSTOPPABLE, another Denzel Washington movie. Denzel, who used to do Oscar-caliber work such as PHILADELPHIA and MALCOLM X, is definitely on the downside of the hill and is in danger of being typecast as Choo-Choo Charlie. In PELHAM 1 2 3, he played the emotionally conflicted subway dispatcher. Here, he plays an emotionally conflicted locomotive engineer.<br /><br />UNSTOPPABLE is the story of a freight train loaded with hazmat cars that somehow gets away from the railmen and, engineerless, goes careening through rural Pennsylvania toward a large city. If the train derails in said large city, it will be the American Chernobyl. While this disaster is hanging over their heads, three quarters of everybody in Pennsylvania is standing around near the tracks watching and waiting for the train to derail. In real life, the mass evacuation spoken of in the film would have been a panic-stricken mass evacuation, not an excuse for a Statewide block party. Denzel is the engineer of the lone locomotive that is chasing the runaway train in order to hook up and possibly bring the thing to a halt safely. Unfortunately, UNSTOPPABLE never really gets moving; despite the suspenseful premise, the film lacks any real suspense since it is so full of cliches and set-piece action that we know how the film is going to end just as soon as it starts.<br /><br />There are no surprises in UNSTOPPABLE. We've seen it all before, and although it's worth a watch, it's not really as "unstoppable" as it is "totally forgettable."</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>Okay, let me describe Unstoppable. The plot is basic, the acting is secondary, and the whole semi-boring idea of a train on the loose kept me away from seeing Unstoppable in theaters until two weeks after its release. I watched it with a few of my relatives in town for Thanksgiving and everyone said that they enjoyed it, but it's one of those you can easily forget as soon as you make your way from the theater to your car. There will be little to no discussions afterwards, other than saying it was entertaining. I've seen plenty of movies where that alone is not a bad thing, though most don't have Denzel Washington in the lead role and cost over 100 million dollars. Denzel and Chris "Captain Kirk" Pine do share a couple of moments of good chemistry, on top of likeable performances. There are also some nice realistic action sequences mixed in with genuine moments of suspense. I'm going back and forth on a three or four star rating, but I think I'll have to take off a star for the sheer lack of depth. Still a fun ride worth catching.</p></br><a href="../users/A9LAPV8XNKZVZ.html">A9LAPV8XNKZVZ</a><br/><p>Pretty much all possible. The basics are all accurate. Mistakes compounded endanger many.

A single sloppy employee could cause such colossal havoc by his mere inability to run, walk, or climb stairs? In a modern high tech world, a train company has no remote access to the engine of an unmanned train? It sounded like 9/11 revisited, where simple human failure could cause such immense loss of lives.<br /><br />It starts with a heavy weight, unfit, and apparently semi-dead employee who was entrusted to drive a freight train. The moviemaker would put that poor guy in many spots along the scenes in order too invoke anger on his miserable human condition. Aside from such petty display, the photography of the scenes was mediocre at best with poor angling and zooming that made things unreal.<br /><br />Even though the action was unstoppable, it was shocking to see the dismal technical failure of a train company where no one seems to know how to stop an unmanned train. With the millions of dollars spent to build such vast resources, a remote control from Toys-R-Us would sound a perfect solution to kill the engine of fright train that ran loose from a sleazy employee.<br /><br />The first attempt to slow the train, with another leading train, sounded foolishly stupid according to any law of conservation of momentum or energy. The second method of shooting at the fuel tanks of the train with police guns sounded equally stupid. Then came the derailing blocks that shattered on impact. Dynamiting the rails have been played in movies for many decades and would have stopped the unstoppable train in a safe location. It is hard to imagine that the state of Pennsylvania lacked such expertise in explosives similar to those deployed in Yugoslavia and Iraq where structures were hit from hundreds of miles away with GPS technology and laser guided missiles.<br /><br />The third attempt to pull the train from its rear end did not differ much from the first one. So, where did all the brains migrate? It started with an attempt to land a man on the train from a Helicopter.  Yet, somehow all the Helicopters that were shown in the movie could not catch up with the 70 mph unmanned train. Who did? an off duty worker chasing the train on parallel roads in his pick up truck?<br /><br />It all sounded like some heroes from the far past have come to live to save a freight company that could not afford to hire a high school pupil knowledgeable with the laws of motion. What started with dropping a man into the train cabinet, ended by accomplishing that with twists of cursing, heroism, and plenty of bureaucratic red tapes. Every police officer shown in the movie appeared miserably overweight and could hardly breathe, let alone think or act.</p></br><a href="../users/ACMAUJEBY6GJF.html">ACMAUJEBY6GJF</a><br/><p>...and enjoy this popcorn-flick?? Rather blow out your brains! Poor script, action-sequenses so overdone it makes the Lethal weapon-movies seem deep and realistic. The characters are so unsympathetic you don't care about who gets run down or not. The beginning was promising yes, but not longer than when the train takes a stroll on its own, if I'd been a railroad-worker I'd really be offended by this movie. These guys here appeares as idiots one by one. The "best" part is when Denzel becomes Indiana Jones and jumps his way across the runaway-units before one of the worst endings I've ever experienced at the cinema.<br /><br />Based on a true story??

Nice train graphics - ahhh, the power of computational software.<br />Negatives:<br />(1.) Really bad script in which the writers must have spent their entire lives at Hollywood Senior High; adjacent pools and clubs. Obviously from the dialogue and human interactions they never had a blue collar working job or perhaps even seen one (except, maybe, the service industry).<br />(2.) Really miscast actors who must have watched old movies to figure out how to play their roles.

The personal interludes to, supposedly, develop the human character side of the story so that it's just not an action runaway train flick seemed plastically robotic and really badly artificially scripted.

The story is extremely contrived. Some idiot lets a train loose and of course, its full of toxic chemicals, that can destroy much of a city. Then we have an evil business owner more concerned with money than peoples' lives so making it worse, a manager who is a white and also more concerned with money than people who makes it worse, a black woman and she is both a manager and a good guy and Denzel Washington, who is both the victim of this cruel business and the hero. In the meantime, we get a few hair raising scenes, nothing that seemed believable.<br /><br />The acting was reasonable. Chris Pine's character development was I thought bad while Denzel Washington, who is a good actor played well.<br /><br />I do like a good action movie but I think the story just let it down.</p></br><a href="../users/AW1493ZQTQ2ET.html">AW1493ZQTQ2ET</a><br/><p>This is a decent action movie, and it's not a small accomplishment that they were able to make the story of a runaway train fairly interesting and quite suspenseful.  The acting is also pretty good, with Denzel Washington delivering as usual, though some of the characters are somewhat cliched.  Also, I do think there's a bit of a plot flaw in the sense that a little creative thinking reveals some easier ways to stop that train, but that's not a major problem since most people probably won't think of these ways during the movie.<br /><br />On a more technical point, I have some professional experience with failure investigation, and I'd like to note that this scenario for developing a runaway train isn't unrealistic.  It may seem too coincidental for so many things to go wrong, both at physical and psychosocial levels, but that's generally how major failures happen.  Such coincidences are rare, and that's why major failures are rare, but in a big and complex world, they're inevitably going to happen now and then.<br /><br />Recommended if you're seeking basic action-oriented entertainment.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RHQMV5GD18Z8.html">A2RHQMV5GD18Z8</a><br/><p>Unstoppable (action, drama, thriller)<br />Directed by Tony Scott<br />Starring Denzel Washington, Chris Pine and Rosario Dawson<br /><br />20th Century Fox | 2010 | 98 min | Rated PG-13 | Released Feb 15, 2011<br /><br />Video:<br />Video codec: MPEG-4 AVC<br />Video resolution: 1080p<br />Aspect ratio: 2.40:1<br /><br />Audio:<br />English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1<br />French: Dolby Digital 5.1<br />Portuguese: Dolby Digital 5.1<br />Spanish: Dolby Digital 5.1<br /><br />Subtitles:<br />English SDH, Cantonese, French, Mandarin (Traditional), Portuguese, Spanish<br /><br />Discs:<br />50GB Blu-ray Disc<br />Digital copy<br /><br />The Film 4/5<br /><br />After directing movies about planes, cars and a submarine, Tony Scott's last two efforts have involved trains. The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3 used a train as a setting, but Scott goes a step further in Unstoppable, making a train one of the movies' stars. Trains are big. Scott has Washington walk in front of a few at the start of the movie to show us just how big they are.<br /><br />An irresponsible worker makes two mistakes that set events in motion, deciding to move a train without connecting the air brakes and then leaving the cabin to pull a lever at the side of the track. The train is moving too fast for him to get back on and pulls away under full power.<br /><br />Will Colson (Pine) has been a conductor for four months. He reports to work and faces resentment from the older workers. They assume he's inexperienced and think that younger, cheaper workers may be a threat to their own job security. He's assigned to work with Frank Barnes (Washington), who has similar feelings. Colson makes a couple of mistakes and Barnes thinks his fears are justified.<br /><br />The runaway train is initially thought to be a "coaster," but it soon becomes clear that it's under power and capable of traveling at approximately 70 mph. An early effort to board it fails, so a decision has to be made. Yard Master Connie Hooper (Dawson) suggests derailing it before it reaches populated areas. Her bosses disagree because they are worried about the financial cost.<br /><br />Various other attempts fail to stop the train and it's left to our heroes, Barnes and Colson, to try their own solution. They give chase in their train and plan to link up with the runaway and use their own brakes to stop it.<br /><br />Other factors are also thrown into the mix. A group of children on a school trip are on a train on the same line as the runaway and the threat of a collision is high. The runaway is pulling half a mile of freight cars and several contain volatile chemicals. The track leads to a curve which has a speed limit of 15 mph and it's close to a heavily populated town.<br /><br />Just enough time is given to establishing the back stories of Barnes and Colson and it explains their motivations for chasing down the runaway. The tension builds throughout the second half of the movie and the action rarely allows us to take a breather. Failed attempts early in the story show us that our heroes are in danger if they continue the pursuit, but the alternative is a potentially huge disaster should the train derail.<br /><br />The story doesn't sound very complicated and it isn't. The action takes center stage, but what did you expect? I found myself engaged throughout and the three main actors put in good performances. I'm rarely disappointed by Washington and I also liked Pine and Dawson here.<br /><br />Video Quality 4.5/5<br />Unstoppable looks good on Blu-ray. Scott seems to have made some of the colors unnaturally bright, making everything stand out. The train in particular looks imposing with its red and yellow paintwork. Detail is excellent throughout and the print is clean. It felt like most of the action was taking place right in front of me.<br /><br />Audio Quality 5/5<br />Nominated for a sound editing Oscar, Unstoppable sounds great too. The DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 mix places us in the middle of the action. Trains aren't just big, they're heavy. The track makes us aware of that with a pounding rumble that will give your sub a good workout. It's backed up by the squeal of brakes and metal-on-metal.

Scott has made a largely believable story which includes characters with a little depth. It has plenty of replay value because I have already watched it three times and it's still an enjoyable ride. If you like movies such as Speed, you'll probably get something out of this.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>This movie does indeed roll along like a freight train. Predictable but great action. Predictable but great acting from Denzel Washington and Chris Pine. And the best part: the movie ran at just over 90 minutes breaking from what seems to be Hollywood's latest unwritten law that says movies need to run past the 2-hour mark. Thanks, Tony Scott.<br /><br />Scott likes the train business I guess and he brought Denzel with him again after they rode <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002LMV7Q6">Pelham 1 2 3</a> together back in 2009. And it's funny....Either a major coincidence has occurred or Tony Scott said to Denzel, "Could you just play the same character that you played in our last movie?" Come to think of it, I think Denzel has played the same character in his last 20-something movies. Clearly the guy has just found a character comfort zone that he knows the audience will love every time. And indeed the Denzel character works. The last time I saw Denzel not playing the same character that he was playing in Unstoppable was all the way back in 1992's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0045D3N3O">Malcolm X</a> (he played Malcolm X).<br /><br />I was definitely entertained by Unstoppable. Simple story: A careless accident causes a freight train to go on a runaway path unmanned and at full throttle. Washington and Pine are respectively engineer and conductor in the field who take it upon themselves to come up with a plan to stop the out of control train. And of course Denzel's corporate superiors, government emergency forces and the cops are all idiots (as Hollywood so predictably and consistently casts). Director Scott keeps the movie rolling down the track with some decent suspenseful action as the mild mannered combination of Denzel and Chris Pine attempt to save the day.<br /><br />All in all, excellent rental but far from worthy of purchase for your collection. At minimum check it out when it comes out on cable or satellite.</p></br><a href="../users/AHBNPMHDWZ7SB.html">AHBNPMHDWZ7SB</a><br/><p>Unstoppable has a few great things going for it. First of all, the cast is great. Denzel Washington, Chris Pine, Rosario Dawson and Kevin Dunn turn in good performances all around. The tension is on point for pretty much the entire time. I saw many people in the audience on the edges of their seats. Literally. I'm not just saying that because it's the cliche thing to say about a suspenseful movie. I heard plenty of gasps and 'oh no's' throughout the film, so it accomplished it's goal to exhilarate. Problem is, it fails to rise above what you see in the trailers. Big freight train carrying toxic chemicals is on the run, unmanned, and two unlikely partners have to save the day. Sorry for the cliche, but this movie is just the same old s**t on a different day (but with convincing characters). The main problem is just as I stated above. This movie is nothing more than what you see in the trailers. So if you liked what you saw, this is right for you. If it looked lame from the get-go, then guess what? ... Exactly. That said, I was actually one who thought to myself, "what the hell are Tony Scott and Denzel Washington making another train movie for if the last one (Pelham 123 remake) wasn't well received?" They have teamed up to make some pretty good movies in the past, or at least decent ones to other people that I loved (Man on Fire, Deja Vu, Crimson Tide).<br /><br />This movie falls closer along the lines of another Taking of Pelham 123, but much more exhillerating. That could be a good or bad thing, depending on your point of view. I've come not to expect much from Tony Scott, and that usually works for me.  If you take him at face value, you may enjoy most of his lesser appreciated movies more than you expect to. Another huge issue I had were the quick cuts, and the unsteady camera. How old are the gliding camera shots that pan across actors' faces when they're talking? I'm fairly tired of it, personally, but I can accept it when it shows a cinematographer's intent on doing something to aid the suspencs. And after the third camera shot from the tracks, beneath the train as it passes over, I got a little aggrivated. These old, and often annoying methods can work, and not irritate people like me if only the director and director of photography would learn the concept of moderation. Once, or even twice is fine, but beyond that is just overkill. These methods do work at getting some people in the audience's heart rates slightly elevated, but overall, they often end up coming off as cheap gimmicks when overdone. Now don't get me wrong. I recommend this movie, but barely.</p></br><a href="../users/AHIK7BUXFRMT8.html">AHIK7BUXFRMT8</a><br/><p>As an action movie fan I could be expected to enjoy Unstoppable, but to our surprise, my wife, who is not usually an action movie fan, enjoyed it too. The movie gets off to a fast start and picks up speed from there; by the time the movie is over your ready for a rest.<br /><br />Both Denzel Washington and Chris Pine turn in effective performances drawing the viewer into the action. This is a worthy addition to the collection of any action movie fan. I recommend it highly.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>An obviously fictionalized retelling of an actual event, `Unstoppable' is fast paced and engaging from start to finish, despite its limited themes.  In the film version of the story, an unmanned train wreaks havoc as it gains speed and becomes uncontrollable.  A veteran railroad engineer, recently given his `notice', decides to play hero while out training a rookie train conductor.  The pair, oddly mixed yet more similar than expected, take on the treacherous task of manually stopping the train.  Thanks to the chemistry between Chris Pine and Denzel Washington, `Unstoppable' maintains our attention, and deservedly so.  The plot at times seems farfetched, and the action can seem over the top and yet it all works thanks to some spitfire editing and sharp direction from Tony Scott, the lesser (yet the vastly underrated) of the two Scott brothers.  With nicely shot cinematography, expertly used visual effects and an effective score, `Unstoppable' is a lot more fun and thrilling and memorable than one may expect.  The rather unexpected heaps of praise the film received were certainly justified.  It's an obvious fabrication of actual events in order to heighten the `thrill factor', and yet it reads honest thanks to the dedication from everyone involved.  This is one of those summer flicks you won't feel guilty about watching over and over again.</p></br><a href="../users/A2OFSDJB3MVQ16.html">A2OFSDJB3MVQ16</a><br/><p>With the fifth pairing of actor Denzil Washington and director Tony Scott, this film is a blockbuster in terms of quality and action.  What's more the pairing of Washington and newcomer Chris Pine, fresh from his "Star Trek" stint as the young Captain Kirk, provides some sparks in this already suspense film inspired by a true incident.  The supporting cast is fine also with Rosario Dawson fine as the train company's superintendant, and Kevin Dunn as the CEO eager to save face at the expense of equipment and lives. I saw this film in a good theater with DTS sound and the same holds true for the Blu-ray edition of the best action film of 2010!  If you want a demo disc to show off your home theater system, you can't go wrong with this film or the latest "Star Trek" reboot by J.J. Abrams.</p></br><a href="../users/A2H44WVZS59KKT.html">A2H44WVZS59KKT</a><br/><p>Non-stop action from the very start.  You would think with an entire movie about a runaway train that there would be some spots that would lag - but not so.  The action just keeps coming in this movie.<br /><br />Casting was perfect.  Denzel Washington - need I write more?  Chris Pine, a favorite since the latest Star Trek movie.  Rosario Dawson and Kevin Corrigan didn't have huge roles as Connie, the yardmaster and Inspector Werner but they were vital, well-played roles.  Kevin Dunn played a slimeball in charge, which he always does well.<br /><br />It is very frightening to think that this movie is loosely based on a true story that happened in Pennsylvania.<br /><br />I love this type of movie - reminded me of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ICLRHK">Speed [Blu-ray</a>], <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0792838424">Runaway Train</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/079284047X">The Train</a>.</p></br><a href="../users/A2DAHERP7HYJGO.html">A2DAHERP7HYJGO</a><br/><p>I'll admit that when I first heard the storyline from the movie UNSTOPPABLE I didn't think it sounded very interesting. It's difficult to make a movie about a speeding train exciting. You know it's confined to a track and that it moves fast with the chance of slipping off the rails but how could that be exciting? The makers of this movie, especially director Tony Scott proved me wrong. And I'm glad about that.<br /><br />It's Will's (Chris Pine) first day as a conductor on a normal day for this train. His engineer is Frank (Denzell Washington), soon to retired and making one of his last runs. But their day will turn out to be anything but ordinary.<br /><br />Two goofups are at another station moving a different train. When the switch to move it to a different track isn't set, the engineer jumps down to reset it himself, leaving the train in neutral. Not only that, the air breaks haven't been set yet but since they're just moving it to another line they're not concerned. That is until the train shifts into high speed mode and leaves the station before he and his conductor can get on board.<br /><br />The train picks up speed the further down the line it goes. Without the air breaks there's no way to stop it. To make matters worse, the load this train was carrying contained dangerous toxic chemicals. If that wasn't enough, the line the train is heading down has a section with a tight curve that there is no way to make without derailing.<br /><br />The train is on a collision course with two trains on the same track. One is a group of school students learning about train safety. The other is Will and Frank's cargo train. Their train narrowly misses being demolished. After a discussion with controller Connie (Rosario Dawson), Frank comes up with a possible plan of his own to stop the train.<br /><br />As higher ups try and decide what to do Connie (Rosario Dawson) attempts to assist them. But of course they think she doesn't know what she's talking about and brush her off. They're plan is to derail the train in a smaller town with a piece of equipment that Frank has told Connie has no chance of working at the speed the train is moving. When it does indeed fail, Connie, Frank and Will follow through with their own plan, even though the top dogs have threatened to fire them if they do.<br /><br />The drama of the film escalates at the same pace the train is making. Frank and Will's train is racing against time going backwards to catch up to the non-stop express. Will they make it in time? Will their plan work? Hey, I might tell you a few things that happen in a movie but I won't reveal the end.<br /><br />Washington and Pine do a great job here as two men who just met but who become close through the situation they find themselves in. Each has problems of their own back home that play into their decision, but never to the point that they abandon the chance to save innocent lives. These are not men who became heroes over time but who have a definite moral core that guides them to make the choice to save lives.<br /><br />Based on a true story, the events that unfold in this film are set at a pace that won't allow you to sit still comfortable on the couch and not care. It draws you in, waiting to see what attempts are made, which ones work and waiting to see if the plan Frank and Will have come up with must be used or not.<br /><br />The pacing of the film is perfect. Not only does Scott gradually increase the speed of the train, he slowly unravels the stories of the two heroes as well. Back history and current situations drive them to the decision they make. And that makes for not just an interesting film but one that holds your interest from the time the train leaves the station until the climax of the film. This one is one you won't want to miss.</p></br><a href="../users/A3H9JSM1SUTE4O.html">A3H9JSM1SUTE4O</a><br/><p>It's rare when an exciting theatrical poster doesn't even begin to convey the true action of the film it's advertising! UNSTOPPABLE is old-school filmmaking notched to the nth degree.  Instead of photorealistic computer effects, director Tony Scott uses real railroad tracks, engines and cars for the high-speed race against time to stop a runaway train laden with deadly, volatile chemicals heading for Scranton, PA.  It's all "inspired by actual events."  Denzel Washington is the veteran engineer and Chris Pine is the novice conductor and it's up to them to resolve personal differences and bring this impending epic disaster to a halt.  Rosario Dawson costars.  The Blu-ray is loaded with interesting and watchable extras.</p></br><a href="../users/AS28WVBBZ3G99.html">AS28WVBBZ3G99</a><br/><p>UNSTOPPABLE is a thriller about a runaway freight train hauling lethal cargo, hurtling toward unspeakable tragedy. The action starts a few minutes into the film and doesn't stop for 1 hour and 38 minutes later when you finally exhale.<br /><br />Denzel Washington is classic in the film; a twenty-eight year veteran engineer with a quick wit and cool hand on the throttle. There are some well-worn themes; hard-working union members against incompetent corporate thugs; rough-hewn rail hands vs the mean old railroad man; know-nothing rookies vs experienced veterans; misunderstood husband with a quick temper but good heart; etc. Even these are not so tedious as to prevent enjoyment.<br /><br />It is interesting that a runaway train story, replete with cliche' screenwriting and threadbare liberal stereotypes could be so much fun. It is an hour and a half of non-stop entertainment; groans, laughs, intakes of breath, raucous cheering. This is a suspenseful action film, fraught with tension and excitement. You may find yourself on the edge of your seat and cheering aloud.<br /><br />PG-13 for strong language.</p></br><a href="../users/A1XT8AJB7S9JJG.html">A1XT8AJB7S9JJG</a><br/><p>A train with no driver filled with deadly chemicals is out of control and it is up to Frank (Washington) and Will (Pine) to find a way to stop it.

Frank and Will are the only two in posistion to be able to stop "a missile the size of the Chrysler building" before it causes an epic disaster.  I have to admit I was not excited about watching this.  I'm so glad I did.  If you looking for a movie with intricate plot twists that keep you guessing...this is not it.  If your looking for a deeply moving film that tugs at you emotions...this is not it.  If you want an edge of you seat experience that grabs you from the first scene and doesn't let go...THIS IS IT!!!  This movie is so much fun to watch, very fast moving - the defination of a white-knuckle thrill ride. Hands down the best action movie since the A-Team.  I give it an A.<br /><br />Would I watch again? - Absolutley, I felt like watching it as soon as it was over.  I would buy this!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A18G7GG53G2X8A.html">A18G7GG53G2X8A</a><br/><p>Tony Scott's "Unstoppable" is a nail biting, heart pounding, relentlessly exciting film. It takes most of the reliable hallmarks of the action picture - death defying stunts, crashes, explosions - and strips them to the bare essentials. There's no posturing, no big muscles and machine guns, no pompous dialogue, no padding of any kind. There's only a raw, primal adrenaline rush. The result is a film so taut and gripping that you're liable to lose the feeling in your hands from clenching the armrests on your theater's chair. It winds itself up at the start and keeps on winding until the spring is ready to break loose; at the end of it all, when the tension is finally released, you will breathe a sigh of relief ... and then want to experience it all over again. It's kind of like riding a roller coaster.<br /><br />This film represents a purer, healthier attitude towards the action film. It's great entertainment, yes, but it also has both a brain and a heart at work. Rather than assault us with bursts of noise and flashes of light, we're pushed into a genuinely frightening scenario and dragged along with nothing but the hope that it will somehow turn out all right. We're actually made to feel something. Better still, we're made to care about the characters, who aren't disposable war-mongering typecasts but ordinary people thrust into an extraordinary situation. If convention dictates that the key players will become heroes, at least I can take comfort in knowing that this time around, they actually earn that distinction. And no, I don't care that the film is in all likelihood a gross exaggeration of real life events - I wanted to be thrilled, and thrilled I was.<br /><br />"Unstoppable" stars Denzel Washington and Chris Pine as a pair of railroad workers. The former is Frank Barnes, a long time engineer for the Allegheny and West Virginia Railroad. The latter is Will Colson, a rookie conductor. They hit it off like oil and water, Frank and his co-workers believing that Will was hired strictly because of family connections to the union. Despite their differences, they're assigned to work a locomotive together. Frank makes it clear, perhaps a little too strenuously, that Will should ask about something if he doesn't know what to do. Will's personal problems continuously distract him throughout the day; he takes calls he shouldn't be taking, and eventually, he attaches their locomotive to too many trains. Things just don't seem to be going well.<br /><br />And it will only get worse. At another station, a lazy hostler (Ethan Suplee) fails to connect an air hose on a train that's scheduled to be moved, preventing the air brakes from working. He doesn't think this will be a problem; he'll simply hook them up after parking the train on another track. Unfortunately, the switch up ahead is not set for the right track, and when he jumps off the main engine to fix it - a highly frowned upon maneuver - the improperly set throttle shifts on its own, speeding up the train to the point that he can no longer get back on. Not only is the train unmanned, it's now on the coasting faster and faster along mainline. Will and Frank are also on the mainline. And they're going in the opposite direction.<br /><br />Keeping tabs on the escalating situation is yardmaster Connie Hooper (Rosario Dawson), who quickly learns that the some of the tanks on the runaway train are carrying a highly hazardous material. She and a number of other dispatchers work tirelessly to get all opposing traffic onto sidings, and this includes a train full of children on a field trip. They begin rallying the state police in the hopes that they can secure guard crossings in various cities. Connie also has to fight an uphill battle with her superior, Oscar Galvin (Kevin Dunn), a corporate typecast unwilling to entertain her idea of derailing the train in lightly populated farmland. Derailing the train would cost the company millions of dollars, and as we all know, money is more important than safety.<br /><br />I will now refrain from going into detail, since that would ruin the suspense. I will only say that Frank and Will get wind of the situation and decide to stop the runaway train on their own. I will also say that, from here, the film becomes increasingly nerve wracking. Many action movies are about as predictable as a Mickey Rooney/Judy Garland backyard musical; with "Unstoppable," there's no telling where it might go. The uncertainty, the sheer anticipation, is so palpable that you may lose your breath from gasping so much.<br /><br />Action films made as well as "Unstoppable" have to be treasured, for they show that some filmmakers want to do more than merely exhilarate the audience; they also want to prove that even films about runaway trains can be smart, stylish, and powerful. Watching this film, it's obvious that serious thought went into the plot and the characters. Serious thought must have gone into casting as well, for everyone involved lends believable, engaging performances. Rosario Dawson in particular is especially good, giving her character just the right balance of professional backbone and personal concern. But most of the credit must be given to Mark Bomback for his convincing screenplay, Chris Lebenzon and Robert Duffy for their editing, and everyone who contributed to stunt work, special effects, and sound. They remembered what an action film is supposed to be.</p></br><a href="../users/A2IY9M330NKBW6.html">A2IY9M330NKBW6</a><br/><p>I like all sorts of movies for all sorts of reasons. From the trash to the treasures, I'll give it a shot to show me what it's got. And I don't care as much if someone likes or doesn't like a particular film as much as I care why they like or don't like it. You can't put a film like "Independence Day" in the same category as "The Seven Samurai" but that doesn't keep me from viewing either repeatedly. Each film needs to know what it's looking to do and each needs to succeed in its own right.<br /><br />Tony Scott is a seasoned director. He usually exercises great authority over his projects and "Unstoppable" is no exception. This is just a way cool flick that will keep you on the edge of your seat for most of it. A runaway train, loaded with toxic goo and explosive goo, is barreling down the tracks and it's going to make an awful mess of things unless our heroes save the day.<br /><br />I never thought much one way or the other about what goes on in a train yard. This gave me a real eye opener on that count. I got to know about trains, routing, switching, union politics and a lot more. The viewer gets a good sense about how involved it all is. It's set in Southern Pennsylvania in late autumn. Again, Scott does a good job of giving the viewer a sense of people and place. You feel like you're there.<br /><br />The characters are good. The action is relieved by scenes of the two leads getting buddy buddy with each other, so you have a reason to care about them. Rosario Dawson is always a treat for the eyes and she has a good roll here. A note on this. The main three actors all need to do their thing in very confined spaces. Washington and Pine are in the locomotive for most of the movie and Dawson is in her office. These actors have to deliver most of their lines sitting down. If that's not a testament to their abilities I don't know what is.<br /><br />The action is good and it's smart. The writers did their due diligence on the tech stuff so the viewer gets the whys and wherefores on the gravity of the situation. There is a logical progression to the things that happen. And as they unfold I found myself getting more and more involved. It draws you in and doesn't let go.<br /><br />Is this the best movie ever made? No. But it delivers the goods in spades. If you're at all disposed toward this sort of thing, spend your money at the box office. It's a bit loud (maybe more than a bit) but seeing it on the big screen is the way to go.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>UNSTOPPABLE is a genre film - minimal story/lots of action - and as such it succeeds very well.  Probably for audience breathing time the story line introduces some psychological exchanges between the two characters - in formation about their family lives that seem oddly out of place with all the terror on the screen - and that aspect of the film adds some human drama that makes the final product more credible: it is, actually based on a true story. The fact that veteran action flick creators - writer Mark Bombeck and director Tony Scott - are 'on board' this project assures the popularity quotient.<br /><br />Frank (Denzel Washington) is an aging soon to be retired train engineer and is joined by a young, emotionally distracted but well-trained new conductor Will (Chris Pine) who are out on what seems to be a routine run in Pennsylvania.  They banter caustically until hearing that there is a full speed runaway train (engineer Dewey - Ethan Suplee - left his position in the train with the throttle on) that happens to be carrying toxic chemicals. Should the train proceed with its runaway course many lives could be endangered when the train reaches a critical curve in the tracts in Stanton , PA.  Frank decides the only way to stop the train would be to go in reverse and lock onto the back of the train, putting on the brakes to slow the runaway train.  Frank and Will decide to brave the elements and attempt this near impossible task, much against the advice of the chief Galvin (Kevin Dunn) but with the daring go ahead signal form the men's immediate boss Connie (Rosario Dawson).  During this breakneck chase Will relates his fragile marriage to a wife (Jessy Schram) who refuses to return or accept his calls and Frank confides in Will that his wife died a few years ago form cancer, leaving his the sole parent for his two daughters (Elizabeth Mathis and Meagan Tandy): they both have family deadlines to meet that very day.  How the two not only become friends but allies in heroic effort to stop the incipient tragedy makes of the ending of the film.<br /><br />Washington and Pine make fine acting partners and the off the tracks work by Dawson and Dunn and the other small parts are well executed.  The special effects are excellent.  The fact that seemingly far-fetched story is true adds to the appreciation of the film.  This is a solid action flick with some standout performances.

The objective is to get goods from point A to point B as quickly and safely as possible. Along the route there may be different switches and changeovers that may be encountered. Computers play a major role in the scheduling of trains in order to optimize the use of the rails. Over land, in terms of ton-miles hauled per unit of consumed energy, rail transport is more efficient than other means of transportation.<br /><br />This film is about a half-mile long freight train that was allowed to run away without its engineer, who was just a bit too careless and too slow. Initially it was thought that it was a 'coaster' - just rolling, but not under power, so they tried an initial interception down the track. But to their surprise, the train as long gone and now moving at a speed approaching 70 miles per hour. To make matters worse, the train has a huge amount of diesel fuel that it is carrying to keep it running, and if that is not bad enough, several of the cars contain explosive, toxic chemicals that are used to make glue.<br /><br />The Heroes:<br /><br />The guys who will take on the last effort ot stop this train are:<br /><br />- Frank (Denzil Washington) a veteran engineer with 18 years experience.<br />- Will (Chris Pine) a rookie now getting some hands-on training.<br /><br />There is a little animosity between the two initally, as Frank, sees himself as the old hand that is being phased out, and replaced by an inexperienced novice, with only theoretical training. However, when the crisis arises, they set aside their differences and rise to the challenge.<br /><br />The Experience:<br /><br />Watching this movie is a riveting experience. The momentum (mass x velocity) of the trains come across the screen big time. There are close passes and near misses that can make you sweat just watching them. There is a lot of stunt work especially at the ending. You can really get into this movie as the tension continues to build. The end is indeed quite rewarding, and you know that you have been taken to the edge and back again.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br /><br />What I like about this movie is the way that it captures the determination and resolve of the human spirit, to risk everything for the safety of others.</p></br><a href="../users/A2A6NH6DPE0VXR.html">A2A6NH6DPE0VXR</a><br/><p>Frank (Denzel Washington) an Engineer and his rookie Conductor, Will (Chris Pine) find themselves up against a runaway train that only they can possibly stop.

Simple enough when  the local commuter train, then soon to be abandoned in the 1950s golden age of the automobile, the highway and the Howrad Johnson's (and subsequently McDonald's) pit stop night, came tooting its lonesome whistle in the high North Adamsville night. Or that same fascination held up later when I took my first baby steps on the endless search for the great blue-pink American West night and wound up a few time travelling in some desolate empty  box car pushing the Southern Pacific high desert night. And no question, even now I have very strong memories of what Tom Waits called in one of his mule variation day dreams- "living on train smoke and dreams."<br /><br />But enough of nostalgia, earned or not. For the film under review, Unstoppable,  is a very different cinematic look at the modern day train experience on the American tracks. Trains and disaster, or the threat of disaster,  are no strangers today, and have not been since the beginning of the railroads. The runaway train that stars in this film, the old 777 running highly dangerous cargo through rural Pennsylvania in this case, is just a continuation of the danger associated with tangling with the train smoke (from whatever fossil fuel used). And this saga is based on a real incident too boot.<br /><br />Through carelessness (and corporate speed-up policies) a railroad man makes a series of wrong decisions about how to fix a problem on his long-line freight train. And the thing takes off-ummanned. Naturally all hell breaks loose as everyone from the yard master to corporate headquarters tries to figure out how to stop the thing short of shooting it (although that thought I am sure crossed somebody's mind). No problem though because old railroad man Denzel Washington, ready to be tossed on the washed-out heap and training his "new boy replacement,"  just happens to be on that same track coming the other way. Now once Denzel Washington is on the case, any cinematic case, from cop to Malcolm X to washed-out train engineer, one can rest easy. Sure there will be a couple of close calls, quite a few actually, in the hour and one half of the film but at the end of the day no highly explosive cargo is going to harm urban areas. No way. Now we can all go back to thinking about train smoke and dreams.</p></br></body></html>

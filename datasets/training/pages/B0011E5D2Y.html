Here we have a movie with two of the most solid new comic movie personas with in the last ten years and they're teamed together.  These two fit together on paper let alone on the first day of production so the film is filled with charm and humor, but for anyone who thinks this film is just for the guys to go to, or trick their girlfriends/wives to seeing, there's a strong them within the film about love and it's so strong that I wouldn't even call it a subplot.  What's interesting is that there are elements of the mainstream chick flick in this film, making it highly accessible.  The problem I have with this film is that is just doesn't seem like a natural fit, but all the necessary parts are there.  They just don't quite fit to me. As much as I like the fact that the film presents a really strong female character and is also a semi-sex comedy is good news, but the film doesn't mesh these two elements together in a good way.  Don't get me wrong, the film would be totally able to get away with its lack of attention to finetuning if it didn't stop for the love story angle, the poignancy allows you to see just how shoddy it is.  While I know that the films are as different as fruits, "There's Something About Mary" was the last raunchy comedy to succesfully pull off the love angle and still feel well done and while other Farelly Brothers films of similar plotline haven't had the courage to go as far and limit their hijinks to pg-13 levels of vulgarity and profanity.  I think a film can be funny without that stuff, but that's not the kind of movie I'm reviewing.  I'm reviewing a balls to the wall, 'uncorked' movie full of profanity, sex, and nudity.  A film that lets it all hang without concern for rating knowing that it's geared to an older audience.  I understand all the people that applaud this film for going there and being funny while also attempting to be poignant, however, it wasn't a good idea for them to release their film around the same time only to compared to "The 40 Year Old Virgin" which has it beat on poignant points and might be funnier in a more realistic way than "Wedding Crashers."  "Wedding Crashers" made more money and so my opinion doesn't really matter, and I'm in the minority, but the film isn't completely bad, it just isn't well done in my opinion and there are things in the film that are memorable, like Will Ferrell's character at the end and Vince Vaughn's turn into love, but overall, it's a movie of excesses that it can't legitimize dramatically (and by dramatically, I mean they could have been more fun).</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>Comedies based on ideas and lines that play for laughs at the expense of other people's dignity have been increasingly flooding the cinema market in the past years.  They usually tend to be summer blockbusters and because they make a lot of money and attract record crowds there must be need for them. Go figure.<br /><br />Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson as divorce mediating wedding crashers whose chronic hobby is to womanize during women's most vulnerable hours (weddings) is the theme.  The first half hour of this overly long (two hour) movie traces them through many a varied wedding circumstance where they prevaricate their way into people's acceptance, the reward being to bed the most gullible females present.  Weddings have been used ad infinitum as theme parks for humor, some clever (Four Weddings and a Funeral) and others not.  This one falls into the latter category as it takes a premise to extremes then shifts focus in the last half hour in an attempt to redeem itself.<br /><br />There are some talented actors in the cast but few of them are given enough material to justify their inclusion.  Jane Seymour in a Mrs. Robinson role has moments, but Christopher Walken as a government bigwig falters.  A new face, Rachel McAdams, is welcome and acts as the only truly thought out character in the story.  But you have to be in the mood for some cruelty of language, some toilet humor, and a tolerance for over-extended ideas to make it through this one.

When they decide to crash the most important wedding of Washington pretending they are brothers, in a party promoted by the Secretary of Treasury William Cleary, John breaks their rules and has a crush on Claire Cleary and Jeremy scores the sex-addicted Gloria Cleary, both daughters of William. Gloria invites Jeremy to spend the weekend at the Cleary family estate, and John sees the chance to be close to Claire, in spite of her engagement with the arrogant Zachary "Sack" Lodge. Along the weekend with the dysfunctional Cleary family, John and Jeremy will fall in love for the sisters, but their real identities jeopardize the relationship.

Besides they were forewarned that this is an R-rated comedy!!  Not since Carl Reiner's classic R-rated comedy, "Where's Poppa", never have I laughed so much in a theatre--and I've seen this flick 3 times-twice in a theatre, once on video.  Vince Vaughn really scored big in this film even more than Owen Wilson and he's probably the only reason one would consider seeing his next film, "The Break-Up".  If there were any awards for comedy, one should go to Vaughn for this hilarious film. I guess the only complaint I had about this film were--where were the beautiful Africain American sisters since the duo did score with the Indians, Hispanics and the Jews in their scam.  Anyway if you're ever depressed, go check this out--it'll cure you of the blues!!</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>There was a lot of buzz surrounding this film back when it was released, and I must admit that while upon repeated viewings it doesn't hold up as strong as it once did it is still extremely funny.  Yes, `Wedding Crashers' may be one clich&eacute; after another, but those clich&eacute;s are strung together so effortlessly that you can't help but fall for each and every gag.<br /><br />The film follows two friends, John and Jeremy, who make a habit of crashing weddings to score with single chicks.  When they crash the wedding of Secretary William Cleary's daughter, Christina, they wind up on an adventure they didn't bank on.  At the wedding they each set their sights on one of Secretary Cleary's other daughters; Jeremy targeting the nymphomaniac Gloria and John seeking out the beautiful, yet spoken for, Claire.  When they wind up invited to the Cleary's estate for the weekend (who in their right mind would invite two men they've never met to their home for the weekend) hilarity ensues.  While John is busy trying to woo Claire away from her controlling boyfriend Zachary Jeremy is trying to ward off the advances of Gloria.<br /><br />I've never been a huge fan of Owen Wilson, and I still hold firm to the belief that he is only really `good' when paired with Ben Stiller (together they are flawless).  Here he winds up being the more straight laced actor and, while he has a few funny lines, really leaves the comedy aspect of the film up to scene partner Vince Vaughn.  `Wedding Crashers' marked Vaughn's rebirth so-to-speak, revitalizing his career thanks to one hilarious performance here (although I saw this coming since his glorious `Old School' turn).  I've always been a huge fan of Vaughn and loved some of his earlier work (I just adore his performances in films like `Return to Paradise' and `A Cool Dry Place') but it seemed like Hollywood had forgotten about him; and then there was `Wedding Crashers' and his career has never been the same.  I'm happy for him; he deserved it.<br /><br />Isla Fisher is really the standout here.  She has, undeniably, the scene-stealer role of the film and she does just that; steals scenes.  As Gloria she is sensual, abrasive, obnoxious, psychotic and most of all hilarious.  Rachel McAdams does a fine job as Claire in a role that is far less attention grabbing.  She is such a beautiful and talented actress.  I can't wait to see her career skyrocket.  Jane Seymour has a surprising turn here as the Secretary's unhappy wife and Ellen Alberti Dow is her usual funny self as the Cleary Grandmother.  Christopher Walken is quite simply Christopher Walken (shouldn't he be in like every movie).  Keir O'Donnell is a bit over the top as the strange Cleary son, Todd, and Bradley Cooper is kind of annoying as Zachary.  There is a brilliant cameo by Will Ferrell towards the end that makes me wish he had a larger role in the film.<br /><br />`Wedding Crashers' is not a god-send but it is well worth the watch through.  There are moments when the laughs will come so hard there will be tears and then times when the laughs are more of an embarrassed laugh.  It's truly a mixed bag, but there is more good then bad here, that's for sure.</p></br><a href="../users/AWG2O9C42XW5G.html">AWG2O9C42XW5G</a><br/><p>This Movie is Hilarious, Vince Vaguhn & Owen wilson are hilarious in this movie. this is a good buddy flick i loved this film it's funny as hell. everyone has to see it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1B05INWIDZ74O.html">A1B05INWIDZ74O</a><br/><p>Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson show us in this film that they are a great comedy team. That play a pair of long time friends who are close and have the same strange vacation.... the Crash Weddings.<br /><br />The movie sets us up with a montage of how they crash these weddings. And we see that not only do they have a great time, free food & drinks and always get their woman...but also they do it in such a way that you do not hate them. They seem to be the reason the wedding is so much fun. And you know that you would want them to crash your wedding. I think we are also shown this to see that they have developed a formula that they have found to be very successful.<br /><br />Everything changes when they add one more wedding they did not plan for. A wedding of a daughter of a very powerful Washington, D.C. political family. The move in with their formula, but then things starts to go wrong and they start breaking their own rules. And they start to get really involved in the lives of the girls they are chasing and their family.<br /><br />The movie is very funny, but has moments that are tender. Almost turning into a Romantic Comedy, but right before that happens, we get pulled back into the comedy and it breaks the moment. Though you know it was there. It is as if the first half of the movie was written as a pure comedy and then the last half the writers wanted to show character development and slip into a Romantic Comedy. It still works, but if they had gone for one genre it would have been much better. Still worth watching</p></br><a href="../users/A2MFNDNS1L7D16.html">A2MFNDNS1L7D16</a><br/><p>I went for rhe extra unrated 81/2 minutes on the dvd. It's a great adult if not always mature movie. In fact you might say it's charming. Owen Wilson as John & Vince Vaughn as Jeremy certainly are. Lots of cameos such as James Carville & John McCain seemingly together in the background of a wedding<br />scene. Jane Seymore has a small part as the horny mother of the bride. I've always liked her, especially topless.<br />  John & Jeremy crash weddings. Lots of them. They have it down to a science & take great pride in doing it well, that is without getting caught. They even have a book of rules that are scared & not to be violated. The object? To get laid. There are lots of unattached young ladies who are caught up in the strong romantic emotions that weddings evoke, waiting to be plucked.<br />Secretary of the Treasury William Cleary, played by Christopher Walken, is having a big wedding for one of his daughters & it promises to be the social event of the summer.  John & Jeremy have had a sucessful season & this would be the topper.<br />  You may guess what happens. They break the most important rule: Do not fall in love. Worse, they fall in love with secretary Cleary's daughters. It is fast paced, funny, sexy humor. Lots of profanity, which doesn't really detract. A universal theme most prople have thought of doing a one time or another. Enjoy.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>The Frat-Pack, are surely the hardest working collective in Hollywood. Hardly a couple of month's goes by without a movie featuring Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughn, Jack Black, Will Ferrell, or those Wilson boys Luke and Owen being released. When Starsky and Hutch paired Owen Wilson and Ben Stiller it was good, when Dodge ball put Vince Vaughn with Ben Stiller it was better, but "Wedding Crashers" could well be the finest Frat-Pack pairing to date.<br /><br />Although Wilson and Vaughn have appeared in four movies together so far, this is the first where they've both taken star billing. "Wedding Crashers" is at times formulaic, the comic performances raise this movie above par and in lesser hands the main characters could have descended into Rom-Com clich&eacute;. The fast-talking machine-gun delivery of Vaughn is the perfect accompaniment to Wilson's laconic style. Their single-guy banter's often painfully accurate, as is the acknowledgement they're both a little too old to be acting so carelessly. There are also some great comic set-pieces too, notably the divorce meeting, the weddings montage, the cringe-worthy football game and the hunting trip.<br /><br />The supporting cast are also an asset, Christopher Walken expertly walks the tightrope of being both broodingly intimidating and likable, while Rachel McAdams' 'Claire' has a charming vulnerability and an easy-to-fall-in love with quality. Former "Home and Away" pin-up Isla Fisher however, is less convincing.<br /><br />I admit "Wedding Crashers" is far from perfect, at time situations seem too contrived, the nudity is laughably gratuitous, and Claire's evil fianc&eacute;e Sack (Bradley Cooper) is an almost too heavy-handed device to make Wilson look good.<br /><br />But if you can look past all that, and simply accept it for what it is, you're left with a very funny film.</p></br><a href="../users/ACMAUJEBY6GJF.html">ACMAUJEBY6GJF</a><br/><p>...in the typicall Owen Wilson-kind of comedy. I'm surprised that Ben Stiller didn't co-star in this as well (I guess he was occupied elsewhere at the time?) -point is; If you''ve enjoyed comedies such as Dodgeball, Meet the parents/Fockers, There's something about Mary, Along came Polly, well, here's your cup of tea. I know it is mine -these comedies circles between being witty -and totally insane! This is crazy humour! And so stupid it is charming if you ask me.<br /><br />The only unecassary thing about "Wedding crashers" is that it lasts for 2 hours. It isn't that funny, and could (or should) have been edited down to one hour and a half in my opinion. I prefer comedies that doesn't drag out any longer than absolutely necassary, "There's something about Mary" this way is funny from beginning to end.<br /><br />Another thing is the suprisingly sweet, and far too easy ending -not that you expect too much from this kind of comedy -but the "I'm sorry, I've really learned my lesson"-speeches have been an over-clishe since long ago -but, but... No disaster anyway, just expected something a little more weird.<br /><br />Recommended comedy!</p></br><a href="../users/ATU6AN7OFVO0M.html">ATU6AN7OFVO0M</a><br/><p>The movie was great and a must have in every serious DVD collection. I Just hoped that they release all of the rules by number in this DVD, which they didn't. I guess there were not that much rules. anyway, this movie was great. and unrated DVD is strongly recommanded.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RKI7RPP5CJMG.html">A2RKI7RPP5CJMG</a><br/><p>"Wedding Crashers" is a very funny film.  It's got more laughs and potty humor in it than you can shake a stick at.  It's almost perfect, but there's one flaw.  It tries too hard to appeal to both men and women at the same time.  It takes raunchy fun and tries to couple it with a romantic comedy.  The two genres rarely mix well.  Considering this, though, the film is worth multiple views.<br /><br />Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson are two buddies out for a little tail.  In order to achieve said goal, they crash weddings and go after just about every lady in the joint that isn't a bride.  They charm old folks and amuse the youngsters in an attempt to grab the eyes(and hopefully the panties) of some young woman in the crowd.  They do all of this by a set of rules set by the original wedding crasher, who we run into at the end of the film.<br /><br />Christopher Walken plays the father of Rachel McAdams in this film.  Owen Wilson's character falls for her when he grows tired of chasing women all of the time.  His buddy, played superbly by Vince Vaughn, has to take on McAdams' sister, played by Isla Fisher.  Fisher almost single-handedly steals the show as the psychotic, sex-crazed nympho who literally takes down Vaughn.  The ever lovely Jane Seymour plays Walken's wife, and the rest of the offbeat family is wonderfully acted out.  I won't give away the identity of the actor playing the original wedding crasher, but I will say that his performance was a bit too much at times.  He's funny at first, but much like Stiffler in the "American Pie" films, he begins to be annoying after awhile.<br /><br />If you enjoy gut-laughter, this film is for you.  It runs a tad bit long, especially with the romance between Wilson and McAdams.  However, when the laughs start, they hang around for quite some time.<br /><br />I've noticed how some reviewers find this film to be offensive and degrading to women.  Grow up!  If you can't handle flicks like this that want to have FUN, then you should know better than to watch this type of film.  If you think this flick is degrading to women, I suggest "The Sweetest Thing," with Cameron Diaz and Christina Applegate.  In it, the boys get the shaft instead of the stereotypical chicks in "Wedding Crashers."<br /><br />Had "Crashers" stuck with the buddy concept and made this a "guy movie," I'd have given it five stars.  However, with the romance taking up a little too much time, I'm forced to give it a four.  We need more "guy movies" these days.  People are so hung up on being politically correct that we're risking the ruin of the adult comedy.  Thanks to Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson for taking a chance with this comedy.  It's well worth purchasing.</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>Commitment. The concept continues to elude many men like the idea of taking a shower after working out. Divorce mediators Jeremy Grey (Vince Vaughn) and John Beckwith (Owen Wilson) have a most unusual hobby that allows them to pick up women seeking commitment but avoid the dreaded band of gold themselves-crashing weddings! This clever duo can masquerade as friends of the family regardless of who is involved. When Jeremy learns that the daughter of the Secretary of the Treasury (Christopher Walken) he and John do the old Potomac Two Step and waltz right in as if they are close friends of the family. What they find is...love, desire and a family as nutty as a fruit cake. John is immediately taken with Claire (Rachel McAdams) while Jeremy finds her sister Gloria (Isla Fisher)attractive, frightening and a handful.<br /><br />A genre mishmash of a buddy/romantic comedy, "Wedding Crashers" works so well not necessarily because of how good the material is (and it is pretty good) but due to the deft talents of Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson in the lead roles. Both give charming performances and the marvelous supporting cast provides perfect counterpoint to these charming rogues. "Wedding Crashers" became the biggest comedy of the summer and deservedly so.<br /><br />Featuring a stellar transfer that looks as bright detailed as a designer wedding dress, "Wedding Crashers" looks and sounds marvelous in this edition. Using the seamless branching technique that worked so well for "Gladiator: Special Edition" and "Alien", "Wedding Crashers" can be viewed in either its original R rated format or unrated. The unrated edition runs a little over eight minutes longer and primarily consists of scene extensions. The images are vivid with bright lively colors. I didn't detect any sort of digital artifacts and analog defects are nonexistent. The 5.1 format isn't used as well as an action movie but there are nice effects placed all around the speakers. Dialogue is crisp and clear which is what you want in a comedy.<br /><br />We get some interesting extras here.  We get deleted scenes, two featurettes one that shows how the weddings were staged for the movie and the second featuring actors Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn discussing "The Rules" of wedding crashing. Likewise "The Rules of Wedding Crashing" are presented in text format with all the rules discussed by the main characters. The first featurette is the best and at under 12 minutes your attention won't wander. The second is a more traditional promotion piece. The third will make you wish you were dancing at someone's reception as your butt falls asleep. We also get trailers, a track listing for all the songs used in the film and music video by The Sights of the song "Circus". There's also DVD-ROM content allowing you to compare the script to the final film and some other goodies that will make your crashing experience perfect.<br /><br />We get two commentary tracks with stars Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn providing play-by-play on the film. Their commentary track is a bit less informative but funnier than director Dobkin's who focuses much more on the production challenges of the film itself. Together they represent the perfect commentary track with just the right amount of background information and irreverence.<br /><br />A delightful romantic comedy, "Wedding Crashers" took many by surprise earning its place among the top performers of 2005. Families should be warned, however, that "Wedding Crashers" isn't for everybody as it earned its R rating for sexual content. The unrated version features about 8 minutes of additional footage extending several scenes but honestly the theatrical version was just great the way it was.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>"Wedding Crashers" starts off gathering a lot of momentum.  When we first meet them John Beckwith (Owen Wilson) and Vince Vaughn (Jeremy Grey) are helping the Kroegers (Dwight Yoakum and Rebecca De Mornay) work out the final division of property for their divorce.  The two are snipping at each other until Jeremy begins speaking rapturously about how great weddings are, which serves not only to take the Kroegers down memory lane to a place much happier than getting a divorce but also sets up the coming montage in which we see the "Wedding Crashers" in action.  We understand that the whole point of crashing weddings is for the guys to pick up women, but it is also clear that these two are the life of whatever wedding they show up to, whether the happy couple are Jewish, Chinese, or whatever.  There is, if the truth be told, a lot to be said for faking sincerity.<br /><br />As we are dragged alone through this introduction to the boys, we start to learn about "the Rules" of crashing weddings: (1) Whatever it takes to get in, get in, (2) Never use your real identity, (3) You're always from out of town, (4) Walk in as if you own the joint, (5) Blend in by sticking out, etc.  Actually the rules do not pop up numerically and sometimes it is clear that John and Jeremy are just saying things and tacking on numbers after the fact to make them rules.  But while the whole idea of having a set of sure fire rules for not only successfully crashing a wedding but also picking up girls at the crashed wedding and protecting your fellow wedding crasher, the script by Steve Faber & Bob Fisher decides to take the boys off of the map.  The eldest daughter of William Clearly (Christopher Walken), the U.S. Treasury Secretary, is getting married and since getting in would be pulling off the mother of all wedding crashes, the boys do their homework (not enough as it would seem) and crash the wedding.<br /><br />But at the wedding John finds himself falling for one of the bride's sisters, Claire (Rachel McAdams), while Jeremy finds the third sister, Gloria (Isla Fisher), has become attached to him in more ways than one.  The former becomes the film's serious relationship while the latter becomes the comic one, and while Jeremy has to deal with the complication of Gloria being both a "virgin" and a "stalker," John has to contend with Claire having a long-term boyfriend (Bradley Cooper).  This results in John and Jeremy being invited back to the Clearly compound after the wedding, which is major mistake since this clearly violates several key rules expressly designed to save the wedding crasher from crashing and burning.  John has some initial success in keeping all of his plates in the air spinning, but you can see disaster coming, coming around the bend, especially when the boyfriend gets suspicious about the two unexpected guests.<br /><br />The Clearlys are a strange family.  The father is played by Christopher Walken (enough said), while the mother, played by Jane Seymour, stopped being faithful two years into her marriage and has designs for Jack.  Meanwhile, Jeremy has to worry not only about Gloria, but her brother Todd (Keir O'Donnell), for reasons that become painfully obvious.  Then there is the fact that Clarie's boyfriend plays touch football like it is a grudge match in rugby.  Oh, and did I mention that the nicest thing Grandma Clearly (Ellen Albertini Dow) has to say at the dinner table is that Eleanor Roosevelt looked like a dyke?  This is a strange bunch of people and my basic problem with this film is that Claire does not fit in.  This is a woman who cannot keep a straight face during the wedding because the bride and groom are working in god awful sailing metaphors into their wedding vows, but has been dating her boyfriend for over three years without noticing he is a condescending jerk (when he is at his best).  Forget about falling for a wedding crasher, she needs to ditch this guy regardless of what else is happening in the universe.<br /><br />Fortunately there are enough funny bits in the movie and the decidedly different comic performances by Owen and Vaugh to make it worth watching, although in the end I find myself rounding up not because John learns valuable lessons about love and stuff, but because Jeremy does in a comic twist that actually plays better than the serious relationship the story is trying to spawn between John and Claire.  Unfortunately none of what is going on really sets up the film's final joke, which is too bad because it affirms what I got out of the opening sequences of the film where these guys really like weddings apart from the picking up girls and scoring part.  Most of this two hour movie takes place when there is not a wedding going on, which might be the best indication of where it goes wrong.  "Wedding Crashers" is one of those movies where when it is done I think, good first draft of the script and start coming up with ideas to make it better.</p></br><a href="../users/A16IXZW2A0NFR6.html">A16IXZW2A0NFR6</a><br/><p>This movie is the funniest movie of the summer, it is absolutly hilarious. It's nice to see a good R-rated comedy again, there aren't to many of them anymore. Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson are a match made in comedy heaven, they play off of each other so well it hardly seems like acting. This movie is the feel good flick to see. Go see this movie you're not likely to be disappointed.</p></br><a href="../users/AW99SBGWEXP0J.html">AW99SBGWEXP0J</a><br/><p>John Beckwith (Wilson) and Jeremy Klein (Vaughn) are wedding crashers.  At the beginning of "wedding season", they map out plans to hit all the big weddings.  They go the the weddings, pretending to be distant relatives of the bride or groom, and soon are partying away at the reception.  Of course the ultimate goal is to hook up with a woman, and they do.  Over and over again.<br /><br />After the season is over, they are presented with a bonus round.  The oldest daughter of William Cleary (Walken), Secretary of the Treasury is getting married.  They are successful, and soon John finds himself falling for the bride's sister Claire (McAdams).  On the down side, Jeremy finds himself stalked by the other sister, Gloria (Fisher).  When the secretary takes a liking to the boys, he invites them to a private party for the weekend.  John is excited, Jeremy is not, and soon both meet Claire's fiancee Sack (Cooper).<br /><br />"Wedding Crashers" is a funny movie.  Wilson and Vaughn have the buddy vibe going, and their interactions all seem genuine.  They both have their moments to shine, but Vince Vaughn really cranks it up a notch as he tries to avoid Gloria and the gay brother.  This movie is similar in tone to the "American Pie" movies as well as comedies from the 1980's.  It is a good end of the summer diversion, and will not disappoint fans of the genre.  I recommend.</p></br><a href="../users/A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ.html">A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ</a><br/><p>Okay, I can finally review this film legitimately. I posted a previous review that complained that they don't release the UNRATED versions at the movie theatre. I mean, think about what a ridiculous practice this is.  Imagine if they had released an edited version of ANIMAL HOUSE at the movie theatre and later an UNRATED version... BLAZING SADDLES, CADDY SHACK or STRIPES.<br /><br />Honestly, I'm not sure what I'm complaining about, because I save money by not going to the movie theatre and later buying the ENTIRE VERSION OF THE FILM LATER ON DVD. It's just why go to the movie theatre to see an edited version?<br /><br />Okay... yada, yada, yada... the movie:<br /><br />The movie is very well done and unlike most movies that are made these days, will probably be remembered for years to come. With its no-holds-barred approach to the subject of irresponsible sex it manages to combine a lot of realism and truth to an absurd situation. You know, because we've all probably met somebody just like these guys. In fact, we've all probably been a little like them at some point in our lives.<br /><br />The movie is well done and is gifted with numerous surprises and unorthodox story-telling WHICH IS GREAT!! BECAUSE LIFE IS UNORTHODOX! Human nature is unexplainable and people do crazy and unexplainable things.<br /><br />Wedding Crashers tells the story of two professionally single guys who basically crash weddings looking for sex with women. They're pros at it, but a trip to the wedding of Secretary Treasurer William Cleary's daughter sends them down a path of looniness, romance and sex.<br /><br />They soon find out that the wealthy and privileged aren't immune to being dysfunctional families and when the heart wants to take you somewhere, the mind is powerless.<br /><br />WEDDING CRASHERS has numerous memorable scenes that will have you in stitches. Vince Vaughn is fantastic as a selfish, fast-talking snake oil salesman with the soul purpose of GETTING SOME. In fact, everybody in the cast did fantastic. The guy who played Todd Cleary (Keir O'Donnell) killed me every time he appeared on screen. No words. Just his look. Isla Fisher was charming, dirty and hilarious. Grandma (Ellen Albertini Dow) was fantastic. I remembered her instantly as the rapping grandma from THE WEDDING SINGER. Rachel McAdams was beautiful as could be, and I had no problems believing that Owen Wilson's character would fall for her at first sight.<br /><br />I don't have a whole lot to complain about with WEDDING CRASHERS. It was a really good and memorable movie, but I just wish, as unorthodox and fresh as the movie was, that the ending had not been so CLICHE'!<br /><br />Owen Wilson even says at the end... "Would it be too cliche if... " YES! IT WOULD! It was a tremendously funny, original comedy with a cookie cutter cliche' ending that kept me from giving it the full 5 stars. Otherwise... the UNRATED UNCUT version is out... go rent it or buy it.</p></br><a href="../users/A6ADO7B6FUVN.html">A6ADO7B6FUVN</a><br/><p>Smitten by love, a conceptually romantic idea, eventually guides many couples to the altar where they promise each other an everlasting union until death do them part.  The truth, on the other hand, reveals a much different picture whereas one out of two marriages from the 1990s have already faced divorce.  This means that honor and integrity in regards to the wedding vows does not seem to be a priority among many divorc&eacute;es.  Divorces are also painful experiences where the splitting party must dig up the old affairs to settle who gets what.  In this emotional mess, lawyers often become meddlers for each party.  In the middle of these difficult divorce intricacies John Beckwith (Owen Wilson) and Jeremy Klein (Vince Vaughn), two divorce consultants with an expertise in human interaction and relationships, work in a booming business nourishing on many broken hearts.<br /><br />Marriage is something ancient and best buried, or at least that is how John and Jeremy see the matrimonial commitment that marriage brings.  Thus, it is with a heavy dose of irony that these two take ecstatic pleasure in weddings.  They approach wedding ceremonies like a colossal smorgasbord of consensual women during the peak season of weddings, a season they celebrate, as the wedding season.  The wedding season for John and Jeremy is what Christmas is to kids, or hunting season is for a hunter, as they set out to conquer women.  For the simple reason of getting women into bed the two 30-something divorce consultants crash weddings, which they do in a deceitful and manipulative manner in order to unlock the heart of women with reckless abandon.<br /><br />A funny analogy can be drawn from the two best friends, John and Jeremy, who work with other's misery like vultures sitting on a desert telephone pole waiting for their prey to die when they crash weddings.  Yet, they are social chameleons that easily mingle and make friends with their fake identities based on extensive research.  All of the befriending and manipulating has one ultimate goal to achieve a brief moment of physical pleasure.  This suggests that John and Jeremy never have experienced strong affections for someone more than the moment of love making.  Thus, these two mutate into a crossing between scavenging vultures and unfeeling reptiles while deceiving the wedding guests with their charismatic charm in order to successfully achieve their quest for gullible women.<br /><br />In one scene, John briefly questions the moral meaning of what they are doing, which Jeremy rationalizes to the point where doubt no longer is present.  Nonetheless, the notion of deceitfulness remains within the audience while the story trots along.  After the lengthy introduction where the main characters crash several weddings, the official story begins when they crash a sophisticated upper-class wedding held for the politically influential Secretary of Treasury Cleary's (Christopher Walken) daughter.  At the wedding John encounters something for the first time that he has a hard time expressing for his friend Jeremy.  His eyes fall on the maid of honor Claire Cleary (Rachel McAdams), and from that moment on it is evident that John has fallen in love.  Jeremy is not as lucky at the wedding, as he gets himself into a heap of trouble with a slightly disturbed girl that will provide much belly-aching laughter.<br /><br />After the wedding, John and Jeremy are invited to the Cleary's where they are introduced to a rather eccentric family on many levels.  Rachel McAdams' character, Claire, whom John has fallen in love with seems to be the only character that comes across like a caricatature.  This occurs while the rest of the family might qualify for a wide range of psychological disorders.  For example, her fianc&eacute;e is a relentless Ivy League alpha male with psychopathic tendencies and her nasty homophobic grandmother openly assaults her own grandson in the presence of others.  It is a unique family environment in which John tries to win over Claire, by being himself, which is something new for him.  This will naturally set up some obstacles for John, but with the help of an agonized Jeremy he might succeed.<br /><br />Wedding Crashers is a candid and fun loving comedy that reaches deep within the society to pull out a wide range of expressions for love through a large number of characters.  The exaggerated characters shed light on contemporary issues that relate to love.  At times, it feels as if Puck (character from Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream) would jump out, which is a sign that this is a solid comedy with a little seriousness and cheerfulness.  This takes place as the story actually brings out some of the true qualities of human beings that often are tabooed, or neglected.  The director David Dobkin freely throws in a large number of sexual jokes in the film, as sex is a natural part of a marriage and love between a loving couple.  Thus, some scenes will likely offend some while many will find it difficult not to laugh.  In essence, Dobkin pokes at love through a wide spectrum of societal values while maintaining the strength of ambiguity that travels with the phenomenon of love.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DY46ZABF4CMQ.html">A3DY46ZABF4CMQ</a><br/><p>Vince Vaughn (Psycho) and Owen Wilson (Bottle Rocket) team up in the comedy Wedding Crashers which also stars Christopher Walken (The Deer Hunter), and Rachel McAdams (Red Eye).<br /><br />The movie is not all that funny. In fact, I only giggled a few times at some of the jokes and one-liners, and laughed to myself at how bad and cliched the rest of the movie was.<br /><br />Vaughn and Wilson have got to be two of the most annoying, obnoxious, and overrated actors working in movies today. Crashers portrays them both as players who crash weddings to pick up girls. Their game turns on them when they crash the wedding of the Secretary of Treasury's, played by Walken, daughter. They both hit on two other daughters of the Secretary and find themselves falling in love.<br /><br />As you can see, I didn't go into details nor did I use concise plot points to discuss Wedding Crashers because I find it all a waste of my good time.<br /><br />Wedding Crashers is one of the worst films of 2005.<br /><br />Not recommended<br /><br />D</p></br><a href="../users/A3NM0RAYSL6PA8.html">A3NM0RAYSL6PA8</a><br/><p>I could list all the problems with Wedding Crashers, from its generally formulaic story, to its decent, but entirely unimaginative directing, to a script that doesn't give the stars a heck of lot to work with, and, finally, to a blas&eacute; ending.  But, despite all of that, it has a number of geniunely funny moments, genuinely beautiful women of all stripes, and solid performances from Owen Wilson (who I generally like) and Vince Vaughan (who generally repulses me).  The two work well together, albeit with a minimal amount of chemistry between them, and the supporting cast members, including the always entertaining Christopher Walken, are a nice treat. (Will Ferrell's cameo performance was incredibly lame.  Or am I just getting sick of Ferrell's one-note schtick?)<br /><br />This a fun rump.  A guilty pleasure.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CYRTQ04LYI55.html">A1CYRTQ04LYI55</a><br/><p>Hard to go wrong with a movie starring Vince Vaughn and Christopher Walken.  This is a humorous movie with the simple premise contained in the title - two friends (Vaughn and Owen Wilson) base their social life around wedding season.  Of course one has to expect some real romance to come out of it too - otherwise there wouldn't be a movie.<br /><br />Vaughn shows his manic greatness as expected, and carries the movie.  Despite that, the best pieces are in the crashing scenes in the beginning.  Not enough material in that for a two hour movie, and the movie slows down considerably as it extends.  Still a good movie, but not a great one.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>I'm surprised that "Wedding Crashers" did not get more recognition when the critics were rounding up the year in review.  In a year when most films underperformed "Wedding Crashers" far exceeded anybody's box office predictions.  Noteworthy is that it solidified Owen Wilson's standing as a leading comic force, magnified Vince Vaughn as a star to be reckoned with, and broke two of the more appealing actresses on the screen today, the fresh-faced Rachel McAdams and the saucy redhead Isla Fisher.  Bottom line is this is a funny, funny film.</p></br><a href="../users/A140XH16IKR4B0.html">A140XH16IKR4B0</a><br/><p>Bads boys John Beckwith (Owen Wilson) and Jeremy Grey (Vince Vaughan) are divorce mediators. But when springtime rolls in and the wedding season gets under way, they become weekend wedding crashers, pretending to be part of the family in order to score free food and loose women. They are very good at what they do, but are beginning to think they might be getting a little old for the game<br /><br />Anyone who can't guess that by the end of the film they will have abandoned their wayward ways and found true love should not be allowed to rent or buy this movie.<br /><br />"Wedding Crashers" is goofy and charming. It's probably one of the best buddy movies of recent years. Vince Vaughn, especially is terrific. It is a relief to know that some actors can still summon up a range of facial expressions. Vaughan runs through expressions with a rapidity and intelligence that was often hard to keep up with. Wilson was adequate, and shone brighter in the glare of Vaughan's over-the-top persona. Together, the two of them captured the hedonistic approach of these overgrown juveniles. They were great together and really came across as the life-long friends they were supposed to be portraying, who (for all their purported selfishness) actually brought life and joy to the weddings they crashed.<br /><br />Kudos to Isla Fisher and Jane Symour, who played the sisters (Gloria and Kathleen Cleary) who got entangled into the boys' scheming. Isla was positively terrifying as the "clinger" who latched onto Jeremy. And Seymour played just the right mix of beauty, charm and vulnerability as the girl Wilson wants to rescue from marriage to a lout.<br /><br />The only downside to "Wedding Crashers" (and which loses the movie 1 star) is the gratuitous nudity, language and vulgarity that the writers threw in. But the film made me laugh, which is a rarity these days.<br /><br />The DVD version has the usual deleted scenes (lame) and director's commentary, which I did not listen to. It also includes an "uncorked" version which is 8-1/2 minutes longer than the original. Given the level of raunch in the theatrical version, I did not want to go near material that didn't make the cut. YMMD.<br /><br />On the whole, a charming and satisfying movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MUD2VY9HWFXQ.html">A2MUD2VY9HWFXQ</a><br/><p>John (Owen Wilson) & Jeremy (Vince Vaughn) are best buds. They've known each other for 17 years, work together, and in there spare time crash wedding parties; where they drink like sailors, mingle with unsuspecting relatives, and hit on single and willing brides maids every chance they get. They have a whole science to their crashing ( rules and all), and have become quite adept at the sport.<br /><br />That all changes when they attend a wedding held by Secretary Cleary (Christopher Walken), whose daughter is getting hitched. During the lavish formal affair, Jeremy makes headway with Cleary's physcopath daughter Gloria ( a hilarious Isla Fisher), while John slowly maneuvers his way into the life of the Secretary's other daughter Claire (Rachel McAdams), who just happens to have a steady bo' of her own.<br /><br />Eventually, after all the formalities-- the two are privately invited back to the Secretary's estate, where they play touch football with the family, have formal dinners, sail out on the boat, & get hit on by the Secretary's sex starved wife (Jane Seymour) & his homosexual son Todd (Keir O'Donnell).<br /><br />Its all very funny and silly- but the great chemistry by Wilson and Vaughn helps the film move at a steady pace. The supporting roles of McAdams and Fishler are nicely fleshed out as well. While no means a great movie, "The Wedding Crashers" is quite funny at times, and overall enjoyable.<br /><br />Some people have called this a raunchy, gross-out comedy; although I noticed nothing of the sort. Besides the dialogue and a few breast shots, theres really nothing raunchy or gross-out about "Wedding Crashers" at all. It certainly wouldnt fall into the category of "Something About Mary" or the "American Pie" movies.<br /><br />Vaughn and Wilson definitley shine throughout and appear to be having the time of their lives here....<br /><br />Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A33IZJVCKFKDPU.html">A33IZJVCKFKDPU</a><br/><p>Ever since "Old School" was released in 2003, there have been several movies that have basically the same cast of actors.  Those actors are Vince Vaughn, Will Ferrell, Ben Stiller and one of the Wilson Brothers.  I think this is a great group of guys to co-star in comedies together.  They each have their own respective comedic styles and when put together, it feeds well off eachother.  "Wedding Crashers" is the latest collaboration of this group of actors, and once again the results are similar.<br /><br />The premise of "Wedding Crashers" is that a couple of friends, John and Jeremy (Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn), have a annual tradition of going to weddings by pretending to be family friends.  The purpose?  To pick up on girls that are so caught up in the loving, romantic atmosphere of the wedding that they will be willing to do pretty much what John and Jeremy want.  BRILLIANT!!!  At a wedding for the daughter of Secretary of State (I think) William Clearly, John falls for one of Clearly's other daughters, Claire.  Jeremy on the other hand "makes love" to Clearly's youngest daughter, Gloria.  Well Gloria turns out to be a pyscho that immediately falls in love with Jeremy and invites him and John to spend the weekend at their house.  From there, funny situations happen.  The Clearlys find out that John and Jeremy aren't who they claim they are and John and Jeremy learn that their ways are wrong and become new men.  Pretty much the standard for romantic-type comedies.<br /><br />First of all, this is Vince Vaughn's movie.  He is the star.  He has the funniest scenes, the best one-lines and brings the best presence to the screen.  I'm not a big fan of Owen Wilson's comedy, but he did a fine job in this film.  The movie itself was really funny.  The only problem that I had with it is that it was too long and that it got really slow in the last twenty minutes.  Also, you get to see some topless women, so thats always a plus.<br /><br />Overall, I really enjoyed this movie.  As mentioned earlier, Vince Vaughn completely carried this movie.  Without him I don't want to think of what this movie might have been.  Its definitely a good choice if you're wanting to see a movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PIX2K56IZZYX.html">A2PIX2K56IZZYX</a><br/><p>This movie was about 30-45 minutes too long. It's like I saw two different movies shoved together so they could succeed in getting a two hour comedy movie released. I am a firm believer in the fact that I don't mind if a comedy is short in the 70-85 minute range as long as it's funny, and this one was that movie, but it just kept going and going. So, let's talk about the first half of the movie, or the 4-star part....Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn are professional wedding crashers, and they are extremely talented at it, they are sure to get every slightest detail down so no mistake can be made, and for a while everything is going fine, they are eating, drinking and freakin' everything in sight. All the while making us laugh....alot. The lies and the facial expressions these two come up with are just plain priceless. The chemistry between Vaughn and Wilson is perfect, as expected, what is this the 4th or 5th movie they've been in together?<br /><br />Eventually, Wilson falls in love, breaking 1 of the some thousand wedding crashing rules, and to top it off, the woman Wilson fell in love with (the lovely Rachel McAdams) is the daughter of Christopher Walken, who just happens to be running for office. To add more crazyness to the plot, Vaughn's character nails another one of the daughters, who in turn falls in love with him. Got all that? Good, moving on....The dialogue between Wilson and Vaughn is very funny, most of the jokes work, and while a bit raunchy here and there, it fits well. Now here's where things start to fall apart, both with the movie and our heroe's.<br /><br />The second part of the movie, or the 2-star part, goes all out on Hollywood cliches' We get the family bickering, the big 'fight' between Wilson and Vaughn, the speech during the wedding , it just seemed forced and that they just ran out of good jokes, so they recycled some old, lamer ones. I saw the ending coming a mile away and the edge and character the movie had is all but gone now.<br /><br />So, I gave 4-stars and 2-stars, another bit of the 4-star part I rather enjoyed are the minor roles played by Jane Seymour, she plays Christopher Walken's drunk wife with new breasts, and Will Ferrell (surprised? nah, me either, I think there is an agreement  with these 3 men along with Ben Stiller to appear in everyone of each other's movies. just a thought) as Chaz, the legendary wedding crasher Vaughn and Wilson are always quoting. He plays a man in his late 30's, still leaving with his mother, now crashing funerals cuz' it's so easy to get laid by a depressed chick, or so Ferrell says.<br /><br />There are many subplots, most I didn't care for, but be sure and check out Vaughn's confession to a preist at the breakfeast table........priceless!!! and Jane Seymour's half-ass attempt at seducing Owen Wilson with her new ta-ta's, very funny!!<br /><br />acting......4 stars, You know you can't go wrong with these two<br /><br />directing....3 stars, 30-54 minutes too long<br /><br />special effects...N/A, comedy here, not thrills and chills<br /><br />comedy rating .....4 stars first 70 minutes, 2 stars after that<br /><br />quality........3.5 stars, Decent picture quality, little grain, but great soundtrack</p></br><a href="../users/A35YWA2V4QHOJ3.html">A35YWA2V4QHOJ3</a><br/><p>Good party movies are entertaining & funny.  The very best party movies, many times quite unexpectedly, actually have a heart.  WEDDING CRASHERS is a movie that belongs in the latter category.<br /><br />As is known by most people before they watch it, the plot centers around two 30-something bachelors who arrive as unexpected guests at weddings of people whom they don't even know.  The plot is actually believable;  how many people do you see at weddings that you've never seen before in your life?  The objective, of course, is for them to "score" with the chicks who feel all Romantic and sensuous after the wedding festivities.<br /><br />While juvenile, the plan goes smoothly until one of them makes the critical "mistake" of falling for a girl he meets at a wedding.  From there the movie almost (and I stress almost) goes from being a party movie to being a Romantic comedy.<br /><br />The cast is splendid with Owen Wilson up to his usual tricks and Rachel McAdams as the sweet & loveable and innocent heart-stealer (not to mention eye-candy!).  20+ years after SOMEWHERE IN TIME, Jane Seymour is still gorgeous.  Christopher Walken is great as the intimidating father figure.  It's a delight to see distinguished actors like Seymour & Walken in a cinematic farce like this.<br /><br />If you like party movies or Romantic comedies, you'll more than likely fall for this one.  So, if you're not busy on a Saturday night, maybe it's time to crash a wedding!</p></br><a href="../users/A39W3263A9HCMN.html">A39W3263A9HCMN</a><br/><p>We saw Wedding Crashers on wednesday.

I reccomend this movie to you if you like comedy! So go see it!</p></br><a href="../users/A2EEUQ81DTY7G3.html">A2EEUQ81DTY7G3</a><br/><p>In The Wedding Crashers, Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn are lawyers who get their kicks by boozily and audaciously infiltrating the nuptials of strangers. The silly but cheerful John (Wilson) and fast-talking and manipulative Jeremy (Vaughn) have adopted an annual ritual of going randomly to weddings under assumed names in order to have a good time, picking up unattached women for quick, no-commitment trysts.<br /><br />For them it's all about the sex, drinking, and the rock and roll as they ply their trade at ceremonies of various faiths and ethnic backgrounds. Along the way the champagne flows and they get to meet lots of sexually voracious and beautiful young girls. Lately, however, their hedonistic life seems to be catching up with them - this particular season has been particularly exhausting, but when they discover that high powered Defense Secretary Cleary (Christopher Walken) is having a bash for his older daughter Claire (Rachel McAdams), they cannot resist attending.<br /><br />John falls for Claire, but unfortunately Claire already has a fianc&eacute;, in the form of the smarmy and not-very-nice-preppie Sack (Bradley Cooper). Meanwhile, Jeremy finds himself stuck with Cleary's youngest daughter Gloria (Isla Fisher), who's a real spitfire, and who mistakenly tells Jeremy that she's a virgin after they both have a quickie on the beach. When Gloria gets her father to invite the boys for a weekend at the Cleary holiday home, they discover that this family is more dysfunctional than they realized.<br /><br />The Secretary's alcoholic wife Kathleen (Jane Seymour) comes on to John, while foul-mouthed grandma (Ellen Albertini Dow) verbally assaults everyone, and spews homophobic jokes at the dinner table, especially to artist grandson Todd (Keir O'Donnell), who in turn visits Jeremy's room to make a pass at him at the very time when the poor fellow has been literally tied to his guest bed by the voracious Gloria.<br /><br />There's no doubt that the Wedding Crashers is punctuated with some funny moments, but the film is ultimately hampered by an overall sloppiness of execution and direction. It isn't nearly as funny as it should be, with the long running jokes eventually wearing thin, and the comedic elements failing to sit easily with the love story between John and Claire.  The film also drags the setup scenario on for far too long and the whole film over extends itself by about thirty minutes.<br /><br />The biggest problem with this film, however, is that it fails to be funny when it starts to take itself too seriously. In the labored third act, when its ne'er-do-well heroes inevitably go soft and redeem themselves - and a predictable and overrated guest star appears to offer an extraordinarily tiresome cameo - one gets the feeling that it's all just degenerated into a lurching, lumpy, semi-improvised sketch comedy. By movie's end one hopes that the boys contrived search for redemption should be wrapped up as quickly as possible, but here it's prolonged to such length that the movie threatens never to end.<br /><br />Vince Vaughan is a talented and funny actor, but in this movie he borders on irritating, and Owen Wilson, although somewhat sweet, would have to be one of the most innocuously untalented actors working today. Their back-and-forth frat-boy bickering is amusing for twenty minutes or so, but then steadily becomes annoying. Sloppily, directed by David Dobkin we watch John and Jeremy as they banter, crash, lie, banter, and then crash again until it all becomes a bit repetitive and stale.<br /><br />The veterans suffer too, especially Jane Seymour who ultimately has little to do. She literally has one of the best and funniest scenes in the film, yet her character is absolutely wasted; the producers could have made so much more of her. And then there's Walken as Secretary Cleary, who's portrayed as a hot presidential prospect, but quickly turns into an unrealistic dolt.<br /><br />I guess you could wrap up the Wedding Crashers by saying that it's sporadically amusing but like most weddings it generally flags in enthusiasm towards the end and the final scenes are as predictable as they are characteristically unwelcome. If viewers want to see a good, bawdy comedy that sustains the humor until the end, they should take a look at The Forty-Year-Old Virgin instead. Mike Leonard January 06.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KAR9G699RM56.html">A1KAR9G699RM56</a><br/><p>Upon entering I tried to allow all of the hype to dissipate from my mind so as not to skew my thoughts.  I think I achieved that, although for the most part I still agree with the hype's conclusion: this movie is pretty funny.<br /><br />The humor is like "Old-School" except for a certain sense of believability which set in about a third-of-the way in, (and summarily left near the end).  In addition, the same crudeness preludes, particularly in the opening five-minute scene, but also just throughout the film in general.  And that's to be expected, because this is not a drama, as much as it's a comedy about some-sort of romance.<br /><br />Speaking of the story, it's probably a good time to go into the plot.  Vaughn and Owen play two best-friend psychologists named John and Jeremy, respectively; at least I think they are psychologists (not that it really matters).  But in the peak times of eternal love, they are wedding crashers looking for short "romance", and they are rather successful wedding crashers at that.  But there would be little to the story if that was all, and it's not, so to elaborate further.<br /><br />John and Jeremy, at the pleading bequest of Jeremy, decide to pull off one of the grandest crashes yet, the wedding of the oldest daughter of Secretary Cleary.  They assume elegance will abound, and yacht talk too, but what they don't realize is that maybe this time love is in the air for them too, and away they, and we, go on their cupid journey.<br /><br />The film really isn't bad, unless you completely despise some of the slapstick/vulgar humor (which I could see why).  Most of all though, this film is pretty entertaining and rather light-hearted, and for many that's what films are about, (for better or worse).</p></br><a href="../users/A34PAZQ73SL163.html">A34PAZQ73SL163</a><br/><p>Let me say first that I have always been, and will always remain, a gigantic Vince Vaughn fan. The same can be said about Owen Wilson and his brothers. I think that the two of them are first class actors and entertainers which makes me sad to have to dissent from popular opinion regarding the worth of this film. It is not so much a movie as it is a series of soundbytes. The action is totally contrived. In the beginning, a seemingly endless sequence of wedding euphoria is rehashed wherein our two fellas are the life of every party and become the idol of spinsters, children, and grandparents. It's all very cute-too cute, in fact. It's more a trailer than a full length production. Actually, were it not for the endemic charm of Vaughn and Wilson, we would not even care about these characters in the least; they'd be a void. I think the blame for this "tries too hard" release must be placed solely on the shoulders of the director, David Dobkin as this is the first time I've seen Vince Vaughn be bad in anything. He is not believable in his role and overacts throughout. That Dobkin was able to diminish the comedic talents of Wilson and Vaughn is an ugly reverse achievement. It's unfortunate as the film could have been something because the premise was great.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>A lot of hype surrounded this film while it was in theaters and continued with its recent release onto DVD. I've lately halted when I hear resounding praise lavished on films with nary a single negative comment to be found. BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN was one such film that I enjoyed but didn't live up to the brouhaha surrounding it.<br /><br />And such was the case with WEDDING CRASHERS ...<br /><br />Although pleasantly funny and entertaining (note the "thumbs up" rating I gave it for sheer entertainment), the film lost much of its lighthearted punch as the story bogged down in the drama surrounding its two main characters, John Beckwith (Owen Wilson, STARSKY AND HUTCH) and Jeremy Grey (Vince Vaughn, DODGEBALL).<br /><br />The basic premise is about these two longtime friends who enjoy crashing as many weddings as possible. They have hundreds of rules that each of them follows ("Rule #1: Never leave a fellow crasher alone", etc) ...that is until John falls for a beautiful woman named Claire Cleary (Rachel McAdams, THE NOTEBOOK) and all bets are called off.<br /><br />John and Jeremy's friendship appears to be on the rocks as John falls harder and harder for Claire. But problems quickly arise for him. Claire is the daughter of Treasury Secretary William Cleary (Christopher Walken, THE PROPHECY), an authoritative man who wants his daughters to marry into families of wealth and power. The Cleary family is also pretty dysfunctional ("putting the `fun' in dysfunctional"). They have a son, Todd (Keir O'Donnell, IN YOUR FACE), who wants nothing to do with the family's politics and prefers painting evocative scenes in "his own blood." The Cleary mother, Kathleen (Jane Seymour, DR. QUINN, MEDICINE WOMAN), is sexually deprived and wants young men to "touch her surgically enhanced breasts."<br /><br />John clearly has a lot of obstacles to overcome ...and not just within the Cleary family. Claire's long-term boyfriend, Zack Lodge (Bradley Cooper, ALIAS), wants to know who John and Jeremy are and how they became so close to the Cleary family so quickly.<br /><br />As John's love for Claire grows, Jeremy is dragged further away from his friend by the surrounding circumstances and by another Cleary daughter with serious psychological issues that he later finds endearing.<br /><br />_________________________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />As you can see, there's a lot going on in this film. At two hours in length, it's one of the more long-winded comedies I've seen.<br /><br />Mixing drama, romance and humor is always a challenge, and director David Dobkin admirably tries to hold it all together, and on some levels he does, but the ending fell flat with no laughs and zero character growth (they just expand their wedding crasher community from two to four members).<br /><br />I will say that seeing Jane Seymour in such a different role surprised me. She played the part of a bored politician's wife extremely well. But Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn were just Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn; men who never grew up. Whenever they're on-screen together, however, there were definitely some great comedic moments ("Oh. You didn't hear. My brother had a diving accident and he's retarded now.")<br /><br />But if you're looking for a high quality comedy, this isn't it. It is funny at times, but when compared to such masterpieces as THE BIG LEBOWSKI or OH BROTHER WHERE ART THOU, it seriously pales.</p></br><a href="../users/A25AXWGBGJ5KBS.html">A25AXWGBGJ5KBS</a><br/><p>Yes, consider me shallow and superficial, but every once in a while, I like to laugh during a movie while a breast is flashed or a curse word is uttered.<br /><br />In recent years, with the PG-13-ification of film comedies, we haven't had a decent, smart, fun R-rated laugh riot.<br /><br />I take that back...wasn't "There's Something About Mary" R-rated?<br /><br />Anyways, "Wedding Crashers" is a giddy, giggling comedy about two buds who crash weddings with enthusiasm and aplomb. By their own admission, "wedding season" is better than Christmas. The opening montage sets the stage, as they crash five weddings of varying religious denominations. Right off the bat, you get the sense that they do this not just for the free food and the strategically beneficial female-to-male ratios, but because they genuinely love being there, meeting new people and in some over-arching sense, being part of the entertainment.<br /><br />Whether it's dancing with the flower girl, offering toasts in the native language, or making balloon animals for the kids (all of which can be found in the "Rules of Wedding Crashing"), you get a sense that they almost earn their free admission.<br /><br />As events lead to the big wedding-to-be-crashed, you can see for miles ahead where this film is going. You can in most comedies. But the way this film gets there is constantly surprising and entertaining.<br /><br />And funny. Funny funny funny.<br /><br />Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn make a terrific combo. They take their caricatured personas and humanize them. Wilson, the de facto romantic lead, has never been more appealing, with his laconic delivery and winning smile. Vaughn is the perfect counterpoint, with his hysterical verbal diarrhea being the source of countless classic lines. It's not that he can't stop talking...you don't want him to. And you get the feeling that the characters responding to him in the film don't want him to either.<br /><br />Rachel McAdams, last year's It girl, radiates intelligence as well as a totally approachable beauty.<br /><br />Christopher Walken does Christopher Walken and it works. You imagine people going behind his back, saying "Doesn't the Treasury Secretary remind you of Christopher Walken?"<br /><br />Jane Seymour has few moments, and tries to make the most of them. There will be one scene that most everyone will remember, and deservedly so. She plays with our preconceptions of "Jane Seymour" and she uses it to be funny.<br /><br />Bradley Cooper erases his "Alias" image as a supreme bastard.<br /><br />The poorly kept secret cameo near the end of the film was a hoot.<br /><br />But for me, the dizzying delight of the film was the outright lunacy of Isla Fisher, playing the "level 5 virgin clinger" Gloria. Every scene she's in, she gives off manic fireworks. There's the dinner table scene where she's...well...she's "playing" with Vince Vaughn. If you tear your eyes away from Vaughn's uproarious mugging, you'll see a crazed nymphet clearly teetering on the edge of psychosis. Gleefully so.<br /><br />The technical details of the film and the DVD are all fine. The supplements are enough to whet your appetite after the film, and by all means, sample some of the audio commentary by Vaughn and Wilson.<br /><br />As I understand it, the Unrated version offers a few more breasts, and some extension of "goth" brother's scenes.<br /><br />"Wedding Crashers" is a great way to laugh for two hours!</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>You will undoubtedly find much to laugh about in this risque and ribald comedy.  Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn are an exceptionally good comic pairing and they make the most of their roles as the titular characters.  They play a couple of DC lawyers who crash weddings in order to meet beautiful girls and they are very successful at it...their manipulations to get into the wedding are innovative and hilarious.  Things change though when they crash the wedding of the daughter of the Treasury Secretary, and find themselves getting too involved with their prey.  Vaughn gets snared by the secretary's sex-crazed youngest daughter and Wilson falls head over heels in love with his other daughter, who just happens to have a hulking jock for a boyfriend.  Not to mention the secretary's alcoholic nympho wife and his artistic and strange son, who may or may not be gay.  The "uncorked" version has 8 1/2 minutes more than the theatrical version, and despite its length, it maintains its level of hilarity and surprisingly enough, a wonderful male friendship without any homoerotic tendencies.  Along with the leads, the supporting cast is great:  Rachel McAdams is perfect as the fetching Claire; Christopher Walken underplays the secretary role; Jane Seymour is a vixenish hussy; Bradley Cooper is a smarmy but charming "Sack".  Cameos from Rebecca Demornay and Dwight Yoakam in the beginning are effective; and Will Ferrell even shows up as Chazz, the "founder" of the wedding crashers.  Only the movie's convoluted and highly improbable ending slightly spoils the overall effect, but what else could happen?  A big box office hit and a funny movie indeed.</p></br><a href="../users/AHABFECTNE15I.html">AHABFECTNE15I</a><br/><p>Version: U.S.A / Warner / New Line / Region A, B, C<br />Aspect ratio: 2.35 : 1<br />VC-1 BD-50 / Advanced Profile 3.1 / AACS<br />Disc size: 38,90 GB<br /><br />Dolby TrueHD Audio  English  1487 kbps  5.1 / 48 kHz / 1487 kbps / 16-bit (AC3 Core: 5.1 / 48 kHz / 640 kbps)<br />Dolby Digital Audio  English  640 kbps  5.1 / 48 kHz / 640 kbps<br />Dolby Digital Audio  English  192 kbps  2.0 / 48 kHz / 192 kbps / Dolby Surround<br />Dolby Digital Audio  English  192 kbps  2.0 / 48 kHz / 192 kbps / Dolby Surround<br /><br />Subtitles: English SDH / Spanish<br />Number of chapters: 20<br /><br />No Seamless branching.

Generally, these movies are mostly the same, but occasionally one comes along that stands out from the rest.  Some of these rarities are films such as, "American Pie", "American Pie 2", "Van Wilder", and some would even say "Old School" or even "The 40-Year Old Virgin", on the last two movies I must disagree, I hated both films.  However, one adult comedy standout of 2005 would have to be the side-splittingly hilarious comedic duo of Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn in "Wedding Crashers".<br /><br />Guided by an elaborate set of `wedding crashing rules', John Beckwith (Owen Wilson) and his best friend, Jeremy Grey (Vince Vaughn), charm their way into most any wedding, with one purpose in mind.  Hook up with some emotionally overcharged single woman, and have one night of sex, then drop them like it never happened.  Some would say this is a guy's dream come true.  Everything is going smoothly for these two `crashers' as the peak of wedding season is upon them, and go figure one of the biggest weddings ever is occurring in their very own city of Washington D.C.  As the U.S. Secretary of Treasury (Christopher Walken) has announced the wedding of his oldest daughter.  Intent on hooking up with some very rich and powerful, yet still desperate women, John and Jeremy get more than they bargained for as both of them become fixated on the other 2 daughters of the senator.  Jeremy has the misfortune of getting involved with the Secretary's somewhat crazy daughter (Isla Fisher), who after their romantic tryst has become completely obsessed with him.  While John has set his sights on the Secretary's youngest daughter (Rachel McAdams), but instead of having one night of lust, John breaks a sacred `wedding crasher' rule and begins to fall in love.  To prove himself, John drags his buddy Jeremy along to the family's estate for a fun-filled weekend that just may prove to be even too wild for these two professional party guys.<br /><br />The laughs just keep on coming in this movie, as joke after joke will leave you rolling in the aisle.  Though this movie is intended to be a comedy in every sense, there is still plenty of heart and drama to this story.  As the two main characters begin to learn that their chosen hobby is not without consequence, though nothing severe, after all this is still a comedy.  Eventually John and Jeremy realize that wedding crashing though fun, and leaving them with plenty of action, isn't as fulfilling as a meaningful relationship with a person they truly love.  The cast is spectacular and wildly eccentric from Christopher Walken, to Owen Wilson, to Jane Seymour, to Vince Vaughn, there isn't a single casting choice that could even possibly be regretted.<br /><br />If you're in the mood for a laugh-a-minute comedy, and also are not easily offended, then "Wedding Crashers" is right up your alley.<br /><br />"Wedding Crashers" is rated R for language and nudity/sexuality.</p></br><a href="../users/A22RY8N8CNDF3A.html">A22RY8N8CNDF3A</a><br/><p>"Wedding Crashers" turned out to be fun and entertaining, although watch out for some raunchy guy banter and action.  It features two great performances by Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn, who play a pair of divorce mediators.  They spend their spare time crashing weddings to enjoy good food and drink, and find the perfect woman looking for love, which, of course, ends in a series of one night stands.  Sure as every romantic comedy, one of them falls for someone already engaged.<br /><br />Vince plays his laid-back dude role, but Vince Vaughn is delightful in his part of the dynamic duo hunting for dames.<br /><br />Actually the two actors make a great pair, and bring a vibrant energy to the story.

They have characters and scenarios for themselves for each wedding and a long list of rules for how to properly crash a wedding and not get caught. Things change when they crash the wedding of one of the daughters of the secretary of the treasury played by Christopher Walken. Wilson falls hard for another daughter played by Rachel McAdams. Vaughn meanwhile slips away with yet another daughter, sleeps with her and then finds out too late that she's nuts. They get invited back to the family home for the weekend and accept because Wilson is trying to woo McAdams away from her lout of a fiancee.<br /><br />Wedding Crashers has some very funny scenes. Wilson and Vaughn work well together as friends and their interactions and banter at the weddings are fluid. The movie bogs down some with Wilson trying to win McAdams and everyone in the treasury secretary's family having a quirk to deal with. The ending also drags but overall this was a funny comedy.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JH5J1KQAUBMP.html">A1JH5J1KQAUBMP</a><br/><p>John and Jeremy (Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn), masters at the art of crashing wedding receptions to hook up with young women aroused by the prospect of matrimony, find themselves at odds with each other when John falls for the daughter of the Secretary of the Treasury (Rachel McAdams) and browbeats Jeremy into supporting him in his canpaign to win her heart.  Despite the great premise, there is not much that is fresh about this comedy, but it succeeds nevertheless because of the great chemistry between Wilson and Vaughn as well as terrific support from Christopher Walken, a surprisingly hilarious Jane Seymour (no Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman here), and a riotous cameo by Will Ferrel.  The cast works so well together that even the obligatory phony dramatics at the end can be forgiven.</p></br><a href="../users/AWJOVW1BZZ34H.html">AWJOVW1BZZ34H</a><br/><p>Two friends crash wedding parties in order to meet lonely, jealous bridesmaids and seduce them.

You can swith off and enjoy a good laugh with this movie.<br /><br />THe plot is fairly simple: two buddies gate crash weddings to hit on women and sleep with them. It happens to be something they take as an art form, and one they are pretty good at. It is when they crash the Cleary wedding that life gets interesting. Jeremy Grey, (Vaughn), gets a freaky time with one of the daughters, while John Beckwith, (Wilson), chases the other daughter, who already has a boyfriend.<br /><br />Yes, the humour is pretty crass at times, but for a good laugh that is relaxing and just plain fun to watch, this is a good choice.</p></br><a href="../users/ABX7SEE84DMLU.html">ABX7SEE84DMLU</a><br/><p>This movie has a great premise.  Yes, it requires a huge suspension of disbelief, but once you get over that reality barrier, it's tremendous fun.<br /><br />Woven into it, though, are a few themes which are not quite so obvious:<br /><br />1.  Exploiting other people by lying is not attractive.<br />2.  Rich people suck.  Or they don't, depending.<br />3.  In movies like this, everybody gets what they deserve.<br />4.  Never play touch football at a politician's house.<br />5.  Does Owen really look like he should be a family member at a ____ wedding?  (Jewish, Irish, WASP, Greek, Italian - you pick).<br /><br />The fun is totally infectious.  My favorite scene:  the opening where these two lawyers function as the funniest divorce mediators I've ever seen.  And I could not stop laughing when we find out that the couple is in a contested divorce over frequent flyer miles.<br /><br />Subtle, but really witty.</p></br><a href="../users/A2WP0GOTX13MG4.html">A2WP0GOTX13MG4</a><br/><p>'Wedding Crashers' stars Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson as a couple of partners in the divorce mediation business.  When the summer rolls around, the two romp through the Washington, D.C. wedding season crashing wedding ceremonies.  They follow a strict set of "full proof" rules in order to impress women that are overwhelmed by the emotions surrounding weddings into engaging in one night stands.<br /><br />Just when it looks like the wedding season has ended, the daughter of the Secretary of the Treasury, played by Christopher Walken, is set to be married.  Jeremy, Vaughn's character, impresses another of the Secretaries daughters, but has gotten more than he bargained for.  The wedding day fling quickly turns into an obsession, and Jeremy can't get away.  Meanwhile, John, Wilson's character, has fallen for yet another of the Secretary's daughters.  Problem is, despite hitting it off with her, she has an obnoxious boyfriend.  John can't let it go and finds himself prolonging the wedding day experience in an attempt to impress her.<br /><br />This movie is a lot of fun.  The "Uncorked" edition on the DVD is nice, but having watched the unrated and theatrical versions of the film, I think the theatrical version was just right.  The extra scenes added to the uncorked version weren't necessary and don't add much to the film.  Plus, the "Uncorked" version seems to run a bit long.  Fortunately, both versions are on the DVD.<br /><br />This movie is bested enjoyed if you take it with a grain of salt.  The portrayals of the characters are obvious caricatures of overzealous womanizers, unfaithful politicians, neurtoic and over sexed vixens, and overagressive ivy leaguers.  What makes the theatrical version so much fun is that it offers up outrageous scenes that hit just the right comedic level.<br /><br />I recommend this move to fans of Vaughn (who seems to be in everything these days) and Wilson.  There is a great cameo by a buddy of theirs in the later stages of the film, and those familiar with Wilson's films can probably narrow it down to one or two people.  This is also just a great comedy that should appeal to adults.  Its not recommended for children.<br /><br />Overall rating:  4.25 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A228JH8V9Y700G.html">A228JH8V9Y700G</a><br/><p>What a great racket these two have going on!  Two lifelong friends, John and Jeremy, are professional wedding crashers.  Here they score free food, free champagne, and all the hot chicks they can get their sticky fingers on at all the weddings in town.  It doesn't matter in some situations that they are the only Anglos (the Indian wedding is funny) and obviously sticking out like proverbial sore thumbs, or that they are scamming people around them.  You laugh and pat them on the back, thinking why you didn't think of this yourself or how simple it could be if you were so crafty.  Eventually, John (Owen Wilson) falls for the sister of the bride at one of the society weddings they crash, and Jeremy (Vince Vaughn) becomes the object of affection for another sister of the society bride whose insanity act and kinky antics leave you more fridgid than aroused.<br /><br />However, this movie fails to deliver.  I have a weakness for Owen Wilson, I admit it.  That broken nose just adds something to him that I find appealing.  Tee hee!  But, to see him using those lines on the gals at the weddings to bed them only to use them again when he at last falls for the perfect woman was disappointing.  Vince Vaughn is subjected to the majority of the physical comedy, and after a while it gets old.  Especially the closeted homosexual brother.  It just gets too obvious after a where the chain of events will go.  Once they are rejected they suddenly become the pursuers, proving the authors of The Rules might have been right all along.  Let him chase you, and then they will have more respect for you. (Although the Vince Vaughn / psycho sister situation is a little too twisted for words.)<br /><br />I was expecting a smutty, more slapstick humor (think the American Pie movies), but it turns into a chick flick on you before you know it.  Sappy ending, but Owen Wilson provided some nice eye candy.</p></br><a href="../users/A2H22I2RWE0HOV.html">A2H22I2RWE0HOV</a><br/><p>After watching Wedding Crashers you'll realize that if you're into slightly-off-kilter comedies involving sex and sarcasm then you'll have enjoyed yourself and laughed continuously.  If you're not into those kind of movies, steer clear.  Juvenille and drop-dead funny in spots, Wedding Crashers biggest flaw is that it plays right into the typical Hollywood formula of comedy.  Two best friends crash weddings to score with chicks.  They have flash and panache and usually a killer back-story.  They are chick magnets.  Feeling saucy they decide to crash the wedding of the daughter of the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury (Christopher Walken.  Ballsy.  Well...one of them (Owen Wilson)falls for the Secretary's sweet daughter Claire while the other (Vince Vaughn) hits it off with the stage-5 clinger/psycho/nymphomaniac other daughter. Push comes to shove and the two of them end up at the Secretary's shore estate for the weekend.  Owen Wilson has all the charm-jets fired up as Vaughn plays the fall guy.  Overall, one very funny movie.  You try to overlook the cliche storyline.  The great, pure, kind girl with the evil, sadistic boyfriend with the nice guy trying to intervene scenario.  (See Wedding Singer and about a million other movies...) Classic and tacky and filled with raucous hilarity.<br /><br />Dig it!</p></br><a href="../users/A2X6GEC6LCDN4S.html">A2X6GEC6LCDN4S</a><br/><p>This is a bit of formula picture, kind of predictable, but the characters are fairly funny and the movie supplies its intermittent laughs.  No real moral message, but "laughs."<br />The acting is above average.  It will be interesting what kind of roles these two lead actors get in the future...probably nothing of substance, stuck in the realm of Eddie Murphy type films.<br /><br />Teenagers will probably find this film hilarious.</p></br><a href="../users/A24ZFFRQ4MG3XL.html">A24ZFFRQ4MG3XL</a><br/><p>This was quite a good movie.  The biggest negative it had going for it, was what happens to all great movies - and that is TV commercials and movie commercials showing all the best and most funny parts ahead of time.  When you get to the cinema or see the dvd, nothing is funny anymore.  I didn't laugh much outside of all the good parts because they had been hashed on tv over and over.  That being said, I did laugh once or twice else and those parts were due to Will Farrell.  He's hillarious and has a cute cameo in this.  I thought overall that Vince Vaughn stole the movie.  He was terrific and so funny.  He had the worst luck throughout the movie, whether it be a hand job under the table with the girl he can't stand to be around, or the brother of said girl entering his bedroom and bed.  Owen Wilson was great too, also having his share of bad luck.  Imagine the mother of the girl you like, exposing herself to you.  He handled himself well under the pressure.  I did expect more from Christopher Walken; I thought he wasn't half as good as many of his other roles and didn't have any great lines or scenes.  That was a big disappointment.<br /><br />Overall, this movie is very good (maybe not quite worth all the hype that followed it), and the acting is great and has perfect timing. It has one of the most predictable endings, but put that aside and you have a funny movie to watch and a new dvd for your collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A1V3IO23FZFF9L.html">A1V3IO23FZFF9L</a><br/><p>Vaughn and Wilson make a great pair in this comedy.

The two of them are Wedding Crashers and they go to any wedding, be it a Jewish wedding and so forth and they go there to pick up women and sleep with them. The boys take a preticular wedding as they crash the wedding of big shot Christopher Walken (upcoming Domino, The Prophecy). There, Wilson meets Claire, played by Rachel McAdams (Red Eye, Mean Girls) and falls madly in love with her but the only thing is, is that she is engaged to pompous jackass played by Bradley Cooper (Tv's ALIAS) and on the other line, Vaughn gets involved with McAdams sister who is a real horn dog. Very funny...the Wedding Collage where Owen and Vince go to all those weddings I thought was funny....the two of them make a great comedy team...the comedy team of this era, just like Chevy Chase, Dan Aykroyd, Bill Murray and all those guys did back in the 80's...these guys are doing it now. Also starring Jane Seymour (Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman, Live and Let Die)....hm, when Seymour was seducing Wilson in that one scene where she forces him to touch her breasts I was like, Dr. Quinn was doing a Mrs. Robinson. Will Ferrell (Melinda and Melinda, Bewitched) appears because he's part of the clan, Wilson and Vaughn are in, in which they appear in a lot of the same movies<br /><br />(Zoolander, Royal Tenenbaums, Anchorman, Dodgeball, Old School)<br /><br />"Mom, Meatloaf!!" This is probably the funniest movie so far this year. Wilson and Vaughn score again.</p></br><a href="../users/A29R4FCO6RFX4K.html">A29R4FCO6RFX4K</a><br/><p>This movie is the latest from the group that has formed over the years of Stiller, Black, the Wilson Bros., Vaughn, and Ferrel. Some of the comedies that have sprung forth from this group have been excellent and the laughs provided have been well worth the ticket price (anchorman, old school), others .... well, not so much (envy, dodgeball). I am happy to report that this is one of the former. Sure, the plot is as predictable and clich&eacute;d as any Hollywood machine movie, but this comedy separates itself from those and from the other films from this troupe by being genuinely hilarious. The plot may be formulaic, but the jokes are not. Even in the greatest of the movies featuring these players the jokes have been expected and while funny, not enough to knock you on your ass (although funny enough to quote continuously for months following the initial viewing). This flick has that punch to its jokes and that is exactly what makes it so great. That is what separates it from other movie and that is to what it owes its success. The outline and the previews don't seem at all fresh, but the jokes are crisp. Plus any movie with Christopher Walken is good in my book.</p></br><a href="../users/A27CHILBK6HIL2.html">A27CHILBK6HIL2</a><br/><p>MOVIE: A slight breath of fresh air hits the theaters in the midst of this dull summer in the form of Wedding Crashers.  Basically the title says it all, we have to guys who go to weddings to pick up girls, but at one point Owen Wilson's character has enough and figures that this is childish.  He then falls for a woman who is the daughter of a famous U.S Senator played by Christopher Walken.  Now Owen Wilson is willing to go to the extremes to lie about who he is so that he can try and win over this girl.  He drags Vince Vaughn along for the ride who has been caught by the eye of the senator's other daughter.  The whole movie basically takes place at the senator's summer home by the Chesapeake Bay.  Here ensues some hilarious situations with the great comic talents of the leading actors.  By far the funniest scene in the movie is the dinner scene, which I won't describe because it needs to be seen fresh.  Another funny scene is where Vince Vaughn is tied up by the girl who has fallen for him, she then forces him into sex while he is tied up.  Later the sentor's homosexual son finds him in this vulnerable position and things go from there.  The movie is funny, but unfortunetly relies on physical comedy to keep it moving.  The characters are one dimensiona, and the plot is a cliche of every other romance movie.  The guy who wants the girl, but the girl is with another man, the man is an ass, in the end the guy gets the girl and the ass gets the boot.  It's a very formulaic movie, but it's funny.  Not the funniest movie I have ever seen, but it's funny.<br /><br />ACTING: The acting we get is all physical.  Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn are hilarious in the movie, but the characters they play are not developed well enough in the script for us to care what happens to them.  The audience is just along for the ride.  Christopher Walken plays another funny role, not as funny as other stuff he has done but still funny.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: The movie is a great summer comedy with all the right ingredients for a croud pleaser.  At this point it doesn't matter what anybody says about it, because New Line Cinema is up to their ears in money from this one.  It's a road map plot with one dimensional characters, but it is very funny and has a hilarious cameo at the end.</p></br><a href="../users/A1O60Q7LBN4MQ.html">A1O60Q7LBN4MQ</a><br/><p>I liked it. Not as much as I expected because of all the hoopla over how great it was. Even the librarian who checked me out fussed over it "This movie is so funny!". I think my sense of humor has changed as I get older. I think when I was under 30, I would have loved this flick.<br /><br />Grandma was a hoot. And the best scene is when Vince Vaughn gets tied up in bed and gets three separate visitors. Don't want to say too much and ruin it for anyone who hasn't seen it. Which it seems everyone who plans on has. I think it could have been shorter because I was getting antsy during the last 20 minutes or so.</p></br><a href="../users/A2N69DJM8NVYZ6.html">A2N69DJM8NVYZ6</a><br/><p>The movie is pretty funny,though has some unnecessary nudity and offensive language/jokes. The last part where Owen Olsen is desperate is unnecessary and boring. Though it wouldn't happen in a real life, most likely, it's still funny to watch. Though it should have a warning "Don't try that at home."</p></br><a href="../users/AJMU8VVFKMZI4.html">AJMU8VVFKMZI4</a><br/><p>First of all, I think the idea of picking up women at weddings and funerals quite clever.  Anyone whoever been to a wedding knows all the single women are in full fairy tale mode and are ripe for the picking.  It's probably the only place a janitor could get some serious play.  So the first part of the film I found very funny.  But then the rest of the story with Owen's character falling in love and the girl's jerk of a fiance all too cliche and predictable.  I was actually bored--except when the brother nearly rapes Vaughn's character.  That's an accomplishement to make a near rape funny...but the rest ho hum.  Is it over yet?</p></br><a href="../users/A7Y6AVS576M03.html">A7Y6AVS576M03</a><br/><p>This movie had me laughing till my stomach was aching and I still couldn't stop. I thought this was just going to be one of your ordinary production line comedies they turn out these days from Hollywood. The situations that Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn get into are pretty outrageous. Ultimately the film takes a curious twist toward the bizarre. As the film establishes these two guys, they crash weddings with their incredibly witty and irresistible charm and have women literally falling into to bead with them. The film begins to enter the realm of the surreal once our two protagonists end up with Christopher Walken and his family and entourage who are just very strange people and that is where the film goes wild. You never know what is going to happen next and that's what makes this film so hilarious and also very witty. I found this movie very amusing and downright funny. I haven't laughed like this in years. To give too much of the plot away would ruin this film's impact. I think the general public has overlooked this film to an extent. The trailer for this film was totally misleading. I went in to see this movie reluctantly but came out laughing all the way home.<br /><br />This video is outstanding. The numerous scenes of these two womanizers with women in various stages of nudity are incredibly erotic. However, this just sets you up for more unexpected and flat out outrageous scenes. The film gets your natural instincts up to fever pitch and then the floor drops out from under you. The entire cast is perfect and you still never really know what's around the bend in this well scripted romp. Particularly, Vince Vaughn shows an incredible depth of talent I never knew he had. He just about steals this film away in a very subtle way that you just have to see. If you like outrageous humor and want unexpected laughs I highly recommend this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ.html">A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ</a><br/><p>I have to say that this movie surprised in two ways. I was surprised with what the movie was like, and just as surprised that it wasn't what I thought it would be. What do I mean?. I was expecting the movie to be pretty raunchy and over the top along the lines of more recent comedy fare. It wasn't. Don't get me wrong, it does get a little nutty with some R rated material, but it wasn't like it is in other raunchier comedies. I was also surprised that it was a nicer film with more heart than I was expecting. It's still an R rated film all the way though. It took me a while to laugh because the movie doesn't really get funny until 45 minutes into the film. Once they crash the big wedding and hook up with the girls and their family, then it starts becoming funny. Just wait. It'll come. I was also never a real fan of either Owen Wilson or Vince Vaughn, but I liked them a great deal here and will keep an open mind about them from now on. The two star as a couple of friends who, come wedding season, crash the festivities to have a good time, eat good food, drink good wine, and possibly bed some women. They get into more than they can handle when they attend the wedding of the daughter of the Secretary of Treasury(Christopher Walken). John(Owen) meets Claire(Rachel McAdams), the middle daughter, and Jeremy(Vince) meets Gloria, the youngest daughter, who's a few sandwiches short of a picnic. In what becomes very predictable, John actually falls for Claire, who is with a rich creep(also very predictable), and Jeremy tries to flee from the crazy Gloria. The movie is basically very routine. You know what will happen the second it starts, and you know how it will all play out in the end. The movie offers no real surprises, but it makes up for it in plenty to laugh at, fun performances, and a slick direction. Christopher Walken is a god, but he has nothing to really do here. He just seems to be there to be the "dad" looming over the happenings and keep everyone together. Plus, it seems kinda strange to me to see Walken being the "dad". Jane Seymour has a fun little role that plays against what we usually get from her. She also looks fantastic!. McAdams is as sweet as apple pie and looks even better. I can see why she is supposed to be the next big thing. You can't stop looking at her. Bradley Cooper from "Alias" is only there as a cliched and predictable plot tool. Our two stars?. Both carry the film very well. They work and play off of each other nicely. Vaughn has a knack for this kind of comedy and character, but Wilson doesn't match him quite as well. The big cameo towards the end is fun, and it would be a hoot to see a film about that character!. Dwight Yoakam and Rebecca DeMornay also appear in quick cameos at the very beginning. The ending can be seen a mile away, but it doesn't lessen how nice it is. Wedding Crashers is not perfect, nor is it as side splitting funny as other films, but it is fun, funny, and very enjoyable. Not bad at all.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VCPMT1RRS7K0.html">A1VCPMT1RRS7K0</a><br/><p>Somehow, I allowed myself to miss this movie when it was in theaters.  I finally got to see the "Uncorked Edition" on DVD - I got what I figured I had missed out on... this movie is hilarious.<br /><br />Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson are great together and they play off of one another classically.  From the opening scene, to the wedding crashing montage, to the ultimate wedding crashing experience at the home of the Treasury Secretary (Christopher Walken), these two keep the laughs going.  Vince Vaughn paces the scenes with his rapid-fire fast-wittedness - and Owen Wilson is right there with him.<br /><br />I thought Christopher Walken would have had a funnier part to play and more to contribute.  He is certainly capable of delivering, had he been called on to do so, yet he was good in the role and did what he could with what he was granted.<br /><br />Rachel McAdams and Isla Fisher play the two interests of our main characters.  Fisher plays a sex-crazed stalker-type and McAdams plays the sweet, reserved one.  They both play solid supporting roles, but I feel the best supporting role was perhaps one of the smallest: Will Ferrell, in his guest spot, steals the show toward the end of the movie...<br /><br />Bonus featured include a very funny commentary by Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson, deleted scenes, a few good featurettes, a music video and trailers.  You most certainly get your moneys' worth with this DVD.<br /><br />Highly recommended!</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>That was actually my first reaction to the film: it's not a raunchy comedy? The film is actually a situation comedy with swears and sex-related humor rather than just flatout grossness like American Pie. It ends up working because of the chemistry of the characters and some humor.<br /><br />John and Jeremy are wedding crashers, people who sneak into weddings pretending to be part of the group and impressing everyone and going home with a woman. Fake names and occupations are thrown out so they can have the best possible time. John however is starting to feel a little bit empty about it.<br /><br />Cue in the Treasury leader hosting a wedding for his daughter. Biggest wedding ever so why not crash that one too? Only this family is quite an odd one and they both find that out as Jeremy has a really oversexed girl Gloria while John meets Claire, the normal one but is with someone else(who, in a stereotypical role) is the "jealous and bitter" boyfriend.<br /><br />I think that's one problem I had with it: it's got too many comedy conventions. If you've seen a romantic comedy ever you know that guy does something to screw up and girl doesn't like him while guy tries to get her back and girl accepts. Come on people, I'm not spoiling anything. Also it's slightly underwritten. Jane Seymour playing the unfaithful wife of the Treasury head doesn't really do anything and pretty much just drops out.<br /><br />The film does work for the chemistry, not only in the 2 leading men but with their respective women. A standout is Isla Fisher playing the incredibly enthusiastic Gloria. While of course Christopher Walken is awesome, you just feel you could've needed more Walken(I refuse to do a cowbell-like joke involving more Walken).<br /><br />I found this funnier than 40 Year Old Virgin actually but still, could've used slightly more script work. Ever so slightly.</p></br><a href="../users/A9Q28YTLYREO7.html">A9Q28YTLYREO7</a><br/><p>this film reminded me of a few films that were tied together&none of the best elements of those films. this film has some moments,but nothing that merits 2 hours&alot of tired cliches. it was very predictable for the most part&it took a good hour before things even kinda even got going.this is a film that will probably have a part 2 or 3 but not because it was so good,but it worked.it was just a Ok film to me.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R36DZQEWNVJ1.html">A3R36DZQEWNVJ1</a><br/><p>Vince Vaughn (Mr. and Mrs. Smith, Be Cool) plays Jeremy and Owen Wilson (Starsky & Hutch, Life Aquatic) plays John. The two of them are Wedding Crashers and they go to any wedding, be it a Jewish wedding and so forth and they go there to pick up women and sleep with them. The boys take a preticular wedding as they crash the wedding of big shot Christopher Walken (upcoming Domino, The Prophecy). There, Wilson meets Claire, played by Rachel McAdams (Red Eye, Mean Girls) and falls madly in love with her but the only thing is, is that she is engaged to pompous jackass played by Bradley Cooper (Tv's ALIAS) and on the other line, Vaughn gets involved with McAdams sister who is a real horn dog. Very funny...the Wedding Collage where Owen and Vince go to all those weddings I thought was funny....the two of them make a great comedy team...the comedy team of this era, just like Chevy Chase, Dan Aykroyd, Bill Murray and all those guys did back in the 80's...these guys are doing it now. Also starring Jane Seymour (Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman, Live and Let Die)....hm, when Seymour was seducing Wilson in that one scene where she forces him to touch her breasts I was like, Dr. Quinn was doing a Mrs. Robinson. Will Ferrell (Melinda and Melinda, Bewitched) appears because he's part of the clan, Wilson and Vaughn are in, in which they appear in a lot of the same movies<br /><br /> (Zoolander, Royal Tenenbaums, Anchorman, Dodgeball, Old School)<br /><br />"Mom, Meatloaf!!" This is probably the funniest movie so far this year. Wilson and Vaughn score again.</p></br><a href="../users/AEVNUEDRGTC4P.html">AEVNUEDRGTC4P</a><br/><p>The Wedding Crashers is a case of a good movie that inspired a rude fad. The movie itself is very funny and is a good comedy. However, it inspired all sorts of copycat behavior. As a result, many weddings came to need such expensive accoutrements such as extra security and sending tickets for admission in the wedding invitations.<br /><br />The Wedding Crashers comes well recommended provided that you don't try any wedding crashing yourself.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R602SXNGOMJ4.html">A1R602SXNGOMJ4</a><br/><p>This movie started out well. Then it got long...too long. Plus it tried to go from funny guy movie to sappy chick flick. It didn't work. Owen Wilson's performance was disappointing. He was still much the same guy he is in his other movies, but this time he was also depressed and whinny for part of the movie. Also, there is no way to write a spoiler for this movie. It was totally predictable. If you read any of the summaries about this movie you can guess what's going to happen. There are no big surprises which isn't that surprising when you consider the type of film this is.<br /><br />My advice to the cast. Rachel, now that you've done something fun, go back to a part that endures as in THE NOTEBOOK. Vince, I think you've been typecast since SWINGERS. Some of your rapid funny lines were funny, like talking dirty to your girlfriend on the phone, but it's starting to get old. Find a dramatic role next time.<br /><br />If this movie manages to make any money, heaven help us, as that means there will be more of these morose cinematic insults to the public's intelligence to follow.</p></br><a href="../users/A33CLVW2K7SL1P.html">A33CLVW2K7SL1P</a><br/><p>On the plus side, this is the first time I've found Owen Wilson compelling. Though not given much to work with in terms of actual comedy, his comic timing was spot-on. Vince Vaughn did everything he needed to do as well.<br /><br />However, the film had a flimsy premise, and was essentially one big cliche after another.<br /><br />2.5, rounded up to 3.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PBV1899CX3TE.html">A2PBV1899CX3TE</a><br/><p>Wedding Crashers is an instant comedy classic. It is surprising that director David Dobkin hasn't done more. There was Clay Pigeons, with Vince Vaughn, but as a psycho, not a comedy. He worked with Owen Wilson on Shanghai Knights, but his resume is otherwise thin. Why hasn't Dobkin made more comedies? It is really remarkable. The chemistry between Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson is like it was between Vaughn and Jon Favreau in Swingers, because first and foremost, this is a buddy picture.<br /><br />---------------<br />Jeremy Grey: John?

The answer would be, um, Wedding Season?<br />[shimmy-shakes]<br />John Beckwith: Bingo! I'm gonna get my suit. Now who are we this time?<br />=====================================================<br /><br />But it is also a great romantic comedy, and Isla Fisher and Rachel McAdams are gorgeous and fantastic--also great chemistry with Vince and Owen, respectively. Finally, it is a coming of age story where a lesson is learned about the value of commitment, but marriage doesn't have to mean the end of fun.<br /><br />-----------------------<br />Jeremy Grey: Gloria, I've been doing a lot of soul searching recently, and I think I'm ready to take this relationship, our relationship to the next level.<br />Gloria Cleary: Jeremy, I am so ready to take it to the next level.<br />Jeremy Grey: Really?<br />Gloria Cleary: Yeah.

It doesn't always work, but director David Dobkin and co-screenwriters Steve Faber and Bob Fisher get a lot of mileage out of the idea of two horndog divorce lawyers who crash weddings in their native D.C. area to lure sexually available women. Originating from a Big Kahuna of wedding crashing (who shows up late in the movie to offer an updated approach), the strategy of the partners in crime, John Beckwith and Jeremy Grey, is to abide by their incessant rulebook and show up at events like they were invited and be prepared to present themselves with creatively concocted bios as tangible connections to either the bride or the groom.<br /><br />It all sounds like a prime opportunity for tasteless, vulgar humor and at various points, it is, but the film can also be surprisingly clever and even insightful. The set-up is actually more interesting than the ensuing plot, which relies much more on convention as it focuses on the high-profile nuptials of a US senator's daughter and the predictable romantic complications therein. As the smoother of the two, Owen Wilson plays John with his trademark glibness and laidback manner. In romancing the senator's middle daughter Claire, he even manages to eke out sincerity in measured doses, although he lacks the gravitas to be a truly effective romantic lead. As Jeremy, whether egging John about his exposure to the available breasts of the senator's wife, fending off the advances of Claire's sister and brother, or confessing profusely to a somewhat titillated minister, Vince Vaughn is a motor-mouthed riot, as he suffers an escalating number of indignities in order to keep up the guises while John woos Claire. Together, they are like a post-frat house version of Crosby and Hope in one of their Road movies.<br /><br />Christopher Walken plays the strait-laced senator with just a hint of his potential lunacy, though I was wishing he could break free more like he does in his "Saturday Night Live" skits. In a role that begs for the effortless savvy of Joan Allen or Jean Smart, the still-beautiful Jane Seymour just seems sadly misused as his wife. The current "it" girl, Rachel McAdams has the presence of mind and spirit to make more of the lackluster role of romantically confused Claire than there really is, though it's Isla Fisher who steals her scenes with abandon as Claire's alternately smitten and psychotic baby sister Gloria. Truth be told, the film starts to drag in the home stretch as it takes its time toward the inevitable conclusion, but the cleverly tasteless take on funerals is a nice jab. Regardless, Wilson and especially Vaughn, with his non-stop stream-of-consciousness wit, generate enough goodwill and laughs to compensate for the occasional lapses along the way.<br /><br />The "Uncorked" DVD package is somewhat disappointing. It contains two versions of the film, the original theatrical one and another billed as "uncorked", though the difference amounts to a few additional moments and lines here and there. There are two commentary tracks - an informative albeit by-the-numbers one by Dobkin and a looser though rather lazy and low-key one by Wilson and Vaughn. Neither is essential. There are four deleted scenes, including a karaoke scene with the two guys endlessly singing Nena's "99 Luftballoons". The extras just prove that the final film was edited correctly when it was released.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MNMZMM6BGLTA.html">A2MNMZMM6BGLTA</a><br/><p>This movie is just plain funny as hell!

I almost couldn't help it though -- Jim Carrey and his facial expressions and voice inflections are too much. My uproarious laughter during this movie stems from the hilarious and witty dialogue spoken by two comic greats -- Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn. Talk about an amazing team! Truth be told, I'm not a big fan of movies like Anchorman or Old School or Dodegball, so I went into the theater expecting something similar. I would say that fans of the previously mentioned movies won't be disappointed with Wedding Crashers and neither should anyone else. It's a fantastic comedy.<br /><br />Wilson and Vaughn star as John and Jeremy, two guys who can't wait till wedding season. They love the food, they love making up stories and background information about the "characters" they're going to be, and oh yeah, the women. The main reason for crashing weddings is to bed as many bridesmaids as possible. And they're good. After watching a montage of weddings that these guys crash, Jeremy decides they should end the season with one last hoorah. John reluctantly agrees; he was looking forward to putting wedding season behind him. Then it happens -- John falls in love with a pretty bridesmaid (Rachel McAdams, Mean Girls; The Notebook). Suddenly he's breaking the rules of wedding crashing -- never stay too long, don't get involved, etc. Unfortunately for Jeremy, he slept with a crazy, clingy redhead who confessed that she loved him after only two hours of knowing him. She sticks to him like glue the entire time, and the look on his face everytime she kisses him is hilarious. The girl's family is kooky -- cursing grandmother, wacky brother, politician father, and of course, the girl has a jerky boyfriend. What's a wedding crasher to do?<br /><br />How many times can I describe this movie as hilarious? Well, however long it takes to get you to the theater to see it. You won't regret it, you'll be laughing so hard that your side will actually hurt. This movie isn't without physical comedy, but the best stuff is in the dialogue, which is better than most dramas (remind me why dramas are so popular... oh yeah, the "riveting dialogue," something said way too often by film critics).

Ostensibly about two crude dudes who cruise wedding receptions looking for easy girls and cheap laughs, the movie is really a manifesto on the guilty lusts and yearnings of the middle-class man. There is a cruelty and cynicism running under the action of this and "Old School," most Adam Sandler flicks, and the "American Pie" trilogy.<br /><br />And while some films - "About A Boy," "The Royal Tenenbaums" and "Punch-Drunk Love" - actually examine the paradigms that create puerile adults, "Wedding Crashers," far more sentimental than its premise would suggest, assumes the emotional infancy of its two main characters and couches their awakening in a fantasy worthy of a John Hughes production. It<br /><br />is not so much funny as it is manipulative.<br /><br />John (Owen Wilson) and Jeremy (Vince Vaughn) are divorce mediators - at least in the opening scene - who spend their Washington D.C. summers scouting the fanciest nuptials, blending into the party, and picking off tipsy romantics. They have a rulebook, occasionally quoted, with equality - both guys must score, or neither does - as its highest virtue. "Wedding Crashers" is funniest in its opening scenes, before the boys meet the family of U.S. Treasury Secretary Cleary (Christopher Walken) and his daughters Gloria (Isla Fisher) and Claire (Rachel McAdams).<br /><br />The movie spends its next hour at the Cleary summer house, as the smitten John tries to coax Claire away from boyfriend Sack (Bradley Cooper) while Jeremy has conflicting desires about the predatory, clingy Gloria. The rest of the Cleary clan are one-note jokes expressed as performances - including a purposely bizarre son, potty-mouthed grandma, and boozy matriarch (Jane Seymour) - but the linchpin to the movie's tone is amoral, abusive Sack. Dressed like a Soc from "The Outsiders" and played by Cooper with deranged glee, Sack is a black-hatted villain of violent duplicity - convicted murderer Scott Peterson on steroids.<br /><br />Reminiscent of Craig Kilborn's repugnant turn in "Old School," Sack's existence suggests a social commentary on the part of writers Steve Faber and Bob Fisher and director David Dobkin meant to dismiss John and Jeremy's reckless behavior - they're sleazebags with a heart of gold, ya know - via this display of ugly masculinity, while tacking up a thesis against those impossibly gorgeous, witty rich girls who cave to societal pressure to marry goons of the upper crust. The examination of such fragile creatures has been a preeminent American theme since "The Great Gatsby;" the gulf between Fitzgerald's aim of demystifying a social class,  and "Wedding Crashers," which means to forgive undisciplined lust in light of Sack's brutality is massive. Ditto the goal of "Old School" to forgive alcoholism and immaturity if it means becoming a fatuous, slick pig.<br /><br />None of the subtext makes it any funnier. Vaughn is relegated to sidekick in the narrative, but the movie's humor belongs almost solely to his verbal riffs, which benefit from Vaughn's size and image of a raconteur gone to seed and red-rimmed world weariness. There is a Oscar performance inside Vaughn should the right dramatic role present itself; like Ray Liotta, he was born with equal parts manic showman and twisted intellectual. But Wilson tends to avoid his niche like the plague and play whatever pays the bills, thus he is again a cool-guy leading man without any lines, looks or natural charm to recommend him. He generates nothing with McAdams, whose bright smirk creates enough chemistry for both of them.<br /><br />As for the rest of the principals: Fisher gets her 15 minutes. Cooper pages Eric Roberts in the psych ward. Walken is stiff and sincere. Translated: He was paid to show up to be in the trailer. And Will Ferrell, in what needs to be the last cameo of his career, is asked to rescue the last half of the movie in a short stint as an aging wedding crasher named Chazz. A dead-armed aging quarterback, Farrell presses embarrassingly - he resorts to yelling as comedy - and gesticulates mindlessly.<br /><br />Kneading a myth with middlebrow gutter humor as it does, "Wedding Crashers" was a remarkable success in the moment, but like Sandler's many lesser works, it is destined to become a fallback favorite of young Americans who laugh so as not to sit stunned by the silence of their smudgy morality as they root on brown shirt lounge lizards.</p></br><a href="../users/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD.html">A3PPXVR5J6U2JD</a><br/><p>When I first saw the advertisement for Wedding Crashers, I thought it was a typical frat boy romp, involving two older men who should know better going after all the tasty young things that are grieving over their bleak futures at weddings.  It's the perfect plan.<br /><br />But the movie advertised in the trailers is very different from the actual film. Wedding Crashers is actually a sappy love story, complete with theories about true love and the harsh reality that two guys who cruise weddings for chicks are a little pathetic. Depending on your perspective, this is actually a good thing (the movie brings something different to a tired genre) or a bad thing (it is not all about drunk girls getting naked).<br /><br />Jeremy Grey (Vince Vaughn) and John Beckwith (Owen Wilson) are best friends forever.  So much so that the night of John's parents' death, Jeremy sleeps over to keep him company.  Aren't they sweet?  They are also high-powered lawyers, arbitrating nasty divorces.  They'd be quite the catch...if it weren't for the fact that these two guys crash weddings. Their jobs help convey why they're so cynical about weddings and also how they can charm their way through just about anything. That all changes when they meet the Clearys.<br /><br />The Clearys are a high-powered political family.  Heading the brood of faux-Kennedys is the patriarch (Christopher Walken), his boozing, horny wife Kathleen (Jane Seymour), his gay son Todd (Keir O'Donnell), grandma (Ellen Albertini, who was also in the Wedding Singer and still going strong!), and his three daughters: dutiful Christina (Jennifer Alden), smart and sassy Claire (the delightful Rachel McAdams), and raunchy Gloria (Isla Fisher, in full-blown nut-job mode).  John meets Claire at Christina's wedding and immediately falls in love.  There's just one problem...she's engaged. Of course.<br /><br />And the guy she's engaged to is Zach "The Sack" Lodge (Bradley Cooper), a hyper-masculine jock who likes to beat people up.  Zach is a complete cad and it's up to John, with a little help from Jeremy, to beat the bad guy, get the girl, and live happily ever after.  Somewhere in the middle of all this, Jeremy hooks up with the crazy Gloria and decides she's perfect for him, an ironic twist for the sidekick.<br /><br />Wedding Crashers is wildly uneven, but most of the time you don't mind.  Vaughn can be too kinetic, Wilson can be too sedate, and Fisher is so overbearing that she starts to annoy the audience.  McAdams, however, lights up the screen with her shy smile.  Her magnetic personality even excuses Wilson's incessant mooning over her.  And of course, Walken is hilarious whenever he's on screen.<br /><br />That said, the movie is way too long.  As a sappy romance that starts out as a frat boy comedy, it swings wildly from one genre to the next.  Things take a turn for the worse when Chazz Reinhold (Will Ferrell) shows up, but maybe that's on purpose.  Chazz's appearance heralds John's awakening that crashing weddings is really lame, and by that time I felt the same way.  Fortunately, the movie wraps up shortly after the Anchorman's arrival.<br /><br />Wedding Crashers is one of those sneaky movies that is much more clever in concept than it is in practice.  Fooling men (who only see the trailers and figure it's a comedy) and women (who talk to each other about the movie and thus know what it's actually about) into seeing the same film is a stroke of pure genius.  This is probably why Wedding Crashers did so well: it's a chick flick disguised as a guy's movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IUI3CJUMB7J0.html">A1IUI3CJUMB7J0</a><br/><p>I enjoyed this film but I did not find it the best comadey of the year like most people are saying. Yeas this movie is good and hallariouse at times but it's the acting that makes this movie good. Vince Vaughn is great and steels all the scens's I felt really bad for him in this movie, Owen Wilson is funny, Rachel McAddems is great and is a rising star, it's the crazy girlfriend that steals all the scene's. The bad thing is the last half hour when Will Ferell makes a cameo, the last half hour is slow and stupid till the last part of the movie when everything comes together. Overall plenty of laugh out loud moments makes this a great movie that you can watch again and again.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJPMB7N776WS.html">A1TJPMB7N776WS</a><br/><p>"Wedding Crashers" is a riot and should be seen for the following reasons:<br />1. Nothing is sacred. The following subjects are commented upon by the various movie characters in as negative a way as is possible: Marriage, FDR, Eleanor Roosevelt, Catholicism, Women, Men, Gays, Macho Men, Girly-Men, The US Senate, Infidelity, Bagging Chicks, Virginity, Older Men/Younger Women Relationships, Older Women/Younger Men Relationships, Sybil...<br />2. A Family Dinner that is right up there with Woody Allen's Family Dinner scene in "Annie Hall" to the point that both movies share an actor: Christopher Walken...here playing the relatively sane, US Finance Secretary Cleary. Cleary's Mother (Isla Fisher) spouts off about FDR, calls Eleanor Roosevelt a raging woman lover, condemns her own grandson as a homosexual...and on and on.... hilarious.<br />3. Rachel McAdams as Claire Cleary: adorable, funny...she lights up the screen.<br />4. Vince Vaughn as Jeremy Grey: this guy just keeps getting funnier and funnier. If you thought he was "out there" in "Be Cool" you haven't seen anything yet.<br />With all that said the movie has a heart of Gold. David Dobkin has kept a tight rein on all of this silliness so that none of it goes out of control. I was surprised at how much I like this film. Go...check it out.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TEMNM9ZEOLJ6.html">A1TEMNM9ZEOLJ6</a><br/><p>Most seemed to think this was "hilarious." I'm mystified. I never laughed once. What's wrong with me? I mean, this isn't even the slightest bit funny. To me. Probably not to Owen Wilson either, since he attempted suicide after filming it. The extra of the first preview audience howling at the football scene is beyond my comprehension. Must have been group think, or mindwashing. It's also at least 15-20 mins too long.

This movie had me laughing till my stomach was aching and I still couldn't stop. I thought this was just going to be one of your ordinary production line comedies they turn out these days from Hollywood. The situations that Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn get into are pretty outrageous. As the film establishes these two guys, they crash weddings with their incredible wit and irresistible charm and have women literally falling into to bed with them (in a very sensual montage). Ultimately the film takes a curious twist toward the bizarre and your attention starts to rise. The film truly begins to enter the realm of the surreal once our two protagonists end up with Christopher Walken and his family and entourage who are just very strange people and that is where the film goes wild. You never know what is going to happen next and that's what makes this film so hilarious. To give too much of the plot away would ruin this film's impact. I found this film very amusing to say the least and downright funny. I haven't laughed like this in years. I think the general public grossly overlooked this film. The trailer for this film was ridiculously misleading. I went in to see this movie reluctantly but came out laughing all the way home. This DVD is outstanding. The numerous scenes of these two womanizers with women in various stages of nudity are incredibly erotic. However, this just sets you up for more unexpected and flat out outrageous scenes. The film gets your natural instincts up to fever pitch and then the floor drops out from under you. The entire cast is perfect and you still never really know what's around the bend in this well scripted romp. Particularly, Vince Vaughn shows an incredible depth of talent I never knew he had. He just about steals this film away in a very subtle yet flamboyant way that you just have to see. To its credit this film does finally address true and meaningful love and there is a moral and definite message about what humanity and our existence is truly all about. If you like outrageous humor and want unexpected laughs I highly recommend this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DAOL3NMHEPLS.html">A1DAOL3NMHEPLS</a><br/><p>"Wedding Crashers" is a reasonably funny movie, but not really hilarious. It feels like an extended-length, R-rated episode of a TV sitcom, with a few bare breasts and some raunchy language added. I only laughed three or four times.

Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn play John and Jeremy, best friends who crash weddings for fun in an attempt to get vulnerable girls into bed with them. All goes well until they attend the wedding of the daughter of the Treasury Secretary (Christopher Walken). Jeremy unknowingly deflowers the Secretary's virginal/sex maniac daughter (Isla Fisher), while poor John falls in love with the Secretary's other daughter (Rachel McAdams), who unfortunately has an asinine boyfriend (Bradley Cooper). The film does lose a bit of momentum halfway through, but it still contains plenty of laughs. It was a little strange watching Wilson play the straight man for once, but he did an excellent job in his role. Vaughn is the real star of the show, though: His one-liners are hilarious, and the Jeremy/Gloria scenes made me laugh so hard that I cried. "Wedding Crashers" is a very funny film that is definitely worth watching.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PNTEDGMOLMOY.html">A2PNTEDGMOLMOY</a><br/><p>David Dobkin's "Wedding Crashers" will go down in cinematic history, if at all, as one of the great near-misses of our time.  All the elements were there, from a great comic premise to a stellar cast (even down to its supporting roles) and the guts to go for an 'R' rating in a PG-13 age (PG-13 being more box-office friendly).  But at the end, despite a couple of good laughs and inspired scenes, "Wedding Crashers" is a good comedy that could have been great.<br /><br />The plot is simple.  John Beckwith (Owen Wilson) and Jeremy Grey (Vince Vaughn) crash weddings to meet horny girls.  This premise leads to a great (if very long) opening montage as the daring duo crashes wedding after wedding, invariably ending up as the life of the party and in bed with beauties.  Their cover stories of how they are tangentially connected to the family are clever, and there are several references to "the Rules."<br /><br />But as the wedding season winds down, there is "One Last Score."  The eldest daughter of the Cleary family (the Maryland version of the Kennedys) is getting hitched in the biggest wedding of the year.  John and Jeremy crash, and John violates the biggest crasher rule of them all - he falls in love with the delectable Claire Cleary (Rachel McAdams, of "Red Eye" fame).<br /><br />John and Jeremy are invited back to the Cleary estate, where Dad (Christopher Walken) and Mom (Jane Seymour) hold court over the typical upper crust version of the Family from Hell.  While John must try to win the heart of Claire away from the dastardly WASP-on-Steroids, her fiance Sack, Jeremy must deal with the clinging, hyper-in-love younger Cleary daughter Gloria (Isla Fisher, who would steal the movie if given the chance).<br /><br />This astounding premise is mildly funny, but not up to expectations.  Walken, one of my absolute favorite actors and a comic genius, is given surprisingly little to do.  It's a waste of Christopher Walken if you see him in a comedy and he doesn't inspire any laugh-out-loud moments.  But there are no Walken Moments to be found in this film.  Similarly, Jane Seymour could have been hilarious as the oversexed Mrs. Robinson character, but she virtually disappears from the film after a big scene.  And Claire is given surprisingly little to do other than to play the object of desire.<br /><br />The movie devolves into a long, "will John get the girl" story that is completely drawn out, and the flick's few moments of Third Act comic inspiration just don't quite make it.<br /><br />This is not to say that you won't enjoy "Wedding Crashers."  However, we must regret the fact that "Wedding Crashers" won't become one of those hallowed all-time comedies, and it could have been.</p></br><a href="../users/A3N5XIM9R2OQH0.html">A3N5XIM9R2OQH0</a><br/><p>Going into Wedding Crashers, I wasn't expecting a masterpiece, but nor was I expecting the abomination that ended up unfolding on the big screen.  I figured I'd at least get a nice, lowbrow, politically incorrect goofball comedy with a few good laughs in the mold of Old School and Anchorman, but instead Wedding Crashers turned out to be the kind of cynical, implausible, and overlong dead whale of a movie that's causing ever-greater dissatisfaction with Hollywood.  Padded out to a laughable running time of 119 minutes, this movie can't even be saved by the deliriously cute Rachel McAdams, which is saying something.  Obviously Wedding Crashers was designed to be a classic buddy comedy, but it only deserves that label if you think Black Sheep does as well.<br /><br />The movie starts out promisingly enough, as we see a pair of thirty-something divorce mediators (I think it says something that I don't even remember their names at this point) devoting their midyear weekends to going uninvited to weddings of various religions and ethnicities to pick up chicks, culminating in a few good lines and some nice gratuitious nudity.  It's all downhill from there, though, as a clever concept is ruined by humor that would cease to exist if it were any broader or more watered down.  There are a few good ideas to be found in the first half of the movie, notably with some of the ancillary characters: the crazed clingy girl, the evil alpha-male boyfriend, and the social-misfit brother all manage to provoke a few guffaws.  Ultimately, though, Wedding Crashers turns out to be some decent ideas in search of a movie.  Great comedies-Rushmore, Election, The Big Lebwoski, Swingers-have memorable main characters, interesting plots, and intelligent dialogue.  Weighed down by sitcom-level writing and a mailed-in lead performance by the talented Owen Wilson (Vince Vaughn isn't much better), Wedding Crashers boasts none of these things.<br /><br />Even worse, about halfway through, after a cryptic conversation between Vaughn and the underused Christopher Walken and an agonizing beach pattycake scene, the movie sells out and ventures into sappy relationship territory, turning into the most ghastly of all creations: a romantic comedy without the comedy.  Even the inevitable Will Ferrell cameo near the end isn't enough to redeem Wedding Crashers from the horrors witnessed in its final hour.  This movie was clearly trying to be all things to all people, making it sort of the cinematic equivalent of a John Mayer album: soulless, corporate, and irritatingly ingratiating.  Had the makers of the film decided to go lowbrow and stay there they might have had something, but in the end all we're left with is yet another piece of big-studio tripe to rival anything Julia Roberts has starred in.</p></br><a href="../users/A1W702WG1LC6R3.html">A1W702WG1LC6R3</a><br/><p>Owen Wilson, Vince Vaughn, Rachel McAdams and Christopher Walken<br />star in this 2005 comedy.

Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn play a pair of wedding crashers who have been in the game for a while now.  However, while Vaughn continues to have a blast, Wilson is growing tired; all of which comes to a head when they crash the wedding of one of the daughters of a Treasury Secretary (Christopher Walken), where Vaughn gets in over his head with one love crazed daughter (Isla Fisher) and Wilson falls in love with another (Rachel McAdams).  In between all this there's some enjoyable raunchy humor, but it's Wilson and Vaughn who make Wedding Crashers a winner.  Both stars, particularly Vaughn in another scene stealing role, are comedically brilliant and a joy to watch.  Though it does wear thin towards it's predictable denouement, Wedding Crashers is a comedic delight, and for those craving an R-rated comedy that isn't full of predictable gross-out gags, this is for you.</p></br><a href="../users/A26A64X86VL1R4.html">A26A64X86VL1R4</a><br/><p>I liked this film.

Bye!<br /><br />The others will go to the door, pause, and wonder "mature stuff?" Come back on in, folks. We've got a juvenile comedy about getting your ya-yas off and then growing up.<br /><br />Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson (and the luminous Rachel McAdams and the kind of fascinating Christopher Walken) absolutely sell this buddy movie, about buddies who have discovered, they think, the ultimate way to hook up with girls. But crashing weddings and nailing emotionally vulnerable women only works until the guys fall for some of the girls. And when that happens, the emotionally retarded is totally unprepared to deal with the consequences.<br /><br />Wonderfully and believably profane while still being sweet and even kind of smart, Wedding Singers is a great movie for every aging frat boy out there, and those that love us despite all that.<br /><br />Strongly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A18MBO1U4DPY20.html">A18MBO1U4DPY20</a><br/><p>Wedding Crashers is a comedy that is arguably the biggest hit of it's kind this year. I'm sure there are some better films available out there but this is the kind that gets all the media's attention. Comedy is a genre that lacks depth. Mixing Will Ferrel towards the end of the film was a clever move. Although his short appearance doesnt make you go bonkers with laughter, it was mildly amusing. Wedding Crashers has some great humor and Owne Wilson's stand out performance astonished me. For some reason, this is the best Comedy performance he has given.<br /><br />Do not even look for any "real" chemistry between Rachel McAdams(Goodness,she's beautiful) and Owen Wilson's character. The grandmother in the film plays a funny role in being honest. I thought they overdid the slot of the teenage gay artist. Vince Vaughn gives a role worth being acknowledged. It's his fast, unbrash, unabrasive yet loud side that made the crowd roar.<br /><br />Although there is nothing in this film that I disliked, Wedding Crashers is at best, one of the finer three star grade movies you will see. It is definitely funnier than Meet The Fockers which was rather sleep inducing. I wish directors could make more films that are more character oriented and a specific theme to it.<br /><br />2005 had many comedies,most of which fall flat on it's face.

If so, I would probably give this movie 3.5 stars rather than 4, because, while it is very funny, I'm not sure if it is truly worhty of 4 stars.  However, I am rounding up, seeing as how it is definitely better than a 3 star movie.<br /><br />John (Owen Wilson) and Jeremy (Vince Vaughn) are wedding crashers.  They go to weddings with the sole intention of sleeping with women; they figure that the emotions that go hand-in-hand with a wedding make girls easier.  They come up with thourough backstories, names, and family connections so as not to raise suspicions toward themselves, and they follow a set of rules handed down to them by Chaz Reginold (Will Ferrel in an awesome cameo), an ex-crasher who is like the Elvis Presley of wedding crashing.  John and Jeremy are also successful divorce counselors when they aren't crashing.<br /><br />Near the end of "wedding season" one year, Jeremy is able to get them into a high-class wedding, where the bride is the daughter of the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury (Christopher Walken).  While at the wedding, John meets Claire (Rachel McAdams) and Jeremy meets Gloria (Ilsa Fisher), both of whom are the bride's sisters.  Jeremy scores with Gloria, but it turns out that Claire has a boyfriend (Bradley Cooper), who of course is a brute and is cheating on Claire.  Jeremy is ready to leave, but John tries to stay in order to get closer to Claire.  This allows the somewhat insane and chemically imbalanced Gloria (she had an entire army of invisible friends as a kid) to get the pair invited to a weekend at one of the Secretary's mansions on a small island.<br /><br />While John tries to court Claire, Jeremy tries to avoid Gloria, who actually, at one point, rapes him (she doesn't see it that way, though).<br /><br />For the most part, this movie delivered very well.  It was a tad inconsistent, where at one point, people would laugh so loud that the dialogue was drowned out, but there were a few points when not much was going on.  The only truly slow point was near the end.<br /><br />One thing that I really liked dealt with Walken's character.  Instead of making him the stereotypical father-knows-best chacracter, they made him an actual father who just wanted his daughters to be happy.<br /><br />If you're a fan of the so-called "brat pack" (Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughn, Owen Wilson, Luke Wilson, Jack Black), you'll love this movie.  Even if you're not, you should give it a try.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>Vince Vaughn makes this film what it is, not to mention the hot Rachel McAdams (love her smile). I was never a huge fan of his, but his comedic timing is on spot and he has never been funnier. Owen Wilson is great as well as the straight man and he plays off well with Vaughn's rapid fire dialogue. This movie had me laughing out loud at least a couple of dozen times and I didn't want it to end. This will be a keeper in my DVD collection for sure. As Vince Vaughn's character would say, "Go out and get some strange a**!"</p></br><a href="../users/A7Y6AVS576M03.html">A7Y6AVS576M03</a><br/><p>This movie had me laughing till my stomach was aching and I still couldn't stop. I thought this was just going to be one of your ordinary production line comedies they turn out these days from Hollywood. The situations that Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn get into are pretty outrageous. Ultimately the film takes a curious twist toward the bizarre. As the film establishes these two guys, they crash weddings with their incredibly witty and irresistible charm and have women literally falling into to bead with them. The film begins to enter the realm of the surreal once our two protagonists end up with Christopher Walken and his family and entourage who are just very strange people and that is where the film goes wild. You never know what is going to happen next and that's what makes this film so hilarious and also very witty. I found this movie very amusing and downright funny. I haven't laughed like this in years. To give too much of the plot away would ruin this film's impact. I think the general public has overlooked this film to an extent. The trailer for this film was totally misleading. I went in to see this movie reluctantly but came out laughing all the way home. This DVD is outstanding. The numerous scenes of these two womanizers with women in various stages of nudity are incredibly erotic. However, this just sets you up for more unexpected and flat out outrageous scenes. The film gets your natural instincts up to fever pitch and then the floor drops out from under you. The entire cast is perfect and you still never really know what's around the bend in this well scripted romp. Particularly, Vince Vaughn shows an incredible depth of talent I never knew he had. He just about steals this film away in a very subtle way that you just have to see. If you like outrageous humor and want unexpected laughs I highly recommend this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TK6R2JSC97HL.html">A1TK6R2JSC97HL</a><br/><p>Vince Vaugh and Owen Wilson are "The Wedding Crashers".  Most of the year, they're gifted and successful DC-based divorce mediators - talented enough yet jaded by their work to know that the happiest part of marriage ends with the wedding.  During wedding season itself, though, they change into uninvited guests who bring an almost super-professional precision to the art of worming into the lavish affairs of total strangers, and the arms of the many nubile bridesmaids that only seem to exist there.  Though mooching off well-healed spouses, John & Jeremy are easily the, life of any party.  (So much so, that you begin to wonder just who's really mooching off whom.)  While both are idea men of seeming limitless guile, Wilson's John brings the brains while Vince Vaughn's Jeremy has the high octane oomph that gets him past many would-be disasters.<br /><br />Trouble brews when John gets the two of them to crash the wedding of the Treasury Secretary's daughter.  Christopher Walken (doing well cast against type as the old-politics, old money scion) falls for John & Jeremy's cover-story at his daughter's tony nuptials and invites them home for the weekend when he sees them charm his remaining daughters.  Despite his invented life with Jeremy (in search of the loveliest bridesmaids and the most delectable finger-foods) John seems gamely attracted to the beautiful and conscientious Claire, While Jeremy finds himself in the clutches of Gloria, Walken's character's beautiful sociopath of a daughter.  Not much makes sense here - does John really think he'll charm Claire for keeps?  (The story greases things by making Sack Lodge, Claire's suitor, an utter cad.)  The thin plot of "Crashers" contains enough tricks to save it from having to answer simple questions like that - Walken's on-screen family are loveless and clueless utter misanthropes who've sacrificed their emotional and intellectual lives for appearances. (John & Jeremy have managed the same trick, but never had to give anything up, and only have to maintain the illusion for a few hours at a time.)  Our heroes are too self-respecting to give up a good party, even if that means a few nights on Christopher Walken's private island of horrors.  The story tosses in Walken's tortured and gay artist of a son and his addled mother.  It gets slow at times but "Wedding Crashers" ably works off the magic of Wilson's earnest platitudes about love and Vaughn's compulsive search for a good time.<br /><br />In short, this is the perfect antidote for those left bleak by "Sideways".</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>John Beckwith and Jeremy Grey have come up with a full-proof scheme to get women to sleep with them:  they go to weddings of total strangers, pass themselves off as distant relatives of either the bride or the groom, charm the living daylights out of the other guests, then put the make on any pretty young thing that happens to come their way.  And up till now, John and Jeremy have been able to pull off their little ruse pretty much without a hitch - until, that is, the day they decide to crash the wedding of the daughter of the Treasury Secretary of the United States.  Then all hell breaks loose...<br /><br />"The Wedding Crashers" is a comedy vehicle built for speed.  The dialogue comes so fast and furious that it's occasionally hard to absorb everything the characters are saying.  David Dobkin has followed suit in his direction, keeping the film going full-throttle at all points.  That's the good news about "The Wedding Crashers."  The bad news is that, as the movie goes on, the jokes and setups have a tendency to become a trifle strained, forced and labored, and the laughs begin to diminish as a result.  It's not that there aren't some very funny moments in "The Wedding Crashers," just that there aren't nearly as many as there should be.<br /><br />As the two party crashers, Owen Wilson takes the role of the smooth-talking romantic lead, while Vince Vaughn gets to be the cynical victim of circumstances that such buddy comedies seem to require.  Both are very good, but Vaughn, in particular, hits all the right notes as a man who finally meets his match with a girl (charmingly played by Isla Fisher) who has no intention of letting him get away from her after just a one night stand.  Rachel McAdams, Christopher Walken, Jane Seymour, Rebecca De Mornay, Dwight Yoakam, Henry Gibson and Ellen Albertini Dow - who, apparently, needs  to make an appearance in any movie that has the word "wedding" in its title - round out the cast.  And, ah yes, there is a fairly large, albeit uncredited, cameo appearance by none other than Will Ferrell late in the film.<br /><br />This is no bell-ringer of a comedy, to be sure, but it is at least harmless and watchable.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TWTULVD6F22O.html">A1TWTULVD6F22O</a><br/><p>There's more than a little irony in the fact that John and Jeremy (Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn) are divorce mediators, who have, for years, crashed wedding after wedding during the "season" and had a blast.  Their aim is to attract and bed women who are, no doubt, easier game for two truly "sensitive" guys during a typical wedding hijinks.<br /><br />They've inherited their moves from an old friend of Jeremy's who turns up in a brilliant comic bit at the movie's end...Will Ferrell.  This might be the only REAL highlight at the end of the movie, because "Wedding Crashers" is giddy, funny, and full of chemistry right through the Cleary wedding (a big, big Washington political shindig)....but after the boys follow the Cleary's home, lusting after two of the sisters, it evolves into some nonsensical scenarios.<br /><br />Vaughn is great, Wilson less so, but they'll appear together again, because they're a great comedic pair.  Most of the supporting cast was eye-popping and funny, although Bradley Cooper as "Sack", John's rival for the screen-illuminating Rachel McAdams (from "The Notebook")is way  over the top, and Jane Seymour is wasted in her role.  Nevertheless, the comedy winds down into the valley of the "still funny" as the heroes begin to see the error of their ways and start to settle down.<br /><br />Lewd language and scenes abound, and thus the "R" rating.  Please don't take a child or a preteen, but go in yourself, expecting not much, and I guarantee you'll leave entertained.  Shaking your head, perhaps, but still entertained.<br /><br />3.5 stars....5 for Vince Vaughn!</p></br><a href="../users/AS558SNWF1DXG.html">AS558SNWF1DXG</a><br/><p>By now, their onscreen personas are firmly established.<br /><br />Vince Vaughn gravitates to playing slick, amusingly arrogant motor-mouths. Impossibly tall and hyper, he often resembles a chatty, severely hung-over stork.<br /><br />Owen Wilson usually portrays talkative characters, too, but he goes in the opposite direction. Laid-back but always a little shifty, he's like a slightly baked sheepdog.<br /><br />They make a good comedic duo and, as "Wedding Crashers" opens, they're Maryland divorce mediators trying to finesse an amicable split between an acrimonious couple.<br /><br />Finally, the ex-husband-to-be (Dwight Yoakam) wearily compromises provided the guys "just stop talking."<br /><br />But Jeremy (Vaughn) and John (Wilson) do talk a great game, and on weekends they like to schmooze their way into weddings to take advantage of the free food, booze and merriment. The nuptial atmosphere also seems to make women more susceptible to their come-ons and to lines such as, "True love is your soul's recognition of its counterpoint in another," ... which actually is a pretty nice thought.<br /><br />The first third of "Crashers" follows the aging boys through a season of weddings, receptions and R-rated high-jinx, but just as the guys begin to lose interest in their scam, John falls for a bride's sister and Jeremy gets tangled up with a clingy flake he can't shake. The women, who are sisters, lure them to a seaside estate for a weekend with their family, a gang of nut jobs presided over by Christopher Walken (who, in the realm of actor/animal metaphors, has successfully patented himself as an intimidating iguana).<br /><br />If you've seen the previews, you know the drill. All the jokes in the ads are there - and a lot more - and the movie is good.<br /><br />The problem is, given the film's can't-miss premise and its extremely funny leads, "Crashers" should be almost great and it isn't. Some obvious problems bog it down.<br /><br />It's surprisingly long, a minute under two hours and, funny as it is, it feels long. No comedy about guys who crash weddings should stretch very far past 90 minutes; I mean, even "War of the Worlds" wrapped itself up in less time and that was about, well, a war of the worlds.<br /><br />Also, the movie's villain (Bradley Cooper, who plays Wilson's unfortunately named rival, Sack) is such a violent, hotheaded tool, he drains a lot of the fun out of the story. In a comedy, even the bad guy needs to be at least a little funny, but this one just doles out beatings, insults and creepy glares. By the end, I wanted to see Sack torn apart by carnivorous apes which - hate to spoil it - is not how "Crashers" ends.<br /><br />The movie is kind of all over the place, too. This is the first film in recent memory in which a genuinely touching scene about burgeoning love is stuck between a gag about bondage and footage of a guy vomiting into a toilet.<br /><br />Despite all its strange quirks and some sappiness at the end, though, "Crashers" hits much more often than it misses. I laughed a lot (Vaughn's confession to a priest - played by Henry Gibson, no less - is the funniest scene I've seen this year). I only wish the opening and closing credits were a little closer together.</p></br><a href="../users/A11PTCZ2FM2547.html">A11PTCZ2FM2547</a><br/><p>I had heard, over and over, from friends and foes alike, how zany and hilarious this comedy was.  And don't get moi wrong:  WEDDING CRASHERS has some definite hysterical moments (I thought I was going to bust a gut during the quail hunting scene).  But even in a screwball comedy like this, there has to be the development of a story, and the characters, even as outrageous as they are, have to stay consistent.  But such is not the case here, as WEDDING CRASHERS meanders, dips, curls, stalls, and cartwheels into a big pile of ho-hum.<br /><br />Which is a shame, as the story had potential and merit, with divorce mediators John and Jeremy (Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn) crashing weddings in the D.C. area--all to pick up girls, girls in the romantic mood for love, due to the matrimony environment.  And such a guise works, and works well, until the two buddies crash a wedding of the daughter of powerful Treasury Secretary William Cleary (Christopher Walken, who is absolutely wasted in this one-dimensional role).  John and Jeremy fall for the Secretary's other two daughters, and that's when this movie falls apart.  I mean, the wheels come off.<br /><br />There's nothing really left once the love interests are introduced, other than boy-meets-girl, boy-loses-girl, boy-gets-girl-back.  Well, we do have the added dimension that John's love interest Claire (Rachel McAdams) has a fiance to contend with, and he's a very snobby Ivy League type.  Throw in some really bizarre scenes (e.g., any of the Cleary family dinner scenes) where the material isn't funny, but just comes off as plain weird, along with some slow and ineffective mushy scenes between Wilson and McAdams, and this movie slows to a crawl.  Definite head-scratching stuff, because it just doesn't mesh or work.<br /><br />Vaughn, as if he's trying to salvage this picture himself, is over the top and smothering in literally every scene he's in, while Wilson's character is all over the map:  irresponsible, responsible, mature, immature, reflective, ignorant, etc.  This guy really does some puzzling stuff, particularly at the end of the movie, which made me wonder if the writers decided to create an entirely different character than the one who began the picture.  And then Will Ferrell is brought in as a cameo as this two-hour marathon comes to an end, yet his appearance is bizarre, and definitely not funny.  Jane Seymour plays Walken's wacky and unfaithful wife; Jane still looks very good (and proves it in one scene), but her role is very typical of the entire movie.  WEDDING CRASHERS looks good, has a few raunchy laughs, and even had some potential. . .yet the entire picture is like my kitchen after I try to cook omelettes:  A mess.<br /><br />--D. Mikels, Author, WALK-ON</p></br><a href="../users/A2RDR5G65D9H84.html">A2RDR5G65D9H84</a><br/><p>It has been several years since a movie made me laugh as much as this one did. I watched it using headphones, sitting next to my wife, and she stopped what she was doing several times and looked at me like I had gone crazy. The truth is that if you enjoy humor that is sometimes politically incorrect, and even a little rude, you will have a blast with this film.<br /><br />The premise is pretty simple, John and Jeremy are two friends that crash weddings and not only get free food and drinks, but also hook up with a lot of girls in the process. They are living the good life and stay on this path of hit and run fun for a while. But when at the wedding of the daughter of Secretary William Cleary they get together with the two sisters of the bride, things get a little more complicated. They end up going on a weekend trip to an island with the family and close friends of the just married couple, and the madness goes on a rampage.<br /><br />The cast does an outstanding job. I was surprised by how good Vince Vaughn was on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HCPS94">The Break-Up</a>, but I think he is even better on this movie, with a great delivery of some extremely funny lines. I have been disappointed in the past by Owen Wilson, but here he made me laugh out loud, and he certainly showed us that he can play the "good" guy effectively. Then there is Isla Fisher, who is great in her role of Gloria, the nymph that "captures" Jeremy in her net and makes Glenn Close in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXA0">Fatal Attraction</a> look sane. The rest of the cast does not lag far behind, including a conflicted brother of the bride, a mother in need of attention, and a priest that gets more than he bargained for, but I have to make a special mention for Will Ferrell. Fans of this actor know what I am talking about. In the couple of scenes in which he partakes from the action, he makes us laugh so much that it is unbelievable.<br /><br />I think that by now it is pretty clear. Those that like "proper" humor should not even consider watching this. However, if you are looking for one of the funniest movies in the last several years and do not care much about political correctness, this is a film you cannot miss.</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>John Beckwith (Owen Wilson) and Jeremy Grey (Vince Vaughn) are lifelong friends and business partners who work as divorce mediators in Washington, D.C.  They are fairly good at what they do and seem to enjoy what they do.  The reason for this is that in the springtime they take off and travel around the country seeking weddings to crash.  It doesn't matter the ethnicity or culture of the people involved, they have an identity for each one.  Besides the free food and drinks, the reason the duo crashes these weddings is so that they can pick up women who have become sexually aroused by the weddings.  It's one woman after another and a seemingly neverending party.  That is until Jeremy convinces John to attend the wedding of the daughter of Treasure Secretary William Cleary (Christopher Walken).  It's a lavish affair and John becomes smitten with Cleary's daughter, Claire (Rachel McAdams) while Jeremy just wants to roll around in the hay with Cleary's daughter, Gloria (Isla Fisher).  John and Jeremy are invited by the daughters back to the family estate for the weekend and John begs Jeremy to go so that he can try to get to know Claire better, even though she has a jerk boyfriend named Sack (Bradley Cooper).  It's a weekend full of comic mishaps and misunderstandings that eventually leads to some sappy nonsense about love and relationships.<br /><br />WEDDING CRASHERS features a lot of situational comedy and is seeped in innuendo.  There's also some brief glimpses of nude women.  All of that appeals heavily to adolescent males and helped make the movie one of the top grossing films of 2005, led it to be named as one of "The 50 Greatest Comedies Of All Time" in 2006 by Premiere magazine, and gave both Wilson and Vaughn one of the biggest movies of their careers up to that point.<br /><br />But that's really all just fluff.  The main reasons to watch WEDDING CRASHERS is for the dialogue and to see Christopher Walken.  Props to writers Steve Faber and Bob Fisher (as well as Olson and Vaughn who adlibbed some bits) for giving Jeremy and John such witty diatribe throughout the film.  Whether it's about the virtues of not-dating, thoughtfully reflecting upon how to live a meaningful life, or a pontification about falling in love, WEDDING CRASHERS has some great dialogue to quote.  As for the other reason to watch, it's Christopher Walken. We should watch anything that man does. Enough said.<br /><br />I don't enjoy WEDDING CRASHERS as much as my brothers or some of my friends do.  It has some funny moments and I can see why it is so popular.  However, it's definitely not a movie for everyone.  That's not to say that I didn't like it, because that's not true.  I just don't think it's as funny as a lot of people think it is.  Still, it's still a movie that any serious movie buff should see at least once.  If nothing else, you'll at least have some great dialogue to bring up in conversations later.<br /><br />The DVD includes two commentaries, one with Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn, the other with director David Dobkin.  Also included are deleted scenes, two featurettes "Event Planning" and "A Crash Course in Wedding Crashing", and a music video from The Sights called "Circus".</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>This is a very funny movie. I can't think of many films with the word wedding in the title that I like. If you haven't seen it,you should, but stick to the regular edition. One of the better comedies to come out in a while.</p></br><a href="../users/A3HM5G9IV1FTFP.html">A3HM5G9IV1FTFP</a><br/><p>"Wedding Crashers" is clearly aiming to be a raunchy comedy with a heart of gold the way "The 40 Year Old Virgin" was. But where "Virgin" succeeded in being both uproariously funny and genuinely touching, "Wedding Crashers" only comes across as mildly amusing. Vince Vaughn is funny and charming as usual, playing a motormouthed, hapless rascal. As his wedding crasher buddy, Owen Wilson basically just phones in his performance, and I almost can't blame him ... he's basically been "that guy with the nose and hair" in every recent Hollywood buddy flick. Rachel McAdams, who plays Wilson's love interest, is absolutely adorable, and steals the film, but it's too bad that her romance with Wilson isn't nearly as believable as she is. As for the comedy, some of the jokes hit and some of them miss, making "Wedding Crashers" a pleasant but uneven and lukewarm film.</p></br></body></html>

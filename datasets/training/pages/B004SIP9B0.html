She did not feel anything should be done for the princess by the monarchy, as she has divorced from Prince Charles (Jennings), but the people of England were looking to her to show some compassion.  Newly elected Prim Minister Tony Blair (Sheen) attempts to offer advice to the Queen, but he mostly rebuffed.  Adding to the tension is the fact that Blair's popularity skyrockets in this time of national mourning.<br /><br />"The Queen" is a fascinating look into the world of the British Monarchy.  I know very little about it, and the film held my interest throughout.  Mirren is excellent as a queen who is struggling to maintain the only lifestyle she has ever known in the face of changing times and a popular ex-monarch's death.  Sheen is also good as Tony Blair.  All in all, "The Queen" is an extremely engaging film that is worth seeing.</p></br><a href="../users/A1RSXP7MB772E3.html">A1RSXP7MB772E3</a><br/><p>Although short, and demeaningly unpartisan, you get a transformational performance, not just by Helen Mirren, but by Micheal Sheen who plays PM Tony Blair. I've sat in and watched the PM many times on CSpan, particularly during his defensive speeches in the tumultuous court where the house of commons is held and Sheens likeness is staggering for me and also brings a real, profound feel to the film which is pursued to an even higher level with the smart screen play. Toss any mention of awards out the window, truely see this film for a rare opportunity to see a powerful and meaningful lead female performance. I mean performance in every new sense of the word. It almost reminds me of the possessive performance last year by Philip Seymour Hoffman as Capote. I can only imagine the homework needed for such insightful and catapulting performances. This isn't a directors film, its a film carried by its actors, much like this years Dreamgirls but yet it blends so seemlessly together that without some sort of nod in Stephen Frears, I would feel consciously guilty. It takes the 'right' man for the job to capture all the goodness of this film and not flounder it! At least I must imagine. Sort of like too much talent on one basketball team, and you end up with only a conference championship because of the impossible complexities and overwhelming duty towards placing all of them coherently together. Since the awards have an almost stale approach to gifting the years best movie award to factional movies dealing with unpopular times, I would make this film the sleeper hit. But all bets are with the Departed. It's Martins year.</p></br><a href="../users/A13E0ARAXI6KJW.html">A13E0ARAXI6KJW</a><br/><p>It's reassuring to see an actress of Helen Mirren's caliber finally receiving the top-line recognition she deserves for a role that must have been challenging to tackle without sinking into parody as others before her have. As Queen Elizabeth II, she manages to convey the immaculate decorum of her real-life counterpart without sacrificing the humanism essential in empathizing with her during a trying time. The period in question is the week that felt like an eternity after the death of Princess Diana in 1997 when the world was awaiting an official response from the Queen. With just a wig and glasses to alter her appearance, Mirren is superb in a role that must have been quite constraining given that the subject is not only still the reigning monarch but the model of blank-faced self-possession. Written by Peter Morgan and directed by Stephen Frears in a surprisingly dishy manner, the film actually plays out as a witty comedy of manners beset by a tragic event.<br /><br />The 2006 film chronicles that momentous week and prefaces it with Tony Blair's first formal introduction to the Queen in May 1997 after his election as the first Labour Party Prime Minister in nearly two decades. Elizabeth's concerns over Blair's promises of modernity are expressed in small gestures, but obviously their values-based clash come to the fore when Diana is killed in a Paris car accident six months later. Cloistered at the time in their Scottish estate, Balmoral, the royal family does not support a public memorial for Diana since she had divorced Charles the previous year. However, public outcry over their seeming aloofness reaches a level of frenzy that places Blair in the difficult spot of requesting the Queen to speak to her subjects about what she considers a private matter. Exacerbating the situation is the residual animosity that the royal family feels toward Diana, whom they feel had betrayed them in the media.<br /><br />While the story is fact-based, one can't help but believe the private moments are played with a certain amount of exaggerated tabloid-friendly bias, especially the frequently cutting swipes at Diana and the rather fanciful episode with the stag. It makes for some of the film's more entertaining moments, but concurrently they undermine the credibility of the account. Beyond Mirren, there is superbly comic work from James Cromwell as a blustery, unsympathetic Prince Philip; Alex Jennings as a grieving but oddly vacant and paranoid Prince Charles; Helen McCrory as Blair's curtsey-challenged, tough-minded wife Cherie; and Sylvia Syms (not the jazz singer) as the still-alert, eye-rolling Queen Mother. Initially, Michael Sheen looks like he will do a zealous parody of the real Blair, but he gains respectable gravity as the story progresses. Above all else, the film is a personal triumph for Mirren's stellar work in what may turn out to be the role of a lifetime.</p></br><a href="../users/A22RY8N8CNDF3A.html">A22RY8N8CNDF3A</a><br/><p>"The Queen" begins with the newly elected P.M. Tony Blair considering his approach to the monarchy amidst calls for its elimination; meanwhile, the Royal Family (Queen included) continue in their aloof manner and somewhat snobby manner.<br /><br />Then comes the death of Princess Diana - the populace react with an outpouring of grief, while the Royal Family remains stoic amidst their well-known resentment of her divorce and subsequent behavior. The result is a dangerous loss of support for the monarchy.<br /><br />Tony Blair takes the initiative and steadily and skillfully prods the Queen towards a public demonstration of grief, and she finally complies - bringing the Queen and the people closer together.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDNTB7377YH2.html">A1CDNTB7377YH2</a><br/><p>I went to this movie on a date expecting it to put me to sleep.  Boy was I ever wrong!  This movie could have easily won best picture too.  It was so well made and Helen Mirren's performance as Queen Elizabeth was not overstated.  She definitely deserved the award she won.  The movie focuses on the death of Princess Diana and how the Royal family behaved during the period immediately after.<br /><br />The movie portrayed Elizabeth as someone who stuck to tradition (heavily influenced by her mother) and had faith that by sticking to tradition, the public at large would come around and see that she was right.  Unfortunately those traditions were for a time past and no longer held in the Tabloid influenced world of today where celebrities are put under the microscope and all their actions are highly scrutinized.<br /><br />Besides Mirren, there were solid performances all around especially by the actor who played Tony Blair.  The director seemed to show that the two smartest people were Blair's and the Queen's personal assistants.  Each one seemed to give the soundest advice of all and both were highly in tune with the public at large.<br /><br />Even though I basically knew the story going in, I was mesmerized by the way this film was presented.  It should not be missed.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GPEV42IO41CI.html">A2GPEV42IO41CI</a><br/><p>This film details Queen Elizabeth's (Helen Mirren) reaction to Princess Diana's death and her relationship with new Prime Minister Tony Blair (Michael Sheen).  As Elizabeth clearly distains the Princess and finds her death just one more in a series of irritations, she wants to keep the mourning and funeral of her former daughter-in-law private.  Blair, however, thinks that would harm the monarchy in the eyes of the people who loved Diana, and urges the queen to go to London to speak publicly, fly a flag at half-mast over Buckingham Palace, and be seen grieving.  Though she despises public displays of emotion, she reluctantly agrees.<br /><br />Mirren gives a flawless impersonation of Elizabeth and James Cromwell is equally fine as grumpy Prince Phillip.  Sheen gives a sympathetic performance as Tony Blair, a young man who hopes to bring the monarchy into the modern age.  The palatial sets are grand and the "behind the scenes" peek at the Queen's private life is certainly enjoyable, but, as a non-Brit, I found the plot rather inconsequential and pointless.  The movie is impressive but ultimately forgettable - excellent acting and production values but a narrow subject of limited appeal that lacks a satisfying conclusion.</p></br><a href="../users/APRZ2IVM8JTLV.html">APRZ2IVM8JTLV</a><br/><p>THE QUEEN(2006)<br /><br />  A superb historical film about how Queen Elizabeth ll and newly elected Prime Minister of Great Britain Tony Blair cope with the hysteria during the death and funeral of Princess Diana. A textbook example of how the historical film should be done. Fair and balanced. Accurate. No Political Agenda to muck up the proceedings. A controled informed script with excellent telling dialogue acted by a perfect inspired cast. Enlightning, entertaining and educational. The sort of thing that films were made for and the ideal that all should aspire. Very likely the best film of 2006 and most certainly the best historical film of the year.</p></br><a href="../users/A34GZPHWYPSY2T.html">A34GZPHWYPSY2T</a><br/><p>Lord, there are nearly 400 reviews here...so mine will be mercifully short and to the point.<br /><br />-This is one of the most fantastic films ever. We never tire of watching it and it feels like England, a thing I prize above all in English film. (And I do not restrict this feeling to British film.)<br /><br />-The performances here are so dazzling that one forgets that in the film, Diana, her brother, and several others "play" themselves thanks to the stunning genius of Stephen Frears.<br /><br />-The soundtrack by Andre Desplat, which I have reviewed, is haunting and superior to most soundtracks I've heard in my life.<br /><br />-Helen Mirren does a frighteningly wonderful job portraying Her Majesty. I was in total commiseration with her throughout the entire film. It was PM Blair who sort of angered me. Lucky they took so many liberties with the truth (which we shall never know in full).<br /><br />-Before hitting Sylvia Sims too harshly for her portrayal of the Queen Mother, bear in mind Frears had begged Joan Plowright to take the role. I think Plowright was too busy filming some crappy film. What a difference it would have made, but Sims does her job!<br /><br />-The scenes at what is supposed to be Balmoral are airy and beautiful. It conveys perfectly what life can be like there, even though no one was anywhere near Balmoral, Cowes, or anywhere like that.<br /><br />If you don't already own and cherish this movie, you are a prize lunk-head!</p></br><a href="../users/A3VIOCJZ22JZXT.html">A3VIOCJZ22JZXT</a><br/><p>This is an excellent, highly entertaining film. It has a smartly written script that is humorous and never lags; excellent sequencing and editing to keep the viewer fully engaged; exceptional acting from Helen Mirren, James Cromwell, and Michael Sheen; and an underlying theme of adaptive leadership that is superbly and seamlessly integrated into the narrative. It is the theme of adaptive leadership, exhibited first by Tony Blair and later by Queen Elisabeth, on which I would like to comment.<br /><br />Everyone knows the story here of the tragic death of Princess Diana, the outpouring of public grief, and the failure of reaction on the part of the Windsors.  What is not as well known is the story behind the action where Tony Blair, the new Prime Minister, was able to gradually move Queen Elisabeth to comprehend the public mood and to respond to that mood appropriately. Both characters display the adaptive leadership and necessary flexibility to survive and move the public agenda forward. Blair fully grasps the situation as well as the need to apply just enough pressure to the Queen so that she grows and doesn't retreat.  Michael Sheen is super as Tony Blair, using intelligent charm and strategic wit to move the queen to recognition of the gravity of the issues and to take action by showing empathy with the grief of the English people. James Cromwell is excellent as Prince Phillip, sometimes playing the role of the Queen's alter-ego or id with his displays of disgust and indignation. At other times he reveals the isolated and insulated existence of the Windsors that separated them from normal existence. I would recommend this film to be viewed and analyzed in a class on adaptive leadership.</p></br><a href="../users/ATXL536YX71TR.html">ATXL536YX71TR</a><br/><p>I still stand in amazement that Peter Morgan's ingenious and character-angst rich screenplay THE QUEEN did not win the 2007 Oscar.Sometimes I just sit back and sigh and say "What the....." when Awards are bestowed.<br /><br />Revisiting THE QUEEN, now, after first seeing it in the theatres,I was struck with how utterly prophetic Peter Morgan's script so aptly directed by Stephen Frears is.Helen Mirren, unquestionably "queenly" in her inhabitation of Queen Elizabeth of England, prophetically proclaims to Tony Blair (after the whole Diana funeral had come to a close) how incredibly difficult and hurtful it was to her to see that 1 out of 4 Brits actually hated her during her indecision with protocol over Diana's death.Mirren advises quite soberly."It will happen to you Mr.Blair...quite suddenly,without warning!" Were ever more Royal expressions  more true.<br /><br />The one genius of this script is that it not only attempts to humanize and demonize The Royals and the new Prime Minister,but it shows the inescapable political charade that all parties were forced to play in a moment's notice.Princess Diana has died.She is no longer a Royal.Tony Blair has just won a landslide victory for his Party,and Queen Elizabeth if forced to face 1000 years of Monarchical Protocol in the light of such sudden events,especially in the light of her disapproval of Diana AND the new Prime Minister.<br /><br />What a travesty that this film was only recognized with one single Oscar-that of Helen Mirren,who rightfully deserved it.How many times have I heard, "OH,the movie where Helen Mirren plays The Queen!".But this film is so much more than the acting of Helen Mirren.Michael Sheen as Tony Blair is every bit as important in making this film work,and the Alexandre Desplats soundtrack and the adept direction of Stephen Frears made this SUCH a neat,tidy,seamless and "positively practically English" look at how world leaders deal with events.<br /><br />Well. Mr.Blair IS gone from office..."quite suddenly, and without warning" and The Queen STILL sits upon her throne.This film should be rewatched often and with great warning to those in high offices. The Queen eventually did what was right for the people,even though everything in her said "NO".Oh,Mr.Blair....why did you not heed your own advice?</p></br><a href="../users/A1A535W556ROBQ.html">A1A535W556ROBQ</a><br/><p>Hellen Mirren gives Queen Elizabeth such a regal human element that you can't help feeling for the Queen during what had to be a very trying time for the monarchy.  The movie focuses specifically on the days that followed Diana's death.  A surprisingly compact film that gives one a relatively intimate look at the royal family without delving too deeply into the emotions.  Prince Philip and the Queen Mother are presented as the most callous figures in this film, while Prince Charles agonizes over the impact Diana's death will have on the family, particularly "the boys," which are seen only from the back and not mentioned by name.  Meanwhile, the Queen is torn between protocol and what appear to be her own emotions regarding Diana's death.<br /><br />Your opinion of the monarchy after the tragedy of Diana won't be swayed much one way or the other by this movie as Stephen Frears plays it pretty close to the hip.  About the only thing new is the apparent feelings of Tony Blair in regard to the monarchy, doing his best to advise the royal family of the impact the death of Diana was having on the British people at the time, and getting them to come out of their sequestered Balmoral estate, where most of the action takes place.  Michael Sheen offers an uncanny performance as Blair, capturing his character to a tee.</p></br><a href="../users/A387BD735MI50R.html">A387BD735MI50R</a><br/><p>This movie puts us in Queen Elizabeth's shoes. It shows us the burdens of royal office from her point of view. So it provides an unusual perspective - an alternative to simply gawking at royalty from outside their gates.<br /><br />Helen Mirren brings wonderful gravitas to her role, mixing it with the homely English capacity to push through. She's someone who reigns on the one hand, and who serves her family picnic salad and investigates how to jack her car out of the mud on the other hand. (I didn't even know that the Monarch drives her own car a lot of the time.)<br /><br />There are several commentaries on the DVD. I found the director/writer commentary a little dry, with a sort of unpleasant testiness in the exchange between the two. Robert Lacey's commentary is a bit livelier, so if you only have time to listen to one commentary, I suggest you make it Lacey's account of the history behind some of the royal protocol.<br /><br />Then if you would like to consider the role of monarchy a little further, I suggest you check out the "The Swan," a film starring Alec Guinness and Grace Kelly. This is perhaps Grace Kelly's most overlooked film, but possibly her best. The movie is based on Hungarian writer Ferenc Molnar's famous work. It features a brilliant closing speech by Guinness, arguing that a Queen's duty is to glide alone and serene away from all popular pastime and indulgence.<br /><br />Since Princess Di came on the scene, everyone automatically cast her as - the rose - the swan. However, this Helen Mirren movie makes a good case that Elizabeth II, purse and pumps and all, has nevertheless these last 50 years, kept faith as the swan.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>Going into `The Queen' I wasn't really expecting much at all.  My parents had seen the film and disliked it greatly sighting that it was boring and slow moving and nothing like they had expected.  Now I am never the one to follow my parent's advice, especially when it comes to entertainment, but there was something about this movie that screamed `TV Movie' to me and so I just didn't expect to like it much at all.  My wife wanted to see it though and so I conceded, and I must admit that since I love everything Oscar and feel this incessant need to embrace all that they embrace, at least so I can form an opinion, I wasn't hesitant about sitting down to watch the film.<br /><br />What I found though was a brilliantly crafted biopic that held my interest and proved to be highly entertaining.<br /><br />The film follows the days preceding the untimely death of Princess Diana and the media coverage of the Royal families reaction, or lack there of.  Young Tony Blair had just been elected Prime Minister before the tragedy and thus finds himself dealing with some very touchy issues very early on in his career.  The film does a fair job of trying to flesh out the motives of the royal family, especially those of the Queen herself, trying to make her appear real to the audience and maybe explain her strange behavior following the death of Princess Diana.<br /><br />This fleshing out of the Queen is due to the amazing portrayal by Oscar winner Helen Mirren.  This was a very challenging role even though it won't appear that way.  When watching Mirren converse and interact on the screen you will see no hysterics, no outburst of emotion, nothing that screams Oscar.  What you will see is a woman dealing with the situation that lay before her, the people in her life telling her one thing and another as well as her own thoughts and feelings on the matter.  What you will see is the buried emotion that hides behind her eyes as she takes in everything but never divulges a single emotion.  This my friends is very hard to do.  Hysterics and outbursts may be difficult to tame and make believable but completely reserved emotion is just as hard to accomplish.  Helen Mirren soars in this regard.<br /><br />The rest of the cast hold there own as well, especially Michael Sheen who portrays Tony Blair as both thoughtful and understanding.  Blair is probably the most well rounded character aside from the Queen herself here, the balance of the cast falling a bit into the background proving to be more or less accessories to the two main characters.  James Cromwell and Sylvia Syms do excellent work here as Prince Philip and the Queen Mother (was it just me or did they make Helen Mirren up to look OLDER than Syms who was playing her mother), both providing some explanation as to the Queens actions that given week.  Both Philip and Elizabeth are portrayed as very headstrong and somewhat tactless individuals whose contempt for Diana spilled over into their reaction to her death.  Prince Charles is portrayed rather sympathetically by Alex Jennings who seemed to capture the essence that was and is Charles beautifully.<br /><br />Stephen Frears and Peter Morgan should be singled out though for helming the creation of this film.  Frears direction only magnifies the brilliance of Morgan's script that is both accurate (all biopics fail to be completely accurate, but in Hollywood terms this is quite good), witty, funny and engaging as well as educational for it helps the general public understand a little better a woman that not too many fully understand.  I won't deny the fact that, at times, `The Queen' does play out like a `TV Movie' for its production is not as polished as one might expect, but that in the end may be part of its appeal.  The lack of polish helps to keep the focus on the acting, which is miles above those found in `TV Movies'.<br /><br />I am not one who believes Helen Mirren gave the best performance of the year or even of her five fellow nominees but now that I have witnessed her performance I can't say that I am upset with her win either.  She showed true strength and temperance with her delivery and was commanding without being showy.<br /><br />`The Queen' is a movie I am glad to have seen and one that I will most likely see again for it proved to be much better than I had expected and delivered much more than I thought it could.  Is it in my top ten of the year?  No, but it is one of those `honorable mentions' that is worth just about everyone's time.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DDPQ9342UNMY.html">A3DDPQ9342UNMY</a><br/><p>HELEN MIRREN is, of course, the focal point in THE QUEEN, but MICHAEL SHEEN as Tony Blair certainly more than matches her in the role of Britain's youngest prime minister. The two of them give towering performances that will remain indelibly impressed on your mind after viewing the film. Mirren is all crisp elegance and Sheen is a charmer who knows how to use his powers of persuasion. Both of them are ideally cast in roles they seem to inhabit with consummate ease.<br /><br />The screenplay deals with the unpleasant private events unfolding at the palace while the public mourning was obviously so great that it had to be acknowledged. The Queen preferred keeping tight-lipped and dignified, obviously not a woman who was pleased with Diana's conduct. Nor was her husband Prince Philip (JAMES CROMWELL) or Prince Charles (ALEX JENNINGS) who at least reminded his mother that Diana loved her children dearly.<br /><br />Handsomely photographed with newsreel footage of the crowds that began swelling shortly after Diana's demise in that tragic accident, it's dialog is convincing throughout, concise and to the point without any frills whatsoever. The only weakness in the casting would seem to be SYLVIA SYMS as the Queen Mother who somehow doesn't look the role.<br /><br />The original background score by Alexandre Desplat is worthy of note, always appropriate and sometimes majestic. The scene with The Queen seeing the stag on the hillside while waiting for her car to be repaired is a standout, beautifully played.<br /><br />Summing up: A rare treat, and a slice of history well worth remembering with the shift from the old monarchy to the modernized ideas of a young Prime Minister emphasized in the script.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ.html">A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ</a><br/><p>Watch this and it will be obvious why Helen Mirren won the Oscar for Best Actress for her remarkable portrayal of the seventy-year-old Elizabeth II, trying to cope with a world she no longer understands -- and doesn't really want to. The story line covers the week following the death in Paris of Princess Diana, which was also the very beginning of Tony Blair's decade as Labor Prime Minister. Many of those surrounding Blair (played very effectively by Michael Sheen) -- including his wife, Cherie -- were not sympathetic to anything about the Royal Family, whom they regarded as outmoded leeches on society. And while we will never know just how authentic Peter Morgan's first-rate script is, the viewer will come away convinced that Prince Philip and the Queen Mother, especially, had and have a 19th-century attitude of entitlement. Prince Charles comes off as a pathetic weakling, too, trying to sidle up to Blair for his own protection. Because of the Queen's insistence on "privacy," her complete lack of understanding of the need of the public all around the world to mourn Diana, one quarter of the British people toward the end of that week were becoming convinced the monarchy should be abolished. (And that's my gripe with the real-world Blair, too: He had the chance to kill off the monarchy completely but he didn't take it. Instead, he converted to storybook royalism, a victim of mawkish sentimentality -- just as his wife warned him all prime ministers had done.) As a dramatic film (not a documentary), this effort is very, very good.</p></br><a href="../users/A2JXAQ92WYPAAR.html">A2JXAQ92WYPAAR</a><br/><p>I remember seeing Helen Mirren years ago in an odd thing called "O Lucky Man." A wonderful film actually, but not terribly well-known, I guess. Anyway, it was a time in British film when actresses were expected to go topless so, like Glenda Jackson and the rest of her generation, dear, sweet Helen had to run around half-naked. Of course, viewers loved it. The point is that Ms Mirren has always been a daring, courageous actress, and I suspect it took a lot of guts for her to do the Queen. She is good, and the film isn't bad, although I suspect it will be remembered chiefly for the performances. The story is compelling, but the conflict seems very particular to its time, a unique and disturbing moment, but not one that points to universals. I can't help thinking that she deserves far more interesting roles. Like Guilgud, the great Shakespearean actor, if I am not mistaken, Mirren has Slavic (Russian?) blood in her, which perhaps explains her capacity for extraordinary passion. In this picture, it is all contained and repressed. I'd like to see it exposed.</p></br><a href="../users/A28WJUJF6D2ULA.html">A28WJUJF6D2ULA</a><br/><p>For the performance she presented in The Queen, Helen Mirren absolutely deserved to win the Oscar for Best Actress as she did. She was convincing in one of the most difficult roles any British actress could be called upon to play, and it was also courageous of this former Bond girl, often noted in American memories for being cast as great beauties and occasional seductresses, to lose herself as completely as she did in the Queen's stately contained matronly presence. Also deserving of note is Michael Sheen's chameleon-like transformation into Tony Blair. Sheen should have gotten more acclaim than he received for the skill with which he brought a still-relevant political figure so deftly to the screen. James Cromwell was great as always as the cantankerous old tyrant Prince Phillip, and only the casting of Alex Jennings as the Prince of Wales puzzled me, as Jennings, though a sound actor, did not seem to fit the part as well as many others could have. The Queen was, I thought, a riveting take on events that remain fresh in the collective minds of people around the world, and it managed to disarm cynicism and capture a convincing account of what would ordinarily be the private moments of highly public figures. In my opinion The Queen was so much better than anything nominated against it as Best Picture at last year's Academy Awards that it represented in its loss in that category the greatest mistake in Academy voting since Shakespeare In Love displaced Saving Private Ryan to take home top honors. See this film. It's a work of cinematic art.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R90OGE1EACZE.html">A3R90OGE1EACZE</a><br/><p>If you can see one movie this year, this is the one to see. Helen Mirren and Michael Sheen give riviting performances as Queen Elizabeth II and Tony Blair.<br /><br />The movie centers around Elizabeth and Blairs relationship surrounding the turbulent days and weeks after the death of Princess Diana and how they delt with it while trying to do their jobs.<br /><br />Great Movie</p></br><a href="../users/AT07UZQQR7ZEH.html">AT07UZQQR7ZEH</a><br/><p>I wasn't sure what to say about Stephen Frears' Oscar-winning film, THE QUEEN, that had not already been seen.  The movie has played for months on end in San Francisco art theaters, but never once reached my local suburb, so it probably also never played in small towns across America.  That was my key, along with friends wanting MY personal take on this Best Picture Oscar nominee and Actress winner when it FINALLY got onto DVD.<br /><br />For starters, Helen Mirren gives one of the great performances of all time and richly deserved the thousand awards she has gotten as Queen Elizabeth II.  But she could not do much if Peter Morgan's award-winning script were not as brilliant as it is; the same goes for Frears' magnificent direction.  The movie got Oscar-nominated in several major categories, including Picture and Direction and Actress; I would have added Production Design.  On a mediocre audio commentary, Frears and Morgan curiously ridicule and bad-mouth their own movie in terms of jokes and wrong locations because of a low-budget.  Actually, this is a very handsome-looking film in terms of sets and costumes.  So when you play this DVD, do ignore the Morgan and Frears audio commentary, and maybe try a second one with a British historian and royal family author.  Or just listen to the movie "cold".<br /><br />What we have here is a fascinating and insightful drama about the week following Princess Diana's car crash death in 1997 Paris, as filtered through the perspective of the Royal family who are at Balmoral, their hideaway in the Scottish highlands (rich location filming).  Morgan's screenplay gives us a day-by-day portrait of the conflict between the Monarchs and the Blairs, Queen Elizabeth and Prime Minister Tony Blair (a marvelous Michael Sheen), fresh young blood versus a centuries-old conservative monarchy.  We observe, like flies on a wall, how the death of Diana is viewed by both the Queen and Tony.  The Blairs side with the British public, who adored Diana.  They want the flag over Buckingham Palace flown at half-mast, even though the Royal family is in Scotland for the week, and they want a public statement from the Queen.  As more and more flowers pile up outside Buckingham Palace, where people are holding a vigil all week and impatiently waiting for their queen to show herself, Elizabeth reads the various newspapers criticizing her.  She did not like Diana that much and views this as very much a private funeral.  THE QUEEN is rich in character more than plot.<br /><br />Eventually, the public gets its wish for a flag at half-mast, a public TV statement by a queen who barely feels and coldly recites the words she is saying, and a walk among the thousands of people behind police barriers.  The loveliest scene, or at least my favorite, has a little girl giving the Queen a bouquet of flowers.  "For me?" she inquires softly.  "Thank you," she says with true sympathy.  Mirren is just towering and flawless in her Oscar-winning role, reason enough to watch THE QUEEN.  But Sheen, and veteran Sylvia Sims and Oscar-nominee James Cromwell, are also excellent as the Queen Mother and Prince Philip, respectively.  The movie should also have gotten a Makeup Oscar nomination since Mirren is beautiful and sexy in real life and looks nothing like Elizabeth.  But with the right white wig and reading glasses and a soft accent, she IS the Queen.  (You might want to watch the film with the English subtitle captions turned on to catch all of the dialogue.)<br /><br />The DVD for THE QUEEN is letterboxed at 1.85, middle-range wide-screen.  (There is also a pan/scan full screen version.)  Like I said earlier, it has two audio commentaries, and the one I played with the director and writer does the movie a real disservice by constantly pointing out all its flaws.  But there is also a very good and informative 20 minute filmmaking documentary and chat with the cast.  It got a PG-13 rating for "brief language" which bypassed me; I'd give the film a "PG" instead for all ages.  This could be a thrilling English history lesson supplement in high schools and colleges.  Happy viewing!</p></br><a href="../users/A27FR2C67JPDRS.html">A27FR2C67JPDRS</a><br/><p>Helen Mirren is AMAZING in this film.  You just can't mention this brilliant movie with giving kudos to an actress who steps into the shoes of England's current monarch and makes you believe with such eery success that she IS the Queen.<br /><br />This movie, one of the best of the year, looks at the life of Queen Elizabeth II, during the week of Diana's death.  With Tony Blair as a beginning Prime Minister (and played to perfection by actor Michael Sheen), the Queen tries to deal with the Diana's tragic death and the public's perception of how she should grieve.  Trying to protect Diana's young sons and preferring to hide at Balmoral, the Queen brings about the wrath of her citizens, seemingly acting in a cold and uncaring way to the death of a woman loved world wide.<br /><br />The movie is short and conise: the director concentrating on a dramatic time in the Queen's life, a turning point that perhaps changed the idea of the monarchy for the Queen and her public.  Mirren seems to fall away, becoming a woman who can't understand how she should be forced to deal with such a private matter in public, but eventually surrendering to the will of her people.  I found one scene very interesting, in which she grieves the lost of a brilliant stag, shot on a neighboring territory.  She waves him away, hoping to save him from hunters.  To me, the stag in a sense, was like Diana, beautiful but hunted incessantly.  However, with the stag, it seemed the Queen could grieve much easier and yet found it difficult to deal with the death of her grandchildren's mother.<br /><br />The cast does an incredible job with their roles (James Cromwell is [...]and mean spirited as Prince Philip) and as I mentioned before, Michael Sheen becomes Tony Blair.  The one actor I didn't care for was Alex Jennings who played Prince Charles.  He never seemed to get the mannerisms and character of the Prince of Wales, though the film treats him with sympathy as opposed to the other royals.  Other than that, this movie is deserving of winning the big award, Best Picture of the Year.<br /><br />If you enjoy great acting, the royal family or the brilliant Helen Mirren, you must go and see this film.  I look forward to the dvd release of this film!</p></br><a href="../users/A3OEECMCM2T4KQ.html">A3OEECMCM2T4KQ</a><br/><p>This is certainly a magnificent performance from Helen Mirren as Queen Elizabeth II. In fact the entire cast, particularly Michael Sheen as Prime Minister, Tony Blair and James Cromwell as Prince Phillip, all did fine performances. Great credit must go to the director, Stephan Frears, as has been mentioned, each well performed scene follow seamlessly and the story itself, screen writer, Peter Morgan managed to capture the feelings of the world at the death of Princess Diana and the apparent lack of compassion from the house of Windsor, specifically Queen Elizabeth.<br /><br />The film also approaches the debated issue whether the Monarchy is an out-dated institution, a thousand year line of monarchs that have ruled Britain and made this little island in the Atlantic, an empire not seen since the height of the Roman Empire. However times change, and since the French Revolution, the concept of Monarchy has been shown to be, at the least, superfluous, not paying tax and living off the people. The Nobility not paying tax was in fact one of the contributing factors in the creation of the French Revolution. If you talk to a social conscious Brit, they are either opposed to the institution and would like to see England become a republic or are true monarchists, conservative and wanting to see the customs and age old traditions continue because they contain values that are relevant even in our so-called modern times. This issue is tastefully explored and leans towards the institution remaining and adapting in our new millennium.<br /><br />We currently live in a world where our deepest fears and private concerns are broadcasted for all to hear and see. It is now fashionable to `wear our hearts on our sleeves' go on a popular talk shows and spill our guts out. This has not always been the case. In an older generation, a truly English attribute, was to not show emotion, keep a stiff upper lip, and carry through any crises with dignity. Queen Elizabeth the II worked as a mechanic during WW II, and was crowned Queen at a young age, and the first prime minister she had to deal with was Winston Churchill. To show `unnecessary' emotion during a time of loss was simply not done, and doing so, showed weakness. This new fashion to display emotion to the masses was beyond the queen's understanding and anathema to everything she represented. The notions of modernism and tradition and our changing sensibilities are the crux of the film.<br /><br />The film's ending gives the audience a clue as to the direction England is heading in terms of tradition and our modern world.<br /><br />Helen Mirren is absolutely Queen Elizabeth the II...almost scary in her portrayal of the monarch...suspending all disbelief, she had me believing she actually was the monarch...Oscar material in the realist sense.<br /><br />Good film.</p></br><a href="../users/ABFOAYZA2UHD3.html">ABFOAYZA2UHD3</a><br/><p>with absolutely amazing helen mirren convincing you she is queen elizabeth.<br /><br />and the dramatization? oh well, when you think back, of course you can never really KNOW what happened, was the prime minister blair really so sleezy, was prince charles really moved for about three seconds after his wife's death (eee, i kinda doubt that cuz i think he's a prick), was mrs blair so full of low breed complexes..<br /><br />but it sure seemed real, thanks to brilliant casting, producition and marvelous performance by the entire cast.<br /><br />what it did for me, it gave me a little bit different insight into princess diana. which i will keep for myself.</p></br><a href="../users/AKT8TGIT6VVZ5.html">AKT8TGIT6VVZ5</a><br/><p>Stephen Frears's "The Queen" is one of the best films of 2006, and undoubtedly among the most intriguing "docudramas" I've been fortunate to come across. It is probably most memorable for Helen Mirren's superb portrayal of Queen Elizabeth II, transforming the icy head of the British royal house of Windsor into a remarkably complex, all too human, individual, dedicated to her outmoded notions of loyalty and duty to both her British subjects and her own dysfunctional royal family. Without question, Mirren has truly made this role into one of the crowning achievements of her superb acting career, and it is an achievement that deserves not only the Academy Award nomination that it has earned, but hopefully, the award itself, along with the awards and other honors she has received already. James Cromwell is almost as impressive too, portraying the dour Prince Phillip,  Duke of Edinburgh (He reacts to the news of Princess Diana's death by taking her young sons on a series of hunting trips on the vast estate of Balmoral Castle, in Scotland, where the royal family is spending the summer of 1997.) and, so is Michael Sheen as the young British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who's been forced unexpectedly to deal with the first major political crisis of his administration, acting adroitly to serve the interests of both the Crown and the realm. Frears does a magnificient job in probing the internal dissent that's rampant in both the Windsor household and the Prime Minister's office in the aftermath of Princess Diana's death and the unexpected public grief expressed by the British public. He skillfully weaves to and fro from the fictional aspects of this docudrama to actual news footage covering Diana's death, public reaction to it, and finally, the public funeral held in London nearly a week after the automobile accident in Paris which claimed the lives of Princess Diana, her lover, and their limousine driver. Much to their credit, director Stephen Frears and writer Paul Morgan have crafted a memorable cinematic tale that treats respectfully both Queen Elizabeth II and Princess Diana, and yet, still manages to yield a truly memorable, quite sympathetic portrayal of the British monarch from Helen Mirren. Even if you're unfamiliar with the United Kingdom's government or its royal family, you'll still find much to be savored from this fascinating portrait of the House of Windsor and Prime Minister Tony Blair. Not only is "The Queen" among the best films of 2006, but it is also among the most memorable I have enjoyed watching in recent memory.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DAOL3NMHEPLS.html">A1DAOL3NMHEPLS</a><br/><p>A beautifully produced reconstruction of events during the week following Diana Spencer's unexpected death: the public mourning, the Royal Family's cluelessness, and Tony Blair's attempts to curry favor with all involved. Helen Mirren deservedly won the 2006 Oscar for best performance by an actress, and the rest of the cast turns in creditable performances as well. I'd give this 4.5 stars if that were allowed.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>Helen Mirren's performance as Queen Elizabeth II is as finely nuanced a performance as you are likely to see in a motion picture.  "The Queen" who suffers the woeful ignorance regarding protocol of her new prime minister, Tony Blair (Michael Sheen,) at Buckingham Palace is not the same woman we see with her family is their retreat at Balmoral any more than that is the same woman who jumps into her old jeep and takes off on her own at the family's Scottish estate.  But the point is that they are the same woman and while the differences between those facets might be ones of minute degree, Mirren has captured them exquisitely, which is why she is now the greatest favorite to win the Oscar in the history of handicapping the Academy Awards.<br /><br />Written by Peter Morgan (whose "The Last King of Scotland" is probably going to win the Oscar for Best Actor) and directed by Stephen Frears ("Dangerous Liaisons"), this 2006 nominee for Best Picture is primarily about the week following the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, in 1997.  For the Queen the death of Diana is a private matter and the fact that Diana was no longer an HRH dictates the crown say nothing even more than a desire not to feed the media frenzy that played a role in her death.  But for Blair (with the help of his speech writer), Diana is the "People's Princess," and he can see the threat to the monarchy by the Queen's silence in the face of this national tragedy even if her majesty cannot.  It is the middle class Blair, the first Labour PM in a generation, who has to persuade Elizabeth that her traditional quiet dignity, which has served her so well for a half century as Queen of England, is woefully inadequate to the moment at hand.<br /><br />The flaws of the film are not questions of movie making but exist because of fidelity to the events of that week.  In the immediate wake of Diana's death the paparazzi who relentlessly pursued her are vilified, but when the tabloid rags that paid for all those photographs of the princess turn the growing wrath of the public away from themselves and onto the royal family nobody calls them on their self-serving interests.  If Elizabeth, Charles and the rest of the family thought it was wrong to take the young princes away from Balmoral and back to the circus in London it is hard to fault them for their logic (if they had been at Buckingham palace they might have fled to Balmoral anyhow).  The whole point about lowering a flag that is only flown when the monarch is in residence, a tradition followed for four hundred years, still bothers me.  The flag was not lowered to half-mast for Queen Victoria or Winston Churchill, so the idea that it should be lowered for anybody still strikes me as being wrong.  Still, "The Queen" makes it clear that if there had been more from the monarch early on, there would have been less required as a public "mea culpa" later.<br /><br />For me the villain of the piece is Blair's wife, Cherie (Helen McCrory), who grins idiotically when performing a "shallow" curtsey in the presence of the Queen and takes glee in what is happening to the monarchy.  It takes most of the film, but eventually it is Blair himself who has to articulate why the woman sitting on the throne deserves respect if not loyalty.  I doubt that most Americans even know of the young Elizabeth Windsor who was an auto mechanic during World War II, when she and her mother and sister stayed in London during the Blitz, while thousands of other young children were being sent out of town (as see in the opening of "The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe").  Those of us who know of how Fate intervened to put this woman on the throne can only look at Cherie Blair and observe that Elizabeth did more for her country as a teenager than the prime minister's wife has done in her entire life.<br /><br />It is interesting to see how the funeral itself is reduced to almost an epilogue, although there is still a key scene to come afterwards.  Although it seem to be on point the moment where Elizabeth and the royal family stood at the gate of Buckingham palace and bowed their heads is omitted, as are such memorable moments as Elton John singing a new version of "Candle in the Wind" or the card to "Mummy" that Harry put on his mother's coffin.  For this film all that matters is that the Queen sits in Westminster and listens to Diana's brother laud his dead sister, extolling her as true royalty, because even once she gets her wake up call, the Queen has to have her nosed rubbed in it one more time.  Mirren's Elizabeth might be wrong in her reaction to the death of Diana, but once again the fault lies with Fate and not with the heart of a queen who has served her subjects the way she was taught long ago and once upon a time when she had been the princess of her people.<br /><br />Mirren must be looking forward to Oscar night when she will only have to give one acceptance speech rather than two, since at both the Golden Globes and the Screen Actors Guild Awards she won not only the top actress award for a movie for "The Queen" but also for her performance in "Elizabeth I" on television.  I have no doubt that each performance enhances the other in the minds of voters since the two Elizabeths certainly evince the range of Mirren's acting abilities (and both have her delivering speeches actually given by each monarch, which appeals to me as a rhetorician).  Mirren's acceptance speeches to date have been exemplary in being short and to the point, suggesting that some of the gravitas of her character may well have rubbed off on her.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL.html">A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL</a><br/><p>`The Queen' primarily looks behind the scenes of Buckingham Palace during the crisis of Princess Diana's death.  It is an illuminating and comprehensive affair that focuses mainly on the detachment of the Royal family in a time of national grieving.  Like many recent pieces of historical fiction, `The Queen,' wisely uses ample footage from real videotape.  Diana's death, Britain's mourning, and newscasts intersperse the drama.  This works well, and, while some of the screenplay is speculative, they nearly get all of it right.  Peter Morgan is a dead ringer as Prime Minister, Blair, and Helen Mirren is more than reminiscent of Elizabeth II.  Their rendering of Prince Charles (Alex Jennings) is a bullseye.  My only complaint is that, although we see plenty of The Queen's underbelly, her hard-boiled shell is mostly glossed over.  Elizabeth II has shown her vulnerability, but she can be much more indomitable than the drama suggests.  Perhaps this is presented because they couldn't go too far with this drama.  They understandably do try to be fair to the current monarch, even though they present her as grieving more over a slain stag than over any endearment to her estranged daughter-in-law's death.  Her grief is at her own perceived tarnished crown.  The funeral for her is a private affair.  And, here, Blair, who was in tune with the people, properly perceived the Royal Family would miss out on an opportunity to heal the nation.  He really has the dilemma, for he must balance the forces of those who wish to keep the Royal Family dignified and those who call to have their monarchy eliminated.  He draws from the sentiment of the people and properly eulogizes Diana's death, but balances becoming a laison for an institution he prudently realizes will never be put to death anytime soon.<br /><br />Besides "great performances" the big draw should be taking in the subplot.  The scenes of Princess Di's private interviews, key scenes in her life, and the aftermath of her death provide the most poignant moments.  This isn't her movie, however, and it should be judged by the terms it was created.  The Queen's perspective brings about its own merits.  For who will not be struck about the state of affairs of England by looking upon the turmoil of the UK's most revered institution when it seems to remain aloof and stoic under the calamity of a competing fallen icon.  Although they prudently only present the suspect aspects that brought Diana's death, the whole picture becomes a fascinating composite of tragedy and regal isolation.</p></br><a href="../users/A9I40WFF40R4.html">A9I40WFF40R4</a><br/><p>Stephen Fears follows one "A" movie "Mrs. Henderson Presents" with yet another of the same quality, "The Queen." Most of the film has to do with the week or so after the untimely death of Princess Diana and the royal family's reaction to it and their totally misjudging the public's reaction. Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip, because of their icy stoicism and, more importantly, their total distaste for the princess, were all set to stay at Balmoral, ignore the press, make no public statement, have a small private funeral and let Prince Philip take Princess Diana's sons hunting to divert them from their sorrow. The royal couple, as the whole world now knows, got their comeuppance, and at the eleventh hour, managed to do the right thing but not without the help of a very determined Tony Blair.<br /><br />The acting is excellent with only the Queen Mother being miscast. Dame Helen Mirren convinces you she is the queen; both Prince Philip and Prince Charles are believable; and Michael Sheen gives an outstanding performance as Prime Minister Tony Blair ("Just call me 'Tony'"). The movie belongs just as much to the prime minister as to the queen. There is a scene near the end of the film when Blair has an audience with Queen Elizabeth and she reminds him of the fickleness of the public. We are reminded, rather sadly, that he bought into a war that ultimately cost him his position.<br /><br />Although Fears of course covers the death and funeral of Princess Diana ("the people's Princess"), he does it with grace and respect and never  exploits the sad events. For example, her sons never speak nor are seen closeup. Additionally the actual footage of events at the time is so well integrated with the rest of the movie so that the two are indistinguishable, no small feat on the part of both the director and cinemaphotographer.<br /><br />The critics are already talking about an Oscar nomination for Mirren. She richly deserves one.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TWTULVD6F22O.html">A1TWTULVD6F22O</a><br/><p>"The Queen"  is, far and away, Stephen Frears' best film to date.  That's saying a lot since his "Dangerous Liasions" is one of my favorite films of all time.  While "Dangerous Liasions" is about power and cruelty,  The Queen allows you a glimpse behind the scenes of power, and illustrates that everyone, no matter how famous or how powerful, stumbles a little in life, and fortunately has a person or persons around them  that save them from themselves.<br /><br />A study in contrasts of style and substance is the theme of the film -- the events that brought together Queen Elizabeth II (Helen Mirren) and her new Prime Minister, Tony Blair (Michael Sheen).  Had it not been for the sudden, almost inexplicable death of the tragic Princess Diana, followed by the schism in terms of reaction between her people and the Queen, Elizabeth and Tony may have taken years to get comfortable with one another, years to understand each other, years to forge the kind of relationship that works for the UK.<br /><br />These two actors are brilliant in their roles.  Mirren goes beyond the traditional caricature of the Queen as stodgy, opinionated, and totally in control/disdain of her family members' lives and foibles.  She gives us the Queen as an extraordinary woman made humble by events she did not create and could not fathom.  Her reaction to them, her eventual awareness and response, is, for lack of a better word, queenly.  Mirren, the redoubtable Jane Tennyson of the brilliant "Prime Suspect" series, is the best actress of her time (yes, Meryl Streep, that includes you).  Michael Sheen, on the other hand, may not portray Tony Blair as he really is (how would I know?) but the contrast of his coltish, disarming charm and his leadership style at the beginning of his term as Prime Minister (and the obvious affection from staff and family,  for his ability to be real, to be the kind of leader that one would follow into hell )  to his growing confidence that he can, by the truth of his understanding and  his willingness to continue to persevere, to bring the tragedy from the brink, all of it is captured in his performance.<br /><br />Frears benefits from a brilliant script by Peter Morgan, but turns the script into an extraordinary film by the perfection of his choices and his editing.  He chooses to recreate scenes that have never been filmed (the crowd in front of the hotel before Diana emerged to her car and her subsequent death the scene of Charles arriving at the hospital) and mixes them with real film clips of Diana in life, and some of the real film of the funeral events.  Choosing NOT to recreate Diana with an actress was sheer genius, and the mix of clips and live action was incredibly well done.  Mixing the filmmaker's/writer's interpretation of what must have happened in the series of entreating phone calls between Blair and the Queen, making both vulnerable by showing little shots of daily life -- the cozy, contemporary chaos of the Blair house, the deliberacy of the Queen taking off and putting on her glasses, tells the story of how the power shifted between them (perhaps?) in a way that not even his fine actors could do.  Choosing  a breathtaking but not imposing score for the film and making the shots of Balmoral ( the almost forbidding surroundings) come to life as the barrier between the Queen and her people...well, Frear has taken what could be an ordinary, dull film about a living monarch to the realms of an incredible character study, played out against a backdrop that stands stark in the memory of people all over the world.<br /><br />Was the crown really endangered by Elizabeth's reaction to the tragedy?  Did she change her stance because of the leverage of Blair's campaign, his truth?  Is Frears film opinion, or is it reality?  Somewhere in the middle?  It matters not.  It's unique, it's powerful, it's a shame that it won't be viewed in wider release, because it is the best film, so far, this year.</p></br><a href="../users/AS28WVBBZ3G99.html">AS28WVBBZ3G99</a><br/><p>Commenting on "The Queen" is a bit like daring to touch the Mona Lisa - there is little that might be done to improve it and much that would not.<br /><br />Helen Mirren is brilliant. She conveys a sense of that regal place, owned by  ruling monarchs, of tension between service and leadership - modernity and tradition - privacy and publicity. "The Queen" is a picture of paradox: a woman wholly-sacrificed for her people and a people willingly sacrificed for their sovereign. Mirren captures the paradoxes of the servant (whomever would be the greatest must be the servant of all) so beautifully and stoically.<br /><br />In our world, some arrive at their life's positions by talent, some by hard work, others by luck. But the Queen of England is thrust into her world and her position by divine Providence. And for us mere mortals, Mirren's performance is all that.</p></br><a href="../users/A38YUU4J5Q4EJO.html">A38YUU4J5Q4EJO</a><br/><p>Always having been fascinated by the Royals, (especially Princess Dianna)<br /><br />I really enjoyed this movie.<br /><br />It is centered at the time that the Princess died, and the Queen came under such negative scrutiny for her lack of emotion, and her failure to make a public statement about her death.<br /><br />Although I am not saying that the Queen was right in her silence, I DO now have a clearer understanding of Royal tradition,and protocol. I now understand her silence a little better.<br /><br />Even though the Queen clearly did not like her ex Daughter-in-Law, It still was/is not customary to show one's feelings in public in the Royal family.<br /><br />Viewing this film brought the period of Diana's death back like it was yesterday, and I liked how they added live footage of her throughout the film.Like millions of others, I admired the Princess, and will watch this film many times to come.<br /><br />Also, I now have a new respect for the Queen. This really is a wonderful movie!</p></br><a href="../users/A3MQ672FYFNM7B.html">A3MQ672FYFNM7B</a><br/><p>I went to see this movie because I was a huge Princess Diana fan. When she was tragically killed it hit me (just like millions and millions of people around the world) very hard. She was so beautiful on the outside and on the inside. She was also very unique, because (perhaps?) she was the only member of this crazy family, the royals that had a heart and soul.<br /><br />"The Queen" stars legendary veteran actress Helen Mirren who plays the title role. "The Queen" deals with both the public's reaction to Princess Diana's tragic death, as well as the Queen's/royal family's cold and unsympathetic feelings towards this tragedy.<br /><br />I am not sure if the producers of "The Queen" were trying to shed a positive light on Queen Elizabeth? If they were though, it would have been nice if they would have discussed her life in greater detail so the viewers could gain a better understanding in to this complex individual.<br /><br />But after watching this picture I really believe that the Queen is a very cold person. She is more interested in what the press has to say about her and her family, but she is never seen comforting her grandchildren or even talking to them!<br /><br />Helen Mirren's portrayal of the Queen was really scary because she looked just like her! I have no idea how the Queen behaves in private but I can only suspect that Helen Mirren was really on the money because she acted just the way most people would probably expect the Queen to behave.<br /><br />Michael Sheen played the newly elected Tony Blair. Did anyone else find it odd that a prime minister of one of the richest countries in the world was portrayed as a desperately middle-class man in a very middle-class home? I found that very unrealistic.<br /><br />Tony Blair tried to evoke some type of humanity into the Queen after it was apparent to the British people that she did not give a hoot about poor Princess Diana. He even acted as publicity agent, spinning stories about the Queen's departure from London and tight-lipped stance. It seemed that he was trying to play both sides of the fence though, although he did win much brownie points for his involvement during this tragic time in British history.<br /><br />I found the performance of Helen McCrory (playing Mrs. Cherie Blair) to be top-notch as well. She was very comical in many scenes (her curtsey to the Queen was so different), and she also lent a little bit of realism to this picture. Because as Cherie described, the Queen and her entire family are a bunch of emotionally retarded people.<br /><br />Princess Diana was the most famous women in the world. Is that why the Windsors disliked her? I can only suspect that the reasons why the public (and the world, alike) loved her so much were the same reasons why the royal family detested her. Such a shame...</p></br><a href="../users/ASEBX8TBYWQWA.html">ASEBX8TBYWQWA</a><br/><p>There is one main reason to see this film: HELEN MIRREN! She's fabulous! I missed it in the theaters but it plays beautifully on a home screen - even my 27 inch one. The wide screen is not as wide as many others and so the picture shows up well.<br /><br />Especially for baby boomers who remember watching the young Elizabeth being crowed Queen on a small black and white TV set in the early 1950s, this film shows us the mature and intelligent and yet cold looking monarch that she is. As we learn in the short 17-minute "making of" documentary, it was not Direct Frears concern that the actors playing Tony Blair and Prince Charles actually look or sound like the real characters. At first you miss Charles large ears but pretty soon you hear what is a good characterization of his voice.<br /><br />On the surface this is a story of the tragic death of Princess Diana but, below that surface is the story of what it is like to be raised in a Palace and be cut off from the modern world.<br /><br />There are two commentary tracks as well. One is by Direct Stephen Frears and talks about the making of the film. The other is by a British Historian who discusses the making of a Monarchy and Royal customs.<br /><br />Most of all, however you will remember the great performance of Helen Mirren.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br /><br />"Anything Phonographic"</p></br><a href="../users/A22RY8N8CNDF3A.html">A22RY8N8CNDF3A</a><br/><p>"The Queen" begins with the newly elected P.M.

The result is a dangerous loss of support for the monarchy.<br /><br />Tony Blair takes the initiative and steadily and skillfully prods the Queen towards a public demonstration of grief, and she finally complies - bringing the Queen and the people closer together.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ.html">A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ</a><br/><p>The British royal family has weathered abdications, wars, and scandal. But one of the nastiest hits to them in the twentieth century came when Princess Di was killed.<br /><br />And so "The Queen" tries to get inside the perfectly-permed head of the British Queen Elizabeth II, nearly ten years ago. Helen Mirren gives an Oscar-worthy performance as the title character, as she attempts to weather public and personal difficulties. Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown.<br /><br />The movie opens with the election of Tony Blair (Michael Sheen), who comes to visit the queen (Mirren), despite being rather nervous about his new job. The country has been off balance ever since Di died in a car crash a few weeks ago, and her passing leaves the royals with mixed feelings. The queen decrees that since Diana divorced Prince Charles, she was no longer a royal, and her arrangements are to be left to her family.<br /><br />What she doesn't realize is that the people ADORED Diana, and continue to adore her in the weeks that follow. Then the press joins in, berating the royal family for coldly ignoring the ex-princess, and heralding the Labour Party Blair. Her husband and mother think that she should continue doing nothing -- but the Queen has learned that sometimes the people need to be appeased.<br /><br />"The Queen" unfolds slowly like an old book, and Stephen Frears gives it the dignified gloss that usually belongs to older movies. Scenes that could have been maudlin or cliche are underplayed, which makes them more powerful. One example is of the queen peering in as Charles tells his young sons that their mother has died.<br /><br />Fortunately, as in real life, there's also comedy as well as confusion and tragedy; Peter Morgan injects some humor when a nervy Blair meets the Queen for the first time. Morgan also spins u[ the kind of dialogue we can imagine the droll Elizabeth or prickly Prince Philip saying ("Sleeping in the streets and pulling out their hair for someone they never knew. And they think WE'RE mad!").<br /><br />Mirren doesn't normally look much like Elizabeth II. She's younger, taller, and prettier. But with some padding and makeup, she manages to BECOME Elizabeth II. She's dignified, haughty, yet Mirren manages to bring across that she's bewildered and vulnerable as well. In short, she makes her version of Elizabeth II a person.<br /><br />She's also backed by magnificent performances by Sheen and James Cromwell. Cromwell is excellent as the crotchety, stubborn Prince Philip, who thinks the best way to deal with grief is to go hunting. And Sheen is very good as the Prime Minister who is just starting his work, and who gains a new perspective on the royals.<br /><br />"The Queen" is a unique, quietly compelling film, as it explores what might have happened within the royal family -- and the person that Queen Elizabeth might be, underneath the royal mask.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EOLRV216BXJ9.html">A1EOLRV216BXJ9</a><br/><p>Perspective changes with time. Now I can empathsize the Queen. To issue an immediate statement after Princess Diana's death would be irresponsible, an act more suited for a populist cum politician. To be able to stick to her principles (even as it may be out-dated), reflect upon the escalating crisis and do the only thing (not necessarliy the right thing) left to do for the monarchy makes Queen Elizabeth II a truly outstanding soverign. Such is the wonderful script which makes the movie  thought-provoking, warm and intriguing.<br /><br />Helen Mirren is brilliant in her portrayal of the Queen. I especially like her subtlety, her "stubborness" without offending anyone. Instead, she has my complete sympathy. The movie is shot in such a beautiful countryside and full of metaphor. The Queen love the dogs, the deer and may very well be more at ease displaying her emotions toward the animals than towards people. The dialogues may be far from what actually happened but the Queen's personality is wonderfully portrayed.<br /><br />This is really a film that has done justice to the royal family and provides a refreshing angle towards the historical event of Princess Diana's death.

Queen Elizabeth II is not exactly a figure who generates anything but a response of boredom, so flat and uninteresting is her persona.  But enter Helen Mirren, one of the finest actresses on the screen today, and this potentially boring potentate becomes a vibrantly detailed and fascinating portrait of a queen at odds with the times.  It is a staggering achievement.<br /><br />Director Stephen Frears, using a superb script by Peter Morgan, details the time from the election of Labor Party Prime Minister Tony Blair (a brilliant Michael Sheen) to that momentous international outpouring of grief and love that followed the tragic death of Princess Di in 1997, showing the bifurcation of response between the Royals and the People as represented by Blair.  Instead of the insensitive cold figure that the world witnessed as QE II, Mirren shows us that the woman who is Queen actually had feelings for her grandchildren, a respect for her station as royalty,  and was gradually responsive to the cry of the people via Blair's influence, allowing the world to pay proper tribute to a heroine.  The ogres in the Balmoral Castle were in fact Prince Phillip (James Cromwell) and the Queen Mum (Sylvia Syms) abetted by the very proper Robin Janvrin (Roger Allam) and the wishy washy Prince Charles (Alex Jennings).<br /><br />The entire production is beautifully filmed with the use of clips from Princess Di's life (and death) instead of creating an actress role to portray her - a very wise choice.  The musical score by Alexandre Desplat is superb (with a little help from Verdi's 'Libera Me' as sung by Lynn Dawson and the BBC chorus for the funeral portion).  But indeed the accolades go to Helen Mirren in an Oscar worthy performance - with the very strong counterbalance by Michael Sheen.  An excellent film about a moment no one will ever forget.  Grady Harp, October 06</p></br><a href="../users/A1AYN3IIUNQCIA.html">A1AYN3IIUNQCIA</a><br/><p>2006 will always be remembered as Helen Mirren's year. after years of being under the radar in great shows like Prime Suspect and movies like The Madness of King George and Gosford Park, Mirren finally roared onto the spot light not only playing one Queen Elizabeth but TWO Queen Elizabeths. first, she scored by playing the original Queen Elizabth in HBO's Elizabth 1 and then she scored again by playing Queen Elizabth 2 in this film, The Queen. the film follows the week after the terrible death of Princess Diana and the seemingly cold response the royal family gives to the death. through it all, Elizabeth 2 keeps her compsure not to buckle under the command while the Prime Minister grows restless over it all. some people have complained that the Queen is one big bore and i have to dissagree, i felt this movie was incredibally great and fully kept me engrossed in the picture. but the real reason i loved the film was Helen, she absolutly radiats as our conflicted queen, not only from the appearence but from her facial expressions, speech, and at just the right moment a bit of compassion. She definently deserved the Oscar, no doubt about it and hopefully now she will finally be reconized for her outstanding talent. to quote from Helen's Oscar speech "Ladies and gentlemen, i give you the queen!"</p></br><a href="../users/A3NL1KW56O3JR8.html">A3NL1KW56O3JR8</a><br/><p>First off: I can see why Helen Mirren won the Oscar; her performance was excellent. The rest of the movie, however, was a bit lacking by comparison.<br /><br />Maybe it's because I'm an American or because I never understood the fascination with Princess Diana, but I found the film a touch dull overall. Sure, there were some great moments, like with Queen Elizabeth in from of Buckingham Palace but there are long stretches in-between. Still, it was an interesting character study; I especially liked the interplay between the Queen and Tony Blair. (I found it strange, however, that the young princes were not portrayed in the film...)<br /><br />This is a good movie over-all. Defiantly rent it. "Movie of the Year," however? I think not.</p></br><a href="../users/A18IK6YI6T3RK2.html">A18IK6YI6T3RK2</a><br/><p>Helen Mirren is a revolation in this movie, she channels the Queen, it's uncanny how well she nails her.  As for the movie..I enjoyed it, it had a nice pace and the performances, particularly Cromwell as the neanderthal Phillip and the actor who played Tony Blair, but it is Mirren who elevates this movie, she is reviting.  I appreciated the way the director used real stock footage along with newly shot stage pieces; very well done.  If there is one off note performance it was the simpering, pathetic Charles, I just dont see him as being such a dolt.  The real Charles has bucked his mother in the past, and is passionate to a fault on subjects close to his heart, like the environment and modern architecture, the way he is portrayed here, is a cowering wimp, whining and hand wringing, I just did not see that during the time of Diana's death, I thought Charles showed dignity and respectful deferance to his mother, afterall, she is the Queen, not some simpering fool, who is afraid of his mother.  Anyway, all and all, good film..great lead performance: very well earned Acadamy Award, if for the stag sceen alone.</p></br><a href="../users/A1YB29BIDULEYE.html">A1YB29BIDULEYE</a><br/><p>This is another depressing, yet phenomenal film.<br /><br />Very quickly, you really need to see this film with hindsight to appreciate it fully.<br /><br />The film begins with Tony Blair's rise to power. And we can see that Tony's wife does not think much of the queen. (Her translation of the queen's words would probably not be allowed here!)<br /><br />From here, we see Dianne's fatal accident, and while the queen acknowledges the tragedy, Prince Charles is the only one who feels that Dianne has to be treated with royal respect even though she is an X princess.)<br /><br />The major plot of this movie is that the royal family has an unprecedented circumstance here. The death of an X princess who was popular. Add to that that Tony Blair is just settling in, and he knows that certain parties are wondering as to the usefulness of the monarchy. (So things are unstable.)<br /><br />Without going on for too long, her majesty Queen Elizabeth II has legitimate reasons to dislike Dianne. And to complicate things further, she tries to gain control of the situation the way she has in the past. (Remaining unaffected.)<br /><br />Prince Charles receives gentle treatment in this film. He seems to know 2 major things. (1) For the monarch to survive, it must be willing to be flexible with the times. (2) Even more important, unlike his mother, Charles is aware that the Dianne they knew is NOT the Dianne the majority of people knew.<br /><br />While the movie is called "The Queen," one could easily argue that the true star is Tony Blair. He's a competent young Prime Minister who agrees with progression, but he also has a respect for traditions as well as the monarchy. While his wife is anti monarchist, Tony knows that England has a need for the monarchy and they (for the most part) want the monarchy: "Spare me the 'off with their heads' routine."<br /><br />At one point, Tony has to (with some regret) 'strong arm' the Queen to take required action about Dianne. Perhaps the most moving point in this film is when after doing this difficult action, Tony Blair faces down the hostile press and explains that Queen Elizabeth II never wanted this job, that she watched it kill her father King George VI, and that she did the job she never wanted with dignity and grace for almost 50 years.<br /><br />Tony also reminds the 'wicked press' that Dianne: "...threw everything the queen offered back in her face, and for the past few years dedicated her life 24/7 to destroying everything the queen held dear."<br /><br />Keeping this final and climactic speech of Tony Blair in mind, makes watching this film a 2nd time all the more interesting.<br /><br />If you are a fan of English History, you MUST have this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2QHM5HBSIXRL4.html">A2QHM5HBSIXRL4</a><br/><p>Helen Mirren is getting the requisite kudos for her portrayal of Queen Elizabeth.  But there's another portrayal in Stephen Frears' excellent film of an equally public figure that is going relatively overlooked: Michael Sheen's spot-on take on Tony Blair.  I was totally mesmerized at just how perfectly Sheen had both the look and feel of the unbridled optimism of TB at the outset of his first term.  That's key because it's Blair's intuition on  the matters at hand here that are instrumental in shaking the Royal Family out of their tone-deaf dismissal of the unfolding events across the country.<br /><br />It's interesting to see the portrayals here and see how harsh or sympathetic they are (Mirren's Elizabeth is complex and beyond analysis here):<br /><br />Prince Philip - A devastating take on him<br /><br />Price Charles - Painted very sympathetically by Alex Jennings, but obviously cowed by his mother<br /><br />Alastair Campbell - A very positive take on New Labour's wordsmith by Mark Bazeley (I'm a big Campbell fan, so it was good to see the script honor his contributions to Blair's early successes).<br /><br />Queen Mom - Yikes!  Not a very pretty picture<br /><br />Frears' delicate and respectful approach keeps William and Harry just off the picture.<br /><br />What will really take you about the movie is this: as many reviewers here note, they found themselves strangely moved and shocked by Diana's death, like she was a member of the family.  When those scenes play out here, wow, you'll be quite surprised at the emotions that well up in you.  It will happen.  Trust me.<br /><br />Frears - as pitch-perfect movie helmsman - includes the stirring end portion of the eulogy penned and intoned by Charles, Earl of Spencer (Diana's brother).  Spencer's speech is generally regarded as one of the finest eulogies ever rendered.  It has become a part of British textbooks.  Here's the part you hear in the movie:<br /><br />"I would like to end by thanking God for the small mercies he has shown us at this dreadful time. For taking Diana at her most beautiful and radiant and when she had joy in her private life. Above all we give thanks for the life of a woman I am so proud to be able to call my sister, the unique, the complex, the extraordinary and irreplaceable Diana whose beauty, both internal and external, will never be extinguished from our minds."<br /><br />That will send a chill up your spine when you see it in the theater.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ.html">A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ</a><br/><p>The British royal family has weathered abdications, wars, and scandal. But one of the nastiest hits to them in the twentieth century came when Princess Di was killed.<br /><br />And so "The Queen" tries to get inside the perfectly-permed head of the British Queen Elizabeth II, nearly ten years ago. Helen Mirren gives an Oscar-worthy performance as the title character, as she attempts to weather public and personal difficulties. Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown.<br /><br />The movie opens with the election of Tony Blair (Michael Sheen), who comes to visit the queen (Mirren), despite being rather nervous about his new job. The country has been off balance ever since Di died in a car crash a few weeks ago, and her passing leaves the royals with mixed feelings. The queen decrees that since Diana divorced Prince Charles, she was no longer a royal, and her arrangements are to be left to her family.<br /><br />What she doesn't realize is that the people ADORED Diana, and continue to adore her in the weeks that follow. Then the press joins in, berating the royal family for coldly ignoring the ex-princess, and heralding the Labour Party Blair. Her husband and mother think that she should continue doing nothing -- but the Queen has learned that sometimes the people need to be appeased.<br /><br />"The Queen" unfolds slowly like an old book, and Stephen Frears gives it the dignified gloss that usually belongs to older movies. Scenes that could have been maudlin or cliche are underplayed, which makes them more powerful. One example is of the queen peering in as Charles tells his young sons that their mother has died.<br /><br />Fortunately, as in real life, there's also comedy as well as confusion and tragedy; Peter Morgan injects some humor when a nervy Blair meets the Queen for the first time. Morgan also spins u[ the kind of dialogue we can imagine the droll Elizabeth or prickly Prince Philip saying ("Sleeping in the streets and pulling out their hair for someone they never knew. And they think WE'RE mad!").<br /><br />Mirren doesn't normally look much like Elizabeth II. She's younger, taller, and prettier. But with some padding and makeup, she manages to BECOME Elizabeth II. She's dignified, haughty, yet Mirren manages to bring across that she's bewildered and vulnerable as well. In short, she makes her version of Elizabeth II a person.<br /><br />She's also backed by magnificent performances by Sheen and James Cromwell. Cromwell is excellent as the crotchety, stubborn Prince Philip, who thinks the best way to deal with grief is to go hunting. And Sheen is very good as the Prime Minister who is just starting his work, and who gains a new perspective on the royals.<br /><br />"The Queen" is a unique, quietly compelling film, as it explores what might have happened within the royal family -- and the person that Queen Elizabeth might be, underneath the royal mask.</p></br><a href="../users/AUEHG0DB54B7K.html">AUEHG0DB54B7K</a><br/><p>There has been a wide discussion of the story of the film so I will not go into a lot of detail in that regard.  The Queen is a well acted, thought provoking film.  I cannot comment on what might have been left out, was invented or compressed to tell the story of the Royal family in the aftermath of the death of Princess Diana but what we do see rings true with the information that is generally known.  The performance by Helen Mirren is Oscar caliber; my test for a performance is how convinced I am that the actor has become the role and Ms. Mirren is Queen Elizabeth II.  Indeed, the entire cast is superb.  Michael Sheen is terrific as Tony Blair and expresses a good range of emotion dealing sternly with his staff, diplomatically with the Queen and coping with family life.  James Cromwell is also good as Prince Philip exhibiting perhaps the ultimate stiff upper lip attitude of the English upper class. Equally good is Sylvia Syms as the Queen Mother, who is most concerned, so it seems that Diana's public funeral is being based off her own.  Alex Jennings makes an interesting Prince Charles; although he does not look a lot like Charles he worked into his performance the Prince's mannerisms<br /><br />The audience is treated to what amounts to the daily life of the Queen on summer holiday at the family estate at Balmoral.  This otherwise peaceful retreat is interrupted by the death of Princess Diana on August 30, 1997 and becomes a chronological telling of the events that occurs up to her funeral.  The film does not take a point-of-view and does not present very much about Princess Diana other than glimpses of her public life, which allows us to focus on how the Royal family dealt with her death.  It is going on ten years since the events depicted in the film occurred giving all of us a better perspective on what happened.  At the time, the Royal family came under harsh criticism for their perceived lack of reaction to Princess Diana's death; this film provides all sides and allows us to better understand the Queen and her reaction first to the death of the princess and then to the criticism of her conduct.<br /><br />The episode of the stag in the film is one of the events that may be fictional but it serves to remind us that Princess Diana, like the stag, was hunted for her beauty.  The Queen makes this connection in the film and so her attempt to shoo the animal away when she encounters it and her quiet sorrow when he is killed.  I think that one comes away with a better understanding of Queen Elizabeth, and one can see the influence of past generations - that of her grandmother Queen Mary - in her attitude toward the public life that she inherited from her father.  The Queen is a thought provoking film that needs to be seen.</p></br><a href="../users/A8S11VP9Z36D6.html">A8S11VP9Z36D6</a><br/><p>I was not excited to view this film, but found myself getting slowly caught up in the fascinating story spun around the week of events after Princess Diana's death. Rather than taking the easy road and making Queen Elizabeth and the Royal Monarchy a target, this film chose to show both the new (Tony Blair) and the old (The Queen) in a fairly impartial light. It is much more interesting to see how both sides learn and grow from each other by being willing to communicate and learn in what must have been an extremely difficult situation. Helen Mirren gives a miraculous performance and actually appears to be channeling Her Royal Highness. As Philip, James Cromwell portrays one of the few characters in this film who is thoroughly unlikeable. As Charles, Alex Jennings gives the portrayal of a Prince who has spent his life in a state of limbo, and seems to be ineffective both as a Royal Leader as well as a leader in his own home. Beautiful story, well written, and stunning performances, not to mention visual perfection. Get this film!</p></br><a href="../users/A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ.html">A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ</a><br/><p>The mood of this film is very careful, reverent, and poised, much like Helen Mirren's Queen Elizabeth II. It plays out patiently over a very emotional issue for many people around the world: the death of Princess Diana and the reaction of the English monarchy.<br /><br />Peter Morgan's script does an excellent job of presenting all sides of an historical moment. It never feels as if he's trying to garner sympathy for any parties involved. We see the queen trying to deal with the situation in the way that she sees fit: the most traditional, nonreactionary, unemotional way. We see Tony Blair trying to convince her that this is not the proper way to proceed. We see the public's reaction to Diana's death.<br /><br />What struck me the most about the film was how the power of the media was displayed. In numerous scenes, the prime minister is shown scanning the headlines for the public's reactions. The queen is shown watching news reports of people's reactions. When Tony Blair attempts to side with the Queen slightly and help her the newspapers don't report it, they continue to report the queen's lack of action. To me, this brought into the equation the very real idea that while the government may rule, the media can decide what to say about events, and therefore effect public opinion in a much more direct way.<br /><br />This film moves slowly, but is never boring. It definitely opens up many topics of conversation. This was a very well thought out and executed film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3P9D22KDEXVMN.html">A3P9D22KDEXVMN</a><br/><p>This is an absolutely enthralloing movie with superb acting.  The movie depicts very human people in practically impossible circumstances.  Like any other public figures, the Royal Family is subject to incredibly intense scrutiny.  The need to balance their obvious disdain for Princess Diana, with the need to put on a grieving face for the Nation and world was clearly very difficult.  The Oscar that Mirren won was very well-deserved.  She is simply phenomenal in this movie.  I had to remind myself on numerous occasions that I was watching a movie and not peeking into the private lives of the actual parties involved.<br /><br />Tony Blair was also depicted in a heroic sense in that he allowed the Queen to succeed in a very difficult time while he played puppet master in the background.  Excellent acting, excellent story, and an overall excellent movie.  This is a movie not to be missed.  5 solid stars!</p></br><a href="../users/A2RFG9LI7JDILS.html">A2RFG9LI7JDILS</a><br/><p>Helen mirren gives a great performance as many have already stated.. What i find the most interesting is the tension between the classes in great britain.. On the one hand the country is so very modern.. on the other hand it feels like it is still clinging to the last remnants of tradition..  At the center of this lies elizabeth who must reconcile her private concerns for upholding her dignified historical position with her realization that things are changing... As much as i detest people who are handed everything in life.. mirren's deeply felt performance makes the queen's position very real and identifiable.. while i will never feel sorry for the aristocracy in any shape or form (yes it exists in the u.s. to they just call it something other than aristocracy) i can still find their position very interesting to examine.. and that is precisely what this movie does.</p></br><a href="../users/A345WVAVMMO6F0.html">A345WVAVMMO6F0</a><br/><p>i am not a fan of the hanoversaxecoburggothawindsormountbatten family, but putting my political opinions aside, this is a fine and objective view of queen elizabeth II in the days surrounding the death of her ex-daughter-in-law diana.  faced with a public that chose to view a silly vapid little twit as some sort of beloved martyr, the queen was caught up in a sense of the world that had left her and the rest of her family behind.  the movie is a salute to a woman who managed to run a stall action, delaying the inevitable end of a monarchy thats only purpose in the world of the 21st century is to provide a tourist attraction.  the entire cast does wonders, esp of course helen mirren in her justifiably praised role as elizabeth, with a special nod as well to janes cromwell as the queens toady philip mountbatten.  and of course like all movies about british royals its fun to watch those sets.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R8PXSFGY9MC2.html">A3R8PXSFGY9MC2</a><br/><p>This is a great film, looking inside the life of the royal family as they deal with the death of Diana. It shows how the country mourned her loss and how the royals found it hard to connect with the people they ruled. Tony Blair comes across as being in touch with the public mood and it is a good reminder of how he was when he started out and before the power corrupted! A few characters don't come across too well (Cherie Blair and Prince Phillip), but you tend to relate to the Queen by the end of the film and understand a little more how she was brought up in a different time and felt unable to connect with the country when they looked to her for a degree of leadership. All the parts are acted well and I found the film length to be perfect, with enough info and story before it became overlong and boring. Overall a good film, showing the more human side to the Queen and a snapshot of a turbulent time in the royals life.

The Queen is a great film, along with Mirren's incredible preformance I think that Michael Sheen and James Cromwell(who doe a great British accent by the way,considering he's American!) did a great job as well!!!

Thank goodness for Mirren, her delicate performance saved this film from sinking, her Oscar was much deserved. Most of the film surrounds the death of Princess Diana, Queen Elizabeth wasn't a fan of hers by any means. I was expecting more of a dramatic film, the Brits really are stuffy. This a mixed bag for me.</p></br><a href="../users/A1SVXJZ3386U2D.html">A1SVXJZ3386U2D</a><br/><p>I only watched "The Queen" tonight because I recall it won an Oscar a year or two ago.  That isn't always a guarantee of a good film but "The Queen" is a reminder that often it IS.  I really didn't know what to expect but I was drawn in quickly.  Whomever decided to make a movie about the warm, loving side of QEII gets my vote for the Oscar for Best Original Idea.  This movie actually works very well and I found myself cheering for the old gal.  The rather recent history was also a big plus as I suspect most of us find ourselves being drawn back into the shocking event of Princess Di's untimely death.  I'm sure that there were plenty of people like myself who never really followed the Princess yet were drawn into the communal sadness that followed her fatal accident.  I recall the British uproar over the lack of any emotional expression from Queen Elizabeth II and, admittedly, her inaction seemed pretty cold at the time.  I actually feel better now about her and a lot of other things.  I was engrossed in the portrayal of the official yet caring relationship that the new PM Tony Blair was developing with her majesty.  I'm sure much of this is creative but the frequent use of newsreel accounts seems to draw us into a sense of complete reality.  I don't know when I last saw a movie that got me so involved with such an aloof character.  Maybe this same production crew will rejuvenate Senator John F. Kerrey next. (Substitute VP Dick Cheney if you don't see the humor in my first suggestion).</p></br><a href="../users/A17FLA8HQOFVIG.html">A17FLA8HQOFVIG</a><br/><p>This 2006 film tells the story of those dark days in 1997 when Princess Diana was tragically killed in a car crash and the world mourned the loss.  Queen Elizabeth, however, did not react immediately.  Because of the scandal surrounding the Princess's divorce from Prince Charles, royal protocol ruled, and there was a conspicuous silence from Buckingham Palace.<br /><br />In the role that won her the Academy Award, Helen Mirren's Queen Elizabeth seems absolutely real. Something magical happens and she actually "becomes" her royal highness herself.  It's not just that she looks like her; it's much more than that.  She has mastered the accent, the nuances, and the fleeting emotion in a self-controlled countenance.  She is also humbled and confused but this only comes through in fleeting moments of personal soul searching.  Otherwise, she embodies proper behavior as befits the tradition of the monarchy.<br /><br />Michael Sheen is cast in the role of Prime Minister Tony Blair and the early scenes depict his awkwardness in the presence of the Queen of England.  As the story progresses, however, he actually helps her to understand that the world has changed in the fifty years since she was crowned. This is all done very subtlety and I couldn't help be moved by the Queen's personal turmoil.<br /><br />There were strengths in the screenplay and but there were also weaknesses.  A lot of the story was told through newsreels that we have all seen over and over again.  Also, we know how it all played out.  And so I found myself a bit impatient at the slow pace.<br /><br />I do recommend this film as I think it shows a particular piece of history and some absolutely superb acting.  But it does drag on a bit so try not to be too sleepy when you see it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TEMNM9ZEOLJ6.html">A1TEMNM9ZEOLJ6</a><br/><p>The actors really look the parts in this insider's fantasy about what it must be like to be queen. The film really focuses on the week Diana died, and what happened behind the scenes. It's speculation, but we do know the Royals didn't want to acknowledge the death until forced by public opinion. If this is what it's like to be royal, I'll take it. Really top quality.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1EDCBV2KU8D.html">A3Q1EDCBV2KU8D</a><br/><p>This movie did a good job of showing how the public eye sees reality and how that reality could be seen from the eyes of those in the public.  This gives a dramatic review of how the events around the Death of Diana could have unfolded.  The acting was done quite well and it was easy to move into this reality for a bit.  You even felt compassion for the Royal family and for the difficult situation that the Prime Minister was in.  In the end, it was a good movie for expanding the understanding of what happened from another perspective.</p></br><a href="../users/A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8.html">A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8</a><br/><p>As an American, I have never quite "gotten" the role that the British Monarchy plays in the government and life of Great Britain. This film went far towards explaining this, as the British establishment reeled after the death of Princess Diana. Tony Blair had just taken up his duties as Prime Minister when this tragedy struck. The nexus of this film is the struggle between Blair and the Queen concerning how the Monarchy should react to Diana's death. The British public demanded that the House of Windsor address the issue publicly, while the Queen implacably sought to keep out of the public eye during this turmoil. The Queen, at least according to this film, initially treated Blair with contempt, but eventually is forced to see that Blair correctly understood what the public demanded of the Monarchy. One interesting line in the film is where the Queen reflects that "when a Queen loses touch with her subjects, maybe it is time for her to step aside in favor of a new generation..." Now there is food for thought...<br /><br />This film depicts the Queen as a dignified lady, steeped in tradition, who is nevertheless hopelessly out of touch with public opinion and suffering from not a little over-arrogance. Tony Blair forces her to see that the Monarchy, in the end, must serve the people and meet their expectations. In one scene she sits in depression, staring at a newspaper headline "Queen Bends the Knee to Blair." Yes, that about summed it up.<br /><br />Helen Mirren absolutely nails the role of the Queen in this film, and Michael Sheen does very well as Tony Blair. All of the supporting actors do well. This is a quality film that successfully captures the turmoil that Diana's death caused for the British Establishment. It is also excellent entertainment.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EHTFVSD0H7I6.html">A1EHTFVSD0H7I6</a><br/><p>I hadn't read much about the film before renting it so I wasn't sure what to expect.<br /><br />The film covers a few short months in the lives of the Royal family beginning at the election of Tony Blair and ending two months after Diana's death.<br /><br />The plot is slow moving. Don't expect action. Quiet moments of discussion between the Queen and different family or staff members fills the majority of the film.<br /><br />Interspersed between newscast reports of the details of Diana's death are scenes of reaction and struggle as the Queen stretches to do the right thing -- even though it may not feel proper.<br /><br />This is a very well acted study of characters placed in tough and unfamiliar situations.</p></br><a href="../users/AEMZRE6QYVQBS.html">AEMZRE6QYVQBS</a><br/><p>Few books or films about a living monarch can avoid caricature. Royalty as a fact on the ground runs so contrary to the spirit of modernity--yet there they *are*!--and still holds such sentimental power for many 'subjects'. The result is the virtual impossibility of a civil discussion about gradated pros and cons.<br /><br />Into this moral sloshing about strides Stephen Frears' THE QUEEN, a movie best remembered for the command performance (queens usually ask for such a thing rather than *giving* it) of Dame  Helen Mirren as Queen Elizabeth II. Almost predictably, the film lurches into the tendency to create and caricature vilains: Cherie Blair and Prince Philip come of as genuine awfuls occupying opposite extremes of the ideological spectrum. Prince Charles and Alisdair Campbell are almost as bad.<br /><br />One might argue that Fears did not *create* those villains, simply portrayed them within an acceptable range of their already existing awfulness. This is plausible. Most of us will never know because we will never know *them*.<br /><br />Yet I find THE QUEEN a gripping film because of its superb narration of a dialogue-of-wary-respect between Blair and the Queen. Mrs Blair even accuses the young prime minister of 'going over' to the royals just as all Labour MPs have gone 'gaga' when given access to them.<br /><br />A word of parenthesis: this American reviewer was living in England at the time of Diana's death, the occasioning fact of this cinematic drama. My family and I had no particular opinion regarding Diana and certainly did not revere her. Yet we found ourselves caught up in the astonishing emotional outpouring that gripped Great Britain and to some extent the wider world in the week following her death. Something happened outside a Paris tunnel that week that none of us would have anticipated and that few understand to this day.<br /><br />It is easy for me to imagine that Blair's conversations with the Queen were just about as Fears depicts them and that this *was* one of those positive outcomes that occasionally ensue when two people of strong character invade each other's company because of circumstances that neither one would have chosen.<br /><br />I find the physical, visual portrayal of Blair unconvincing, though this is hardly fatal to the movie's success. Helen Mirren as the Queen, on the other hand, seems almost eerily true to fact.<br /><br />This flawed but ultimately stirring movie is worth owning and returning to from time to time as distance readjusts the lens on a memory that remains unshakably present for those of us who lived through the events at close hand.</p></br><a href="../users/A21XVS00AIENLX.html">A21XVS00AIENLX</a><br/><p>I admire what the filmakers attempted to do with this movie.  Stephen Frears's style is very matte, no gloss, which was the right medium to depict the restrained, modestly upright lifestyle of the royals.  You can't help but feel the stark difference between their demeanor and that of their subjects.  This is exacerbated by both side's reaction to the death of Lady Di.  The royals desired a private burial for Diana whereas the nation wished for a public one since she was considered the "People's Princess".  Throughout the movie you find yourself trying to identify with points of view and then figuring out which side was truly right to begin with.  Of course, none of this is resolved on screen, but the resulting events are well played out in a sort of denoument of compromise.<br /><br />While Helen Mirren was spot on playing Queen Elizabeth, I felt Michael Sheen was also deserving of an Oscar for his portrayal of Tony Blair, handling his first official crisis after just stepping in office (ironically foreshadowing a real-life future one much larger than this).  Tony Blair, much like the audience, is caught somewhere in the middle, trying to understand both sides and come up with a resolution that allows both to save face.<br /><br />This is definitely a worthwhile movie, but for those who prefer something a little more action packed, I'd advise you to skip this.</p></br><a href="../users/A140XH16IKR4B0.html">A140XH16IKR4B0</a><br/><p>The poster for "The Queen" - practically a study in Elizabeth's facial pores - led me to sense that the film would be a savage attack on the Queen and the monarchy. Instead, I found it to be an evenhanded and even sympathetic glance into the reaction of the Royal Family to British rage over their evident coolness to Princess Diana's death in 1997.<br /><br />The film portrays the events in question in a fairly straightforward manner. After Diana's final death ride, the Queen and her family are rousted from sleep and watch the unfolding story on television at Balmoral castle in Scotland, privately expressing heartfelt annoyance that Diana is again generating attention. Prince Philip (played admirably by American actor James Cromwell) is especially furious throughout the film, expressing the royals' contempt for Diana and what they felt was public mawkishness egged on by the British press. Their official reaction (except, curiously, for Prince Charles's) was unemotional and measured, driven by protocol (whether to raise the Royal standard to half staff or to make public statements) and a continuing desire to keep Diana in her place.<br /><br />Newly-elected PM Tony Blair (an incredible Michael Sheen) opposes the royals, but his close contact with them also lets him understand their point of view. Going against his young staff, whose anti-royal stance has them enjoying the Royal discomfort, Blair shows himself perhaps a bit too sympathetic to the Queen's plight, a tendency that might explain his recent woes.<br /><br />"The Queen" is a study in contrasts -- between the royal world of starchy reserve that no longer inspires, and the messiness of Tony Blair's TV-watching and cereal-chomping young family; between a confessional media culture (that Diana played to the hilt) and an older culture that prized privacy and decorum above all. The fun of the film is watching the Royals becoming aware of the need to embrace this new culture and by so doing remain at least minimally relevant to their people.<br /><br />Helen Mirren both impersonates her subject (!) and interprets her. Mirren's performance helps the audience make sense of the Queen's inner struggle as well as of her professional carapace of detachment. A scene where she throw her pack of dogs of morsel of meat, and then with a hand gesture commands them to wait (they do!) before eating it, exemplifies the self-control that Elizabeth demands of herself and expects of those around her. Only once did the movie leap the bounds of plausibility, as the Queen, driving her own truck around Balmoral at the height of the crisis, gets stuck in the middle of a river. Her sighting of a beautiful, hunted animal begins to open her eyes to her people's grief over Diana, another beautiful "animal" hunted to death. Though the scene screams "metaphor!," the script is silent, allowing the viewer to make the connection.<br /><br />The DVD extras are spare, consisting of a not-too-revelatory "making of" mini-flick.<br /><br />"The Queen" is a standout movie, very solidly cast, very well-written, daring and successful in tackling recent events, believable and illustrative of the time period. That it does not hit one over the head with facile conclusions -- and that it allows a variety of points of view to co-exist unresolved -- demonstates its confidence and is very attractive. A veddy, veddy good film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KJ6JAZPH382D.html">A3KJ6JAZPH382D</a><br/><p>Helen Mirren won the Oscar of her portrayal of Queen Elizabeth for a very good reason. She stripped away all pretense of being a glamorous actress and made QE look like a human. As England rises in resentment over the Palace's lack of response concerning the death of Princess Diana, the Royal Family greet the public response as a passing phase. Just how greatly they misunderstood the public's love of Diana completely escapes them, to the point where every concession is met with greater derision within the walls of the royal confines. "Celebrities and homosexuals," sneers Prince Phillip when he hears of the attendees planning on attending Diana's funeral.<br /><br />The focus of "The Queen," however, remains Queen Elizabeth. She gains humanity and humility as the movie progresses. She is hard as nails (the car breakdown scene is a hoot), but still feels compassion for a stag that is being hunted on the grounds. (The overbearing allegory of the stag and Diana is a bit much, though.) The prime moment of realization comes from a young girl with flowers in front of Buckingham Palace, and it also emphasizes what a splendid job Mirren did...she conveys so many emotions in just a few expressions and no words.<br /><br />Mention also should be given to Hugh Cromwell, who plays Prince Phillip as a stuffy old coot with a typical out of touch Monarch's snobbery and Michael Sheen as Tony Blair. Sheen shows Blair transforming from radical modernizer into a fan of the details of royalty very effectively. There is also an interesting moment near the end of the movie when Queen Elizabeth tells Blair that someday the press and the people will inevitably turn on you. While we aren't certain if that conversation ever took place, it seems deliciously prophetic none the less.</p></br><a href="../users/A1I7QGUDP043DG.html">A1I7QGUDP043DG</a><br/><p>Helen Mirren is superb in her portrayal of the Queen during the traumatic time surrounding the beloved Princess Diana's death. Queen Elizabeth II is caught in a very hard place when her public seems to demand an outward show of emotion and the Queen wishes to hold fast to the tradition of private mourning. The film only gives us a glimpse into royal life and a dramatization of actual events, but it's enough to give the viewer a small idea of how difficult this period was for the Royals and the people of England when they lost their beautiful 'fairytale Princess'. My heart also broke for her children all over again.<br /><br />Chrissy K.

She does a brilliant job and sometimes you almost can't believe that she isn't the real Queen.  Tony Blair was also really well cast and the actor did a fantastic job in looks and voice.<br /><br />It doesn't always show the Queen in good light.  She made some poor decisions after Diana's death.  She took her sweet time in addressing the public and she didn't lower the flag at the Palace among other things.  It shows some real footage from news bulletins and a little of the funeral prossesion and it kept William and Harry away from the spotlight (therefore keeping some of their privacy).<br /><br />There is fantastic acting in this and one thing I really liked about this is that it gives you a semi real glimpse into the mysterious life of a bizzare family and what happened behind the scenes after the death of their former daughter-in-law, wife and mother.  I really liked it and I was glad to finally get around to watching it yesterday.  I can't believe it took me so long.  I highly recommend it.</p></br><a href="../users/A18758S1PUYIDT.html">A18758S1PUYIDT</a><br/><p>Helen Mirren excels in the title role as Queen Elizabeth II, whose privacy, traditionalism, and perceived stoicism are put to the test when her subjects attack her motives and expect her to pour her emotions out in public after the death of Princess Diana.  This film is an interesting exploration of the old monarchy vs. the "modern age."  Sure, I think monarchies are old-fashioned and need to go the way of the dinosaur.  But at the same time, I don't see why those who choose not to flaunt their emotions in public should be judged so harshly for it.<br /><br />Otherwise:  James Cromwell does nicely as Prince Phillip, as does the fellow playing Tony Blair.</p></br><a href="../users/AN8M401S8Y6DA.html">AN8M401S8Y6DA</a><br/><p>From the previews it almost looks like a period piece which might turn alot of people off, but this movie takes place in 1997 the week of Princess Diana's death.  It shows the effect her death had on the british empire and around the world.  I was one year out of high school and on my way to basic training in 1997, to immature and wrapped up in my own mind to understand the impact it had on people, yet watching this movie and seeing the live broadcasts it was touching you could feel it.<br />It deserves it's 6 oscar nominations and one win for Hellen Mirren who does an amazing job.<br />The queen also received 98% positve feedback on rottentomatoes of 166 reviews who can all write better than me.<br />Stephen Frears directs he also directed the grifters and high fidelity both with john cusack, both movies also received 4 stars from the grand pooba of critics roger ebert and made his personal top 10 lists the years they were released.  Roger Ebert being out due to surgery from salivary cancer still reviewed the queen and also gave it 4 stars last year.  You can tell Stephen frears being born in the UK had some fun with this as when Prince Philip tells queen Elizabeth "move over cabbage" when he jumps into bed.  His movie has a great flow and does a beautiful job with the buck and the queen in the woods which symbolizes Dianna as the queen tries to help it but in the end it was still hunted down by the trackers almost as Dianna was by the paparazzi.  He has a great eye for detail i believe i saw a playstation 1 or a supernintendo on Tony blairs tv set.<br />The movie does not take sides, and it shows us a side of a woman that nobody would get to see other than in a movie, and maybe help the way she is remembered.<br />Thanks for reading.</p></br><a href="../users/AS6SH2JM2YY3H.html">AS6SH2JM2YY3H</a><br/><p>Remember the movie JFK?

The movie is not complementary regarding the Royals (particularly Prince Philip), and is very complementary of Blair.<br /><br />After watching The Queen, you will find yourself wondering how much is true, and how much is fiction?<br /><br />For this, wait for Tony Blair's autobiography.

Helen Mirren gives a stunning portrayal of Elizabeth II (just as she did Elizabeth I)of a monarch whose judgment stirs debate from her subjects.<br /><br />When Princess Diana dies the Royal Family takes the position of keeping it a private matter.

It was during this period of intense national mourning that the Queen demonstrated that she had a tin ear when it came to gauging the mood and feelings of her subjects. For many days, as the grieving multitudes gathered outside the gates of Buckingham Palace, weeping uncontrollably and laying down a veritable sea of flowers in the Princess' memory, the Royals remained holed up on a country estate, voluntary captives to "protocol," making not so much as a single public statement acknowledging Diana's death or providing any words of solace to a hurting nation.<br /><br />The coldness of the reaction prompted many in England to seriously consider abolishing the monarchy altogether, once and for all consigning it to the ash heap of history as a quaint relic of a bygone era, an anachronistic institution that had long since outlived its usefulness. Yet, the film is much more sympathetic in its treatment of the monarch than that barebones synopsis would suggest, for more than anything else, it sees the queen less as a heartless monster than as an old-fashioned woman ill-equipped to deal with a modern world where baring one's soul in public has become the unquestioned norm and even a dignified solemn funeral is turned into a celebrity-laden, made-for-TV spectacle. She seems genuinely baffled and stunned by the unprecedented outpouring of grief over Diana's death, partly because of the queen's own animosity towards the woman whom she felt demeaned the court by many of her actions, and partly because the queen herself hails from a time when one did one's grieving in private, and when the sole role of a leader in a time of national crisis was to project an image of "stiff-upper-lipped" stoicism and strength for her people.<br /><br />It would have been easy for writer Peter Morgan and director Stephen Frears to have concentrated exclusively on the queen's aloofness and coldness, to have turned her into a caricature of the snooty, self-absorbed, "let them eat cake" aristocrat. Instead, the filmmakers insist on seeing her as a fully rounded human being, strong willed and unemotional, yet capable of being wounded by the disapproval of her subjects and of extending a hand of compassion to others in her own uniquely subtle way.<br /><br />Small wonder that Helen Mirren has been showered with every conceivable acting honor for her incomparable portrayal of this complex woman. Mirren has been handed the challenge of illuminating a character who is, by her very nature, unimpassioned and undemonstrative. As such, the actress has had to rely almost exclusively on the subtlest of expressions and gestures to convey the brittleness, stoicism and genuine royal dignity of a woman who literally grew up in the role of one of the world's longest-serving monarchs (she notes early on in the film that the first person to serve as her Prime Minister was a certain someone named Winston Churchill). Yet, Mirren's ability to also show us the queen's compassionate and vulnerable side is what brings the character to life and engages our interest.<br /><br />Mirren is matched by the brilliant Michael Sheen, whose performance as the newly elected Tony Blair is every bit as mesmerizing as hers. Blair comes off so favorably in this film that one is tempted to suspect some sort of collusion on the part of the scriptwriter and the Prime Minister himself. As envisioned by Morgan, Blair is the perfect foil for the queen, a "modern" man who is able to ever-so-gently prod her highness into saving her royal arse by doing the right thing politically. For Blair is, if nothing else, a clear-eyed pragmatist who, when all around him are calling for imperial heads to roll, shrewdly knows that a palace coup would not be in the best interests of England at this time.<br /><br />There are fine performances too by James Cromwell as Prince Phillip, Sylvia Syms as the Queen Mum, Alex Jennings as a very milquetoasty Prince Charles, and Helen McCrory as Blair's straightforward, no-nonsense wife who can't understand how her Labor Party husband could be so willing to help the queen extricate herself from the rather sticky wicket she's gotten herself into. The film supplies a generous helping of actual newsreel footage from the time to effectively flesh out the context of the drama.<br /><br />Almost in spite of itself, the film winds up moving us, even though, in terms of style, "The Queen" is every bit as dry, brittle - some might even say "stuffy" - as the woman who is its subject. Which is precisely why - for all us Anglophiles out here in particular - it makes for such a jolly good show at the cinema.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER5AYS3FQ9O3.html">A1ER5AYS3FQ9O3</a><br/><p>Picking Helen Mirren to play the queen was an act of genius but even her spectacular performance could not have saved a lackluster script. I find it quite an achievement that this movie was able to create a (sometimes) sympathetic portrait of a woman who fell out of public favor in many circles after Princess Diana's death.<br /><br />  All the politics of the situation are played out in detail, giving a look at how the Prime Minister, Tony Blair, and Mirren did a certain amount of dancing around the situation and the tensions there. The Queen was criticized for her stiffness and lack of emotion, but somehow this film manages to show the cracks in that rigid facade, doing so with a certain modicum of wit and grace. Also, I found myself surprised that the film actually made me think about the possible  benefits of a certain amount of reserve and decorum, commonly known as the "stiff upper lip", although I still feel there was far too much coldness on the Queen's part after the Princess died. It is a small miracle that the film manages to make her the slightest bit sympathetic, especially considering the bias many may feel against her because of her actions after Diana's death.<br /><br />  However you feel about the terrible events of Princess Diana's tragic accident and the events that followed, this movie is a superb portrayal of a woman who may be far more complex than believed. Watch it the first chance you get!</p></br><a href="../users/A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F.html">A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F</a><br/><p>Helen Mirren won the 2006 Academy Award as Best Actress for her impeccable portrayal of Queen Elizabeth of England. "The Queen" maninly focuses on the death of the beloved Princess Diana and its aftermath and how the Queen wanted to treat her death as a private family matter instead of a public spectacle in which British Prime Minister Tony Blair wanted. The film depicts the public disaapproval over the Queen's decisions during this time and how she reacted to their opinions.<br /> Hellen Mirren is amazingly perfect in the role of the Monarch. Her speech patterns and mannerisms are impeccable and she shows that the Queen is in essence a real human being with real flaws and emotions.<br /> "The Queen" was budgeted at 15 million dollars and blew expectations for its success out of the water grossing over 100 million dollars world wide. Fans and critics hailed the moving for Mirren's searing portrayal of one of the most well loved figures in modern history.<br /> The DVD features an excellent "making of "The Queen" featurette" along with an informative commentary by Director Stephen Frears and writer Peter Morgan.<br /> Richard Roeper of "Ebert and Roeper" states "the acting is pinpoint perfect".</p></br><a href="../users/A1DK5AZMXS1QA3.html">A1DK5AZMXS1QA3</a><br/><p>The last 20 years has seen a growing Hollywood infatuation with English history, especially that concerning the crown.  Examples included "Elizabeth", "Shakespeare in Love", "Braveheart", and now "The Queen".  The last takes place in the present, the 1990's specifically, and chronicles the personal experience of the royal family after the death of Diana.  The story is told from multiple points of view, with the Queen and Tony Blair being the two main protagonists.  He is in touch with the British people; she is not.  She is in touch with England's past, they are not.  She feels the best way to get past Diana's death is in private; the public want a public ceremony.  So opposites collide and as a sign of a modern country, the monarch gives way to the people's will.  As an American, I found this to be quite an insightful movie, in that it very realistically portrays how a real person in power relates to the masses as part of a real historical event.  Few movies exist that do the same for American leaders; the last great one was probably "Nixon" by Oliver Stone.  Though all dialogue, this was a captivating movie, and worth the two hours to watch it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BLITJITO97N5.html">A2BLITJITO97N5</a><br/><p>Helen Mirren gives a complex and sympathetic performance in this well-written and performed movie about Queen Elizabeth's reponse to the nationwide grieving over the death of Princess Diana. In retrospect, the massive mourning over Diana seems excessive and silly. The Queen's initial reaction of having a private funeral was the right choice but the crowds were insane - making much more of Diana than she deserved. In my opinion, the Queen was not out of touch - the British people were - so dazed by a foolish celebrity culture that they were no longer rational. Yes, Prince Philip comes off as stupid - most of the Royal family are. The Queen, however, has conducted herself with a great sense of duty and faithfulness to her people. Unfortunately, in the weeks after Diana's death, rationality and intelligence were difficult to come by. This movie is what many of us crave - an adult drama free of special effects and comupter generated aliens. The actor who plays Tony Blair does an equally excellent job.</p></br><a href="../users/ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV.html">ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV</a><br/><p>At an early point in THE QUEEN, Prince Charles comments that the Princess Diana known to the royal family and the Princess Diana known to the people are two entirely different entities.  It is an astute observation, and much the same might be said of Queen Elizabeth II herself, a woman who has spent most of her life upholding the dignities, responsibilities, and duties of the crown regardless of her personal sentiments--and who has worked remarkably hard to keep those sentiments out of the public eye.<br /><br />THE QUEEN focuses on the week following Princess Diana's fatal car crash, and Princess Diana's presence broods over the film in the form of actual news footage.  But THE QUEEN focuses on Elizabeth, and as presented here she is a woman whose life has been dominated by the discipline required of her office.  She has authority, wealth, and priviledge of such degree that it is far, far beyond the scope of all but handful to imagine, much less understand.  At the same time, however, she is a prisoner in a gilded cage; few moments are hers alone, and only her iron-clad will upholds her in the face of the demands of her office.<br /><br />It not therefore surprising that upon Diana's death Elizabeth instantly sets aside her own emotions and moves forward inside the code of conduct that has dominated her entire life.  Even her concerns for her grandsons must take second place to the demands of her office, and in this instance she determines that the office demands the same stability she has always offered to her people: a calm and unruffled visage and adherence to the meticulous protocol that has shaped her entire life.  This proves a great miscalculation.  The public, enamored of Diana, interprets this as indicative of royal indifference.<br /><br />Very little can be said of Helen Mirren's performance as Queen Elizabeth II which has not already been said.  It is brilliant and quite possibly unequalled in its recreation and interpretation of such a well-known and still-living figure.  It is perfectly balanced by Michael Sheen in the role of Prime Minister Tony Blair, whose habitual informality offers a perfect counter-balance, and the remarkable efforts of those cast as the royals: James Cromwell, Sylvia Syms, Alex Jennings, and Helen McCrory, who play Prince Philip, The Queen Mother, Prince Charles, and Cherie Blair respectively.  The tone of the film is cool, graceful, elegant, and indeed stately--and although this might have emerged as dull in other hands, it builds to a remarkable climax in the hands of Stephen Frears.<br /><br />The one occasionally questionable note is the script by Peter Morgan.  In one sense, it is remarkably resourceful, managing to include considerable detail; in another, however, it is extremely obvious.  I was occasionally troubled by the thought that, had it not been fueled by the miraculous performances of the cast, it would have drifted into triteness.  This is particularly the case in terms of character shifts, which occasionally seem unexpected and which occasionally go nowhere in particular.<br /><br />It would be interesting to know what the royals and the Blairs think of the film.  At present there has been--in typical Buckingham Palace style--little or no comment.  The Queen herself has only noted that, given that it focuses upon a particularly painful time, she has no desire to see it.  In terms of quality, the DVD is quite good without being dazzling.  Bonuses include a short and generally interesting, if not particularly deep, "making of" documentary and two audio commentaries: one by director Stephen Frears and writer Peter Morgan, which is good, and one by royal expert Robert Lacey, which is better still.  Strongly recommended.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZOF747O5EB6R.html">A1ZOF747O5EB6R</a><br/><p>The British monarchy is an anachronism.  How in a modern society can we reconcile birth right privilege with progress and democracy?  The two should be mutually antagonistic.  In the long run, the monarchy will first be cast off by nations such as Canada and Australia.  In due course, its days will be numbered even in England.  Yet, in spite of its very anachronistic nature, it continues to draw breath.<br /><br />The film, "The Queen" covers the events following the death of Princess Diana.  We are given an opportunity to look inside both the royal household and within 10 Downing Street.  It was the royal household that could not understand the outpouring of public grief over Diana's death.  It was Tony Blair that dragged the Queen reluctantly into an understanding of this grief.  I must admit that, at the time and still to this day, I cannot myself understand why so many people fell for Diana.  She was an intellectual lightweight who could be moody and self-indulgent.  Her end should have been little more than a historical footnote.  The fact that it wasn't is the real conundrum.<br /><br />Helen Mirren is brilliant as the Queen.  She is totally plausible.  Indeed, the whole cast is quite stunning.  The cast allows the events to unfold while the viewer is swept along for the ride.  And a great ride it is!  Anyone over the age of twenty should be able to recall the events surrounding the death of Diana.  However, at no time is the film stale.  It is tense drama at its best!  I can thoroughly recommend this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PN7Z2VTHICL8.html">A2PN7Z2VTHICL8</a><br/><p>The movie starts with a blip over the election of Tony Blair to Prime Minister, and quickly skips forward to the horrible day that Princess Diana died.  Caught in all the media frenzy is Queen Elizabeth II, not a fan of Diana to begin with.  The Queen wishes to keep the royal family's mourning private, but the public outcry for closure forces her to come out of her privacy shell, return to the palace from their country estate, and make a public statement.<br /><br />The movie provided some private peeks into royal life, such as the queen driving herself up into the boondocks of her estate and getting her jeep stuck in a river.  A vision of the stag her grandsons are hunting leaves her with a haunting vision of its grandeur.  It's hard to image the queen doing such mundane things as driving a jeep or setting a glass of water by her bedside instead of simply snapping her fingers for water whenever she wants it.<br /><br />There's some great acting here too.  Helen Mirren as Queen Elizabeth II and the incomparable James Cromwell as Prince Philip are spectacular in their roles.  The dialogue is a bit stiff at times, but it's hard to tell if its from the scripting or on purpose because of the stiffness and formality of the royal family's, and the British elite's, communications.<br /><br />One strange thing I couldn't help noticing were the phones used as props.  Some were ancient desktop rotary phones and yet in other scenes there were modern cellular phones.  Perhaps I noticed this because I became a bit bored with the sometimes slow and stale progress of the film, but I'm sure if I decided to watch it again I would find another discrepancy.  Overall, it's a good movie to watch once.  I recommend a rent, not a purchase.  3.5 stars.  Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/AJMU8VVFKMZI4.html">AJMU8VVFKMZI4</a><br/><p>I don't see The Queen enough from my part of the world to truely judge whether Ms. Mirren nailed her performance.

As for the movie's content and it's overall entertainment value, I agree with the reviewer in this felt more like something you'd watch on A & E's Biography or Public TV.  I was fine paying three bucks for a rental than the double digits one would pay at the theater.  Take a peek and judge for yourself-I just suggest you go the rental route like I did.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LSDDSM4PGOU5.html">A1LSDDSM4PGOU5</a><br/><p>i have to admit,i had no really interest in seeing this movie.but a friend brought it over,so i thought why not.turns out it was a mixed blessing.on the one hand,Helen Mirren absolutely channels Queen Elizabeth.her performance is unreal.and James Cromwell is good as her husband.however,the actor portraying Prince Charles,was,in my mind miscast.i also didn't think the movie was in depth enough.for me there just wasn't enough substance.that's not to say it's a bad movie.it has its good moments.,and there are some compelling scenes.but overall,i just didn't find it spectacular.but Helen Mirren elevates the material.hence,for me,The Queen is a 3/5</p></br><a href="../users/A9TG2NFA614S9.html">A9TG2NFA614S9</a><br/><p>"The Queen" (2006) is a wonderful, fascinating movie with a great script, superior cinematography, and great acting by Helen Mirren as Queen Elizabeth II and by Michael Sheen as a toothy Tony Blair. It's all about the death of Prince Diana, the royals' reaction and behavior after her death and the way the public in an outpouring of grief turned their wrath against the royal family believing them to be indifferent to her death.<br />Looking back, the paroxysms of grief that were displayed by the public now seem excessive. Viewing the movie now, I think viewers may be slightly more sympathetic toward the Queen.<br />The movie portrays the royal family with Prince Philip, Elizabeth's husband (expertly played by actor James Cromwell) as a mean-spirited and nasty man who always has to put his oar in. The Queen Mum (in a brilliant piece of casting played by Sylvia Syms) is cold-hearted. Prince Charles is ineffectual, weak, and bungling. The Queen shows her disdain for him and has some nasty cracks to make about her playgirl sister Margaret.<br />All of this, of course, involves guesswork and supposition by the screenwriter since few were privy to what went on in the royal establishment. When Diana died, the royals were ensconced in Balmoral Castle in Scotland. Callous Prince Philip took the boys (Prince William and Hall, not portrayed in the movie) out hunting for a stag during the mourning period.<br />The Queen and royals remained in Balmoral while the public seethed. The movie shows the newly elected Blair benefiting from the furor and shows him imploring the Queen to show some consideration for her subjects who wanted her to be almost mourner-in-chief. Finally Blair convinces the Queen that the media is after her head, and the public is turning against the monarchy.<br />Through all of this Helen Mirren does a masterful job of making the Queen a flawed but real and human person.<br />Newsreel footage is used with great skill. It's an engrossing look at the royals. Elizabeth drives herself around the huge Balmoral estate, and she sees a beautiful stag. The symbolism of the stag is not completely clear, whether it shows Elizabeth's reaction to her predicament, whether it's Diana, or whether it shows that she values animals above human beings.</p></br><a href="../users/A2INL3AYAT6325.html">A2INL3AYAT6325</a><br/><p>I did not think I was going to like the film.  Had NO Interest in it when released.<br />Being from the United States I have NO interest in the British Royal Family, Princess Diana, any of them.<br /><br />I watched the film 1 day & did enjoy it.<br />Helen did deserve the Oscar for the role.  Only other film of hers I had ever seen was I was 1st in the door opening day for "The Mosquito Coast".<br /><br />And, I believe the film.  Yep, we knew they did NOT care about Diana.  Arranged marriage & she ended up cheating in the marriage as well.<br /><br />Has normal extras on the DVD.  I am VERY DISAPPOINTED Helen did not do a commentary.  This is HER FILM & won the Oscar for it.  WHERE IS SHE?<br /><br />Of course, ruined by the I HATE THEM WHY WERE THEY MADE FLIP THE LITTLE FLAP OPEN DVD CASE.</p></br><a href="../users/A126KX6FVI4T66.html">A126KX6FVI4T66</a><br/><p>A system that exists from a much previous time broke down when Princess Diana died. The movie is a chronicle of how bad things were, somewhat cleaned up for the press? No matter how good Helen Mirren's mimic of Queen Elizabeth was,the point that seems to be missed is that between them Charles and Queen Elizabeth drove Princess Diana to her death? The Queen should have let Charles marry for love in the first place instead of finding a political alliance that ended in tragedy? The system of royal marriages has ever been broken? Royalty as a system involved in government is a failed one.<br />Historically, the casualties have been enormous.</p></br><a href="../users/A34D4KCP94ACJZ.html">A34D4KCP94ACJZ</a><br/><p>Obviously Princess Diana was a heavily celebrated individual and perhaps with good reason.  Her death was a tragedy and millions mourned.  Perhaps an inferior film would've focused more on her legacy and the behind the scenes feelings that Queen Elizabeth II had regarding The Princess of Wales.  But such expression on film is probably beyond reality as the Queen is by no means a visually emotional person.  Her opinions are more of an enigma and much of that is due to her discipline as Queen.  That is why the story of the interactions between Tony Blair and Queen Elizabeth II on how Diana's death should be treated is worth telling the way it has been here.  I don't think I came to that conclusion until half way through the movie, so I found it to be a very compelling film.<br /><br />It opens with Tony Blair (Michael Sheen) winning the general election for Prime Minister.  Blair was of course an advocate to modernize the country so his early interactions with the Queen (Helen Mirren) were guarded right from the very beginning.  Princess Diana is soon killed in car wreck while being chased by paparazzi and Tony Blair delivers a speech that coins the title "the People's Princess" for Diana.  The Queen of course notes that Diana is technically no longer royalty as she divorced Prince Charles a year earlier.  She believes that the handling of Diana's funeral is to be a private affair and expresses this to Blair.  The result is of course a solid exploration of media hysteria, the Queen's devotion to her vows, and the contemporary dynamics of Royalty for better or worse.  All of these things are certainly elements I knew little about, at least to the extent it is observed here. I'm sure there are inaccuracies somewhere in this picture but not enough for me to pick up on.<br /><br />There are four things that make this film exceptional.  Director Stephen Frears (the Grifters, Dirty Pretty Things) and screenplay writer Peter Morgan (The Last King of Scotland) did an outstanding job in their respective roles.  There is no question that creating a convincing portrayal of this story is no easy task but they managed to pull it off.  The other two items are the performances by Michael Sheen as Tony Blair and Helen Mirren as the Queen.  Sheen was a bit overshadowed by Mirren's performance but he is definitely great.  Mirren's acting on the other hand was universally hyped as the best performance of 2006.  Having seen the film well after the hype and awards I was certainly prepared to be critical of anything but there is no question about it, Mirren was outstanding and deserved her many glowing reviews, standing ovations, and awards.  The Queen is not necessarily written to be likable but she is still the focus of the film and Mirren takes on the task of making her enjoyable to watch and even to some degree relatable.<br /><br />The Queen is a movie that some people will find slow, it is hardcore drama within a historical context that some will find less entertaining without a certain degree of back story.  If you found interest in what happened ten years ago in the aftermath of Diana's death then you will likely enjoy this film tremendously.  If for some reason that isn't your thing then you may want to take heed.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KEZLJ59C1JVH.html">A3KEZLJ59C1JVH</a><br/><p>Helen Mirren won an Academy Award for her performance as Elizabeth II in "The Queen," which depicts the British monarch's reaction to the death of Princess Diana in the summer of 1997. Prime Minister Tony Blair (played brilliantly by Michael Sheen) had just recently been elected at the time of Diana's death, and he was still in the process of determining the best way to forge a successful working relationship with the queen. This film deals with Windsor's fall from grace the week after Diana's death, when the queen refused to follow the prime minister's advice on how to best handle the situation to meet the needs of the grieving British public.<br /><br />At first the queen refuses to take Blair's advice about making any kind of public statement, preferring to remain silent in hopes that the former Princess of Wales would be laid to rest quickly and quietly, without any fanfare. However, the public's frustration grows and Elizabeth faces opposition from the government as well as from her son Charles (Alex Jennings). Soon it becomes clear that the royal family's inaction may wind up being their ultimate demise, and the queen is forced to come to terms with her own emotions and make one of what was surely many difficult choices during her reign.<br /><br />I think this film is brilliant. The cast is absolute perfection, and it's very clear why Mirren received an Oscar for her portrayal as a queen struggling to come to terms with her own personal beliefs and the realization that she doesn't always understand the needs of her people. I also appreciated the way the film handled the treatment of Diana herself. Although the plot of the movie revolves around Diana's death, it's handled gracefully and with dignity. Instead of casting an actress to play the princess, the film relied on a steady peppering of news clips showing the real Diana herself, which was thoughtful and effective.<br /><br />On one hand, "The Queen" depicts a monarchy that is cold and completely out of touch with modern day society. However, although I didn't always agree with Elizabeth's choices, it was easy to sympathize with her position and understand where she was coming from when she made certain decisions. Regardless of her personal feelings toward the late princess, the queen's belief that quiet dignity should be maintained before caving in to public spectacle is a very good point.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie to everyone, if for no other reason than that Mirren portrays Elizabeth II with more humanity than most people might believe is possible. This is truly an excellent film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5.html">A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5</a><br/><p>Helen Mirren  is one of those amazing actresses that make you forget this is a movie and not the Queen herself.  How she  can keep a 'stiff upper lip' and somehow still convey so much emotion is beyond me.<br /><br />I was surprised at how much emotion this film evoked. "The Queen" is well worth a rental and has earned the top rating for the single viewing; however, I am not planning on adding it to my library.</p></br><a href="../users/A3RTMB76CJWY9U.html">A3RTMB76CJWY9U</a><br/><p>The Queen starts out unambitiously enough. Elizabeth II, Queen of England, meeting the newly-elected Prime Minister, Tony Blair, a young up-and-comer who is determined to shake things up a bit in government. Elizabeth assures Blair, through her ceremony, forms, and observation that she has survived ten Prime Ministers (her own education in such relations starting with none other than Winston Churchill), that she will not be shaken up. That it is the young-buck Blair who has everything to learn, and not the stolid, stoic Queen.<br /><br />Of course, Elizabeth was raised in a different time and age. Ensconced in various palaces, she rarely gets the opportunity to see what the realm she ironically leads, is like. When her ex-daughter-in-law, the popular Diana, tragically dies in an auto accident, Elizabeth has no conception of what a storm it will set off, both in Britain and the world. She has no *ability* to conceive of it, either: she believes that death is a private affair, and that England is a country of people who are as private and guarded as is she. On top of that, she personally bears Diana no particular goodwill, and so Elizabeth decides to treat Diana's death as a non-event.<br /><br />But the British people--a different British people than Elizabeth imagines--demands a response. Demands a human, feeling monarchy. Blair, the new man of the people, represents this to the Queen, and so we are introduced to a struggle of wills between the old, controlled, powerful Queen, and the new face of Blair. It is also a struggle, more generally, between tradition and change. If you know what normally wins that struggle, or you remember these particular events in your own lifetime, then you know which side wins.<br /><br />Elizabeth is presented an impossible choice: change and relent, or the monarchy, itself, will crack. It is a wonderfully dramatic scenario, and thrilling to watch it portrayed by such a talented, capable actress. Mirren will win the Best Actress Oscar, and she will deserve it.<br /><br />It is also fun to watch other famous characters, such as Blair and Prince Charles, portrayed. It's hard to not like Blair in this film (as he eventually comes around to respect the monarchy he once found silly and dated), and hard not to feel sorry for him in his own, more recent, fall from popular approval. Prince Charles is another matter all-together: it is moving to watch him grieve for Diana, and painful to watch how this man (the would-be King of England) is so bowed over and controlled by others in his life. Despite the fact that the Queen is the centerpiece, the others are all interesting character studies in their own right.<br /><br />It is rare to have a historical film about events so recent, revolving around people still living and capable (and, in fact, still in power). It's nice to be given this sort of insight into the people we still see on the news, to be able to reconsider our once-held notions of them, instead of waiting until they're long-dead to reflect. The Queen provides us with this rare opportunity, and it does so in an entertaining and brilliantly acted way.<br /><br />This is a wonderful movie.<br /><br />Five stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TPW86OHXTXFC.html">A1TPW86OHXTXFC</a><br/><p>"Go ahead, admit it. Between the kerchiefs and the corgis, the sensible clothes and the semi-detached smile, Britain's Queen Elizabeth II has never been mistaken for the most dramatic monarch in the world, never given much of a hint that there might be a Major Motion Picture in her life. But this immovable object has met the unstoppable force that is actress Helen Mirren, one of the great masters of modern screen acting. In a commanding performance that is as compelling as it is unexpected, she has turned "The Queen" into something you never imagined it could be: a crackling dramatic story that's intelligent, thoughtful and moving."<br />Kenneth Turan<br /><br />Helen Mirren is extraordinary. Not only does she have the ability to take on the appearance of Elizabeth II, The Queen, she is able to reveal in small bits and pieces the humanity of Elizabeth II. Helen Mirren has said that in portraying a living person she imagines that person as a masterpiece painting. She is then able to take the brush and paint as she sees fit.<br /><br />The underlying story is the week the 'People's Princess', Diana dies. Tony Blair, as played by Michael Sheen, has been elected the new Prime Minister. Sheen's performance is sensational. He msut tell The Queen that she is mishandeling the death of Diana. At their first meeting the Queen has reminded Mr Blair, he is her tenth Prime Minister, and he needs to live up to the likes of Winston Churchill. And, this becomes Prime Minister Tony  Blair's fulfilling moment. Diana and The Queen had always been at odds. The Queen wore her emotions tightly locked up  and Diana wore her emotions on her sleeve.  Prince Phillip, as played by James Cromwell is aloof and distant and has no regard for the ex-Princess at all. The ploy to stay in Scotland at Balmoral Castle, for the children's sake does not work. The  public is clamoring for some statement from the Queen.  The Queen asks advice of the Queen mother played by Sylvia Syms, but she, too,has a stiff upper lip. Prince Charles, Alex Jennings, a more modern man, asks Tony Blair to speak to the Queen to provide a statement that is befittng the Princess.  A statement is prepared, but we can see the Queen has some misgivings. The public responds to the Queen's words.<br /><br />"Helen Mirren's allure lies not in finding what's regal in every woman she plays, but in finding what's womanly in every royal." Entertainment Weekly<br /><br />I loved almost everyone in this movie. Prince Phillip not as much.  It was riveting at times and so revealing of the Monarchy that does not, can not, reveal its private nature. The movie is funny and touching in ways you can't predict. Stephen Frears as director, has completed a beautifully moving film, rich in detail. He uses real footage of the funeral and of Diana. We are finally allowed to see the real dignity in the Queen. The current state of the world is referenced when the Queen reminds Tony Blair that the 'people can turn',"one day, quite suddenly, the same thing will happen to you."  I will never look at the real Queen Elizabeth II the same way again after seeing Helen Mirren's portrayal. This may be the greatest gift Elizabeth II could have received.<br /> Highly Recommended. prisrob 5-3-07<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FO0AHO">Elizabeth I</a> DVD<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXGA">High Fidelity</a> DVD</p></br><a href="../users/A3CN9CCJUNIPKT.html">A3CN9CCJUNIPKT</a><br/><p>I have to confess, I have mixed feelings about this film. On one hand, Helen Mirren's performance as Queen Elizabeth II is nothing short of stunning, and is much deserving of the Oscar and all other awards bestowed upon her... The script, however, left me a bit flat. It seemed rather conventional and TV-movie-of-the-weekish, and rather insular as well. Screenwriter Peter Morgan assumes a great deal from his audience, most of all that we have already shared in the media mania that surrounded Princess Diana, and are all well steeped in the twists and turns of her life story, and in her relationship to the royal family. Of course, millions and millions of people are well-versed in the minutae of that story, but for those of us who were casual and neutral observers, this movie does a poor job explaining what transpired, and the significance of various events and personal histories. A great deal of familiarity with the royal family is taken for granted, and we are expected to know their personalities -- the steadfast Elizabeth, the dithering Prince Charles, the bigoted Prince Philip. We're also expected to know their place in the national psyche of Great Britain, and to really feel the dramatic heft and social significance of the commoners rebelling against the old-world propriety of the nobles. In many regards, it's amazing that this film played as well as it did to the American audience... I suppose it's due to two factors, the enduring tabloid appeal of the late Diana, and to Helen Mirren's masterful performance. It's an impressive bit of acting, buoyed by other first-class actors... Bravo, Ms. Mirren... On to bigger and greater triumphs!</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>To confront the Queen of England, Tony Blair and the death of Lady Diana, the Princess of Wales, was dramatic at the time but has totally aged today. And the film has aged to. This big vignette, this enormous cameo in normal life that this week after the tragic end of a young woman was has become quaint, charmingly quaint but with little meaning left. During that week, or even that summer, the monarchy nearly fell in England but the Queen, though surrounded by too many people who were deaf and blind, managed to hear the piece of advice given to her by Tony Blair and she followed it and saved that monarchy. Is that what happened or not? That is not the problem. It is reassuring to believe it is what happened. But it is also important to understand that in today's world what counts is public opinion. We may think public opinion is looking for emotional and sentimental empathy instead of real deep inner grief. But this public opinion remains the yardstick with which we are to measure and determine our behavior. Apparently Stephen Frears wants to make us believe that Elizabeth II did feel and understand the necessity to accept that rule. Something of the kind surely happened. Yet the film is in no way transcendingly immortal. The best part remains Helen Mirren who is embodying a Queen that is superbly heart raking and soul moving.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines</p></br><a href="../users/A2MFNDNS1L7D16.html">A2MFNDNS1L7D16</a><br/><p>Apparently the British public is just as foolish over the cult of celebrity as the U.S. I put Diane in about the same category as those other one name wonders like Paris or Brittany or Lindsey. Whatever she was, it was totally as the result of being the wife of the next king of Britain & the mother of the heir, with a spare. Those pseudo-mourners who hate the royals need to remember without a monarchy, Diane would have been a cute, kindergarten teacher from a prominent family. Her charitible works, eliminating land mines, helping people with AIDS could have been done by anyone if given her oppotunities. The first one, marrying into the royal family & the second, sleeping with the son of one of the richest men in the world. That royalty should even exist as parasites on the British people, the fact is they do. Therefore the people demanded the Queen grieve as they did. Give her grandsons up to be viewed & pitied. It was not her way. Helen Mirren was dead on as the Queen, as was Michael Sheen as the PM, Tony Blair. Always the politician, Blair was instrumential in convincing the Queen into making a statement concerning Diane's death, as he did. The monarchy does move toward modernity at glacial speed. The evolution from the Queen Mum, to Elizabeth, to Charles is evident in this movie. He considers himself a modern man. Even 10 years ago...not. His son, William also a future King, is. Although this movie takes place in a short period of time in 1997 you get a lot of inside information on the monarchy & the life of Elizabeth II. I think she is loved, & respected as maybe representing not the way things are but once were. Maybe not such a bad thing. If you're an Anglophile, watch the commentary version after the movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ.html">A12X2J7AVZ04IQ</a><br/><p>I enjoyed the film on first viewing and was indeed amazed with Helen Mirren's performance, so loaded with nuance and pensiveness. Of course, no one rally knows what goes on behind closed doors at the Royal Palace, so the ingenuity of director Stephen Frears and writer Peter Morgan were put to task and have created a witty and fascinating scenario. Then I listened to the DVD commentary track and realized that there were dozens of in-jokes, many of which were ultimately cut.  There's a moment when Tony Blair (brilliantly played by Michael Sheen) points out that the queen was literally forced into her position, giving up any sense of a normal life. When the Queen sees the beautiful stag, wandering freely, always in danger, I almost thought that she wished she could trade places. Later, she was more concerned about the ultimate fate of the stag that she altered her plans. I liked Helen McCrory as Mrs. Blair, the voice of public opinion regarding the Royal Family, especially at the beginning. Prince Phillip was presented (by James Cromwell) as somewhat of a buffoon, and I enjoyed Sylvia Syms as the Queen Mother.Alex Jennings was very good as Prince Charles, hoping that Tony Blair would "modernize" things in England so he could relax a bit. Everything's been said before by previous reviewers, but these were my impressions. I enjoyed the film a lot, and Mirren's complex portrayal was as complete as I could only guess.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LVZOK9F7K4CN.html">A1LVZOK9F7K4CN</a><br/><p>I sympathize with the Royal Family.  They don't choose to be Royals.  They have very little choice what they do with their lives, really.  They can't vote, they can't run for office, and they can't be anonymous.  The worst part is that nobody else seems to have any sympathy for them because they have so much money.  As we all know, money buys happiness.<br /><br />This is a docudrama, mostly about the week after Princess Diana's death.  Diana and several other characters in the movie "appear as themselves," as it were, through news footage.  For that reason, we never see the two princes, even though much of the movie concerns them, and they are at Balmoral when the action takes place.  Their absence is a bit too conspicuous.<br /><br />The drama comes from Tony Blair's desperate attempts to get the Queen to make more of a fuss over Diana's death.  To him, it is a no-brainer: the public is terribly upset and want their Queen to help them with their grief.  To Elizabeth II, it is all hype.  Why should the flag fly at half-mast at Buckingham Palace, when that isn't even done for people who still are part of the Royal Family?  The Queen must come to terms with the cult of celebrity.<br /><br />The Queen and Tony Blair (ironically) are the most sympathetic characters in the movie.  Charles and Philip are played as buffoons, which I did not particularly care for.  These are complex people and, truth be told, we will never really know what life is like for that family, no matter how much we'd like to believe otherwise.</p></br><a href="../users/A1BA72K4VK1UN1.html">A1BA72K4VK1UN1</a><br/><p>I want to say up front that Helen Mirren's performance as Queen Elizabeth II in this film is first-class, just superb. In fact, this is the most redeeming facet of the movie.<br /><br />The story is this: Here, we have an intimate glimpse of Queen Elizabeth II (as well as her husband, the Queen Mother, and Prince Charles) during the window of time just before and during the week or so period of time after Princess Diana was killed in a car crash in Paris. The focal point of the movie is the hostile reaction of the British people toward the Queen's cold attitude in regard to Diana's death.<br /><br />I need to say up front that I'm a fan neither of The Royals nor of the late Princess -- but I AM interested in hearing all about their endless peccadilloes. In fact, this actuality was one of my disappointments because I thought that this film was about the Queen's entire reign, and it's not. Still, I can't rightfully criticise what the film is NOT about... I just wish that the title had been more explicit.<br /><br />In any case, right away the Queen and the Windsor-Mountbatten family are portrayed as pretty heartless and rotten, at least by American standards. Following the death of Diana, Prince Charles is also served up to us as a spineless flip-flopper and a witless wimp... okay so far.<br /><br />At that point, newly-elected Prime Minister Tony Blair begins advising and urging the Queen to relent on her silence and isolation and share in the grief of the British people over Diane's death, a pill that the old sourpuss finds almost impossible to swallow. Still okay so far.<br /><br />Then, at a turning point in the movie, the producers elect to REDEEM the Queen, just because she came out and sniffed the flowers under extreme political pressure and duress. There was not the first bit of actual remorse in that woman's heart (neither in the film nor in reality!) So, WHY did the film-makers decide to attempt to make her look like a normal human being? I surely have not figured it out!<br /><br />So, in summary, I found this movie to be manipulative, although I must assert that this device was completely lost on me. I hold the Queen in no higher esteem now (post-film) than I did when she was acting like a witch the day after Diana died, (or even before that.)<br /><br />As far as the cinematography and the continuity of the film, it was superb. The Producers also shrewdly used some actual footage of Diana and others which was sprinkled throughout the movie. There's a lot of nice scenery in this flick and some really terrific acting. Overall, I was okay on watching this film all the way through but I would not watch it again. With some trepidation, I would slightly recommend it to others.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJPMB7N776WS.html">A1TJPMB7N776WS</a><br/><p>I can clearly recall that Saturday night in 1997 when I first heard that Princess Diana had been killed. Strangely her death hit me pretty hard as if she were a part of my immediate circle of family and friends.<br /><br />What had Diana meant to me and to millions around the world? And why did we all take her death so personally?<br /><br />Stephan Frears' "The Queen" doesn't deal with these Diana questions much but her death is the engine that pulls this film along to its inevitable conclusion. What he does deal with is Queen Elizabeth's (a perfectly stiff-upper lipped Helen Mirren...a performance without irony and definitely one of respect) reaction, or more to the point, non-reaction to Diana's death.<br /><br />Frears, best known for edgy dramas as in the terrific "The Grifters" and "My Beautiful Launderette" directs here with restraint and reverence which in most cases would translate to stodgy and dull. But Frears, ever the consummate artist treats the material with panache, taking advantage of the political, social and emotional nature of this situation to elevate the material to drama, riveting drama<br /><br /> In 1997, Tony Blair (a dull, odd, Michael Sheen) had just been elected on a platform of change and modernism and meets with a wall that is the implacable Queen and the Royal family who are intent on adhering to tradition which meant that Diana, as no longer a member of the royal family, would not deserve a State funeral. But the English people, who loved Diana as well as People from all over the world persuaded, along with Tony Blair, Queen Elizabeth to change her mind.<br /><br />"The Queen" is very well made and generally well acted though Alex Jennings who plays Prince Charles seems to be in a constant state of indecision and confusion and who perpetually seems to be smelling poop.<br /><br />It's been 9 years since that August night in Paris but if anything Diana's fame is bigger now than ever. "The Queen" does nothing to diminish Diana's fame and of course, she will always remain young and beautiful in our eyes and memories. What "The Queen" does though is to buff up the tarnished reputation of the English Monarchy by making them as human-like as any film has ever done. And that is not an easy task to perform.</p></br><a href="../users/A3572FTYUQQW3P.html">A3572FTYUQQW3P</a><br/><p>I really liked this movie and Helen Mirren -- as usual -- does a fantastic job of portraying the Queen and her royally dysfunctional family as complex anachronisms.  Ms Mirren absolutely deserves the kudo's she has received and could easily capture an oscar for her performance.  She is definitely aided by the makeup and costumes which also deserve mention as being outstanding.  Several things stand out in this movie which I felt served to capture the royal family, its isolation, its dislike of Diana (and why), and its weird family dynamics.  The line "Diana is even more annoying dead than she was alive" I thought captured their real dislike of her as a person.  Even more distrubing was the reaction the Queen had to the death of the stag versus her reaction to the death of Diana. Heart felt emotion for the stag, nothing for Diana.  The flap over the flag was a real indication of how this family is trapped by tradition and protocol, which is more important to them than people.  In fact this film, which may be close to the truth, shows that the royal family lives in a gilded cage constructed of tradition, protocol, slavish minions, and isolation from any real people.No one dares tell them the truth or to disturb the tranquility of their placid and unreal existence.  Clearly this is why Diana was so despised by them.  Diana was outgoing, hated the protocol, the stiffness and almost total lack of emotion, love, or family.  She was everything they hated but everything they needed.  Of course they really never understood that and even today they have little grasp of how outdated they are as an institution.  This is a totally dysfunctional family and you see Prince Charles as a grown man incapable of making his own decisions because he must get permission from the Queen.  Prince Phillip -- one minute he is husband and the next he is subject, but clearly he is the most isolated of all -- and likes it that way -- unless he doesn't get his way.  These are living anachronisms and Mirren manages to convey that even they are beginning to realize that.<br /><br />The Tony Blair character (Sheen) is well done and really shows the schizophrenic attitude the Brits have toward the Royal Family.  The PM of England is certainly one of the most powerful men in the world, yet we see him bowing and (gag) kneeling to kiss the hand of the sovereign.  It shows how he has the power but his power is fleeting while the royal family has the influence which remains as long as the monarchy exists.  Which the film clearly shows is on shaky ground due to the isolation of the royal family.<br /><br />I only gave this 4 stars because I thought the cinematography was distracting at times and there were too many gratuitous shots of Diana, but Mirren's performance is well worth the price of admission.</p></br><a href="../users/AHABFECTNE15I.html">AHABFECTNE15I</a><br/><p>Version: U.S.A / Region-A<br />VC-1 BD-25 / Advanced Profile 3<br />Running time: 1:43:22<br />Movie size: 21,16 GB<br />Disc size: 24,75 GB<br />Average video bit rate: 19.79 Mbps<br /><br />LPCM Audio  English  4608 kbps  5.1 / 48kHz / 16-bit / 4608kbps<br />Dolby Digital Audio  English  640 kbps  5.1 / 48kHz / 640kbps<br />Dolby Digital Audio  English  192 kbps  2.0 / 48kHz / 192kbps<br />Dolby Digital Audio  English  192 kbps  2.0 / 48kHz / 192kbps<br />Dolby Digital Audio  Spanish  192 kbps  2.0 / 48kHz / 192kbps<br /><br />Subtitles: English / Spanish<br />Number of chapters: 17<br /><br />#2 Commentary Tracks<br />#The Making of The Queen<br />#Movie Showcase</p></br><a href="../users/AG8U6F6226GBZ.html">AG8U6F6226GBZ</a><br/><p>While the acting and the story are mesmorizing, and Helen Mirren and Michael Sheen are perfect as the characters they play in the film, the story certainly displays what a total ditz the royal family is.  In an era where royalty is long out of vogue, the British royals seem not to have noticed.  They think they are beyond human beings.  The Queen cares less for Diana's tragic young death than for a poor stag that's been shot in the mountains.  She's either gone senile or she's batty.  Her husband is even worse as an arrogant, snob who makes crass remarks when he hears of Diana's death.<br /><br />The fact that their son was responsible for the break up of his marriage to Diana because of his adulterous relationship with a married woman and his jealousy over Diana's raport with the people  shows an insensitivity on the royals part beyond belief.  In a family who should have held their spoiled son responsible for Diana's troubles, blamed him only for not keeping her feelings over his infidelity under wraps.  While the country was in grief, the royals snubbed them, looking down upon their so called subjects with no feeling whatsoever.  Charles was not the only one whose marriage broke up.  As I recall the Queen's sister was also divorced, and her other son, Andrew divorced Fergie, so they have little to be proud of in family matters.<br /><br />It's a very good movie and a good reason to get rid of old time royalty.  They should disperse their unbelievabe billions in cash, land, homes and jewels and give it back to their people from whence it came and settle down in a cottage somewhere in the Scottish Highlands.  If they want to keep their mouths shut, and their lives separate from their countrymen, let them return  their wealth to the people and go away.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FBIF1FKBC193.html">A2FBIF1FKBC193</a><br/><p>Ok .... trust me .. to make the 'nutter' royal family seem even slightly interesting or symapthetic is a a challenge to say the least....<br /><br />I KNOW that when Diana died the COLD BLOODED SHREW of a Queen was upset at her vacation  being interrupted with the funeral arrangements that nothing but homosexuals and glitterati would attend, Elton John was mentioned, not a single tear was shed. Matter of fact the movie portrays that Queen Elizabeth was more dismayed at a 14 point stag being killed on her Balmoral estate by a commercial 'stock broker' hunter, than the violent death of her ex-daughter-in-law!<br /><br />Matter of fact this COLD BLOODED SHREW of a Queen, I know I should let you know how I really feel, could not shed a singe tear for Diana she was practically catatonic and weeping like Niagara when the British Navy retired her damned royal yacht the 'Brittanica' ... I saw it in the flesh!<br /><br />Helen Mirren portrayed Queen Liz ... well fabulous is an understatement! She did deserve and academy award...<br /><br />Now the twofer was Micheal Sheen .... no no not one of the US Sheen family ... google it OK ... who played Tony Blair. Most certainly along with Mirren he is central in this movie and should also have won Academy accolades. Micheal Sheen won awards for the London stage play 'Amadeus' and has appeared in an ecclectic group of flicks such as 'The Four Feathers', 'The Kingdom of Heaven', and 'Blood Diamond'.<br /><br />Nuff said .. it's a twofer !!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A2F3SXHT6RBV81.html">A2F3SXHT6RBV81</a><br/><p>Nothing could be me fitting to see a movie about British politics on the U.S.A. election day in the rain.  The title of this movie was deceptive as it concentrated almost exclusively on the week after Daian was killed in the car crash in Paris.  When I bought the ticket, I said "I have come to see the Queen."<br /><br />We met her (played superbly by Helen Mirren) on Tony Blair's first day in office.  After being elected as Prime Minister of Britain, he is shown down on his knee asking Queen Elizabeth's permission to be "her" Prime Minister.  It was a factitious meeting to say the least.<br /><br />The actor who portrasyed Blair was cute (showed a lot of teeth) and matured as the events occurred and he had to speak to the world on the family's behalf.  He was marvelous.  Diana died August 30, 1997, a lovely but deluded young woman who'd been ostracized by the royal family.  The monarchy watched t.v. like the rest of the world as they stayed in seclusion out in the country.  The Queen had deemed it a private Spenser family funeral, even though Charles had to remind her  of their responsibility, that Diana had been the loving mother of the future King of England.<br /><br />As the Queen finally came to terms that she must make an appearance by September 4th, as worldwide disapproval was increasing, she shed a few tears (as I did when my ex mother-in-law died) and a beautiful stag appeared as a prominition.  It showed her humanity, though the whole family were old fashioned and set in their ways:  harsh, uncaring, in denial, thinking only of themselves instead of the two sons of Diana.<br /><br />Blair carried on in a remarkably mature manner which won him many American admirers; almost ten years since those happenings, and he will retire in 2007.  He is almost as great now as Winston Churchill, even with his pajama top on which BLAIR was on the back.  He had a supportive wife and called Diana "the people's princess."  Plans were changed from private to a public funeral despite the Queen's cold attitute.<br /><br />It was very moving to see her looking at the mountain of flowers outside the gates of Balmoral Castle and to have her stand, "the flag," at half staff.  It was a minute-by-minute, day by day account of that terrible tragedy and repercussions in September, 1997.  We will always remember the televised coverage just as we watched the beautiful wedding some years prior, which led up to this miserable day, and the funeral proceedings of JFK in 1962.<br /><br />Some things are so remarkable that you can't get them erased from your memory, and the pain is always there.  I wasn't expecting this when I went to the movie, as I avoid painful memories in my subconscious as much as I can.  I could not see the 9-11 movie, but sometimes after we re-live emotional, painful situations there is a cleansing which is theraputic -- and this movie fits the bill in that aspect.  Go see it, or buy the video.  It is a good, though different, interpretation of how Diana was finally made a "Queen" in spirit.  Long Live The Queen in Heaven and on earth.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VQBHHXIKHIGS.html">A1VQBHHXIKHIGS</a><br/><p>Right off the bat, let me say that I'm probably the only Di hater to review this movie here.  Oh, do I hate the hype around that Princess Di bitch.  I wanna puke like a bulimic.<br /><br />I believe I heard this movie isn't always historically accurate, but I guarantee you it's true to the characters.  Brilliant performances by everybody, not just The Queen herself.  I laughed out loud at the understated yet biting British wit, and the drama was compelling despite being driven by, well, Di.  I love this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>Sometimes it's a hit or miss with directors, and with Stephen Frears at the helm the odds of a film being a success versus failure are about fifty/fifty. He has given us some excellent cinema such as High Fidelity, Dangerous Liaisons, and The Grifters. But sometimes his movie eye misses the mark or lacks an intriguing or well-rounded story. Mrs. Henderson Presents, Mary Reilly, and Hero are just a sprinkling of Frear films that had a good shot at being great, but ultimately failed in coherency, pacing, or some other aspect.<br /><br />THE QUEEN is certainly a film with some great acting. Helen Mirren is spot-on as Queen Elizabeth II, as was Michael Sheen in his portrayal of Tony Blair. But from here the cast sags quite a bit. James Cromwell picked up the part of Prince Philip, but seemed very out of place since he has been typecast in such things as The West Wing TV series and The Sum of All Fears flick. And Sylvia Syms (as The Queen Mother) and Alex Jennings (as Prince Charles) were difficult to see in their respective roles since they are still in the public eye. Although Queen Elizabeth is still in the spotlight, Helen Mirren's strong portrayal made that role much easier to swallow.<br /><br />Fresh subjects are tough to hit upon anyway, and you have to give credit where it is due; Stephen Frears certainly deserves some acclaim for simply attempting to make a film about the Royal Family and their reaction (or non-reaction) to Princess Diana's accidental death. But herein lies another problem: plot. There isn't one. The Queen is a reactionary tale, focusing mainly on Queen Elizabeth and the newly installed Prime Minister Tony Blair, and how each of them views the country's response to Di's death. Of course, the Queen deals with it by not dealing with it. While Mr. Blair continually tries to save the monarchy from self-destructing due to their own ignorance of the peoples' grief. But there isn't a definitive beginning, middle and ending to the story. It's character study of the monarchy will probably be boring to many, especially in the beginning. Most viewers may feel like dozing off after the first twenty minutes of disinteresting royal uppityness.<br /><br />Although the beginning and middle of the film lag, the ending picks up just enough to make it watchable. The excellent shots of Balmoral Castle and its Scottish surroundings were fairly awesome, as were some analogies regarding the royal deer that roam the outback wildlands.<br /><br />If you enjoy a good modern day character study, and are interested in the current monarchy, you'll probably eat this film up. But if you're eager for something plot-driven and deeply intriguing, you best look elsewhere.</p></br><a href="../users/A39AWL2FKWDFK6.html">A39AWL2FKWDFK6</a><br/><p>Director Stephen Frears using reels of archival footage created an insightful pseudo documentary surrounding the drama played out around the British royal family in the wake of the tragic death of Princess Diana.<br /><br />Helen Mirren was at her frumpy and matronly best portraying Queen Elizabeth trapped in the quagmire of tradition in attempting to respond to Diana's demise.  The royals were represented as a privileged and aloof lot severely misjudging the outpouring of emotion of the British people indicative of their affection for the beloved princess.  This was shown most clearly through the heartless response of Prince Philip played by veteran actor James Cromwell.<br /><br />While Prince Charles was played sympathetically by Alex Jennings, the real savior of the Brits was newly elected prime minister Tony Blair played superbly by Michael Sheen.  Blair while wafting through the proper etiquette in dealing with the queen, accurately judged the emotion of the British populace.  The Queen's lack of a public response to the tragedy was eroding her support throughout the country.  New kid on the block Blair advised the Queen to show some unrestricted emotion and compassion, which she ultimately did.<br /><br />The movie featured a myriad of excellent acting performances yet tended to drag as this unforgetable calamity and drama played out before the unobscured view of the television cameras.</p></br><a href="../users/A2WB4OWBUH2VQX.html">A2WB4OWBUH2VQX</a><br/><p>I had great expectations for this film but I was disappointed with it.<br /><br />I actually thought that the Tony Blair character was better acted than the Queen character acted by Helen Mirren. (BTW, I think Meryl Streep got robbed of another Oscar). The Queen's character is flat and one-dimensional and as the viewer, one cares nothing about her so-called internal struggles.<br /><br />The cinematography was nothing special, the score was practically nonexistent and definitely forgetable, and the MTV-like connecting of real television images and the actors was not a smooth and seamless presentation.<br /><br />And then there's the story itself....ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ.<br /><br />I'd skip this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A25PM9JGHPU8EI.html">A25PM9JGHPU8EI</a><br/><p>To be sure, the performances are all high-caliber (although Judi Dench was ROBBED of an Oscar). But really, who cares about this? I really hoped this would have been a deeper character study of the life of "The Queen", but instead all you get is a sliver as it relates to the death of Diana. I sat in a theater thinking, "Is this IT?". This is nothing but an A&E-type channel docudrama with higher production values. How it ascended to the level of "respectability" it has boggles the mind.</p></br><a href="../users/A461VTLW9G9YB.html">A461VTLW9G9YB</a><br/><p>I guess I expected something else from this movie.

Sort of like water to a goldfish, she's always been "there" but I never thought much about her.  Until Diana's death and then my focus was on Diana.  Now this film has switched my focus to the Queen.  Hmmm.<br /><br />There's no doubt that Mirren's performance was superb and certainly Oscar worthy.  She's a classy lady and the class shows up here.  The one thing that worries me, though, is that she may have infused the character of Elizabeth with some of her own generous humanity, thus making her more friendly than she really is. I found myself much more sympathetic to her at the end of the film than I was in the beginning.  Even the doltish Prince Phillip seemed sort of harmlessly quaint and even humorous. Were these people really that nice?  Who knows?<br /><br />I have found this to be a problem in many films---I loved John Lone as the Last Emperor of China but was the real emperor really that sweet?  Doubt it. Also, Sir Thomas More....After watching Paul Scofield in A Man for All Seasons, anyone would immediately vote for More's sainthood.  Yet, we read that the real Thomas had a dark side that the film doesn't show.<br /><br />Like Marlon Brando's performance of the Godfather did a lot to glamorize  guys who probably were really an ugly bunch of thugs.<br /><br />So....I think it's important to see these "historical" movies, enjoy them, but keep an open mind about the veracity of the characterizations.  Film actors are by nature, attractive people, and it's a mistake to attribute their innate likableness to the people they portray.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>Long live Helen Mirren.<br /><br />It is a complete mystery to me why Helen Mirren and Meryl Streep don't work more. They are easily the two best actresses working in film. I would think directors would be bending over backward for the opportunity to work with these two accomplished thespians. Instead, they are more easily able to get films with Kirsten Dunst and Julie Stiles made. Amazing. It just isn't the same, folks. It isn't the same.<br /><br />"The Queen", the new film from director Stephen Frears ("Dirty, Pretty Things", "The Crying Game"), concentrates on the week after Princess Diana's death. As the film progresses, we watch Queen Elizabeth (Helen Mirren), Prince Phillip (James Cromwell) and Prince Charles (Alex Jennings) deal with the loss of someone in their lives as you would expect British Royalty to deal with such a thing, with a stiff upper lip. But this period is also significant in British history for another reason; a new Labour Prime Minister has just been elected. Tony Blair (Michael Sheen) recognizes Diana's death will not remain the isolated family affair the Royals insist it will be. Through many conversations, Blair attempts to get the Queen to make some sort of statement regarding her former step-daughter's death, to make some sign for the benefit of a grieving public. But as she and the family are spending the summer at their estate in Balmoral, Scotland, she remains steadfast in her feeling that this is a private family affair and any public grief will soon wear off.<br /><br />"The Queen" is a remarkable film for two reasons; the first and foremost is Helen Mirren. She is, once again, superb. If she isn't at least nominated for an Oscar, there is something seriously wrong with the whole system.<br /><br />There is some humor in the film, but it is derived from watching the rigid ceremony and outdated tradition surrounding the family. Mirren could easily have portrayed the role as a jokey, caricature of the Queen, but her performance is much better, much more layered than that. She successfully paints a portrait of the Queen, and what her life is as a Royal, making the character, both good and bad, seem real. As she portrays the monarch, we watch as she moves through a life surrounded by tradition, a cocoon of advisors and servants, buffering her from the public, further reinforcing her feelings everything is going well. Convinced she is right, she doesn't heed the advice of her new Prime Minister, a figure she clearly `tolerates'. But as he continues to press the case, she gradually realizes he may be speaking the truth.<br /><br />Mirren does a brilliant job of making us understand this woman's feelings. It seems perfectly understandable she would be so reluctant to believe the public does not require some statement from the Royal family, this is a private family affair and the British people are stalwart and dignified. As she gradually, very gradually, realizes perhaps she does need to address the public, this also makes sense. She remembers she is in the public eye, a spokesperson for the people, perhaps she should say something.<br /><br />You have to remember Queen Elizabeth is part of a monarchy that has ruled England for centuries. There are traditions involved with the position and her life has been very different from a normal person. So, while her behavior may seem odd at first, we understand it through Mirren's performance. We certainly may not agree with it, but we see how it could happen. Throughout, there are many references to this, reminding us of the tradition the House of Windsor is steeped in.<br /><br />Mirren is simply outstanding. Have I said that already?<br /><br />The other person who is largely responsible for this film's success is director Stephen Frears. He keeps the film moving at a fast clip and the film is more entertaining for it. Usually, when you go to a biopic, you expect the film to reach the 2 hour plus mark. "The Queen" is a sprightly 95 minutes long. Because of this, Frears smartly concentrates on the week after Diana's death. He doesn't attempt to paint a complete picture of the monarch's life, choosing instead to illuminate this period. Because of this choice, we actually learn more about Queen Elizabeth and her family. The tragedy of Diana's death makes everything seem a little amplified, as though they are experiencing things they would normally experience over the course of a couple of years. Throughout, as we watch them deal with their traditions, and each other, we learn a lot about the traditions of their family, and the history.<br /><br />Shortly after we meet the Queen and her new Prime Minister, the film abruptly shifts to the night of Diana's death. We watch as various images pop up, giving us an accurate feeling of what that night was like. Because Frears uses a quick series of images, we do some of the work, filling in the blanks with our imagination. It is an effective trick and works well to give us information and to keep the film moving along.<br /><br />Throughout the film, the focus shifts back and forth from the Queen and the Windsors, to Blair, his staff and his wife. We quickly realize that Blair is trying to get through to the Queen for a number of reasons. The most important is that he genuinely feels the public needs to hear from her. But the political cache of getting the Queen to change her ways is not lost upon the young Labour official. When this eventually happens, a small smile crosses his lips. His wife is also incredulous about why he would care so much about the Queen. He notes that without her, he would not be possible, so it is in his best interest to help her maintain an air of dignity. I bring this up because it shows Frears is also interested in showing the politics of England at this time, and how all of these events affect one another.<br /><br />"The Queen" is a great film, much more sprightly, interesting and human that the traditional biopic. Now it is up to you to discover what the thousands of people who have been packing the limited engagement theaters have already discovered.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GCHG6U8HTVIT.html">A2GCHG6U8HTVIT</a><br/><p>What an incredible comedy of manners and position this is. Yet it manages a conclusion which is touching. Diana dies. The British public (and many elsewhere) go into a genuine spasm of grief. The Queen (Helen Mirren) and the royals completely misread the situation and are determined to keep things private with no undignified displays of emotion. They are such a conventional, mundane family. Plus, of course, they detested Diana. Tony Blair (Michael Sheen), newly in as Prime Minister, reads the situation correctly but has to find a way to bring the Queen to understand the seriousness of how the public is beginning to react to her remoteness. And it's all inside stuff.<br /><br />The Queen is portrayed as absolutely clueless at first, a product of her upbringing, a captive of what she feels "duty" is. Emotionally, she is so closed in...so "English"...that one can realize what a repressed childhood Charles must have had with a bully for a father and a mother unable to express love easily. Philip is not just a bully, he is full of blustering royal certitude. Charles is well-intentioned, more intuitive than you'd think and weak. Blair is irritatingly ingratiating but right. Cherie Blair, his wife, is an anti-monarchist with sharp teeth, an unpleasant piece of work.<br /><br />It's a lot of fun.<br /><br />Stephen Frears has made one of his best films, and that's saying a lot for the director of such off-beat and excellent movies as My Favorite Laundrette, Prick Up Your Ears, Sammy and Rosie Get Laid, The Grifters, High Fidelity and Dirty Pretty Things.<br /><br />What a last few months Helen Mirren has had. She does a wonderful job as Elizabeth II. It's no superficial performance. We're amazed at Elizabeth's inability to grasp the change in how the people want her to behave, then her eventually conceding the point to Blair, and then her ability to carry off what is required. Compare Mirren's job as Elizabeth II with her performance as Elizabeth I in 2005. Then compare her performance (from what I've read of it) as Jane Tennison in the upcoming Prime Suspect 7. At 61, Mirren is blowing the competition away.</p></br><a href="../users/AUHG8KSHI529U.html">AUHG8KSHI529U</a><br/><p>This really is a very good movie and I think Helen Mirren is wonderful in this performance.  Frankly, I prefer her portrayal of this Elizabeth to her fine performance of the first Elizabeth.  Of course, this is a more personal and private story and it is the intimacy without all the accoutrements of history that I enjoyed so much.<br /><br />I suppose it helps to have at least a passing understanding of the British system of government, its society, and the function of the Queen and the Royal Family.  If you are a thoroughgoing Republican (in their sense - that is anti-monarchist) you probably cannot work up much interest or sympathy for the Queen and much of what the movie offers will simply not be available to you.  So, I hope you can see her as a woman, a real person, who is in this position in her government and in history.  Notice how she came to the throne as a very young woman (only talked about, but not shown in the movie - but can be found on the BBC website).<br /><br />The story centers around the events of the coming to power of Tony Blair (Michael Sheen) as Prime Minster and the death of Princess Diana.  The Queen, being raised during more austere times, particularly the furnace of the Second World War, did not believe in public displays of emotion or grieving.  Add to that the fact the Diana was really no longer a member of the Royal Family when she died.  It was felt that her death was a private affair.  The Queen and her family are steeped in tradition and were following its protocols perfectly.  They in no way were intending to minimize or insult Diana's memory.  Prince Philip (James Cromwell) is quite supportive of tradition and the Queen, but seems quite oblivious to the world outside the grounds of Balmoral or the other palaces.<br /><br />What they did not appreciate was the way the public had taken Diana to its collective heart.  She was a celebrity even more than royalty and the public felt a loss that required the Queen to participate in a new way.  According to the movie, it was Tony Blair, with some help by Prince Charles (Alex Jennings), who played the key role in helping them understand this new requirement.  It was actually a new and heavier burden the public placed on the Royal Family, but the public did not and does not care.<br /><br />I especially liked the way Tony Blair grows in appreciation for Elizabeth and the way she fulfills her role.  The pressures of being Prime Minister almost certainly contributed to that appreciation.  A key scene is when his staff is bashing the Queen yet again and Blair has had enough and sets them straight about the appreciation they should have for her.<br /><br />The most touching scenes are when the Queen is driving her Land Rover around her estate wearing her royal scarf over her hair and being as close to a normal person as she can ever be.  Fascinating.  Another touching scene is her appearance outside the gate viewing the huge displays of flowers and notes the public left for Diana outside Buckingham Palace.  The Queen maintains her public dignity as she reads some very insulting remarks about her and her family, but we know how much this wounds her.<br /><br />The filmmakers have woven actual footage of the actual events into the movie itself and it is amazingly well done and does add to the sense of immediacy of the story.  Anyone who remembers the actual events will still be drawn in by the movie's Tony Blair talking within footage that is matched carefully to the surrounding actual footage contemporary to Diana's death.<br /><br />A very good movie and wonderfully worth seeing.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>Sometimes it's hard to watch a movie that receives large amounts of praise. You always feel like your less-than-enthusiastic view of the film will have people proclaiming that you "didn't get it and missed the point". In the case of the Queen, I felt like it centered on an intriguing time, it had excellent performances yet at the same time, I felt it did have some issues that kept bugging me and while I will recommend the film, it just has too many aspects to it that dragged it down.<br /><br />It's the end of August 1997 and new Prime Minister Tony Blair, a kind of modernizer who wants to change some of Britain's established rules, is a kind of fish out of water when it comes to etiquette around Queen Elizabeth II. However tragedy strikes when Diana, Princess of Wales, is killed in a car crash in Paris. The country and the world mourns while the Royal Family remains in their palace without so much as public appearances or issuing statements, preferring to keep it a private matter and not sensationalizing it. The British tabloids have other ideas as they deem it insensitive and stoic so Blair tries to convince the Queen to at least do something in the public before they decide the monarchy is unneeded.<br /><br />After watching the Queen, 2 things struck me: 1) the huge scrutiny that happens in the British Press and their brutal stories that make the paper and 2) everyone acted really well but the film just didn't sit well with me. Helen Mirren is of course fabulous as the Queen and balances that line between going over-the-top primadonna and unemotional mannequin. When she finally breaks down, she's facing away from the camera as if to say even we aren't allowed to see even an actress playing the Queen cry on-screen. Another highlight was Michael Sheen, playing Tony Blair, who infuses him with a kind of real-world sensability since he's obviously clueless about mannerisms around royalty. Of course the big question is did he really want the Queen to look more favorably to the public or use it as a kind of publicity factory. Who knows. The only one I felt didn't click with me was Prince Charles, Diana's ex. He almost feels opportunistic, like he tries to make things look better in his favor. Maybe it was just me.<br /><br />The other flaw I felt it had was a sense of a pacing and repetitive tone. Of course it's a character study but in films, there's usually things characters do to bide time and make the scenes feel intriguing. Here, characters just...talk, and not the kind of meaningful talk it should've had. And after awhile you start to notice characters kind of repeat themselves too much in scenes. The Queen tries her hardest to be sympathetic without giving in to changing values, Blair is concerned at the lack of statements from the monarch while Queen's husband expresses non-supportive news in regards to Diana, her attention and what the public wants. After awhile it feels what a friend calls egg-like: whether it's sunny-side up or scrambled or over-easy, it's still egg in the end. Weird analogy I know.<br /><br />So is it worth a watch? Well many people will enjoy it but for me, I felt it was a well-made but kind of flawed film.

It is well deserved, to be sure.<br /><br />I really loved the writing, though.  Great art delights the observer, as this movie certainly did, but it also provokes thought.  This movie refused to advocate for any one viewpoint on the British monarchy.  It constantly challenged the viewer's perceptions and beliefs about the role or importance of the British royalty, as well as its foibles, and was greatly entertaining in the process.  I like my viewpoints challenged, and that certainly was the case here.<br /><br />Some would call that shifting gears or even audience manipulation.  I would not, not at all.<br /><br />I finished the movie still thinking (as I did before) that the amount of money and attention spent on the British royalty could much better be focused elsewhere, but at least had to concede, grudgingly, that royalty had (and has) some broad purpose.  I was not expecting that from this movie, and was delightfully surprised.<br /><br />You will be, too - this was definitely one of 2006's best efforts.</p></br><a href="../users/A29QA79VLQGHY6.html">A29QA79VLQGHY6</a><br/><p>Should have been the Oscar winner for best picture -- it was by far the best and most involving movie I saw last year.

Lacey serves admirably as a translator for the folks in Region 1, who almost certainly missed many references whilst viewing the film in theaters. It's a highly recommended talk for admirers of the film who want an enriched  viewing experience the second or third time around.<br /><br />The other extras are efficient but routine making-ofs. Mirren says she became comfortable in the role by thinking of herself as painting a portrait, a process in which the artist's role is to bring some of herself to the finished subjective work.<br /><br />Video and audio on the standard DVD release are as you'd expect, sturdy and well-bred.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FG91CM8221X1.html">A1FG91CM8221X1</a><br/><p>F. Scott Fitzgerald famously wrote, "Let me tell you about the rich. They are different from you and I." For the House of Windsor, that difference is magnified a hundredfold. Trained fastidiously to be the living representatives of a thousand years of British history, cocooned from everyday life by their station and privilege, the members of the Royal Family adopted a becoming public dignity and reserve that served them well in the dark days of the London Blitz. Unfortunately, that reserve doesn't play so well in the democratized Britain of the Information Age, which makes them appear cold and unlikable while simultaneously blowing the cover off the times when they, shall we say, strain against the bonds of royal protocol.  Stephen Frears' "The Queen" masterfully depicts the event that finally brought home to the Royal Family the power of the media and the people--the tragic death of Diana, Princess of Wales, in the late summer of 1997. Remembering Diana as a selfish, neurotic troublemaker, Queen Elizabeth II (Helen Mirren), Prince Philip (James Cromwell) and the Queen Mother (Sylvia Syms) have no conception of how beloved she was by the people, simply because she possessed the common touch the rest of them so conspicuously lack. Ensconced in luxurious isolation at Balmoral Castle, they maintain a starchy silence that new Prime Minister Tony Blair (Michael Sheen) recognizes immediately as a public relations catastrophe. Peter Morgan's superb screenplay details the frantic efforts of Blair to get the initially uncomprehending Elizabeth to reach out to her grieving subjects. While Philip and the Queen Mum pressure Elizabeth to stand her ground (Philip mocks the list of mourners at Diana's funeral as "a chorus line of pop stars and homosexuals"), Blair's anti-monarchist wife Cherie (Helen McCrory) urges him to let the Royal Family hang itself publicly as "a bunch of freeloading, anachronistic nutters." This is one of the most involving stories of political machination ever put on film, and extraordinarily courageous in that it portrays still-living heads of state in ways that are sometimes far less than flattering (will Prince Philip dare sue?). All the performances are a resounding affirmation of the glories of British Rep (and in this I include Cromwell, the one American ringer in the cast). But the film stands or falls in its portrayal of Elizabeth, and with the wonderful, fabulous Helen Mirren playing her, it not only stands but soars. Mirren won the Best Actress Award at the Venice Film Festival for her performance, and if there's any justice she should start rehearsing her Oscar speech. Mirren is one of the great living masters in portraying deep emotion behind a dignified facade, and "The Queen" gives her an unprecedented opportunity to do just that. (Mirren's Elizabeth gives us the textbook definition of "noblesse oblige:" standing at the gates of Buckingham Palace, reading the placards that essentially accuse her of being Diana's murderer, she makes the slightest grimace of sorrow, then turns to the assembled crowd and smiles.) "The Queen" is simply one of the best films to come out of Britain in the last decade. I would love to see a double feature of this film and "The Madness of King George"--in which Mirren played Queen Charlotte, the consort of George III. The House of Windsor might rebel at such an event, but the rest of us would be in for a treat.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ0EO10KTRJ4V.html">AQ0EO10KTRJ4V</a><br/><p>Let me start by saying I think the idea of a Queen in modern times is a bit outdated and silly, however this film reminds us of something even MORE SILLY.... and that is the modern fascination of the general public over celebrities.<br /><br />It is amazing and unbelievable to me that the media has been able to generate such a "mythological importance" to Princess Diana that people in the general public who of course never knew her will camp out in the streets, cry and mourn for a literal stranger they have only seen in the news.<br /><br />It's a weird modern mass media phenomenon.<br /><br />This film reminds me of how the Queen was unfairly criticized by the media and public over not seeming emotional enough about Diana's death.<br /><br />Not to detract from Diana, buts lets face reality....... it's a Cinderella story gone bad.<br /><br />She was an immature girl who married into royalty, never appreciated the responsibility of the role and thus like a spoiled kid lashed out at the century old establishment.<br />Then she tried to establish her own identity as a caring person by being involved with humanitarian efforts while partying it up with controversial figures who she knew would cast a poor light on Mother England.<br /><br />I don't dislike Diana, but I do question the "saint-like" mythology that has been generated about her while the general public conveniently forgets the reality of who she was and what she did.</p></br><a href="../users/A228JH8V9Y700G.html">A228JH8V9Y700G</a><br/><p>I shall begin this review by saying that I was not an avid fan of Princess Diana.  I remember her very well when I was a child with the hubbub about the royal wedding, and she had always been one of the most prominent celebrities that I knew of.  It seems that at any one point in time someone was talking about Diana.  I said at some point that it was just celebrity garbage and fluff, and gave a big "Who cares?" about it.  But if I didn't care, why did I wake up my mom in the middle of the night on that faithful day in 1997 when she was killed in a car accident in Paris?  And watch the funeral on TV a few days later?<br /><br />I did not watch this movie based on a celebrity fascination with Diana or any other of the British royal family, but to see the true flow of relationship between the government houses.  Helen Mirren does a superior job of portraying Elizabeth II, refined and stiff upper lipped to the T.  At the same time, just weeks before, Tony Blair had been elected, the first time in years that the Labour Party had been appointed as Prime Minister.  It was also a very exciting time in England, as there was a sense of change with his election.  Just as Tony Blair was getting his feet wet in his new job, Diana is killed in a car accident.  The UK, let alone the rest of the world, was thrown into chaos.  We looked to the queen to make a statement, but she remained silent.<br /><br />This movie showed the tensions and conflict very well between the royals and the public.  Elizabeth had distain for Diana, to be sure, after the tabloid fiasco of her and Charles's divorce, so she wanted to remain silent.  From another generation of royalty and duty, she wanted to remain silent to show her respects; but, the public wanted to hear a statement as it's a different world now.  Plus having a new, enthusiastic Prime Minister pressuring her to adjust (I love that scene where they meet for the first time and she said "Winston Churchhill sat in that very same chair".), she had to say something.  And she did.<br /><br />The only critical words I have for this movie are for the portrail of Prince Charles.  I wonder how true his reaction to Diana's death was.  It's hard for me to believe that Charles shead a tear for Diana.  After their failed marriage and divorce, I'm sure there were and still are sour grapes between them.  If anything I would think that he would be glad to be rid of her once and for all, because his aunt, Princess Margaret, said it best when she said that Diana was more annoying dead than alive.<br /><br />Still, this is a fine movie that flows very easily and shows a good snapshot of a point in time.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>"The Queen" chronicles the behind-the-scenes drama of the British royal family in the week following the death of Diana, Princess of Wales on the 30th of August 1997. Princess Diana' death plunges the monarchy into an unexpected crisis when public grief overflows into the streets and parks. Queen Elizabeth II (Helen Mirren) considers Diana's death a private affair and can't fathom her people's need for a public funeral or acknowledgement from the royal family: "The less attention one draws to it, the better." Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair (Michael Sheen), elected head of the government by a landslide just a few months before, understands what the public expects and the dangers of the monarchy not fulfilling that role: "Will someone please save these people from themselves?" So he advises, pleads, and cajoles the Queen into making a public tribute in the face of growing anti-monarchist sentiment.<br /><br />Helen Mirren won an Oscar for her portrayal of this monarch who keeps her feelings so much to herself that people tend to doubt that she has feelings. I'm not convinced myself, but "The Queen" offers an interesting perspective on Her Majesty's stoicism: Duty precludes her from ever being partial. She can't even vote. And she despised Princess Diana -with good reason- so was probably not anguished by her death. In presenting Diana's death from the perspective of the royal family, secluded at Balmoral Castle, the film tries to make the Queen a sympathetic figure, a bastion of traditional culture suddenly confronted with a celebrity culture that she does not understand. This does little in my mind to alleviate the fact that Queen Elizabeth II utterly lacks leadership skills, charisma, and is so uncomprehending of her own culture that she erodes the usefulness of the monarchy. But I have to admit that she -or her verisimilitude- is fascinating to watch.<br /><br />We also see the perspective of Tony Blair and his staff at 10 Downing Street on Princess Diana's death and that of the British public, who are represented by real television news footage. In fact, everyone is experiencing the crisis through television. The royals, the government, and the public spend a lot of time watching each other on TV. It's difficult to know where director Stephen Frears and writer Peter Morgan's sympathies lie, if anywhere. The events of "The Queen" resulted from the clash of three dysfunctional parties, though the film does not explicitly say so: mentally ill Princess Diana, emotionally stunted and out-of-touch Queen Elizabeth II, and the British people whose initial expressions of affection and grief quickly degenerated into an obscene display of self-pity.<br /><br />If you're wondering how screenwriter Stephen Marber knew what happened behind closed doors in the days following Princess Diana's death, he drew on his own sources inside 10 Downing Street and those of historian Robert Lacey inside Balmoral Castle. Mr. Lacey wrote the book "Majesty" about the reign of Elizabeth II and served as consultant on this film. Beside the obvious inability to know the precise content of private conversations, some liberties have been taken with the story, including the subplot involving the stag at Balmoral, which serves as metaphor. And a wonderful metaphor it is. "The Queen" is a sublimely insightful film that possesses more gravity than any of its dramatis personae would seem to merit alone.<br /><br />The DVD (Miramax 2007): There are a making-of documentary and 2 audio commentaries. "The Making of The Queen" (18 min) has 3 parts: the cast, director Stephen Frears, and other crew discuss the challenges of portraying real people; the environments of the film as created through production and costume designs; and crew members talk about their experiences of the week that Princess Diana died. The first audio commentary by director Stephen Frears and screenwriter Peter Morgan is sporadic and addresses a miscellany of topics without being informative. Skip it. The second audio commentary by historian Robert Lacey is excellent and very worthwhile if you enjoyed the film. Lacey discusses the film's themes of traditional vs celebrity culture and the perspective of the royals vs the public. He explains the context of events and the meaning of protocols. He tells us what is and is not based on fact as far as it could be ascertained, takes us through the actions of the characters, and explains the politics for us foreigners.

According to the Queen, the royal family should show reserve. It is a private matter. Not to mention the issue involving Diana's children. They should not be exposed to the media and the circus which surrounds the situation. No emotion should be shown. A sort of stiff upper lip mentality. That is after all, what Americans think of when we think of the British, isn't it?<br /><br /> There is a scene fairly early in the picture when Queen Elizabeth II break down and sheds tears. The camera never shows us her face. The Queen would never express such feelings in public, it simply would not be decent, so the camera man and director Stephen Frears give her, her space.<br /><br /> It is because of moments such as this that make "The Queen" seem a bit too real. It is a docudrama but somehow it feels like a documentary, we know it's not, but the movie, especially screenwriter Peter Morgan, seem to know too much. How did they acquire this information? This is what I became most impressed with as I watched "The Queen".<br /><br /> If you haven't heard "The Queen" tells the story of how the royal family treated the public outcry concerning Princess Diana's death and the relationship between the Queen and the newly elected Prime Minister, Tony Blair, whom many felt correctly judge the public's "mood" in how to handle the tragic accident.<br /><br /> Much praise has been thrown Helen Mirren's way for her performance in the film, and she is quite good. Despite playing a real person Mirren doesn't give us an impersonation. She adds something more to the role, truly trying to flesh out the character (I say character because essentially that is what it is. This is a work of fiction despite everything). Some might say Mirren isn't doing much, there is too much restraint. They have a point, but, that's the way the character is presented to us. It is how this character would behave. Therefore it cannot be considered a fault. Instead it is an asset. A tribute to Mirren's performance.<br /><br /> But Mirren isn't the only performance worth watching or talking about. The entire cast, from Michael Sheen as Tony Blair, to James Cromwell as Prince Philip and Alex Jennings as Prince Charles. Each actor makes us believe they are the characters they are playing. Cromwell, while a bit more emotion (usually expressing anger) gives the some kind of subtle performance as Mirren. Each character required the same approach.<br /><br /> But is there more than meets the eye to Frears' film? Maybe. Would it be out of line to suggest "The Queen" is really about Britain's class system? Blair, who won an election based on the assumption he would offer change and fight for the middle-class is constantly at odds with the Queen, as she represents the "establishment", the exact people Blair was voted in to take on. But Blair serves as buffer. His character is designed to show us both sides. Without one side, the country would be lost. Gone would be it's history and tradition and without the other, gone would be optimism. The two need each other.<br /><br /> Frears for his part he does a great job balancing all of this and gives the film just the right pace. "The Queen" never overstays her welcome. While not one of my favorite directors, he has nonetheless directed many entertaining films, which also take on class systems ("Dirty Pretty Things", "The Grifters") but here I think he has outdone himself. This is one of his very best works!<br /><br /> Bottom-line: A docudrama that presents itself as a documentary. At times we wonder, how do the filmmakers know this stuff? All of the performances are pitch perfect, with no one stepping over anyone else's toes. High recommended film!</p></br><a href="../users/A34D06JL7LC6MU.html">A34D06JL7LC6MU</a><br/><p>I wasn't surprised when Helen Mirren was nominated for an Oscar for this film, nor was I surprised when she actually won the Oscar. Her performance was clearly (from the previews) Oscar bait, but what did surprise me was the film gaining an Oscar nod for Best Picture. Even though it had a future Oscar winning performance, was directed by Stephen Frears (who directed one of my favorite films "Dangerous Liaisons), it didn't seem like it would be that good. Having now watched it, I still hold to the fact that it is not that good. The film has its merits and deserved its nomination for Best Original Screenplay, but Best Picture is stretching it quite a bit. I feel that "Notes on a Scandal" should've got the Oscar nomination spot that this film took. Anyway, Mirren plays Queen Elizabeth with Michael Sheen playing the recently appointed Prime Minister Tony Blair. Not long after The Queen accepts Blair as Prime Minister, Diana Spencer the former Princess of Wales dies in a car crash with her boyfriend Dodi Fayed. The world, not just Britain, are shocked by the news of Diana's death and is even more shocked when The Queen and her staff virtually refuse to even acknowledge the death. As her popularity suddenly drops and The Queen struggles to rule her monarchy with dignity, Blair all but takes her place as the main character...Even giving Diana the nickname "the people's princess." Judging by the synopsis, it seems that the movie is an attack on The Queen...And for the first half of the movie, I was thinking that it was. It's not. It's a depiction of how The Queen struggled to rise above her own values and still please her people. I doubt this movie would have been as successful as it was, had it not been for Mirren because she's really the person that carries the film. In a movie that is filled with great performances, including from James Cromwell, Michael Sheen also turns in a winning performance. I'm surprised he wasn't able to score an Oscar nomination. "The Queen" is not a bad film, but I certainly wouldn't rank it as one of the top 10 best films of 2006. It is, however, a short and worth watching film with a terrific performance from its leading lady.<br /><br />GRADE: B-</p></br><a href="../users/A27H9DOUGY9FOS.html">A27H9DOUGY9FOS</a><br/><p>"The Queen" is an absolutely captivating bit of modern history, one told with much restraint and nuance. Director Stephen Frears has taken a potentially controversial subject and instead of playing up the unsavory aspects, going for easy emotion, or turning it into a melodrama--he has crafted an intelligent study of tradition, duty and obligation. This is a complicated look into a tragedy that had no precedent but ultimately redefined much of modern England.<br /><br />Initially, as we meet the Royal family, we see that protocol, rules and tradition dictate their lives. Every meeting, every meal, every interaction has a designated way of being conducted. This is simply the way things are handled, how they've always been handled and how they are supposed to be handled. The death of Princess Diana was not something that could ultimately fit within these prescribed dictates.  Diana, who was divorced from Charles, was no longer a member of the Royal family. In fact, she was seeing someone else. Creating much publicity and speaking openly against the monarchy and for reform, she was a nuisance that had to be addressed frequently. The family, upon hearing of her death, were concerned with the children naturally but gave little thought to anything else. They felt Diana's death was a private matter for her family. The Queen followed appropriate protocol at all times.<br /><br />The public never saw that distinction, however, and that's the heart of the picture. Tony Blair, the new prime Minister, correctly gauges the sorrow of the nation. And the drama of the film comes from seeing the Queen recognize just how beloved Diana was and seeing her people turn on her. She must compromise her values and beliefs to placate the country. She questions what she has always known and her own validity. It may be an unsympathetic outward appearance, but every concession takes its toll on the very foundation of her world.<br /><br />Helen Mirren is simply stunning as the Queen. Regal and unflinching, she is also deeply human. Betrayed by the very country she has dedicated her life to, there are glimmers of real heartbreak. But she never loses control.  This isn't an emotional performance, it's restrained and skillfully underplayed. And there is a surprising amount of humor to this portrait of Elizabeth. Michael Sheen as Tony Blair is also exemplary. He is the film's heart and passion and it's a star-making performance.<br /><br />Somehow, "The Queen" gets you to understand and empathize with every side of this tragedy. Its greatest asset is its evenhandedness and fairness, and I recommend this as an insightful telling of a history stilled lodged in our memories. KGHarris, 10/06.</p></br><a href="../users/A2OU415LB9I5J6.html">A2OU415LB9I5J6</a><br/><p>Shortly after the election of Tony Blair (Michael Sheen) to the position of Prime Minister, Princess Diana was killed in a horrific car accident. As the British public clamors for an open memorial for the woman Prime Minister Blair called "The People's Princess", Queen Elizabeth II (Helen Mirren) chooses to keep everything private, taking her grandsons to Balmoral Castle to help them in their time of loss. Without any word from the royal family though, the British people become angered, and are soon close to calling for the dissolution of the crown.<br /><br />Princess Diana's death was a very tragic event that led to a sense of lost amongst people the world over. It's no secret that Queen Elizabeth II and Princess Di did not get along, especially when considering the fact that Diana was not quiet about her former husband's, Prince Charles, infidelity among other things and was dating a Muslim. Shortly before Diana's death, Tony Blair was elected to the position of Prime Minister, and while things looked somewhat smooth, no one could have expected the hardships he was about to go through in dealing with what became something of a national crisis. Depicting a situation like this isn't an easy task for film, so how did Stephen Frears do with his movie The Queen?<br /><br />Amazingly! With a script written by Peter Morgan (Frost/ Nixon, The Damned United, The Last King of Scotland, etc.) which is actually the second in something of a series starring Michael Sheen as Tony Blair, The Queen is not only a look at the inner workings of the British government in a time of crisis, but is also a look at the differences between the branches of government and the way they think. Throughout the movie you see that the Queen and the royal family are very old school, choosing to hide emotion and mourn in private rather than display their feelings to the world. They also don't believe that Diana should be mourned on a public level since she no longer was a member of the royal family. Then you have Tony Blair who wants to move the government in a new direction, and can't believe the way the royal family is handling this: with a lack of warmth in their proceedings. You see Blair trying his best to do what he can for a family that, from the outside, doesn't appear to want to do anything for itself. Working off interviews from unnamed sources within the queen's employ and staffers who worked with Blair, Morgan crafts a script that catches the nuances of the inner workings of the government in this type of situation.<br /><br />To really bring this out, you really need great acting, and in Michael Sheen as Tony Blair and Helen Mirren as Queen Elizabeth II you completely see the struggles, differences, and even similarities between these two figures. As Queen Elizabeth II, Helen Mirren shows you a woman who is strong and solid in her ways but also worries about her position in the history of the monarchy. Mirren's performance is truly the tour de force of the film, but one also can't count out Michael Sheen's portrayal of Prime Minister Blair. You see Blair as a man trying to lead Britain into a new era, and sees things differently with the monarchy, but still holds the monarchy in high regard. As the people start to turn on the monarchy you see him as a man who is, not trying to tell the monarchy what to do, but trying to help the monarchy through a crisis into a better position in the court of public opinion, and Sheen masterfully embodies this.<br /><br />Never does the movie take a position as to whether the monarchy is good or bad, outdated or what Britain needs at this time. It doesn't examine Princess Diana's life, or who was at fault in her death. A masterful feat for the director, the movie really just examines the monarchy and the British government in this day and age through this crisis. On top of that, the eye for attention to detail is amazing. You see the difference between the settings where the monarch lives and the lower levels of the government reside, and the images of the country side at Balmoral Castle, and the views of the castle interior are breathtaking. Accomplishing this kind of movie in this day and age is a great achievement.<br /><br />If you're a fan of films dealing with history, or the inner workings of government, particularly the British government I highly recommend this film. With superb acting, directing, and writing this film shows what any film dealing in this nature of material should really be like.<br /><br />5/5</p></br><a href="../users/A1I9B4PSCDDWOO.html">A1I9B4PSCDDWOO</a><br/><p>The Queen traced the week immediately after the death of Princess Diana in 1997. The movie traced the motivations and actions of Queen Elizabeth as she totally misread the mood of her country regarding Diana's death and her gradual horror at her mistakes. She is aided by her Prime Minister Tony Blair who almost against himself, aided, advised and nurtured Queen Elizabeth back to reality. It pretty clear by this movie that without Blair, Elizabeth would have suffered major damages to her reputation and name. She owed him a great deal for his services toward her. (Maybe a future knighthood or peerage might even the honor.)<br /><br />Helen Mirren proves to be totally superb in her role. Was there any doubt of her Oscar? She was probably the only sure bet to win. Her performance nailed Elizabeth II right on the money and managed to conveyed the queen's actions and moods following Diana's death. In some way, the real queen owed her a great debt for portarying such a sensitive role. Mirren was well supported by her supporting cast, great script and sublime directing. Michale Sheen was also great as Tony Blair and James Cromwell probably captured Prince Philip's caddish and tunnel vision behavioral pattern down pretty good.<br /><br />Overall, one of the better movies to come out in 2006, Helen Mirren's performance would be hard to beat in any year.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IOJE0W1NXOSE.html">A1IOJE0W1NXOSE</a><br/><p>This movie portrays the time from the beginning of Tony Blair's era as Prime Minister through the difficult days of Princess Diana's death.  It shows the tenuous relationship between Queen Elizabeth II and the Prime Minister and traces the seeming indifference of the monarchy to the tragedy in Paris.  The Queen, Prince Philip, Charles, William, and Harry are at Balmoral Castle in Scotland when Diana is killed, and at first they do not respond to her death, calling it a "private, family matter" and assuming that the public would want them to handle it in a dignified and quiet manner.  Tony Blair (played brilliantly by Michael Sheen) has his hand on the pulse of the nation and he tries to warn the Queen that she is going against public opinion by staying silent.  Helen Mirren plays the queen with wonderful dignity and restraint and shows her to be the dutiful monarch that she is, but she also shows us flashes of the human side of her, such as when she admits to the Prime Minister that she has "never been so hated before".  It is very difficult to portray a contemporary occurrence in a movie, but the script-writer and actors get this one just right.</p></br><a href="../users/A1PW6G3EFXCLFJ.html">A1PW6G3EFXCLFJ</a><br/><p>THE QUEEN is not what I would have suspected to be a great movie, due to its expected docu-stoggy approach and subject matter, but it is -- a great movie. And Helen Mirren's Queen Elizabeth II will forever in my mind be the real queen, she did such a majestic job. The story takes place in the week after Prncess Diana's tragicly premature death in a 1997 Paris automobile crash and leads up to her public funeral. Interspersed with actual news footage of Diana and the grieving crowds, the film goes behind closed doors to look at how the Royal Family and the newly-elected Prime Minister, Tony Blair, reacted to these events. Educational as well as entertaining, THE QUEEN is an absorbing study of how families cope in terrible crisis, in this case, the royal and top political families. THE QUEEN also shows how protocol is handled with the Queen and daily life of her household. Fascinating on many levels, THE QUEEN is one of the best films of the last ten years.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GA09FYFKL4EY.html">A3GA09FYFKL4EY</a><br/><p>It's easy to see from Helen Mirren's performance why the Best Actress Oscar category was really no contest this year.  Still, the subject matter still has some feel of tabloid sensationalism, with its dramatization of political scrambling in the aftermath of the shocking death of Diana, Princess of Wales.<br /><br />No one the movie seems to care about the tragedy itself - only how to secure their personal positions in the eyes of the public. There was no real grief for Diana, and that is indescribably sad.<br /><br />The best thing about "The Queen" goes back to what Ms. Mirren said in her Oscar acceptance speech: that Elizabeth Windsor has weathered so many storms in her 50-plus years on the throne. The movie certainly does justice to Her Majesty's indomitable strength, and the legacy that she is leaving for history.</p></br><a href="../users/A36EW68H08UOCS.html">A36EW68H08UOCS</a><br/><p>Helen Mirren won the Academy Award for her portrayal of HRH Elizabeth II with a performance that knocked me out.

As the film progresses we're privy to behind locked door scenes that are only the speculation of Director Stephen Frears and Alan Morgan - but they fit in perfectly with what we think we know about the house of Mountbatten-Windsor.  In the emotional final act, Dame Mirren's performance becomes even more remarkable as she gives us a brief glimpse into the humanity of the woman never seen by the public eye.<br /><br />Michael Sheen gives an equally impressive supporting performance as Prime Minister Tony Blair, who as the film opens has just been elected from the Labor Party in a landslide after eighteen years of Conservatives. (Blair's predecessors John Major and Margaret Thatcher aren't mentioned.) The Queen and her advisors are in preparation for Mr. Blair's promise to shake things up when tragedy strikes.<br /><br />For those too young to remember the effect that the unexpected death of Lady Diana had on the world - "Princess Di" married Prince Charles, the Prince of Wales and future King of England, while she was a teenager and Charles was in his thirties.  The Prince has a reputation for being very properly British - stiff upper lip and all that - and somewhat detached from the "real world" while Diana hung out with rock stars and made conspicuous public appearances that made her maybe the world's most famous celebrity.  They were married fifteen years, had two sons, and divorced a year before her death in Paris - her car speeding in a narrow tunnel, trying to flee paparazzi.  For the twelve-year old reader: if Anna Nicole had intelligence, charm, character, and had devoted years of her life to world-wide charitable causes like the fight against AIDS and land-mines, after being married to the future King of England, well... you get the idea.<br /><br />Anyway - back to the film.  Diana and Charles have been divorced for a year, and when she is killed she is no longer "Her Royal Highness, the Princess of Wales".  In addition, the media attention around Diana and her split from Charles has not been flattering to the Royals.  When Elizabeth is told that Diana's family, the Spencers, want to have a private funeral, the Queen is satisfied with that.  She doesn't want a big "to-do" and, after all, it's what her family wanted.  A recurrent theme in the film is how badly the Queen and her advisors initially underestimate the national and world-wide outpouring of grief over Diana's tragic death.<br /><br />The royal family is on holiday at the massive estate at Balmoral.  While the Queen is away the flag doesn't fly over Buckingham Palace.  But mourners are lining up outside the Palace and leaving flowers and keep-sakes outside the royal gates and Prime Minister Blair correctly senses that the British people think that the Queen and her family should return to London and fly the flag at half-mast.<br /><br />Elizabeth worked for the British Military transportation during World War II and when her father died and she became Queen in 1952, her first Prime Minister was Winston Churchill.  Her Majesty is "old school", and she knows protocol.  Her subjects are demanding a degree of Royal respect and honor which she knows that she would not receive if she were to die herself.  She wants to shield her grandsons from the brouhaha in London - it's bad enough that they've lost their mother, isn't it?<br /><br />James Cromwell gives a great performance as the Queen's husband, Prince Phillip, and Sylvia Syms gets many of the best lines as the Queen Mother. Alex Jennings looks a little bit like Prince Charles - from behind - and he gives a good performance that shows that Charles had strong feelings for Diana a year after their divorce.<br /><br />The best scenes take place between the Prime Minister and Her Majesty - some of them phone conversations.  A subtle, but plainly growing, degree of respect develops between the two of them as they both realize that the other is behaving in a way that is perfectly understandable.  Mr. Blair realizes that the Queen is a product of her upbringing and experience and that she has always behaved in the best interests of her country, while Elizabeth realizes that Mr. Blair is being both respectful of the crown while having his finger on the pulse of her subjects.<br /><br />Doesn't everyone wonder what the real Queen (and others behind the gates of Buckingham Palace) think of this film?  I think they wouldn't be disappointed.  The Mrs. and I give two thumbs up.</p></br><a href="../users/A27H9DOUGY9FOS.html">A27H9DOUGY9FOS</a><br/><p>"The Queen" is an absolutely captivating bit of modern history--one told with much restraint and nuance.  Director Stephen Frears has taken a potentially controversial subject--and instead of playing up the unsavory aspects, going for easy emotion, or turning it into a melodrama--he has crafted an intelligent study of tradition, duty and obligation.  This is a complicated look into a tragedy that had no precedent but ultimately redefined much of modern England.<br /><br />Initially, as we meet the Royal family--we see that protocol, rules and tradition dictate their lives.  Every meeting, every meal, every interaction has a designated way of being conducted.  This is simply the way things are handled, how they've always been handled and how they are supposed to be handled.  The death of Princess Diana was not something that could ultimately fit within these prescribed dictates.<br /><br />Diana, who was divorced form Charles, was no longer a member of the Royal family.  In fact, she was seeing someone else.  Creating much publicity and speaking openly against the monarchy and for reform, she was a nuisance that had to be addressed frequently.  The family, upon hearing of her death, were concerned with the children naturally--but gave little thought to anything else.  They felt Diana's death was a private matter for her family.  The Queen followed appropriate protocol at all times.<br /><br />The public never saw that distinction, however--and that's the heart of the picture.  Tony Blair, the new prime Minister, correctly gauges the sorrow of the nation.  And the drama of the film comes from seeing the Queen recognize just how beloved Diana was, and seeing her people turn on her.  She must compromise her values and beliefs to placate the country.  She questions what she has always known, and her own validity.  It's may be an unsympathetic outward appearance, but every concession takes it's toll on the very foundation of her world.<br /><br />Helen Mirren is simply stunning as the Queen.  Regal and unflinching, she is also deeply human.  Betrayed by the very country she has dedicated her life to, there are glimmers of real heartbreak.  But she never loses control--this isn't an emotional performance--it's restrained and skillfully underplayed.  And there is a surprising amount of humor to this portrait of Elizabeth.  Michael Sheen as Tony Blair is also exemplary.  He is the film's heart and passion and it's a star-making performance.<br /><br />Somehow, "The Queen" gets you to understand and empathize with every side of this tragedy.  It's greatest asset is its evenhandedness and fairness, and I recommend this as an insightful telling of a history stilled lodged in our memories.

The Queen and her family decide that for the best, they should remain hidden behind the closed doors of Balmoral Castle. The heartbroken public do not understand and request that the Queen confronts her people. This also puts pressure on newly elected Tony Blair, who constantly tries to convince the monarchy to address the public.  Helen Mirren gives us more than a glimpse into the hermetic heart of a living queen. Not a single false note, not a single cheap shot. A performance that is as poignant as it is entertaining.  Perfect, real, extraordinary.</p></br><a href="../users/A5TZXWU8AALIC.html">A5TZXWU8AALIC</a><br/><p>As a Yank from across the pond, I only recently caught THE QUEEN and I'm disappointed I didn't see it sooner!<br /><br />This is one of those great films based on true incidents that constantly leaves you wondering, "Did that really happen?"<br /><br />The movie follows what happens following the death of Princess Diana, skillfully showing how the Royals, the new British government, and the media/public respond to the tragedy.  Actual news footage and interviews with Diana only make it seem more real, as well as the characterizations of everyone on the screen.<br /><br />Some come off worse, others better.  I don't know.  Whatever the reality of what took place was, this is a very well-crafted, very compelling story.  I've always loved Helen Mirren.  She was a total Shakespeare babe in the 1970s (I saw some recent paparazzi shots of her in a bikini and she's still got it!), she's been great in everything I've seen her, and I'm thrilled she won the Oscar for THE QUEEN.<br /><br />One last note: as bad as the Royals come off in some scenes, especially Prince Philip railing about Diana and outraged that "homosexuals will be singing in Westminster" (Elton John's #1 song), I wondered if the British press was getting a bit of a pass: whenever I saw online papers from England, they were aghast and appalled at Diana's activities right up until she died (chased by the press, no less).  Diana found ways of using the press herself--sunbathing in bikinis whenever Charles accompanied Camilla Parker-Bowles out on the town--but I thought they were terrible to her otherwise.</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>The film basically focuses in two well decisive moments in England, 1997.

The fictional parts are subtle, the documentary moments are woven into the movie expertly. Acting, writing, direction, photography...kudos to all.

Compromise, hypocrisy, generational clashes and the crudities and cruelties of our current culture are all touched upon by superb actors.</p></br><a href="../users/A10ODC971MDHV8.html">A10ODC971MDHV8</a><br/><p>Stephen Frears's wry, compelling docu-drama follows Blair's strenuous efforts to help the hapless Windsors avert a major PR disaster in the wake of Diana's fatal car accident. Oscar winner Mirren, whose uncanny channeling of Elizabeth's stiff-upper-lip airs is one of recent cinema's grandest performances, flawlessly captures the Queen's eerie old-world reticence. But she also makes her a sympathetic, even intriguing figure. By turns tense and touching, and consistently engrossing, by all means bow down to "The Queen".</p></br><a href="../users/A106016KSI0YQ.html">A106016KSI0YQ</a><br/><p>The cleverness of the premise of THE QUEEN--together with its career-defining performance by Helen Mirren--helped put it over the top with most critics in 2006 when it was released. Even now, when it's possible to look at it with a bit more soberness, it seems pretty nifty. The whole idea of doing a serious and intelligent look at the function of the constitutional monarch in contemporary Britain during its period of greatest trial (the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, and the outpouring of grief it produced and its new demands for a response from the queen) is just about irresistible, and the performance of Helen Mirren in the title role is nothing short of astounding.  One of the key plot devices (the hunting of the giant stag, "The Monarch of the Glen," concurrent with the press and the Labor government's stalking of the queen) does come out as heavy-handed even more than when the film was released, and at times the film does seem a bit too much of a valentine to Elizabeth II. Despite her claims to her prime Minister Tony Blair of not going in for "glamour and tears" in moments of grief, we do get to see her suffering and mourning (both for Diana and for tradition) in private, and she's surrounded by such a pack of stiffs away at Balmoral that it's impossible not to feel sympathetic for her. The film conceives the other members of her family as strictly two-dimensional: Prince Philip (James Cromwell) is a sour bully, the Prince of Wales (Alex Jennings) is an opportunistic whiner, and the Queen Mother (Sylvia Syms) is an addled tippler. Compared with this lot, how could she help but come out smelling like a rose? Fortunately, Mirren is unafraid of bringing out the character's sourness when it suits her, and occasionally makes some wonderfully unexpected withering comments to her secretary (Roger Allam) and to Tony Blair (Michael Sheen, also terrific). Even though this is a plum role, Mirren is such a brave and strong actress that she makes even more of it than you'd think: she's absolutely marvelous in the final scene, where the hurt queen comes to meet with Tony Blair months after he thinks they have scored a victory with the public relations over Diana's funeral while she's still smarting from the wounds inflicted upon her by her people.<br /><br />The big disappointments with this DVD release are its extras. There are some lovely moments on the "Making of.." brief documentary where Mirren explains her approach to the character, but there should have been much more from her and Michael Sheen. There are two sets of commentaries, one from royal expert Robert Lacey that's pretty standard (explaining away all the minor bits of court etiquette) and one from the director Stephen Frears speaking with the screenwriter Peter Morgan that's nothing short of disastrous. Obviously Frears and Morgan did not prepare for the commentary properly and felt that they had said everything about the film that needed to be said, because they offer very few illuminations about their ideas behind the work or the acting and directing; instead, they natter on about such dull trivia as why James Cromwell wears two dressing gowns and how the rooms they used to stand in for the drawing rooms at Buckingham Palace look nothing like the real thing. They come across as every bit as self-satisfied and as unrevealing as the very people the story is about. So skip the commentaries, and stay instead with the fine film as it is.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PBV1899CX3TE.html">A2PBV1899CX3TE</a><br/><p>THE QUEEN is first and foremost about Queen Elizabeth II, but it is also about Elizabeth, the person beneath the crown. To show us that person, it focuses on her reaction to the death of Princess Diana in 1997, and the media circus that followed. It was also about the complex relations between the House of Windsor and 10 Downing Street and their roles in the circus, as ringmasters, barkers, clowns, tight rope walkers, marks, and shills.<br /><br />Though Lady Di looms large in this legend, she is seen only in documentary footage, in interviews, public appearances, and paparazzi shots. No actress even attempts to play her, but it speaks to the authenticity of Helen Mirren's Oscar winning performance that the real life footage blends in seamlessly when ever she is on screen. Mirren was totally believable as Her Royal Majesty. All the little details were correct, even down to how the Royal Corgis obeyed her. A pack of dogs comes tearing through the room, then, with a single command from Her Royal Majesty; they all turn on a dime simultaneously. She had that authority in her voice, that certainty that her orders would be carried out.<br /><br />The second most important character in this story was newly elected Prime Minister, Tony Blair. Michael Sheen played him quite well, capturing his vibration, aided by an uncanny physical resemblance. He might have overdone the bright eyes--like a portrait of a Prime Minister as painted by Keene--but the slight exaggeration didn't spoil the over all effect. Besides achieving peace in Ireland, his role in stage managing Princess Diana's funeral may have been his finest hour. His popularity certainly soared after he declared Diana "The People's Princess."<br /><br />The film shows us the complex relationship between Blair and The Queen, and both their spouses have much smaller roles, but provide little flashes of insight into the characters of the two principles. James Cromwell gives a strong performance as Prince Phillip, and was totally believable as he climbed into the royal bedchamber, saying "move over, cabbage." So much for royal protocol. Tony Blair's wife was skeptical of the whole concept of monarchy, so she was a good foil, kind of a devil's advocate, if you will, for Tony Blair to express his growing admiration for the Queen, and the institution of the monarchy.<br /><br />Alex Jennings played Prince Charles, and though he was not nearly ugly enough--not saddled with the features of a horse--nevertheless, gave a good performance, almost making you feel sympathy for him. Missing in Action were William and Harry, the heir and the spare. They are rarely seen, and then only glimpsed, but this was a very tasteful choice by director Stephen Frears, and script writer Peter Morgan. Just one of many choices that make for a wonderful, well rounded film experience.<br /><br />Finally, I must mention the magnificent stag, in a cameo performance, who may be only a symbol, but a potent one, and one who illuminates just how the Queen always tries to keep a stiff upper lip, no matter what emotions are storming below.</p></br><a href="../users/A18G7GG53G2X8A.html">A18G7GG53G2X8A</a><br/><p>What's interesting about "The Queen" is that it gives insight into the life of a public figure that's actually quite private: Queen Elizabeth II. I obviously have no way of understanding the responsibilities associated with ruling a country, but--at the risk of stating the obvious--I can imagine that it isn't easy. Every decision, action, and idea that's made will meet with praise and/or criticism on a global scale. Options must be weighed for the benefit of her people, not for the benefit of herself or her family. She must be willing to be scrutinized and ridiculed by the media, who legally have the right to attack her character, disagree with her policies, and mock her in general. These issues are skillfully examined in this film. However, I'm hard pressed to say that it's an accurate examination. Likewise, some viewers may be turned off by its consistently dry tone.<br /><br />Nonetheless, there's a lot about this film to enjoy, not the least of which is Helen Mirren's portrayal of the Queen; here's a woman that was raised to believe that the needs of her country outweigh her own needs. While she's diligent and professional when it comes to governmental affairs, her emotions are kept under lock and key. This proved to be troublesome in August of 1997, when Diana, Princess of Wales, died in Paris in an automobile accident. The Queen's immediate reaction is deciding to keep the Royal Family out of the public eye. Part of this decision had to do with Diana's children, who needed to grieve without the press hassling them. The rest had to do with the Queen's disapproval of Diana; she saw her as nothing more than a publicity hound. Furthermore, Diana was technically no longer a member of the Royal Family (she divorced Prince Charles a year earlier). Because of that, it seemed proper to respect the wishes of the Spencer family to have a private funeral.<br /><br />This does not sit well with the British population, who generally loved Diana for her humanitarianism. Public opinion soon turns against the Queen. At the same time, the popularity ratings for the newly elected Prime Minister, Tony Blair (Michael Sheen), are rising; he's been much more public about Diana's tragic death. A majority of the film focuses on his working relationship with the Queen, specifically in trying to get her to cooperate and listen to her people. They want her to make a statement. They want her to raise the flag over Buckingham Palace at half-mast. They want her to acknowledge the throngs of Diana supporters that are leaving bouquets at the Palace gates. She refuses to take part in the media frenzy. In her mind, Diana's death is a private matter; the public will simply have to accept that.<br /><br />It's soon decided that Diana's funeral will, in fact, be a public affair. True, the Queen finds this highly improper. However, she also begins to understand the British people will not let this one go; they want Diana to have a proper funeral, and the want their Queen to show some degree of compassion. The pressure they put on her is increasing, so much so that long buried emotions begin to resurface. Example: while walking through a remote countryside, she cries for the first time. It's obvious that years of royal etiquette have had an impact; despite the fact that she's alone and surrounded by acres of open land, her sobs are forcefully restrained. In that moment, her only comfort is a wild buck that passes by; it's large, majestic, and clearly symbolic of strength and fortitude.<br /><br />At that point, she finally begins taking Blair's advice, much to the chagrin of her husband, Philip (James Cromwell), and her mother (Sylvia Sims). She publicly walks past the piles of bouquets, reading notes written by Diana supporters (one says, "Your blood is on their hands"). She makes a televised statement (albeit a prewritten, mechanical, emotionless one). It all leads up to Diana's funeral, a full media blowout with celebrity attendance, including Luciano Pavarotti, Steven Spielberg, Tom Hanks, and Elton John (who would score a hit with the new version of "Candle in the Wind"). By the time the funeral ends, the Queen's relationship with Prime Minister Blair has diminished considerably. Their final scene acts as a counterpart to their first, in which they meet: the latter is a light, pleasant moment between the two; the former is tense and reserved.<br /><br />Some might think that the purpose of "The Queen" is to portray Elizabeth II as a cold, uncaring, conservative individual. Indeed, her engrained devotion to duty and honor doesn't make her especially gregarious. However, I don't think the filmmakers were attempting to portray her in any particular fashion, nor do I think they were passing judgment on her; instead, they were presenting her plainly and directly, allowing the audience to come to their own conclusions. Maybe it's best that we do no such thing; very few can appreciate the responsibilities and sacrifices required of a ruler.</p></br></body></html>

Over in Japan, though, their horror is much more dark and symbolic.  "The Ring" (an adaptation of the Japanese "Ringu") brings that cinematic style over here.<br /><br />For a basic plot summary, "The Ring" introduces a video tape that, when watched, will result in the viewer getting a phone call telling them they will die in seven days...which is usually exactly what happens.  However, when the tape is seen by a journalist (Naomi Watts) and inadvertently by her son, they become engaged in a race against the clock to try and decipher the tape's mysterious imagery and the real story behind the ring.<br /><br />The dark, disturbing imagery in this film is really what makes it a horror stand-out.  Since we are accustomed to more in-your-face scare scenes, this oblique style proves to be even more terrifying.  The young girl with the straight hair over her eyes, the well, the dead horses, and the horrifying faces of the tape's victims all add up to a cornucopia of disturbing images.<br /><br />"The Ring" is also an exercise in the cerebral.  Not all the answers are given up front or thrown in the viewers' face.  Instead, we are forced to evaluate all the imagery and subtle clues to piece things together.  To paraphrase Hitchcock, what we don't know/see is often scarier than the obvious.<br /><br />Overall, I consider "The Ring" to be a seminal horror film for fans of the genre (right up there with Halloween and Saw).  Given the chance, I would have bumped the star-rating up to 4.5.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JKFUUCZRA3Z4.html">A1JKFUUCZRA3Z4</a><br/><p>I haven't seen Ringu which this movie is a remake of, so I can only judge this movie.  Judging just this version of the story, I thought it was excellent...except for some unanswered questions.<br /><br />The movie starts out with a mysterious death which the aunt of the victim tries to investigate...but during the investigation process, ends up setting up her own fate to die.<br />Once her fate is set, each scene starts by giving you the date...a countdown to remind you her time is running out.  Besides that countdown being unnerving, what's also unnerving is that it doesn't seem like the aunt is accomplishing much each day.  She doesn't seem to be getting close enough to solve this mystery, which she needs to do because her life (and the life of her son) depends on her doing so.<br /><br />Nevertheless, this movie is very engrossing as she comes across each new and bizarre clue.  When she finally unravels the mystery, I thought it was a fascinating story, but also a little confusing, too...which is why I gave this 4 stars instead of 5.  I don't like it when movies leave me with unanswered questions.<br />I still give this a high rating, though, for the entertainment and shock value...especially at the end when you think the mystery is over, but it's not.</p></br><a href="../users/A3I69IXPTDVKQF.html">A3I69IXPTDVKQF</a><br/><p>Remakes of Asian horror movies have been a bit of a mixed bag.  They're almost always at least good, but many times a fair bit behind the original versions.  'The Ring', the movie that started the trend, is actually one of the ones that exceeds its predecessor.  It keeps everything that made <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000088NQR">Ringu</a> good, but benefits from some added angles, better special effects, and deeper characterization on some of the supporting players.  Also, it's not a shot-by-shot remake: in several instances backstory elements have been substitued for an alternate take on things.  In this case, both the original and the remake had equally cool takes on the backstory.  But I've always felt that if you're going to do a remake you just have to do Some things differently so it actually Is a different take on the same idea, not just a reshooting of the exact same movie.  The Ring differentiated itself enough so that you'll want to watch both versions, and enjoy not only the same theme but the differences here and there.  [Note - there's also a third version, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000929VS6">The Ring Virus</a>, a Korean remake of Ringu that came out, I believe, before the American remake.  I've really got to get on the ball and see that one too.)<br /><br />  The basic premise behind The Ring is now one of the best known set-ups in horror: there's a videotape out there, of unknown origin, and everyone who watches it dies exactly seven days later.  In addition, immediately after watching the tape, the viewer receives a phone call as a warning of their fate.  You never hear exactly what's said on the call, but you can just make out enough of it that, by that and the reaction of the person receiving the call (this is one of the things that really made The Ring so great - the tremendous jobs various performers did in reacting to things that aren't fully shown on screen) it really brings an instant air of sinister otherworldliness.  Naomi Watts plays the reporter who investigates this strange urban legend after four kids die after watching the tape - one of them her niece - and eventually comes into possession of the tape itself.  Totally disbelieving of any truth to the supernatural legend, she nonetheless watches the tape, looking for possible clues.  And proceeds to receive the phone call that all viewers are said to receive.  It quickly becomes impossible to discount anything about the legend, and worse still, Watts is horrified to get up one morning and find her young son Aidan (David Dorfman) innocently watching the video he found.  Now it's a race against time to track down the origins of the tape and try to stop the curse before it reaches its fated conclusion.  The trail leads to the story of a little girl named Samara (Daveigh Chase), now dead several years...<br /><br />  The Ring is a multi-layered horror story that gets scarier and scarier as it unfolds, riveting from the start but leaving the biggest and most memorable frights for the end stages.  The visual imagery of The Ring has become iconic in horrordom, including the stone well, first seen on the videotape itself, and the climax is a masterpiece.  Outstanding performances all around.  This is a horror must-have.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ.html">A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ</a><br/><p>Every horror buff knows -- the horror that creeps up on you gradually is much, much scarier the one who bounces out and yells "boo" as it decapitates somebody with a machete.<br /><br />And sadly, most current "horror" movies lack horror, because it's easier to substitute it with screaming blondes, blood, guts and sharp objects. But "The Ring" is soaked in foreboding, creepiness and horrific imagery. Director Gore Verbinski relies heavily on the original Japanese movie for a lot of his remake's flavor, and the result is a slow-building terror that keeps twisting right up to the end.<br /><br />Single mum Rachel (Naomi Watts) is attending her niece's funeral, after she died under bizarre circumstances. Several of her friends died on the exact same day, at the same time, which (surprise surprise) makes Rachel think this isn't a coincidence. So she investigates the mountain cabin all the kids stayed at a week ago, and finds an unlabeled videotape with a series of bizarre images -- and a curse that will kill you one week afterwards.<br /><br />She enlists the help of her ex-boyfriend Noah (Martin Henderson) to help her unravel and break the curse. The secret of the tape is wrapped up in a young girl, Samara, who vanished from her adoptive parents' horse farm years ago. Somehow Samara's evil rage has lived in on her curse, and it will destroy Rachel, Noah and their son unless Rachel can find a way to escape it.<br /><br />Remaking Asian horror movies is one of those movie trends that is hanging on in Hollywood, with everything from "The Grudge" to "The Eye" to "Bangkok Dangerous" getting the A-list Hollywood treatment. Some are good, some are mediocre, most are wretched. But "The Ring" was the first of these, adapted from Hideo Nakata's adaptation of Koji Suzuki's novel (cue cries of "but the original was better). And it achieves the distinction of being almost as atmospheric and haunting as the original.<br /><br />Most of its brilliance comes from director Gore Verbinski, who thankfully did not simply use the name and concept, and invent a teenybopper plot around that. This is actually rather similar to Nakata's adaptation -- Verbinski alters some few things from the original film, but keeps the same dark, murky atmosphere and many of the same scenes. Even the cinematography has a dark, overcast look, filled with forbidding symbolism -- lots of grey skies and overflowing water. It's as if Samara's influence is permeating everything.<br /><br />And what about the horror? It comes from the building tension as Rachel's deadline creeps toward us, and brief flashes of Samara's influence -- for example, that poor horse going berserk on a ferry, or the blurred-out faces of the doomed. The entire movie is infused with the feeling that something invisible and ghastly is just waiting to attack you, and it's just waiting for the right moment.<br /><br />The keystone of this movie is Naomi Watts. This talented actress is virtually perfect as the perpetually worried, perplexed Rachel; as the deadline approaches, her fear and grief are almost palpably overwhelming. Henderson is also good, whether as a flip carefree artist or as a caring ex-boyfriend. Dorfman is the one disappointment -- he seems less like a little boy than a pompous oracle, and he's almost creepier than Samara.<br /><br />Which is saying something, because Daveigh Chase is utterly chilling as Samara Morgan, a creepy little devil-child with black weedy hair over her face, a white nightgown and "Omen" eyes. In keeping with the watery theme of the movie, she always seems vaguely damp.<br /><br />"The Ring" is one of those rarest kinds of movies -- a remake with its own flavour, even as it sticks to the original story. Excellent direction, great acting, and the haunting determination to never, ever watch an unlabeled movie again.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GKPMHV4U64IY.html">A3GKPMHV4U64IY</a><br/><p>This is an American version of a Japanese film based upon a comic.  Unlike The Grudge, which was directed by the same director as the Japanese version, this is a very different story from the Japanese (although there is a quick reference to the Japanese version).<br /><br />There is a rumor of a videotape that can kill people.  If you watch it you will get a phone call and be told you will die in seven days.  When a reporter's niece dies the reporter starts to look into the story.  First she finds out her niece had a secret boyfriend.  Then she finds out the boyfriend died at the same moment as the niece.  There is definitely something strange going on.  As the reporter digs through the story she discovers others died at the same time.  Then she learns about, and finds, the videotape.  She watches it before believing it.<br /><br />But soon the reporter does believe, but not before showing it to her ex.  She starts to become frantic with trying to find a way to break the curse and that means learning more about it.  But when her son watches the videotape she really begins to panic.  Now she not only has to solve the mystery for herself, but for her son.  Her son seems to have some connection to the video and its images and it somehow revolves around a young girl.  It becomes a race against time and the reporter finds a way she thinks will stop the curse.  Will she succeed?  Will she save the ones she loves?  Watch and find out.<br /><br />The videotape in Ringu makes more sense to me than the one here but the story has been rewritten in such a way as to make it work.  Here we have a film that kept the core of the original (the videotape, the ring, and the force behind the curse) and recrafted it into more than just an adaptation.  I found this film to be far better than I had thought it would be.  A pretty good and creepy film.  Check it out.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>The Ring is a smart, psychological thriller about a video tape that possess those who watch it to die seven days later, with the help of journalist and grieving aunt, Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) tries to prevent the deaths of herself, her son, and ex-love. The Ring is directed so good, I enjoyed this film from beginning to end, as always Naomi Watts is great as Rachel. The sequel is not as scary or exciting as this one. The Ring is a well-done horror flick without all that blood and gore, defintely rent this one, a true classic. Excellent film!</p></br><a href="../users/A3KY68OTSNHM3G.html">A3KY68OTSNHM3G</a><br/><p>Naomi Watts stars in this scary and thrilling film about a videotape that kills the viewer after seven days.  During the final week, the victims suffer from terrifying hallucinations and nose bleeds.<br /><br />At the beginning, two friends, Katie and Rebecca, are watching TV when Katie reveals that she has seen the mysterious video.  True to its nature, Katie ends up dying at the hands of the video, while Rebecca, being so traumitized from witnessing Katie's death, is committed to a mental institution.  Katie's death brings in her cousin Aidan and his mom Rachel (Watts), a reporter for the Seattle Post Intelligencer.  Katie's mother requests that Rachel investigate the story behind the video.  The task becomes harder when Rachel watches the video herself and then realizes she may die within a week.<br /><br />A race against time soon develops, as Rachel, Aidan, and Rachel's estranged boyfriend Noah seek to unlock the mystery of the tape.<br /><br />As Rachel conducts her research, more and more questions arise.  A woman who appears in the video turns out to be Anna Morgan, a horse breeder who goes insane after adopting a young girl named Samara.  Also, the images on the tape continue to turn up during the investigation.  What will become of Rachel's investigation?  What is Samara's connection to the story?  Will Rachel die after seven days like Katie did?<br /><br />This is a scary yet thought-provoking film, however, I recommend watching it at least twice.  I found myself lost during certain parts, but with a second viewing, any questions should be cleared up.  This movie goes beyond the traditional slasher film, instead relying on psychological "whodunnit" type terror to attract the viewer.  The ending is by far the highlight of the film.  If you're a fan of psychological terror over blood and guts, then "The Ring" is a perfect movie for you.</p></br><a href="../users/A1C9GCHR99WX3F.html">A1C9GCHR99WX3F</a><br/><p>What would you do if you knew you were in your last week on earth, before your death? Now normally, you don't know when death will come to you, but the characters know when they will die. And the legend happens that if you watch a video tape, you will get a phone call from a stranger, that tells you that you will die in 7 days, now how do they know if you watch the tape? When the movies opens, Katie (Amber Tamblyn), is at a cottage, with her best friend Becca (Rachael Bella), and they can't find something good to watch on TV, Becca tells her the legend of  a tape, and Katie infroms her best freind that she has already seen the tape, exactly 7 days before. Within seconds, the phone rings, and it is Katie's Mom, but before the night is over, Katie is dead, and Becca is scared by her own best freind's death. And now we meet her aunt reporter Rachel (Naomi Watts) and her son Aidan (David Dorfman), and she starts to work on the case of her niece's strange and sudden death. And she question's her niece best friends, a learns of the tape. Which leave her to the cottage that her niece was staying at the cottage that the time of her death. She chesk in at the office, and gets the same cottage, to take a nap in, before she returns home, and finds the tape in the office, takes it to the cottage, and watches the tape, and sees a girl on the tape (Daveigh Chase), and then  she gets the call, informing her "7 days". So now what she will do her final 7 days, she inlists the help of her ex-husband (Martin Henderson), on the case of  the tape. I first saw this when it played on ABC, earlier this summer, and I didn't even realzie it until I bought a copy that the movie is 1 hour and 55 minutes long. Now if you like scary movies, this should be your ticket, or stay away from the Ring.</p></br><a href="../users/ACMAUJEBY6GJF.html">ACMAUJEBY6GJF</a><br/><p>The scariest or creepiest or whatever you'd call a movie that makes you look over your shoulder even in your own apartment for several days after the first time you've watched it. These movies aren't good for my health, including "The Grudge". And yes, I'm man enough to admit it -and my girlfriend having long black hair didn't exactly help it! Hehe, it's not that bad of course, but "The Ring" indeed is the movie that managed to scare the peace out of me for the rest of that day, and with its' flaws (the tape that's never explained where comes from or how was "produced") -well, the movie managing to do so well what it intends to do I DON'T CARE! A masterpiece of its' genre, "Halloween" or "Nightmare On Elm Street" will never be the same after this!<br /><br />Creepy!</p></br><a href="../users/A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ.html">A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ</a><br/><p>This is one of the best spookers I've seen in a long time, perhaps because of its terse, under-written, under-acted style. The actual gore is minimal; it even carries a PG-13 rating. The opening sequence, in which Naomi Watts's niece admits to having watched the fatal videotape, is reminiscent of all the girls-on-Elm-Street flicks, . . . and then, having sucked you in, the film will put you behind a double-locked door with all the lights turned on.</p></br><a href="../users/A2VUP5US1F5HG5.html">A2VUP5US1F5HG5</a><br/><p>If after viewing the weirdest videotape of your life you got an anonymous phone call telling you that you'd be dead in a week, would you believe it?  If you saw this movie first, you very well might. Scary, mysterious, and engrossing, "The Ring" succeeds because it eschews so many staples of modern horror (nudity and wanton sex, gratuitous gore, killers who can't stop spouting one-liners, etc.) in favor of an original plot, careful characterization, and a creepy, believable atmosphere.  Tautly written and seamlessly directed with a standout performance by charismatic Naomi Watts as the benighted lead, "The Ring" is everything most horror films are not.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>Several horror films of the past thirty years or so have become "classic" expressly due to their chilling atmosphere, unusual photography, and enigmatic endings:  "Carnival of Souls," "The Haunting", "The Others", to name a few.  Along comes this flashy terrorfest called "The Ring."  Admittedly, it has some truly disturbing and unsettling moments, including the strange death of a horse on the ferry boat; the emergence of a little girl from a well and through the t.v., to name only two.  Naomi Watts is very good as the heroine, looking somewhat like a younger version of both Nicole Kidman and the divine Lara Parker.  Martin Henderson has a boyish charm, yet soft machismo, that makes his Noah expand beyond the cardboard character he's given to play.  In the version we bought, ten minutes of some kind of "footage" are tapped on the end, without explaining exactly what this footage is or what it's doing on the tape.  Actually, some of the unused footage helps clarify the plot a little better.  The footage suggests that the video tape ends up in a video rental store; woe the viewer who watches this one.  And that's where this movie's strength truly lies---the horrifying video is so surreal and frightening, it's like watching your own worse nightmare come to life.<br />The cinematography, atmospheric music by Hans Zimmer, and a small cameo by the brilliant Jane Alexander, also help elevate this movie.  Watts is good to watch, there are plenty of scares; just wish I truly knew what the heck happened!<br />RECOMMENDED FOR TRUE FRIGHT FANS!</p></br><a href="../users/A2V3P1XE33NYC3.html">A2V3P1XE33NYC3</a><br/><p>"The Ring" is an American adaptation of the 1998 Japanese horror film called "Ringu." The plot is hideously simple: a videotape floating around kills anyone who watches it at the end of seven days. We know this because after the poor viewer gets to the end of the film, the phone "rings" and a voice whispers "seven days." A week later, someone finds the body of the viewer dead as a doornail with horribly swollen facial features. During the final week of life, people who watched the tape suffer from unpleasant hallucinations and nosebleeds. If this sounds like an urban legend to you, you're right on the money. But when this urban legend appears in the form of a movie like "The Ring," it blows hooks hanging off doors or ghostly hitchhikers right out of the water. This movie is full of creepy shocks, claustrophobic atmosphere, and hidden symbols and clues. It even has Naomi Watts, the blond babe from Lynch's schizophrenic "Mulholland Drive" as the main character.<p>The beginning of the film pulls no punches. Katie and her friend Rebecca are discussing the effects of electromagnetic waves on the human brain when an offhand comment about a videotape that kills comes to the fore. Katie looks fearful as she confesses to her friend that, indeed, she saw the tape in a cabin with some friends. After some playful hijinks, we discover that Katie really did see the tape as we catch a quick glimpse of her final moments of life. This tragedy brings into the story her enigmatic cousin Aidan and his mother, a reporter for a Seattle newspaper named Rachel. At the request of Katie's mother, Rachel begins to investigate the videotape, a task that assumes dire proportions after Rachel watches the tape and realizes she might die in a week's time. What follows is a race against impending doom, a doom that assumes additional dimensions when Rachel's acquaintance Noah and her son Aidan watch the video.<p>Research into the tape unearths one strange turn after another. A woman who appears in the tape turns out to be one Anna Morgan, a horse breeder who went insane after adopting a little girl named Samara. Moreover, the images Rachel saw on the tape continue to turn up during her investigations. As the mystery slowly unravels, many questions arise. Who is Samara and what is her connection with this dreadful videotape? Is this frightening little girl a ghost who chooses to haunt through the processes of media instead of rattling chains in a house? How can misery transfer itself to an inanimate object? And my personal query, did anyone else find Aidan as eerie as Samara? <p>One thing is certain: repeated viewings of this film are most helpful. One time through won't do the trick with this movie. You must be patient and pay attention because the answers are do not come easy. I think too many people expected an undemanding slasher film instead of this suspenseful, downbeat exercise in cerebral terror. I for one welcome these fresh attempts to deepen the horror genre. Gory exploitation films and teenage stalker movies certainly have a place (consider how Jason, Freddy, and Michael Myers are now a permanent part of our pop culture), but for those of us who want something deeper and darker to strike us insensate, "The Ring" delivers the goods. The scene where Noah experiences what really happens when one's seven day waiting period expires will stay with me for a long time, and it was all done without a knife, axe, machete, power tool, or whatever else horror film murderers are using to dispatch their victims with these days. I haven't been this unsettled by a little girl since the twins in Kubrick's "The Shining." "The Ring" hits a home run on several levels. <p>The DVD version, with wonderful sound and a great picture enhanced the horrific aspects of the film. Included on the version I watched was a trailer for the original "Ringu" and deleted scenes that provide additional information about the mysteries of the film, including a chilling alternate ending. Regrettably, there were no commentaries or behind the scenes clips for the movie, although one imagines that a "Special Edition" will soon appear containing such things (for extra dollars, of course). If the Japanese public's response to "Ringu" is any indication, expect a sequel to "The Ring" in our country within a year or two. Sequels often do serious damage to the original picture, but if more films take us deeper into the mysterious realm that is Samara, I welcome them with open arms.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M6RVUVZOQZLB.html">A3M6RVUVZOQZLB</a><br/><p>I watched this film because I thought it was another I had seen several years ago. It wasn't. "The Ring" is much more. Another reviewer called it a cerebral exercise in terror. Exactly! What could have been so hokey became excellent frisson (that thrilling moment that makes your hair prickle).<br /><br />First, the premise: An urban legend that watching this particular video, receiving a phone call immediately after watching will cause your death in exactly seven days. Don't we pooh-pooh urban legends? "The Ring" makes us consider their validity.<br /><br />Second, the video itself. Where did it come from? Who made it? How? Why? So many questions, none answered, ever.<br /><br />Third, again the video. What do the scenes represent? The strange, surreal images?<br /><br />That brings in Naomi Watts' character, a reporter doubly bound in the story, first through her son, not unlike the boy in "The Sixth Sense" with his sixth sense for the supernatural. Aiden is definitely attuned to the other world.<br /><br />Secondly, Rachal is bound to the story through her research. Her niece watched the movie and died horribly seven days later. Rachal first watches the tape, then begins investigating the images. One by one she peels off the layers of this gothic mystery/puzzle/freakshow.<br /><br />Rachal's appearance in the movie parallels the changes with the story. At the beginning she is frankly beautiful, cool and assured. As revelations unfold and she begins to experience frisson, she begins a shift in appearance, becoming rumpled. By movie's end she is almost gray, as if psychologically preparing to join the urban legend dead.<br /><br />The viewer's frisson builds. The ending is a nightmare. "The Ring" is definitely a cerebral experience in terror.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT:<br />One of those fast flashes of film reveals this: "Live birth." An intriguing bit of information that many viewers and reviewers missed or I misinterpreted. It explains better what happens at the well between Anna and Samara.<br /><br />A definite see-again movie!!<br /><br />Special recognition goes to Jeffrey Leach for his superb review. Please read his for a great overview of this haunting film.</p></br><a href="../users/AYWSFRCIMOAYE.html">AYWSFRCIMOAYE</a><br/><p>It has some scary and suspenseful moment.s It's curiostiy provoking. The ending is predictable and a disappointment. It's still worth watching.</p></br><a href="../users/A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK.html">A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK</a><br/><p>A truly scary movie confuses you and chills you with the unexpected, the unknown, and occasionally, the incomprehensible. "The Ring" gives you all this and more.<br /><br />This film continues a recent trend in horror movies of taking place in a setting we all know, that likely exists in our own home. We have a comfortable familiarity with electronics, safe and snug with the doors locked. The horror that finds us sounds much like an urban legend. Watch a mysterious, bizarre videotape that causes fear in some, and others to scoff at its amateurish style and technique. Moments after watching the videotape, the phone rings and a voice says, "seven days." Seven days later the watcher of the video dies with a most horrible expression of fear on their face.<br /><br />Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) learns of this urban legend when her niece dies in a most disconcerting way, and a friend who was with her becomes insane. Rachel tries to back track recent events that happened to her niece and friend and discovers an unlabeled videotape in a remote mountain lodge. Not yet believing the urban legend, Rachel watches the videotape. The phone rings, and the fear begins.<br /><br />Soon joining Rachel are her ex-husband Aidan (David Dorfman), and even more frighteningly, her son. Hoping that the story isn't true, yet knowing she cannot wait for the end, Rachel begins following the clues in the video to determine whether there is a way of keeping from dying. We discover, with Rachel and Aidan in a journey that fits all the pieces together, that every image in the movie has meaning.<br /><br />The ending of the movie was a bit of a let-down, and yet almost as creepy as the movie itself. As with many movies, especially horror movies, the ending can make or break a movie and the ending of this movie almost undoes all the excellence of the movie's body.<br /><br />This movie is one of the best horror movies I've ever seen and the best I've seen recently. Elements of the movie are similar to "Fear Dot Com," which was also chilling and bloodier, but not as creepy and ominous as "The Ring." I enjoyed how all the elements of the movie were tied together for those with the diligence to keep track of imagery throughout. Horror movies always play better when ambiance and a growing sense of fear win out over the splatter of unnecessary and excessive blood.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GRN6J64F2C3X.html">A3GRN6J64F2C3X</a><br/><p>I remember generally liking "The Ring" when I saw it in theaters, but thinking that it was somewhat sketchy and choppy.  I liked it better on DVD, realizing that the film itself is meant to be almost as surreal, nightmarish, and dreamlike as the short videotape that troubles everyone during the course of the story.  To that end, everything isn't neatly explained, as the movie is mainly about imagery and mood than linear, coherent story telling.  I should add, though, that I agree with other reviewers here that if you watch and listen closely, you are given everything you need to get a satisfying sense of what's going on.<br /><br />Also worth a look on the DVD is the short companion film by director Gore Verbinski that delves deeper into the events of "The Ring".  In actuality, the short film is essentially the movie's deleted scenes, intercut with shots from the scary videotape.  But it's all done quite skillfully, and it gives you more details about the main characters, as well as some surprising fates to characters we only saw for a scene or two in the movie's final cut (for example, there was originally a good bit more with the guy who rented out the cabin to the teenagers).  Also fun to see is a short trailer to the original Japanese horror film, "Ringu", of which "The Ring" is the American remake.<br /><br />Let me conclude my throwing some kudos to Naomi Watts, who gives a subtle, nuanced performance in "The Ring", yet also knows when simple terror and blood-curdling screams are the things that are called for in certain scenes.  She's great to watch here.</p></br><a href="../users/A18IK6YI6T3RK2.html">A18IK6YI6T3RK2</a><br/><p>This film is hella creepy, it's one of the most disturbing movies I have seen.  It starts with a bang and though it does flag at times, overall it keeps up the suspense.  Watts does a credible job with the lead, but the kid that plays her son is trying too hard to channel Haley Joel Osmant.  Though this story is a take on a Japanese film that was one of the top grossing film in the history of Japan, it feels highly original and I could not wait to find out how it would end.  If you are someone that likes suspense then you will definitely want to get this DVD, but if you see it late at night you might want to make sure you're not alone, it is spppooookkkkeeeyyyy.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NSUJJCG73IRF.html">A1NSUJJCG73IRF</a><br/><p>Director:  Gore Verbinski<br /><br />Cast:  Naomi Watts, Martin Henderson, David Dorfman, Brian Cox, Jane Alexander, Lindsay Frost, Amber Tamblyn.<br /><br />Running Time:  115 minutes.<br /><br />Rated PG-13 for intense situations, violence, and some language.<br /><br />Adapted from the 1998 Japanese classic "Ringu", screenwriter Ehren Kruger continues his success after films such as "Arlington Road" and the "Scream" series with this incredibly edgy, taught thriller.

Personally charged to get answers concerning the grisly aftermath and occupationally energized to bring her findings onto the television screen, Rachel Keller (Watts) dives deeper and deeper into secrets of a video tape that is causing all of this horror.  When her investigation brings her small son (the creepy youngster Dorfman) and her ex-lover (Henderson) into the mix, Rachel must solve the mystery and save her loved ones before it's too late.<br /><br />An excellent, intelligent screenplay by Kruger is projected onto the big screen in a deliciously scary manner.  The film is not overly violent (although you would believe otherwise due to the director's name), but uses atmosphere and tension to create its scares, rather than campy blood and guts.  Watts is very strong in the starring role, showing some cinematic range and displaying a set of lungs that may end up rivaling none other than Jamie Lee Curtis.  While the twentieth century has brought on a barrage of disrespected, simple-minded, and ridiculous horror films, "The Ring" shines above the rest as a solid adventure into a new scope of the genre and succeeds mightily due to its superb direction and cinematography.  Lots of jolts and jumps, as well as one hell of a creepy videotape.  One of the best horror films of the decade thus far.  The DVD version possesses a supremely spine-chilling version of the videotape that is portrayed in the film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GHUN5HXMHZ89.html">A1GHUN5HXMHZ89</a><br/><p>I enjoy good horror movies and this is good. When a group of teenagers view a movie while at a cabin they seal their fate. When a newspaper woman investigates she opens the door to a mystery that may well kill her.<p>Spooky images, dead horses, visions of ladders, wells, and more along with some good acting make this worth seeing.

An interesting premise (based on the Japanese horror film Ringu) and haunting, provocative images ultimately fail to horrify, weakened in the editing room.  The music and the look of the film are chic and edgy --  I'd buy the soundtrack and put stills on my desktop, but I never did get scared, as the impact of horrific images or revelations was often weakened by a confused structure or goofy plot devices.  The ambience was a lot scarier than the plot.  <p>Extras include a nicely done 15-minute movie that incorporates deleted scenes along with Lynch-ian b&amp;w cuts from the video that may be proving fatal to the film's unfortunate but attractive citizens.  Naomi Watts is no Cate Blanchett, but she comports herself believably in the role of an intelligent if emotionally stunted heroine.  The film can be heard in English or French and subtitles are available in English, French or Spanish.  You can also see trailers for Ringu, 8 Mile and Catch Me If You Can.

The same effect was not put upon me, but it was definitely thought provoking and I left the theater with the creepiest feeling.<br /><br /> The plot is known by mostly anyone, and it's known that The Ring is a remake of the Japanese horror success Ringu. Gore Verbinski's direction was very effective. Had to be to scare the daylights out of everyone. His use of mixing subtle blues and blacks fit the films mood, and enhanced my mood while watching it. Naomi Watts succeeds at her character for I was involved thoroughly with it throughout the entire movie. Martin Henderson also pulls through as the side character. The subplot dealing with his and Watts' character was effective. And David Dorfman who played Aidan, the little kid, was quite creepy. His eyes did a lot of the acting. Great performance.<br /><br /> The DVD release is a bit of a letdown. It's near barebones with only one feature and a string of 3 trailers (Although one is for Ringu). The one feature - the new short film that was much hyped - is a combination of deleted scenes mixed in with the actual video tape. It's a good watch, but doesn't reveal anything new. I'd rather have seen the deleted scenes in the normal format. But hey, where is the theatrical trailer for The Ring itself?!<p> After the major success The Ring has had in just its first day of sales (2 million copies in 24 hours), a special edition is expected. Because, hey! More show, more money making. But I'll be there to buy it.<br /><br /> I will close this review with noting ... on the main menu, get the arrow to disappear and select Enter.

Not since Blair Witch and to a lesser extend, Jacob's Ladder has a movie like this creeped me out.  Taking itself completely seriously, there are no moments of humour and that contributes to the crawling terror.  In a gritty, almost monochrome colored setting, four teens die a week after watching a mysterious video tape.  The tape falls into the hands of a reporter, one of the kids' Aunt, who is trying to find out why her niece died.  She watches the tape as does her sensitive son and the boys estranged father.  She is told by the mysterious phone call that she now has 7 days to live.  The race is then on to solve the mystery of this tape, its origins and its demonic hold on the viewers.  Slowly, like an onion, the movies' layers are stripped away with hallucinogenic imagery and strange revelations.  The protagonists start their research on the NET, move to moldy public library sources, and ultimately to insane asylum records.  Eventually, the drama reaches its conclusion with additional jumps and starts all the way through.  Amazingly, this film got away with a PG-13 rating despite it's nightmarish imagery.  Very effective, brilliantly creepy film.  Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A244CRJ2QSVLZ4.html">A244CRJ2QSVLZ4</a><br/><p>"The Ring" is a modern gothic masterpiece that is genuinely horrifying and creepy.  Like the shower scene is "Psycho," "The Ring" contains one of the most bizarre scenes in cinematic history that will never be forgotten:  When the dripping wet ghost of Samara climbs out of the television.  The atmosphere throughout the movie is dark, dank and depressing.  Leaves are changing, cold wind is blowing, and rain is pelting.<br /><br />  Naomi Watts is great as the beautiful, young journalist who is investigating the strange VHS tape that has killed her niece and everyone else who has watched it.  She scrambles to uncover its secrets before her and her son become the next victims.<br /><br />  "The Ring" is a good, clean scare that will continue to chill you long after the television is turned off.  I would love to see a director`s cut of this movie.<br /><br />  "Before you die, you see the ring."  What a great tagline!</p></br><a href="../users/A3JLOIXFM75QNV.html">A3JLOIXFM75QNV</a><br/><p>I love horror films and have seen many, new and old. However, none have affected me so much as The Ring. Not the Omen, not Excorsist, not The Shining. Those films have nothing on the creepiness that this film possesses. Now, I have not seen the original, but I hear from different people that they find that one better, and some, find the remake better. I guess it doesn't really matter. They are probably both pretty intense. Naomi Watts does a fantastic job as a petrified woman trying to stop something horrible from happening. Of course, she doesn't realise what that entails. The look of the film is one of foreboding. At every turn, in every scene. It must be the hue, its this murky bluish grey, and it surrounds the entire film. You never know what to expect. The beginning of the film is awesome, and the end is the most disturbing, creepiest thing I've ever seen. I cannot look at a well the same way anymore. The infamous tape that is in the movie, while not really scary, it is pretty disturbing. I think the soundtrack has something to do with that as well. Whoever scored the film did a great job in setting the atmosphere.  I still would not really categorize this as a horror film. Its more of a suspense thriller. When I think of horror, I think of a slasher film like Nightmare on Elm St or the Jason films. The Ring is on a completely different level. Though it freaked me out, I still loved it, and have actually seen it more than once.</p></br><a href="../users/A27FR2C67JPDRS.html">A27FR2C67JPDRS</a><br/><p>I'm not a big fan of horror flicks but this is one of my all times favorites.  I lean more toward movies like &quot;Misery&quot; than chop 'em up films like the Friday 13th series or the Halloween series.  This film does a lot of scaring without resorting to gaping neck wounds and gallons of blood.  And it has an interesting story line.  The director uses imagery, colors, and builds the tension in a way that draws the viewer in and fills you with dread for the lead character played by Naomi Watts.  This is a great horror film to add to your collection.  The dvd comes with extras that are interesting too.  Give this movie a try and you won't be disappointed.</p></br><a href="../users/AD7IBJCYSJ9EE.html">AD7IBJCYSJ9EE</a><br/><p>THE STORY: A reporter investigates an evil videotape, rumored that if you watch it, you will die in one week. What she discovers is quite shocking. That's all that I will tell you about the story.<br /><br />MY THOUGHTS: WHAT'S WITH ALL OF THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS?!!!?!? Come on! This was a great film! It was spooky, had a great atmosphere, and it had an original story! And to anybody that says, "Ringu is better", well, Ringu is a great foreign film, but I like the Ring better. Maybe because I'm used to English. After all, The Ring was more chilling than Ringu.<br /><br /> PS. There is an Easter Egg on the main menu of the DVD. Press 6 on the menu. Something cool will happen!</p></br><a href="../users/A2TZKXU6Q0EDNP.html">A2TZKXU6Q0EDNP</a><br/><p>A couple of notes before my thoughts about the film:<p>1. There's an ongoing barrage of comments in the reviews here in Amazon with people saying that the original Japanese version (Ringu) is better or more subtle and that you &quot;should see that one first&quot; or that the American version is inferior etc. etc. etc. Sorry people, but this is totally besides the point. What matters is whether this version works or not(in my opinion it totally does) and not whow it fares in comparison. <p>2. Lots of reviewers talk about plotholes and unanswered questions (most of them without mentioning even where these plotholes are and why they consider them &quot;holes&quot; to begin with)...Uhm, sorry again, but maybe you didn't notice that this is a film about the paranormal???? And, as such, it is by definition &quot;allowed&quot; NOT to follow your understanding of reality??? If it did, it would then have to do with something other than the peranormal! Comprende?<p>Ok, onto the film then. Needless to tell more about the story, it's been written in full detail by many others.<br />The Ring is the first thriller-horror film in a long while that has a superb storyline, a brilliant script, and very good to stunning acting performances as well as a great directorial effort.<br />Even though there have been recent great films in the genre (notably The Sixth Sense and The Others) the Ring goes one step further because of its frantic pace that doesnt let up for a single minute. That's a paradox really, and simoultaneously the Ring's claim to greatness because as you see it creates the impression that it's rather slow, but, there's constantly clues added as you watch, constantly the story evolves and the film doesnt sag at all at any given point.<br />On top of that, there are so many ingenius ideas that work to the benefit of the whole plot (the fly that comes alive through the screen, the tape lacking a number print, and of course the fact that it's a paranormal story which finds its outlet through modern technology).<p>The doom-ladden atmosphere is devoid of banality, particualarly the island setting in the film and the brilliant use of the murky weather backround, but overall the director has seriously worked on intimidating the viewers without resorting to cheap &quot;boo!&quot; tactics.<br />Sequences like the one on the ferry with the horse that goes wild will stay on peoples' minds for a long time but the Ring is actually full of disturbing optics that you keep with you long after you've exited the movie theater. The curse-carrying tape on its own is nothing short of an art-piece, surely one that will (hopefully) inspire more films in that direction.<p>Extra kudos for the casting of the film: the kid is a return to the 60s faces in the genre with its almost possesed look in his eyes, as is the girl herself with her tragic grimace, but where the film could have blown it and -thankfully- didn't is with the use of the &quot;beautiful blonde&quot; but she does an admittedly very good job in her part and contribution as does everybody in the Ring in general.<p>Not since the Shining (and that over 2 decades ago) have i come across a thriller that kept me edged throughout as this one did. That, i think, is a heavy compliment to this flick. The Ring is not to be missed by fans of the horror-thriller scene or by viewers who like intelligent well made films no matter what the genre.<br />Another thing that should be pointed out, is that Ring is also an allegory on television, or rather, becomes one whether it's intended to or not. At one point the reporter is standing on her balcony having a panoramic view in other apartment buldings and what their inhabitants are doing inside and sees everywhere a switched on television set. That, along with the fact that evil chooses to use the TV set as its entrance to our world is indicative of what i mean. But, it's not merely indicative, unless you -somehow- think that TV is NOT evil.....<br />Instant classic.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>Its nice to see a different horror film these days.

The disturbing images, mounting suspense, clever editing, intelligent script, and solid direction all contribute to making this very horrific and haunting film a roller coaster ride of terror that stays with you long after the experience of watching it is over.  Naomi Watts is outstanding in the lead role, but all the supporting cast members are terrific as well.  If you like or love the blood and gore kinds of films, then this movie will certainly disappoint you as the focus is on character, story, and mood (which is wonderfully done due to the suberb cinematography, unique special effects, and make-up).<br /><br />This is an outstandingly produced film and one not to be missed.  It is also noteworthy that it's sequel is as equally good and does exactly what a sequel should do and that is continue the storyline and not rehash the original.  Both films belong in your DVD library and are nothing less than riveting.  I and my family, thanks to the PG-13 rating for its disturbing images and not for gore or sex, totally enjoyed this very effective chiller and its sequel.</p></br><a href="../users/AK1OBVI54SY73.html">AK1OBVI54SY73</a><br/><p>Oh what to say about this film? It is basically a film you can either love or hate. I'm kind of in- between. I don't hate it, but I can't say I really love it either. I own it, but only watch it like once every year just to get a good scare, but this movie does not offer too much else.<br /><br />It is scary, I'll give you that. The disturbing images and whatnot we have to see, then the story of the little girl is very successful at giving me chills at least. And the movie itself was something new and refreshing to see in the US theaters, among the other ho- hum horror films that continue to be popped out.<br /><br />But just because a film can give you chills, etc. doesn't mean it's necessarily fulfilling. The actors are just as plain as most horror actors are, the kid is yes annoying, and the ending itself leaves you in discontent. The story ended and I just was not satisfied the way a viewer should. Overall, I would recommend it, but I don't call it a favorite.<br /><br />3.5/5</p></br><a href="../users/A1DZKOOMMJM1MI.html">A1DZKOOMMJM1MI</a><br/><p>There was a time when horror films were fun, scary, and exciting. Lately, they have lost their edge, becoming nothing more than horrendous parodies of themselves-- greenlit by money-hungry producers looking to make a quick buck. Horror films used to cause excitement amongst moviegoers. Now, whenever a horror flick is released, it quickly gets lost in the crowd of comedies and quasi star-vehicles. Frequently ignored at the mainstream box-office but made so cheaply, these films more often than not make a profit, inspiring countless unnecessary sequels, keeping those suited tyrants smiling all the way to the bank. <p>Just in time for Halloween, a handful of horror films were released. Amongst them was "The Ring," an American remake of a 1998 Japanese hit, adapted by "Arlington Road" and "Scream 3" scribe Ehren Kruger. Here is a fine example of a modern horror film that actually thrills, and proof that strong word of mouth can greatly benefit a good film not expected to do as well. Not only is this one of the best horror films ever made, it is also one of the few remakes that actually fare better than the original.<br /><br />"The Ring" is a surprisingly effective and subtle horror film that, through genuine wit and intelligence, stands out amongst the computer-generated messes that pass for Hollywood's current attempt at horror. It's a surprisingly dark film that stands in nihilistic contrast to the feel-good, life-affirming style of horror typified by The Sixth Sense and its many imitations.<br /><br />"The Ring" sets up its central premise with admirable speed and clarity. Supposedly, there's an urban legend about a mysterious, unmarked video tape that somehow causes the death, seven days later, of anyone unlucky enough to watch it. One unfortunate viewer is the niece of neurotic reporter and single mother Naomi Watts. While investigating her niece's death, Watts has the misfortune of watching the tape herself. The premise is beautifully set up in a simple opening scene that uses a ringing telephone and the image of a static-filled TV screen, as well as a pulse-pounding musical score, to whip up a sudden crescendo of tension.<br /><br />Director Gore Verbinski's (The Mexican) visualization of what is on that tape has to be counted as one of the film's major triumphs. He is to be commended for not taking the easy route of filling the screen with explicit but meaningless "shock" images: instead, he creates a creepy collage of surreal but recognizable pictures. They have the disturbing power to get under the viewer's skin with such skill that it creates a feeling of continually growing dread which doesn't become obvious until it's already too late to escape.<br /><br />Having watched the tape, Watts soon receives a phone call informing her that she (and apparently, the film's audience) now has precisely seven days left to live. Refreshingly, Watts goes against American horror film convention by neither ignoring the threat or attempting to escape in the stupidest, most illogical way possible. Instead, she immediately sets about to figure out what the tape means and how she can prevent her own seemingly inevitable demise. Aiding her in this endeavor are her ex-boyfriend Noah (Martin Henderson) and her disconcertingly Haley Joel Osmentish son (wonderfully played by David Dorfman in a very creepy performance).<br /><br />This is the rare Hollywood horror film that actually respects its audience's intelligence enough not to have its heroine freaked out by finding a stray cat wandering around the pantry. Instead, Verbinski gets his scares by filming an off-center vision of a world that is recognizably our own. He has the patience to create a subtle atmosphere that prays not on our immediate impulses, but on the usually hidden fears that lurk within us all--the knowledge that at any moment, our life could end for reasons we'll never know.<br /><br />In horror films, the less you know, the scarier things are. Verbinski understands that the camera creates tension just by moving; he builds anticipation and suspense about what could be lurking just outside the frame, while rarely revealing what it might be. The look of fear so clearly expressed by his characters is always more chilling than any monster he might turn his camera on. Perhaps Verbinski's greatest accomplishment is when the film's main horror finally does make itself visible after dominating the viewer's imagination, it still manages to be as frightening as anything we could have visualized in our mind's eye. Yes, I was absolutely terrified!<br /><br />Though this film is obviously designed to showcase the skills of its director, one cannot ignore how much of the film's success comes from Naomi Watts' performance as a very untypical horror heroine. Playing her role with an unstable neurotic streak, Watts manages to make her character endearing, frustrating and, most importantly, real. In a time when so many horror films tend to present women as either cute survivors or victims born only to be exploited and punished, Watts gives us a recognizable human being who, though understandably terrified, displays welcome strength and determination, giving the film a needed boost of reality.<br /><br />"The Ring" is a handsomely mounted, intelligently crafted thriller that skillfully maintains a tense sense of dread. The crisp editing, fluid camera work, meticulous production design, menacing score and gloomy Pacific Northwest locations all contribute to the unsettling atmosphere, as does Verbinski's decision to use primal horror imagery, rather than gore and cheap scare tactics, to unnerve us.<br /><br />Verbinski and company have crafted an exemplary thriller, and maybe one of the year's best films. I have not seen a thriller as disturbing and satisfying since the likes of Richard Kelly's "Donnie Darko" or Alejandro Amenabar's "The Others."  "The Ring" is a true masterpiece of modern horror, which is wonderful considering Hollywood hasn't pumped out any consistently good edge-of-your-seat films in quite some time. Maybe "The Ring" will help change this. One can only hope.</p></br><a href="../users/AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ.html">AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ</a><br/><p>magine that you stumbled upon an old video tape. Placing it into the VCR, a large glowing ring appears on the screen in front of you. After that graphic and disturbing images begin to flash on the television screen culminating to a final scene of a black and white forest with a well in the middle. Then the screen turns fuzzy and the tape is finished. Sound like another college independent art film right? Well, let's say that your phone rings and the voice on the other end says you have seven days before you die. Just an urban legend, right? What if it came true? This is the idea from the Japanese horror film, Ringu, which was adapted for American audiences in the thriller, The Ring. But will the adaptation work for American audiences or will the creators of the film be the only ones that are scared?<p>The story goes that Rachel Keller is investigating the death of a teenage girl whose cause of death was declared unknown. But she soon discovers that this story goes way beyond this teenage girl's death. Three other teenagers that were friends of hers also died on the same day at the exact same time as the teenage girl. Their deaths were also declared unknown. What is the connection between the four teenagers? About one week before their deaths, they traveled up to a remote cabin in the woods where they had stumbled upon a tape. Rachel comes upon the tape and watches it. The phone rings and the voice on the other end of the phone tells her she has seven days before she dies. She has seven days to discover the mystery of The Ring before time runs out. The Ring has one of the best stories out there. The plot goes way beyond the usual horror fare that is released around the fall season. Unfortunately the ending ruins almost all tension and mystery that is presented in the film.<p>The cast does a stellar job of presenting believable characters and making the fear altogether more real. Naomi Watts is great in the role of Rachel Keller, the investigative reporter who searches for the answer to the mystery of The Ring. Her character is mainly the focus of the film, though not entirely, and she does a wonderful job of making her character both a wonderful mother figure as well as a strong hero. Martin Henderson plays Rachel's ex-husband who helps her discover the mystery of The Ring. Henderson does a good job though you don't really get to see too many scenes with just him outside of a scene near the end of the film. He is usually just playing of Naomi Watts or her character's son, played by David Dorfman. David Dorfman does a great job at giving a creepy feeling to the audience but also making the audiences feel sympathetic toward his character. His character, though, came off as a Sixth Sense rip-off in parts but not too much so. Daveigh Chase, who voiced the character of Lilo in Disney's Lilo &amp; Stitch, is exceptionally creeping and disturbing as the character of Samara Morgan. Revealing what her character does would give away too much of the movie. But rest assured, she does a fabulous job in this important role.<p>Overall, The Ring goes way beyond the usual horror fare that is dumped during the fall season. As good as it is, the film's ending does not do it justice because the ending is so ridiculously stupid that it ruins the effects presented earlier in the film. Not to say the rest of the film outside of the ending is not good. Gore Verbinski, whose next project is Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, does a great job of presenting the right amount of tension and excitement in parts of the film where it is needed. Unfortunately the ending ruins those effects by giving the audience an ending that makes them feel ripped off. There is no real logical way to explain the feeling without giving away most of the plot. There are also many parts of the mystery of the Ring that are left unsolved but they will reportedly be solved in either the prequel or sequel to the film which is expected to open in theaters in October 2004. If you do decided to watch The Ring, you are in for a real cinematic treat but don't have too high expectations as the ending will leave you disappointed.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ.html">A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ</a><br/><p>As much as I love the horror genre, I will admit that only rarely has such a film aspired to let alone attained the artistic plateau upon which The Ring proudly sits.  The movie is an artistic masterpiece, a film whose amazing textures and tones invite multiple viewings and a never-ending search for further insight into its darkly beautiful truth.  I find myself examining everything my eyes run across, trying to analyze the pattern of raindrops on a car windshield, watching in curious awe the rushed setting of the sun behind a magnificent tree, wondering if door number 601 means something, etc.  While the original state of advanced creepiness and awe-struck surprise fades to some degree after the first viewing, The Ring somehow manages to completely captivate me every time I watch it.  The plot is, naturally, a little on the weird side, but it certainly seems straightforward enough for me to wonder why some viewers claim they did not understand the movie.  I don't think anyone can truly pick out and digest all of the subtle implications of the film on the first viewing, but there's really nothing incomprehensible about The Ring at all.<p>I won't even try to describe the plot; any iota of preconceived notions or revealed plot points robs the potential viewer of the complete experience this movie takes pride in delivering.  One issue of concern with a lot of horror movies is of course the ending, and the anticipation one feels sitting down to watch The Ring for the first time can very well preprogram the brain to expect a let-down of some type.  I can assure you that the final plot twists and ultimate ending will delight you and renew your faith in truly original movies of this genre.  I should add the fact that the ending does much to counterbalance the riveting early moments of the film.  In my opinion, the opening scene here is the creepiest, most powerful beginning to a horror movie I have ever seen, and I assure you that this is a very bold statement on my part.  The cast, I must say, is wonderful.  Naomi Watts and Martin Henderson help sell the mysterious truth about "the tape" to any viewers reluctant to suspend their disbelief, but it is the children who make this movie a truly creepy good time.  David Dorfman makes young Aidan a dark and complex little boy who, one might think just by watching him, could very well be Antichrist material.  The mysterious child Samara is the pivotal character in this film, the conduit for all of the horror and psychological manifestations of dread and fear, and Daveigh Chase is uncannily remarkable in the role.  <p>While the movie is a horror masterpiece that sells itself, I am a little disappointed at the paucity of extras included with the DVD.  With so many artistic nuances complementing a wildly unpredictable plot, I would dearly love to have the director or an actor or two offer their thoughts on the process in the form of a commentary.  The "never-before-seen short film" of roughly 15 minutes is good, but I can't say that it really delivered many new revelations about The Ring.  There was one additional piece of information I picked up that works on a psychological level, but overall it is certainly not a Rosetta Stone with which to translate the secrets of the film.  Consisting of several deleted scenes mixed within a cauldron of images from the film itself, it was little more than interesting to me.  It is nice to have a trailer for the original Japanese film Ringu thrown in, but this trailer is the equivalent of a TV commercial and not an extended theatrical trailer.  In the end, of course, the extras are just extras; it is the motion picture itself that matters, and The Ring not only delivers the goods, it knocks down your door, grabs you by the throat, and shoves them right down your gullet.</p></br><a href="../users/A4X7NFDO3I1TA.html">A4X7NFDO3I1TA</a><br/><p>The movie is based on Ring which a cursed, disturbing videotape that, when watched, will cause the viewer to die a week after.</p></br><a href="../users/A3W13VVBRY5GL7.html">A3W13VVBRY5GL7</a><br/><p>I hate to be a movie snob (actually no, that's a lie, I love being a movie snob :-) but, I have to say that, when taken on its own, this American remake of the classic japanese 'Ring' more than holds its own as a contemporary horror classic.<p>When taken in-context as a remake, however, it fails on most every count. But anyway.<p>To synopsise:  Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) is investigating the possibility of an Urban Legend being responsible for s spate of recent teenage deaths. The Legend in question concerns a videotape which, when watched, lets you know that you have a week to live. When she herslef falls prey to the Curse she enlists the help of her old partner Noah Clay (Martin Henderson) to stop the fatal event from taking place.<p>And from there on in, what we're left with is a mundanely-acted but beautifully-shot picture full of gorgeous and spooky set-pieces (the lighthouse, the barn, the asylum).<p>Watts and Henderson are there as perfunctory eye-candy, secondary to the ingenious plot and chilling photography. Director Gore Verbinski should be proud of himself  for having done such an impressive job with monochromatic shots, the Seattle weather and minimal special effects. The overall visual impression of 'The Ring' is truly unsettling.<p>The acting isn't so hot, and the ridiculous, pointless sequence with the horses on the ferry goes nowhere and does nothing. There are several horrible horror-movie cliches here too, like the boy-teen at the start of the flick with near-ESP ('they're all gonna die, maaaan) that we really could have done without.<p>For all of that, though, 'The Ring' works well as a modern standalone horror movie, and is certainly one of the betterHollywood offerings of recent years.<p>On the other hand, when one watches the original 'Ringu', you'll understand what i mean. Less overstated, less effects-laden and far , far more effecting, 'Ringu' is a Classic. 'The Ring' is not. But if you've not seen either, start with the American version.<p>To rent, not to buy.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DAOL3NMHEPLS.html">A1DAOL3NMHEPLS</a><br/><p>This is easily one of the dumbest "mainstream" movies released in recent years. The story line is inconsistent, incoherent and illogical. There are some creepy moments, but the minute you start to analyze the movie, it just falls apart. The only thing that keeps it from being a total dud is the production quality ... and the fact that Naomi Watts is quite a looker.  As for those people who say it's "the scariest movie ever" I have to wonder what other movies they've seen. Probably not Psycho, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Exorcist, or any of Wes Craven's flicks, to name a few!</p></br><a href="../users/A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK.html">A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK</a><br/><p>A truly scary movie confuses you and chills you with the unexpected, the unknown, and occasionally, the incomprehensible.  "The Ring" gives you all this and more.<p>This film continues a recent trend in horror movies of taking place in a setting we all know that likely exists in our own home.  We have a comfortable familiarity with electronics, safe and snug with the doors locked.  The horror that finds us sounds much like an urban legend.  Watch a mysterious, bizarre videotape that causes fear in some, and others to scoff at its amateurish style and technique.  Moments after watching the videotape, the phone rings and a voice says, "seven days."  Seven days later the watcher of the video dies with a most horrible expression of fear on their face.<p>Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) learns of this urban legend when her niece dies in a most disconcerting way, and a friend who was with her becomes insane.  Rachel tries to back track recent events that happened to her niece and friend and discovers an unlabeled videotape in a remote mountain lodge.  Not yet believing the urban legend, Rachel watches the videotape.  The phone rings, and the fear begins.<p>Soon joining Rachel is her ex-husband Aidan (David Dorfman), and even more frighteningly, her son.  Hoping that the story isn't true, yet knowing she cannot wait for the end, Rachel begins following the clues in the video to determine whether there is a way of keeping from dying.  We discover with Rachel and Aidan in a journey that fits all the pieces together that every image in the movie has meaning.<p>The ending of the movie was a bit of a let-down, and yet almost as creepy as the movie itself.  As with many movies, especially horror movies, the ending can make or break a movie and the ending of this movie almost undoes all the excellence of the movie's body.<p>This movie is one of the best horror movies I've ever seen, and the best I've seen recently.  Elements of the movie are similar to "Fear Dot Com," which was also chilling and bloodier, but not as creepy and ominous as "The Ring."  I enjoyed how all the elements of the movie were tied together for those with the diligence to keep track of imagery throughout.  Horror movies always play better when ambiance and a growing sense of fear win out over the splatter of unnecessary and excessive blood.</p></br><a href="../users/A2II09GQGWOMTQ.html">A2II09GQGWOMTQ</a><br/><p>Saw The Ring, loved the ring.<br />The acting, the story, direction, atmosphere is superb.<br />It is more slowly paced than American horror movies but I loved it.<br />It builds more suspense.<br />The music is amazing.<br />There really isn't anything bad to say about this movie.<br />Of all the "J" horror films that have come to America, The Ring is probably the best of the bunch.<br />Too bad the sequel sucked, and I hope Hollywood has the sense to stop now.</p></br><a href="../users/A2582KMXLK2P06.html">A2582KMXLK2P06</a><br/><p>The reason I believe the Ring is a classic horror movie is because it disturbs me on a VERY personal, unexplainable level.  You see, the main storyline of the Ring is the fact that this video tape has been created, and anyone who watches this video tape will die in some unusual, twisted manner.  It's up to a reporter woman named Rachel to figure everything out.  She's the main character of the film, along with her son.<br /><br />As I mention above, something very unusual about the film effects me in a way I can't explain.  First of all, the entire film is very effectively well-done the way everything is dark and damp and, for lack of better words, SCARY!<br /><br />The one thing I remembered after watching the Ring are some of the things that were on that video tape.  The mirror on the wall, and the location of the ladder are two things I could have SWORN I've seen somewhere before, like a childhood memory I can't figure out.  Like I've been SOMEWHERE and seen those things before.  Like the video tape used in the storyline actually existed before the film was released in 2003, and I believe I've actually SEEN the footage on that video tape many years ago *somewhere* because the sequence with the mirror and the ladder looked *incredibly* familiar.  I can't explain what it is but this is the main reason I find the movie so delightful.</p></br><a href="../users/A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX.html">A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX</a><br/><p>Although there were a lot of holes in the plot that are never tied up or explained (which I'll discuss shortly), overall, I really enjoyed this film. It's actually a mystery wrapped in a horror/thriller film, and there's even a brief film within the film which is a big part of the plot, and is actually one of the scariest and creepiest things in the whole movie, and whose haunting, creepy, and disturbing images will stay with you for a long time.<p>I watched this movie without knowing much about it, so I didn't have much in the way of expectations, but after the first few minutes I was hooked and watched the whole thing, and I wasn't disappointed. I'm usually not much of a fan of the horror/thriller movie genre, because all too often they try to frighten you with a lot of gratuitous violence and gore that really isn't relevant to the movie. Although this movie has it's share of violent and gory scenes, it's much more of a psychological thriller than another cheap Hollywood gorefest, and the movie's dark and disturbing images and even the dreary and overcast Seattle and Puget Sound weather maintain an appropriately dark and creepy mood until the very end.<p>My only problem, as I said, is with a number of plot and story elements that don't make much sense, such as why the horse on the ferry became disturbed and jumped overboard when the woman lead character walked up to the horse trailer, how the video recording codes could be removed from the mysterious video tape that the people are watching, how the phone caller knows when you've watched the movie to call you, why the old farmer on Puget Sound committed suicide 20 or years after the little girl was murdered when the woman reporter came snooping around, what's causing the reporter's son to make the strange drawings that seem to relate to the murder of many years ago, why nobody was supposed to help the little girl, and even why the mother, who was said to have wanted the child more than anything in the world, murdered her daughter, and so on. And the movie's story line is complicated enough so that I'm probably missing a few. You just have to assume that there are strange, supernatural forces at work and let it go at that. <p>Those points aside, if you just ignore those problems and just go with the flow and let the movie's haunting, mysterious, creepy, and well-done visuals and images carry you along, you'll probably enjoy it like I did, and all in all, this is one of the scariest and most suspenseful movies I've seen in a long time.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ01Q3070LT29.html">AQ01Q3070LT29</a><br/><p>Many subliminal images here in this film.

Thes plot -- very urban legendy, non-sensical, non-linear and non-logical -- is about a whispered tale regarding a nightmarish video that kills the viewer seven days after watching it. When four teenagers die after seeing such a tape, a reporter -- a terrific Naomi Watts -- tracks it down and, uh oh, watches it.  Now she has only a week to unravel the mystery and maybe, just maybe, figure out a way to stay alive.  Whew!

The American remake is pretty good, but the silent eeriness that's constant in the original works more for me rather than the high-voltage "jump" effects. Plus, eighteen-year old Sadako is much scarier than ten-year old Samara. But performance-wise, Naomi Watts and Martin Henderson are more believable. Plus, Brian Cox is in the film, so it brings my grade up a notch. Finally, there's the cursed videotape. The longer American version is all for disturbing images and shrieking sound effects, while the original is only forty seconds long and contains only one scary image. I do believe I like the tapes equally (though I definitely wouldn't want to die in seven days when I watch them).<br /><br />All in all, The American Ring works for its shock effects and its horrifying climax. I just prefer the original Japanese Ring for its silent eeriness and steady pacing.<br /><br />Grade: B-</p></br><a href="../users/A1N8K1X0OLLADY.html">A1N8K1X0OLLADY</a><br/><p>The Ring is very boreing and very dumb.

Hearing stories about people freaking out in theaters and odd things happening at home during viewings made me think I was in for one hell of a thrill. Despite the fact that I had my own eerie experience while watching this -- my phone started ringing at exactly the same time as the phone in the opening scene -- I still couldn't feel any intensity, any chills, or any entertainment. I don't ask much of my horror movies, not much at all, they don't have to be scary or full of gore (afterall, this is the guy who LIKED "Open Water"), just as long as I can make some sort of connection and they entertain me for the 90+ minutes they run in. "The Ring" doesn't do that. Instead, we are subjected to a very good looking, but pretentious picture as done by "Pirates Of The Caribbean" (another movie that had way too much hype) director, Gore Virbinski. Virbinski is no doubt a skilled director, but there is just too much eye candy here, as opposed to actual plot. Not for one minute did I really feel any characters were in danger, and the pace just kept going up and down so much that it just got annoying. Each time I would start to engage myself in the happenings, the movie would just let go of me. The overall story leaves much to be desired, and the ending makes absolutely no sense. I honestly don't understand how this movie could become such a phenomenom. Maybe it's just me. I know I need something a little more visceral to scare me or at least entertain me. "The Ring" is just a whole lotta nothing. There is one scene where a horse commits suicide that might arouse the sleepy haze that will most likely come over you, but it really has no other purpose to the story, and much like everything else in the movie, it was put there just to make you uncomfortable (it made me giggle uncontrollably). Towards the end of the movie, my dog barfed up a considerably large amount of food on my bed. Now that, my friends, is scary.</p></br><a href="../users/A5TZXWU8AALIC.html">A5TZXWU8AALIC</a><br/><p>What makes this an extremely effective horror film is this: it's rated PG-13.<br /><br />As modern horror films indulge in grotesque but tiresome bloodbaths, THE RING manages to fill the screen with a gloomy dread and a few good shocks.  The cast is excellent (I think Naomi Watts is one of the best actresses in movies these days) and the direction is tight and driven.<br /><br />I rented the original Japanese film, RINGU, on which this version is based, and enjoyed it as well.  It'll probably depend on which you see first as far as which you'll like better, but it's worth doing if you liked the story.<br /><br />It creeped me out for days afterward without a drop of gore.</p></br><a href="../users/A391YPR0NFTCLK.html">A391YPR0NFTCLK</a><br/><p>This is a very creepy movie.

I know why.  I heard this movie compared to "The Sixth Sense", which was a great movie.  And the premise is great.  "You watch a video tape and a few days later you die."<p>So I wanted to see why.  What was so evil about this tape.  How did these viewers die, and why?  Everything about this movie is good except the ending and the answer to the above questions.  First of all, the Ring is in no way like the Sixth Sense.  At least that movie was consistent, it was a ghost story.  <p>The Ring for the whole movie (except the ending) leads us to believing there is a logical reason why people are dying.  Naomi Watts inspects the tape with high-tech equimpment and follows leads.  I kept hoping she would find the evil killer genius behind it all, but instead the movie reduces itself to some "Freddie Kreuger" type ending.  I was very dissappointed.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>Of all the horror films to be released as of late, I really did want to see The Ring, basically because I wanted to know how good or bad a PG-13 rated horror movie could be.  After seeing countless horror films trying to be scary and frightening by using predictable tactics and loading on computer generated blood and gore, my faith that horror films of old that didn't rely on blood, gore, and gross out effects to be scary (Poltergeist, Pumpkinhead, the original Halloween) would be returning in films such as The Ring, but I was very disappointed. The film starts out with an eerie opening and some nice scares leading up to an investigation by a reporter (Naomi Watts from Mulholland Drive) into the death of her niece which involved a video tape rumored that if one watches it, seven days later you'll die. While the storyline is interesting and has a bit of originality to it, it seems that director Gore Verbinski wanted the film to be too suspenseful. Not to mention some things are never explained in the film (such as why the horses flipped out) and by the time the credits start rolling you'll have more questions than answers. The acting is pretty well done, but the child actor playing Watts' son seems a bit out of place and a little creepy himself.  What really makes me wonder though is how big a hit The Ring was in theaters, most of which were populated by mid-teen girls who had never heard of and/or seen any films gracing titles like Evil Dead, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Pumpkinhead, Last House On the Left, or Hellraiser.  Those films were original (the first installments of the ones which became a series that is) and truly deeply scary.  The Ring is simply overrated, and is teen horror at it's near worst.  I suggest checking out the Japanese film it was based on; Ringu, that is at least watchable.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EBHHCZO6V2A4.html">A3EBHHCZO6V2A4</a><br/><p>I first saw this movie in the theater,and I came out shaking.It's that creepy.For a movie that is only PG-13&lacks the usual slasher&bloody gore,this is a movie that gets inside your head.(From what I've heard,the original Japanese version is even scarier)<br /><br />Naomi Watts (who is also excellent in the even creepier "Mulholland Drive")plays a single mother who discovers a deadly video.At first,she thinks it's an urban legend,but she digs deeper--and finds bodies.The story depicted on the video takes her through time.She explores it with her boyfriend&her son.<br /><br />This movie is unusual--and even creepy--in its combination of the past&present.The evil girl,Samara,seems to be from the 19th century;her parents dress as if they were Mennonites or Amish,yet they are in the 20th century and take their daughter to a modern-day insane asylum.At first,Samara seems to be an innocent victim,yet she has terrifying effects on everyone around her---and,scariest of all,she never sleeps.<br /><br />Naomi Watts is an excellent actress,turning what could've been a chessy horror flick into a haunting psychological thriller that will stay with you long after you've stopped watching.</p></br><a href="../users/AYWAY5MKLAITN.html">AYWAY5MKLAITN</a><br/><p>When you first see the movie the ring, you wonder why there are no opening credits or long drawn out score. that's becuase the movie jumps right in with the plot, wasting no time with petty titles, which is a first. With the aid of two chatty teenage girls we find out that there is a specific VCR Tape that has the ability, when watched, to kill the viewer in seven days. Even more, the ghost who posses the tape will call the viewer up at their home to verify that they indeed have seven days left to live. What follows is a reporter who is quickly tracking down the myth of the mysterious tape. But, for reporters, the only way to break the myth is to see what all the fuss is about. She finds the tape at a lodging place and watches it. Sure enough, it's real. Now, before her time is out, she has to unravel the mystery of the killer tape using only the footage and her resources. Wierd things start happening: Distorted images, nightmares, signs, and ghostly otherworldly images.<br /><br />A tense Mystery/Horror that disturbs the mind as well as the senses. It's a movie that hitchcok would be proud of.<br /><br />Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A1N7YA81ZI4KAF.html">A1N7YA81ZI4KAF</a><br/><p>The creepy plot centres around a "cursed" videotape that brings death within seven days to whoever views it. The central character, Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) stumbles upon the tape while investigating the mysterious death of her niece and ends up watching it. Rachel must now hurry up and solve the mystery within the time period or she too will succumb to the videotapes murderous wrath.<br /><br />A remake of the Japanese hit "Ringu", this is probably the best horror movie of the last 10 years. It's no where near as entertaining or as frightening as some of the earlier classics but when compared to the numerous horror movie attrocities released from Hollywood within the last 10 years or so, fans of the genre should be thankful "The Ring" exists. It offers good performances from the ensemble cast (although the child star David Dorfman is rather charmless), an enigmatic storyline (although a tad bit confusing) and some effective visuals. I really like the fact that the film does not try to explain every little detail. It leaves alot to the viewers imagination. For instance, the origins of the "evil" is not fully explained so the viewer is left with several unanswered questions. Also interesting is the film's overall look. There is alot of grey skies and rain on display. The entire mood is dark, grey and depressingly gloomy adding to the overall tension and fear. The actors themselves have a constant blank stare on their scared faces adding to the film's tone.<br /><br />Let's not forget one of the key figures in "The Ring", the heinous, murderous "Samara". A one-of-a-kind, under-sized villian with a heart of stone and a mind full of vengeance. In "Ringu" the villian's face is never shown (only her eyes) and she does not speak. She remains a mysterious, silent, face-less character throughout the film. Not so in "The Ring". We not only get to clearly see the child monster but we get to hear her as well. There is a face to the plot's evil and despite this, it does not seem to diminish Samara's eerie hold over the audience.<br /><br />My biggest complaint with this film is that it's far too long. The whole mystery could have been solved a good 25 minutes sooner. The film does drag quite a bit during the middle so patience is definately required. But considering "The Ring" is the best "fright" film Hollywood has given us in a very, very long time, it's a small price to pay.<br /><br />This disturbing little chiller is highly recommended. You might want to double your pleasure and follow it up with it's much inferior but still watchable sequel "The Ring Two".</p></br></body></html>

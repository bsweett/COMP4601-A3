It seems it may have been billed as something other than what it was, which is a film about hope and survival.  As for me, I loved this film and think that the performances were outstanding, as was the story, and the telling of parallel packs.  There are a lot of subtle things taking place in this film, which makes it worth more than one viewing.  Well done.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJIJKKN15KR9.html">A1TJIJKKN15KR9</a><br/><p>A harsh, bitter, introspective survival picture that wasn't at all what I expected from the trailers. What the film chooses to do, it does very well - the suspense is so thick that my neck muscles remained in a stiff vice grip for hours, and the constant landscape shots are awe-inspiring - but those wildly successful qualities come at the expense of others. It's not a story with a firm resolution, which is sure to polarize a lot of viewers, and most of its intentions are left ambiguous. Liam Neeson is his typical commanding, badass self, but despite a few action hero moments he makes some boneheaded mistakes and his leadership qualities leave a lot to be desired. I've read that the plot is a metaphor for existentialism, which makes plenty of sense in reflection, but in the heat of the moment it feels desolate and hopeless. That innate duality makes it a complicated picture to rate; I wasn't oblivious to its faults, but still found it a dense, intriguing and enveloping experience. Worth watching, even if you wind up hating it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>When did Liam Neeson become such a bad-aze? Was it <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003CRM6QE">Darkman</a> perhaps? Maybe he always was, but he's such an under the radar bad-aze, no?<br /><br />The Grey is an action/drama about a pack of roughnecks versus a pack of wolves in the frozen tundra. If you can believe that about 7 or 8 oil riggers survive a pretty violent plane crash in the Alaskan wilderness, and if you can believe that a pack of wolves immediately locates and starts hunting the oil riggers with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXAT">Jurassic Park</a> velociraptor cunningness...AND if you can believe that the pack of oil riggers never consider using any of the club-like shrapnel and debris from the crash as weapons against the wolves...then you'll thoroughly enjoy The Grey.<br /><br />Not that I didn't enjoy The Grey as it was rolling across my screen. It's just that in hindsight, it was a little unbelievable that this group of people--complete with the clich&eacute; alpha-male (Neeson), the jerk who won't cooperate with anyone, the nice guy, the father figure, the rational guy, the annoying dummy and a couple of other dudes who right from the start you say, "Oh you know he dead"--could survive an explosive plane crash and subzero temperatures with blowing wind and snow for even 5 minutes.<br /><br />But all in all, The Grey is worth a rent or cable view and should keep you entertained for the approximate 2 hour run time.</p></br><a href="../users/A4SY5RCGC5CH9.html">A4SY5RCGC5CH9</a><br/><p>I liked this film a lot, mostly because it is SO DIFFERENT from most of the Hollywood recent offerings in adventure/survival category. This difference must however remain a surprise, therefore I simply can not elaborate, to avoid the spoilers.<br /><br />The one thing probably everybody already knows is that this is a film about a group of people stranded in northern Alaska in the middle of nowhere, during a winter harsh even by local standards. The way they arrive to the place of departure of their ordeal is VERY well described! The group counts initially eight members - but without providing any real spoilers, I can say that of course not all will make it until the final credits. Another thing I can reveal is that guessing the exact identity of all those who will survive is not an easy task - I for one completely failed...<br /><br />Another thing probably known to anybody interested in this film, is that some wolves are involved. Here, the only thing that I can say, is that this film avoids both typical "wolf movie" wolf traps. First, there is absolutely NO fantastic elements - the wolves are simply a bunch of very pragmatic and down to earth (or rather snow) hungry fellows, who just happen to be well skilled in their trade... Second, there is no New Age/ecologist wolf worshipping - wolves are animals with all the wonderful and nasty things that it implies. And wolves will be wolves. Period.<br /><br />Alaskan winter wilderness is shown in an incredible way, in its full majestic, cruel and merciless beauty. Visually, this film is breathtaking and for that reason I advise to buy it in Blu-Ray rather than in classical DVD, as here every pixel counts.<br /><br />Liam Neeson is GREAT! There is simply no other way to describe his performance. His character is very believable and I found it really likeable. Without revealing too much I can also say that I felt for him a lot, as he is a man in lots of pain, from the beginning of film, as it is shown in the two first minutes - and nothing more will be said...<br /><br />Other characters are also rather well developped and actors play them well. Most of actors were completely unknown to me, with the exception of Dermot Mulroney, who clearly went a long way since his beginnings in romantic comedies in the 90s...<br /><br />You should not expect any "Rambo" or other "Great White Hunter" moments. The film is very realistic and all the "heroes" are just ordinary people, who found themselves in a very extraordinary situation. They begin their trek for survival already under big shock and are most of the time very tired, very cold and very very scared - and that means that they make mistakes, which people comfortably sitting in a warm cinema and having all the time of reflexion they want, would probably avoid... I found this vulnerability of all the characters, including the one who is in principle the most skilled in survival, a very realistic touch.<br /><br />But the thing that is the most impressive is the study of the approach of those people to their very possible future death. In the immediate proximity of death people start to see the world differently and understand things which remained for them a mystery previously. Now, there is no preaching in this film - here, there is no better or worse way to deal with the sound of approaching steps of the Grim (or here rather Grey) Reaper. But there are many different ways. And as far as I am concerned, that was for me the main point of "The Grey" - how scared, exhausted and suffering people face the high probability of a horrible death, when in the same time struggling with all their forces to live another day.<br /><br />Bottom line, I found this film a very excellent thing, I spend a very good cinema moment and I am going to buy the Blu-Ray as soon as it is available.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>I loved almost every second of The Grey. Movies about people surviving out in the wilderness have always interested me.<br /><br />The cast was believable (Liam Neeson at his best), they filmed on location (you can almost feel the cold), and it dove into deeper issues than just surviving a large pack of wolves. This film is like a horror and action film rolled into one. The wolf attacks are almost horror movie gory.<br /><br />Some people are complaining about the open ending, which I liked, but if you stay after the end credits you get about a 5 second look at the aftermath.<br /><br />For a January release, The Grey is much more of a high calibur film than I expected.</p></br><a href="../users/A2H44WVZS59KKT.html">A2H44WVZS59KKT</a><br/><p>Well, I rented this movie hoping for an action film and - I kind of got that. I didn't really expect an artsy killer wolf movie.<br /><br />I love Liam Neeson (usually) but really felt his acting was wooden and one-dimensional in "The Grey."<br /><br />Another problem - I rented this on Amazon as a 24-hour rental and as such, I don't get Closed Captioning. And with Neeson's heavy accent and my poor hearing, I had to keep backing the film up so I could catch what was being said.  That took a lot of the spontaneity out of watching the film.<br /><br />This was a crazy story.  Neeson is the hunter, keeping the wolves away from the oil workers - and kind of "wolf whispering" them into the next life as they die.  He does the same for the airplane crash survivors as they die during the film (kind of odd for a self-proclaimed atheist).<br /><br />The scenery was beautiful, the wolves were spooky, and the acting was so-so. So unless you just have to see every Neeson movie made, I would skip this one.<br /><br />  Once more into the fray,<br />  Into the last good fight.<br />  Live and die on this day;<br />  Live and die on this day.<br />  - written by Joe Carnahan, director of "The Grey"</p></br><a href="../users/A2RHQMV5GD18Z8.html">A2RHQMV5GD18Z8</a><br/><p>The presence of Liam Neeson is main reason that I wanted to see The Grey. I've become an even bigger fan since I bought Taken and saw that he could even bring depth to a character in an action movie. Neeson seems authentic in just about any role, even if he's just providing the voice for an animated character.<br /><br />In The Grey, Neeson is clearly the main character. We see him contemplate suicide at the start of the movie, before deciding against it. The story involves a group of oil workers stationed in Alaska. Ottway (Neeson) is a marksman who keeps the workers safe from wolves when they are at work. He carries a rifle and is always watching for possible attacks. He has a low opinion of most of the workers and doesn't enjoy having to spend time with them.<br /><br />Ottway's world changes when he's involved in a plane crash. The oil workers encounter bad weather and turbulence, and the resulting crash leaves most of the group dead or dying. It's here that Ottway assumes a leadership role without being asked or voted in. Like the wolves he kills, his instincts cannot be denied. In the surviving group, it quickly becomes clear that he's the alpha. Ottway has a way of facing facts and helping others to accept the inevitable. This is perfectly illustrated when one of the crash victims dies in front of him. Ottway calms him and takes charge of the situation when the other men are incapable of deciding how to handle it.<br /><br />The movie partly reminded me of The Edge, starring Anthony Hopkins. Although this group of survivors is larger, and they are hunted by wolves instead of a bear, the terrain is similar. The Grey seems realistic and doesn't idealize the situation in any way. The men are in danger and fighting for their lives, and their actions are plausible. If you are facing a pack of wolves unarmed, your chances of survival are not good. The Grey doesn't shy away from that fact.<br /><br />Action scenes are infrequent, but have considerable impact. How would you try to survive if you had no food or shelter and had to make your way through freezing snow? Would it be best to try to make your own way back to civilization, or stay at the crash site and hope for rescue?<br /><br />The movie explores the characters of several of the crash survivors and we come to understand their individual choices. The setting is grim, so don't expect a heartwarming story. This is real.<br /><br />I didn't know what to expect from The Grey, but it left me somewhat surprised. The body count was definitely higher than expected, and I assumed that the group would generate more internal conflict than it did. That said, I did feel as though I was a part of the quest for survival and I was engaged at all times. Neeson carried the movie, but three or four supporting characters were important to the story.<br /><br />If you enjoy experiencing things that you are unlikely to witness in your real life, The Grey is a compelling story which transports you to an unfamiliar setting. If you are sensitive to watching characters get picked off one at a time, it might not be for you.<br /><br />The Blu-ray offers a pleasing presentation. The audio is just about perfect, and you'll feel involved in scenes such as the plane crash. The picture quality is also very good, but sometimes appears intentionally grainy to heighten the effect of being lost in a bleak, snowy wilderness.</p></br><a href="../users/A36HBE2C5SQ2E6.html">A36HBE2C5SQ2E6</a><br/><p>The Grey<br /> Review<br /><br />A man named John Otway works in the Alaskan Wilderness as a protector of an oil drilling team from Wolves. He pens a letter to his wife, then gets on a plane, which crashes and he ends up in the wilderness with other men fighting for his life and the lives around him.<br /><br />Liam Nesson is one of the older generation's overlooked actors. He is an actor that can take on any role and nail it. He is so method and so intense in his acting ability, he can carry any film that he is in with it. He is remarkable to watch and makes me actually want to go to see the film that he potentially is in.  But in this film, he could've turned in a one-note performance and just chewed scenery, but he turns in a haunting, moving performance that made me weep for his character towards the end.  You get that feeling in your gut after watching the men walk through the wilderness and you just know. Also you feel for the character after getting to know him through out the movie.  Not a lot of actors have that hold on the audience like he does.<br /><br />Joe Carnahan is a pretty prolific director that has his hits (Smoking Aces), huge misses (A Team) and critically overlooked (Narc). I was worried that he would underwhelm yet again on this one because A Team didn't come out that great and I was disappointed, but I was glad I saw this movie because this movie takes the talent he has shown in Narc and brings it to a another level of solid film-making. The look, pace of the film are really good and made me enjoy the movie even more because with certain directors the material in this film would've or could've been mishandled, but he did it fine. In fact, this could be his masterpiece because it moved me to the point because at the point before I saw it, I had low expectations. I am glad it didn't turn out to be the ACTION FEST TO END ALL ACTION FEST movie the trailer made it out to be.  Everything is just well rounded here, but it does have its flaws.<br /><br />First flaw is that the side characters that worked with Nesson's character barely had time to get their story. I know there is a 2-hour time limit and there could've been more expanded from the story on those characters because in the last scene, I really didn't feel for them as much as I did Nesson's character because that is basically the main character development that we had in the movie, but the rest not so much.<br /><br />Yes, I did read there was a lack of an ending, but how do you end a movie like this? It's hard to sit at your computer and go, "Ok, let's end it this way or that way." That's not how it works. Some open endings are perfect for some movies, and this movie had a good open ending to make you think on what was going to happen to the character after the film ended.  Plus, I feel some other reviewers missed the theme and the message of the movie to the point where they are making blind criticisms without digesting the film, but you don't have to like everything.<br /><br />Overall, it was a enjoyable movie and a great thrill ride like the reviews said it was, it had the right amounts of all the stuff that movies are made up of, but there was a lack of some parts that didn't make the movie less enjoyable, but still were there to see.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>Filmmakers of "The Grey" should thank ever-reliable Liam Neeson for joining their project. Without his strong performance "The Grey" would have been an unwatchable mess.<br /><br />Liam Neeson plays John Ottway, a man hired by an oil company in Alaska to "protect" the workers from wolves by shooting them. Ottway take a flight with the crew of oil workers, but his plane crashes in the Alaskan wilderness. The premise may reminds us of "Alive" (1993), a film based on true events, but "The Grey," directed by Joe Carnahan ("Narc" "The A-Team"), it seems, aims for something different - something more mystical.<br /><br />Thus grey wolves are depicted as very violent creatures with uncanny abilities to spot the humans. I do not disagree with the idea of turning wolves into symbolic presence, but I still don't know whether I should take the film's story seriously or not. While Joe Carnahan's approach to the subject matter of survival tends to emphasize the realism (with the spectacular visual of the freezing snow and wilderness), the story that unfolds here often looks like an action-movie template, with a group of blood-thirsty wolves (special effects included) and cliff jumping.<br /><br />Some viewers would find the film's abrupt ending (including one post-credit scene) unsatisfactory (is there an alternate ending?) Some may find the film's tone too depressing. But what I didn't like about the film is its lack of credible motives on the humans' side. Why do they have to leave the plane, for instance? Neeson's character explains, but never convinces, as his character, if not his performance, lacks the credible voice of Jack London, who would have given some advice to filmmakers.<br /><br />"The Grey" has two good things in it, Liam Neeson's acting and beautiful photography. Two stars for them.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ0EO10KTRJ4V.html">AQ0EO10KTRJ4V</a><br/><p>The other reviewers do a good job pointing out the problem with this movie .<br />It seemed to fight with itself to decide what kind of movie it wanted to be .<br /><br />a) Serious survival story<br /><br />-or-<br /><br />b) Unrealistic supernatural CG! wolf-monster movie<br /><br />--or--<br /><br />c)  Symbolic movie about soul searching and self redemption<br /><br />Perhaps by trying to be three movies at once, it never quite succeeded at reaching its full potential on any of the levels.<br /><br />It was beautifully shot.<br />Great acting by all involved.<br />Well written dialog.<br /><br />Did a fair job of pulling you into their situation .........<br />BUT ............<br /><br />SOMETHING just didn't work and the film never really touches or grabs you.<br /><br />It's like a well done technical movie ... but missing a soul or spirit that gets to you.<br /><br />It's hard to place a finger on what exactly was missing in the movie, but it just kind of lumbered along ---- ended ...... and then was pretty forgetable.<br /><br />My wife just looked at me and went ......  "Hmmmmmm,  that's it ?"</p></br><a href="../users/AE9V37MS6QY8D.html">AE9V37MS6QY8D</a><br/><p>This film further proves the bad@$$ coolness that is Liam Neeson. But it's not just because he's a man who knows the wilderness and can kill wolves, it's because of Neeson's range from tough-as-nails to deeply poignant in a role that Neeson doesn't usually take: that of a suicidal man on the edge. And while the story is quite simple -- a Dylanesque (Thomas, not Bob) "Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night" -- writer/director Joe Carnahan (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VEJKQI">Smokin' Aces [Blu-ray</a>], <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004856SQ8">The A-Team (+ Digital Copy)  [Blu-ray</a>]) presents that story in a survival genre that the general public is not quite used to seeing. This film does promote hope and faith, but it also is gritty and violently real. Indeed, this survival story goes another route but nevertheless delivers a meaningful message. Despite the sad underusage of James Badge Dale, the rest of the cast, besides Neeson (particularly Dallas Roberts, Dermot Mulroney and Frank Grillo), shine. The film is not as good as I thought it would be but that's only because it ended differently than I thought. Plus, I REALLY wanted to see that fight!</p></br><a href="../users/A1GHUN5HXMHZ89.html">A1GHUN5HXMHZ89</a><br/><p>How you feel about endings may impact your opinion of this movie if you must have a happy conclusion.  This is not one of those movies.  As a friend of mine often says, "It is what it is".  Meaning take it for what it is because we can't always have what we want and we must use what we have.  Even survivalist will find some of it daunting.  Perhaps the cold and hunger affects their judgement because there are some mistakes made.  But then even in the best of conditions people prove they are only human every day.  Some perhaps expect perfect heroes that have all the answers, and they aren't in this movie.<br /><br />I enjoy survival movies and even with movies like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H7J9LM">Eight Below [Blu-ray</a>] that don't have the happiest of endings, you learn from the journey.  You will learn from it and Liam Neeson gives a magnificent performance.  He has perfected his craft and does a wonderful job of pulling us into this cruel wilderness that he must try to survive after a plane crash leaves him and a handful of passenegers alive and surrounded by giant gray wolves.  If you find yourself skeptical of their decisions or the wolves, I'd say you haven't done that much camping in the wild or you aren't familiar with this variety that kills for sport.  Not a day goes by when even smart people make the dumbest decisions that should make them candidates for the Darwin Awards.<br /><br />Keep in mind this group of survivors has no weapons, only fire to keep the wolves off them.  Add to that most of them are bleeding, and predators like wolves can certainly sense fear as well.  If you're still skeptical of the wolves size and behavior let me tell you I was until I found out it's not unrealistic at all.  I found articles about the large wolf packs in Canada that came from the introduction of 35 large Canadian gray wolves into Idaho and Yellowstone in Wyoming.  So those that tell you wolves aren't like this are basing their opinion on the smaller wolf varieties that were indigenous previously and now thought to be extinct in the United States.  Large packs of gray wolves are now roaming Northern US and they are aggressive enough to have not only attacked livestock, but humans in ever increasing numbers.  I recommend you see the movie if you enjoy movies like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005FDWAXM">Alive</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VDDWE2">The Day After Tomorrow [Blu-ray</a>].<br /><br />CA Luster</p></br><a href="../users/A3TYC8T6W81DDB.html">A3TYC8T6W81DDB</a><br/><p>There were a lot of things that felt like they were kept secret on purpose before sitting down and viewing The Grey for the first time. The trailer hints at the movie being nothing more than a survival thriller starring Liam Neeson as he struggles to survive not only the unrelenting cold elements, but also the ferocious wolves that inhabit his surroundings. The Grey is written and directed by Joe Carnahan, the man who brought us Smokin' Aces and The A-Team. The movie is also produced by Tony and Ridley Scott, which you think the marketing campaign would jump all over but doesn't even mention. Not only that, but there is quite a bit more to the movie than the trailer and TV spots let on.<br /><br />As the movie begins, Ottway (Liam Neeson) narrates a letter he's writing to his wife. This segment just made me realize what my life is lacking most right now and that's a Liam Neeson voiceover for every thought that crosses my mind. Think about that. It'd be the most amazing thing ever. The trailer reveals a few major things: that Ottway is stranded in the middle of nowhere in the blistering cold thanks to a plane crash and that wolves stand in the way of him actually surviving this ordeal. The plane crash itself is one of the best executed in recent memory. The way it's filmed and edited is downright ruthless. It's as if you're on the plane as it goes down. The Grey doesn't just place you in this blizzard-ridden hell infested with wolves, it kicks your teeth down your throat, laughs in your face, and throws you into it with everything it has.<br /><br />The movie gives new meaning to some of the simplest things. Seeing your breath in cold weather takes on an entirely new definition and the way The Grey deals with death just feels incredibly powerful. Ottway questions faith right from the start and takes matters into his own hands throughout the movie. The events that transpire take a toll on even the most religious plane crash survivors. Death is more of a relief than something worth distancing yourself from. Ottway describes it as being a warm sensation and thinking about the thing you love most in life before completely giving yourself into it. Many of the campfire conversations are entirely more impactful than they have any right to be. The conversation about faith in general hits you like a potato sack full of cinder blocks.<br /><br />The Grey manages to shout its message even when there's nothing being said on-screen. One of the images that stuck with me long after the movie ended was the shot of blood flowing into the paw print of a wolf in the snow. There's a scene by the river that strictly relies on sound and the way you succumb to it is nothing more than brilliant. There's another shot at the end of the film where (and I'm trying to avoid spoilers the best I can) Ottway is arranging some objects in the snow. The way Liam Neeson's fat, sausage-like fingers delicately wrap themselves around these objects and the way his hands tremble as he does this illustrates not only what this man has been through, but also that he's at the end of his rope. Plus the movie will make you want to look over your shoulder the next time you consider relieving yourself out in nature somewhere.<br /><br />That level of greatness The Grey eventually achieves isn't around at all times. Some lame dialogue does squeak through and characters manage to do really stupid things at times (John Diaz, played by Frank Grillo, especially), but that seems to help the movie more than anything. People, real people, occasionally do stupid things especially when they're scared. So this kind of made the characters feel more genuine and made it very clear that certain characters were caving under pressure.<br /><br />There was a movie that came out back in 2000 that was called Vertical Limit. It was one of my most trying times at the movie theater. I fought vehemently to leave about halfway through because I hated it so much, but I was with people at the time who wanted to stay until the end. It was probably one of the worst experiences I've ever had to pay for. The Grey is basically everything I wanted that movie to be. The cast is fantastic, their actions are mostly believable, and there's this meaning to everything that really speaks to you.<br /><br />The Grey is a grainy thriller that knocks the wind out of you on more than one occasion. In fact, it's rare that the movie actually allows you to catch your breath. Everything is such a raw, vicious, and brutal test of faith. It's fantastically violent and Liam Neeson is superb. If The Grey is anything to fall back on, then 2012 is going to be one hell of a year for movies.</p></br><a href="../users/A1V3TRGWOMA8LC.html">A1V3TRGWOMA8LC</a><br/><p>The basic problem of The Grey is the difference between what the filmmakers think they had and what the marketing department wanted to sell. This is promoted as a dramatic survival action movie in the trailers and even Liam Neeson's talk-show circuit tour pushed the same line - a plane crashes and a bunch of guys have to survive things that want to eat them. Kind of 'Alive' meets Jurassic Park. With Ra's al Ghul.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it's this difference that's going to disappoint most of the audience. The film starts with Liam's melancholic voice-over (which isn't a good sign) and a fairly dim setup of oil-riggers beating the ever-loving out of each other. We then see Liam shooting a wolf, lamenting the loss of his wife and then putting a rifle in his mouth and contemplating sparing us from another 2 hours of this. And it gets more depressing from there when the trip home ends abruptly in a plane crash.<br /><br />It's at this point that the film's indecision about what it is becomes a real problem. As an action or survival film, Liam guides his band of survivors in the most irresponsible way possible, making mistake after mistake and fundamentally dooming them all to becoming wolf entree. There are some basic errors, such as a stack of shotgun shells packed with his rifle, and anybody who's familiar with wolf behavior is going to be really unhappy at their depiction in this film. Anyone from Alaska is going to be even more unhappy at the depiction of swimming in rapids too.<br /><br />Also as an action film, the wolves have a supernatural capability to outsmart the survivors and behave more like Spielberg's raptors than any real life wolf. At one point they jump a ravine and the wolfs are waiting with GPS precision. They pick off our band of survivors one at a time, leaving us with intermittent testosterone-fueled in-fighting to pass as drama. If only Liam hadn't left the crash site, where rescue teams would already have arrived with burgers and cocoa.<br /><br />But here's the problem - it's not an action film. It's not a survival film either. It's a psychological drama about facing death where the wolves act as furry metaphors for the grim reaper. From the very first scene to the last, Liam Neeson (who's very good as always) emphasizes this theme and it reverberates over and over. And that's where the film could have been quite good and a welcome break from the survival genre but unfortunately it's too late by the time it becomes clear that the wolves' uncanny supernatural sense has a very good explanation.<br /><br />My guess is that the everyone expecting an action drama is going to be very unhappy, along with animal rights, PETA, Alaskans and oil-riggers. It's a real shame they didn't recut the trailer before the release.</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>Liam Neeson gives a riveting performance in a dark thriller set in the Alaskan wilderness. When a plane carrying Alaskan pipeline workers crashes in the middle of nowhere, the nine survivors find themselves in a struggle for survival; their plane has crashed in an area where a pack of grey wolves hunt and the seven survivors must face off against a brutal, fierce enemy that has every advantage except one--the human will to survive.<br /><br />Featuring a terrific supporting cast (Dermot Mulroney, Frank Grillo among others)and a strong script that manages to quickly sketch in the seven characters at the heart of the film.<br /><br />A bit of a left turn for director Joe Carnahan after the big studio productions he has directed of late ("The A-Team"), "The Grey" returns the director to the smaller ensemble based thrillers/dramas he began with--"Narc" and "Smokin' Aces" that help make his reputation- demonstrating that, as good as he is at big Hollywood productions, he's better with smaller, more intimate productions like "The Grey".<br /><br />The Blu-ray is a sharp, nicely detailed transfer. Audio sounds powerful and is VERY active putting you right there in the wilderness with our main characters.<br /><br />The special features are a bit limited--we get deleted scenes (some extended versions of some in the film) and a great, very frank commentary track from the director with editors Roger Barton and Jason Hellmann. It's a very informative and nicely done commentary track.<br /><br />Although a bit on the lite side when it comes to the special features what matters is the film itself. Although "The Grey" is very much a downbeat film, it's also a powerful film and well worth watching.</p></br><a href="../users/A1I7QGUDP043DG.html">A1I7QGUDP043DG</a><br/><p>To start with the viewer will note that the wolf behavior is highly dramatized, even has a supernatural feel. However, the movie does a good job of offering reasons a wolf pack 'might' behave with such aggression. Forget all that, this isn't really too much about the wolves behavior, other than on the surface. I felt the thrill of a Jack London adventure tale (which I adore). Not only is it Man vs. Nature, but it is Man vs. Man and Man vs. Himself all rolled into one and in the most extreme. The biggest obstacle the main character truly has to overcome is his past and the ability to choose life over death in the first place. If you were left out in nature what would keep you going forward? Why do some people become leaders and others just give up? What in your past has shaped who you are in your future? There were so many layers of questions about human nature and a deeper thread wound through this story that I can hardly see it as just a life and death adventure tale. One particular scene really spooked me (and I had to watch a couple times). When they are pursued by the wolves and standing by the fire look closely at the tree line...very eerie effect. It has a very symbolic 'shadow of death' quality I couldn't help but admire. I recall a time up in Leadville, Colorado when I heard wolves in the far distance. It was both beautiful and haunting at the same time. I swore I saw this in the tree line as I looked at the snow on the ground that night under the moonlight. I quickly retreated to my car and slept there rather than my tent! I got the same chill up my spine while I watched this movie. Very well done. Just keep in mind that as with Jaws and other movies like it that this is 'over the top' Hollywood drama, not necessarily true animal behavior.</p></br><a href="../users/A387BD735MI50R.html">A387BD735MI50R</a><br/><p>Wolves should sue this production for defamation of character. They look unreal and ridiculous here for no good reason. Even if you take the wolves and their attacks to be mythic, serving as metaphors for the approach of death that we all face - their presence in this film still doesn't work. More compelling, genuine metaphors could have been found for mortality.<br /><br />Although I was somewhat prepared for this film to fail in concept, I thought it might at least give me a chance to see some real wolves close-up, to look into their intense, intelligent eyes. But this movie affords no such opportunity for nature study. Don't think you'll see much of any actual wolves here. In most instances, the film substitutes improbable, Claymation-like mock-ups for real wolves in what few murky close-ups you do get. Godzilla looked like a more realistic, less laughable lizard than these animals look like representatives of their species.<br /><br />Then I thought well, at least I might get a few survival tips from this film. Wrong again. Neeson's character makes the absurd decision to lead the other plane crash survivors away from the relative safety of the plane wreckage - across a vast expanse of snow - into the woods. All right, once having negotiated past this exposure, I thought the men could survive any subsequent wolf attacks by simply climbing a tree. However metaphoric these wolves, they surely couldn't be shown climbing trees in pursuit of their prey. But no one here thinks to climb a tree. Instead, Neeson leads his remaining men on to swing over a chasm. Why?<br /><br />Finally I thought, well, this film might still be salvageable if developed as a revenge-on-humanity tale along the lines of "The Birds." This film starts with that potential when we early see Neeson's character, hired to kill any predators that might threaten the drilling operation in Alaska, shooting a wolf and presiding over its somewhat lingering death. I thought any subsequent wolf attacks might be framed as payback for the callous caging and killing we inflict on other species. But no, the movie doesn't take advantage of that potential springboard into a plotline.<br /><br />There are a few almost touching moments in the last quarter of the film, as the men drop their continuous, pointless cursing at each other and become more sympathetic in their reflections on death. However, these moments aren't nearly enough to rescue any of these antagonists, or this film, from becoming simply a nonsensical, gory mess.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>Liam Neeson continues his string of action hits with THE GREY.  The story is fairly simple:  8 survivors of a horrifying plane crash in a hostile Alaskan wilderness must face Mother Nature--and a ferocious pack of hungry wolves.  Along the way, there are moments of male bonding and character expositions.<br />Director Joe Carnahan who assaulted us with the A-TEAM reboot helms the film, which boasts one of the most frightening and realistic plane crashes caught on film.  The film has a brutally beautiful canopy, and lends an air of desperation and loneliness.  Neeson is powerful as usual, a little more vulnerable than in TAKEN or UNKNOWN.  THE GATES' Frank Grillo makes good use of his first big movie role as the blustery macho man whose false bravado masks his true personality--a star-making performance.  Dermot Mulroney eschews his leading man persona in his laidback role and Dallas Roberts brings his usual "everybody's friend" image to fuller fruition.  The entire cast is good, but it's basically Neeson and Grillo's movie.<br />THE GREY is a dark survival film, flashing moments of painful optimism crushed by brutal reality.</p></br><a href="../users/A2JDYUSI2RILEB.html">A2JDYUSI2RILEB</a><br/><p>Liam Neeson's determined performance - one of his best - anchors THE GREY, one of this year's more memorable cinematic excursions to date. Viewers who might've missed director Joe Carnahan's film in theaters ought to check out the picture on video.<br /><br />Carnahan, who adapted a book by Ian McKenzie Jeffers with the author, has fashioned a gripping account of a disparate group of Alaskan oil drillers who crash in the frozen wilderness and are subsequently attacked by a pack of hungry wolves. It's essentially a frigid "Deliverance" but with some poetic passages as Neeson and his fellow survivors dig themselves out and try to stay alive, occasionally stopping to deliberate on the meaning of life, the existence of God and why in the world these starving hunters won't give them a break.<br /><br />Atmospherically shot in British Columbia and filled with memorable set-pieces, "The Grey" is exciting and well-executed on nearly every front, save for some occasionally spotty uses of CGI. Still, Neeson's gritty performance says it all: his John Ottway might have been dealt a few bad hands, but the character opts to go down fighting, and the film's spirituality adds depth to a picture that, even on just a pure surface level, ranks as one of the more compelling outdoor-adventure yarns in recent memory.<br /><br />Universal's Blu-Ray looks terrific with its 1080p transfer and sounds even better with a marvelously mixed DTS MA soundtrack layered with surround activity. Extra features aren't overwhelming - just some deleted scenes and a commentary by Carnahan - while a DVD and digital copy round out the release.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KIQ4P4ZW3ALF.html">A1KIQ4P4ZW3ALF</a><br/><p>Movie is based on a short story which doomed it from the start because we know how much research and effort goes into a short story. A good story takes years to write and rewrite and involves a lot of research. Not in this case. Too many holes not well thought out for a reality based story. I, like many others, bought the movie because of Liam and his face is prominent on the cover. Should have been a wolf - at least you would get to see one.<br />Problems:<br />(1.) The initial scenes of a a bunch of guys drinking and brawling seemed too much like Hollywood script writers copying an old western saloon.<br />(2.) Liam's suicide thoughts were just a distraction and out of place.<br />(3.) The plane crash sequence, which was imaginatively created from the passengers pov turned out to be just cheap filming as all we're shown is a subsequent scene of a partial plane and stuff strewn on snow. And the usual couple of burning fires.<br />(4.) The drunken cowboy stereotypes as survivors continue which under the circumstances didn't seem to fit workers accustomed to working in those difficult conditions.<br />(5.) Usual dumb decisions like not fashioning snow shoes (easy to do from plastic suitcases and webbing; not making weapons from aluminum as defense against predators; not making torches; not gathering more than one lighter; not punching more holes in fuel tanks for kerosene; not using powder from bullets for small explosives; not making aluminum trekking poles. Basically not good planning while not searching for survival materials.<br />(6.) The shotgun shells on sticks seemed to have gotten lost - not that it was explained that well in the first place.<br />(7.) Final scenes of not fashioning a crutch or carrier for the leg injured survivor; being submerged in freezing water and when Liam gets out he's not shivering or hypothermic. Should have been dead, if not while in the water, then soon afterwards.<br />(8.) Not trying to find a path down a small cliff - the wolves seemed to have had no problems.<br />(9.) The behavior and pursuit by the wolves was way over the top - thought I was watching "Twilight". Their brief momentary cameos in scenes and even the artificially reflective eyes was just cheap cinematography.<br />(9.) River they were following was large to begin with but got progressively smaller. Huh? That's a good trick.</p></br><a href="../users/A24KZBAAUTC83R.html">A24KZBAAUTC83R</a><br/><p>I love movies like this.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this new movie had major issues even my city wife noticed right off.<br /><br />First off, let me say this is a solid movie, but came up short of being one of the greatest of its genre, due to the shortcomings of its storyline and survival techniques.<br /><br />First off, the crash of the plane: I had to suspend disbelief that so many could crash in a plane and come away almost, if not totally, unscathed. Liam Neeson's character wakes up all by himself in the snow, like a car had thrown him out on pillowy snow, not an airplane in brutal conditions. Yeah, right!<br /><br />Secondly: I had to again suspend disbelief that a group of timber wolves all the sudden hunt humans. At least the director/writer tried to explain this, but it was weak. (BTW, the CGI wolves were the best part of this movie!)So, again, as a moviegoer I have to say, OK, I'll let that go for the sake of entertainment.<br /><br />Thirdly: Why would manly men leave the plane crash? They had everything there! Food, shelter, warmth, and the very place that rescuers would be looking. And not one man created or fashioned weapons out of all the debris, even though a pack of huge wolves almost instantly attacked them! Stupid.<br /><br />Fourth: Now Liam Neeson's character plays the hunter that protects the oil men, killing and shootings wild wolves, right? And since he is supposed to know about hunting, animals behavior, etc, then why does he take the survivors right to the very den of the wolves he told the men he was helping was the very bloody reason these wolves were acting the way they were?!<br /><br />Fifth: Now, why on earth did no character bother to fashion spears and walking sticks from the numerous trees that always surrounded them? Here they are, trudging wearily through snow drifts and snow storms, and not a one of them thinks primal! Not one of them thinks to trim some branches and make some makeshift weapons/walking sticks to help them defend themselves and just to walk. Been doing that since caveman days, but modern man in this movie never even thought of it. Stupid!!!!!!<br /><br />Sure, in one scene Liam's character shows the others how to make a sort of shock stick out of branches and shells. OK, on the right track here. Problem is, they use them once and you never even see any of the characters use makeshift spears ever again, despite leg wounds and exhaustion. C'mon, do these directors and screen writers think the audience is that stupid? I guess so, their marketing sucked me in.<br /><br />And lastly is the ending. Total rip-off! Fade to black my ass! Just like the ending of The Sopranos. Rip-off.<br /><br />The movie had so much going for it, too. Haunting. Good idea. Interesting characters and plight. Almost totally wasted to to piss poor directing and writing in minute details that even my NY city wife could see that was so stupid and wrong with this film.<br /><br />I'm just glad the wolves won.</p></br><a href="../users/A3SS6VRWCTB7V.html">A3SS6VRWCTB7V</a><br/><p>Was looking forward to renting this as did not catch in theater.

Tale focuses on a bunch of oil riggers stranded in snowy Alaska after a plane crash. Only a handful of them survived and they are lacking in the bare necessities while a wolf pack tracks them down, picking them off one by one. The survivors desperately try to get away and seek a safer venue. Liam Neeson is the main star of this film with a somewhat good to good supporting cast. Neeson plays the expert on wolves attempting to give advice to the survivors who are in over their heads and half the time bickering with one another or failing to take the wolf situation seriously enough.<br /><br />Part of the "fun" is seeing how the "oh so clever" wolves pick people off. The actions and strategies of the wolves are controversial. Uninformed people act like wolves never attack people out in remote areas but if you do some research you will see the movie isn't always wrong in how it depicts wolf activities. Now, are they are smart as shown in the film? Probably not. Some are arguing the wolves are symbolisms for the Grip Reaper coming to get us but that is another discussion.<br /><br />In the end if you accept the possibility that wolves could attack a group of wounded humans then this is a fun survival tale with a gruesome ending. BTW, it was marketed as an action film in some circles and that is totally dead wrong. They filmed this picture in 40 days and it was based on a short story by Ian MacKenzie.<br /><br />Wolf lovers have boycotted this film arguing wolves never attack people but that's inaccurate and up to major discussions on the forums.<br /><br />STORY/PLOTTING: B plus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B minus to B; SURVIVAL SCENES: B to B plus; WOLF PACK DEPICTIONS: B to B (higher if you aren't seeking 100% accuracy); WHEN WATCHED: late June 2012; OVERALL GRADE: B to B plus.</p></br><a href="../users/A3J5V2GMXMOGCI.html">A3J5V2GMXMOGCI</a><br/><p>Neeson is exceptionally good in this so-called survival movie, but it's dreamlike quality is going to turn off a lot of adventure folk.  A lot of decent thought went into the film, and though the wolf metaphor looms too large (they have a cheap horror-film presence), and the supporting characters are half-baked, Neeson manages to hold the story together, and this is some of his best work.  A romantic sense of doom is hard to capture without too much cornball spiritualism and hamfisted family values, but director Carnahan and company succeed admirably in this case.  Lots of howling, but definitely worth checking out.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X1CEGHTHMBL1.html">A1X1CEGHTHMBL1</a><br/><p>John Ottway (Liam Neeson) is living in the frigid Northwest Territories on a petroleum drilling and refining plant. His job is to protect the workers from the wildlife that surrounds the plant. While traveling to Anchorage via plane, the almost full aircraft encounters bad weather and temperature so cold that it finally crashes. When he wakes up he finds 7 men capable of moving and the rest are dead or dying.<br /><br />They believe that their injuries and subzero weather will kill them until the wolves arrive and they realize that they have even more serious problems......<br /><br />This movie is a good story but it is also very gruesome so be warned. Both the plane crash and the wolf attacks are bloody. The men struggle to survive and face all of the elements that nature can throw at them. The movie is well filmed and the actors do a good job portraying their roles. Liam Neeson is especially good as the group leader take charge type of guy.<br /><br />For me what detracted from the movie was that these aggressive and intelligent men could not form weapons of any major type. They leave the crashed plane and all of the supplies and potential weapons they could have made from metal to wander into the frigid artic wilderness. This movie was good but it could have been so much more if the men hadn't forgotten everything they could have done more easily.<br /><br />My wife and I still enjoyed the movie and I recommend it to you as a suspenseful story about survival. I just wish that one time you could watch a movie of this type and have some of the protagonists do more of the right things!</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>I was surprised by how much I enjoyed Liam Neeson's new film "The Grey". Not because of Liam Neeson; he has developed into quite an action star over the last few years, bringing an undeniable, believable intensity to silly, over-the-top genre films. I was surprised because the film was co-written and directed by Joe Carnahan, the writer and director of "Smokin' Aces" and "The A-Team", two of my least favorite films ever.<br /><br />Neeson has transformed himself from respected independent film actor and dramatic leading man to a viable action star, appearing in the improbably silly Luc Besson film "Taken", made more palatable and interesting by his completely serious and believable performance. It was also a hit, so he followed that with "Unknown", another film made so much better by his commanding persona. Another hit. Now, we have "The Grey", proving he can "open" an action film, making him more bankable in Hollywood power circles.<br /><br />Ottway (Neeson) is a guard at an oil drilling facility in the farthest reaches of the Alaskan tundra. The men who work here do dangerous work for high pay and seem to spend their off-time drinking to help them forget where they are. Ottway accompanies the men when they leave the base and uses his high power rifle to keep them safe from hunting wolves. The men seem to live for their R & R back in civilization and rowdily crowd onto the plane eager for the trip to Anchorage. Shortly after the plane takes off, it runs into turbulence and crashes. Ottway and a handful of survivors band together and attempt to get back to civilization. But they soon realize they have to deal with more than just the elements; the plane crash landed in the middle of a pack of wolves. And they're hungry.<br /><br />The survivors include Talget (Dermot Mulroney), Hendrick (Dallas Roberts, TV's "The Good Wife", and "3:10 to Yuma"), Diaz (Frank Grillo, "Warrior", TV's "The Gates"), Burke (Nonso Anozie, "Conan the Barbarian"), Flannery (Joe Anderson, TV's "The River"), Hernandez (Ben Bray) and Lewenden (James Badge Dale, "Shame", "The Departed"). Each of these men has different backgrounds, strengths and problems all of which will lead to complications for the group and provide challenges to one and all.<br /><br />Carnahan spends a significant amount of time establishing Ottway's character, allowing us to watch him in the strange environment of this oil drilling station. We watch as he does his job, scanning the horizon for wolves near the workers, protecting the humans from the wild beasts. Later we watch as he deals with the loneliness, the isolation of this outpost. We spend some time listening to his thoughts. We watch some brief snippets of dreams and remembrances back to time he spent with his wife. This helps to establish why it is so important for him to make it back to civilization, why it is so important for him to survive. These moments are very effective and help us get into Ottway's mind and become a part of his journey.<br /><br />But as great as these are, the other characters are not established as well. Throughout the journey, as the men make their way across the snow and ice, they share remembrances, stories and dreams, giving us a brief insight into their lives. We learn a little about them, enough I guess, given the significance of these characters, but the level of detail pales in comparison to Neeson. I can't help but wonder what someone like Michael Mann might have done. Every character in "Heat" has some back-story.<br /><br />As the rowdy men crowd onto the plane, anxious for some R & R, we watch the technicians trying to deice the wings and get the aircraft moving. During the flight, we get our first individual glimpses of most of the characters and start to learn about them. But because there are so many of them, it is difficult to set them apart.<br /><br />As soon as the plane begins to experience trouble, you know you are in for something different. It just looks and feels different, more authentic, and more intense. And the moment of the plane crash is particularly harrowing. You really feel as though you are in the plane with the men. I doubt this is a selling point for most, but it helps to make the film feel authentic. It also happens fast. In most films, plane crashes seem to happen in slow motion, allowing us to revel in every special effect and filmmaking trick the director has in his arsenal.<br /><br />Because of this early moment, the intensity of it, Carnahan has a lot to live up to and thankfully, there are other moments which will in all likelihood bring you to the edge of your seat.<br /><br />The journey is punctuated by harrowing moments when the men have to overcome an obstacle; traversing a gorge on a single rope, fighting off wolves, dealing with the elements. Naturally, as soon as someone comes up with the idea of traversing a gorge on a single rope, someone will have a fear of heights. This fear leads to problems. The real journey comes in how these disparate men overcome these obstacles. And because each of the men is different, they will react differently to these tests.<br /><br />Carnahan doesn't shy away from depicting the harshness of the conditions or the environment. It's a bleak place and I can't imagine I would survive for 10 minutes. It looks uncomfortable and I can't imagine the actors were in the lap of luxury during the shoot.<br /><br />"The Grey" is a surprisingly effective action film. Neeson's intensity adds a lot to the film, but Carnahan's attention to detail also help to paint a picture of survival you really feel you are a part of until the bitter end.<br /><br />I'm not sure if I am helping generate any business for the film or not.</p></br><a href="../users/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z.html">AEQFYOI6YJ83Z</a><br/><p>If Hollywood has taught us anything, it's that you want Liam Neeson on your side in a tough situation.  The man can do anything: travel halfway across the world to rescue his daughter; train a Jedi master, a Sith lord, AND Batman; even lead a Scottish revolution.  What, you may be thinking, could a plane crash possibly do to Mr. Neeson?  Ruffle his hair?<br /><br />Indeed, Neeson and his fellow actors walk away from the plane crash...into the jaws of some very hungry, very demonic wolves.  Sound improbable?  It is.  And that's part of the fun.  Because THE GREY isn't an action film.  It was marketed as such, and as you can judge from many of the reviews, this was the viewpoint a lot of people took when watching it.  But THE GREY is more of an existential survivalist film.  These wolves aren't really wolves--they don't look like wolves, they don't behave like wolves.  The plane crash, beautiful though it is on film, isn't very realistic.  The fact that Neeson's character just happens to be a man paid to kill wolves?  Yeah.<br /><br />But Joe Carnahan does what most filmmakers wouldn't dare: he uses the absurdity to tell a bigger, more meaningful story.  Years from now, when people are debating whether or not Carnahan is a good filmmaker, the "pro" side will put forth THE GREY as their proof.  It is beautifully shot--the wolves are achingly rendered, shadowy creatures whose minimal appearance reflects the overall ambiguity of the film.  (Their attacks are effectively brutal while presenting a minimum level of gore.)  The afore-mentioned crash is stunning, and the various small action sequences are tightly drawn.  This is truly a film to be watched--the special effects, combined with the cinematography, and the actors' rugged appearances, makes it hard for one's eyes to wander.<br /><br />THE GREY isn't without its flaws.  It's slow in spots, and has a few weaker moments--hence the 4 stars.  But when it hits, it hits true, making it that rare film that defies expectations, bends genre conventions, and becomes something truly different.  An accidental hit, you might like to call it--or possibly the proof that there is a great filmmaker lurking within Joe Carnahan's imagination.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZBOBV9H1HDV.html">A3LZBOBV9H1HDV</a><br/><p>"The Grey" is great!

Damn.<br /><br />So maybe a bunch of dudes out in the wild fighting for survival is just a guy thing, so yeah it was a bit stupid at parts but I still found it very entertaining, and not something I'd expect from the director of Smokin' Aces and Narc.

And while the film may veer into some cliches we've seen many times before, it manages to be an effective thriller that grips you until the very end.<br /><br />"The Grey" follows Ottway, a hunter tasked with keeping Alaskan pipeline workers safe from hostile wildlife.  It's a lonely, hard job, and things only get worse, for while flying out to another job, Ottway is caught up in a plane crash that leaves him and a few other survivors deep in the frozen heart of Alaska.  Now he must rally the others, and fight to survive not only the elements, but a pack of wolves hell-bent on taking them out as well.<br /><br />What struck me most about "The Grey" is how grim it is.  This isn't an uplifting story of people banding together to overcome adversity; this is a film about desperate men out of their element, where death can strike at any time, and they're the ones at the bottom of the food chain.  And while it seems to make for a very despair-filled film, it works.  You're sucked into a situation that feels completely real, from the bare minimum use of CGI (when Neeson is freezing out in the snow-filled plains, it's real, and not a studio), to the danger of the ever-present wolves, and the way the survivors react.  In fact, a nice surprise of the film is the little character moments that pop up throughout the film, such as a hate-filled rant against God, to a moving scene at the side of a river that I won't ruin here.  Neeson himself turns in a fantastic performance of a world-weary man who is forced to take charge of a bad situation, with only his knowledge of the wild to help him.  He's not an action hero, or a macho-body builder, but an ordinary, middle-aged man who's tired of life, and it works wonderfully.<br /><br />But while "The Grey" works very well on all fronts, it does fall into the standard cliche of "picking off the survivors one by one," which leads the viewer to wonder if the film will defy the stereotype of having one lone survivor by the end of the film.  In addition, it's disappointing that, for having such a strong and gripping story, the film has a very weak ending that made me feel cheated.<br /><br />Still, despite it's two flaws, "The Grey" is a gripping survival film that feels completely realistic in every way: not once are you asked to suspend your disbelief, because the need never arises.  The characters are strong and believable, and the film has a visceral punch that grabs hold, and doesn't let go.  For fans of survival films, "The Grey" comes highly recommended.<br /><br />Oh, and one last thing: be sure to stay through the credits, as there's a scene afterwards.</p></br><a href="../users/A3QLAOOTFEHCJI.html">A3QLAOOTFEHCJI</a><br/><p>Let's get one thing out of the way.  This is not a story about psychotic rogue wolves seeking to eat humans.  This is not a story about werewolves.  It is about survival in a part of the world unwelcome to man.  A group of oil workers on the Alaska pipeline are heading to Anchorage for a little R and R when the plane goes down in the frozen wilderness.  Miraculously 7 survive the crash.  Liam Neeson is fortunately one of the survivors.  He is a marksman employed by the company and is charged with keeping the workers safe from wolves.  He is suicidal because of the recent death of his wife.  These early scenes must have been difficult for Neeson given his own personal circumstances.  In any case, those memories of his wife sustain him as he attempts to lead the survivors to safety.  Attempt is the operative word here.  In addition to below freezing temperatures, blizzards and a lack of food and water, the group must also deal with a pack of wolves looking for dinner.<br /><br />Ottway (Neeson) knows wolves are cunning hunters and will pick off the men one by one if they let their guard down.  The movie is terribly moving at times as each of the men has their own skeletons in the closet or loved ones waiting to see them.  They are full of grit but a lack of weapons and adaptability to the elements puts them at great risk.  Yes there are confrontations both with the wolves and each other.  And yes, the wolves are vicious but in a realistic way.  Escapist material?  You bet, but don't look for a happy ending.  If you sit through the entire credit list at the end of the film, there is a very brief scene that may make you feel better.  See it!</p></br><a href="../users/A24IJY3V0804WJ.html">A24IJY3V0804WJ</a><br/><p>Grey is a survival movie about a group of oil riggers who must defend themselves in the wild when their plane goes down. This group of survivors is led by Ottway ( Neeson) who has questioned his own mortality at the beginning of the film. Aside from the elements, the plane goes down during an ice storm the survivors must defend themselves against wolves who slowly start eliminating them. The film is mediocre at best, but stayed with me was the photography and the bleakness of the Alaskan landscape in the middle of  winter. We also learn a lot of wolves. Three stars. 7/11/2012</p></br><a href="../users/A356RFKNIG043B.html">A356RFKNIG043B</a><br/><p>I'm truly surprised to see so many bad reviews of this here. I for one was surprised by how solid it was, specifically because of Neeson's typically excellent performance. In fact, it's one of his best roles. Add that to a great score and tight direction and this is a chilling tale in every way.<br /><br />It's tough not to give spoilers for this one, so, short and sweet: it's occasionally very violent but it's always real violence, mostly wolf on man, and I'll take that any day over the numbing one hero shoots a hundred bad guys crap we usually get. This is much scarier, as it's believable. And it felt all too real at many moments, and that ever-present threat of (all-natural!) carnage adds a lot of suspense.<br /><br />The Grey has two classic scenes to boot: one of the best/worst plane crashes on film, and a truly fine death scene that transcends almost all other cinematic deaths. Perhaps it's those two scenes that turned folks off: they make us face a couple of very common fears, but not in an exploitative, fake way. That makes them all the more real and edgy.<br /><br />Neeson makes them work, as he does the whole film. The guy can act, and never does he feel like he's in a film. He carries it all, and this is one of the best acting jobs I've ever seen in a film like this. It starts out as man vs. man, then man vs nature, and finally it's man vs. himself. That's all of the dramatic basics wrapped up in one, and it works.<br /><br />The blu-ray is a good transfer, but features only deleted scenes, all rightfully so, and a commentary. BUT...the commentary features the director and two editors drinking scotch throughout, and as they get sauced they start getting more honest, which you almost never hear on these. Carnahan even goes so far as to say that he thinks the film didn't deserve to have been a box office number one, which is a wild thing to say about your own film. But the commentary is well worth checking out for just such moments; it's one of a kind. (I sure would love to have heard Hitchcock or Kurosawa discussing their films while knocking back a few!)<br /><br />All in all, if you like a good raw survival film, then this is your meat.

[The changing scenes are a distraction; this is a movie not a puzzle.] His job is to kill wolves near the settlement to protect the workers. [What attracts them?] Men board an airplane to leave for vacation (or rotation). Alwin wants quiet; he remembers his past. There is turbulence from a storm. There is noise before the crash. Alwin awakes in the snow and finds the crashed plane. There are survivors, some are wounded and die. [What is the point to this scene?] Another man laughs. Seven are left. They must start a fire, then walk south. They won't be easily found. [The language may be realistic but is overdone.] A wolf shows up to scavenge the dead. [Should they leave the crash site?] One man bleeds from a wolf bite. Is that wolf part of a pack? They might attack if they have a den nearby.<br /><br />There is conflict among the men. [The darkness detracts from story.] The men joke over their situation. More wolves show up. They keep a fire going. A wolf attacks but is driven off. Daylight reveals dead bodies. They decide to head for the trees. They collect wallets for the families. The talk tells about their characters. Alwin searches the wreckage. "God bless these men." Wolves attack a straggler; he bleeds out. Dusk brings the wolves. "They're all around us!" A fire is lit just in time. "It worked." Alwin has a way to use a shotgun shell against a wolf. "I'm not scared." They hear the growl of a wolf. Then a wolf attacks! The men kill it, then hear the howls from the pack. They will cook and eat it. The wolves howl again.<br /><br />They continue to move out and find a refuge. The high altitude has an effect on a man. Alwin remembers his past as a child. There is a storm with high winds. One man doesn't wake up. They are near a river and devise a way to escape down a cliff with an improvised rope. One man has a problem. They continue to walk by the river. [No compass to guide them?] One man wants to rest. Is he tired of life? The two continue to walk. Two wolves approach and the men run. One falls into the fast-flowing river and is caught. Alwin expresses his frustration then continues to walk through the trees. He pauses, then hears a growl from wolves. "Once more into the fray." Will you be surprised by the ending? [Was this movie a too subtle story of the effect of the economic depression of workers?]<br /><br />You can blame the producer, director, screenwriter, and the author of the original short story for this movie. It is not so much bad as not good. You may be sorry you spent two hours watching this movie. I understand that if you survive a plane crash you should remain near the wreck as it is more visible from any search plane. A smoky fire is a signal for help. This could have been titled "Jaws in the Woods". It is another horror story. This production company could have used somebody to critique their plot before they implemented it. Or whatever they use to plan a production. I heard the name "Alwin" but the credits say "Ottway". They needed to carry a pistol whenever you travel in a wild country. You never know.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R1HAXRNU0QX7.html">A2R1HAXRNU0QX7</a><br/><p>THE GREY is an okay movie.  If I tell you the basic story, you'll think it's just a typical pulp action film...but the quality of cinematography, sound, script and acting elevates it to something a bit loftier.  As I watched it, I appreciated the effort the filmmakers were putting into this.  An element of existentialism that you can actually feel on an emotional level.<br /><br />Yet at the same time, the film has people doing some incredibly stupid things, akin to what teenagers in slasher flicks might do.  Couching unexplainable behavior within an "artsy" framework doesn't make it any easier to swallow.<br /><br />Liam Neeson is introduced working at a far northern Alaska installation.  His job is as a sniper of wolves, keeping the compound safe from these dangerous predators.  He's also contemplating suicide, but holds off at the last moment.  Thus, he ends up on an ill-fated flight from the installation.  The plane goes down in the middle of nowhere, leaving about seven survivors amidst the wreckage.  It is during these post-crash scenes that we truly get to see what a natural, physical leader Neeson's character is.  He barks orders that quickly organize the survivors and he sternly but gently attends the dying moments of a passenger as he bleeds out.  The death is looked upon in a series of powerful close-ups...and the stage is set that this isn't merely a movie in which a death is simple and unemotional.  The scene has power, and it also serves as the moment when the other survivors (for the most part) embrace the notion that Neeson is going to be their leader.<br /><br />Soon, they discover that their wrecked fuselage is being stalked by man-eating wolves.  So Neeson decides that instead of waiting for possible but unlikely rescue in the plane and facing the wolves there, he suggests they grab what supplies they can and head for a tree line off in the distance, because he thinks the wolves MIGHT leave them alone if they think the men are leaving their territory.  This is a central decision, because most of the film follows thereafter...and yet it is not for ONE SECOND convincing.  It is stupid on the face of it.  Yes, wolves are stalking them...but they are in a location which provides some shelter from the HARSH wintry conditions, they have food and luggage to rummage through (which they never thoroughly do...who's to say someone wasn't carrying a satellite phone in their bag?) and it seems unlikely the wolves would swarm en masse into a giant steel structure.  And wouldn't large, ragged pieces of steel make excellent weapons against the wolves?  Instead, the men set out on foot in the hopes the wolves will leave them alone.  To say they made the wrong choice is understating matters (this is hardly a spoiler...it's what the film is ABOUT).  In my mind, Neeson is instantly established as a charismatic, tough-talking, tough-minded, physically adept FOOL.<br /><br />Once they have made this choice, what follows are a series of man vs. man & man vs. nature encounters.  The characters are all nicely sketched, and some, such as the ex-con presented by Frank Grillo, are actually very well-rounded.  The men bond.  They fight.  They endure.  They make ever more desperate choices.  And the movie actually asks some big questions about death and facing death.  The manner in which we chose to go out...when given a choice.  As I said, it's more existential than you might expect.  There is less action and more contemplation that some viewers probably expect.  It's refreshing that the film would take the time to explore some of the moral quandaries it does.  And it ends more logically than I would have expected, given some of the dumb choices from earlier in the film.<br /><br />I got past the terrible decision making early in the film, because I appreciated the excellent technical filmmaking throughout.  Director Joe Carnahan has given us a mean, unforgiving film...not a soft adventure where you can predict 10 minutes into it who will live and who will die.<br /><br />But even with all the good things I just said, THE GREY is lacking.  Just little things.  The weather is incredibly cold, yet frostbite and exposed faces is a non-issue.  A wolf viciously attacks one man, yet when the wolf is fought off, the man has virtually no injuries...yet in an earlier, similar scene, the victim is torn apart.  There are just enough annoying inconsistencies, coupled with the one really bad initial decision to have pulled me out of really committing to this film.  It's ultimately a three-star, just barely recommend for me.</p></br><a href="../users/A3956O40ZZYFMY.html">A3956O40ZZYFMY</a><br/><p>The only reason to watch this movie is to enjoy Mr. Neeson. The movie itself is absolutely absurd. "Mr. Outdoors", played by Neeson made every wrong decision starting with his employment at the oil camp.<br />So many dreadful errors in judgements made me want to turn the movie off, as did the stereotyping of the differing characters, especially the former prison inmate.<br />I wont get into why there were shotgun shells found but no shotgun or how Mr. Neesons rifle was broken while it's case remained intact.<br />I wont go into detail as to why on earth they ever left the relative safe haven they could have made the remnants of the crashed aircraft into while awaiting rescue (there are two black boxes on such aircraft, all of them, that transmit signalling information for a very long time).<br />I wont go into detail about why Mr Neeson didnt die of hypothermia after his little river excursion late in the movie.<br />And I won't express my disgust with the ending of the movie.<br />I would not recommend this movie to anyone other than President Obama as I don't hate anyone else enough.<br />Poor movie with a great actor in it. That is as kind as I can be.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZOF747O5EB6R.html">A1ZOF747O5EB6R</a><br/><p>"The Grey" is a suspenseful film that I recommend thoroughly.  It' very intense; by no means is it a date movie.  Indeed, it was unexpectedly good.<br /><br />The movie involves a very dramatic plane crash somewhere in Alaska or northern Canada in the depth of winter.  I might add that the crash itself is brilliantly crafted.  Top film making!  There are a handful of survivors and if the crash wasn't bad enough, they now have to contend with ravenous wolves.<br /><br />It would be wrong of me to reveal any further details as to the ultimate outcome.  However, I can say that the terror of this Arctic wasteland really is frightening.  Liam Neeson plays the de facto leader of the group.  He has clear experience with the landscape and wolves; he was employed by the oil company for which they all worked as a wolf hunter.  But now he has no weapons and has to rely upon ingenuity and cunning.  He rises to the occasion.<br /><br />Although this film has had none of the publicity of the various Oscar nominees, it is still well worth seeing.  Just don't expect a happy story about furry animals.</p></br><a href="../users/A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ.html">A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ</a><br/><p>"The Grey" is the latest film from writer/director Joe Carnahan, who's previous outings all had a dark and moody feel to them, although this movie is a definitely a different turn for him. Most of his movies are set in urban environments, like "Narc", "Smokin' Aces" and "Blood, Guts, Bullets & Octane" and "The Grey" is far far far from anything urban.<br /><br />The movie is about an Alaskan oil drilling team that is on their way to a big job when their plane drops out of the sky and in the middle of a snowy tundra and there are only seven survivors. They are held prisoner by the elements and are forced to adapt to the very assurance that they will most likely die. They are led by a team sniper named Ottway, played by Liam Neeson, who is along for the trip because of his ability to shoot wolves and protect the workers. This is a skill that certainly comes in handy as they are greeted by a pack of wolves on night one.<br /><br />On top of dealing with bitter cold, wounds from the plane crash and knowing that they won't be found anytime soon, the wolves that don't eat but kill become an overwhelming obstacle. "The Grey" has a very dark overtone, as probably goes without saying. It is definitely a testosterone movie, filled with men being men and men figuring out ways to survive as long as they can.<br /><br />I would be amiss if I stated that the movie didn't hold my attention throughout, but there is much about "The Grey" that left me with a disappointing taste in my mouth. First of all, the movie plays out like a horror movie with its predictable one at a time story layout. There have been many movies similar to this in the past, like "Alive" and "The Edge" where a man had to survive a grizzly bear, and "The Edge" managed to hold you on the edge of your seat throughout. It was unpredictable and frightening. "The Grey" is very predictable and once you see the pattern, you know it doesn't get any better.<br /><br />The movie leaves you with a empty feeling as it explores life, religion, hope and death throughout. You get to know the men who are facing impossible odds and you root for them till the end. Yet, "The Grey" is what it is, a dark, moody, dreary story about living and dieing.</p></br><a href="../users/A3QJU4FEN8PQSZ.html">A3QJU4FEN8PQSZ</a><br/><p>I was disappointed. Why? The Grey had been touted as an action thriller. One reviewer extolled its amazing crash scene. These are pure lies.<br /><br />First, the crash scene. You don't really see much, just flashes of what's happening. I wouldn't get all excited about its supposed realism.<br /><br />Next, the action. Here's where it is a serious disappointment if you went into this (as I did) expecting something along the lines of The Edge. The "action" is nothing much. Characters get killed randomnly, one by one, whether by wolves, falls, etc. There's no logic to it, no smart, resourceful comebacks (except maybe one, making a boom-stick). It's just "we have to keep moving". Those who can't or don't, die. Some deaths are more creative than others, but not by much. This is not "action". It's more like another sequel of Final Destination.<br /><br />So, why all the rave reviews?<br /><br />Well, you have to watch it from another vantage point - Liam as The Grey, too. We see this mirrored in the movie. As the alpha wolf puts down a challenger, Ottway, too, must defend his alpha status. Starting off as suicidal, The Grey Outdoors makes Ottway struggle to live. Others - well, just one, really - die from losing that will to survive. (Actually, the others die, as I said, randomly. Not much in the way of intelligent plot there.)<br /><br />Does this really save the movie? Not a whole lot.<br /><br />The other thing that may have critics swooning is Ottway's challenge to God to save him, in the face of all the random and senseless death. Of course, there is no heavenly answer - just The Grey Sky. "I'll do it myself," he concludes. All kinds of chatter about how philosophical this is. But is it really? Seriously? He makes a deal with God - if you save me, I'll serve you the rest of my life! Now, it would take a pretty poor philosopher to think that makes any kind of serious point. The same question has been asked in worse times, e.g. the Holocaust, and Gethsemane. The answer is only for serious questioners. (Hints: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GCFDPY">Disappointment with God: Three Questions No One Asks Aloud</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0310245729">Where Is God When It Hurts?</a>.)<br /><br />"God is not there because terrible things happen"? When people are gassed in Nazi showers? When you are whipped and your back laid open? When a crown of thorns is jammed onto your head and you are beaten repeatedly on that same head and spit upon, perhaps? When you are nailed to a cross with iron spikes? Perhaps, perhaps not ...<br /><br />There is some decent characterization here. We learn why Ottway's wife left him, and why he's suicidal. His "scum of the earth" companions seem like real people. That makes the randomness of their demises more jarring. And I kept wondering why they didn't just burn the trees around them that harbored their predators, but I'm probably just ignorant of tree-burning lore.</p></br><a href="../users/A3APW42N5MRVWT.html">A3APW42N5MRVWT</a><br/><p>A group of men work at an outpost where they draw natural resources from a planet (oil, I believe, in this case). Liam Neeson is a sniper who picks off the local predators when they attack. Some of the men are flying back to their primary settlement called Anchorage, I assume it is so named because the outline of the landmass is remarkably similar to that of Alaska. Their transport crashes in a frozen wilderness. They are beset by the predators which bear a superficial physical resemblance to wolves. The men even call them "wolves". These aren't very creative people.<br /><br />The story of how the survivors of the crash persevere is well made and includes some very good scenes. Overall though, it's a pretty stupid movie. The animated/animatronic creatures aren't especially credible. And it's pretty obvious the reason these predators are attacking is that the humans have wiped out their natural prey - after all they are the only non-human creatures we see in an entire two hour movie that takes place entirely out doors. As a survey of varieties of ways to die, though, it's pretty thorough.</p></br><a href="../users/A7Y6AVS576M03.html">A7Y6AVS576M03</a><br/><p>This is a powerful survival film that works on many levels. It is haunting in nature as the underlying psychological implications become blurred. I was expecting something different and as this film unfolded I became totally engrossed by the somewhat mythological and operatic sights and sounds of man alone, yet not alone. The pace is lethargic and mystical in nature. The payoff is introspective. The forces at work are powerful and test the fabric of what we truly are.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FY3H6F4249E0.html">A3FY3H6F4249E0</a><br/><p>Wow! This was one of the best movies I've seen in awhile! It is a survival in the wilderness type movie, somewhat similar to "The Edge" with Sir Anthony Hopkins. It had my eyes GLUED to the screen, afraid to turn away for fear I might miss something. And I would watch this flick again, in a heartbeat! AND, I can't wait till the video comes out.<br /><br />The movie begins with shots of the Canadian Rocky Mountains and wolves howling, then you see frozen icy land.  Liam Neeson is a wolf sniper for a big petroleum company way up north.  Snow and ice is everywhere.  Neeson is missing his wife and has frequent visuals of her.<br /><br />In the very early beginnings of the movie, Neeson and other guys take a small plane to Archorage, Alaska and the plane goes down, crashing into frozen nowhere land.  Amidst the bitter temperatures, knee deep snow, icy waters, and brutal howling wind, Neeson and the guys attempt to survive.  But WAIT, there are vicious snapping, WOLVES, too, lurking around every corner!<br /><br />Shot amidst Vancouver and Alberta, Canada, including the beautiful Canadian Rockies, this is heart-thumping suspense.  When it was over, all I could say was "WOW!"<br /><br />BTW, watch the credits. Immediately after is a final shot that adds to the movie.<br />BTW#2 - Lots of blood so I do not recommend for younger children.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BFIYZYNK54QX.html">A2BFIYZYNK54QX</a><br/><p>Director Joe Carnahan made such a promising and exciting start in the feature film business with the 70's crime drama throwback NARC. It was strong, exciting and a shot in the arm to a tiring genre. He followed that up with the bizarre yet oddly entertaining ensemble actioner SMOKING ACES, but once locked into the Hollywood machine, he did the unnecessary but not-too-terrible film version of the 80's TV show THE A-TEAM, which teamed him for the first time with strong dramatic actor who became rebranded as action star Liam Neeson. This somehow led to THE GREY, a film that is not the survival adventure promised in the previews. THE GREY is an occasionally thoughtful, extremely existental, and ultimately predictible Man Versus Nature drama.<br /><br />We have John Ottway (Neeson, finally being allowed to speak in his natural accent), a gruff and suicidally depressed "exterminator" of sorts who works on an oil-drilling site in Alaska. His job essentially consists of picking off nasty man-eating wolves that look to use the workers as kibble with his rifle. He ponders poetically about his wife and how he misses her and how he knows he'll never be with her again. The other workers are, for the most part, societal outcasts; they're ex-cons, drifters, quick to anger and violence, meaning that Ottway is right at home with them. But it's time for them to go home, so they catch a plane back to Anchorage. There are warnings of a storm, or as co-writers Carnahan and Ian Mackenzie Jeffers (who wrote the short story this film is based on) call it, foreshadowing. The plane naturally crashes (in an uncomfortably effective set piece) and Ottway finds himself taking charge of a ragged and motley crew of survivors and look to stay alive amongst the harsh weather of the Alaska's snowy wastelands. Before too long, it seems that Ottway's work has followed him to the crash site as they soon find themselves surrounded by a pack of vicious ravening wolves. So instead of this being a story about men coming together and fighting the elements, it becomes something of a horror film as the men begin getting picked off one by one as Ottway tries to lead them to safety.<br /><br />Despite the film's massive leaps of logic and sense in order to manufacture forward momentum, it's an interesting film to watch. Carnahan does a commendable job of showing the brutal and unforgiving climate and also shows some beautiful vistas of the Alaskan wilderness. He's also pretty good at creating suspense, but it's really just enough to keep you watching despite knowing just about everything that's going to happen. You know that the film will become allegorical at one point for the behavior of the animals and the behavior of the men. You know there will be someone that will eventually challenge Ottway's "alpha" status, and that comes in the form of Diaz (the most interesting character of the film as played by a very volatile Frank Grillo, a great character actor). The whole cast of survivors, including Dallas Roberts and a very unrecognizable Dermot Mulroney, essentially seem to be analogues of the cast of John Carpenter's arctic existential horror masterpiece THE THING, but even that's not a terribly new idea. Survival thrillers often have the same archetypal characters. The film also delves into the nature of humanity's faith and the existence of a higher power, and this is where the film succeeds at being surprising yet unnecessarily ham-fisted as it becomes the love-child of Jack London and Samuel Beckett by way of Carnahan's profanity-and-gore-laden narrative. Neeson does nice work here and it further cements his current bad-ass status, but this is not even as interesting or as memorable of a role as Bryan Mills in TAKEN.<br /><br />Where I think the biggest disconnect is between audiences and this film is, exists in the realm of its marketing. This film promises certain things in the trailers and the commercials but doesn't live up to them, and the most glaring example of that is in the film's climax which is the very end of the film. While the moment promised to us is hardly the point of the film, it's something that everyone wanted to see, and when that was taken away from us, we felt cheated. There's truth to that. Most of the negative reviews specifically have to do with the film's ending and how it didn't live up to some very specific expectations, and that's more to do with the marketing than the film, because this is a film where the narrative isn't dependent on a climactic showdown between Ottway and the wolves; it's a more contemplative film than that. So I just don't think that we can blame Carnahan for the ending not meeting those expectations; Universal wanted to get butts in seats and what better way to do that with a film like this than the promise of Liam Neeson taping broken glass to his fists to do battle with a wolf?<br /><br />One way or the other, the biggest problem with THE GREY is that it attempts to be a thought-provoking piece of the existental crisis of Man Versus Nature, but because it's more structured like a survival horror film, it ends up not being terribly successful in either way.<br /><br />3/5 Stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ADUOVTY3TIRU.html">A3ADUOVTY3TIRU</a><br/><p>I realy felt it was unrealistic that a plane would crash,and there was nobody about for miles,except for a wild pack of wild dogs,with an extremely vicious leader.<br />However i enjoy surival movies at it got the imagination going at times.<br />They tried to get out of their mess by leaving the plane and making their way back.But were hunted by the dogs.They were in the snow,so it probably was a choice of freeze to death,or take their chances in the forest.If you are looking for a good ending,it's one that leaves you guessing,which was actually pretty good,because i wonder if we always need a happy ending.<br />Overall not a bad movie.But i think their efforts to protect themselves against the dogs were pathetic,i know i would of kept a lump of 2 b 4 handy.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>I almost didn't watch `The Grey'.  It didn't get the warmest of critical receptions, and honestly, it didn't look all that intriguing to me.  A bunch of men being hunted by wolves in the wilderness; I mean, it had promise but it also had potential to be really dumb.  I remember when it was released this past January and my friends went and saw it and pretty much destroyed it.  They loathed this.  One of my friends told me the only reason to see this movie was to see Liam Neeson punch a wolf.  So, I passed.  I didn't see the need to waste my time.  Yesterday, I was bored and saw that this was on Instant Watch with Netflix, so I decided to give it a whirl.  I had been prepped for disappointment, so I was utterly prepared to regret this decision.<br /><br />You'd think that I'd have learnt by now to never trust my friends when it comes to movies.<br /><br />`The Grey' is a tightly woven adventure film that pits a group of oil workers against harsh weather and even harsher animals as they survive a tragic plane crash.  Upon doing so, they are immediately at odds with one another, but one man steps forward to lead this group to safety.  Ottway, an emotionally conflicted hunter dealing with darkness in his soul and suicidal thoughts, takes the reigns when it becomes apparent that the group is being hunted by a pack of ravenous wolves.  Despite the blistering cold and the countless obstacles in their path, the group grows stronger (as their numbers dwindle) and Ottway's determination to survive overtakes him.<br /><br />As a film, `The Grey' is very good.  It is sharply edited to keep us glued, and it is beautifully shot.  But, above all else, there is one really big reason to watch this film; Liam Neeson.<br /><br />I'm labeling Neeson an Oscar snub months before the nominees are announced because even I know that there is no way he's being nominated this year.  `The Grey' was a January release and is all but forgotten by now.  With the countless films being released in the next few months with strong actors in baity roles, Neeson has about a 2% chance of even getting a mention by a critic as an Oscar hopeful.  He has an even less percent chance at an actual nomination.  Still, I moved to highlight this performance because it is everything that an Oscar nomination deserves to be.  Neeson is an actor who has truly come into a new era of celebrity as he's stepped into the role of action hero.  With `Taken' he proved that age is nothing when you have a voice of steel and the presence of a soldier.  With `The Grey', Neeson shows us that he can balance out the strength of a leader with the vulnerability of a man.<br /><br />I'm going to just go ahead and say it; this performance reminds me quite a bit of Russell Crowe's Oscar winning performance in `Gladiator'.  That is the sad fact for Neeson, for if `The Grey' had been perceived as a better film (why in the world was this dismissed?) and if it had been released later in the year then I could easily see Neeson, a respected and talented previous Oscar nominee, very much in the conversation of Oscar.  Instead, he's going to be shafted.<br /><br />Neeson's very first scene, which consists of mere voice over and a suicide attempt, sets the stage for his character's complete full circle, and that is one of those things that really moves me towards loving this performance.  We watch him go from this man who has practically lost everything to this man who is determined to live for something.  Watching him stir up the men under his wing so-to-speak, or watching him stare down the beast with a lustful sense of survival, stirs in us such emotional connection to this `every man'.  Neeson perfects that vision of a relatable man we can all rally behind, we can all invest in because he reminds us of ourselves.  Peering into his eyes we see his very soul staring back at us.  You never once see the actor but you always see the man.  The weight of his past and his sadness crushing down on him, Neeson builds a complete portrait of this man with searing realism.<br /><br />And that moment, where he talks a man through his own death is phenomenally played.<br /><br />At the end of the day, Neeson turns in one of his finest acting moments yet in a film that is exciting, compelling and emotionally resonant.  It is a strong film that deserves a wider audience.</p></br></body></html>

I have seen the original and the broadway play and I believe this is the best.  The colors are vibrant and the music is terrific.  The new numbers written for this one fit in perfectly.  I do prefer Lake's Tracy more than newcomer Nikki, but that is more of a personal thing.  Travolta seems like he is having a good time, and Pfeiffer and Walken do great in their parts.  It was nice to have the Waters and Lake cameos to tie the movies together.  I think the original is well worth seeing as well.  Along with Sweeney Todd, this has been a good year for the musical for me.  This movie really shines in blu-ray.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>This version of "Hairspray" is a pleasant enough diversion but it doesn't hold a candle to John Waters' original version from 1988.  Waters, with a lower budget, was able to deliver high octane entertainment on a grander scale.  What this flick lacks is any coherent style from director Adam Shankman.  It seems to be a paint-by-numbers affair that barely rises above the mundane.  What's also glaring is Shankman bludgeons the film's anti-segregation message to the point of noxious preachiness.  Waters was able to get the point across in the original with more subtlety.  Imagine that:  John Waters accused of subtlety.  The songs are generally good but are no match for the r'n'b chestnuts that Waters scored his film with.  What elevates the film is the highly energetic turns by the cast assembled here.  John Travolta, as Edna Turnblad, makes the character his own and makes you almost forget Divine's superb turn in the original.  I smell at least Oscar nomination here.  Though Christopher Walken has limited screen time he makes the most of it particularly in a number performed with Travolta.  Michelle Pfeiffer drips malevolence as the whitebread TV station manager.  Nikki Blonsky is a revelation who opens the film on a promisingly energetic note with her rendition of "Good Morning, Baltimore".  Not bad but not all it could have been.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R6RA8FRBS608.html">A2R6RA8FRBS608</a><br/><p>This musical remake of John Waters's Hairspray was a lot more fun to watch than I thought I would be. I love the John Waters version and I dreaded watching something that just might not be as strong and well done as that movie was.<br /><br />I was wrong. This musical rocks!<br /><br />Hairspray takes the plot of the John Waters movie and turns it into a musical with heart and soul. You feel compassion for Tracy Turnblad (Nikki Blonsky) who plays the "fat girl" who gets her guy Link Larkin (Zac Efron) after all. We follow Tracy and her friend Penny as they are growing up in Baltimore in early 1962. Tracy wants nothing more than to dance on a local TV record hop show called The Corny Collins Show. Of course, Tracy gets her wish--and she gets noticed by Link who gradually comes to feel quite amorous for Tracy. Love blossoms again when Tracy's friend Penny Pingleton (Amanda Bynes) falls in love with an African American young man named Seaweed (played so well by Elijah Kelley).<br /><br />As the romances evolve we also watch Tracy get involved with the integration movement and Tracy even participates in a protest march to the TV station where The Corny Collins Show is under strict segregation. Look for a stunning performance by Queen Latifah as the incredible Motormouth Maybelle, a black woman who is understandably angered when the one day blacks are allowed on The Corny Collins Show gets cancelled.<br /><br />The movie is peppered with strong, perky and thoroughly enjoyable musical numbers all of which work marvelously. The dancing on The Corny Collins Show is fantastic; and the choreography overall just couldn't be better.<br /><br />The two DVD "Shake And Shimmy" version of this release has very fine extras on the bonus disc. (The main disc has some links to interactive websites accessible only through the first DVD.) Look for plenty of material--well over two hours worth--on the making of Hairspray and the evolution of the story from John Waters's movie to Broadway play to this successful remake. Excellent! In addition, it is absolutely amazing what they did to make John Travolta into Edna Turnblad using elaborate makeup, costumes and special prosthetic makeup as well. Wow. The second DVD also has deleted scenes, and feature-length audio commentary from director and choreographer Adam Shankman, star Nikki Blonsky and producers Craig Zadan and Neil Meron.<br /><br />Overall, if you want a fun filled comedy with great musical numbers, look no further. The convincing acting truly moved me and many of the issues the film deals with are still being grappled with in our times. I highly recommend this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZHH7AK83JB5G.html">A2ZHH7AK83JB5G</a><br/><p>This is a great feel good musical with a real message. I couldn't quite picture John Travolta in fat padded drag until I actually saw it but he does a great job as Edna and even manages to capture a bit of the Baltimore accent.  All the parts are well cast and Seinfeld fans will enjoy seeing two of that shows "older" supporting players on screen again along with teen idols Zac Efron and Amanda Bynes as well as proven stars like Travolta, Christopher Walkon, Michelle Pfeiffer and Queen Latifah.  The music and dancing in the show are a lot of fun and the authentic period costume design is superior.  Lots of subtle visuals such as a woman scrubbing the famed white marble steps of her row house really set the tone of Baltimore in the early 60's.  But the film's good heart and  messages of tolerance,  acceptance and ultimate victory for the underdogs who believe in themselves and do what is right are what will make this musical an enduring classic.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>I have never been a big fan of musicals. I did do some time in theater a few years back and that gave me a new respect for them. I must say that this movie musical is done right. Lets start with the songs....right? How good can a musical be without great songs? The songs in Hairspray are fun and catchy and like the movie, fast paced. The cast is very appealing and has the energy to keep this film alive. Travolta is pretty scary looking as the obese Edna but, the charm of the character wins you over. Pfeiffer (50ish)is as hot as ever and plays a villain. The three leads, spunky ever-positive Blonsky, "cutie pie" Bynes and "heartthrob" Efron are perfectly cast. I thought the film was just a little too long but, it is one movie that lives up to the trailers promise of fun! The DVD transfer looks great, with excellent audio and there are many fun extras.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ990HW13DP08.html">AQ990HW13DP08</a><br/><p>From its opening song to its closing moral, this musical period piece succeeds in every way. Set in urban Baltimore in 1962, Tracy Turnblad is an overweight but vivacious teenager who dances in front of her TV as she watches the Corny Collins Show. If only she could have such a life! When the show has an opening, she auditions, gets the part, and, to the chagrin of the cool crowd, causes the show's ratings to skyrocket. Tracy is irrepressible and impossible not to love. She also has an eye for fairness, like dumping the show's Negro Day. She ads a gentle but direct moral to the musical. Looking back to 1962, the film deconstructs any number of prejudices, including race, gender, class, media, family, friendship, and especially body image. When Tracy begs her obese Mom (played by John Travolta) to be her agent, she declines since she has hardly left the house in decades. Tracy insists: "Mom, it's changing out there, you'll like it. People who are different, their time is coming." Mom leaves the house and exclaims, "there's so much air our here!" Hairspray is fun, energetic, nostalgic, and, believe it or not, even meaningful. With a PG rating it makes for fun family viewing and good discussion.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AYN3IIUNQCIA.html">A1AYN3IIUNQCIA</a><br/><p>Hairspray was one of the few movies in the summer of 2007 that really just took me by surprise. I walked in expecting just another musical and came out feeling on top of the world. Now i will say, i have never seen the 1988 original or the broadway musical, so while i can't say this is the best adaptation of Hairspray, i say it comes pretty darn close.<br /><br />The premise of the story is relativly simple. A plus-sized girl named Tracey Turnblad (the delightfull Nikky Blonksi) dreams of dancing on the huge TV hit the Corney Collins show but naturally, she faces challenges from the vindictive show producer (Pfeiffer vamping it up) and falling in love with the most talented dancer on the show.<br /><br />The muscial numbers were great, both campy, full of energy and inspiring, particularily the final number "You Can't Stop The Beat", which had me tapping my feet and my heart soar. Not only that but the movie was hilarious! I found my self laughing so hard at certain points and it has been awhile since a movie has made me laugh so hard. All the actors are great, some impressing me more then others. First off, who can honestly say that they knew Amanda Bynes could sing? And as for Travolta as the mom? A piece of casting genius. This is probally his best role since Pulp Fiction (and no, i ain't lying).<br /><br />This is the kind of movie that proves there can be more to the summer then just big-budget flicks and fancy effects. This proves a movie can make you sing, dance, and feel like on top of the world.<br /><br />Hairspray is by far, one of the best films of the summer.</p></br><a href="../users/A9LAPV8XNKZVZ.html">A9LAPV8XNKZVZ</a><br/><p>This should be seen, if for no other reason, to watch Travolta and Walken. There were times it appeared they were about to crack each other up. They had fun, which always increases the audiences enjoyment. Get the popcorn. Enjoy.</p></br><a href="../users/AL5OEDM8TPTKV.html">AL5OEDM8TPTKV</a><br/><p>Ever think a film, made into a musical, made into a film again would be a good thing? That's exactly what happened to John Waters' "Hairspray", one of his most conventional movies made (if a John Waters movie could ever be considered conventional!). Taking his marvelous mid-eighties movie, it was adapted into a spunky, fun Broadway musical, which in turn, would naturally move back to the screen in 2007. The results? A high-spirited romp of cinematic fun that makes it impossible to sit and not tap your toes.<br /><br />Tracy Turnblad, hefty teenager with a yen for dancing, longs to be a council member on Baltimore's "Corny Collins" show. Tracy is the heroine of today: polished, joyful, and unabashedly herself. Tracy tries out for the show, but is rebuffed by stodgy henmother Velma, who only looks out for bratty beautiful daughter Amber. Tracy is undeterred, fenagling her way on to the show via moves she learned from resident detention student Seaweed, who had a thing for Penny, Tracy's friend. All the while, Tracy's mother, Edna, lives at home and tries to protect her only offspring from the world, unsuccessfully, eventually "coming out" herself. Throw in a magnificent civil rights story line, and you get the world of Hairspray.<br /><br />What amazes about this film is the sheer energy that director Adam Shankman injects into this cinematic riot. It literally is impossible not to tap the toes, and I daresay, had it been possible, I would have been up in the theater aisles trying to move like these pulsating kids. Every scene is alive. Shankman has said that this whole film is imagined through the eyes of innocent Tracy, who walks around hearing music in her head all day long. It pays off. The dancing is THE best in recent film, and is only matched by the stellar performances.<br /><br />To be honest, when I first heard John Travolta was Edna, I thought "Eesh". Two seconds into watching his performance, I thought, "Wow". He not only steals Edna from the impressive Harvey Fierstein, but reinvents her into a shy, emerging violet of a woman. When she dances in the finale, you are so with her, err him, that her dance of joy makes you joyful. Queen Latifah gives Motormouth Maybell a sense of dignity and pride. And it's Nikki Blonsky's Tracy, who is the center of this film, who is so obviously in love with music, dancing, and herself, that makes her an incredible protagonist.<br /><br />Hairspray is ultimately about the joy of finally doing the right thing. When the cast sings "You Can't Stop the Beat", it's about the tide of the Civil Rights movement affecting one small thing in a great universe. But it's also about people accepting each other. And it's about how the world, no matter how hard you try, will always spin on.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>The original  John Waters movie "Hairspray" was one of the genuine unalloyed delights of the 1980's.  Since the material seemed tailor-made for the stage from the outset, it was only a matter of time before some astute dramatists (in this case, Mark O'Donnell and Thomas Meehan) would get around to converting it into a smash Broadway show - and, indeed, their creation went on to win the Tony Award for Best Musical of 2002.  Now "Hairspray" has come full circle, returning as a full-fledged movie musical that will lift your spirits and set your toes to tapping in record-setting time.  Needless to say, only a total curmudgeon could resist the pull of this film.<br /><br />The musical "Hairspray" stays true to the ebullient spirit, ribald satire and offbeat humor of the original film while adding a generous helping of original song-and-dance numbers that take the material to a new level.  Newcomer Nikki Blonsky assumes the role, originated by Ricki Lake in the 1988 film, of Miss Tracy Turnblad, the eternally sunny teenager with a heart as outsized as her fulsome figure and ceiling-scraping coiffure.  Obsessed with the fashions and accoutrements of early '60's pop culture, Tracy takes Baltimore by storm when she secures a spot as a regular on the Corny Collins dance show on local TV.  Once ensconced on the program, the naively optimistic Tracy, a true product of her time, spearheads the effort to bring white and black teens together on the dance floor, a radical proposition for 1962 that does not sit well with the bigoted station manager and major segments of the city`s population.  As such, the movie is what "Grease" or "Bye Bye Birdie" might have been had they been imbued with a social conscience.  Yet, even though this "Hairspray" is immensely enjoyable on any number of levels, we still miss some of the trademark subversiveness that Waters brought to the original (Tracy`s being thrown into "special ed" classes at school, for instance, has been summarily dropped).  For all its undeniable glory and charm, this is a softer, more user-friendly version of the story than we're used to seeing.  But the original's themes of inclusiveness, of breaking down social barriers, and of being true to oneself still come through loud and clear.<br /><br />As a crowd-pleasing musical, "Hairspray" kicks into high gear from its opening moments and never lets up.  Director Adam Shankman allows the innate energy of the material to burst out in any number of ways - be it the dazzling, high-stepping choreography; the gracefully gliding camerawork; the sharp, rhythmic editing; the bright, flashy color scheme; the clever, witty lyrics; or the nostalgia-inducing and humorously exaggerated hairdos and costumes.  There's even a wonderful scene in which Tracy's love interest sings a song to her framed picture - and the picture sings back!  This intense stylization allows "Hairspray" to exist in a never-never fantasy land where centuries of racial prejudice can be wiped away in the blink of an eye, and we never question the plausibility of it for a second.  It's a dream we want to believe in and, if it becomes a little self-congratulatory at times, well, who but the most dour party pooper is going to be complaining about that when the rest of us are having such a great time?<br /><br />Much of the credit for "Hairspray"'s success goes to the actors, all of whom do a splendid job capturing the offbeat, fun-loving spirit of the piece.  As Tracy,  Blonsky perfectly conveys the innate sweetness, wide-eyed innocence and boundless energy that make the character so tremendously appealing to the audience.  John Travolta, appearing in full fat-suit and drag, is a hoot as Tracie's supportive but supremely self-conscious mother, Edna, as is Christopher Walken as the devoted husband and father to the zaftig Turnblad clan.  Michelle Pfeiffer, Amanda Byrnes, James Marsden, Queen Latifah, Britanny Snow, Zac Efron, Elijah Kelly, Allison Janney and Jerry Stiller round out the spectacular, powerhouse cast.<br /><br />The score by Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman is not only exuberant and catchy in its own right, but perfectly captures the rhythm and style of the music of the period.  I guarantee that your toes will be tapping quite a bit throughout the course of this film.<br /><br />In a summer in which audiences have seen one bloated mega-blockbuster after another crash and burn before their very eyes, it is a joy to be able to report that here at last is the genuine article - a perfect summertime entertainment that restores your faith in commercial moviemaking and will have you coming back for more.</p></br><a href="../users/A18G7GG53G2X8A.html">A18G7GG53G2X8A</a><br/><p>"Hairspray" is full-blown entertainment, a fun-filled musical comedy that pulls no punches when it comes to spectacle. I haven't enjoyed a movie this much in a long time, and I have no doubt that anyone who sees it will feel the same way. Here's a film that truly knows how to make the audience feel good, thanks to some notable talents: Marc Shaiman's soulful music is upbeat and infectious; leads like John Travolta, Nikki Blonsky, Zac Efron, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Queen Latifah give performances perfectly suited for this kind of story; David Gropman's production design, Rita Ryack's costume designs, and Judi Cooper-Sealy's hair designs make for an absolutely dead on look. This film--and you'll pardon the pun--hits all the right notes. I expected nothing less from a film adaptation of a Tony winning musical play, which itself is based on the 1988 film written and directed by John Waters.<br /><br />Taking place in Baltimore in the year 1962, "Hairspray" tells a story that's equal parts humor, heart, and social commentary, all of which are strung together through song. The main character is Tracy Turnblad (Nikki Blonsky), a big-haired teenager who dreams of making a name for herself, despite being overweight. She also dreams of a Baltimore that doesn't segregate because of skin color. Overcoming adversity is not a new to storytelling, but it certainly is relatable, which is probably why we root for this character so passionately. As she sings "Good Morning, Baltimore"--the opening song--her strong resolve practically flies off of the screen, filling us with the kind of admiration usually reserved for older, more experienced people. Nonetheless, she is a teenager at heart, as seen with her devotion to "The Corny Collins Show," an energetic (and segregated) music variety program hosted by the aptly named Corny Collins (James Marsden).<br /><br />Tracy auditions for the show, only to face the wrath of Velma von Tussle (Michelle Pfeiffer), the deliciously wicked station manager. She would rather die than see this fat, pro-integration young girl dance on "Corny Collins"; not only would it spoil the station's reputation, it would also mean new competition for her bratty daughter, Amber (Brittany Snow), who's aiming to win the upcoming Miss Teenage Hairspray pageant. In realizing the situation, Tracy decides to organize a protest march. Offering their full support are Seaweed Stubbs (Elijah Kelley) and his mother, Motormouth Maybelle (Queen Latifah), who also hosts the once monthly Negro Day on "Corny Collins." This aspect of the story was interesting, mostly because the seriousness of the Civil Rights Movement was successfully given a light-hearted spin. It was in no way offensive--if anything, its message was made even clearer.<br /><br />A number of subplots weave their way through the film. One of the most important involves Tracy's mother, Edna, perfectly played by John Travolta. There's a refreshing complexity to this character that I wasn't expecting; she's a housebound laundress who uses her weight as an excuse to hold herself back. But with the love of her husband, Wilbur (Christopher Walken), and with a little help from Tracy, a newfound self-esteem begins to emerge. One of the film's most enjoyable scenes is of Edna's fashion makeover, a highly choreographed number that shows her in her best light. This character could have easily been a joke; the reality is that a male actor had to sing and dance in drag while wearing a fat suit. Fortunately, Travolta so thoroughly disappears into his role that any degree of phoniness is overshadowed. Edna Turnblad is a silly character that I wholeheartedly believed in.<br /><br />Another subplot involves Link Larkin (Zac Efron), a regular on "Corny Collins" and a teen heartthrob in every sense. Initially an item with Amber, the young singer/dancer finds himself drawn to Tracy after she joins the show. Of course, Tracy is absolutely wild about Link, with his slick black hair, his Elvis-inspired dance moves, and his romantic singing voice. Why else would she have a picture of him inside her school locker? Her puppy love comes across during "I Can Hear the Bells," a delightfully na?ve song which documents her future with Link. Listening to her sing is her best friend, Penny Pingleton (Amanda Bynes), a peppy young girl who constantly sucks on a lollipop. She eventually takes part in her own subplot; she and Seaweed begin an interracial romance, much to the dismay of her ridiculously traditional mother, Prudy (Allison Janney).<br /><br />All this and more make for a film that's begging to be experienced. "Hairspray" is a nonstop good time, filled to the brim with energy and soul. Every character, every song, and every dance step work together flawlessly, and I just couldn't keep myself from smiling. I loved everything about it, from the performances to the music to the story. I have the feeling this will someday become a classic among American musicals, a beloved treasure of the same caliber as "Grease."</p></br><a href="../users/A2GPEV42IO41CI.html">A2GPEV42IO41CI</a><br/><p>Tracy Turnblad (Nikki Blonsky) is a bubbly, bouncy, chubby girl who's a great dancer.  Her dream is to be a regular on the Corny Collins dance party show, like her secret crush Link (Zac Efron) and the most popular girl at school, Amber.  Amber's mother (Michelle Pfeiffer) is station manager, however, and she not only rejects Tracy because of her weight, she bans black dancers from the show except for one day a month.  With the help of her friends and parents (John Travolta, Christopher Walken),  Tracy not only becomes a dancing star on the show, she opens it up to all races.<br /><br />This is one feel-good movie, with energetic song and dance numbers every few minutes that will absolutely have you smiling and tapping your toes.  I soon forgot about Travolta playing Tracy's mother and just enjoyed the performance, which is very good.  Nikki Blonsky is adorable and does a spectacular job in her first movie; Pfeiffer is convincing in the unsympathetic role of a bigot.  Christopher Walken is a joy to watch as always, totally charismatic and loveable as the eccentric dad.  This movie is a lot like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006B1HH">Grease</a> but much more wholesome and positive.  It's a happy, family film with lots of catchy tunes and talented actors.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VABWDOUQLULZ.html">A1VABWDOUQLULZ</a><br/><p>As a fan of the original film I wasn't sure what to expect from this one.  Though not as edgy as the first this rendition didn't shy away from the content or occasional seedy remark, either.  I tend to wear thin as musicals but the director did a great job balancing dialogue with dance numbers.  All in all a pretty fun flick considering one moment it makes fun of Americana then attempts to make philosophical statements the next.</p></br><a href="../users/A126KX6FVI4T66.html">A126KX6FVI4T66</a><br/><p>It is good to remember the Band Stand days...<br />It isn't a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000AM6IY">West Side Story (Full Screen Edition)</a>!<br />We were young and so was the new music.<br />This movie like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006B1HH">Grease</a> talks to the 60's<br />when rock and roll was the swing.<br />Some people have tried to roll back the clock<br />and turn back time, but these songs and<br />performances show that isn't really possible.<br />A happy, funny and human movie that is right on time.</p></br><a href="../users/ASEBX8TBYWQWA.html">ASEBX8TBYWQWA</a><br/><p>I became a huge John Waters fan after his original film version of "Hairspray" hit the big screen. Then came "Cry Baby" which was nearly as good. Waters lived through these years in Baltimore and wrote what he saw with a bit of a "twist".  When the DVD of Water's "Hairspray" came out on DVD I raved about it, mainly `cause it now had his commentary - which was hilarious.<br /><br />The Broadway musical version of "Hairspray" takes Waters' original and pumps up the energy a few notches and then - through set design and costume makes it more colorful than one could expect. Mark Shaiman's music is so full of hooks that you will find yourself humming along on first viewing and then trying to get the tunes out of your head for days. And the lyrics - while not written by Waters sure capture his sense of humor.<br /><br />There are two versions of the DVD out there. One is a bare bones single disc. But this two-Disc version is the one to buy. The "extras" are hours and hours long! There are TWO separate full-length commentaries (sadly Waters is on neither of them) plus five deleted scenes. There a 35 minute or so "making of" documentary and a fabulous three part "Roots of Hairspray" featurette that gives background on Waters and his films  as well as a nice look at Buddy Dean - the actual Baltimore TV dance party host that the "Hairspray" character Corny Collins is patterned after.  There's a featurette on the dance numbers performed and - my favorite - the Sing Along "Karaoke" feature. There's few more bonuses as well that are minor.<br /><br />This is a great "Generation Gap" film and DVD. Those in their 60s will remember the early days of "Bandstand" (even before it became "American Bandstand" and those in their teens and 20s can see what it was like in America during the time both before, and after, racial integration. Used as a springboard for discussions about "what it was like growing up then" between parents and their teens, this is a great way to share some common entertainment. After all, the  dance party shows of the 60s are not that much different than the Disney Channel "High School Musical" shows of the current day.<br /><br />All the major stores seem to be promoting sales in this new release and so the prices will come way down. Take a chance.

I enjoyed this film immensely. I loved its youthful energy. I loved its message of inclusion of those who don't fit a standard pattern of looks or behavior. I loved the music and especially the dance sequences. And I especially loved the fact that it championed black styles of dance and music without dismissing white styles out of hand.<br /><br />"Hairspray" is the story of ingenous Tracy Turnblad, a short, heavyish high school student who dreams of dancing on a local TV teen dance show in early 1963. She is opposed by moralists (her friend's mother, Prudy), her protective parents, and the larger culture, represented by the station manager, a former beauty queen who is managing the fortunes of her ownmean, but not-untalented daughter. Traci works through all these obstacles, befriending a detention hall's wortth of talented black students, plotting to enter the dance content and to intergrate Baltimore TV while she is at it.<br /><br />The film hit all the right notes and much of the credit goes to the acting. John Travolta's turn as Edna Turnblad, Tracy's Mom, was too-precious at first, but eventually found its feet. Michelle Pfeiffer was stunning as witchy vampy Velma Von Tussle. Queen Latifah lived up to her name as leader of the the black kids and the host of the TV show's once-a -month "Negro Day." The high energy of the fisst half of the film was deliberately tuned down for the more somber 3rd quarter in which characters worked out seeming infidelities and setbacks. But this just set up the explosive last quarter of the film, in which the opoosing forces had their showdown on the dancefloor.<br /><br />Prior to seeing the movie, I knew practically nothing about Hairspray, so I had no expectations about whether it would measure up to the Jon Waters original or the Broadway play. But the film stood on its own. There was little campiness or post-modern irony in the film, which was fine by me, and it got the optimistic tone, the peradoxes and the look of the 1960s just right. The film was as guiless as Tracy herself, and did not try to make cheap points about tacky clothes or furnishings. Even Tracy's dad, played amiably by Christopher Walken, was not played as a snarky wiseguy, but as a man completely dedicated to his silly work (he ran a local jokeshop)and imprevious to even the most tempting of diversions.<br /><br />Hairspray has not a mean bone in its body. It's beside the point that civil rights were not won on the basis of a few sign-carrying kids, one integrated TV show, or that the 1960s were an unlikely time for romance to bloom across racial lines. The larger message was clear: we are all dancers under the skin, and ought to bring the best of what we have, combine it with the best of what others have to give, and produce something to which we can all dance together. We are far from that reality, but works like "Hairspray" show that sometimes, the na?ve dreams of innocents are worth following.</p></br><a href="../users/ANGH6401L9Y0T.html">ANGH6401L9Y0T</a><br/><p>OK, OK, it's a pretty silly movie overall. But it is also a lot of fun. I'll go for fun, even when silly. Well, maybe even partly because of the silly.<br /><br />You want to hear silly? Guess who plays Tracy Turnblad's mother? John Travolta! I kid you not! I thought when I first saw her that she was in drag, but it was not until I saw the closing credits that I was sure. Yep, John Travolta as a middle-aged fat lady whose husband (Christopher Walken) is very much in love with her.<br /><br />Tracy is played by Nikki Blonsky, and is a bouncy butterball. It's not realistic, because if she was really as bouncy as that, running and dancing and all, she wouldn't be so fat. But anyway, if you once accept the premise for her and her mother, the rest of the movie is great fun.<br /><br />Tracy and her best friend Penny Pingleton (Amanda Bynes) are crazy about the Corny Collins Show, a local TV show in Baltimore that plays in the late afternoon, but is not really a take-off on American Bandstand. There are dancers, including Link Larkin with the curl down his forehead (Zac Efron), and blonde bitch Amber Von Tussle (Brittany Snow), whose mother is the station manager (Michelle Pfeiffer) and quite the bitch herself. Amber is quite proprietary about Link, but he doesn't seem impressed with her, and in fact ends up falling in love with Tracy.<br /><br />I told you it was pretty unrealistic, didn't I? Perhaps having been a fat girl who loved handsome boys when I was young, I find the story pretty hard to believe.<br /><br />Anyway, Tracy is added to the show's dance troupe in the strangest way, but that's just the beginning.<br /><br />Tracy is sent to detention at school, and finds that it is full of Negroes. Yep, Negroes, not blacks. That came later. And she makes friends, singing and dancing friends, of course. It turns out the Corny Collins show has Negro Day once a month, with Motormouth Maybelle (Queen Latifah) as the hostess. They are so segregated that a dance which has both Negroes and whites has a white rope down the middle of the dance floor, and no one is supposed to cross the line.<br /><br />Tracy does. But when Negro Day is cancelled, Tracy and her new-found friends decide to march in protest, and insist that the show be integrated.<br /><br />There's a great deal more, including plenty of silly sight jokes (Tracy's dad runs a joke shop), dancing and singing through the streets, and all the teen-age cliches you might expect from a movie set in 1962 in Baltimore. The costumes and sets alone are worth the two hours of your time. Heck, seeing Travolta in such effective drag would be worth that all by itself!</p></br><a href="../users/AY12DBB0U420B.html">AY12DBB0U420B</a><br/><p>Last night's bargain-rack DVD was "Hairspray." I found it at a Ross Store. Hairspray is a musical and I just don't watch many musicals. Okay, there was "Mama Mia" and I admit to enjoying it. Well, I'll admit to enjoying "Hairspray" too. It was a fun movie. Not much depth. So-so acting. Light on the story, but somehow everything seemed to hold  together and it was an enjoyable movie to watch. The actors seemed to be having fun too. It was probably the biggest role of John Travolta's career.<br /><br />Well, what can I say? It was a musical set in Baltimore at about the time that the integration movement was sweeping over the country. Old attitudes and new attitudes were thoroughly mixed and, of course, conflicts of ideas abounded. I'd say it was one of those looking-back things that was almost embarrassing to view. The movie had a sort of frivolous fun feeling and everybody gave the appearance of having a good time. Light, chuckling laughs were abundant. Seeing John Travolta cast as an overweight mother was worth the price of the disc. Where did they ever find a fat suit that large? Of course, it also looked as if he was wearing his own personal fat suit, in addition. Well, it was sing and dance, sing and dance, all with a comical light story to hold things together. It was a pleasant and enjoyable movie, but short of first rate.<br /><br />Gary Peterson</p></br><a href="../users/A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL.html">A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL</a><br/><p>`Hairspray' is a non-stop, exhilarating song and dance extravaganza.  This exuberant remake of the John Waters' musical is funny, fast, and fabulous. Adam Shankman's direction is appropriately lilting in the right measure, but balanced with social commentary highlights.  Unlike 'Dreamgirls,' there are no Oscar worthy performances, but the production is so fun there doesn't have to be.  The entertainment is winning on every level, and, as for the songs, it never goes limp.<br /><br />Once again we are transported to the early sixties in Baltimore, where flannel is uniform, Blacks and Whites are segregated, and beehives are in fashion.  The plot is fairly simple:  Overweight teen Tracy Turnblad (Nikki Blonsky) wants to break the mold on her favorite TV program "The Corny Collins Show" (an "American Bandstand"-like feature) while discovering a more urgent need to end segregation on a show that only sometimes features "Negro Night".  She gets her big break when teen singing sensation, Link Larkin (Zac Efron) makes advances that bring her to the stage floor.  In the meantime, her success is challenged by the show's program manager, (played with overbearing skill by Michelle Pfeiffer) and her daughter,  Amber, the show's reigning "Miss Teenage Hairspray," a nasty nemesis .  Joining forces with her Afro-American friends, especially Motormouth Maybelle (Queen Latifah) and dancer Seaweed (Elijah Kelly), she works for equal time on the dance floor.<br /><br />`Hairspray' is set as perfect entertainment.  John Travolta provides likable loopiness as Nikki's mother while he dances and cross-dresses his way into our hearts.  The villains are nasty enough, and the sweetness pervades even amongst important demonstrations on key social issues.  When it all comes down to balance, 'Hairspray' fills the bill.</p></br><a href="../users/A13E0ARAXI6KJW.html">A13E0ARAXI6KJW</a><br/><p>This is the sort of brassy, candy-coated musical to which you either give yourself entirely or not at all because there is little room in between. First, there was the edgy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006RZ9Y">1988 John Waters comedy</a> followed years later by the sunnier <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006AALQ">2002 Broadway musical version</a>. I thoroughly enjoyed the elaborate stage version thanks mainly to Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman's ebullient music and sharp lyrics and stellar performances from Harvey Fierstein and Marissa Jaret Winokur as a most unlikely mother and daughter in 1962 Baltimore. That most of that high-kicking, watusi-gyrating spirit remains intact is quite an accomplishment for director Adam Shankman, whose previous track record consists of mediocre studio comedies. Adapting Mark O'Donnell's stage book, screenwriter Leslie Dixon seems equally unlikely of pulling it off. Yet, somehow they do and even bring a deeper sense of gravitas than the previous incarnations with the heavier elements of racism and segregation. Starting out his career as a dancer and choreographer, Shankman provides the energetic, in-your-face choreography that is appropriately applied here.<br /><br />The story centers on Tracy Turnblad, a genuinely optimistic teenager, a bouncing bundle of energy obsessed with the local Corny Collins dance show. Living in a working-class neighborhood with her agoraphobic, self-consciously plus-sized mother Edna and her congenial, novelty store-owner father Wilbur, Tracy only wants to dance on Corny's show. Standing in her way is the malevolent Velma Von Tussle, an aging beauty who owns the TV station, and her equally venal daughter Amber. Once a month, the station allows the dance show to have a co-host, blonde-tressed Motormouth Maybelle, who holds a "Negro Day" to allow the local black kids to dance on their own. These kids seem to end up in detention a lot since Tracy finds them there and learns new dance moves from them. She realizes the world would be a better place if black and white kids were able to dance together on Corny's show. This sets up the story's central conflict, which comes accompanied by romantic complications among the various characters. All of this ends with the Miss Teenage Hairspray pageant and naturally a pull-all-the-stops production number.<br /><br />The casting is inspired. Following Divine and especially Fierstein in the cross-dressing role of Edna is no easy task, but John Travolta brings a surprising delicacy to the character. The novelty of his casting never wears off, but he also does not stoop that much to parody either. Even with a slightly garbled Baltimore accent, he is convincing as a woman who has accepted life's compromises for the sake of her family. Alternating quickly between clever and broad, Michelle Pfeiffer has a field day playing Velma, though she has precious little opportunity to show off her long dormant singing talent. As Maybelle, Queen Latifah seems to be cornering the market on musical earth-mother types and gets her shining moments on "Big Blonde and Beautiful" and especially on the gospel-flavored "I Know Where I've Been". Christopher Walken has comparatively less to do as the put-upon Wilbur, though he shows off his singing and dancing skills on his sweet pas de deux with Travolta on "(You're) Timeless to Me".<br /><br />For all the veteran talent on display, it's Nikki Blonsky who carries the heart of the movie as Tracy, and her sunny demeanor and "American Idol"-caliber talent keep the story aloft. The other teens - Zac Efron as singing heartthrob Link, Amanda Bynes as devoted best friend Penny, Brittany Snow as spoiled Amber, and Elijah Kelley as Maybelle's son Seaweed - are all played with energetic adolescent brio. Complementing the principal cast are James Marsden as the perpetually smiling Corny and Allison Janney as Penny's Bible-thumping mother. Everyone is in the right spirit, and the pacing and tone are spot-on. The film's one weakness is a certain lack of energy in the camera movement around the production numbers, as Shankman's tendency is to film key dance sequences intermittently at mid-waist level. The net effect is a reduction in the overall energy level at key moments such as Travolta's Tina Turner-style turn at the end. Regardless, this is fun stuff for those open to this genre.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJPMB7N776WS.html">A1TJPMB7N776WS</a><br/><p>Any film that features a touching love scene shot in a Baltimore backyard with laundry hanging on the line (as Moms used to say) between Christopher Walken ( Wilbur Turnblad) and John Travolta (as an almost scary Edna Turnblad) is OK with me. That that scene may also be one of the most romantic scenes of this or any year is crazy on the one hand and perplexing on the other. With that being said, director Adam Shankman has magically turned the stage musical into something that is more full of life, more effervescent than either the play or the John Waters slight, though terrific film of 1988.<br />Tracy Turnblad (Nikki Blonsky who almost makes us forget Rikki Lake from the film) is a Baltimore teenager: chubby of body, colossal of hair and bubbling over with good cheer and ironclad self esteem. The year is 1962 and the signs of change are everywhere Tracy goes foremost of which is the "Corny Collins Show," an American Bandstand-type show which features a "Negro Day" once a month: a situation that Tracy and her friends Penny (Amanda Bynes) and Link (Zac Efron) are desperate to change into an everyday occurrence. Edna, who hasn't left the house since 1951 and therefore very much aware and embarrassed of her size discourages Tracy from auditioning as a dancer for the show but Tracy, to her credit, feels confident enough about her dancing does so anyway and is finally accepted into the Corny Collins fold much to the chagrin of both Velma Von Tussle ( a gorgeous Michelle Pfeiffer) and her daughter Amber (Brittany Snow).<br />"Hairspray is also very much a capsule of its time and place: pregnant women smoking and drinking martinis, children in cars without seat belts buckled, boys and girls hair greased and sprayed to within an inch of its life (Tracy is accused of having a "hair-don't" at one point) and bigots spouting the kind of gunk that bigots do.<br />"Hairspray" is ultimately a big, calorie laden birthday cake of a film: you know you shouldn't imbibe but you can't help yourself. But along with the sugar rush of this spectacle there lays some lumps based on reality which point out, not only how much has changed since 1962 but more importantly how much has stayed the same.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MYUI8IT6UBUU.html">A2MYUI8IT6UBUU</a><br/><p>Delightfully corny with a charming look that boasts the razzle-dazzle style of Hollywood musicals from a bygone era, Hairspray could be the most fantastic Broadway adaptation since Grease. The surprisingly exciting picture won't just keep your hair in a flashy do, it will hold audiences attention from the first note of its energetic opening song, "Good Morning Baltimore" right through its whiz bang finale.<br /><br />Based on the John Waters' 1988 film turned Broadway musical, the 2007 adaptation of Hairspray may not be as politically charged as its predecessor, but the reaffirmation of today's cultural values, plus a campy look at an era of lost innocence, should enchant audiences into falling in love with the material all over again. Captivated by the Corny Collins Show, a sixties dance program on a local Baltimore television channel, young Tracy Turnblad (Niki Blonsky) spends her hours keeping her perfect hairdo at attention while daydreaming of dancing on the television program and winning over one of the show's hunkiest young stars. Despite the disapproval of her mother Edna, played by superstar John Travolta in drag, Tracy's father, Wilbur (Christopher Walken), encourages his daughter to audition for the show, because in America after all "you have got to think big to be big".<br /><br />And big is exactly how to describe Hairspray. The gorgeous, pastel colored back lot sets are big, the dance numbers are big, and even Travolta's fat suit is big! Sans the wailing divas and in your face editing of past Oscar worthy musicals, Hairspray follows its daring lead character in celebrating being different. Director-Choreographer Adam Shankman approaches Hairspray with the appreciation of a veteran Broadway performer, showcasing the grand spectacle of it all instead of trying to overwhelm audiences with flashy and gimmicky editing tricks. Though his surprisingly formulaic style failed in his previous directorial efforts like The Pacifier and Cheaper by the Dozen 2, Shankman seems to be at home with a period piece set in 1962, recreating a feel from Hollywood's golden era.<br /><br />Unlike The Producers, another recent picture adapted from a musical originally based on a film, the witty screenplay penned by Leslie Dixon, brings out the director and casts' comedic timing and skill, giving Hairspray some big laughs. While the romantic pairing of Travolta and an underused Christopher Walken is uproarious, it disappointingly caters to cheeky humor that is funny for nothing more than the fact that one of the famous actors is in drag.<br /><br />Luckily the young talent that populates most of the film is absolutely delightful. Amanda Bynes, Elijah Kelley and Zac Efron all deliver solid and entertaining performances, but the real find in Hairspray comes in the form of the pleasantly plump, yet undeniably adorable Nikki Blonsky. Working in Cold Stone Creamery merely one year ago, the unknown actress with no experience besides a handful of high school musicals explodes on screen in Hairspray with a memorable debut performance that should finally steal some thunder away from last year's sluggish Dreamgirls.<br /><br />With old Hollywood charm and flair Hairspray should delight audiences across the country with its quirky style and laughable medleys reaffirming that being different is a good thing. With enough subtle raunchiness to please fans of the John Water's original, plus big performances and spectacularly fun dance numbers that should cater to Broadway aficionados, Hairspray should be just the product theaters need to get that extra pouf in their summer box office sales.<br /><br />-Joe Russo</p></br><a href="../users/A1IWWRZJOXOSYP.html">A1IWWRZJOXOSYP</a><br/><p>Adam Shankman directed "The Wedding Planner" with Jennifer Lopez and "Cheaper By the Dozen 2" before directing "Hairspray."  Upcoming is a revival of "Topper" starring Steve Martin as Cosmo Topper who can see ghosts.  I don't recall if I ever saw the 1988 "Hairspray" musical film; and I sure as shootin' can't afford a trip to Broadway.  So "Hairspray" the film was viewed with a set of fresh eyes; and I liked what I saw.<br /><br />From the first frame, it kept my interest.  It's so significantly different from the summer's movie offerings that it stands out nicely.  John Travolta has been nominated for two Oscars, "Saturday Night Fever" in 1977 and "Pulp Fiction" in 1994.  He does a great job as Edna Turnblad with a look and gestures so different that we believe this is the gal with whom Wilbur (Christopher Walken) is in love.  Walken won a supporting Oscar for "The Deer Hunter" in 1978 and was nominated again in 2002 for "Catch Me If You Can."<br /><br />Michelle Pfeiffer plays Velma Von Tassle.  It is a pleasure to see her return to the screen after a hiatus.  She has three times been nominated for Oscar: "Love Field" (1992), "The Fabulous Baker Boys" (1989) and "Dangerous Liaisons" (1988).  While this film may not result in nomination #4, she does a great job as the beauty queen whose superficiality is so huge that it leads her to judge everyone by their exterior, whether it be because of race or girth.<br /><br />Amanda Bynes who did a nice job in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FIHN84">She's the Man (Widescreen Edition)</a>, plays the best friend of Tracy Turnblad played by newcomer Nikki Blonsky.  Blonsky has unlimited energy and a smile that could stretch all the way from Baltimore to D.C.  James Marsden from the X-Men films hosts the "Corny Collins Show," a dance teen favorite.  Queen Latifah plays Motormouth Maybelle who works on the show once a week when blacks are allowed.  Latifah's lone Oscar nod was for "Chicago" in 2002.  Brittany Snow plays Amber Von Tussle who models her mother's example of perfect hair, perfect dress and perfect superficiality.  Snow has done a lot of TV work from "The Guiding Light" to "American Dreams" to "Nip & Tuck."  Zac Efron plays the local favorite teen dancer Link Larkin.  Taylor Parks does a nice cameo as Little Inez who dances up a storm on the final live TV craziness.<br /><br />The pacing, music and dialogue kept me riveted throughout the film and had me leaving the theatre with a big smile on my face.

John Travolta in drag? Who would've thought! The whole cast shines in this film-now I want to see the original again and the play. I wouldn't expect so many people and critics to enjoy this but they did! The music numbers esp. are really good, some actors I never imagined could sing, surprised me, because they could.<br />Anyone who doesn't like musicals, should at least give this chance, but don't expect a scene-for-scene remake of the 1988 version, this one stands alone.</p></br><a href="../users/AWG2O9C42XW5G.html">AWG2O9C42XW5G</a><br/><p>John Travolt is awesome in this movie. so is everyone else. this movie hip with alot of good music. i love it and so will you. recommend it for everyone</p></br><a href="../users/AOTMP0OKJOUWI.html">AOTMP0OKJOUWI</a><br/><p>The original movie is my only other "Hairspray" reference--meaning I never had the opportunity to see the Broadway version.  Even so, I could not help but fall in love with this edition from the first moment I saw it. Yes, it takes some artistic license to make its own distinguised "Hairspray" but it was fun, colorful, and rowsing.  I immediately fell in love with the almost ditzy whirl of fun as well as the juxtaposition of the racism story.  I know truer fans of "Hairspray" could pick this apart, but a novice like me fell wildly in love with the inspirational and heartfelt film.</p></br><a href="../users/A30TK6U7DNS82R.html">A30TK6U7DNS82R</a><br/><p>Some people don't like the long civil rights march that comes two thirds of the way through the movie, with Queen Latifah singing the powerful song about she knows where she's going and she knows where's been.  I like it just fine, but its staging and arrangement sure reminds me of "Walk Through the Fire" from the "Once More with Feeling" episode of BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER.  To my surprise I find the same choreographer responsible for both.  In this case, the original had that little bit of unexpected edge, but here the subject of the civil rights struggle in Baltimore has the weight of gravitas and history behind it, so I guess it's a draw.  If the same slow-moving, lurching camera and candlelight shows up in Adam Shankman's next picture, though, that will be the true test of the auteur theory and you read it here first.<br /><br />It's true that none of the young people of HAIRSPRAY are as likeable as those in the original John Waters movie, here they all seem to be trying too hard, and just as mystifying is why they decided to cast two young actresses who look so much alike, as Tracy's best friend Penny and worst enemy Amber von Tussle.  We decided it was because they were trying to ignite a Freudian interpretation in which Penny and Amber are revealed as two sides of the same coin: mother, whore, and crone all mixed together, so that Tracy would not know whom she was confiding in.  She doesn't really seem to care anyhow, as placed by Nikki Blonsky she's as blithe and oblivious as though she were still slinging ice cream down at the Cold Stone Creamery in Great Neck.  But she's great despite this peculiarity of interpretation, and even if her Tracy Turnblad never seems to feel bad about racism or segregation, at least she gets up and  does something about it.</p></br><a href="../users/A8S11VP9Z36D6.html">A8S11VP9Z36D6</a><br/><p>I avoided this movie like the plague; why was it necessary to remake John Waters' classic movie?!? And John Travolta as Edna Turnblad?!? Well, I was right on 1 out of 2 counts. This movie does a great job of creating its own niche; the songs are catchy and the performances are excellent...except for Travolta. Donning a fat-suit, although he looks grotesque, he doesn't capture the tired run-down housewife look made legendary by Divine. On top of that, Travolta chose to sound like Carol Channing and sounds totally out of place. I do have to give the guy snaps for his dancing though; even in a fat suit he tears up the dance floor. Still, his performance is the one part of the film that really detracts; you believe that Nikki Blonsky is Tracy Turnblad...she wants fame, fortune, and believes in herself; you don't believe Travolta as Tracy's mother Edna; nor do you believe that Travolta is doing anything other than a wink-wink-nudge-nudge to the audience. Michelle Pfeiffer is incredible...not only does she look amazing, she gives an ultra-sleek villianess quality to Velma Von Tussle, the former Baltimore Beauty Queen stuck in a time-warp of when she received her crown (by sleeping with the judges, so noted in one of my favorite musical numbers of the film). Pfeiffer needs to sing more often, as does James Marsden (playing Corky Collins), who seem like he just stepped out of a Rat Pack movie. The voice, the moves...this guy did his homework. The rest of the performances are letter-perfect as well; casting deserves a gold star for this one (other than the Travolta mishap; nice idea, poor execution on his part). For those that don't know the story, Tracy seeks fame, fortune, and a hot boyfriend (Linc, played well by teen idol Zac Effron) on the popular 1960s Baltimore dance TV series, The Corky Collins show. Along the way, she must battle Velma Von Tussle, who wants her daughter Amber to be the star and Linc's girlfriend. Although Tracy is plump, she wins everyone's heart with her singing, dancing, and positive personality. She also helps integrate the Collins show with a little assist from Queen Latifah, another singing/dancing powerhouse in this movie. The colors are very saturated in the movie...this thing looks like a candy-box; a true treat for the eyes, and the sound is excellent too. Turn up that surround sound and sub-woofer folks! You'll be dancing in your living room.<br /><br />I do highly recommend the Shake & Shimmy edition; loaded with extras, New Line doesn't pull a Paramount on you...they give indepth featurettes. One of my favorites are the set of featurettes documenting the history of Hairspray ("You Can't Stop the Beat: The Long Journey of Hairspray"); from the original movie starring Divine, to the Broadway Musical, and then the current version on the Big Screen. The producers, Craig Zadan and Neil Meron, discuss how they were instrumental (pun intended) in bringing back the movie musical, which was considered box office poison not so long ago. It is sad to view Divine finally getting a chance to break into mainstream movies and then tragically passing away not long after the release of the original Hairspray movie. You also get featurettes on the choreography, hairstyles, set design, and costuming for the movie. Be sure to catch Penny's dress in the finale; it is made from her bedroom curtains, complete with valance and curtain rings at the hem. It is a little funny to see rehearsal footage of every major star in the movie except for Travlota. The extra "Hair Extensions" shows you the behind the scenes of the dance numbers; rehearsal footage is cut into the actual finished movie footage, providing an interesting glimpse of the work that goes into each number. "Step by Step: The Dances of Hairspray" teaches you how to do the Peyton Place dance, done expertly in the movie by Elijah Kelley. Although the pacing is a little quick for an actual dance number, you could really pick it up with this featurette if you watch closely and rewind it a few times. As always, it is interesting to watch the deleted scenes, but nothing shown  here is really missed from the film; the editors made the right decision. Karaoke fans can also sing along with the movie using the lyric track.<br /><br />Overall, 5 stars for the extras, and 4 stars for the movie. Other than JT, the movie is flawless until the end, when it falls into a "let's wrap this up quickly" predictability and silliness that betrays the somewhat serious themes of the film (bigotry and self-image). However, it's hard to be cynical when watching the rowsing musical finale.

But "Hairspray" is also a musical with a social conscience, satirical references, and a leading lady who is actually a man.  If such a concept had been pitched to L. B. Mayer during the Golden Age of the Hollywood musical, he would have called the mental ward demanding that men with nets be sent over to whisk the pitcher away.<br /> "Hairspray" is a film with enormous spirit, brimming with  enthusiasm, laced with great, funny moments, and with a political/social message at its core.  Yes, in a musical.<br /> Set in 1962 Baltimore, the film focuses on Tracy Turnblad (Nikki Blonsky), a plus-size teenager who counts the endless minutes until school is out for the day and she can rush home to watch and dance along with "The Corny Collins Show," a local afternoon rock `n' roll dance program in the "American Bandstand" mold.  Tracy and her pal Penny Pingleton (Amanda Bynes) shake it up in front of the TV, getting excited about the new moves they see performed on the show.<br /> With her attention reserved for this iconic TV program, Tracy daydreams in class and is finally sent to detention, where she sees the black kids dancing in ways she's never seen before.  Seaweed (Elijah Kelley) welcomes her and shows her some snappy moves.<br /> The film eventually settles into its main plot:  Tracy becomes an unstoppable force in integrating "The Corny Collins Show," so that the white kids and the black kids can dance together.  In the Baltimore of 1962, this isn't easy.  Her biggest obstacle is the owner of the TV station, former beauty pageant queen Velma Von Tussle (Michelle Pfeiffer), a Dragon Lady control freak who makes sure her own daughter, Amber (Brittany Snow), a dancer on the show, gets most of the camera time.<br /> "Hairspray" is filled with full-throttle performances by James Marsden (Corny Collins), Zac Efron of "High School Musical" fame (Link Larkin, the TV show's heartthrob), Allison Janney (prune-faced Prudy Pingleton, Amber's mom), Jerry Stiller (Mr. Pinky, owner of a clothing store for large women), and dancing spitfire Little Inez (Taylor Parks).<br /> The film also benefits greatly from the presence of Queen Latifah as Motormouth Maybelle, Seaweed and Inez's mom and the owner of a local record shop.  Queen Latifah brings her expansive charm to a role that calls for Maybelle to brook indignities in order to get a foothold for herself and for blacks in general in a still-segregated era.  That she retains her dignity and comes off as more morally grounded than those in charge makes Maybelle the poster girl for a society in the throes of sweeping social change.  When she sings, the melodies are hot, the lyrics cutting.<br />  Despite this abundance of on-screen talent, the character that steals the show is Tracy's mom, Edna, played by John Travolta in fat suit and house dress, pancake make-up and wig.  Traditionally, this role has been played by a man -- Divine in the original John Waters film, Harvey Fierstein on Broadway, and now Travolta.  Make no mistake, though.  This is no mere one-note drag act.<br /> Edna is a laundress who works at home.  Her ambitions are modest, her self-image sad.  She loves Tracy, but like her fellow Balimore-ites, she holds traditional values and doesn't want to upset the apple cart of society.  It takes Tracy's dedication to her cause and her outrage at inequality for Edna to come out of her shell.  Watching Travolta, you soon accept him totally as Edna.  He's funny, but not merely a caricature.  Edna's a real woman we come to like immensely, both for her imperfections and for her ultimate willingness to open a closed mind to new ideas.<br /> When Tracy persuades Edna to leave the house for the first time in years, Edna blossoms as she buys a new wardrobe, has her hair done, and dances through the streets in "Welcome to the 60's."  This number is absolutely wonderful, suggesting the euphoria of Gene Kelly's dance in the rain and Astaire's tapping on walls and ceiling.  Travolta moves all of that padding with grace, giving Edna elegance.  Her physical emergence from moth to butterfly is also the beginning of her social awakening.<br /> Christopher Walken plays Tracy's dad, Wilbur, owner of a gags and jokes shop.  The one number he performs -- a duet with Travolta, "(You're) Timeless to Me," is disappointing.  Walken can dance.  If you don't believe me, check out his amazing solo in "Pennies From Heaven."  Here, though, he looks awkward as he tries to negotiate Edna's wide girth.  On Broadway, the number was a showstopper -- a vaudevillian soft shoe amid the frenetic rock `n' roll tempos.  In the film, the number falls flat, even though Travolta does his best to sell the solid bond between Edna and Wilbur.<br /> Director/choreographer Adam Shankman has moved the film along briskly and staged exciting dance sequences.  His choreography showcases the dancers' expertise as it channels 60's rock `n' roll dance moves and simultaneously incorporating snappy Broadway pizzazz.<br /> Rated PG, "Hairspray" will put a  broad smile on your face.</p></br><a href="../users/A329U9CDUPKXAC.html">A329U9CDUPKXAC</a><br/><p>I didn't think I'd be interested in this movie but I ended up absoutely loving it.

All the lead characters were great but for me, it was the supporting characters that really made this a great movie. James Marsden, Amanda Bynes, Michelle Pfeiffer, and others were all great! I did feel though that John Travolta was miscast. He doesn't have a good singing voice and he seemed to be trying to be Mike Myers. If they're going to have a male for the role, I think Myers would have be perfect for it. But Travolta was still good.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KJ6JAZPH382D.html">A3KJ6JAZPH382D</a><br/><p>Having been a long-time fan of the original, I approached this DVD with some trepidation. After all, Divine and Rikki Lake both created iconic characters in the John Water's original 1988 <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006RZ9Y">Hairspray</a>, and John Travolta's association with the homophobic cult of Scientology made me nervous about how Edna would be portrayed. Imagine both my surprise and delight when one of the most affecting song and dance numbers in the new movie (adapted from the Broadway play adapted from the original movie...) was Travolta and Christopher Walken soft-shoeing to "You're Timeless to Me."<br /><br />That is how surprisingly good this humorously gentle take on race and social politics in the early sixties is. It marks one of the few movie musicals to have successfully navigated the transition from play to screen this decades (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JLSE">Chicago</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005QZ7U">Moulin Rouge</a> come to mind) as opposed to the ones that couldn't (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E1YVZU">Rent</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EWBKMG">The Producers</a>). So much so that Hairspray 2007 is a better movie that Hairspray 1998. It may irk some purists to see that, as many of the one star Amazon reviews have indicated, but I see this movie as a potential classic comedy ala <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000022TSW">South Park - Bigger, Longer & Uncut</a>. Having Waters himself make a deliciously tacky cameo in the opening number indicates that he was more than happy to help this movie come to life.<br /><br />What helps is the pitch-perfect cast. Starting with new discovery Nikki Blonsky, who makes the Rikki Lake part of Tracy all her own. As she struggles to overcome her limitations and dance her way onto The Corny Collins Show, she meets new friends and new enemies (Velma von Tussle - Michelle Pfeiffer reprising Debbie Harry's role as a nasty queen-bee). But Tracy's new friends teach her the best dances, get her noticed by teen-heartthrob Linc (Zac Efron, seeming to channel another John Waters actor from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009IOR6Q">Cry Baby,</a>, one Johnny Depp), and get her on the brink of becoming Miss Hairspray.<br /><br />As things become complicated and Tracy realizes that doing the right thing can be more important than winning a prize, the trademark Waters irreverent humor kicks into high gear. While Waters' involvement in the movie/play was as consultant and ultimately signing his approval, the screenplay by Leslie Dixon is so close in tone that you'd never know otherwise. And the songs by Mark Shaiman, Mark O'Donnell and Thomas Meehan are tongue in cheek beauty. The closest musicals of recent vintage this even compares to are <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004RF8J">Little Shop of Horrors</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000022TSW">South Park - Bigger, Longer & Uncut</a> (whose "Mountain Town" opening number seems a close cousin to Tracy's "Good Morning Baltimore"). The positive message delivered through the uplifting music and great performances (even minor roles, like Queen Latifah, Elijah Kelly, Amanda Bynes and Jerry Stiller -- returning from the original movie! -- are note-perfect) make this one of 2007's best summer movies; heart and soul instead of boom and bang.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>Hairspray is the ultimate musical! The cast is amazing especially Michelle Pfeiffer, Amanda Bynes, and James Mardsen (his voice is amazing, who knew!) This film is just as good as other classic musicals, the songs and dance numbers are absolutely brilliant, I couldn't take my eyes off the t.v. screen. My favorite song is Miss Baltimore Crabs.

But that's where I found myself - my daughter and I saw a terrific live stage production and she was so excited that I had to snag the movie . . . what a disappointment.<br /><br />To be fair, the movie is a faithful adaptation of the Broadway show, which is in turn a faithful adaptation of John Water's original film version featuring Ricki Lake.  The movie is more tame than the Broadway show and much more sedate - although it's hard to see any film providing the same stand-up-and-dance exuberance as that hysterically upbeat show.<br /><br />For the most part, the cast plays their parts with good cheer and warm humor.  Nikki Blonsky takes on the key role of Tracy Turnblad, the plump and plucky Baltimore teen who wants nothing more than for everyone to dance together in harmony to the coolest tunes on the Corny Collins show.  Blonsky's got a fine voice and has the rampaging cheerfulness to play Tracy, and that's saying a lot.  Several other supporting roles, such as Amanda Bynes as Tracy's best pal and James Marsden as Corny, are well-played.<br /><br />The story also gets high marks as ever - "Hairspray" daringly takes on the racial and sexual mores of Baltimore circa 1962 - and there's lots of fodder there.  But it's hard to give a remake of a remake a lot of credit for telling an original story.  The key is whether this film version of "Hairspray" does a good job, and that's where things fall apart.<br /><br />In their zeal to sell a Hollywood hit, the filmmakers made some big casting mistakes with some of my all-time favorite actors.  John Travolta's fat-suit performance as Tracy's obese mother Edna just flat-out does not work.  Travola adopts a weird accent that, like Ben Stiller's in "Zoolander," wears out its welcome quickly.  The gimmick of "Hey, that's Travolta in a fat suit!" also wears thin as the effect is more creepy than comical.  It must be said that while Travola's performance in Greece spawned a million karaoke performances, his singing in "Hairspray" is subpar.  The movie would have been much better served if they had chosen a relative unknown from a touring production of "Hairspray" rather than finding a Big Hollywood Star brave enough to take this role on.<br /><br />Michelle Pfeiffer fares a little better as Velma Von Tussle, as her razor-sharp cheekbones and chiseled triceps embody the evil mother's frosty competitiveness.  But she does surprisingly little with "Miss Baltimore Crabs," a disappointment.  For all her brassy talents, Queen Latifah doesn't have the singing chops to pull off Motormouth Maybelle's bring-down-the-house number, "I Know Where I've Been," a song that had the crowd alternately cheering and tearing up at the live show we attended.  Saint Christopher Walken seems to sleepwalk through much of the movie, although he does shine on his duet, "You're Timeless To Me."<br /><br />I'm not naive about Hollywood's need to bring in big names to get movies made . . . it would have been too risky from a box-office perspective if the filmmakers had chosen relative unknowns but who had brought the house down in one of the many live productions of the Broadway show.  But it would have been a much better movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2YCG57S65QXUU.html">A2YCG57S65QXUU</a><br/><p>The 2007 film based on the 2002 Broadway musical comedy and inspired by the 1988 film directed by John Waters is a triumph. Nikki Blonsky(in her first movie role) reprises the role of Tracy Turnblad(made famous by Ricki Lake and immortalized by Marissa Jaret Winikour)in the new version of Hairspray. Tracy(Blonsky)has one desire, to appear on the Corny Collins Show and win the heart of teen star Link Larkin(Zac Efron, Charlie St. Cloud), however, Velma van Tussle(Michelle Pfieffer, Stardust) is making sure Tracy's dream never come to past. But with the help of her Mom(John Travolta, Face/Off), Dad(Christopher Walken, The Dead Zone), her best friend Penny(Amanda Bynes, What I Like About You), and the show's sassy co-host Motormouth Maybelle(Queen Latifah, Last Holiday),Tracy will come out on top. This 2-disc DVD set is filled to the brim with special features, including a Hairspray timeline, a step-by-step on how to dance like the Corny Collins dancers, and deleted scenes like Tracy singing a heartfelt ballad. This film will make you feel you are actually in Baltimore in 1962 and dancing to the beat. Hairspray is the feel-good film that will leave a song in your heart forever. :)</p></br><a href="../users/A18IK6YI6T3RK2.html">A18IK6YI6T3RK2</a><br/><p>Let me first say that though other's have not liked Travolta's turn as Edna Turnblad, I thought he was the highlight of the movie.  It was brave of Travolta, considering all the gay rumors about him.  As for the rest of the movie, I was sorta bored, I thought the score was not very good, the songs are for the most part..bad.  The choreography was first rate, how unfortunite the songs don't do the dances justice.  The girl that plays Tracy is fine, she looks the part, all chubby and height challenged, with a bit of rhythm.  The story is uplifting, I suppose, it's all P.C. and the ending is predictable..really I recommend it for one reason and one reason only: the singular Travolta...enjoy.  FYI, rent dont buy.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IOJE0W1NXOSE.html">A1IOJE0W1NXOSE</a><br/><p>Tracy Turnblad wants nothing more than to appear on Baltimore's version of "American Bandstand".  She goes home from school every day and watches the show while she and her best friend dance to the songs.  Her quest for fame soon becomes a desire for fairness as she becomes an integral part in fighting for the rights of those who are different.  This movie has a terrific cast who sing and dance with a delightful energy and enthusiasm.<br />It is highly recommended viewing.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>More proof that Hollywood has run out of original ideas. A remake of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006RZ9Y">Hairspray</a>?<br /><br />Okay.<br /><br />Regardless of Glamour City's lack of originality, this new Hairspray is a glitter-rama of song, dance, music and the battle over racism, and it fills the screen with enough enjoyable moments to make it a film worth your while.<br /><br />Comparisons between this 2007 update and the 1988 version abound, so we won't travel that overdone road here. What we'll do is give you a few glimpses into what awaits you if you should choose to pick up a DVD copy of this newest remake.<br /><br />Racial integration is the focus once again. Newcomer Nickki Blonsky fills the screen as the plumped-up Tracy Turnblad, a teen in love with dance and the social changes surrounding her. Her mother Edna is played by the sexually changed and fat-suited John Travolta (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QFCD7W">Wild Hogs</a>). Most movie-goers probably haven't heard Travolta sing since <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006B1HH">Grease</a> and his voice doesn't shine through here because he's acting as a woman and moving his voice up in octaves to stay in character, which made his singing a painful event. But much of that can be whisked aside due to the fact that we get to watch he and Christopher Walken (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000XPU66U">Balls of Fury</a>) do a fantastic dance number through a myriad of clothes lines. The production is so well done here that Travolta's over-the-top singing fades. Walken plays Wilbur Turnblad (Edna/Travolta's husband) and this aforementioned dance number harkens Walken back to his early acting days when dancing was his forte. You can really tell that he was enjoying himself here.<br /><br />The all-star cast also helps move this movie up a notch thanks to its star power. James Marsden (Enchanted) stars as TV personality Corny Collins and hosts the dance show that Tracy thinks is totally neat. His desire for racial change matches that of Tracy's. But both are stymied by the twisted Velma von Tussle (Michelle Pfeiffer, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WZAE1I">Stardust</a>) who helps run the Corny Collins show and also cheats, connives, and misguides in order to ensure her only daughter Mandy (Brittany Snow) wins every televised competition.<br /><br />Queen Latifah (STRANGER THAN FICTION) stars as Motormouth Mabelle, a black dancer who's "Negro Day" on the Corny Collins show is in jeopardy of being cancelled when the white-bread Velma decides that Corny's show would be better off without the colored element.<br /><br />The battle between long-held beliefs of racial separation battle the new integration sweeping the nation, and the songs, dances, and physical attractions can't be put off any longer.<br /><br />Nikki Blonsky is to be commended for doing such a fantastic breakout role as the plumpy integrationist Tracy Turnblad. Her singing, swaying, and acting were spot-on for the referenced movie times, and she carries the weight of the entire production perfectly. But strangely enough, most older generation watchers might enjoy more the scenes with Christopher Walken, Michelle Pfeiffer, and John Travolta as they watch them return to a time when their acting careers were just starting.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KEZLJ59C1JVH.html">A3KEZLJ59C1JVH</a><br/><p>I've never been a big fan of the musical "Hairspray," but this is a very good film adaptation. The story revolves around Tracy Turnblad (Nikki Blonsky), a chubby teenage girl who shocks everyone by landing a coveted role on "The Corny Collins Show," a television dance program. The plot itself is kind of hokey and there are only a few decent songs in the show, but the film is worth checking out for its star-studded cast, which includes a fantastic performance by Michelle Pfeiffer as a vindictive TV station manager, and Christopher Walken and John Travolta as Mr. and Mrs. Turnblad, respectively. (Their romantic tango is hilarious!) All in all, this is an uplifting, energetic little movie that was a lot of fun to watch.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R8PXSFGY9MC2.html">A3R8PXSFGY9MC2</a><br/><p>`Hairspray' manages to achieves exactly what it set out to do, be a larger than life, colourful and fun musical movie. This film has a pretty great cast, what with Travolta as a woman, Christopher Walken as a gentle, encouraging dad, pfeiffer as the bitchy station manager, as well as Queen Latifah, Zak Efron and the great Nikki Blonksy as the main character Tracy. This film is full of catchy tunes and great dance routines and although I hate to say it my feet were tapping on more than one occasion. The main story is pretty light hearted (miss hairspray pageant), with a serious theme underneath (racial integration) and manages to mix both well without being too heavy or too cheesy. Everyone plays their roles well and although some songs are better than others, it manages to be a pretty good musical and if you're a fan of the genre this should be right up your street. I'm not a huge fan of musicals and I still found this to be pretty good! This shake and shimmy edition has an extras disc that has a sing-along feature, as well as a menu where you are taught the dance moves from the film. This allows those hardcore fans to dance and sing along each time they watch the film, a good idea even if not for me! Well worth a try.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></br><a href="../users/AK0CENM3LUM28.html">AK0CENM3LUM28</a><br/><p>Hairspray / B000W4KT6E<br /><br />*Spoilers*<br /><br />I wasn't sure what to think going into 'Hairspray' - all I knew was that it had been hugely critically acclaimed back when it first came out, but that doesn't always mean a movie will be any good. Let me just say, though, that in this case all those fawning critics were absolutely correct.<br /><br />Where do you start when recommending 'Hairspray'? The singing, to start with, is absolutely divine, and the lyrics of the songs are so fun and wild it's impossible not to laugh. The acting, too, is wonderful - Pffeifer is delightful in her role as the petty, aging prom queen; Latifa is spectacular, as always; Walken plays the same persona that he always plays so well; and while I was initially put off by Travolta's performance, he finally won me over and I had to admit that at the end of the movie, his character is probably one of my favorites - it's one thing to portray a character who is coming into her own as a young woman, but it's another thing entirely to pull off a character who is trying to recapture the spirit and joi de vivre of youth, and he does it well.<br /><br />I was surprised to see that so much of the plot of 'Hairspray' revolved not around accepting a young woman despite her heavy size (what I had assumed the movie would be about) and instead focusing on race relations and acceptance in society in general. Indeed, at the end of the movie, we have two of the most-rare-couples-in-movies: an interracial couple (where the girl is taller than the boy, no less!) and a heavy-girl/heartthrob-boy couple. This universal message prevents the movie from being just another teen movie about loving yourself and not listening to society's demands for perfection, and instead turns it into something timeless and classic. Even better, I was pleased to see that the main character never really judges her body image negatively - she is what she is, and it doesn't really bother her. That's incredibly unusual for a movie - the usual subtext underneath all the 'acceptance' platitudes is that, ideally, you would work to get that perfect body anyway, and just 'accept' yourself in the meantime. Tracy, however, doesn't 'accept' her flaws - she actively loves herself and acknowledges that she is lovely and talented.<br /><br />Although I'm sure that the musical from which this movie was adapted was probably even better (live performances very often are), I definitely recommend 'Hairspary' as one of the best movies I've seen. I went into it dreading a sludgy "love yourself" teen movie and instead found a movie that was incredibly funny, edgy, and unforgettable.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll</p></br><a href="../users/A3R2YB0WTTB0IJ.html">A3R2YB0WTTB0IJ</a><br/><p>***1/2 2007. Directed by Adam Shankman. Three Golden Globe nominations. Remake of John Waters's 1988 <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006RZ9Y">Hairspray</a>. Baltimore in the early 60's. A fat teenager dreams of becoming a dancer in a local TV show. If one may wonder whether it was really necessary, if one excepts the financiary reason of course, to present another adaptation of John Waters's outstanding script, this 2007 version is nonetheless an excellent film for the family. Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R602SXNGOMJ4.html">A1R602SXNGOMJ4</a><br/><p>The reason I rented this video was because I watched the original with Ricki Lake a few years ago and I thought it was hilarious.  This new version was a big disappointment for me.  This version comes off more like a bad Disney after school special.  All of the musical numbers sounded the same, and were just over-the-top with their Broadway-like style. Aside from "Seaweed" the characters weren't as likable as they were in the original Waters film. In fact, even the main character Tracy Turnblad got on your nerves as she broke into song about every three minutes. And all the songs sounded the same. No variety.<br />I did, however, think that the cameo with Ricki Lake was well done.  As for seeing John Travolta dressed up as a woman, well that was worth it.  This film only made me want to see the original version all over again. Watch that one instead.</p></br><a href="../users/A9I40WFF40R4.html">A9I40WFF40R4</a><br/><p>"Hairspray" manages to capture the early 1960's, makes you wanna dance and teaches you a lesson about racial prejudice without hitting you over your hairpiece. And there is a whole potfull of good actors-- some famous, others not. I'd give the solid A's to Nikki Blonsky who plays the pudgy adolescent Tracy Turnblad, who has to deal with being different (Fat girls don't dance); and Michelle Pheiffer as the practically anorexic blonde Velma von Tussle who is determined that her daughter Amber will win the dance contest. Christoper Walken as Tracy's father and the husband of Edna (John Travolta), who along with Queen Latifah as Motormouth Maybelle give respectable performances. John Waters, the creator of the original "Hairspray" has a unique walk-on role much in keeping with what we would expect for him.<br /><br />Although John Travolta is often funny as the overweight, reclusive Edna, he never convinced me that he wasn't just himself wearing a dress. And at times with all that makeup and additional weight he was carrying around (although he was quite agile in his dance routines) he looked for all the world like a hog. Both Robin Williams as Mrs. Doubtfire and Dustin Hoffman as Tootsie were much more believable as women.<br /><br />The music is catchy although probably nothing Striesand will include in her next concert. The dancing is hot; the movie at times will remind you of the fantastic Australian film of a few years ago, "Strictly Ballroom," both in the virtuosity of the dancers and the farcial elements.<br /><br />"Hairspray" is a good way to spend two hours on a Sunday afternoon inside a cool theatre out of the July heat.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>I know that we are all supposed to love this movie because the critics say it's great but I couldn't help but feel slightly disappointed as the credits began to run.  There are some funny sequences and there are some fun moments, and I must admit that when the film opened to young Tracy Turnblad singing good morning to Baltimore I was in movie musical heaven but as the film continued to drag on I felt like they were trying to hard to be the `anti-Dreamgirls'.  Now I love `Dreamgirls', but my main complaint for `Dreamgirls' was that once you take away the singing you have what I like to call `barely a film' left.<br /><br />`Hairspray' tries to remedy that by teaching us the pain and sufferings caused by segregation and trying to show the power one voice can have in making a difference.  I wouldn't say that it failed in this attempt, but it just seemed to get lost at times within its own cause.  I slowed down the fun and brought on the sap in moments that just didn't mesh right with me and what I wanted to see.  In the end it in a way accomplished what it was after but along the way it made me feel kind of awkward, and unexplainable `I should be having fun, right?' kind of awkward.<br /><br />The story, as most of you probably know, is about young Tracy Turnblad, an overweight unpopular girl who dreams of dancing on the Corny Collins show.  She gets her chance when one of the girls drops out for `just nine months' and so she auditions.  The producer Velma von Tussle and her daughter Amber are not impresses with Tracy.  They insult her and send her home.  After one of the stars of the show sees her dancing at school though she is prompted to dance in front of Corny Collins himself and is given a spot on the show.  Tracy becomes an overnight sensation and she inspires many people to invest in their own dreams.<br /><br />Right off the bat my wife and I noticed something I found slightly humorous and I wonder if it was intentional.  Nikki Blonsky (our young star) sounds like a cartoon heroine when she sings, like Ariel in the flesh, while Michelle Pfeiffer (arguably the best thing about this film) sings like a cartoon villain.  It's just a little tidbit I found entertaining.<br /><br />Nikki Blonsky performs beautifully.  She's energetic and endearing, just like she needed to be.  In fact I'm impressed with just about everyone onscreen except for the one everyone keeps talking about.  I honestly felt that John Travolta blew this one.  He sounded like a drag queen and just went way over the top.  The best thing that can be said about his performance is that it's fearless.  Sometimes it's good to have a little fear.  Michelle Pfeiffer is amazing as Velma von Tussle.  She's sly and dastardly, I just love it.  Christopher Walken is wasted here for he rarely does anything on screen really, which is a shame because he's amazing, and Queen Latifah pretty much reprises her role from `Chicago' just without the `vavavoom' that got her an Oscar nomination the first time around.  Amanda Bynes, James Marsden, Elijah Kelley...Taylor Parks...they all do what they need to do and they do it well.  I can see why the girls love little Zac Efron, he is a, oh what do they say, `cutey' and Brittany Snow was just spot on as the devilish Amber von Tussle.  Pfeiffer and Snow made a great team.<br /><br />`Hairspray' sure has its moments of musical bliss, and it has its catastrophes of full fledged corniness so it's up to you to decide how you feel about the film.  Many a critic has lauded this as one of the best films of the year.  I say "no" to that, but it was entertaining to say the least.  It tries really hard to be a great film and succeeds in being a good film so I guess that counts for something.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJPMB7N776WS.html">A1TJPMB7N776WS</a><br/><p>Any film that features a  touching love scene shot in a Baltimore backyard with laundry hanging on the line (as Moms used to say) between Christopher Walken ( Wilbur Turnblad) and John Travolta (as an almost scary Edna Turnblad) is OK with me. That that scene may also be one of the most romantic scenes of this or any year is crazy on the one hand and perplexing on the other. With that being said, director Adam Shankman has magically turned the stage musical into something that is more full of life, more effervescent than either the play or the John Waters slight, though terrific film of 1988.<br />Tracy Turnblad (Nikki Blonsky who almost makes us forget Rikki Lake from the film) is a Baltimore teenager: chubby of body, colossal of hair and bubbling over with good cheer and ironclad self esteem. The year is 1962 and the signs of change are everywhere Tracy goes foremost of which is the "Corny Collins Show," an American Bandstand-type show which features a "Negro Day" once a week: a situation that Tracy and her friends Penny (Amanda Bynes) and Link (Zac Efron) are desperate to change into an everyday occurrence. Edna, who hasn't left the house since 1951 and therefore very much aware and embarrassed of her size discourages Tracy from auditioning as a dancer for the show but Tracy, to her credit, feels confident enough about her dancing does so anyway and is finally accepted into the Corny Collins fold much to the chagrin of both Velma Von Tussle ( a gorgeous Michelle Pfeiffer) and her daughter Amber (Brittany Snow).<br />"Hairspray is also very much a capsule of its time and place: pregnant women smoking and drinking martinis, children in cars without seat belts buckled, boys and girls hair greased and sprayed to within an inch of its life (Tracy is accused of having a "hair-don't" at one point) and bigots spouting the kind of gunk that bigots do.<br />"Hairspray" is ultimately a big, calorie laden birthday cake of a film: you know you shouldn't imbibe but you can't help yourself. But along with the sugar rush of this spectacle there lays some lumps based on reality which point out, not only how much has changed since 1962 but more importantly how much has stayed the same.</p></br><a href="../users/A2I6MHMAZZDCRX.html">A2I6MHMAZZDCRX</a><br/><p>Our story opens in 1962 Baltimore.  Tracy Turnblad (Nikki Blonsky) is a high school student with a passion to dance.  Every day, she rushes home from school with her best friend Penny Pingleton (Amanda Bynes) to watch The Corny Collins Show.  On it, a group of teens dance to the latest hits.<br /><br />When the show has an open casting for a new dancer (one of the regulars is going on a nine month vacation), Tracy wants to go audition.  Her mother Edna (John Travolta) is against it.  See, Tracy is a plus size girl, and Edna is an even bigger woman.  Edna hides in the house because of her size and fears the rejection could crush Tracy.<br /><br />Tracy does get rejected at first, but a second chance gets her a part on the show.  She's an instant hit and her star power rises.<br /><br />This doesn't sit well with Velma Von Tussle (Michelle Pfeiffer).  Velma is in charge of the show, and uses her power to build a career for her daughter Amber (Brittany Snow).<br /><br />Even more dangerous, Tracy has some ideas about the once monthly Negro Day.  She thinks that instead of being the last Tuesday of the month, it should be every day.  Is this a good cause?  Can Tracy's new found star power help with integration?  Or will the show stay segregated?<br /><br />Obviously, the movie has a serious message, but it is never preachy.  It never forgets its first mission is to entertain us.  And it is very entertaining.  Well over half the movie is made up of songs, and they are all fun 60's pop.  The choreography was wonderful, featuring some truly imaginative stuff that expands beyond the stage, even when the song was part of the Corny Collins Show.  And all but one of the actors was great.  This is especially true of Nikki Blonsky is who perfect as Tracy.<br /><br />So what was the bad?  First, there's John Travolta.  I know it's a tradition of this musical that Edna is played by a cross dressing man.  But I'm sorry, I just never bought John Travolta as a woman.  Either way, every time he was on screen was annoying.  Like fingernails on chalkboard annoying.<br /><br />One of the characters is a bigoted Bible thumper.  Fortunately, she's a minor character, but you can bet how well that went over with this Christian.<br /><br />The movie skips around just a little too much.  I actually felt like the movie could have been a little longer with just a couple added scenes to better develop the characters and story.  It just felt like a piece was missing.<br /><br />Finally, there are the sexual innuendos and racial slurs.  I understand the racial slurs were acceptable for the time.  While they did bother my modern ears, I could accept them for the sack of accuracy.  But the innuendos really bothered me.  Why?  Because they felt out of place, especially when said on the squeaky clean TV show.  The movie definitely would have been stronger if they'd been taken out.<br /><br />In the end, this movie is a mixed basket.  Its fun with mostly great acting, but the flaws are fairly serious.</p></br><a href="../users/A3572FTYUQQW3P.html">A3572FTYUQQW3P</a><br/><p>Clearly I am once again in the minority because unlike the rave reviews this film is receiving, I cannot justify anything better than a so-so rating.  The story line deals with racial prejudice but it approaches the topic with such a heavy hand it borders or a parody.  It is filled with music but it all seemed to be the same tune with different lyrics.  It wasn't that the music is bad, but it lacked variety and had a deadening sameness about it.  I kept wondering what Bob Fosse or Gower Champion could have done with the choreography because I thought this was the weakest point in the movie.  But once again -- it is OK and entertaining but fell far short of what could have been done by a great choreographer.  I really didn't have a problem with John Travolta in drag, but why did the director feel this was necessary?  Couldn't they find an actress willing to wear a fat suit?  Travolta did a good job as did Christopher Walken but they were little more than props.<br /><br />The entire storyline stretched credibility to the very limit.  The "white folks" were suitably and virulently prejudiced -- the "black folks" really had rhythm and the cops were suitably dumb.  All of this was so extreme as to seem like a parody but like most musicals the plot was only a vehicle to carry the music and dancing which I thought were OK but never rose above "competent".  I saw it , I watched it to the end, and unlike Chicago which I have seen many times, I probably will never see Hairspray again.  Three stars was all I felt it deserved.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MQQI4UYT9C11.html">A2MQQI4UYT9C11</a><br/><p>I've now seen this story in three forms--the Broadway musical, which I loved, even at $110 per ticket; the'80s Hairspray movie on DVD; and the 2007 theatrical release. The current movie musical follows the path of the Broadway musical, keeping most of the songs and adding a couple others. Nikki Blonsky, the young actress who plays the indomitable Tracy Turnblad, is terrific, but much of the adult cast suffers from star-studdedness, primarily in the Latex-laden form of John Travolta as Tracy's mom, Edna Turnblad. The use of a male actor is the role isn't unprecedented. Actually, it's the standard, as transvestite actress Divine played the role in the '80s movie, and a variety of overweight male actors have played the role on Broadway. Still, big screen size and HD-clarity on made-up pores in Travolta face and petrochemical molecules in his fat suit distracted me from enjoying "Hairspray" as much as I could. (He did do a good job researching and trying to maintain a Baltimore accent.)<br /><br />Supporting roles were filled with non-singing stars as well--particularly Michelle Pfeiffer as Velma Von Tussle; Christopher Walken as jokester father Wilbur Turnblad. The romantic song and dance featuring Travolta and Walken is pretty hard to watch. Still, the DVD costs a lot less than a Broadway ticket, and you get to hear the incomparable opening number, "Good Morning, Baltimore," and the rousing closing number "You Can't Stop The Beat," along with some energetic singing and dancing from younger and less famous members of the cast, which is more entertainment than a lot of movies offer. This one might even be better on the small screen, where Travolta's Edna won't be quite so enormously alarming. Three stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A9RNMO9MUSMTJ.html">A9RNMO9MUSMTJ</a><br/><p>A movie with lots of energy. It does'nt stop..it goes on and on with musical<br />numbers,good acting, dancing and we get to see great actors like Christopher<br />and John Travolta take on roles that they would usually not do. Lots of fun,<br />and if you have music in your heart....you wont fall asleep on this one.</p></br><a href="../users/ATXL536YX71TR.html">ATXL536YX71TR</a><br/><p>This is going to be the second tough review for me this season.HAIRSPRAY fell flat! All that was teased was let down.<br /><br />As a Baltimore boy myself who grew up and remember the significant events that shaped John Waters' original 1988 spoof on our town,I also saw HAIRSPRAY:THE MUSICAL twice on Broadway in 2002-3.Though altered somewhat from the source material, there was still a magical and infectious feeling that one got watching the big basso-profundo Harvey Fierstein ,in his Tony Award winning performance, lumber across the New York Stage as the Amazonian laundress Edna Turnblad.Fierstein,probably New York's most beloved actor, as a huge gay man, was the first musical incarnation since the irreplaceable late Divine(Baltimore's native "son")originated the role in Waters' break-out flick.The 300 pound  Divine,as well as the scratchy-voiced Fierstein,WERE "hefty-hideaway-chicks".  These naturally behemoth  men WERE the ever-dieting ironing (arning) maven desperately trying to cope with the ever-changing "rock'n'rollers" that were changing the course of social history in this town!.In fact,Glenn Milstead (Divine) was ALWAYS John Waters' leading lady!He, like Fierstein, knew how to BE a woman!( See Harvey Fierstein in TORCH SONG TRILOGY.See Divine in FEMALE TROUBLES,PINK FLAMINGOS,POLYESTER and LUST IN THE DUST.)<br /><br /> Here then is my biggest rub,Hon!: John Travolta was not Edna! Clad in mountains of rubbery flesh and tons of cakey make-up, Travolta's facial features were as stiff as a newly over-Botoxed victim that turned his dialogue into complete and incomprehensible mush. The "fat suit" drew way too much attention to itself in a badly performed cosmetic stunt.Travolta's Edna Turnblad is never a "real" woman.She instead is turned into a prosthetic caricature  that in no way captures the original movie or stage "Edna" who was a real-feeling and breathing "woman".Divine's and Fierstein's natural "largess" flowed effortlessly, fat rolls and all! John Travolta, on the flipside, is always a man encased  in mounds of artificial flesh...and not at all funny.His rubber suit floats and bounces with the wind and Christopher Walken , who was thoroughly convincing as husband Wilbur in a much-expanded part, needed to steer clear as Travolta may have floated into the air at a seconds notice! Travolta would have never been my choice.The hugs and the unashamed kisses that Fierstein and Dick Latessa freely shared on stage as the loving and hotly attracted Edna and Wilbur  wowed 'em in New York as those two men sexily and playfully romped through the softshoe "You're Timeless to Me".Here two men lightly Fred Astairishly tip-toe mostly holding hands beneath Edna's airing laundry, free of all overt sexiness (remember Wilbur was HOT for chubby chicks!) that made audiences applaud wildly as the couple kissed and embraced, free from all hang-ups.Broadway breathlessly waited for that magical moment! Here, Travolta reclines in a chaise,fat suit practically eating him up, and Wilbur dampens the candle.Would it have been too much to see Walken and Travolta kiss? At least THAT would have been true to the characters!In fact, even the "French kissing" of Tracy and Link is totally removed.Anything that was sexy and crass....GONE WITH THE FAT SUIT!!!<br /><br />Hollywood needed  a big named star to attract all audiences to a musical that many folks never would have seen otherwise  on a live stage.If you have seen the original movie and the stage musical,the 2007 version strays unfortunately even further(ESPECIALLY the ending that betrays both previous versions thus severely altering the whole intent!!!) If this HAIRSPRAY is your first intro to Baltimore, than chances are you will be far more entertained than I was.The dancing is contagious...the humor,sexiness and infectious obsurdity that was John Waters and even Broadway is faded like a bad dye job. What once made HAIRSPRAY outrageously funny and edgey is as tamed and relaxed as Pia Zadora's ironed hair in Waters' cult classic about his home town.<br /><br />The expanding of Velma Van Tassle's screen time to the point of adding a totally unnecessary seduction scene because Michelle Pfeiffer's contract may have called for it was ludicrous. The scene was long and drawn out, and again, not funny.Her enunciation in "Miss Baltimore Crabs" was deplorable! Again...big star...not funny!There is a MAJOR difference the way "stage" actors inhabit these characters verses the manner in which "film stars" do the same.A tremendously slimmed-down Pfeiffer looked good, but that was it: not a singer...not a dancer!<br /><br />Queen Latifah?...spot-on casting! Her deeply soulful singing of "I know where I've Been" as the kids marched on WYZT still is the number that brings the house down every time on Broadway! On the other hand,"Big Blonde and Beautiful" was severly edited, losing all that is so positive and right about this song of affirmation for the "plus-sized" woman...black or white! There are two new numbers written for the film version.<br /><br />That said...where this film hits all of the right notes is in the outstanding choreography of Adam Shankman who really did his homework in recreating the  dances that prevailed in the black and white youth of the time. Every step was a piece of "the mashed potato", "the watusi","the pony","the hully-gully" "the bird" and "the funky chicken"! Any youth who danced on Baltimore's Saturday- must-see The Buddy Deane Show, the "real" Corny Collins Show, will be overwhelmed and overjoyed at how energetic and totally accurate Shankman's dances are.They are slick, full of exaggeration and high energy. The white dances are more naturally subdued and contained for "the nicest kids in town"-"nice WHITE kids". The black numbers are sexy, sensual and so full of unrestricted body movement that THIS is the reason we white kids longed to be with our black friends as much as they wanted to be with us.We loved their "MOTOWN" music and they wanted equal dance time with us. Music and dance WAS our common bond in a city  dominated by segregation. This is WHY we picketed WJZ-TV Channel 13 in Baltimore. For Shankman's masterful dance routines, this HAIRSPRAY stands-out even over the Broadway musical.It is the newcomers, Nikki Blonsky, Zac Efron, Elijah Kelly and James Marsden that bring pizazz to this film.They perform as the fresh,young,naive and totally optimistic "hair-hoppers" that we were.Amanda Bynes as Penny Pingleton?...eh!!!Allison Janney as her mother fared better.Why was Mrs. Pingleton reading with "cross" bookmarks and performs an exorcism? Baltimore was then a predominantly Roman Catholic town.Things were strict.Lines were not crossed.<br /><br />What continues to be diluted,though, as HAIRSPRAY dances to success, is the original ridiculous,crass humor and justified stereotype of our "hick town" that made (and still makes) "Bawlmer" so completely bizarre so much so that John Waters' penned his HAIRSPRAY in the first place. When Baltimore saw the original movie premiere at our historic Senator Theatre in 1988, the WHOLE town laughed at itself and it was THE single highlight that black and white locals shared together.We are a hung-up,carss and very diverse lot,here! Yesterday,we all sat in the theatre at the premiere ....and not a single laugh, except for John Waters' cameo as "the flasher" in the opening number "Good Morning Baltimore,was heard for the 107 minutes of pulse-pounding entertainment. We silently got up from our cushy seats,people did not stay for the credits ( a hallmark of moviegoers in Baltimore),more than a little deflated puzzling in ourselves, "Where was our Baltimore?" ....It had disappeared in a nostalgic time warp that was somehow lost in translation even further as our "Ultra-Clutch-High-Haired-Wannabe-Po'Dunk" city slipped beneath rubber suits, Hollywood A-List actors and razzle-dazzle choreography and editing.What had made HAIRSPRAY so original was gone along with the 1960's.None of us spoke. We all filed out too afraid to speak what was really on our minds: all that was funny was sprayed away!</p></br><a href="../users/A22RY8N8CNDF3A.html">A22RY8N8CNDF3A</a><br/><p>Hollywood should have left the original version alone, the remake is just awful and loses the spirit of the play.  It is full of energy and starts out fresh, but soon gets bogged down with a overdoing a heavy message on racism, which the first movie kept in perspective for a light and fluffy teen musical.<br /><br />It was fun to look back through rose-colored glasses at 1962 and overall simplistic view of the times.  The first movie was better - even though this version of "Hairspray"  was fun seeing John Travolta in drag.</p></br><a href="../users/A2582KMXLK2P06.html">A2582KMXLK2P06</a><br/><p>There's a lot of things to flat out hate about Hairspray.  The extremely disgusting appearance of John Travolta dressed up as a woman (and not a very believable one either), the overabundance of singing and dancing segments that come across very obnoxiously several times, and the overall fakeness of the entire thing (and I never really could tell whether they were mocking Baltimore or not).<br /><br />When it comes down to it, I can't get into the movie because all the things I mention above are just too much to tolerate for me.  Maybe for most people this kind of stuff is entertaining, but to me it's just not a funny style of comedy.  If you like singing and dancing "plays", then check it out.  If not, skip it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1RJXK6KF3LL5R.html">A1RJXK6KF3LL5R</a><br/><p>I did not care for this Hairspray.If you want to watch one stick with the original.Ricki Lake was great in the original one.And so was Divine.Watch that one.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ULSA0IRUE09E.html">A2ULSA0IRUE09E</a><br/><p>Hmmmm, so many positive reviews for this film and yet it left me rather underwhelmed. I hated last years' "Dreamgirls" and especially despised Jennifer Hudson's hideously over-the-top performance, so it was no surprise that I found this weak as well.<br /><br />Primary concern is with the uninspired casting. Where the 1988 film had charm and wit, this one is one big drag joke. Not for one instant can you take John Travolta seriously as a woman, not even in a campy way, and since so much screen time is devoted to him, its a bit sad to see the film lower its' standards each time it cuts to Travolta's idiotic performance.<br /><br />Nikki Blonsky has been getting so much good press, but its hard to see why. At best she is an overweight girl who has an average singing voice. There is nothing special about her at all. She lacks that *it* factor that can grab your attention - and lets face it, if watching an overweight high school student with a weak voice running around the streets of Baltimore is your kind of thing, you'll like this. It isn't my bag at all, and I hated it. No one should offer this woman any more roles in the future - she is a total waste of screen.<br /><br />The good? Well you have James Marsden (Cyclops from 'X-Men') in perhaps his best role. He doesn't have a very big role, but he is a fine actor and dancer, and has the screen charisma to set the frames ablaze everytime the machines focus on his face. And what can one say about Zac Efron? I fail to understand his appeal. I've said it before - he is supposed to be 19 years old but looks like a fifty year old woman post cosmetic surgery. This is no joke. How any thirteen year old girl can find someone like him 'hot' is beyond me. When I was a teen, I remember girls around me idolizing Jordan Knight, NKOTB, and Tommy Page, but at least they all looked remotely like men, or boys to say the least. Yuck.<br /><br />The musical score is great, but then again, I would recommend the soundtrack if you liked the music alone. I find that listening to the CD (I have the entire soundtrack on my Ipod) is a much more rewarding experience.<br /><br />Here is an example - I had the soundtrack for a full two months before I saw the actual film. Imagine my disgust when the opening track, "Good Morning Baltimore" burst onto the screen with a plain-jane Nikki Blonsky fatly jumping pavements in what can only be termed an uninspired miasma of cliched film-hell? Disgusting. I'll stick to my soundtrack, thank you. It was quite a task watching these beautiful numbers done so poorly on screen.<br /><br />I have to give kudos to the only two people here who actually shone - Michelle Pfeiffer and Queen Latifah. Now these are two women who deserve to lend their talents to better films - I agree - but over here they had a few good songs and their segments seem infinitely more superior to the madness that are the other scenes. In fact, I would go so far as to say that if they chopped out the ludicrous John Travolta scenese and re-released this, I just might want to watch it again. They should also cut out Blonsky while they're at it. Or just remake the whole thing again. But I digress.<br /><br />Bottom Line - This was a huge disappointment for me, a lover of the soundtrack. When the best thing about a film is the guy who played Cyclops from X-Men, then you know you aren't faring very well. Better luck with the next musical adaptation boys. And please don't cast Travolt a or Blonsky in that one and mess it up.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DHQ5WO80X1IZ.html">A3DHQ5WO80X1IZ</a><br/><p>This was truly a great movie, one of my only full Four Star ratings so far! Exuberant and totally non-cynical, it was a blast to watch! Never saw the original movie, but I did see the play. This is even better, with a great leading lady in Nikki Blonsky - her first movie role, she just steals every scene she's in. Reminds me of Jennifer Hudson in 'Dreamgirls', but this is an even better movie. Even John Travolta in drag works well.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ALOIPRR8Q06J.html">A1ALOIPRR8Q06J</a><br/><p>This ain't exactly my cup of tea, but I can enjoy movies that aren't my normal fare. We should all be open minded and try new things. Take a walk on the wild side, you know what I mean?? But anyway, if you enjoyed HAIRSPRAY you should definitely check out John Water's film version. The original film had Sonny Bono, Debbie Harry, and Ricki Lake in it. I've seen most of this one and I saw Water's version years ago. Waters is a talented cat. By the way, if you like HAIRSPRAY and are one of those unfortunate souls out there that have not experienced other classic comedies by John Waters PINK FLAMINGOS comes highly recommended. It's just good light entertainment for the family to enjoy.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DAOL3NMHEPLS.html">A1DAOL3NMHEPLS</a><br/><p>I've seen (and mostly forgotten) the 1988 (John Waters) version, and was looking forward to this one. Overall, I was slightly disappointed. The movie can't quite decide if it's a light comedy about a teenage dance show, a socially conscious film about race relations, or an over-the-top satire. I found Tracy's earnest social consciousness forced and not believable, and many of the songs (particularly the opener) flat and mildly annoying.  On the other hand, the performances by Michelle Pfeiffer and Christopher Walken were great, especially the scene where the two of them are alone in the gag-gift shop. The dance numbers were also well-staged and great fun.</p></br><a href="../users/A25QJBK33C4O0R.html">A25QJBK33C4O0R</a><br/><p>High definition versions of Hairspray, the new (2007) version with Nikki Blonsky as Tracy Turnblad, John Travolta in drag as her mother, and Christopher Walken as her father are (sadly for this HD DVD fan) available in Blu-ray only currently.<br /><br />I had seen the older version years ago, but couldn't remember any of it.  My wife loved the new version of movie in the theatre. She saw it with friends of the African-American persuasion who were somewhat shocked by some early sequences in the movie, but they came around as the movie kept going.<br /><br />The film looked great on Blu-ray, nice, bright and colorful throughout. Some excellent effects in spots (the Harry Potter talking -- in this case singing -- picture effect as an example). If you like Musicals, this version is very entertaining. If you hate musicals, then skip it. Worth owning if you are a John Waters fan, but personally I rate it a 4/5 star rental as I just can't see myself rewatching this one enough times to justify space in my own video collection. People that love musicals should definitely make the space though :-)</p></br><a href="../users/A2RKI7RPP5CJMG.html">A2RKI7RPP5CJMG</a><br/><p>As much as I enjoy the original "Hairspray" featuring Ricki Lake, there's just something about this new version (a blend of the original film and the 2002 Broadway musical) that I really love.  I won't go so far as to say that I prefer this version to the original, but it definitely does not stand in the 1988 film's shadow.  Newcomer Nikki Blonsky takes the reins as Tracy Turnblad, the sweetly rebellious chubby girl who takes a stand (or a dance step) against prejudice and racism in 1962 Baltimore.  All Tracy wants to do is become a featured dancer on the Corny Collins show and woo Link Larkin (Zac Efron, of the "High School Musical" films).  In order to do that, she has to audition for the show.  After running into a roadblock called Velma Von Tussel (the devilishly funny Michelle Pfeiffer) and not getting to be on the program, she literally dances her way on to the set when she learns a few dance moves from Seaweed (Elijah Kelley), a young black man she meets in school detention.  As the story rolls along, Tracy sees not only racial discrimination, but discrimination of anybody who's just a little bit different than the "norm" in Baltimore.<br /><br />This story, on the surface, seems very light and happy.  However, it deals with the very real and very serious issue of discrimination on a number of levels.  The race issue is at the forefront, but there are a few other issues at hand.  Tracy's mother (gamely played by John Travolta, although his makeup looks very Muppet-like) struggles with the embarassment of being very overweight.  Tracy's friend, Penny (a very perky Amanda Bynes in a limited role) feels as if she's living in a prison at home.  Link has to make a decision about what's right for everybody and what's right for him career-wise.  Then there's Von Tussel, her daughter (Brittany Snow of "John Tucker Must Die"), and the local TV station unwilling to integrate the Corny Collins show despite the demands of Collins (a slicked-up James Marsden) and Motormouth Maybelle (Queen Latifah, in a surprisingly excellent performance).<br /><br />The music and dance numbers are excellent, with amazing performances by Blonsky, Kelley, Efron and even Christopher Walken (as Tracy's father).  The songs hearken back to the "wall of sound" created by Phil Spector.  They are massive and highly enjoyable to listen to.  John Travolta does an excellent job with his vocals, but instead of hearing a woman, I can't help but hear "Grease" each time he sings in this film.  That's not a bad thing, though, and most folks unfamiliar with Travolta's past musical numbers will probably not even notice it.<br /><br />Director Adam Shankman keeps everything moving at an easily digestable pace and pegs the actors' delivery of one-liners and wicked tunes such as "New Girl In Town."<br /><br />There's a little language, a lot of sexual innuendo, one scene of seduction (although it is hilariously one-sided) and some mean-spirited actions that may not be suitable for some youngsters, but I personally have no problem with my six-year-old watching this movie.  The race issues may be a little bit too heavy for younger viewers to comprehend, but I think that most of them will pick up on the generalized issue that some people hate others who are different whether it be due to skin color, weight, or something else.<br /><br />Keep an eye open for a cameo from Ricki Lake and John Waters.  Also watch for Jerry Stiller (Tracy's father in the original film) as Mr. Pinky.<br /><br />I highly recommend this film to anybody over the age of five.  Youngsters will be drawn to the wonderful music and dance numbers.  Older children and adults will pick up on the sneering humor and the issue of discrimination.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>"Hairspray" is easily one of the most infectious, fun films I have seen in years. I defy even the most hard-hearted musical hater to keep his or her foot from bouncing to the melody of the very enjoyable musical score.<br /><br />Tracy Turnblad (newcomer Nikki Blonsky) wakes up every day excited to go to school because it means she will only have a few hours to go before running home to catch her favorite television show, "The Corny Collins Show", a local "American Bandstand" type show, is on. She and her friend, Penny (Amanda Bynes), rush home after school to watch Corny (James Marsden) croon his way through a selection of great songs and introduce the rest of his dancers. Among these teens, all of which go to Tracy's school, are Amber (Brittany Snow), the daughter of the station manager, Velma (Michelle Pfeiffer), a former beauty queen who now will stop at nothing for her daughter to follow in her footsteps. But Tracy only has eyes for Link Larkin (Zac Efron), the good-looking lead crooner and boyfriend of Amber. One day, Tracy hears they will be holding an audition to replace a girl who will be taking nine months off. Her mother, Edna (John Travolta in drag), discourages her because she doesn't want her daughter upset, Tracy is a big girl and girls like her just don't get on television. But her dad, Wilbur (Christopher Waken), owner of the joke shop under their apartment encourages her to go for it and Tracy rushes down to the station. Velma quickly dismisses her. Tracy ends up I detention and meets a bunch of African American students who are trying to pass the time dancing and singing. One of these students, Seaweed (Elijah Kelly) shows Tracy some moves, which she quickly learns. The next day, Corny Collins hosts the hop at their high school and Tracy decides to do the dance she picked up from Seaweed, with his full consent. Corny hires her on the spot and she becomes a popular, regular fixture on his show. Much to Velma's chagrin. Once a month, the Corny Collins Show hosts "Negro Day" and Motormouth Maybelle (Queen Latifah) takes over, bringing in a group of black students to dance. But Tracy doesn't understand why they have to remain segregated and tries to help change things.<br /><br />"Hairspray" is the latest in a growing sub-genre in Hollywood; the popular film adapted to Broadway musical and then filmed again with the Broadway score. Director Adam Shankman has created a film with such a joyous spirit it is completely infectious. Is this the same director who worked on "Cheaper By The Dozen 2" and "The Pacifier"? Has he been holding out on us? It seems impossible the same director made all of these films. "Hairspray" is really good.<br /><br />The entire cast is enjoyable and adds to the overall feel of the film. But you have to admit watching Christopher Walken play the husband of an overweight John Travolta is worth the price of admission alone. Christopher Walken always appears to be enjoying himself, whether he is doing a good job of creating his character or not, making him one of the actors I always look forward to watching in a film. He has done his share of stinkers, and doesn't always do such a great job of creating an interesting, different character, but he has a good time and this makes him all the more watch able. I have seen the trailer for his next film, "Balls of Fury", probably a hundred times and it always makes me laugh to see Walken in his Fu Manchu outfit.<br /><br />There is a scene late in the film when Wilbur and Edna dance together in their backyard, fantasizing about different types of dances. In one of these fantasies, they start to dance like Astaire and Rogers. It is simply hilarious to see Travolta, in drag, wearing a fat suit, and dancing like Ginger Rogers, complete with silvery gown, in Walken's Fred Astaire hands.<br /><br />Travolta is also quite good. He takes the role, historically played by the likes of Harvey Fierstein and Bruce Vilanch, and makes it interesting and even a little subtle. Edna has a phobia and has holed up in their family home for years. As the owner of Edna's Continental Laundry, she does laundry all day, a business she tells Tracy she can own. One day. If she is lucky. But Edna's clients come to her, so she never has to leave the house. She makes allusions to the fact this added to her weight gain, but Wilbur also comments that he has always loved her, preferring size 50 women, so I think her size has been a constant throughout her life, and Travolta brings this to the character, making us feel her desperation, her subtle loss of hope even if she won't show it.<br /><br />I was a little surprised by how little singing and dancing Travolta does. He has a nice number with Nikki Blonsky, when Edna's daughter takes her out of the house for the first time. Later, Travolta has the dance number with Walker, and he/ she joins in the big finale "You Can't Stop The Beat". We have seen Travolta dance on film, this is how he became a star, so I expected more of this. Perhaps it was too difficult, or too out of character to have Edna do much.<br /><br />The real find in the cast is Nikki Blonsky, a newcomer. The young lady is about as far removed from other teen actresses like Lindsay Lohan or Hilary Duff as you can get. She has a `full figure' and more talent in her pinky than Lohan. Her performance is so exuberant you can't help but smile.<br /><br />The film opens with Tracy singing "Good morning Baltimore", a love letter to the city where the film is set. At one point, she even serenades the rats eating out of the garbage cans in front of a restaurant and the waves happily at the neighborhood flasher.<br /><br />It is refreshing to see Blonsky, who is anything but thin, playing a character who doesn't even seem to realize she is big. No one at her school ever mentions it, she never seems to care, and in fact embraces it. After she appears on "The Corny Collins Show", and becomes a local celebrity, Mr. Pinky (Jerry Stiller) calls and wants her to become a spokesperson for his Plus Size dress shop. She doesn't care and we don't care. It is refreshing to see such a thing in a major Hollywood motion picture.<br /><br />And she can dance. She is in the majority of the dance numbers and helps to bring a more modern style of dance to the show, a style she first learned from Seaweed (Elijah Kelly), an African American student, and all of his friends. Tracy gets detention from one of her teachers and she reluctantly walks down the hall. Then, when she enters the detention room, she finds a number of African American students dancing together, trying to help the time pass. She immediately embraces them and they learn to accept her. It is a nice moment because it says something about the era; the detention room is filled with African Americans, and Tracy is the lone Caucasian. It is also a good moment because she doesn't care about the color of their skin than they don't care that she is overweight.<br /><br />In fact, no one seems to care about Tracy's size except for Velma Von Tussle (Michelle Pfeiffer), the former Miss Baltimore Crabs, who now runs one of the few television stations in Baltimore. But Velma dislikes a lot of things, so it is difficult to tell if she really dislikes Tracy's size or dislikes Tracy because she isn't a perfect white girl, like her daughter, Amber (Brittany Snow). Velma dislikes the fact she has to turn over "The Corny Collins Show" to Motormouth Maybelle once a month; she would prefer to see everything as white as bread. All the time. And Pfeiffer does a good job of making this character interesting and fun to watch. Essentially the villain, Velma is also the broadest of the characters, but Pfeiffer manages to pull the performance back a little and make it les cartoony than you might expect.<br /><br />James Marsden stars as Corny Collins, the host of the "American Bandstand"-esque show at the center of the film. At first, he seems to be yet another local celebrity who is entirely too full of himself, but as the civil rights themes of the film become more prevalent, he takes an active part in the integration of his own show. Marsden is a very good looking actor and his smile beams when he first appears on camera, perfectly fitting the persona we would imagine for a local celebrity with his own television show.<br /><br />Queen Latifah makes another memorable appearance in a musical. In "Hairspray", she plays Motormouth Maybelle, the owner of a record store, the mother of Seaweed, and the host of "Negro Day" on "The Corny Collins Show". She begrudgingly accepts her role in the universe, until she receives a little push from Velma and some inspiration from Tracy. Then, she becomes a leading force in the civil rights movement in her community.<br /><br />There is another nice moment depicting the era and the changing of the times. On one episode of "The Corny Collins Show", Amber and two of her backup singers sing a sweet song, using dance moves popular in the 50s. The next day, Motormouth Maybelle features three African American singers singing the same song, but with a lot more feeling and better dance moves. This does not escape Velma's attention.<br /><br />Zac Efron ("High School Musical") plays Linc Larkin, the lead singer on the show and Tracy's idol. He has a likable charm and soon notices Tracy at their school. Elijah Kelly rounds out the cast of young actors playing Seaweed. Kelly is a dead ringer for a young Sammy Davis Jr. and has a likable energy matching much of the rest of the cast.<br /><br />"Hairspray" has a lot of fun depicting the era, making fun of the bad (we see two pregnant women in a bar, smoking and drinking) and embracing the good. There is a great moment before the television show starts taping when all of the performers are clouded by hairspray, primping and preening, preparing to go on. Its also fun to watch the taping of "The Corny Collins Show", something that seems so of the era, yet could easily be done in this day and age. The film has a lot of fun depicting the era, as the styles change from the more safe 50s, slowly morphing into the more loose and freewheeling 60s. All of these moments help to give the already buoyant film even more energy, even more fun, and even more laughs.<br /><br />"Hairspray" is just a lot of fun.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B3Z2QHW3V35S.html">A2B3Z2QHW3V35S</a><br/><p>I do not like this movie. I wish I would have watched it before I bought it. I thought it was going to be just like the original hairspray, but it's not. It has the same story, but it is a musical. The original Hairspray with Ricky Lake is not a musical.</p></br><a href="../users/A1UFV4HALV2OXW.html">A1UFV4HALV2OXW</a><br/><p>Tracy Turnblad (Nikki Blonsky), an overweight and goodhearted teenager, is able to live her dream and become a regular member of her favorite TV dance program, The Corney Collins Show,which seems to be Baltimore's version of American Bandstand.<br /><br />This lively musical is set in 1962 when segregation was prominent. The issues of prejudice and integration are dealt with in an upbeat manner. See John Travolta transformed into Tracy's plus sized mother. I finished my viewing with a smile on my face and songs in my head, especially "You Can't Stop the Beat" and "Big, Blonde and Beautiful" (sang by Queen Latifah).</p></br><a href="../users/AGEIT17HENDIS.html">AGEIT17HENDIS</a><br/><p>If I were reviewing this off-beat musical comedy from a political perspective I would have to classify this film about the virtues of  show tunes as a tool for racial harmony in early 1960s Baltimore, before the out-front racial polarization of the city were exposed and Spiro Agnew hit the scene, as an integrationist's daydream, and a segregationist's nightmare. And at that political level the theme just doesn't work, although the sub-theme about accepting differences (racial, ethnic, gender, size) has a certain appeal. But all of this is to take this sweet fluff of a film way beyond those rationale political parameters.<br /><br />What does work? Well, a nice little odd-ball, not exactly cookie-cutter American family, circa 1960, with some big dreams and some big women (?) get to play center stage in the quest for the American dream, or one of the early 1960s variant of it- stardom in the music and/or television world.  The current "American Idol" is only the latest in a long line of such efforts. Here the plot revolves around becoming "top dog" on one of the old after school dance shows that were a staple of 1950s-early 1960s television to keep restless kids under control for a few hours until dad got home. To that extent the plot is just a ruse for some great songs about those above-mentioned social differences and how to deal with those differences in a quirky and dreamy interracial way.<br /><br />The real kicker here though are the performances of John Travolta (yes, that John Travolta) as the over-sized mother, Edna, who can still dance up a storm, the usually bad guy-playing Christopher Walken as the supportive and skinny dad, Wilbur, and normally good girl, and always femme fatale Michelle Pfeiffer, as the plotting television station manager makes this thing appealing to a non-teenager. And, of course Queen Latifah being, well.... Queen Latifah. The high school kids led by Tracy (Nikki Blonsky), black and white, good or bad, sweet or vicious are just there to glue this thing together. Watch this couple of hours of an integrationist's daydream.</p></br><a href="../users/A39IY0JU5JI69G.html">A39IY0JU5JI69G</a><br/><p>I enjoyed this but after reading some of the reviews I think I'd better check out the original John Waters film---I might like that better.  Having not seen that nor the stage version I had nothing to compare this with so I just took it as it came, and I liked it.  The cast was surprisingly good.  Christopher Walken is always very watchable; here is he cast as a relatively weak man and that's sometimes hard to do and still have it be interesting.  His dance duet with Travolta as Edna on the back porch is really lovely.  I kept thinking how much fun they must have had.<br /><br />Much has been said, pro and con about Travolta.  Since I didn't see Divine or the guy who did such a good job on stage, I can't compare.  I really liked him and thought his decision to play Edna "straight" was a wise one...I found myself thinking that this was a real person, Edna, not a guy playing a woman.  It probably would be a lot easier to go for camp but I liked what he did with it...made the character genuinely sympathetic.  He was also very funny and I tended to watch him no matter who else was in the scene.  OK, his accent wasn't perfect but he was the only one who at least attempted a Baltimore accent and at times he got it.<br /><br />Michelle Pfeiffer was beautiful in a thankless role as the stereotyped up-tight White ex-Beauty queen. Queen Latifah was also beautiful as the steotyped warm hearted Black woman. Allison Janney plays another steotype--the cruel White Bible thumper.  (egad...all these stereotypes!!)  I might be the only person on the planet who got a little tired of Nikki Blonsky's one-dimensional role and I was at least glad she didn't win the Miss Hairspray contest.  Another stereotype---the fat girl with the heart of gold who wins the cute guy...not very realistic and why didn't she fall for a nice nerdy guy?  No, she wanted the cutie...so is she superficial or what?  Well....if you don't get too caught up in all the Messages that the film is trying to force at you, and just enjoy the energy and dancing, this is not a bad way to spend two hours.  (I wanted to correct my rating to three stars but couldn't figure out how to do it.)</p></br><a href="../users/AOYTQFRLD8VLP.html">AOYTQFRLD8VLP</a><br/><p>John Waters has a cameo in this upbeat, spirited, revamped musical version of his 1988 screen play.<br /> Via the direction of Adam Shankman (who also makes a cameo appearance), wer are introduced to a hefty, but very self assured teenager named Tracy Turnblad (a sunny Nikki Blonsky, displaying a lot of verve in her premiere film role) as she prepares for school in her working class neighborhood. Despite her run-down surroundings, she is filled with infectious optimism as she expresses her desire to appear  on the "Corny Collins ( James Marsden) Show", a dance program for teens. It is a good morning in her 1962 Baltimore indeed!<br /> She endures strife from her teacher Miss Wimsey (Jayne Eastwood, who appeared with co-star, Queen Latifah in 2002's "Chicago") for everything from the size of her fashionable bouffant ( which isn't that high) to tardiness, and enjoys the company of her lollipop-sucking best friend, Penny Pingleton (Amanda Bynes), the child of an incarcerated  father and an overly religious mother, Prudy ( Allison Janney); Penny believes<br /> in Tracey and is content to follow her lead. In turn, she gradually develops her own self assertiveness despite her mother's constraints on her life.<br /> Among the so-called "Nicest Kids in Town"--the Council members on Tracy's favorite program, are lead singer, Link Larkin (Zac Efron), and Elvis wanna-be, and his not-so-nice Amber Von Tussle(Brittny Snow), the daughter of WYTZ's station manager, Velma Von Tussle( Michelle Pfeiffer).The latter torments Tracy in school as well, and we see how the expression "Like mother, like daughter" applies as both bully co-workers and Council members into giving Amber, who, at best, is a mediocre dancer, the lion's share of the spotlight, and relegating<br />R&B dic jockey Motormouth Maybelle( Queen Latifah) and the African American dancers only to appearances on the show's "Negro Day", the last Tuesday of every month.<br /> Periodic musical song-and dance man, Christopher Walken plays Tracy's  father, Wilber, who encourages her ambitions, whereas her mother, Edna (John Travolta, continuing the tradition of playing Mrs. Turnblad as a man in drag, but still showing those trademark dance moves), an introverted laundress, takes the opposite stance.<br />  When Council Member Brenda(Casie Silver) gets in the family way,and must take a leave of absence from the show, Tracy skips morning classes (accompanied by Penny)to audition for the opening. Despite her aptitude with the dance moves, Velma rejects her because of her girth and support of desegregation, despite Corny's approval of her views. Tardiness results in her being placed in detention, where she is exposed to new dance moves by Maybelle' son,Seaweed (Elijah Kelly), who, along with other Negro Day dancers, practice their moves in detention hall because those in power have no interest in educating them. A subsequent encounter with Link makes Tracy envision a future with him. In the meantime, her newly-acquired dance moves win her a cherished place on the show when she displays them at a record hop hosted by Corny.<br /> Conflict between Velma and Maybelle aries when Negro Day performers, the Dynamites perform the same song as the white Council members, despite the fact the the Dynamites wrote it. Velma decides to cancel Negro Day.<br /> A plus-sized women's clothing saleman, Mr. Pinky ( Jerry Stiller) offers Tracy a job as his spokesgirl, and Tracy urges her reluctant mother to come out of her shell and be her agent.<br /> The Von Tusselle's become more malicious as Tracy's poularity increases and she provs to be a contender for the title of Miss Teenage Hairspray, and for Link's heart. Amber anonymously reports Tracy's trip to Maybelle's recordshop platter party. When Edna goes to collect her dsughter, the equally hefty Maybelle  inspires Edna to adopt a more positive self-image.<br /> In the meantime, Velma tries to seduce Wilbur as he works in his joke shop, attempting to make Edna angry enough to withdraw Tracy from the show. Edna catches them together and is devastated, but it is soon established that Wilbur did not submit to Velma's advances, and the couple gradually make up. In their song, "You're Timeless to Me", an attentive listener can her starins of "La Vie en Rose" near the end.<br /> In an attempt to reinstate Negro Day, Maybelle, Seaweed, and the other black dancers, decide to march of the station, and at great risk, Tracy joins them. The high solemnity of this scene is encapsulated in Maybelle's soulful ballad, "I Know Where I've Been" , whose lyrics, "There's a road we've been traveling . Lost so many on the way. But the riches will be plenty--worth the price we had to pay.." have a certain power and profundity deeply felt in 2009.<br />  A confrontation with a police blockade results in the arrests of the demonstrators, and Tracy's flight to Penny's house. Prudy punishes Penny for hiding Tracy in their fall-out shelter. But Seaweed and his friends, bailed out by Wilbur, help the girl's escape  and Seaweed and Penny reveal their mutual feelings for each other.<br /> Link acknowledges his feelings for Tracy at the Turnblad's house.<br /> Once safe, Tracy calls home to establish a plan of action, resulting in a spectacular finale at the Miss Teenage Hairspray Pageant, during which Maybelle's daughter, Inez (Taylor Parks), steals the show.<br /> Paul Dooley plays Mr. Spritzer, the owner of the Ultra Clutch Hairspray company, who initially denounces Tracy's desegregationist views as Communistic, but find her to be great for capitalism when she boosts his sales.Ricki Lake, the orginal Tracy Turnblad, cameos as a talent agent, Marissa Jaret Winokur, who orginated the role on Broad way sings at the end, proving this film to be fraught with nostaligia in more ways than one.<br /> Viewers will be treated to a musical as brave and triumpahnt as its plump heroine, and a good time should be had by all!</p></br><a href="../users/AJMU8VVFKMZI4.html">AJMU8VVFKMZI4</a><br/><p>I've put off watching this movie because I had caught snippets of the '88 version years ago was never impressed enough to watch the whole thing.  I might do so now to compare.  I found this version fresh and fun and even a little inspiring.  And even though I can respect John Travolta for being a actor's actor-a man who even over 30 years in the biz willing to take some serious risk, I pray that he will now please step away from dresses and high heels.  I easily found him to be the weakest singer of the lot and his makeup more disturbing than anything else.  That was my only gripe.  I love the music and the message.  I also think Michelle Pfeiffer is just stunning and Christopher Walken as funny as always.</p></br><a href="../users/A2JHHYYOOO4DS6.html">A2JHHYYOOO4DS6</a><br/><p>Fun for the entire family.

Her mother (John Travolta) cautions her against auditioning, wanting to spare her daughter the disappointment, but her father (Christopher Walken) encourages her to go for her dream.<br /><br />Tracy does get on the show, and her dancing and sparkling personality make her a big hit, much to the chagrin of the program manager (Michelle Pfeiffer) who wants her own daughter to be the star.<br /><br />When Tracy finds out that the show's "Negro Day" is being canceled, she joins with Motormouth Maybelle (Queen Latifah) to protest segregation.<br /><br />There are some serious issues presented: racism, obesity, and the value of family, but it's overall a feel-good movie. The racists get their comeuppance, overweight Tracy gets the cute boy, and Wilbur and Edna Turnblad are solidly in love.<br /><br />The music is catchy and fun, and nearly irresistible. If I'd been watching it at home, I'd have been dancing.<br /><br />And the humor... when I wasn't dancing in my seat, I was laughing, or at least grinning. My cheeks hurt afterward, I was smiling and laughing so much.</p></br><a href="../users/AZ78HT7H9DVJG.html">AZ78HT7H9DVJG</a><br/><p>*Hairspray* is a fun and energetic musical!<br /><br />Tracy Turnblad is a plump teenager who can sing and dance.  Her dream is to land a coveted spot on "The Corny Collins Show".  With the help of her best friend, Penny, her dad and Seaweed, she does.<br /><br />However, she has to constantly fight and maintain her spot because she does not fit the typical mold of a teenager, figure-wise.  In addition, she's outspoken about segregation between the Whites and Blacks.  The pressure doesn't stop there.  She has to compete with Amber Von Tussle and her mother, the "beauty queens".<br /><br />Once again, wonderful musical surrounding the issues of racism and segregation.  Self-esteem too.  You'll laugh at John Travolta dragging as Tracy's mother.  You'll also be amazed at his performance.  And, if you'll pay attention, you'll catch a cameo appearance of Ricki Lake.<br /><br />If you're a fan of musicals, you'll definitely want to add this to your collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A28OB1QLXN5BM6.html">A28OB1QLXN5BM6</a><br/><p>The movie musical Hairspray is a wild romp that leaves you with a song on your lips, tapping toes on your feet, and a big, HUGE smile in your heart.  I just wanted to sing and dance along throughout the entire film.  (And, to the consternation and mortification of my children, I DID!!!)<br /><br />The cast commits 250% to their roles, and all have a full out good time, which carries right on through to the audience.  Nikki Blonsky, Amanda Bynes, Queen Latifah, John Travolta, Christopher Walken, Michelle Pfeiffer, Brittany Snow, Zac Efron, James Marsden, and Elijah Kelly are all triple threats in this wonderful, feel good film.  The dancing, singing, and acting are all excellent.<br /><br />The heart and soul of this perky film are the simply outstanding production numbers.  The clever choreography is fun and peppy, and the highly enjoyable songs are finger-snapping good (you end up humming them for days).  The pacing is perfect from beginning to end; you are immediately hooked, and they just reel you right in.<br /><br />Overall, this is a happy movie where the girl gets the boy, and everybody sings.  A good, old fashioned musical.  You will be singing and dancing in no time.  What fun!</p></br><a href="../users/A1EOLRV216BXJ9.html">A1EOLRV216BXJ9</a><br/><p>I heard rave reviews, especially about John Travolta, and watched with great anticipation. And by all standards, this is such a hilarious and cheerful musical. Its success owe much to its excellent balance of great dance numbers and everyone has their turn to lead in the spotlight. For the first half, I am captivated by the singing and dancing Tracey, she is so beautiful and so plus size! Then it is her classmates' turn, the vibrant black youths in the detention class, singing even more beautifully and leap so high in the air. When Mrs. Turnblad (John Travolta) showed up with her feminine features, not to mention her adorable and modest demeanor, that's worth zillions of laughs. The scene Mr. and Mrs. Turnblad (Christopher Walken) singing in the backyard can be so romantic. But I love the finale best - the way John Trovolta moves and bends, Queen Lativah sings and the group dancers twirl round and round unbelievably fast.<br /><br />As for the plot - not to discriminate against race, size and look- it may be predictable but the cast is so funny that it's still worth watching again and again. And one big surprise, to someone who can't dance (me), the 2 dance lessons in the bonus features given by the choregraphers are eye-opening. They inspire me with the "camel pull", "chicken" moves. And now I admire those dancers greatly, even more than the main characters. All right, maybe Mrs. Turnblad's final dance is still hard to beat!</p></br><a href="../users/A2MFNDNS1L7D16.html">A2MFNDNS1L7D16</a><br/><p>another high-school musical. Nikki Blonsky as Tracy is new to movies & really shines. But John Travolta steals the whole movie . He is fully in drag as Enda, Tracy's mom. But he can dance & sing for real. Some well known faces such as Michelle Phieffer, Chris Walken & others lend support. The plot? Dross. The dancing is the thing. Very good original rock n' roll style muscic & singing. Great live & pretty good on the larger stage of movies.</p></br></body></html>

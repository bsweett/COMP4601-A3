Simply love this movie, and the 2nd one is just as good if not better!  I definitely recommend both!</p></br><a href="../users/A1C58YXM2A30CY.html">A1C58YXM2A30CY</a><br/><p>Kung Fu Panda was a cute story with some interesting messages told in a back-drop of martial arts mania.<br /><br />The panda is Po, a lazy bear whose father (a duck! -- they never explain that, which is humorous in itself) runs a noodle shop.  Their family has had many generations of noodle shops and he looks forward to the day when Po can take over the family business.<br /><br />But Po has other dreams.  He is the martial arts warrior looked up to by all.  He is the kung fu master who beats all enemies.  But then he wakes up, admires his action figures and goes back to work selling soup.<br /><br />I really liked how the story unfolded, with Po meeting his stars of the kung fu world, working with them and being elated to even see them.  But Tigress, Viper, Crane, Mantis and Monkey are less than thrilled when Po is named the Dragon Warrior.<br /><br />Themes:<br /><br />Pop philosophy make its way into this film as other animated features of this type.  There is the past which is history, tomorrow hasn't happened yet, so all you have is the NOW.  And the NOW is a gift, that's why it's called "present."  Cooool!<br /><br />All fun aside, I did have to admire Po and his not wanting to give up -- he did at first -- and how the master also changed, realizing that Po, being a different kind of fighter needed a different kind of training.  The mixing of kung fu and dumplings was hilarious.<br /><br />Bottom Line:  Great story, detailed animation and wonderful voice actors come together to make this a fun movie to watch and learn from.  Martial arts purists might whine and complain, missing the point of this light bit of entertainment.  Can't wait for the sequel!<br /><br />Other Dreamworks Animated Pix:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HN690O">Kung Fu Panda 2 (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GCUO7A">Monsters vs. Aliens</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000CABEZ">Dreamworks Animation Award-Winning Family Fun Pack (Spirit, The Prince of Egypt, Antz, Chicken Run, The Road to El Dorado)</a></p></br><a href="../users/A370Z6I5GBWU44.html">A370Z6I5GBWU44</a><br/><p>The CGI animation in this film has been beautifully rendered, especially with the action and kung fu scenes. The story itself is also great, with some truly funny dialogue and memorable lines. Even though one shouldn't judge a movie solely on its visuals, it's hard to ignore them in this film since they were so beautifully rendered, especially with the motions of the characters since they move so naturally. Overall it truly is a memorable film, and stands out as a classic storyline and animation-wise.</p></br><a href="../users/A3IKBHODOTYYHM.html">A3IKBHODOTYYHM</a><br/><p>Jack Black stars as Po, a goofy, lovable loser panda who suddenly has destiny call to him to be the "dragon warrior," much to the chagrin of the much more skilled warriors. Black does a solid job of giving personality to Po, making his status as underdog come to life, as he stumbles, and bumbles his way alternately through skills tests and stuffing his face. The master often laments, "There are no accidents", but when you see Po's "skills", you begin to wonder if the master could be wrong.<br /><br />Kung Fu Panda is a great family film. It does have a few minor parts of crude humor, but where it excels is in its entertainment value, personality, and ultimate message about belief in fulfilling your goals or dreams. So often you watch animated films that force the sentimental moments and they come off as a little too forced or cheesy, but Kung Fu seems very genuine in the way it presents life's lessons in not giving up.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GD1G8XXPRYQ8.html">A1GD1G8XXPRYQ8</a><br/><p>I didn't expect myself to fall in love with it. Kung Fu Panda is great. I love characters, story and effects. The only thing I hated is when it ended.</p></br><a href="../users/AGKPTMTR3UX1R.html">AGKPTMTR3UX1R</a><br/><p>This is a film with truly inventive three dimensional animation and a creative storyline that is full of life lessons for young and old. I was told that KUNG FU PANDA was "very Zen," and it is. It's also fun to watch. It's anthropomorphic animal cast is endearing.<br /><br />Po (voiced by Jack Black) is "a big, fat panda" from the Valley of Peace, who works in his Dad's noodle shop as a waiter. His Dad (voiced by James Hong) is a goose whose fondest wish is that his son follow him into the family business. Po's Dad is awaiting the glorious day when he can reveal to Po the secret ingredient in his Secret Ingredient Noodle Soup.<br /><br />Po, for his part, dreams of being a Kung Fu warrior, and idolizes the Furious Five, a group of highly trained warriors taught by Master Shifu, a Red Panda (voiced by Dustin Hoffman). Shifu's own Master, Oogway (voiced by Randall Duk Kim) is a wise old tortoise who warns Shifu that his renegade student Tai Lung (a Snow Leopard voiced by Ian McShane) will be returning to the Valley to exact vengeance against Shifu for having been passed over as the greatest warrior of all time, The Dragon Warrior. Oogway prophesies that the true Dragon Warrior will appear to defeat Tai Lung. Shifu, for his part, has none of the equipoise of Oogway. He is short-tempered and judgemental.<br /><br />The Furious Five represent each of the major styles of Kung Fu. Tigress (voiced by Angelina Jolie) is their leader. She is egotistical. Monkey (Jackie Chan), Mantis (Seth Rogen), Viper (Lucy Liu), and Crane (David Cross) who round out the group, each have small roles.<br /><br />Comes the great day when Oogway is to name the Dragon Warrior, and the designate-presumptive, Tigress, is shocked to discover that Oogway picks the totally untrained, physically clumsy Po as The Dragon Warrior. The rest of the Furious Five are nonplussed. Shifu too, has great doubts about Oogway's choice. The group is rude to Po and mock him at every opportunity until Oogway commands Shifu to train Po. The secret to Po's training is contained in the mysterious Dragon Scroll, which only the Dragon Warrior may have, and which Tai Lung covets.<br /><br />The animated action sequences are complex and realistic, breaking new ground in animation. The film is very visually appealing and captures a sense of a stylized Classical China beautifully. It is the storyline that truly shines, though, as the characters learn not to judge one's skills, talent and abilities---whether ally or  opponent or oneself---by appearances alone.<br /><br />In the same vein as THE KARATE KID, KUNG FU PANDA is a great movie for everybody of any age.</p></br><a href="../users/A2LXG7XUQNZO6E.html">A2LXG7XUQNZO6E</a><br/><p>This is going to be hit or miss for some of you out there because Kung Fu may not be your thing but if it is, you're really going to have a ball watching Kung Fu Panda; it's highly entertaining, the voice actors are all top-notch and the animation is brilliant. As far as animated flicks go, it's gonna put a smile on the faces of both adults and children! I wouldn't say it delivers on non-stop hilarity but its good, clean fun for the entire family and that does seem to be missing in today's cinema these days.<br /><br />Personally I thought the best damn thing about this film was Jack Black. I'm not the biggest fan of his work but he does do comedy well and this was a fantastic role for his style of acting. Dustin Hoffman was also seriously funny as straight-man Kung Fu teacher Shifu. My personal fave though was Seth Rogen as Mantis, he didn't get a ton of lines or screen time but a Kung Fu fan always sides with the Mantis...ALWAYS. All in all, good performances all around, a satisfying conclusion and some super cool extras for the kids to check out.</p></br><a href="../users/AHF97M45JFCB.html">AHF97M45JFCB</a><br/><p>I'll admit that I usually shy away from films that seem to be showered in hype.  I like to march to the beat of my own drum when it comes to discovering an under-appreciated gem and yet still found myself intrigued by the glowing opinions surrounding DreamWorks' Kung Fu Panda.  Sure Jack Black was decent in Shark Tale and Eastern Philosophy would probably naturally lend itself to the notion of martial arts masters who just so happen to be adorable talking animals but come on! It can't be that great, right?  Wrong!<br /><br />Until picking up Kung Fu Panda, I was pretty thoroughly convinced that aside from Shrek, DreamWorks was doomed to play second fiddle to Pixar in the world of computer generated animated feature films.  Kung Fu Panda manages to combine story originality, magnificent visuals and genuine humor so flawlessly that it is much to Pixar's detriment that they have nothing to offer in terms of competition.<br /><br />KFP tells the tale of Po (Jack Black); a panda that works in a noodle restaurant owned by his father Mr. Ping (James Hong), who just so happens to be a goose. Po is a kung fu fanatic with secret dreams of becoming a great master in the discipline despite no prior training and a body style that favors weight and clumsiness.<br /><br />The tortoise Master Oogway (played brilliantly by Randall Duk Kim) has a premonition that the evil snow leopard Tai Lung (Ian McShane), the former student of his own prot&eacute;g&eacute;, Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman), will escape from prison and return to threaten the Valley of Peace.<br /><br />Oogway orders a formal ceremony to choose the Dragon Warrior, a supreme master of kung fu and the one who can defeat the lethal Tai Lung should the premonition come to pass. It is assumed that one of the Furious Five: Tigress (Angelina Jolie), Monkey (Jackie Chan), Mantis (Seth Rogen), Viper (Lucy Liu), and Crane (David Cross) will be chosen for this honor.<br /><br />Po, in attempt to simply spectate the event, finds himself smack dab in the middle of the ceremony. Oogway, surprised by the panda's sudden appearance, designates him the Dragon Warrior and hence Po is immediately in way over his head.<br /><br />It's tough to come up with anything new to add to a film that has already been so thoroughly praised since its inception but that's no excuse for me to refrain from trying.  I was quite dazzled with Kung Fu Panda's solid homages to classic kung fu movies while simultaneously brining an original and attention-worthy story to the table.  Pacing, plot structure, and character development are all top notch through and through and the humor, which is often so natural as to appear nearly unintentional, is the icing on the proverbial cake.<br /><br />It is often suggested that DreamWorks tends to release in quantity what Pixar does in quality but every once in a while a DreamWorks production manages to raise the bar for all of the other studios to attempt to follow.  The stars aligned a decade ago when Shrek was released and it would seem the studio has managed to find that magic once again in Kung Fu Panda.</p></br><a href="../users/A2582KMXLK2P06.html">A2582KMXLK2P06</a><br/><p>Alright guys, it's official- animation delivers the laughs better than *any* other style of comedy.  This includes stand up routines, sitcoms with live studio audiences, or just your uncle Bob telling you a joke during a family visit.  Kung Fu Panda absolutely rules, and the animation is one of the main reasons why.<br /><br />I've actually wanted to watch Kung Fu Panda for quite a while now.  I finally got the chance to watch it this afternoon.  It certainly lived up to all the hype it received a couple years ago.<br /><br />What makes it so enjoyable is the fact that the laughs aren't the only exciting thing about Kung Fu Panda- it's the outrageous and zanny action segments that really elevate this film to a level of untouchable greatness.  We're talking a LOT of animated action here, folks.<br /><br />The storyline is about a panda bear that's severely out of shape but dreams about becoming the ultimate master of kung fu fighting.<br /><br />Eventually he's chosen to be given such a chance, with lots of special attention and guidance from his master (along with other friends).  Unfortunately his laziness constantly prevents him from ever reaching his dream... until a really evil wild cat comes into the equation and pretty much forces the panda bear to stand up and fight.<br /><br />I don't know what's most awesome about Kung Fu Panda- the exciting action and fighting segments, the actual humor and jokes involving all the animated animals communicating with each other, or just the brilliantly executed animation frames themselves.<br /><br />One thing's for sure- you simply MUST watch this movie.  Adults and children alike must watch it.  You'll be laughing hard and heavy, I guarantee it!</p></br><a href="../users/A3OXHLG6DIBRW8.html">A3OXHLG6DIBRW8</a><br/><p>Kung Fu Panda is a very fun animated movie that I enjoy and my kids love. Po (nicely voiced by Jack Black) is an affable but somewhat overweight Panda that dreams of becoming a Kung Fu Master. Sadly, his lot in life seems to be making and selling noodles for his father (he was adopted) and all of the Kung Fu glory reserved for the "Furious Five" (who even have a line of action figures). All of that changes when chance lands him in the roll of the "Dragon Warrior" and his Kung Fu training begins in earnest... just in time to face the powerful escaped villainous snow leopard, Tai Lung (Ian McShane).<br /><br />Like most martial arts movies, there is significant violence but it is mostly of the slapstick cartoon variety. There is a very positive message for kids that comes through loud and clear, don't judge people based on looks and preconceptions.<br /><br />The animation is good and the voice acting is enjoyable with Dustin Hoffman, Angelina Jolie, Jackie Chan, Seth Rogan, David Cross, Lucy Liu and.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH</p></br><a href="../users/AWG2O9C42XW5G.html">AWG2O9C42XW5G</a><br/><p>kung fu panda is awesome. it's funny and actioned pack. this movie is for everyone.</p></br><a href="../users/A356RFKNIG043B.html">A356RFKNIG043B</a><br/><p>Hadn't seen this until we saw it in blu-ray. It sure is gorgeous, and intelligent to boot, easily in the pantheon with the Incredibles, Up, Wall-E, and a few other recent masterpieces of animation.<br /><br />  Jack Black is quite perfect, Hoffman and the rest equally fine, and the script is excellent. I really can't find much to not like about Kung Fu Panda, either for kids or adults. There's enough smart humor for the elders and enough eye candy for any fan of color, composition, and animation in general. The form is used to perfection and it's clear that we are in a golden age of animation right now; the classics are coming fast and furious.<br /><br />It's also a very funny, wry movie, with sweet and snappy moments to spare.<br /><br />This is bound to be one of the dvds that parents use to pacify their kids, for decades to come. If they have to be watching the boob tube instead of reading or doing something truly useful ("Such a nice day and you're watching Kung Fu Panda AGAIN?!"), this is about as good a thing for them to be tv zombies with as can be found.<br /><br />This is in fact a work of art.<br />Not bad for a kids' flick.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1EDCBV2KU8D.html">A3Q1EDCBV2KU8D</a><br/><p>This was a good kids movie, it didn't keep the attention of my 2 year old as much as other movies, but I really enjoyed the story and the humor of the movie.  I do think this movie is worthy of a sequel and may have the following similar to Sherk, so I think it is worthy of another storyline.</p></br><a href="../users/A22RY8N8CNDF3A.html">A22RY8N8CNDF3A</a><br/><p>Perfect well-animated flick for the youngsters.  Great choice to have a laugh, enjoy the great voice cast and well written story of a sweet panda destined for greatness.<br /><br />Set in old China it has beautiful artwork as part of the appeal.  The story is great, flows well and the characters are exquisitely funny and bright.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PNTEDGMOLMOY.html">A2PNTEDGMOLMOY</a><br/><p>"Kung Fu Panda" is one of the more pleasant surprises to come out of the Hollywood animated film machine these days.  While the Pixar movies are virtual locks for greatness, the rest of the genre has become rather tired, with big name stars lining up for movies designed for max box office appeal rather than great storytelling.<br /><br />So the non-Pixar test these days is, are we watching something more akin to "Shrek," or closer to "Shrek the Third"?<br /><br />"KFP" is, thank goodness, right up there with "Shrek" in the pantheon of enjoyable animated films not produced by Pixar.  Jack Black is the perfect choice to play Po, the panda seemingly consigned by fate and fat to sell noodles the rest of his life.  But Po's destiny is to be something else- the Dragon Warrior, who shall bring peace to all.<br /><br />Black's comedic timing is on display as he gets virtually all the great lines in this movie, although Dustin Hoffman does yeoman's work as his kung fu mentor, Master Shifu.  This movie essentially wastes other big names who were cast for no apparent reason, as they lend very little to the story:  Angelina Jolie, Seth Rogan, Lucy Liu, David Cross and Jackie Chan lend their voices to the Furious Five (a collection of kung fu warriors), but none of these fine actors does anything significant.  Ian MacShane plays the villain as only he can, but in large part this is Black's and Hoffman's show.<br /><br />Very family friendly, with more than a few "fat jokes" thrown in (but these are more funny than caustic).  Excellent animation and solid storytelling throughout - this is a very good family film.</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>This was a nice movie with likable characters but, frankly, I didn't find it anything memorable. Yes, it was beautiful artwork but I read where it was the most beautiful animation ever put on screen, and I didn't find it lived up to that.<br /><br />I guess my expectations were sky high, which made it almost impossible to meet. The story could have used more laughs, too. I think that was the main thing that slightly disappointed me: the humor was mild, not laugh-out-loud funny.<br /><br />Having said all that, it was enjoyable and it will put numerous smiles on your face as you watch it. I guess "pleasant," "agreeable," "warm," etc., would be better words to describe the film. It is pretty, too, especially on Blu-Ray. I imagine this looked awesome on IMAX in the theater.<br /><br />Jack Black does a nice job of voicing the main character, "Po," the panda that surprised everyone, including himself, on what he could achieve if he set his mind to it. That's another plus for the film: nice messages.<br /><br />Kids should like this more than adults but grownups will enjoy it, too.</p></br><a href="../users/AFFVUZEGP1FDQ.html">AFFVUZEGP1FDQ</a><br/><p>Kung Fu Panda is entertaining and funny at times. This is a very good family movie about a panda following his dreams. Po helps his father at a noodle restaurant but his dream is to become a Kung Fu Master. He then gets a chance to follow his dreams at the tutorial of Shifu, a Kung Fu Master. The movie is funny and entertaining. A good movie for everyone to watch.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL.html">A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL</a><br/><p>I enter this movie with one question: Was Jack Black born to play the voice of Po, or was he merely groomed to play it? I wouldn't be surprised if the whole movie were centered with him in mind. `Kung Fu Panda' is another Dreamworks' production, one that employs or improves admirable animation tricks--giving the film the vitality of a free-flowing digital puppet show. A visual delight, the film has the innovation of `<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UFIYP8">Surf's Up (Full Screen Special Edition)</a>' combined with the entertainment value of `Ratatouille'. Sent mostly on the fast track, the film has a good ol' witty time matched with artful adventure.<br /><br />Literally and figuratively, Po (Black) dreams of becoming a Kung Fu master. He's a chubby Panda bear who has more passion for eating than making the food at his family's noodle restaurant. As he's humoring his stork father, a crisis develops in the village: A prophecy states Tai Lung (Ian McShane), a dragon more aptly described as a snow leopard with pouncing Kung Fu proficiency will escape Chorgum Prison. The town converges on Jade Square, the center of The Valley of Peace where holy wise tortoise, Master Oogway (Randall Duk Kim), will announce the chosen Dragon Warrior. Clumsily, Po propels himself in the center where Oogway, pointing at Tigress has his finger on the panda instead.<br /><br />All the voices are right on. Jack Black as already mentioned makes all the "That's cool," aphorisms work through his own hapless character. Happily his lines lack the hyperactivity of Po's training or Black's own character past. ("I know you're being all mystical and Kung Fu-ooey," he chortles.) Hardly discernible is Dustin Hoffman, perfectly cast as the quiet curmudgeon master trainer, Shifu (Chief-u). Some of the funniest scenes go along with Po's training. "There is now a level zero!" he proclaims after Po's first session. There's also an acupuncture scene that makes a point of Po's ridiculous novice status. Flanking him are the furious five, including a viper (Lucy Liu), a preying mantis (Seth Rogen), a monkey (Jackie Chan), a crane (David Cross) and a tigress (Angelina Jolie), each bringing a certain perfection to their parts. They're all Shifu's prodigies, and each sport some superhero Kung Fu moves as well as resentful remarks for their new dragon slayer trainee.<br /><br />Adding fortune cookie wisdom to the mix both illuminates and entertains. ("One takes one's destiny on the road to avoid it." and "There's no such thing as an accident." Now I may be all wrong, but I thought Freud said that one.) Everyone from director Jack Stevenson to editor Clare Knight deserve kudos for assembling such a fine feature. Containing a well done script, shaking up the animation formula, and mixing funny with fabulous action scenes, 'Kung Fu Panda' may duke it out with '<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013FSL3E">Wall-E (Widescreen Single-Disc Edition)</a>' in the animation category when it comes to Oscar time.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>This movie was surprisely fun to watch and Paramount Pictures is having a Summer to remember at the box office this year. First it was "Iron Man" then came "Indiana Jones and The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull." Both films were the weekend box office champions in their respective released week. Each one collecting more that $100 millions dollars in their opening weekends. Now the turn is for Kung Fu Panda to match those numbers, which is reachable for this furry, funny and cute big panda.<br /><br />The visual aspect of the movie is golden and the animation is one of Dreamworks' best. An attempt to put to use new technology into the most dramatic scenes, the sound was a big match and that's what this film delivers. It is easy to see the detailed work in cinematography when an ancient Chinese town is well illustrated as well as the Jade Temple and surroundings uncovering memories of the many martial arts Chinese movies for some of the old crowd and for the young exposing them to new lands and frontiers.<br /><br />Jack Black and Dustin Hoffman voices' in this film were just right. Each one giving strong life to their characters, especially Jack Black who provided that special touch that only he can give to his characters. The rest of the cast (Angelina Jolie, Jackie Chan and Lucy Liu ) were ok. The biggest problem is that the script didn't provide supporting characters enough dialogue for these actors to expand their talents. On the other hand, children get to know "the legendary furious five" kung fu masters which as animals use their animal characteristics to fight the evil Tai Lung.<br /><br />This cute, furry and funny film is set to get all audiences crazy about a little more than the Panda dance and that is to "be your own hero". It is just full family entertainment.</p></br><a href="../users/AHABFECTNE15I.html">AHABFECTNE15I</a><br/><p>Version: U.S.A / DreamWorks / Region A, B, C<br />Aspect ratio: 2.35:1<br />MPEG-4 AVC BD-50<br />High Profile 4.1 (Main Video) / High Profile 3.2 (BonusView)<br />Running time: 1:32:09<br />Movie size: 22,27 GB<br />Disc size: 44,29 GB<br />Total bit rate: 32.23 Mbps<br />Average video bit rate: 20.98 Mbps<br />Number of chapters: 23<br /><br />Dolby TrueHD Audio English 3256 kbps 5.1 / 48kHz / 24-bit / 3256kbps (AC3 Core: 5.1 / 48kHz / 640kbps)<br />Dolby Digital Audio French 640 kbps 5.1 / 48kHz / 640kbps<br />Dolby Digital Audio Portuguese 640 kbps 5.1 / 48kHz / 640kbps<br />Dolby Digital Audio Spanish 640 kbps 5.1 / 48kHz / 640kbps<br />Dolby Digital Audio English 192 kbps 2.0 / 48kHz / 192kbps<br />Dolby Digital Plus Audio English 192 kbps 2.0 / 48kHz / 192kbps<br /><br />Subtitles: English / English SDH / French / Portuguese / Spanish<br /><br />#Filmmakers Commentary<br />#The Animators' Corner<br />--Trivia Track<br />--Meet the Cast (HD - 13m:17s)<br />--Pushing the Boundaries (HD - 7m:07s)<br />--Conservation International: Help Save Wild Pandas (HD)<br />#Po's Power Play<br />--Dragon Warrior Training Academy<br />--Dumpling Shuffle<br />--Learn to Draw (HD - 8m:20s, 5m:26s)<br />#The Sounds and Moves of Kung Fu Panda<br />--Sound Design (HD)<br />--"Kung Fu Fighting" Music Video by Cee-Lo (HD)<br />--Learn the Panda Dance (HD)<br />--Do You Kung Fu?

Top-notch animation, a humorous performance that isn't too silly and a great story about finding the Dragon Master from within shine through on the disc-based version of this film (at least it shines very nicely on the Blu-ray disc).<br /><br />As some have noted the Blu-ray package unfortunately doesn't include all of the material of the DVD package, but it doesn't mean those with Blu-ray players shouldn't grab this excellent disc.  The animation comes through extremely well and the level of detail in this Blu-ray rivals that of a disc I would previously have called reference quality (the Disney movie about a rat named Remy ;-)).<br /><br />Don't fear investing in this disc as it's sure to be a treasured addition to your own collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>Animated films rely heavily on the appeal of the actors voicing the various characters. Get a group of them who could care less about the material and you'll get a quick-to-DVD release (see <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006JMLRK">Shark Tale</a>). But get a bunch that really gets into it, and you can capture lightning in a bottle. It's happened before. I consider Finding Nemo and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EQ5UHS">Hoodwinked!</a> to be the prime examples of this type of success. And KUNG FU PANDA now resides in close company with them.<br /><br />Whomever cast Kung Fu Panda deserves some serious recognition. All of the voice characters, without exception, were perfect for their animal type. From Dustin Hoffman's wise Shifu and Angelina Jolies rough Tigress to Jackie Chan (as Monkey), Seth Rogan (as Mantis), Lucy Liu (as Viper) and the unforgettable Jack Black as Po the Kung Fu Panda, every one of them were awesome shining lights of pure ...um ...awesomeness.<br /><br />The story is standard fodder: a nobody Panda (Jack Black) seems destined to follow in his father's footsteps as a shlepper of noodle dishes. But Po (the Panda) has always been infatuated with the Kung Fu masters. And when a call comes down from on-high that a new master is being chosen, Po rushes to the tower to find out who it might be (will it be Tigress? Or Viper? Or one of the others?). Surprisingly it turns out to be the rotund and out-of-shape Po.<br /><br />Training begins and Po is neither liked nor respected by any of the Kung Fu fighters (yes, the song is in there, too, of course). But once Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) learns how to motivate Po, the training begins in earnest.<br /><br />Problems arise, however, when word spreads that an enemy of the Kung Fu lands has escaped his prison and whomever the new Kung Fu Master might be will have to deal with him.<br /><br />The antics and battles are funny and epic. Using his blubbery size, Po often bounces his way to success, or eats his way into the audience's heart (particularly funny is when he finds a stash of cookies in a high cabinet and does a perfect split in order to reach them and gobble `em down).<br /><br />It is a telling story that shows us you don't have to be some foxy 007 type in order to succeed. Using your natural abilities often times allows you all the power you'll need. And Jack Black's sloth-like nature was a perfect fit for Po and those who enjoyed Kung Fu Panda.<br /><br />Skadoosh!</p></br><a href="../users/A2J57EQ9KPGXR9.html">A2J57EQ9KPGXR9</a><br/><p>When I first hears about "Kung-Fu Panda", I groaned - Not another cute little animated movie with inside jokes for adults..<br /><br />But I was presently surprised, this movie presents familiar material in a fresh, fun manner.

One recent exception to my new, stricter rule is Dreamworks' "Kung Fu Panda."  My wife took our daughter to see this at the movies while I stayed at home with our youngest child.  I must admit that I envied my wife when she walked out of the house to see the film, for it had peaked my interest with its commercials and trailers.  When it arrived on DVD, my wife picked it up for the whole family.  She stated that she really enjoyed the film.  This was a good sign for me since my wife isn't into many animated films.<br /><br />From the wonderful opening "dream sequence" to the climactic battle with Tai Lung, "Kung Fu Panda" doesn't disappoint at all.  It's the story of Po (Jack Black), an overweight, clumsy panda who longs to become a great kung fu master like the legendary Furious Five.  Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) has guided the Furious Five for many years and has literally raised them to be great fighting machines.  Only one student fell to the wayside under Shifu, and that was the wicked (and imprisoned) Tai Lung (Ian McShane).  Tai Lung thinks he deserves to be the dragon warrior and therefore the only person wise and powerful enough to learn the secrets of the dragon scroll.<br /><br />When Po is named as the dragon warrior (much to the surprise of Shifu and the Furious Five), Tai Lung escapes his prison in order to claim what he feels is rightfully his.  Shifu and the Five must prepare Po for the greatest battle of his life.  Can they do it?  You'll have to watch this hilarious family flick to find out.<br /><br />Black is great as Po.  He fits into the clumsy, plus-sized role perfectly.  The Furious Five consists of the voice talents of Jackie Chan (Monkey), Lucy Liu (Viper), Seth Rogen (Mantis), David Cross (Crane) and Angelina Jolie (Tigress).  Each of the group is given a nice amount of screen time and they make wonderful straight men to the goofy Po.  McShane and Hoffman are also excellent in their roles.  Listen for more highly recognizable voices in smaller roles in the film as well.<br /><br />What makes "Kung Fu Panda" worthy of five stars is the fact that it manages to be a family friendly film with great comedy, brilliant animation and heart-stopping action sequences.  Honestly, some of the best fight sequences I've ever witnessed are in this film.  My particular favorite is a showdown between the Five and Tai Lung.  There's also the solid lesson of believing in oneself in order to achieve your dreams, no matter how far-fetched they might be.<br /><br />I highly recommend "Kung Fu Panda" to anyone who enjoys a great family film, comedy or action flick.  It covers all of those bases and is well worth multiple viewings.  Once again, I highly recommend this film and suggest you purchase a copy for yourself.</p></br><a href="../users/A1COW0UIB5HA9J.html">A1COW0UIB5HA9J</a><br/><p>In China, a lazy and fat yet lovable Panda named Po (Voiced by Jack Black) is a daydreamer who dreams of being a warrior and joining with the famed Furious Five. Of course it's all pipedreams for him as he works with his unsusual dad (Voiced by James Hong) who serves noodles, but one day as the great masters ChiFu (Voiced by Dustin Hoffman) and Oogway (Voiced by Randull Duk Kim) wants to choose who the Dragon Warrior is but when he accidently gets chosen by Oogway he is believed to be the chosen one to fight against an escaped criminal named TaiLung (Ian Mcshane) who's very powerful and strong. Shifu with the furious five known as Tigress (Angelina Jolie), Viper (Lucy Liu), Monkey (Jackie Chan), Crane (David Cross), and Mantis (Seth Rogen) seem to dislike Po as they don't think he's the true Dragon Warrior but according to Oogway they must train him from clumsy fat-oaf to savior to the village.<br /><br />Very entertaining, hilarious and heartwarming animated martial arts comedy from Dreamworks that is their greatest animated movie since "Shrek 1 & 2" or "Over The Hedge". This is the first time for Dreamworks not to use pop culture references or modern music (except at the end credits) but focuses on straight storytelling with good timed humor and great animation to go with it. I love how the CGI is realistic to go with some imaginative traditional animated dream sequences and ending credits that would remind viewers of "Ninja Scroll" and "Samurai Jack". Han Zimmer's music score is outstanding yet very Asian and the film also uses heart to go along with it including a nice hidden message about what a secret can be.<br /><br />This blu-Ray is mindblowingly awesome with it's brilliant picture and sound quality that will knock your socks off. The extras include two Blu-Ray exclusives like The Animator's Corner with interviews with storyboards and BD-Live fun features, Trivia Track, Featurettes, audio commentary, Kung-Fu Fighting Music Video, How to Use Chopsticks featurette, Food Network Exclusive: Alton Brown at Mr. Ping's Noodle House, Interviews with the cast, Save the Pandas foundation spot, Learn how to Draw Po featurette and a game. I recommended this movie to the whole family, adults and kids alike as this is crowd pleasing entertainment.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>Beautifully animated and rich with meaning, `Kung Fu Panda' is a surefire crowd pleaser and, well, a whole lot of fun.  Pairing crisp imagery with some sublime voice over actors, `Kung Fu Panda' is as entertaining as the trailers would suggest and definitely deserves a spot as one of the best animated films of the year.<br /><br />The film tells the story of Po, a Panda who dreams of one day achieving Kung Fu awesomeness.  The only problem is that he comes from a long line of noodle makers and his father just doesn't understand his desire to fight.  When word comes that the evil kung fu master Tai Lung may escape imprisonment it is time to name the Dragon Warrior, a kung fu master who will receive the dragon scroll and all its endless power.  The ceremony is held and it is believed that one of the furious five (Tigress, Monkey, Mantis, Crane and Viper) will be named the Dragon Warrior, but not all is as it seems and Po is named the warrior.  Kung Fu master Shifu must train Po in order for him to defeat Tai Lung.<br /><br />The storyline is simple enough for children to grasp yet not too dulled down to the point where parents are bored stiff.  The action keeps coming and the hilarity rarely lets up, and the message about believing in oneself is very strong and very enlightening, especially for children.<br /><br />I will give a word of caution, and beings that this is a film targeted towards the young ones I feel that this `warning' is valid and justified.  The film is filled with kung fu violence.  Now yes, I understand that a lot of cartoons have violence within them, and I normally am not one to balk at all, but there is a slight difference (is it really slight?) between stylized comical violence and intentional dark violence.  Tai Lung is an evil soul and the fight scenes between him and the furious five or him and Shifu are quite violent and not comical (his fight with Po is rather funny).  His escape from the prison is rather violent as well.  The point being that, while a film like `The Incredibles' is violent, it is a comical kind of violence (the villain in that film is funny in itself) but the violence here is darker and may not be something you want your children imitating.  Just a word of caution to parents, since being a parent I appreciate those words myself.<br /><br />Anyways, I really like this movie, and I think that most parents and children will too.  Just know your kids first, that's all I say.  It's entertaining and action packed and funny to boot.  Jack Black and Dustin Hoffman make a great team here.</p></br><a href="../users/A3P9D22KDEXVMN.html">A3P9D22KDEXVMN</a><br/><p>I had an opportunity to watch Kung Fu Panda with the family last night.  The movie was very entertaining with several laugh out loud moments.  Po Panda, as voiced by Jack Black, was hilarious with many witty one-liners.  Other voice work actors included Angelina Jolie, Jackie Chan, Seth Rogan, and Dustin Hoffman, excellent as the voice for Kung Fu master Shifu.<br /><br />The film is rated PG as there are numerous scenes involving martial arts combat.  I did not find it too violent for young children over the age of 9 years old.  I am sure it would not be bad for younger as well, but that is each parent's call.<br /><br />The message in the movie was very positive and delivered in a way that was a lot of fun.  This is a movie that the entire family can enjoy, as mine sure did.<br /><br />I give this a strong 4.5 star rating.  Great fun, funny, and with a great message.  Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A2I6MHMAZZDCRX.html">A2I6MHMAZZDCRX</a><br/><p>Our story centers around Po the Panda (voiced by Jack Black).  He is a Kung Fu legend.  Evildoers fear him and the people adore him.  The Fearsome Five long to fight with him.  And everything...hold on, maybe that isn't the way it really is.<br /><br />In reality, Po works in his father's noodle restaurant waiting tables.  He's way overweight and out of shape.  But he dreams about Kung Fu and idolizes the Fearsome Five, Monkey (Jackie Chan), Crane (David Cross), Tigress (Angelina Jolie) Viper (Lucy Liu), and Mantis (Seth Rogen).  That's why, when it is announced that the legendary Dragon Warrior will soon be chosen, Po leaves everything behind and joins the rest of the village high up the mountain.<br /><br />Through a series of events, Po winds up being named the Dragon Warrior, much to the dismay of the Fearsome Five and Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) who must train the rookie.  Po doesn't think he can do it, but he doesn't want to quit.  Shifu and the Five want to make him quit.  But they'd better figure things out soon because an old foe is about to return to the village intent on destroying it.  Can Po save the day?<br /><br />Since I'm not a fan of Jack Black or Dreamworks Animation, I almost skip this flick.  And that would have been a huge mistake.  This is a fun movie for all ages.<br /><br />So let's get the obvious and the only negative out of the way right now, shall we?  We've seen this plot many, many times before.  But the movie does a great job of making the familiar ride enjoyable.<br /><br />Part of that is through the humor.  There are lots of great one liners and slap stick scenes.  It's not side splitting funny, but I laughed plenty of times.  And some of the gags were completely unexpected.  Yet the more serious and tender moments don't feel forced in the slightest.  And the story is fast paced with an ending that made me smile.<br /><br />The first few minutes are hand drawn animation, but the rest of the movie is computer animated.  It looked amazing with plenty of beautiful settings and small details.  They even managed to do a good job with the Kung Fu fight scenes.  Heck, they were easier to follow than fight scenes in many of the live action movies made these days.<br /><br />I always worry when I hear that a movie has a voice cast made up of famous people, but here they did a good job becoming the characters.  I wasn't left picturing the actor recording the voice.  Instead, I bought the characters and got lost in the story.<br /><br />Okay, so this movie isn't highly original.  It's still incredibly fun.  And that's all that matters.  I'm glad I gave the movie a chance.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GKMQFL05Z79K.html">A3GKMQFL05Z79K</a><br/><p>Po is a panda who works at his family's noodle shop with dreams of doing kung-fu alongside The Furious Five(a legendary five that is comprised of Tigress (Angelina Jolie), Crane (David Cross), Praying Mantis (Seth Rogen), Viper (Lucy Liu) and Monkey (Jackie Chan)). Po is afraid to share his desire with his father who wants him to take over the restaurant when he retires. Everything changes one day when Master Oogway (Randall Duk Kim) has a premonition about Tai Lung (Ian McShane), a former prot&eacute;g&eacute; of his who's gone bad. He fears Tai Lung will escape from prison and come back to the region for revenge. In accordance with prophecy, Oogway stages a ceremony to name a Dragon Warrior to defend the kingdom. He is supposed to pick from among the Furious Five, but error leads to his picking Po. It is left up to Shifu, kung fu master, to teach Po what he needs to defeat Tai Lung but will he be able to in time? That's pretty much what this movie is all about.<br /><br />In my honest opinion, Kung Fu Panda is awesome. It's even more entertaining than any recent CGI movie I've seen on DVD recently. Given, the movie is played a little more seriously with laces of humor throughout, it is definitely a movie the whole family will enjoy.<br /><br />Special Features include: Directors' Commentary, "Meet the Cast" (13:00)- The cast recording the audio for the film,  "Pushing the Boundaries" (7:00) - The computer animation and the creation of the characters,  "Sound Design" (4:00) - The creation of the sound for the film,  Music Video of Cee-Lo singing "Kung Fu Fighting",  "Mr. Ping's Noodle House" (4:00) - The Food Network's Alton Brown goes to Mr. Chow's in L.A. to see how they make noodles,  "How to Use Chopsticks" (3:00) - Instructional video,  "Conservation International: Help Save Wild Pandas" (3:00) - Jack Black talking about the importance of saving pandas, "Dragon Warrior Training Academy" - Game played with the remote.<br /><br />All in all, Kung Fu Panda is a movie that the whole family will enjoy watching over and over again.

There are really no surprises in the film, but it is a fun and good hearted story about an out of shape goofy panda with a destiny.  Taking a little bit of story from every Kung Fu picture you might have watched as a kid, the story moves along with plenty of action and the story of rising to the challange/becoming all you can be.  My son enjoyed the movie, and I found it amusing enough that I would buy it when it came out on Blu-Ray.  Watch the end credits to hear Jack Black sing Kung Fu Fighting and see how of the stars voices you figured out during the movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3N6GAJTEOF4MO.html">A3N6GAJTEOF4MO</a><br/><p>Kung Fu Panda is one of those movies that comes along once every couple of years, it gives you a good message without being patronising in the Disney movie type of way. It shows you a positive outlook on life while giving you genuine laughs without shoving slapstick comedy in your face. I would generally consider constructing my reviews on a pros and cons basis but it's difficult to do that with a film that is simply perfect in every way. I will, however, give you a list of my favourite points of the movie and discuss them in a bit more detail.<br /><br />The Cast: Jack Black, Dustin Hoffman, Angelina Jolie, Jacky Chan, Lucy Liu and many more. I don't think you can get a more star studded cast than this and they all deliver their own special brand of humour and great voice acting to the roles. Some characters are less funny than others which with a movie like this is to be expected. Together they all make this movie even more memorable.<br /><br />The Animation: With a fully CGI movie it's going to get put in the same category as films like Shrek and Toy Story for the simple reason that it's a fully computer animated movie. Of course if you're going to make a movie about a panda who wants to learn Kung Fu, CGI is an inevitable way to go in order to bring this story to life. The animation for this movie is incredible, it gives us a slick blend of cartoon animation and detailed surroundings which helps make the movie that bit more realistic.<br /><br />The Comedy: From one of the first opening lines being "He blinded his enemies with his awesomness" you knew this movie would be a high quality comedy. Jack Black as the lead character, Po, makes this movie great as he brings his typical silliness and projects it through his voice and into the character. At times I could genuinely believe Jack Black would be capable of playing the physical role of Po as the slapstick moments are something you can imagine Jack being a part of.<br /><br />The Story: The story itself from the get go you can sort of work out where they're going with it. Po, a clumsy Panda bear works for his father making noodles but he dreams of one day becoming a Kung Fu master. Meanwhile up in the jade palace current Kung Fu master Oogway decides he must choose a Kung Fu warrior to receive the dragon scrolls which are believed to be the key to becoming the greatest Kung Fu warrior in history. Po must see this ceremony and whilst trying to get over the walls of the jade palace he finds himself being chosen as the one to receive the scrolls but first he must be trained by Shifu.<br /><br />Overall it's a really good movie and when finally released on DVD is something that everybody must own.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>When threatened by a gang of snow leopards, the jungle animals call upon an inept panda to become a kung fu master and save the Valley of Peace.

A very entertaining movie for the entire family to watch.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>As voiced by funnyman Jack Black, Po is just your average Chinese panda with dreams of one day becoming a world-class kung fu fighter (isn`t that what all pandas living in China aspire to be?).  When he's chosen by The Master to become the new Dragon Warrior, a position that brings virtually unlimited power to the individual who holds it, Po is thrown into round-the-clock training sessions to help groom him for the role - kind of like Eliza Doolittle on steroids.<br /><br />The plot of "Kung Fu Panda" - with its echoes of "The Karate Kid" and even of "Star Wars" in its portrayal of teacher/pupil relationships - is fairly derivative in nature and lacks the kind of  strong secondary characters we`ve come to expect from computer-animated  films (no slam intended on the voiceover work by Dustin Hoffman, Ian McShane, Angelina Jolie, Lucy Liu, Seth Rogen and Jackie Chan).<br /><br />Still, there is sufficient energy, wit and visual inventiveness in the movie to captivate the little ones while keeping the rest of us from actively storming the box office and demanding our money back.  This is most definitely not one of the "great ones," as animated features go, but it is short and pleasant enough to at least earn it a spot in the recommended column.</p></br><a href="../users/A33PNAQ33DGBJG.html">A33PNAQ33DGBJG</a><br/><p>Personally, I didn't think it was a funny as the trailors made it out to be.

I was a bit disappointed in Dreamworks casting. Most families will enjoy it. The one voice that truly didn't seem to quite fit was Dustin Hoffman's. No offense to him but we needed someone who could have called Jack Black's panda, grasshopper. David Carradine would have been good in that role. Some may find Hoffman's high pitched complaints funny, it just didn't strike me that way. It is a fairly entertaining movie for the family. Good quality DVD with decent replayablity.

Suddenly people in China were asking, how can an American production company outdo their Chinese counterparts in creating an animated film that sends such a positive message about China and gets everything right? It's akin to the Russians who launched the first man into space, only to see the American overtake them, eventually landing a man on the moon. For many Chinese critics, Kung Fu Panda is the American 'first lunar landing' of animated martial arts movies.<br /><br />But if the Chinese critics only had a bit of critical acumen, they could easily see there's nothing to be jealous about here. Sure there's a great amount of respect for Chinese culture seen throughout the film (down to the last Chinese character in the credits) as well as some sensational animation including the opening anime 'dream' sequence as well as that incredibly difficult feat of having tons of realistic looking confetti pour down at the Kung Fu tournament where the Kung Fu Panda, Po, is crowned Dragon Warrior. But how is Chinese culture honored by turning Chinese people into a bunch of goofy, self-effacing anthropomorphic animals? Surely kids under eight will dig it, but adults? I hardly think so.<br /><br />While the directors of 'Panda' are firmly ensconced in the world of martial arts and action adventure films, they are neophytes when it comes to comedy. It all comes down to one silly slapstick scene after another emphasizing Po as a good natured, bumbling fool with a decided inferiority complex. Whether he fails getting up the steps into the arena for the Kung Fu tournament, or shoots himself high into the air strapped to a bunch of fireworks and then unceremoniously falling straight down and landing inside the arena, only to be crowned Dragon Warrior, the idea that we should fall in love with his lovable loser is spelled out from the beginning and repeated ad infinitum. How many times do we have to see Po chucked around like an inflatable doll whether it's by Master Shifu, Villain Tai Lung or when he finds himself caught inside the mechanical torture chamber, a device that Shifu's Dragon Warrior candidates, 'The Furious Five', in contrast, have mastered.<br /><br />I do confess that Master Shifu's 'epiphany' in realizing that he has to train Po in a different way so that he can succeed as the dragon warrior, might have been the most clever moment in the comic arc of the film. And certainly Po's transformation from self-effacing masochist to gleeful aggressor as he embraces his 'appetite', is a welcome plot twist after being subjected to the one joke idea of Po as a bumbling clown. Yes, there's finally a method to Po's madness, as Tai Lung is unable to harness Po's new found manic energy. It's sort of like a dominant major league batter unable to master the completely unpredictable path of a knuckle ball.<br /><br />But if we view Po as representing a grownup who still acts like a kid with the particularly bad habit of overeating, then the message 'be yourself', should fall on deaf ears. In this day where smart educators are trying to control the epidemic of childhood obesity, Po's unbridled enthusiasm for that extra cupcake, would not lead to his triumph as dragon warrior. It's a wishful conceit on the part of the directors that Po would end up victorious in his confrontation with the evil Tai Lung. The filmmakers' message to kids here is be happy even if you don't treat yourself well. And things will turn out alright even if you've made no effort to change yourself.<br /><br />As for the action adventure aspect of 'Panda', I can't help it if it seems that the 'holy trinity' of Shifu, Oogway and Tai Lung, are pilfered straight out of the Star Wars play book. Shifu appears to be a Yoda stand-in with the wise, all-knowing tortoise Oogway, reprising the Obi-Wan Kenobi role (Oogway appears to employ his own version of 'The Force' as he is responsible for turning the slight Red Panda Master Shifu into a powerhouse). Finally, Tai Lung can go toe to toe with Darth Vadar any day as both have no problems mixing erudition with brute force.<br /><br />A good deal of 'Panda' is taken up by one Kung Fu sequence after another and you really have to be a martial arts fan to be enamored with all those repetitious action sequences. Less bothersome (but still silly) was the decision to make Po's father, Mr. Ping, a goose. There's also the Wuxi Finger Hold that leads to Tai Lung's destruction (at first it seems like a nuclear explosion but it really is a clearing out of 'bad energy' or 'bad karma'). Finally, The 'Furious Five' are not distinct enough as characters despite the conscription of such luminaries as Angelina Jolie and Jackie Chan to perform the voice overs.<br /><br />I think 'Kung Fu Panda' would have been a better film had the films' scenarists decided from the outset not to make Po into such a hapless buffoon. That would have also probably meant that the sentimental Mr. Ping and his love for noodles had to go too. In its present incarnation, Kung Fu Panda is certainly suitable for kids (although Tai Lung's antics might be too strong a draught for children under eight). As for adults, ignore the dopey screenplay and concentrate on the visuals and the music, which certainly deserve the accolades already garnered throughout the film community since the film's release in 2008.</p></br><a href="../users/A2OCJNB6B46OKP.html">A2OCJNB6B46OKP</a><br/><p>The cgi film genre has really gone above and beyond anything we have come to expect. Since the release of the classic Toy Story in 1995, the computer animated film has been taken up by all the major studios and even introduces digital 3-D technology. Still, with this breakthrough art film taboo at this point I feel that now business is taking over and it's up to the cooporate people to just get the movie to the big screen so people can spend their money just because it looks cool.<br /><br />That brings me to Kung Fu Panda. Now, I unfortunatly missed this movie in its theatrical release, but I had heard good things about the film and that it was even up for the Oscar. I saw it and wondered what the academy was smoking and why they weren't willing to share. Did I seriously miss something with this movie? First of all the movie was not funny. I don't about the movie going masses, but Jack Black needed to try and learn how to diversify is acting. I really thought that after his role in King Kong he would have gone on to do some great work. Instead we him doing the exact same thing in every movie he makes. My other problem was the cast. You would have guessed that Jackie Chan was in this movie? Maybe if they would have given him or any of the other supporting members of the Furious Five more than 2 lines you would have?<br /><br />Personally I don't even want to keep talking about this disgrace of a film. Besides the maginificent work on putting together the fight scenes this movie was pretty horrible. I once thought that Disney had finally gotten knocked off the pedistil as the number one maker of animated films. Nowadays I realize I may be wrong. You have to see who wants to bring a good film to the masses and who just wants to make the big bucks. It really is a numbers game when it comes down to it.<br />First Pixar Toy Story 1995 First DreamWorks Antz 1997<br />Pixar: 10 soon to be 11 with Toy Story 3  Dreamworks: 15 Soon to be 17 with How To Train Your Dragon and Oobermind<br />How many won oscars? so far it's Disney 4 and Dreamworks 2<br /><br />I guess Disney still has the magic and for the record Up was amazing!</p></br><a href="../users/A293HA28PN3VO4.html">A293HA28PN3VO4</a><br/><p>Awesome picture and audio quality. The central character rose a bit quickly from zero to hero, but you can't deny the appeal of the detail in the animation and the funny one liners. Loved Mantis-one of my favorite characters! The actors and voices were distinct; the characters seemed to stand on their own, unlike some of the other animated films, where it almost seems like the characters are cartoon versions of the actors. Very cool fight scenes and important message that appeals to parents and kids-strength of character is more important than some "secret ingredient"-a person directs his/her own course. Thoroughly enjoyed this film!</p></br><a href="../users/A3PCTD8QM1BIXI.html">A3PCTD8QM1BIXI</a><br/><p>Not since The Simpson's Movie, have I enjoyed an animated movie as much as Kung Fu Panda. Jack Black was the perfect choice to voice PO a loveable Panda who longs to be a Kung Fu Panda. The rest of the voice cast including Ian McShane as the bad guy and Dustin Hoffman as the wise sensei are both in top form. The film plays it smart by having the most dialogue come from Black and Hoffman as it's their movie and for a PG rated film the action sequences were quite impressive. All in all a great film that I can't wait to own on DVD and watch with my own son bring on the sequel!</p></br><a href="../users/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD.html">A3PPXVR5J6U2JD</a><br/><p>I was on a long flight back from California when I had the choice between watching Kung Fu Panda on a tiny television screen four feet away from me, or read the SkyMall catalog.  I wisely chose to watch Kung Fu Panda.<br /><br />I was curious as to how Kung Fu Panda would present itself: as a Lion King-style retelling of ancient Chinese myth, or as a love note to kung fu films from an American perspective.  I'm pleased to report that it's the latter.<br /><br />You know the story: Po (a restrained Jack Black) adores the Furious Five but is too fat and slow to ever hope to become one of them and then fate does precisely that. It's the heroes who have the real problem (each representing a different kung fu style and all voiced by a roster of celebrities, including Angelina Jolie, Jackie Chan, and Lucy Liu). Struggling most of all is Master Shifu - a bit redundant, if you know the definition of Shifu - played by Dustin Hoffman (wouldja believe?) who is still suffering from the betrayal of his first and best pupil Tai Lung (Ian McShane).<br /><br />What's surprising about Kung Fu Panda is how adult the story is.  The word "kill" is mentioned several times.  Tai Lung and Shifu have a physical conflict that is much a battle of philosophies as it is a father and son having an argument.  And the plot is beautiful in its symmetry, perfectly tying in every element: from the modified style of kung-food training that Shifu teaches Po to the revelation of Po's (we can only assume adopted) duck-father's secret recipe to the fact that Po is immune to acupuncture (because he's so fat, of course) Kung Fu Panda is tightly scripted and wrapped up in a beautiful package.<br /><br />The movie itself (what I could see on the tiny airplane screen) is beautifully produced.  It ranges from Chinese-style art to realistic but soft-colored tones, to bursts of color amidst pitch darkness.  The fight scenes are all in exciting locations: in a prison, on a rope bridge, in an ancient temple.  It's like a videogame, only you're watching the fat guy character nobody wants to play. It was beautiful enough that I had a pang of regret that I wasn't watching it on a big screen. Or even a medium screen.<br /><br />For kids, Po is a great tale about overcoming obstacles by being yourself.  For geeks, Po is a hilarious new hero archetype: the fanboy as hero, a fat, slobbering devotee who knows more details about the Furious Five than they know about themselves.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R8PXSFGY9MC2.html">A3R8PXSFGY9MC2</a><br/><p>'Kung Fun Panda' is your basic fun, family computer animated movie. It has lots of silly jokes, cute characters and a simple, yet humorous storyline. It follows Po the panda as he gets trained to be the dragon warrior and how he is treated by the other kung fun pupils. There is a high 'star' voice-over list for this film, including Jack Black, Dustin Hoffman, Angelina Jolie and Jackie Chan and they all do a great job bringing life to their various characters. It seems strange to ask Jackie Chan to do a voice over as he is a very physical actor and was barely used in this film, but it lends the film some martial arts kudos I guess. This is a good film for kids and is fun enough to keep parents interested as well. At just under 90 minutes it's not too long so kids will lose their attention or parents will get bored. It does what it sets out to do well, be a fun animated adventure, but there are better animated films out there and this has a great deal to live up to (hence the 3 stars). Worth a look, but not one to rush out to buy the first time you hear of it.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></br><a href="../users/AUM3YMZ0YRJE0.html">AUM3YMZ0YRJE0</a><br/><p>This is a kids' film, with rather grotesque vaudeville antics, cheesy life lessons, and an impossible plot.  Nonetheless, there is absolutely no question that this works.  From the first image of the buffoon Panda, I knew intuitively that I would enjoy this film in the way that a child's mind can:  suspending my disbelief and surrendering myself to the experience, no matter how ridiculous.<br /><br />Even though it checks all of the boxes:  ancient riddle wisdom, action acrobatics that are as mesmerizing as they are impossible, a deadly adversary that only the best can face, the destiny of dreams, and a training program for novices that transforms their lives both inside and outside.  Of course, there is the plucky neophyte, a most unlikely choice to join the greatest of warriors.  What's more, the established cadre does not want to accept the master's choice of the Panda, taking on a mission to reject and undermine him physically and psychologically.<br /><br />The uberbad guy escapes and comes to claim his mantle as master.  Meanwhile, the Panda takes his training in spite of the challenges, proving his character for the coming battle.  The process is fun to watch and you believe it.  The buildup in tension is good and there is plenty of comic relief, even in decisive battles.<br /><br />Warmly recommended.  This is great family entertainment.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>So who would win in a fight? Kung Fu Panda (Po) or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EOQWFI">Wall-E</a>? Which movie is better? Let's break it down in pro boxing's real world 8-point-must system.<br /><br />The fight for the better movie (6 Rounds):<br /><br />Wall-E story: 10<br />Kung Fu Panda story: 9<br /><br />Wall-E voice acting talent: 8<br />Kung Fu Panda voice acting talent: 10<br /><br />Wall-E action: 9<br />Kung Fu Panda action: 10<br /><br />Wall-E family fun factor: 9<br />Kung Fu Panda family fun factor: 10<br /><br />Wall-E "I wanna see it again" factor: 9<br />Kung Fu Panda "I wanna see it again" factor: 10<br /><br />Wall-E DVD extras: 9<br />Kung Fu Panda DVD extras: 10<br /><br />Unanimous decision: Wall-E 54  Kung Fu Panda 59<br />Better Movie: Kung Fu Panda<br /><br />Now if Wall-E and Po had to fight for the title, it would probably go something like this:<br /><br />Po comes right out swinging and kicking. Wall-E immediately looks broken. Po belly-slams Wall-E and one of Wall-E's eye-lenses pops loose. Po closes in on Wall-E for the Wuxi Finger Hold, but before Po can say "skadoosh", Wall-E activates his welding laser and makes Panda steaks out of Po.<br /><br />Winner by KO: Wall-E<br /><br />Both movies are worth your time. Check 'em out.</p></br><a href="../users/A3W1JJGJHRPH4Y.html">A3W1JJGJHRPH4Y</a><br/><p>A friend of mine who grew up in China strongly recommended this movie to me. He knew my fondness for martial arts movies, especially kung fu movies. He said they got a lot of things right. The villian even had a decidedly Japanese name. I was busy at the time, but stored the name away for a potential rental on a subzero day in the upcoming winter. I watched it last night. The movie was very good.<br /><br />Jack Black as the Panda was excellant. Hoffman as the master was very good. The animation was good enough. The starting dream sequence imitated the "Samurai Jack" style of animation and was hilarious. The humor drove the movie. I'm not a philosopher, but the lessons of the movie were basically the westernized, simplified Zen teachings you get now days. It is basically the same lesson as the "The Last Dragon," but this movie is far better. The fight scenes using animals were creative. The villian was evil and scary.<br /><br />What made me appreciate the movie is that it made my wife laugh. She never understood my predilection for martial art movies and approached this movie with a little trepidation, but she was laughing throughout. In other words, this is a very funny movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>Kung Fu Panda (Mark Osborne and John Stevenson, 2008)<br /><br />I've put off writing my Kung Fu Panda review for so long that the DVD is now out. Oops. I did originally see it in the theaters, and I liked it a great deal more than I thought I was going to, given the voice talent in it, but I never quite liked it as much as everyone else seemed to. And thus I've been trying to write this review on and off since I was wishing for the kinds of temperatures we have now. (Stupid me, I never learn. I'm pining for ninety-degree days again.)<br /><br />Osborne (until now best known for his Weird Al Yankovic video "Jurassic Park") and Stevenson (responsible for the fine, and all too short-lived, TV show Father of the Pride) give us the tale of Po (Jack Black), a somewhat lazy panda whose sole desire is to be a martial artist like his heroes, the Furious Five. Instead, however, he spends his time working at the noodle house owned by his adoptive father, Mr. Ping (James Hong). When the Furious Five's temple has an open house, the whole town turns out, and Mr. Ping sends Po to sell noodles at the gathering. Through a series of misadventures, Po finds himself tasked with becoming a Kung Fu master. Meanwhile, the evil warlord Tai Lung (Ian McShane) has escaped from captivity--can Po be the one to stop him?<br /><br />It's a fun movie, entertaining for both kids and adults alike. The main reason it surprises me that I think so is because so much of the voice talent is provided by people who either can't act (Black. Angelina Jolie and Seth Rogen voicing two of the Furious Five) or who aren't actors at all (Osborne and Stevenson both chime in, as well as production supervisor Jeremy Shipp, producer Melissa Cobb, and a handful of others who usually work behind the scenes). And yet it all came out very well. Is it, as I've seen it called, the best animated feature since the Lion King? No, I don't think so--all of the movies Pixar made during its reign as the best studio on the planet have fallen in between these--but it's certainly worth viewing if you haven't seen it yet. The humor is decidedly adult (in that it's not "playing down" to the tween/teen set with potty humor and jokes that will make parents groan), the story is inspiring, and the animation is exceptionally well-done. It may not go down in history as one of the best movies ever, but it's well worth a rental now that the DVD is out, and if you get a chance to catch it on the big screen and you never did, it's worth a look. *** ?</p></br><a href="../users/A3KJ6JAZPH382D.html">A3KJ6JAZPH382D</a><br/><p>"Kung Fu Panda" has a pretty good kick. You're given the standard boiler-plate unlikely hero makes good plot, with Jack Black as Po the Panda and Dustin Hoffman as his not-so-willing coach, Master Shifu. The "Furious Five" are all super-jocks that think this oafish bear doesn't belong in their rarefied air, but Po eventually wins them over with pluck, wit and courage. The evil villain Tai Lung (voiced superbly by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FA1OTU">Deadwood's Ian MacShane</a>) comes back to get revenge on past indiscretions; can Po save his beloved valley and prove that he was correctly chosen the Dragon Warrior?<br /><br />That's the plot in a nutshell, and if you think you've seen this a million times before, you're right. Both live action (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0800177258">A League of Their Own</a>) and animation (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UVKGQC">The Shrek Trilogy</a>) have covered this ground, and "Kung Fu Panda" walks the same turf like it was rice-paper. What sets it apart are the clever nods to old-school Kung-Fu flicks (along with having Jackie Chan add his voice skills) and its ability to resist over-indulgence in easy humor. Only once or twice does the film resort to butt or burp/fart jokes.<br /><br />That helps hold the film's IQ higher than much of "Family Film" content, so I feel safe bumping "Kung Fu Panda" to a fourth star. The dialog is also clever and snappy, which leaves Jack Black plenty of room to riff and vocally mug. (Something the clumsy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JNQS">Robots</a> couldn't overcome, even with Robin Williams leading the voice cast.) The animation is super, giving each character his or her own special trait; I especially loved the burning eyes of Tigress. The battle scenes were exciting, too. With such a positive message in the midst of it all, "Kung Fu Panda" was second only to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013FSL3E">Wall-E</a> as the summer's best animated movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R1HAXRNU0QX7.html">A2R1HAXRNU0QX7</a><br/><p>KUNG FU PANDA is a perfectly acceptable entry in the ever growing list of CGI animated films. Yet, because the list is not yet long enough to stretch back more than one generation, it is inevitable that the film be compared to TOY STORY I & II, INCREDIBLES, SHREK, ICE AGE, MONSTERS INC, FINDING NEMO, ROBOTS, etc. etc. This may not be entirely fair (it's not like we compare a film like UNFORGIVEN to every western ever made)...but it's true nonetheless. Upon leaving the theatre, my first thoughts were, "well, it's better than SHARK'S TALE and ROBOTS and ICE AGE II...but isn't up there with RATATOUILLE and SHREK either." I should be judging it on its own terms. So I'll try to do that.<br /><br />This is a fairly standard "sports underdog" movie in many ways. The hapless Panda, voiced by Jack Black, is clumsy, overweight and hardly built to excel in Kung Fu, a sport / art form which he knows inside-out (as a mega-fan would). Yet, when a serious threat to his town is unleashed, a wise old turtle comes to believe that this Panda may be "the dragon warrior" of legend, the "one" who can save them all.<br /><br />Panda thinks this idea is pretty ridiculous, BUT it gives him a chance to hang out with some of his heroes, true Kung-Fu artists such as Tiger (Angelina Jolie), Monkey (Jackie Chan), Cricket, Snake, etc. He relishes being with them, and even blows off most of their insults and mockery.<br /><br />But his "master" (Dustin Hoffman, doing a really nice job here) is compelled to train Panda, even though he thinks it is a waste of time. What do YOU think? Will Panda find new talents in himself that he never suspected he had? Will he earn the respect of his heroes? Will he save the town?<br /><br />I won't answer these questions here...but suffice it to say that you know the answers to these questions before the movie even starts. This is a film where the journey to the answers is the key.<br /><br />The journey is amusing enough. The Chinese village is rendered lovingly, hinting at the feeling of watercolor painting, yet staying true to the almost 3D style of the best CGI films. There is no question the movie looks great. Within these settings, the journey unfolds with funny scenes showing the clumsy Panda attempting Kung Fu. Yes, there's even a training montage.<br /><br />In fact, the plot is so predictable that the film would be thoroughly tedious were it not for the relationship between master and student. Black's Panda is a nice creation...he's funny & smart, and while he feels overmatched physically, he doesn't actually seem to think there's anything wrong with that. He gets down on himself at times...but is remarkably resilient. Essentially, even if his self-confidence is low (he knows he is not likely to be a pure Kung Fu genius) his self-ESTEEM is always high. Hoffman's master is a bundle of energy and aggravation, and makes a nice foil.<br /><br />I was disappointed that the other characters were so minor. While I don't watch movies like this for the actors behind the voices, I had expected the Kung Fu heroes to be more a part of things, and to add more dynamics. In fact, they were pretty minor.<br /><br />The climactic scenes were not as exciting as I would have liked, either. So in the end, the film was a mixture of amusing and creative bits, covered by a layer of predictability. KUNG FU PANDA, no matter how great it looked, could not throw off the unoriginality of story.<br /><br />I believe kids will like it, and I wasn't exactly bored myself. But whereas TOY STORY and MONSTERS INC have warranted repeat viewings over the years, KUNG FU PANDA will probably NOT earn a space on my movie shelf.</p></br><a href="../users/A387BD735MI50R.html">A387BD735MI50R</a><br/><p>This is a visually striking animated film. It is beautifully colored, beautifully drawn, and has an appealing enough schnook of a hero.<br /><br />However we hardly get to know many of the key characters, such as the members of the "Furious Five." Most of them are given only a few lines to establish their personalities. The similarity between two of the opposing characters might also create some confusion among young viewers. There's Tigress, one of the heroic Furious Five. Then there's Tai Lung, also a fierce-looking feline - who is the arch villain impressively voiced by Ian McShane. A youngster (or an adult) could initially confuse the two.<br /><br />Then where we might expect some family resemblance, there is none. The Panda's father is inexplicably - a goose. In the Director's Commentary, John Stevenson says that this anomaly is gleefully accepted by children. Well, maybe...<br /><br />However, the script seems to me to be too random in too many places. Elements needed to further the plot or to bring resolution are often plucked out of the air. I expected the heroes' fighting techniques to ultimately relate somehow to their unique backgrounds and skills. For example, I kept expecting the Panda to execute some winning maneuver culled from his background balancing hot dishes of noodles, serving noodles every day in his father's noodle shop. But that never happens. Whatever fighting techniques the Panda or any of the others employ are strictly ad hoc. They don't relate to anything the characters bring to the combat or to anything they might have learned in their kung fu training with the Master.<br /><br />This is in contrast with the scripting of another recent acclaimed action animation film, "The Incredibles." In fighting their adversaries, the ploys used by the Incredibles arise organically from who they are, from powers that were initially established for them and that they honed or remembered in the course of the action.<br /><br />So younger children might be happy with the general look and appeal of "Kung Fu Panda." But for somewhat older children who demand a more coherent storyline, more consistent characterization, and some imparted wisdoms that they can actually apply in winning their battles in life, I suggest a film such as "The Incredibles."</p></br><a href="../users/A3JLOIXFM75QNV.html">A3JLOIXFM75QNV</a><br/><p>Kung Fu Panda is a beautifully drawn movie that should appeal to a broad audience, but more so for younger children. While I enjoyed it, I think it's far too predictable and not as in-depth as other works by Dreamworks or Pixar. The plot is very simple and it doesn't pretend to be otherwise and kids will really get a kick out of the humour. I found myself laughing once or twice.<br /><br />The voice cast is really great especially Dustin Hoffman and Jack Black. Again, the animation is brilliant and certainly some of the finest I've seen in a long while. All in all, a simple but fun movie that the whole family will enjoy.</p></br><a href="../users/AUTBHG6070SL4.html">AUTBHG6070SL4</a><br/><p>I'm just this guy, y'know? I yam what I yam, and no one to date thought very much of it. Maybe the opposite, if you focus on a wedgied eighth grade. But I'd give anything to be this way-awesome master of way-awesome beatdown skills (on all those guys who beat me down, at least), as long as it isn't too hard. Heck, I'd take a fair beating too - not like I haven't done it before - as long as the cool guys let me hang with them.<br /><br />If you're still with me, then KFP is your ultimate fantasy. The golden goal is to find that unique power that each of us has within. Yeah, and everybody wins the race and gets a hug at the end. But maybe, just maybe, that one thing about you really can stand tall in some squirrely place in the world. Then, you are Po. Po Panda.<br /><br />Perhaps there's a reference here to Li Po, the classic drunken poet - perhaps not. I really don't care. It's just a fun flick with lots of satire on the traditional "work hard forever" themes that don't work so well in the current decade. Po is the guy you really want to like, even if he's ... well, y'know, not so hard-working.<br /><br />The animation matches the best of today's, and voice casting backs up the animated characters as well as any. My one kvetch, and little, is that Angelina Jolie's voice was way too smooth for Master Tigress. My ears just kept looking for a rocky rasp that her honeyed soprano never delivered. My problem, not yours, not hers.<br /><br />As long as you don't take the martial arts too seriously, this is a charming and humorous riff on taking them seriously. See it and laugh at it. If you can be polite about all the rest, it's warm fuzzy fun.<br /><br />-- wiredweird</p></br><a href="../users/A2TLLX0ZBMZTK7.html">A2TLLX0ZBMZTK7</a><br/><p>I'm honestly not one who enjoys many films like this, but Kung Fu Panda...

And, those characters are also great! It has that perfect blend of action and humor, however that action still seems kid-friendly in some way.

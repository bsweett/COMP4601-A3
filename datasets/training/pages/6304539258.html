One of the most viewed reviews (by Kory) explains the difference between regular widescreen and anamorphic widescreen and how annoying is to watch the 1977 film with black bars surrounding the whole picture (top, bottom, left and right).<br /><br />Could Lucasfilm have released something better than this? Definitely. This limited edition of the star wars trilogy is the same from 2004, the difference now is that one of the "bonus materials" (what is that supposed to mean?) is the original release, no digital Jabba, Han shooting first, Ewoks singing at the end of `Jedi' and the original phantom of Anakin Skywalker. It took only 2 years for this release after Lucas stated he would not be releasing the original versions. Now he releases this and says he will not remaster them, which can only mean we have to wait another couple years to have the original versions remastered.<br /><br />I agree with those that believe Lucas disrespected his original films, for a company that is the one to set the quality standard in movie releases (ILM and THX) this is a poorly done job, Dolby 2.0 surround, not remastered and non anamorphic! They did a superb job remastering the special editions, try watching the special edition and then compare it to this DVD release, the difference is abysmal, I tried to watch this in my widescreen TV and had to use the zoom feature as it is not enhanced for anamorphic widescreen which only made the quality of the image look worse.<br /><br />Why did I purchase these then? Well, I, like many fans, still kept VHS copies of the original trilogy before the special edition, the VHS image was not anamorphic, not remastered and the format is almost extinct. I see this release as a digital version of those VHS films, I believe this DVD will last longer than my old VHS copies and plus, I got them at the price of $9.99 each (and can be found cheaper) I can finally get rid of the old VHS and keep these digital versions of the original films.<br /><br />It is rumored that a complete collection is to be released later this year commemorating the 30th anniversary, it will probably have the original editions remastered, however, I do not intend to purchase that, enough is enough, I had always waited to see a DVD release of the original trilogy, well, it may not be the best but it is finally here. Over the years I've learned that Lucas will always have `never before seen' additional material to include in every single new release he plans. I have the special edition (remastered as it is) and these limited original versions copied from the laser disc release.<br /><br />I decided to buy it and stop complaining, finally, this is the last Star Wars trilogy I am buying!</p></br><a href="../users/A3IDMLOWLHWNDJ.html">A3IDMLOWLHWNDJ</a><br/><p>"I want to learn the ways of "The Force" & become a Jedi, like my father."<br /><br />"The circle is now complete.

"Star Wars" gave the dying sci-fi genre a much needed jolt in the arm, in the late 70's & has generated millions of fans the world over. The film, after all these years, still remains one of the highest grossing films in history (currently at 450+ million dollars).<br /><br />Taking place roughly twenty years after "Episode III: Revenge Of The Sith", "Star Wars" (renamed "Epiosde IV: A New Hope" in 1999, after the release of the first prequel film) has the galaxy under the grip of the tyrannical Galactic Empire (the former Republic from the prequel films).<br /><br />The Empire's ultimate weapon, The Death Star (shown in a skelatal structure at the end of "Sith") has come to fruition & spells certain doom for the small band of rebels trying to restore freedom to the galaxy.<br /><br />Princess Leia, senator of the planet Alderaan, races home aboard her starship after stealing schematic plans to the battle station. Imperial forces, led by Darth Vader, intercept the ship, take Leia hostage, & destroy the ship, but, not before the Princess records a short message to Genaral Obi-Wan Kenobi & downloads the message with the valuable, stolen Death Star plans into a nearby astromech droid. As fate would have it, Artoo-Detoo is the recipient & with his companion See-Threepio use an escape pod to get off the ship blasting to the planet of Tatooine below.<br /><br />Once on the surface, & through some unusual circumstances, the droids fall into the hands of Owen Lars, & his step-nephew, Luke Skywalker. While cleaning up the two droids, Luke accidently stumbles across the ending of the message Artoo was trying to  keep hidden ("Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. Your my only hope").<br /><br />Luke tells his Uncle about the message & in response wants both droids memory's erased (it must have dawned on Owen that both droids have been here before & he knows the history surrounding them). Luke also asks if he can join the Academy (most of his friends have already gone), but, his Uncle also nixes that idea (as Luke leaves the dinner table, in a huff, Owens wife, Beru, tells him that Luke has to much of his father's spirit in him. Owen's reply, "That's what I'm afraid of.").<br /><br />But, Artoo has other plans. Insistent on delivering the message to Obi-Wan, Artoo ditches Threepio, while Luke & his family are at dinner, & goes searching for the Jedi Knight himself. Upon this discovery, Luke sets out early the following morning, with Threepio, & unknowingly sets his destiny to become a Jedi Knight into motion.<br /><br />"Star Wars" is the first film to be released, but, is Episode IV, chronilogically in the overall saga. Thanks to the monsterous success of this film, the rest of the saga was a go. "Star Wars" was first created as a stand alone film (in case it flopped at the box-office). With its first re-release, the film then had the "Episode IV, A New Hope" moniker attached to the opening prologue. Nominated for 11 Oscars (winner of 8).<br /><br />Over the past 28 years:<br />"Star Wars" has been re-released 7 times (including the Special Edition release) in theaters, & released on video 7 times (including the 2004 DVD release, a repricing in the late 80's, & a repackage (very badly) in the early 90's ). I've seen a very early rental copy of "Star Wars", with a plastic clamshell box that says "for rental only" at the bottom of the box from 1983, go for sale on e-bay, a few years back, for roughly 250 to 300 bucks. Thats a rarity.<br /><br />Differences over the years:<br /><br />The film had different audio tracks according to the film's format in theatre's (two types of formats were used in the original release, 35 mm & 70 mm. The 35 mm tracks were recorded first for national distribution while the 70 mm tracks were recorded for special releases. Rumor has it that these tracks weren't finished until the morning of the film's release).<br /><br />In 1997, the original trilogy was released in theatres as Special Edition's. the negative for "Star Wars" was cleaned up with a few new scenes added among them:<br /><br />The Stormtrooper squad that finds the droids escape pod is a lot bigger than in the original release. Overall, nice effect that either way doesn't kill the film.<br /><br />Mos Eisley spaceport gets a big redo. Instead of the hole in the ground from the original release, here its a big spaceport complete with ships taking off & all sorts of new scum & villainy walking the streets. Overall, this was always Lucas' vision, but, again, due to time & budget back in the day he had to make due with what he had. Still, he didn't need to take out the werewolf creature from the cantina.<br /><br />During the confrontation between Greedo & Han Solo, Greedo shoots first while the original shot of Solo firing is now a retaliation shot. The most absolute damning thing George Lucas has done to the moviegoing public (that includes "Howard The Duck"). This basiclaly destroys some of Han Solo's character. This guy doesn't take s*it from anybody. But, with the tinkering of this shot, its now just in self-defense. It sucks anyway you look at it.<br /><br />Jabba The Hutt makes an appearance (he was originally supposed to be in the film, but, due to budget & money constraints in 1976, he could never be fully realized). A fully grown Boba Fett is also present in the background setting up his bigger role in "Empire". Overall, cool effect & the scene was always meant to be there. But, Jabba looks a bit odd & doesn't look like the Jabba from "Return Of The Jedi".<br /><br />Han Solo is chased by battalions of Stormtrooopers instead of five. Overall, funny effect, but, so was the original.<br /><br />Certain dogfight scenes were replaced with CGI substitues to make the battle's more tight & fast. Overall, needed in spots & the battle is now more of a grand scale assault.<br /><br />A new scene between Luke & his friend Biggs Darklighter has been added before the space battle at the climax of the film. Note: a line about Luke's father is cut. As Red Leader is about to speak to Luke & Biggs a crewman walks in front of the camera with Red Leader, saying "You'll do all right." The correct line is "If your as good a pilot as your father was, You'll do all right." Overall, nice scene that lets the viewer in on a little bit of the friendship between Luke & Biggs before his death.<br /><br />For the 2004 DVD release:<br /><br />A new Jabba The Hutt takes the place of the old. Overall, needed. The new Jabba looks more like the "Jedi" Jabba, and is better for it.<br /><br />A 27 year old film gaffe is finally fixed. If you have an old VHS copy of the film, fast forward to the scene where just after Darth Vader cuts down Obi-Wan Kenobi, notice when the big metal doors close, take a careful notice to the color of Vader's lightsabre. Its rotoscope white, not the trademark red. That has finally been fixed. The other gaffe's haven't.<br /><br />The audio seems a bit off. Whenever Vader speaks, his breathing takes a backseat while his voice is less synthsizory & has more tamber to it. John Williams' classic score is less booming in some scenes & I find that a real problem.<br />This probablly won't be the last release of the film on video.<br /><br />"Star Wars" is presented best in the widescreen format & is in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround & is THX approved with enough of "The Force" to wake the neighbors, & scare the dog.</p></br><a href="../users/A2E3F04ZK7FG66.html">A2E3F04ZK7FG66</a><br/><p>It is certainly too bad that Lucas has decided to treat the 1977 version of Star Wars with such low regard, especially considering the fact that it was those of us that showed up to the theaters in droves to see this film thirty years ago that made his "empire" what it became. All I wanted was to see the exact scenes in the exact sequence that I saw them in back in 1977 with the same hokie sound effects, men running around in rubber costumes portraying all of the various creatures, and poorly rendered graphics. After all, that is all part of the nostalgia, and the nostalgia is all part of the fun. However, I did expect to see the film at least "cleaned up" from an audio and visual perspective, and that I did not get. As for the 2004 edition, that feature gets the royal treatment, but you have to put up with the infamous altering of Han's shootout with Greedo, as well as all of the added scenes, including digitally added dinosaur-like creatures that were considered state-of-the art when Jurassic Park came out 16 years after this movie was made. Neither makes for a satisfying film viewing experience for an oldster such as myself with a preconceived notion of what I want to see.<br /><br />Apparently, the fact that these double-feature releases of the original Star Wars trilogy haven't sold well has us in a circular argument with its creator. You see, fewer people than expected have bought this set, since they are waiting for the 9-disc Ultimate Star Wars Saga to come out in a boxed set. However, Lucas is now determined to hold off putting out the trilogy boxed set for that very reason. Due to poor sales of this set he now intends to wait until 2008 or 2009 to release the long-awaited trilogy boxed set. The information in this last paragraph comes from the Feb. 23 post at The Rumor Mill of digitalbits, so it is still, after all, just a rumor. At any rate, something has to be done to stop Lucas from continuing to be the Darth Vader of digital editing. I really don't believe this business about Lucas' vision continuing to drive him to tinker - or not tinker - with these films. I think the original success of Star Wars surprised Lucas as much as anyone. After all, the original commercials for Star Wars back in 1977 said "This summer see Star Wars ... just for the fun of it".</p></br><a href="../users/AGKPTMTR3UX1R.html">AGKPTMTR3UX1R</a><br/><p>I agree with any of a number of previous reviewers: Would somebody PLEASE take STAR WARS away from George Lucas before he ruins it completely?<br /><br />Like Francis Ford Coppola, who messed with THE GODFATHER trilogy over and over again trying to "perfect" it, Lucas keeps coming back to the original STAR WARS trilogy and adding enhanced effects and formerly deleted scenes.<br /><br />In what is now known as STAR WARS EPISODE IV: A NEW HOPE, (let me catch my breath a minute, please), Lucas decided to add creatures to the Mos Eiseley spaceport scene, alter the classic cantina scene, throw in a scene between Jabba the Hutt and Han Solo in the hangar of the "Millennium Falcon," add a sappy reunion scene between Biggs and Luke just before the Battle of Yavin, make the battle scene explosions more "dramatic," do a score of other little tweaks, and clean up the print.<br /><br />Lucas has done this so many times over the past three decades that it's now impossible to figure out which film is the "real" STAR WARS. Of all the questionable "improvements" he's made, cleaning up the print is the only worthwhile effort. Most of the added scenes add nothing to the film, the "extra" creatures are interesting but unnecessary, and some of the changes  actually degrade the movie, because the dialogue is repetitious. For example:<br /><br />IN THE CANTINA:<br /><br />Greedo---Jabba has no use for smugglers who dump their cargoes at the first sign of an Imperial ship.<br /><br />Han---Even I get boarded sometimes. Do you think I had a choice?<br /><br />and<br /><br />IN THE HANGAR:<br /><br />Jabba--- I have no use for smugglers who dump their cargoes at the first sign of an Imperial ship.<br /><br />Han---Even I get boarded sometimes. Do you think I had a choice?<br /><br />Not only was it repetitious, but the hangar scene immediately followed the cantina scene, making the repetition even more obvious. DEAR LORD, WHAT WERE YOU THINKING, MR. LUCAS??????<br /><br />Fortunately, this two-disc set contains the original theatrical release with all the nicks and imperfections it was born with. The print's a bit dim, and the special effects are showing their limitations after thirty years, but this is the STAR WARS that will remain STAR WARS. It is what it is, and it never needed changes. Given the immense amount of material that has grown up around STAR WARS since it was first released, Lucas would have been smarter to release one or the other or both versions as he did, but added an Extras disc with all kinds of "The Making Of.." and "The Legacy Of..." goodies. I was disappointed that this isn't that set.<br /><br />I was one of the first people to see STAR WARS when it debuted in the summer of 1977. At age 17, this now-classic movie became and remains a benchmark of an era in my life. While I never became a "Jedihead" (the original tag for the STAR WARS version of a Trekkie), I liked the film a great deal.<br /><br />STAR WARS is not CITIZEN KANE IN OUTER SPACE. It's not a "great" film, but it is a true "classic." At the end of the first film you might even wonder what all the hype was about. Yet the movie has a engaging and endearing quality that makes you want to keep coming back for more, the true basis of success and the core of meaningfulness for any story. STAR WARS is clearly derivative. THE LORD OF THE RINGS has a "Dark Lord." STAR WARS has a "Dark Lord of the Sith." Lightsabers are yet another nod to the film's Sword & Sorcery roots, as is the Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi (a little Gandalf, anyone?). STAR WARS' "Corellians" appear in Isaac Asimov's FOUNDATION as "Korellians", and "Han Solo" is also there as "Hari Seldon." The space war elements are a mishmash of STAR TREK, FORBIDDEN PLANET, AMAZING STORIES, pulp fiction, and a hundred other sources. George Lucas was able to take these well-used pieces and combine them into something that is both very original and yet archetypal.<br /><br />STAR WARS is a sci-fi retelling of the Mythos of the young Hero. Aided by a mentor (Obi-Wan), an older, more seasoned companion (Han), and his own court jesters (See Threepio and Artoo Detoo), the young Hero (Luke) is introduced to his special (Jedi) birthright, saves the beautiful Princess (Leia) from the clutches of Evil (Darth Vader), and then must confront that Evil himself (the Battle of Yavin).<br /><br />Since STAR WARS is so mythic and archetypal, it survives some really bad acting by the background characters, a few missed beats here and there, and even Lucas's post-theatrical obsessive-compulsive changes to remain a modern classic.<br /><br />FIVE STARS FOR "STAR WARS", ONE STAR FOR LUCAS' DECISION (OBSESSION?) TO "IMPROVE" IT.</p></br><a href="../users/A220FJEQNGMSRN.html">A220FJEQNGMSRN</a><br/><p>Watching the original versions of the original Star Wars trilogy on DVD is like travelling back in time - not so much to the innocence of youth but more to the days when picture quality was never much of a consideration on video releases and Fox had the reputation for the worst transfers in the business. Watching the new DVD is to step back into an age of low resolution standards conversions with all the loss of detail and motion blurring that that entailed: certainly if you've got one of the old remastered video releases you might as well hold on to that, because the quality isn't as poor as this. The sound quality is pretty awful as well. From Lucas' past track record it's all too easy to imagine this is just a scam to allow him to sell a remastered version a couple of years down the line, but it's even harder to dispel the notion that somewhere Lucas is whining "See how soft the focus is? How can you say these are better films?"<br /><br />Although commonly blamed for the death of cinema as we knew it, in truth Star Wars was a huge breath of fresh air after the increasingly stale and formulaic week-in, week-out reality of woefully unimaginative and derivative downbeat on-the-cheap 70s cinema. It wasn't merely a matter of having a happy ending, more that there was a sense of panache and unapologetic adventure that had been missing for too long at the time (even the decade's best adventures, such as The Wind and the Lion and The Man Who Would Be King, saw their heroes destroyed by society in an age that had no place for them). Looking at it for the first time in years, its much better directed than remembered, extremely well constructed and beautifully designed, introducing the `future is old' concept that many would attribute to Ridley Scott. It also, unlike the prequels, has the saving grace of Han Solo, a character whose deprecating sense of humor undercuts the more solemn and potentially pretentious moments in a way that would be much missed amid the talk of apprentices, trade embargoes and midi-chloridians in the prequels. It's still fun and it still works, even in the very worst transfer of the originals.</p></br><a href="../users/A3CN9CCJUNIPKT.html">A3CN9CCJUNIPKT</a><br/><p>My fondest memory of "Star Wars" in 1977 was going to a special preview screening at a mall in Kansas City (nyah-nyah-nyah... I saw it before you did!) with some adult companions in tow... Opinion pollsters were crawling all over the mall, interviewing people about the film (and offering them a few bucks for their time!) and one of the guys I saw with, a hippie named Kirk, took the poll, got his silver dollar and told the guy that the special effects were amazing.  The thing was, we were still wandering around the mall, waiting for the second show... and hadn't seen the movie yet!  It didn't matter -- Kirk was just telling the guy what he wanted to hear... And besides, it was true: for the time, the special effects were great!<br /><br />Like many people of my generation, I saw "Star Wars" several times that summer (seven times, total, I think...) though I didn't geek out on the sequels and drifted away from the fold as I got older.  Still, I read about George Lucas's obstinant refusal to reissue the original '77 version with something close to revulsion.  So what if he's the film's creator?  Does that really give him the right to edit history, and to try and make people believe the first "Star Wars" film -- a watershed in global pop culture -- was something different than it really was?  And besides, wasn't a huge part of the charm of the series how darn rickety the first film was?  When I finally saw the altered (1997) "special edition," I was shocked at how clumsy and garish Lucas' digital updates were -- did he really think these were improvements?  Oh, well.  Nothing to get worked up about, I guess.<br /><br />I'm glad, though, that the original 1977 version is available again, and that modern viewers can see what the movie really looked like, more or less, back when it packed kids into the malls and moviehouses during the disco era.  Okay, maybe there are technical limitations and maybe Lucas is (inexplicably) feuding with his fan base, but at least having *some* unaltered version available is more intellectually honest (and historically valuable) than pretending that AVID decks, etc., were available all those decades ago.  It was a cheesy, exciting middlebrow action film: let's remember as it really was!</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>I saw the original "Star Wars" (you can keep calling it "Episode IV: A New Hope" all you want, I do not have to go along with it) in a theater far and away more times than any other movie (low double figures).  I saw "Star Wars" as much as the films I saw the second and third most often in a movie theater, which would be, of course, "The Empire Strikes Back" and "The Return of the Jedi."  I even sat through the movie twice in a row, the first time so I could pay attention to everything that happened in the lower left quadrant of the film and the second time so I could watch the lower right quadrant.<br /><br />Watch the film again for the first time in several years three things stuck out in my mind as to why this film got us so excited way back when.  The first, as noted above, was how there was so to look at in this film.  Nobody ever laughed at the alien in the sunglasses trailing after the good guys at Mois Eisley, but in addition to the all the weird looking aliens in the Cantina and throughout the film there was the way this galaxy far, far away looked like it had been lived in.  The idea that the Millenium Falcon is not only the fastest hunk of junk in the galaxy but actually looks like a hunk of junk mattered.  Even the wacky white armor of the Storm Troopers meant something to us, even if we questioned its functionality.  You could reduce Han Solo to his grin, Princess Leia to her hairdo, and Luke Skywalker to his light saber, because the costumes and art design were things we had never seen before.  Of course, Darth Vader being able to think people to death was pretty impressive.<br /><br />The second is that if there is any one thing that made "Star Wars" move than a "B" movie made with an "A" budget it is the musical score by John Williams.  The composer had won his first Oscar two years earlier for "Jaws" and was also nominated for "Close Encounters of the Third Kind" when he won again for "Star Wars."  One of the things we did because we could not go and sit in the theater watching "Star Wars" all day was to listen to the double-album for the movie's soundtrack (yes, I probably listened to this soundtrack more than any other in history than did not require singing "The Time Warp" or any other song).  I do not know how much of the movie is scored to music, but it has to be an extremely high percentage, albeit short of what you would get with a silent film.  The only movie score that I find comparable is the one Ennio Morricone did for "Once Upon a Time in the West," especially in terms of have motifs associated with characters.<br /><br />The final thing that made this movie great was the entire final sequence where the Rebels attack the Death Star.  The X-Wing fighters are still the coolest I have ever seen, despite what we have seen from "Battlestar Galactica" to "Farscape" and everything in between.  I would really love to see the complete original template George Lucas put together for the special effects crew spliced together from World War II movies.  Not only do we have the drama of the "Dam Busters" runs on the Death Star, but the sequences provides a number of memorable characters, most of whose names we never learn: Red Leader (Drewe Henley), Red Two (Dennis Lawson), Red Four (Jack Klaff), Red Six (William Hootkins), Gold Leader (Angus Mcinnis), Gold Two (Jeremy Sinden), and Gold Five (Graham Ashley).  Everything that happened was so vivid that when listening to the lengthy "Battle of Yavin" cut on the soundtrack I swear we could recreate every shot in our minds.<br /><br />Perhaps the best way of describing the impact of "Star Wars" is to say that it must have been similar to what happened a generation or two earlier when Dorothy opened the door to Oz and the screen went from sepia tones to Technicolor.  It was an introduction to a whole new world.  Even if we never saw a Saturday morning serial we could appreciate the idea of a roller coaster type of ride where Sand People attack, the Millenium Falcon has to escape the Death Star, and the Rebel base is almost within range.<br /><br />In terms of the controversy over the way George Lucas has tinkered with his 1977 film, I have already bought into the idea of the director's cut, so it is hard to fault the director for having a slightly different definition of that from others.  I remember how outdated the special effects looked three years later when "Empire" came out, so updating them makes sense to me.  The scene with Jabba sets up what happens in the rest of the original trilogy and I think the scene with Biggs before the attack is important simply because I think the idea that the last person killed is Luke's best friend.  Besides, I have the film we saw in 1977 preserved in a letterboxed edition on laser disc and can still watch it whenever I want.<br /><br />Actually, what surprised me the most with this "final" version of the original "Star Wars" movie was how tacky the attempts by Lucas to retroactively fix his character's flaws.  To be clear that Han Solo is not a cold blooded killer Greedo now shoots first, although he is an incredible bad shot, especially from four feet away.  Then there was the shock that Leia no long kisses Luke on the lips "For luck" before they swing across that chasm.  Now it is a chaste little peck on the cheek.  It will be interesting to see what Lucas does with that early scene in "The Empire Strikes Back," but I wlll find out about that tomorrow.</p></br><a href="../users/A1G9FX1KV45N41.html">A1G9FX1KV45N41</a><br/><p>Star Wars (1977)<br /><br />This is the great original Star Wars, the 1977 movie in which the world first discovered the allure of The Force and the Jedi Knights. Young Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) teams up with Jedi veteran Ben Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness) and the mercenary Han Solo (Harrison Ford) to rescue the gorgeous Princess Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) from the sinister clutches of Darth Vader and the evil empire.<br />High space adventure, with creatures like Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) and the delightful R2-D2  (Kenny Baker).<br />With the final Star Wars (but will it be the final?) set for release later this year , the original trilogy is a great buy to refresh your memory.<br /><br />A momentous battle between good and evil. With the empire perhaps at the time representing the evil Soviet Empire, which the free world was then fighting against for freedom in 1977. It has that wonderful 1970's feel, and who would not want to rescue the sexy huggable Princess Leia, even if it means battling the goons of the empire and the horrific Darth Vader?</p></br><a href="../users/A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2.html">A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2</a><br/><p>I stand amazed at how, unlike other science fiction from the time, the original 1977 movie "Star Wars" (unseen since VHS days) stands up to the passing years.  Without the digital do-funnies and CGI visual effects, the original stands on the weight of actors' performances, skillful direction, and well-managed physical design.  Apparently other reviewers disagree with me, but I think the 1977 film looks both remarkably current and surprisingly good.<br /><br />When the Special Edition appeared in 1997, I remember thinking Mos Eisley looked remarkably crowded and busy.  Looking back on it now, I see why: because in the original, the streets stand empty.  This is a city where heat, poverty, and neglect boil over in a cauldron of desperation, just waiting for one half-cocked stormtrooper to set things on fire.  The revised version looks as busy as a college campus.<br /><br />In the best Hitchcock style, Lucas' subtle direction cuts around several times so you never notice you didn't see blasters go off, or lightsabers extend.  Lacking high-tech gadgets, Lucas uses ingenuity and human insight to make this film, and it's visible in the finished product.  He really sells that Tunisia and Guatemala are alien planets, or that sets built in airplane hangars actually are as big as a "small moon."<br /><br />That's not to forgive Lucasfilm for the shoddy transfer to DVD.  The 1977 version is very low-res, only slightly cleaner than my old VHS tape.  Nothing I've said should suggest that the original film surpasses the Special Edition.  The 1997 version has more smoothly integrated visual effects, more dynamic creatures, crisper colors, and cleaner sound.  But in a genre that notoriously doesn't age well, the original film looks remarkably new.</p></br><a href="../users/A3N3SN2DDD4HCJ.html">A3N3SN2DDD4HCJ</a><br/><p>&quot;Star Wars,&quot; George Lucas's timeless masterpiece, is like visiting a place in the imagination. Watching it again is like revisiting the time when movies were supposed to be fun, adventurous and great  looking. It still stands as probably the best and most popular science  fiction film, it makes &quot;Star Trek&quot; seem like something for boring  people. &quot;Star Wars&quot; is a unique blend of action, romance,  mythology, style, technology, and just plain good old storytelling. The  characters are plain, but who cares? They live in a universe so complex  that their own complexity is something we could care less about. What's  great here is the blend of special effects and the story. Lucas fills the  screen with great visuales while still telling an exhilarating tale of good  against evil, a princess in distress, a wise old master of the Force, his  young pupil who will reach a greater peak, a space pirate and his hairy  comrade and they only care about the bounty, and a dark lord who wishes to  stop them. &quot;Star Wars&quot; never fails to entertain, looks great and  feels great from the first shot to the last. Lucas's script is pure  brilliance and imagination. Watching &quot;The Phantom Menace,&quot; you  realize &quot;Star Wars&quot; is still better. Lucas has created great  modern mythology, and an incredible blend of special effects with story.  &quot;Star Wars&quot; is still one of the greatest films of all time, an  immortal work.</p></br><a href="../users/ALN0TTRTLHA4E.html">ALN0TTRTLHA4E</a><br/><p>Star Wars was a film that not only succeeded as an entertainment but was a breakthrough. It was film that brought Science Fiction into the main stream. It also changed the role of female leads. Before Star Wars the role of the female lead in an adventure flick was to be rescued. To hang around looking tense until a male character sorted things out. Star Wars had a heroine who not only grabbed a gun and started shooting, but who was no stranger to control and exercising authority. The film also had one of the more original villains, Darth Vader.<br /><br />At the time the films success was seen to be the result of state of the art special effects. But the reality is that on top of the effects there was a tightly written script with dialogue that contained some humour and wit. The musical score was also important in developing the mood of the film. It has one of the most effective scores since Siegfried.<br /><br />Yet the success of the film lies in the plot density and the degree of invention and originality of scenes. If one looks at modern science fiction or action films it is unusual to see the degree of invention that occurred with Star Wars. Consider for instance the franchise competitor Star Treck. Star Treck films usually show a mock up of a space craft and then scenes set on something which looks like earth. Blade runner used the one set. Star Wars opens up in space but after that it does not stop. Lucas is a director who excels in tableaux.  With characters we open with Darth Vader but we quickly move on to two robots who will be the main vehicle for developing the plot. Shortly after we have a race of dwarf mechanics, sandmen and their animals, a bar full of strange musicians, a weird enforcer. The settings move from space to a desert planet and back to space. The visual variety of the film and the plot density more than cover any of the weakness of the dialogue.<br /><br />The film is also set in a rational universe. A central government is trying to exsert control over what was once a less authoritarian system. It is using military force to subdue the parts of what was a republic so that an empire can be consolidated. The plot is centred on the deployment of a weapon so powerful that it can decisively tip the balance in favour of the emperor who we do not see but only hear about.  Of course it was unusual that the events which occurred so long ago in a galaxy so far away so mimic out history. The term emperor for instance was one invented by Rome's first emperor Augustus. He used it as a propaganda move to avoid the hostility to the term king. Princess is another one of Augustus' inventions but developed later to refer to an emperor in training after the Empire was split into a Western and Eastern Section. However one should not be to picky in looking at the semantics of a film.<br /><br />It is interesting in the light of subsequent films that Darth Vader at this point does not seem that important. He takes orders from a character called Grand Moff Tarkin. Darth Vader has certain supernatural powers. He can strangle people through a thought process. However he is a person who appears to be on the way out. The other characters ridicule him in one scene and it appears a world in which technology is dominant and his skills are no longer in demand.<br /><br />The end of the film was based on the battle of Britain. Lucas apparently used historical footage of second World War aerial dog fights to set up the last scene. It is a ants v elephants battle in which the ants through the use of careful targeting are victorious.<br /><br />At the end of the film the empire's special weapon has been destroyed, one of he main characters who appeared initially somewhat self-centred has shown his devotion to a higher duty and all the plot strands have been tied up except for Darth Vader who has lived to set up a sequel.</p></br><a href="../users/AHCVWPLA1O4X8.html">AHCVWPLA1O4X8</a><br/><p>I love the original Star Wars movies.  I owned them on the original VHS release.  When Lucasfilms released the trilogy on VHS in the `special' THX format I was more than happy to oblige, and bought the entire trilogy.  Then came the special extended versions of the movies-great!  I saw those in theaters and rushed to buy them when they came out on VHS.  I missed the Laserdisc version and didn't buy anything else on VHS, but then came the DVD release of the trilogy (the extended versions of the film).  Hey, I thought, I already own these movies in 3, yes 3, versions.  But what the heck-Lucas and co. are saying they'll never release the original versions of the film on DVD anyway, so why not make it 4?<br /><br /> Now we're looking at yet another release of the films.  This is promised to be a "Limited Edition," which probably means it will only be out until demand subsides and they can release another version.  If this were a new Dolby or Hi Def release of the original movies I may consider them, but its not.  It's a rehashed release of the Laserdisc version of the films from 13 or so years ago, hideously outdated and ignorant of the technological advantages of DVD.  I'm not going to bite on this release-I've had enough for the time being.<br /><br /> When (and to me it's a question of when, not if) Lucas finally decides to put forth a bit of effort and release Episodes IV-VI in a format that's not 15 years outdated I'll buy, though by this point I feel I shouldn't.  But I see no reason to buy this release.  Before the first DVD version came out Lucas said he wouldn't release the original films on DVD until after Episode 3-that turned out to be a lie.  Then he said he'd never release the original theatricals on DVD-that, too has proved untrue.  I'm fairly certain that we'll get a new version of the theatrical releases soon, maybe one that will be worth owning.  Until then I can be patient-Lucas is apparently so willing to bleed his die-hard fans dry that the only true "definitive" release of the films will be the one Lucas does right before he, himself, passes on.  Only then will these poor, tired classics get a rest.</p></br><a href="../users/AN9J46667D80O.html">AN9J46667D80O</a><br/><p>I was born in April of 1972. My earliest memory is of the Bicentennial celebrations. I seem to remember watching people playing around with fireworks at our neighbor's house. But I'm not 100% sure these memories are accurate.<br /><br />The first memory I know for sure is accurate is seeing "Star Wars" in 1977. This was back when it was just "Star Wars". Not "Star Wars: Episode IV: A New Hope". No, it was just a simple, single film.<br /><br />But what a film it was! I am pretty sure I'd seen movies in theatres before this one, but I don't remember doing so. The first movie I remember seeing after this one is "Star Trek: The Motion Picture". When I got a little older, I remember being very happy every time I went to visit my Aunt Judy because she had HBO, and there was a decent chance they'd be showing Star Wars, so I'd get to see it again. When Christmas and birthdays rolled around, one of the things I'd always ask for was "Star Wars" action figures. My mom always made me use a magic marker to color their feet black so they wouldn't get mixed up with any owned by any of the neighbor kids.<br /><br />Through the 1980's a lot of my life centered around the "Star Wars" films. I remember seeing "The Empire Strikes Back" and "Return of the Jedi" when they were first in theatres. Hell, I've even seen the abortion best known to the world as The Star Wars Holiday Special!<br /><br />I provide this rather lengthy digression because I want to make it clear that this movie has had a huge impact on my life, and that's something reasonably common to my generation. We're called "Generation X", but in many ways we're really the "Star Wars" Generation. The earliest members of the generation would've been only twelve or thirteen when the first movie came out. The last ones were born when "Return of the Jedi" was still fresh.<br /><br />With Star Wars George Lucas managed to take several diverse elements (mythology, Japanese cinema, westerns, etc), and combine them into a film that was truly universal in nature. You can take the movie to just about anywhere in the world and people will recognize elements familiar to them, even if they've never seen the movie before.<br /><br />Even now, thirty-one years after the movie first premired, it's casting a shadow over the world of film. Along with such movies as "The Birth of a Nation" and "Citizen Kane", it completely recreated the way movies are made. Certainly it's one of the most influential films ever made. It's also far more accessible than either of those other two great movies.<br /><br />Of course no real reflection on this movie could go by without taking notice of the amazing score by John Williams. Even now, I bet you can remember the sound of the music playing as Luke looked out at the twin suns setting, or the music playing as everyone but Chewbacca got medals, and of course you'll remember the amazing theme to the film's opening titles. The film's score gave a gravitas to science fiction music that had been previously reached only by "2001 - A Space Odyssey" (a film not nearly as good and very overrated), and even that movie's score was made impressive by the fact that it was lifted from the classical masters.<br /><br />Of course back in 1997, many fans screamed, "Murther! Murther most foul!" when George Lucas released the special edition versions of the movies with enhanced special effects and the like. Me, I like the special edition versions of all three movies, especially the first. They don't change the story any, they are prettier to look at, and it was nice to see the movies in the theatres again.<br /><br />The film is not without flaws. The dialogue is a little clunky and wooden (to those bitching about the prequels being shallow on the dialogue, I suggest you go back and listen to the first three films again). The characters are pretty one-dimensional for the most part.<br /><br />But despite those flaws, the movie is spectacular, and even now has an impact that cannot be underestimated. I remember a few years ago, after it had first come out on DVD, I had a couple friends over for Christmas. We were talking, playing video games and just generally goofing around. While we were eating, I popped on the movie, and even though we'd all seen it a half a gazillion times, we were still enthralled and gave it our almost undivided attention to a film that came out in 1977. Now that's praise!<br /><br />This isn't the best film in the sextology. That honor goes to The Empire Strikes Back. But it is the most important film, and one of the best movies ever made.<br /><br />With this DVD you get the original film and you get the special edition version that was created for the original DVD release back in 2004. Which is better? Eh, honestly I prefer the special edition version, but that's just me. Either way, it's a wonderful buy.</p></br><a href="../users/A1COW0UIB5HA9J.html">A1COW0UIB5HA9J</a><br/><p>Long ago in a galaxy far away, Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) has kidnapped by the evil Darth Vader (Played by David Prowse and voiced by James Earl Jones). She sents out two special robots named C-3PO (Voiced by Anthony Daniels) and R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) to a plaet to find someone named Obi-Wan Kenobi (Sir Alec Guiness) as he is Leia's only hope. A farmboy named Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamil) somehow finds the droids then takes them to a sleazy alien bar where they meet lovable smuggler Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and furry friend Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew). They all join forces together, as they must try to rescue the princess and stop Darth Vader's sinister plan.<br /><br />What is there to say about this movie? it launched a new hope in Sci-fi and fantasy movies, it started out as an idea by George Lucas when he wrote the script, story and even created the SW universe as he wanted to sell this to Universal or United Artist. Then later, 20th Century Fox bought the rights to his movie and a year later the film was finished and had an unexpected success. The film was embraced by both audiences and critics as it as a masterpiece unlike anything they ever seen, a phenomeneon was born. The film itself offers great performances, spectacular special effects, a good storyline and non-stop entertainment all the way! The film spawned two sequels, three prequels, neverending merchandise, imitators, video games, toys and other cool stuff.<br /><br />This DVD has for the very first time the classic first movie in it's original un-special edition version with some of the stuff that was left out from the 1997 special edition re-issue such as the werewolf-esque creatures, no Jabba the Hut, and of course the purist's fans much loved scene where Han shoots first. This also included the 1997 special edition, the picture on both movies are nicely remastered and this is guaraneteed to satisfy SW fans who brought the trilogy on DVD in it's boxset.</p></br><a href="../users/A13IKSGDYNBNQS.html">A13IKSGDYNBNQS</a><br/><p>If I knew this was the the only way ever I could buy the original 3 films as released in the cinema I would buy these discs.<br /><br />I've just borrowed this one from a friend and the original version on disc 2 is in 2.35 - 1 letterbox (no problem with that) but not anamorphic (why?). This means those of us who own widescreen TV's have to either watch a tiny image to get the best quality picture or zoom it out and lose quality. No thanks I'll take the chance and wait.<br /><br />The quality of the disc 2 original is OK, but you need to know that the picture is not anamorphic. What this means in simple terms is that on a widescreen TV you get black bars top and bottom as well as right and left, unless you use your TV's zoom option.<br /><br />Next year is the 30th anniversary and George Lucas may do us all a favour next year and release the originals as they were supposed to be seen.</p></br><a href="../users/A2QQHIY23PL7H3.html">A2QQHIY23PL7H3</a><br/><p>To echo the sentiments shared by a lot of reviewers here, my anticipation for these releases dropped to nothing the moment I heard the theatrical versions wouldn't even be anamorphically enhanced. Lucas has bonus features on his dvds that are technologically superior to this; unpolished 1993 laserdisc transfers are pretty much what you'd get from bootlegs and pirated online copies. I don't need to pay money for that.<br /><br />Personally, I think we'll see the original theatrical versions again in the future. If these can be released after Lucas has already put his foot down, they'll be released again. And somewhere down the line, Fox and Lucasfilm will finally get the release right. Until then, I'm not buying into any "limited edition" scams.</p></br><a href="../users/A2M5FI4CB6VUXF.html">A2M5FI4CB6VUXF</a><br/><p>It has been a long time since I've seen the original Star Wars theatrical releases. The way they were ORIGINALLY. I loved it. For me, it's like watching a good Charlie Chaplin movie. You don't focus on the lack of special effects, sound or what they don't have. You let your imagination run wild and simply go along for the ride.<br /><br />As Luke Skywalker begins his journey to self-discovery, I find myself walking it with him, unobstructed by 21st century special effects and additions that look grossly out of place in the updated version. The updated version has its place, but I much prefer the classic 1977 release.<br /><br />There's something to be said for the way things were... "a long long time ago, in a movie theater not so far away..."</p></br><a href="../users/A2TAPL67U2A5HM.html">A2TAPL67U2A5HM</a><br/><p>Star Wars, Episode IV- A New Hope (Widescreen Edition)~ Mark Hamill is great sci-fi movie and it does make a lot more sense after watching the first 3 movies which came out almost 30 years later. Knowing the background story explains a lot of things that made little to no sense before. For example, why r2-d2 and c3po are always together, the nature of Darth Vader, why Obi-one Kenobi is Lukes jedi master and many many other questions that one had whilst watching this movie before. The special effects are a bit primitive but for the time they were outstanding and some of the best in the business. The music is right on the money. The script is very well written and the plot is filled with action and and exciting adventure. If one does have to say something negative then it is to the fact that Mark Hamill  is a terrible actor and just about anyone could have played that part better. Even so this is a great movie and I give it 5 well deserved stars.</p></br><a href="../users/AVQJD41PLPOOQ.html">AVQJD41PLPOOQ</a><br/><p>Make no mistake!  We're talking about the original version of STAR WARS as it was realeased on video "one last time" in 1995.  Black and blue box with Darth Vader on the cover.<br /><br />While the special edition in 1997 was entertaining, it was in no way an improvement for STAR WARS purists, like myself.  The video I'm describing is the original 1977 film before George Lucas started butchering it and it has the benefit of being remastered in THX.<br /><br />I'm not saying don't own the special edition DVD.  Of course own it!  It looks and sounds perfect!  I'm saying own BOTH!<br /><br />By the way, everything I've said I also holds true for the 1995 video release of THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, as well.  Between the original film and the 2004 DVD release, this film got butchered the most.  The insertion of Ian McDermid into the scene between Darth Vader and the Emperor was beyond shameful!<br /><br />I can only hope Lucas will one day get the message from his fans and release the original (3) films on DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/AM2PV53UX1JEQ.html">AM2PV53UX1JEQ</a><br/><p>I was so enraptured by this movie when it appeared in 1977 that I saw it 20 times in one summer.  It continues to captivate its audiences, as I witness my nephews now caught up in its imaginative, accessible story and  engrossing characters.  While I still prefer the version without the  special improvements, as they were, this movie will always deliver.  It is  the perfect popcorn adventure, with dashing leads, a swashbuckling sci-fi  story, lots of fun stuff to pepper the proceedings, and a symphony to  underscore it all.  Good vs. evil, and guess who wins?  The ending, which  feels like the finale to a big musical, has you grinning from ear to ear.</p></br><a href="../users/A1435P5AMCPB3X.html">A1435P5AMCPB3X</a><br/><p>If you do not already own the star wars DVD's, then this is excellent for you, so ignore the reviews below, and get this, but most folks that will buy these already have them.<br /><br />If you bought these, and own the other DVD's or VHS tapes, I hope you got them as cheap as I did (for the price of about one DVD).  These are barely worth anything over 12 bucks.  Why Lucas waisted the plastic to re-press the 2005 editions, I do not know.  He should have taken the time to make the old ones letter box or 16:9 so we can get the full screen shots again, so we can get a truely un-adultarted version of the theatrical version.  I, like many others, already have 2004 versions, and the 1995 version on vhs.  I wish he would have done the modifications as I listed above, released the versions as one disc, and then priced them to move (under 10 bucks).  I'm sure he'll see these reviews, and do that in about 2 years, so he can build another wing on his house, or buy an island in the pacific. It's too bad I had to sink and get these this way to have a DVD copy of the originals.</p></br><a href="../users/ACKDSX71VI5HY.html">ACKDSX71VI5HY</a><br/><p>AUTHOR'S NOTE: Though this package includes an updated cut of the film, I will review the original version of it.  Spoilers will follow.<br /><br />REVIEW<br /><br />This is it.  The 1977 original film(paired with an 'enhanced' version of same).  Starring Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, and Sir Alec Guinness, "Star Wars: Episode IV-A New Hope" is a powerful and landmark film for generations.<br /><br />The story is a model of simplicity that suggests a multitude of intricacies and hidden meanings.  At bottom, the young man Luke Skywalker forms an uneasy partnership with a shifty ally named Han Solo to rescue a princess.  The galaxy is in the grip of a murderous Empire, led by a faceless and cruel master foot soldier named Darth Vader.  Vader is one of the great villains in popular film, in this film brought to life onscreen by two people.  James Earl Jones' voice is deep and rich, yet also icy-cold when and where it needs to be.  David Prowse wears Vader's immaculate black suit very convincingly.  Luke, Han, and Princess Leia  must manage their egos and grapple with individual responsibility and personal loss to hope to defeat the powerful dark forces, which also include a sea of white-armored StormTroopers and a ruthless evil bureaucrat played by Peter Cushing.<br /><br />The script carries a level of detail and maturity that is missing from every single prequel.  It is here that George Lucas massages the idea of lightsaber battles doubling as psychological revelations and exposition.  The dialogue between Sir Alec Guinness and James Earl Jones during a pivotal lightsaber battle is exemplary for dropping tantalizing clues at a shared past history between their characters.  The Force isn't an underdeveloped joke but an appropriate metaphor for religion and, most especially, spirituality.  Specifically, an intriguing rivalry develops between Obi Wan (Ben) Kenobi, and Han Solo.  Performances are uniformly excellent, with special mention for Sir Alec Guinness in an Oscar-nominated turn as Obi Wan (Ben) Kenobi.<br /><br />If at all possible, see this movie and its immediate sequels "The Empire Strikes Back" and "Return of the Jedi" before any of the prequel movies.  This is a legendary movie, telling an engrossing story buttressed by one of John Williams' finest musical scores. The movie also features Anthony Daniels, Kenny Baker, and Peter Mayhew as the robot twosome C-3PO and R2-D2, respectively, and Solo's large hairy growling co-pilot Chewbacca.  I love this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3BJDFGSLXFB36.html">A3BJDFGSLXFB36</a><br/><p>What can I say about Star Wars that hasn't already been said?<br /><br />Not much.<br /><br />This is quite possibly one of the most perfect films ever made. Since its initial release it has become a long-lasting international phenomenon and an American cultural icon. How many other films in history have kept such a large and faithful fan base 30 years after it was released?<br /><br />This latest (and I'm POSITIVE it's not the last) release of this classic film is somewhat of a letdown. Many were outraged at the 1997 special edition and demanded the original theatrical release, but it looked as though that was not going to happen (yeah, right!). Finally, the original untouched version was given to us, but with no image upgrade or quality sound; plus, the image was letterboxed, not widescreen (BIG difference for those "in the know" and care about such things (like me)).<br /><br />Fear not, true believers. In an attempt to bag another zillion, Lucas is sure to release yet another version of his beloved creation, only this time it will be in DTS and Dolby 5.1 as well as anamorphic widescreen.<br /><br />You know it's going to happen. It's just a matter of time.<br /><br />As for me, I REFUSE to purchase this title (I purchased the 2004 special editions because it was all I could get at the time). When Lucas finally comes to his senses and releases what I really want, I'll be happy to part with some of my money. Until that day, any other "editions" will be completely ignored by me.</p></br><a href="../users/AZDVOFC2MTIM5.html">AZDVOFC2MTIM5</a><br/><p>Let's face it,although a bit dated and flawed in places, the original Star Wars(aka Episode IV A New Hope) is a movie that broke the mold on movie blockbusters.Although slightly altered by George Lucas in recent years, it's still a fascinating movie to behold.<br /> Although hard to comprehend to younger movie goers, when SW first came out in 1977, it was a ground breaking movie with it's state of the arts special effects, which continue to push the bounderies over the past quarter century, and it's fast paced editing.Where most recent science fiction movies were dark, cerebral and apocolyptic,(2001- A Space Odessy, Planet Of The Apes, and Lucas' own THX 1138), SW was an all out action movie that featured heroes to cheer for(Luke Skywalker, Han Solo,Leia Organa), as well as villians to hiss at(Grand Moff Tarkin, and of course, Darth Vader).George Lucas referenced his characters on literary and cinematic classics.<br />  Lucas' enthusiasm for his work  brings out the weaker points of the movie.The acting and screenplay are a bit over the top(Luke's whining,Darth Vader sounding more like a mad scientist, than the sinister figure of Empire Strikes Back), and even the dialogue comes off as forced (Tarkin's foul stench?).<br />  The flaws are petty compared to the impact of the  movie, and the love from fans who would still wait in line for weeks until a new episode .</p></br><a href="../users/A2ASIT0JYIGHTA.html">A2ASIT0JYIGHTA</a><br/><p>I bought this DVD because I wanted the 1977 film. However, I didn't check the back cover details properly (ie. 4:3 letterbox, yuck!). Fortunately, I read the Amazon site before removing the shrink-wrap. Thank you to all the reviewers who have warned about this DVD. I then marched back to the shop with my unopened DVD and got my money back. Thanks again to you all.<br /><br />I will not put up with non-anamorphic DVD's in this day and age. Nor will I put up with a greedy old fart called Lucas who fiddles with film history. It reminds me of when Spielberg stuffed around with E.T. in 2002. The CGI effects he introduced then were dreadful and made E.T. look comical.<br /><br />I am willing to bet that Star Wars (original version) will eventually be re-released correctly either in time for christmas 2007 or when the HD-DVD or Blue Ray format is settled.<br /><br />Thanks again to all you reviewers. You all deserve five stars, while this product only gets one star. The best part is, Lucas didn't get my money in the end!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A24F1UX8ZT5IXY.html">A24F1UX8ZT5IXY</a><br/><p>I am just guessing here, but I think I know what's going to happen. In about 12-24 months we're going to get word that the Star Wars movies are scheduled to be released in High Definition. But they will only be available in a gorgeously-designed glossy 9-DVD Box Set, with all of the films (special editions), extras. Maybe it will have the original Star Wars illustration of Darth Vader across the box -- and it will be something around $200 list, $140 on Amazon.<br /><br />Then once again people will voice their fury at Lucasfilm's arrogance. We will be stuck with Hayden Christansen digitally inserted into the finale of Return of the Jedi, a ridiculous CGI Jabba, the slobbering Max Reebo band, and everything else we detest.<br /><br />Then in about 2010 an ageing Lucas will relent, say he has listened to all the hearfelt pleas, and to much ballyhoo announce that yes he will indeed be releasing the original versions, and yes, because he cares so much, he will even clean them up and release them properly. He will be a compassionate hero while at the same time make umpteen millions more.<br /><br />Don't give this guy any more money. What he has done here is shameless and rude to the original fanbase. Non-anamorphic tranfers in this day and age is ridiculous.<br /><br />FOLLOW-UP: Well, it took a little longer than anticipated, but this scenario has unfolded almost exactly as I described above. However, even I could not have envisioned that Lucas would feather the nest with a couple of coffee table books on the making of "Star Wars" & "The Empire Strikes Back", in addition to dangling the rotten carrot of pointless deleted scenes before his abused fan base. Unbelievable. 2011 will see the final massive influx of cash into the Lucasfilm coffers from the DVD / Blu-Ray market, and then it's on to the next lucrative iteration: 3D theatrical re-re-re-release. 11/13/2010</p></br><a href="../users/A3V6Z4RCDGRC44.html">A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</a><br/><p>When I reached my 1,000th review on Amazon, I gave a lot of thought as to which item I wanted to be in that 1,000th spot. After all, I spent many years writing all of these reviews! Finally, I decided the spot should belong to Star Wars. This movie is one that literally affected the vocabulary of the world, and has become a cultural touchstone decades later. You can point out many books, movies, TV shows and even documentaries and news stories that refer to plot situations and characters from this very first Star Wars film.<br /><br />I was a child when the first Star Wars came out, and I literally went to see the show over 10 times in the theater. It was that powerful for me. There was a princess who stood up for herself - who grabbed the gun and defended herself, who helped plan the escapes and attacks. But on the other hand this wasn't a war movie - there were characters who talked about how the universe was interconnected and how every person in it could make a difference. People of all shapes, sizes and colors were accepted here. There were infinite worlds and infinite options. I adored this movie.<br /><br />While I appreciate the "improvements" made to this over the years, I really feel strongly that the original story was powerful because of the way it was written. It was the story that mattered - not high-flying special effects. I liked that Han shot first when he was in trouble. I liked that Mos Eisley was a desolate, quiet town - and that to Luke, this was a "big city". It really showed the relative value we all place on community. I think the *only* thing in the first movie that seemed a bit odd was when Han and Chewie were chasing after the stormtroopers on the Death Star - and fled because there were suddenly more than two. I do agree that that one change was probably necessary, but given that they were able to have "lots of people" (real or fake) in the final medal-presenting scene, I would have thought Lucas could have pulled that off here as well.<br /><br />In any case, I think there is a huge value in seeing the actual movie, as it was released, without any trickery or post-movie additions. I also think, if you've somehow never seen this movie at all, that you should really watch it at least once. With all the many subtle references to this movie that pop up in our culture every day, it's good to have that grounding and be able to understand the references properly.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UQIIJ2CD8REE.html">A2UQIIJ2CD8REE</a><br/><p>A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, a daydreaming farm boy named Luke Skywalker on the desert planet of Tatooine discovers a secret message in the memory banks of a small astromech droid called R2-D2.

Obi-Wan explains to Luke that he once fought alongside the boy's father, a long dead Jedi named Anakin Skywalker, that Anakin was killed by a dark and twisted former Jedi named Darth Vader, and that his hope was for Luke to carry on in the Jedi ways. Obi-Wan teaches Luke about the Force, an all-encompassing energy field created by life itself that gives the Jedi their seemingly supernatural abilities, from levitation to precognition, to incomparable speed and reflexes. The old Jedi also passes on to Luke the lightsaber of his father and teaches the boy to use the Jedi weapon, a sword of pure energy with the power to cut through nearly anything with the greatest of ease. Together, the aged Jedi, his new apprentice, and the two droids embark on a mission set forth by the message carried within R2-D2; a message from Princess Leia Organa of Alderaan asking Obi-Wan Kenobi to deliver the astromech droid safely to her home planet, for he also carries the secret plans that could help the rebellion destroy the evil Emperor's greatest weapon, the Death Star.<br /><br />Hiring a seedy Corellian pilot named Han Solo and his copilot, Chewbacca the Wookie, to fly them to Alderaan in the starship freighter the Millennium Falcon, Luke, Obi-Wan, and the droids are soon traveling through space at hyper-speed, doing their best to avoid the clutches of the evil Empire along the way. They shortly find themselves unwelcome guests in the lion's den, however, when their search for the now non-existent Alderaan lands them in the heart of the Death Star itself, a space station the size of a small moon with the fire power to destroy an entire planet with one laser blast! Together, the small band of heroes takes the opportunity to perform a dangerous rescue mission, saving the beautiful Princess Leia from the Emperor's vile henchman, Darth Vader, but not without first losing one of their own in the escape. It is now up to the remaining heroes and their princess to see the vital information within R2 is safely delivered to the rebel alliance, and that the Death Star is finally destroyed!<br /><br />In 1977, young filmmaker George Lucas changed the lives of countless young movie-goers by delivering unto them "Star Wars," a swashbuckling, sprawling space saga of rebellion, romance, and sorcery, in the style of the 1930s serials that inspired it, but with visual effects and imaginative characters the likes of which the world had never seen before! Starring newcomers Mark Hamill as naive and idealistic farm boy Luke Skywalker, Harrison Ford as dashing, fortune-seeking flyboy Han Solo, and Carrie Fisher as beautiful damsel in distress Princess Leia, along with the unforgettable voice of James Earl Jones as Darth Vader and screen legend  Alec Guinness as Obi-Wan Kenobi, "Star Wars" spun a timeless tale of familiar myth and legend in a whole new way, relying on outstanding acting performances and an incomparable John Williams musical score to take viewers beyond the fantastic surroundings and into the story itself. Drawing inspiration from the annals of film history, borrowing heavily from "The Wizard of Oz," tales of King Arthur, and the works of Akira Kurosawa, not to mention the history of mankind in general, George Lucas's seemingly simple tale is so full of detail and realism, even in its most unbelievable moments, that the viewer easily becomes lost in the adventure. That's just what "Star Wars" is, an adventure; a thrill ride for the young at heart!<br /><br />After its initial release, it was revealed that "Star Wars" was merely one chapter in a 6 part saga. To be more specific, the film first known as "Star Wars" was, in fact, "Star Wars, Episode 4: A New Hope." This led to two sequels that brought the story together as a legendary film trilogy beloved by millions of fans who buy up "Star Wars" merchandise greedily to this day! In 1997, "The Star Wars Trilogy" was rereleased to theaters for a new generation. It was a rerelease that brought mixed emotions among fans due to the new additions George Lucas had made to his film legacy. Through the magic of digital technology, special effects scenes were improved, deleted scenes were added with new digital characters, and the films were made to fall more in line with Lucas's original vision, which had been impossible to realize fully in the 1970s and `80s. George Lucas was happy. Many fans were not. However, many fans had no problem with the changes and even welcomed them, if awkwardly. It was all a foreshadowing of what was to come. Now, the first three chapters of the "Star Wars Saga" have been released as well, and the tale is complete; no longer a simple tale about farm boy Luke Skywalker and his friends defeating an evil galactic empire, but now a much deeper tale of redemption the likes of which was only emphasized before in Episode 6, "Return of the Jedi."<br /><br />With the long awaited DVD release of the original, or "classic" Star Wars Trilogy came even more "improvements" from creator George Lucas, continuing his attempt to make the six Star Wars films fit together as one epic story. The most noticeable, in this reviewer's opinion anyway (all those complaints about the Greedo scene seem overblown to me, and I'm a huge Han fan), is the scene where Han Solo converses with Jabba the Hutt. First restored to the film with a digital Jabba in 1997, the DVD release offers a NEW Jabba in this scene; one that looks considerably more like the Jabba the Hutt we are all familiar with. While the new CGI Jabba still doesn't seem quite as harmonious with the rest of the picture as such digital characters do in the prequels, the whole scene is still quite an impressive feat and completely welcome as far as this fan is concerned, especially with the much needed update. Though, it kinda makes my action figure of 1997 Jabba pretty pointless. In general, aside from the digital removal of one of my favorite characters, Lak Sivrak (AKA the cantina wolf-man, another of my action figures that has been made obsolete!), I have no problem with the new SPECIAL special editions of the Star Wars saga. Though, as a hardcore fan, it does seem wrong that the original versions are not ALSO available on the DVDs (Disney gives the option on THEIR special editions, after all). Each film in the classic Star Wars trilogy includes an audio commentary option. "A New Hope" features commentary by George Lucas, Carrie Fisher, Ben Burtt, and Dennis Muren. The commentaries are enjoyable, but they were clearly recorded separately, and one wishes that if they had to be recorded that way, that we could have received the complete commentaries of the individuals rather than a single compilation track. Nevertheless, a fun listen. Of course, if you want the other great extras, you'll have to get the whole trilogy set, but don't get your hopes up. The bonus disc in the Star Wars trilogy set is painfully lacking the deleted scenes of Luke and his friends on Tatooine, the 1997 Jabba scene (hey, it'd be nice for historical purposes), the classic Kenner toy commercials we grew up with, AND the infamous Star Wars Holiday Special. Then again, I guess one could come up with tons of extras that could have been included but weren't. That was just MY wish list. We'll see what future DVD rereleases bring. At least those awesome teaser trailers are included on the bonus disc. Anyway, back to the subject at hand, "Star Wars, Episode 4: A New Hope:" Still one of the best films ever made, still the same powerful experience (despite alterations), and still my favorite version of Leia!

This enhanced version contained extra scenes, alternate takes that replace the original takes, and added CGI effects.  The reaction from fans was mixed.  Some liked the added scenes and effects, while others didn't.  Myself, I had mixed feelings about it, but my way of thinking is this:  As long as the original theatrical version is still available to the public, that's the main thing.  Thankfully, it is, but I heard it was pressed from the old laserdisc version from the 1980s and hasn't been restored.  In 2004, the enhanced versions of A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, and Return Of The Jedi were included in the 4-DVD Star Wars Trilogy set (which includes the bonus material documentary DVD).  This is the set I own.  I like these enhanced movies as well as the untouched originals, especially if they would be restored one day.<br /><br />I was the perfect age to be when A New Hope came out in 1977.  I was seven, and I remember going to the theater in May 1977 to see the movie.  I remember the beginning of the movie when the star destroyer came overhead that was chasing the rebel ship.  The sound was so powerful and the special effects were so good.  I was immediately drawn into the movie.  Then a short time later, C3PO and R2D2 appeared, then the stormtroopers, then Darth Vader.  The characters blew me away.  I was fascinated with C3PO's gold costume, the Tusken Raiders, the Jawas, and Tatooine in general.  Chewbacca was also a favorite of mine, as was Han Solo.  I also liked Greedo.  My first action figure was the Tusken Raider, then C3PO.  I collected Star Wars trading cards.  I had the first set with the turquoise border, then the set with the red border, then the orange border, then the green border, and so on.  I was hooked on this stuff.  A New Hope is what started it all.  I was equally fascinated with Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back in 1980.  Back in '77 I rooted for the rebellion.  By '80 I had turned to the dark side and liked the Empire.<br /><br />While this 2004 version of A New Hope is not the original theatrical version, it does retain the same feel of the movie I saw in the theater in '77.  I must say, though, that the scene where Han Solo shoots Greedo is ridiculous.  Greedo fires at Solo from close range and MISSES and Solo barely flinches as the laser bullet goes past him and hits the wall behind him.  The scene with Jabba The Hutt by the Millennium Falcon slows down the movie somewhat, and Jabba seems too nice in the scene.  The CGI stuff that was added at Mos Eisley was too childish-looking.  It LOOKS like CGI and doesn't match the rest of the movie and really was unnecessary.  It would fit in more with The Phantom Menace.  The only exception is when the Falcon blasts out of the docking bay when stormtroopers are shooting at it.  That was a good scene.  Some of the creatures in the cantina were changed.  Example:  the werewolf was eliminated and replaced with another creature.<br /><br />Once in a while there are alternate takes used that replace the original takes.  An example is when Ben Kenobi, Luke, and the two droids are in the landspeeder and are stopped by stormtroopers at Mos Eisley.  An alternate take was used when Kenobi says, "You don't need to see his identification".  Another example is when Kenobi is talking about the cantina and says to Luke, "This place can be a little rough".<br /><br />All in all, the original theatrical version from '77 is certainly one of the greatest movies of all time.  There's an old saying - if it ain't broke, don't fix it.  The 2004 enhanced version is fine and I like it, but it really was unneccesary because Episode IV - A New Hope was a classic to begin with.  George Lucas took advantage of modern CGI technology so he could finally make the movie as he originally envisioned it to be back in the '70s.  Unfortunately, it angers some people that he tinkered with it (including myself to a certain extent).  The argument can be made that he wanted the original trilogy (Episodes IV, V, and VI) to be more like the prequels (Episodes I, II, and III).  If you ask me, I think the prequels should have been more like the original trilogy as far as their overall look and feel, and the technology in the prequels should have been either lower than the original trilogy or at most at the same level.  I do like the prequels, though.<br /><br />Even though I like these 2004 enhanced edition releases, I must say that George Lucas is not only disrespecting the fans who like the original releases and made them the massive hits they were, but he's also disrespecting the hard work of all who were involved in the making of those fine films by replacing certain scenes with either CGI or what he "originally envisioned".  For example, a lot of people worked very hard on the special effects for the X-Wings and TIE fighters blowing up during the Death Star battle.  What did Lucas do?  He replaced those explosions with CGI explosions that he felt looked better.  I think the original special effects in the original movies were awesome, especially for that time period.  It was groundbreaking.  George Lucas needs to offer untouched but restored versions of A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, and Return Of The Jedi to satisfy the fans who loved those movies and made them the classics they are, not to mention bought all the merchandise associated with the movies, such as trading cards, action figures, and Halloween costumes.<br /><br />This 2004 DVD has audio commentary by George Lucas, Carrie Fisher, Dennis Muren, and Ben Burtt as a special feature.<br /><br />I highly recommend both the untouched original theatrical version (especially if it's restored in the future) and the enhanced version of A New Hope.  The choice is yours.  Are you nostalgic or are you open-minded?</p></br><a href="../users/A36QYTMMJ0O2IZ.html">A36QYTMMJ0O2IZ</a><br/><p>Transport yourself back to 1977 when this film was first released.  I still remember the awe and incredible feeling when walking out of the theater after seeing Star Wars.  There had never truly been anything like it before.  Star Wars completely revolutionized cinematic films forever.  You could understand why suddenly hundreds and thousands of people all over the globe were standing in long lines waiting to get in to see this spectacular film.<br /><br />Every once in a while, sometimes a long while, a movie comes along that completely changes how movies are done.  They are so different, because nobody has done anything like it before.  Star Wars is such a film.  Perhaps no other film in history has had as much impact on today's culture and society that Star Wars has.  It operates on physical, philosophical, mythological, and even spiritual levels.<br /><br />"Jaws" may have set the standard for the typical summer blockbuster, but Star Wars blew the doors off, and in many ways, raised the bar dramatically for all films that would ever follow in its footsteps.<br /><br />Ironically, the story is a simple one, and George Lucas drew on many sources for his story that takes place in a galaxy far, far away.  He used old Saturday serials, Japanese samurai and mythology, as well as drawing a bit on King Arthur, and still others.  This helped to set up for one of the most incredible movies to ever grace the big screen.<br /><br />Lucas was also smart in setting up a merchandising line of toys, t-shirts, lunchboxes, etc, and sat back and watched as the millions of dollars rolled on in.<br /><br />The Empire Strikes Back is, in my opinion, the best Star Wars film of the six, but the original Star Wars is tough to beat.  How many kids dreamed of being taken away from their hum-drum life (like Luke on the farm) to suddenly find themselves immersed in a huge galactic adventure, complete with a beautiful princess to rescue, and being the hero who destroys the massive Death Star.<br /><br />We saw things that weren't really popular until Star Wars revealed them.  We saw laser blasters being used, flying spaceships that engage in dogfights in outer space, strange and exotic creatures, and one of the ultimate items, the lightsaber.  Every kid loves sword-fighting, but to do it with a laser sword is the ultimate experience.<br /><br />Take a good look at the top box office hits of all time.  9 of the top 10 movies are science fiction/fantasy films.  People love these kinds of stories.  They always have!  It doesn't matter if it's Lord of the Rings, the Lone Ranger, Spider-Man, Superman, or Star Wars.  We like be taken to a different world, a world of the fantastic.<br /><br />I loved the original version of this film.  I didn't really see the need to change it.  Granted, there are some scenes in the newer version that work really well, but somehow, it doesn't bring back the nostalgic feelings like the original version does.  I like this DVD version because it gives me the option to watch either one.  There are times when I like to watch the updated version, and yet still, there are others when I feel like watching the original.  At least Lucas gives us a choice here.<br /><br />I'm writing this review on the eve of the 30th anniversary of Star Wars, and it's still one of my all-time favorite films, because every so often, I feel like being transported again to a galaxy far, far away.</p></br><a href="../users/A2OCJNB6B46OKP.html">A2OCJNB6B46OKP</a><br/><p>The credits roll and the flagship scorlls across the screen nowadays I say to myself..."So begins the second chapter." With 'Revenge Of The Sith' marking the completion of the prequil trilogy 'Star Wars', now christened officially as 'A New Hope' makes so much more sense to me than ever before! I now know who Darth Vader is and where he came from and when he walks through the halls of the flagship for the very first time I now fear him because I truly know how evil he is.<br /><br />Darth Vader's fate now rests in the hands of three people. His old master Obi-Wan Kenobi and his twins Luke and Leia. This movie is the one that started it all back in 1977 introducing us to that Galaxy far far away. Now however everything that i see every charater, every bit of dialogue and ever planet makes so much more sense to me because of the fact the history has been told. But what makes this movie so good is the fact that the great Harrison Ford is in this film as the crafty smuggler Han Solo. Everything he says and does in this movie is just awesome. When you speak to the fans everyone's favorite scene is him pretending to be a storm trooper. I adore this movie so much more now thanks to episode 3, because after what is seen and done you just need that little bit of light back in your system. 'A New Hope' delivers on that account. Still, eventhough the rest of the story is something I can now recite with my eyes closed I now want to enjoy the rest of this story and watch what will unravel now that Luke knows he has to destory the Empire.</p></br><a href="../users/AWG2O9C42XW5G.html">AWG2O9C42XW5G</a><br/><p>This movie is awesome. this is the best one in the star wars series. i love a new hope. it's one of the greatest movies ever made. star wars is a awesome series. the special effects for it's time was outstanding. star wars is the best science fiction series ever created. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do</p></br><a href="../users/A2TLLX0ZBMZTK7.html">A2TLLX0ZBMZTK7</a><br/><p>This is truly one of the greatest movies of all time. Everyone should experience this masterpiece. It's very quotable, can't tell ya how many times my family and I sat around quoting this. The story is classic, the characters are great. I can't see anything wrong with this movie. -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare</p></br><a href="../users/AP3B615GM191G.html">AP3B615GM191G</a><br/><p>There was science fiction before Star Wars and science fiction afterwards.  The amazing thing about this film, though, is that it presents such a simple narrative.  It has drama, compelling characters, action, adventure, humor, and fantasy; every ingredient that an epic doth make.<br /><br />The storyline is classic "good vs. evil" fare.  The Empire forces, commanded by the mechanically-supported Darth Vader (voice of James Earl Jones), wreak havoc over the galaxy, but are opposed by a rebel force led by Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), and Han Solo (Harrison Ford).<br /><br />While recently watching this movie again, I identified three reasons why this simple little film sparked such a phenomenon:<br /><br />1. The storyline is just so compelling and dramatic.  A sense of something epic prevails throughout the entire production.<br /><br />2. Whereas it too preceding show Star Trek many episodes to establish a cadre of eclectic characters, Star Wars (with the likes of Chewbacca, C3PO, & R2D2) accomplishes the feat in roughly 30 minutes.<br /><br />3. The overall genre-diversity of the experience.  I recently screened the film with my 13-year old sister, and she enjoyed it as much as I did but for completely different (e.g. humorous, primarily) reasons.  Much like "Back To The Future", for example, Star Wars attracts viewers from all "walks" of film genre.<br /><br />Basically, this "first" (depending on your point of view...!) installment in the series does a great job of establishing the important characters, laying the basis for the epic plot, and just providing some basic entertainment.  Very few people will be turned off by it, as it contains seemingly something for everyone.</p></br><a href="../users/A370Z6I5GBWU44.html">A370Z6I5GBWU44</a><br/><p>The first movie in the original Star Wars trilogy, this is a solid, die-hard classic movie which was the beginning of one of the biggest franchises that the sci-fi world (or fiction in general) has ever known, and for good reason. This movie did a great job with the sci-fi aspects given that back then, computer technology was very, very, VERY limited compared to today, and yet they managed to pull it off for a great movie.</p></br><a href="../users/AQZH7YTWQPOBE.html">AQZH7YTWQPOBE</a><br/><p>I've never been quite sure why so many people are complaining about the revisions to the original version of A New Hope.

It takes a standard tale of love and war, patriotism and honor and creates something special.  Truly a sum of its parts!<br /><br />Words scan across the screen at the start, similar to the old Buck Rogers and other serials of the mid-twentieth century.  And like those films, it takes place in a universe of extraordinary technology.  But not of the future!  Of the past!  Sure, why not?  Why would there not be galaxies that are so old as to predate our own civilization, so far, far away?<br /><br />The princess of the piece, at risk of her life, sends a secret message through her droid (little robot guy, used in manufacturing and pilot control) and send them off to a desert planet, orbiting a twin star system.  In many ways, reminded me of Frank Herbert's Dune.  In fact, there is a skeleton of a Sandworm!  Coincidence?<br /><br />I won't go over the whole plot here.  If you have not yet seen Star Wars, please do.  Luke Skywalker, oblivious to his past heritage, is just a farm boy who desires someday to be a soldier, a freedom-fighter.  But alas, he will most likely be like his Uncle Owen, living on a backward planet, doing some hydroponics and maybe even play in the  Mos Isely band.  Did they ever do kareoke?<br /><br />The death of his aunt and uncle at the hands of the Empire, with the blackened corpses of his aunt and uncle (quite horrific for a PG film, actually) fires up Luke.  He desires revenge.<br /><br />So we have the plot thicken:  A force of evil, a backward boy with dreams, galavnized by the death of his only family but no place to put forward his intentions of revenge.  He meets Obi-Wan and thinks the princess is hot.  Ah, if he only knew.<br /><br />And the story goes.  George Lucas, director of such hits up to that time of the powerful THX-1138 and the hilarious American Graffiti, turned out what was in fact the turning point in science fiction cinema, just by taking a fun popcorn plot with a simple yet powerful story and creating a revolution.<br /><br />I have read other stories of corrupt empires both past and present and of the lives of men and women who fought, avenged and struck back in the name of freedom.  The Roman Empire (it's rise and fall) and Isaac Asimov's Harry Seldon in The Foundation Trilogy come to mind, and even to some extent Frank Herbert's Dune series.<br /><br />Highly recommended!</p></br><a href="../users/A239PPUVV8O0U0.html">A239PPUVV8O0U0</a><br/><p>Note- for this and the subsequent films, I will be reviewing the theatrical releases, not the re-released special editions.<br /><br />Science fiction was hugely popular in the 50s with the Jet Age and the Space Race. There were even the Flash Gordon serials earlier than that. But once the sixties hit, especially the late sixties, movie makers went with more realistic stories. I know 2001: A Space Odyssey and Star Trek were made in that time frame, but they were still along telling a more realistic (for that genre anyway) story. Then this came along! With cutting edge special effects (for the time) and an interesting story made this one of the highest grossing films in  history. And also influenced the people behind the Bond films (FYEO was supposed to be after TSWLM but due to the popularity of this, was pushed back and MR was filmed instead.) and the people behind Star Trek (though two totally different things, this did influence them to change the Phase Two TV project into the first film).<br /><br />That's enough backstory. The acting is better than what we'd get in episodes 2 and 3 (especially from Hayden Christensen). Mark Hamill, better known today as the voice of the Joker on the various DCAU projects, plays Luke Skywalker with innocence and sincerity as we see the young hero thrust from his average lifestyle into the battle to save the galaxy. Harrison Ford plays Han Solo with a cockiness yet is the rogue with a heart of gold (I think he was just warming up for Indiana Jones). Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia, I think though I maybe wrong, is the first female movie character during the women's libs of the seventies to be able to take charge of a situation (like during the rescue in the prison cell) and hold her own in a gun fight. Darth Vader (suit actor David Prowse and voiced by James Earl Jones) is one of the more intimidating villains in cinema history and just as formidable in a lightsaber duel and a dog fight in space. Along with Tarkin, played by an impressive Peter Cushing, is almost as cold as Vader himself (since Tarkin is pretty much ordering Vader around in this), especially when he threatens Leia to blow up Alderaan. And lastly, Alec Guinness plays Obi-Wan Kenobi as a gentle, caring teacher to Luke though an old man, can still be pretty formidable in a fight. And the only human character who actually retains any dignity with his portrayal in the recent films. Again the incomprable John Williams is at the conductor's position, with another rousing score of action and suspense, though this is when his movie scores started to share some similar cues (most, if not all his scores are done by the London Symphony Orchestra).<br /><br />Now I will say that I saw the Special Editions before I saw the original prints and I did enjoy them. But after seeing the original release (though it should've recieved the same treatment that the other editions got), I will say that it is the superior version. Lucas needs to stop "improving" his movies and leave them the way they are (like his Young Indiana Jones series, I heard they filmed new stuff and removed whole episodes from continuity). He totally dishonors all the work that went into these original productions and only does it so he can re-release it on whatever video format and make a profit. I don't think he cares so much for the most popular film in his vault.</p></br><a href="../users/A3OXHLG6DIBRW8.html">A3OXHLG6DIBRW8</a><br/><p>To me, "Star Wars Episode IV" is Star Wars.

George Lucas drew on timeless archetypes (thanks to his friendship with mythologist Joseph Campbell) to make an adventure for the ages. "Star Wars" has an outwardly simple story. Luke Skywalker,an orphan growing up on Tatooine with his aunt&uncle,wants to leave his homeworld and explore the cosmos. His grizzled mentor, Obi-Wan Kenobi,leads him into an unexpected adventure. Little does Luke know what's in store for him. On the way,he meets up with the witty robots C3PO and R2D2,as well as the handsome smuggler Han Solo. Luke learns the ways of the Force, goes to rescue Princess Leia... and the rest is cinematic history.<br /><br />"Star Wars" succeeds not just because of its simple story (Lucas was daring in having it be in media res as "Episode Four") and astounding special effects,but because of its talented actors. Alec Guinness achieved cinematic immortality as Luke's cranky mentor. Carrie Fisher is spunky as Princess Leia. Peter Cushing is appropriately menacing as the Grand Moff Tarkin. James Earl Jones voices Darth Vader,giving him a diabolical screen presence. Finally, Harrison Ford is appealing as the swaggering,sexy anti-hero/heroic smuggler Han Solo. Needless to say,Han Solo was my first screen crush. Unfortunately,the original Star Wars trilogy is all about Luke's Hero's Journey,and Han is a supporting character. No director's cut can make the trilogy All About How Han Saved the Universe and Won Princess Leia's Heart.<br /><br />"Star Wars" has staying power.

But by the time director George Lucas put them out on DVD, he had redone the trilogy with new special effects and inserted scenes.<br /><br />Buuuuut... that's not what the fans have wanted. They wanted the unadulterated original. And until the end of December, a special two-disc edition of the classic, groundbreaking "Star Wars IV - A New Hope" will be available, with both the theatrical and the new versions. Fortunately, it doesn't seem to cost any more than a one-disc DVD.<br /><br />Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) is bored and frustrated on his uncle's moisture farm. That all changes when his uncle buys two new droids, C3P0 and R2D2 (Anthony Daniels and Kenny Baker), the second of which leads Luke to the eccentric old Ben Kenobi (Sir Alec Guiness) -- and a transmission of a beautiful princess (Carrie Fisher) asking for Kenobi's help.<br /><br />At first, Luke doesn't plan to go, since he still has to help his uncle with the harvest. But when he returns home to find his uncle and aunt murdered by Imperial stormtroopers, he agrees to come with Kenobi and help rescue the princess -- and train to become a Jedi knight, "like my father." But to rescue the princess, he and his new friends will venture into the heart of the planet-destroying Death Star, and have to deal with the evil Darth Vader...<br /><br />Lucas's movie was a groundbreaking moment in cinematic history -- nobody had ever done special effects or science fiction like this before, and it made the mold for future stories with battleships, evil overlords and distant planet. What was better, it was spiced up with influences from Akira Kurosawa to J.R.R. Tolkien, and sprinkled with some Eastern philosophy for "the Force."<br /><br />This was also the biggest role for the three stars Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford, as the naive young farmboy-turned-hero, the feisty princess, and the jaded outlaw. They all did very solid jobs, even with the most awkward bits of dialogue, as they run around the slick, claustrophobic Death Star and the slightly run-down Millennium Falcon.<br /><br />What's the difference between the two versions? Plenty, actually. Many of the scenes just have a CGI character or two wandering around, or a ship swooping down over a control tower. But some scenes were never in the original at all (stormtroopers scouting in the desert), and others were cut, redone and put back in again (like Han's nasty encounter with Jabba in the hangar).<br /><br />Some of these changes are good, some are bad. The best ones are the insertion of tiny moving pilots into the X-wings. But it's worth sacrificing that to have the original bar scene back, as it was in 1977: The original featured Han talking to a bounty hunter, and then shooting him under the table; the remastered one has a very fake-looking shot of the hunter shooting first... and missing.<br /><br />Is it actually bad? Not really; the dramatic punch of scenes like the approach of the Millennium Falcon or the victory over the Death Star are still unmarred. But it feels like it's been slicked down until it loses the raw, groundbreaking appeal that the original had. It's a credit to the theatrical version that this many years later, people still want to see it in its original glory, dated special-effects or not.<br /><br />Fans of both versions of "A New Hope" will find them in this two-disc edition, and those who just want the theatrical can switch it to a single box. Either way, it's certainly worth the money.</p></br><a href="../users/A3IDMLOWLHWNDJ.html">A3IDMLOWLHWNDJ</a><br/><p>"I want to learn the ways of "The Force" & become a Jedi, like my father."<br /><br />"The circle is now complete. When I left you, I was, but, the learner. Now I am The Master."<br /><br />"You can't win Darth. If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine."<br /><br />"Remember, "The Force" will be with you..., always."<br /><br />- Luke Skywalker yearns to learn the family business, Darth Vader tells Obi-Wan Kenobi he's no square, but, Obi-Wan tells his former apprentice he, once again, has the high ground & spiritually tells Luke to keep the faith in "Star Wars"<br /><br />Released 29 & a 1/2 years ago, in less than 32 theaters nationwide (compared to "Revenge Of The Sith"'s 3600+ theaters), "Star Wars" still remains one of the great all time science fiction films, that is a tribute to the Flash Gordon, Buck Rogers, & Western serials of the past. "Star Wars" gave the dying sci-fi genre a much needed jolt in the arm, in the late 70's & has generated millions of fans the world over. The film, after all these years, still remains one of the highest grossing films in history (currently at 450+ million dollars).<br /><br />Taking place roughly twenty years after "Episode III: Revenge Of The Sith", "Star Wars" (renamed "Epiosde IV: A New Hope" in 1999, after the release of the first prequel film) has the galaxy under the grip of the tyrannical Galactic Empire (the former Republic from the prequel films).<br /><br />The Empire's ultimate weapon, The Death Star (shown in a skelatal structure at the end of "Sith") has come to fruition & spells certain doom for the small band of rebels trying to restore freedom to the galaxy.<br /><br />Princess Leia, senator of the planet Alderaan, races home aboard her starship after stealing schematic plans to the battle station. Imperial forces, led by Darth Vader, intercept the ship, take Leia hostage, & destroy the ship, but, not before the Princess records a short message to Genaral Obi-Wan Kenobi & downloads the message with the valuable, stolen Death Star plans into a nearby astromech droid. As fate would have it, Artoo-Detoo is the recipient & with his companion See-Threepio use an escape pod to get off the ship blasting to the planet of Tatooine below.<br /><br />Once on the surface, & through some unusual circumstances, the droids fall into the hands of Owen Lars, & his step-nephew, Luke Skywalker. While cleaning up the two droids, Luke accidently stumbles across the ending of the message Artoo was trying to keep hidden ("Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. Your my only hope").<br /><br />Luke tells his Uncle about the message & in response wants both droids memory's erased (it must have dawned on Owen that both droids have been here before & he knows the history surrounding them). Luke also asks if he can join the Academy (most of his friends have already gone), but, his Uncle also nixes that idea (as Luke leaves the dinner table, in a huff, Owens wife, Beru, tells him that Luke has to much of his father's spirit in him. Owen's reply, "That's what I'm afraid of.").<br /><br />But, Artoo has other plans. Insistent on delivering the message to Obi-Wan, Artoo ditches Threepio, while Luke & his family are at dinner, & goes searching for the Jedi Knight himself. Upon this discovery, Luke sets out early the following morning, with Threepio, & unknowingly sets his destiny to become a Jedi Knight into motion.<br /><br />"Star Wars" is the first film to be released, but, is Episode IV, chronilogically in the overall saga. Thanks to the monsterous success of this film, the rest of the saga was a go. "Star Wars" was first created as a stand alone film (in case it flopped at the box-office). With its first re-release, the film then had the "Episode IV, A New Hope" moniker attached to the opening prologue. Nominated for 11 Oscars (winner of 8).<br /><br />Over the past 28 years:<br /><br />"Star Wars" has been re-released 7 times (including the Special Edition release) in theaters, & released on video 7 times (including the 2004 DVD release, a repricing in the late 80's, & a repackage (very badly) in the early 90's ). I've seen a very early rental copy of "Star Wars", with a plastic clamshell box that says "for rental only" at the bottom of the box from 1983, go for sale on e-bay, a few years back, for roughly 250 to 300 bucks. Thats a rarity.<br /><br />Differences over the years:<br /><br />The film had different audio tracks according to the film's format in theatre's (two types of formats were used in the original release, 35 mm & 70 mm. The 35 mm tracks were recorded first for national distribution while the 70 mm tracks were recorded for special releases. Rumor has it that these tracks weren't finished until the morning of the film's release).<br /><br />In 1997, the original trilogy was released in theatres as Special Edition's. the negative for "Star Wars" was cleaned up with a few new scenes added among them:<br /><br />The Stormtrooper squad that finds the droids escape pod is a lot bigger than in the original release. Overall, nice effect that either way doesn't kill the film.<br /><br />Mos Eisley spaceport gets a big redo. Instead of the hole in the ground from the original release, here its a big spaceport complete with ships taking off & all sorts of new scum & villainy walking the streets. Overall, this was always Lucas' vision, but, again, due to time & budget back in the day he had to make due with what he had. Still, he didn't need to take out the werewolf creature from the cantina.<br /><br />During the confrontation between Greedo & Han Solo, Greedo shoots first while the original shot of Solo firing is now a retaliation shot. The most absolute damning thing George Lucas has done to the moviegoing public (that includes "Howard The Duck"). This basiclaly destroys some of Han Solo's character. This guy doesn't take s*it from anybody. But, with the tinkering of this shot, its now just in self-defense. It sucks anyway you look at it.<br /><br />Jabba The Hutt makes an appearance (he was originally supposed to be in the film, but, due to budget & money constraints in 1976, he could never be fully realized). A fully grown Boba Fett is also present in the background setting up his bigger role in "Empire". Overall, cool effect & the scene was always meant to be there. But, Jabba looks a bit odd & doesn't look like the Jabba from "Return Of The Jedi".<br /><br />Han Solo is chased by battalions of Stormtrooopers instead of five. Overall, funny effect, but, so was the original.<br /><br />Certain dogfight scenes were replaced with CGI substitues to make the battle's more tight & fast. Overall, needed in spots & the battle is now more of a grand scale assault.<br /><br />A new scene between Luke & his friend Biggs Darklighter has been added before the space battle at the climax of the film. Note: a line about Luke's father is cut. As Red Leader is about to speak to Luke & Biggs a crewman walks in front of the camera with Red Leader, saying "You'll do all right." The correct line is "If your as good a pilot as your father was, You'll do all right." Overall, nice scene that lets the viewer in on a little bit of the friendship between Luke & Biggs before his death.<br /><br />For the 2004 DVD release:<br /><br />A new Jabba The Hutt takes the place of the old. Overall, needed. The new Jabba looks more like the "Jedi" Jabba, and is better for it.<br /><br />A 27 year old film gaffe is finally fixed. If you have an old VHS copy of the film, fast forward to the scene where just after Darth Vader cuts down Obi-Wan Kenobi, notice when the big metal doors close, take a careful notice to the color of Vader's lightsabre. Its rotoscope white, not the trademark red. That has finally been fixed. The other gaffe's haven't.<br /><br />The audio seems a bit off. Whenever Vader speaks, his breathing takes a backseat while his voice is less synthsizory & has more tamber to it. John Williams' classic score is less booming in some scenes & I find that a real problem.<br /><br />As for this third release for "Star Wars", Fox & Lucasfilm have included the original 1977 release as bonus disc material for the second disc.<br /><br />Video: the transfer is from the 1993 laserdisc transfer for The Definitive Editon box set. Scope ratio 2.35:1 & the transfer isn't that bad. There is grain (I expected that) & some dirt, but the image is quite sharp (I've seen worse on one of the early VHS releases to "Star Wars"). The color rendition is a lot better than the sickly color hue from the 2004 edition.<br /><br />Audio: 2.0 Dolby Digital. There is a strong prescence from the front speakers while the surrounds emphasize John Williams' legendary score.<br /><br />In all honesty, this isn't a half bad release, but, this isn't the final release to "Star Wars" on video. With the 30th anniversary to the original "Star Wars" looming on the horizen one wonders what the future holds for the "Star Wars" saga.</p></br><a href="../users/A1G9FX1KV45N41.html">A1G9FX1KV45N41</a><br/><p>This is the great original Star Wars, the 1977 movie in which the world first discovered the allure of The Force and the Jedi Knights. Young Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) teams up with Jedi veteran Ben Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness) and the mercenary Han Solo (Harrison Ford) to rescue the gorgeous Princess Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) from the sinister clutches of Darth Vader and the evil empire.<br />High space adventure, with creatures like Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) and the delightful R2-D2  (Kenny Baker).<br />With the final Star Wars (but will it be the final?) set for release later this year , the original trilogy is a great buy to refresh your memory.<p>A momentous battle between good and evil. With the empire perhaps at the time representing the evil Soviet Empire, which the free world was then fighting against for freedom in 1977. It has that wonderful 1970&#65533;s feel, and who would not want to rescue the sexy huggable Princess Leia.<br />In my opinion this great original one is the best of the lot.</p></br><a href="../users/A1A87TUBBDPMF0.html">A1A87TUBBDPMF0</a><br/><p>It's been over a quarter century since George Lucas (THX 1138, American Grafitti) first shared Star Wars with millions of awestruck moviegoers in the late spring of 1977.  Both the director and the studio executives at 20th Century Fox thought they'd have a modestly successful sci-fi/fantasy film with &quot;just okay&quot; box office receipts.  Instead, bucking their logic and lowered expectations, Star Wars became not only the biggest hit of its time, but it also launched both a multi-movie series and a huge merchandising/multimedia &quot;empire&quot; that made millions for the shy, unassuming USC film school graduate from Modesto, California.<p>Star Wars (later renamed Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope) begins with one of the most stunning opening scenes in movie history: After the 20th Century Fox Fanfare and a moment of silence for the &quot;a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away&quot; card, the Star Wars logo appears with the opening chord of composer John Williams' now famous &quot;Main Theme&quot; -- which serves as accompaniment to a title crawl that sets the stage for a battle between good and evil.  &quot;It is a period of civil war,&quot; and Rebels have united to challenge the evil Galactic Empire.  From a hidden base in the Outer Rim, the Rebel fleet has won its first victory against Imperial forces.  In the heat of battle, Rebel agents have discovered the secret plans for the Death Star, a huge space station with a planet-killing superlaser.  Now those plans are in the hands of Princess Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher), and her starship carries her back to her home world of Alderaan with a huge Imperial Star Destroyer in hot pursuit.<p>It is the very climax of this pursuit that starts Star Wars: A New Hope with that indelible first scene of a small Rebel blockade runner being pursued by the huge wedge shaped Star Destroyer.  The Blockade Runner is tractored into the Star Destroyer's ventral docking bay, and after a short and furious battle, Imperial troops led by Lord Darth Vader (David Prowse, voice by James Earl Jones) overrun the ship's defenses and capture Princess Leia.<p>But wait! Just as the battle is ending, C-3PO and R2-D2, a pair of droids who are a comedic pair along the lines of Laurel and Hardy, have evaded capture and left the captured Rebel ship aboard a small escape pod.  Below them lies the desert planet Tatooine, with its twin suns, small farming settlements, and two persons whose destiny was inextricably linked decades before.<p>The first of these two that the droids will encounter is young moisture farmer Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), a restless teenager who yearns for adventure and excitement beyond the confines of his Uncle Owen's (Phil Brown) struggling farm. With good mechanical skills (he modified his landspeeder on his own) and natural flying skills, Luke wants to follow his friend Biggs and enter the Imperial Space Academy.  But Owen and his wife Beru (the late Sheelagh Fraser) fear that Luke's dreams are much too dangerous, and Owen does everything possible to stall his nephew's ambitions. At first glance, one might think Owen is just a stubborn man, but when Beru points out that &quot;Luke's just not a farmer, Owen. He has too much of his father in him,&quot; his earnest gaze and simple reply (&quot;That's what I'm afraid of.&quot;) hint at things yet to come.<p>The other person of great import to the struggle between Empire and Rebellion is Ben Kenobi  (Alec Guinness), an old hermit who lives beyond the Western Dune Sea.  Considered by the locals to be a &quot;crazy old wizard,&quot; he keeps to himself in a spartan hut carved into the face of a cliff. But looks can be deceiving, for as Luke discovers when &quot;Ben&quot; rescues him from a band of Tusken Raiders, Kenobi was once the legendary Jedi Knight and General Obi-Wan Kenobi.<p>When Obi-Wan hands him an old lightsaber, Luke also discovers that his father had not really been a navigator on a space freighter, but had fought alongside Kenobi in the Clone Wars as a Jedi Knight.  &quot;A cunning warrior&quot; and &quot;the best starpilot in the galaxy,&quot; Skywalker the elder had been betrayed and murdered by a young former pupil of Obi-Wan's named Darth Vader.  <p>After watching a holorecording of Princess Leia's plea for help, Kenobi then attempts to enlist Luke to take the droids to Alderaan with secret plans vital to the Rebellion, Luke hesitates. He wants to leave Tatooine, yes, but he feels an obligation to his aunt and uncle.<p>Alas, the long arm of the Empire has reached Owen and Beru first. Having tracked the robots to the jawas who had sold them to Luke's guardians, stormtroopers have slain the couple and orphaned Luke.  Now, fate -- or the Force -- has taken a hand, and Luke Skywalker vows that he  wants to learn the ways of the Force and become a Jedi.<p>Star Wars' second half, starting with the fateful meeting in the now famous Mos Eisley cantina with Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and culminating with the climactic space battle over the Death Star, is a fast-paced chain of cliffhangers intended to be an homage to the cheesy-but-thrilling movie serials of the Thirties and Forties.  Will the Rebels get past the detention cell? Will the droids stop the trash compactor in time? Will Darth Vader face off against his former Master? Will Han Solo and Chewbacca go off to pay Jabba the Hutt, or will they save Luke during the last attack run down the Death Star trench?<p>Lucas' clever mix of various movie genres (Westerns, gangster films, sword-and-sorcery, and war movies), his pioneering advances in special effects, and John Williams' Academy Award-winning score are just a few reasons why movie audiences embraced Star Wars in such a manner that it became a part of American culture.  It's not perfect and it's hokey, yes, but it allowed many of us to forget (for two hours, anyway) all the troubles of the world.</p></br><a href="../users/A33XHXRTRZOQ12.html">A33XHXRTRZOQ12</a><br/><p>There's nothing for me here! I want to learn the ways of the Force and become a Jedi, like my father!" Perhaps the best line ever uttered in a sci-fi movie. What can I say? This is one of the top five best movies ever produced, and the second best in the sci-fi genre, nipping at the heels of its paterfamilias, "2001: A Space Odyssey", without which it would have probably looked quite different than it did.<br /><br />How Lucas came from "American Graffiti" to this monster is a mystery. Though his love for sci-fi was quite evident in his first movie, "THX-1138", where did he get 1) The filmmaking acumen, 2) the money, 3) the technically adept people to pull "New Hope" off? This alone had to be a feat unequalled since Kubrick got together with Arthur C. Clarke and Douglas Trumbull to make "2001".<br /><br />"New Hope" had that magic touch that had you rooting for the heroes at every turn, predisposing you to this by painting the Empire as the very embodiment of evil....destroying Luke's home and BURNING Beru and Owen, blowing up Leia's homeworld and killing Obi Wan. By doing this, you cannot HELP but cheer as Luke and his rebel friends destroy Death Star in the climactic scene. You also can't help but chuckle at characters like Princess Leia, Han Solo and R2D2. Personally, I could have lived without C3PO in ALL the SW movies!, but he's present here too as the prissy opposite number to the much more useful R2.<br /><br />Watch all three first trilogy movies...and you'll notice a DISTINCT change in the actors playing Luke and Leia. Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher just BARELY resemble their "New Hope" selves in the succeeding movies! Mark Hamill's entire face seems to change from one with an aqualine nose and sun bleached blond hair to one with a pug nose, a much meaner mien to the entire face, and sandy BROWN hair. Carries Fisher's whole face goes from being round and pudgy to being elongated and gaunt, though she still pretty much resembles the "New Hope" Leia. Her voice, however, changes completely, going from tomboyish but still feminine in "New Hope", to being raspy and whiskey-soaked by "Jedi".<br /><br />All in all, this is the one that sets the pace for the others, and is STILL the best one as far as pathos and pure edge-of-your-seat drama: The destruction of Luke's farm and the murder of his guardian Aunt and Uncle; the destruction of Alderaan by Grand Muff Tarkin; the trash-compactor scene; the rebel pilots being picked off one by one by the Empire fighters during the Death Star run by Luke's friends. The last minute save by Han Solo...this film couldn't have been a more perfect matinee entertainment if it tried!<br /><br />Special mention has to be made of Sir Alec Guiness and Peter Cushing, especially Cushing, who gave perhaps his best film performance ever in this film as the supremely evil Tarkin. The sad thing connected with this film is the lackluster career Mark Hamill has had since "Jedi". Though he was, hands-down, the star of what was for quite some time the most popular film ever, he couldn't give himself away by the mid-eighties.<br /><br />The fickle fortunes of Hollywood, I ask you.....</p></br><a href="../users/A2INL3AYAT6325.html">A2INL3AYAT6325</a><br/><p>What can you say about the movies that started it all.  I've been a Star Wars fan &amp; collector for 20 years now.  This is where we REALLY first learned about Harrison.  Forever the movie to compare others to, not some  nudity boat movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3BSS2M2DPPV4T.html">A3BSS2M2DPPV4T</a><br/><p>A young hero, a captured princess, a hot-shot pilot, cute robots, a vile villain and a heroic and mystrerious Jedi knight blend together with marvelous special effects in a fantasy tale about rebel forces engaged in a life or death struggle with the tyrannical leaders of the Galactic Empire. One of the biggest blockbusters of all time, this movie set a new cinematic standard for realistic special effects; making many pre-STAR WARS effects seem almost laughable in retrospect.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AUECYM0M0YSX.html">A3AUECYM0M0YSX</a><br/><p>I'm not going to bother to review the movie.  Unless you've been living on Tattooine for the last quarter century--and maybe even if you have--you've seen it.  But here is the Special Edition: were the improvements worth it?<br /><br />Yes.  And no.  Specifically, they fixed up parts of the final battle that needed fixing, for although the special effects team labored heroically in 1977 some shots were just beyond them.  There are moments where a fighter pilot cries "He's on my tail! I can't shake him!" and in the old version we'd cut to an exterior shot of ships moving slowly and awkwardly.  Here the ships dart about dramatically.  Some of the explosions have been enhanced, and the early shots of the many ships flying in formation look much better.  The whole battle feels bigger.  No matter how you slice it, this part of the film is an improvement.<br /><br />But for the rest of the movie, I have doubts.  Do we really need to meet Jabba here?  It does nothing but steal thunder from the opening of "Jedi," and it adds nothing to the plot we don't already know.  And the scene with Biggs is so awkward it's amazing George could stand to put it back in.  Also, introducing a new character 80 percent of the way through a movie has much of the audience scratching their head and saying, "Who's that guy?  Did we miss something?"<br /><br />The new footage in the desert (of the troopers riding the big beast creatures) undermines the elegant understatedness with which Lucas shot the first version--just two masterful shots with minimal movement originally, yet it suggested so much.  Now we see these CG beasts walk back and forth as the camera pans this way and that--why, other than to say "Yippee, I can do it"?<br /><br />The same is true for showing where the Falcon was as it blasted its way out of the cantina.  Before we never got a sense of where it was coming *from* as it rose up into the air, so we shared the Imperials' same sense of disorientation and surprise as the good guys escaped.  Now we see everything.  But it's not a better film because of it.<br /><br />And the huge flaming "rings" that we see when both Alderaan and the Death Star blow up are idiotic.  Those moments were spectacular enough already and George didn't need to fiddle.  Lucas used to say a special effect for no reason was a boring thing.  He should revisit his own wisdom.<br /><br />In short, I'd like to have the new final battle (sans the flaming "rings" at the end) tacked onto the original version of the rest of the film.  That would be a perfect "New Hope."  And one spectacular shot--the Falcon flying underneath a dramatic red moon as Han returns Princess Leia to her base--has been inexplicably cut.<br /><br />(Postscript: Apparently there has been even more tinkering on the DVD.  From what I've heard, it sounds like a four-star movie is now a three-star movie.  What's next?  Jar-Jar popping out of R2D2 and doing a dance?  Hey George, how's about getting some new ideas instead of milking the old ones to death?)</p></br><a href="../users/AHCVWPLA1O4X8.html">AHCVWPLA1O4X8</a><br/><p>I love the original Star Wars movies.  I owned them on the original VHS release.  When Lucasfilms released the trilogy on VHS in the `special' THX format I was more than happy to oblige, and bought the entire trilogy.  Then came the special extended versions of the movies-great!  I saw those in theaters and rushed to buy them when they came out on VHS.  I missed the Laserdisc version and didn't buy anything else on VHS, but then came the DVD release of the trilogy (the extended versions of the film).  Hey, I thought, I already own these movies in 3, yes 3, versions.  But what the heck-Lucas and co. are saying they'll never release the original versions of the film on DVD anyway, so why not make it 4?<br /><br /> Now we're looking at yet another release of the films.  This is promised to be a "Limited Edition," which probably means it will only be out until demand subsides and they can release another version.  If this were a new Dolby or Hi Def release of the original movies I may consider them, but its not.  It's a rehashed release of the Laserdisc version of the films from 13 or so years ago, hideously outdated and ignorant of the technological advantages of DVD.  I'm not going to bite on this release-I've had enough for the time being.<br /><br /> When (and to me it's a question of when, not if) Lucas finally decides to put forth a bit of effort and release Episodes IV-VI in a format that's not 15 years outdated I'll buy, though by this point I feel I shouldn't.  But I see no reason to buy this release.  Before the first DVD version came out Lucas said he wouldn't release the original films on DVD until after Episode 3-that turned out to be a lie.  Then he said he'd never release the original theatricals on DVD-that, too has proved untrue.  I'm fairly certain that we'll get a new version of the theatrical releases soon, maybe one that will be worth owning.  Until then I can be patient-Lucas is apparently so willing to bleed his die-hard fans dry that the only true "definitive" release of the films will be the one Lucas does right before he, himself, passes on.  Only then will these poor, tired classics get a rest.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AUECYM0M0YSX.html">A3AUECYM0M0YSX</a><br/><p>The more I think about it, the more I think this would have been the perfect ending for Star Wars:<br /><br />Luke is charging down the Death Star trench, Vader on his tail. His droid has already had its lid blown off, and the same is about to happen to Luke if someone doesn't step in and save him. "I have you now!" says Vader. At that exact moment, his right wing-man erupts into flame. Vader looks around, puzzled. "Yeee-hah!" comes the voice of Han Solo. "Look out!" cries Vader's other wingman, just before exploding as well. Then Vader is struck by a laser bolt, and his ship incinerates. Luke fires at the Death Star and zips out of the trench, the battle station explodes, and the Empire is soundly defeated forever. THE END.<br /><br />No sequels. No second trilogy thirty years later. No mass merchandizing that has gone on for two generations. Instead George Lucas went on to make other movies. About *anything* else.<br /><br />Imagine that. If Star Wars had just been seen for what it was, namely a fun, escapist, very clever movie, and the world had moved on, cinema might still be for adults. People might be able to sit still for more than two minutes of exposition. Every other scene in a film wouldn't need digital effects and thudding, blaring THX sound. Just maybe.<br /><br />Because--lets spit up the Kool Aid and face facts here--there was never any need for sequels. The subsequent films didn't say anything the first one didn't, and the first one didn't say very much. Lucas once stated after Star Wars that he planned a series of 12 films all along. Then it became nine. Then six. The main message I took away from the first film was that despotism sucks, freedom is great and you have to be responsible for, and mindful of, your own actions. And that's about the whole point of all of it.<br /><br />How anyone could think Star Wars was any more profound than that is beyond me. But suddenly people who'd never picked up a philosophy text in their lives and didn't know how to pronounce Socrates began talking about the deep philosophical implications of the Force. (Oh, please.) People began telling Lucas he was channeling deep insights from Joseph Campbell. Joseph Campbell himself was one of the people who said that, but for the life of me, before Return of the Jedi, before the Lucas publicity machine began manufacturing the legend of their boss, I never heard a peep about Lucas being influenced by Campbell *while he was writing the first films.* Go read anything on George that predates 1983 if you don't believe me. If you find something from before then, post the link here. (An original source, not a cite from later.) Dale Pollack's excellent biography of Lucas, while not perhaps definitive, would probably not neglect such an important fact. On the extensive liner notes to the original soundtrack to Star Wars, some of them written by Lucas himself, he cites a variety of inspirations, but Mr. Campbell is not named. He concludes by saying "It's fun--that's the word for this movie." And indeed it is.<br /><br />But somewhere along the way in the desert, Lucas got the idea that he was a prophet. And there was such profit in being a prophet that no one dared tell him otherwise. They didn't have the nerve to say, "George, it's cowboys and indians in outer space, not profound and holy Scripture." So Scripture it became. And ink was spilled over the meaning of this and that insipid line. Was Obi-Wan's explanation for why he said Luke's father was "dead" lame? Noooo, there were all sorts of creative rationalizations. People with PhDs bought into this [...]. To a few of us, Lucas was naked rather than wearing Jedi robes, but we were and are the minority.<br /><br />I've heard countless times that Star Wars influenced a generation of filmmakers. Indeed it has. It's a tragedy, something we'll pay for artistically for decades to come. Thanks at least partly to Lucas, movies like Armageddon, Pearl Harbor, and Independence Day are taken semi-seriously, instead of being laughed off the screen by insulted audiences. And today's generation is so deaf and dumb to good scriptwriting that they hand Oscars to Titanic and Gladiator. More than that, much of the sophisticated--emotional and aesthetic--that film had picked up through the 60s and 70s as it matured into a serious artform has been abandoned for marketable simplicity. Though Lucas is not solely to blame for all this, he is the genesis. I can think of no better reason for why scripts became retarded and characters turned dumb than his influence on the next wave of "auteurs," people who grew up watching nothing more than Saturday afternoon serials, as if that were a *good* thing, as Lucas seems to think. For all his talk about how the special effects aren't important and story is everything, what does he spend all his time with? Has he gone on to found acting schools or sound and visual effects companies? Do we remember Star Wars for the THX sounds or for Carrie Fisher's richly-textured performance as Leia?<br /><br />One of Lucas' "messages" in Star Wars is that you have to leave home, depart from what is familiar to grow and realize your potential. Yet Lucas himself has never strayed far from his familiar Star Wars universe. His two forays into other movie realms, Howard The Duck and More American Graffiti, were huge bombs. When he resurrected Star Wars in 1997, he was able to patch up the creaky visuals, but the creaky performances couldn't be mended by computer wizardry. That requires something technology can't provide: insight into the human condition. You'll never find it in a Lucas film past perhaps American Graffiti, unless "faster and more intense" is part of the human condition. In spite of the anti-technology preachiness about the Force, Lucas hides behind technology, the way Charles Foster Kane hid in his castle at Xanadu. Twenty-five years did nothing to make him grow. You have to leave the farm, George.<br /><br />So here we have, once again, for the umpteenth time, Star Wars. This time a new 2004 (I think) version sits next to the original 1977 film. Despite some definite improvements in the Death Star attack thanks to computer enhancement, overall I prefer the 1977 film, for a few reasons. One, the stupid Biggs subplot didn't need to be restored. It just confuses the audience. If Lucas knew as much about storytelling as he claims, he'd understand that by that point the audiences' mind is on the fate of the existing characters in the light of the battle to come, and not on meeting new people who go on to do nothing. Two, the added effects on Tattooine, with the shuttle craft in the background and the extra beasts being ridden by stormtroopers, is not only not needed, it ruins the beautiful economy of the original shot, which was a masterpiece of economy and slight-of-hand. Three, the expanded spaceport is superfluous, the "comic bits" where one robot fights with another about as "funny" as Jar-Jar. Four, what is the meaning of those "rings" around the explosions of the Death Star and the planet?<br /><br />And five, the scene at the supper table with Aunt Beru and Uncle Owen, probably the most amateurishly-filmed scene I've ever seen in any big-screen movie, is still there. No digital manipulation can make it play any better.<br /><br />It's clear where Lucas' heart is in this set. The DVD of the 2004 release is beautifully presented and anamorphic. Except for Mark Hamill's Parker Stevenson haircut, it looks like it could have been filmed yesterday. In particular, Lucas has removed much of the golden "glow" in the Tattooine sequences that he added (to cover the digital manipulation perhaps?) in 1997. The DVD of the 1977 version, on the other hand, is non-anamorphic and looks bad. How bad it looks will depend on your viewing equipment--an HDTV will really reveal all the flaws in their glory (the stars in particular look bad), but if you have an upconverting DVD player that helps *somewhat.*  No one is saying they didn't want the 1977 version cleaned up and enhanced sonically--Criterion does this all the time without damaging the integrity of the original, and Lucas knows this. He knows people will buy it anyway. And he's right.<br /><br />Some interesting points: much has been made among geek fans of the fact that after Vader slashes Kenobi, they forgot to rotoscope his light saber in a couple shots and it is white instead of tinted.  Even with this latest redo, it's still unfixed.<br /><br />After watching the 2004 version and the 1977 version back-to-back, I found the pacing of the original smarter.  Jabba, the extra Mos Eisley crap, and the Biggs scene all slow the story down painfully.  Particularly after Luke's guardians are killed and the exposition is essentially over, what made Star Wars work, I now remember from my first viewing, was that breathless quality to the cutting.  The restored scenes slow it down.<br /><br />And the extra credits in the revised versions means they had to reloop part of the closing music.  In the original, the end title music as composed by John Williams was a perfect rondo.  Now it's adulterated.  Alas, it's something many people won't notice or care about, but it bugs me.</p></br><a href="../users/AXOS8IWBXNZGT.html">AXOS8IWBXNZGT</a><br/><p>Too much of a Star Wars geek, methinks... In the original Star Wars, right after Obiwan's death, Darth Vader can be seen wandering around with his lightsaber...except it wasn't coloured red, because they'd forgotten to colour it in. In the Special Edition, back in 1997, I had expected this fixed, but they somehow had time to add in all sorts of special things, but not to fix this bug. Well, finally, on the new Star Wars DVD, its finally fixed.</p></br><a href="../users/AWSYTZ2I2MW0V.html">AWSYTZ2I2MW0V</a><br/><p>The first STAR WARS most be one of the most remarkable moments of the WORLD!!!!

I rated it then as I do now an unconditional five stars.  I can't comment on the transfer quality of this particular DVD release as I own so many copies of this episode on RCA video disk, VHS tape, Pioneer Laser Disk and various issues of DVD that I get them mixed up.<br /><br />My ultimate STAR WARS-A NEW HOPE experience was my original screening in a great sound and extra large screen theater in CT in 1977. We simply were just not accustomed to that kind of sci-fi in 1977. It was as new and exciting a film as 2001 was in the late 60's. Shortly after seeing LOGAN'S RUN with my wife and being terrribly dissapointed with that film we went to see STAR WARS at the same theater. When we saw the opening of STAR WARS and the Imperial ship went overhead, my wife said "You can close your mouth now!", which just about sums it up.<br /><br />My second best STAR WARS-A NEW HOPE film experience was when I had the opportunity to screen an excellent 16 mm copy in a private theater in scope and beautiful color. It too was grand. I hope to purchase a HD-DVD or BLUE RAY copy of this film and see it on my 52" HDTV after the format battle is waged and won.</p></br><a href="../users/A11KRMIA0ES88I.html">A11KRMIA0ES88I</a><br/><p>Star Wars plots are inconsequential. Only nerds, dorks and geeks know them. It is the characters we remember: Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, Han Solo, Obi-Wan, C3PO, R2D2 and Chewbacca. George Lucas could have done the world a favor and let Darth Vader die at the end of A New Hope. I was 31 in 1977 and, although I thought the film was okay, I was not swept away like the kids. I thought much of the dialogue was stiff and unemotional. Carrie Fisher has little if any charisma. My favorite is Obi-Wan. He is the one with perseverance, the one who waits years to set things right.</p></br><a href="../users/A3IDMLOWLHWNDJ.html">A3IDMLOWLHWNDJ</a><br/><p>"Remember, "The Force" will be with you, always..."<p>- Obi-Wan Kenobi reassures, Death Star killer, Luke Skywalker to keep the faith in "Star Wars". <p>George Lucas' sci-fi masterpiece, "Star Wars" changed the face of filmmaking forever, inspired future directors, and still, after two and a half decades, still generates legions of fans (I'm still a fan, since 9/77).<p>After his Uncle Owen buys two new droids (short for android), Artoo Detoo & See Threepio, young farmboy Luke Skywalker stumbles across a coded message of a beautiful girl hidden in Artoo's memory banks while cleaning him ("Help me Obi-Wan Kenobi, you're my only hope."). Luke doesn't know who the girl is, but, who she refers to in the message might refer to an old wizard/hermit that lives beyond the "Dune Sea". Luke and the droids go in search of the old man & find him after having a savage run in with the local scavengers. Luke finds out that the old man is indeed Obi-Wan Kenobi and informs Luke that he's also a Jedi Knight and fought alongside Luke's dad in the Clone Wars, as a General.<br />Artoo replays the message for Obi-Wan. The message is actually a desperate plea for help from Princess Leia Organa of the planet Aldreaan. Her message states the Galactic Empire, led by the sinister Sith Lord & former apprentice failure of Obi-Wan's, Darth Vader, has a secret weapon called The Death Star (a space station that can destroy an entire planet) that is ready for use, & can bring great upheaval to the galaxy, certain victory for the evil Empire & certain death to the small band of rebels trying to restore freedom amongst the galaxy. However, stored in Artoo's memory banks are the schematic plans to the Death Star, that contains a major weakness that ultimately can destroy the station. Kenobi's mission is to bring the R2 unit to her father, Senator Organa, on Alderaan so the plans can be secretly delivered to the rebels. Unfortunately, Vader finds out about the missing droids ("Star Wars" opens with the memorable and spectacular space battle above Luke's homeworld of Tatooine with Artoo & Threepio escaping there captured vessel and landing on the planet) and sends hundreds of Imperial Stormtroopers to search for them. The Troopers follow the tracks and inevitably follow them to Luke's homestead (Luke returns home to find the homestead burnt to the ground and the charred remains of his aunt and uncle). Luke, now an Imperial fugitive, decides to help Obi-Wan and to be trained in the ways of the Jedi & The Force, just like his father. The boys head to the local spaceport and book passage with Han Solo, Captain of The Millenium Falcon & his Wookie co-pilot, Chewbacca.<br />But, upon arrival to Alderaan the crew finds out that the planet is the first victim of The Death Star & Alderaan is reduced to nothing more than a meteor shower. The Millenium Falcon is then caught in a tractor beam by The Death Star and is pulled into the massive space station. Through some slick manuevering, the boys go undetected by the Imperial Forces and find out that in order to escape the battle station, the tractor beam needs to be shutdown. Obi-Wan volunteers to shutdown the energy beam at its source, while Luke, Han, Chewie, and the droids remain behind. That plan falls apart as Artoo discovers that Princess Leia is on board, being held as a prisoner with a stay of execution. Luke convinces Han, & Chewie to rescue the endangered princess while the droids stay behind awaiting Obi-Wan's return. The rescue is a success, but, Obi-Wan's past catches up with him as Darth Vader tracks him down through usage of The Force and through, the now legendary, lighsabre duel (a trademark in every "Star Wars" film) Obi-Wan Kenobi falls (and becomes one with The Force) by Darth Vader's blade. The boys with Princess Leia all meet up on board The Millenium Falcon and blast off from The Death Star. Unfortunately, a homing beacon is secretly stored on board the Falcon and leads the battle station to the rebel's hidden fortress. Through the classic final battle Luke joins the Rebel Alliance and learns that The Force will be with him always. <p>An awesome film and always a standout, "Star Wars" revived its dying genre (put it this way if it wasn't for "Star Wars", "Alien" would be first thought of as an illegal Mexican, instead of the space creature, "Star Trek" may have been a success but only limited to television, & "The X Files" would still be locked in a filing cabinet just to name a few). The film is steeped in mythology from around the world & has tons of characters (everyone has a favorite "Star Wars" character). <p>"Star Wars" was released on 5/25/77 in 43 theaters,  has grossed 460 million dollars in the U.S. alone, has a place in The Library of Congress, is #16 on The American Film Institute's top 100 films of all time, & has been nominated for 12 Acadeny Awards, including Best Picture, Director, Supporting Actor & won 6 of those awards including Best Score, Sound, Editing, Set Direction, Costume Design & of course, Visual Effects. The Force is forever is putting it mildly.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DK5AZMXS1QA3.html">A1DK5AZMXS1QA3</a><br/><p>I first saw Star Wars on HBO when I was 5 years old.  I then bought it on VHS, and rented the DVD's when they came out.  The first couple of times I saw the movie, I was amazed and astounded each time.  But after watching the updated version at the theaters and now on DVD, the movie has lost some of its magic and shine.  Here is why.<br /><br />First, of all the re-releases, Lucas tweaked A New Hope the most.  Some scenes were added that should have been left out.  The scene with Jabba in the hangar on Tatooine is a good case in point.  Jappa looks way too small, and not quite as brown as he looks in Return of the Jedi.  Also, one of the great things about the original trilogy is the fact that each character has minimal introduction before they appear on screen.  We expected Yoda to be a tall and majestic warrior when Obi-Wan first tells Luke about it, not a midget with long ears.  Likewise, Jabba and his court made a great introduction for Return of the Jedi.  Now that is all spoiled by his appearance in A New Hope.<br /><br />Second, the special effects of the original A New Hope actually was the most realistic.  They were subtle and helped the movie, but did not carry it.  The special effects of the revised version looked a little too shiny in some places, and somewhat detracts from the supposed "feel" of the Star Wars world; used and rusty.<br /><br />Third, there were some parts of the movie that could have been expanded on to make the storyline more believable, but were not.  My example of this is at the end when the X-wing fighters take on the Death Star.  A space station of that size would surely have hundreds of tie fighters that it could launch into space.  The movie shows about two dozen.  One of the attractions of this movie when it first came out was the space shoot-out scenes, and the last one in this movie could have been greatly improved upon.  Also, why didn't the X-wings try attacking the big planet-destroying gun on the Death Star.  It was clearly visible as a big dish on the surface of the Death Star, and the strafing runs by the X-wings proved the Death Star did not have any energy shielding device.  Why not damage the gun first to buy them some time, and then try and destroy the battle station.<br /><br />Last, with the release of Episodes I, II, and III, Lucas should have used the opportunity to make the storylines of all six movies flow together better.  Specifically, why does Vader sense the force in Luke but not in Leia, especially given the fact that he is in closer proximity to Leia than to Luke.  Or does Vader's force sense become stronger in battle?  Not sure, but would have liked to know.<br /><br />Overall, this re-release was not worth it for me.  Stuff was added that should not have been, and stuff that should have been added were not.  If you've already bought one copy of A New Hope, I would not bother with this one.  If not, then this would be a good buy.</p></br><a href="../users/A32B206L2SEXRA.html">A32B206L2SEXRA</a><br/><p>The movie that started it all,A New Hope tells of young Luke Skywalker,a farm boy living on Tattooine.When his uncle buys two droids,they reveal a message from Princess Leia,who is searching for Obi-Wan Kenobi.While searching for the old hermit,Luke learns that he was a Jedi Knight and served in the clone wars.He also tells Luke that he must go with him to decipher the Princess' message on Alderran.The evil henchmen of Darth Vader burn down Luke's home,so he agrees to go with Obi-Wan and become a Jedi,like his father,Anakin.They meet cocky pilot Han Solo,and his co-captain,Chewbacca,which agree to lead them on their ship,the Millenium Falcon.Together with R2-D2 and C-3po,they head to Alderran,only to find themselves trapped on the dreaded Death Star.They find their way off with Leia,dressed as Imperial DRoids,while Obi-Wan confronts Vader again and is killed.Finally,Luke leads a group of fighter pilots to destroy the Death Star.It's got awesome action and thrills.Buy this movie!</p></br><a href="../users/AV1KYJXHOWPMD.html">AV1KYJXHOWPMD</a><br/><p>I am a big fan of the original versions of Star Wars and I already own the special editions on DVD. I will not take this release. This crappy release is nothing but an insult to all of us true star wars fans.

It's combination of great performances, awesome visual effects, fantastic action sequences, and stirring music combined to create a tour-de-force of the sci-fi genre. George Lucas succeeded in creating a science fiction film that's not only believable, but full of emotion as well. You care for the characters, and are not just enthralled with the specatcular space battles. This is the heart of "Star Wars," and what makes it a milestone in the pantheon of American film!<br /><br />THE SPECIAL EDITION<br /><br />Unlike most others, I really enjoyed the Special Edition of "Star Wars." With the new digital technology, we got to see the full realization of Lucas' vision. Mos Eisley is now a bustling spaceport; the explosions are even more impressive than before; and the final battle at the end is truly spectacular. What's most fascinating of all is how the new visual effects from 1997 blend well with the older effects from 1977. Lucas only fixed what needed to be fixed, and it makes the experience more exciting than ever before.<br /><br />THE LIMITED EDITION DVD<br /><br />When I heard the rumor that Lucas intended to release the 1977 Theatrical Version of the film, I decided to wait before purchasing the films. And the wait was definitely worth it! Both versions of the film are presented with fantastic sound and picture quality. And while the extras are light, just the fact that both versions of the film are available makes it more than worth it.<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br /><br />The Limited Edition 2-Disc Set of "Star Wars - Episode IV: A New Hope" is a fantastic release for one of the greatest science fiction films of all time. Even if you own the 4-Disc boxed-set, the fact that the original version of the film is available makes it worth buying this edition as well. As a "Star Wars" fan, I highly recommend it!<br /><br />Movie/DVD Grade: A+</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>If George Lucas wants to tinker with his films until he dies I don't have a problem with that as long as he makes the films that fans fell in love with available. Finally we get the unaltered original "Star Wars". There's no new digital effects, no additions to the plot and we also get the digitally enhanced, altered version in the same package. So how does the picture look for the 1977 version? It looks fair compared to current standards for DVD. Using the original 1993 transfers for laserdisc as the source Lucasfilm cleaned up the original a bit in preparation for its DVD debut. It's not presented in anamorphic widescreen (which means the picture quality isn't as good as for the other version. That translates to less lines of resolution and a less sharp picture overall). Colors are inconsistent but considering the age of the film that's not surprising. The images are darker and there's a lot of film grain evident again no surprise. It's a pity that the film wasn't cleaned up more and restored for its DVD debut but we'll probably see some enhancement in that area (one hopes) in the deluxe boxed set that Lucas plans next year for the 30th Anniversary of Star Wars.<br /><br />I do find it disturbing though that Lucas made no effort to restore the film. It's almost like a spoiled child giving you something you've asked for. They DO hand it over but there's a lot of pouting and it's clear that it's not something they want to do. I would think that Lucas who grew up on classic horror, science fiction and adventure films would appreciate wanting the films the same way that he remembers them. It's a way to relive those childhood moments and pass them on to your children as well. I would still think that he's proud of his accomplishment of turning a $10 million movie into a $200 million + blockbuster that connected with audiences and present it in the best way possible (much how "Veritgo" or even "Touch of Evil" were restored for home video). I'd suggest a nice long talk with Robert Harris who restored "Rear Window" and "Vertigo". 3 stars for the image and sound quality of the first film 5 stars for the second.<br /><br />The digitally enhanced version looks terrific. I didn't see any differences here compared to the previous release. It's basically the same transfer as before with the same extras as the previous release of a couple of years ago. If you must have the original 1977 release this is the only set to buy.</p></br><a href="../users/A81P47EIXM8HA.html">A81P47EIXM8HA</a><br/><p>To all the cry baby mouth breathers ....complaining endlessly about having to hit up their mommies for cash every time a new version of Star Wars or Star Trek comes out on DVD that doesn't suit them...I say get a job or better yet....get a life..make your own damn movie and stop bashing the person who , unlike you, climbed out from under his mommas skirt and did things with his life.<br /><br />Lucas created the characters and made the movies...he OWNS them...not you the freak fan who saw it 100 times...that gets you ZERO equity in the production or say over its content.

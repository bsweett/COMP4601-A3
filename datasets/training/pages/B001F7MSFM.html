It was beautiful to look at, the characters were startlingly accurate and the storyline & dialogue were on point but I just wasn't feeling it, if you know what I mean? It's hard to explain but the entire thing felt a bit soulless to me, as crazy as that sounds. Del Toro is a visionary, Mignola's comic book concept is unparalleled and Perlman's performance as the titular character was inspired but none of it seemed to gel in the right way.<br /><br />Hellboy II: The Golden Army brings all the stunning visuals, award-winning FX & CG and phenomenal acting presented in the first film and runs wild with them in a free-for-all of imaginative monster mayhem! The sequel has more excitement, more emotion and the characters have certainly taken on a life of their own! If you enjoyed the first, you're going to love the follow-up, if you weren't able to get into the first; you're going to find this to be everything the first wasn't.<br /><br />I seriously enjoyed Hellboy II: The Golden Army, it was overflowing with action, adventure and some of the coolest creature designs I've seen since Nightbreed! As if a freakin' cool movie wasn't enough, Universal gives us this huge 3-Disc DVD release that was packed with more special features than I knew what to do with! I still haven't gotten through all of them! This is a party movie, a buddy film and a family flick all rolled up into one. Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/AWG2O9C42XW5G.html">AWG2O9C42XW5G</a><br/><p>Thats right everyone Hellboy's back in this non stop action sequel to the blockbuster hit. Hellboy returns with his grilfriend liz and his odd but fishy friend abe. Hellboy and his gang are set off to stop the menace of a dark prince who awakens an army to destroy all humanity. so it's up to hellboty and his pals to stop him. this movie is awesome just as good as the first. If you have not seen this movie then you should</p></br><a href="../users/AGVWTYW0ULXHT.html">AGVWTYW0ULXHT</a><br/><p>Guillermo del Toro is the perfect director to bring the characters and events of Mike Mignola's horror comic Hellboy to the big screen, and manages here in the sequel to the mostly satisfying <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AK3S4Y">Hellboy</a> to create a fully realized and seamless vision of a fantastic underworld that overlaps with the everyday.  Del Toro's unique sensibility, that combines a strong sense of whimsy and a keen eye for the macabre, matches precisely the story of an orphaned demon from Hell, raised by a kind-hearted gentleman who happens also to be an expert on the occult.  Hellboy, as played by Ron Perlman, is one of the coolest fantasy heroes ever brought to the big screen; he's tough as nails with a heart of gold, both brutish and tender, the kind of guy who'd single-handedly destroy a monolithic monster, and save a kitty with the other hand.<br /><br />Here Hellboy, or "Red" as he is known to his friends, has to deal with a rogue elf prince, who plans to eliminate humanity, because of its callous indifference to the magic and wonder of the world.  At the same time Red's trying to figure out his girlfriend, a human torch played by Selma Blair (in my mind, her best role -- she's never looked better nor seemed so at ease in a role), and deal with the obnoxious authorities who want to impose rules on a force of nature.  A scene where Hellboy and buddy Abe-sapian commiserate and get drunk to Barry Manilow's "Can't Smile Without You" is pitch perfect hilarious - yet the demons and monsters are inventive and scary and the swordplay, effects, and action is intense and thrilling throughout.  While it may lack some of the profundity and depth of some of the greatest fantasy, you'd be hard pressed to find a fantasy thriller that is more flat out entertaining than this one, at least for those with a geek sensibility like me.</p></br><a href="../users/A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX.html">A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX</a><br/><p>PLease note that I saw this movie on HBO so I can't speak to the quality of the DVD transfer. But I did want to make a few comments about the movie.<br /><br />I basically watch movies like this for the special effects and the action, not expecting anything much in the way a convincing story, well developed characters, or even good acting. That way I avoid the anguished indignation of the many sci fi or fantasy fans when the sequel fails to live up to their overblown expectations. After all, it's sci fi/fantasy, what did they expect? Last Tango in Paris or Gone with the Wind?<br /><br />Of course, the counter-argument is the movie, Bladerunner, which has everything, but then Bladerunner was based on the Philip K. Dick novel, and Dick was a half-wacked, dyspeptic but brilliant sci-fi writer who was in and out of psychiatric care or even mental hospitals much of his life. Maybe there's a lesson there somewhere when it comes to finding good ideas and move scripts.<br /><br />But anyway, all that aside, I really enjoyed this movie, perhaps because I didn't see the original Hellboy which everyone here is unfavorably comparing this sequel to. But this movie has some of the best action, special effects, spectacular background sets, and fight sequences of any recent super hero movie. The fight between Hellboy and the Golden Army soldiers, who can reassemble themselves sort of like animated Leggos, is cool. The final fight scene in the clockwork-like underground cave is ingenious and suspenseful, and the super kung-fu elf bad guy is like something out of Hidden Tiger, Crouching Dragon.<br /><br />Overall a pretty exciting action flick that is sort of like Tolkien's Middle Earth meets Lost in Space, since there are some campy sci-fi elements too. I give it a solid 4.5 stars just for its adrenalin pumping action and special effects. Just ignore the sappy love affair and sit back and watch the action. Plus when the ectoplasmic being in the cool looking space suit tells their CIA-clone boss he can "**** my ectoplasmic schwanstucker" at the end of the movie I just about fell out of my chair.</p></br><a href="../users/APBB297H3ZA5E.html">APBB297H3ZA5E</a><br/><p>1.  I recall the first HellBoy movie as a interesting and entertaining film, but nothing beyond that (it's just my recollection).<br /><br />2.  However, Hellboy II is really a well made movie.  Well acted, witty and funny writing, nice storyline, great action sequences, all in all, a very good movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ.html">A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ</a><br/><p>Guillermo Del Toro has become the new master of dark fantasy -- first with the quirky clockpunk "Hellboy," then with the Oscar-winning "Pan's Labyrinth." Not to mention forthcoming travels to Middle-Earth.<br /><br />So you know he has the skills to pit Mike Mignola's scarlet anti-hero against an army of fairies and elves, and not make it silly. Instead, it's a spectacular dark fantasy full of humor, action, quirky appeal, romance, and some truly astounding special effects. But what really shoves this movie over the top is Del Toro's brilliant direction, and the stunning performance by Ron Perlman.<br /><br />Decades ago, Professor Broom (William Hurt) told a small Hellboy a yuletide bedtime story about the Elf King Balor and his unstoppable Golden Army, and how the crown that controls the Army was split into thirds and divided among fairies and humans. Well, you can't really expect that kind of power to never be revived.<br /><br />Cut to current day. Hellboy (Perlman), Liz (Selma Blair) and Abe (Doug Jones) investigate a strange supernatural attack on an auction house, where the archeological curiosity known as the Crown of Bethmoora was being sold -- only to be attacked by savage tooth fairies. Turns out the crown was stolen by Prince Nuada (Luke Goss), a resentful young elf who is determined to take the world back from humanity -- using, of course, the Golden Army.<br /><br />And while Hellboy chafes against strict new commander Johann Krauss (a suit filled with ectoplasm), Abe encounters Nuada's sister, Princess Nuala -- who also happens to have the last third of the crown. But Nuada will not allow anyone to oppose him as he searches for the Golden Army's location, and Hellboy and his friends must venture into a strange, ancient kingdom to stop him from destroying all of humanity.<br /><br />The worst you can say about "Hellboy II: The Golden Army" is that it sticks to the formula of the demonic outsider with a dark destiny, and his continuing romantic woes. There's some retreading as Hellboy realizes anew that he'll never fit into the world of humans, because he's big and red and has horns and a tail. Okay, we got it. Next big psychological issue!<br /><br />Fortunately those flaws are relatively minor ones. Del Toro is still able to spin a dark, twisted story with some truly bizarre creatures (the utterly alien, eye-winged Angel of Death), clockpunk robots, trippy underground goblin markets and a new BPRD agent who is basically ectoplasm in a suit. And for the action scenes, Del Toro does not pull punches when it comes to the smashing action scenes -- giant thrashing vines and a one-on-one duel with Nuada are among the highlights.<br /><br />With all this going on, it would be easy to neglect the characters. But Del Toro packs the script with solid snappy dialogue and some poignantly romantic moments -- including some pretty startling actions from dear ol' Abe. And he also adds little moments to this epic story that remind us that these are supposed to be people -- such as Hellboy's bickering with Krauss, or Abe and Hellboy getting drunk and having a little Manilow singalong together. It's just so cute.<br /><br />But what really sets this movie apart is the "children of the Earth." No flitting Victorian sprites -- these are creatures that are weird, grotesque, dangerous and immensely powerful, from nasty little tooth fairies up to vast rock monsters and plant gods. There's an alien, bizarre aesthetic to these creatures that feels wholly real, as if Neil Gaiman casually dropped a few sketches onto the drawing board.<br /><br />But as amazing as the visuals are, Del Toro never neglects the characters. Perlman is perfect for the role of "big Red" -- he's gruff, sarcastic, moody, but also endearing and self-deprecatingly likable. There are more hints of his potentially dark future, and he faces some delicately-handed temptations. But Big Red's good heart is still very much in the forefront, no matter how much human beings fear him.<br /><br />Blair gives a more lively performance here as a spunkier Liz, who also has some surprising developments in store. Jones is pitch-perfect as the fish-man, who experiences the first pangs of young love for Nuala, while Goss gives a chilling, whispery performance as a rebel prince who is willing to do whatever it takes -- even kill family -- if it helps him restore the fey kingdom. Pretty good villain, since he clearly isn't trying to be bad.<br /><br />"Hellboy II: The Golden Army" is a wild, darkly ornate ride through the world of half-forgotten gods and fey. While it has a few flaws, those are far outweighed by the brilliant of Del Toro's vision.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>Guillermo Del Toro with this film as well as "Pan's Labyrinth" joins the ranks of Peter Jackson and George Lucas as one of the great visualists working in cinema today.  It would all be for naught if the effects didn't compliment a good story(See "Wanted") but that's not the case here.  This a breezy comic sci-fi concoction that goes down as smooth as lemonade.

An ancient armistice between humans and elves is about to expire as the prince of the elves feels that their adversaries have encroached unto their realms and are in the process of destroying nature and the environment.<br />There are slight hints of the Lord of the Rings and strong elements of X-Men and Men in Black so the movie falls into the action/adventure category.<br />What is very interesting about the movie is that the "villain" is not all that bad and he is in fact right in a lot of what he says and stands for.<br />Ron Perlman and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least, though Luke Goss and the lovely Anna Walton, as Prince Nuada and Princess Nuala respectively (the chemistry is AMAZING), steal the show! Moreover, the setting, the plot, the dialogues, the special effects (!!!), and the music are all wonderful!<br />In short, Hellboy II: The Golden Army is a film definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!

The plot follows the continuing adventures of Hellboy as he deals with more supernatural menaces (fairies, elves, and worse), odd friendships, a change in management, and girl troubles.<br /><br />There is a lot of action, the special effects are *VERY* good, and the acting is on par with the first movie. This is a worthy sequel!<br /><br />All in all, an enjoyable movie.<br /><br />Recommended!<br /><br />CFH</p></br><a href="../users/A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ.html">A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ</a><br/><p>I got swindled into seeing the original Hellboy...not knowing pretty much anything about the background of Hellboy or even what to expect, I came out of the theater with mixed feelings. I typically enjoy this type of superhero/fantasy action-type film, but I felt as though the original really didn't offer me much in the way of true excitement.<br /><br />Fast forward a few years when I and a bunch of friends I hadn't seen in a LONG time finally got together and we sat down to decide what movie we could all agree on...it was 4 votes to 1 (guess who voted 'nay'?) to see Hellboy II. I tried--honestly I tried to get them to agree on Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2 but they would NOT budge. Consequently, I went into this film with rather low expectations--and man was I wrong!<br /><br />Hellboy II turned out to be unbelievably better than the original--and I realize I may be in the minority regarding how poorly I feel about the 1st film, but I gotta tell you, the sequel ROCKED. From the stunnnig special effects to a clever story, and let's not forget great casting as well as finely tuned directing, what isn't to enjoy about H2? Personally the biggest factor in the movies success has GOT to be the fact that at NO point did the movie ever take itself too seriously. Tongue-in-cheek humor abounds throughout the film, mostly coming from the superb acting of Ron Pearlman as Hellboy. Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of stand-out roles sprinkled all over the movie, but for me, it was the main character which honestly gives this particular story the real bite needed in order to make it totally worth seeing--not just once, either.<br /><br />What else can I say? If you liked the original, you will positively LOVE H2 and if you are like me and only thought the 1st was marginally entertaining, then be prepared for an exciting shocker. About the only thing negative I have to say about the film was the build-up to the films climax featuring the Golden Army was so big, that the final conflict literally fizzled...at least for me anyway. I have to say that Hellboy's final fight was about what I expected, but--well, I don't want to spoil the end for you too much.<br /><br />All in all a rare sequel that not only improved upon the original, but for MY $$ actually made up for the fact that I didn't really like the 1st one all that much to begin with.</p></br><a href="../users/A1F2EYORWOZ3G1.html">A1F2EYORWOZ3G1</a><br/><p>Wow! This movie is truly exceptional. The characters pull directly from the first movie and move nicely along into the second, seamlessly.<br />All is exceptionally well done. The special effects, costumes, sound, music, plot... everything.<br />This would certainly be best in a theater, however I rented and boy was I sorry I didn't go to see it while it was playing.<br />Definitely for adults, language and violence are strong themed here. But if you're an adult who likes strong action/fantasy movies then this is the one for you. Without a doubt, one of my more recent favorites.<br />Rent it.... you won't be sorry.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DAOL3NMHEPLS.html">A1DAOL3NMHEPLS</a><br/><p>OK, this is not a great movie, but it's fairly entertaining and the sets and costumes are fabulous. There's less wry humor than in the first Hellboy movie, but it's still there and that's good. Hellboy II holds your interest as the (fairly predictable) storyline unfolds, without taking itself too seriously. I gave it 4 stars, but it's really more like 3.5 or thereabout.</p></br><a href="../users/A25CMSI6S7S63C.html">A25CMSI6S7S63C</a><br/><p>I found the story, character development to be much improved over the first Hellboy. All the characters were really great in their roles and the love interest subplot was cool. Most movies just rely on effects and less on story, but this movie has both, great monsters,effects and a great story. Another good comic book hero story makes it big time on the screen. The DVD Collectors Set comes with the Golden Army robot and booklet, DVD and is worth every penny. I think if you like super hero movies in general this shouldn't disappoint. I thought it was better than the Spiderman movies and as good as any of the Xmen movies. I liked it better than Dark Knight as well. This is one action adventure hero movie with substance.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KJ6JAZPH382D.html">A3KJ6JAZPH382D</a><br/><p>The frenetic and kinetic sequel to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AK3S4Y">Hellboy</a> is a madly imaginative romp that has even more zip than the first. Benicio Del Torro increases the depths to each character, given them emotional play around the story and keeps the ideas running. Del Torro brings his gift for visual flair into the movie ala his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000O76ZQC">Pan's Labyrinth</a>.<br /><br />The other point in "Hellboy 2's" favor is that Hellboy begins to feel the conflict between the world of humans and of his own kind. The conflict with the elvin world presents Liz with a piece of knowledge that she must keep secret. And Abe falls in love.<br /><br />It's the love factors that make this most interesting and provide the balance of humor. The scene with a beer-lubed Red and Blue singing along to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005USBH">Barry Manilow</a> "Can't Smile Without You" is a classic. Moments like that are what helps keep "Hellboy 2" flying high, and make it a better film than the original.</p></br><a href="../users/AER15RIMV8E6D.html">AER15RIMV8E6D</a><br/><p>Today is my 19th Birthday and I received this as a Birthday present!

I have to admit that although it did have its moments, I found myself becoming bored during the movie. The action sequences were the only relief I felt as when we entered into the emotion sequences I simply found my mind drifting. Guillermo Del Toro's work was completely alien to me until the first Hellboy, now although I did enjoy the original I didn't have many high hopes for the sequel. I guess when he entered into the Hellboy 2 project, Del Toro sought to give us a more fast paced, action packed flick that can keep you hooked from the beginning.<br /><br />In this movie life is great for Big Red (Ron Perlman), he's now in what some would call a perfect relationship with Liz (Selma Blair), he has a lot of cats and is just enjoying life. Unfortunately the happiness isn't going to last very long as in the dark supernatural underworld, Prince Nuada (Luke Goss) is planning to rise the indestructible Golden Army once again to destroy the human world. His sister who he's linked to by life doesn't agree with his plans and tries to stop the prince reforming the golden crown which would give him ultimate power over the army. She seeks the help of Big Red and the B.P.R.D.<br /><br />At an increased budget of $80 Million it's obvious from the start that Hellboy 2 is looking to use that budget well. Along with the introduction of a new boss Johann Krauss (Seth Macfarlane), this instalment seeks to introduce a plethora of new fantasy creature. The "Tooth Fairies" are especially bizarre and in a way frightening at their frantic carnivorous nature. A scene that takes place in troll market is especially wonderful with the number of different species going about their daily lives as if in a normal street market.<br /><br />Along the lines of the insanity of new creatures and sheer bizarre nature of some of them, we also see the return of the classic comic one liners. One of my favourite lines in the movie was so simple, yet so effective. A human yells "Hey, you're Hellboy" and right back he says "Yeah Yeah I'm Ugly". To some this may just seem like a witty one liner just for the sake of humour, but it shows how Hellboy is becoming tired of the public admiration and no longer wants a part of it. He also has the talent of coming out with great lines during the action sequences which make them even more enjoyable.<br /><br />Talking about the action sequences, there are plenty to really entertain in this film. The fights involving Prince Nuada are especially enjoyable as they're simply so fast paced that you can hardly keep up. The CGI is flawless and blends well with both characters and environment. Along with the action and humour we are still given the heart of the old movie. We see the relationship between Hellboy and Liz develop into something more serious and Abe Sapien also finds what he would possibly consider his true love. To see them personal relationships blend along with the professional relationships involving the new boss, Krauss. All of the above come together to create an enjoyable 2 hour movie experience that, even if you weren't a fan of the first movie, it's a promise that you will enjoy this instalment. I can only hope that a third movie will be made and possibly on a bigger budget as, although I hate to say it. With this movie series, it seems a bigger budget has meant a much better movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>A surprise package of fun, fright and untamed imagination. A movie that delivers plenty of inventive thrills.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ.html">A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ</a><br/><p>Guillermo Del Toro has become the new master of dark fantasy -- first with the quirky clockpunk "Hellboy," then with the Oscar-winning "Pan's Labyrinth." Not to mention forthcoming travels to Middle-Earth.<br /><br />So you know he has the skills to pit Mike Mignola's scarlet anti-hero against an army of fairies and elves, and not make it silly. Instead, it's a spectacular dark fantasy full of humor, action, quirky appeal, romance, and some truly astounding special effects. But what really shoves this movie over the top is Del Toro's brilliant direction, and the stunning performance by Ron Perlman.<br /><br />Decades ago, Professor Broom (William Hurt) told a small Hellboy a yuletide bedtime story about the Elf King Balor and his unstoppable Golden Army, and how the crown that controls the Army was split into thirds and divided among fairies and humans.<br /><br />Well, you can't really expect that kind of power to never be revived.<br /><br />Cut to current day. Hellboy (Perlman), Liz (Selma Blair) and Abe (Doug Jones) investigate a strange supernatural attack on an auction house, where the archeological curiosity known as the Crown of Bethmoora was being sold -- only to be attacked by savage tooth fairies. Turns out the crown was stolen by Prince Nuada (Luke Goss), a resentful young elf who is determined to take the world back from humanity -- using, of course, the Golden Army.<br /><br />And while Hellboy chafes against strict new commander Johann Krauss (a suit filled with ectoplasm), Abe encounters Nuada's sister, Princess Nuala -- who also happens to have the last third of the crown. But Nuada will not allow anyone to oppose him as he searches for the Golden Army's location, and Hellboy and his friends must venture into a strange, ancient kingdom to stop him from destroying all of humanity.<br /><br />The worst you can say about "Hellboy II: The Golden Army" is that it sticks to the formula of the demonic outsider with a dark destiny, and his continuing romantic woes. There's some retreading as Hellboy realizes anew that he'll never fit into the world of humans, because he's big and red and has horns and a tail. Okay, we got it. Next big psychological issue!<br /><br />Fortunately those flaws are relatively minor ones. Del Toro is still able to spin a dark, twisted story with some truly bizarre creatures (the utterly alien, eye-winged Angel of Death), clockpunk robots, trippy underground goblin markets and a new BPRD agent who is basically ectoplasm in a suit. And for the action scenes, Del Toro does not pull punches when it comes to the smashing action scenes -- giant thrashing vines and a one-on-one duel with Nuada are among the highlights.<br /><br />With all this going on, it would be easy to neglect the characters. But Del Toro packs the script with solid snappy dialogue and some poignantly romantic moments -- including some pretty startling actions from dear ol' Abe. And he also adds little moments to this epic story that remind us that these are supposed to be people -- such as Hellboy's bickering with Krauss, or Abe and Hellboy getting drunk and having a little Manilow singalong together. It's just so cute.<br /><br />But what really sets this movie apart is the "children of the Earth." No flitting Victorian sprites -- these are creatures that are weird, grotesque, dangerous and immensely powerful, from nasty little tooth fairies up to vast rock monsters and plant gods. There's an alien, bizarre aesthetic to these creatures that feels wholly real, as if Neil Gaiman casually dropped a few sketches onto the drawing board.<br /><br />But as amazing as the visuals are, Del Toro never neglects the characters. Perlman is perfect for the role of "big Red" -- he's gruff, sarcastic, moody, but also endearing and self-deprecatingly likable. There are more hints of his potentially dark future, and he faces some delicately-handed temptations. But Big Red's good heart is still very much in the forefront, no matter how much human beings fear him.<br /><br />Blair gives a more lively performance here as a spunkier Liz, who also has some surprising developments in store. Jones is pitch-perfect as the fish-man, who experiences the first pangs of young love for Nuala, while Goss gives a chilling, whispery performance as a rebel prince who is willing to do whatever it takes -- even kill family -- if it helps him restore the fey kingdom. Pretty good villain, since he clearly isn't trying to be bad.<br /><br />There's also loads of extras in this particular edition of the movie -- feature commentary with director Guillermo Del Toro, Jeffrey Tambor, Selma Blair and Luke Goss, as well as some deleted scenes also with commentary with Del Toro, a prologue to the movie, a digital script, image gallery, a "Puppet Theatre" for the opening sequences of the film, concept art, interviews, and other such stuff. Also making-of documentaries -- seven mini-documentaries that visit the set, the "Troll Market Tour" in the movie's most memorable "faerie" setting, and the two-hour "Hellboy: In Service Of The Demon." Basically, it turns the film inside-out and lets you examine its guts.<br /><br />"Hellboy II: The Golden Army" is a wild, darkly ornate ride through the world of half-forgotten gods and fey. While it has a few flaws, those are far outweighed by the brilliant of Del Toro's vision.</p></br><a href="../users/AOXL514GEE4AA.html">AOXL514GEE4AA</a><br/><p>The movie revolves around an ancient story of how the human world and the elf/magic world were at war. The Elf king builds a golden menchanical army to ward off the humans. Upon seeing this destruction the king makes a pact with them. He breaks his crown that controls the army into 3 pieces, giving 1 to the humans. His son disagrees and goes into exile. Fast forward to the present, the magic world is dying and man is thriving. Prince Nuada vows to restore his people by claiming all 3 pieces and reigniting the golden army. It's up to Hellboy and the rest of the BPRD to prevent the destruction of man!<br /><br />Del Toro's sequel is rich in detail, amazing sets and strange creatures. Unfortunately, it doesn't surpass the sequel because it is alittle too campy at times. The visuals are stunning and the story compelling. The campiness doesn't hurt the movie and is a must own for Hellboy fans.<br /><br />NOW FOR MY BLU RAY THOUGHTS: I can't rave enough about how beautiful this transfer is! Universal does it again. The golds, ambers, reds and blues are wonderful. The sound is rich and robust. All special features are ported over.

I get tired just thinking about it.<br /><br />"Hellboy II: The Golden Army" is a wild, darkly ornate ride through the world of half-forgotten gods and fey. While it has a few flaws, those are far outweighed by the brilliant of Del Toro's vision.</p></br><a href="../users/A96JD9312DHWC.html">A96JD9312DHWC</a><br/><p>The Golden Army - an army made to keep humanity in check because humanity has a problem with consuming everything around it. Of elvish thought and goblin design, it has the power to do things that only the desperate - or a madman - would want. The elvish kind figure that out, split their toy up, and let the army rust. Unfortunately for humanity, rust is an arbitrary word and the Golden Army is something that never stopped being a threat. And when the powerplay begins to emerge, the BPRD are the only ones around that have the skills to stop it.<br /><br />When I heard what the source material for the movie was, I knew the director/ Migola knew what they were doing BUT it frightened me a bit. I say that because Hellboy II was creatively based on a novelization between Christopher Golden and Mike Mignola and is not truly reflective of Hellboy. It had a good idea and some good creature-features but, in the end, the book was a mild disappointment. Fast-forward to the book and you saw what a good director could do with something that needed a golden (pardon the pun) touch. The toothfairies, Wink, the elemental, the goblin, the angel (if you want to understand that little beastie and what it says more, check out the backstory to Anung Un Rama and the way the beast was created. This takes place in a short story and highlights some lovely little things that a person should see for themselves to truly understand everything) and all the characters in-between. Happily, the casting has always been good, the direction is fabulous, and Hellboy is portrayed the way Hellboy should be portrayed.<br />This means that he thinks with his fist, has a gun the size of a small man, and is not really filled with a little thing called respect.<br /><br />As far as what the movie offered, let me just say that it had a bit of everything. The action was quite good, the human (and I use human loosely) elements of the tale were fantastic, and the movie explored some more of what the BRPD is. They allowed viewers shapshots into the each person, into their likes and their wants, and they added a new character that translated oddly from book-to-movie but still translated well as a character. Ron is a perfect Hellboy, too, and he lets this shine in this new installment. In the part with the elemental you can see how much he is impacted, and in the fights with specific beings you can tell he doesn't want to hurt them. He wants to be liked by everyone and understands the plight of the things that "threaten" humanity. Del Toro adding that in made in amazing because that is one of Hellboy's things in the books - enough so that the BPRD and he really have some major problems.<br /><br />If you like Hellboy and you want a movie on the subject, this is good work. I know there have been a lot of complaints here and there about certain aspects of the film, but Hellboy is a solid follow-up and fans of the novels/ the first movie will enjoy themselves. If you pay extra attention to the details involved you will find all sorts of good stuff hidden in the backdrop, allowing a peek at what Anung Un Rama is struggling with as a demon-made-human by his own choices. You can also see potential elements that could have ramifications for the world and everyone inhabiting it - I liked that a lot as well. Combine that with a LOT of extra (we even get a comic that moves about to keep the ADD watchers in us sated), and you have a second helping that explores what the first movie could only build.<br />Highly beloved.</p></br><a href="../users/A1COW0UIB5HA9J.html">A1COW0UIB5HA9J</a><br/><p>The big red man known as Hellboy (Ron Perlman) with his fellow B.P.R.D. member Abe Sapien (Doug Jones) and girlfriend Liz Sherman (Selma Blair) returns for more monster hunting.

Once they discover a mystical underworld of magic, that's when the battle between good and evil begins as Big Red himself must stop the evil prince before humanity is lost.<br /><br />A grand and spectacular follow-up to Guillermo Del Toro's brilliant and underrated instant cult horror fantasy comedy adventure "Hellboy" manages to succeeded more then the original. The man who brought you the modern masterpiece "Pan's Labyrinth" Del Toro who co-wrote, produced and directed this movie has delivered another fine film is his as he's now one of the most visionary directors in recent memory. The storyline is quite good including the acting, there's a good sense of humor like the memorable Hellboy singing along to Barry Manillow while being drunk scene. An excellent mix of puppetry, CGI and make-up effects for the imaginative creatures in this feature, a very cool prologue featuring a young Hellboy with a cameo by John Hurt and of course some heart with a moral about power & self-sacrifice with the power of love. The action sequences are also outstanding to go along with this film, now here's a rare sequel that can surpass the original and any fan of fantasy, action, horror and even the comics would enjoy this movie.<br /><br />This 2-disc Blu-Ray is outstanding stuff as it features mind-blowing picture and sound that will blow you away. The Extras are incredible such as the Blu-Ray exclusive U-Control features like Concept art Gallery to view the art during the movie, Director's Notebook as it tells Del Toro notebook with sketches, notes and inteviews including Behind The Scenes tour through the Hellboy 2 set during the movie as it also views alternate takes from the movie and more stuff.

I'm ugly."<br /><br />I really liked this sequel, even though it kind of strayed away from the much darker tone creator Mike Mignola had infused into his Hellboy comics (the first movie was more on par with Mignola's vision). But, if you're down with visually dazzling feasts and with Hellboy and Abe Sapien gettting their drink on and serenading each other with a Barry Manilow lament, then you won't find much to nag about in HELLBOY 2: THE GOLDEN ARMY. If you've seen and been entranced with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JPA6">Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)</a>, then this is more of director Guillermo del Toro unleashing his vivid, vivid imagination.<br /><br />A set-up: Lost ages ago, mankind went to war against the supernatural kinds. In desperation, an army of golden mechanical warriors, numbering 70 by 70, was created for the elven king, and a magical crown to control this army. But such devastation was wrought by this invincible army that the king felt regret and enabled a cessation of hostilities between man and the faerie folk. In good faith, the crown was broken into three pieces, one piece given to man for safekeeping - and, so, the golden army fell dormant. But Prince Nuada, fierce son of the elven king, rebuked the peace and vanished in a self-imposed exile, vowing to return in his people' direst need.<br /><br />Well, dude's back. This time, he's bent on re-establishing the dominion of faerie kind. And he'll achieve this by wresting control of the indestructible golden army from the aged king, who now dwells in the sewers of New York. And, so, as Nuada begins to gather the pieces of the crown, all that stands between him and the cowing of man is his elegant twin sister, the Princess Nuala. And the Bureau for Paranormal Research & Defense. And, of course, the demonic hero Hellboy.<br /><br />What struck me the most is the ridiculous inventiveness of the movie. This is a beautiful and strange motion picture, and I found myself constantly rewinding the dvd for a second gander at some thing fleetingly shown on screen. From the swarm of nasty tooth fairies to the colossal forest elemental, from the busy Troll Market under the Brooklyn Bridge to the fearsome Angel of Death. The visuals are lush and lavish and bizarre stuff, classic fantasy tropes crossed with steampunk sensibilities and clashing with scenes in urban New York City. Tim Burton might've creamed his trousers.<br /><br />The cast has got game. Ron Perlman as Hellboy stabilizes the film with his solidity, as an actor and as a physical presence. Doug Jones returns as the immensely likable psychic fishman Abe Sapien, and how good is he that he even manages to be expressive solely thru the use of hand movements? This time, Doug himself, and not David Hyde Pierce, utters Abe's dialogue and does very well. Perlman and Jones chugging beer and singing that duet may well be my favorite moment in the film. Hellboy's love of the limelight lands him in hot waters with Washington, which promtply sends the by-the-book Prussian, Johann Krauss, to B.P.R.D. to be Hellboy's minder. Krauss happens to be an ectoplasmic entity housed in a robotic body. And he happens to be brilliantly voiced by Seth MacFarlane. We have a great villain in Prince Nuada, all credit to Luke Goss's performance. Goss lends his character a hefty measure of pathos and torn nobility. And, apparently, even the fey know wushu. You may root for Hellboy, but you end up kind of feeling for Nuada, who feels the inexorable passing of his race. And, so, he rages against it. But, I guess, wouldn't you?<br /><br />Mention's already been made, and aptly so, to how certain scenes in HELLBOY II evoke moods originally set in the classic Star Wars' canteen (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FQJAIW">Star Wars Episode IV - A New Hope (1977 & 2004 Versions, 2-Disc Widescreen Edition)</a>) and in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000640SB">Men in Black (Deluxe Edition)</a>. I wasn't that bothered, because those quick-hitting sight gags are very cool. However, these similarities are so marked that I couldn't help but be lifted straight out of the story (thinking: "Hey, like in Tattoine!" or "Hey, that's kinda like M.I.B!). They also, tonally, take away from Hellboy's darker mythology. HELLBOY II does come with plenty of humor, and, thankfully, most of it fits well within the confines of the story.<br /><br />This is the 3-Disc Special Edition, and it's steeped in sweeeet special features goodness. Disc 1 offers the widescreen feature presentation and the following bonus material: 2 audio commentaries, one by Director Gillermo del Toro (informative), the other (which is more staid and flounders at times) by actors Selma Blair, Jeffrey Tambor, and Luke Goss; Set Visits: behind-the-scenes stuff on seven scenes ("The Chamberlain," "Wink Vs. Abe," "Hellboy Vs. Wink," "The Elemental Egg," "Big Baby," "'H' Is For Hotel," & "Disintegrating Loyalty"); Troll Market Tour with del Toro playing tour guide; the 5-minute "Zinco Epilogue" animated comic (in which the tale of a forgotten foe is told and man's allegiance to the dark arts is revealed); and 6 deleted scenes (with optional director's commentary).<br /><br />The highlight of Disc 2 is "Hellboy: In Service of the Demon," a 19 chapter extravaganza which delves comprehensively into many aspects of the movie, from del Toro conducting pre-production meetings with his brain trust about his vision of the movie to the stunt work to behind-the-scenes looks at showcased creatures like the tooth fairies, Mr. Wink, Johann Krauss, etc. "Hellboy: In Service of the Demon" runs at over 2 and a half hours. There are several more technical segments which digs even deeper into the film-making process: the Production Workshop (3 minutes long) features the film's puppet animation segment near the start, but in three aspects shown simultaneously on screen: del Toro's thumbnail sketches, Mignola's storyboard, and the finished sequence (with optional director's commentary); the Pre-Production Vault includes the Director's Notebook (selected excerpts, hard to read with its tiny script and sometimes in Spanish, and with occasional video pods) and the movie gallery (which includes a slideshow with audio commentary by Mike Mignola). The Marketing Campaign segment features a busload of Hellboy II posters. And there's a DVD-ROM function which gives you access to a printable version of the film script.<br /><br />And Disc 3 is the digital copy.<br /><br />Hellboy is an irresistible character. Prophesy warns that Hellboy someday will usher in the end of the world. Yet Hellboy every day turns his back on his demonic destiny and struggles to do right and be accepted by humanity. It's why I follow Mike Mignola's stories and watch the movies. I really like that Hellboy here is settled enough that he's living out his own version of combative domestic bliss with his fire-wielding lady love, Liz. Of course, during a dust-up with the tooth fairies, Abe senses something unexpected about Liz which throws a spanner into her and Hellboy's relationship. But never mind. Either Hellboy and Liz will work it out (or they won't). This sequel runs on a larger scale. It boasts wicked action, spectacular special effects and set designs, memorable creatures, and solid acting. It offers bits of lightheartedness and moments of tragedy, arcane gizmos and knick-knacks, and two love stories. Once again, Guillermo del Toro shows his creativity and affinity for fantasy. He again creates a wonderful film.<br /><br />(Is this review too Pollyanna? Okay, here's something: that actor playing a young Hellboy in 1955? I didn't think she was good.)</p></br><a href="../users/A3CN9CCJUNIPKT.html">A3CN9CCJUNIPKT</a><br/><p>"Hellboy II", ably directed by Guillermo Del Toro, picks up where the last film left off -- Hellboy is still working for a super-secret government agency in charge of cleaning up (and covering up) supernatural events. And he's still a rebel, blowing things up and punching folks out as the mood strikes him.  Del Toro and his crew clearly had a lot of fun making this, with a flippant, what-the-heck attitude coming through in every scene. The film cheerfully references "Lord Of The Rings," "Indiana Jones," "The Mummy" and any number of action-y movies -- including Del Toro's own work, with some demons that look an awful lot like the creepy guys in "Pan's Labyrinth." The easygoing air of not taking things too seriously makes this enjoyable, although the Hellboy series still seems to be finding its legs in some ways, particularly with the characters finding their voices... Selma Blair's Liz character still seems a bit flat, and Ron Perlman occasionally seems to be phoning in his scenes, but Doug Jones steals the show as the aquatic C3PO-ish Abe, and a new character -- the ectoplasmic, half-robotic group leader Krauss -- is a fascinating addition to Hellboy's Scooby Gang. Another sequel is sure to follow, particularly since we've been given tantalizing glimpses of HB's hellish royal lineage. This installment was entertaining -- I'm sure HB3 will be fun as well!

So what exactly is the problem here..well the story  felt a bit forced at times. I didnt feel there was a need for a sequel in the first place..it was pretty much a sequel to get fans to watch.<br /><br />  the movie is not horrible,no that not what I said,its pretty descent..but its just theres nothing new to bring about Hellboy,sure he is back with that big gun and evrything, he is still with Liz from the first movie..so what? I wanted to see the Golden army..and all I got was 5 min..at the end. There are good moments like the fight with Prince Nuada and the gaurds..cool right?..but the rest is like..ugh, not the mention the silly love story between Abe Sapien and the Princess...very ludricous and unecessary. not the best movie this year<br /><br />MY PERSONAL RATING: 3 OUT OF 5</p></br><a href="../users/A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y.html">A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y</a><br/><p>For some odd reason I prefer the first movie to the sequel,I like Hellboy's character but I think it could been better,for some reason I thought I was watching harry potter mixed with labyrinth.</p></br><a href="../users/AQZH7YTWQPOBE.html">AQZH7YTWQPOBE</a><br/><p>I wasn't crazy about <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AK3S4Y">Hellboy</a>.

This helps keep the pace of the movie going, keeping it from feeling like it is dragging. The scenes flow very nicely from one to the next (which is also done very nicely with some creative wipes and overlaps).<br /><br />The real draw for this film, however, is Hellboy and the team that has been provided for him. Ron Perlman is the absolutely perfect Hellboy. His delivery of the lines is nothing short of perfect in creating an acerbic, yet ultimately lovable (as well as loving) character. He has a wry humor about him that makes the Hellboy character something that we can all relate to. We've all had times when we feel under appreciated. We've all felt like the unwelcome outsider. Yet despite all of the inducements that he has to give up defending these humans, he continues to do it because that is what his "father" taught him to do.<br /><br />Of course Abe and Liz are here as well, and Doug Jones and Selma Blair each do a wonderful job of portraying their respective characters. But this is not their movie. It is interesting, however, to see one of the story elements of the first movie get turned around to portray the other side of it in this one when the team encounters the angel of death.<br /><br />In short, as I said above, if you liked the first one, this is just your kind of movie. I look forward to seeing what del Toro has in mind for the third movie. (Of course, we'll have to wait for him to finish "The Hobbit" first.)</p></br><a href="../users/A2R1HAXRNU0QX7.html">A2R1HAXRNU0QX7</a><br/><p>Before going to see HELLBOY II: THE GOLDEN ARMY, my wife and I sat down a re-watched the original HELLBOY with our 15 year old daughter, because she had not seen it. I truly enjoyed seeing the original film again after a few years, and was once again quite interested in the trials and triumphs of "Red", "Blue," "Liz" and all the others.<br /><br />So the next night, we went to see HELLBOY II, and frankly, I was nearly blown away. It's a far superior movie. Everything the first film got right, this one gets right again. And what amazes me is that I'm not really a "superhero movie" fan or a "comic book" fan...yet I think these particular characters, as realized by Guillermo del Toro and his team, are marvelous meldings of "mundane" human emotions with outsized powers. Hellboy is incredibly strong, supernaturally durable and also the spawn of the devil. Yet he drinks too much, is too clingy with this girlfriend and has an all-too-human short fuse. Abe Sapien is shy and softspoken...but he also has psychic powers and can breathe underwater. Liz is an attractive but troubled young lady who can set some pretty nasty fires just by thinking about it.<br /><br />You might say that X-MEN plows the same soil...yet those films, to me, are all glossy surface level efforts. Perhaps it's because there are SO MANY X-Men that few of them are more than assemblages of some character traits. In HELLBOY, we almost forget we're looking at "monsters."<br /><br />That effect is aided by the fact the Del Toro has concocted some of the most monstrous looking creatures ever seen in a mainstream film. I don't even know what to call his creations...they sometimes look like something from H.P. Lovecraft, sometimes like something from the Cantina in STAR WARS and yes, sometimes like creatures from PAN'S LABRYNTH. But all his creatures are striking to look at and brilliantly executed.<br /><br />HELLBOY II follows the efforts of Hellboy and his gang to restore the truce that has long existed between humans and "creatures" such as trolls, gremlins, elves and many other far less identifiable "fantastic" beings. The evil Prince Nouda is essentially breaking the truce with man, and intends on ridding the earth of them forever by bringing back to life an army of 4900 giant robots than simply cannot be destroyed and setting them to rampage through our cities.<br /><br />So often, stories like this just aren't terribly interesting, but I have to say that this one kept me going throughout. Much simply had to do with the imagination with which all the beings are presented. In an early, very striking scene, the Prince confronts his elderly, elf-like father. When the old man dies...his body turns into a stone statue. I know we've seen this kind of effect before...but the feeling this transformation evokes is a lovely mixture of awe at the beauty and dread at the finality of the change.<br /><br />But thankfully, the world has Hellboy to protect it. He charges into the fray, barely understanding what's going on, but hellbent to kick some butt!! His crush first, ask questions later attitude gets him into trouble, of course...but also wins the affections of the audience. He's like a little kid with some big powers. His is somewhat domesticated by his fiery girlfriend (their relationship has progressed in surprising ways over the years)...but he still can't help letting his big arm fly! The crew is joined by a new "leader" in the form of Johann Krauss, an entity made entirely of gas! Krauss animates an old-fashioned diving suit in order to give himself some shape...but his powers (and his Teutonic arrogance) give the movie a nice jolt. He's a completely new creature. Not physically strong like Hellboy or empathic like Sapien. He's smart and he knows some pretty cool ways to use his gaseous state! He and Hellboy have what amounts to a locker-room showdown that had me and the entire audience in stitches.<br /><br />I see that I am just going on and on in my review. There's so much more I'd like to share...but I hope you at least get the gist that this is a highly entertaining and worthwhile film. Del Toro is a visionary director. But I would be remiss if I didn't mention that the film is truly made wonderful by the fully-realized and heartfelt performance of Ron Perlman as Hellboy. He'll never get an Oscar for a part like this (not that he should)...but he gets a Summer Movie Season of 2008 MVP award for his very charismatic turn. Selma Blair has never looked better. Doug Jones (Abe) is wonderful in his physicality and the always enjoyable John Hurt even makes an early, welcome appearance. Only Jeffrey Tambor (normally so good) comes off poorly as their befuddled boss. His part is actually written to make him too much of a buffoon, so he's actually only irritating most of the time.<br /><br />In the best sense, I felt swept away by this film. I am quite eager for Part III!!</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>Hellboy 2: The Golden Army (Guillermo del Toro, 2008)<br /><br />Guillermo del Toro is one of those guys who throws a monkeywrench into everything. At first I figured he was your basic foreign director: making movies at home that are simply fantastic, being recruited by Hollywood, and then turning out stuff here that's entirely leached of the aspects that make his foreign films so great. And it was the usual formula for a while; he made Cronos at home and Mimic in Hollywood, went home and made The Devil's Backbone, came back and made Blade II. And then came the monkeywrench... Hellboy. del Toro once again teamed up with Ron Perlman, who was so phenomenal in Cronos (and the only thing about Blade II of worth), and came up with one of the best comic book superhero adaptations of the last two decades. (Then he went home and made Pan's Labyrinth, and damn if that wasn't a game-changer.) Inevitably, because it's Hollywood, a successful comic-book movie had to have a sequel, and so along came The Golden Army. Surprisingly, they got this one right, too, with the relevant cast and crew coming back, a bigger budget, and the same sense of stupid fun that made the first movie so good.<br /><br />We start off with a flashback to Professor Broom (John Hurt) reading the fable of the Golden Army to Hellboy as a child. Fast-forward to present, and the Kingdom of the Elves, who built the Golden Army, is in turmoil. King Balor (Roy Dotrice, from the highly-anticipated A Game of Thrones adaptation), who originally negotiated a treaty with humanity to never unleash the Golden Army, is grown old and feeble, and while his daughter Nuala (Crusoe's Anna Walton) is right there with him on that, his son Nuada (Blade II's Luke Goss) is disgusted with what the humans have done to the earth. He unofficially declared war on them, in fact, by blasting his way into a New York City auction house where a piece of the crown used to control the Golden Army was being auctioned off. Part of the treaty involved the splitting up of the crown; one piece went to the humans, while the elves kept two. Now Nuada has the human piece, and needs to get the others from his dad. Where does Hellboy (Perlman) fit into all of this? Well, when he's not fighting with his girlfriend Liz (Kath & Kim's Selma Blair), the two of them, along with old pal Abe Sapien (del Toro regular Doug Jones), and their human handler Manning (Jeffrey Tambor), do things like investigate auction houses where elves come and slaughter people in order to get back a piece of crown. As it usually is with Hellboy, the investigation is a comeplete cock-up, and the government sends in a new guy to head up the department, Johann Krauss (played at various times by Layer Cake's James Dodd and Men in Black II's John Alexander, but voiced by Seth MacFarlane of Family Guy fame). Given Hellboy's entrance into this world, he's not too happy with Germans, as a rule...<br /><br />Now don't get me wrong, this is not as good a movie as Hellboy. it suffers from pacing problems, it dwells a bit much on the soap-opera aspects of the relationship between Hellboy and Liz (though rest assured this does become germane to the plot), and it could have used a slightly more zealous editor; it runs maybe ten minutes longer than it should. And I know there are quite a few fans of the first film in the franchise who hated this one, but I can't quite imagine why. Yes, there's a bunch of eco-silliness in the plot and the aforementioned pace problems rear their ugly heads a time or two, but the Hellboy flicks are about two things: a whole lot of action and Guillermo del Toro's fabulist vision of the world. Rest assured you're going to get the former, and as for the latter, the only time del Toro has failed to deliver was in Blade II, where his hands were tied by an already-existing iconography. The world of The Golden Army is that same blend of the real and the fantastic that's made all of his foreign movies so amazing. For sheer visual spectacle, it's hard to beat del Toro. And while the film is a bit slack and soap-opera-y, it's still big, stupid fun. ***</p></br><a href="../users/A3M6RVUVZOQZLB.html">A3M6RVUVZOQZLB</a><br/><p>"Hellboy: The Golden Army" is just amazing! Shoot! Hellboy himself is amazing, especially considering his DNA. The early scene in which his Earth father reads a bedtime story about the Golden Army: How it came to be and how it was put to "sleep" --is also amazing and sets up the premise for the story at Hand (er, no offense, Hellboy). Young Hellboy is so endearing with his broken horn--you know, boys have mishaps--so believing in all his father says, so, well, downright sweet (considering his DNA).<br /><br />However, Hellboy grew up. His adult demeanor is cynical, macho. He works for a very secret branch of the FBI that houses--literally--"odd" creatures from the supernatural world. We get a glimpse of a few when the film turns to the time sequence for this story. We also learn that Liz (the fiery woman who can ignite at will) lives with her man, Red--Hellboy--and is miffed at his behavior as a domesticated male. Yet, remember that sweet side? Hellboy is totally in love with Liz.<br /><br />The most delightful scene occurs when Red takes a six-pack to Abe Sapien's room (he's the Fish Man) who has also fallen in love. After Red convinces Abe to imbibe, they start singing with Barry Manilow (of all singers!) his saccharine song "I Can't Smile Without You."<br /><br />Meanwhile, Lord Elfin wants to awaken the Golden Army and put them at his command. His goal is to declare war against humans because of the awful things they have done to the planet. Elves respect nature (remember Lord of the Ring?).<br /><br />Of course, Lord Elf gets the third piece of the crown (or we wouldn't have a battle) and finally gets his army--the indestructible golden ones. Only the progeny of royalty can challenge the royal holder of this special crown. That's where Hellboy's DNA comes in. But I'll say no more.<br /><br />Here are a few things so mysterious, so dazzling about this film:<br />1. Reminding the viewer of Hellboy's dual fathers<br />2. Setting up the current circumstances of Hellboy's life<br />3. Reminding the viewer of Hellboy's love story<br />4. Setting up the premise for the Golden Army<br />5. Dazzling special effects, both simple and boldly imaginative<br />6. The reminder of the beautiful and destructive sides of nature<br />7. The universal qualities of love<br />8. A vivid reminder that, in the end, good wins over evil.<br />9. Also, a suggestion that what seems evil may, in reality, have good intentions.<br /><br />This film comes highly recommended. Director, actors, music, cinematography, editing--it's all perfect and every second bonds with the second before and after it!</p></br><a href="../users/AIFXFHO2N9WJB.html">AIFXFHO2N9WJB</a><br/><p>Out of all the comic book based movies that have been released over the last several years, I can only think of one that I just knew would have difficulty striking a chord with audiences; and yet, I found myself to be completely surprised when the end result turned out to be a great success. The film I am referring to was the 2004 surprise hit, "Hellboy" starring Ron Perlman as a bright red, demonic monster hunter. Before the original film arrived in theaters, the promotional images looked impressive, especially the make-up effects work being done to create Hellboy's devilish visage; which was something I never thought would look even remotely realistic. Yet, somehow what I once thought impossible, without going cheesy, B-movie-esque with the whole production, was brought to an entertaining reality. With the release of "Hellboy" and its anxiously awaited sequel "Hellboy 2: The Golden Army", both films directed by critically acclaimed director Guillermo Del Toro ("Blade 2"), a once obscure comic book hero has broken into the mainstream, and a new franchise is taking Hollywood by storm.<br /><br />"Hellboy 2: The Golden Army" finds our crimson hero (Ron Perlman) grappling with personal issues centering around his fiery relationship with Liz (Selma Blair) and his desire to become widely known and accepted by the public that still believes him to be a myth. Meanwhile, an ancient truce is unraveling, and dark forces, led by the power hungry Prince Nuada (Luke Goss), are gathering to wage a devastating war upon humanity the likes of which have never been seen.<br /><br />Earlier in 2008, when the first trailers started appearing to signal the upcoming arrival of "Hellboy 2: The Golden Army", I was excited about seeing the movie for two reasons. One, the original film was so much fun and a truly great comic book adaptation; and two, from what I could tell of the story from the previews, the second film looked as if it was going to be another exciting adventure starring our favorite demonic devil buster, and early buzz had it sounding as if it could even be a bit better than its predecessor. From my perspective, I don't know if I can say that this is one of those rare instances where the sequel surpasses the original film, but I do believe that it is easily an equal to "Hellboy" in every way.<br /><br />The story for the original film was two-fold, first and foremost, it seemed to be a very faithful film adaptation of a semi-popular Dark Horse comic book that had yet to break into the mainstream with the heroes of DC Comics or Marvel; secondly, it was a terrific jumping on point for typical movie audiences (obviously), and for those comic book fans that had not been introduced to the character yet, and perhaps had only heard about him in passing or whatever the case may be. With the first film, writer Guillermo Del Toro obviously had to get the obligatory origin tale out of the way for audiences to be able to relate to and understand this rather atypical superhero. With "Hellboy 2: The Golden Army", Del Toro (once again returning as writer and director) was able to essentially dispense with the pleasantries, so to speak, and just dive into the two main driving forces of the story.<br /><br />The primary plot of the film, in my opinion, centers on Hellboy and Liz's chaotic romance, and his need for acceptance from anyone and everyone around him. Generally, I get kind of annoyed when comic book films make a romance the focal point of the story (for example, the Spider-Man series; great films, too much romance though), yet in this instance the romantic angle was handled with an appropriate dosage of humor and seriousness, that it never feels too heavy-handed or bogs the story down in any way. The secondary plot revolved around Prince Nuada's bid for power in his realm, and his quest for vengeance upon the human world. It was this latter storyline that propelled the action/adventure aspect of the story, while the former provided the dramatic element needed to keep the film interesting.<br /><br />What was nice about having these two major plots running concurrently throughout the movie was the fact that Del Toro was wise enough to intertwine them at various points throughout the duration of the film. Sometimes when two major plot lines drive a story, they tend to not intersect with each other all that much, and at times this can result in one of the stories not feeling quite as resolved as the other (most likely as an attempt to cash in on a sequel). For "Hellboy 2: The Golden Army" the two plots both come to satisfying conclusions providing the audience with a sense of resolution should another sequel not occur; while still leaving enough of an opening for a follow-up should the opportunity arise.<br /><br />If I were to judge "Hellboy 2: The Golden Army" purely from a visual effects standpoint, then it is by far a superior film to the original. Of course this is the result of a heftier budget, thanks in no small part to the success of "Hellboy". Even with a sizeable budget increase, Del Toro continues his somewhat rebellious ways within Hollywood, by taking the road less traveled these days. Meaning that he does not solely rely upon CGI to create his fantastical world of creatures. Sure there was a generous amount of CGI dispersed throughout the film, and without a doubt it all looked excellent; however, assisting the CGI, Guillermo Del Toro opted to use a large array of practical effects for many of the creatures he wished to bring to life. Make no mistake when you see this movie the CGI is virtually impeccable, but the costumes and creature designs created for the practical (on-set) side of things is simply astounding. After watching this film, it's easy to understand why Hollywood has branded Guillermo as being a visionary director from his work on both "Pan's Labyrinth" and now "Hellboy 2: The Golden Army".<br /><br />The actors and actresses in this film are all top-notch, and considering that roughly 85% of them are wearing some form of prosthetics or heavy make-up or something of the sort, it's surprising how strong the performances turned out. Ron Perlman ("Hellboy") as the titular character, once again nails the role perfectly. I firmly believe that there is no other actor in Hollywood that could have captured this role any better than Ron has; from his sardonic wit, gruff voice, and the fact that he looked as if he simply walked off the comic book page, there is no doubt in my mind that Ron Perlman was born to be Hellboy. Selma Blair reprises her role as Liz Sherman. No longer a victim of her powers, Liz is in complete control, and has accepted her role in protecting humanity from those who wish to do it harm. Even though she has conquered one problem, she still has to deal with her often immature boyfriend, Hellboy, which causes more than just a few fiery arguments to say the least. It is their frequently heated relationship that makes for some of the most fun and entertaining moments of dialogue within the film.<br /><br />The extremely talented, yet rarely heard from, Doug Jones once again personifies Abe Sapien; but this time Doug actually gets to provide the voice for the character as well. In the previous film, Doug's vocal performance was replaced by actor David Hyde Pierce (TV's "Frasier"), much like his performance in "Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer" when Laurence Fishburne was brought in to provide the voice for the Surfer, while Doug provided the physical performance for the character. Luckily, Doug's voice is similar to David's so if a person isn't paying close enough attention, or if it's been a while since they last watched the first film, they'd never even know it was another actor's voice providing the line readings. This does beg one question though. If Doug and David's voices were so similar, then why have David provide the voice in the first place, or for that matter why switch to Doug for the sequel? Perhaps, David Hyde Pierce wasn't available at the time to work on this film. Who knows? Lastly, Luke Goss ("Blade 2") as the villainous Prince Nuada, gave a performance that was equal parts dangerous and creepy weird, oftentimes he was both at the same time. The only thing that I felt was odd about Luke's performance was that he sometimes seemed to have a slight accent in his delivery, yet other times nothing out of the ordinary. Other than those sporadic bits of an accent, I thought Luke was a good choice for the lead villain, and that he gave a fairly strong, if not slightly inconsistent performance.<br /><br />"Hellboy 2: The Golden Army" is an absolutely entertaining, action-packed adventure that perfectly expands upon everything that was great about the original film without ever seeming repetitive or unoriginal. While not necessarily surpassing the original film, this movie doesn't fall short of it either, which is an achievement for any sequel to attain.<br /><br />"Hellboy 2: The Golden Army" is rated PG-13 for violence and language.</p></br><a href="../users/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z.html">AEQFYOI6YJ83Z</a><br/><p>Guillermo del Torro is one of the most visionary directors working the scene right now; watch "Pan's Labyrinth" if you have any doubts.  Or watch "Hellboy II: The Golden Army."  At first, it's a horrible title--kinda cheesy.  But after watching the movie, you get it: This is a fairy tale, more Grimm than Anderson, with a hero who is destined to bring about the destruction of mankind.  Sounds like a real trooper.<br /><br />In "Golden Army," Red and his comrades must face a...well...a golden army.  Actually, they must first try and stop Prince Nuada, an elf warrior who is tired of mankind ignoring and spitting on his people.  He aims to raise the Golden Army from their ancient slumber, and set them loose upon the world.  And only a hellspawn (that would be our White Knight) can stop him.  There's just one catch: Prince Nuada is more than a match for humankind, and may even be more powerful than our beloved hero.<br /><br />"Golden Army" is a visual delight: I don't even want to term the images we see as "special effects;" they are simply more realistic, more vital, than that limited term implies.  The first "Hellboy" was an impressive little action diddy, but little more; "Golden Army" is a tour-de-force, a treat to the senses.  The effects (I guess I have to use the word, after all) are stunning.  The dialogue is quick and furious; this movie is almost as funny as it is impressive.  The acting is superb; Ron Perlman, as always, manages to charm (and, let's face it, make us just a tad bit uneasy).  His rapport with teammates Selma Blair and Doug Jones (who plays multiple roles, as he did in "Pan's Labyrinth") is genuine and engaging.  Luke Goss, as the evil Prince Nuada, is a scene-stealer, a thoroughly menacing character; Goss manages, even, to bring a bit of nuance to the Prince, making him for of a tragic figure (as fits the fairy tale backdrop).  Seth MacFarlane (yes, the "Family Guy" Seth MacFarlane) brings a bit of sly grace to the character of Johann Krauss, bringing what could have been a cliched character his own little personality.<br /><br />And, see, that's the thing about "Hellboy II": nothing here is cliched.  It could have been; but it isn't.  Because this movie is a fairy tale: one gigantic, action-packed fairy tale, albeit one where the lines between good and evil aren't quite so discernable, and our hero is destined to be our destroyer.  But that's del Torro for you: He never plays completely by the rules; he always manages to bend them to his will.  "Hellboy II: The Golden Army" is simply a stunner, and much more than a comic book movie, or even a sequel.  This is a movie to delight and entertain...but also, perhaps, to make us think about ourselves and the world around us.  It's a secondary goal, to be sure, but it's there...it's there...somewhere behind the bone-eating tooth fairies and the cat-eating trolls.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>Were the Hellboy series in anyone else's hands other than Guillermo Del Toro's, who knows how Mike Mignola's beloved creation would be mishandled.  Like the first film before it, Hellboy II: The Golden Army finds the visionary director of Pan's Labyrinth and Blade II bringing Hellboy and his cohorts to vivid life, and doing a spectacular job of it.  The film picks up with Hellboy (Ron Perlman), his pyrotechnic girlfriend Liz (Selma Blair), and fellow B.P.R.D. agent Abe Sapien (Doug Jones) running afoul of a vengeful elf (Luke Goss) who seeks to restore his kingdom's power by awakening a legendary indestructible army to go to war with mankind.  To complicate matters Hellboy gets a new, by-the-book boss in the form of Johan Krauss (who has been brilliantly realized on film, and is wonderfully voiced by Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane), and has some looming problems with his relationship with Liz to boot.  Hellboy II manages to successfully top the first film in nearly every way, featuring some brilliant set-pieces and art design, and some even more spectacular makeup and creature effects.  The world that Del Toro oversees here really is a world of wonder that should not be missed out at all in the least bit, especially if you are a fan of Hellboy.  All in all, Hellboy II: The Golden Army is a wonderful comic book adaptation from a visionary director, and here's hoping that there will be more to come from Del Toro and Hellboy alike.</p></br><a href="../users/A161ANWB62G3M8.html">A161ANWB62G3M8</a><br/><p>This is a very, very good movie.

Now flash forward to '08 amd Guillermo Del Toro has now become a hot ticket following the success of Pan's Labryinth and much to my surprise, he decides to make a sequel to Hellboy, entiled the Golden Army. Most of the main cast return, Ron Perlman as Hellboy aka 'Red', Selma Blair as firestarter Liz Shermen, and Doug Jones as Abe, with the notable absence of Meyers but other then that one character, they are all back.<br /><br />The film begins with the story of the uneasy truce between mankind and the mystical creatures of the world, who hundreds of years ago fought a war between each other, which resulted in the construction of an unstoppable fighting force called the Golden Army. Hundreds of years later and the exiled prince of the elves has returned to claim the throne and launch war upon the human race, where it is up to Red and the gang to stop him before he unleashes the Golden Army once again and destroy the human race once and for all.<br /><br />With the recent success of his last film, Del Toro has been given full control over the film, injecting not only his deep sense of mythology but also keeping true to the comics roots, each scene popping with color and wonderous images that only Del Toro could do. Balancing well executed action sequences, crips humor, and visual effects, the film manages to be smooth rather then bogged down by so much material.<br /><br />In fact, 2008 has been a very good year for comic books, with the success of Iron Man in May, and the juggernaut that is The Dark Knight, Hellboy 2 completes the trifecta.</p></br><a href="../users/A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z.html">A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z</a><br/><p>Visually, Viscerally, and in the context of the original fans of HELLBOY, this film is excellent.There is far more detail, far more of the mythos that has been created in other films. At one point in the extras, it is even stated that HELLBOY II is a sequel to PAN'S LABYRINTH, which is kind of odd, because I thought HELLBOY II was a sequel to the First HellBoy. A very extreme fan of Helboy told me that Hellboy II was more true to the HellBoy Series, and it was then that I thought, aha thats why it feels so different. Its not really moving on from the First film, its kind of doubling back and covering ground that maybe the creators thought they should cover in the first film.<br /><br />The characters are more fleshed out in Hellboy II, so in that respect, its more detailed, but I guess it was not what I was expecting, which I guess is good. Since I did enjoy it. And the groundwork is definitely laid for a HELLBOY III if that is ever touted. But in the meantime, this is a pretty good show. The Visuals are great, the audio is great... its a Great experience, however it IS very different to the first HELLBOY.<br />The Triple disc is worth it if you are willing to filter through some drivel. The Commentaries are good, however Del Toro makes it feel like a Film School commentary, but occasionally he does get entertaining, which is odd, because his Documentary material is mostly good. I say mostly good, but some of it on disc 2 is bordering on boring.The Commentary on disc one is mostly fun, but anything with Selma Blair is kind of nice to listen to, no matter what, but I guess I  have a bias. The rest of the DVD extras expand on the rather contradictory theme of the sometimes<br />good, sometimes boring theme, but nothing inbetween. Del Toro's work seems to specialise in polarising any fans.<br /><br />Regardless, the end product here is great, and to a large extent, seeing how Del Toro got that product is very Fascinating. Also, the Digital Copy goes great on the Classic 120 Gig Ipod, with Great Sound.<br />If you are lucky enough to get the Special Pack from BEST BUY, the Bonus Model and Documents are extremely cool... well worth another 40 bucks or so.</p></br><a href="../users/A2IZIYYCEGOMEU.html">A2IZIYYCEGOMEU</a><br/><p>I very much loved the first HELLBOY movie, but the sequel made nightmares beautiful ( which has become something of a trademark of Guillermo Del Toro's ). The sets, costumes, makeup, and lighting were sumptuous, mysterious, and lush.<br /><br />I generally find most comic book characters to be rather cardboardish when they're transferred to celluloid, or plastic ( HANCOCK comes to mind, or the FEEBLE 4 ). Ron Perlman , Selma Blair, and Doug Jones managed to make their characters breathe. Luke Goss was fascinating as Prince Nuada, and Anna Walton was equally captivating as his twin sister.<br /><br />I was particularly drawn to the dichotomies in the plot. The best example of this, I believe, is Prince Nuada, a character that is quite as much an anti-hero as Hellboy ( Perlman ), though he is utterly ruthless in his methods of dealing with the 'greedy humans,' even killing his own father in a last ditch attempt ( as he obviously sees things ) to save the world he loves.<br /><br />Although there are pathos in it, there is quite a bit of humor in this film ( HELLBOY, and Abe drunkenly crooning along to an insipid Barry Manilow song was hilarious ). The action was fun, and a lot less CGI-heavy than most action films based on comic books today seem to be.<br /><br />I enjoyed it as much as V FOR VENDETTA, or DARK CITY.</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>It ain't easy being red. Hellboy returns in Guillermo del Toro's sequel facing his most daunting task yet--he has to prevent Elf Prince Nuada(Luke Goss)from awakening the Golden Army--mechanical warriors his father had created before the peace with humanity. It seems that Nuada feels its time to take down the human race but to control the Golden Army he needs to retrieve the three sections of a special crown one which his father has, another section was given to humanity while the last piece belongs to his sister Princess Nuala (Anna Walton) who is against her brother's decision to go to war. As with the first movie Hellboy (Ron Perlman)and his team mates Liz (Selma Blair), Abe Sapiens (Doug Jones who does the voice for Abe in this film)and new team leader Dr. Krauss (voiced by Seth MacFarlane of "Family Guy" fame)find themselves unappreciated by the humans they try and save.<br /><br />The latest film from del Toro like all of his films has a distinctive look and feel to it unlike films by other directors. Written by del Toro (from a story by del Toro and Hellboy creator Mike Mignola), the second film has a much larger scope with some truly stunning and funny scenes including the scene where Hellboy must face Wink a giant with a metal hand in the Troll Market and the stunning conclusion which relies largely on CGI.<br /><br />The DVD comes packed with a lot of extras. We get a commentary track from del Toro on the first disc, a tour of the Troll Market with del Toro as well as a feature length documentary on the production of the film included on the second disc. There are also deleted scenes and an animated comic book included as part of the package.<br /><br />The DVD looks extremely good with bright vivid colors and a nice, sharp looking transfer. What really makes this shine,though, are the special features where del Toro lets you see everything from his "Director's Notebook" to production sketches prepared for the film. Fans can also read the original script and print it up if they have access to a DVD-Rom drive.<br /><br />"Hellboy II: The Golden Army" might not have had the critical acclaim of "Batman: The Dark Knight" but it has its own distinctive look and is equally as entertaining without the "dark" baggage of Chris Nolan's terrific film. This is a terrifically entertaining film with loads of extras and I'm recommend it to fans of the first film as well as those who haven't stepped into Hellboy's world (although I'd recommend the first film before watching this but it isn't a prerequisite).</p></br><a href="../users/AHABFECTNE15I.html">AHABFECTNE15I</a><br/><p>Version: U.S.A / Region A, B(?), C(?)<br />Aspect ratio: 1.85:1<br />MPEG-4 AVC BD-50<br />High Profile 4.1 (Main Video) / High Profile 3.2 (U-Control/BonusView)<br />Running time: 1:59:48<br />Movie size: 27,63 GB<br />Disc size: 44,80 GB<br />Average video bit rate: 20.98 Mbps<br />Number of chapters: 20<br />Subtitles: English SDH / French / Spanish<br /><br />DTS-HD Master Audio  English  5284 kbps  7.1 / 48kHz / 24-bit / 5284kbps (DTS Core: 5.1 / 48kHz / 24-bit / 1536kbps)<br />DTS Audio  French  768 kbps  5.1 / 48kHz / 24-bit / 768kbps<br />DTS Audio  Spanish  768 kbps  5.1 / 48kHz / 24-bit / 768kbps<br />Dolby Digital Audio  English  192 kbps  2.0 / 48kHz / 192kbps<br />Dolby Digital Audio  English  192 kbps  2.0 / 48kHz / 192kbps<br />DTS  English  192 kbps  2.0 / 48kHz / 192kbps<br /><br />#Audio Commentary with Director<br />#Audio Commentary with Cast Members<br />#Troll Market Tour with Guillermo del Toro (12 minutes)<br />#Animated Zinco Epilogue Comic (5 minutes)<br />#Deleted Scenes with Optional Commentary by director Guillermo del Toro (5 minutes)<br />#U-Control<br />#BD-Live<br />--My Scenes<br />--BD-Live Center<br />--Comic Book Builder<br />#DVD Digital Copy</p></br><a href="../users/A16QODENBJVUI1.html">A16QODENBJVUI1</a><br/><p>Warning! Spoilers abound!<br /><br />Gradually over the past several years Guillermo del Toro has emerged as arguably the finest creator of fantastical films in the world. Now that he has been tagged to direct the two-part HOBBIT he has the opportunity to cement that reputation. Even without that, however, he has a string of remarkable films behind him. His finest film remains PAN'S LABYRINTH. He has also made both of the HELLBOY films, the stunning Spanish language THE DEVIL'S BACKBONE, the second (and best) part of the BLADE trilogy, and the absolutely terrifying horror film MIMIC. Others can boast two or three such films, but few so many or of such high quality.<br /><br />HELLBOY II was, if anything, even more enjoyable than the first film. del Toro focuses less on plot than on the interrelations between the various characters and the way that affects things. Their superheroic adventures by contrast serve as mere interruptions to that. The central conflict in the film is Liz's unhappiness in her relationship with Hellboy and her hesitation in telling her that she is pregnant. This is the issue they all refocus on when not having to deal with saving the world from destruction by the Golden Army. But it reminds us that whatever else the characters are despite their astonishing gifts, they are persons as well, with the kinds of concerns that people have.<br /><br />One of my favorite characters in the Hellboy films is Abe Sapien, marvelously portrayed by the astonishing Doug Jones. Over the years Jones, a mime by training, has carved out a career as perhaps the best-known physical actor in Hollywood. If you need a character that needs to move in remarkable fashion, Jones is often called upon to bring them to life. For instance, though Laurence Fishburne voiced the Silver Surfer, Jones provided the template for the CGI imaging. Fans of BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER will remember him as the taller of the two main Gentlemen in the classic Season Four episode "Hush." But no one has used Jones as effectively as del Toro. He has been not only played Abe Sapien in the Hellboy movies, but several other characters as well. And in PAN'S LABYRINTH Jones portrayed both the Fawn of the title (which is not, by the way, Pan -- that was added only to the English translation of the title -- in most other languages the film is simply THE LABYRINTH OF THE FAWN) as well as the Pale Man who haunts the girl with his eye balls in the palms of his hands. I'm sure del Toro will find a place for him in THE HOBBIT as well. Actually, I'm fairly certain he'll find several places.<br /><br />There were just so many things that I enjoyed about this film. Many of these were small touches, such as the battle Hellboy has beside the Brooklyn Bridge with the Elemental, while holding a small baby. As a viewer knowing what he does not (that Liz is pregnant with his child), one realizes that he might make a better father than one might initially suppose. I also loved the way that while the film utilizes staggering amounts of CGI, it is never used more than is necessary. The CGI is used in service of the story; the film is not merely a vehicle for CGI, which is the case with, say, TRANSFORMERS and SPEED RACER.<br /><br />The summer of 2008 could well be remembered as the summer of the superhero film. It started off with IRON MAN, progressed to THE INCREDIBLE HULK and HELLBOY II, and finally to THE DARK KNIGHT. Well, OK, there was also HANCOCK. But those four good films are easily the best batch of superhero movies ever to be released in a single summer. All signs are that they will receive considerable competition in the future. Barring success by 20th Century Fox's lawsuit attempting to ban its release, THE WATCHMEN is slated for a Spring 2009 release. Marvel now has its own production company and has announced future films based on Thor, the Runaways (my personal favorites in all the Marvel Universe), the Avengers, and Captain America, as well as sequels to Iron Man and The Hulk. DC has lagged behind Marvel in the quality and quantity of its properties coming to light (THE DARK KNIGHT notwithstanding), but I have little doubt that they will start taking steps to correct that. Over the past 20 years the comics that DC has put out, especially under its Vertigo imprint, has been far superior to Marvel. The problem is that those titles are by and large more complex and darker. Marvel may not have anything quite as stunning as Gaiman's Sandman series or Y: THE LAST MAN (which is rumored to be under development as a film project) or Willingham's FABLES or Ellis's TRANSMETROPOLITAN, but as great as these are as comics, they may not have the mass movie appeal of the Marvel titles. Time will tell.</p></br><a href="../users/AN9J46667D80O.html">AN9J46667D80O</a><br/><p>Here we have the sequel to the first Hellboy film. It's one of those rare sequels that exceeds the original in almost every way. The acting is quite good, the makeup and costumes are spectacular (and will probably get an Oscar nomination). The pacing is great, and the story is reasonably compelling.<br /><br />All of this, however, takes a backseat for me when compared to the incredibly beautiful scenes put up onto the screen by director Guillermo del Toro. Here is a man who, as previously demonstrated with Pan's Labyrinth,is someone who really understands the magic of cinema and its ability to show things no one has ever seen before.<br /><br />Consider, for example, the fate of the giant plant monster that attacks New York City. There's a number of ways the conclusion to the fight between it and Hellboy played out, but who would have expected such a beautiful end? And in a different way, look at what you get up on screen during the encounter with the Golden Army itself. Check out the Troll Market, which might rival the Cantina Scene in Star Wars for sheer creativity in makeup design. Marvel at the beauty of the Throne Room for the elves (marvel slightly less at the fact that the bad guy in the movie basically just another Sephiroth cosplayer).<br /><br />There is, as I said, some good acting, a good story, and some great dialogue in this movie, but what will stay in my mind are the incredible images up on the screen, and given what a visual medium film is, I'd say that's a pretty good thing.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>Before I start I need to explain something about why I rated this film the way I did. First let me say that I'm a pretty big fan of both Guillermo del Toro and the original <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OT6V00">Hellboy</a> film. Ron Perlman was perfectly cast in the title role and I wouldn't wish that changed for the world. The first film (also directed by del Toro) had a pretty cool story about the beginnings of Hellboy and the organization he would eventually belong to. Let me say that again, the STORY was cool. That's important, because when you get right down to it, films must have that to carry them through to audiences.<br /><br />A friend of mine said that if I loved <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WSLAUO">Pan's Labyrinth</a> that I'd love this film. Well, he was wrong. I did love Pan's Labyrinth. A lot. In fact, it was probably the best film of 2006. It won BAFTA awards and three Oscars and a gaggle of others, so the critics seemed to agree with me on that point. But Hellboy II didn't fair so well. Sure, it got one nod from the Academy (for make-up, though), but little else; not that I'd expect a comic book-to-film story to garner much critical acclaim amongst the snobby elite of Hollywood-dom. But here's the thing: It could have! Take a look at things like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GAPC1K">Iron Man</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GZ6QEC">The Dark Knight</a> and you'll see what I mean (sometimes the snobs are forced to take note of these otherwise overlooked gems whenever they're done with extreme care ...and I mean E-X-T-R-E-M-E!). So what was the problem? you may be asking. First let's look at what wasn't the problem.<br /><br />Guillermo MUST be recognized as a visual artist. The sets and camera shots and costumes were very much on-par with what I expect from him (i.e., Pan's Labyrinth quality). The troll's market scenes were worth the price of admission alone! Stunningly dark, dreary but equally enthralling and uniquely beautiful. The Elfin lands and flashbacks were also well-done giving us a bit of history about the war between humans and elves.<br /><br />But we need more than history and battles to make a great film. We need originality, and this is where the film fell short for me. Looking more like a side-story for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000654ZK0">The Lord of the Rings</a>, the history of elves and men have been done ad nauseam (in both literature and film). Although del Toro tried to put a unique spin on the story by incorporating the elves as split between being nice to humans and wanting them all dead, the story really never found traction for me. This was due, in great part, by the incorporation of two love stories. One we're already aware of between Perlman's Hellboy and the firebranding Liz (Selma Blair), and the other comes as a bit of a surprise (and ends up nowhere, really). To me, del Toro could've easily excised this second love story and extended the history behind Hellboy and/or extended our understanding of why the division between the human-hating elves and the human-loving ones was so wide (I understand some of this was due to the twin elves' father, but much of it is not). We're supposed to assume (or so I assume!) that one of the elves is just flat-out evil for the sake of being evil. Not good storytelling.<br /><br />So there you have it. I liked the film as a diversion, but I wasn't at all captivated as I was with the first Hellboy. Story, story, story. It's so important. I hope that with the next Hellboy flick (and I really hope there is another because I WILL watch it) that del Toro directs again and can give us a fresh story with the amazing visuals we've come to appreciate from him.</p></br><a href="../users/A16QODENBJVUI1.html">A16QODENBJVUI1</a><br/><p>Warning!

Not to mention forthcoming travels to Middle-Earth.<br /><br />So you know he has the skills to pit Mike Mignola's scarlet anti-hero against an army of fairies and elves, and not make it silly. Instead, it's a spectacular dark fantasy full of humor, action, quirky appeal, romance, and some truly astounding special effects. But what really shoves this movie over the top is Del Toro's brilliant direction, and the stunning performance by Ron Perlman.<br /><br />Decades ago, Professor Broom (William Hurt) told a small Hellboy a yuletide bedtime story about the Elf King Balor and his unstoppable Golden Army, and how the crown that controls the Army was split into thirds and divided among fairies and humans.<br /><br />Well, you can't really expect that kind of power to never be revived.<br /><br />Cut to current day. Hellboy (Perlman), Liz (Selma Blair) and Abe (Doug Jones) investigate a strange supernatural attack on an auction house, where the archeological curiosity known as the Crown of Bethmoora was being sold -- only to be attacked by savage tooth fairies. Turns out the crown was stolen by Prince Nuada (Luke Goss), a resentful young elf who is determined to take the world back from humanity -- using, of course, the Golden Army.<br /><br />And while Hellboy chafes against strict new commander Johann Krauss (a suit filled with ectoplasm), Abe encounters Nuada's sister, Princess Nuala -- who also happens to have the last third of the crown. But Nuada will not allow anyone to oppose him as he searches for the Golden Army's location, and Hellboy and his friends must venture into a strange, ancient kingdom to stop him from destroying all of humanity.<br /><br />The worst you can say about "Hellboy II: The Golden Army" is that it sticks to the formula of the demonic outsider with a dark destiny, and his continuing romantic woes. There's some retreading as Hellboy realizes anew that he'll never fit into the world of humans, because he's big and red and has horns and a tail. Okay, we got it. Next big psychological issue!<br /><br />Fortunately those flaws are relatively minor ones. Del Toro is still able to spin a dark, twisted story with some truly bizarre creatures (the utterly alien, eye-winged Angel of Death), clockpunk robots, trippy underground goblin markets and a new BPRD agent who is basically ectoplasm in a suit. And for the action scenes, Del Toro does not pull punches when it comes to the smashing action scenes -- giant thrashing vines and a one-on-one duel with Nuada are among the highlights.<br /><br />With all this going on, it would be easy to neglect the characters. But Del Toro packs the script with solid snappy dialogue and some poignantly romantic moments -- including some pretty startling actions from dear ol' Abe. And he also adds little moments to this epic story that remind us that these are supposed to be people -- such as Hellboy's bickering with Krauss, or Abe and Hellboy getting drunk and having a little Manilow singalong together. It's just so cute.<br /><br />But what really sets this movie apart is the "children of the Earth." No flitting Victorian sprites -- these are creatures that are weird, grotesque, dangerous and immensely powerful, from nasty little tooth fairies up to vast rock monsters and plant gods. There's an alien, bizarre aesthetic to these creatures that feels wholly real, as if Neil Gaiman casually dropped a few sketches onto the drawing board.<br /><br />But as amazing as the visuals are, Del Toro never neglects the characters. Perlman is perfect for the role of "big Red" -- he's gruff, sarcastic, moody, but also endearing and self-deprecatingly likable. There are more hints of his potentially dark future, and he faces some delicately-handed temptations. But Big Red's good heart is still very much in the forefront, no matter how much human beings fear him.<br /><br />Blair gives a more lively performance here as a spunkier Liz, who also has some surprising developments in store. Jones is pitch-perfect as the fish-man, who experiences the first pangs of young love for Nuala, while Goss gives a chilling, whispery performance as a rebel prince who is willing to do whatever it takes -- even kill family -- if it helps him restore the fey kingdom. Pretty good villain, since he clearly isn't trying to be bad.<br /><br />And for a bare-bones edition of a movie, this one is actually quite good. There's audio commentary with Del Toro, Selma Blair, Luke Goss and Jeffrey Tambor, a series of mini-documentaries, and Del Toro's guidance through both deleted scenes and the creation of the amazing Troll Market. Also stills, production information, a comic book builder, and so forth. Not half bad, and gives viewers a pleasant look into the creation of the more interesting parts of the movie.<br /><br />"Hellboy II: The Golden Army" is a wild, darkly ornate ride through the world of half-forgotten gods and fey.

There's an alien, bizarre aesthetic to these creatures that feels wholly real, as if Neil Gaiman casually dropped a few sketches onto the drawing board.<br /><br />But as amazing as the visuals are, Del Toro never neglects the characters. Perlman is perfect for the role of "big Red" -- he's gruff, sarcastic, moody, but also endearing and self-deprecatingly likable. There are more hints of his potentially dark future, and he faces some delicately-handed temptations. But Big Red's good heart is still very much in the forefront, no matter how much human beings fear him.<br /><br />Blair gives a more lively performance here as a spunkier Liz, who also has some surprising developments in store. Jones is pitch-perfect as the fish-man, who experiences the first pangs of young love for Nuala, while Goss gives a chilling, whispery performance as a rebel prince who is willing to do whatever it takes -- even kill family -- if it helps him restore the fey kingdom. Pretty good villain, since he clearly isn't trying to be bad.<br /><br />The features on the fullscreen release appear to be pretty much identical to the widescreen, except for, y'know, the lack of visual width. There's audio commentary with Del Toro, Selma Blair, Luke Goss and Jeffrey Tambor, a series of mini-documentaries, and Del Toro's guidance through both deleted scenes and the creation of the amazing Troll Market. Also stills, production information, a comic book builder, and so forth. It's pretty good for the "bare bones" edition.<br /><br />"Hellboy II: The Golden Army" is a wild, darkly ornate ride through the world of half-forgotten gods and fey. While it has a few flaws, those are far outweighed by the brilliant of Del Toro's vision.</p></br><a href="../users/AK0CENM3LUM28.html">AK0CENM3LUM28</a><br/><p>Hellboy 2 / B001F7MSFM<br /><br />*Spoilers*<br /><br />Disclaimer: I liked Hellboy 1. There, I said it. I went into it expecting it to be a fairly lame superhero movie, but the action was cool, the  villains were nicely creepy, and we got a chick who could set herself on fire, which is more than you get from most movies. So I was looking forward to Hellboy 2, but in that wary, don't-get-your-hopes-up kind of way.<br /><br />Ugh. The only redeeming thing about Hellboy 2 is that it proves the adage that "a man who will die for you is nice, but a man who will live for you is better". Proving that Hollywood, once again, cannot portray a committed couple that isn't constantly fighting, Hellboy and Blair have "moved in" together, but Hellboy continues to be his slovenly self (he'll die for her, but he won't pick up after his eighteen cats) and Blair has been reduced by the sexist writers into a screaming hag who sets the apartment on fire twice a week because she doesn't get her way, rather than doing the sensible thing and maintaining a separate apartment, and/or getting a new superhero boyfriend to hang with. (Of course, also true to Hollywood form, an unplanned pregnancy will solve all these problems, since pregnancies ALWAYS strengthen rocky relationships, right?)<br /><br />If the movie wasn't unsympathetic enough to Blair, we ramp up the sexism with a character that SHOULD have been useful for more than just plot exposition and yet, bafflingly, is not. The Evil Prince, our antagonist, has a twin - a Good Princess - of royal blood, and with an interesting twist: whatever wounds one twin sustains, the other twin suffers from as well. This is a very interesting plot device, and the ending seems like it would almost write itself - the Good Princess needs to challenge the Evil Prince for control of the royal army. The Princess has the royal standing to challenge for control (only a member of royal blood may issue the challenge) and the fight for control would be an eternal stalemate - the Prince cannot harm or kill the Princess without harming or killing himself. The result would be haunting, poignant, tragic, as she and he stand down each other silently, for eternity, until their long lives run out, as the golden army patiently rusts around them, waiting for a victor that will never be declared.<br /><br />Instead...the Princess is relegated to a secondary character, as Hellboy challenges the Prince instead. This makes no sense. The "royal" standing that Hellboy has to challenge is, uh, the fact that he's the son of the Prince of Darkness. Mmkay. And since killing the Prince would be kind of churlish (as it will kill the Princess as well), the movie makers allow Hellboy to lose and the Princess to commit suicide as a Deus Ex Machina to bring the movie mercifully to a close. I guess they decided an "exciting" fight scene between Hellboy and the Prince would be cooler than a thoughtful showdown between the two twins, but I thought the change was a terrible one.<br /><br />Beyond that, nothing to see here. Blair is, as noted, annoying and Goth-y. Doug Jones returns as Abe Sapien, and yet manages to sound like a completely different person - I had to double-check that it was the same actor for both movies. The returning "tension" between Hellboy and his handlers is old hat, and the new monsters (and, indeed, the new plot) doesn't contain the same level of creepiness and terror we had in the original. I might watch the third movie, if they make it, because I'm mildly intrigued in the concept that Blair is now pregnant with the one destined to end our world, but I seriously hope they get some fresh writers.<br /><br />This version provides a closed caption option for the hard of hearing.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll</p></br><a href="../users/A2MNMZMM6BGLTA.html">A2MNMZMM6BGLTA</a><br/><p>I am a big fan of the comic and of the first movie. I must say that this movie rocked! It was excellent and I loved it from beginning to end. Johann Krauss was a hilarious addition to the BPRD!!!</p></br><a href="../users/AHBNPMHDWZ7SB.html">AHBNPMHDWZ7SB</a><br/><p>Hellboy II: The Golden Army is the second entry in the movie adaptations of the cult classic Dark Horse graphic novel arc. It's also a solid reminder of the beautiful mind that director/scribe Guillermo del Tor has. Honestly, I've never been a fan of the comics or the director, but the Hellboy films do a very good job of making you a fan of his. They perfectly compliment his directing style, and artistic preferences. These are some of the best Fantasy films you're going to find out there, and some of the best looking Blu-ray presentations to boot. The cinematography is just gorgeous throughout the entire film. There is a perfect blend of colors, surrounded in darkness that really excites the eyes and sucks you into this magical world. In this magical world live some of the most intriguing creatures that I have ever seen on film. I would even go as far as to say that the creatures in the Hellboy movies are the most original and interesting that I have seen since the Star Wars and Lord of the Rings trilogies. And that says a lot, in fact, much more than "a lot" in the day and age where nothing original is being produced.<br /><br />Adding to the artistic brilliance of the film is the score. The music flows perfectly in sync with the story and characters' emotion on screen. Danny Elfman adds another to his list of noteworthy comic book movie scores. The most notible remains Spider-man in my book (even better than Batman). The acting is very good as well. Is there any other role that Ron Perlman was born to play besides this comedic, yet conflicted tough guy? He was really good in the first Hellboy, but in this one he looks so comfortable in the make-up, as if it is his own skin. My favorite character from the first was the assassin, Kroenen. With him dead and gone, Abe Sapien (Doug Jones) fills that void. He provides laughs, without coming off as a corny joke. Which could have easily happened if the actor was not up for the task of making that character respectable. Besides those two characters, there are other great performances as well. Most notibly, Luke Goss as the evil elf prince, Nuada. I love it when directors allow actors who are real martial artists to play characters that are also martial artists. I also liked (and hated) Jeffrey Tambor as Tom Manning. Even I wanted to punch that guy. Selam Blair was not bad at all, but she did not impress me either. Who did impress me was whoever played Johann Krauss. I believe his voice was done by the family guy himself, mister Seth Macfarlane. Now that all of that is out of the way, let's get to what really matters in every summer superhero blockbuster, the action!<br /><br />It is simply amazing. The stuntwork is on par with that of my personal favorite martial artist/actor Ray Park (Snake Eyes/Darth Maul). All of the combat is well choreographed, and the visual effects are even better. All I can say is that I am extremely anxious to see what Guillermo del Toro does with The Hobbit. Peter Jackson can step aside and be assured that his franchise in in very good hands. On a completely different side note, I want to point out the great little Universal easter eggs. I went to Universal Studios today so it's fresh on my mind. I noticed (but their not really hidden) a few quick cameos of a few of the original Universal monsters (The Wolfman, Frankenstein and The Creature of the Black Lagoon) on various television screens throughout the movie. That probally doesn't matter to anyone else, but I thought it was pretty cool. All there is to say about the audio and video on this disc is that they're perfectly captured to deliver one of the best transfers I've ever seen. And to my shock, the extras are as thorough as an anniversary edition that one would expect to see decades down the road. Overall, I obviously love this movie. And even if you aren't as enthusiastic about it as I am, no one can deny the quality of this package.</p></br><a href="../users/A1P98DMX8YUSNW.html">A1P98DMX8YUSNW</a><br/><p>This is one of the noisiest fantasy films I've seen, the soundtrack all crashes and smashes and busting glass almost constantly throughout. The visuals are a feast, though, with much more going on than in many films of this genre. I'm not a big fan of Ron Perlman's Hellboy character, since he's the only one that looks really fake. The plot and the dialogue are secondary to the look. If you enjoy these types of comic book movies, this one should not disappoint, though it's exhausting to keep up with all the non-stop action.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ6SV7LDSMGBE.html">AQ6SV7LDSMGBE</a><br/><p>Film is fine.

The "Stars Wars" bar scene inspired "Troll Market," was just a plethora of far out characters in a far out world! I especially loved, "I'm not a baby. I'm a tumor." LOL! The other is the scene with Red & Abe, where they remorse over the loves of their lives while drinking beer. Both were hilarious in this scene, but Abe really stole the show here, but then again, when they both started singing along to Barry Manilow, it was a moment of pure comedic genius! I busted a gut on this one!<br /><br />Ron Perlman just owns every role I've seen him in, & this may be my favorite yet! That is not to say the cast was not uniformly excellent, as they were! I could not picture a better cast for this film, all had memorable parts, lines, & the acting was top notch, especially Luke Goss, as Prince Nuada! His determination to save his world, his obvious vulnerability for the love of his sister, yet willing to sacrifice her & himself for his cause, was quite a performance, though tragic, to behold! To bad I've not seen him in more films, though he was particularly good in "Blade II," as "Nomak" who spread the Reaper virus through out the Vampires. A role not unlike his in "Hellboy II."<br /><br />"Hellboy II" looks & sounds magnificent on Blu-ray! It's razzle dazzle special effects, it's beautiful palette of colors, & it's superior overall cinematography is a site to behold in high definition! The sound was deep & resonating!<br /><br />"Hellboy II" is a must for everyone's inner child fantasy!<br /><br />5 Stars = Masterpiece<br /><br />5 stars out of 5 = Masterpiece</p></br><a href="../users/A8G9GETA2OLMZ.html">A8G9GETA2OLMZ</a><br/><p>I liked Hellboy 1, but Hellboy II is even better.<br /><br />Del Toro is amazing.  He can take a pretty weak premise (evil character wants to rouse an evil army to take over the world) and transform it into a stunning, in fact moving, story.<br /><br />The characters--usually stereotypes in this kind of movie--have great depth.  The plot clips right along from one surprise to the next, but all seems to hold together, and the sets!  Whoa.  The sets are spectacular.<br /><br />The Extra on the DVD about sets is amazing.<br /><br />Del Toro has both de-emphasized Hellboy in this one, and focused more on Abe Sapien.  The romance between Abe and the Princess grows as Hellboy's with Liz declines (or seems to decline).<br /><br />And Hellboy, in his conflict with his new boss Krauss, in his drunken binge, and his SINGING (!) becomes even more likable.<br /><br />This is great stuff.  I don't think I have ever sat through a Barry Manilow song before without squirming, but in this one I was riveted.<br /><br />Funny, charming, breathless, interesting.</p></br></body></html>

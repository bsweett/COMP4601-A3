The video looks handsome in its scenes of Eastern academia, fall colors warm but a bit flat at times. The nightmarish cold war scenes impart a definite chill with midnight-rendezvous blacks and cobalt blues. True flesh tones help sell Greg Cannom's often terrific makeup work. <p>James Horner's swirling, math-inspired music sinks deep subwoofer roots via the Dolby Digital. The dialogue sounds muffled at times. Star Russell Crowe, in particular, seems to swallow more than a few lines, but it sounds like a mix or production issue. The problem can be mitigated by hiking your center speaker volume -- a fix that's a [bad] throwback to the early days of the DVD format. On Howard's commentary, the review disc's center track took a sudden leap in volume (at 1:49). Surround was OK but not much of a factor.<p> In his commentary, Howard does not address the various controversies surrounding "A Beautiful Mind" and its many fictions, but he shares some of the internal debates over the film's tricky "delusional" scenes. He points out clues planted along the way for those working on the movie's mysteries, "wondering if we were going to get caught." While Howard works hard at being a good host, his understated commentary does become hard to sit through as the movie passes two hours. Screenwriter Akiva Goldsman, whose adaptation won the Oscar, seems more at home with the commentary process. He does, however, repeat many of Howard's observations. The special features include some interesting shots of Crowe and Nash on the set, looking like bookends of a life. The section on makeup (the characters age a half century) is fascinating.</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>The new generations barely are aware about the existence of " Fareneheit 451" , a fundamental sci-fi text written by Ray Bradbury, that carves in relief the chilling reality of a recent future, where the increasing frivolity of the modern times makes most of us simply have no time to read and so we have to conform with the reading of history without words; I mean the human knowledge reduced to cartoons, futile candies for a funny entertainment and pop corn images that vaguely intend to depict the complex and fascinating universe of the culture. Maybe Ray Bradbury had smiled quietly when he saw for the first time a video clip don' t you?<br /><br />When you try to adapt the personal universe of such complex mind in order to intend to seduce the masses through a sugary plot, you are committing a moral crime, due the nestled reality of any human being may not be told with such linearity; even the humblest person in the world has his likes and dislikes, contradictions, phobias and little sins, because the innocence - in its purest state - is exclusive property of the saints.<br /><br />In this sense, if you want to get close to a light approach of a brilliant mind, then go and astonish by yourself, but at the moment you leave the hall you, don' think you have become aware about the life and times of this man; barely you have explored the anecdotic character, and nothing else.<br /><br />Brilliant performances.</p></br><a href="../users/A16X61RLY1YJL7.html">A16X61RLY1YJL7</a><br/><p>As we all know, hollywood takes a true story and adds some embellishment to it.  That said, this film is one of the classics.  Russell Crowe again shows why he's making the money he is to do a movie.  Ron Howard's direction is admirable.  A wonderful movie about life, the struggles that some people have to get through and move on.  I would suggest this movie to anybody who enjoys what movies are all about.</p></br><a href="../users/ALR35EFI69S5R.html">ALR35EFI69S5R</a><br/><p>It is clear from a viewing of this very good film what Hollywood found so intriguing and so fascinating about the life of Nobel laureate John Nash. It is indeed a life that was distinguished by a raging plethora of contradictory qualities and experiences, and one in which much was suffered and yet much gained. Thus it was by virtue of the very range of these seemingly irreconcilable aspects to his complicated, convoluted, and extremely troubled existence that his story was deemed to be so irresistible that they gave it the "whole Hollywood treatment".  In a phrase, then, in the movie industry's judgment Doctor Nash was notably nuts, and was a distinguished Noble Prize-winning nutcase at that. And, oh, how Hollywood loves to romanticize such accomplished, misunderstood and unlikable miscreants. <p>That much said, the acting was quite good, and the director truly was inspired, and deserved an Oscar for his work. For he does deliver an immensely entertaining and enormously interesting piece of work here, however badly it may misrepresent the true and authentic set of situations it is portending to recreate. Using a barrelful of creative license, Ron Howard deep sixes the accuracy of the events to weave a lovely period piece about love, intellect, and madness. So too, Russell Crowe's acting delivers a powerful testimony to the agony of his afflictions, yet it too is so stylized and so pushed along by special effects that somehow we wind up feeling almost envious of the protagonist's beautiful hallucinations of a world far more singularly novel, photogenic and breath-taking than the one the majority of us seem to inhabit day in and day out. <p>Jennifer Connelly is stunning and lovely, and her victory at winning the Academy Award speaks volumes for how little is expected of actresses in some dramatic roles. So, while I liked the movie for what it was, I was disappointed to find it such a sugary and sentimental representation of the events as they actually transpired. The story was often uneven and disjointed, so while my interest was maintained, I would be less than candid if I didn't say that I thought it a bit too long and at points a bit belabored.  A good movie, but in my humble estimation  hardly a great movie. Glad to see Ron Howard win the Oscar, but did not think this was the best he has ever done. Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A267IXCC7UK1HY.html">A267IXCC7UK1HY</a><br/><p>A moving and memorable film. . .<br /><br />This is an unforgettable record of the progression of schizophrenia in a mathematical genius, and then the partial recovery. Very touching and disturbing, and a very worthwhile movie brilliantly performed by Crowe Russel.</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>Schizophrenia is a mental illness that most Americans know very little about. Schizophrenia is such a complex mental illness that it is quite difficult even to explain and discuss with those who are uneducated about it. Symptons are varied and each person is affected differently. In A BEAUTIFUL MIND, Ron Howard has pulled off an Oscar-worthy job of exploring one man's struggle with the illness through the life of Nobel Prize winner, John Nash. The film skips a great deal of Nash's life. However, in the two and a half hours that the movie runs, the audience is caught up in the life and mentality of Nash. No film can truly do justice to a person's life and achievements. However, movies can educate and inform us of greatness within our midst that would go otherwise unnoticed. A BEAUTIFUL MIND is such a film. Contrary to what some have suggested, the film deals with schizophrenia in a tasteful and thoughtful manner, illumining the audience to the false reality that schizophrenics exist within.<br />Russell Crowe is once again superb and earned another Oscar nomination with his performance of Nash. Though he is often cast as a matinee-idol-type star, films like this illustrate his skill and display that he has become one of Hollywood's elite not solely because of his looks (aka Tom Cruise), but because of his talent.<br /><br />Jennifer Connelly also pulls of an Oscar-worthy performance as Nash's wife. I've been a fan of Connelly since her early days starring in LABYRINTH and it's great to finally see her beginning to receive the recognition she deserves. She more than holds her own against the strong charisma of Russell Crowe.<br /><br />The movie does not have a great deal of time to deal with the relationship between Nash and his wife. Nevertheless, the film briefly touches upon their relationship without becoming sappy.<br /><br />Overall, a wonderful movie with great acting, exploring the horror of schizophrenia and the power of love.</p></br><a href="../users/ANGH6401L9Y0T.html">ANGH6401L9Y0T</a><br/><p>This is the story of John Forbes Nash, Jr. (Russell Crowe), a brilliant mathematician and economist who did amazing original work. My own diagnosis of him during the early part of the movie was Asperger's Syndrome, but eventually the diagnosis of schizophrenia is fully justified. Until we get pretty far into the story, the audience doesn't know any more than Dr. Nash does about what is real and what is hallucination. So having given that tiny clue, amuse yourself by trying to guess. Chances are you will be at least partly wrong.<br /><br />But as the movie also makes clear, a brilliant mind is not proof against mental illness, and indeed may be at least part of the cause. It might be interesting to look up some statistics on that, but not right now. Right now the important thing is one woman (Jennifer Connolly) loved him, and stood by him when his illness caused them both a great deal of trouble. She earned the right to be dressed to the nines and sit in an auditorium in Stockholm, applauding and glowing with pride as he was awarded the Nobel Prize for economics. It was for the work he had done long ago, which turned out to have practical implications beyond what even he had considered.<br /><br />It's a very real, very compassionate look at what can go wrong in even a beautiful mind. Maybe even, as I said, more often in a beautiful mind than an ordinary one. Five stars, although at least one of them is for my sense of kinship with Dr. Nash.</p></br><a href="../users/A32T2H8150OJLU.html">A32T2H8150OJLU</a><br/><p>OK, to start with, this film won Academy awards for Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Director (Ron Howard), Best Picture (2002), and Best Supporting Actress (Jennifer Connelly), and Crowe was nominated for Best Actor.  Need I say more?  No, but I will...<br /><br />In this film Crowe portrays the brilliant, but mentally unstable and asocial mathematician John Nash during his years in graduate school and throughout his professional career.  He becomes obsessed with patterns and cryptography, and he is hired to work for the government on a top secret assignment to locate a nuclear weapon that is allegedly being brought into the USA to be detonated by the USSR during the height of the Cold War.<br /><br />Crowe does an AMAZING job portraying Nash, and Connelly is fantastic as his intelligent and long-suffering wife.<br /><br />If you like top-quality drama, intelligent movies, and unexpected twists and turns then you will eat this film up!  After a while even you as a viewer will be wondering what is real and what is part of Nash's imaginary world.<br /><br />5 solid stars.  Kudos to everyone involved.</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>First let's get this out of the way up front; THIS isn't the biography A BEAUTIFUL MIND which focuses on John Nash's genius as well as his flaws. This, instead, focuses on Nash's battle with mental illness. When a director makes a film they have to choose a path to tell a story--unlike a book it's extremely difficult to take a story like Nash's and condense it into a two hour narrative. Director Ron Howard and screenwriter Avika Goldsman chose the most clear pathway (and using a literary device called "the unreliable narrator)--Nash's brilliance in mathematics AND his slide into mental illness.<br /><br />The Blu-ray release from Universal features an exceptional looking high def transfer. Colors are nicely captured. The Blu-ray captures Roger Deakins' photography with good detail and textures.The transfer exhibits the changing color scheme and textures as John Nash becomes increasingly paranoid. Image detail/sharpness is a tad inconsistent but I suspect that has more to do with the intent of the director and Deakins' decisions in how the scenes are photographed. Edge enhancement crops up quite a bit which is distracting but it isn't the worst I've seen in some films.<br /><br />There isn't anything new that I noticed in the special features but it does appear as if almost all of  the extras have been ported over from the regular DVD edition. The only thing I detected as missing were the clips from the Academy Awards. The two commentary tracks are in tact as well featuring director Ron Howard and writer Avika Goldsman. Unfortunately, all of the extras are presented in standard definition.<br /><br />What's clever and works really well in "A Beautiful Mind" is the WAY that Howard and Goldsman have decided to tell the story; they make us identify with shy, charismatic John Nash, realize how brilliant he is, see his experience at the University from HIS perspective. Howard and Goldsman then turn our expectations on its head by demonstrating that much of what WE experienced with Nash may or may not be real and that he suffers from schizophrenia. We discover that a lot of what Nash "knows" to be true isn't at all and that he lives in a world of shadows suggesting reality but often never touching on it.<br /><br />There was plenty of criticism about the fact that "A Beautiful Mind" wasn't faithful to the book of the same name and played down Nash's bisexuality, racism and other personal issues. As fascinating as Nash's life is, the film fictionalizes Nash's experience and focuses on his unexpected journey into madness pulling us, the audience, into the rabbit hole with Nash. It's a clever conceit and one that works well allowing us to both understand Nash, sympathize with him enough so that WE feel like we are sliding down into the same madness that has consumed him.<br /><br />The bottom line is that this is an extremely good upgrade picture wise for "A Beautiful Mind". The film doesn't have a perfect presentation and there are some flaws (such as edge enhancement)but, on the whole, it looks exceptionally good.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>At Princeton University, John Nash struggles to make a worthwhile contribution to serve as his legacy to the world of mathematics. He finally makes a revolutionary breakthrough that will eventually earn him the Nobel Prize. After graduate school he turns to teaching, becoming romantically involved with his student Alicia. Meanwhile the government asks his help with breaking Soviet codes, which soon gets him involved in a terrifying conspiracy plot. Nash grows more and more paranoid until a discovery that turns his entire world upside down. Now it is only with Alicia's help that he will be able to recover his mental strength and regain his status as the great mathematician we know him as today. "A Beautiful Mind" is absolutely great, not only does it have a strong point and an importaint message to the viewer, but it delivers it in a touching and sensitive, partly even humourous kind of way, with the help of powerful actors, a great screenplay and even a few special effects to boost it up. This movie succeeds on every level.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VZLLDNLURGJB.html">A1VZLLDNLURGJB</a><br/><p>A Beautiful Mind (2001)-Imagine learning that the people, places and your most beloved memories never really existed! Best Ron Howard Film to Date.<br /><br />Note that this 1.85:1 DVD played great on a 52" HDTV making Blu-Ray unnecessary.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZVERVFM25MJT.html">A2ZVERVFM25MJT</a><br/><p>Howard's latest movie, and winner of several awards, concerns the genius, home life and mental illness of John Nash (Crowe).  Taking us through his college years up to when he won the Nobel Prize, 'A Beautiful Mind' is an assured, open and often very moving film.  Crowe proves that his performances in 'Gladiator' and 'The Insider' weren't flukes, with a showy but bravely unsympathetic role.  Many decried that playing the madman was an easy option, which maybe would have been the case with any lesser actor, but anyone who watches Crowe in the early scenes, a bumbling, nervous, self-righteous college graduate can testify that this was certainly no easy option.  Indeed, shrugging off the action stereotype that might have come with his last role was surely no easy feat but Crowe makes you forget Maximus of Spain completely here.<p>Of course, that isn't wishing to forget the dazzling tour de force that is Jennifer Connelly.  Watching her act, the word 'actress of a generation' often springs to mind, and like Crowe she has proven her determination not to be typecast.  Her role here is as far removed from her performance as drug-addled Marion Crane in 'Requiem For A Dream' as it could possibly be.  A lesser performer may have been tempted to simply allow the script do the work (after all, she could basically have been a mere housewife) but it is in the reflection of Nash's madness in his wife's eyes that makes it so horrific.  You get the feeling that the occasionally unrealistic portrayal of schizofrenia have been made more romantic (there is only about one hospital scene) so as to ensure that the movie's rating was kept down.  However, through two magnificent performances the audience is allowed a real insight into not just how madness affects one person but the people around him.<p>Whilst Howard's earlier movies such as 'Apollo 13' were assured but ultimately formulaic, he really shows himself to be a very talented director indeed on this which is probably his best film to date.  Thankfully rather than wallowing in period detail he wisely chooses to take it slow, injecting a good deal of characterisation and a very honest and therefore moving portrayal of a relationship on the edge.  Even if this doesn't quite rank up there with 'Hilary And Jackie', it is still one of the best biopics of recent years and a milestone for all concerned.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NM0RAYSL6PA8.html">A3NM0RAYSL6PA8</a><br/><p>but it's his performance that makes this movie.  A Beautiful Mind is an engaging film.  Not a great movie, but a very good one.  As has become rather expected in movies by the &quot;better&quot; American directors, the ending is pure schmaltz.  I presume studio pressure had a lot to do with it--which is an excuse that is unavailable to Mr. Speilberg, who has transformed himself into the king of schmaltzy endings.  But, I digress.<p>Part of Crowe's approach to acting is to notice and replicate certain &quot;tics&quot; that become the nucleus around which his performance can spin, react, and coalesce.  But, unlike many lesser actors, these &quot;tics&quot; do not devolve into cliches.  He uses them as windows into the character's soul.  Here, John Nash's fingers do a figure eight on his forehead when the stress around him builds.  It's as if he is both shielding himself from the world and also wishing away demons with some arcane incantation.  Crowe's portrait of a man transformed by events beyond his control should have earned him an Oscar.  This truly was the performance of the year, and not a throwaway like Crowe's performance in the mediocre Gladiator.  But, apparently, he was even too rude and boorish for Hollywood (which is saying something when major stars can still win Oscars after attacking people with golf clubs).<p>Jennifer Connolly won an oscar for her role, but I'm not quite sure why.  Her performance is adequate, but the role is thin and her range of emotion is merely ordinary.  There is one scene where she is driven into a rage of frustration, shattering a mirror in the process, but that is the only shining moment for her.<p>Now if we can only get Mr. Howard to get off the schmaltzy ending train ...</p></br><a href="../users/A2FS38D943KX12.html">A2FS38D943KX12</a><br/><p>I didn't hate this film.  I have seen plenty that are<br />much worse, and that were a greater waste of my precious time.  However, after seeing all the hype and all the award nominations, I came to this film with high expectations, and it simply did not deliver.  What could have been an extremely compelling story ultimately comes off as feel-good fluff much of the time.<p>Plenty of historical fact has been omitted from this movie, but that is no different than any number of movies that are &quot;based on a true story.&quot;  There is no big crime in this; if you want a faithful, comprehensive picture, go read a book.  This is a Hollywood movie, for crying out loud.  Trying to cram a person's entire life story into 136 minutes means that lots of details will have to be left out. <p>The problem is that the omitted details make for one hell of an interesting story!  Bisexuality, numerous affairs, an abandoned illegitimate child, a marriage that was much rockier than the film implied, rank anti-semitism...it all adds up to an individual who very complex and interesting.  The fact that the man has been a complete lout at times does not lessen the heroism of his struggle, or the significance of his achievements.<p>The fact is that just about all of us are equally capable of simultaneously being heroes and cads, but we prefer not to face the dualism of our existence. Here was an opportunity to confront that dualism, in one of its more extreme manifestations, and explore it.  Ron Howard could have done that, but he copped out and left us with a sugar-coated, pre-fab,<br />feel-good movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ARRAMXWT83PT.html">A2ARRAMXWT83PT</a><br/><p>I was totally and utterly moved by this film! The performances were great, and the direction was perfect! Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly deserve the Oscars that they were nominated for. Great movie about a man's struggle with schizophrenia, and how he dealt with it. It's hard to believe that this actually happened. I was shocked. Twists and turns galore! <p>You'll love this film! Ron Howard also deserves an Oscar!</p></br><a href="../users/A20EEWWSFMZ1PN.html">A20EEWWSFMZ1PN</a><br/><p>John Forbes Nash has the ability to see patterns in math and nature that are ordinarily overlooked. He presumably is pressed into using his ability for the government.  Alicia comes into his world and as with many great loves; she sees what others call weird, as a cute uniqueness.  We follow their courtship and then life together.<br /><br />It is the little things and the interaction among friends that make the movie.  This movie captures your attention from the beginning. You may be able to anticipate what is happening however it is not meant to be a dark secret with a twist ending as much as letting you in on what he is going through to survive.  All the characters are fleshed out and you feel that you are there.

As one of Rome's famous gladiators, Crowe found redemption by bringing down a sinister emperor. Here he does so by quietly accepting the pens ceremonially laid before him by his Princeton colleagues and then by explaining that 'it is only in the mysterious equations of love that any logical reasons can be found.'<br /><br />Those who love or have been loved against the infinitude of chaos will understand Dr. Nash's discovery, regardless of whether the real Nash ever said those things from behind a Stockholm podium.<br /><br />Don't overlook this film when building your posterity collection. As human drama goes, a finely crafted fiction can ring more true than the connected dots of what really went down and who said what.</p></br><a href="../users/A16GAIJJE39T1S.html">A16GAIJJE39T1S</a><br/><p>Although there are many movies about sports and the thrill of scoring a touchdown or home run, there are few if any movies that address the passion of intellectual achievement.  Sure, there are plenty of science fiction movies about somebody conceiving, designing, and building some amazing vehicle or weapon in one fell swoop, (like Cochran and warp drive in Star Trek) but these are no more than fantasies which bear no relation to actual achievements in science and engineering.  This movie about a character who we might (if we were to find ourselves in a sufficiently generous mood) be described as modeled on John Nash, comes close to bringing into view the world of applied mathematicians.  Indeed, the first half hour of the movie dealing with Nash as a graduate student, strikes a familiar chord.  Hanging out with your grad school buddies at the local pub to discuss the great issues of to day or to formulate unworkable strategies for picking up girls is wonderfully familiar.  The unification of these two activities into the epiphany needed to supercharge your Ph.D. thesis was very satisfying--even if it had nothing to do with anything John Nash had ever experienced--or had any true relation to his work.<br /><br />For my part, I don't care if any of this movie has anything at all to do with the real John Nash.  I just like the way this movie conveys the excitement of conceiving of and working out a brilliant new theory.  Never would I have thought that a scene consisting of someone scribbling on a few pieces of paper could seem so magical--and in a way that I can clearly identify with my own experience.  The seasons pass--but there is John Nash joyfully working with his equations and diagrams!  Also wonderful are the scenes involving Nash and his Ph.D. adviser.  From the initial point where the adviser regards Nash as a kind of goof-off grad student who neither attends classes nor publishes journal articles--to the point where Nash finally wows him with his wonderful new take on economics and game theory--it certainly rang true to me!  I also loved the Nash character's comment to a fellow student that "Classes will dull your mind and block the way to authentic creativity."  I hated grad school courses with a passion and could not wait to get out from under them!<br /><br />I was also taken with the story of Nash meeting and courting the nurturing woman who became his wife (played by the very appealing Jennifer Connelly, who won Best Supporting Actress for her role).  Her character reminded me of meeting my own wonderful wife--and of her efforts (similar to those of Nash's wife) to connect with me and bring me closer to something resembling reality.<br /><br />Of course most of this movie dealt with the rather extreme mental problems of the pseudo Nash title character.  These experiences are too far outside of my experience for me to identify with them in anything close to my visceral response to the film's portrait of Nash's alleged grad school days.  This mental breakdown part of the story is actually more interesting in Sylvia Nasser's book, in accord with the veracity of the old "truth is stranger than fiction" axiom.</p></br><a href="../users/ADB8XCKNSDY5Z.html">ADB8XCKNSDY5Z</a><br/><p>I've always been fascinated by hallucinations.  So this movie naturally appealed to me.  It made me think, "My gosh, what if I'm like this guy and I've had a friend who isn't real all along?"  Holy cow.  Spooky.<br /><br />And the worst thing about it is the guy's hallucinations never go away.  He just has to pretend they aren't there.  What a bummer.  And some of those hallucinations were his best friends at one point too.  Geez.  Star Trek The Next Generation could do six full-length episodes based on the content of this film alone.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie to anyone interested in psychology, philosophical logic, insanity, or any combination of the three.  It can present you some mysteries, that's for sure.</p></br><a href="../users/A82LIVYSX6WZ9.html">A82LIVYSX6WZ9</a><br/><p>for those who want to see Crowe really lay the smack down as a skitzo man who sees invisible people and does an amazing job, well then this one is for you. with strong moments and a good cast including Ed Harris, Josh Lucas, Anthony Rapp, Adam Goldbgerg, Jennifer Connelly and Paul Bettamy. not the best film od 2001 one but its a good movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GQKB1KF0CRPE.html">A3GQKB1KF0CRPE</a><br/><p>oh, wow....this film absolutely blew me away, so much so, it's difficult to translate the feelings into mere words. It is so rich in textures, a once in a lifetime, brilliant performance from Russell Crowe, with understated, deft direction by Ron Howard, a light dance of inspiration that so rarely comes out of Hollywood. Opee you done well!<p>The power and emotion of this film, Russell's magick, is often nearly overwhelming. Few films affect you as deeply. The tale captures your from the start, gently rapping its hand around your heart and keeping you in thrall, as you follow the spiralling brilliance of genius on the edge of madness. Howard walks the tight rope, never fully revealing the cards he hold, keeping the viewer so convinced that these things are actually happening, though the other characters are telling you it was all in Crowe's mind. It gives you an unique position of 'experiencing' Crowe's delusions, so we more fully understand that delusions can be frighteningly as real as life. Instead of telling you this man suffers from schizophrenia, Howard and Crowe make 'your walk a mile in Nash's shoes', thus making your, for the first time, really comprehend what this disease does to the mind. How despite this all, Nash went on to win a Noble prize so this is a story of personal triumph.<p>Nash, an off the IQ chart mathematician, a socially inept Southern, is pulled into the superspy world by Ed Harris' William Parcher, who claims he is US government agent and needs Nash's unique talents. Christopher Plummer, another brilliant (but overlooked actor) actor gives to the link into reality, for both Nash and the audience, as Dr. Rosen, who treats Nash. Jennifer Connelly's performance as Nash's funny and loving wife, demonstrated a broader range of talent than we have seen from her; amazing to see the little girl who danced with Bowie all grown up and proving she is much more than a pretty face.<p>Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Supporting Actress, Best Adapted Screenplay and all well earned. The DVD is loaded with extras, like a commentary by Howard and screenwriter Akiva Goldsman, deleted scenes, scoring of the film, soundtrack and and other material on Nash.</p></br><a href="../users/A3BFJFJRXMWXAX.html">A3BFJFJRXMWXAX</a><br/><p>This two disc set is worth the money. Regardless of the stock you put in the decisions of the Academy of Motion Pictures, this film is still quite good and affecting on numerous levels. It seems that almost any film-not just a best picture winner-can get the glossy treatment of a two disc release. I have often wondered who had the brilliant idea to do double disc releases or special editions of pictures that, in my perfect world, would never EVER have been made, much less released on DVD ("Baseketball" anyone? The Adam Sandler catalogue-excepting "The Wedding Singer" of course) In this case, the discs contain a lot of info, but none of it seems terribly compelling, save for Ron Howard's home video footage of Dr. Nash explaining his equilibrium theory. The section on the music of the film for example, seems short and rather dull like so many other DVD's which feature special segments on the soundtrack. James Horner talks about how he tried to harness the moods that he experienced while watching the film. Hardly mind-blowing. I think that's what ALL composers do...<p>There are other extras that seem fine-not bad, not great either. (The standard for DVD was clearly set by the Ultimate Edition of Terminator 2, a film and package that deserves the treatment it received.) The picture quality is quite good, I have not experienced any pixelation yet. I don't know that I would have picked this film for best picture, but I certainly don't hold the view of some who say it should not have even been a contender. What makes the film compelling is that it is loosely based on the life of some real people. There have been ample opportunities for people-including the real Dr. Nash-to bash the film. He and wife Alicia have not. It's hard to imagine how some of the excised portions of the book could be sucessfully worked into the film without it become completely unfocused and disjointed. Howard states as much in his [usually] interesting feature length commentary.  Almost all of the deleted scenes are great and-in my opinion-should have been left in the final cut. <p>If his goal was to portray a man's struggle with schizophrenia and his journey through self-discovery and the discovery of love, then he suceeded. Take the film for what it is-a good drama and an inspiring story. <p>To the reviewer who didn't appreciate Howard's treatment of the disease, go watch any number of depressing films dealing with mental illness and tell me we don't need a bit more hope in our worldview of it. Who's saying everyone with Dr. Nash's illness can be so easily 'cured'? When we see Dr. Nash with his old friend-now head of the department at Princeton-his friend asks him if 'they are still there', refering to the three characters that Nash imagines. "Yes" Nash replies. And when the man from the Nobel committee asks Dr. Nash about his delusions, Nash states "I still see things that are not there. I just choose not to acknowledge them. Kind of like a diet of the mind." So clearly, Dr. Nash himself has NOT been cured. [On his commentary, Ron Howard goes to great pains to describe the research that went into the film, the care that was used to ensure that the disease was treated in a proper manner.]  He has, however, learned how to COPE with an illness he still struggles with-Isn't this an uplifting view of mental illness? Hello?</p></br><a href="../users/A9Q28YTLYREO7.html">A9Q28YTLYREO7</a><br/><p>I usually enjoy Ron Howard Films&this is a Good Film but mainly because of Russell Crowe who to me Should have gotten a Co-Oscar for His Performance Here.I think He&Denzel Washington both gave Great Performance's thsi Year to Each get a Award.without Crowe's Performance this Film is another Long-winded film.the film glosses over many things in the Book&it hurts the film in that process.this film kinda reminded me of "Rain Man" for some strange reason.I think because the fact that Crowe is so Gifted as a Actor&His Persona was shaped rather well with the Role He was playing.</p></br><a href="../users/A1655SGPPUUCRP.html">A1655SGPPUUCRP</a><br/><p>'A Beautiful Mind' is one of the most heartwrenching, deeply emotional and moving films that I have ever seen.  Russell Crowe gives his best peformace yet for a Golden Globe winning performance as John Nash, the nobel prize-winning schizophrenic math genius.  Crowe's brutally honest performance sheds some light on the often misunderstood disease.  I walked out of the theater in shock because of Russell Crowe's performance, it was truly touching.  Nash's wife is played flawlessly by a wondrful Jennifer Connelly.  Connelly brings genuine emotion and feeling into this key character.  Connelly's performance also snagged her a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actress.  Ed Harris is also wondeful is his role.  I won't talk too much about Harris's role for fear of giving something away!  Akiva Goldsman's brilliant Golden Globe-winning screenplay has many of these sorts of surprises, twists and turns.<p>Critically acclaimed director Ron Howard fills 'A Beautiful Mind' with geniune emotion and heart. I found myself personally touched by this film a number of times.  It's pretty shocking how heartwrenching 'A Beautiful Mind' is at times.  I found myself enveloped in tears along with my friends a number of times while watching this film.  If a film can touch you in the way that 'A Beautiful Mind' did for me, you know that it must be a wonderful film.  Fortunately, 'A Beautiful Mind' snagged the Best Drama award at the Golden Globes the other night beating out films such as 'The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring' and 'In The Bedroom'.  I also feel that the original score for this film by the legendary James Horner deserves some recognition.  Read my review of this deeply-stirring Golden Globe nominated score.</p></br><a href="../users/A7Y6AVS576M03.html">A7Y6AVS576M03</a><br/><p>This is a truly touching film. If you are not familiar with the story I will only say that to give away any details of this movie would be inappropriate. A BEAUTIFUL MIND is slow, lethargic yet remains intriguing and emerges into a heartfelt statement about our true selves and the meaning of love, commitment and the essence of mind and being. Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly give brilliantly realistic performances and make this film work. A lot also has to be said of James Horner's insightful and moving score, which only enhances the viewer's insight and response to the film's statement.  This film is beautiful and one of the best to come out this year.</p></br><a href="../users/A2VD3CYOEMJ6SR.html">A2VD3CYOEMJ6SR</a><br/><p>I enjoyed this movie from beginning to end. Russell Crowe's performance was extraordinary. He convincingly portrayed math genius John Nash, an oddball who sank deep into schizophrenia. His wife, well played by Jennifer Connelly helps, see him through his disease as he overcomes it, becoming a Nobel Prize winner for his &quot;game theory.&quot; Director Ron Howard gets us into Nash's mind as he is having his delusions and, therby lies one problem with this movie: you cannot get into someone's mind. The depiction of Nash's delusions, of necessity, must be somewhat fictional.<p>There are a number of other areas where facts have been skirted. First, the movie depicts Nash getting married and becoming a father. We don't find out that Nash already had a son through an earlier affair with another woman. Secondly, Nash's wife is an extraordinary woman who exhibited great stregnth but, she got divorced from Nash (and later they remarried). Again, the movie does not depict this. Thirdly, Nash shared the Nobel Prize, i.e., he was a cowinner. From the movie you would get the impression that he was the sole winner. Fourth, the movie depicts a tradition at Princeton where estemed elders of the math department are honored in a ceremony in which their colleagues present them with pens. There is no such tradition at Princeton. Finally, Nash makes a moving speech when he receives his award. However, the Nobel Prize is not an academy award .. there is no speech given by winners.<p>This movie is very moving and it helps us to get to know the story of John Nash. And, indeed, it is a wonderful story. However, when a movie distorts the truth, no matter how good the movie, I knock off a star in my review thus, four stars for an otherwise superb effort by director Ron Howard.</p></br><a href="../users/A3U56M0Y8LYO6J.html">A3U56M0Y8LYO6J</a><br/><p>Ron Howard's "A Beautiful Mind" is a tragic and inspiring masterwork that showcases one of the most impressive acting performances in recent memory.  If there were still any lingering doubts as to the extent of Russell Crowe's acting prowess, this film dashed them all.<br /><br />John Nash (Crowe) is a brilliant mathematician who makes an amazing breakthrough in his field while a student at Princeton.  After graduating, he teaches at M.I.T. while working for the federal government as a code-breaker.  He begins a relationship with a graduate student (Jennifer Connelly) and soon they are married and settled into a quiet domestic life.  However, Nash soon starts to see patterns and associations of information everywhere and it is soon discovered that he is suffering from schizophrenia.  Serious questions as to his perceptions of the real world, both in the past and in the present, must now be confronted.<br /><br />Virtually all aspects of "A Beautiful Mind" work beautifully.  Howard's confident direction and the strong lead performances by Crowe and Connelly is the glue that holds the entire production together.  However, the important contributions made by supporting actors Paul Bettany, Ed Harris, and Christopher Plummer, composer James Horner, and screenwriter Akiva Goldsman should also be acknowledged.  "A Beautiful Mind" furthermore deserves credit for not sentimentalizing Nash's struggle against mental illness.  The darker aspects of his tortuous road to recovery are not avoided and are unflinchingly presented warts and all.  It is a credit to Crowe's talent that we come to know John Nash so well and come to care so much for him.  Nash's life is an amazing story and "A Beautiful Mind" is an amazing recounting of it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDNTB7377YH2.html">A1CDNTB7377YH2</a><br/><p>Highly riveting film with a super performance by both Russell Crowe and Ed Harris.  Even though the director changed John Nash's life a great deal to make it a more entertaining movie.<p>John Nash, a genius who came up with a business model that was adopted by many businesses, is a social oddball that is so dedicated to his studies that he has absolutely no concept of social skills.  He finds it a task to even make the slightest bit of conversation with a female.  The only person he seems to get along with is his college roomate (later we find out that this roomate is not what he seems).  His genius attracts a government agency that employs him briefly as a code breaker.  There he meets Ed Harris, who is not what he seems either.  Ed has him working on top secret work that involves breaking secret transmissions from the Russians.<p>Everything then starts to unravel and we learn the truth about the people that seem to influence John the most.<p>Crowe gives a super performance in probably the role he was born to play!</p></br><a href="../users/A281NPSIMI1C2R.html">A281NPSIMI1C2R</a><br/><p>"Only those who know the supremacy of the intellectual life-the life which has the seed of ennobling thought and purpose within it-can understand the grief of one who falls from that serene activity into the absorbing, soul-wasting struggle with worldly annoyances."<br />-George Eliot<br /><br />In September, 1947, mathematical genius John Nash spends his time attempting to distinguish himself with a completely original idea at Princeton University in lieu of attending classes. He distances himself from the other students with his introverted and eccentric behavior and admits he doesn't really like people. He is so consumed with thought, he neglects his most basic needs and becomes so absorbed in his own serene thought processes he forgets to eat and sleep.<br /><br />In fact, no one can really relate to him until he meets a beautiful student who attends one of his classes. Alicia (Jennifer Connelly) seems to have the patience to work through situations in real life, that Nash doesn't have time for or is not concerned with. His mind won't let him deal with real life and he is tossed into an unrealistic fantasy by delusions that seek to destroy him. Alicia falls for his mind, they marry and her emotional IQ is so high that she truly shows her husband unconditional love.<br /><br />He enters an imaginary life in which he helps the government break codes in magazines. His wife becomes increasingly aware of his mental condition and tries to help him see what reality truly is. She needs to believe that something extraordinary is feasible. She believes he can conquer anything. The problem is, he is suffering from a mental illness which is seeking to destroy his world.<br /><br />As he descends into a world of his own making, schizophrenia takes over and he has to take medications that interfere with his ability to "do his job." This causes him immense grief and he lacks purpose. His job actually turns out to be completely of his own imagination. This espionage part of the story is absorbing and exciting. The emotional elements are highly rewarding and the actual love story was for me at least, overwhelmingly beautiful.<br /><br />Through John Nash's life he learns what is truly important and in that is the true beauty of this story. Ron Howard shows genius in his ability to so capture your heart with his directing.<br /><br /> A Beautiful Mind will draw from you those exquisite emotions only a story of great depth and sensitivity can. The characters are genuinely persuasive and screenwriter, Akiva Goldsman crafted one of the most intelligent scripts to date. An exceptional score reflects a complex backdrop of emotions and in this mirror of music the rays of reflection will touch your soul.<br /><br />A Beautiful Mind is an eloquent portrayal of John Nash's life with an emphasis on the emotional torment mental illness can evoke contrast with the sheer beauty of love.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>The real life story of John Nash plays out as engaging and interesting as some of our more well thought out fiction.  Now, as some have already noted whether here or in media scrutiny, not all of this film follows Nash's life accurately.  Some of this film is fictionalized, but isn't that for the most part what always happens.  Just because it's a true story doesn't mean Hollywood doesn't feel the need to tamper.  At least here the tampering does not by any means take away from the power within the film and the performances that dominate.  Nash's life story is still portrayed effortlessly and beautifully, compelling and entertaining and full of just about every aspect of a priceless and award worthy film.  `A Beautiful Mind' truly has it all.<br /><br />Russell Crowe here delivers a breathtaking performance as John Nash, a brilliant math student who gets to the top only to tumble back down to the bottom at breakneck speed.  Living a life that in the end appears mostly a lie, Nash eventually is diagnosed with schizophrenia.  At this point in his life, married with a child and working a steady job, Nash and those around him are finding it difficult to differentiate reality from the creations of his mind.  The movie then turns its focus on Nash's recovery and the effect his sickness has on those closest to him.<br /><br />Crowe is truly the star here, swallowing whole this character driven study on the human spirit and determination to survive.  He engulfs the screen and makes this mans plight come alive for the audience.  What's commendable here is that Howard's directing and of course the script, adapted from Sylvia Nasar's biography, allow for the viewer to really connect with the entire cast, most importantly Nash himself.  This proves effective because once Nash's life is shattered before our very eyes and he begins to crumble we are brought to a place deep within our emotions that would have been impossible to touch had we not come to know Nash before his world came tumbling down.  We fall in love with this man and so we feel his pain, his wife's pain and are emotionally distressed alongside them both.<br /><br />Alongside Crowe both Jennifer Connelly and Paul Bettany deliver astounding performances as Nash's longsuffering wife and imaginary best friend.  Jennifer's Oscar winning performance is full of so much life, so much pain and emotional attachment that we can relate to and understand her feelings every step of the way.  We watch her transform from this woman who knew how to control the things around her, including Nash, to a woman scared of what was going to happen next, a woman who felt detached from all she thought was real.  Bettany's portrayal of Nash's college roommate is high spirited and refreshing.  He serves as our brightest comic relief but also our biggest heartbreak as we watch Nash realize he never truly had his friendship at all.<br /><br />Crowe, one of our finest actors, is a true chameleon and he engages himself so far into this role that he becomes John Nash, and watching that transformation is utterly rewarding.  His determination and fervor are so invested in this performance from the moment he appears on screen that one is automatically drawn to him and connected to him entirely.  From start to finish `A Beautiful Mind' proves itself worthy of our attention and consideration and is sure to astonish and amaze you.  From its heartbreaking story to its brilliantly crafted direction to its powerhouse performances, `A Beautiful Mind' is a winner from the top of its head to the tip of its toes.  The well rounded supporting cast including the likes of Ed Harris and Josh Lucas continue to astonish in their respective roles and aid in delivering one of the warmest and beautifully articulated Hollywood experiences.  This, my friends, is what going to the movies is all about.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ990HW13DP08.html">AQ990HW13DP08</a><br/><p>John Nash won the Nobel Prize in economics in 1994 for work he had done as a Princeton grad student in the 1940s. In between, schizophrenia hounded him. His wife is the real hero. The film glosses over the seamier aspects of Nash's real life (see the biography by Sylvia Nasar), and gives the impression that lots of love will cure mental illness (wrong), but this is still a moving film that explores the borders between genius and madness.</p></br><a href="../users/A1BJJVV2B5VLUQ.html">A1BJJVV2B5VLUQ</a><br/><p>So John Forbes Nash is now (almost) a household name. With good reason... the Nobel prize mathematician's story is a good one. It deserves attention... and director Ron Howard did a wonderful job of creating a masterful piece of Hollywood cinema. Based on Nash's experiences at New Jersey's most famed learning establishment, Princeton University, thru the development of his economic theory ("Nash's Equilibrium"), his marriage to Alicia, and his eventual work at MIT. Imagine if Robert Redford directed and Tom Cruise played the part of Nash as it might have been (they both considered it). I can't see this film being much better... however it would be kind of interesting to see another great director's (and the actor's) take on the same script. Russell Crowe takes the challenge of portraying the man with a chip on both soldiers (in this case schizophrenia), Mr. John Nash, right in stride with his previous preformance as Maximus in "Gladiator". I can't imagine anyone else playing this role of Nash as well as Crowe did. Co-stars Jennifer Connelly, Ed Harris, Christopher Plummer, Paul Bettany and Judd Hirsch round out a wonderful supporting cast. Footnote: Alicia (Connelly) was maybe to evenly tempered in this film thru all of Nash's emotional ups & downs... almost too much so (a performance worthy of an Academy Award... I'm still sitting on the fence about it... it was good, but it wasn't brilliant). Beautifully filmed - partly on location (Princeton Univ, NJ). This is how drama should be. "A Beautiful Mind" will make you think - Is he imagining all this? Yes he is... no he isn't, yes, no, not sure, those people in the shed behind their house ARE real, no they aren't... yes - he is delusional. DVD features include commentary by Ron Howard, deleted scenes with Howard's commentary, meeting John Nash, special effects featurette, and more. Oscar winner for best picture, best director for Howard, best supporting actress for Connelly, and best adapted screenplay. Ron Howard's movies just seem to get better and better... sheriff Andy Taylor must be proud of his favorite TV son.</p></br><a href="../users/A11ED8O95W2103.html">A11ED8O95W2103</a><br/><p>I probably never would have watched this movie if my wife hadn't brought it home and said something like "I got a movie for us to watch tonight".<br /><br />I found this movie gripping from the very start.  Russell Crowe's intensity got me hooked from the first scene, and mind bogglingly beautiful Jennifer Connelly kept me entranced with both her looks and her great acting right to the end.<br /><br />Without duplicating what others have written, I just want to say that to me the geniune brilliance of this movie is that is portrays a character who suffers from schizophrenia and allows us to genuinely share in his experience by thoroughly developing characters who turn out in the end to never have really existed.<br /><br />It's like he made a schizophrenic out of the viewer for the first half of the movie!  The character discovers that his roommate, the roommate's neice, and the scary Fed Spy Guy weren't real just as we the audience do.  Brilliant!  I really didn't know for a while how this story would end, and what reality really was.<br /><br />Also, as the father of a mildly autistic child, it gave me hope for his future too.  The human mind is a beautiful thing indeed, and even when it doesn't work quite right, it can self-diagnose and make corrections, and maybe solve one of the the world's problems if we just give it what it needs most, love.  Bravo!<br /><br />My only dissapointment is in the bonus material.  I wanted to learn a little more about the supporting characters, but the casting segment was just about Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connely.  That's a minor nitpick.</p></br><a href="../users/A356TJCTCLDN89.html">A356TJCTCLDN89</a><br/><p>Russell Crowe is incredible as the West Virginia genius, John Nash. Jennifer Connerly, does a fine job as his wife, Alicia. The big shock of the film works;we find out that whole portions of John's day to day life exist only in his head and have for years. Looking at it later, you can see the very subtle hints that people and things are just fantasies. Nash's best friend only appears when he really needs him. Ed Harris appears, in highly stressful or emotional times, like his wedding day. This is a great film and only has a few tiny flaws. For example we never really understand why a girl like Alicia would fall in love with a man so different from her and her friends. Overall, I loved this film enough to buy it.</p></br><a href="../users/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ.html">A12X2J7AVZ04IQ</a><br/><p>...A BEAUTIFUL MIND is really a fine film, well put-together and a riveting narrative. It's detractors have criticized it for not being true to Nash's real life... WHO CARES!!!? The film, as presented, is as good as I've seen in a long time. Certainly, there were things in this complicated man's life that had to be left out for the sake of narrative. Some sensation-seekers are upset because his homosexuality wasn't addressed, though I thought the relationship with his roommate was more than platonic...I don't want to give away any plot points...and besides that...WHO CARES!!? I enjoyed the film, as presented... I really liked James Horner's score. It was exceptionally pretty. The score presented Nash's moods as much as Russell did...</p></br><a href="../users/ANIMV3SPDD8SH.html">ANIMV3SPDD8SH</a><br/><p>Noble Prize winning mathematician John Nash's descent into schizophrenia is far more fascinating than his recovery in the heralded Ron Howard directed drama, "A Beautiful Mind". Nash's delusions, which occupy most of the first half of the film, are frightening flashes of cimematography that startle the senses into belief in much the same way a schizophrenic's delusions would. The second half of the film, his recovery, offers much less in cinematic value as Nash buries himself in mathematical equations as his delusions become less aggressive but forever present. Russell Crowe is the epitome of a schizophrenic Math professor almost to the point of amusing caricature, but the performance is disciplined excellence. Jennifer Connelly, as his wife seems merely there, no more or less than the sympathetic role offers, (I'm in the minority here). Her atrocious make-up in the final scenes, some forty years later, make her look like The Bride of Frankenstein. I would like to have seen Nash's groundbreaking work on economic theory better explained, even in layman's terms. It would have added much to his abandonment of reality. The inevitable emotional summation of Nash accepting The Noble Prize before throngs of applauding admirers was a bit anticlmactic. I mostly however enjoyed this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CIW2OEVAJRM2.html">A1CIW2OEVAJRM2</a><br/><p>Based on Sylvia Nasar's biography of the mathematical genius John Forbes Nash (born 1928), winner of the 1994 Nobel Prize in economics for his revolutionary game theory, `A Beautiful Mind' recounts Nash's struggle with genius and with schizophrenia.  Frequently and incorrectly confused with multiple personality disorder, schizophrenia involves seeing delusions.  In real life the nature of Nash's delusions during his time of illness have been largely forgotten by him, and in this regard the screen-writer has taken the liberty to fictionally recreate delusions revolving around three imagined characters: a representative of the US Defence who convinces Nash to act as a code-breaker by examining popular magazines for hidden Russian codes giving clues about an imminent nuclear attack, an imagined college room mate and his young orphaned niece.<br /><br />But the real power of this movie is that it enables viewers to get inside the mind of a schizophreniac by making these delusions real and presenting them as an alternate reality.  Nash's inner landscapes are presented as real to the audience, just as they are real to those with schizophrenia, and we are drawn convincingly into his world.  Suddenly, the plot takes an abrupt turn as both movie viewers and Nash are robbed of these delusions by having the rug pulled from under them and confronted with reality.  For Nash the experience is even more terrifying - he ends up in a psychiatric hospital.  To say more would spoil the movie for those who haven't seen it, but it's enough to say that the experience of the movie is like the experience of the disease.  It's a brilliant concept that successfully enables us to empathize with Nash.  "Imagine that you would suddenly have learned the peoples and places and moments most important to you were not gone, not dead, but worse, had never been."  The movie's success is enhanced by the brilliant acting of Russell Crowe as John Nash, in a performance of pathos in the same category of the memorable acting of Rainman and Forrest Gump; and a delightful soundtrack by James Horner with haunting vocals by Charlotte Church.<br /><br />But this movie is just as much the story of Nash's wife Alicia (in an award winning performance by Jennifer Connelly) as it is about Nash.  Despite his mental problems, she sticks by him and her love and commitment to him says a great deal about what marriage is really all about. Nash's words in the acceptance speech of his Nobel Prize point to her love as the real source of his endurance in the struggle, and it is her love that this movie is about just as much as it is about Nash's genius and illness.  This positive portrayal of marriage and of the undying love of a wife is a welcome change from the typical infidelity offered by Hollywood.  Her love is just as beautiful as Nash's mind.<br /><br />Parents should be aware that there are some incidents of blasphemy and sexual talk.  But the themes of this movie in dealing with the complexity of schizophrenia are clearly adult anyway.  Not only does it result in greater appreciation for John Nash, but also greater understanding and compassion for schizophrenia - even if the portrayal of Nash's life is not entirely accurate.  There are moral and historical flaws, but there's still tremendous beauty.  `A Beautiful Mind' is a beautiful film that was deservedly rewarded for its beauty with several Oscars (including Best Picture), and if you're a fan of serious movies your life will be enhanced by viewing it.  If only more films had this kind of beauty. -GODLY GADFLY</p></br><a href="../users/AOYTQFRLD8VLP.html">AOYTQFRLD8VLP</a><br/><p>Ron Howard's direction of "A Beautiful Mind" is much like that of "The Sixth Sense" in that it is only much later in the film that we see certain realities of the main character's world for what they are.<br /> It does lose points with me, however, for not portraying certain aspects of John Nash's life accurately. Ignored, for example, is the fact that his wife, the initially spunky and forceful, Alicia, is El Salvadorian, and while Jennifer Connelly's portrayal of her was well-done, she could have adopted a more Spanish-sounding accent for the part.<br /> While a bit beefy for the lead role, Russell Crowe submerges himself nicely into the character of the eccentric, socially inept John Nash, complete with a Southern twang. The film features the usual cornerstones of a Crowe performance: Displays of brute strength, moments of violent rage, pensive charm, subtle glances from his very expressive heavily-lashed blue-green eyes, quick and pleasant witticisms, a wry smile, and of course, his excerising his "right to bare arms", that last of which should keep the ladies interested.<br /> The story of course, revolves around Professor Nash's bout with schizophrenia, his major contribution to the world despite his illness, and his ultimate triumph as a Nobel Laurate.<br /> We first meet Nash as a loner at Princeton University about to work on his thesis, but not succeeding at doing so at first. There isn't too much emphasis on math itself, the least favorite subject of many of us in school, which was perhaps done to keep most of the audience interested in the film. But the palpable distance between Nash and the elderly faculty member being honored by the ceremony of the pens can be measured in light years, as Nash stands in the hallway, a lone and solitary figure once again on the outside.<br /> His life is made even more complicated by his roommate (Paul Bettany) and his roommate's adoptive niece who never ages(Vivien Cardone), as well as Government agent William Parcher (Ed Harris), who never changes his clothes.<br /> Christopher Plummer's Dr. Rosen appears on the scene to treat Nash, giving a calm intellectual, but slightly smug performance as the once esteemed Professor falls from grace and into his care.<br /> The scene on Nash's recipience of shock treatment is reminiscent of Jack Nicholson's undergoing the same procedure in "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest". But while there is debate about how meticulously<br /> schizophrenia and the events of Nash's life are portrayed (his otherwise unmentioned son, whom he had out of wedlock plays an orderly in the film), Crowe makes Nash a very sympathetic character, and perhaps the film has led more people to empathize with the plight of the mentally ill.We feel somehow, that Alicia was meant to be the guiding force in his life, although in reality, the couple were divorced for a time.<br /> Later in the movie, there is another pens ceremony, but happily Nash is not at a distance from it this time.<br /> The make-up job of the Nashes as an elderly couple could have been better. But Nash's address of the Nobel Academy, which in fact never happened, gives the film a final, romantic flourish.<br /> The stately and haunting anthem sung by Charlotte Church is one of vigilance on behalf of those in need of guidance.<br /> While sparing us many gritty realities of the Nashes' life together, Ron Howard's movie is one of hope and triumph, with only a muted kind of joy because despite Nash's great achievements, the battle for sanity continues.</p></br><a href="../users/A3CWH6VKCTJAD.html">A3CWH6VKCTJAD</a><br/><p>Ron Howard (Splash, Cocoon, Backdraft, Apollo 13) has done excellent work as a director for which he has gotten little credit over the years.  With this film comes a best director Oscar and a best picture Oscar and finally the recognition he deserves.  Howard has always been good at presenting human stories, be they comedy or drama.  He has a intuitive understanding of character motivation and is excellent at making his characters elicit strong emotions in the viewer.  This is particularly true in this film.<p>The story is based on the life of John Forbes Nash, Jr., a mathematician and Nobel laureate who suffered from schizophrenia.  The film gives us a unique first person perspective of the disease, drawing us into his world and allowing us to see what Nash sees.  Howard's presentation is brilliant.  At first Nash is presented as a bit eccentric, but lucid.  As we experience his world, reality and illusion are so perfectly intertwined that we are not sure where the world ends and the mind begins.  By fooling the audience Howard makes the subtle point that to the schizophrenic it all seems real.  In attempting to evaluate Nash's world we get a distant understanding of the confusion that results when a rational person attempts to cope with a world that is part real and part hallucination.<p>While this is a biopic, it is more fiction than fact.  A great deal of dramatic license is taken since Nash freely admits that he has little recollection of the years when he suffered from the disease.  The powerful speech at the end of the film where he thanks his wife after receiving his Nobel Prize is pure Hollywood.  Included in the DVD is footage of the actual Nobel ceremony and no speeches were given.  Yet, we can forgive the latitude taken because the story is so inspirational.<p>From a production standpoint, special note must be given to the makeup department, which ages Russell Crowe so magnificently.  As the movie progresses through four decades, Nash is realistically depicted and aged appropriately.  Likewise, the art department does a fine job rendering four different periods, matching costumes, props and sets to the times.<p>Yet, with all the fine production values, this film excels most in the acting.  Russell Crowe turns in a career performance in a career abundant in great performances.  This character is the antithesis of the Russell Crowe we've come to expect.  Instead of strong, tough and balanced, with a sharp worldly intelligence, he plays an eccentric and convoluted man with quirks, nervous habits and a psyche obviously out of balance.  Crowe completely immerses himself in the enormous volume of the role, effortlessly moving between its elements from audacity to paranoia to tenderness to genius.  This is an accomplishment that is light years beyond his Academy Award performance in "Gladiator", good as it was.<p>Jennifer Connelly puts herself on the map with an Oscar for best supporting actress.  It is always difficult to avoid getting lost in the presence of an actor as powerful as Crowe, but Connelly stays right with him, delivering a moving performance as Nash's steadfast wife.<p>Ed Harris was my favorite to nose out Crowe for best actor in last year's Academy Awards.  Harris gave a brilliant performance playing Jackson Pollock in "Pollock" (also featuring Jennifer Connelly in a small role) that was trampled under by the "Gladiator" Oscar juggernaut.  As if to say, "If you can't beat him, join him", Harris goes toe to toe with Crowe in some of the most intense scenes in the film.  Harris lends significant energy and intrigue to the movie with an urgent performance as the operative who recruits Nash to break codes for the government.<p>This film is nothing short of fantastic.  It is expertly directed, superbly acted and meticulously crafted.  It presents great drama while also bringing insight into a stigmatizing disease to a wide audience.  I rated it a 10/10.  It rightfully ran away with the Best Picture Oscar.

Still worse, both script and direction are unfocused, and much of the film is taken up with a tricksy plot device calculated to manipulate viewers into an unexpected identification with Nash's mental illness.<p>The plot device in question is one recently seen in a number of plot-driven films such as THE SIXTH SENSE; here, however, it proves extremely transparent and feels out of place, and since it requires the film to shift gears several times it contributes to the film's lack of flow.  Moreover, it has the effect of presenting the nature of Nash's illness in very glossy terms that fail to really reflect the seriousness of his condition.  It all has a &quot;santitized for your protection&quot; feel.<p>But when the cast has opportunity to shine it shines with considerable brilliance, and in spite of the film's numerous flaws the actors hold the attention from start to finish.  I have never been a fan of Russell Crowe, and I found his performance in the earliest scenes a bit artificial, but he quickly comes to grips with the role and delivers a powerhouse performance that remains in mind long after the film ends.  Jennifer Connelly is equally powerful as wife Alicia, and the supporting cast (which includes Ed Harris, Judd Hirsch, and Christopher Plummer) is extremely fine.  This is not a great film, but it does contain great performances, and I recommend it on that basis.</p></br><a href="../users/AW1493ZQTQ2ET.html">AW1493ZQTQ2ET</a><br/><p>Having read the book, I was quite disappointed with this movie.  Sure, the movie is gripping because the story is tragically sad and the acting is pretty good.  In this sense, the movie does a good of job highlighting the impact of serious mental illness and the need to help those who are dealing with it.  But the problem is that the movie is about a real person, and comparison with the book (which I trust) shows that the movie left out and changed so many key elements that it represents an unacceptable distortion of the truth of John Nash's life.  I could go into detail by giving many examples, but instead I urge you to simply read the book (or listen to the audiobook).  The true story is far more powerful and interesting than this ridiculously popularized movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />An often-moving story, A Beautiful Mind sometimes rambles or takes too long on a dead end of a plotline, but deserves praise for taking one of the most formulaic genres (the biopic) and doing something completely different, mainly successfully.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L43KWWR05PCS.html">A1L43KWWR05PCS</a><br/><p>This is a superlative film, directed by Ron Howard, someone who is sure to be remembered as a legend in his own time for the number of high quality films that he has directed, thus far. He is certainly one of the finest directors around today, and this film is certainly reflective of his talent. The technique that he employs to illustrate the descent of John Nash into the world of schitzophrenia is highly effective.<br /><br />Loosely based upon the biography of the same name by Sylvia Nasar, the world of schitzophrenia is brought to life in this film by a wonderful screenplay, deft direction, and superb acting. Featuring the life of Nobel Prize laureate, John Nash, this film begins to chronicle his life from 1947, when he was a young, promising, though eccentric, graduate student at Princeton University. The film delineates his lack of social skills, eccentricities, rise to prominence, marriage, and eventual descent into schitzophrenic hell. It follows his battle with madness and his own way of coping with his inner demons. It also shows how Nash's early work proved to be so influential that it netted him a Nobel Prize decades later. While a number of people have objected to the fact that this film leaves out some of the darker sides of Nash, one would do well to remember that this is not a documentary but merely a dramatization.<br /><br />Russell Crowe gives a memorable portrayal of the afflicted and tormented John Nash, beleagured by the devils that existed only in his mind. Ed Harris is compelling as the slightly sinister Parcher, a shadowy government operative whose existence is intertwined with that of John's. Paul Bettany, as he did in the role of Chaucer in "A Knight's Tale", once again almost steals the show in the role of John's alleged roommate and friend, Charles. Christopher Plummer is excellent as Dr. Rosen, the psychiatrist who appeals to the dormant rationality in Nash. While Jennifer Connelly gives a very good performance in the role of Alicia, John's caring wife, it does not rise to the level of Oscar worthy, though she won an Academy Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role.<br /><br />This two disc, widescreen, awards edition DVD clinches this as being worthy of five stars. It is an absolutely value laden two disc DVD. The first disc offers a widescreen version of the film in addition to two commentaries. One is by the director, Ron Howard. The other is by the screenwriter, Akiva Goldsman. The second disc is devoted entirely to special features. Particularly memorable is the feature with John Nash himself, explaining his theory on equilibrium. There is also a feature that shows the Nobel Prize awards of 1994 and Nash's acceptance of his in Economics. All in all, this is a great package deal and simply first rate.</p></br><a href="../users/AUSATFDSU2INS.html">AUSATFDSU2INS</a><br/><p>I always thought that mathematics could drive a person crazy.<br /><br />After watching A Beautiful Mind, I could verify that my theory is not absolutely preposterous.<br /><br />This drama based on a real life history presents Russell Crowe as John Forbes Nash Jr, a mathematical genius whose mind goes through an intense trip from health to madness to health again. The complexity of the brain and its effects in human behavior are explored with a clarifying view in this film.<br /><br />Nash's story begins in 1947, when the "mysterious genius of West Virginia" arrives at Princeton to attend his studies. Obsessed with come up with a really original idea, Nash is most of the time solving complicated equations in the library, in the large windows of his room and even in the bar where he hangs out with his competitive companions.<br /><br />And it is on a simple day that the idea appears suddenly. His study in the theory of the game audaciously contradicts the Adam Smith's doctrine. One hundred and fifty years of accepted ideas suddenly are not fashionable anymore and Nash's life changes forever. Now working at the recognized MIT, Nash becomes involved with some Cold War investigations, while simultaneously his personal life gives a complete turn when he meets Alicia, a physics student and eventually, his future wife.<br /><br />But the dreamed life of Nash soon crumbles when they diagnose him paranoid schizophrenia. His genius becomes cloudy and from that moment, Nash must fight to apply the logic - the one that once served him to solve complicated theorems- to the disease that every day tries to moves him away more from reality.<br /><br />Narrated from Nash's point of view, the movie tries to baffle us by mixing reality with fantasy; a technique that effectively makes us understand how confused a mind can get.<br /><br />Russell Crowe offers a dramatic interpretation as Nash, as we see him age 40 years in screen. The actor takes a comfortable ride through the different facets of Nash, from the safe, arrogant genius, to the lost and tormented man that`s desperately trying to get rid of his demons.<br /><br />Jennifer Connelly, as Alicia, complements Crowe in all senses. Desolated by the disease of her husband, Alicia fights under pressure to continue loving the upset genius and offering the emotional support that he needs so much.<br /><br />Although inevitably the movie falls with its sentimentality, A Beautiful Mind is a film that's worth watching. Is not about mathematics or the important merits Nash offered to the world. It's about his genius, and how he accomplished to control his delirious and how he became not only a person with a truly great mind, but also with a great heart.</p></br><a href="../users/ANP3R2R4V4GAN.html">ANP3R2R4V4GAN</a><br/><p>I did like this movie, I didn't htink it wa steh most amazing movie ever but it was a nice stylized trick of having us deeply inside of his delusion before it's revealed that they are just that.  That was a nice touch and I think that Russell Crowe is a very good actor.  I'm always amazed at how much he can change himself to accommodate the character as seeming real.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DY46ZABF4CMQ.html">A3DY46ZABF4CMQ</a><br/><p>I have not seen this film until recently. I never really cared for this film nor for its leading star, Mr. Russell Crowe. But I happened to be in Blockbuster and I passed by this DVD so I picked it up only to quench my curiosity over why it was named Best Picture. I was amazed at how wonderful 'A Beautiful Mind' turned out. Of course, I liked Ron Howard's past movies 'Apollo 13', 'Backdraft', 'Gung Ho', 'Cocoon', 'Splash' and 'Nightshift', so my expectations were particularly high.<p>Russell Crowe amazed me as he delivered a very good performance as John Nash, a mentally disturbed mathematician genius at Princeton University. Jennifer Connelly reached her all time career peak as the woman Nash falls in love with and has to deal with her husbands problem. The movie is haunting, dark, funny at times, and very touching. I don't really know whether the movie dramatizes too much for movie purposes, but it sure unfolds very well. The makeup work is one of the highlights of the movie. Ed Harris is surprising in his role. <p>In no way is 'A Beautiful Mind' boring nor is it dumb. It sparks excellent performances and a beautiful character-actor picture.<p>Highly Recommended.<p>A</p></br><a href="../users/A35YWA2V4QHOJ3.html">A35YWA2V4QHOJ3</a><br/><p>For those of us who have read the novel by Sylvia Nasar, this movie will come as a complete surprise.  I remember sitting in the theatre in complete confusion thru portions of the film.  The confusion, however, was finally replaced by the realization of what the makers of this movie were trying to do.<p>The 3 imagined characters were pure fiction and much of the movie was highly fabricated.  The film also entirely omitted the object of Nash's first affair, Eleanor, as well as the son he fathered by her, John David.  <p>As all good movies do, this film had its reasons for proceeding thus.  The story is about Nash's courtship and marriage of Alicia.  It was during this period in his life that he experienced his biggest bouts with mental illness, which is also central to the theme.  To have included Eleanor and John David would have made the movie much longer and the film would have lost its focus.<p>As for Nash's illness itself, to give an accurate account would have made the film wander about without any real direction (which is exactly what Nash himself DID do for several years).  The 3 fictional characters are installed to bring the film a cohesive plot as well as a storyline with a considerable degree of symmetry.<p>Ron Howard does an outstanding job directing this film.  The cast, featuring Russell Crowe, Ed Harris, Christopher Plummer and Jennifer Connoley, is magnificent.  Particularly impressive is Crowe as this role is so very different from his notable performance in GLADIATOR.<p>This is a film that I would recommend everyone adding to their DVD collection.  Movies about the lives of atheletes are commonplace, but films that detail the stories of intellectuals are exceedingly scarce.  For that reason alone, I would admonish all persons to watch this movie.<p>Ultimately, this movie is a REPRESENTATION of Nash's life as opposed to a glossing over of actual events.  However, in Hollywood, as well as storytelling in general, style is something that may trump veracity.  For those who want the full story I recommend Nasar's book by the same name.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ENN25NFADE1X.html">A3ENN25NFADE1X</a><br/><p>Ron Howard and Russell Crowe have finally done it. This movie surprised me from beginning to end. I would have never expected Russell Crowe to give this kind of performance. I'm glad Ron Howard has finally shown his dark side. What I really noticed about this film, thinking about the effect of emotion on eye color, was that Russell's eye color changed from green to blue in some scenes.<br /><br />Ron Howard has shown me that his directing is comparable to Frances Ford Coppola's and Martin Scorsese's. The two roles that Russell Crowe played in The Insider and A Beautiful Mind completely top his Oscar winning role in Gladiator. I loved Jennifer Connely's acting in this movie and the chemistry between Russell and Jennifer was electrifying. People who've said Russell is a one note actor will have a different opinion after seeing this movie.<br /><br />I think Russell Crowe's acting in this film is comparable to my favorites, Marlon Brando and Robert Deniro. I believe there has never been a method actor who has demonstrated such gifted acting as Russell Crowe in this film "A Beautiful Mind."<br /><br />Russell Crowe reminds me of Deniro a lot because of the intensity and sensitive emotion's they both show when acting. Russell gives us a different picture of mental illness when he portrays this geeky, shy, arrogant Dr. Nash. I think this movie is an original movie about an original man, the brilliant genius John Forbes Nash Jr. He is trying to find his original idea and on the way he falls in love with his future wife Alicia, becomes schizophrenic, and begins his long journey to the discovery of a lifetime and what Really matters in life.</p></br><a href="../users/A1B350OHYHQTGX.html">A1B350OHYHQTGX</a><br/><p>I was so eager to watch this movie and it was truly worth it..! Usually Oscar winning drama movies have a different taste that you might have difficulties to swallow... but A Beautiful Mind keeps you thrilled and attached to the movie all the way until it ends... it's the kind of story that you never get enough from and keeps you curious until the end!<p>The movie is full of surprises all the way until the end... it's a story of love &amp; struggle and believing in yourself and your love! It's very touchy especially when you know it is a TRUE STORY!</p></br><a href="../users/A2Q457CES5ZUZ.html">A2Q457CES5ZUZ</a><br/><p>This is another grand triumph for director Ron Howard on the level of his big hit of the eighties, &quot;Cocoon,&quot; and another Oscar caliber performance by Russell Crowe, who dug within himself for the last ounce of intensity and feeling.  &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot; provides the trials and tribulations of a man who is exceedingly gifted on the one hand, while riddled with problems on the other.  Crowe does a superb job of balancing the highs and the lows of Nobel economics laureate John Forbes Nash, whose gifts in mathematics coincide with his schizophrenia.<p>Jennifer Connelly blends into the story mix with her highly supportive role of Crowe's wife.  When his long, hard struggle with adversity culminates in the Nobel Prize the emotional highlight of the film arises when Crowe looks into the audience and exclaims, while staring directly at Connelly, that he never could have realized his achievement without love.  He was paying his wife the highest tribute for her unflagging cooperation in the wake of adversity.<p>In dealing with a subject such as schizophrenia, Howard was confronted with the decision of just how to approach it.  He decided on a communicative vehicle that was highly cinematic and enriching in terms of understanding the man and his difficulties.  Howard presents dramatic sequences which Crowe as Nash was convinced actually occurred, even though they were imagined and were an integral part of his schizophrenia.  Ed Harris assumes the role of a master handler leading his subject to clandestine activities, the goal preventing the Soviets from unleashing their powerful nuclear arsenal against America.  Crowe also encounters a happy go lucky roommate who ultimately teaches literature at Harvard, a boozy, &quot;let's enjoy life&quot; intellectual with a reverence for D.H. Lawrence.  His irreverence and &quot;What's the difference?&quot; insouciance is a welcome contrast for Crowe to his own often tragic formality.  Crowe then meets the former roommate's young niece, for whom he quickly develops an affinity.  We then find out from Crowe's psychiatrist, played with just the proper note of empathic sensitivity by Christopher Plummer, that Crowe had no roommate while at Princeton!<p>Another interesting aspect of the film is the recognition by Crowe as Nash that he is truly different from other people.  &quot;We're a couple of odd ducks,&quot; he tells Connelly his student, girlfriend, and ultimately loyal wife.  We see how he copes with social awkwardness in his quest to become the best mathematician he can be.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>Writing a biography is always a tricky thing, causing debates over accuracy.  When some say this guy is a genius, others say he's just a lucky fellow.  And if the person in point is still alive, the case gets more complicated.  So, script writer Akiva Goldsman did something very unique in creating lifestory of John Nash, Nobel-Prize winning mathematician.  <p>Russel Crowe plays this real-life Princeton professor John Nash, whose gifted "beautiful mind" leads his heart to the places where no ordinary persons can imagine to go.  Full of youth, confidence, and a little bit of arrogance, John is finally recruited by America's prestigeous institute, after writing a paper that later greatly influence the theories in economics and other academic fields.  Soon he finds his love in one of his students, and his life seems going smoothly until one gentleman came to him, asking to crack the secret codes from Russia.<p>First, don't try to find anything authentic about Mr. Nashs life; the film is as real as those secret organizations depicted in 007 series.  The director Ron Howard and the writer Goldsman shows the "essence" of his suffering from schizophonia, which is to stay with John Nash from his youth until his age got advanced much later.  Here's the trick of the film (you must see it for yourself), which may leave some viewers embarrassed.  I know some critics who in effect claimed, with some justfication, that this film doesn't pay enough respect to patients of this disease, and I am not perfectly sure how to refute these detractors' claims.<p>The film has, let me assure you, been endowed with power coming from the leading actor Crowe, whose utter failure of "Proof of Life" should be now forgiven and forgotten.  Nash's delicate sensibility is expressed with his gifted performance, and very subtle nuance is conveyed with well-timed lines that suggest his fragile inner feelings (see, for instance, when he is beaten by one of his friends over the GO game, how he mutters with hurt pride: "This games is flawed.")  But it is not fair if he takes all the credits; look the superb job of his special make-up done by wizard Greg Cannom, whose previous work includes "Mrs. Doubtfire" and many, many others.  Remember his name, too.<p>The film ends, I am afraid, not with traditional happy-ending catharsis.  After so long painful years, he is given a Nobel Prize for what he had done long time ago, of which existence, most incredibly, he totally had forgotten.  It looks like a birthday present delivered too late, and you should be reminded one small fact of life: youth is easily lost when you really need it.  <p>Finally, if you ask me this film deserves Oscar, I would answer, considering the line-ups of other contenders of the year 2002, "Yes."  But it is also true (and I hope you think the same way) Ron Howard made better films in the past.  If he is given Oscar, he should have been given one for "Cocoon" or "Apollo 13."</p></br><a href="../users/A1UOTG037037XY.html">A1UOTG037037XY</a><br/><p>If he is the person responsible for his body of work, then John Nash cutely explained mathematically human decision making.  Kind of that game that celebrity poker players on tv play when they are bored, "What would Johnny Lautner(sp?) think?" where they guess what someone would think is the right answer about someone else NOT what the actual answer is - but what would Johnny or Jennifer think it is!"  That is a very cute and super impressive smart thing to create.  And could a crazy person (I don't believe there is such a thing as crazy) or rather someone who is distracted and exhausted by imaginary friends  - would he really be able to focus enough to carve out his excellent understanding of human nature and his strong mathematical ability to accomplish what John Nash did?  So I only watched the ending of the film because it looked unrelateable and unattractive to me, I couldn't trust any of the characters around the main character and I certainly don't enjoy people acting like crazy is an actual state of mind instead of an alibi to get away with murder a la Vincent "The Chin" Gigante (Jay Leno, anyone?)  Too bad that most of the movie is about flailing at invisible to everyone else Paul Bettany (WHO would imagine Paul Bettany?) instead of what the actual theory is because I bet a lot of Americans would be interested and really enjoy sitting around playing with his theory, at least people who enjoy following WWE and Gangstarapper gossip would.  So fun but unexplored by Richie Cunningham who doesn't make bad movies but I just don't understand why he focused on Nash's alleged cuckoo for cocoa puff-ness.  These are the kinds of people who should get accepted into the Ivy League, not name droppers, social climbers and show-offs!  We wouldn't envy people who got into these schools when we didn't; we'd be grateful and rejoice!</p></br><a href="../users/A1L8HRCM60W0W7.html">A1L8HRCM60W0W7</a><br/><p>I know Nash from game theory classes, specifically for his most prodigious econometric contribution that's popularly known as Nash Equilibrium, a way of describing how people caught in a strategic decision-making situation may respond based on their assumptions about each others' behaviour.<br /><br />Not only is that pivotal element skipped (except for fine print in the epilogue), casual viewers may also come away thinking that he was some sort of cross between a paranoid pseudo-codebreaker gone awry, and a crazy genius who devised a mathematical approach for picking up women and then forgot all about it.<br /><br />Russel Crowe may have been twice as credible if he didn't struggle to imitate Geoffrey Rush in Shine or Fred Gwynne as one of the Munsters. Well, Ok, I am over-analyzing. Jennifer Connelly does well to potray a doting wife, but the fact that his real-world wife had divorced Nash is totally ignored. For that matter, we're never even told that their son, also an ingenious math whiz and a schizophrenic, suffered as much at the hands of fate and society as his father.<br /><br />Why was a more honest, less Hollywoodized depiction of the mathematician so difficult to manage? None of such facts would have lessened Nash's accomplishment or undermined the originality of his contributions, but their omission suggests that the director was not confident in addressing the audience as grown-ups.<br /><br />If you know little about John Nash -- the troubled, violent, gifted mathematician --  this may come across as a very well made movie, as the numerous accolades it bagged may prove. But the film in its half-baked form is a bit of a gyp for anyone who knows a bit about the man and his much grander complexity. I still give it three stars for holding your attention, but I wonder if anyone would willingly watch it more than once.</p></br><a href="../users/A3S98L5B1SR9P1.html">A3S98L5B1SR9P1</a><br/><p>Truly awe-inspiring. A beautiful work piece that is never disappointing. Wonderful cinematography. Unlike this review, the movie flows gracefully without being choppy. There are so many more good things to be said about this movie. 2 more things: Russel Crow is such an amazing actor and seems to perfectly elude the character of John Nash. James Horner does some excellent work with the score, although it does seem to be a little repetative in some places.</p></br><a href="../users/A38U2M9OAEJAXJ.html">A38U2M9OAEJAXJ</a><br/><p>"A Beautiful Mind" has been the subject of much pre-Oscar controversy; some of the charges against this film are more valid than others.  Critics have been coming out of the woodwork and accusing director Ron Howard of dodging some throny issues in his film biography of math wizard John Nash (accusations have ranged from Nash's alleged homosexuality to even anti-semitism).  In addition, the casting of Jennifer Connelly as Nash's long suffering wife has provoked the wrath of some in the Latino community (Nash's wife is really from El Salvador).  Regardless of the above, "A Beautiful Mind" is a good film on its own terms.  Russell Crowe gives a powerhouse performance as the professor suffering with scizophrenia.  This must have been a tricky role to play, but Crowe pulls it off without faking a single move.  Jennifer Connelly was better in the far edgier "Requiem for a Dream," but she shines in her role as the long-suffering wife.  Howard competently directs the film with feeling and at a reasonable pace, although the spotlight really belongs to Crowe.  I wouldn't look to this film for hard facts on Nash, but nonetheless I recommend it on the strength of the film's stellar performances.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IANEBSMVGHS9.html">A1IANEBSMVGHS9</a><br/><p>Rusell Crowe comes back with an outstanding performance that brings back to mind his role in Michael Mann's "The Insider," where he played the role of a former executive from a tobacco company that becomes persecuted by the company because how much he knew. This time around, he plays the role of mathematician John Nash, a brilliant mind who stands out of the rest of his peers while he attended Princeton. This put him in a position where he was bound to be involved with the Department of Defense in Top Secret operations, as "the world's best natural code-braker." However his mind plays games with him and drives him down a cliff of paranoia, ending up diagnosed with schizophrenia. His trip back from this problem with the help of his loving wife Alicia (played by beautiful Jennifer Connelly -"Requiem for a Dream") takes a central place in the movie, until he learns to live with the visions of his past that surround him while he gets in touch once again with what's real in life...<p>A movie with a beautiful message of what's possible with the help of love and determination. See it. You will like it.</p></br><a href="../users/A13H7Q4JVK6DTV.html">A13H7Q4JVK6DTV</a><br/><p>I bought this movie because everybody was saying it was good but when I saw it I thought it was long and boring I mean in order to see it you need a dictionary to understand each word they say in it or be really smart , but what I found interesting was the twist which fooled me and I like it because how it was presented. The dvd has lots of stuff for you to watch which is pretty good but thats about it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2KB14WCZ1DVE3.html">A2KB14WCZ1DVE3</a><br/><p>There are some problems with seeing a movie for the first time a few months after it's release.  You read reviews and the side articles, and an image appears in your mind as to what you are about to see even before you see it.  You read how much of the movie is fiction.  You read (and read and read) articles about how Russell Crowe is such a jerk.  And then you actually see the movie.  <p>With all the above baggage, there is added about halfway through the film a turn that throws you for a loop.  Not exactly the same way as &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; or &quot;The Others&quot;, but the same in the sense that you are jolted into rethinking what you have been shown.  Unlike those other two movies, where the shockers are at the end, and it explains everything, in this movie, it appears in the middle.  You now have the rest of the movie to decide if you've been cheated.  Without revealing anything, I'll say, like the other two movies, all the clues are there if you've paid attention. <p>So I liked it for that, and I liked it for the performances.  I didn't like Russell Crowe in &quot;Gladiator&quot; because he was too much of a superman.  But in this one you get to see a performance of a character who probably thinks he is the smartest person in the world, and therefore somehow evolutionarily above just about everyone else.  To see some humbleness being introduced when this crumbles is done very well.  When he regains his prestige, however, he descends into another kind of hell, and it's not so much the descent as the recovery that is heartwarming.  Once again, he finds he has to interact with other humans to truly find happiness.<p>There is also a great supporting cast, especially Jennifer Connelly.  During the first part of the movie, there is nothing special there, but as Crowe's illness reaches dangerous levels, how she takes over is work that deserves the Oscar she got.  Considering she has to interact with someone who most of the time would prefer not to interact with anyone, how she finally gets into his world helps make the movie a joy to watch.</p></br><a href="../users/A26JGAM6GZMM4V.html">A26JGAM6GZMM4V</a><br/><p>My high rating is based on the superior quality of acting, of course, but also on what I (a layman) view as an exceptionally effective dramatic visual presentation of schizophrenic paranoia. Characters which interact with Nash throughout the film accomplish for me what an expert's clinical (albeit patient) explanation never could. Given the number of people afflicted with this disease, especially those among them not as yet correctly diagnosed, much less properly treated, this film will serve commendable humanitarian purposes while at the same time providing superior entertainment. Ron Howard and all of his associates are to be commended for their unique and compelling cinematic achievement.</p></br><a href="../users/ABN5K7K1TM1QA.html">ABN5K7K1TM1QA</a><br/><p>This resulted in four well-deserved Academy Awards in 2002: Best Picture for Brian Grazer and the people at Imagine Entertainment, Ron Howard for his direction, Jennifer Connelly for her supporting role, and Akive Goldsman for his script adapted from Sylvia Nasar's biography.  It is a beautiful and touching movie, uplifting and full of a lot of things that Hollywood does very well.<br /><br />Russell Crowe is believable as the arrogant yet vulnerable mathematician John Nash who fell into paranoid schizophrenia while an undergraduate at Princeton University.  A philandering and selfish man who is paradoxically almost as lovable as Albert Einstein, Nash can also be humble and exhibit a wry, self-effacing sense of humor.  To me he is a great hero, not because of his work in Game Theory for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics, but because he is one of the very few people ever to conquer, as it were, schizophrenia.<br /><br />In the outstanding documentary from The American Experience PBS series, "A Brilliant Madness" (2002) Nash explains how he did it: he just stopped listening to the voices.  The voices that the paranoid schizophrenic hears are inside his head and they are amazingly persuasive; the delusions are as compelling as monstrous personages come to life, vivid, demanding, in many ways more "real" than the reality we normally experience.  So it really was heroic of John Nash to come to grips with his delusions and to mentally shove them aside.  The vast majority of paranoid schizophrenics can never do that.<br /><br />Yet the movie merely resembles his life and his singular experience.  Goldsman's script and Howard's direction take the life of John Nash and distill the essence of his triumph while brushing aside many of the unpleasant and non-heroic details.  I don't object to this because this movie is clearly aimed at the widest possible audience, and I appreciate the wisdom of that approach.  But for those of you interested in a more comprehensive and objective picture of the man I can recommend both the documentary mentioned above and Nasar's biography.  I especially found it valuable to view the one-hour documentary because to actually see the man and to hear him speak allowed me to better appreciate the fine performance by Russell Crowe.<br /><br />I found Jennifer Connelly absolutely mesmerizing as Alicia (not to mention gorgeous).  Ed Harris was a hardcore graphic nightmare as the unrelenting Parcher while Paul Bettany was intriguing and clever as Nash's nonexistent buddy.  Howard's direction not only got excellent work from everybody, but he was able to bring the pathos and exhilaration of Nash's life to the audience in a very satisfying way emotionally.  If you can watch this without shedding a tear or two you may want to check your synaptic connections.  Incidentally the makeup work on Crowe and Connelly to allow us the illusion of the passing years was outstanding (and got an Oscar nomination).<br /><br />The key to the movie and to Howard's vision is the way that the real world and the Nash's delusional world are meshed.  It's clear he wanted to compel the audience to share the paranoid schizophrenic experience.  While not a paranoid schizophrenic myself I have known people who are, and I have had similar, limited experiences myself under certain, shall we say, circumstances.  The sheer terror that can sometimes be felt came through in the car chase scene (yes, Howard managed to get one in) while Nash's obsessive energy was revealed on the walls of the rooms that he had completely covered with pages from magazines that he had frantically searched looking for secret Soviet codes.<br /><br />Some quibbles: while undergraduates loved beer then as they do now, they did not in 1946 go out for pizza, and if they had they would have called it "pizza pie."  There were no pizza parlors and no pizza at the market.  If you went to an Italian restaurant you had spaghetti or ravioli, and the pizza that was served was mostly bread with a thin topping of cheese and sauce, nothing like the great thin platters we have today.<br /><br />New Zealander Russell Crowe's West Virginia accent faded in some scenes only to return strong in another.  Incidentally he is not to be confused with Cameron Crowe, who wrote the script for Fast Times at Ridgemont High (1982) and directed such films as Jerry Maguire (1996) and Almost Famous (2000).  Russell Crowe has starred in a number of excellent movies including Proof (1991), LA Confidential (1997), The Insider (1999), etc.<br /><br />Also, no mention in the movie is made of Nash's homosexual experiences nor of his running away to Europe or his desire to renounce his US citizenship.  I understand that Howard decided to leave out the homosexual angle because associating homosexuality with schizophrenia would open a can of worms that would detract from the theme of the movie.  Also left out was Nash's other paternity with a woman he never married.<br /><br />Nash is not a saint, but he is a hero, and this beautiful movie is a fine tribute to him and his accomplishments.</p></br><a href="../users/A11PTCZ2FM2547.html">A11PTCZ2FM2547</a><br/><p>This moving, very stirring film required several viewings on my part.  First of all, I had to get over the disappointment that A BEAUTIFUL MIND beat out &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; as the Best Picture of 2001--a disappointment that created an inherent bias in my not-so-beautiful mind.  Second, all of the Hollywood embellishments in this film had to be dismissed as inconsequential to the overall magnitude of the story--a story about a very real man with a very real illness.<p>And it is here--the story--that A BEAUTIFUL MIND excels.  The human mind is a complex, often unforgiving organ that tends to confuse its owner over what is real, and what is an illusion.  And thus the distinction between reality and illusion becomes blurred, a disturbing development that leads to complete dysfunction.  Princeton mathematician John Nash succumbed to the power of his mind to distort reality; the resulting battle to conquer his demons--aided by the unwavering support of a loving wife--is a compelling, wonderful story.<p>Russell Crowe delivers a riveting performance, but needs to work on his West Virgina accent.  Jennifer Connelly, Christopher Plummer, and Ed Harris are sensational.  I'm still a little miffed that this film won Best Picture, but darn glad A BEAUTIFUL MIND is in my video collection.<br />--D.

However, I know little about the subject.  Further, I know very little about John Nash's life.  Therefore, any criticism related to either I must ignore because of the beauty of the movie and the triumph of the character.<p>John Nash is one of those very rare people on spaceship earth:  a true genius.  The movie does a pretty decent job at providing examples of his genius.  There's no need to dwell on the subject, because it's pretty evident from his mannerisms that this guy is in a place that you and I will never truly understand.<p>Russell Crowe is more than good in the role of John Nash, he is truly outstanding.  As I compare his performance in &quot;Gladiator&quot; to his performance in this movie, which stretches his abilities significantly in areas that &quot;Gladiator&quot; merely explored, I have come to realize that Russell Crowe is a one of the great actors of our time.  Perhaps schizophrenia is not as seamless as portrayed in the movie, but with 120 minutes to work with, I was thoroughly convinced.<p>I was also very absorbed by the choice that Nash made.  He could either keep taking the medication, or choose to fight his problem and regain his mathematical abilities, and some control over his life.  He chose the second.  To make such a choice reminded me of Charlie in a similarly poignant story, &quot;Flowers for Algernon&quot; by Daniel Keyes, which was the basis for the movie &quot;Charley&quot; with Cliff Robertson.  Only in that story Charlie had no choice he could make other than to fight.  In a way, Nash fought and never truly won, but was able to overcome his difficulties well enough to be functional.<p>Jennifer Connelly, who I enjoyed in &quot;Labyrinth&quot;, &quot;The Rocketeer&quot; and &quot;Dark City&quot;, among others, is all grown up and performs at the same level as Russell Crowe, well deserving of an Oscar.  Jennifer too deserves the appellation of &quot;great&quot;.  She will definitely be in high demand in the future.  By the way, she is prettier than she has ever been.<p>This edition of the movie features 2 discs with all kinds of extras.  I don't quite understand why the full screen edition costs more than the wide screen edition (which is what I purchased), but either is worth the price.  I won't bother to give you all the extras you get, but there is a lot.<p>I found that at the end of the movie I got a bit teary-eyed, and my wife did not.  After discussing the movie with several other people, I found that for some reason this movie tends to be more emotional for men than women.  I was unable to find a good reason for this, but I find the phenomenon interesting, since usually it is the other way around.  My point is that if you found the ending moving and left you with a really good feeling, then you probably understood the movie and this is clearly a movie you should own.  If you sat there and said to yourself, &quot;What in the heck was that all about?&quot;, then this isn't the movie for you.</p></br><a href="../users/A23QOAXJSWIBS6.html">A23QOAXJSWIBS6</a><br/><p>Well, it appears that this film made enough academy members weep and decide finally to throw an Oscar Ron Howard's way (which he truly has deserved in the past), but this film is not nearly as remarkable or memorable as these awards would suggest.  [Just read what the serious reviewers had to say at rottentomatoes.]<p>In addition to the fact that it is in essence a &quot;fictionalization&quot; of Nash's life, I found the film uneven and, gasp, even boring!  And what's worse, much to my friends' horror, I found I didn't even care about the John Nash portrayed in the film.  As portrayed he is certainly a tragic figure, but despite Howard's often over-wrought style, Crowe's Nash is not particularly noble, courageous or even likable.  I didn't feel much if anything for this man, but I know that I'm supposed to like him because that's Russell Crowe up there on the screen and that's Ron Howard directing him.  Well, rather than swallow this bland bait, I'd rather watch something meaningful.  I guess that's why I'm not an academy voter...<p>If you want to watch this as a work of fiction, and you can stomach the manipulative tenor of Howard's direction, I guess you'll like &quot;A Beautiful Mind.&quot;  If, however, you care about legitimate portrayals of historical figures, and you'd rather not have the director play on your emotions without any real substance to back it up, don't bother.  There are scores of films that are much more beautiful out there.</p></br><a href="../users/A1S3C5OFU508P3.html">A1S3C5OFU508P3</a><br/><p>From the perspective of the working mathematician, the good news is that a major feature film blockbuster was made about a mathematician. The bad news is that the major reason it was made was due to his mental illness. John Nash is a mathematician whose work in the theory of games won him a Nobel Prize in economics, and yet he suffers from mental illness that was so severe that he sometimes literally lived in another world.<br /> Mathematically speaking, the producers do as good a job as possible of explaining the significance of Nash's work. Using the model of lecherous graduate students cooperating in an attempt to woo the sexual favors of a beautiful woman made for a very funny scene. Some of the scenes are very intense, and there are times when you really do not know what is portraying accurate events and what is simply due to the actions of Nash's mind. Russell Crowe is superb as John Nash, he plays all scenes very well, especially those where he is acting out the fantasies.<br /> As is always the case, the producers use a great deal of poetic license in portraying the actual events of Nash's life. Nevertheless, there are some scenes that are very accurate and that math professors can relate to. The later scenes of him in a classroom and when his colleagues pay tribute to him are very touching and do accurately portray the life of a professor. I feel that all mathematicians should watch this film. Not for the mathematics or the history, but for the realization that the public will appreciate a good story, even if it involves a schizophrenic mathematical genius.<p>Charles Ashbacher, co-editor, Journal of Recreational Mathematics</p></br><a href="../users/A3L2U581LL17EB.html">A3L2U581LL17EB</a><br/><p>A Beautiful Mind is not a great movie, certainly not 2001's best film, but it's a respectable effort from director Ron Howard, and especially writer Akiva Goldsman, who was partially responsible for the travesty that was Batman and Robin. This biographical drama focuses on the life of John Nash, the genius who developed a radical concept on game theory. I'd rather not say further about the story, since there's a big plot twist halfway through that definitely puts a spin on much of the material that came before it.<p>As most have heard, A Beautiful Mind is largely inaccurate in its depiction of John Nash's life. Did I really care? Not particularly. I'd be a fool to expect a film based on facts to adhere entirely to the truth. Rather, I'm basing my opinion on how well-crafted the movie is, and how well it succeeded on what it was trying to be, that is, a film meant to inspire with its theme of love (and besides, I seriously doubt all the indiscretions of Nash's life would mesh well with that, so I'm wondering if the film's detractors really want to see all of Nash's odd behavior portrayed or if they're just looking for something to complain about). So how does this film come across as a feel good drama? Not bad.<p>First off, I'd like to mention that Ron Howard's direction and Goldsman's screenwriting are easily the film's weakest points, and not deserving of the Oscars they received. As has been evident in previous works, Howard is not a master of subtlety, and as best as he tries, he obviously doesn't have a firm grasp of what's genuinely good drama. A lot of the film's emotional moments are overdone and pure Hollywood; there's typical shouting, crying, and glass-breaking, nothing I haven't seen before.  While I have a lot to complain about Howard's direction, he's fine when it comes to pacing and style, and yes, the film itself does look very lovely and polished.<p>Definitely by far the film's weakest segment is in the last ten or so minutes, when we witness Nash age and receive his nobel prize. That alone doesn't sound so awful, but unfortunately, we get a speech that lamely hammers home the movie's message, that of how we must rely on emotion and love over cold intellect to solve our problems and survive in this world. It had already seemed obvious that was what the film had been striving to say throughout its rather lengthy running time, and I sure as hell didn't need Howard to blindly forcefeed the theme in such a manner.<p>Since I've done nothing but complain up to this point, you might wonder why it is I consider this film above average. The answer's simple. This all works thanks to Russell Crowe as John Nash and Jennifer Connelly as his wife, particularly the latter, who delivers a magnificent performance worthy of far more screen time (it's all the more disappointing to see that we never even find out what she does for a living, considering she was the one supporting Nash in his later, troubled years). Crowe is in very fine form in the lead, both sympathetic and likeable, though some of his tics seem more like obvious attempts at acting rather than genuine eccentric behavior.<p>Schizophrenia is a disease that's dealt with in the film. I've never studied up much on it, though on my paltry knowledge alone, I probably know far more than most Hollywood (most often, as in the case with Me, Myself, and Irene, filmmakers seem to think schizophrenia is just another term for multiple identity disorder). (moderate spoiler) I don't know how accurate A Beautiful Mind's portrayal of this mental illness is, but the Nash in the movie hardly seems like a true "loony," and the film makes the disease seem a bit easier to handle than it probably is (Nash sees a few people who aren't there, and at one point, even reasons that they can't be there). Much like the rest of the film, the handling of this topic feels Hollywood, but also like the rest of the film, it's handled competently and in a fairly riveting fasion.<br />*** 1/2 out of *****</p></br></body></html>

Some reviewers approach this movie seriously as if it is a metaphor for something important. It's a good (not great) action movie with a sense of humor. Lighten up & be entertained.<br />  Briefly, something goes wrong in space. The five principals are over exposed to radiation causing them to mutate. Each aquires a super power. The villian, Victor von Doom (really) is turning into metal & aquiring magnetic powers. Jessica Alba, is Susan Storm can become invisible & create a force field. Reed, is the leader, a genius & has aquired extreme flexibility, i.e. "rubber man". He's in love with Susan & is basically a dork. Michael Chiklis is Ben, "the thing" is really built, has super-human strength & a wry sense of humor. Johnny Storm is Susan's younger brother & enjoys being the  "human torch" & learning how to fly. He is horny & juvenile. On that note, I don't agree with the PG-13 rating. This is a kid movie. Jessica strips down to her skivvies once but that is actually funny not erotic. She has to take her clothes off because they do not become invisible. You don't see anything else because she is ah... invisible. Reed works in a lab to return them back to normal. Von Doom doesn't cooperate, as he enjoys his power & being a freak. So the good guys fight him & have adventures in New York City. They defeat him but don't kill him. He is merely neutralized to reappear, in the sequel of course. It's not as good as Spiderman or Batman but it's not trying to be. It's just what you see & no more & that's okay.</p></br><a href="../users/A3O536E2YOKK4Y.html">A3O536E2YOKK4Y</a><br/><p>I own FF comics from the 60's, 70's, 80's and 90's. My first favorite comic as a kid was Fantastic Four; my favorite superhero was The Thing and my favorite villain was Doctor Doom. I was naturally looking foward to this film version.<br /><br />The casting is one of the highlights. I admit that I had my doubts regarding Jessica Alba as Sue Storm and especially Ioan Gruffudd as Reed Richards, but Alba does a fine job and Gruffudd was very much on the mark as "Mr. Fantastic" (giggle).  As for the Human Torch and The Thing, Chris Evans and Michael Chiklis are truly outstanding in their respective roles.<br /><br />What we have to understand is that the film is the ORIGIN story, so the characters are all relatively young here. Reed & Ben are probably only about thirty years old at this time (or slightly older), Sue is in her mid-twenties and Johnny is in his early twenties. Needless to say, don't expect to see a depiction of the Fantastic Four from issue #555!<br /><br />Some have also complained that The Thing is missing his notable rocky eyebrow but, once again, the story takes place when they first get their powers. Those of us who know our FF history know very well that he had no defining eyebrow back then. Only as he mutated over time did the eyebrow appear.<br /><br />What has always separated the Fantastic Four from other comic heros is that they're a FAMILY; and all the character hallmarks of this family are wonderfully depicted in this film: Johnny & Ben's fighting, Hothead's likable show off-ness and arrogance, Reed's great intellect yet total lack of common-sense social skills, The Thing's grumbling struggle over being a monster and outcast, Reed's obsessive attempts to give The Thing back his humanity, as well as his attempts to restrain Ben when he has an understandable temper tantrum, Sue & Johnny's sister/brother bickering, etc.<br /><br />Other notable FF hallmarks are present as well: The Baxter Building, Victor Von Doom, Latveria and Ben's blind girlfriend Alicia Masters. Heck, even mailman Willie Lupkin is here, naturally played by FF creator Stan Lee. Also, Sue Storm's original hero moniker "the Invisible GIRL" is even poked fun at.<br /><br />Doctor Doom is perhaps the greatest comics villain of all-time and they picked a very fitting actor for the role, Julian McMahon. As for the idea of linking Doom's origin with the FF members, I don't personally mind this, minor changes are naturally to be expected when changing mediums. Where they went wrong, however, was to fail to show Victor become truly scarred and hideous -- the very reason he came to create and wear the mask and armor. Yes, there was a little scarring but it wasn't enough.<br /><br />Doom's costume is hit-and-miss: the hood and mask look great but the rest of it deviates too far from his great costume in the comics. Still, this was an acceptable alteration.<br /><br />In the comics Doctor Doom had a definite diabolical charismatic presence that would give you goosebumps. There's a little bit of this feeling in the film but it's swept away when the good Doctor SPEAKS. Yes, when Doom talks his dialogue and voice are so wimpy and unthreatening that it pretty much ruins the part. These missteps with the character of Doctor Doom are the sole reasons I give the film 4 Stars instead of 5.<br /><br />Some criticize that the material isn't serious enough, and maybe the creators did go a little overboard here and there with a bit of zaniness, but the overall tone is serious. Make no mistake, although there is a lot of humor (which is an essential part of life), this is not a campy jokefest. People must understand that the FF are a very colorful, fun group of superheroes; they're not dark like Daredevil or Batman. Hence, "Fantastic Four" is a fittingly fun, colorful and brisk film, yet it remains an essentially serious story.<br /><br />One thing I fail to comprehend is the ridiculous bashing this film has received. "Fantastic Four" is every bit as good as "X-Men" which came out in 2000; both films are about the origin of a superhero team. Have we been so spoiled by the great superhero films since then (e.g. Spider-Man 1 & 2, X-Men 2, Daredevil Director's cut, Batman Begins, etc.) that we can no longer recognize or appreciate what is truly a fine comic film? If "Fantastic Four" came out in 2000 before "X-Men" it would have been deemed a superhero masterpiece.<br /><br />So many people rave about how great "Spider-Man 2" is, and it is a very well-done superhero film, but what about that stupid subplot regarding Peter losing his spider-powers because of his lack of confidence? Since when did Peter's spider-powers depend on his confidence? His powers were derived from a radioactive spider bite; hence, his powers would not come-and-go depending on his confidence level! I'm just pointing out that, as good as "Spider-Man 2" is, it is not without its flaws.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: This is a good and fun film verion of the Fantastic Four. The missteps with Doctor Doom are its only real shortcomings. If you like or love the Fantastic four, or just have a casual interest in them, you'll likely enjoy this flick. If not, why are you reading this?</p></br><a href="../users/A36NUDST4Y5JBA.html">A36NUDST4Y5JBA</a><br/><p>Gang, I read the Fantastic Four comic books as a pre-teen.  It's a joke to me that FF got this treatment.  Reed Richards, down on his luck?  Reed Richards/Sue Richards, not together?  Victor von Doom, financing their work?  Even worse, Kirby is buying in to this scheme?  Give me a break.  I won't waste my money! Two stars...</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>I was floored at the mere fact that I did not hate this film.  I didn't want to see it, but when there is nothing else to do I decide to watch something I can later turn around and review, so this was sitting at my house (my sister brought it over) and so I decided to sit down and give it a watch through.  I actually enjoyed it.  It wasn't nearly as corny as I expected, and aside from Jessica Alba (yes she's utterly gorgeous but my god is she a terrible actress) the acting was decent for a superhero flick.  Julian McMahon is one of my favorite TV actors (I just love Christian on `Nip/Tuck') and here, as Victor Von Doom, he's the perfect bad guy.  Michael Chiklis does a great job as thing and Chris Evans fits in nice as the hot shot Johnny Storm.  This isn't your `Spider-Man' or `Batman Begins' so don't expect something deep or meaningful or something altogether `fantastic' but if you aren't expecting anything you might just find that this offers something worth watching.  It's fun, breezy and at times cleverly exciting.</p></br><a href="../users/A29Y34ALWJUGB5.html">A29Y34ALWJUGB5</a><br/><p>I'm going to keep this review short, because the movie really wasn't that good. Fantastic Four is the latest in a saturated market, and it fails in almost every aspect except excellent special effects. The characters are cliche, as is the bad guy. The dialogue is repetitive (usually about either loving or hating their powers). The action is sparse and over way to quick, and the ending itself was cheap. And the ending is both predictable and clipped, with the super heroes coming together for one final blast of an attack to defeat their foe. Then, of course, there was the "monster egg" ending, that left you wanting more. Only in the case of this movie, it really didn't leave you wanting much. In fact, it solidified my personal want to quickly eject the DVD from my DVD player and return.<br /><br />I can't recommend this to any kind of movie lover. Some of you out there who enjoyed the comic books may find something worth watching here, but I would never recommend buying this DVD, as it is a waste of money, especially when there is so many other choices out there. Rent it or borrow it; if you enjoy Fantastic Four, then consider buying it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2F3M93RRLFQNJ.html">A2F3M93RRLFQNJ</a><br/><p>Among the first comic books I ever bought, nearly 30 years ago, was a Fantastic Four, somewhere around issue 180.  Since then, I have read the comic book off and on for years at a stretch and seen both highs and lows in the series.  In other words, I'm a long-time fan, and when before I saw this movie, I had mixed expectations.  Marvel adaptations have been all over the quality map, from the great Spiderman and X-Men movies, through the so-so Punisher and Hulk, to the wholly forgettable Elektra.<br /><br />This film falls squarely in the middle of this spectrum.  For those unfamiliar with the story, it deals with four people - scientist Reed Richards, his buddy Ben Grimm, Reed's ex-girlfriend Sue Storm and her brother Johnny - who are exposed to cosmic rays and get super powers.  As Mr. Fantastic, Reed can reshape and stretch his body as if it were rubber; Sue becomes the Invisible Girl, who also can create force fields; Johnny is the Human Torch, a living man of flame; and Ben, in a way tragically, becomes the monstrous but superstrong Thing.  Together, they are the Fantastic Four, and unlike most superheroes, they have no secret identities but instead are all well-known to the public.<br /><br />Opposing them is Victor von Doom, who sadly is one of the principal flaws in the movie.  In the comics, Dr. Doom is one of the best all-time villains (probably only behind Lex Luthor and the Joker in comic book villaindom), a genius who uses technology and a touch of the supernatural to commit his crimes.  Dr. Doom was probably a partial inspiration for that great screen villain, Darth Vader.  In this movie, he is superpowered and actually a rather routine villain, a technocrat who seems little more than a retread of the Green Goblin from Spiderman.<br /><br />Michael Chiklis, as always, does a good acting job.  Jessica Alba looks pretty but like most of the rest of the cast, is not all that great at acting.  While reasonably faithful to the comic book concepts of the characters (for example, Reed's intellectualism or Johnny's rashness), the story itself is just so-so.  I suppose a good deal of the problem is so much time is spent on the origin of the FF that we don't get much of the four acting as an actual team.  Perhaps a sequel would work better, as often happens in other comic adaptations; without wasting so much time on the origin story, we can get a better plot.<br /><br />But things aren't all bad.  The effects are good and there are some reasonably amusing or touching moments.  I credit Chiklis with a lot of these, as he makes the Thing the most interesting character (and sometimes the only one) in the movie.  If I seem harsh on this film, I guess it's because I've seen how good the comic could be and see a lot of wasted potential in the movie.  If you're unfamiliar with the comic book, this will probably be a likeable movie, but fans of the comic may be disappointed.</p></br><a href="../users/A2J57EQ9KPGXR9.html">A2J57EQ9KPGXR9</a><br/><p>Wow. What happened to this film? It was supposed to be this Summer's big hit. While watching this movie at the local $2 theatre, the answer came to me: Design by committee. A bunch of Hollywood execs got together to create this movie. Why else would they cast Jessica Alba as Sue Richards?<br /><br />This also explains why Doctor Doom looks like a big green, corny dialog spewing Van Der Graf generator.<br /><br />Fantastic Four was supposed to be this big blockbuster but hype can only carry a movie so far. If the makers of this loud movie bothered to pick up and read one FF comic, I think that the movie would have been alot better.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R36DZQEWNVJ1.html">A3R36DZQEWNVJ1</a><br/><p>Reed Richards, Ben Grimm, Susan Storm,her brother Johnny Storm and Victor Von Doom all get struck by a storm in space and soon after they all start to change....I mean literally. Reed Richards, played by Ioan Gruffudd (King Arthur), can stretch any part of his body....he's rubber. Ben Grimm a.k.a. The Thing, played by Michael Chikilis (FX'S The Shield), transforms completley into solid rock...even his heart is made of rock. Susan Storm, played by Jessica Alba (Sin City), can make herself go invisible and her brother Johnny Storm, played by Chris Evans (Cellular), can yell "flame on" or snap his fingers and his whole body can turn into flames and he can also fly.....these 4 are the Fantastic Four. On the otherside of the table there is the 5th member, Victor Von Doom, played by Julian McMahon (FX'S Nip/Tuck), who finds out his whole body is becoming metallic....he can manipulate things like light fixtures and sockets in the walls. Then, Von Doom gets really pissed off at the Fantastic 4 sprouting "this is what happens when someone truly embraces their destiny" and he tries to get rid of the Fantastic 4. What this movie needs is a shot of adrenaline. When the action kicks in towards the end it goes somewhere but the corny stuff in the middle we dont need. Michael Chiklis gives an unimpressive performance, Ioan Gruffudd is so-so, Jessica Alba was too weak and Chris Evans was too over the top in his performance but he did have his moments. Only Julian McMahon as Von Doom was the highlight because McMahon can play a sinister bastard pretty darn good and he kept the movie at bay for the most part. Some of the dialouge, basically one liners from the 4 are really stupid. Truly doesnt have nothing on what Batman Begins offered which was much better. Of course there is the cameo by Stan Lee, creator....some might spot him, some might not.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>People in my theater actually clapped and cheered when this film ended and that alone is a rare thing. It is a lot of fun and I almost didn't see it due to the harsh critical pounding this movie has been taking. It isn't as good as X-Men 2 or Batman Begins, but I prefer it over Hulk and the Spiderman films. The acting and special effects are good, but both are lacking at times. Jessica Alba is one of the hottest women on the planet and is a nice visual treat that makes up for her decent acting skills. The Human Torch and The Thing were both great in the acting department (loved the back and forth trash talk) and were the best characters in my opinion. Mr. Fantastic was a boring nerd, but that is what his part called for and he played it well. Dr. Doom was much better than expected and I liked the fact that the actor didn't overact the part to the degree that we are use to in comic book films. Go see this film with low expectations and you will be surprised big time. This is a worthy addition to the Marvel movie franchise.</p></br><a href="../users/AILBDL6ATVDCJ.html">AILBDL6ATVDCJ</a><br/><p>I read the professional reviews by people like Roger Ebert.  I ignored their negative attacks and went to go see this film.  I am very glad I did.  I found this movie to have a little bit of everything and a whole lot of action.<br /><br />Let's start off with an explanation of why Ebert didn't like this film: Roger Ebert is an extreme LIBERAL and a politically correct junkie; unless a film has some "leftist message" or has a "leftist actor" in it, he probably is going to knock it.  This film is NOT politically correct, has no jokes bashing the current president, doesn't support abortion or euthanasia, and doesn't take a stand on gay rights.  Of course Ebert is going to hate the film!  Ebert has taken that whole "liberal arts" thing completely out of context.<br /><br />Oh, one more thing, had this film sprinkled the "F" word in every thirty or forty seconds, had some severe love scenes, and showed the cast helping little old bag ladies across the street in between real emergencies, Ebert would have put his useless thumbs up!<br /><br />I have read some reviews about how this was just a comic book made into a film. DUH!  That's exactly what it is, and exactly what I expected to see when I sat down with my garbage bag full of popcorn and gallon of Coca-Cola in a crowded theater.<br /><br />Fantastic 4 is an action-packed film with a lot of laughs and a lot of action.  Also, this film did a lot more to build up the audience's disdain for the bad guy, Victor Von Doom.  Spider-Man 2 failed to do that, and in my opinion, if a movie fails to make the audience want to see the bad guy get smashed then it's failed to do its job.<br /><br />On to the cast:<br /><br />Ioan Gruffudd as Reed Richards is a perfect fit.  He catches the personality perfect, and it was fun to watch him try and keep the other members of the Fantastic 4 inline.<br /><br /> Jessica Alba as Sue Storm worked for me.  Yeah, I've read the reviews here at Amazon.  I know she's a cutie and all that.  But I'm a happily married man, and besides, my wife might see this review.  So I'll just tell ya that I think she is the best Sue Storm ever!  Seriously, she can act, and I really enjoyed her work on screen with Ioan (does anyone even know how to pronounce that) and the rest of the cast.<br /><br />Chris Evans turns in his best performance to date as Johnny Storm.  He really made the film fun to watch.  Of course some of the credit has to go to Michael France and Mark Frost for writing such an excellent script / screenplay.<br /><br />Michael Chiklis is the perfect Ben Grimm.  My thirteen-year-old daughter was balling her eyes out when he was trying to pick up his wife's wedding ring on the bridge.  Never has any person so nailed a super-hero character the way Chiklis does in this film.  I used to read the Fantastic 4 comic books as a kid, and I would have never dreamed the Thing could have ever made it to the big screen in such a convincing manner.  Great job Chiklis!  I think you should put the suit back on and pay Roger Ebert a visit!<br /><br />Julian McMahon, I just want to let you know that I hated you from the opening scenes on!  You make me sick; exactly what a bad guy is supposed to do.  Great job as Victor Von Doom.  I hope there is a sequel.  I'd like to see if you could pull it off two times in a row.<br /><br />I liked everything about this movie: the writing, casting, special effects, music, and even the movie posters.  I think the professional movie critics who panned this movie need to find new careers.  Fantastic 4 rocks!  I will buy this DVD the second it is released.  No, I don't buy illegal DVDs, so yes, I do have to wait!<br /><br />Go see this film!  Buy this DVD!<br /><br />See ya next review!</p></br><a href="../users/A29R4FCO6RFX4K.html">A29R4FCO6RFX4K</a><br/><p>While an obvious improvement over the infamous (and excremental) 1994 version, this take on the story of the FANTASTIC FOUR just isn't all that fantastic. This movie is a suitable summer superhero flick, but after the recent and truly fantastic BATMAN, SPIDER-MAN, and X-MEN offerings, FF comes off as a merely adequate film that would have been more satisfying prior to the year 2000, before the bar had been raised. The action and the top-notch SFX are the film's selling points, and while this affable summer blockbuster dishes of plenty of bangs, it doesn't quite click the way previous MARVEL offerings did. Of course, you should see it on the big screen for the stunning big-scale visuals and kinetic zest, but these days you need to put everything you have on the screen, or they'll just walk out and watch the Adam Sandler movie playing in the next cinema.<br /><br />Each actor brings just enough life into each role and not an ounce more. There's more personality retread than human exposition, and character development is left to a loop of traits. Johnny Storm/The Human Torch is a cocky thrill seeker and impatient daredevil, Ben Grimm/The Thing is grumpy over Johnny's antics and his physical transformation, and Reed Richards/Mr. Fantastic is a hopeless nerd who keeps snuffing the flame between himself and Sue Storm/The Invisible Woman. Together, the Fantastic Four face off against Dr. Victor Von Doom, a power-hungry millionaire with convenient menace. Don't worry about short-term memory loss; the film doesn't miss an opportunity to remind the audience how one-note each character.<br /><br />After a bridge accident that quickly and conveniently escalates in order to give each of the Four a chance to showcase their talents, the plot meanders around with the group dynamic before climaxing in a showdown with Von Doom that once again provides the opportunity for each hero to shine once more. Thankfully, the plot keeps moving, but director Tim Story (BARBERSHOP, TAXI) is a strange choice for helming FF. His lack of experience shows here, and that's the film's biggest flaw. Nevertheless, who cares really? Go see it on a Friday night with a big box of popcorn and some good friends and you'll be guaranteed an entertaining comic book flick. But next time round, should a sequel be green-lit, the script should be put before spectacle.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RKI7RPP5CJMG.html">A2RKI7RPP5CJMG</a><br/><p>I've seen plenty of comic book flicks, and I'm not just talking about the recent ones like the Spiderman films and the latest "Batman Begins."  I've seen all of the old Christopher Reeve "Superman" flicks, the Adam West "Batman" movies, and even some duds like the Dolph Lundgren version of "The Punisher" and both "Swamp Thing" films.  Hopefully that establishes my credit on reviewing "Fantastic Four" and giving it such a high rating.<br /><br />The story is, much like all comic first films in what will inevitably be at least followed by one sequel, an origin story.  Tim Story(Barbershop) handles the direction quite well.  Much like in "Barbershop," Story develops the background of each character with depth and simplicity at the same time.  His comic-timing, especially with Human Torch and Thing, is perfect.  That duo alone is worth watching together.  I read in an issue of "Starlog" that Story was a little nervous about the special effects in this film because he wasn't used to using them.  He was told not to worry about the effects, that would be handled by Kurt Williams and his team of pros.  That fact comes through in this film, because the characters are developed perfectly and the special effects, while brilliant, honestly take a step back from the story.  This film is perhaps more character driven than any other comic flick out there.  You really get a sense of family between the characters on the screen.<br /><br />All of the actors captured the wonder of each of the heroes(or villain) that they portrayed.  Michael Chiklis might be running around in an orange rock suit for the majority of this film, but you can honestly see how big Thing's heart really is.  He could have smashed anything in his path, but instead, we learn he cares more for others than himself.  His struggle to become Ben Grimm again throughout the film is played out perfectly.  Jessica Alba does a wonderful job as Sue Storm/Invisible Woman.  Much like in the comic, she tries very hard to keep the boys from killing each other, all the while managing to blend into the background.  Thing might be made of rock, but Alba's character is the solid foundation for this group of characters.  Her brother, Johnny Storm/Human Torch, is the wild card in this bunch.  He embraces his newfound fame as a superhero, and reacts probably like any normal human being thrown into the situation would.  He loves his popularity, but he, much like Thing, cares deeply for the others in this family of heroes.  Chris Evans handles the role of Torch with youthful abandon, and it bleeds through the screen.  Reed Richards/Mr. Fantastic is portrayed by Ioann Gruffudd.  I don't know much about this guy, other than that he was in the recent "King Arthur."  Other reviewers have said he was too geeky in this role, but guess what folks, Reed Richards is a geek.  Gruffudd has a flawless performance as the leader of the Fantastic Four.  He's goofy, a little bit too enveloped with his work, and even a little unsure of himself at times, but in the end, he really does know the answer to everything.  In other words, Richards is a little bit father-figure, a little bit big brother, and a lot of fun in a geeky, awkward sense of the word.  Julian McMahon plays Dr. Doom, and manages to do it with cold and calculated flair.  Unlike many other bad guys, Doom's voice remains the same before and after he dons his metal mask, which goes to show that this dude was evil even before he became a metal megalomaniac.<br /><br />As stated before, the effects are brilliant.  They enhance the performances of the actors instead of draw your attention away from them.  There is some heavy CGI, but it rarely looks fake.  In fact, only Mr. Fantastic's stretching maneuvers seem to come across a little fake.  Chiklis' bodysuit blends in perfectly with the rest of the effects.  It allows him to show emotion that we weren't able to see in CGI creations like Hulk, and he wasn't fake-looking in his battle sequences like some of the other heroes from the page as of late.<br /><br />Overall, this is actually a very good family film.  There is a little bit of language, but nothing you won't hear at the local Wal-Mart or in the mall.  There is one particularly violent scene involving Dr. Doom and someone who crosses him, but other than that, damage is rather minimal.  There's plenty of comedy, mostly provided by Thing and Human Torch, but Mr. Fantasic's awkwardness is also fun to watch.<br /><br />If you want an excellent, action-packed, comedic, and, most importantly, plot-driven film, "Fantastic Four" is perfect.  It is well deserving of its five stars, and I hope you check it out.</p></br><a href="../users/A2P49WD75WHAG5.html">A2P49WD75WHAG5</a><br/><p>As the current wave of digital special effects superhero movies go, the Fantastic Four doesn't match to others in the genre like Spiderman 2, the first X-Men movie, or the recent Batman Begins.  Like the X-Men, the F4 are a team, but what's central to the film is the personality dynamics and clashes that occur between its four members, Reed Richards, Susan Storm, her brother Johnny, and Ben Grimm, whose alter egos are respectively the elastic Mr. Fantastic, the Invisible Girl, who can also generate force field, the Human Torch whose temperature can go up to a supernova, and the Thing.  In the movie, it's the bratty, arrogant, smart-aleck Johnny who comes up with their names.<br /><br />As the film begins, the four are working for Victor Von Doom of Von Doom Industries.  An outer space experiment goes awry as the team and their boss are caught up in a cosmic storm appearing earlier than predicted.  Back on Earth, everything seems fine, until they discover their special powers.  However, for Ben Grimm, who's transformed into the yellow, rocky behemoth, is less than thrilled, as he stays the way he is, coupled by his wife's leaving him.  He is thus the one most eager for Richards to find a cure to their condition, an eagerness than turns to impatience and frustration.<br /><br />Part of that is due to Johnny, who's carefree, insulting, bratty attitude grates on his nerves.  I know-it sure did mine, as I've never seen anyone as obnoxious since Tom Cruise's character in A Few Good Men.  In a scene where the Thing crumples Johnny's expensive red Porsche into a compact ball, I mentally raised a fist in the air.  "Well done, Thing!"  Johnny's the only one for the four who celebrates his condition, and the special effects of him as the Torch are actually laudable.  His flaunting attitude causes trouble for the other members, who want to be discrete so they can be left alone to find a cure, and for Doom, for whom the publicity causes his company's decline.<br /><br />Much of the film focuses on Richards' attempts to reverse their condition, meaning to recreate the cosmic storm in the Baxter building.  However, there's also a subplot involving Reed and Susan, who were exes, but Reed was too focused on his work, so Susan drifted off to Victor, who was more a take-charge kind of guy.  Their predicament unites them together, as they try to sort out why their relationship ended.<br /><br />Given Victor's last name, it's clear as to who he eventually becomes, but he too is affected by the aftereffects of the storm, and he turns darker as his stockholders decide to jump ships following the catastrophe.<br /><br />There is a feeling that too much was being attempted in F4, the romantic subplot, scientific experiment subplot, conflicts within the members, which I found the most interesting thing in the movie, and later with Doom, and the two major action sequences.  But at least the Thing's clich&eacute;d line "It's clobbering time" is used only once.  The ones to watch are Michael Chiklis (Ben Grimm/the Thing), Jessica Alba (Susan Storm/Invisible Girl) for obvious reasons, and despite what I said before, Chris Evans (Johnny Storm), with Julian McMahon (Victor von Doom) being a pale corporate head turned villain.<br /><br />At least it's better than Daredevil, and hey, in terms of action movies, I've seen worse.</p></br><a href="../users/AD7IBJCYSJ9EE.html">AD7IBJCYSJ9EE</a><br/><p>Today I saw this with my two little cousins. I have to admit, I liked it.<br /><br /> The story is pretty simple. Five people get superpowers after being exposed to a space storm. One of them becomes the evil Dr. Doom. The become the FANTASTIC FOUR!<br /><br /> I enjoyed this flick. I hope there is a sequel. Filled with fine special effects, cool action, and some humor, FF is a must see summer movie. My favorite has to be the Thing. Don't listen to the "offical" Ebert and Roeper reviews "Fantastic Four isn't so fantastic! Hardy-har!" Screw 'em.<br /><br /> UPDATE: So far, you guys don't seem to like my review. Just because my review is short, doesn't me you have to hate it.</p></br><a href="../users/AIRHRV3D8X4J1.html">AIRHRV3D8X4J1</a><br/><p>I saw Fantastic Four this weekend and I thought it was much better than what some reviewers and critics made it out to be. If your looking for a movie as as good as Spider-Man or even Batman Begins then you will probably not like this movie. Now if your looking for a movie with action and a sense of humor (think Blade Trinity/Ryan Reynolds) then you will probably enjoy the Fantastic Four. Chris Evans who plays Johnny Storm brings some great laughs to this movie. The movie was entertaining and did far better than what anyone expected it to do by being the #1 movie in America opening with 56 million dollars and finally ending a 19 week slump in Hollywood. Fantastic Four is not a great movie but for any marvel comic book fan this is one worth watching.</p></br><a href="../users/ALWB64XOXNMDP.html">ALWB64XOXNMDP</a><br/><p>Rodger Ebert was wrong..if you read his review he didn't believe this was a film was impressive.  It may not be a critical success. However it does capture the characters. Especially the Thing.  He was my favorite! Without him the movie would'nt have worked. His character was pivotal and was the turning point of the movie.<br /><br />Although the director took some creative licence to change Dr. Doom, it was a crowd pleaser.  The kids and parents in the audience were cheering the Thing and the group as they were battling with Dr. Doom.<br /><br />I have to say that a lot of the bad press this movie has on the web is wrong.  It's not a dark Batman type of super hero movie! It's one of those films that you can take your family to without having to do a lot of explaining to your children.  I only hope that the sequel can be made with the Silver Surfer and Galactus.<br /><br />...if done right...the Surfer and Galactus would be a landmark film with acting and CGI.  Let's hope for FF 2!</p></br><a href="../users/A3DY46ZABF4CMQ.html">A3DY46ZABF4CMQ</a><br/><p>The Fantastic Four is yet another Marvel Comics superhero story brought to the big screen.<br /><br />The four: Mr. Fantastic, The Thing, The Invisible Girl, and Human Torch, cause awe and wonder in the city of New York as they struggle to fight Doom and prevent him from taking over all the power of the world. It's cliched entertainment only past superheroes such as Superman, Batman, and Spiderman used the cliches to make up unique characters that inspired the audience, not bored them to death.<br /><br />The Fantastic Four are four scientists who, after facing an enormous flow of radiation, gain special powers: turning into a ball of fire, going invisible, extending limbs, and becoming a safeguarded body of heavy rock. The film focuses on the scientists trying to return to their normal selves, especially The Thing, whose wife literally divorces him because of his new condition, and suffers social isolation, instead of focusing on the foursome saving the world and fascinating us, the viewers, with demonstrations of their super abilities. Then there's the nemesis Doom, a scientist who was also exposed to the same radiation, whose power is to suck up energy and turn to solid metal.<br /><br />Don't be fooled by the events as I mention them, The Fantastic Four is a silly movie. The plot and the subplots are not coordinated correctly. The Thing's wife never returns to him and there's not a care of trying to win her back either, and the entire love story between The Invisible Girl and Mr. Fantastic is pointless. The humor in the film is mainly from The Thing crushing everything he holds including a glass, a car, and a fork.<br /><br />The Fantastic Four is not all that fantastic after all.<br /><br />Not really recommended<br /><br />C-</p></br><a href="../users/A2LR4NR0G8KO7C.html">A2LR4NR0G8KO7C</a><br/><p>This film is a missed chance really. It could have been a cool production like the new Spiderman movies, but it ended up being a movie that cannot decide between comic and real drama. In addition to that there are some very strange facts. A beautiful blonde being a brilliant doctor..a reckless kid being an official space pilot...Sue being Doom's girlfriend with no passion of whatsoever on the surface..Dr.Doom is not nearly as impressive as the one from the Marvel cartoons. The special effects however are okay.(SARR)</p></br><a href="../users/A2D9IEFJGB483Q.html">A2D9IEFJGB483Q</a><br/><p>This film is not a betrayal, but it is a half betrayal.  You can excuse the ham-handed politically correct insertions.  You can semi-forgive the retconning of Dr. Doom as Ultimate Doom.  Moreover, the scriptwriters made him another run-of-the Hollywood-Script-Mill evil businessman (OsCorp, LexCorp, now DoomCorp), instead of the satanic genius and materialist magician that C. S. Lewis Spoke about (Screwtape Letters).  And you almost cannot forgive the lack of the over-the-top action and suspense that makes a movie worth seeing.<br /><br />This films main problem is that the plot is one of destruction, specifically the self-destruction of the Fantastic Four.  We spend 106 minutes watching the Fantastic For try and figure out a way to undo the miracle that gave them powers.<br /><br />Essentially, this is a snuff film-the FF want to commit suicide!<br /><br />As Campbell points out, each hero goes through a "Refusal of the Call," and eventually snaps out of it and follows through with the quest.  The FF spend the entire film refusing the Call, and finally cross the threshold in the last 15 minutes.  This worked for Unbreakable, but the film is more psychological, serous, and minimalist.<br /><br />We expect Ben Grimm (marvelously played by Chiklis) to refuse the call, since he is so hideous, and Johnny Storm is the only one who finds the powers empowering, but he is such an airhead, it is meaningless.  Reed and Sue mainly focus on their relationship, and odd posing for the camera.<br /><br />What makes Ben Grimm so likeable is that he is the only one who comes to really comes to terms with his powers, and fully accepts the calling as a hero.<br /><br />So how to improve for FF2? First, get in touch with Dooms' Satanic side. Have him undergo some jackball Latvarian-Transylvanian rite that restores him to life.<br /><br />Second-the heroes have come to terms with their powers.  Now explore their powers.  The Thing and Alicia Masters need to be taken to the next level; Johnny should get fed up with being  a flaming gigolo, and begin with Reed and Sue's wedding.<br /><br />Keep the lighthearted humor (the plastic surgeon joke was classic), and the inside jokes (Franklin Richards is Reed's firstborn).  You have thirty years of FF material, take a poll form the fans.  Hmmm . . .how about Galactus?</p></br><a href="../users/A29TKSIWA3JKF3.html">A29TKSIWA3JKF3</a><br/><p>An uninspired, unimpressive start to a short-lived franchise.<br />It took just a few minutes into the movie for it to become evident why this was such a major fizzle.  The dialog is corny, delivered by people trying too hard or not hard enough to be hip and funny.  It didn't help that the characters/actors were either extremely obnoxious (Chris Evans) or deadly dull (Ioan Gruffudd).  The relationships were dubious at best (did they hate each other on sight or because of some mysterious history or did they just love to bicker?).  The special effects are hohum, seen them all before.  The story was all about establishing the characters and if, like myself, you didn't like the characters/actors, what was there left to watch?<br />And as for that lame GQ villain!  He couldn't even muster up a credible snarl.  As villains go he was all costume.<br />I was left with acute disappointment, wondering why I bought the darn DVD in the first place.<br />Now, 6 years after my initial viewing, rewatching it again, everything I thought about it in the first place still held true.  It didn't age well at all.</p></br><a href="../users/A1C58YXM2A30CY.html">A1C58YXM2A30CY</a><br/><p>I got to see this film again as a rerun on cable, and must say it holds the same charm for me as it did at it's opening.  Reed Richards is a science geek and a dork and Victor is a wise guy who thinks he owns the world, both out to get the love of Sue Storm (played deliciously by Jessica Alba).<br /><br />With origin stories in comics there is a pretty fast few pages and panels that explain what's going on and it's done.  For a movie though they need to flesh out the characters which I feel they did here.<br /><br />The space scene where Ben is outside and about to get fried and Victor wants to keep him out there shows who we're dealing with in Victor.  All five get powers from the storm (a deviation from the original comics story but that's fine).<br /><br />The action scenes include fights with Von Doom and a lot of falling, water, fire and even guided missles in the works.<br /><br />What works for me in this film are the character development, including the tension of relationships not only between themselves but between themselves and the media.  The media and fans and fads are put into a pretty bright spotlight here.  Not only a comic book  movie but one that relates a message about people as social beings.<br /><br />Not your usual shoot-em-up sci-fi film.<br /><br />"Silver Surfer" was in a lot of ways the better film but we needed Fantastic Four to lay the groundwork.  Hopefully there will be a third film soon.  Great cast.  I especially liked how they handled the blind Alicia (the Thing's girlfriend).<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VI70QS">Fantastic Four - Rise of the Silver Surfer</a></p></br><a href="../users/A3USRUCHAOC3MT.html">A3USRUCHAOC3MT</a><br/><p>Let me start with a brief review of the movie before I give my personal thoughts.  I realize those thoughts may or may not be helpful as far as reviewing this project, and if they aren't, they then aren't meant for you.  They're meant for those who are interested in what I'm thinking.<br /><br />If you like comic book movies with plenty of action and some thought (not unlike the X-Men series, though not as deep), you will enjoy this movie as I did.  It may lack in plot originality, but it makes up for that with enjoyable and likable protagonists.<br /><br />This movie is one that lives and dies with heroes you enjoy rooting for, a villain (or more) who you love to detest, and special effects that help you believe the unbelievable.  This movie succeeds on all three counts.  Ioan Gruffudd and Jessica Alba are engaging in their roles, and Chris Evans' Tiggerish Johnny Storm plays great with Michael Chiklis as The Thing a.k.a. Eeyore.  Julian McMahon is chilling as Doctor Doom.  (I think it helps that the actors are not household names.)  And the special effects are fantastic, fantastic, fantastic, and fantastic (note my little attempt at humor here?).<br /><br />Kerry Washington's casting as Alicia Masters is ingenious.  True, she does not resemble the comic book character physically, but neither do the rest of the cast (e.g. the original Johnny Storm is blonde, unlike Evans; the original Ben Grimm has hair, unlike Chiklis).  Having a black Alicia dating a white (okay, orange) Ben Grimm/Thing points out that what matters is not appearance but what is inside the person.<br /><br />Finally, what about the kiddos?  I didn't notice any bad language (which the latter X-Men movies slipped into), and the violence was comic bookish.  There was no sex, though they managed to show some of Jessica Alba's skin in a couple of scenes.  As I say with all movies and TV shows, parents need to accompany their children if seeing this, but I think children past the age of, let's say seven, can handle this with parental presence and feedback.<br /><br />This concludes my review of the movie per se.  Allow me to give some thoughts.  If you want to vote on whether this is helpful, please base it on the above, not on the below.  Also, if you don't want to spoil the movie, please stop reading the review at this point, because I will be spoiling some of the story from this point on.<br /><br />As stated, this movie lacks some originality.  It may be that it borrowed from other sources, or it could be that the similarities between other movies are unintentional.  One example is the similarity between the villainization of Victor Von Doom here and Norman Osborn in the Spiderman movie (though from what I know, the Fantastic Four is more original, without borrowing from the comic books for the climax as Spiderman did).  Also, for those who can remember 24 years back to Superman II, the humanization and back of Ben Grimm may remind you of Superman becoming human and regaining his powers.  Other movie similarities include the pigeon leaving his mark on Ben Grimm and the dog leaving his mark on Dan Ackroyd's Winthrop in "Trading Places" or Johnny Storm taking out the heatseeking missles with similar strategies in "X2" and "Blue Thunder".  This may be laziness and quasi-plagarism (though to plagarize from many sources can also be called research), or this may be either an unconscious copying or thinking of something not knowing it's been done before.<br /><br />It's obvious there will be a sequel -- in fact, I saw the preview today on a program I taped earlier this week.  I was trying to guess which villain would be next, or if they would bring back Doom.  My guesses of possible new villains were the Puppet Master, the Sub-Mariner, the Frightful Four (introducing the Inhumans, including Johnny's girlfriend Crystal) and the shape changing Skrull.  I forgot all about Galactacus and the Silver Surfer.<br /><br />Let me now move to lessons learned from this movie.  This movie focuses on related subjects of teamwork and friendship.  Also, as a preacher, I can see the devilish side of Dr. Doom.  I'm speaking specifically of how he deceives Ben Grimm and makes a rift between him and Reed Richards.  The devil does the same thing to divide Christians, for the purpose of achieving his goal, which includes the destruction of the individual Christian, easier to do when they are isolated from their fellow believers.</p></br><a href="../users/A1O60Q7LBN4MQ.html">A1O60Q7LBN4MQ</a><br/><p>I wonder how can a movie with The Shield star Michael Chiklis and Nip/Tuck star Julian McMahon be so dull. The Fantastic Four was my favorite superhero comic book when I was a kid. In fact, it was the only one I would buy. Like most girls, I preferred the Archie books. There was one fun scene where The Thing tries to help someone who was going to commit suicide. All the superheros joined in to help and the world got to see their superpowers. But in general, it was unexciting. It should have been so much better.</p></br><a href="../users/A16QODENBJVUI1.html">A16QODENBJVUI1</a><br/><p>OK, it is kinda odd to give a movie two-stars and then state that it wasn't as bad as anticipated, but that is the case here.  Friends on the online TV/movie board I post on had universally panned this as one of the worst movies ever and the critics were equally unkind when it came out.  So, I was expecting something utterly awful.  I only decided to see it after finishing rewatching both seasons of DARK ANGEL for a project I'm involved in and wanting to see how Jessica Alba of last summer compares to the Jessica Alba of four years ago.<br /><br />The basic problem is that nothing much really happens.  If a super hero movie involving not one but four super heroes and one super villain isn't an action film, I don't know what is.  But the truth is, this is a pretty boring movie.  Much of the story feels rushed, especially the first fifteen, where the leads are all rushed unceremoniously into space to meet the radiation wave that will transform them all into genetically altered creatures.  All of this happens way too quickly and we don't get any real feel for the way their individual transformations affect them.  A lot of the problem is that the run time is just over a hundred minutes, which is simply too little time to stretch out the narrative properly.  I can understand why they didn't properly introduce us to the characters and develop the story about how they became the Fantastic Four:  they wanted to keep the film short enough to guarantee more showings per day per screen in order to maximize profit.  The film needed at least another forty minutes or so, but that would have meant eliminating one or two showings per day.<br /><br />On various fan boards the remake that is supposed to start filming later this summer is receiving some serious criticism, but I think there is actually a chance that a sequel could be much better than the original.  The group is set up and there is actually a chance now of focusing on a story.  The question is whether they have a decent script.  The Spiderman films, especially the second one, have shown what a good script can mean to a super hero movie.  But Sam Raimi has grasped something that few others working in the genre has:  not special effects but the story is the main thing.  Raimi went out of his way to recruit novelist Michael Chabon (author of THE AMAZING ADVENTURES OF KAVALIER AND CLAY, a novel about two comic book writers in the early forties, which won Chabon a Pulitzer Prize) to write the stories for the second and third movies.  Has a similarly strong story been written for the Fantastic Four sequel?  One can hope, but Mark Frost, who wrote the script for this one--and the script was the biggest problem with this film--is writing the sequel.  Frost does not have a good track record.  His lone claim to fame was being co-creator of TWIN PEAKS, but one suspects that the brilliance of that show had more to do with David Lynch than Frost.<br /><br />In an obvious cost-saving move the producers went with TV actors, who usually command far smaller salaries than established film actors.  I love Jessica Alba, who is not only one of the most perfect looking human beings on planet earth, but who seems to be a genuinely nice person, but she isn't the most capable actress in the world.  I am hoping with her winning personality that she can craft a nice movie career.  On a completely superficial level I'd love to see her go back to her natural hair color.  She actually looks better with very dark hair.  She just looks . . . well, odd, with light hair.  It doesn't fit her skin tone or her huge dark eyes.  On a nonsuperficial level, I think she was an asset to the film and since she has enjoyed a surprising amount of success post-FANTASTIC FOUR she is actually the major star in the film.  Still, when she was signed she had almost no film work behind her and was known almost exclusively for having starred in DARK ANGEL and for being one of the world's most beautiful human beings.  Michael Chiklis has established a reputation for being one of the finest actors in television, but has yet to achieve any kind of success in film.  Still, like Alba his price was low compared to others.  Chris Evans was and is an unknown, while Ioan Gruffudd is known primarily for playing Horatio Hornblower on TV.  Julian McMahon, of course, is another television actor, playing the morally challenged plastic surgeon on NIP/TUCK.  My point is that the producers did a great deal to minimize expenses on the film, both keeping salaries low and keeping per day screenings high.<br /><br />There were, of course, a vast number of special effects in the movie, but we are way past the point where special effects can carry a film.  Special effects are only (no pun intended) effective when in the service of the story; a story cannot be used as a clothesline upon which you string special effects.<br /><br />Still, I never found the film impossible or painful to watch.  Mainly I just found myself waiting for the moving to start even as it was coming to an end.  Hopefully they will learn from their mistakes and strive to come up with an interesting story for the sequel.</p></br><a href="../users/AUHG8KSHI529U.html">AUHG8KSHI529U</a><br/><p>Ah, comic book movies always have a hard time of it.  How do you strike the balance of nostalgia for the older audience and still update the story enough to involve the young people.  Another aspect is deciding whether you want the film to feel to the older audience the way it felt to them as a kid (so you would have to step up the intensity of the story quite a bit) or do you recreate the story as it was (to put on film the stories we loved as kids).  Well, this movie tries to have it all ways and ends up a bit confusing.  It updates the story of how the Fantastic Four came to be and their emotional struggles, but keeps the struggle with Dr. Doom much like the way it was done decades ago; lots of flying around, banging around, but not much real threat or damage except to property.<br /><br />Still, I am glad to have seen the story and hope they do another, better, edition of this group.  Each of the actors is good for his or her role, including and especially Alicia (Kerry Washington) for Ben Grimm.  She can be developed and integrated into the story much more than she was in this film.<br /><br />BUT, please, stop with the comic book stupidities like the Human Torch risking igniting the atmosphere because he went to 4,000 degrees Kelvin (which is only 6,740 degrees Farenheit).  Nuclear reactions are magnitudes hotter and controllable.  Puh-leeze.  And calling that temperature Super Nova is dumber than dumb.  A Super Nova is an exploding star, not a temperature.  There are many more stupid statements in the film, which is something like the comic book, but can't we upgrade it a bit above the ridiculous?<br /><br />This makes for an ok entertainment, but nothing terribly memorable or moving.</p></br><a href="../users/A2JYIDH7JIG48H.html">A2JYIDH7JIG48H</a><br/><p>Good story, good special effects, interesting characters, and plenty of humor.  Not quite as good as Spiderman - I think the emotional intensity & character sympathy is a bit diluted from spreading it out among more characters - but it gives the X-Men a run for their money.  Batman Begins is somewhat more serious, maybe a better movie in some serious ways, but Fantastic Four is, overall, probably the most fun movie out currently.  They give the origin so you can understand and enjoy the film just as well if you've never read the comic.  The Four are exposed to DNA altering radiation in space, and each exhibits different symptoms manifested as superpowers.  Ben, The Thing, is super strong and tough, appearing as though he's made of rock.  Johnny (Torch) can start fire at will and turn himself into a blazing, flying fireball.  Reed (Stretch) can stretch his body like tough, flexible rubber to indefinite proportions.  Sue, the Invisible Girl, is the invisible girl.  Unfortunately a fifth was exposed, becoming supervillain Doc Doom.  The Thing wants to be changed back to Ben, but Torch wants to exploit their new abilities for fame and fortune.  Reed works to reverse the process, but Von Doom starts interfering for his own motives.  Recommended for the whole family.</p></br><a href="../users/AB0GGIQBNB36Q.html">AB0GGIQBNB36Q</a><br/><p>I've read the fantastic four comics, and to all the negative reviews I say this. What more did you want, Chris evans was spot on as the Human torch, Micheal Chiklis as the thing. The man they got for Mr. Fantastic was spot on, maybe someone different for the invisible woman. But other than that, I'm sorry, you can't get any better than what this movie did, showing them get hit by the cosmic rays in space, this rendition of Dr. Doom is the best I've seen period. What I particularly like about this movie, is that it's not ashamed of being a comic book movie. I've seen people who have said it's not faithful, how so, I guess they enjoyed the movie that came out in the 90's. Oh that's right, Marvel never released it because it was so bad, until a couple of years ago. It's a fun movie, the interplay between Ben grimm, and Johny Storm is spot on. I highly recommend this movie. It is the fantastic four.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZB8B7VQONZA6.html">A2ZB8B7VQONZA6</a><br/><p>FANTASTIC 4<br /><br />When this film first came out there was a lot of high hopes for the film, and why not it is one of the most beloved comics of all time. There has been a lot said about this movie some being positive some negative, I think for the most part that both sides are right. This movie is flawed especially if you are a fan of the comic series but if you a casual viewer I see no reason why you would not like this film. I have been a fan of Marvel Comics since I was a little kid, and while this series was not my favorite I still read it. That is why I have mixed feelings about this movie, on one hand I am upset with how it turned out while on the other I enjoyed it.<br /><br />The story is all about five unlucky people who take a little trip into space to conduct an experiment, of course since this film is based on a comic you know that something goes wrong. After being hit with all kinds of nasty stuff [cosmic rays] the team wakes up a little later back on earth and everything seems fine, at first. But after a while Reed Richards starts to feel a little stretched, Suzanne Storm feels a little invisible, Johnny Storm begins to feel a little hot, Victor Von Doom feels electrified, and poor Ben Grimm feels a little solid. Of course all of you know what I am talking about with each character; four become fantastic while Doom becomes just that, doomed. It is these events that start to set in motion what should be one of the greatest show downs of all time, more on that later. Reluctantly Mr. Fantastic, Invisible Woman, Human Torch [not so reluctantly] and of course very reluctantly The Thing except who they have become and join up to become the Fantastic Four. That is really what the movie is all about, all of them coming to terms with what they have become. Torch and Doom are really the only ones that like what has happened to them, strangely for similar reasons.<br /><br />A lot of the fans of the comic have spoken out about this movie saying a whole lot of different things, different reasons why they dislike this movie. One reason and justly so is the fact that the film is not really true to the comic all that much, such as the character story lines like Doom was never with Sue that I can remember. Also weren't Reed and Doom friends in college and became enemies once an experiment went wrong and messed up Victor. There are also some other points to be made about storylines and such but you get the idea of what I am trying to say. Something else that is discussed a lot is the casting of the film, from what I can tell most people disagree with most of it. Ioan Gruffudd is cast as Reed Richards aka Mr. Fantastic and a lot of people disagree with this casting decision. It is true that Reed was a genius that was full of confidence and never really self doubting like he is in this film, that is true I can't really argue that point. Also Jessica Alba as Sue Storm aka Invisible Woman has had a lot of critics about her being cast in that role, once again rightful criticism since Sue was never that prissy and stuck up and love sick. Chris Evans as Johnny Storm aka Human Torch has had mixed reactions, people say that Torch was never that cocky but I disagree. He may not have been that cocky originally but I do remember this Torch from his guest appearances in the Spiderman comics, maybe not that cocky but pretty close and has far as entertainment purposes I think they went the right way. Michael Chiklis is really the only one that has had the most praise as Ben Grimm aka The Thing, and rightfully so as he portrays his character perfectly and fulfils a childhood dream by being in this film as The Thing. And of course our villain is played by Julian McMahon as Victor Von Doom aka Dr. Doom, he has been plagued with criticism as well but I liked him as Doom.<br /><br />I really believe that all of the actors did great jobs for what they were given, I mean think about it they portrayed characters that were written for them and acted as directed. If there ever was any one to blame it would be director Tim Story and writers Mark Frost and Michael France. They seem to have wanted to make this film more about the characters and drama between them more important then a film about the action. I can understand that decision but they could have balanced both much better just look at the Spiderman films. Also people complain about how they changed the origins and story around, but like Stan Lee said the big screen is much different from the pages, and some times the film needs to be made different to reach a new audience. As a fan I can both understand this and except it but at the same time be upset by it. Still I don't like that the final battle between the Four and Doom is way to short and not as epic as it could have been. Still though Tim and the writers obviously had a certain vision they wanted to go with for the film and they followed through with it. And what you get is what you get take it or leave, am I overly excited by the finished product, no. But I do think that the film is worth a watch, maybe even a purchase.<br /><br />All the actors did great jobs with what they had written for them, Chris Evans really did a good job adding to his character. His fights with Michael Chiklis  are great entertainment and remind me of the comics, and I think Doom looked cool and Julian McMahon did a great job regardless of whether his character was written for the screen right. Michael Chiklis steals the show in my eyes; his portrayal is great and really heartfelt, that is how I would react if I was turned into that and lost my wife. Ioan Gruffudd is in the same vein as Julian McMahon in that he does a great job with a character that was not written right; same can be said for Alba who does a good job with her character [she is also super hot, really a beautiful woman]. The only thing is that she at times like in the action scenes kinda looks out of place, but that suit fits so right on her so I'll forgive that [sorry but that is the guy in me coming out].<br /><br />Tim, Mark, and Michael although they did not really stick to what the comic was did an ok job with this new version of the team. Sure I would prefer it a different way but the finished product is still kind of a fun movie, perfect for a lazy Saturday or something. Maybe it is because I am a fan of Marvel [Stan Lee cameos] and that they Ok'd it makes me forgive its short comings, or maybe it is just mindless fun that I think this film is ok. This film will never be my favorite movie or even favorite super hero movie but still it is not unwatchable. Whether you hate this film or not as a fan you should still support what you grew up loving, this is not a film just for the people who came to love the comics. This film at least what I think they were going for is a film that has enough of the old to please the old fans and enough new to reach a new audience. I think it worked kinda because the film made money, and as long as these films make money the more we will get to see them. Even if they are not done correctly I would still rather see these characters being created for new generations, which is really the only way the characters will live on.<br /><br />The DVD comes with a nice cast commentary with Chiklis, Gruffudd, and Alba; also included are a lot of great behind the scenes extras including a great documentary. Also on a side note, I actually like the first movie from the 90's that was produced by Roger Corman. I wish that would get a real release on DVD or something, the bootleg quality is not to great.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />With terrible acting (exception: Michael Chiklis), terrible special effects, annoying character interaction and a paint-by-numbers plot, Fantastic Four has precious little to recommend it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FRKEXDXDN1KI.html">A2FRKEXDXDN1KI</a><br/><p>I'm actually a humongous fan of Marvel Comics Fantastic Four.  From owning a large collection of the comic books to toy hunting for the hard-to-get Invisible Woman action figures.<br /><br />  But I kept myself away from any coverage, hype regarding the film, so I can enjoy it to the nth degree.<br /><br />  I have to admit that I felt a bit cautious because although the Fantastic Four have been a staple of Marvel Comics history, it's not the in your face action such as X-Men and even Spider-Man.<br />  It's one of those series that has to grow on you and you learn to enjoy the characters.<br /><br />  So,  I imagined that like the first X-Men movie where they had to go through an introduction, the same would have to be done with the first Fantastic Four movie.<br /><br />  Sure, there will be a lot of action but at the same time, you need to know how the characters are.<br /><br />  Reed Richards (Mr. Fantastic) is not your typical lead man.  He's highly intelligent, detached from society somewhat and can be a cold fish.<br /><br />  Johnny Storm (Human Torch) is the hothead.  Playboy and always seems to get himself into something dangerous.<br /><br />  Ben Grimm, the man who deals with being the rocky behemoth known as the Thing.<br />  And Sue Storm, the woman who loves Reed but somehow tries to find ways to get close to him (despite him being a cold and dull fish at times).<br /><br />  So, needless to say...our heroes have their problems and for some who are looking for the charismatic action hero, they are superheroes but they aren't perfect.<br /><br />  I happened to enjoy the film.  The pacing was a bit off at times but nevertheless, I enjoyed it and optomistic that the second movie can now be fast-paced and hard hitting.<br /><br />  The DVD for Fantastic Four was very enjoyable with really cool.  The DVD is offered in two versions (widescreen and fullscreen) and audio quality is offered in 5.1 DTS (which sounds really awesome on my home theater).<br /><br />  The special features for this DVD doesn't disappoint either as it feature full length audio commentary by the stars of the film, a video diary featuring the stars on their media tour for the film - which was very exciting by the way.  Deleted scenes, making of featurette, casting session, making a scene, music videos, theatrical teaser and trailer and also an inside look for the third X-Men film (which unusually got the top listing for the special features).<br /><br />  Not everyone is going to enjoy the Fantastic Four film.  Even the comic book is not for everyone but those who stick with it learn to enjoy the characters for what they are.<br /><br />  If I had any problem, many of us who are faithful to FF, knows that Dr. Doom doesn't go down that easily.  Otherwise Ioan Gruffudd, Jessica Alba, Chris Evans, Michael Chiklis and Julian McMahon do a great job portraying the characters.<br /><br />  Again, this is just the introductory film.  Hopefully with the second film, things get even better.  As for the DVD, it's fantastic.</p></br><a href="../users/A126KX6FVI4T66.html">A126KX6FVI4T66</a><br/><p>Special effects and cosmic DNA mutations are central to the<br />plot working. Jessica Alba is pretty much the glue for it to work.<br />The casting of the plastic geek and the villain might have been reversed to effect a better movie?<br />Whatever, I like it.

Basing a live-action film on a comic book is something else, though, and the attempt is often winceingly unsuccessful. (The "X-Men" movie was pretty bad, in my view.) This one isn't too bad, mostly because it doesn't take itself too seriously. Ioan Gruffiudd is pretty good as the nerdy Reed Richards and Jessica Alba is okay as Sue Storm. The show is stolen by the other two members of the team, though -- Chris Evans as the smart-mouthed, narcissistic Johnny Storm, and Michael Chiklis as the anguished Ben Grimm, "The Thing." On many levels, of course, it's just another cliched superhero movie, but the writers didn't forgo plot and character development in favor of mindless "action."</p></br><a href="../users/A2CZPM110DW516.html">A2CZPM110DW516</a><br/><p>Comic book movies are difficult enough to produce. Trying to make even one hero with superpowers believable is a challenge, as is creating the necessary special effects, so imagine the task facing the makers of "The Fantastic Four"?<br /><br /> The long awaited big screen debut of the quartet that made Marvel Comics a force to be reckoned with succeeds where other comic book films have failed by being true to its original source. Unlike the "Batman" films, which owe as much to Frank Miller's reinvention of the Caped Crusader in the "Dark Knight" graphic novels as they do to Bob Kane's original creation, "The Fantastic Four" is faithful to the original comic book created by Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby.<br /><br /> With five major characters to deal with (the incredible foursome of the title and the villainous Doctor Doom), the result isn't head-spinningly impressive, but it has a charm that most comic book films lack. The movie doesn't waste time on exposition. It introduces the characters, well played by an excellent cast, and gets on with the show.<br /><br />Brian W.

So if you put aside the negative reviews and watch it in a light and "popcorn" mood you will actually enjoy it.<br /><br />The film is about a team that goes into space to study a unique phenomenon which, in turn, alters their dna and they get special powers.  And the Fantastic Four are born.  Jessica Alba is gorgeous but Flame and Thing/Rock really spice the film up.<br /><br />The film is not really true to the comic book but it does not really matter as it is entertaining provided that you watch it in a relaxed mood.  There are some flows and the romance outcome is predictable but you will enjoy it.Moreover it sets it self up for more sequels and hopefully they will be as good.<br /><br />The blu-ray version is excellent and the special effects come out in a stunning form.  The picture is as sharp as it can be and makes the film even more enjoyable.</p></br><a href="../users/AIFXFHO2N9WJB.html">AIFXFHO2N9WJB</a><br/><p>When the comic book movie craze officially hit with the release of blockbusters such as, "Spiderman", "X-Men", and their hugely successful sequels, many comic book fans were left wondering when will Marvel's first superhero team, the Fantastic 4, make it to the big screen.  Since at the time DC Comics had not released "Batman Begins", Marvel Comics was the only comics' distributor releasing movies, so of course their characters were the primary focus of fans.  Many began to worry with the poor performance (in movie critic's minds, that is) of "Hulk", "Daredevil", and "Elektra", would comic book movies continue to be made or would the superhero genre die out once again.  Luckily, the genre has not died, despite movie critic's most desperate wishes, and in 2005 Marvel's 'First Family of Heroes' were given the big screen treatment they deserved, and audiences were treated to a more tongue-in-cheek comic book movie, that still delivered the goods in terms of storytelling and quality.<br /><br />"Fantastic 4" is essentially the origins for this team of reluctant heroes.  Dr. Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd) and his best friend Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis) are attempting to persuade the extremely rich industrialist, Victor Von Doom, to fund an expedition into space to study a cosmic anomaly that is nearing Earth's orbit.  Von Doom agrees with the proviso that he and his lovely assistant/girlfriend, Susan Storm (Jessica Alba), along with her hot-headed brother Johnny Storm (Chris Evans) are allowed to join them on their voyage into space.  Though the expedition begins pleasantly enough, except for Johnny's practical jokes on Ben, things quickly turn awry as the cosmic anomaly reaches Von Doom's space station sooner than expected and all 5 members of the expedition are bombarded with cosmic rays.  Upon their return to Earth everything appears to be normal, but then everyone begins experiencing changes in their bodies, and new powers developing.  Each member exhibits different powers, Reed has the power of elasticity, Sue gains invisibility, Johnny can control fire, and Ben becomes hard as rock.  These four out of the five member team try to learn more about the source of their new powers and possibly find a cure for them.  Meanwhile, Victor Von Doom, whose skin is slowly becoming a metallic alloy, and also has the ability to shoot electricity from his hands, is becoming increasingly distrubed and blames Reed for causing his current condition.  However, instead of finding a cure, he embraces his anger along with his power and turns on the society that has begun to shun him.  Now Reed, Ben, Sue, and Johnny must decide whether to rid themselves of their powers or join forces to battle their onetime comrade and protect humanity from his evil.<br /><br />Though not nearly as serious as "Spiderman" or "X-Men" or any of the other Marvel Comics' movies for that matter, "Fantastic 4" still gives an engaging story that can be both serious and humorous.  The casting is terrific, all of the actors perfectly embody their comic book counterparts, especially Chris Evans and Michael Chiklis.  These two actors excellently capture the constant bickering/bullying between the Human Torch and the Thing, while at the same time showing their underlying loyalty and willingness to sacrifice for one another if the need arose.  The special effects work is terrific, and it was nice to see the Thing not be computer generated like the Hulk was.  Though critics tore this movie apart and tried to convince the public it was not and could never be a big success, the box office numbers provided by fans and general movie audiences proved otherwise.<br /><br />If you enjoyed "Spiderman" or "X-Men" or any of the other comic book movies, or are just a fan of sci-fi/action movies with good storytelling, then "Fantastic 4" is a movie you should see.  However, do not watch this movie expecting to see the same level of drama as "Spiderman" and "X-Men" had, this movie is much lighter in tone, while still delivering a good story with plenty of drama mixed in.<br /><br />"Fantastic 4" is rated PG-13 for violence, language, and brief sensuality.</p></br><a href="../users/A1Q15TP2FXYYMF.html">A1Q15TP2FXYYMF</a><br/><p>After a succession of dark and/or self-important comic book adaptations, such as batman, sin city, spiderman and the like, fantastic four makes a very refreshing change. It is very bright, lots of colour, and a fun, light-hearted tone, with a plethora of puns and gags which will have you giggling and groaning at the same time.<br /><br />It also makes a refreshing change to see them (eventually) embracing their powers as gifts, and using them and not being shy about remaining anonymous, as most other superheroes will do. This perhaps makes the four seem more human - the public know exactly who they really are. Anyway, this also gives a touch of grounding in realism - guys that looked like that, with powers like that - we'd know all about them surely? It's not like a pair of glasses each would make them Joe (or Josephine) regular, a la Clark Kent (how did Lois buy that for so many years anyway?)<br /><br />But I digress. Ioan Gruffudd manages a competent if rather textbook American accent, and Jessica Alba fulfils her assigned role by being as hot as ever (though why are female scientists always knockouts? They never were in my school!). The stars of the piece though are Michael Chiklis' heartfelt portrayal of the thing, and Julian McMahon camping it up superbly as the villain. Chris Evans (no, not that one!) rounds out the heroic quartet as the arrogant guy who takes full advantage of his fame, cut straight from the template.<br /><br />The special effects are superb (although that comes almost as standard nowadays), and all of our heroes get chance to fully show off their powers, even if some of them have been amplified from the original comics.<br /><br />One criticism of the film is that although running at 1 hour 45 minutes the story was too short in itself, and that most of the film seemed to be all about setting up a series of sequels - as if this was merely the first chapter of the full film. Be that as it may, as a franchise launcher, it has certainly whetted the appetite. A sequel will be eagerly anticipated, and will be expected to improve on its predecessor.</p></br><a href="../users/A140XH16IKR4B0.html">A140XH16IKR4B0</a><br/><p>For once, we are given a comic book adaptation that doesn't ruin the superheroes to make a quick buck.<br /><br />"The Fantastic Four" is smart, funny and has terrific effects. The plot is plausible enough to move the story along. An unlikely group fids itself in space to study a mysterious solar phenomenon and finds itself irradiated and physically altered. The group's scientist becomes elastic. His friend and bodyguard turns into a hideous man of stone. A brother and sister duo respectively become human fireball and invisible. The billionaire who sent them into space is turning into an electro-metallic madman.<br /><br />Sounds farfetched, but the cast keeps the tone light with wisecracks and visual humor. The film also does a nice job of dealing with the group's various reactions to their new powers - embarrassment, wonder, horror and amusement. The effects are terrific. Chris Evans (as human torch Johnny Storm) goes snowboarding with a girlfriend, catches on fire inadvertently, goes careening and melts a tunnel through the snow that he turns into a hot tub for his date. The Thing (Michal Chiklis) alternates between ripping off truck doors (to save a trapped trucker) and apologizing for scaring people. He is the true emotional center of the movie, which is saying something, as he was covered many inches thick in foam and makeup to pay the role.<br /><br />The DVD extras are few, with a handful of deleted scenes showing alternatives to the sentimental denouement between two characters. The images in the widescreen edition were quite distorted, especially in the first few minutes. But I either got used to them or they got better as the movie progressed.<br /><br />TFF is well made and well acted, with just the tight touches of humor, attitude and peril to make it worth watching.</p></br><a href="../users/A27H9DOUGY9FOS.html">A27H9DOUGY9FOS</a><br/><p>Films based on comic books are a bit of a mixed bag.  While never my favorite genre, the stakes have been raised in recent years.  With sophisticated outings such as "Batman Begins", "X-Men 2", and "Spiderman 2" and "Superman Returns", it seems that we've ushered in an age of comic book adaptations as art.  These films surprised me and entertained me (as any movie should), but also utilized real drama, intelligence and adult sensibilities--often with great performances and smart, logical scripts.  Even graphic novels have become a popular source for serious minded films.<br /><br />So "The Fantastic Four" is a throwback.  Far from sophisticated, it plays as a live action cartoon.  That might be OK, but the more pressing problem is that it's not particularly fun either.  I know a lot of people feel that "The Incredibles" borrowed heavily from "The Fantastic Four" concept, and maybe so.  But at least on film "The Incredibles" was rousing entertainment.  Maybe the film "Fantastic Four" should have taken that cue.<br /><br />I won't blame the actors.  I actually like many of them (in other roles).  It's a lackluster, sloppy script.  The filmmakers never really cared about this subject and it shows.  First and foremost, they wanted a commercial film to play to a mass audience--kiddies included.  And I can imagine small children getting a few chuckles from The Human Torch and The Thing.  Their interactions, after all, are the equivalent of junior high taunting.  But it's just not funny enough, the effects aren't original enough, and it sure lacks a brain.  Put the small kids in front of it--it's harmless enough, but you probably don't want to invest your time with "The Fantastic Four".

After Spiderman and Batman Begins and The Hulk and...<br /><br />Not that there's anything wrong with these per se. I thought Batman Begins was a great flick and Spiderman, and especially Spiderman 2, had some great character depth. But it seems like the superhero stories invariably either end up camp and crappy, or they're all about the dark and conflicted side of the hero in question. Fantastic Four had great potential here to fall into the `camp' camp and be truly terrible; not quite as bad as the bad old Batman incarnations, but terminally trivial anyway.<br /><br />In the event it wasn't like that at all. It was light fare, all right, and the conflicts, such as there were, weren't in the same class of `darkness' as those in the other movies mentioned. But somewhere along the line FF accomplished something none of the others did: it was unmitigated fun, without becoming camp. I found myself chuckling and actually genuinely liking it. Something about its unpretentious simplicity was incredibly appealing. The relationships of the characters worked. A lot of it-well, almost all-was utterly predictable, but in this instance that was a nice thing. Maybe that's the word here: `nice'. Of all the comic adaptations this one here's the only one qualifying as `nice'.<br /><br />Does it matter? Maybe not. It did for me. Just sit back and enjoy, and don't ask for anything more than it can give. If you do that, you'll get the best value out of it-and that quite of lot of value in this case.<br /><br />Till Noever, owlglass.com, Author: KEAEN, SELADIENNA, CONTINUITY SLIP.</p></br><a href="../users/ANIMV3SPDD8SH.html">ANIMV3SPDD8SH</a><br/><p>THE FANTASTIC FOUR would be stopped at the door of a superhero cocktail party. It would take all of Superman's effort not to glibly chuckle upon hearing one of them have the ability to elongate his arms to fit into tiny crevices. They seem to be stuck in the era of their creation, 1961, when optimum space and combustible fireballs may have been leading issues in science. It is not so fantastic, indeed a little silly, to watch Mr. Fantastic's deformed rubberized ability, a handy trick should you drop your keys down a sewer drain, but hardly the stuff of jumping tall buildings in a single bound. The comic book superhero movie genre has grown a bit tired, and THE FANTASTIC FOUR does little to elevate it's status, with a cramped visual style, a fault in many comic adaptations, using the tall building metropolis backdrop so often, it looks like it never leaves the same city street. Yet, as a kiddie toy movie, the tongue in cheek here, so firmly planted in a fun time, delivers a quick and enjoyable romp of supporting players in the comic book hall of fame. Ioan Goufudd, as Reed, or Mr. Fantastic is remarkably in tune to the bland dynamics of the leading hero, and Michael Chiklis, as The Thing, a sort of cross between The Incredible Hulk, The Michlin Man, and The Adams Family's Uncle Fester, offers a thoughtful, riotously funny interpretation of the reluctant monster.</p></br><a href="../users/A3SJSNS9LW981O.html">A3SJSNS9LW981O</a><br/><p>Ang Lee's Hulk movie was hated amongst critics as this film is, and they are true opposites!<br /><br />"Hulk" took itself seriously.<br /><br />"Fantastic Four" didn't take itself seriously enough!<br /><br />"Hulk" was heavy handed with it's psychological analysis.<br /><br />"Fantastic Four" was glib with it's psychological analysis.<br /><br />"Hulk" progressed slowly.<br /><br />"Fantastic Four" rushes from scene to scene, at times feeling unglued.<br /><br />But when all is said and done, these are COMIC BOOK movies!

I just saw the DVD last night, expecting the worst (big-time, long-time comic book fan here...) and was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />Not that some of the vitriol directed toward this film has no basis. It does. As much as I love "Nip/Tuck", Julian McMahon has nothing good to do here. I don't like the way they re-imagined Doctor Doom. Actually, I think he would have been great as some regal, European monarch with issues, but all we got was some cliched corporate baddie.<br /><br />Jessica Alba isn't as bad here as say, Sofia Coppola in "Godfather III", and she's sure nice to look at...but in terms of character development, she's given the short end of the stick. Yes she looks hot, but she doesn't "look" like a Sue Storm...<br /><br />Speaking of, Mr. Fantastic is also malformed, pun intended. His character is also not as interesting as it could have been. He needed more chances to be intelligently heroic...to show off the "brain" that Ben Grimm keeps harping about...<br /><br />Enough of the bad mouthing for now...the rest of the film was a blast!<br /><br />Michael Chilis is sublime as The Thing. He's a wonder in that Thing suit. He manages to convey pathos, rage, humor...he's perfect.<br /><br />Chris Evans as the Torch simply rocks. His over-the-top performance served as a nice contrast to the others, and the shenanigans between he and The Thing were right out of the comics. I can understand how he might be irrititating to some viewers, but I kinda think that's the point.<br /><br />Most of the special effects were great as well! I don't know why there's so much venom directed towards the effects. Only the stretching business looks dopey, but the whole Brooklyn Bridge scene is spectacular, the Torch flying is breath-taking and the finale is terrific!<br /><br />The dealing with the public, the coping with the new powers...it was all handled well, with great visuals. Yes, the script isn't as polished or cynical/witty as some may like, but in some cases, simpler is better, and maybe this movie isn't only for us comic geeks...<br /><br />Take a chance on this movie, and I think you're gonna be pleasantly surprised...and if you already think this is going to be a piece of trash, you'll probably be blown away!</p></br><a href="../users/A1V3IO23FZFF9L.html">A1V3IO23FZFF9L</a><br/><p>Fantastic 4 is a fun, entertaining, action filled movie. The cast is pretty bad, especially Alba, who's hard to watch on screen. It's a good movie, but it's no Spiderman.</p></br><a href="../users/A3F3B6HY9RJI04.html">A3F3B6HY9RJI04</a><br/><p>By far, the most impressive thing about the Fantastic Four is the special effects. This is a movie that could not look this good a decade ago. The Fantastic Four has always been placed on hold for being made of a movie because any attempt to make The Thing or Flame would have been laughable. The Flame, I thought, needed a bit more work but The Thing was awesome and totally realistic.<br /><br />The Thing, played by Michael Chiklis, also carried the heart of the movie. You see through his eyes how gaining superpowers isn't always the easiest thing in life. You can easily understand the problems he has adapting to his new abilities as he is chosen to decide living a life being different to help other or living the old life he had before where he was basically like everybody else. His motivations throughout the movie were the easiest to follow.<br /><br />His best friend, Reed Richards (played by Ioan Gruffudd), I wish had more screentime. There were really only a couple of scenes where you saw his new-found power put to work. But the stretching looked realistic whenever he got to do it.<br /><br />The real entertainment of the show came from Johnny Storm (Chris Evans). He was just a real fun and charismatic character to watch on screen and is the only person who really provided any comedy relief.<br /><br />My biggest disappointment in the show was Dr. Doom (Julian McMahon). I just did not get his character. I didn't understand his motivation at all except that he apparently just wanted to do bad things. Why? Well, that is never fully explained. Or explained at all. He just seems upset with some of the things life handed him and decides he needs to start killing people. He gains nothing from it, but insists on doing it anyways. Marvel has done such a great job with the likes of Spiderman and X-Men in showing the motivation of "bad evil doers", I'm surprised to see them make Dr. Doom.<br /><br />I also loved the uniforms of the Fantastic Four. They weren't really that far away from the comic book, except the four on their uniforms was updated (and shrunk a little bit). It gave them a more modern, less baseball jersey look. I was a big fan of the comic but I didn't complain about the costume changes.<br /><br />I found the movie entertaining and well worth watching. I hope a sequel is in the works!<br /><br />The DVD extra features were okay, including the standard couple of deleted scenes and behind the scene look at things. But I was totally fascinated by the brief look at X-Men three coming out next year.</p></br><a href="../users/A27FR2C67JPDRS.html">A27FR2C67JPDRS</a><br/><p>Marvel Comics is on a roll.....Spiderman and the Xmen became big blockbusters (and the Hulk and Daredevil, to a lessor extent) and now the Fantastic Four can be added to their roster of entertaining heroes transferred to film.<br /><br />The film starts with the origin of the four, which moves a little slowly to begin with, but picks up the action as the film progresses.  Once the foursome begin to realize what their powers are, as well as the villain, Dr. Doom, coming to terms with his own powers, the fight between good and evil kicks into gear.<br /><br />Ioan Gruffold does a nice job as Reed Richards (Mr. Fantastic), a scientist who has a better relationship with numbers and his science than with the woman he truely loves, Sue Storm (Invisible Girl).  Sue's cocky brother (Human Torch) and friend Ben Grimm (The Thing) provide a lot of the comic relief for the film.  Of the four, the Human Torch and the Thing seemed to be the best developed.  Hopefully we will see more character development for Reed and Sue in the inevitable sequel.<br /><br />The special effects were really good, especially the Human Torch.  I was afraid the Torch's look, as well as that of Mr. Fantastic's stretchy skin wouldn't translate well to the big screen.  This film, however, made it look good.  Michael Chiklis is probably the standout of the four, becoming the monsterous looking Thing, dealing with his new appearance and the amazing strength he has acquired.<br /><br />Probably the weakest link in the film is Dr. Doom played by Julian McMahon of television's Nip/Tuck.  Once he became Dr. Doom, it would have been nice to have heard a darker, more sinister voice coming from the mask.  Overall, though, I think he did a fair job.  I hope they make him even darker in the next film, should he return as the villain<br /><br />As with any hero story, the first film deals with the origin of its hero or heroes.  With the sequel, the director can start out with action without taking out time to explain the beginnings of the character.  With a little fine tuning, the Fantastic Four will become a very good film franchise for Marvel Comics like Spiderman and X-Men.<br /><br />If you are a fan of the comic books or a good action film, this is movie is for you.  I really enjoyed it and intend to add it to my dvd collection, once it is released.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TEMNM9ZEOLJ6.html">A1TEMNM9ZEOLJ6</a><br/><p>I heard this stank. Having finally watched it, I'd say it's even worse than most critics agreed back when it was released. It's more like a lame comedy than a fantasy film. See it, only if you are a hard-core fan of these comic books brought to life films.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>Now there are so many films based on comic books or graphic novels, and Marvel has been playing important role in this trend, with the varies results.  And another one has arrived.  OK, now I've seen it, and I can tell you there are two good news about the live-action filmed version of 'Fantastic Four'<br /><br />1) The film doesn't take itself seriously.  Though the film starts from the "Episode I" of FF, Mr. Fantastic, Human Torch, The Thing, and Invisible Woman, the film's tone remains very light-hearted, making a good contrast with 'Batman Begins' or to some extent the same Marvel's film 'Daredevil.'  'FF' does not reach the lofty height of 'Batman' rightly knowing that's not where it should go, but it is at least much better than seeing how Halle Berry became Catwoman and received a golden Razzie award personally.<br /><br />In 'Fantastic Four' we see one failed experiment in outer space turn the five people into rubberball, fireball, rock, invisible woman, and iron man, and they worry so much about their changed bodies, but wait a while.  They soon discover what they can do with their newly acquired ability, and then actions start in the good, old fashion, that is, the good vs the evil.<br /><br />The story is weak, and sometimes 'disasters' happen because of our heroes' own carelessness (which undermines the plot), but the characters are interesting, and Ioan Gruffudd, Jessica Alba, Chris Evans, and Michael Chiklis are all good, especially Evans as Johnny Storm.<br /><br />2) Other good news is that the CGI enhansed actions are reasonable if not perfect.  One of the best effects is huge body of Ben Grimm and his craggy skins, which are much more convincing than those of 'Hulk.'  Equally good is the effects of Human Torch, and added humor (mostly goofy kind) is helpful especially when we see these two characters exchanging some dialogues during their frequent squabble.<br /><br />Less successful is the romance part.  It only slows down the story, and Gruffudd and Alba has no chemistry between them that would make us care their love story.  And some CGIs, those of Mr. Fantastic in particular, need better technique for sometimes the live-action background and CGI created hands or legs, of which movement looks often awkward, just don't merge together.<br /><br />Light-hearted 'Fantastic Four,' often silly and goofy, intentionally goes against the grain, the trend of the comic hero with darker side like 'Spider-man' (another Marvel creation).  I am afraid that 'FF' is too light-hearted, but still enjoyable if you don't expect too high standards.  If you need to see better version of film about four characters with superpower and one bad guy, see 'The Incredibles.'</p></br><a href="../users/A3EJYJC25OJVKK.html">A3EJYJC25OJVKK</a><br/><p>Insipid characters, really poor acting, bad script and lack of any good dialogue, "Fantastic Four" is just a joke and the studio once again fails to adapt this comic franchise onto the big screen well.

Um, Jessica Alba was cute. And, um, Jess -- wait, I said that already.<br /><br />The first 3/4 of the movie is mostly nothing. Nothing much happens, then they go to a space station. There's a cosmic storm, and nothing much happens and they go home. Then everyone start turning weird, but nothing much happens. Then there's a big fight and the bad guy loses but he doesn't completely lose so we can have a sequel. The end.<br /><br />Johnny Storm is an insufferable egotist with a forethought horizon measured in milliseconds. Testosterone driven teenaged boys will relate. Sue Storm (Jessica) is the director of bio-something at a billion dollar corporation and fitting mate for gray haired Reed Richards, despite her pouty seventeenish demeanor. Ben Grimm was true to the F4 I remember from years ago, but his lovely romantic interest seemed to be tacked on at the end. Alicia (Kerry Washington) is a charmer though, so I won't complain.<br /><br />It's a silly-season summer flick. If you're a pureblood Marvel fan-boy [-girl], it's a must see movie. If you have a small boy, you'll be dragged to see it.

Who?"<br /><br />Say Batman and everyone nods.<br /><br />The Fantastic Four was the first comic that Marvel Comics produced in the early 1960's. It preceded Spiderman and the XMen. Even so, it has remained largely a comic fan's comic book, considered somewhat unaccessible by the public at large. Why? Well, I have my own thoughts, but I'm sure they're just my own. Suffice it to say, that the Fantastic Four (the comic of which has never been one I've been interested in) film stands up quite well when placed side by side against other comics to films.<br /><br />As with any such film, the absolute intent is for there to be more than one film. Why? Well, you've got to do a lot of suspension of disbelief as well as introduction of characters and their intentions and their psyche. If those aren't incorporated, you end up with a hollow film with no emotional center (remember Batman and Robin?).<br /><br />Marvel and their film production partners have wisely made the decision to ground all their comic films in modern reality. This means New York is New York and not Gotham City - some bizarro world alternate reality. To do so, means that the comic to film characters must become flesh and blood believable. In this film, Marvel has scored.<br /><br />Ioan Gruffudd as Mr. Fantastic is sincere and extremely believable as a man on a mission but who tries to push his own feelings away. Jessica Alba as the Invisible Woman is certainly sexy, but more importantly, Ms. Alba brings a nuanced confidence to the role that it needed. Michal Chiklas as The Thing could not be any finer. Thank heaven technology caught up to comics so that the Thing could be "real" and not CGI, so that Chiklas' acting comes through far more intensely than the costume he wears. Dr. Doom's backstory has been tweeked to make it more accessible and "believable" to the audience. Is it effective? You bet. I keep finding that Marvel's film developments often surpass the "realities" of their comic counterparts, making them more believable and reality based, while maintaining the fantasy aspects so necessary to the stories. And finally, Chris Evans as Johnny Storm, the Human Torch. Wow! This could have really been screwed up. The Human Torch's popularity has surpassed that of the Fantastic Four, garnering him his own series of comics from time to time.  He's a smart alec and a cocky SOB. Initially, I understand, the producers were just going to have the character be able to shoot flames from his hands, thus making him truly a "human torch", but somewhere along the line, they kept the character as in the comics and he is fully "on fire". Evans and Chiklas steal the show with their character portrayals, and the script still lets their humanity come through.<br /><br />As with any introductory film, the script is forced to be overtly heavy in exposition and backstory. However, seeing that this film was a success, doubtless there will be a sequel, which should mean that it will be able to be nothing but a non-stop thrill ride.<br /><br />Even so, while often burdened with too much expostional material, in the long run this film needed it and it suceeds because of it.<br /><br />No, it's certainly not perfect, but I'll not fault the producers too much. The casting was perfect and the special effects were just dynamite. I'm looking forward to the next installment.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L9MIIBI7409N.html">A1L9MIIBI7409N</a><br/><p>I missed the Fantastic Four, aka FF in the theatres and as any self-respecting Marvel comic fan, had to watch the DVD in spite of the mixed reviews I'd heard.<br /><br />The good news is: the movie is watchable.  It's not perfect, and I still rate the X-men and the Incredibles ahead of this.  The effects are well crafted, and much thought has been put into the visual approach.<br /><br />What else is good about this: Great casting of Von Doom (Julian McMahon of Nip/Tuck) and Chris Evans as the Human Torch.  Jessica Alba looks great too.<br /><br />What could have been better:  This entire film was more like an introduction to the Four rather than a complete movie experience.  Sometimes feels like a TV show.  Since a sequel is in the works, we'll just have to wait.<br /><br />Weak Chink for me: Mr Fantastic is pretty average.  And Dr Doom's origins are less compelling than the real comic book Dr Doom.<br /><br />As some reviews say above, the Fantastic Four isn't about characterisations, and yet, one feels that the chemistry of the four could've been tweaked up a notch instead of falling back purely on the comic book landscape / approach of simple characters.  After all, the Fantastic Four became "the world's greatest comic" simply BECAUSE the characterisations were complex and unique, and the characters each had strong identities.  This is ignored a bit in favour of an Irwin Allen "Land of the Giants" TV feel.  Meaning: these are not epic characters on the level of the X-men.<br /><br />Dr Doom's development was somewhat of a disappointment.  While I enjoyed how the new scriptwriters have incorporated him in a more contemporary and intelligent way - I wish that the original character could've been respected.  The mystery and dark foreboding of the original Dr Doom was on a level that inspired characters like Darth Vader.  Doom's comic book legacy deserved better.<br /><br />The Human Torch however, is excellent.  Never my favourite character, he nonetheless comes alive in every way in the film.  Flame on!<br /><br />The DVD itself is chock full of extras which I'm still wading thru.  3.5 stars for the film; 4.5 for the DVD packaging.<br /><br />There's more to come...a pretty good start.</p></br><a href="../users/A3N8RZSXKN1OR2.html">A3N8RZSXKN1OR2</a><br/><p>I was never a fan of the FF comic, so I only know the basic facts about the team, and if I could enjoy this film, so can anyone else who isn't terribly familiar with them.  I found it far better than Daredevil <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000959N0">Daredevil (Full Screen Edition)</a>, definitely equal to X-Men <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AYELVA">X-Men (Widescreen Edition)</a>, and almost as good as Spider-Man <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JKCH">Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)</a>.  Reed Richards, a brilliant scientist but a terrible businessman (and not too good at relationships either), and his lifelong friend and boyhood bodyguard Ben Grimm are in search of funding with which to prove Reed's hypothesis that a long-ago cosmic storm was responsible for the development of humanity.  To do this, they need to get into space, and NASA has refused them.  But billionaire Victor Von Doom, who has his own space station, doesn't--on condition that they sign over to him 75% of all profits and patents resulting from the experiment, let him go along (and take his science-projects director, Sue Storm, who is Reed's former girlfriend), and pick the pilot (Sue's brother Johnny, who washed out of NASA for his hotdogging and prankstering).  (Interestingly, we see on board the station that the Marvel Universe is definitely scientifically ahead of our own: the facility seems to have artificial gravity.)  While Ben is on a spacewalk, the cosmic storm Reed knew was coming speeds up, and everyone gets a whopping dose of radiation before Doom can close the shields.  At first, back on Earth, it seems they've come through unharmed.  Then Johnny, helicopter-skiing with a nurse he's met, literally starts to burst into flames, and Ben undergoes a transformation into a creature only superficially human.  Soon afterward, Reed realizes that he can extend any portion of his body, and Sue that she can turn invisible when under emotional stress.  (Last to transform is Doom, who slowly turns into a being made of some kind of organic metal.)  Reed wants to try to reverse the process, and Ben, who's dismayed by his new form, is happy to let him.  Even Sue is ambivalent about her new power.  Only Johnny seems to understand that there's more to being the self-named Human Torch than being an idol of millions; "What if this happened for a reason?" he insists.  Meanwhile Doom, whose company has tanked from the unfavorable publicity, has resolved to destroy Reed...<br /><br />With typical Marvel angst, wonderful special effects, and an attractive cast, this is definitely one of the best of the recent crop of Marvel-based films.  One of the most visually stunning sequences is a wild multi-car accident on a New York bridge (begun when Ben tries to save a would-be suicide), climaxing with an ovation for the quartet from drivers, cops, and firefighters alike: unlike Spider-Man, the Fantastic-Four-to-be are obviously accepted from the start by officialdom.  (There's also an almost equally splendid battle with Doom in the midst of the New York street.)  Each of the Four is a clearly marked individual of whom the script makes the most that time will allow, and Doom is a wonderfully smooth and sinister presence even before his ultimate villainy comes into play.  Nothing in the movie seems especially frightening, either, so it can be recommended for all ages--and I do.  This is another DVD I intend to add to my collection as soon as I can.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VI2VETB90ZG5.html">A3VI2VETB90ZG5</a><br/><p>How stubborn I am to have thought they couldn't do the Fantastic Four justice on film - I was so wrong.<br /><br />This movie is unbelievably remarkable.

When the X-Men were produced into two great feature films I was very hopeful as to the disposition of the promised Fantastic Four feature.<br /><br />IN A NUTSHELL: A FILM ABOUT COPING WITH CHANGE - STRESS & ESTRANGEMENT<br /><br />The "Fantastic Four" feature film took the 'origins of the fantastic four' as the movie's theme. To this extent the film was competent, but nothing out of the ordinary, when compared to the recent X-Men and Spider Man releases. Nevertheless, this film is entertaining and does make sense, although it is not beneath pandering to young men via Jessica Alba's implicit nudity. It is mostly a film about people facing the stress and the estrangement that comes with major unexpected changes in themselves, and how others see and relate to them. This is most coherently portrayed by Ben Grim/'THE THING' [Michael Chiklis] who brings some much needed humanity to this piece in the form a small measure of a 'beauty and the beast' subplot. In essence, Ben Grim has turned into 'The Thing' and unlike the others he can not turn back - he is stuck in his superhero mode and basically feels apart from everything that was in his world, before the accident in Space. Only a blind woman can see that he is not a monster, and this could have been enlarged within the plot to good effect.<br /><br />THINGS TO MARVEL AT:<br /><br />The scene on the Brooklyn Bridge is easily the most amazing scene in the film. Ben Grim is on center stage as he confronts a would-be jumper as he ponders the same thoughts [jumping off the bridge]. With a little comedy and special effects, Ben Grim stops a huge truck cold, saves the jumper and creates a debacle on the bridge that ends with the recognition of the 'Fantastic 4' as group of superheros as a breaking headline story on the news.<br /><br />- * MAJOR ACTORS - * * Tim Story - Director *<br /><br />Ioan Gruffudd - Reed Richards/Mr. Fantastic<br /><br />Jessica Alba - Susan Storm/The Invisible Girl<br /><br />Chris Evans - Johnny Storm/The Human Torch<br /><br />Michael Chiklis - Ben Grimm/The Thing<br /><br />Julian McMahon - Dr. Victor Von Doom<br /><br />Hamish Linklater - Leonard<br /><br />Kerry Washington - Alicia Masters<br /><br />Laurie Holden - Debbie McIlvane<br /><br />David Parker - Ernie<br /><br />Kevin McNulty - Jimmy O'Hoolihan<br /><br />Maria Menounos - Sexy Nurse<br /><br />ABOUT THE DVD: EXCELLENT WIDESCREEN DIGITAL TRANSFER OF AUDIO & VIDEO<br /><br />** SPECIAL FEATURES ** LOOKS LIKE A LOT MORE THAN IT IS **<br /><br />- Available Subtitles: English, Spanish<br /><br />- Available Audio Tracks: English (DTS 5.1), English (Dolby Digital 5.1), Spanish (Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround)<br /><br />- Commentary by: Jessica Alba, Michael Chiklis, and Ioan Gruffud<br /><br />- 3 deleted scenes<br /><br />- The Fantastic Tour: Exclusive behind-the-scenes home video hosted by the entire cast<br /><br />- Making of Fantastic Four<br /><br />- Fox Movie Channel Presents Casting Session & Making A Scene<br /><br />- Music videos: Everything Burns, Come On Come In, Music<br /><br />Exclusive inside look at X-Men 3 - hosted by producer Avi Arad<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: WORKMANLIKE ADAPTATION OF A TRULY FANTASTIC COMIC SERIES<br /><br />ALSO RECOMMENDED:<br /><br />X2: X-Men United (2003, Bryan Singer)<br /><br />Spider-Man (2002, Sam Raimi)<br /><br />X-Men (2000, Bryan Singer)<br /><br />The Hulk (2003, Ang Lee)<br /><br />Spider-Man 2 (2004, Sam Raimi</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>There are serious SF films then there are entertaining SF films and, as of late, the film industry has seen fit to adapt several comic book SF characters onto the silver screen. Whether or not these are serious or entertaining is often left up to the viewer's discretion. Some have been great (Spiderman) and some not-so-great (Catwoman). Then we have this movie, the FANTASTIC FOUR.<br /><br />Debuting in 1961 (Marvel Comics), the Fantastic Four hit on new ground: a dysfunctional family of sorts who fight amongst themselves as much as they do against the forces of evil. Unable to decide on costumes, they really had none for several episodes. All of them gained their superpowers from exposure to cosmic rays while visiting a space-station.<br /><br />Jump to 2005 and we get the entire dysfunctional dynamic rolled into a 105 minute film; not an easy task. But director Tim Story does an admirable job with writers Mark Frost and Michael France's screenplay. The space-station, the problems with costumes, the infighting, it's all there (thus my postive rating).<br /><br />The beautiful Jessica Alba stars as the sexy, kick-a$$ Sue Storm/The Invisible Woman. Her powers include the ability to manipulate matter and light. Chris Evans (whom I'd personally give top billing) brings to life the role of  Johnny Storm/The Human Torch, Sue's immature younger brother who can spark up any room with his powers and his wit. And Mr. Evans instills some much needed comedy into the flick by playing pranks on the other three as well as having some great dialogue. Ioan Gruffudd bends the silver screen as Reed Richards/Mr. Fantastic, the flexible rubberman who is the defacto leader of the Fantastic Four (and who's also in love with Sue Storm).  Then we have Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis) who's increased mass and stone-like structure have given him incredible strength ...and some problems at home. He's uneffectually called The Thing and his wife leaves him posthaste when she discovers his altered physical structure.<br /><br />The great thing about the film is that it really looks at the issues surrounding being a newly developed superhero and how people might respond to such a thing. For one thing, when Ben Grimm's wife leaves him, she pulls off her wedding ring and Ben/The Thing tries to pick it up but can't because of his bulky hands. It's actually a fairly touching scene and we can feel Ben's frustration. Also there's the lost love between Sue Storm and Reed Richards which is always in the background and causes flare-ups and fights constantly. Then there's Johnny Storm's discovery of his flaming superpowers and his difficulty in controlling them (or lack of wanting to control them). He's a cocky upstart who brings an entirely new dynamic to the group ...which is why I'd give him top billing.<br /><br />The film's faults are easily seen as we're rushed through certain aspects (how they plan to get back to normal using a machine created by Richard) and several convenient plot twists (not uncommon, though, for comic books).<br /><br />This is a fun film. It's not at the level of Spiderman, but it's way, way above Catwoman.</p></br><a href="../users/A1B05INWIDZ74O.html">A1B05INWIDZ74O</a><br/><p>This is much better then the first Fantastic Four movie I saw. But it covers the same period of time.... their origin. In the movie, our four would be heros and Dr. Von Doom head into outer space to study a radiation storm and get caught it in. This storm affects them all at a DNA level and gives them each unique superpowers.<br /><br />The storyline is based on these five characters development and interactions as they transform into their new super selves. And learn to work as a team. Excluding Dr. Doom whose power is only rivaled by his ego. And the graphics for each characters superpower is well done.<br /><br />We do not get to see the great Fantastic Four Team up and fight until the end of the movie. Which may be a big disappointment to most. And may be why so many people gave this movie a low rating. But it does a great job on background and is fun to watch. I am sure we will see the action packed team fight in the second movie, which I know, will be coming out. If you are a Fantastic Four fan, I suggest watching this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2I6MHMAZZDCRX.html">A2I6MHMAZZDCRX</a><br/><p>Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd) has a brilliant idea he wants to test in space involving human DNA and radiation.  To do that, he swallows his pride and turns to his old rival, Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon).  Victor agrees, and soon five people are traveling to a space station, hoping to get their experiment set up before a cosmic storm arrives.<br /><br />Unfortunately, they don't make it, and the five of them are caught in the storm.  At first, there don't appear to be any effects.  But then they begin to change.  First, it's Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis) who becomes a rock creature.  But then Reed discovers he can flex his body into any shape desired.  Siblings Sue and Johnny Storm (Jessica Alba and Chris Evans) also find they have powers.  Sue can turn invisible and create force fields while Johnny can turn his body into fire and use that to fly.<br /><br />Johnny is the only one of the four who is excited about their new found powers.  He wants to use them for good, sure, but also exploit them for profit.  Ben is the most reluctant to embrace their new found powers since he's a giant rock.  Reed tries to find a way to reverse the process while all of them attempt to deal with the powers.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Dr. Doom is also undergoing a change.  But he wants to use his powers to satisfy his own greed and take over the world.  Now, the Fantastic Four will need to accept their powers in order to stop him.<br /><br />I had heard of the Fantastic Four, but didn't know what to expect going into this movie.  The things I did expect were good special effects and lots of action.  I got one of the two.  The special effects were incredible, especially for Johnny Storm aka the Human Torch and Reed as Mr. Fantastic.<br /><br />Instead of being an action movie, this was more a character drama giving the origins and background on the characters.  There were some action scenes, but they were few and far between and mostly came at the end.  Frankly, I left the theater disappointed because it wasn't what I expected.<br /><br />That's not to say that the story wasn't interesting or entertaining.  Four ordinary people suddenly having these powers thrust on them will turn their lives upside down, and I enjoyed how it was handled.  I especially felt sorriest for Ben who had his entire life changed forever by his new form.<br /><br />This movie gives good background on the characters and sets things up for the inevitable sequel.

On the one hand, if I'd listened to them, I'd have watched one less bad movie. But on the other hand, if not, my best friend and I wouldn't have laughed at it's complete stupidity (hence why I give it 2 stars for at least it gave us something to make fun of). It truly was one of the biggest disappointments for me in a while. Sad, because it really looked so good in the previews.

Never having read the comic book, I found the exposition necessary and handled quite effectively, with a great climax and some nice action set pieces beforehand.  While not Oscar worthy performances, the cast filled out their roles nicely:  Ioan Guffold is the analytical Reed; Jessica Alba a sultry Susan Storm; Chris Evans a buff and egocentric Torch; and Emmy winner Michael Chiklis a sympathetic Thing.

Daredevil was a case in point. While a blind guy wearing a cherry red leather outfit might work on the panels of a comic book it looks silly on screen. (Not that this excuses the horrible Daredevil movie mind you) Mr. Fantastic (The stretching guy) of the Fantastic Four suffers this same fate. When he stretches it looks either disgusting (hand squeezing under the crack beneath a door) or quite silly (every other time he stretches.) Not that the character is helped by Ioan Gruffud's somnolent performance. He makes up one third of the most sleep inducing love triangle ever filmed.<br /><br />The lady in question is the Jessica Alba who looks fantastic in and out of her costume (She turns invisible when naked sorry guys. But some dutiful frame by frame DVD action will surprise the patient) but she expresses no emotion about either man (Or for that matter having superpowers. But I guess looking like Jessica Alba is kind of a superpower in itself).<br /><br />The third part is our pseudo villain Dr. Doom. (I say pseudo because he turns villain sometime around the closing credits in the most truncated villain performance in the history of superhero films) Dr. Doom as written for the comics is the perfect screen super villain. Which begs the question why he is barely in this movie and more importantly why he is a metrosexual evil businessman (Forced to be evil because his IPO went down in price and the bank is pulling out? This shows a remarkable lack of knowledge how IPO's work) When Alba tells Gruffud she never slept with Doom we have to believe her. I have a hard time believing these saccharine characters go the bathroom let alone have sex.<br /><br />The other two members of the four (Evans and Chiklis) give competent if one note performances. But by the time all the introductions and back-story is completed the movie is over. With no villain, unimaginative action set pieces and some shaky special effects Fantastic Four is more mediocre than fantastic.

Starring Ioan Gruduff, Jessica Alba, Chris Evans, Julian McMahon and Michael Chikis, this is just another big, loud, special effects-packed movie with a bland story. Even admitting it is a fun movie to watch, I have to say is just as forgettable as a bad hair day. When compared to Pixar's The Incredibles, a truly magnificent movie, I can't help but realize the Fantastic Four turned their characters into a silly cartoon, while The Incredibles did just the opposite.<br /><br />The Four gain their powers during an accident in space. Mr Fantastic, alias Dr Reed Richards, possesses the properties of an infinitely stretchy rubber band. Sue Storm, his ex girlfriend (not for long) is the Invisible Woman, capable of creating field forces. Her brother, Johnny, is the Human Torch, who has with the ability to combust and turn his body into a heat missile without doing himself the slightest bit of damage and Ben Grimm becomes the Thing, a moving rock pile with a gravel voice, a heart of gold and the strength of Hercules, who is also the group's tragic figure, because unlike the others, he cannot turn his powers on and off.<br /><br />The first half of the movie is pure fun scenes, with the Four learning about their powers, Chris Evans tormenting the Thing, and their whiny complaints about their new changes.<br /><br />The director works very well the moments when the fantastic collides with the everyday. But character is incidental. The film's real business lies in bigness. Blowing things up, driving them off roads and bridges, watching them crumble, freeze and burn.<br /><br />The acting is standard, only because the script doesn't give these actors much to do. The only exception is Michael Chiklis as The Thing, who although covered in that afwful rubber suit is the character best exploited, physically and emotionally. And Julian Mc Mahon, who gets to be the evil Dr Doom, very well casted but they could have get much more from him.<br /><br />Conclusion: This is a fun movie but a very shallow one. If you want true superheroes, see the Incredibles.</p></br><a href="../users/AS558SNWF1DXG.html">AS558SNWF1DXG</a><br/><p>It's been a dark summer for big-budget blockbusters.<br /><br />Anakin Skywalker got amputated and incinerated in the latest "Star Wars" installment.<br /><br />Brangelina rediscovered their G-spots by kicking the hell out of each other in "Mr. and Mrs. Smith."<br /><br />The Scarecrow dosed Gotham City with some major bad trips in "Batman Begins."<br /><br />And Martian tripods turned Earthlings into white ash, driftwood or tomato paste in "War of the Worlds."<br /><br />Just as this summer's hits reached their bleakest pitch (and just as Thursday's bombings in London completely trumped the movies on the horror scale), a different kind of popcorn flick emerges.<br /><br />It's big. It's dumb. It's fun. It's "Fantastic Four," an adaptation of the Marvel Comics series about a quartet of humans transformed into superheroes.<br /><br />Scientists Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd) and Sue Storm (Jessica Alba) and pilots Johnny Storm (Chris Evans) and Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis), rocket into space, catch a blast of a cosmic wave and return to Earth with strange new abilities: Reed can stretch his limbs like elastic; Sue can become invisible and project force fields; Johnny can generate and control flames; and Ben is transformed into a hulking, stone-skinned behemoth.<br /><br />Naturally, they have no choice but to use their powers for the greater good.<br /><br />On comic book pages, the Fantastic Four were always heavier "advanced placement" heroes: They were independently wealthy and most of their adventures involved space travel and quantum physics; secure in their fancy high-rise, the Four didn't even bother with secret identities.<br /><br />But director Tim Story, and writers Michael France and Mark Frost, have adapted the saga into something infinitely less serious and enjoyably goofy. Here, the science, and most of the drama, is strictly on the level of "Gilligan's Island," though with a little more irony and funnier jokes.<br /><br />Onscreen, Gruffudd's Reed Richards, for example, is no longer the grim intellect of the comic book but a bankrupt, absent-minded egghead whom another character aptly calls, "the world's dumbest smart guy."<br /><br />The filmmakers focus most of the movie on the Four's attempts to understand and deal with their new powers, with occasional asides as the camera ogles Alba in her skintight supersuit. Gigantic plot holes abound and a big showdown at the end almost feels like an afterthought.<br /><br />But this is one of those movies in which plot holes and bad lines are beside the point, and the movie's giddy tone is set by Evans' Human Torch, a kid who's simply ecstatic to discover he's got superpowers. Though Michael Chiklis, as the deformed Ben Grimm, stands out as the movie's sulking heart.<br /><br />Longtime comic book fans, and viewers who can't relax and go with the flow, may absolutely hate this movie, and honestly I sometimes couldn't tell if I was laughing with it or at it. But considering this is a story that involves rubber-faced heroes, cosmic waves and bad guys with names like "Victor Von Doom," it's probably best spun as a comedy. It just wouldn't play straight.<br /><br />Without a doubt, "Fantastic Four" is the dumbest smart movie of the summer</p></br><a href="../users/A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I.html">A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I</a><br/><p>I was really surprised with how much I really enjoyed this movie. I have been a fan of Marvel comics for many years so I was looking forward to seeing this finally, but I have always heard the mixed reviews. Well, I wasn't disappointed and the Fantastic Four, even though the story was different from the comic, was still very fun to watch.<br /><br />Many jokes were really funny and the characters matched very well to their actors, even thought I think Mr. Fantastic looked like a Jeff Goldblum clone. The story was exciting and kept my attention the entire time. The special effects were excellent, and the costumes were as equally impressive. My only problem with the movie was that the stories weren't the same and I would have prefered if nothing was changed in the story line. By far, this isn't the worst comic book movie to be made, believe me, I have seen some stinkers. Overall, I would really recommend this mvoie to Marvel fans. It isn't terrible, unless you are a hardcore nitpicker who tries to find something wrong with a movie</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>Going into the Fantastic Four movie, I'll admit that I expected something completely abysmal.  However, with so many of the comic to film adaptations trying to be serious and move beyond their source material (i.e. Superman Returns), sometimes it's better to have a comic book movie that doesn't take itself too seriously and just sets out to be something that many films of this type aren't: fun.  And Fantastic Four is certainly mindless fun all the way.  Scientist Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd), his ex-girlfriend Sue Storm (a blonde haired and blue contact lens wearing Jessica Alba), her daredevil brother Johnny (Chris Evans), and Reed's longtime friend Ben Grimm (The Shield's Michael Chiklis) are all transformed into the super powered team, who find their hands full with instant celebrity and their evil, super powered nemesis Victor Von Doom (Nip/Tuck's Julian McMahon).  The CGI effects are in full effect, the action is campy, and the cast is game (Chris Evans is a nice pick as the hotshot Human Torch), while the makeup and costume effects for the Thing are very well done.  It's loaded with leaps in logic and plot points which are laughable, but that's part of the film's appeal, and that's always been part of the comic's sense of appeal as well.  It works to a point, and Fantastic Four is a fun trip as long as you don't take it seriously or expect anything such as the lofty heights set by X2: X-Men United or Spider-Man 2.  Look for Marvel icon Stan Lee in a humerous cameo.</p></br><a href="../users/A32XK1ZCXM66OT.html">A32XK1ZCXM66OT</a><br/><p>Okay, I've been a great fan of the Marvel and DC comics. Now, this movie was not expect to great. Ever since, the day it was announced that Fox was going to produce and release it. There were a lot of critics, who even doubted the movie make it to number one at the box office. But, when Fantastic Four came out. This movie prooved everyone wrong, including myself. The prouducers of the movie picked a truly great cast. The special effects are just super!!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A3GRN6J64F2C3X.html">A3GRN6J64F2C3X</a><br/><p>The pleasant yet undeniably featherweight souffle that was 2005's "Fantastic Four" is now, in this extended cut, a pleasant featherweight souffle with perhaps a tad more richness in the batter.  Fans will likely enjoy the extra bit of heft in the proceedings, but will also probably notice that the extra scenes aren't particularly indispensible or brilliant or make the movie a whole lot better.  They're just interesting and fun to see.<br /><br />Technically, this new cut looks and plays fine.  If seamless branching is employed to add the extra scenes when the extended cut option is selected (both the theatrical cut and the extended cut are offered here), the result is indeed seamless.  I experienced no pauses or other "bumps" when watching the extended cut; it played like a regular movie.  And I hardly have state-of-the-art equipment.<br /><br />But while the new extended cut of the film offers good entertainment value, disc two is the real keeper here.  If the producers annoyed many FF fans by changing a lot of the team's established mythology for the film, it looks like they're trying to win back their love by including extremely generous features about the comic book and its creative forces on the bonus disc.  The extra features are a treasure trove of behind-the-scenes lore about the FF comic book, and alone justify the price of the DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>I read this comic as a kid, so when I went to see this movie in the theater, I expected great things! After the wonderful treatment they did with Spiderman, I thought this has got to be great!...right?... Wrong! Let me start off by saying I did like this movie, but it could have been better. After seeing the film, I went home and dug out an old FF comic and was surprised how close they came to capturing the essence of the comic.<br /><br />Jessica Alba who is great to look is the weakest of the foursome and her chemistry with Reed is not truly believable. The Thing and Torch were spot on, with the exception to the Thing missing his signature rock uni-eyebrow! Mr. Fantastic is played well by Ioan Gruffudd, but I was not too impressed with Doctor Doom's look and story change. I guess, like in the "Spiderman" films, some characters don't translate well into a live action movie(Green Goblin).<br /><br />The extended edition is an improvement even though there are a few awkward scenes added with the same dialogue. The new extras on extended edition make the double dip well worth your money.</p></br><a href="../users/AZCDCO6KK2T81.html">AZCDCO6KK2T81</a><br/><p>A great summer film with really special special effects, a fun cast, and a simple story that is well-paced.  This is fun for the whole family.  I especially like that it isn't burdened down with Fruedian psycho-babble like so many comic book movies.  That has it's place and can add to a film, but this superhero story would just be dragged down by all that.  This is just fun popcorn entertainment.  A pleasant diversion from anything serious.<br /><br />The direction is swift and competent and doesn't get in the way.  Each hero/actor pulls his or her own weight and they all work well in this ensemble piece much like the X-Men series characters do.  The script is fun and funny, but nothing special.  It is a paint-by-numbers storyline.  The music is unremarkable for a superhero film and that is a serious flaw by my standards.<br /><br />This film has great repeat value and perfect for a day when one is shut in.  It is well-worth owning.</p></br><a href="../users/A36QYTMMJ0O2IZ.html">A36QYTMMJ0O2IZ</a><br/><p>Fantastic Four received a lot of criticism for being to campy, corny, not enough action, etc.  Well, guess what?  Fantastic Four is NOT Batman, Superman, or Spider-Man.  I think those who were expecting it to be were the ones who ended up being disappointed.<br /><br />The Fantastic Four is one of Marvel's oldest comic books.  Created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, it was intended to not only be a storyline about superheroes, but a storyline about family.  And that is what much of the Fantastic Four has always been about: family.  This, obviously, largely includes how they interact with each other.<br /><br />In my opinion, the film actually does a pretty good job bringing these popular characters to life.  Part of the success is in the story.  It's a simple story, and sometimes the simple stories are the most successful.<br /><br />The Fantastic Four does not have the complexity of Spider-Man's inner battle with his guilt and shame, nor the psychological complexities of Batman.  Perhaps this is one of the main reasons why the Fantastic Four's fan base is among the most diverse.  Not only is it collected by young boys and men, but also women like it for its relationship values.<br /><br />First of all, the casting is pretty darn good.  They nailed every single one of the characters.  Ioan Gruffud does a good job of playing the highly intellectual, Reed Richards.  Even in the comics, you wonder where Reed's love really lies...with Sue, or science.<br /><br />Jessica Alba was great as Sue Storm.  I had my reservations, at first, but then she loves to play comic-book icons, and she more than nails this role, bringing out Sue's emotional and maternal instincts as well as her toughness when she has to be.<br /><br />Chris Evans was a good choice to play the somewhat reckless Johnny Storm.  He brings a lot of energy to the part, which is necessary to play Johnny.<br /><br />Michael Chiklis is a perfect Ben Grimm.  Apparently, the character was Michael's favorite as a boy.  It's obvious by how accurate he plays the gentle, wounded soul of the Thing who is constantly afflicted his appearance which already robs him of his girlfriend.<br /><br />The interactions between these four characters is really what make the film work.  The banter between Johnny and Ben is fun, which is also true to the comic book as these two characters are always needling each other, even though it's obvious that they love and care about each other.  There is something sweet and touching in the relationship between Sue and Reed as she tries to break through that intellectual shell that he's always behind. They really do feel like a family.<br /><br />The only question of casting I have is Julian McMahon as Victor Von Doom.  He just doesn't have that presence that Doctor Doom should have.  Doctor Doom without question is one of Marvel's most feared and iconic "bad guys," and you need something more than what Julian is able to bring to play him.<br /><br />The origin is slightly altered for the film, but it works well.  The only origin that was drastically changed was that of Victor.  In the comic, he wears armor.  He doesn't change into some kind of metallic man.<br /><br />There are action scenes in the film, but again, it's not along the same lines as what you may be used to seeing in comic book film.  The final showdown with Doom in the streets of New York is well done, and not over-the-top like it could have been.<br /><br />I think a lot of fans were duped in by the PG-13 rating, thinking that it was going to be more action-packed and grittier than it is.  If they had gotten a PG rating instead (which it should have if a couple of elements were changed) then expectations may not have gotten so badly out of proportioned.<br /><br />I found this to be a fun and enjoyable film.  I won't lie to you though.  If you're looking for action and grittiness, then the Fantastic Four probably isn't for you, and you might be better off to try something else.<br /><br />But for Marvel's first family comic book, this movie does them pretty well.</p></br><a href="../users/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD.html">A3PPXVR5J6U2JD</a><br/><p>As franchises go, Fantastic Four is relatively unexplored territory. There are probably good reasons for this: one of the characters is a cigar-chomping piece of rock, three members of the team are related to each other, and one of character's claim to fame is his amazing intellect combined with...wait for it...the power of STRETCHING.  Which was pretty funny in the 70s when it was portrayed in cartoons (I can still hear the "stretching" sound like a vacuum played backwards) and is a little creepy today.<br /><br />Given that comics are the new hot property for movies, it was inevitable that the good 'ole FF have their own film.  And thus we have Ioan Gruffud (a less charismatic Jeff Goldblum) as Reed Richards/Mr. Fantastic, the delectable Jessica Alba as Sue Storm/The Invisible Woman, gruff Michael Chiklis as Ben Grimm/The Thing, and Chris Evans as the wisecracking pretty boy Johnny Storm/The Human Torch. Our heroic crew assembles in privately funded mission into space to explore...cosmic space gas. Only something goes terribly awry and the mutagenic mist transforms the four astronauts into super powered freaks.<br /><br />The inherent silliness of the plot and characters has been spoofed so many times that it's difficult for the actual Fantastic Four to keep up.  We've all seen the family squabbles of the Incredibles. But perhaps the most caustic send-up is The Venture Bros., who deftly skewers the FF by casting Reed as an outdated 50s stereotype, Sue as a liberated housewife, and The Thing as a mentally deficient monster.<br /><br />Perhaps FF can be forgiven for its lack of focus as it tries to walk the tightrope between being superhero silly and deadly serious.  Reed's romance with Sue is in its early stages here, complicated by a rival, Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon)...<br /><br />You!  You in the back with the funny haircut!  Stop laughing!  That's the man's name, all right?  It has nothing to do with his tendency for evil!  Or fancy alliteration.  Or that he happens to be a native of some country you've never heard of...that happens to send him a mask...that he just happens to wear...<br /><br />Fine.  Fine, yes, this is all a little ridiculous.  But there's angst!  Poor Grimm suffers as he struggles with his identity and his hot wife dumps him (while wearing a negligee in the middle of the street, of course). Will Reed propose to Sue, or will she stick with Doom? Will Johnny ever stop being such a card?  Will Sue ever discover how to turn invisible without taking off her clothes? (!)<br /><br />And so FF stumbles over itself in an attempt to be both true to the comic book's origins and cram in a plot that's really five stories into one film. Ben Grimm's angst as the unpleasant-looking Thing is diminished by a device that "cures" him. A device that didn't work without Doom's special powers, but mysteriously works in reverse without explanation. Alba is too sexy for the role; it's hard to believe the wooden Richards could romance her or that she'd find the stilted Von Doom any more attractive. And Richards' serious scientific efforts are undermined that he's basically a big inflatable balloon.  In fact, much of the fight scenes in this movie involve members of the FF battling each other.<br /><br />The special effects do a good job of displaying the heroes' powers, but The Thing simply looks like a guy in rubber foam.  Chiklis is big, but he's not a huge man, and the film sometimes remember he's heavy and cumbersome (complete with thudding footfalls and exploding chairs) and then forgets when it's inconvenient (because a wooden bench can surely handle his massive weight, right?).<br /><br />I think a lot of fans are just happy this film isn't the first attempt (that never saw the light of day but lives on in bootlegs).  For my FF fix, I prefer the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00157OI9Q">animated version</a>, which manages to be both hilarious and action-packed while poking fun at the utter ridiculousness of a super-science team consisting of a talking rock, a rubber band man, an invisible woman, and a real flamer.</p></br><a href="../users/A1SPB225CVTRUU.html">A1SPB225CVTRUU</a><br/><p>Fantastic Four's trailer misled me to believe that it's a great comic book/sci-fi thriller that would be as good as X-Men or Spider Man. It turns out that they pretty much used the best parts of the film to be the trailer. I didn't find it to be as entertaining as other recent comic book movies like Batman Begins or Sin City, and the characters are rather weak. Michael Chiklis' The Thing is pretty outstanding, but his super power is not very striking. The telekinetic power used by Jessica Biel(Sue Storm/The Invisible Woman) is somewhat of a copycat to Famke Janssen's role in X-Men. Couldn't they get someone as famous and sexy as Ryan Reynolds to play Johnny Storm/The Human Torch instead of Chris Evans. Ioan Gruffudd's role as Mr. Fantastic is my least favorite, and the romantic subplot involving Sue Storm and him was bland and irrelevant to the movie. As for the villian Victor Von Doom played by Julian McMahon was hardly evil enough, and he had too little action to tackle. The spcial effects were pretty good, and the final showdown was impressive. This film suffers from poor story, not enough fantastic battles, and star power.</p></br><a href="../users/A33CLVW2K7SL1P.html">A33CLVW2K7SL1P</a><br/><p>Movies about superheroes are a dime a dozen these days. Because there are so many, they have the extra burden of putting something original out there for us. I don't think this movie succeeded, unless you count a shot of Jessica Alba in her underwear, or Chris Evans running about for a few minutes with a jacket wrapped around his privates original.<br /><br />This is an "introductory" movie, and in that the superheroes need to change from ordinary people to "super people", and we need to see some of the angst that goes along with it. That takes time and grace. The problem here is that there were five people who were changed (including the villain), so that's five psyches that we need to get into. We're only allowed entry into one: Ben Grim. And the only reason he's upset is because he looks like, well, a "thing".<br /><br />We do get a glimpse at Johnny Storm, The Human Torch. He's deeeee-lighted by the changes, and a bit too happy-go-lucky.<br /><br />I was impressed by some of the minute attention to detail. In the comic strip, Dr. Doom is scarred by Mephisto's touch, and in his incredible vanity dons a mask to hide his scarred visage. We don't meet Mephisto here, but Doom is scarred, and he does pick up a mask to hide it.<br /><br />All-in-all, it's not a bad film. The special effects are decent, but we needed more reasons than we were given to root for the Fantastic Four, and more than we were given to root against Dr. Doom.</p></br><a href="../users/A36HBE2C5SQ2E6.html">A36HBE2C5SQ2E6</a><br/><p>After being in a spaceship when a unstable cloud of molcules explode, 5 people are suddenly changed forver. Everyone of them gains a superpower. Johnny Storm(Chris Evans)can all the sudden engulf his entire body in flames. Sue Storm(Jessica Alba) can make her self invisible and create dynamic force fields. Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis) turns into this stone thing that is only called The Thing, he has the ability to smash through things. Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd) all the sudden can stretch out all of his body parts. The last friend Victor Von Doom(Julian Mcmahon) is slowly turning into metal and is also slowly turning evil. After word gets out that there are a bunch of people with superpowers walking around New York City, The Press instantly jumps on them and wants to know more about them. Von Doom is getting angry that The Fantastic Four is taking away attention from his company and he goes out of his way to become Dr. Doom and end The Fantastic Four. another motivation behind that is that Sue had pitched nerdy Reed over him. So, he becomes mor and more intent to end all of the Fantastic Four's lives. at first, The Fantastic Four don't gel together. There is a constant grudge match between The Thing and Johnny. Also, there is some serious tension between Sue and Reed. Also, The Thing is hating being the the Thing because his wife left him and people stare at him and call him a monster. The Fantastic Four then fights Doom because he had become more powerful after taking all the power away from the Thing, and They have to do something about it or Doom will rule the city!<br /><br />This film was seriously mediocre. They could've found a better director than Tim Story. He directed Taxi, for god's sake. Also, this film had the cheesiness of a B movie, and some of the effects were horrid. They did stay faithful to the comic books but I felt that some parts were skewered by Tim Story and the writers.<br /><br />I recommend this movie if you can handle cheesiness or semi-cool effects. I don't recommend this to any fans because I feel that they will be angry at what has been done, and I was sure angry too. So, see if this film if you can handle it.</p></br><a href="../users/A9LAPV8XNKZVZ.html">A9LAPV8XNKZVZ</a><br/><p>this movie does not exceed expectations. It only proves not every comic makes a good movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NM0RAYSL6PA8.html">A3NM0RAYSL6PA8</a><br/><p>Fantastic Four has the feel of the Marvel projects of old -- a kind of low rent kitch with linear plots and questionable special effects.  It's more of an amusement park ride than a movie, and a lot like those modern roller coasters that are fast, comfortable, and amusing -- never dangerous or shocking.<br /><br />So, enjoy the Thing stopping an 18-wheeler, the Human Torch taking a guided missile on a race across the city, Jessica Alba in modest underwear, and a geeky Reed Richards slipping his hand under a door.  It's a summer diversion like a fat marshmallow squished between two grahams and slathered in melted Hershey's chocolate.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GKPMHV4U64IY.html">A3GKPMHV4U64IY</a><br/><p>The Fantastic 4 are very close to what they were in the comics (although Reed is far less confident) but Victor Von Doom is very different.  His origin is now the same as the Four and his powers are very different.  He could really have been a new villain altogether.<br /><br />As this is the first movie, we get the full origin tale as well as an adventure.  Our four heroes were on a space station during a storm and received amazing powers due to genetic changes.  Victor Von Doom is also on the station and receives powers.  First our heroes have to come to grips with their powers as they try to find a way to return to normal.  But their powers become very useful when they realize they have to stop Doom.<br /><br />The writers did a very good job of transplanting the Four into a modern setting.  Johnny Storm is more of a celebrity than before but it is within bounds.  There were quite a few interesting scenes with Ben Grimm (The Thing) and how his change affects his ability to do things.  Many of these seem to have been taken from another comic hero, Concrete, but still fit.  All in all a pretty good adaptation but I really did not like the changes done to Doom.  He is no longer the honorable villain and is just an evil bad guy.  Still, it is worth checking out if you are a fan of the Four.</p></br><a href="../users/A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ.html">A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ</a><br/><p>Why do all of these superhero movies have to spend so much time establishing CHARACTER!!!  These comics have been around for years!!  Get to the action already!!<br /><br />That, in my opinion, is what is inheritantly wrong with Fantastic Four. The sequence early on, where the 5 characters are given their powers is fantastic, but then the movie spends the next hour and ten minutes exploring what they can do.<br /><br />GET TO THE MEAT ALREADY! Get to the action!! Yawn... show us ONCE what they can do... and get on with it!! We know anyway! We knew coming into the theatre.<br /><br />And if you disagree with my view, consider that EVEN ONE OF THE STARS was disappointed that they didn't get to do all that much because they were setting up the characters the entire time. He was hoping there was a sequel so they could actually get to do some things... so??  Am I wrong?<br /><br />I hope there's a sequel too! At least they won't have to establish character again... I don't think?  Or maybe they will, thinking that people missed the first movie... dear lord, it's a vicious circle.<br /><br />Okay, so Reed Richards is really stretchy and they demonstrate that by having him catch a falling glass, unlock a door and looky really droopy in a mirror. Exciting stuff. Sue Storm can make herself invisible and they find equally exciting ways to demonstrate this. Ben Grimm becomes the Thing, a human rock, and he runs around accidentally knocking stuff over, accidentally breaking doors and crushing buttons. Johnny Storm becomes the human torch and until the end of the movie... he only used his powers to fight... well... no... to fly around a motorcross event and to fight... no... he flies more... well... I guess he has a little 'tiff' with his good buddy, the Thing. Does that count as a fight?<br /><br />FANTASTIC FOUR lacks emotions and you never really feel any REAL DANGER in this movie. Dr. Doom is a VERY VERY small part. Toward the end of the movie... he just decides that he wants to destroy the Fantastic Four and the battle is on.... a very short battle I might add.<br /><br />I'm not saying you shouldn't set up these characters and say how they came about.... but dear lord... don't spend 2/3 of the movie doing that!<br /><br />The effects were good, but the screenplay was a complete disaster. Many of the special effects scenes were basically just showing off what they could do with their f/x computers in scenes that weren't all that important anyway.<br /><br />The biggest scene of the movie, was a chain-reaction disaster on a bridge that is caused by... well... the Thing. THE BIGGEST SCENE OF THE MOVIE and it involved NO VILLAINS. The Thing sets the chain reaction in place and then saves the day to become a hero? "Sorry... I caused a huge chain reaction car crash where numbers of people could have and should have been killed, but I did save this one guy."<br /><br />A successful movie needs many things to make it memorable and make it good... first of all, you need to establish good characters, which this movie does so in OVERKILL.  Secondly, you need a strong nemesis (DOOM IS OVERSHADOWED), Thirdly, you need a script that allows your audience to play along and feel urgency and fear (SWING AND A MISS) and Finally, you need a reason for the audience TO BE CONCERNED and not have to work to root for the outcome. FANTASTIC FOUR doesn't do this at all.<br /><br />The movie isn't horrible, I'm only saying that it was a disappointment, not at all challenging, run of the mill and needed to give DR. DOOM more to do in order to fix it.<br /><br />I just thought this movie was very weak and wasted too much time GETTING TO THE POINT... which wasn't much of one...<br /><br />I think it was... OOH COOL, lOOK WHAT I CAN DO... FIGHT... DESTROY FANTASTIC FOUR... that was about it.</p></br><a href="../users/A5X1B2HBQUR3P.html">A5X1B2HBQUR3P</a><br/><p>A resonable start to the fantastic 4 franchise. The movie is directed well but not as good as the Xmen series . The worst thing about this movie is the soundtrack. The theme music is awful for lack of a better word. The direction by Tim Story is not as good as other super hero movie directors Sam Riami (Spiderman1,2,3), Bryan Singer (Xmen1,2) and Brett Ratner (Xmen3). The problem with 4 unlike xmen and spiderman is that this is one marvel series which stretches things quite a bit and requires a lot of tolerant imagination if you want to move it from a comic book to film. Although the idea of a rubber like stretchy man, a rock man (the thing), a human torch man who can go up in flames/travel at mach3 and a woman who becomes invisible lends itself well to the comic book universe, doing this on a movie screen is very tricky. To do so the director must employ a kind of real world seriousness to the movie like done in xmen and spiderman. The movie must take itself very seriously . These super heros are intrinsically slighly tougher for movie medium to be taken seriously and this gets in the way of the film. This one was atleast ok but the next one : rise of the silver surfer was a complete joke. This series is loosing out because the screenplay has to adapt a certain practicality, logic and plausibility when converting it from comic book to movie and that is not happening. You can't lift the comic book as it is without making changes and hope to make it work as a piece of film where you are going to have the non die hard fantastic 4 and the non die hard comic book fans also viewing the movie.<br /><br />regards, Vikram</p></br><a href="../users/A1TK6R2JSC97HL.html">A1TK6R2JSC97HL</a><br/><p>This is it, the version of "Fantastic Four" that was made with the boat-loads of money the subject deserved, and that the producers actually intended to see the light of day.  So was it worth the wait?  Not quite.<br /><br />In many respects, "Fantastic Four" patterns itself on the far superior and more successful "Spiderman" - still the standout among superhero movies and especially Marvel Superhero movies.  In this version, the Four are in space doing experiments for the wealthy Viktor Von Doom.  A vain and narrow-minded megalomaniac in the comic, this Doom is a Doom for the 21st century - he's a vain and narrow-minded CEO and (unlike the comic) he's in space with The Four when those crazy cosmic rays attack.  Back on Earth, it doesn't take long for everybody to realize that they've undergone some major life-change.  Hotheaded Johnny Storm becomes "The Human Torch".  The somewhat shy Sue becomes "Invisible Girl" ("girl?!" she asks indignantly when first hearing the name).  Ben Grim morphs into "The Thing" while Reed Richards becomes the oddly-named "Mr. Fantastic".  Of course, nothing in this movie takes long to happen - before you know it, we've got enough dirt on the characters to see where things are going (Reed & Sue's past romance; Ben's rivalry with Johnny) though little in the story explains why the characters act the way they do.  Before you know it, the final battle's been fought, and we get the obligatory sequel-teaser scene.  Following Spiderman's lead, we've got a major act of superheroism on a bridge, the pivotal superhero-naming occurs in a big-time sporting event (motorcross instead of wrestling), and the villain as a CEO who literally kills his rivals.  FF4 is a movie that fills in the grooves, eager to offend no fans while moderately pleasing the largest audience.  It's fun but by the end, you'll probably doubt it was at all fantastic.</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>Based upon the comic book series of the same name, FANTASTIC FOUR is a sci-fi action movie about a group of scientists who gain superpowers from a powerful cosmic ray while aboard a laboratory and observation space station above Earth.  Their powers aren't apparent immediately and are dormant upon re-entry.  However, towards the end of their quarantine upon re-entry the five individuals become aware of changes in their bodies:  Dr. Richard Reed (Ioan Gruffudd) has the ability to stretch his body into incredible lengths and shapes and takes on the name of Mr. Fantastic; Susan Storm (Jennifer Alba) is Reed's love interest and brother of Johnny Storm (Chris Evans) finds that she is able to become invisible at will and create force fields and is known as the Invisible Woman; Johnny Storm finds he is capable of turning himself into a living human ball of fire and that he can fly and thus calls himself The Human Torch; Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis) becomes the most changed of the group having gained superhuman strength and endurance, but through a growth spurt that not only increased his sized but covered his body in giant orange scales that look like rocks.  Also aboard the station at the time of the accident was the man who financed the project, Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon).  Doom doesn't outwardly acknowledge the changes occurring within him, which basically has to do with his body turning metal and some other secret skills, and blames Reed for allowing the accident to happen, even though Doom was the man at fault.  Of course, Doom was courting Sue Storm, so it doesn't help that Reed is the one who ends up winning her heart.  After revealing to the world their powers, the team tries to find a way to reverse the effects of the cosmic ray while Doom secretly plans to take over the world.<br /><br />FANTASTIC FOUR has some incredible special effects.  Apparently one of the scenes of The Human Torch flying over New York was completely computer generated and took four months to create.  Despite this, the movie is relatively low on action.  There's a major fight sequence at the end, but other than that there's not much.  The reason for this is that the studio behind the film plans on making FANTASTIC FOUR into at least a trilogy and as the first part of the trilogy, this film is intended to set up things that are to come later.<br /><br />I usually don't mention this, but FANTASTIC FOUR has some amazing makeup.  The Thing was not created using CGI, but instead was brought to life the old-fashioned way, through makeup and costuming.  In a day and age when many films completing ignore traditional ways of doing things, it's nice to see a movie that doesn't do that, especially in one that had so many other CGI created effects to begin with.<br /><br />I didn't read very many FANTASTIC FOUR comics, but I had read enough to know the general origins and premise.  The movie stays fairly accurate to the original series (some of the action sequences were taken directly from the original comic books), though some things have been altered to make the film more modern and dramatic (e.g. Doom's presence on Shield at the time of the "collision).  I was a little disappointed by the lack of action, but overall thought the movie was a good adaptation and a fairly exciting comic book action movie.  FANTASTIC FOUR might not quite be on par with SPIDERMAN, but it's a good opening film about a historic comic book fighting team.</p></br><a href="../users/A82LIVYSX6WZ9.html">A82LIVYSX6WZ9</a><br/><p>Reed Richards, Ben Grimm, Susan Storm,her brother Johnny Storm and Victor Von Doom all get struck by a storm in space and soon after they all start to change....I mean literally. Reed Richards, played by Ioan Gruffudd (King Arthur), can stretch any part of his body....he's rubber. Ben Grimm a.k.a. The Thing, played by Michael Chikilis (FX'S The Shield), transforms completley into solid rock...even his heart is made of rock. Susan Storm, played by Jessica Alba (Sin City), can make herself go invisible and her brother Johnny Storm, played by Chris Evans (Cellular), can yell "flame on" or snap his fingers and his whole body can turn into flames and he can also fly.....these 4 are the Fantastic Four. On the otherside of the table there is the 5th member, Victor Von Doom, played by Julian McMahon (FX'S Nip/Tuck), who finds out his whole body is becoming metallic....he can manipulate things like light fixtures and sockets in the walls. Then, Von Doom gets really pissed off at the Fantastic 4 sprouting "this is what happens when someone truly embraces their destiny" and he tries to get rid of the Fantastic 4. What this movie needs is a shot of adrenaline. When the action kicks in towards the end it goes somewhere but the corny stuff in the middle we dont need. Michael Chiklis gives an unimpressive performance, Ioan Gruffudd is so-so, Jessica Alba was too weak and Chris Evans was too over the top in his performance but he did have his moments. Only Julian McMahon as Von Doom was the highlight because McMahon can play a sinister bastard pretty darn good. Some of the dialouge, basically one liners from the 4 are really stupid. Truly doesnt have nothing on what Batman Begins offered which was much better. Of course there is the cameo by Stan Lee, creator....some might spot him, some might not.</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>While "Four" wasn't exactly "Fantastic" it was an entertaining diversion. I really wanted to like "Fantastic Four". I grew up reading the comic book as a kid and enjoyed Jack Kirby's unique artwork and Stan Lee's campy scripts. The film directed by Tim Story tries to recapture the essence of "Fantastic Four" and although it doesn't quite measure up to expectations, Story does a better job than I expected. Although "Fantastic Four" isn't a classic on the par of "X-2", "Spider-Man 2" or "Batman Begins", it doesn't pretend to be. "Fantastic Four" tries to recapture what made "Spider-Man" so successful with its mix of comedy, drama and superheroics. It's an enjoyable romp that is as disposable as "Daredevil" was. Avoiding the camp of truly bad comic book inspired movies like "Batman & Robin", "Fantastic Four" works best when the screen is given over to the conflict between Johnny Storm ("The Human Torch") and Ben Grimm ("The Thing"). Their bickering recalls the formula that worked so well in the comics during their heyday.<br /><br />When NASA turns down his proposal for an experiment in space scientist Reed Richards approachs classmate/ scientist/venture capitalist Victor Von Doom to finance it. Richards wants to go up to Doom's privately funded space station to test the effects of a cosmic storm on living plants. Richards believes that this cosmic storm may have contributed to life evolving on Earth and wants to see what properties the storm has on DNA. Unfortunately, things go wrong when the storm approaches the space station hours ahead of schedule exposing Richards, his friend astronatu Ben Grimm, pilot Johnny Storm, his sister Sue Storm and Von Doom to the effects of the storm.<br /><br />The storm changes them all in ways they could never imagine: Richards becomes elastic able to stretch into any shape; Grimm literally is turned into a superhuman monster with huge rock like scales that protect him and with unnatural strength; Johnny can change into a pillar of fire that can fly; Sue has the ability to generate force fields and turn invisible. This motley crew of dynsfunctional bickering superheroes join forces to become the Fantastic Four. They must face Von Doom who has mutated a form of organic metal that's able to control electricity.<br /><br />While the film quickly jumps right into the action, it does take a while for the plot to move along to the conflict between Dr. Doom and the Fantastic Four. Ioan Gruffudd's Richards needed to be better developed as a character and Jessica Biel just wasn't up to the task of playing the underwritten role of Sue Storm. Still, Story manages to come up with a number of strong set pieces making the film memorable if not an outright classic like "Spider-Man" or "Batman Begins". The humor of the film takes center stage quite often and it does work to the film's advantage. The best visual effects sequeneces are pretty much put on display in the trailer and the CGI seems a bit unfinished at times (such as some of Richards' stretching scenes much as the early CGI Spidey sequences weren't completely convincing in "Spider-Man" but there the script and performances were so good you could forgive the shortcomings of the visual effects)where the textures look far too cartoony to be completely convincing. The scenes with The Torch look much more convincing. It's evident that much was cut from the film and it appears choppy at times. If this had been released at the same time as "Spider-Man" (or shortly before), it would have been seen as a much more important movie. Following so closely in the wake of "Batman Begins" and Spielberg's "War of the Worlds", "Fantastic Four" lacks the truly commanding scope or character development that were so critical to those films. The script credited to Mark Frost (co-creator/writer/producer of "Twin Peaks" and Michael France (writer on Ang Lee's "The Hulk" and tepid "The Punisher") runs, pardon the pun, hot and cold. The casting seems dead on (with a few notable exceptions). Michael Chiklis, Chris Evans and Julian McMahon are perfectly cast (although without enough to do). Gruffudd seems right for the part but, again, character development would have helped his role a bit more.<br /><br />If the film does well at the box office expect a sequel. The good news that, perhaps, they'll bring in a strong writer and perhaps deal with the Galactus/Silver Surfer story line that was so memorable in the 60's. Give the next film to someone with an edgier take on the story, focus on character development a bit more and have a narrative that has the slam-bang action approach of "X-2". One of the difficulties with a feature like this is the fact that there are so many characters that need screen time. It can be a challenge to balance that with the action.</p></br><a href="../users/A2A6NH6DPE0VXR.html">A2A6NH6DPE0VXR</a><br/><p>I was gonna listen to the bad reviews and not see this movie. That would've been a big mistake though. Ebert gave it one star and called the 5 main characters idiots for what they attempt in outta space. Well scientists are always  planning on doing something far fetched in movies that don't make sense. Here it just sets up for them to get their powers. Plus Ebert loved Batman Begins and just way way too hard on this movie because he thinks people should see that instead. Well Batman already made a lot of money. Now is Fantastic Four's turn. I've known people who said Batman Begins was boring. I loved it but this movie is more fun and has a lot more humor. I don't think people will be disapointed in it after seeing Batman at all. Yes that is what a Batman  movie should be like and Fanastic Four is...what a Fantastic Four movie should be like.<br /><br />  I've seen cartoon shows and this is exactly what it was like. So yes the whole lets go in space and do this and that is a flat idea. From what I know though, it came straight from the comics. It doesn't hold the movie back though. It's still a great comic adaption and a stronger one than Eleckra, Daredevil, Punisher and The Hulk. It has it's silly moments but still they don't take away from how enjoyable this movie is. I thought the cast does a fine job making their characters work.<br /><br />  Ioan Gruffudd (King Arthur) fairs well as Reed Richards who gets stretching powers. Each power they get fits their personality. He's a dreamer and always reaching for the stars so that's why he got that ability. Jessica Alba (SinCity) as Susan Storm does ok too as Richards' former g/f who feels invisable compared to his love for science. So she gets invisable powers. Chris Evans (Cellular) as Johny Storm is hilarious as a young pilot hotshot with a flaming ego. So he gets powers where he literly goes on fire. Michael Chiklis (The Shield) steals the show as well as Ben Grimm. He's Reed's bestfriend and protector. So since he's seen as being like a rock, he turns into a big rock guy. He loses his wife due to how he looks now. Plus the whole world stares at him. So he has the most trouble accepting his new powers since unlike the others he can't turn them on and off.<br /><br />  Julian McMahon (Nip/Tuck, Charmed) plays Victor Von Doom who funded their mission to space. He also is on the ship and gets some powes as well. His start turning him steal and give him powers to shoot electric bolts. Like Johny Storm, he embraces his powers the most. Storm though just wants to show them off. Victor though wants to use them to kill whoever pisses him off and to rule. McMahon plays him well too and does a fine job  crossing over from tv to film. Although Doom is supposed to have an accent. Oh well, not McMahon's fault he was mis-casted.  Still he makes the best of the part.<br /><br />  When I saw that the movie was getting bad reviews I figured it was due to Tim Story's direction. He also did that dud Taxi. However I think he handles the action and everything fine. So I think one star is very very hard on this film. It's tons of fun with funny one-liners, especially from Chris Evans. Plus when the four of them don't get along and usee their powers against each other, it's just great fun. Especially when Grimm gets mad at Johny Storm for nick naming him the Thing in front of millions of people. When those two exchange words or get ready to fight, it's just good stuff. Chiklis really is the Thing and pulls off the part fantastic!<br /><br />  Should this movie be dismissed with one star ? Hell no! I think it's just as entertaining as the Spiderman movies.  So take a chance like me and go see it. Expect something awful and you're gonna have a blast. I like it because it has it's own style. Who says a comic movie has to be overly serious like DareDevil the Hulk or the Punisher . This movie has more of a cartoonish style and what is so terrible about that. I think that is what makes it a good adaption to the comic. So what if it's aimed for kids, aren't they the ones who read comics ? Plus the effects are not that bad like Ebert & Roeper said. When Reed stretches around The Thing to calm him down, I think that  looked great and just how it should look.  Don't listen to Ebert & Roeper, they think people should just rush to see documentaries about migrating birds. They don't know what a good time is.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VQSFORKH8B7O.html">A3VQSFORKH8B7O</a><br/><p>Finally, after several overrated psychological dramas posing as superhero films ("Spider-man 1 & 2, "The Hulk," to name a few) comes "Fantastic Four," a thrilling film that is superior to most recent superhero films, second only to "Batman Begins." While the storytelling is a bit off, the terrific cast, epic action, and fantastic visual effects more than make up for it! If you're a fan of the comic book, you'll enjoy the movie. If you're new to the Fantastic Four, as I was, then this is a great primer! Prepare for the fantastic!<br /><br />Grade: A-</p></br><a href="../users/A17NVM7IAPF2NS.html">A17NVM7IAPF2NS</a><br/><p>...especially considering that there was some real, substantial acting talent here minus Alba, of course, whose role in any movie is mere eye candy.  How many near-nudity/underwear shots were there?  About 3, weren't there?  Anything more would have been bordering on gratuitous...point made.<br /><br />To summarize briefly, most of the actors in this movie are standing around as if to say, "Ok, Mr. Director, what do I do now?"  "Something weird just happened...what do I do now?"<br /><br />Unfortunately, the plot contrivances are ploddingly predictable from the Thing's frustrations to where the internal conflicts within the group penultimately lead as well as Doom's demise (or merely defeat?  muhahahahahaha!!!).<br /><br />I'm not looking forward to any adventuring with the 4 if the same directing/screenplay talent is employed.  I only give it an additional star for the effects and the Thing's performance, despite the surreality of his surroundings.</p></br><a href="../users/A27P0MW8TE1JQP.html">A27P0MW8TE1JQP</a><br/><p>When you make a movie based on the Fantastic Four comic, this is what you have working against you:<br /><br />-The Fantastic Four is a beloved Comic Book.<br /><br />-The definative superhero group characters created by Stan Lee in the 60's along with his other ultra-icon Marvel heroes are introduced (later followed by the X-Men).<br /><br />-These characters have been archetypes in not only the comic book industry, but in comic book movies, making these heroes seem tired and cliched, before even the movie trailer begins.<br /><br />-Some of the these movies used Marvel concepts so close that concepts accident ran together, most recently the Incredibles: which had a team with strongman, a super-stretcher, an invisible girl with forcefields, and a baby who has flame-power along with multiple other powers. Infact, a scene was cut from the F.F. Movie, with the Thing rescuing a cat from a tree by ripping the tree from the ground and shaking it, because the Incredibles "beat them to the punch!"<br /><br />-No amount of "Re-inventing" without completely losing the original concept can alter the "retro-ness" even the {forgive me} cheesyness of the superhero group. So anyone making a F.F. movie, even someone who wasn't Roger Corman, would have to struggle with this. This extends to the special effects, no amount of SFX will alter the fact that a guy wrapping his body around a rock-man is not going to be real believable!<br /><br />On the plus side:<br /><br />-This F.F. filmmaker would still have Stan Lee's words, written during a time of extreme civil-strife and change, still ring true, urging us to "judge, not on appearances, but actions" I believe that that message, is still apparent in this 2005 film version.<br /><br />-Good casting is an factor working in this films favor, especially (Michael C.'s)the Thing, who like the comic is the most interesting, the most "human" character. This was the sledge-hammer irony Stan Lee was going for in the comic and it remains in the film. The Johnny Storm / Ben Grim dynamic is fun, if forced, this is perhaps the single across-the-board flaw of the film. Everything is a little forced, to the altering of the origin to include Dr. Doom, down to the need to untransform the Thing. I would rather have seen the Galactus/ Silver Surfer storyline intergrated into an origin story (while we're forcing things here.)<br /><br />Even in the world of post-Spider-Man movies, Fantastic Four is still a comic book movie, not a Graphic Novel movie or an art house film. It is a fun film, no more, no less.<br /><br />Mr. Fantastic's hair maybe alittle too fantastic.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B3Z2QHW3V35S.html">A2B3Z2QHW3V35S</a><br/><p>I've never been into Fantastic Four, X-man, or Superman cartoons or comic books.

This is a great movie that I am sure everyone will enjoy.</p></br><a href="../users/A356HRZZFCEGL1.html">A356HRZZFCEGL1</a><br/><p>***This review may contain spoilers.***<br /><br />Although I am a reasonably avid Fantastic Four fan, I continually procrastinated in attending a theater viewing because of the negatively vehement disappointment "professional" critics and mere mortals have been heaping on it. However,  I finally plucked up enough resolve to go see it. The verdict? My trepidation was basically groundless.<br /><br />The "Fantastic Four" (hereafter FF) possesses and displays most of the ingredients for an engrossing "superhero" motion picture: involving story, appealing and sympathetic characters, lavish and largely convincing special effects and set-pieces, an appropriately sinister and amoral antagonist, a complex but nimble plot, and refreshing humor. No, it is not a brooding, tortured, haunted movie in the overwrought "Batman" mode.  The FF doesn't roll that way. Apparently Tim Story decided to adhere to the spirit and tone of the original 60's manifestation of the comic book: an exploration of the ultimate nuclear family. The FF's predominant theme is not the power/responsibility inter-dynamic(like Spiderman), or a psychotic obsession with vengeful crimefighting (like Batman). Instead, FF engagingly unites "Lilo and Stitch"'s and Sister Sledge's themes of "We are family, where nobody gets left behind."<br /><br />Furthermore, despite its light approach, FF is actually a sensible movie. If cosmic storm energy reconfigured your DNA, you wouldn't (or shouldn't) go running off immediately to fight crime. As our colorful quartet, and even Victor von Doom (aka Dr. Doom) wisely do, they medically analyze their new conditions and powers to see if any potentially harmful side effects may occur. For example, even the brash and impulsive Johnny Storm (Chris Evans) observes, and I paraphrase, "Ben seems to be the only one who can't turn his power on and off. What if that happens to us?" Of course, such introspection can be taken to an extreme, as the pensive Reed Richards (aka Mr. Fantastic) (Ioan Gruffudd) fully demonstrates in the movie, as he quarantines his partners and himself in a desperate attempt to reverse the storm's effects. But such cerebral caution characterizes Reed. Anyway, the FF movie provides counterpoint to the foursome's seclusion with Johnny's impetuous and successful desire to "bust out" and enjoy his incendiary new powers.<br /><br />The FF movie also plausibly and poignantly details the anguish, frustration, and shocked despair Benjamin Jacob Grimm (aka Thing)(Michael Chiklis) endures. If you found yourself imprisoned in a granite exoskeleton, wouldn't you do what Ben does - literally break out of the hospital facility, conceal your identity, and cautiously attempt to reconnect with your fianc&eacute;e? Wouldn't you swim in sullen self-pity? Ben does these things, but unlike most of us, who would probably go on an insane rampage or attempt to commit suicide, he possesses enough resiliency (Mr. Fantastic isn't the only one) and nobility to try to come to grips with his grotesque fate, even using a little grim (no pun intended) humor to cope. The saving of the bridge jumper's, the trucker's and the New York fire department's lives help illuminate this "brute"'s soul of gold. Victor's unhinged horror at his own parallel titanium transformation further reflects positively on Ben's tenacity and courage. Chiklis embraces the Thing's character and owns it. A movie with him alone would still definitely be the price of admission.<br /><br />Admittedly, the FF does deviate from realistic behavior. For example, I would agree that Susan Storm (aka the Invisible Woman) (Jessica Alba) is not a conventional idea of a genetic scientist, but she is no flighty bimbo either. She is an alluring but sweet, shy, and caring individual. As another example, the New York public warm up to the super-powered quartet a little too rapidly and unambiguously. After all, shouldn't they be a bit disturbed at the Brooklyn bridge accident, even if it was accidental? Maybe Ben's rescue of the FDNY firefighters (symbols of 9/11 heroism) helped sway public opinion. Finally, Ben's erstwhile fianc&eacute;, I don't think, would be so callous as to unceremoniously leave his engagement ring on the bridge after his heroic act. If she really cared for Ben, wouldn't she more discreetly mail it back to him. Finally (spoiler here), how did Ben Grimm, after requiring Victor's electrical boost in the simulation chamber to revert to normal, find the same power in Victor's absence to transform back to the Thing in a -yes- self-sacrificing act to help his friends? It seems a bit too abrupt.<br /><br />Yet, as my summary indicates, abruptness, as I see it, is the FF movie's only true weakness. The movie is a bit too breezy at times. For example, Ben's encounter with the blind but discerning Alicia Masters (Kerry Washington) could have been developed more at length. Ditto with Reed and Sue's reconciliation. Victor's Anankin-like descent to brooding, Darth Vader-like evil needed a bit more room to grow. Both the bridge sequence and the climactic battle against Doom were a bit truncated. Nevertheless, these are minor criticisms.<br /><br />The FF is solidly rousing, accessible, uplifting entertainment.  In some ways, the movie compares to the original 1978 movie "Superman", which, as you recall, also had its share of adapting to stark social and superpower changes, goofy action sequences, wholesome humor, and broad, cartoonish villains. FF remains faithful to its origins while simultaneously blazing its own comic cinema trail. It has successfully introduced its inimitable clan to the movie world.<br /><br />Now, in the comic, the FF is not only concerned with family, but also with galactic cosmic concerns, a la Galactus, the Silver Surfer, the Watchers, the Skrulls, et al. The FF sequels, and I hope there are a few, should address some of these universal themes. "The Trial of Galactus" storyline would be ideal, and perhaps satisfy the pretentiously persnickety critics who complain that comic themes are too superficial. If FF can correct its "shortness" problem in subsequent films, it should dramatically prove those critics wrong.<br /><br />As Stan Lee (mailman Willie Lumpkin in the movie) would say:<br /><br />Excelsior!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />P.S.:  I guess somebody listened to my suggestion.  The FF sequel introduces the Silver Surfer and Galactus.  However, to me the sequel was a precipitous disappointment.  But that is for another review.</p></br><a href="../users/A370Z6I5GBWU44.html">A370Z6I5GBWU44</a><br/><p>This is a decent sequel to the first film.

Sigh, I suppose that line was supposed to rouse some sort of familial inner child of mine to like this movie. It didn't work. The Fantastic Four starring all B list actors and a couple of C listers was a serious stinker.  I love comics, and the movies lately based on these comics (x-men, superman, batman begins, Spiderman) have been super-delish, unfortunately there is always a couple that try to latch onto the capes of the successful and wind up being an hour and a half long ode to clich&eacute;s and horrible acting. Poor Jessica Alba, with her Bratz doll look-alike face could not hold this movie up by herself, nor could her mediocre skills at trying to be a scientist. Mr. Fantastic? Who the heck is this guy, I looked him up on IMDB and he was Horatio Hornblower, could they not get someone else! He might have looked like the comic character, but to me he looked more like the lovechild of James Woods and Jeff Goldblum.  The others like Thing, and Torch guy, and Dr Nip and Tuck were so bland and one dimensional it seemed like during the whole film I was waiting for the cardboard cutouts to flipping leave and the real people actors to step in. The storyline, basically a soap opera with sparks. Tim Story who directed this has as far as I can see one major film under his belt "Barbershop", and he is slated to direct the next Fantastic Four movie, which has the foursome adding a fifth the Silver Surfer being played by Doug Adams who was the fish guy in Hell boy. I will have to say that no part of my body mind or soul wishes to sit through another FF mess.</p></br><a href="../users/A26HFSVLAGULIM.html">A26HFSVLAGULIM</a><br/><p>FIRST THOUGHTS: IT WASN'T THE X-MEN BUT IT WAS A FUN FILM TO WATCH<br /><br />As a youngster during the 60s when the Marvel comic and TV animated series were running [Fantastic 4] I found this franchise to be the most interesting and compelling. When the X-Men were produced into two great feature films I was very hopeful as to the disposition of the promised Fantastic Four feature.<br /><br />IN A NUTSHELL: A FILM ABOUT COPING WITH CHANGE - STRESS & ESTRANGEMENT<br /><br />The "Fantastic Four" feature film took the 'origins of the fantastic four' as the movie's theme. To this extent the film was competent, but nothing out of the ordinary, when compared to the recent X-Men and Spider Man releases. Nevertheless, this film is entertaining and does make sense, although it is not beneath pandering to young men via Jessica Alba's implicit nudity. It is mostly a film about people facing the stress and the estrangement that comes with major unexpected changes in themselves, and how others see and relate to them. This is most coherently portrayed by Ben Grim/'THE THING' [Michael Chiklis] who brings some much needed humanity to this piece in the form a small measure of a 'beauty and the beast' subplot. In essence, Ben Grim has turned into 'The Thing' and unlike the others he can not turn back - he is stuck in his superhero mode and basically feels apart from everything that was in his world, before the accident in Space. Only a blind woman can see that he is not a monster, and this could have been enlarged within the plot to good effect.<br /><br />THINGS TO MARVEL AT:<br /><br />The scene on the Brooklyn Bridge is easily the most amazing scene in the film. Ben Grim is on center stage as he confronts a would-be jumper as he ponders the same thoughts [jumping off the bridge]. With a little comedy and special effects, Ben Grim stops a huge truck cold, saves the jumper and creates a debacle on the bridge that ends with the recognition of the 'Fantastic 4' as group of superheros as a breaking headline story on the news.<br /><br />- * MAJOR ACTORS - *  * Tim Story - Director *<br /><br />Ioan Gruffudd  - Reed Richards/Mr. Fantastic<br />Jessica Alba  - Susan Storm/The Invisible Girl<br />Chris Evans  - Johnny Storm/The Human Torch<br />Michael Chiklis  - Ben Grimm/The Thing<br />Julian McMahon  - Dr. Victor Von Doom<br />Hamish Linklater  - Leonard<br />Kerry Washington  - Alicia Masters<br />Laurie Holden  - Debbie McIlvane<br />David Parker  - Ernie<br />Kevin McNulty  - Jimmy O'Hoolihan<br />Maria Menounos  - Sexy Nurse<br /><br />ABOUT THE DVD: EXCELLENT WIDESCREEN DIGITAL TRANSFER OF AUDIO &  VIDEO<br /><br /> ** SPECIAL FEATURES ** LOOKS LIKE A LOT MORE THAN IT IS **<br /><br /> - Available Subtitles: English, Spanish<br /> - Available Audio Tracks: English (DTS 5.1), English (Dolby  Digital 5.1), Spanish (Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround)<br /> - Commentary by: Jessica Alba, Michael Chiklis, and Ioan Gruffud<br /> - 3 deleted scenes<br /> - The Fantastic Tour: Exclusive behind-the-scenes home video hosted by the entire cast<br /> - Making of Fantastic Four<br /> - Fox Movie Channel Presents Casting Session & Making A Scene<br /> - Music videos: Everything Burns, Come On Come In, Music<br />Exclusive inside look at X-Men 3 - hosted by producer Avi Arad<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: WORKMANLIKE ADAPTATION OF A TRULY FANTASTIC COMIC SERIES<br /><br />ALSO RECOMMENDED:<br /><br /> X2: X-Men United  (2003, Bryan Singer)<br /> Spider-Man  (2002, Sam Raimi)<br /> X-Men  (2000, Bryan Singer)<br /> The Hulk  (2003, Ang Lee)<br /> Spider-Man 2  (2004, Sam Raimi</p></br></body></html>

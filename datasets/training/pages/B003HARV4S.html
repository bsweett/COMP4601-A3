She's played by Jessica Biel and the Prince (Rufus Sewell) wants to marry her and he's used to getting what he wants. Norton and Biel want to be together but they know the Prince will have them killed if they try to runaway together. After someone is murdered, the chief inspector (Paul Giamatti) has his eyes on Norton.<br /><br />  The Illusionist is a beautifully done movie. It's well acted, well filmed and a well told fairytale. Rufus Sewell deserves some credit here as the Prince. Yes he has played similar roles in the past but he manages to make this performance different a little than his usual villian performance. It's a little closer to Joaquin Phoenix's performance in Gladiator than Sewell's villian performance's in A Knight's Tale or The Legend of Zorro. I think he gives one of his best performances ever.<br /><br />  Paul Giamatti also has a better role here than he did Lady in the Water. He was wasted there but here he's fantastic and pretty much owns every scene he's in. Biel also handles a serious role fine as well and gives a better performance than she has in any movie. I'm talking about Norton less because you already know he's good of course. I love everything about this movie, even the musical score is well done.</p></br><a href="../users/A33TBHM3O9AY17.html">A33TBHM3O9AY17</a><br/><p>I saw this over the weekend and was pleasantly surprised.  Going in, I was expecting mainly a chick-flick (since my wife recommended it, and that's her main taste), and although this had a strong romantic theme it was anything but a chick-flick.  It's full of mystery, political intrigue, and plenty of suspense as well -- overall a very well balanced film.<br /><br />The feel and flavor of late-nineteenth century Vienna were very well done, particularly in the use of lighting and color (or rather, disuse of both elements -- lots of dark, drab scenes).  I thought Paul Giamatti was well cast as Chief Inspector Uhl, a man caught between his own ambitions and integrity.  I recently saw him as well in "Lady in the Water", and this newer role demonstrates his versatility as an actor.  Even better, I thought Ed Norton was excellent as Eisenheim, and got great support from Jessica Biel.  In my humble opinion only Rufus Sewell as crown prince Leopold was a little overdone, leaning disturbingly toward melodrama, but the other actors compensated nicely.<br /><br />As to the story itself, it has just enough of a blend of fairy tale, fantasy, realism and plausibility to appeal to a wide range of viewers.  The end offers a surprising twist that some may suspect but few fully understand or appreciate -- if they're honest about it.  Regardless of whether you can explain every detail, I think most of us will find this to be a very entertaining and enjoyable tale.</p></br><a href="../users/A39W3263A9HCMN.html">A39W3263A9HCMN</a><br/><p>A few weeks back, I saw this movie with my sister and her friend.

This movie seems designed for a smaller art house audience.<br /><br />The movie opens with a prologue in which a common young cabinet-maker becomes interested in magic and draws the attention and affection of a young noblewoman.  Their romance is a forbidden one, and the young man leaves home to find his fortune.<br /><br />"The Illusionist" properly gets underway as the acclaimed magician Eisenheim returns to 19th Century Vienna after a long absence.  Played with stoic and enigmatic understatement by Edward Norton, Eisenheim peforms some remarkable feats on stage, so good that the viewer is never quite sure, until the end of the movie, whether he is the simple illusionist he claims to be, or something more.<br /><br />One night, a volunteer from the audience turns out to be the noblewoman Sophie (played by Jessica Biel), fiancee of Leopold the Crown Prince of Austria-Hungary, but once Eisenheim's childhood sweetheart.  The two contrive to meet in private, to the anger of Leopold, played by Rufus Sewell as an ambitious but abusive and drunken lout.  Leopold sends Police Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti) to warn off Eisenheim.<br /><br />Eisenheim and Sophie are soon committed to a desperate plan to be together, only to be foiled by Sophie's apparent murder by Leopold.  An angry Eisenheim begins a subtle campaign to challenge and undermine Leopold through his magic shows, initiating a contest of wills with Uhl, who is torn between his duty to investigate Sophie's murder and his ambition to rise with the Crown Prince.  As the movie spins out to its violent conclusion, the only thing the viewer can count on is that nothing is quite as it seems.<br /><br />"The Illusionist" nicely captures the atmospherics of Vienna in its last decades as capital of the Austria-Hungarian Empire.  The movie has a measured pace, meditating over its detailed period sets and relying on some superb acting, especially by Giamatti, to carry along a rather austere plot.  The ending is nicely done, if a little too convenient for the dark tone of most of the movie.  Sharp-eyed viewers may see it coming, but the movie tries hard to be subtle.<br /><br />This movie is highly recommended as good entertainment for fans of the magic genre.</p></br><a href="../users/A38YUU4J5Q4EJO.html">A38YUU4J5Q4EJO</a><br/><p>The cinematography in this movie is the best I have ever seen. It is a turn of the century love story between Edward Norton (the illusionist) and Jessica Beil.<br /><br />They were childhood sweethearts, unwillingly seperated as youngsters, but cross paths years later, at one of Norton's shows.<br />She is already engaged to a crowned prince, but still loves Norton's character.<br />They decide they want to be together again, and this is where the movie takes off.<br /><br />The story itself is WONDERFUL, but even more than that, The reason I wrote this review was just to comment on the QUALITY of this picture. The sets are so wonderful, it will have you totally believing that you fell through a hole in time. The picture quality is so out of this world that the regular DVD looks like it is in high definition...Not only is the quality sharp, the entire movie has a beautiful golden hue, and I swear it looks like you are in an oil painting.<br /><br />I have seen good cinematography on movies like "Lord of the rings", or "The Village" but this is the best I've seen.<br />The casting too, couldn't have been done any better.<br />Take all that, add a great storyline, and you have a MASTERPIECE !!!</p></br><a href="../users/A141HP4LYPWMSR.html">A141HP4LYPWMSR</a><br/><p>"Life and Death, Space and Time, Fate and Chance," what is reality and what is illusion? With its sepia-toned cinematography and lush turn-of-the-century Vienna setting `The Illusionist' presents to the audience a mesmerizing period piece that truly bends natures laws as it transports the viewer to another time, another place.<br /><br />I was drawn into the landscape of this film in a way I haven't been in quite some time. Along with the magnificent setting, costumes and soundtrack there are some wonderful performances within. Edward Norton's intense, stoic persona and brooding passion for his childhood sweetheart is the heart and soul of this production, perfectly complimented by the lovely ethereal presence of Jessica Biel as his lifelong love, Sophie. The film also offers yet another amazing performance by Paul Giamatti as police inspector Uhl and a villainous and obsessive role perfectly delivered by Rufus Sewell as Crown Prince Leopold.<br /><br />Now you see it, now you don't. My advice, SEE IT!</p></br><a href="../users/A1NSMQIF1C2VCE.html">A1NSMQIF1C2VCE</a><br/><p>Now this is the kind of movie that I hoped "Lady in the Water" would be: Magical, mysterious, incredibly stylish. One of the best movies that I've seen in years.<br /><br />"The Illusionist" takes a number of chances that shouldn't work -- How many great movies about the turn-of-the-century Austro-Hungarian Empire are there? And when's the last time there was a truly great movie about stage magic? -- and makes them all work. It even puts a former teen star/sex symbol in the leading female role and then shoots (almost) the entire film in sepia tone and with an early 20th century film vocabulary.<br /><br />It shouldn't work, but just like the tricks of Eisenheim the Illusionist, it does, and you find yourself marveling at the results. I don't want to give away too much of the plot -- its twists and "I can't believe he's doing that" element are a great part of the fun -- but Edward Norton portrays Eisenheim, a stage illusionist whom fate and the forbidden love of a duchess (the surprisingly believable Jessica Biel) puts on a collision course with the violent and amoral crown prince of the empire (Rufus Sewell). The movie is a cat and mouse game between the magician and prince, with the wonderful Paul Giamatti (playing a role very unlike his normal nebbishes) caught in the middle.<br /><br />"The Illusionist" gets the strongest possible recommendation for all audiences. (Even the sex scenes are 1920s fade-out tasteful.)</p></br><a href="../users/ABSX5TGEGRH76.html">ABSX5TGEGRH76</a><br/><p>The Illusionist is the story of a young magician in 1900 Vienna.  Eisenheim (Edward Norton) bursts onto the scene and immediately captivates the entire city, gaining a sizable following, which includes the city's Chief Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti) and even the Crown Prince himself (played by Rufus Sewell).  However, Uhl eventually finds that he must arrest the magician for crimes against the empire.  Most of the movie is told by Uhl to Prince Leopold concerning his investigation into Eisenheim's life.<br /><br />Uhl's tale of Eisenheim's introduction to magic is an unbelievable tale of a creepy old wizard who imparts his powers onto the young boy, who is the son of a cabinet maker.  Eisenheim's father builds the furniture for the family of a dutchess.  As with many stories, the high class Dutchess Sophie (played as an adult by Jessica Biel) and the peasant Eisenheim fall for each other.  Eisenheim astounds Sophie with his magical skills, but of course, things end in tragedy.  Eisenheim disappears for years, only to return to Vienna as an adult.  Unbeknownst to him, Sophie is set to wed Prince Leopold.  The pair attend one of Eisenheim's shows after reading rave reviews about his act.  Eisenheim wows the audience by spouting philosophy that ties into his illusions.  While contemplating time, he makes a small orange tree grow within the space of 30 seconds and has butterflies carry a handkerchief across the stage.  When he asks for a volunteer who "does not fear death", Leopold volunteers Sophie.  While Eisenheim immediately recognizes Sophie, she does not remember him at first.  However, the pair rekindle their love affair under the nose of the Prince.<br /><br />Meanwhile, both Uhl and Leopold try to figure out the secrets to the illusions.  While Uhl sees it more as a good challenge, Leopold feels insulted that a man of lesser standing can outwit him.  After Eisenheim humiliates Leopold at a private party, the Prince orders Uhl to shut down the magician.<br /><br />What follows are two series of events by both Eisenheim and Uhl to outwit the other.  Eisenheim wants to escape Vienna with Sophie while Uhl needs to find out how his tricks work in order to arrest him for fraud.  Their paths seem to be parallel, but there may actually be a convergence point for the two rivals.<br /><br />The good story is augmented by strong performances from all the actors, especially Norton and Giamatti.  Norton's soft-spoken approach to the brilliant and patient illusionist perfectly compliments the angry and erratic Leopold, who serves as his rival in the love triangle with Sophie in the middle.  Giamatti's take on the police inspector who is divided between his loyalty to the Prince and his quest to pursue justice is very well done.  Biel is good, but is definitely overshadowed by the two male leads.<br /><br />This is film is seeing a limited release, but it is definitely worth seeing.  You may have to go out of your way, but it is worth it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1U360OMVQRPUB.html">A1U360OMVQRPUB</a><br/><p>THE ILLUSIONIST is a great film filled with enchantment, mystery, and real emotion.  Edward Norton delivers a stunning portrayal of Eisenheim, a magician who has captured the attention of audiences throughout Europe with his masterful illusions and sleight-of-hand.  Jessica Biel co-stars as Sophie, and Paul Giamatti is an absolute delight as Inspector Uhl.<br /><br />The movie is narrated by Inspector Uhl throughout, and that device -- so much like Sherlock Holmes's Watson -- is at once deceptively trustworthy and likeable.  Everything we see and hear is filtered through Uhl's perceptions and own involvement with the principal cast.<br /><br />The movie opens up with Eisenheim performing one of his nightly routines, and Norton is at his seductive best in this opening.  His voice, his mannerisms, and his look drew me in and put me in one of those seats.  I was astonished to watch what he did.<br /><br />But the story only began there.  It quickly segued back into Eisenheim's childhood, and his adolescent romance with Sophie.  According to Uhl's account, Eisenheim was the son of a carpenter who barely made ends meet.  Then one day the boy met a magician who showed him some magic tricks.  Seized by what he had seen, the boy taught himself magic, created tricks, and learned from anyone who knew anything.<br /><br />During that time, he met Sophie.  The children played together, but Sophie's parents found out and took her away, telling the boy he wasn't good enough for her.<br /><br />Now, in Vienna, Eisenheim and Sophie's paths have crossed again, and they find that the love they had for each other has never wavered.  I have to admit, I'm a sucker for a love story, and this one was so well done it just takes the breath way.<br /><br />Part of what makes THE ILLUSIONIST work so well is the period piece costumes and sets.  Even the camera work, with its sepia tones and use of what looks like natural lighting, is beautiful.  The movie made me feel I was back during those times, watching the story unfold.<br /><br />Of course, for a love story like this to work properly, there has to be a villain.  Rufus Sewell play Crown Prince Leopold, the man who desires Sophie's hand in marriage.  Leopold also has a reputation for abusing -- and perhaps murdering -- the women in his life.<br /><br />To tell anything further would be a crime.  THE ILLUSIONIST is an elegant story that has fascinating twists and turns, an elegant sense of pacing, and a story that is timeless.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>Do you enjoy an illusion less when you know what is going on?  The inevitable question when watching a magic trick being performed is "How did they do that?"  From time to time there are those (e.g., Penn & Teller), who will reveal the secret behind the trick, and I have usually found that there is as much enjoyment in learning how they pulled it off as there is in watching the trick being performed in the first place.  Such a concern is at the heart of "The Illusionist," a 2006 film from writer-director Neil Burger ("Interview with an Assassin"), adapted from a short story by Steven Millhauser that draws some inspiration from the infamous Mayerling Incident but clearly goes its own way.<br /><br />We begin in Vienna at the previous turn of the century and a performance by Eisenheim the Illusionist (Edward Norton), at which the title character is arrested by Chief Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti).  Apparently Eisenheim is doing something he should not be doing, and all that is revealed throughout the rest of the film until we come full circle to the opening scene and understand its import.  We then learn that once upon a time the young Eisenheim had been friends with the young Sophie, but now he has grown up to be a master illusionist and the hottest thing in Vienna while she is the Duchess Sophie von Teschen (Jessica Biel), the presumptive fiancee for Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell), thereby setting the stage for a deadly love triangle.<br /><br />The Crown Prince is a paragon of arrogant rationality mixed with an indulgent temper who takes Eisenheim's illusions as an intellectual challenge but stops short of demanding Eisenheim tell how he does it.  Uhl is something of an amateur magician regarding card tricks and slight of hand, so he is also curious about the method behind the magic, but respects the professionalism of the performances, at least until the Crown Prince orders him to do otherwise as Sophie appears to be on the verge of choosing the Illusionist over the Crown Prince, a decision that will have deadly consequences.  Eisenheim's illusions are fascinating, but it is the human drama that matters more here.<br /><br />"The Illusionist" has the virtue of a talented cast in what is essentially an art house film (I am somewhat surprised that they all signed on for such a small and intimate period piece, although Biel clearly is trying to show she can act and following the leads of Norton and Giamatti in proving less is more).  This becomes crucial because I suspect most viewers will know the trick that is being played even if they are not sure how it is being pulled off, so Burger's film gets credit for making us more than willing to go along for the ride.  I have a preference for films that are able to fool me from start to finish, but I ended up rounding up on "The Illusionist" because I applaud the film's final scene and the joy of one character in figuring out how it was done.</p></br><a href="../users/AHIK7BUXFRMT8.html">AHIK7BUXFRMT8</a><br/><p>This movie is powerful and effective and carries the viewer along on a ride that offers fantasy mystery with adventure and romance thrown in as extras. The settings and ambience leave little to be desired and establish an aura of romantic intrigue that compliments the outstanding acting on the part of the entire cast. The background music and surround sound never overpower the dialogue and the overall balance produces a highly effective movie that leaves the viewer wanting more.<br /><br />The characters are masterfully portrayed by the cast and help carry the viewer along as they experience the situations generated by the fascinating story of an individual who rises to the top of his profession as an illusionist but is in love with that unobtainable women who is the object of all he desires.<br /><br />This one is a keeper and is worthy of repeated viewings. I recommend it highly.</p></br><a href="../users/AV6QDP8Q0ONK4.html">AV6QDP8Q0ONK4</a><br/><p>This is a movie I am willing to say, "I own." I had to watch it three times before I caught everything in it, and I still watch it whenever it comes on TV, just in case.<br /><br />Edward Norton plays the illusionist in rather a boring fashion. He is carried by the fantastic acting of Paul Giamatti, as the inspector and by a very strong script. Norton's clever dialouge also helps make the movie, as his words to the inspector have alternate or hidden meanings. Norton attempts to win his childhood sweetheart from the prince as she was torn away from him in his youth due to their class differences. This is a movie you must pay attention to and watch closely in order to get the full effect. No fast forwarding allowed. It was currently in the Wal-Mart $5.00 bin and used ones are even cheaper on Amazon. This one is a keeper.</p></br><a href="../users/A6FIAB28IS79.html">A6FIAB28IS79</a><br/><p>From the very beginnings of cinema, especially with the turn-of-the-century movies of the great French magician, Georges Melies, film has been the ultimate illusion.  It's the amateur spectator who perceives the movies as a "documentation of reality." Orson Welles, for one, knew better, saying "Film is a ribbon of dreams."  And as the illusionist tells his agitated admirers out in the streets: "Everything you've seen is an illusion, a trick. Go home and don't be upset."<br /><br />Accordingly, the first step toward the full appreciation of film is to see every great movie as a "construct" of the director, not as a "record of reality."  The Chief Inspector (Paul Giamatti) is the ideal spectator.  In his first confrontation with the Illusionist, he is allowed to see through Illusionist's illusion to the cause-effect logic behind the deception (identifying the behind-the-back hand that holds an object).  He, like the spectator, has seen a deception exposed, though something in us simultaneously wishes to believe in the magic.  As he tells the Illusionist (Edward Norton) during their final conversation, "I don't know whether you actually bring these people back from the 'other side' or are playing some great trick on us.  But I do know that you're special." Alfred Hitchcock may not have put Gary Grant on the face of Mt. Rushmore, but we nonetheless believe whole-heartedly in the director's sleight of hand even as we appreciate and applaud his inventiveness.<br /><br />But then we reach the final scene of the film and not only witness but participate in an ever-crescendoing epiphany of joy, one which we share with the Chief Inspector, as he (along with the spectator) finally puts the pieces together: he figures out the illusion. It's ironic that many experienced filmgoers can become so savvy about special effects and complain that the "blood didn't look real," etc., yet fail in this instance to be in step with let alone ahead of the Inspector.  Yet the film presents us not with "real" scenery and backgrounds but with painting after painting, fabrication after fabrication. We should have known all along (but the movie wouldn't have been better for it).<br /><br />No matter that the film is an adult "fairy tale" in which everything ends "happily ever after": we believe in it all the more strongly once we're able to discover that it is such a tale.  Or, to invoke a poet (Coleridge) from before the age of cinema, the film celebrates movies as the ultimate "suspension of disbelief."<br /><br />This movie is as smart as they come--made for intelligent viewers who have had their fill of inferior formulaic and "family" film fare.  Not that the film's cleverness and sophistication should limit the size, or mitigate the pleasure, of its audience.  For a change, the spectator has an opportunity to have it both ways: to quote our poet once again, he can emerge a "wiser man"--but without being sadder.<br /><br />[The Blu-Ray version did not strike me as having stunning clarity lacking in the standard version.  But perhaps upon watching the film a 2nd time in Blu-Ray, the spectator who was "tricked" the first time, will be more alert to the fabrications employed in the filmmaking process.]</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>I still get chills when I think about the richly detailed ending to this masterful tale, one that weaves enough chills and thrills into the mix that I was spellbound for days.  In fact, this is one of the better achievements in the year that was 2006, a year that was so rich with film and yet seems so underappreciated (yes, Martin Scorsese finally won his Oscar, but `The Departed' represents some of the more middlebrow, overrated fare the year had to offer).<br /><br />`The Illusionist' is beyond intoxicating.<br /><br />The film tells the story of undying love.  Set in Vienna, the story centers on renowned illusionist Eisenheim.  Growing up poor and essentially banned from seeing the love of his youth, Duchess Sophie, Eisenheim is reunited with his love 15 years later.  By this time she is betrothed to another, a violent tempered Crown Prince with ideas of ruining a nation.  Devising a plan to be together, all seems dangerous yet doable until Sophie turns up dead.<br /><br />Enter Chief Inspector Uhl.<br /><br />Thank goodness for casting directors with their thinking caps on.  Edward Norton is superb as Eisenheim, a man completely withdrawn into his own world yet confidently assertive into the lives of those around him.  He is commanding and unforgettable.  Rufus Sewell (he needs more films like this) is impressively oppressive and spine chillingly creepy and Jessica Biel defines damsel in distress with her soft lips and limber body language that beg to be embraced.  But, for me, this film is all about Paul Giamatti.  For a man who can fall, very easily, into caricature, his performance as Uhl is so astute and technically dominating that I found myself caught up in his every scene.<br /><br />I just loved watching him and Norton interact; like to masters prodding one another along with a slight arrogance that should complete control of the situation at hand.<br /><br />The film is elegantly shot, much like a piece of art, the scenes just melt off the screen and imprint themselves into the minds of the viewer.  It suffered due to being released in the same year as Christopher Nolan's equally outstanding `The Prestige', but one should not forget `The Illusionist'.  They are two very different films, despite a recurring theme (the art of the illusion is not one-note, that is for sure).  One of the best films to be nearly completely forgotten, `The Illusionist' is one you really need to see to believe; believe me!</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>A young boy falls in love with a girl that is way above his social standards along with the art of magic. Although the parents forbid them of seeing each other they cannot be split apart. Until one day they were found together and the boy was sent off. He became a magician and traveled the world. She fell in love with another man, the Crown Prince. The two got engaged but the boy, Eisenheim, finally meets back up with the girl and uses his powers to free her from the royal house in Vienna. This movie is stunning in many aspects. Visually in terms of locations, inside and out, there was great consistency and a nothing seemed strained. The story weaved fluidly through these locations and seemed to make the locales a vital part of the story. Ed Norton and Jessica Biel are superb. The story is fresh and imaginative, very intriguing. Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A3IKBHODOTYYHM.html">A3IKBHODOTYYHM</a><br/><p>One could call it a period film, perhaps a gothic romance, and old-fashioned, and all these would be compliments for The Illusionist, which gives the idea of "great film storytelling" meaning. Director Neil Burger makes The Illusionist more than just a story though, taking on an artistic quality that transcends typical filmmaking. Brilliant atmosphere, authentic characters, a great script, beautiful scenery, and a wonderful music score make this one a gem.<br /><br />One of the film's interesting aspects is just the allegorical quality that emerges. It's much more than a thriller, mystery, or period film about love and magic. Eisenheim's crushed hopes of love in childhood are given a second chance, and this plays into the theme of rekindling lost love, giving the film a parable-like quality.  Illusion-- the subject of what is real and what is not--is a central idea in not only the story's premise, but the film's d&eacute;nouement at the finish. For this reason, you can't take everything at "face value" - supernatural and mystery play a major role in the building of Eisenheim as a character.<br /><br />The characterization and script are superb, and this really keeps the plot's flow at a steady pace. Edward Norton brings the character of Eisenheim to life, giving a mysterious yet charismatic aspect to the role. He makes this idea of creating illusion an art form on the big screen, as he dazzles many in the audience with his shows. It is later on in life when, while doing a show, he meets up with childhood friend and sweetheart Sophie, who is now engaged to the Crown Prince, a villainous man who reportedly abuses his lovers. This meeting sets into motion the conflict between Eisenheim and the Crown Prince, archrivals for Sophie's love. Another important role is that of the Inspector, who is both suspicious and in awe of Eisenheim's illusionary feats, but must ultimately answer to the Crown Prince. While the Crown Prince wants Eisenheim shut down for blasphemy and heresy, the Inspector has no real proof to charge him with.<br /><br />Mythical elements, a great music score, and clever imagination make this feel like we are transported to Vienna circa 1900 to watch the story unfold. There is magic and illusion, and the suspense builds after Eisenheim's shows take on a much darker feel, in which he can reach into the "other world" to find out information about lost loved ones.<br /><br />Over all, there is a great job of filmmaking and storytelling here. There is definitely an art-like quality to The Illusionist, and there is more than meets the eye!</p></br><a href="../users/A2IZIYYCEGOMEU.html">A2IZIYYCEGOMEU</a><br/><p>THE ILLUSIONIST is at once a sumptuously visual fairy tale, a very delectable love story, and a thought-provoking mystery. The Philip Glass score is haunting, and mesmerizing, the colors, fluid, and lush, and the romance is breathtaking, and extroadinarily sensual without relying on bare bodies. Edward Norton is remarkably effective as the master magician Eisenheim, and Jessica Biel is luminous as Duchess Sophie, the love of his life. The story, romance, and mystery unfold with almost dream-like resonance, and is by turns lyrical, exquisitely passionate, and intoxicatingly heartrending.<br /><br />The story takes place in late 19th century Austria. The illusionist, Eisenheim (Norton) returns to his homeland in time to find his childhood sweetheart on the verge of marrying one of the most powerful men in Europe, the meglomaniacal, Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell). The prince brings his bride-to-be, Duchess Sophie (Biel) to the theater that the magician is performing in. Eisenheim recognizes her immediately. Sophie, upon realizing who Eisenheim is, arranges a rather innocent tryst with the magician. Chief Inspector Uhl (the wonderful, Paul Giammati), has, unfortunately had them followed, as part of his duty to the crown, and the real mystery begins.<br /><br />The acting is exceptional, the direction superb, and the music sublime.<br />It is, simply put, one of the most beautiful films I have had the pleasure of seeing in my lifetime.</p></br><a href="../users/A9TG2NFA614S9.html">A9TG2NFA614S9</a><br/><p>"The Illusionist" is an absorbing, well-acted film that is part love story, part mystery, and all engrossing. Edward Norton is the magician who seems to possess supernatural powers. As a kid from the wrong side of the tracks he falls for a patrician girl, Duchess Sophia and thus begins the story.<br /> New York Times film critic A.O. Scott (10/24/08) reviewing the cop movie "Pride and Glory" said it "brings out the full measure of Mr. Norton's vanity, by far his least appealing attribute." In this film Norton plays a charismatic illusionist so one does expect a little more egotism and vanity than one would get, in say a cop.<br />Paul Giamatti is superb as the police inspector under the thumb of Crown Prince Leopold, the magician's rival for the love of Sophia. The setting is 1900 Vienna with the Austro-Hungarian Empire in full swing. The illusionist develops a cult following among the people which irks the Crown Prince.

I can't imagine why so many people can't help but constantly compare this movie to "The Prestige" when with the exception of the magical theme they are nothing alike. First of all, the illusions that are done in this film are absolutely amazing, but yet they reveal nothing to the audience about how they were done. The magic tricks in "The Prestige" pale in comparison to the illusions you saw in this film. Secondly, the premises are totally different. Thirdly, the ending of "The Prestige" is still somewhat of an enigma to me. I guess it's just a matter of the way a person interprets things. I really like movies with endings that surprise you, or make you think about what you just saw, and this ending doesn't disappoint. For me, I think the ending (which I won't reveal) and the illusions are really what sold this film. Of course, Rufus Sewell, Jessica Biel, Paul Giamatti, and the always excellent Edward Norton are amazing as well. With that being said, I'm still not jumping up and down. Again, I think this movie was good...not AWESOME!</p></br><a href="../users/A32XK1ZCXM66OT.html">A32XK1ZCXM66OT</a><br/><p>Now, I really love this film. It was just great!!! Edward Norton and Jessica Biel were fantastic as Eisenheim and Sophie!!! Paul Giamatti was really good as the city's chief inspector. Even Rufus Sewell was good as the ambitious crown prince. It all begins, when Eisenheim and Sophie begin seeing each other when they were children. However, they forced to end it, when Sophie's family fines out. Eisenheim disappers for a couple of years. But, he returns as the most celebrate illusionist in all of  Vienna. After a chance encounter at one of his shows. Eisenhein meets up with Sophie again and learns of her impending marrige to the crown prince. (Who has a very bad reputation of treating his ladies, poorly). He also learns that crown prince isn't too popular with the Vienna government. Eisenheim realizes that not only Sophie could be grave danger, but he must stop a mad man from reaching power. So, Eisenheim faces his greatest challenge ever. To come up with an illusion, that can save Sophie and stop the prince at the same time.</p></br><a href="../users/A9Q28YTLYREO7.html">A9Q28YTLYREO7</a><br/><p>Edward Norton does a Great job in this film. i enjoyed the way this picture unfolds and the many twists and turns of this film. a film like this should have Won some Awards easily.

A great film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DK5AZMXS1QA3.html">A1DK5AZMXS1QA3</a><br/><p>Edward Norton has a habit of acting in movies with twists and turns.  This latest flick from 2006 is no exception, and is probably his best role yet.  Here, he plays the stage magician Eisenheim, a subtle, humble yet cunning artist who encounters his childhood love, Sophie, one evening at a public performance.  Straight away he strives to regain her love and steal her away from the future prince of Austria.  The prince however, is no pushover and has the local police chief in his pocket.  Eisenheim and Sophie concoct a plan that lets them escape, but which also leads to the suicide of the prince.<br /><br />The movie is set in Austria at the beginning of the 20th century.  The story is told in a roundabout way, beginning near the end, going back to the Eisenheim's childhood, and progressing to the climax.  Along the way we see a lot of surprises, including many good magic tricks, even by 21st century standards.  We also see how the calm and cool demeanor of the magician prevails over the haughty and sometimes pushy attitude of the Prince.  The DVD does not come with much extra features; no extra or deleted scenes, no alternate endings, and short interviews.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LH77PBDFEO3F.html">A3LH77PBDFEO3F</a><br/><p>The only things you want to know about "The Illusionist" are these.<br /><br />1. The fun of this movie is the mystery... So don't let anyone give you "spoiler" information.<br /><br />2. Although like every other movie, the fun of watching is in the suspending of disbelief, it is a movie that you have to pay attention to and think about. Watch it with someone, but no fair guessing out loud.<br /><br />3. My review. This is a very visual film; there is a great feeling of time traveling to the setting of the film.

Set in beautiful turn of the century Vienna, this is the story of two young lovers of completely different social standing who meet again after 15 years.  Jessica Biel beautifully plays a duchess betrothed to marry the heir to the Austrian Empire (Rufus Sewell), a cruel man with grand ambition to be emperor and sees Eisenheim the Magician, wonderfully and charmingly played by Edward Norton, as a threat to his authority. Paul Giamatti plays Chief Inspector Uhl who is employed by the Crown Prince to arrest Eisenheim for Fraud.  Uhl is our vehicle in the story who leads us through the mystery behind the scandalous love triangle and the fantastic tricks Eisenheim produces that both fascinates and confounds the plot even further.  In the end, it was worth the journey.<br /><br />Phillip Glass's simple score repeats throughout the movie, enhancing the enigmatic and romantic quality of the film.  This is a must see by all.</p></br><a href="../users/A34D06JL7LC6MU.html">A34D06JL7LC6MU</a><br/><p>The 1st of 2 magician-oriented period pieces to come out in 2006 is "The Illusionist" starring Edward Norton, Jessica Biel, and Paul Giamatti. Compared to the other film "The Prestige" it's not quite as good, but nevertheless...I enjoyed it a lot. Sporting an English accent and a beard, Norton plays Eisenheim the Illusionist who frequently amazes the city of Vienna with his realistic trickery. The movie opens with Inspector Uhl (Giamatti) arresting Eisenheim at one of his performances and the movie flashes back to show us why. One night, during a performance Eisenheim is reunited with a childhood acquaintance in the form of Duchess Sophie (Biel), who is engaged to marry Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell). Despite this, Sophie and Eisenheim begin having an affair, which leads to Sophie being murdered by Leopold. Inspector Uhl, who is caught in the middle of all this, begins investigating the murder while Eisenheim appears to be resurrecting her at his shows. The movie's climax is a "twist" that bares some similarity to the ending of "The Prestige." Both endings are good, but a bit contrived and don't make a whole lot of sense. They do, but it seems too unbelievable. The movie is beautiful and, at times, has the look of an old silent film. All the performances are good, especially Norton and Giamatti. Biel, who is frequently bashed by critics, is actually really good and really hot. Sewell always makes a top-notch villain (except in "The Legend of Zorro") and looks kind of Vincent Gallo-ish. The movie's very entertaining, even if you're not into period pieces where people wear makeup on their chest and write with feathers. The movie is not perfect (more worthy of 4 1/2 stars), but it's one of the best movies I've seen from 2006.<br /><br />GRADE: A-</p></br><a href="../users/AUHG8KSHI529U.html">AUHG8KSHI529U</a><br/><p>This is very romantic movie and is an interesting variant on the old theme of the talented and ambitious commoner and a beautiful princess falling in love, but she is promised to a prince she does not love.  The forces of the Universe keep them apart.  How can their love be fulfilled?  In this case, the ambitious commoner is an illusionist, a magician.<br /><br />The story is told through the eyes of Chief Inspector Uhl (played wonderfully by the always wonderful Paul Giamatti).  The narration comes as he provides a report to Prince Leopold (played with just the right sinister touch by Rufus Sewell) about what is known of the life of Eisenheim the Illusionist (mysteriously and romantically played by Edward Norton).  Although, the narration isn't quite comprehensive because we get to see things that the Inspector does not know.  However, we don't quite notice all this until after the film is over.  The movie keeps us in the moment quite effectively and we pretty much accept what we see as we go along.  This is just like the way we watch magic tricks.  We are looking for the way it is done, but the magician knows we are looking and uses that as part of his ability to divert our attention.<br /><br />It is important that I do not reveal any more about the story because learning the story as we watch it is the whole fun of a Romance such as this.  I will say that I loved the mood of the thing.  The actors are all fine. Jessica Biel as Sophie is the perfect love for Eisenheim.  She is able to be not only desirable, but has a common touch despite her regal carriage.  We can believe she is royal and that she would recognize and desire the noble love of a common cabinetmaker's son over the plans and political machinations a marriage to a prince would offer.<br /><br />Also, the quality of Aaron Johnson's portrayal of Eisenheim and Eleanor Tomlinson as the young Sophie need to be recognized. They have to convince us of the love and connect us to the adult characters.  They do so well that we know these are the same two people as adults without any faltering in belief.<br /><br />The music of Philip Glass is perfect for this film.  It adds just the right emotional connections and helps to tell a story that uses images as much as it uses words.<br /><br />A pretty darn good film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1I7QGUDP043DG.html">A1I7QGUDP043DG</a><br/><p>Kept me guessing until the very end.

A bright cabinet maker's son with a visionary gift for illusion falls in love with a Duchess. Their young love is discovered and the illusionist is forbidden to see Sophie. He travels the world to further develop his magical talents, and when he meets the Duchess again in Vienna, she's the girlfriend of a cruel, egotistical prince. The prince is already rumored to have killed a woman, so for the two lovers to escape, they must come up with a tightly woven plan.

Even Jessica Biel turns in a better than average performance. The sets, costumes, and musical score are all lovely, but the movie lacks something I can't quite put my finger on. The slow pace didn't bother me, but the love story didn't hold much water. The Illusionist is a movie worth seeing, but perhaps it is better suited for a DVD viewing.</p></br><a href="../users/A1SPB225CVTRUU.html">A1SPB225CVTRUU</a><br/><p>I must admit that Edward Norton is the main reason I went to see the Illustionist immediately, because he's by far the most sophisticated actor of his generation, with credits in films like American History X and The 25th Hour to prove such reputation. The Illustration also features a scene-stealing Paul Giamati, and it's obvious that he can play a wide range of characters. I didn't think Jessica Biel was right for her part, because not only does she not look convincing in period wardrobe, she was floundering with a fake accent, and her performance is effortlessly upstaged by Norton and Rufus Sewell. This film does have impressive original score and visual efforts. There is good deal of character development for Norton's childhood character(Eisenheim), but nis travelling experince as a magican in his adulthood was not shown. Norton managed to deliver a performance that is fearless, mysterious and sexy. His romantic plot with Biel's character is under-developed, and it didn't really prepare the audience for the eventual surprise Ending. Giamati has a good amount of screentime to work with and his best moments are the solo scenes later in the film. It's a pretty entertaining for the most part, but it did have some slow-paceness for the first half of the film.</p></br><a href="../users/A10ODC971MDHV8.html">A10ODC971MDHV8</a><br/><p>Adapted from a Steven Millhauser story and set to a lilting score by Philip Glass, Neil Burger's fanciful tale of love and deception in turn-of-the-century Europe is an intriguing and highly entertaining art house gem with Hollywood-style production values. Norton is mystifying, Biel is ravishing, and Giamatti holds it all together with a fine performance as the inspector whose respect for Eisenheim nearly outweighs his official duty. Drenched in sepia tones that evoke the Victorian atmosphere, "The Illusionist" is a murderous bluff that never shows its hand--until the final curtain.</p></br><a href="../users/A11PTCZ2FM2547.html">A11PTCZ2FM2547</a><br/><p>From the opening credits to the soft visuals of the closing scene--all of it augmented wonderfully by Philip Glass's haunting score--THE ILLUSIONIST serves notice it is a film that truly demonstrates the art of entertainment.  Beautiful, enchanting cinematography; a dynamic, gifted cast; exceptional music; a compelling story--all of these components mesh and blend to create a spellbinding (pardon the pun) viewing experience.<br /><br />Edward Norton has never been better; he captures the mystery, the power, the allure, of Eisenheim the Illusionist.  Yet Norton appears in roughly half the film; Paul Giamatti carries the other half as Inspector Uhl, a man torn between his loyalty to his superiors--and his desire to know the truth.  I thought Giamatti was at the pinnacle of his talents in "Cinderalla Man," but I was wrong.  The actor is in rarefied air in this role.  Rufus Sewell is deliciously evil as Crown Prince Leopold, and Jessica Biel is a more than worthy love interest for both the Prince and Eisenheim.<br /><br />I won't belabor the plot, as it's been regurgitated ad infinitum in previous reviews, but I am running out of superlatives.  If you're contemplating purchasing this DVD, I would recommend you do so, as it's worth every penny.  Few movies are visual and artistic treasures; this is one of them.

As with any good magic show, the fun of a picture like this lies in knowing that we're being tricked and trying to figure out how the trick works, rather than having the rug pulled out from under us all of a sudden at the end." LA Times.<br /><br />"The Illusionist" directed by Neil Burger is a powerful film that tells the darkly, romantic story of an "Illusionist", Eisenheim, played by Edward Norton who falls in love as a teenager to Sophie von Teschen, Jesscia Biel. Because Eisenhiem was poor and Sophie from a wealthy upper-class family the union was not to be. We return to the Vienna of the 1900's, Eisenheim is now a famous Illusionist and he finds Sophie is engaged to Crown Prince Leopold, one who is said to be a sadist with his ladies. In the opening scene, Eisenheim is found alone on the stage. The dark, simple, dreary, stage that comes to life when Eisenheim displays his art. This magic is worrisome to Crown Prince Leopold, played by Rufus Sewell and he orders Chief Inspector Uhl, Paul Giamatti, to arrest Eisenheim for fraud. This dark, sinister plot adds to the feel of the film, it is as if the dim light hides a glow. The magic of an orange seed that blooms into a full orange tree bearing fruit. And, the ghosts that fade into view and then disappear. We want it to be so, we want to believe that "all is not what it seems", and then again "is that all there is?"<br /><br />The plot thickens as Sophie faces danger and Eisenheim accuses Crown Prince Leopold of misdeeds. A game of cat and mouse ensues and it is Chief Inspector Uhl who becomes the centrist trying to decide who "The Illusionist" is and what is real. Paul Giamatti steals this movie, in my opinion. He is ruthless and thoughtful and in the end we discover he is also a man of the law. We discover, through Chief Inspector Uhl that this film is a moral story about power and deception.<br /><br />The photography and film are powerful. The old Austria is well represented. The feel of the early 1900's and the era of Prince Joseph Franz and what is to come, spring  to life through the scenes of the richness of Crown Prince Leopold's  surroundings compared to a simple hunting lodge. We are able to feel the darkness and the glow that survives.<br /><br />The soundtrack to "The Illusionist" recorded by Philip Glass is a marvelous score. The music becomes a large part of the movie, telling the story when there is no dialogue. The music is eerie and telling and lovely and matches the darkness that starts to glow.<br /><br />This is a movie to remember, a movie to ruminate -is this real, is that all there is? The wooden necklace that Sophie wears was made by Eisenheim just for Sophie, and is an allegory of this film. It is made in such a way that when opened, becomes a heart with a picture of a young Eisenheim inside.  Think about this- when opened, the truth is revealed. "This is a movie in which the future doesn't exist -- all that matters is the misty golden halo of its own present, a vibrant city standing at the edge of a new century. Blink and it's gone. But at least the glow remains." salon.com<br /><br />Highly Recommended. prisrob 08-21-06</p></br><a href="../users/A3OEECMCM2T4KQ.html">A3OEECMCM2T4KQ</a><br/><p>This is an excellent gothic thriller based on the short story by Steven Millhauser, Eisenheim The Illusionist, set in late 19th century Vienna about the son of a young cabinetmaker who falls in love with a young Viennese aristocrat and is banned from seeing her as he is a basic commoner. As the legend goes about the young lad, he meets a travelling magician on the road who shows him the secrets of illusion, where he sets off to exotic lands to learn the mysteries of life. He returns to Vienna after his travels and opens a show in the great city to astonish not only Vienna's common public with his quasi supernatural illusions, but also Crown Prince Rudolf, son of Emperor Franz Josef who then reigned over the Austrian Hungarian Empire.<br /><br />Originally the short story was written as a political criticism of the Monarchy, based on the scandalous incident, where the bodies of Rudolf and his mistress, Baroness Mary Vetsera were found shot in a Royal hunting lodge, apparently a murder suicide which the Royal family kept from the public for many years.<br /><br />Edward Norton as Eisenheim is understated and brilliant, as the many sleight of hand tricks in the film were actually done by the gifted actor. Norton must have practiced for months to reveal such confidence and skill needed for these types of trick. However, Norton's character portrayed a perfect man of mystery, begging the question, are these mere illusions or does Eisenheim possess supernatural power, controlling matter, energy, space and time itself.<br /><br />The special effects in this film are well done. My favourite illusion in the film, (and they're many) is the Excalibur Sword illusion where Eisenheim borrows Rudolf's sword, somehow magnetizes it to the stage standing straight up, asking the various aristocrats' in the audience to release it from its position. Of course none can release the sword, as they, like the Arthur legend, are not meant to be king. When Prince Rudolf attempts to pull the sword from its stationary stance, he finally does so with great effort; by causing the ruthless Prince some embarrassment, Eisenheim is now a targeted enemy of the Crown.<br /><br />Paul Giamatti as the corrupt Inspector Uhl really shows what a versatile and gifted actor he really is, able to do comedy, tragedy, fantasy...a very impressive performance.<br /><br />The overall look of the film had the atmosphere as if we are viewing a primary historical source, the director using 80 year old editing techniques etc., this was unusual but effective for such a mixed genre film - fantasy, thriller, supernatural thriller and fairy tale romance.<br /><br />When first seeing this film I was spellbound and the ending, a perfect twist, making The Illusionist a perfect example of skilful storytelling.<br /><br />This is an excellent film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1T17LMQABMBN5.html">A1T17LMQABMBN5</a><br/><p>I have been lucky enough to encounter great films that I probably wouldn't have watched had it not been for Netflix.  I watched and fell in love with The Prestige and was curious about a movie that was being compared to it called The Illusionist.  Curious, I gave it a whirl.  First thing I have to say is that the stories of The Illusionist and The Prestige are nothing alike.  Content-wise, they have similar themes and setting (late Victorian, early Edwardian) and then there is the fact that the protagonists of both these films are magicians.  There are also some supernatural or magic realism elements in both films as well.  However, the similarities end there.  This movie centers on Eisenheim (Edward Norton), a famous and fascinating illusionist who is rumored to have supernatural powers and uses them on his magic tricks.  He reunites with his childhood friend Sophie, a young duchess who had planned to run away with him when they were teenagers (Jessica Biel).  They meet again and sparks fly, but Sophie is engaged to the Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell), who is corrupt and sadistic and has the power to get rid of anyone who gets in his way.  Leopold, suspicious of their mutual affection, uses Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti) to find ways to get rid of Eisenheim.  Will Eisenheim and Sophie ever be free to be together?<br /><br />This is such a beautiful film.  The setting of Vienna during the turn of the twentieth century is truly breathtaking.  And the backdrop of magic and supernatural powers is just as eye catching.  This film is a feast for the eyes.  I absolutely love the twist at the end and it left me with a smile on my face.  This is a unique, suspenseful love story not like any other love story.  I have loved Edward Norton since watching him in Fight Club and he is absolutely wonderful here.  Biel and Sewell are also great in their roles.  Paul Giamatti, however, is a true showstopper here next to Norton.  He, like Michael Caine in The Prestige, plays a wonderfully complex character and you want him to be on the good guys' side.  The Illusionist has found a place in my DVD collection.  This is a must-see and a must-own for sure.  I love The Prestige for its dark theme, and I love The Illusionist for its magic and passion.  These films are similar and different at the same time, but one thing is for sure: they are both 100% recommended!</p></br><a href="../users/A3JLOIXFM75QNV.html">A3JLOIXFM75QNV</a><br/><p>I think this one came as a surprise for many people. Going into it, I didnt think anything of it. But it was actually quite good and one of the better films from last year. Edward Norton's character is a skilled magician who once lost a girl that he loved. Years later, they reuinite, and that is where the movie gets exciting. And mysterious. I love the look of the film, the dreary muted colors, the constant sadness in Norton's eyes. It all works. And its all very effective in setting the mood. The ending is completely believable and rewarding. There are no plot holes that I noticed, it all flows very well. All in all, a movie not to be taken seriously, but still a really really good film.</p></br><a href="../users/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ.html">A12X2J7AVZ04IQ</a><br/><p>I don't think I'm familiar with the work of director Neil Burger, but with "The Illusionist", I have been treated to one of the finest period pieces I've ever seen, rife with style, elegance, and a terrific love story, with more than a passing reference to "Romeo & Juliet". I've read the other reviews, and, yes, Philip Glass' score certainly adds to the tension or romance, as applicable (even though he can't get away from the arpeggiated mannerisms and repetition, as in "Koyaanisquatsi"). Both the photography and production design ring true. "The Illusionist" is definitely NOT an action film, though its deliberate pace will not fail to hold you spellbound. The acting is letter-perfect from Edward Norton, Paul Giamatti & Jessica Biel, and Rufus Sewell's bad-guy Prince is one of the very best I've seen in many years. The screenplay is well thought-out, layering the many elements involved in the most precise fashion. I really admire this film very much.

Eisenheim also runs into his childhood sweetheart, Sophie, who is going to become engaged to the Crown Prince.  When Sophie decides to run away with Eisenheim, tragedy ensues and so does the many twists and turns of this marvelously filmed movie.<br /><br />Edward Norton as always shines in his role as Eisenheim, his quiet demeanor belying an uncanny knack for revenge; Paul Giamatti is perfect in his role as Chief Inspector Uhl, the Crown Prince's personal law enforcer who sees exposing Eisenheim as a way to advance his career; Jessica Biel radiates a soft beauty as Sophie; and Rufus Sewell chews up the screen villainously as the despicable Crown Prince.<br /><br />THE ILLUSIONIST is a very entertaining movie, and worth viewing.</p></br><a href="../users/A23GFTVIETX7DS.html">A23GFTVIETX7DS</a><br/><p>Based on Steven Millhauser's short story and set in early 20th century Vienna, The Illusionist captures what art house production companies do best -- stunning cinematography, an inventive tale, emotional resonance, excellent acting, and a cinematic magic that transcends the illusions in the plot itself.  Eisenheim the Illusionist (Edward Norton), the son of a carpenter who trained himself in the art of magic, has created a stir in Vienna when he arrives, seemingly out of nowhere, to charm the city with his spectacular illusions.  When the Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell) volunteers his soon-to-be fiancee as a subject in one of Eisenheim's most terrifying tricks, all starts going very wrong between the two men -- one a mere magician and carpenter's son and the other the most powerful man in the city.<br /><br />Ed Norton exudes mystery and charm as Eisenhem, but his is not the only memorable performance. Jessica Biel as Sophie, the woman of his dreams, is both sensuous and conflicted.  The chemistry between Norton and Biel is palpable, even if it may be too muted for some viewers.  Paul Giamatti's Inspector is likewise complex, both in his loyalty to the Crown Prince and in his personal fascination with Eisenheim.  The best part of this story is not the traditional themes of class division and love but rather the atmosphere of the period combined with dark illusions that suggest a Faustian deal with the devil and death.<br /><br />A first-rate film, The Illusionist is marred only by the occasional predictable plot elements.  Even if you guess the end, as I did, you'll enjoy every minute of watching it unfold.<br /><br />-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann</p></br><a href="../users/A3IXPFN5DU9Z9L.html">A3IXPFN5DU9Z9L</a><br/><p>For the first half of The Illusionist I sat spellbound, swept up in a beautifully realized world of magic and intrigue.  The film's style calls to mind the Albumen prints of the 19th century, with their soft edges and muted sepia tones. It lends the film, which is set in the waning years of the Austro-Hungarian empire, a sense of time and place as well as an atmosphere of mystery. The scenery and costumes certainly convey period authenticity. Old Vienna, with its cobblestone streets and narrow alleyways, grand theaters and resplendent mansions, really comes alive.<br /><br />Even the picturesque quality of the film could not distract me from the glaring flaws in the story. The Illusionist turns on one pivotal event and resolves with a 'twist ending' that turns this pivotal event on its head. This is not a bad thing in and of itself, but the execution, as well as the twist itself, is sub par.<br /><br />Strangely enough, the ending made me despise the character(s) I should have been rooting for, and pity the character(s) who had been served up as villains.<br /><br />The acting, for the most part, is excellent. Norton and Giamatti (who plays an ambitious and principled police detective) deliver good performances. Rufus Sewell steals scenes as the arrogant and conflicted Crown Prince Leopold. Biel's performance doesn't disappoint either, although she is badly miscast as a down-to-earth princess as well as Norton's love interest. She's nice to look at, especially in the bosom enhancing dresses they have her wear, and that was probably intended to be her primary function anyway.<br /><br />Despite its flaws, The Illusionist is a captivating film, at least the first time around. More critical viewers will have no trouble seeing through the pretty packaging on subsequent viewings, so the film will depreciate rapidly. Personally, I think "The Prestige" (which contended against The Illusionist at the box office for "Magic Dollars" ) is a much more solid work, with more staying power.</p></br><a href="../users/ARFCORBCTKX1J.html">ARFCORBCTKX1J</a><br/><p>Warning... This review doesn't reveal the ending. But it drops a big hint.<br /><br />"The Illusionist" is a wonderful exercise in the use of CGI and digital processing to create a film with a unique visual style. But as a drama with a surprise ending, it's less than satisfactory.<br /><br />The problem is with dialog that telegraphs the ending. When Eisenheim asks Sophie if she wishes to run away with him, she replies that Leopold will hunt them down and kill them, no matter where they go. Given that they're obviously intelligent people, and they understand exactly how Leopold will react, the ending is all too predictable.<br /><br />The acting and directing are nothing if not exquisite, fully matching the magnificent art direction and scenes of period Vienna. Note how when Inspector Uhl feels the hands of Sophie's corpse to see if she really is dead, the director does nothing to draw our attention to it. He assumes the audience is paying attention, and is intelligent enough not to need having Uhl's actions explained.<br /><br />I suspect the implicit anti-Semitism of Leopold's hatred of Eisenheim (who's Jewish) and the line "Make us disappear!" anticipate the anguish of the millions of Jews who would be exterminated 40 years later. But the film doesn't acknowledge or develop these implications.<br /><br />By the way, the orange-tree illusion was created by the French illusionist Robert Houdin, the magician Houdini named himself after.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NLZVP501JM5Z.html">A1NLZVP501JM5Z</a><br/><p>This film came out before another magic film which I believe to be one of the best of the year, The Prestige.  That movie seemed to have everything that this movie didn't.  Not to say that this isn't a good movie because it is.  All I'm saying is that I guessed much of the plot for The Illusionist while The Prestige kept me off guard and amazed.  Both movies are good and should be rented or bought(PRESTIGE!) ahem.  Sorry.  I just felt like comparing the two movies, but since this is a review for The Illusionist, I'll start the review.<br /><br />Most of the actors/actresses are great.  Paul Giamatti is one of my favorites and once again gives a great performance.  Edward Norton also gives a fabulous performance along with Rufus Sewell.  But then there is Biel.  Ick.  .  Ugh.  Wince.  I am of course refering to her performance.  She looks great, but she just was in over her head in this one.  I think my local movie critic(Chris Hewitt, St. Paul, Pioneer Press) put it best.  He said, "Paul Giamatti and Edward Norton deliver great performances, the only problem is that Jessica Biel occasionaly wanders in."  Thats how it is.  A+ for Paul and Norton.  A failing grade for Biel.<br /><br />The Direction was very good, I really disliked the ending which lacked magic.  It wasn't a huge surprise and they never told us how the final trick was done.  I was left going "Oh.  Thats it?"  I did like the dark tones and colors and grainyish quality.<br /><br />Overall this was a movie that had some mild disappointment and some mild surprise.  Not a great movie, but not bad by any means.  I suggest you rent this then BUY The Prestige.  Of course you might like this more, but my point is at least see both of this films.  Because both will have you believe in magic......</p></br><a href="../users/A2F3SXHT6RBV81.html">A2F3SXHT6RBV81</a><br/><p>Edward Norton was really quite something as the illusionist in Vienna at the turn of the century (200 years ago).  Along the vein of today's David Copperfield, he was master at making things and people appear and disappear.  He looked the part of Eisenheim and had attracted a devoted following as he developed seemingly supernatural powers.  He'd acquired an eloquent old theatre in which to entertain his fans and, by the way, he looked the part in every way -- at first.<br /><br />It was all a trick, an illusion, as he delved into the dark arts whereby fate could just be chance.  Jessica Biel made a good Hungarian princess, a bit dumb.  After his childhood love re-enters his life, he seems to fall apart.  She's been claimed by the crown prince of Austria who is planning to overthrow his father.  Telling everything was out of this question at this point, but Sophie knew his secret.  She had dreamed about E. for fifteen years and hoped to see him again (now, you have, he'd said).  "Why should you care what happens to me now -- why?"  His sincere reply: "my heart couldn't let go of you."  He was sure that he had charmed her again.<br /><br />Then, we are led on a road of treachery, murder, abuse, coverup -- or is it all an illusion.  You must see the ending and figure it out for yourself.  He was believeable as he expanded his repertorie to manifestations and spiritualism in his attempts to contact the dead with the use of mirrors.  He was surrounded by fools; I think I am going to enjoy this.  He loses his looks of professionalism and appeared to disappear, or did he?  As an ordinary passenger on the night train, he looked very ordinary, not dapper at all in his disguise.  The crown prince could not face the music and was trapped because of his mean temperament.  He got what he asked for.  Who was betrayed?  What does it mean to die?  It's not that easy; he couldn't let her go -- neither of them could or would.  My apologies, of course,  You never did understand what exactly had happened.  I couldn't figure out why.  How did he manifest those blue butterflies, what was their significance.  The costumes and the expert acting made this movie a classic.  You've got to see it to believe it.</p></br><a href="../users/A39IY0JU5JI69G.html">A39IY0JU5JI69G</a><br/><p>This movie succeeds on every level.  It is beautifully filmed in an interesting era.  The subject matter is intriguing.  The script is smart.  It mixes magic with more magic. I loved the ending and was totally surprised and delighted by it.  The acting was superb---Edward Norton surely deserves an Oscar nomination for it.  I left the theater with a smile in my heart.</p></br><a href="../users/A1SCD2NYTIAQTY.html">A1SCD2NYTIAQTY</a><br/><p>Although not a movie I would, under normal circumstances, choose to sit down and watch, "The Illusionist" was one that I surprisingly enjoyed a hell of a lot. Filmed in sepia to reflect the early 1900's period that the story is set in, the overall feel and aura of the film was hanutingly excellent.<br /><br />The basic plot is that Edward Abrahamovich, (Eisenheim), and the Sophie, Countess von Techen cannot be together due to differences in family ranking. Eisenheim is not in the "in crowd". He vanishes and years later turns up in Venice, sporting a new name, a new profession and whole lot of cool. With illusions that defy explanation, he causes a stir, especially when he gets up the nose of the Emperor's son, Leopold, who is due to marry the same Countess von Techen from years before. Soon Eisenheim and Sophie are lovers and...well, see the film.<br /><br />Edward Norton plays a very calm and collected, (and quite cool), Eisenheim. Paul Giamatti was a particular surprise, giving a great performance as Leopold's toady, Inspector Uhl. All in all, the movie was very well acted, and all the actors and actresses set this film a cut above average.<br /><br />Although a romance, I thoroughly enjoyed the spectacle that this movie presented. In some ways, it almost drew one into the atmosphere of the film, and you could almost feel the wind of the raven's wings as Eisenheim throws his cloth out over the audience.<br /><br />Setting it in the early 20th century, filming it in sepia, and centering the plot on an illusionist all serve to the make the film a true work of art. Even if you are not a romance movie goer by nature, I would suggest at least giving this one a chance. Both creepy and endearing in feel, it is an intriguing movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R2YB0WTTB0IJ.html">A3R2YB0WTTB0IJ</a><br/><p>***** 2006. Adapted from a Steven Millhauser short story, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000K7VHQ4">The Illusionist (Widescreen Edition)</a> was written and directed by Neil Burger. It's an outstanding love story in the Vienna of the early XXth century. Everything is perfect in this film: the production design, the actors, the Philip Glass musical score and the screenplay. Just when you thought Christopher Nolan's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LC55F2">The Prestige</a> was the ultimate movie about magic, then came Neil Burger's masterpiece. What a wonderful year for movie lovers !</p></br><a href="../users/A2PBV1899CX3TE.html">A2PBV1899CX3TE</a><br/><p>The movie evoked turn of the century Vienna, all sepia toned and mist shrouded. Edward Norton plays a charasmatic magician who forms a childhood bond with a young duchess. Paul Giamatti plays a police inspector, who starts off cynical and slimey, but becomes more sympathetic towards the end. Jessica Biel plays the duchess, and she is lovely to behold. She looks gorgeous, but even more attractive is a certain something, charm, charisma, warmth, she just seems like she would be very easy to fall in love with. The magical effects are very well done, and you are never sure if they are meant to be just clever tricks, or if the Illusionist is a mystic, able to conjure up ghosts from the other side... Rufus Sewell plays the evil prince, and he is a splendid villain, looking very much the dashing, yet evil prince, like something dreamed up by the Bronte sisters.</p></br><a href="../users/AVOCNUFOXUCA6.html">AVOCNUFOXUCA6</a><br/><p>I watched this movie on an airplane, without high hopes; airline films are often not the best, and having been subjected to nonstop junk on the outward leg, expected the same on the way back.  But I was happily surprised by "The Illusionist."<br /><br />The performances are uniformly excellent.  The characters are well-drawn by the script, and the actors bring out more than one dimension - particularly Giamatti.  I didn't care for the movie "Sideways," but the plus side of that movie is that it got Giamatti some roles that he really deserved and could play well.  The script generally avoids falling into cliche, and sets the movie in a period and location that we haven't seen much of before.  The cinematography is wonderful, having a color theme that doesn't go over the top, and that evokes an old film in parts (frames that go just a little too fast, or are just out of focus for a second).<br /><br />In places, the movie drags a little, but not so much as to knock it down a star.  "The Illusionist" is at least worth a rent.</p></br><a href="../users/A39IBJB2PBVC7I.html">A39IBJB2PBVC7I</a><br/><p>The Illusionist (horrible title!) is a wonderful movie to watch, which makes sense, because it's all about visual illusion, and nobody does visual illusion quite like Hollywood.  From the theatre to the palace, the costumes to the cobblestone streets, carriages, and buildings, the sense of place is compelling - excellent cinematography.  (Norton seems unsure about what sort of accent he is trying to pull off, but for the most part, even the diction and affect of the actors contribute.)<br /><br />The basic story, to say nothing of the dialogue! - is pretty boilerplate, a boy meets girl set-up with a royal court intrigue backdrop.  That's okay because the protagonists are likeable and the villain is really nasty - Giamatti is excellent as the guy in the middle.  Where the film gets into trouble is with its depiction of magic.  Norton - a terrific actor who struggles with unremarkable looks - has been made up well, he's almost dashing.  At times, when he is conjuring, Norton almost seems to have that Svengali dark power of magic, which can be turned to evil purposes at will.<br /><br />I was reminded of a much better movie, The Magician, by Ingmar Bergman.  It was clear in that film that magic, and magicians, emanated from a dark place and were not to be trifled with.  Our Ed, by contrast, has wandered the globe living for years in the Orient and still retains his affable, kid next-door persona - summoning spirits for stunned audiences as casually as you or I would use the phone to summon pizza delivered to our door.  This is one of many ways this picture cheats you.  Is he merely an entertainer, or is there sinister purpose to his shows?  Maybe he just likes being on stage.<br /><br />Bergman's The Magician ends with a chirpy twist which seems to belie everything that came before it, the deus ex machina for which magicians are famous.  It's a deliberate sleight of hand.  The ending of The Illusionist also comes with a twist, but it fails.  Instead of running in contrast to what's come before, it is designed to explain and justify "the show."  In this regard it is incredibly cheap and flabby - like watching playing cards fall from a magician's sleeve as bunnies hop around the stage.  Jessica Biel is exquisite, Rufus Sewell is an excellent baddy, and the antler hallway alone is worth the price of admission.  But don't be tricked into thinking it's anything more than what it is - a nice show.</p></br><a href="../users/A2M597GCCE1N2S.html">A2M597GCCE1N2S</a><br/><p>I must admit I had no idea what to expect when I watched this movie, but when it was over I was very impressed with what I saw. This is one movie that will make you question just what is really a trick, and what has happened in the story itself.<br /><br />The Illusionist tells the story about a young man simply named Eisenheim [Edward Norton] who leaves audiences of his shows in total amazement and awe at his spellbinding tricks and illusions in many shows in Vienna. His shows are so well acclaimed that he sparks the interest of the crown prince, Leopold [Rufus Sewell] and his fiance. [Jessica Biel]<br /><br />At first the crown prince believes that Eisenhiem is no threat, but after his fiance and Eisenheim realize that they were once childhood friends [maybe even more] Leopold believes his marriage is in danger. Paul Giamatti costars as the city's chief inspector who at first believes Eisenheim is a great magician who is there just to entertain, but starts to question his own judgement on the magician, especially after a terrible crime is committed and he has to judge between what the facts are and what he truly believes is the truth.<br /><br />This is a dark film through most of the 109 minutes of this film, in more ways than one. Not only do the characters talk in hushed and toned down voices through most of this movie, but a lot of the magic acts take place in a darkly lit theater, with candlelight and hushed voices adding to the dramatic effect of one of Eisenheim's acts. There are also a few clues to the past of Eisenheim as a boy, which are just as interesting and curious as one of his fantastic acts, such as how he really became a magician in the first place.<br /><br />As for the ending, I will not give it away, but I will say I was absolutely caught off guard with how it ended. Perhaps you will be able to see what I did not, but maybe thats because i absolutely suck at predicting endings of movies, its a big weakness for me!<br /><br />There are also a couple of reviews below mine that rip into this movie and how the characters cannot act with one another...I disagree with that 100%. Edward Norton and Paul Giamatti are great as always, I dont think there is anyone who can deny Norton as a great actor [just look at Fight Club and American History X] as for Paul Giamatti, Cinderella Man anyone? Jessica Biel also passes with her performance, and Leopold was good too, although I found his outbursts of anger a little laughable [just my opinion]<br /><br />Extras on this DVD include:<br /><br />Feature Audio Commentary by the director Neil Burger<br /><br />The Making of the Illusionist<br /><br />and a segment with Jessica Biel who talks about the movie herself.<br /><br />This is a great movie to see at least once, it has drama, even humor, a great cast of actors and actresses, and an ending that will show you as it says on the DVD cover...Nothing is what it seems.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AOKQCH0YBZDS.html">A3AOKQCH0YBZDS</a><br/><p>The Power of Love & the Mystery of Illusion Are Just Two Things That Make This a Great Film! I'd say the screenplay & storyline are fairly original to this movie as well. So many movies out there today are remakes of older films or so similar to other films that have been made, which makes "The Illusionist" refreshing. It is also refreshing to watch a movie that isn't based on using excessive violence, foul language, sex/nudity, or the same old silly slapstick that has become the norm for so many movies today.<br /><br />The acting, costuming, and cinematography are also great in this movie too. "The Illusionist" is a well-rounded, must see movie!</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZBOBV9H1HDV.html">A3LZBOBV9H1HDV</a><br/><p>"The Illusionist" is brilliant! The film brought to you from the producers of "Crash" (2005) & "Sideways" (2004). This is one of the best movies of the year and of the summer! The directing and screenplay (based on the short story Eisenheim the Illusionist by Steven Millhauser) by Neil Burger (whose first film was an cinema verite drama called "Interview With The Assassin" (2002), which he also wrote the screenplay to) is brilliant! Edward Norton (a two-time Oscar nominee for his work as Aaron Stampler in "Primal Fear" (1996) & Derek Vineyard in "American History X" (1998) & one of the best actors of our generation) gives the best performance of his career as Eisenheim the Illusionist (who was also coached by James Freedman). Paul Giamatti (recently Oscar-nominated for his performance as Joe Gould in "Cinderella Man" (2005) & was also one of Norton's classmates at Yale) equals his classmate with an impressive performance as Chief Inspector Uhl. Jessica Biel gives a great performance as Sophie, childhood friend and love of Eisenheim's. Rufus Sewell gives a deliciously excellent performance as the Crown Prince Leopold, Sophie's fiancee-to-be. The music by Philip Glass (another two-time Oscar nominee for his work on "The Hours" (2002) & "Kundun" (1997) is excellent! The cinematography by Dick Pope (who also did the cinematography to the upcoming "Man Of The Year" (2006) is excellent! The film editing by Naomi Geraghty (who also film edited "Hotel Rwanda" (2004) & "In America" (2003) is excellent!

The production design by Ondrej Nekvasil is excellent! The set decoration by Petra Habova is excellent! The costume design by Ngila Dickson (who also did the costume design to the "Lord Of The Rings" trilogy, was Oscar-nominated for her work on the first "Lord Of The Rings" & won for her on the third "Lord Of The Rings", "Heavenly Creatures" (1994), "The Last Samurai" (2003), was Oscar-nominated for her work, "Without A Paddle" (2004), and the upcoming "Blood Diamond" (2006) is excellent!

The magician performs on stage, the nobleman hosts social events; both are platforms for waging a war of ideas.<br /><br />At its heart, the Illusionist is about two men fighting for a woman's heart.  Eisenheim (Edward Norton, intense as ever), is a long lost childhood friend of the Duchess Sophie (Jessica Beil, looking positively radiant).  As the mere son of a carpenter, he is not of the appropriate social status to romance the young Duchess, and thus the two are separated on pain of imprisonment.  Eisenheim leaves for the Orient; when he returns, he has a few tricks up his sleeve.<br /><br />The Crown Prince Leopold (played by Rufus Sewell with bristling rage) is a brutish man with high ambitions.  He plans to supplant his father and take the throne as Emperor of Austria.  Sophie represents a political alliance of convenience, and her pending marriage to Leopold is a demand, not a request.  As Sophie states, "He will never leave us alone until we are both dead." This gives Eisenheim an idea.<br /><br />Investigating the case is Chief Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti), embodying the everyman who's basically a decent soul, but caged by his career.  Living on the periphery of Leopold's shadow, Uhl has little choice but to follow the Prince's doomed bid for power.<br /><br />Thus the stage is set for a battle of hearts and minds, prince vs. performer, as both use their respective soapboxes to espouse their ideologies.  Upon the murder of the Duchess, Eisenheim shifts his magic acts from prestidigitation to spiritualism, summoning spirits of the dead before a live audience.  The amazing spirits he summons are so convincing that Eisenheim practically creates a new religion.<br /><br />The Illusionist is filmed in sepia tones, befitting a movie set in the 18th-century.  Cut scenes squint in and out of focus like old silent movies.  Phillip Glass' usually repetitive music is appropriate as a backdrop to Vienna, neither intrusive or cloying.<br /><br />By far the most impressive of The Illusionist's visual effects are the magic tricks themselves.  Through judicious use of computer graphics, Eisenheim causes an orange tree to grow before our eyes, butterflies to carry handkerchiefs over the audience's head, and ghosts to walk right through people.  This is most assuredly not what the magic tricks would have really looked like in the 18th century, but director Neil Burger has a different goal: he wants us to experience Eisenheim's magic as if WE were the audience, so the special effects are ratcheted up to fool modern audiences.  In essence, it's an illusion about an illusion. It works perfectly.<br /><br />The actors really earn their keep.  Norton is amazing as Eisenheim, alternately distant and focused, passionate and reserved.  He suffers with painful, palpable longing for the Duchess.  Biel, relegated to elfin, punk roles in the past, comes into her own here as a desperate, trapped woman resigned to her gilded cage.  And then there's Giamatti, who grumbles, glares, and huffs like every good inspector should.  He also adds a much-needed dose of humor.<br /><br />I'm not exactly sure where the film was being advertised, but it must have been aiming at a very specific demographic. When my wife and I went to see The Illusionist, we were surprised that the average age group of our fellow moviegoers was 60 and up.  At one point, the inspector speaks an expletive that was obviously edited out; this movie has been sanitized for grandmas everywhere. Fortunately, the change isn't detrimental to the movie.<br /><br />The conclusion isn't much of a surprise for attentive moviegoers.  In fact, I would have taken points off for Burger hitting us over the head with a hammer to explain what happened...except that the elderly couple behind us had difficulty distinguishing Norton from Giamatti.  They asked everyone in earshot what the big twist was. They kept asking as we left the theater...and even the restroom.<br /><br />Overall, The Illusionist is a tight film of big ideas wrapped in the Victorian veneer of the old world.  Just like the stagecraft Eisenheim performs, The Illusionist proves that sometimes, perception really is reality.</p></br><a href="../users/A39AWL2FKWDFK6.html">A39AWL2FKWDFK6</a><br/><p>Neil Burger does an outstanding job in writing and directing an engrossing, moody period piece taking place in turn of the 20th century Vienna.  The movie is filmed in the picturesque baroque settings of the Czech Republic.<br /><br />Edward Norton, a talented young actor who has compiled an impressive resume of excellent cinematic performances plays Eisenheim a highly skillful illusionist.  The lowly son of a cabinetmaker Norton was the childhood sweetheart of the aristocratic Duchess Sophie.  He was banished to quash this tabooed relationship.<br /><br />Fifteen years later he triumphantly returns to Vienna as a well respected magician.  His talents come to the attention of Chief Inspector Uhl played by the terrific Paul Giamatti in a role that might finally garner him a well deserved Oscar.  Uhl, himself an amateur magician is checking Norton out in anticipation of the attendance of Crown Prince Leopold to a performance.  The sinister and truculent crown prince played nicely by Rufus Sewell is ironically betrothed to Norton's old flame Sophie.<br /><br />When Norton and Sophie played by Jessica Biel reunite the sparks again begin to fly and they resume a relationship.  Giamatti, under the influence of the crown prince, has been following Sophie and reports back to him of their affair.<br /><br />Sewell in a murderous, jealous rage manhandles Biel and she is found the next day in the woods dead, a result of blood loss from a sword slash.  Leopold is implicated but Giamatti throws another man in jail for the crime, even though he has suspicions about the crown prince.<br /><br />Eisenheim is convinced that Leopold killed his beloved Sophie and changes his act and now begins to bring spirits back from the dead.  Everything seems cut and dry but is all as it seems?<br /><br />Overall the film is certainly one of the best to come along this season.  It concludes with a twist almost of the magnitude of the incredibly great "The Usual Suspects".</p></br><a href="../users/A168VXSISJWQN9.html">A168VXSISJWQN9</a><br/><p>This is a well-crafted, well-acted subtle little movie which makes some very interesting observations on society, contains an intriguing mystery and features a wonderful performance from one of my favorite actors, Paul Giamatti.<br /><br />Set in Vienna (but actually filmed in and around Prague) in 1900, the movie is about a couple of childhood friends from very different social classes- the son of a cabinet-maker and Sophie, a royal princess. Their friendship is forcibly ended by the princess's family, but 15 years later the boy, now a man, reappears as an illusionist. They meet again and realize that they are in love; but how to separate themselves from the inevitable backlash against such a misalliance?<br /><br />The movie is told from the perspective of Inspector Uhl (Giamatti), a policeman responsible for security in the royal household. He reports to Crown Prince Leopold (the splendidly menacing Rufus Sewell), heir to the throne and a jealous and violent man, who wishes to marry Princess Sophie (Jessica Biel). When Eisenheim the illusionist (Edward Norton) delivers a number of barely veiled insults to the Crown Prince, Uhl is ordered to get rid of him. There follows a battle of wits between Uhl and Eisenheim, in which Uhl holds all the cards but Eisenheim tries to manipulate how they are played.<br /><br />The movie succeeds on many levels. It's atmospheric and gives the feel of a period piece; it points out the class distinctions of the time when it was literally possible for the Crown Prince to get away with murder; it takes a subtle dig at those who are obsessed by the supernatural and believe they are seeing something paranormal even when assured it is an illusion; the illusions are realistic and actually could have been performed at the time; and it uses misdirection as cleverly as Eisenheim himself. Interestingly, some of the interior scenes were filmed at the home of Arch-Duke Ferdinand of Sarajevo, whose assassination was the flashpoint for the start of World War One.<br /><br />The mistake the movie could have made, but happily didn't, is to make Uhl an unworthy opponent for Eisenheim. Instead, the two men respect each other and Eisenheim knows that nothing less than his best will fool the inspector. Moreover, Uhl is not an unlikeable man and throughout the film he faces an internal battle between his responsibilities and his personal inclinations. The final scene, in which Inspector Uhl mentally reviews all the facts and clues, is a brilliant piece of acting by Giamatti and leaves us thoroughly uplifted.<br /><br />Although a number of reviews compare this movie to 'The Prestige', which came out at about the same time, the movies are quite unlike each other except superficially- they both involve stage illusionists and are set at the end of the 19th century. This is the smaller, more intimate film, but just as effective in its own way. Enjoy them both.</p></br><a href="../users/ANGH6401L9Y0T.html">ANGH6401L9Y0T</a><br/><p>Brilliant! I challenge you to watch this movie just once, all the way through, not stopping and backing up to check out details, and figure out all the ways in which the illusions were created. I'm going to have to watch it another couple of times myself.<br /><br />Quite apart from the absolutely brilliant plot, the actors and actresses, the costumes, the settings, all are just wonderful.<br /><br />Edward Norton plays illusionist Eisenheim, and Jessica Biel plays the aristocratic young Sofia, whom he had loved as a child. But she was a titled lady, and he was the son of a cabinet-maker who made furniture for her family. They were forcibly separated, but not before he gave her a locket which opened in a secret way to reveal a picture of him. Keep your eye on that locket.<br /><br />The Crown Prince comes to one of Eisenheim's performances, and when the illusionist calls for a volunteer who "is not afraid of death," the prince volunteers Sofia. She recognizes Eisenheim as the young man she once loved, but does not reveal this to the audience. He asks "Have we ever met?" as part of the act, and she says no. Then he does his illusion of standing her in front of a mirror, the image in the mirror is murdered, but she is OK. Great show!<br /><br />Sofia is supposed to marry Crown Prince Leopold, whom she does not love. But Leopold has revealed some of his darkest secrets to her, so if she will not marry him, she must die.<br /><br />From there, I refuse to give away anything. You will have too much fun working it out. Now I think I'll go watch it again and see if I can add it all up.</p></br><a href="../users/A3USRUCHAOC3MT.html">A3USRUCHAOC3MT</a><br/><p>If you want an escape from reality that is enjoyable and mentally stimulating, you're looking at the right video.<br /><br />The setting dealing with turn-of-the-century illusionists lead to the inevitable comparison between this and "The Prestige." Aside from that, it's like comparing apples with oranges, Moby Dick with Jaws, fruit salad with a hot fudge sundae. These two movies have two different purposes and two different world views. Both succeeded equally well at what they aimed at accomplishing.<br /><br />I recently read "Saving Leonardo" by Nancy Pearcey, where she follows two differing philosophical trends: the Enlightenment tradition and the Romanitic tradition. "The Illusionist" fits clearly into the Romantic setting. The rational explanation of what is going on is not important. The protagonist left the explanation for a trick for the antagoist (a superb job by Paul Giamiati), but the audience never knows how plausible that is. Some of the effects in fact cross into the spiritual/magical realm.<br /><br />The philosophy also reveals itself in the story telling. This movie has a very identifiable hero, villain, love-interest, and antagonist. The purpose of this movie is to be an old-fashioned romantic story, without any real agenda than being an enjoyable couple of hours. The only complaints is that this reflects a modern view of morality, where there's no problem with the hero having sex with the love interest without being married to her, as well as some occultish tones.<br /><br />"The Prestige" is much more realistic than the "Illusionist", and I personally consider it to be the better movie. It made you think more. It also was darker and more depressing. "The Illusionist" was more enjoyable.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EOYN87MMNHL1.html">A3EOYN87MMNHL1</a><br/><p>Oh, what an excellent little film.

We are kept spellbound until the final illusion.  Edward Norton is mysterious and hypnotizing as the illusionist, Eisenhiem.  The political climate of Vienna and the eccentricities of Crown Prince Leopold rachet up the intrigue.  This is another artist's movie.  If you are an artist you will not be disappointed.

It's not particularly deep - nor is it necessarily all that brilliant. But, like any good conjurer's trick, this film is entertaining. The high points are the production design and the acting. Edward Norton and Paul Giamatti speak in weirdly soft tones for much of the film, but they manage to convey a wide range of emotions anyway, and both of them play very compelling characters. I had no problem with Jessica Biel, either, perhaps because I never saw her "teen" movies and I'm not saddled with the preconception that she's a lightweight. Let me put it this way; she's certainly beautiful enough that I understand Norton's obsession with her!<br /><br />The script is simple and a bit fanciful. The plot twists are not too hard to predict, if you really want to predict them. But so what? I enjoyed the movie even though I suspected what the ending would probably be. And, unlike many commentators on this site, I didn't feel "superior" to the film simply because I figured out the mystery. Sometimes it's fun to watch even a predictable plot unfold.<br /><br />I'm actually glad that Norton made a film like this, because I usually associate him with darker, more downbeat fare. "The Illusionist" is a very pleasant movie by his standards - like a dreamy sort of fairy tale. I enjoyed seeing him in something that's so much fun. If you insist on over-thinking this film, I'm sure you'll figure out - and start to resent - all of its tricks. You'll see the wires, so to speak. As for me...I never look for the wires. I just let myself be carried along for the ride.</p></br><a href="../users/A17FLA8HQOFVIG.html">A17FLA8HQOFVIG</a><br/><p>I was unprepared for the pleasant surprise of this film.  But then again, I should have known that any film with Ed Norton and Paul Giamatti would be something special.  I've been following the careers of both of these actors, and they have always chosen excellent roles.  I had never seen Jessica Biel before, but she also showed up as an imposing film presence.<br /><br />The film is set in Vienna around the turn of the 20th century.  There's a dreamy quality about it, and the gaslight and candlelight feels absolutely authentic.  Edward Norton and Jessica Biel are childhood sweethearts.  But, alas, she is royalty and he is the son of a carpenter.  They are forced to separate and he travels the world for 15 years.  When he comes back to Vienna, he is "The Illusionist" and we meet him onstage as he impresses his audience.  His fame grows.  And soon the crown prince wants to see his show.  Jessica Biel is now the crown prince's fianc&eacute;.  But as soon as she participates in a trick with the illusionist, she recognizes him from her childhood.  The scene is now set for romance and intrigue.<br /><br />Paul Giamatti is cast as a police inspector.  He is the glue that holds the story together as we view the action through his eyes.  He is perfectly cast in the role.  He too, is lowly born, but the wicked crown prince, who is likely to fly into a rage when challenged, holds the key to elevating him to a much high position in court.  But first, the police inspector must prove his worth.<br /><br />A murder investigation is central to the plot.  And we all know that The Illusionist knows more than he is letting on.  When we look into Edward Norton's eyes, we know he is hiding something.  But we can't tell what it is.  He is the master of every scene.  I couldn't take my eyes off him.  Many of his scenes are onstage.  And we know they are illusions.  But how does he do it?<br /><br />Wisely, the filmmakers kept away from computer graphics.  All the illusions seem real.  And we, the film audience, experience them the same way an audience in 1900 would have.  I was absolutely caught up in the plot and the mystery.  I knew there was a secret and my mind was constantly trying to figure it all out.<br /><br />And then, in the very last minute of the film, it all becomes clear.  Fascinating.  Well done.  And thrilling.<br /><br />I loved this film.  Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UNMXBJSVIXFB.html">A2UNMXBJSVIXFB</a><br/><p>Movie - 4.5<br /><br />The Illusionist is something of an oddity. Though it may have gotten lost in the shadow of Christopher Nolan's The Prestige and coincidentally center around the same theme of magic, the two really don't share much else in common. Nolan's film is a calculated and theatrically-charged mystery/thriller, while Burger's is more a romantic drama with a big twist at the end. Overall, I have to say I was pleasantly surprised, regardless of the trivial comparative controversy between the two. Several reasons I like this film are because of its cast, simplicity, and of course that big twist ending. Edward Norton plays the role of a regular guy in love with royalty (Jessica Biel) who, despite her being "socially engaged" to a very villainous prince (played brilliantly by Rufus Sewell), loves him back just as much. Within these events, Paul Giamatti plays the role of an up and coming candidate for police commissioner under the Prince's new regime, but is ultimately a man caught between the future of his reputation and doing what he feels is right. The simplicity of the narrative lies in its characters, their emotions, and a very fine script to bring it all about. It's apparent the two lovers really feel for each other, that the villain truly is a villain, and that somewhere in-between the one man watching all of this unfold is genuinely conflicted with what he should do. With that being said, the film is quite character-driven and builds upon some very basic emotions to tell its story. As we're introduced to them from the beginning of their relationships as children and up to the present, it makes for a refreshing tale of love, loyalty, and longevity. By film's end, I was nearly disappointed with how things were turning out. But the last 90 seconds literally transforms the movie into, what I thought was, a dazzling and ingenious turn of events that made all 100 minutes prior worth the title's namesake.<br /><br />Video - 4.0<br /><br />The cinematography for this film is something of a unique situation. It's not flashy or bright by any means, but instead uses (or so I hear) a sepia tone lens, which explains the heavy amounts of darkened browns, tans, and deep, deep blacks. Personally, I like how it fits with that particular time period and setting. It doesn't make much for Blu-ray showcasing, but aesthetically speaking, I think it adds a sense of surrealism to the screenplay and overall plot. Colors are there, though not very vibrant at all, and the monochromatic palette is sure to divide videophiles who might be mistaking this for a bad transfer. But rest assured, it's not. As mentioned, black levels are very deep and benefit greatly from the type of photography used. Contrast suffers as a result, obviously, but image detail is still quite good. Sharpness of objects get a little lost in longer shots, but a lot of the film's closeup shots show some serviceable textures and skin hues, particularly in Giamatti's beard and Biel's flushed cheeks. There also don't appear to any signs of Edge Enhancement or DNR. For what the movie is and considering the kind of content it involves, it's certainly good enough, though nothing to write home about compared to other dramas I've seen.<br /><br />Audio - 4.0<br /><br />Much like it's visual presentation, the audio is equally reserved, but accurate enough to warrant some merit. The DTS-HD track for this film very subdued and relies heavily on just two elements: the dialogue and score. Dialogue is very well-enunciated. Taking place in Vienna, I was a little disappointed in some of the linguistic authenticity, being that I didn't believe any one character was actually Austrian, but that's okay. The acting itself and the excellent script sound great through the center channel. I felt as if I was almost watching some kind of stage play, what with the picture framing and audio giving it that "silent, but understood" feeling. The score by Philip Glass is fairly low key, but does a wonderful job enhancing the more emotional and plot-driven scenes. What little sound effects there are disperse and direct themselves accordingly, though are very limited to either horse hooves on the ground, the grinding wheels of a carriage, or crowd noise in and outdoors with some decent separation provided amongst the rears, as well as some panning across the front speakers. There's one scene where the Prince is practicing with a shotgun that really wakes you up, but that's about as loud as it gets. LFEs are next to non-existent, as I'm pretty sure I heard my subwoofer go to standby on multiple occasions. Again, it's not going to wow your guests, but it's serviceable enough.<br /><br />Overall - 4.0<br /><br />I was really surprised at how well this movie turned out. It managed to psychologically suck me into its plot from the very start, and then provide me with a great amount of emotional satisfaction in all but 90 seconds at the end. After hearing so much controversy between this and The Prestige, I have to say any and all comparisons are, indeed, unwarranted and needless outside of the one theme they have in common: magic. Other than using magic as a driving force for the plot, they're so thematically different, I urge anyone who hasn't seen both to just not listen to the hype and take each film for face value, as they're both entertaining in their respective rights. With very good A/V quality, though unfortunately no extras worth mentioning, The Illusionist comes recommended on the strength of the storytelling alone.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IWWRZJOXOSYP.html">A1IWWRZJOXOSYP</a><br/><p>Neil Burger directed "Interview with the Assassin" and recently completed "The Return" with Rachel McAdams & Michael Pena about a soldier returning home from Iraq.  This film is an adaptation of a story by Pulitzer Prize winning author Steven Millhauser.  The excellent cinematography of Dick Pope was nominated for an Oscar, a similar award which he won from the San Diego Film Critics.  Philip Glass' score was recognized with an award by the New York Film Critics Online.  I enjoyed the acting in the film.  Edward Norton was nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for "Primal Fear" in 1996 and as Best Actor in 1998 for "American History X."  His film "The Painted Veil" was touching and excellent.  As Eisenheim, Norton's performance is highly controlled, internal.  We are unable to tell if anything is reaching him, but see his desire for Sophie.  In the DVD extras, it took me a moment to recognize him without his beard.  Jessica Biel has been in two very interesting film projects, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EU1Q7M">London</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0792842189">Ulee's Gold</a>.  In the DVD extras, she says that Sophie von Teschen was a part she actively sought & was delighted to play.  Within the same week, I had purchased and watched the DVD <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VNMMQG">Amazing Grace</a>.  Rufus Sewell plays the slave reformer Clarkson with flowing long hair and totes a bag full of manacles for most of the film.  When I looked at the box for this film, I was so surprised to see the same actor.  As Crown Prince Leopold, Sewell delivers a tightly knit performance, threatening to be lethal to any around him.  The moment when he strikes Sophie almost made my blood chill.  Sophie looks at him with cold eyes and merely says, "Goodbye."  It's an excellent moment.  Paul Giamatti won a Best Actor award from the Toronto Film Critics for his breakout role in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007TKOAA">Sideways (Widescreen Edition)</a>.  He was nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for "Cinderella Man" in 2005, and won a similar award that year from Screen Actors Guild.  As Chief Inspector Uhl, he will not let go of this case & is committed to following the truth, no matter where it leads.  I found the story of this film to be riveting.  It spiraled into the unknown at every turn for me.  From the almost supernatural illusions of the "ghosts" to the orange tree that mysteriously grows, I found each new performance of Eisenheim to be an adventure.  Neil Burger kept the pace moving swiftly.  The romantic childhood relationship that seems to bloom into destined lovers captured my imagination.  I enjoyed this film immensely in the theatre and have looked for an affordable used copy for awhile.  I found it!

The first film was The Illusionist, while the second film was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LC55F2">The Prestige</a>. In my humble opinion The Prestige is a superior film mainly because of the film's technical execution under the watchful eye of director Christopher Nolan.<br />But I digress.<br />The Illusionist is a surprisingly engaging suspense film with strong supernatural or "fantasy" elements. Writer/director Neil Burger made the film on a relatively small budget, but this doesn't have a negative impact on the end result. On the contrary, The Illusionist is a better film than most supernatural thrillers because it relies on characterization to carry the story, rather than over-the-top action and unnecessary special effects. The few special effects in the film are subtle and understated, which in some strange way only makes them more impressive.<br /><br />The story is set in Vienna, during the dawn of the 20th century, where an illusionist named Eisenheim causes a commotion with his startling magic tricks. He soon attracts the intention of the social elite, including Vienna's own Crown Prince Leopold. Leopold, an arrogant, ambitious, and cynical man, feels threatened by Eisenheim's extraordinary abilities. He is outraged that Eisenheim knows more than he, and so as a ploy to reveal Eisenheim's methods, Leopold offers his fianc&eacute;e, the beautiful Duchess Sophie von Teschen to participate in one of Eisenheim's illusions. However, Crown Prince Leopold is ignorant to the fact that Eisenheim and the duchess were once childhood sweethearts and that Eisenheim made her a promise that they would one day be reunited. After Eisenheim's uncanny performance, he and the duchess rekindle their romance. When the jealous Crown Prince Leopold learns that the duchess has been unfaithful to him, he is consumed by jealousy and rage. When the duchess' body is found to have been murdered, the public suspects the crown prince has killed her, though they dare not voice their suspicions. But Leopold suspects Eisenheim's trickery played some part in his fianc&eacute;e's death, so he assigns Chief Inspector Uhl to uncover Eisenheim's secrets. Yet, Uhl is confounded when Eisenheim begins summoning disembodied spirits during his performances, and when Eisenheim conjures Duchess von Teschen's spirit on stage, the audience cries out that Crown Prince Leopold has murdered her. Fearing that a revolution against the monarchy may be at hand, Uhl doubles his efforts to unravel the growing mystery surrounding Eisenheim's abilities, the duchess' death, and what part if any that the crown prince had to play in her murder. But Uhl's investigation takes him deep into a world of illusion and conspiracy, where nothing is what it seems.<br /><br />One of the film's greatest strengths is the extraordinary ensemble cast, which features <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003W8NM">Edward Norton</a> as Eisenheim the Illusionist, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007TKOAA">Paul Giamatti</a> as Chief Inspector Uhl, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018O4YT0">Rufus Sewell</a> as Crown Prince Leopold, and Jessica Biel as Duchess Sophie von Teschen. While Norton, Giamatti, and Sewell give typically strong performances, the real surprise is Jessica Biel, who gives what may be her most complex and convincing performance yet.<br />Where the film fails ever so slightly is that director Neil Burger seems to be attempting to make some sort of a statement about the role that spirituality plays in politics. But this shortcoming is outweighed by the film's many superlatives. Employing numerous sleight of hand tricks to manipulate the audience's perception of the storyline, Neil Burger creates an ambiguity, which will leave viewers questioning whether anything truly supernatural occurred or whether the seeming magic that took place was just an elaborate deception. I'll let you decide, but remember: Don't believe what you see.<br /><br />Also recommended:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012OSGJK">Houdini: The Movie Star</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BGS17Q">Time After Time</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0011E5M66">The Adventures of Baron Munchausen</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000AUHQR">Fairy Tale: A True Story</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BB152A">Criss Angel: Mindfreak: The Complete Season One</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HDR8BO">Criss Angel: Mindfreak: The Complete Season Two</a></p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>Boy, this was a beautifully-filmed movie, just gorgeous from first to last frame.  Almost as impressive was the story, a fantasy-mystery- romance-drama combination set in Vienna, Austria, around the turn of the 20th century.<br /><br />It is a story that should keep most viewers intrigued all the way and perhaps surprised quite a bit at the end. Edward Norton does his normal job of making you fascinated with whatever character he's playing, this time a magician with almost supernatural powers: "Herr Eisenheim." The character he plays, and the tone of the movie in general, is pretty low-key with next to nothing in violence or profanity.<br /><br />It's simply a classy film and a modern-day one that older folks would very much enjoy as well as younger adults.

Some people could nod their heads at it and tell you it was entertaining. Others would hesitate, only to be polite, and say it just wasn't worth seeing. In my experience, not many people had very strong feelings one way or the other. And many people preferred to focus on whether or not it was better than The Prestige instead of discussing the movie on its own merits. I won't claim the moral high-ground, admittedly I have not seen The Prestige; all I have to go on is The Illusionist. And I liked it.<br /><br />The casting is better than luke-warm. The movie features the on-the-rise career of Paul Giamatti and the long-overdue return of Ed Norton. Giamatti acted his way onto the map with a highly praised performance in American Splendor, though he is probably most well-known for his role in the Sideways. If you have read my reviews before, this may not be the first time you see me point to the movie Confidence. It is the movie to which I would say Paul Giamatti's role is most comparable (and one of my favorite movies). In both movies he toes the line between the moral and immoral, while bringing a strong breadth of character. In the Illusionist he has a larger part, so you are able to enjoy his very-likeable personality in greater supply.<br /><br />Edward Norton has delivered some very noteworthy performances over his career. I can only wish for him to get more work; I enjoy what he does. He does not seem to work at the same pace as many in-demand actors today. Maybe he prefers more time off, or maybe I am the lone voice of support for his career. Either way, I thought he did a great job as lead in The Illusionist, where he brought the same "I'm better than you" arrogance that he gave us in Rounders. It seemed effortless as he settled into a character who is not too over-the-top. Knowledge is power, and his character knew what others did not.<br /><br />The story was a new flavor of an old dish. The creators here took the often-used template for a crescendo of suspense which carries you safely into the heart of an exhilarating plot twist. What they added was magic, literally. (Sure it was good, but you know what I mean.) I really enjoy magicians and their craft. I liked the way the creative team for The Illusionist was able to bring this story to life. The only thing I longed for was more magic. A few more slight-of-hand tricks would have made me very happy, though I understand that there wasn't necessarily any good place for them to be added.<br /><br />I hope that you are neither too proud of yourself, nor disappointed should you predict the twist. The strength of the movie is less in the surprise and more in the execution. The Illusionist is not a movie you will love, but I think if you give it a fair chance, you will be entertained.</p></br><a href="../users/AGKPTMTR3UX1R.html">AGKPTMTR3UX1R</a><br/><p>THE ILLUSIONIST is a heavily fictionalized tale of a love affair between Eisenheim The Illusionist and the Princess Sophie of the Austro-Hungarian Empire taking place in the years just prior to the First World War.<br /><br />It is not widely known that the historical Eisenheim was in fact Jewish, that his name was Erik Jan Hanussen (born Hermann Steinschneider), and that besides being a tremendously sought-after spiritualist entertainer in 1900s Vienna, he was later a friend and mentor of the young Adolf Hitler, to whom Hanussen taught many of his techniques for deceiving and manipulating audiences. Hitler might be said to have perfected Hanussen's art, and later repaid his teacher by having Hanussen killed.<br /><br />THE ILLUSIONIST, however, does not touch on these facts. Instead, it is a heavily stylized, darkly atmospheric, and deeply convincing period film which recounts how Eisenheim and Sophie manage to carry on a love affair while discrediting Sophie's fiance, the Crown Prince of Austria-Hungary. (The historical Crown Prince, Rudolf, committed suicide after murdering his mistress.)<br /><br />Edward Norton (and forgive me, but I can never think of him without thinking of Art Carney) plays Eisenheim with an understated intensity, as a man convinced of his own rightness who manages, despite this, to never misstep into arrogance. Jessica Biel is beautiful, intelligent, noble, and facile, as Sophie. Both give excellent performances, but the stellar performance of this film belongs to Paul Giamatti, as Police Inspector Uhl, the agent of the Crown Prince, who becomes half-conspirator and half-pawn in the convoluted plan hatched by Eisenheim and Sophie to steal away from Vienna together.<br /><br />THIS FILM IS VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DY46ZABF4CMQ.html">A3DY46ZABF4CMQ</a><br/><p>The Illusionist is a fascinating film directed by Neil Burger (Interview with the Assassin) and starring Edward Norton (Fight Club), Jessica Biehl (Stealth), Paul Giamatti (Sideways), and Rufus Sewell (Tristan + Isolde).<br /><br />Norton plays magician Eisenheim in 19th century Vienna.

It's a wonderful story of just how far a man will go to get back to the love of his life.  Norton portrays Eisenheim, an illusionist who has a penchant for bizarre, almost supernatural magic tricks that captivate his audience.  As a teen, he falls for a young duchess (Biel).  However, he being the poor son of commoners and she being royalty, their love is forbidden and the two are separated for what seems like forever.<br /><br />As the story unfolds, we learn that Eisenheim has found his lovely duchess, but she is to wed Crown Prince Leopold (Sewell), a hateful, cocky man who is intent on scientifically and logically explaining all of Norton's magical acts.  Naturally, the Eisenheim and Duchess Sophie begin to meet secretly, only to have Leopold dispatch Chief Inspector Uhl (Giamatti) and his goons to find out what's really happening.  From there, the story begins to twist and turn.  It's full of deceit, rage, romance, and even a little bit of humor.  I can't speak much more about it or I'll give away too much.<br /><br />Norton is superb.  His lovelorn character becomes progressively sicker as the story unfolds, and he exerts all of his energy to reclaim the love of his life.  Biel does a wonderful job even though her accent isn't the most believable.  She carries off the role of royalty very well.  Giamatti is perfect as Uhl, who not only investigates the matter at hand, but narrates the story as well.  You don't know if you should root for him or pray that he gets his just desserts.  Sewell delivers, in my opinion, the top performance in this story.  He's arrogant, vengeful, and a baldfaced liar to boot.  His actions keep this story moving along at an acceptable pace.<br /><br />Overall, this film is well deserving of four-and-one-half stars.  It's a great flick that combines forbidden love, deceit, violence, and a little bit of magic all into one.  It's a definite keeper, and I give it my "must buy" seal of approval.</p></br><a href="../users/A3SU3TXON36T0X.html">A3SU3TXON36T0X</a><br/><p>_The Illusionist_ is an excellent and entertaining film with a unique story detailing the efforts of a young magician to win the love of a woman.

The story traces the life of a young magician (who was first taught by a wandering magician he came in contact with) as he meets with a young Duchess and tries to win her love.  However, the two are forced to separate because the young man is a peasant and the Duchess is royalty and such an accommodation is inconceivable to the people of the time.  After their forced separation the young magician travels to the Orient where he learns the secrets of the "dark arts".  It is only then that he returns to Vienna as the illusionist and stage magician Eisenheim (Edward Norton).  The magic tricks of Eisenheim are particularly complex, and seeing as how they have no apparent and conceivable manner in which they could be accomplished many attribute them to the supernatural.  It is while performing on stage however that Eisenheim meets with the Duchess Sophie (Jessica Biel) again in a daring encounter with death that invokes the immortality of the soul.  As it turns out however, Duchess Sophie is to be wed to Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell), who not only challenges the tricks of the magician but also is notoriously ruthless and cruel (and even rumored to have beaten his previous mistress and possibly killed her).  The story involves a profound encounter with death and raises the question of the nature of the soul.  Indeed, the police Chief Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti) is also to enter this story as the plot unravels.  Ultimately a conflict ensues between the Crown Prince and the magician that must be settled in a very disturbing manner.  Further, the emerging spiritualist movement plays some role in this story as the magician invokes the spirits of the dead.  Spiritualism (which was often linked to socialism and various reform movements) is invoked by the people as a means to achieve a "spiritual republic".  Such subversive activities are of course frowned upon by the powers that be.  The movie ultimately raises the question of the existence of the supernatural and the survival of the soul after death.  To see how this is resolved within the movie, you must watch it.  However, as a story the movie is a classic tale of love that knows no bounds (neither the separation in social class nor the separation of the grave can drive the lovers apart).  I found this movie to be excellently done.  The story is interesting, the magic tricks are impressive, the characters were well played, and the setting was as I would expect the turn-of-the-century in Vienna.  As a love story this movie is a classic and is sure to provide a night's worth of entertainment.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>Steven Millhauser's brilliant little short story 'Eisenheim the Illusionist' is beautifully realized cinematically by Neil Burger who not only adapted the story as a screenplay but also directed with a great flair for the subject.  Wisely using the repeated line 'Nothing is what it seems' Burger infuses this dark investigation into the lives of the divided Viennese classes and suggests the crumbling of the Austro-Hungarian Empire with the focus on the illusory magic of one Eisenheim (finely characterized by Edward Norton) and its effects on the Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell) and the bifurcated Duchess Sophie (Jessica Biel).<br /><br />As children  Eisenheim and Sophie were friends despite the disparity of their class: Sophie was royalty (a Duchess) and Eisenheim was the son of a cabinetmaker to the court.  They fall in love but are separated by caste and Eisenheim wanders Asia and Russia learning the vagaries of magic and illusionist tricks while Sophie is raised at court to become the wife of Crown Prince Leopold, whose plans to overthrow his father the Emperor to become the King of both Austria and Hungary have made him an obsessive scoundrel.<br /><br />Years later Eisenheim enters Vienna as a showman, under the tutelage of his impresario Josef Fischer (Eddie Marsan),  delighting audiences with his illusionist tricks.  His impossible love for Sophie resurfaces and he becomes suspect in his role as an illusionist and as a threat tot he Crown.  Eisenheim is investigated carefully by Chief Police Inspector Uhl (a brilliant role by Paul Giamatti) and the manner in which the fates of the Crown versus the love of Eisenheim and Sophie are resolved is, well, 'Nothing is what it seems'.<br /><br />The cast is outstanding, the setting (in Prague) is incredibly atmospheric, and the costuming and lighting and cinematography marry into a perfect fit.  Adding to the illusionist spirit of the film is the fine musical score by Phillip Glass so well loved for his score for 'The Hours' and one of our most important classical music composers of the day.  THE ILLUSIONIST is a fine, misty, dark evocation of life in La Belle &Eacute;poque of Vienna, based enough on fact that the fiction employs the concept that nothing is what it seems.

Must've been something that I read. In contradiction to whatever it was that set my expectations low, I will set yours relatively high.<br /><br />The Illusionist was thoroughly entertaining from start to finish. And it's basically a 4-person show by Edward Norton (Eisenheim the Illusionist), Paul Giamatti (Inspector Uhl), Jessica Biel (Sophie) and Rufus Sewell (The Crown Prince); All 4 giving real A-list performances.<br /><br />Perhaps my low expectations were because The Illusionist was released right around the same time as Christopher Nolan's The Prestige, and I therefore at the time had a case of Magician-Movie-Overload. Regardless, I'm glad I opted to spend the time with The Illusionist during its first week on DVD. It was so good that, after viewing it on the way home from a business trip, I watched a second showing at home with my wife.<br /><br />My wife liked the movie as much as I did, and that's saying a lot based on her usual "where do you find these movies" comment after watching one of my DVD picks.<br /><br />The Illusionist is part Romeo and Juliet period drama based in turn of the century (no not the last one, the one before) Vienna.  It's part psychological drama...a kind of whodunit with a clever, but somewhat predictable twist. And the Illusionist is part magic show.<br /><br />A lot of the tricks in The Illusionist are movie magic...in fact most are movie magic and could only be done as so. Don't expect to go into this movie and be truly amazed by wizardry. But the tricks are a very fun part of the movie, and I believe the intention was to deliberately raise the question of how tales of necromancy could have been inspired. The answer? Mass hypnotism (purely my own speculation of the movie's intent).<br /><br />My recommendation is to see for yourself.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KB1H0S7T6JX1.html">A3KB1H0S7T6JX1</a><br/><p>The Illusionist brings to the screen the love story between the son of a furniture maker and a daughter of Austrian aristocracy. It is 19th century Austria and two kids fall in love only to be forcefully separated by those who see the relationship as "unfitting." Nevertheless, the two lovebirds' paths cross again only this time the young lady is betrothed to the heir of the Austrian throne...<br />In short, it is a great setting with an interesting plot/storyline and with a predictable political agenda consisting of not-so-hidden messages for which the writers and director are responsible.<br />The not-so-hidden politics behind the movie has to do with the presence (of course!) of the evil European. What a coincidence that Abramowitz-Eisenheim is the "good guy" while the Germanic Austrian royalist and heir to the throne is the villain; very original indeed...<br />Aside from the not-so-subtle and not-so-hidden political agenda, the movie does a good job of providing a fairly generous dose of entertainment.</p></br><a href="../users/A30TK6U7DNS82R.html">A30TK6U7DNS82R</a><br/><p>Film gets better and better as it goes along, after a bitter beginning in which the scratches and breaks of primitive cinema are aped to give that old time patina, or lustre, to persuade you that you are watching a documentary from that era.  (When is the era, anyhow?  Though Eisenheim uses actual firepots to illuminate his act, it must be set somewhat after the age of electricity, for Paul Giamatti's police constables produce from nowhere a fully operative movie projector and switch it on!)  (And on an adjoining screen we see a sophisticated, and Technicolor moving image years before Technicolor was actually invented!)  Like Coppola's DRACULA, or like the recent musical MOULIN ROUGE, director Neil Burger brings in the flaws and cracks of silent era film, and instantly takes us back to the day, though it's not 100 per cent convincing.  Nor is his use of Prague for Vienna of all places, when the two cities are so radically different, but Prague must be fantastically cheaper to film in.  But that's standard movie practice today, the way that, if one's only exposure to New York City was through the cinema, you would be forgiven for thinking it looks exactly like Toronto.<br /><br />Anyhow I soon found myself caught up in the story, and to my surprise, Paul Giamatti was much better than he's been in years, and as for Jessica Biel, well, she has a new spring in her step, and she repays the confidence Burger placed in her, for her part couldn't have been an easy one and yet she's truthful and honest in nearly every scene.  Does Ed Norton ever hold a ball of light as he does on the DVD cover and poster?  I don't think so, but the one pose Eisenheim falls into, arm extended, fingers charging the air around his hand with electricity, is a commanding, Universal horror one.  It might also have been invented by Karloff or Lugosi, and yet Norton carries it off.<br /><br />Who was that actress from Canada who used to be in every other spooky sort of art movie, like Cronenberg's CRASH or Fincher's THE GAME--and she looked like a prototype for Jessica Biel, with the same unseeing eyes and fat, bruised lips?  I know, I know, Deborah Kara Unger.  She wouldn't have been bad either.  She's so great and I haven't seen her since WHITE NOISE.<br /><br />In THE ILLUSIONIST, is it just me, or how bad is Burger's dialogue whenever Jessica Biel is addressed?  She's playing Sophie, the Duchess von Teschen.  Does this mean that fellow noblewomen will be saying, "Your dress is so pretty, Duchess von Teschen!"  The best is when she goes missing and the Vienna Woods swarm with volunteers all calling out, "Duchess von Teschen!  Duchess von Teschen!"  No wonder she's not responding, boys.</p></br><a href="../users/A20EEWWSFMZ1PN.html">A20EEWWSFMZ1PN</a><br/><p>Young Sophie (Eleanor Tomlinson) upper class is enamored of budding illusionist son of a carpenter (Aaron Johnson.) They are forcibly separated. Destined to meet again in the future as Edward Norton and Jessica Biel, their actions may have an effect of the future history of Europe.<br /><br />I guess as an audience we are jaded with the onslaught of ghost stories and "seeing dead people" that the story and outcome is pretty much predictable, not that anyone took too much effort to hide.  At least a fact or a butler did not pop out of the closet at the last minute.<br /><br />However the presentation was excellent with the film having a slight flicker gives a hand cranked quality to it. The story is told in third person by Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti.) The music that accompanies the film was by Philip Glass.  Once again Rufus Sewell (Fortinbras "Hamlet -1996") does an excellent portrayal of Crown Prince Leopold.</p></br><a href="../users/A146H6A41B26QT.html">A146H6A41B26QT</a><br/><p>"The Illusionist" is a stylish, turn of the century mystery that manages to be engrossing while not entirely believable. Edward Norton is the son of a cabinet maker, who seems to have acquired magical, perhaps real, supernatural powers. He appears in Vienna, amazes audiences, and is well on his way to becoming a rich man, but for reasons I can't say without becoming a spoiler, he antagonizes the Crown Prince Leopold, who tries to shut him down, unsuccessfully.  Paul Giamatti is the Police Chief, who has been corrupted by Leopold but whose conscience is troubling him as Leopold urges him towards more and more extreme action to get rid of the magician. Jessica Biel is a quite believable Duchess who is Leopold's fianc&eacute;e, but comes to learn that marriage to the Crown Prince may come at too high a cost. Norton and Biel are quite good--it may take a while for Giamatti to shed his "Sideways" image, but he's almost successful in making the transition to a costume drama. A lush, intense Philip Glass score is a nice touch. My husband liked this film too, and we had a lot of fun afterwards trying to figure out what really happened. Play close attention to the final 5 minutes of the movie!</p></br><a href="../users/A2VD2D1QHCMF9Q.html">A2VD2D1QHCMF9Q</a><br/><p>This was a very good, very entertaining movie.  With all the technology we have today we have no doubt lost the fascination with illusion that Eisenheim's audiences marveled over.<br /><br />My only criticism is that the ending was rushed a bit.  Too much activity was placed in the last minutes of the film to allow for a complete and satisfactory explanation of the main element of the story, mainly, the mutual love of Eduard and the Countess.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>Neil Burger has created a rare successful period thriller in "The Illusionist", which he wrote and directed, inspired by Steven Millhauser's short story "Eisenheim the Illusionist".  In Vienna circa 1900, an astonishing illusionist named Eisenheim (Edward Norton) attains such great fame and admiration that his conjuring feats inspire jealousy in Austria's Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell). The Prince is determined that no one should possess greater power or cleverness than himself, so he insists that Chief Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti) uncover Eisenheim's secrets. What Uhl discovers is more volatile than trade secrets: Eisenheim has renewed a romance with his childhood friend Duchess Sophie von Teschen (Jessica Biel), whose expected marriage to Leopold is key to the Prince's political ambitions.<br /><br />While most period thrillers are burdened by their accoutrements, "The Illusionist" is immensely entertaining. And it couldn't look better. The film's deep blacks and rich browns are beautiful compliments to Eisenheim's inscrutable character. Phillip Glass' score is perfection -and as essential a component as the characters and visuals. Edward Norton, Rufus Sewell, and Paul Giamatti, playing three intelligent men with veiled ambitions, create the tension that drives the story. Sewell is particularly memorable as a powerful man frustrated politically and now personally, a consummate rationalist  who sometimes fails to master his own emotions. Prince Leopold is fictional but was evidently inspired by the mysteries surrounding the death of the real Crown Prince Rudolph of Austria.<br /><br />A few weaknesses in the script prevent "The Illusionist" from being a 5-star movie for me: The romance is a bit feeble. The Duchess is too old to be a suitable match for the Crown Prince, as her prime child-bearing years are past. The principle problem in the story that sets Eisenheim scheming and the plot in motion could be resolved by much simpler means. So it's not quite convincing. But these characters are fascinating. The magic is captivating. The production reproduced the conjuring acts by the same methods they would have been performed a century ago, to the extent that it was possible. The great practitioner and historian of the magic arts Ricky Jay consulted on the film. "The Illusionist" is thoroughly enjoyable and bound to inspire awe for magicians past and present.<br /><br />The DVD (20th Century Fox 2007): Bonus features include 2 short interview pieces, a theatrical trailer (2 1/2 min), and an audio commentary. "The Making of The Illusionist" (4 min) features interviews with the cast in which they talk about their characters and the film. "Jessica Biel on The Illusionist" (1 1/2 min) mostly repeats the interview from "The Making of...". The audio commentary by writer/director Neil Burger is the best bonus feature. Burger discusses the film's themes of class, power, and uncertain reality, casting, period manners, telling the story from Uhl's point of view, and filming challenges. He also reveals how the magic tricks were done and what enhancements were made for the film. Subtitles are available for the film in English and Spanish.</p></br><a href="../users/A38QEATH3NODFM.html">A38QEATH3NODFM</a><br/><p>I missed this film in the theaters, but now the chance has arrived on DVD, and it was good. Ed Norton does a solid job in his role as Eisenheim the illusionist, but Paul Giamatti is great, and should earn an oscar nomination again.  A fictional story taking place in turn of 20th the Century Austria, Giamatti in the role of city chief inspector narrates a film about Eisenheim, an illusionist in vienna  making big noise with his spectacular illusions.  It even gets the attention of Prince Leopold, and more importantly, his soon to be fiancee (Jessica Biel).  I don't want to spoil the movie, but history is layed out and certain paths have crossed before, and then the movie becomes a bunch of smoke and mirrors, Is anything what it seems?  A good movie for the collection, great original story.  A good mystery, and even a little romance.  Check this one out, hopefully the hollywood snobs won't skip this one on Oscar night.</p></br><a href="../users/A21B2TJBWCSK1R.html">A21B2TJBWCSK1R</a><br/><p>The Illusionist and The Prestige were released in theatres in 2006 and featured 19th century magicians as their protagonists. However, the latter was backed and promoted by a major Hollywood studio while the former was a modestly budgeted independent film. As a result, The Illusionist probably didn't receive the kind of exposure it deserved. Both films also differed radically in tone. While, The Prestige focused on the rising competition between two magicians and the dangerous lengths they went to top one another, The Illusionist was a deeply romantic film about lovers separated by class.<br /><br />Edward Norton is well cast as the intensely charismatic magician. It's a wonderfully modulated performance that suggests a hint of arrogance (like when he makes Leopold look momentarily foolish during a performance) with a vulnerability that lies underneath and that Sophie's presence brings out.<br /><br />Paul Giamatti is also excellent as Uhl, the audience surrogate. He narrates the film and is also a conflicted character, torn between his loyalty to Leopold and his sympathy with Eisenheim. The battle of wits between him and Eisenheim are well-played. Both are intelligent men who are very careful and meticulous in how they deal with their professions.<br /><br />The stunning Jessica Biel looks luminous in each and every shot. She's mainly known for appearing in forgettable Hollywood fluff like Summer Catch and Stealth but recently she's been trying to branch out and pick more substantial projects like Elizabethtown and Home of the Brave.<br /><br />The story of The Illusionist is deceptively simple: a love story on the surface but this is actually a bit of misdirection on director Neil Burger's part as we must pay attention to every detail.  Nothing is what it seems as he orchestrates the entire film like one of Eisenheim's illusions.<br /><br />There is an audio commentary by writer/director Neil Burger. He talks about what drew him to the short story and why he wanted to make it into a movie. He also speaks intelligently about the film's themes and character motivations. This is an excellent and informative track that covers many aspects of the production.<br /><br />"The Making of The Illusionist" is a standard promotional featurette with the actors talking briefly about their characters and the story of the film with clips from the movie.<br /><br />"Jessica Biel on The Illusionist" features some of the soundbites from the previous featurette as she talks briefly about why she wanted to do this film.<br /><br />Finally, there is a theatrical trailer.</p></br><a href="../users/A155KXFRZCA7C.html">A155KXFRZCA7C</a><br/><p>Needless to say that Edward Norton's performance is as usually, truly exceptional as is also Paul Giamatti's performance first-class. Rufus Sewell's role is a little handicapped, so he doesn't shine as much as he did in his other roles.<br /><br />The film itself is very well made, ... the suspense keeps on tightening throughout the movie, and the ending is a surprise. The director captured the mood of turn-of-the century Vienna very well, although this flick was filmed in Prague and other parts of the Czech Republic. Also, the illusions that Eisenheim (Norton) performs are very believable - it's just fun to watch ... Eisenheim reminds us of a type of Criss Angel during that era.<br /><br />Overall, this film centers around a forbidden love, ... yes, it's a love story with familiar twists plus the added bonus of the magic because of the illusionist's profession. Sure, there are a few scenes that are extended and that could have been shortened, but overall it's well worth watching this film. Again, the acting is superb, the mood and era are very well captured and the photography, script, suspense, etc. deliver a true classic Hollywood experience.</p></br><a href="../users/A1F2EYORWOZ3G1.html">A1F2EYORWOZ3G1</a><br/><p>This movie is interesting. It is captivating visually as well as by sound. The acting is strong, stellar quality. The music fits perfectly. The story is weak... at least that part which we are privy to. And that is the problem here.<br /><br />We, the audience, are not privy to anything. We are entertained by the illusionist throughout the story... not even a crumb of something is thrown at us with which to relish. We know less than half the characters in the story.<br /><br />Only until the final 5 minutes are we given any sort of explanation. And I feel we are cheated by that. What is never explained are the ghost-like figures that The Illusionist summons up in his performances and which he uses to escape by. Not a nice thing to do guys... after all... you are playing to us.<br /><br />What I did like was the costumes and sets.... brilliant and very eloquent. It was reminiscent of Doctor Zhivago in that the period was displayed very well.<br /><br />The acting was very very good also. Norton and the rest played well off each other in a very convincing manner.<br /><br />But... the story lacks. And to have a quick, flashback style explanation was insulting, hence the low points. If you're going to have a mystery, Agatha Christie is the only one privy to behind the scenes development. And even she fully explained things in the end. This one didn't.</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>This film has deserved the prestigious nomination and notable distinction - at least to my view - to occupy a relevant place in the recent production of the cinema.<br /><br />The result has been amazing. Not only this gem movie captivates and engages the most exigent viewer from start to finish. At the end of the projection you experience that cathartic magic of the cinema, because it's the cinema paying a priceless tribute to itself. It is the eternal ritornello that many times before we have heard it: the cinema is a dream's fabric An universe of illusions, where the spectral shadows and these twenty four shots by second personify and represent a dramatis personae.<br /><br />An illusionist Eissenheim, attracts the whole attention in the Vienna of the late years of the XIX Century. He met in his early adolescence the love of his life, his personal muse. He will focus himself around the illusionism as a way to make his life and astonish the world through his undeniable gifts.<br /><br />The careful photography in sepia, the marvelous shot angles, the effective camera work and the presence of a magnificent and inspired cast supported by a bewitching script, literally seduce us and invites to participate with this talented and novel director Neil Burger of one of the most original and surprising works around this interesting issue. I must confess that since Istvan Szabo's Hanussen, I had not enjoyed of such lavish achievement.<br /><br />Special kudos for Paul Giamatti (who is demonstrating step by step without making too much noise, to be one of the most talented mature actors at this moment) and Edward Norton who makes a convincing role. The employment of the iris in the epilogue of the film  and the special and that little but smart detail of the hat and that sardonic laugh is an extraordinary device that crowns a film made with good taste, fertile imagination and profound love for the cinema.</p></br><a href="../users/A3B87UZLPCF0HW.html">A3B87UZLPCF0HW</a><br/><p>Eisenheim(Norton),an illusionist of magic practices his own brand of supernatural sorcery,enthralling the people of Vienna,including Crown Prince Leopold,who is equally enthralled and abhored.He embarks upon denouncing the great Eisenheim publicly but falls foul of his own plan by offering his fiance Sophie (Biel) to the magician in a bid to sabotage his act before an audience. This,however proves to be his undoing as Sophie and Eisenheim are not strangers to each other and they begin to rekindle a long lost romance.Chief Inspector Ull,(Giamatti) is drawn into the plot when the Prince,on hearing of their deception,orders him to charge Eisenheim with fraud.What follows is a tale of love and intrigue,tightly bound by the power of illusion.The illusionist is a well told story with clever use of imagery which consumes the viewer.The acting is of high quality with particularly strong performances from Norton and Giammati.This movie captures the imagination.</p></br><a href="../users/APOGXH3A74CM3.html">APOGXH3A74CM3</a><br/><p>This is a masterful piece of storytelling!

It's a rather accomplished movie that would have you guessed from beginning till the end. Rather than divulging the plot that would compromise the enjoyment of this film, suffice to say that the setting is in yesteryear's Vienna, childhood friends got reunited & rekindles their relationship which perhaps, blossoming into love, revolution is in the air with the Prince plotting to topple the Emperor, a Police Inspector that's sniffing around for Eisenheim's blood to please the Prince so as to be promoted to Chief Inspector & along the way, he struggles with his conscience if it's the right thing to do. Everything would come together in the end and viewers, I'm sure would be taken aback by twist that awaits them.  It's for you to find out if what we see is illusion or it's for real.  Overall, a very accomplished and slick production under direction of Neil Burger.  Scores from Philip Glass does give the movie the mood of the time.  Outstanding performances from the ever-versatile Edward Norton, Paul Giammati (is there anything else this actor won't do?), Jessica Biel (looks very much like Scarlett Johanssen as in The Prestige), and Rufus Sewell.  You won't be disappointed and highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/AZCDCO6KK2T81.html">AZCDCO6KK2T81</a><br/><p>This is one of those rare films that has everything going for it.  It has a superior cast in which each star pulls his or her own weight and then some.  It also has a very clever script that will leave you guessing until the very end and a wonderful score by Philip Glass that is perfect for this period piece.  In addition, the photography and special effects all work in enhancing this story.  My entire family enjoyed this film and applauded it at the end when we viewed it in our home theater.  That is a rare event in my house.  We just rented this film and now they all insist I run out and buy it immediately.<br /><br />If you like romance that isn't overtly sexual (no nudity -but a little suggestive), crime that isn't overly graphic (a minor blood scene), and a plot that you can sink into and literally say "that movie was an experience", then this movie is probably for you.</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>Taking place in the Austrian/Hungarian empire before World War I, this film is beautifully shot and captures the feel of the early 1900's.  Norton and Giamatti are terrific, with fine supporting work by their castmates.  The story involves the childhood forbidden love between a noble girl and a peasant boy.  After they are discovered, he disappears and travels the world learning magic and illusion.  He returns 15 years later to find her engaged to the prince, but very unhappy.  The prince is a mean petty man, and Giamatti is his man.  It is an interesting battle of wills between the prince and Norton with Giamatti caught between.  The ending is a big twist and reveal.  I wasn't completely suprised, but I did enjoy it.  A great little film and worth getting.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDNTB7377YH2.html">A1CDNTB7377YH2</a><br/><p>The movie opens with Richard Norton on a stage in late 1800's Austria performing some sort of magic trick when a group of soldiers bursts in to arrest him.  The rest of the movie is a "flashback" leading up to that scene.  We find Norton's character as a boy coming across a mysterious man by a tree.  You don't know if Norton actually met him or imagined him as the guy disappears.  Norton has an interest in magic and his character meets a well to do girl who he becomes friends with.  The two sneak off together so Norton can show her his magic tricks and generally hang out (like friends in a clubhouse).<br /><br />The girl's parents infuriated that she has taken up with a "commoner" come after her.  When they are about to get caught the girl begs Norton to make them disappear.  Norton tries but fails and the two are caught.  The girl is brought home forbidden to ever see Norton again.<br /><br />Years later Norton has become a famous magician with the name of Meisenheim.  He is watched by a police chief who is somewhat of an amateur magician himself.  He is fascinated by Meisenheim and begs to be shown one of Meisenheim's tricks where he makes an orange tree seemingly grow out of a flowerpot instantaneously.<br /><br />At one of Meisenheim's shows he calls a volunteer to assist him from the audience and it is the fianc&eacute;e (Jessica Biels) of the heir to the Austrian throne.  Meisenheim realizes it is his childhood friend because she is wearing the same magic locket that he gave her when they were kids.  He becomes infatuated with her and starts to pursue her.<br /><br />Meanwhile the police chief, loyal to the Austrian heir is keeping a close watch on Meisenheim, suspecting something may be afoot between him and Biels.  The police chief has his own agenda as he was born a peasant and believes through faithful support of the heir, he can rise to Mayor when then heir becomes the next emperor.<br /><br />The rest of the movie becomes a game of cat and mouse between Meisenheim, the police chief and the heir and Biels and you are not sure if what you suspect to be is true or an "Illusion" as the title of the movie suggests.  Not really a spoiler but the real facts are only revealed in the last sequence, which seems to happen so fast that if you watched it on DVD you would need to rewind several times.<br /><br />I thought that the acting of the police chief and the heir were superb but Norton and Biel's performances were just okay.  The movie seemed to drag in parts and even when you see the explanation at the end, some of the scenes seemed to not be feasible based on the explanation given.  All in all I give it between 3 ? and 4 stars and I do agree with some of the critics that said that the special effects seemed to be low budget.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MG8DHACXH5MS.html">A2MG8DHACXH5MS</a><br/><p>WOW ... this was an A-HA film!

When Duchess Sophie and magician Eissmann are reunited after 15 years they do everything to be together. The only problem is Sophie's somewhat arranged marriage to the Crown Prince Leopold who is secretly plotting to overthrow his father ...and needs to marry Sophie to get the support of the Hungarians. Leopold is a tyrant in the making who refuses to have his plans thwarted and will go to any lengths to secure his visions of an Austro-Hungarian Empire.<br /><br />After being separated as young teenagers, Eissmann traveled the world and performed to become a master illusionist... but he could never let go in his heart his beloved Sophie.... until his return to the city of their youth. The rest that follows is slight of hand and tricks that even fool the head police inspector. Chief Inspector Uhl is following his and Sophie's every move, and on orders from Leopold to find the fraud in the illusionist's act since Eissmann's popularity eclipses that of the Prince. Nothing is as it appears and the plot only gets more confusing the more the police try to figure out how the tricks are being performed.</p></br><a href="../users/AP3B615GM191G.html">AP3B615GM191G</a><br/><p>When making a "big reveal" film, a top-notch director must realize that the "reveal" cannot be the entire picture.  One must also include fair doses of character development, believable actions, & compelling drama in order to make us care enough for the reveal to actually mean something.  Sadly, Neil Burger does very little of that within "The Illusionist".<br /><br />For a basic plot summary, this period piece centers on stage magician Eisenheim (Edward Norton), who conjures up apparitions that are utterly stupefying.  When Sophie (Jessica Biel), the former love of his life, comes back into the equation, Eisenheim must make the decision once and for all as to whether or not they can carve out a life together despite being from completely different social classes.<br /><br />Despite the fact that "The Illusionist" was clearly made with care and a very good intent, it ultimately fails to impress for two specific reasons:<br /><br />1. There really isn't much to get invested in.  The characters are little more than cardboard cutouts (the human element is only "talked", not actually "lived"), while the events transpiring around them are never explained (e.g. Eisenheim's actual tricks).<br /><br />2. There is no "grit" to the picture whatsoever.  In Christopher Nolan's masterpiece "The Prestige", a similar magic-themed film, the director takes you deep inside the world the characters are living in, pulling no punches along the way.  We see it all...the good and the bad and all the raw emotions that result from it.  In "The Illusionist", however, stereotypical "class differences" and "the controlling husband" are used in place of real emotion.  Those stereotypes may have been true of the era, but in this case they needed to be felt instead of just referenced.<br /><br />Overall, then, I cannot recommend this one to those who like their movies deep and full of character growth, as it is quite superficial all the way around.  Yes, it does have a "mind-blowing" reveal, but because it fails in so many areas before that point, it loses all its credibility, so to speak.  I highly recommend "The Prestige" as an alternative yet still containing very similar themes.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PNTEDGMOLMOY.html">A2PNTEDGMOLMOY</a><br/><p>Edward Norton, Jessica Biel, Paul Giamatti, and Rufus Sewell all do yeoman's work in "The Illusionist," a visually lush love story/thriller set in Vienna.  These four actors are the high points of a movie that is also well served by its visual style, a fun paean to the grainy silent movies of yore.  A solid movie to be sure, but not one that stays with you long after the movie is over.<br /><br />"The Illusionist" tells the love story of Eisenheim the Illusionist (Norton) and Sophie (Biel).  Eisenheim wasn't born an illusionist, of course - he was the child of the cabinet maker who made furniture for the nobility, including Sophie's family.  But kids don't understand the caste system, and the two kids become childhood sweethearts until the adults discover their secret and break them asunder - Sophie is destined to marry a great lord.<br /><br />Eisenheim departs to wander the earth, and he comes back to Vienna 15 years later as one of the most famous illusionists in Europe.  His act thrills the Viennese public, including Inspector Uhl (Giamatti, perfect as always), who is also an amateur prestidigitator.  Uhl convinces his lord, the Crown Prince (Sewell, looking shockingly like Jude Law) to attend a show.  The Crown Prince does so, and brings his (reluctant) fiance, who just happens to be Sophie.  And thus are Sophie and Eisenheim reunited, and they learn that old flames still smolder.<br /><br />What follows is a romantic struggle where Eisenheim and Sophie try to break free from the Crown Prince, who is one of those classic movie villains who insists on marrying the heroine even though she will have nothing to do with him.  Sewell plays his part well, but unfortunately the Crown Prince comes off as little more than a spoiled brat and doesn't really rise to the level of a great foil for Eisenheim.<br /><br />Another unfortunate aspect of any movie featuring magicians is that the real magicians are already working in Hollywood special effects.  So while Eisenheim's audience may be dazzled as Eisenheim makes an orange tree grow on stage, or have two butterflies carry a handkerchief, or even conjure up shades of the dead, these scenes just aren't that thrilling to the movie audience.  After all, we've seen Titanic sink, Barad-Dur fall, King Kong knock down airplanes, and Anthony Michael Hall kiss Uma Thurman - we've seen plenty of miracles already.  Norton does a great job as Eisenheim, but it's difficult not to be reminded that we're merely watching special effects and not a real magician.<br /><br />The love story between Eisenheim and Sophie is touching, but does not reach the heights of a great Hollywood love story by any means.  The Viennese are definitely not the most passionate people in Europe - it's clear why Shakespeare set "Romeo and Juliet" in Italy rather than its chilly neighbor to the north.<br /><br />All in all, "The Illusionist" is a good, solid movie.  If this review comes across as a bit negative, that is only because I had so many people tell me that I "just had" to watch this movie.  I came in with high expectations, and while I can definitely recommend "The Illusionist" as a good movie, I can't say it's one of the must-see movies of the year.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RFG9LI7JDILS.html">A2RFG9LI7JDILS</a><br/><p>'the illusionist' was one of the few pleasant cinematic surprises of 2006. Somehow this elegant period piece was much more enchanting than the thrillers and horror flicks that came streaming in from all directions. Edward Norton's fine performance and a fine supporting cast are greatly enhanced by the period sets and costumes all lit and styled with great taste.. We live in a world of illusion and this movie does a fine job of tickling and teasing us with this notion.. One can only hope that this will help to open the doors for similar projects in 2007..</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>Set against the backdrop of turn-of-the-century Vienna "The Illusionist" uses slight-of-hand story telling and is a visually stunning treat. Magician Eisenheim (Edward Norton)returns to Vienna after wandering the world learning the tricks of his trade. His magic dazzles people but a former romance with the crown prince of Vienna's (Rufus Sewell)fianc&eacute;e  Sophie (Jessica Biel)threatens to derail his career when Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti in a stunning performance)is charged with arresting him or running him out of the city.<br /><br />Director Neil Burger has created a marvelous period piece with an intriguing romantic thriller at the heart of this film. The beautiful cinematography and Phillip Glass' marvelous score are wonderfully recreated on this sharp looking DVD.<br /><br />Fans expecting a lot of special features will be disappointed by the paltry ones included here. I suspect that there will probably be a special edition down the road, because considering the magic the film produces, there's a lot more tha could be discussed/shown. We get a 9 minute featurette with the cast and crew discussing how enticed they were with the material. There's also an interview with Jessica Biel discussing the film (which is an extension of the interview featured in the making of featurette on the film). The best special feature is the running commentary by director Neil Burger (sadly Giamatti, Norton and Biel are missing from the commentary track). Burger discusses his opinions of the actors (he was surprised and impressed with what Biel brought to her performance and points out the little touches that Norton & Giamatti introduced to their characters to bring added depth)to the magic tricks seen in the film whether they be "real" magic or CGI magic. It's an interesting commentary track but I'd watch the film first all the way through as there are spoilers in the commentary track.<br /><br />"The Illusionist" was a pleasant surprise with its strong performances and deft direction by Neil Burger. I should warn fans of fast paced action thrillers that this film takes its time in unspooling the story but the pacing works for the film.<br /><br />While there are many who insist on comparing "The Illusionist" and "The Prestige" (the other movie set against the background of magic)the only thing they share in common is a mystery and the magic. In "The Illusionist" the magic background is used for a romantic mystery-thriller while "The Prestige" uses the same backdrop for a tale of obsession, rivalry and revenge. Beyond that the films have little in common (including the way the stories are told). Comparing the two is like comparing the flavor of an orange and a tangerine--they're both fruit, both citrus but both have their own unique flavor. Sure some people will prefer one to the other but that doesn't mean one is inherently superior to the other--it depends on one's preference.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL.html">A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL</a><br/><p>`The Illusionist' provides great, old-fashioned fun.  Much like `The Prestige,' it is a magician's movie that requires the audience to keep their eyes on the subject.  This time the titled `illusionist,' Eisenheim (Edward Norton) is at the top of his form, but instead of wanting fame and fortune like the magicians in `The Prestige,' he keeps his eyes on the duchess, the love interest of the Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell).  At one point his fame gets him invited to an affair held by the Crown Prince, himself, and Eisenheim provides a trick to pull up the Prince's sword, much like the child with the pure heart does in the medieval fable.  He succeeds, but not without some doubts.  His embarrassment at this awkward moment creates a rivalry with `the illusionist'.  Supported by the chief inspector (Paul Giamatti), Eisenheim has just enough time to conjure a brazen love affair with the duchess.  But a drunken confrontation between the Prince and his unfaithful fianc&eacute; provides tragedy, one that seems to only be answered by a different venue on the illusionist's stage.  The Prince's jealous rage has him figuratively putting a noose around Eisenheim, one from which he must escape.<br /><br />While `The Prestige' benefits from Christopher Nolan's modern direction with a progressively dark appeal, `The Illusionist' has time-honored filmmaking with appeal that delivers its magic with greater resolution (from director, Neil Burger).  Both movies are excellent and are edited with precision, but while `The Prestige' is masterful at development; `The Illusionist' wins in a matchup.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>Much of a film's interest starts the moment audiences see trailers for it , and such was the case with THE ILLUSIONIST. The dark themes, nice sets, pretty actors/actresses, and supernatural undertones probably drew movie-goers to the theaters after checking out the trailers. But some may be disappointed to find little else behind The Illusionist. Although this disappointment won't fall to the level of despair or hatred of the film, movie buffs may feel as if they were lied to when it doesn't deliver the high-caliber flick they were expecting.<br /><br />The story ...<br /><br />Eisenheim the Illusionist is played by Edward Norton (AMERICAN HISTORY X), and Norton does an okay job with a scripted character that seems to have few emotions. Eisenheim's life has focused on his magical craft since he left his hometown and the love of his life, Sophie (Jessica Biel, ELIZABETHTOWN), a fellow teenager who's way above Eisenheim's station. Fifteen years later we find Eisenheim in Vienna only to discover that Sophie, now a beautiful young baroness, slated to marry into the upper echelon of royalty. Her husband-to-be is the dangerous and manipulating Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell, DARK CITY). But when Eisenheim and Sophie try to rekindle their love interest, deadly forces are at play and are ready to rip them apart again. One of these forces is Chief Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti, CINDERELLA MAN), the upstart of a poor butcher who's trying to rise to a power all his own (Viennese Mayor Uhl? Nice ring to it, eh?).<br /><br />Eisenheim and Sophie concoct a plan in which she can detach herself from the Crown Prince, but the plan seems doomed from the start. Sophie's life is put in danger and Eisenheim has to use his incredible illusionist powers to help save their lives and their love. But can it work?<br /><br />As with the title and the main character, much of what is seen is complete illusion. But if one watches carefully, they can pick up on hints of what is truly going on. "Make us disappear," Sophie pleads with Eisenheim at the beginning of the film as they cower in a hut. And that he cannot do so obviously affects the rest of his life and the rest of the film.<br /><br />The shinning stars in The Illusionist are Giamatti, Sewell, and, surprisingly, Biel. Although the entire focus of the film is around Norton's character, it's tough to get "into" him when what he mostly does is sit on a stage and make soulful apparitions appear by looking as if he were having a particularly tough bowel movement.<br /><br />Paul Giamatti really steals the show here. How great it is to see someone of Giamatti's chops FINALLY get the recognition he deserves and star in some great roles. Now he's proving that he's not just a co-star (THE TRUMAN SHOW, SAVING  PRIVATE RYAN). His Inspector Uhl character is miles away from ...well ...Miles in his career launching SIDEWAYS film. That the audience both roots for Uhl and hopes he fails is evidence of Giamatti's great acting ability.<br /><br />Rufus Sewell is the bad guy everyone loves to hate. He's done it time and again (A KNIGHT'S TALE, HELEN OF TROY, etc.) and pulls in a wonderfully slimy character portrayal here, too.<br /><br />But Jessica Biel is the biggest surprise. Looking both pretty and elegant, Biel goes further than she's ever gone before - far beyond 7th HEAVEN and THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE - and may have cemented herself as an actress with Oscar-caliber potential.<br /><br />The biggest letdown for film-o-philes will be that The Illusionist doesn't expand much beyond what they saw in the film's trailers a few months ago. But it does entertain, and it's visually interesting and well shot. Just don't expect too much from the script and you'll probably be just fine.</p></br><a href="../users/A18MBO1U4DPY20.html">A18MBO1U4DPY20</a><br/><p>Edward Norton gives a great performance. If you like him, you will like this film. The storyline  keeps getting lesser interesting as the movie goes on. The reason I give this film three stars is because I felt robbed of my time in the end. I mean, the end just didn't really do justice to the premise and a few things were left unexplained. The dialogues are decent. The sets and locations are fine. Some scenes in the first half were overwhelming while the sub-par end was the only major flaw I found in The Illusionist. The love story within the film was a tad dodgy cause there was no chemistry between the two involved. Paul Giamatti has done better films. His character had just one expression.<br /><br />Overall, I'd say, NOT BAD<br /><br />However, I will recommend this film to everyone. It's quite ambitious.</p></br><a href="../users/A28WJUJF6D2ULA.html">A28WJUJF6D2ULA</a><br/><p>In 1880's Vienna a stage magician called Eisenheim becomes celebrated for his mystifying illusions. With but a single seed he can instantly grow a mature tree; he possesses a magical looking glass which shows death within it; and most jarringly of all he seems to bring ghosts back to walk among---and accuse---the living. His demonstrations of talent catch the notice of the bullying heir to the Habsburg throne, who becomes obsessed with finding out how the deeds are done. He employs his all-purpose right-hand man to investigate Eisenheim and learn what he can. Meanwhile, this master illusionist recognizes the Prince's fianc&eacute;e as a girl he had once known in his boyhood, when he was then the son of a rural woodworker. Soon the master magician and the Prince's intended renew a love they'd felt in their youths, and a dangerous affair begins.<br /><br />The Illusionist has a satisfyingly dark feel to it. It is like watching a European art film, only done with an A-list Hollywood cast. The cobblestones and solid last-century scenery in Prague are perfect for this sort of tale, the lighting effects heighten the tension and the awesome-yet-understated on-stage demonstrations of magic Eisenheim performs are well-chosen to convey the atmosphere of the production. Also Paul Giamatti is so great in the part of the corrupt Crown Prince's not-yet-corrupted investigator that he readily becomes the film's star. Edward Norton, a generally superb actor, seems concealed in his role as the illusionist of the movie's title. By saying "concealed" it isn't that the role overwhelms him, it is more that he allows the role to be of greater essence than he as the contemporary actor, and I admire that. Also I'll note that Jessica Biel gives the most solid performance of her career as the love interest of both the stoical Eisenheim and the immoral Crown Prince Leopold.<br /><br />The Illusionist was a movie I enjoyed seeing unfold before me, even as I somehow lost interest in the plot, and was even annoyed by certain aspects of it. Despite the fact I liked this film and have nothing but praise for its visuals, there were some huge holes in it and there was a requirement that disbelief be suspended almost past the point of ready indulgence. I found it entirely ridiculous that a noblewoman engaged to marry the heir to the Austro-Hungarian Empire (among whose members politically-advantageous marriages were arranged in infancy, not adulthood) would firstly have the sort of freedom to go about unguarded that we were expected to accept that Biel's character Sophie von Teschen did, and secondly, we were further asked to believe that the death of a woman of her status would be nonchalantly verified by other than Imperial physicians, and that her state funeral would provide access for her body to be so deftly stolen. Was there no embalming, no lying in state, no grand service? Surely there would have been, and just as surely that would have made events as described impossible. Also in historical reality, though Crown Prince Leopold's death was attributed to suicide with a pistol, it was carried out with a woman, his lover, as part of a "romantic" death pact, and the Prince was not the ambitious would-be usurping reactionary The Illusionist portrayed him to be, so in the name of storytelling history is left behind without a flicker of remorse.<br /><br />The bottom line is that this is a fine film to see but it isn't air-tight and it doesn't stand up to much scrutiny. It's good for its scenery and some of its performances, and especially for its stage magic, but events could never have come to pass as the twist ending tells us they did.</p></br><a href="../users/A3W1JJGJHRPH4Y.html">A3W1JJGJHRPH4Y</a><br/><p>The movie is interesting in that you know from the very beginning that  the lovers will be re-united in the end; they give you plenty of clues along the way. The movie tells how Ed Norton tricked the inspector played by Giamatti to do the right thing in the end. The interesting part of the movie is to figure out how the Illusionist will win his true love. All the acting is good. Giamatti steals the show. Norton is his usual competent self. The cinematograpy is great. Glass's score is terrific. The biggest disappointment to me is that the tricks were all special effects. You don't know whether the illusionist is a trickster or a supernaturalist. The movie really never explains. I'm sure that confusion is intended. Some of the tricks defy explanation in the conventional sense in 19th century Vienna. The only thing "The Prestige" has over this movie is that some of the tricks were explained. In the Illusionist nothing is explained except for how they fooled the inspector.<br /><br />However, this fault is a small point. On the whole, I strongly recommend the movie. The locket is nice symbol throughout the movie of the love of the couple and life in general. The movie is very entertaining.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>I watched this film knowing nothing about it,yet I was able to tell what was going to happen at many key instances of the film. Even though it is predictable, I thought the story was pretty good. I just didn't think the characters were well developed and the love between the two stars was not convincing. They show the two lovers as children for a matter of minutes and I didn't really see why the bond was so strong. It's an OK movie that I would never watch again because once the secrets out, there is nothing more to hold your interest. It's worth a rental.</p></br><a href="../users/A18IK6YI6T3RK2.html">A18IK6YI6T3RK2</a><br/><p>I didn't know quite what to expect from this film..frankly, im not a huge fan of Norton and Jessica Beil is no Meryle Streep, but I was pleasantly surprised with this movie, the pace is good, and Norton is very good, as is Giamatti, whom I always like.  Rufus Sewell is very good as usual playing the villian, he has this flinty quality that really works well in this film.  The twist is very good and i really didnt see it coming.  Highly recomended..though i must advise you to watch the Prestige after this movie..when you see them you will understand why..hint:..The Prestige is much better movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R1HAXRNU0QX7.html">A2R1HAXRNU0QX7</a><br/><p>THE ILLUSIONIST is a very interesting movie that nonetheless falls short.  It fails to achieve the emotional impact it is clearly striving for.  It has an intellectual impact, it pleases because it shows a time and situation unfamiliar to us and it entertains with its originality and execution.  But at no time are we caught up in a sweep of emotions.  We observe from a distance.<br /><br />It tells the story of Eisenheim The Illusionist (Edward Norton), an unparalled "magician" who returns to his childhood home of Vienna after traveling the world in search of the greatest illusions ever seen.  He causes an immediate stir with his brilliance, and attracts the attention of the young heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne (Rufus Sewell) and his young bride-to-be (Jessica Biehl), who also happens to be the childhood sweetheart of Eisenheim.<br /><br />They rekindle their relationship.  Meanwhile, Eisenheim has captured the interest of young royal heir, and not in a good way.  The prince imagines that he is smarter than Eisenheim, and when he can't immediately expose the method behind the illusions, he becomes resentful, and sends the police (led by Paul Giamatti) on a mission to destroy Eisenheim.<br /><br />It's a good story, and it takes some nice turns, particularly when Eisenheim and his true love conspire to get away from the prince...and the seemingly tragic results of that effort.  The movie beautifully captures old Vienna.  It is remarkably intelligent and doesn't insult its audience.  And it has some really great magic tricks.  Naturally, we know the tricks are created through special effects...however, what is GREAT is that the film allows us to sort of put ourselves in the audience of late 19th century Vienna...and to feel just a little how stunning his illusions would have been.  We spend the whole movie wondering if he is an illusionist or if he really can do the tricks.<br /><br />Edward Norton is very intense in his role, and with his VanDyke beard, he looks terrific.  A true leading-man kind of part for him.  He's riveting.  Giamatti and Sewell have terrible facial hair, but otherwise do nice work.  Giamatti does struggle a bit making his "Viennese" accent believable, though.  Biehl, while hardly asked to leap through huge dramatic hoops, does just fine amongst these greater actors...and  I suppose if you're one of those who voted her "Sexiest Woman Alive," you'll probably enjoy her a great deal.<br /><br />But somehow, the movie remains distant emotionally in telling the romance.  We just don't CARE all that much.  Yes, we want the good guys to win and the bad guys to get their comeuppance.  But not in a deep way.  No tears are shed.  The movie spends so much time EXAMINING things...the illusions, the schemes, the political machinations...that it forgets to just let emotion run free a bit.  It's very controlled and has a leisurely pace.<br /><br />I admire it a great deal, and recommend it.  It's PG-13, but except for one brief "bedroom" scene with Norton and Biehl that isn't terribly explicit, I think it could almost have been PG.  Don't expect to be blown away, but do enjoy being taken to another time and another mindset for 2 hours.</p></br><a href="../users/A32XW50ILWOXNO.html">A32XW50ILWOXNO</a><br/><p>"The Illusionist" bills itself as a turn-of-century head trip of narrative twists and inexplicable sorcery. And while the last half of the movie is an elaborate con, the true strength of writer/director Neil Burger's film is a simple romantic tale of love lost and found, featuring quartet of effective performances - including one from Jessica Biel.<br /><br />Yes, Jessica Biel, who adds a little acting to go with those lips and that hair. She's Sophie, a Hungarian countess who discovers a "forbidden" lover has become Eisenheim The Illusionist (Edward Norton). Eisenheim's tricks are seamless. It's also too quick for the magic-savvy crowds of Vienna, who can't unravel just how he grows that orange tree, or manages to freeze the sword of Austrian Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell) so that no "unworthy" man can tug it off the ground.<br /><br />Leopold considers himself a divine intellectual above any trickery he can`t figure out, so he orders Chief Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti) to shut Eisenheim down. By then, Sophie, who promises to marry the prince as part of a plan to overthrow Leopold's father, has shared a forbidden carriage ride with Eisenheim, and is ripe to share his bed, too.<br /><br />"Do you really want to disappear with me?" he asks her.<br /><br />"The Illusionist" then shifts into its hour-long final act, which involves a murder, jewels and voodoo magic that has the peasants rioting. Berger adapted Steven Millhauser's short story and added the romantic angle while flattening the depth of Inspector Uhl, rescued by Giamatti with mild humor and humility.<br /><br />Berger's twist - the "turn" in magician-speak -  is clever but predictable. "The Illusionist" has too gentle a soul - and too modest an aim - to end any other way,  but it works because Norton and Biel generate an understated chemistry; there's a lot of passion under their benign, expressionless faces.  Norton's is nobody's first choice as a romantic lead, which makes him more effective as a magician. Biel effectively plays against type as Sophie; what attracts her to Eisenheim is not his looks or fortune, but his sway over the mysteries of the world. She's captivated by his gifts, and Biel, a superficial actor until now, holds her own with the intimidating, enigmatic Norton.<br /><br />And finally, there is Leopold. Sewell is a magnificent Sunday ham,  marrying unbridled evil with anguished martyrdom - "I've done everything I can! Too much!" -  to create one of those pathetic ego monsters that echoes Peter Sellers and Christopher Walken. Inspector Clouseau, meet the King of New York.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>Thanks in large part to very fine performances by the three leads, `The Illusionist' stands apart from most films released in the early part of the year as a true cinematic treat.  I had wanted to see this film upon it's release but was unable due to the fact that it was released in very few theaters and only for a short time (at least in my area) but I was able to find it in stock at my local video store last night and was immediately spellbound by the direction this movie took.  I'm tempted to say that this was even more intoxicating than `The Prestige', but I'm yet to make up my mind.<br /><br />Telling the story of undying love set in Vienna as renowned illusionist Eisenheim (Edward Norton) is reunited with his long lost love Duchess Sophie (Jessica Biel), `The Illusionist' does a brilliant job of building character and delivering enough twists and turns to keep you intrigued.  Eisenheim grew up the son of a carpenter, poor and banned from seeing his love Sophie.  He leaves town and swears to come back for her, but they are not reunited until 15-years later when she is promised to marry the Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell) a man known not only for his ideas of ruining a nation and overthrowing his fathers rule but also for his hot temper towards the women in his life.<br /><br />After their chance meeting both Eisenheim and Sophie devise a plan to be together but their plan is quickly being ruined by Leopold and his Chief Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti) who is hot on their tail every step of the way.  When Sophie turns up dead it seems as if their plan has been stopped, but now a more pressing task is at hand, trying to find her killer.  In a game of wits Eisenheim and Uhl expertly combat one another and bring so much life to this film it's almost impossible not to become entranced.<br /><br />Edward Norton has always been one of my favorite actors, and here is no exception as he embraces his role and commands his performance, but he's upstaged every time by Paul Giamatti who just dominates every scene.  Just watch them interact at the restaurant, sitting across from one another and conversing, it's flawless, intimidating and utterly captivating.  Take a close look at two masters of their profession delivering the goods.  Jessica Biel must also be singled out for the maturity she brings to her character.  She has truly grown up since `7th Heaven' and deserves all the praise and even accolades she's received because of this, and Rufus Sewell is equally impressive as the oppressive and unlikable Leopold.<br /><br />Beautifully shot, like an old painting, and splendidly brought to life by a talented cast (just listen to the accents, not one of them seems forced or out of place...a true testament to their strength as actors), `The Illusionist' is more than likely one of the finest films of the past year and deserves our utmost attention.  I feel strongly that had this film been released in November or early December it would have made a strong showing in the Oscar race for from the script to the acting to the directing to the strength of the picture itself it truly is a fantastic experience.

Eisenhiem (Norton), has learned so much that he can trick and convince even the harshest critics and cynics, going so far as to upstage a crown prince, Leopold, the man in line for the crown, and the man vying for Biel's hand in marriage.  Eisenhiem seems to be one step ahead at all times, ready for the inquisitive and the doubters, even the Inspector General, the man who is supposed to know all secrets of the area.<br /><br />What eventually happens is that the Prince orders the Inspector General, Uhl, to shut down Eisenhiem's show, because the Prince doesn't like the competition.  While doing so, however, he pushes the love-triangle ahead, causing a death, some unbelievable magic (conjuring of spirits) that sways the masses, and a devious, albeit somewhat forseeable twist, that is sure to entertain.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CQON0P01BITL.html">A1CQON0P01BITL</a><br/><p>Remember it's an illusion!!!<br /><br />Great Movie!!!<br /><br />Great Ending!!!</p></br><a href="../users/AW99SBGWEXP0J.html">AW99SBGWEXP0J</a><br/><p>Eisenheim the Illusionist (Norton) is taking Vienna by storm.  The year is 1900, and Eisen heim is so talented that his tricks are so good that his audience believes him to be supernatural.  In fact, they may not be wrong.  Crown Prince Leopold (Sewell) is a doubter though, and he gives Chief Inspector Uhl (Giamatti) the task of proving him a fraud.  At a performance, Leopold sends his fianc&eacute;e Princess Sophie (Biel) to the stage as a volunteer.  Little does he know that Sophie and Eisenheim were in love as children, and this reunion will rekindle their romance.  This only intensifies Leopold's determination to end Eisenheim's act for good.<br /><br />Edward Norton is perfect as Eisenheim.  He makes the character likeable and even a little mysterious.  On the opposite end of the spectrum, Rufus Sewell makes Leopold a character that is easy to hate.  Biel and Giamatti deliver solid supporting performances as well.  The story is great, keeping the audience guessing about Eisenheim's gifts until the final minutes.  I recommend finding a theater near you that is playing "The Illusionist", and check it out.</p></br><a href="../users/A27CHILBK6HIL2.html">A27CHILBK6HIL2</a><br/><p>MOVIE: I walked into The Illusionist not expecting much, mostly because it had Jessica Biel in a serious role, but I was pleasently surprised by this period/fantasy piece. The film is from director Niel Burger and this is his sophomore directing attempt. The film is told through third person narrative from Paul Giammatti's character. The film opens as the Chief Inspector (Giammatti) is having a meeting with Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell). The audience learns that Eisenheim The Illusionist (Edward Norton) is threatening the power of the Crown Prince and may uncover the secret plot to overthrow the King. So, at this point the Chief Inspector tells the story of Eisenheim and we return back to the meeting scene later in the film's third act. The story is Shakespearean in that Eisenheim falls in love with Sophie (Jessica Biel) who is a girl in a much higher social class than he is. After he is forbidden to see her, he departs on a journey where he learns the tricks of being a performer and takes the stage name of Eisenheim The Illusionist. The story has been done, but the film was well executed. The time and setting also bring a fresh approach to this tried and true love story, plus we have the theme of illusion. We quickly learn that things are not what they seem as the power craving Crown Prince plans to overthrow the King and forcefully marry Sophie in order to do so. The film's ending is quite predictable, or at least you know that there is going to be a twist ending even though you may not figure it out. There is also the fact that the narrative structure of the film was incredibly confusing. I didn't figure out that the story was told through Giammatti's character as a flashback until we came back to the present. It seems like a pretty standard linear story, but every now and then Giammatti's character will pop in and narrate for two minutes then dissapear. It happens maybe 3 or 4 times in the entire movie, which makes it very confusing and awkward. However, the film is visually stunning. The sets and the costumes are particularly breathtaking and really captivate the audience. Look for a costume nomination come Oscar time, I'm calling it right now.<br /><br />ACTING: Okay, plain and simple, Paul Giammatti outweighs all the other actors and steals the show with a brilliant performance. This is his best work since Sideways and he proves once again that he is an amazing character actor. Edward Norton is very good as well, but he is sort of drowned out by Giammatti. Unfortunetly Jessica Biel still can't act and can't hold a Dutch accent if her life depended on it. Rufus Sewell is delightfully evil as always as the Crown Prince. Seems like he will be playing the bad guy for the rest of his life, but at least he's good at it.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Some confusing plot structure in the narration and uneven acting in the supporting roles hinder the film. However, the movie itself is a visual feast, its lavish sets and incredible costume design really create the perfect atmosphere that makes The Illusionist worth your while.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TWTULVD6F22O.html">A1TWTULVD6F22O</a><br/><p>All rightie.<br /><br />We're going to have two films about magicians this year.  Check.<br /><br />"The Illusionist" stars Edward Norton and Rufus Sewell, "The Prestige" stars Hugh Jackman and Christopher Bale.  Advantage, "The Prestige".....although Norton is usually hard to beat.<br /><br />Character is contributed by Paul Giamatti in "The Illusionist", and Michael Caine in "The Prestige".  Advantage, "The Illusionist".  Rationale?  Giamatti may be the best character actor in the business today, despite Caine's long and dignified track record.<br /><br />Eye Candy.  "The Illusionist"...Jessica Biel, this year's "It" girl.  "The Prestige" has Scarlett Johansson, the "It" girl from two years ago.  Hmmm...a draw?  Not really. Johansson is a truly gifted actress, with real acting chops. Advantage, "The Prestige".<br /><br />Script source?  "The Illusionist"....a fine short story.  "The Prestige"....a book, but screenplay is by the impeccable Chris Nolan (Memento, Batman Begins)....advantage, "The Prestige."<br /><br />Director?  "The Illusionist"; Neil Burger.  Who? Who?<br /><br />"The Prestige"....Chris Nolan.  Big advantage, "The Prestige".<br /><br />I haven't seen "The Prestige" yet, and this review is about "The Illusionist".  The "Illusionist" is an enjoyable film that could have been so much more in the hands of a different director.  Beautifully acted, costumes and cinematography are brilliant.  Vienna on film is foreboding (despite the fact that it was really Prague).  The sound is horrible, and the sepia tone (to brand this a period piece) was overstated.  Virtually none of the film is constructed by action, it is all dialogue.  Definitely, these are all marks of a first-time director.  And Rufus Sewell's mustache is atrocious (I did love his hall of animal racks, however...it was truly ludicrous).  I was drawn to the film and taken in by the plot and what might have been for this film.  Despite the slow pacing, (and a remarkable lack of chemistry between Biel and Norton)it managed to overcome most of the deficiencies.  Giamatti is impeccable here, now brisk, brittle and corrupt, now completely open to the magic, with a physical need to know just how the tricks are produced.  He's compiling a treasure chest of work on film.<br /><br />Would I see it again?  Yes, on DVD.  Would I recommend it to others? ...Yes, I suppose.  Was it memorable?...oh, yes.  Do I expect "The Prestige" to be better?...oh heck yeah.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R602SXNGOMJ4.html">A1R602SXNGOMJ4</a><br/><p>Edward Norton is an absolutely brilliant actor and he's also very nice on the eyes.  To be honest, I didn't really like this movie, apart from Norton's acting.  I just found that the movie dragged on and on.  When the movie ended I had to shake my head because there was such a plot twist at the end and I didn't see it coming at all.  That part was so well done.  It's too bad that the rest of the film wasn't as interesting.  It's not a perfect film but it is intriguing enough to have you watching the whole film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1P2NBM3P3TS2X.html">A1P2NBM3P3TS2X</a><br/><p>Interesting premise that never quite achieves its potential narratively or cinematically.  And the special illusions that Norton's character performs onstage aren't really that interesting anyway.<br /><br />This film, like "The Prestige", never quite fires on all cylinders.<br /><br />Rufus Sewell is quite good in this, though.  His character is far more interesting than those of the movie's two leads.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GPEV42IO41CI.html">A2GPEV42IO41CI</a><br/><p>It is 1900 in Vienna, and the Chief Inspector (Paul Giamatti) is telling the story of a peasant boy who was once the secret playmate and love of little Countess Sophie; they planned to run away together, but their plan was discovered and they were separated.  The boy traveled the world and learned the secrets of magic, returning  home as "Eisenheim, the Illusionist" (Edward Norton).  He is reunited with the Countess (Jessica Biel) again, quite by accident, during one of his shows and they resume their romance, even though she is soon to marry the ruthless Crown Prince (Rufus Sewell).<br /><br />One never knows for sure what is real or illusion in this story, and it kept me guessing until the last scene.  Norton's powerful and  charismatic performance carries the film.  He has the piercing glare and smug confidence of someone who knows all the secrets and is quietly controlling all the action.  Giamatti's character is oddly compassionate and kind-hearted for someone with his power.  He should have been more menacing, like Sewell's completely odious Prince.  Both Giamatti and Norton attempt unconvincing European accents, the story is too long, and it would have been better with more romance, but I still enjoyed it.  The period sets and costumes are lovely and those who love magic will be delighted.</p></br><a href="../users/A1129LM24YWSZV.html">A1129LM24YWSZV</a><br/><p>The Illusionist tells the story of Eisenheim (Edward Norton), a magician, who arrives in Vienna with his manager and opens a show. Audiences are astounded by the illusions he performs - making an orange tree grow before their eyes, levitating things, etc. Hearing of these magnificent feats from an impressed Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti), the Crown Prince (Rufus Sewell) decides to attend a performance, bringing with him his soon-to-be fiancee Sophie (Jessica Biel). (Unbeknownst to the Crown Prince, Eisenheim and Sophie were childhood sweethearts.) Convinced that he can debunk Eisenheim's tricks, the Crown Prince demands a private royal performance, and the magician obliges. However, once gathered before the royalty and the court, the Crown Prince is unable to explain away Eisenheim's masterful illusions.<br /><br />Perturbed by the magician, the Crown Prince sends Inspector Uhl to find out more about this magician and how he performs such wonders. During the investigation, Uhl himself develops a healthy respect for Eisenheim, even as he learns that the magician has rekindled his affair with Sophie.<br /><br />Although you'll see the ending coming, this is a great movie. What makes it worth it: the performances of Norton and Giamatti. (Particularly, Norton's lovesick magician. I only wish that being apart from me could inspire such anguish in a man.) The effects in Eisenheim's stage shows are nice as well, and I like it that the magician's secrets are not divulged. Also, I love how the script comments on some rather weighty issues. Eisenheim introduces each trick with a philosophical exposition, which serves as set-up, distraction, and fodder for the mind. Through these introductions (and via the plotline itself) movie plays with the notion of death, the idea of truth and falsehood (i.e. fraud), topics of politics/power, and the significance of public opinion.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>I avoided "The Illusionist" for a long time. I like Edward Norton, I think Paul Giamatti is great, but how can anyone take any film with Jessica Biel playing a 19th Century Viennese Countess seriously? This is such a calculated move on everyone's part, it turned me off. The filmmakers were obviously looking for a pretty actress, with some name recognition, that they could afford. Biel was obviously looking for a film that would show "I'm a serious actress". Then, the reviews for Norton were lukewarm, so I had even more reason to stay away.<br /><br />During a family visit, the only film I hadn't seen that my mom and step dad would see was "The Illusionist". While Norton is rather lackluster and Biel doesn't fit, the film has a very stylized look making it worth a look as a bargain matinee or on DVD.<br /><br />Eisenheim (Norton), a magician, makes a triumphant return to Vienna, his hometown, after touring the world and earning a reputation for himself. He mesmerizes the audience with his illusions, including Chief Inspector Uhl (Giamatti). Soon, Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell) hears of the magician and attends the performance with his fianc&eacute;e, Sophie (Biel). Asking for a volunteer, Eisenheim brings Sophie on stage and performs a trick. Later, he reminds her that they were once friends, as children. Eisenheim learns Sophie is unhappy and doesn't want to marry the Crown Prince, a man with a questionable past and a history of violence towards women. But what can Eisenheim do to correct the situation?<br /><br />Written and directed by Neil Burger, "The Illusionist", based on a short story by Steven Millhauser, is an interesting film to watch. Sepia tones flood every frame, given it the appearance of the old daguerreotypes. Throughout, Burger uses a number of old fashioned editing techniques, giving the film the appearance of an old silent film. Both of these elements, and the settings, combine to make for an almost lovely film.<br /><br />But then he has to deal with the actors and he is less successful on that front. Edward Norton has done some great work in his previous films, but As Eisenheim he seems almost lifeless. There are brief moments when he shows conflict, or emotion, but these are few and far between. From an actor with the talent of Norton, this is a disappointment. Norton is one of those actors who used to show so much promise, people called him the next Brando or Lancaster, but he hasn't shown that type of range or skill since "The Italian Job", a film he was forced to participate in because of a contractual obligation. If you want to go back to his last intense role that would probably have to be "American History X".<br /><br />Biel is, if anything, acceptable. But I can't help but imagine what an actress with the skill of Julianne Moore or Laura Linney might have done with the role. Yes, they are each too old, but their talent would have transformed this character. As it is, Biel is required to do little than stand around and look wistful. Thankfully, she doesn't try to do much of an accent. I get the feeling that would have transformed the film into high camp.<br /><br />Paul Giamatti is interesting as Chief Inspector Uhl, a man who initially welcomes the performances of Eisenheim, but when the Crown Prince recognizes the danger of the magician, quickly turns against the illusionist. Uhl is under the control of the Crown Prince and must do what he wants. Throughout, Giamatti manages to convey the characters conflict of emotions and feelings. But during the last few minutes, as Giamatti realizes the games that have been perpetuated upon him, he stares to the heavens as the camera circles him. As realization dawns, he claps, once. Leaving the theater, I remarked that he thankfully kept the clapping to a minimum. The one clap is corny enough, but to have the clapping continue and have Uhl remark "Bravo!", well, once again, we are approaching high camp.<br /><br />"The Illusionist" is an interesting film for the visuals, and this makes it worth a look at bargain matinee prices. Or perhaps on DVD. I doubt you will find little of interest in the actor's performances.</p></br><a href="../users/A25HYPL2XKQPZB.html">A25HYPL2XKQPZB</a><br/><p>While watching THE ILLUSIONIST, I couldn't help but compare it to another movie that came out in the fall of 2006, THE PRESTIGE. Both films featured magicians at the turn of the century. Both are amazing to watch, the cinematography takes you to another world. The acting is top notch in THE PRESTIGE, but in the ILLUSIONIST, Edward Norton as the great Eisenhiem, seems very wooden and his accent is also annoying.<br /><br />THE PRESTIGE featured plot twists after plot twists, the movie constantly shifted and left you feeling confused at the end. THE ILLUSIONIST moves slowly, taking its time to tell its story of love. Eisenhiem and Sophie (Jessica Beil) knew each other as children, but because they were from different social classes, they could never be together. Eisenheim returns after a 15 year absence and finds Sophie is soon to be engaged to the future emperor of Austria, the Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell.)<br /><br />Leopold doesn't want the two to be together and a confrontation ensues. Paul Giamatti plays the police inspector who has a lot to gain by shutting Eisenhiem down, but knows what an evil person Sewell's character can be. While THE PRESTIGE is a complex movie that focuses on magic and the extent magic and deception can be used to manipulate lives, THE ILLUSIONIST is really a love story with magic only coming into play occasionally.<br /><br />The Illusionist tells a simple story with a twist at the end. The twist didn't shock me, I saw it coming. It was believable and made the monotonous hour and a half before it that much more enjoyable. This is a good movie to rent, but one you won't really want to watch more than once, so I don't recommend buying it.</p></br><a href="../users/A15YPJLKLZS0MK.html">A15YPJLKLZS0MK</a><br/><p>An acclaimed illusionist captures all of Vienna and also Crown Prince.

He does a great job and frankly the only time the movie comes alive is when he's on screen. Second, the character actor playing Crown Prince Leopold's valet. He expresses anguish, shame and shock using nothing but body language and his eyes. Very good. The guy playing Leopold was fairly interesting and can look back on his role here without shame.<br /><br />Now, what's wrong? Edward Norton, sure he's a great actor but not in this flick. He spends the entire movie looking like he's got hemorrhoids. The flat voice, the stiff ooh don't make the itch and burn start up again walk, the dead eyed stare--- none of that looked like a man in love and there were times when I was laughing at him. Plus his accent weaved in and out worse than Kevin Costner as Robin Hood. Sometimes he sounded like an Austrian and sometimes he sounded like a dude from Idaho.<br /><br />Jessica Biel is a pretty girl and she really has nothing to do but look lovely in her role but she can't even do that. She seemed like an android. She walked and talked but was completely souless. Her version of Sophie wouldn't turn most men's heads for more than a night, the audience is asked to believe that this bland, stilted creature somehow held a man's heart for 15 years. Nah.<br /><br />Finally, the big reveal at the end made no darn sense. It was impossible. No good detective would've been fooled, the Romeo and Juliet potion was a cheap trick.</p></br><a href="../users/A32AK8FOAZEPE2.html">A32AK8FOAZEPE2</a><br/><p>but, of course, the death of a prince is quite realistic. if he didn't commit any murder, why he would convince himself that he commited a crime? an average movie, not a great movie at all. very slow tempo, loose script. the montage is too dark, trying to give you an ancient vienna feeling. too many and too much close-up shots. with computer generated graphics, everything you saw in this movie is nothing but. the romance is also quite luke warm and not well developed. watchable but on the other hand, also quite skipable and forgetable.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />A movie about magic can NEVER cheat the audience, but this one does egregiously (please tell me how Edward Norton makes the King's sword stick into the stage, thank you very much); add in a terrible performance by the uneven Edward Norton and uninspired photography, and what you get is a movie that has no reason for existing.</p></br><a href="../users/A4X7FBQ5SKPI6.html">A4X7FBQ5SKPI6</a><br/><p>Just stop what you are doing<br />Just stop considering this movie<br />Go watch The Prestige instead<br />It is so much better<br />but if you like Biel because she is hot<br />then by all means salivate away<br />the same goes for Norton<br />although I do not know why he was in this film, it is below his acting standards<br />Then again he was talking to himself and Brad Pitt in the horrible movie Fight club.

And this might not be a bad thing had the movie not taken itself so dreadfully serious. In fact to be honest, "The Illusionist" is the worst kind of film making: dull, sickeningly pretentious, overstuffed visually and pompously acted. Even the excellent Edward Norton, who can usually do no wrong, is caught up in all the declamatory, melodrama style of acting on exhibit here. To top it all off Phillip Glass borrows many themes from his irritating score of "The Hours" which underscores and sometimes over scores what little action there is in this static bore of a film.<br />Despite all of this, the actual bare bones story is unusual and interesting having to do with reality/illusion, love/desire, sexual attraction and the walls between social classes that existed in turn of the century Vienna. Director Neil Burger's take on all this is simply just wrong. In a nutshell: if your story is tricky, complicated, mysterious, etc...you had better make all the window dressing, including the acting, very straightforward and pure devoid of old-style stage gesticulations and overly dramatic musical crescendos. Burger, of course does just the opposite and what we have then is once again: an excellent cast miss-used, an interesting story miss-directed...another case of great aspirations turned into a big, over-fed, corpulent sow of a movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ.html">A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ</a><br/><p>The Illusionist has to be one of the most underrated movies of the year. I hadn't heard very much hype about it and the trailer didn't really send me running out to see it, but after watching it, I think it was one of the best movies of 2006.<br /><br />Edward Norton, Paul Giamatti, Rufus Sewell, and even Jessica Biel all turned in remarkable performances throughout the film. The entire supporting cast steps up as well. The cinematography was equally stunning, as was the story, which stays intriguing until the very last frame.<br /><br />The Illusionist is a romantic drama, a thriller, a mystery, and a period piece all in one, and it never leans too heavily on any of the genres in order to skate by. It lives in all these realms, but it also lives in its own independent category.<br /><br />The special features on the DVD were pretty meager: a making of featurette, and then a "Jessica Biel on the Illusionist" featurette that was really just the same comments she made in the making of featurette edited down to a shorter version. The film itself is so amazing that the DVD doesn't really need any extras, although it would be nice to get a more in depth look at Edward Norton's preperation for the role, and the magicians that trained him.</p></br><a href="../users/AAU7CAQIN5BAE.html">AAU7CAQIN5BAE</a><br/><p>Ordinarly not a film I would, under most instances, choose to sit down and watch, however "The Illusionist", like an earlier reviewer 'Bu-chan' said, was one that I "surprisingly enjoyed a hell of a lot."  Something I would not have ordinarly have rented or bought in a whim, but was surprised by its rich and elegant manner of purity. I was away probably in the jungle or backpacking Prague when this came out.<br /><br />This gentle, immaculate and restrained fable about true love, strength and subterfuge in Vienna is tremendously imagined and yet strangely stagnant. I love movies that sort of come out of nowhere and knock you out a bit because you really didn't expect it to be so well done. A real gem it was. A masterpiece of acting. Simply top notch characters with believable dialog and Jessica Biel is simply stunning, magically gorgeous and her acting in the period with everyone else in a rich, enticing mesmorizing plot and storyline, is true to all the characters never breaking rank from the period and THAT is a nod for our friend Neil Berger...<br /><br />...Paul Giamatti (Cinderella Men, American Splendor!!, Lady in The Water) is tremendous. When you can shine in a film where totality of brilliant acting can be achieved through an engrossing script and a tremendous ensemble, we can see the craft come through without effort. Seemingly flowing from their air of professionalism, and brought to us to delve into and disappear in their world. Now that is acting.</p></br><a href="../users/A2M5FI4CB6VUXF.html">A2M5FI4CB6VUXF</a><br/><p>Whoever wrote this movie was definitely in a zone to which every writer should aspire but few truly reach. I was admittedly bored with the pace of this story from time to time, but the brilliant acting of Edward Norton and Jessica Biel (to say nothing of Paul Giamatti and others) was positively enrapturing! I couldn't have turned this movie off if I had tried. I kept wanting to know what would happen next.<br /><br />I'm usually very good about seeing an ending coming. I can honestly say I did NOT see this ending coming. Anyone that did is a much better movie watcher than I! Or maybe you're just psychic. Either way, my enjoyment of this movie reached its peak when I was slapped in the face by this wonderfully surprising ending.<br /><br />I do think they could have developed some characters a bit more, but perhaps the mystery was part of the point. MAYBE that's what allows the viewer to become such a prisoner to this movie. So I'm torn. But I was also completely entertained! I knew NOTHING of this movie before viewing it but wow!

But since elegantly civilized entertainments are in short supply these days, I won't be too hard on it. With the magnificent help of cinematographer Dick Pope and production designer Ondrej Nekvasil, Burger crafts a somber, rich and romantic mystery based on Steven Millhauser's short story about Eisenheim, a brilliant magician in 1900 Vienna, who tries to reclaim Sophie, his aristocratic, long-lost love. However, the treacherous Crown Prince Leopold wants Sophie as his consort, and orders the assiduous Chief Inspector Uhl to rid the empire of Eisenheim, by any means possible. What follows is a compelling cat-and-mouse game that touches on the eternal mysteries of existence, and at its best leaves the audience truly breathless with its artful legerdemain. Unfortunately, the story's denouement, while clever, is more prosaic than what Burger led us to expect. But the film's sheer craftsmanship makes it more than worth seeing, particularly since the stars are Edward Norton and Paul Giamatti, two actors who improve any film simply by virtue of appearing in it. Norton, an actor whose eyes reflect unplumbed depths in every role he plays, is the perfect choice for Eisenheim. Giamatti, famous for playing neurotics and boy-men, here plays a character of cool, cerebral intelligence, and does so with commanding presence and voice. Their face-offs are the best part of the movie, and they play them like fencing masters, with elegance and flourish. As Sophie, Jessica Biel is sensuously lovely and dewy-fresh, which is exactly what she needs to be. As Crown Prince Leopold, Rufus Sewell smolders with dark menace, a worthy inheritor of the mantle of the late Oliver Reed. Fans of historical romance and supernatural mystery will find "The Illusionist" a memorable, if not quite unforgettable, example of both genres.</p></br><a href="../users/A18G7GG53G2X8A.html">A18G7GG53G2X8A</a><br/><p>When a dazzled audience watches a magician at work, the one question that goes through everyone's mind is, "How did he do that?" It's interesting such a question would be raised at all, considering most of us really don't want to know; we mentally examine the methodology behind the illusions, yet we understand that if the secrets are revealed, the greatness of the moment is lost. It's a good thing most professional magicians refuse to be so open; giving away an illusion's secret reduces entertainment to a mere technicality. The same can be said for movies, specifically movies about magic. The television ads for "The Illusionist" tell the viewers to not give away the film's secret. True to its word, it does have more than a couple of tricks up its sleeve. And much like a magic trick, each sequence builds on another until a rather elaborate twist ending is reached. At that point, the audience is completely wowed.<br /><br />I say this in spite of the fact that it's not the most original of twist endings. The story is also a bit formulaic, relying on well-established characterizations and assumable outcomes for advancement. However, I found that I could look past these shortcomings; it's quite an entertaining film, effectively mixing mystery with a solid romance. There are also some very good performances, no small feat considering all three leads had to fake believable European accents. It was especially surprising in terms of Edward Norton; his role called for a suave, sophisticated demeanor, pretty much to the point of seeming emotionless. I initially had my doubts that he could pull it off. But as with many of his other roles, he's proven himself capable of rising to the occasion.<br /><br />Based on Steven Millhauser's short story "Eisenheim the Illusionist," the film's components are loosely like those of a fable. Fables are often basic, using shorter formats and simpler language as a way of conveying a moral to a wide audience. While "The Illusionist" has no moral, it does make use of tried and true storytelling methods to get its point across. We have the forbidden love between two classes of people and what they endure in an attempt to live happily ever after. We have the villain who will stop at nothing to keep the incurable lovebirds apart. We have the clever, handsome, enigmatic hero. We have the skeptical side characters. Most importantly, we have entertaining acts of illusion that deceive us just as much as they deceive the characters.<br /><br />The plot in and of itself is constructed less like a fable and more like a mystery novel. Set in early twentieth century Vienna, the story centers on the mysterious stage magician Eisenheim (Edward Norton), a man whose grace and charm can bewitch an audience the moment he steps on stage. He was first introduced to magic as a teenager (played by Aaron Johnson). Back then, he was nothing more than the peasant son of a cabinet maker. Then one day, he meets a wandering magician sitting under a tree. From then on, he's a completely different person, devoting all his free time to perfecting the art and craft of magic tricks. And what a time to learn; his skills attract the attention of Sophie von Teschen (played as a teenager by Eleanor Tomlinson), a wealthy young girl of high social stature. As you can probably imagine, the enevitable romance is strictly forbidden. Ultimately, the two are forcefully separated.<br /><br />Fifteen years later, Eisenheim is back in Austria after having travelled the world in the study of magic. He is rapidly becoming one of the country's most popular illusionists, thrilling audiences with his impeccable sense of timing and style. He can make an orange tree grow from an empty pot. He can make a reflection behave differently than the real person. He can even make coins appear out of a red handkerchief. Word of his astounding illusions quickly reaches Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell), the arrogant, immature successor to the throne of Austria. He decides to attend one of the magician's shows. However, it's not because he wants be entertained; rather, he wants to expose Eisenheim as a fraud by purposely trying to poke holes in the act. It would seem that only he has such an agenda. Everyone else, he's astonished to discover, is actually willing to enjoy the show.<br /><br />At this point, the plot thickens dramatically. The Prince's intended is none other than Sophie von Teschen (now played by Jessica Biel), and when attending the performance with her fiancee, she finds herself assisting Eisenheim in one of his tricks. Right away, the two recognize each other from their childhoods, and old feelings resurface. The two begin an intesnse love affair, one the audience knows will end very badly if discovered. Unfortunately, Leopold rules everything with an iron fist, especially when it comes to marriage. Bodyguards and spies keep a close eye on Sophie on a regular basis, and her romance with Eisenheim is impossible to conceal.<br /><br />Determined to ruin the magician's reputation, Leopold hires Chief Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti) to keep Eisenheim at bay. Uhl is of a shrewd and practical sort, always looking for the most logical explanation when conducting an investigation. He applies himself fully when it comes to deconstructing Eisenheim's tricks, which are impressive to say the least. At times, Uhl's rational mind is overshadowed by the need to believe; never mind logic and reason. Throughout the course of the film, it becomes one of his most challenging obstacles, and he's eventually forced to choose between loyalty to his country and the desire to expose the truth.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I can't describe any more of the plot. Keep in mind that this is a mystery, and far too many important details--ones that directly relate to the plot twist--are at stake. What I can say is that Eisenheim's simple sleight-of-hand illusions are eventually discarded for the ability to call forth dead spirits. This ability earns him a devoted following, one that puts a serious damper on Uhl's investigation and Leopold's vindictiveness. Like in all good mysteries, it eventually becomes a matter of putting the pieces together to form a clear picture.<br /><br />I realize that the previous paragraph was incredibly vague, but short of giving everything away, there's really no other way to say it. I'd rather you go and see the film for yourself. There's so much about it that works, especially the final scenes; they're appropriately sequenced, serving as a testament to the trickery magicians are known for. A lot of audiences don't like being fooled at the movies these days; they seem to think that fooling is only appropriate in live magic shows, where they actually look forward to asking, "How did he do that?" Not only does "The Illusionist" have all the best qualities of a live magic show, it also effectively reinterprets the classic Love Conquers All fable. I enjoyed this movie; it's clever, it's sneaky, and it delightfully toys with the audience's beliefs.</p></br><a href="../users/AUUH6Z8MSGGF.html">AUUH6Z8MSGGF</a><br/><p>The Illusionist<br />Blu-Ray/DVD Combo Pack<br /><br />Newly released on Blu-Ray on June 8th, "The Illusionist" was originally released in 2006 and was written and directed by Neil Burger based on the short story, "Eisenheim the Illusionist" written by Steven Millhauser. Edward Norton plays the great illusionist, Eisenheim who finds his childhood love, Sophie played by Jessica Biel is engaged to Crown Prince Leopold played by Rufus Sewell. The city's Chief Inspector Uhl and the prince become obsessed with Eisenheim's association with Sophie and how his illusions are done until a mysterious crime takes place and a major investigation begins.<br /><br />The special effects are amazing in this movie and the Blu-Ray quality only adds to the magic. The acting is pretty top-notch bringing American, English, and German actors all towards a soft Viennese accent. Edward Norton is wonderfully guarded and mysterious throughout the film and learned some of the hand trickery from actual magicians. Paul Giamatti is characteristically gruff, but at times difficult to understand and awkward. His eyes say volumes about what his lines don't reveal. Jessica Biel is beautiful and keeps it simple which seems to be the best way to play it in this case. This was one of her first roles outside the norm of popular romantic comedy and television fare. Rufus Sewell has an admirable performance as the villain, all of whose lines could be taken as guilty or innocent, but he could have been a little more menacing or crazy. The story is like a well-played chess game with Eisenheim always a few steps ahead of his pursuers and a very enjoyable ride.<br /><br />Bonus Features:<br /><br />The bonus features are ONLY on the DVD, not the Blu-Ray disc. They include feature length commentary with writer/director Niel Burger, the Making of The Illusionist, and Jessica Biel on the Illusionist. The commentary by Burger is very interesting since he explains how each illusion would be done and points out some historical facts about the shooting location and its connections to Archduke Ferdinand whose death began World War I.<br /><br />The making of featurette is less than four minutes long and it is just a series of the main actors explaining their characters and the plot. The Jessica Biel segment has the same interviews as in the "making of" featurette with a few more seconds of her saying she sought out the film since it was the next type of project she wanted to do and lasts less than two minutes.<br /><br />This combo allows you to get what is already available on DVD with no further extras, except a Blu-Ray disc with fantastic picture to make the illusions even more illusion-y!</p></br><a href="../users/ALG7QH2L5JL2L.html">ALG7QH2L5JL2L</a><br/><p>Even though it is already out on DVD, I'm glad I saw it on a proper cinema screen. No doubt I'll get the DVD, but it's one of those flicks you'd want to see at 'the movies' at least once.<br /><br />Warning: SPOILERS FOLLOW, but nothing that gives the plot away too much.<br /><br />It's difficult to add to the good things said about this movie, but I'll try, leaving the most important bits till last.<br /><br />About the cinematography. Beautifully done, but not cloyingly so, or in a way that makes it get in the way of the story. After the intro, which is rather long and arty--this isn't a criticism, just an observation--the images become unobtrusive. The way it was done was reminiscent of the way Ridley Scott used images in The Duellists; effectively and many had the quality of paintings, but they always enhanced and never distracted or occasioned that annoying "what great cinematography" effect, which usually takes you out of the story for sometimes distractingly long periods.<br /><br />The story. It matters, but the whole effect of the 'surprise' has been overemphasized in most reviews that talk about it. It's not about sudden revelation, but about completion of a carefully spun web is deception. Personally, I wasn't surprised, and I wasn't looking to be surprised. I just loved the way things came together in complete closure--not just Eisenheim's deception, but also the strands of inevitable cosmic justice and a sense of final equipoise and closure. Anybody watching with any amount of sensitivity should see it all coming, and those who don't see it will still sense it. It's all very subtly done; and as such it creeps up on you, and you don't even know consciously that it's there. So, it's not the 'surprise', such as there is, that matters, but the wholeness of it all and the watching of it unfold.<br /><br />The whole 'mystery' thing and its 'supernatural aspects was also been overemphasized in many reviews. There is, to my mind, no suggestion that an interpretation allowing for a life-after-death explication of the whole story was intended. If anybody thinks there is, they should consider themselves a part of those members of Eisenheim's audiences who thought that his tricks were evidence for the survival of the spirit. This is evidenced clearly by a single and unambiguous statement of Eisenheim to Sophie, which was as much a declaration of his love for her as it was a denial of the validity of the 'supernaturalist' or 'spiritualist' interpretation of his tricks and the denouement of the story. Reason why people miss it, is that the context of the statement distracts from its significance with regards to other areas. It's one of the ways in which this movie is very subtle and devious about revealing itself. A truly masterful script.<br /><br />There's a social theme interleaved into all of this, usually described as being a 'class' issue. I would not put it that crassly. It does however have to do with democracy, in the sense of the notion that in some way everybody has a right to be heard, no matter their social standing may be. This again is brought out clearly in the Crown Prince's final soliloquy, when faced with Inspector Uhl's revelations and his imminent fall from grace. Here, too, though, subtlety and focus on character took the place of pat social proselytizing.<br /><br />Romance is the driving force of the movie. Nothing at all would have 'happened', and Eisenheim would never have returned to Vienna, had it not been for Sophie.<br /><br />Eisenheim: I was meant to return. I just... I kept thinking I'll find around the next corner.<br />Sophie: What?<br />Eisenheim: A real mystery. I saw remarkable things but the only mystery I never solved was why my heart couldn't let go of you.<br /><br />Nothing more need to be said about that. The other stuff was just backdrop and devices. The fuel for the fire was love; not some social or spiritual agenda nonsense.<br /><br />In line with the rest of the movie, the one and only love/sex scene between Eisenheim and Sophie was both subtle and yet intense, both in terms of interaction as cinematography; making everything that happened there unabashedly romantic and therefore intensely erotic without requiring over-explicitness. There is an inherent difficulty in movies--and novels--where two characters come together in a love scene, as we know they must in order for things to proceed. (Unless the event is placed at the end as the denouement, but his was not the case here). The characters have to at least confess their love; probably do more and kiss; maybe go beyond that and 'consummate'. The danger of making this whole process almost perfunctory--as in it being necessary, and so it just has to be there; which takes a lot of the zing out of it--is great. And there's always the danger of there either being too little, which leaves the viewer unsatisfied, or too much--especially of explicit sex--which in this context would have been out of character for the tone of the film. There's also the danger of a love-scene just being a sex-scene; a common failing nowadays, in film and novel alike.<br /><br />The Illusionist gave us exactly what was needed. A lead-up which made us expect something of what was about to happen, but nobody quite knew what shape it would take; a coming together after the briefest of recrimination for a past disappointment; a panning away from the act itself with some fairly non-explicit and very creative pans across part of nude human anatomy; and, most importantly, an after-the-fact lingering, not just on the romance, but on how it connected to everything else, past, present and future, disappointments and hopes.  And never in all that was there a moment's doubt that this, and nothing else, was what the movie was all about. Which means we end up actually believing--even if a twitch of "oh, here it comes" is there at the start, with maybe a "are they going to screw this up?"--what these people are doing, and despite the apprehension lurking in some of us, like me, about being taken out of the story because this is another sex-scene, we come out of it realizing that it is in truth a love-scene and one that seamlessly connects to everything else in the story.<br /><br />Lastly, cynics be warned: The Illusionist is at its core a cunningly-disguised feel-good-movie. It doesn't have a cynical bone in its body, even though it doesn't see the world through rose-colored glasses either. But one doesn't have to, and one can still not be a cynic.<br /><br />There will, of course, be cynics who love this movie, though they'll probably strenuously deny that they were captured by its charm, rather than its intellectual messages, arty cinematography, crafty plot--or whatever cynics think they need to put up as good explanations for liking this flick. Sentimentality is unfashionable among the 'educated' and enlightened who know what's real and what isn't. The Illusionist is an excellent antidote to the poison of deluded intellectualism--ironically working its effect by a pretension of appeal to the intellect.</p></br><a href="../users/A1V3TRGWOMA8LC.html">A1V3TRGWOMA8LC</a><br/><p>I must have seen The Illusionist a dozen times by now and though I thought it was outstanding upon first viewing, I now think it stands as a classic in its own right. Apart from the pitch-perfect casting choices and the stand-out mesmerizing performance of Edward Norton, the film carries an unusual tone that's part romantic and part mystery, combining to create a sense of fantasy and false reality. For fans of The Prestige, although these were released around the same time, they are very different (and both excellent) films. For fans of Ed Norton or Paul Giamatti, both deliver outstanding performances and book-end a fascinating script that will make this a movie you find yourself coming back to.</p></br><a href="../users/AJRFZ0VZ0LD26.html">AJRFZ0VZ0LD26</a><br/><p>What happens with two people who find each other as children and deeply fall in love with each other?  A girl from a prosperous family and a boy, a son of a modest carpenter.  When two are separated in order to protect girl's propriety and define clear line between their two social classes, they do not see each other for 15 years.  Eventually, boy finds himself back in Vienna, this time in a role of a train magician and entertainer, while girl is being groomed to marry a crown prince of the Habsburg empire. Chance meeting between the two during the magic show, ignites the flame of the innocent love they once had for each other as young children.  And this is where film looses its pace.  How likely it is  that girl of noble upbringing and upper class would leave it all for a travelling illusionist?  What future would these two have, other than love for each other and no other prospects.  Story of commoner illusionist outwitting a royal soon becomes more a of fable of misguided love and scam where two love birds create elaborate scheme that will allow them to be together forever without ever being found by the royal family, friends or their parents.  While I liked Norton's and Giamatti's acting and their tender German accent, Biel is nothing more but a beautiful ornament in this film.  She is very pretty to look at, but her acting is quite plain.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DDPQ9342UNMY.html">A3DDPQ9342UNMY</a><br/><p>THE ILLUSIONIST is a satisfying magic show, but not quite up to the standards I expected. One factor that was especially disappointing: any discerning viewer could easily see what the final plot twist would be long before the secret is revealed. Still, it has a certain fascination for any fan of mystery and suspense, or Gothic detective stories involving the supernatural.<br /><br />EDWARD NORTON is Eisenheim, the magician who fascinates audiences with his clever sleight of hand and amazing tricks that seem to indicate he can bring to life dead spirits.<br /><br />PAUL GIAMATTI is effective as Inspector Uhl who doggedly determines to find out just what's going on behind the illusions, as much to placate his own need to know as it is to satisfy Crown Prince Leopold (RUFUS SEWELL) who has an agenda of his own for wanting the illusionist thrown into prison. It seems that his fianc&eacute; (JESSICA BIEL) has been a childhood sweetheart of the magician.<br /><br />Rufus Sewell gives the film's strongest performance as Crown Prince Leopold, with Norton appearing a bit uneasy in the pivotal role of the man behind the illusions.<br /><br />The film's biggest flaw is the last portion of the story, which has the inspector putting the pieces of the puzzle together as a last minute fix for the story's conclusion. It doesn't strike a truthful chord since the solution is much too intricate to be solved by fleeting fragments of the inspector's mind reviewing past events. It bears comparison to another recent film, THE PRESTIGE, which handled the same sort of material in an even more striking way.<br /><br />Summing up: Interesting, lots of atmosphere, beautifully photographed to capture the period with an appropriate background score by Paul Glass that is effective in setting the mood perfectly.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>The Illusionist (Neil Burger, 2006)<br /><br />I get the feeling that the principal dividing line in the very mixed reviews The Illusionist has garnered falls squarely in the province of whether you saw the end coming. I didn't, ad I liked it a great deal.<br /><br />Eisenheim (Edward Norton) is an illusionist. In flashback, we find out that as a young boy, he had a relationship with a girl well outside his station before the two of them were forcibly separated; fifteen years later, he returns to Vienna as an accomplished magician, and catches the eye of Leopold, the crown prince (Dark City's Rufus Sewell). Who is Leopold's betrothed? The same woman, of course, Sophie (Jessica Biel). Eisenheim and Sophie make advances toward picking up where they left off, but of course there's royalty in the way. Leopold gets his pet policeman, inspector Uhl (Sideways' Paul Giamatti) to investigate Eisenheim. You know this will not end well.<br /><br />The film is complex, and quite pretty to boot. Burger (Interview with the Assassin) has all his ducks in a row here, and knows where to place them for maximum effect. There are some weak points, of course, but surprisingly, Biel isn't one of them; this is easily her best performance since Ulee's Gold a decade ago. There seemed a few places where the script was rushed, as if the director had wanted to spend more time investigating certain plot tangents, and it's usually the case that doing so makes for a stronger movie, but those are pretty easily overlooked. A very good movie, well worth the cost of a rental (even at today's insane prices). *** ?</p></br><a href="../users/A1KFBAPAKMEQUF.html">A1KFBAPAKMEQUF</a><br/><p>Although I prefered "The Prestige" (both came out around the same time), I must admit that this movie was well-acted and very romantic.  Simple story.  Boy meets girl. Boy is poor, girl is rich.  Romance is out of the question and the two are forcefully separated.  Boy grows up and meets grown up girl again and instantly the romance is rekindled. An evil prince stands in the way and an exciting plot ensues to free the girl.<br /><br />Two thumbs up.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IOJE0W1NXOSE.html">A1IOJE0W1NXOSE</a><br/><p>The young son of a cabinet-maker(Edward Norton) becomes acquainted with Sophie, the daughter of a wealthy man for whom his father works.

The young man travels the world and learns the art of being an illusionist, while the young girl grows up and is to be betrothed to the Crown Prince of Austria.  They meet again and discover that their attraction is as strong as ever, but they are threatened by the cruel Crown Prince who has no intention of letting Sophie go.  This is an exquisite movie in every way.  It is beautifully filmed, wonderfully written, and well-acted.  There are moral questions, particularly with regard to the Chief Inspector who is under the wing of the Crown Prince, and questions as to how the illusions in the movie are done.  Rather than detracting from the film, all of this creates a perfect mood and setting for a highly entertaining movie.</p></br><a href="../users/AJMU8VVFKMZI4.html">AJMU8VVFKMZI4</a><br/><p>3.5 stars.  The most striking thing about this picture is that it's beautiful to look at.  Kudos for the cinematopgraphy and even the film's direction.  I wasn't too fond of the pacing.  On more than one occasion, I found myself twitching in my seat and wanting everyone to get one with it.  Norton's performance was exceptional as his character carries an air of superiority throughout the film.  The overly typecast Sewell, once again don the role of the villian (I think it has something to do with his eyes-he just looks like a bastard, doesn't he?)  But the man I continue to be impressed with is Paul Giamatti.  Will someone please give this man an Oscar already.  The way this man can change his whole demeanor, his voice and delivery is absolutely amazing.

Whole bunch of different kids end up in Saturday detention and learn a lot about each other, themselves, with a lot of laughs, tension and tears.

U have always wanted to own it.  Unprepared to wait for the 25 Anniversary DVD, I bought this barebones DVD release.  To be fair, this DVD was released in 1998 when the format was quite new.  I'll get to the DVD issues later.<br />BC is a fantastic film focussing on 5 teenagers who have to do detention on a Saturday at school. The character development is brilliant as is the acting.  The narrative is simple yet compelling.  <p>DVD SUMMARY:<p>As mentioned above, this DVD came out in 1998.  It is a basic DVD with poor features (and some typing errors too). The movie is Widescreen 1:85 but not anamorphic - despite this, picture quality is ok.  The black bars are rather large though, if you have a 16:9 TV you may be able to minimise these.<p>The sound quality is the DVD's biggest let-down.  Mono city, and does it show!  Sounds so flat and can be hard to hear what characters are saying in some scenes.  <p>But even with these letdowns, the DVD is worth owning for the film alone.  It is a film you will want to watch over and over.  I'll also be buying the 25th Anniversary DVD if it eventuates.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ARRAMXWT83PT.html">A2ARRAMXWT83PT</a><br/><p>This is one of my favorites. As most people already know, this film is about a group of completely different individuals, all with their own conflicts, who have to share a Saturday in detention together. Basically, they all get to know each other, they talk about their problems, gradually help each other out and become great friends while doing so. This is one of the best films of the 80's, and, in this day and age, if there really MUST be anymore teen films, they need to give them over to John Hughes. He is one of the best. <p>This movie is superb in every way. Nothing is forced or corny (except for some of the out-dated dancing sequences) but thats about it! The performances are phenomenal, and just about everything else is, too. SEE IT if you haven't seen it already.<p>Highly recommended!</p></br><a href="../users/A2HWD9PTM7RBXN.html">A2HWD9PTM7RBXN</a><br/><p>This movie very accurately describes the trials and tribulations of five very different teenagers. Each of the five teens has critical issues that effect him or her and its is very interesting how each individual brings  can bring out reactions from the rest of the group.  Its almost like a teen  therapy session and in the end, each person seems to learn from one  another.  Judd Nelson gives a real killer performance as a troubled teen  trying to find happiness in a world that does nothing but dump on him.  His  humor seems to make him strong and impresses Molly Ringwald in the end.  Its intersting to watch these five as well as the teacher and custodian  evolve over the course of the movie.  The depth of this movie plus aspects  of both drama and comedy make The Breakfast Club one of my all time  favorites.</p></br><a href="../users/A3S98L5B1SR9P1.html">A3S98L5B1SR9P1</a><br/><p>This is one of my favorite movies of all time. The movie is about these five teenagers from various backgrounds and social statures held in detention on a saturday morning. The theme of this movie is really great because it emphasizes that no matter who you are; we are all the same. Not too much happens in the movie because most of the movie has the characters talking to each other throughout the film.<br /><br />Overall, this movie is a very witty and original movie to own.<br /><br />The High School Reunion Edition DVD comes in a anamorphic widescreen presentation with the choice of Dolby Digital 5.1 or DTS 5.1 audio. It also includes a theatrical trailer, and a interactive menu. In other words, it's a barebones disc, but it's worth the purchase for the remastered picture.</p></br><a href="../users/A38QJ7JUUTVLKX.html">A38QJ7JUUTVLKX</a><br/><p>This is a remarkably well done movie that treats teenagers as real people and not just sex crazed maniacs. This is pretty accurate by todays standards except for the dated music and clothing, but the issues and the cliques are still the same. Actually the only cast members clothing that didn't go out of style is the nerds clothes. (Nerd never goes out of style) Anyway, John Hughes's popular 1985 teen drama finds the usual groups of high school students a jock, a metalhead a weirdo, a princess, and a nerd sharing a Saturday in detention at their high school for one minor infraction or another. Over the course of a day, they talk through the social barriers that ordinarily keep them apart, and new alliances are born, though not without a lot of pain first. But man it gets painful when they see themselves for they really are, and they see that none of them is better than the other. This film has a positive message (except for having sex and smoking to be cool) and should be viewed buy anyone who has taste. If you don't like this movie, then you're already dead.</p></br><a href="../users/AXFI7TAWD6H6X.html">AXFI7TAWD6H6X</a><br/><p>Of all the John Hughes films I have seen "The Breakfast Club" is probably my least favorite but only because I have seen this movie so many times on basic cable on Saturday mornings. Nevertheless the movie isn't bad as I make it out to sound. I grew up in the '80s and on John Hughes' films. I thought his coming of age teenage flicks like "Pretty in Pink", "Sixteen Candles", and "The Breakfast Club" at the time represented the lives of teenagers. That was almost twenty years ago and teenagers today are more angst-ridden and are dealing with a lot more serious problems. There really isn't much of plot in "The Breakfast Club". It simply revolves around a circle of high school students who end up getting detention and are forced to serve it on a Saturday morning. There is the jock Andrew Clark (Emilio Estevez), the rebel John Bender (Judd Nelson), popular girl Claire Standish (Molly Ringwald), the outcast Allison Reynolds (Ally Sheedy), and the geek Brian Ralph Johnson (Anthony Michael Hall). Principal Richard Vernon (Paul Gleason) has his students in the library which forces them to talk to each other. Although it appears that they are different, the five students eventually realize that they really are not all that different despite the fact they come from different backgrounds and hang out with different crews. My favorite moment in the film were the more dramatic scenes when each character are forced to evaluate themselves. I also liked it when everyone tries to escape the library and get out of detention. Paul Gleason as principal Richard Vernon was the ideal antagonist for the five lead characters. He was pretty funny. Although I have seen this movie so many times and am pretty tired of it, I still like "The Breakfast Club".</p></br><a href="../users/A84UFSF2SZS2W.html">A84UFSF2SZS2W</a><br/><p>A classic 1980s teen film. It has moments that shine, showing the cruel nature of high school cliques and alienation. We have clear cut stereotyped characters here who are driven by excellent dialogue. The group is so diverse when they first arrive at their Saturday detention, and in fact, their reasons for having to be in Saturday school are what bring them together. This group of youths who would never otherwise talk to one another is forced to be together for eight hours, and to bring them together a little quicker, we have a self-satisfied, diabolical school principal. We also have the social outcast "criminal" John Bender (played by Judd Nelson) who has marijuana to bring the group together. Each person has a different social standing and a different attitude toward life, but they discover that they have a lot in common, including insecurities and uncertainties about their identities and their lives. Even if their solidarity lasted for that one afternoon, they might have cause to think twice before stereotyping again. This is the best of this genre film, and strangely most of the people starring in the film have done relatively little since this film. Ally Sheedy has starred in flops, Molly Ringwald retreated to France (although she has made a few films and had a failed attempt at a tv sitcom), Emilio Estevez does films sometimes which have a modest amount of success, Anthony Michael Hall shows up occasionally (as in Pirates of the Silicon Valley, in which he plays Bill Gates), and Judd Nelson has made a few films and starred on the sitcom Suddenly Susan for a few years before leaving to try to revive his film career.</p></br><a href="../users/AP3B615GM191G.html">AP3B615GM191G</a><br/><p>To be completely honest, I usually hate movies like this.  It's like Don McLean's song "American Pie", where basically he just mashes up a whole bunch of different themes and lets people interpret them to death.  It kind of takes the fun out of the experience.  Fortunately, director John Hughes (Mr. 80s himself!) doesn't allow his weighty material to get in the way of the film's true message.<br /><br />Basically, the plot of this film centers on a group of five high-schoolers dragging into the school on a Saturday to serve their detention "sentence".  They come from all walks of life: The Rebel (Judd Nelson), The Jock (Emilio Estevez), The Princess (Molly Ringwald), The Troubled (Ally Sheedy) and The Nerd (Anthony Michael Hall).  While being lorded over by Principal Richard Vernon (played brilliantly by Paul Gleason; he almost steals the show!), the self-dubbed "Breakfast Club" start to get to know each other a little bit.<br /><br />From there, the rest of the film is essentially two things: a series of hilarious sight/action gags to foil Mr. Vernon, and (more importantly) a treatise on the cliquish life of high school students.  Led by the colorful commentary of Nelson's hard-edged character, each stereotype is carefully picked apart and laid bare for the world to see.  Is "Ringwald" truly a good girl, or just fooling herself?  Is "Hall" a dedicated student, or just playing the role to keep the few friendships he has?  Plus, the instigator ("Nelson") turns out to be perhaps the most interesting character-study of them all!<br /><br />What keeps the movie from seeming too high-handy and sappy, though, is the wonderful directing of Hughes.  Unlike, say, James Cameron's "Avatar", where the issues are preached to you in black-and-white terms with no room for disagreement, Hughes leaves it up to the viewer to decide who "The Breakfast Club" members really are.  You can view them as Mr. Vernon does, or have the opportunity to delve in deeper if you so choose.<br /><br />Thus, I have no problems recommending this film to any and all fans of movies that will really make you think.  The ending may be too cheesy (but probably needed to satisfy the teen audience), but along the way it packs quite an intellectual and emotional punch, with a hefty dose of comedy thrown in as well.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TXR85WQLE32N.html">A2TXR85WQLE32N</a><br/><p>On a Saturday morning somewhere in America, five high school students report for detention in a school library. The group includes a jock, a geek, a freak, a princess, and a metalhead loser, with seemingly nothing in common other than the opportunity to be bullied by a hard-nosed assistant principal.<br /><br />In John Hughes' 1985 classic "The Breakfast Club", actors Emilio Estevez (the jock), Anthony Michael Hall (the geek), Ally Sheedy (the freak), Molly Ringwald (the princess), and Judd Nelson (the metalhead loser) will participate in an eight-hour ad hoc encounter session, discover a great deal about themselves and each other, and come out a little older and wiser.  Although the way, the audience will be treated to some well-done moments of comedy, drama, and honest teenage angst.<br /><br />Hughes keeps his young and talented cast busy and his dialogue real while respecting his on-screen characters.  They may be stereotypes, but they tap a vein for practically anyone who endured high school in the late 20th century.  The movie features an exceptional soundtrack.  "The Breakfast Club" is very highly recommended to John Hughes fans of any age.</p></br><a href="../users/A126KX6FVI4T66.html">A126KX6FVI4T66</a><br/><p>Dress changes, music changes, but the struggle of teens to find a place in the world continues.<br />The Janitor in this movie has more wisdom than the vice principle?<br />The kids don't get worse, the teachers get older and less adapted to the future that is happening around them?<br />Here the pairing off of the males and females is kind of strange:<br />the popular girl with the Jock to start that changes to the<br />jock and Kook and the princess and the criminal.<br />My old criticism of the movie is that they left the Brain as solo.<br />I enjoyed this movie which may actually become a classic as it holds up 20 years later.</p></br><a href="../users/A1RJXK6KF3LL5R.html">A1RJXK6KF3LL5R</a><br/><p>A must see for anyone who loves movies from the 80's.I remember this movie from when I was younger.I enjoyed it and now my two sons enjoy it also.It really has meaning and makes some good points.A true classic.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>The Breakfast Club is still one of the finest teen flicks of all-time.

It sits on my and my friends top 10 list of the greatest film achievements of all time. It is cinematic genuise and John Hughes, with his brilliant eye for the youth in film, portrays teenage life in the 80's better than anyone has ever done. The Breakfast Club is quintessential art, and will stand the test of time long after the cast is old and grey. A Classic. Period.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZLROGIL2V7GV.html">A2ZLROGIL2V7GV</a><br/><p>Just when you couldn't bare being in school during the week, imagine having to be forced to spend a Saturday there.  That's what happens to five high school students who are forced to spend a Saturday detention together.  None of them have anything in common and none of them are friends.  Each is an opposite from the other.  The group consists of a brain, a prom queen, a jock, a basket case and a trouble-maker.  A unique and unexpected bond is formed by the five teens as the day goes on, with all sorts of different states of emotion going on for each of them.  No matter happens on Monday, all five of them will always that one Saturday together; therefore, forever labeling them &quot;The Breakfast Club.&quot;<p>Not only is this a classic film, it's one of my personal favorites.  I loved it when I was little and I love it now as I am in my twenties.  It's so refreshing to have a brutally honest film that plays on all of your emotions as this movie does.  And even though this was shot in the eighties, people can still relate to it now in 2000.  This is why it is so effective and powerful.<p>The movie is so memorable that you will most likely repeat every single line during each viewing.  The actors do a terrific job of portraying their roles flawlessly.  The script is funny and touching at the same time.  Everything that is shown in the movie is crucial and significant; being that there isn't a single minute in the movie that goes wasted.<p>This new DVD edition, while it may not be the most spectacular of DVDs, is a lot better than the previous version.  They did an excellent job of producing a successful remastered version of the movie that looks and sounds excellent.  You can even watch it in DTS; that is, if your system carries it.  I'm afraid there's not much to offer in the special features department.  It really is a shame, being that this is such a classic movie.  Still, the way the film looks and sounds is worth the price alone.<p>&quot;The Breakfast Club&quot; is a terrific movie that still has the same effect on us as it did years and years ago.  It's funny, tragic, touching and honest.  If you haven't seen this movie yet, please, make sure that the next time you are at a video store that you pick this up and check it out.  You have no idea what you're missing if you don't.  Still a favorite after so many years, this film surpasses so many movies that we see today.  An excellent achievement on all fronts.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B7BUH8834Y6M.html">A2B7BUH8834Y6M</a><br/><p>If you graduated from high school in the 1980s and haven't seen this film, you must have been locked in a cave.<p>John Hughes delivers the definitive nostalgic teen movie of the Generation X crowd. The cast made up the '80s &quot;brat pack&quot; with Judd Nelson, Emilio Estevez, Ally Sheedy, Molly  Ringwald and Anthony Michael Hall. It's hard to believe while seeing this  film that Ringwald and Hall were the only real high school aged  performers... the others were in their mid to late 20s during  filming.<p>While modern teens may not find this as  &quot;sophisticated&quot; as over-sexed comedies like &quot;American  Pie,&quot; anyone can appreciate true feelings, teen angst, self doubt and  relationships with parents portrayed in this film.<p>A group of kids  sitting for 8 hours in detention on a Saturday none of them will ever  forget. While there is foul language, it's about the same speed as what you  can hear on &quot;NYPD Blue&quot; on TV. There is no nudity or sex, just  raw, in your face teen angst.<p>You see this group of &quot;losers,&quot;  warts and all, and become friends with all of them before the film is over.  The DVD doesn't offer anything other than cast bios and subtitles... which  is a disappointment. It would have been great to have had some interviews  with the cast and behind the scenes footage.  Nonetheless, DVD is much  better than tape and definitely worth the extra $ for a non volitile  format.</p></br><a href="../users/A1534MBU6VJXYN.html">A1534MBU6VJXYN</a><br/><p>Along with "Fast Times At Ridgemont High" and "Ferris Bueller's Day Off", "The Breakfast Club" ranks high among the elite list of 1980s' teen comedies. Few films have portrayed the high and lows of high school any better, and its characters and plot are still relatable today.<br /><br />My complaint in my review is the dvd. Sure the sound picture quality are better than ever, but hwere are the extras? C'mon, an audio commentary by the cast and crew would've been welcomed, as would a documentary. Needless, I am a bit disappointed.<br /><br />Still, the movie is brilliant, so it's still worth owning. But c'mon, some extras would've been nice.</p></br><a href="../users/AV5G37VFE5NVD.html">AV5G37VFE5NVD</a><br/><p>There was an abundance of teen films in the 1980s.  That was one of the defining parts of the decade.  Though many of those were great - and many were terrible - few came close to the greatness of THE BREAKFAST CLUB.  Since its release in 1985, it has become a contemporary classic, winning over viewers for more than twenty years.  As of yesterday, I am one of the countless viewers in love with this film.<br /><br />THE BREAKFAST CLUB spans eight hours on a grey Saturday, where five teenagers are gathering at Shermer High School for detention.  At first glance, this is how they appear: Andy (Emilio Estevez) is just another jock.  Brian (Anthony Michael Hall) is a nerd, a brain, a geek.  Bender (Judd Nelson) is a rude, rambunctious troublemaker.  Claire (Molly Ringwald) is a stuck-up rich girl.  Allison (Ally Sheedy) is odd, quiet, disturbed, the precursor to the Gothic girl.  These five kids go into Shermer High with nothing in common, but when they come out, their lives will be changed forever.<br /><br />John Hughes is universally acknowledged to be the King of Teen Movies, but he's much more.  He is a very talented writer and director, and THE BREAKFAST CLUB is clear, undeniable evidence of this.  The script is very likely one of the greatest ever written, filled with great dialogue including memorable moments of humor and shocking moments of drama.  Hughes' directing wrings out Academy Award-worthy performances from the cast - which is, of course, stellar.  Hall is probably the most likable of the bunch, but Nelson is the most amusing.  His character is one whom we hate, then laugh with, then sympathize with, then hate again, and finally, love.  Sheedy's character is delightfully weird.  Paul Gleason is perfectly hateable as Principal Vernon, and John Kapelos is perfectly likable as Carl the janitor.<br /><br />THE BREAKFAST CLUB is emotional, shocking, and filled with dialogue that is undeniably true.  The cast is great, the script is brilliant, the directing is top-notch, the editing is seamless, and to top it off there's a great soundtrack including music by Simple Minds and Wang Chung.  This is not only the ultimate 80s teen flick - it may very well be one of the greatest films ever made.  Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NUHWMHA9XNKV.html">A2NUHWMHA9XNKV</a><br/><p>Following the same nostalgic flair as the old Degrassi series, this is the only movie I've seen that shows REAL high school life - behind the fun and playfulness is a suprising amount of gritty truthfulness, proving in the end that whether you thought you were below or above others, everyone is on the same line. There's no reason for anyone to NOT watch it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2OXDJP1Z3LNOK.html">A2OXDJP1Z3LNOK</a><br/><p>John Hughes, like no other, can combine hilarity and sorrow into a film and it all works.

We laugh at all of the stereotypes of the high school class system.<p>The Brain<br />The Criminal<br />The Athlete<br />The Princess<br />The Basket Case<p>Admittedly, there is an element of self-analysis when anyone watches this movie.  You really can't help but place yourself into one of those stereotypical roles and gaze at your own frailties.  However, it all wraps up cleanly because people are people and we really aren't that different.  How poignant that it takes an 8 hour Saturday detention to enlighten the souls of these five kids.<p>You must own all John Hughes movies.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ.html">A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ</a><br/><p>This John Hughes film was pretty much right on. The characters here might of been cliched, but guess what?, that's life. These kinds of characters are also real people. Real people who are in every high school across America. If you don't think so, you need to look harder. They may not always act or look the same as others, but they are there. A bunch of high schoolers have to serve detention together on a Saturday. Molly Ringwald is the Princess, Anthony Michael Hall is the geek, Emilio Estevez is the jock, Judd Nelson is the loner, and Ally Sheedy is the basket case. These different backgrounds and personalities come together and clash. They are pretty much forced to spend this time together and thoughts and feelings come out. Somebody dismisses it because it's a whinefest?. Get over it. This is life. It's one big whinefest!. The young actors(well, at the time)are all teriffic. They really bring these distinct individuals to life and make them believeable. I mean, really believeable. Paul Gleason is on hand as the principal who keeps an eye on the group. The ending might be a little too predictable and happy, but so what?. Judd Nelson gives the strongest performance here. He is really good. Hughes really writes teen life well. He does it a million times better than any writer writing the so called &quot;teen films&quot; of today. We need Mr. Hughes to come back and write teen movies like this for the new world we are living in. That's something to hope for. This is a very well made, very intelligent movie. Anybody who says these people are not real or are in schools, needs to open their eyes a bit more. A great movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y.html">A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y</a><br/><p>Saw it on Netflix,although a bit long and overdramatic at times, it is the quintessential 80's movie and a must see.

They are an unusual mix of people (a Weirdo, a Delinqent, a Nerd, a Princess, and a Jock) all put together in one room for a day.  Here they are forced to look at each other which contemplating their detention assignment - writing an essay about what makes them them.  This was obviously meant to punish, but turns them into talking about themselves in ways they otherwise wouldn't and the play unfolds.<br /><br />It was odd to see Molly Ringwald here as the snotty popular girl when she is perhaps more famous for being the outcast.  Here she will only speak to the Jock as she considers him to be her equal and not the others until the Delinquent Judd Nelson bullies his way into cracking her shell.  And eating sushi for lunch with chopsticks?  That's a little strange.  Ally Sheedy, however, stole this movie in my opinion.  She is the sullen, twitching creep in the back.  The sandwich!  Who can forget that?!  And using her own dandruff on the drawing of the snowy day!  And we find out she wasn't in detention, she just didn't have anything else to do that day!!!  HA!  Anthony Michael Hall reappeared as the drooling Nerd once again, but he was probably the most dangerous of them all as he was in detention for bringing a gun to school.  And the Jock, Emilio Estevez, which is a sort of bad guy is actually pretty likable.<br /><br />Why not 5 stars?  Judd Nelson.  Judd Nelson as the Delinquent was just exactly that.  He was annoying, obnoxious, insecure, and proved nothing except that his bad behavior earned him the next six months of detention Saturdays.  He was a rebel without  a clue.  Know what's really scary though?  I remember my first real boyfriend used to look and dress like him, he even had those gloves with the fingers cut off if I remember correctly.  *Yikes!*</p></br><a href="../users/A1JH5J1KQAUBMP.html">A1JH5J1KQAUBMP</a><br/><p>Five high school students who are representative of well-known stereotypes--the princess (Molly Ringwald), the brain (Michael Anthony Hall), the athlete (Emilio Estevez), the basket case (Ally Sheedy), and the criminal (Judd Nelson)--are sentenced to all-day Saturday detention in the school library together.  Wanting nothing to do with each other, they nevertheless begin to interact and, by the end of the day, they have learned a great deal about themselves and the others, completely shattering the concept of a stereotype.<br /><br />There's a 5-star movie here screaming to get out, as exemplified by the wonderful scene in which the kids just sit down on the floor and talk about themselves and challenge each others assumptions.  It's hampered by many lesser elements, such as one-dimensional adult characters and silly posing (such as the MTV flavored dance scenes, which are unrealistic and painfully bad).  Nevertheless, the excellent performances and that basic core of honesty about high school that manages on occasion to rise powerfully above the formula rescue the film./</p></br><a href="../users/A1K94LXX833JTT.html">A1K94LXX833JTT</a><br/><p>A new release of The Breakfast Club is coming out in September with an audio commentary by Judd Nelson and Anthony Michael Hall, a couple features called "Sincerely Yours" and "Most Convenient Definitions: The Origins of the Brat Pack," and the theatrical trailer.  These will be the first real special features to have been included with The Breakfast Club on DVD.  It's known that there are deleted scenes (some have been shown on TV), but there was no mention of any in the announcement for the new DVD.<br /><br />The Breakfast Club is considered by many the quintessential high school movie, which is quite a comment on high school, as almost the entire film takes place in detention.  Five students, each representing a type but fleshed out into real characters as the film develops, are stuck together on a Saturday in detention.  In terms they use themselves, there's a "criminal" (Judd Nelson), a "princess" (Molly Ringwald), a "jock" (Emilio Estevez), a "brain" (Anthony Michael Hall), and a "basket case" (Ally Sheedy).  Effectively portrayed tension between the five builds to explosive levels before they finally discover how much they have in common.  There is a lot of sharp humor, some hijinks, a lot of emotional release in the last third.  The acting is very good.  Nelson is especially good as the main catalyst for the tension, projecting a powerful personality and sharp mind turned in against self and back out at others.<br /><br />I loved this movie in the '80s.  I still like it and admire it now, though its formula seems a little more prominent to me than it used to.  By today's standards it may seem to pull its punches when it comes to the reasons kids have to be unhappy and in trouble, but it strikes a fair balance between entertaining teen comedy and realism.  It's also a fine time capsule from the '80s.<br /><br />The new DVD will be 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen with English Dolby Digital 5.1 and English DTS 5.1.  No indication has been given that this will be any different from the older DVDs.<br /><br />New Flashback Editions of two other John Hughes classics, Sixteen Candles and Weird Science, are slated to come out on the same day as this one.  Each will include a feature about the film.  Weird Science will also have the Weird Science TV series pilot episode and the theatrical trailer.  Apparently only this one gets an audio commentary.  No Blu-ray announcements yet.<br /><br />Amazon has a page to pre-order <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AEF6BI">here</a>.</p></br><a href="../users/A1M9DQDGE07Q0U.html">A1M9DQDGE07Q0U</a><br/><p>&quot;The Breakfast Club&quot; is the brat pack movie that I venture to guess will be long remembered as a watershed moment in American cinema - at least where teen comedy is concerned.  The plot (for those not already familiar with it) revolves around 5 teenagers from various walks of life, forced to sit together through one Saturday afternoon detension session. A hilarious, well-crafted and often poignant film about the fundemental truths that make us all human, John Hughes &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot; is perhaps the single greatest exploration of the angst and confusion that plagued us all during the high school years.<br />UNIVERSAL's remastering efforts on this DVD provide some angst of their own. Despite being anamorphically enhanced for 16X9 displays, this newly minted DVD offers nothing in the way of video improvement over the previously issued DVD.  Colors are dated, unrealistic, often unbalanced with some bleeding and smearing.  Fine detail is minimal, even in well lit scenes.  Contrast, shadow and black levels are all extremely weak. Age related artifacts, including chips, scratches and spice jump cuts are all evident. There is a considerable amount of film grain present throughout for a wholly unsatisfying visual presentation.  The audio - remixed to 5.1 in both Dolby and DTS exhibits a dated characteristic with muffled dialogue and practically no spacial separation, except in the music tracks.<br />EXTRAS: A Theatrical trailer that is badly worn.<br />BOTTOM LINE: &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot; is a brilliant movie.  However, the lack of extras (a documentary would have been nice)and the really low brow treatment of the transfer lead me to say this disc really isn't worth the money.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KUUII2GSHN7T.html">A3KUUII2GSHN7T</a><br/><p>This is it, the one and only. This is the cornerstone of all eighties movies, fresh with its witty humor, solid message, and fine collection of young eighties stars.  <p>It is the story of five kids, five very different kids and the day they were forced to spend together in Saturday detention.  We have Judd Nelson as the punk, or at that time, stoner boy; Molly Ringwald as the school princess; Emilio Estevez as the super jock; Anthony Michael Hall as the nerd; and Ally Sheedy as the no-name freak.  It's quite a collection and, with the smart and sassy script, creates one of Hollywood's most engrossing films of the eighties and beyond.<p>If there is a remote chance you haven't seen this movie via TNT, Blockbuster, or TBS, I highly recommend this flick. It is funny, sad, intriguing, and most of all, is the hallmark of every eighties teen film, surpassing even the likes of Ferris Bueller's Day Off and yes, even Fast Times at Ridgemont High. <p>You can't go wrong with The Breakfast Club. Be warned, though, there are plenty of vulgar words and sexual innuendos in this film but hey, that just comes with the territory.  <p>Note: this film also provides one of the greatest eighties songs of all time, Don't You Forget About Me by the Simple Minds. ENJOY!!</p></br><a href="../users/A1IANEBSMVGHS9.html">A1IANEBSMVGHS9</a><br/><p>I guess I was locked out in a cave, because in spite of having graduated from high school in 1989, today I saw "The Breakfast Club" for the first time. Laugh if you may, but I guess this opinion from an eighties child who is now 33 years old may help you decide to watch it too.<br /><br />The movie is now over twenty years old, and it doesn't feel old. The first half hour or so, you may feel like you're watching a teenage movie, but the plot thickens a bit as it evolves and the definite personalities of the five characters float to the surface, baring their souls to each other and the viewer. You will find yourself finding one (or more) of them with whom you will be able to identify with. In my case it was Brian (the nerd), but you may find you had more in common with the ones depicting the athlete, the basket case, the princess or the criminal.<br /><br />The performances are all extraordinary, but the true standouts were Emilio Estevez (the athlete) and Judd Nelson (the criminal), who were perfect for their roles and delivered some of the best lines overall. Now I know why this is a classic.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DY46ZABF4CMQ.html">A3DY46ZABF4CMQ</a><br/><p>The Breakfast Club is an 80's teen cult classic directed by John Hughes, who also gave us Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Sixteen Candles and Home Alone, and starring teen icons Molly Ringwald (Sixteen Candles), Judd Nelson (St Elmo's Fire), Emilio Estevez (Young Guns), Anthony Michael Hall (Sixteen Candles), Ally Sheedy (Short Circuit), and Paul Gleason (Trading Places).<br /><br />Five high school students who have nothing in common spend an entire Saturday detention in the school library where the principal, Mr. Vernon played by Gleason, assigns them to write a paper telling him who they are. In the next hour and a half, we get to know who they are and we build a connection to five types of students that every school has: the nerd who cannot get anything less than an A, the spoiled rich brat that everyone calls 'queenie', the athlete who's pressured by his dad and coach to be tough even if it means bullying others around, the 'criminal' who has an abusive father and might as well "not even exist at the school", and the drunken and gothic 'shopping bag' girl who's ignored by everyone around her including her parents.<br /><br />The movie is funny, but touches upon some serious issues that teenagers deal with under different circumstances. John Hughes directs his young actors with such flair that each character shines onscreen and engage us, the viewers, with their dilemmas.<br /><br />The Breakfast Club along with its soundtrack featuring the Simple Minds classic hit Don't You Forget About Me are still outstanding 20 years on.<br /><br />Recommended<br /><br />A</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZE73RFY0GD3K.html">A2ZE73RFY0GD3K</a><br/><p>If you've, uh, like ever heard, like, kids these days and they, you know, like talk among themselves and that sort of thing, like visiting or some stuff like that, can you, I mean, you know what I mean, do you ever hear them, uh, you know, talk like the five kids in this show, you know, with, like coherent sentences that have subjects and verbs and, like, uh, even adjectives and that sort of thing, you know?

The cast is great but Judd Nelson stands out the most. I</p></br><a href="../users/A1SVXJZ3386U2D.html">A1SVXJZ3386U2D</a><br/><p>I must have missed "The Breakfast Club" when it came out in the mid 1980's.  That's too bad because I might have been a bit more receptive to the characters portrayed in this movie.  In my mid 50's I find myself a bit stretched to buy into them.  Allowing somewhat for my aged perspective, I could tell from the dialogue and interaction between the high schoolers that the writers were looking at exploring relationships at an age when they are most volitile.  Overall, this works pretty well.  My problem is that we had a group of 5 kids who each filled a different high school stereotype; the jock, the hood, the nerd, the homecoming queen, and the misfit nobody likes.  How uncanny that they all were so diverse from one another.  Wouldn't life in high school have been easier if the numbers had so nicely evened out?  If we could have always gone one on one?  I admit that I didn't care for the three boys to two girls ratio but otherwise I'm sure I could have handled high school a lot better with those odds.  The problem never was individuals; it was groups of liked minded individuals who preyon on, mocked or simply ignored other "lesser" groups.  I realize that the writer/director John Hughes chose this format to escape those limitations.  Unfortunately, reality never was that convenient.<br /><br />High school has always been a tough time for most kids.  Unfortunately, even the ones who sailed through with popularity often found that those were life's highlights; what came after never seemed to match it.  Most of us learned valuable lessons that we only understood later but getting through the roller coaster didn't always seem worth it at the time.  I acknowledge that these feeling were, at times, excellently put on display in "The Breakfast Club".  However, each time the soul searching looked like it was going to touch a nerve, uncovered a hidden reality, or display honest sincerity, we suddenly found out it was all the fault of lousy parenting.  What a cop out! (to borrow a phrase from my high school days).  All authority  in "The Breakfast Club" is, by far, more dysfunctional that these hormone-crazed teenagers; was this supposed to be a comedy?  Still, the "discoveries" were hard-earned and we went through a lot of emotion and thought to get there.<br /><br />All in all, this is a good movie.  As you can tell, it took me back to my high school days.  I watched it with my 8th grade son who got interested when he heard the opening song.  We saw a cleaned-up version but there was still a lot of serious stuff in the movie.  I couldn't tell if he got a lot out of the movie but he didn't get up from his chair til it was finished.  I rated this movie 4 stars because, despite my objections, I felt Hughes made a valient effort.</p></br><a href="../users/A2D7NX9ZYBJZ13.html">A2D7NX9ZYBJZ13</a><br/><p>Simply The Breakfast Club IS A MASTERPIECE From John Hughes,I have two LASERDISC Copies!! heh yeah I do and I have it on DVD TOO ,,You too Go get it you 'll love it :pp</p></br><a href="../users/A3AEYDNYCWH2IZ.html">A3AEYDNYCWH2IZ</a><br/><p>This movie is timeless.

Judd Nelson as John Bender couldnt be more rebellious and great, hes the scene chewer upper. the other five, Molly Ringwald, Anthony Michael Hall, Emilio Estevez and Ally Sheedy are superb. it makes you think</p></br><a href="../users/A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ.html">A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ</a><br/><p>The Breakfast Club is probably the archetypal movie of the 1980s, at least that of the youth in America.  It is an indelible part of cultural history and remains as fresh and brash as ever today.  While teenagers can certainly not be broken down into five distinct types, the five students forced to spend their Saturday at school in detention do a pretty good job of covering the basics.  You have Claire, the popular prom queen type, played by the wonderful Molly Ringwald, the jock (Emilio Estevez), the brain (Anthony Michael Hall), the weirdo (Alley Sheedy), and the disrespectful criminal (Judd Nelson)--five students who are complete strangers to each other and totally different personalities.  Terrorizing and threatening them is an older teacher intent on enforcing discipline among them.  The criminal is determined to foment an insurrection, and eventually the strict supervision of the students breaks down.  At first, the students yell at and fight with one another and are especially antagonistic toward the juvenile delinquent among them.  As the day progresses, the students begin to tell their own stories--who they are, why they are in detention, etc.  Their conversations weave back and forth between insults and incriminations and words of sympathy and concern.  They eventually start roaming the school halls, leading to the classic scenes of them skidding across the halls in a mad flight to return to the library before the teacher returns to check on them.  Somehow, the five eventually do open up to each other, confessing secrets, forming friendships, and realizing that the problems they considered their own are shared to some degree with each other.  <p>This is a great movie and one that appealed directly to young people--everyone can understand problems with overbearing or neglectful parents, grades, peer pressure, drugs, etc.  I must say that I sometimes felt the changes between hateful exchanges and sympathetic dialogue came a little abruptly, though; I for one never saw any redeeming quality in Judd Nelson's character.  I also couldn't believe some of the destruction that was done to school property over the course of the day.  Anthony Michael Hall was brilliant in his role and provided some very funny moments, but I as a former brain did not see much of myself in him.  The real point of the film, though, is that teenagers all have problems they must deal with, that the folks not in your little group or clique are just as human as you are and worthy of respect, and that adults seemingly just cannot understand their kids for the most part, and that very fact only heightens the need for teenagers to depend on one another.  <p>I should also mention the music.  "Don't You Forget About Me" by Simple Minds was perhaps the most-played song of the entire decade, and it is rightly associated forever with this movie.  Also, whenever you hear the famous whistling tune from this movie (and we've all heard it countless times since 1985, a fact which by itself demonstrates the much-deserved popularity of this movie over the years), you will not forget about The Breakfast Club.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GA09FYFKL4EY.html">A3GA09FYFKL4EY</a><br/><p>The soundtrack is outstanding, the story is true-to-life: teens spending a day in detention. I did find it somewhat unconvincing since the actors playing teenagers so obviously aren't, and the ending is disappointing. When they return to school on Monday nothing will have changed much. The outcasts will still be outcasts, and they'll all ignore each other despite the one-day of pseudo-bonding. Nice date movie though.</p></br><a href="../users/A132ETQPMHQ585.html">A132ETQPMHQ585</a><br/><p>!~ Cute movie good price and no hassle t buy or receive.

In one Saturday, they all learn something new from each other and also learn a little about themselves.<p>O.k. first and foremost, the premis of this movie is kinda off (i.e. why are 5 kids actually showing up to Saturday detention?) but if you look past that little part, the rest of the movie is funny as hell. There's just a ton of laughs in this from wise cracks to even some pretty good physical comedy and even a smoking pot scene that's really funny.<p>I took off a star because Molly Ringwald's character (Claire) is a bit on the annoying side but at least, Judd Nelson is harsh in this movie!

It stands out as a classic of its genre, the '80s teen movie, the &quot;brat pack&quot; flicks exemplified in the films of John Hughes (Ferris Bueller's Day Off). In Hughes's world, the grown-ups are exposed as morons, and here it is Paul Gleason as high school Principal Richard Vernon (&quot;Does Barry Manilow know you raided his wardrobe?&quot;) as the token object of humiliation.<p>In The Breakfast Club, five students find themselves thrown together for a Saturday detention. Throughout the course of the day they fight, they cause mischief, they laugh, they cry, they get high, and they wind up discovering that as different as they are from each other on the surface -- the rich kid, the geek, the troublemaker -- underneath they're the same ordinary kids going through the same ordinary struggles.<p>You may have to ignore some of the amoral implications of the story to appreciate it. And you will have to find it in your heart to forgive the cheesiness as Hughes presents every cliche of his era one by one. Overlook some of the utter implausibilities and absurdities the film throws at us. This is good fun that puts adults in their place for a while and reminds us that &quot;kids&quot; are human, too.</p></br><a href="../users/AY6A8KPYCE6B0.html">AY6A8KPYCE6B0</a><br/><p>I admit it's been such a long time since I've seen the Breakfast Club that it felt a lot like the first time when I watched this on the recent Blu Ray release, so I really can't compare it to the DVD release or any others.  I can say, however, that I was very pleased with the picture quality.<br /><br />Fans know this movie has a very basic storyline, and very few scene changes.  But nonetheless, you still get a juicy taste of 1080p while watching it.  Facial closeups look crystal clear and gorgeous, while the background has fantastic depth.  This is particularly vivid during the ending speeches.  The depth is so perfect you have that great 3D feel that makes Blu Ray fans giddy.<br /><br />As far as grain and flickers are concerned, I didn't see any.  I may not be as picky as some HD scholars, but I was actively trying to look for any signs of a bad transfer nothing caught my immediate attention.<br /><br />My only complaint about this release, as is my complaint with just about every Universal release, is that the loading time is a little ridiculous.  I'm not sure if it's their main menu template or what, but all my Universal blus take ages to load.<br /><br />Overall, if you've never seen this movie you really ought to watch it.  Many try to make intelligent high school movies, but very few succeed.  The Breakfast Club is one of the lucky few.  It's heartfelt, it's emotional, it's well acted, directed, and written.  Its stood the test of time (25 years!) but thanks to blu ray, you can now watch it and feel like you're viewing a new release because of the perfect clarity.  Even if you have seen it a 1000 times, however, I'm willing to bet its worth the DVD upgrade.  Any chance you can get to increase the pixels of beautiful Molly Ringwald is worth it, IMO.</p></br><a href="../users/A3MQ672FYFNM7B.html">A3MQ672FYFNM7B</a><br/><p>Ally Sheedy! Molly Ringwald!

This movie focuses on five high school students who are to spend a Saturday in detention for whatever it was that they did wrong.  At the beginning of the day, they didn't even know each other's names, but by the end, they had bared their souls, explained their dreams, and became friends.<br /><br />Judd Nelson (Bender), Anthony Michael Hall (Brian), Emilio Estevez (Andrew), Molly Ringwald (Claire) and Ally Sheedy (Allison) star as the students, while Paul Gleason stars as principal Richard Vernon.  At 7 am, the students enter the library, not knowing each other, but as the movie progresses, they learn more and more about each other so that by the end of the day, they all realize that there is a little bit of everyone in each of them.  Bender is the "criminal", suffering from a bad homelife, abusive parents, and a lack of self-esteem.  Brian is the "brain", who believes in studying hard and getting good grades, but he's also a geek.  Andrew is the "jock".  He is frustrated because he feels that he must live up to his father's high expectations for him.  He snaps under the pressure that his father placed on him.  Claire is the "princess".  She feels that she's better than everyone, and has the best of everything.  Allison is the "basket case".  Like Bender, she is suffering from low self-esteem, so she lies to cover up her insecurities.<br /><br />It is amazing to watch the transformation of these characters, especially the relationship between Claire and Bender.  Although he constantly harasses her throughout the movie, deep down Bender really likes and cares for Claire.  As the movie progresses, the characters soon realize that they all have a little of the same characteristics of each other, such as the scene where they are running from Vernon in the halls and Bender asks Claire how it feels to be bad.  Then they display some of Bender's characteristics by sitting and smoking marajuana.<br /><br />There are several funny points in the film as well, such as Bender crashing through the ceiling while telling a joke, and the constant harassment that Vernon faced.  Also, who can forget the great song by Simple Minds?<br /><br />This is a great movie.  The story is excellent and well-developed.  The acting is first-rate, but I thought that Judd Nelson did an especially good job as Bender.  I give this movie a very high recommendation.  To the outside world they were simply the jock, the criminal, the princess, the brain, and the basket case, but to each other, they would always be the breakfast club.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L8HRCM60W0W7.html">A1L8HRCM60W0W7</a><br/><p>While I don't proclaim the Breakfast Club to be a masterpiece or &quot;the best movie ever&quot; or anything quite as seminal as that, it certainly deserves appreciation for its originality. <p>Here was a film that presents five students who initially come across as cardboard cliches, but who eventually reveal themselves as so much more. The writing is sharp and crisp, and apart from a few patches of overdone juvenile behavior, the dialogue flows seamlessly. <p>Sure, the movie has its warts. Parents are the root of all the kids' problems; there are annoying lapses in logic (like how does Ringwald get to see Nelson at the end and Sheedys character wasn't assigned detention, so wouldn't Gleason know that) and there is a somewhat prolonged but inconsequential dance sequence smooshed in.<p>Yet, twenty two years on, the movie still rings as true as ever because school life remains essentially the same -- same sorts of conflict between generations, private fears often undisclosed to the outside world, worries about their futures nagging them, etc etc. <p>A truly enjoyable, clever brat-pack character study. Special highlight -- the popular Simple Minds number &quot;Don't You Forget About Me&quot;.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B3Z2QHW3V35S.html">A2B3Z2QHW3V35S</a><br/><p>I ALWAYS enjoy watching this movie.

All of the actors are great, and for a movie that was fairly low-budget and quickly-produced (I hear it took less than two months start to finish), it's easily better than many movies with a huge budget and huger special effects. The actors did a great job of embracing their roles. It's just one of these movies that was made to last - now that's quality.</p></br></body></html>

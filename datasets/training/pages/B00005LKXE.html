I loved Hannibal...and had several friends who hated it, because they expected a true SOTL sequel.  If you understand that Hannibal is from the viewpoint of Lector, and the imagry is lush and refined, much like Hannibal would demand.  If you think you are getting a by the book sequel, you will be dissapointed.  If you think you are getting a look into the mind of one of the most intriquing characters created in the 20th century, you will NOT be dissapointed.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>The main problem with this second entry in the Lechter series is that is has no focus and it doesn't use the Lechter/Starling relationship to its fullest.  Director Ridley Scott has opted to create a noirish, somewhat gory film whose script wanders around a little too much.  In the ten years since SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, Lechter has found refuge in Florence, taking over as curator of an art museum; meanwhile, Starling has continued with the FBI, reaching the point where her actions are questioned; she's even received a letter from the Guiness Book of World Records for being the female who has killed the most people.  Add to this the character of Mason Vergis, Lechter's fourth victim and only survivor who peeled off his face at Lechter's request and who now wants to use Starling to lure out Lechter so he can get his revenge.  As if this isn't enough plot, we get an Italian detective who stumbled on to Lechter and wants to get the three million dollar reward offered by Vergis.  HANNIBAL suffers inevitably from being too plot driven and sources indicate screenwriter David Mamet's original script was completely overhauled, although Mamet's name is still in the credits.  Anthony Hopkins continues to instill a strong sense of evil and menace, although this time he is somewhat overdrawn, almost to the point of parody.  Julianne Moore who stepped in when Jodie Foster opted out due to script differences, brings a different approach to Starling, although I'm not sure it's a good one.  Ray Liotta is menacing as a corrupt government official, and his last scenes are grand guignol horror; an uncredited Gary Oldman is lost behind the makeup of Vergis, while Italian superstar Giancarlo Giannini brings a good sense of desperation and greed to his role as the Italian detective.  There is sumptuous photography and New Age artist Hans Zimmer's score is appropriate, but HANNIBAL ends up being mere eye candy and is not as good as the other two films.</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>Many people remained astonished after the film . Confused perhaps because they had tought this was a sequel but this is a wrong appreciation.<br /><br />In fact Hannibal is free in this case and precisely this fact makes the things turn around .<br /><br />The artistic gaze is a crude and brilliant exercise of superb good taste . Think in Florence the ancient memories of Hannibal in his prison 's pictures , and besides the nest of the Reinassance .<br /><br />Think besides in Dante , Pazzi and consider his death as poetic justice .<br /><br />You may argue the film is gore , but what do you expect from Hannibal?<br /><br />The cast is splendid . Oldman made a glamorous tour de force as an invalid hunger of revenge .<br /><br />The erotic presence of Julianne Moore makes Clarence Sterling a little bit altered respect to Jodie Foster .<br /><br />The first entry is a pshycological thriller. This part is a hard multiple chase from Pazzi and the FBI and simulateously all of them seeking Hannibal , superbly played by Anthony Hopkins possibly the best actor in the world who just was working in Titus Andronicus .<br /><br />The default perhaps resides in some minor aspects such as : How can Dr. Lecter to travel from Europe to USA being one of the ten most dangerous criminals and how could Clarence penetrate in the Oldman ' home with such easiness ?<br /><br />If you let these questions to the random you may enjoy of a very clever and intelligent drama which will face you against our particular dragons .<br /><br />Brilliant artistic direction , superb photography , memorable acting of Giancarlo Gianini (nominated in 1976 for his breathtaking performance in Seven beauties), Ray Liotta and a bit of Francesca Neri .<br /><br />Not recommended for squeamish tastes or sensible viewers.</p></br><a href="../users/A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z.html">A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z</a><br/><p>Ridley Scott directs the sequel to the original 'Silence of the Lambs.'  Not a terribly memorable sequel in terms of story line or acting; counting more on gore scenes to shock the audience instead of presenting any real substance in plot or theme.<br /><br />Unlike its predecessor where Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) was more of a secondary character, this film is focused entirely on finding the escaped cannibal doctor.  FBI agent Clarice Starling (Julianne Moore instead of Jodie Foster)tags along with an obnoxious fellow agent (Ray Liotta) to capture the elusive doctor.  She also gets help from one of Lecter's former victims named Mason Verger (Gary Oldman.)<br /><br />Not a terribly memorable sequel except for graphic scenes that, quite frankly, go too far in the domain of bad taste (literally.)  I really don't need up-close, in your face, scenes of human dissection and dismemberment to imagine what it would be like to be served as someone else's dinner.  The final scene displaying how human brains should be served was too disgusting even for my broad tastes in gratuitous violence.  The graphic content of this film was so extreme that Jodie Foster refused to reprise the role she had played so well in the previous film.<br /><br />All in all, I find this to be one of the worst films directed by Riddley Scott and certainly the worse of the four Hannibal Lecter films to be made ('Manhunter' was the first one.)  Worth renting for those who have the stomach but, again, this is certainly not a film for the faint of heart or those who have a light stomach for blood and guts.</p></br><a href="../users/A1M4NJYP0WNL8Q.html">A1M4NJYP0WNL8Q</a><br/><p>When &quot;Hannibal&quot; was released as a book, I was one of the people who lined up to buy it.  At that time I felt it was a let down from &quot;Silence of Lambs.&quot;  While it was quite readable it lacked some fundamental level of excitement.  Because of that I did not go see the film when it was first released.  Now I find myself having mixed reactions to the DVD release, and for reasons almost the exact opposite of those I held against the book.<p>Don't get me wrong.  The film is really much better than the book.  The casting of Hopkins and Julianne as Lector and Starling is perfect.  The script is riveting and all the other qualities are almost too good.  In fact I would be tempted to give this every star possible except for one thing.  Ridley Scott, as director, has chosen to base the film on the book, but he deviates from the novel at several key points.  Scott himself admits that he was trying for a new interpretation of Lector the anti-hero.  <p>Viewers will have to decide whether this is an issue for them.  It didn't really bother me until the ending itself, which is simply not what writer Tom Harris has intended.  I felt it was completely out of character with the rest of the film as well.  It is clear from Scott's commentaries on the film that this ending is exactly what he wanted.  Oddly enough, the extra material includes an alternative ending which I think is much better, even if it doesn't follow the book either.<p>What's good?  Almost everything else.  I've already mentioned the great acting, but what really makes the film is the great cinematography and a mindboggling score.  Right from the beginning you are confronted with a film too serene and beautiful to be a simple horror movie.  It has a lean and solemn poetry that, perhaps, gives us a glimpse into Lector's own mind.  From out of the most nerve-wracking of pieces and fragments Scott has created a romance that has no physical components - a tragicomedy where we expected a horror film.<p>Despite of my dislike for the ending I still would label this film a must see.  The Special Edition includes omitted scenes and trailers, Multi-Angle Vignettes, a series of 'the making of...' discussions and all the other paraphernalia of the gimmick overladen DVD issue.  Two discs of shivers and fun.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EI65WJC85U68.html">A1EI65WJC85U68</a><br/><p>I loved SILENCE OF THE LAMBS &amp; when I read the book of HANNIBAL a while back I started pining for the movie release. HANNIBAL surpasses its predecessor in terms of panache &amp; graphic gore. Anyone expecting Oscar material will be disappointed (&amp; nauseated) with this, but I loved it. Lecter is relatively &quot;normal&quot; in this movie, which I feel makes him all the more terrifying. The plot revolves around one of Lecter's surviving victims, Mason Verger (the always excellent Gary Oldman, in gruesome makeup) plotting to capture Hannibal &amp; feed him to his carnivorous wild pigs, as payment to Lecter feeding his face to a pack of dogs. When Clarice Starling (Juliannne Moore) learns of this she sets out to warn Lecter. Ridley Scott scores another bullseye after his success with GLADIATOR. His expected visual style complements Hopkins' performance well.  Moore meanwhile, manages to step into the role of Starling and make it her own. My only quibble is that Oldman had his name removed from the credits supposedly because he wanted second billing.And for you gorehounds there are several gruesome scenes to savor, including Hopkins introducing Ray Liotta to the pleasures of &quot;brain food&quot;. Yum.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NX5UZ6WEZF0R.html">A2NX5UZ6WEZF0R</a><br/><p>Horrible, horrible, stupid, boring, odd, lacking sense and creativity, intelligence, plot, reason, good acting, and most of all Foster! No wonder she disagreed to such a film. It's a joke my friends. It was merely violence combined with absurd ideas and stupidity. It isnt even in the same LEAGUE as LAMBS. It probably had Foster laughing that they would even have the nerve to expect a talented actreess like her to part take in such a movie. She takes her acting career seriously, and only plays roles that she as a person connects with. And a plot in a movie doesn't hurt! Red Dragon was good, only because it reflected alot of similarities with silence of the lambs. I hate it when there is such a great and unforgettable movie like LAMBS, and then comes a new film, claiming to be the third of the trilogy, but they bite off more then they can chew. Their confidence exceeded their ability as well as their underestimating LAMBS fans. Not many LAMBS fans, (who actually knew all the info about how they created such a realistic and modern suspense/thriller), would enjoy hannibal even a little. Like me.  Lambs was caviar, hannibal was cheese wizz.</p></br><a href="../users/AW3VZ5O895LRK.html">AW3VZ5O895LRK</a><br/><p>From all I'd read about this film, I was really expecting an F viewing experience that I'd turn off after the first half hour.  Much to my surprise, this is a good night's entertainment.  It is NOT as good a work as "Silence of the Lambs," which was a solid "A" film but this film is lacking Jodie Foster and (director) Jonathan Demme so I'm not suprised it doesn't score as well. Anthony Hopkins is once again totally up to par on playing the cannibalistic, murderous psychiatrist, Hannibal Lecter.  He's been living a low profile for ten years but comes forward when FBI agent Starling makes it into the headlines over a street arrest gone bad.  2 opponents Hannibal must thwart are a rich former victim of his, ably played by Gary Oldman, and Starling's boss, played by Ray Liotta, who turns obnoxiousness  into almost an art form.  I was also glad to see Giancarlo Giannini play an Italian cop in this film, who tries to bring in Hannibal for a monetary reward while Hannibal is in Italy.  Julianne Moore does an able job but one can't help but compare her to Foster and there is too big gulf between the two actors in their levels of talent.  Let's just say that any actor is asking for trouble to try to take on a role Foster has already done.  The extra features are superb on this film and director Ridley Scott is a marvelous film teacher.  His commentary on the DVD is absolutely superb and no matter how you feel about the film, Scott has a lot to show you about making movies.  The special features on this DVD I'd grade an A and hubby absolutely was glued to every moment of them as he's a fiend for "special feature" DVDs.</p></br><a href="../users/A15TNUM2PBS6F0.html">A15TNUM2PBS6F0</a><br/><p>I had no idea what to expect from &quot;Hannibal&quot; except, like all other sequels, it couldn't compare to it's predecessor. Lambs was a very suspenseful and psychological thriller. I was not in suspense at all in this film, and the gore was so totally awful!!! I normally can stomach gore, when I expect it. But I didn't even think that Lambs' was that gory. Lambs had an appeal of it's own with the tension between the characters, and the amazing acting. It was an excellent movie that will always remain a classic. Hannibal, however, is so gory. I just finished watching it, and am so repulsed. THis was not expected at all, maybe I should've read the reviews here first as alot of people sent out warnings of the extreme gore in this movie. Aside from the gore, I was very disappointed with this movie. The changing of actresses was just wrong, if Jodie Foster didn't want to do it(and i can see why now), this movie should have never been made! I do like Julianne Moore as an actress, and I thought she did a fine job in taking over the role of Clarice Starling. Anthony Hopkins is great in this movie, it's appropriately titled as this movie is all about Hannibal. Not Hannibal and Clarice, just Hannibal. IT focuses more on his running than the chase that ensues once Clarice, the Italian policeman, and Mason Verger appear. Mason Verger...one of the oddest characters on film! HE is almost as sick and twisted as Hannibal, but at least Hannibal is nicer to look at. Mason had been &quot;attacked&quot; by Hannibal and is the only survivor of Lecter's. I never realized that it was Gary Oldman playing him til the end credits...GARY OLDMAN, he is a great actor, but where is the ability to change character types? He is so stereotyped now. THis is definitely his most outrageous! and the makeup job is so amazingly gross!!! this is a very gross movie. I never found this movie scary or suspenseful. It had a few laughs, and some great acting.-- Hopkins and Oldman. They should have left Ray Liotta out, as he is and always will be one of the worst actors in the history of film. Then we wouldn't have to witness that most disturbing scene in the film. It really made me hate this movie as the gore here does not do anything to help the story in my opinion. I wouldn't recommend this movie. I think it is one of the worst of the year 2001 if not of all time. If you are a big fan of gore, maybe you'll like it for that one reason because this movie has nothing else going for it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X1CEGHTHMBL1.html">A1X1CEGHTHMBL1</a><br/><p>This is the sequel to the first film, Silence of the Lambs.  It takes place seven years after the first film and a horribly disfigured man and his aid are interrogating a man who was an employee at the asylum where Hannibal Lecter was kept. The disfigured and crippled man is a wealthy man who in his younger days was a child molester.  Hannibal ( Anthony Hopkins) was appointed as his court appointed therapist and Hannibal left him disfigured and wheel chair bound.<br /><br />The disfigured man is Mason Verger (Gary Oldman) and he is trying to find out all he can about Hannibal and Agent Clarice Starling (Julianne Moore).  At the end of the interview the asylum worker offers to sell Mason a piece of Hannibal Lecter memorabilia and he sells Hannibal's face mask for $250,000.<br /><br />Agent Starling is managing a huge bust of a drug ring and the apprehension of a female habitual criminal.  When the woman walks out of the warehouse she is guarded by three men and carrying a baby in a shoulder harness.  Starling calls off the bust but one of the local cops draws his gun and a street war breaks out.  The entire operation looks bad as Starling is shown carrying away a baby covered in blood and 5 people are killed.  Since she was in charge she takes the blame for the embarrassment to the FBI and other federal agencies involved in the bust that has gone bad.<br /><br />Mason Verger uses his wealth and influence at the justice department to get Starling reassigned to the recapture Hannibal Lecter.  His goal is to capture and kill Lecter as revenge for his torture, disfigurement and his being crippled......<br /><br />This is a very good movie for many reasons but unfortunately it is a sequel to a super top rated Silence of the Lambs film and it was not rated as highly as it should have been because of that.  This movie is well filmed and the cinematography is just spectacular from the scenes outside of the Verger mansion to the scenes shot in Italy.  It is also a detailed and macabre story and may be too intense for some people.<br /><br />The acting in this film is top notch and Julianne Moore as Clarice Starling did a wonderful job of replacing Jodie Foster in this role.  Every actor in this movie plays their role to perfection and this is what made this movie first class.<br /><br />I enjoyed this story and the movie for many reasons.  It is really a good film and worth watching.  I recommend it to you.  Just be aware it is gruesome and has several horrific scenes in it.  It is not for the weak of heart.</p></br><a href="../users/A25UZ7MA72SMKM.html">A25UZ7MA72SMKM</a><br/><p>In "Hannibal", I was looking for an epic battle of wits between the escaped, brilliant Hannibal and the focused, brilliant Clarice. Instead, for most of the movie we get Clouseau vs. Hannibal. At the same time Clarice is getting steadily beat down within the ranks of the FBI until she is finally put on suspension. Then we find that for some reason not well explained, Hannibal regards her in some sort of fatherly way ... though a predatory father to be sure.<br /><br />While this movie had less gore than I was expecting it to, it made up for it with some very unpleasant forms of graphically displayed death. This includes not one but TWO sequences of people being eaten by hungry boars. I suppose that is fitting, since hungry bore could well describe the director and screenwriter for what essentially became a waste of time for an intelligent viewer.<br /><br />Into the mix is thrown a horribly disfigured, extremely wealthy man with a grudge against Hannibal, and Hannibal didn't even exactly do the disfiguring, though he did encourage it. In the end this man's aide turns on him to gruesome result, and the motive for THAT is as thin as it gets too.<br /><br />While "Silence of the Lambs" was riveting, this film was drivelling. Hannibal's actions were all too predictable, and the general fates of everyone involved were telegraphed virtually from the beginning of the film. After 30 years of increasingly graphic violence in film, even the "gross out" scenes in "Hannibal" brought nothing really surprising or audacious.<br /><br />After the energy put into this role by Hopkins in "Silence of the Lambs", in "Hannibal" there was surprising little personality put into the character. Hopkins played him throughout as smug, thoughtful, and vindictive, but with none of the smarmy charm or sudden outbursts that in his first performance made the character engrossing if, well, gross. Moore is no Foster, either. In only a few scenes does she try to raise a real emotion, and those seem quite subdued compared to the circumstances which are meant to provoke them. Liotta brings some real reverse charm to his character, but it is so entirely unbelievable that his efforts are wasted. Even Gary Oldman is held back to smug in a mask. How do so many fine actors fail to deliver on the promise inherent in such meaty roles? I'll have to blame the director, who was evidently going for a feel that just didn't work in the finished product.<br /><br />Sadly, Hannibal is likely to put you to sleep, sans nightmares.</p></br><a href="../users/A6VFFRIHAXKRL.html">A6VFFRIHAXKRL</a><br/><p>Hannibal 10 years after Silence Of The Lambs this had a lot of expectation lot of people hate this movie I'll admit I didn't care for it when I saw it the 1st time but I saw it again I have to say it was a decent sequel not a good sequel but I find it decent espically when compared to Red Dragon which I don't care for or even Hannibal Rising which is s hi t  t y. Directed by Ridley Scott he directed Alien Thelma & Louise Blade Runner GI Jane Black Hawk Down among many other films. Starring Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter Julianne Moore as Clarice Starling Ray Liotta as Paul Krendler Giancarlo Giannini as Pazzi & Gary Oldman as Mason Verger. Story is about 10 years or so after Slience Clarice Starling is a veteran FBI agent you open up she & a team are going after some drug dealers they see the head girl of the gang she is carring a baby she calls the sting off but the Washington DC polic e jump the gun so to speak they get fired upon we get a big shoot out Clarice tells the head girl to surrender she shoots Clarice but she is wearing body armor of course she shoots & kills that head girl which lands her in hot water cause she was carring a baby. Meanwhile you got this cop in Florance Pazzi who is suspicous of this guy who he finds out that he is Hannibal Lecter. This 1 guy Mason Verger figures into the plot cause he has a bit of history with Hannibal cause he crippled him & had him mess his face up pretty good. So he'll use anybody to get back at Lecter. Clarice sees a survalance tape where she sees Lecter she tries to warn Pazzi in Florance not to go after him cause Pazzi is trying to catch him & get the reward money. While is trying to take Hannibal down Pazzi gets trapped he gets a brutal death. A cop is checking the area to see if Hannibal is ok of couse he did it & we get a good gore effect with the throat slicing. Clarice calls to try & warn Pazzi again but Hannibal is on the other end & we get "Hello Clarice." Hannibal travels to the US stalks Paul Krendler & Clarice. There is a great scene in the mall where Lecter is playing mind games with Clarice but some guys working for Verger capture him Clarice trakcs them down but is hurt & it then results in Verger & his henchies being eaten by these hogs or whaterver. Hannibal takes Krendler & drugs him Clarice too we get a Hannibal style dinner with a great effect with the brain. The screen play had to be rewritten 15 times which I'm going to admit there are some problems. At this time it had the highest body count of any Hannibal movie. Christopher Reeve was offered the role of Verger but he dropped out of the project. After Jodie Foster & Jonathon Demme dropped out of the project Hopkins was reluctant to reprise his role. David Fincher was slated to direct but dropped out I can understand cause of bad luck with 3rd installments. Hopkins had no say in who would play Clarice. Reviews were mixed. Over 30 minutes of footage was cut some of it was put back in for the TV version. Ridley Scott did good enough cause he was directing a sequel to Silence Of The Lambs. Anthony Hopkins was great they were going for a slasher icon vibe but I was ok with that & I was fine with upping the gore. Julianne Moore was alright I'd rather had played a different character she looked sort of like Jodie Foster but she played too different from her. I mean they could've changed some of the plot points around made it a sequel to Silence & made her, her own character. So no where near as good as Manhunter or Silence but at best it's decent sequel & I'd say go for the 2 disc version.</p></br><a href="../users/AIMR915K4YCN.html">AIMR915K4YCN</a><br/><p>Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) returns in this vast, wicked tale of revenge, murder, and insanity.

The novel itself is the best of the series, and the film, directed by one of my all time favourite directors, Ridley Scott, had to be a perfect combination, and Scott's artistic sensibility as a methodical director, certainly shows in this gripping film.<br /><br />There is so much in this film that needs to be pointed out in terms of its artistic "film" qualities: all aspects - score, location, costume, art direction, screenplay adaptation and of course the impeccable performance by Anthony Hopkins.<br /><br />Ridley Scott began as an art student and is well adept at pen and ink. It is known that he would show up early on location in Florence, and know one, not even the producers or Hopkins for that matter, knew what he would do next: because he would sketch the scenes in his note book at night, visualizing every scene - from the camera angles to the actors lines... for Ridley Scott, film is a real & true art form.<br /><br />Hannibal is one of the more interesting characters in popular literature/culture. An anti-hero of sorts, whose main reason for killing is rude people. In other words there seems to be a method to his madness.<br /><br />My wish was that the film ended in the same way as the book: much more final and chilling - which made more sense.<br /><br />Agent Starling relents in the book and through Hannibal's strength of will and power takes her to the dark side, both living quite well all over the world.<br /><br />However censorship is alive and well...<br /><br />For Starling to relent to Hannibal's hypnosis and power, to my way of thought, this was the perfect break through for a new story...rather than the terrible novel "Hannibal Rising" though the film however is exceptional; the tale should have moved forward rather than to its beginnings.<br /><br />Most fans disliked this film for strange reasons...though it is the best of the trilogy.</p></br><a href="../users/A356RFKNIG043B.html">A356RFKNIG043B</a><br/><p>This sequel is rather pointless and lacks most of what made Lambs great.<br />They spent the cash and got the pros---Scott, Mamet and Hopkins---but the lynchpin of the first movie has been removed and that kills it.<br /><br />Jodie Foster made you care about her; Julianne Moore does not. She's emotionally flat and quite boring, and the movie suffers greatly due to her weak performance as the character Foster made fascinating.<br /><br />Hannibal is also paced far too slowly and even when it's gory, in its faux-elegant way, it's not really scary. There's little suspense and the sudden weirdness of the last 20 minutes offers no payoff. Hopkins is good but without Foster's heart to play off there's not much to make this truly worth watching. Even the cannibal moments are kinda boring.<br /><br />I usually love Scott, but his grand shots are mostly lacking here and Mamet's script is too plodding to keep one entertained.<br /><br />Not even close to the quality of the original; if you really love that you might want to avoid this and Hannibal Rising. They add nothing to the story.</p></br><a href="../users/A284WUQS94AQ7A.html">A284WUQS94AQ7A</a><br/><p>Silence of the Lambs is one of my all time favorite movies.  I really liked and was impressed by Red Dragon, but this film is one of the best!  I missed Jodie Foster as Clarice Starling, at first, but Julianne Moore's portrayal was excellent!  I was pleasantly surprised by this movie.  Anthony Hopkins, again as Dr. Hannibal Lector, was superb!<br /><br />This movie started out with a scene that was powerful and lured you into the rest of the plot.  F.B.I. Agent Clarice Starling is placed on restrictions and has to more or less take on finding Hannibal Lector after his escape.  She meets his only survivor and fourth victim, Mason Verger (a wealthy pedophile), played by Gary Oldman, because he reported he has more information on Lector.  Verger is severely deformed from maiming himself at Lector's request.  Verger is a bit odd and this only adds to the excitement of the movie.  Lector is hiding out in Italy. An Italian cop who overhears agent Starling's request for a tape, decides he wants to capture Lector himself to claim the reward.  Things go worse for Starling and she has to turn in her badge and weapons, pending an investigation.  At this point she is drawn in to find Lector.  The rest of the movie is so action packed, I didn't even realize that this is over 2 hours long!  This has plenty suspense, action and gore, yes, gore!  Watch it and enjoy this it is a fantastic movie, but would you except anything less from Anthony Hopkins and Julianne Moore?</p></br><a href="../users/A13IKSGDYNBNQS.html">A13IKSGDYNBNQS</a><br/><p>This was an unpleasant surprise - its a very good film.<br />It doesn't have the same gut level horror as Silence of the lambs, but there are nevertheless some nerve shredding moments.<br />The cast are all good and if Julianne Moore isn't quite as good as Jodie Foster, shes very close.<br />The other reason this film is a success is because of director Ridley Scott. The settings in Florence are stunning and the whole look of the film is great. Ridley Scott always had a great eye for visuals!<br />OK so the very end is a bit unlikely, but this film will keep you entertained, and holds up to repeated viewings.

Verger is a strange character with a strange story.  His intentions are fairly clear from the outset, leaving the viewer only to watch how things unfold.<br /><br />The movie remains fairly interesting throughout, as the escaped Lechter is identified and opposing forces close in on him.  The table is set, however, about an hour in when we see Lechter dispatch his first would-be apprehender with a touch of "historical flair".<br /><br />Lechter and Clarice are soon after back in touch again and the time finally comes where they meet and communicate without the glass between them. So we have Verger with retribution at heart, Clarice with justice in her interest and Lechter with his usual intentions: a tasty recipe indeed, with a main course as bizarre as you will come to expect.<br /><br />This is a must-see for fans of the original and fans of the series in general.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AOKQCH0YBZDS.html">A3AOKQCH0YBZDS</a><br/><p>Julianne Moore is a phenomenal actress in other movies, but for some reason didn't bring the character of Clarice Starling to life on the silver screen for "Hannibal". Her portrayal of Clarice Starling was extremely flat and dead compared with Jodie Foster's performance of Clarice Starling in "Silence of the Lambs". So, I was sorely disappointed not to see Jodie Foster return to play the role of Clarice Starling in this movie as she gave a vibrant portrayal of this character.<br /><br />I've also read the book "Hannibal" by Thomas Harris and was completely disappointed that the filmmakers of "Hannibal" didn't keep the ending of the movie in line with that of the novel. The ending of "Hannibal", the movie version, felt empty and hollow without the original ending for which the author had intended.<br /><br />Plus other aspects of the storyline were a bit off too. Had "Hannibal", the movie version, had Jodie Foster playing Clarice Starling and other aspects of the movie, like the ending, been more accurate to the novel, I would have given it a higher rating.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R2ONSLAI3M2X.html">A1R2ONSLAI3M2X</a><br/><p>Great movie!! Although Hannibal is the 2nd movie released in The Silence Of The Lambs trilogy, it is actually meant to be the final movie. Red Dragon follows Hannibal but Red Dragon is actually the prequel to The Silence Of The Lambs. I rate this movie equally with Red Dragon, 4 stars. Once again, Anthony Hopkins delivers an outstanding and brilliant performance as Lecter. Although Jodie Foster is not in this movie ( wish she would have been ), Julianne Moore does give a good performance as Clarice Starling. It's hard not to compare her to Foster in this movie but it doesn't take away from this wonderful thriller. Great horror and violence in this one! as we see Lecter re-emerge in Italy. But this time, someone else has it in for Lecter and Starling is now on the case, trying to locate Lecter. Alot of violence and blood in this one! It will truly keep you entertained from beginning to end. Very well done! Very well written! and truly delivers as the sequel to Silence Of The Lambs!!! A must see for Lecter fans!!</p></br><a href="../users/A2F3SXHT6RBV81.html">A2F3SXHT6RBV81</a><br/><p>Julianne Moore is no Jodie Foster whom she attempted to emulate.  The man with deformed face is hideous.  The suspense may keep one on edge, with the scary music, but personally I was disappointed with this production.<p>This may be the sequel to SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, but it is not in the same class.  That one, I liked!<p>Anthony Hopkins (whom my late friend, Roz Mahoney, called 'Tony') is one of my favorite actors.  He is marvelous in anything he attempts.  He's made a multitude of entertaining films enjoyed by a vast, diverse audience of all ages.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZSC81MXLBELX.html">A2ZSC81MXLBELX</a><br/><p>This review refers to the Special Edition DVD of "Hannibal"(MGM)...<p>After the first viewing of this film I had it set in my mind that this was a three star movie.I thought it was pretty good, but it was no "Silence". I watched it again on this outstanding DVD, and viewed it as a seperate story from "Silence of the Lambs".I am glad I did, because it was the second time around that I realized what a great movie it is in it's own right.Under the direction now of Ridley Scott,a terrific screenplay by David Mamet and Steven Zaillian,stunning photography by John Mattheson, the haunting score by Hans Zimmer, and with a  brillant cast, "Hannibal" is a thrill ride you won't soon forget.<p>Based on the novel by Thomas Harris,the story picks up 10 Years after Dr. Lector(Anthony Hopkins) has made his escape. He is living in Italy and seems to be quite restless. After learning that his "beloved" Clarice(Julianne Moore)has been disgraced in a botched drug bust, he comes out of hiding and cleverly draws her into his web once more.The story is a bit more complex than that though.Along the way Clarice must deal with a cunning Agent(Ray Liotta) who is out to humiliate her, and a wealthy man who was a victim of Dr. Lector's, survived quite disfigured and is now out for revenge.Then there's the Italian Detective who has discovered the identity of Lector as well as the huge reward and decides to try his luck as well.Well, we all know by now what happens when you mess with Dr. Lector.You will never think of Ray Liotta as a "goodfella" again after you see what the Doc has planned for him! The story is a roller coaster ride of thrills and chills.Lots of suspenseful and nail biting scenes. This film is definetly not for the sensitive viewer.<p>There is no one else who could ever be Dr. "Hannibal" Lector other than Sir Anthony Hopkins. He's as terrifying as ever. Julianne Moore does a perfect take on a tougher and more mature Agent Starling.It's a departure for Ray Liotta from his usual style but he is perfect as the despicable nemesis to Clarice.I would also mention Giancarlo Giannini gives a great performance as the pitiful detective. The make up and special effects are so good, that I won't even mention who performs such an excellent job as the angry disfigured millionaire. I did not even realize who it was the first time until the end credits, and don't want to give it away for first time viewers.<p>Fans of this film will delight in this DVD. First of all the transfer is gorgeous. All the beautiful cinematography of Italy and it's famous historical landmarks are breathtaking, The picture is in the theatrical release widescreen. Choose between DTS or Dolby 5.1 Surround. The sounds are clear and distinctive and the score will take your breath away. Images and colors are excellent as well.This is a two disc set. There's a ton of goodies to watch. You can spend all day with Hannibal or watch a different feature each time you view the film. I especially enjoyed "Breaking the Silence" which runs well over an hour and encompasses every phase of the making of the film(it's broken into segments if you have something particular you are interested in.) The segment with Hans Zimmer was wonderful.For a full list of the featurettes please see the tech. info.It may also be viewed in French or Spanish and has subtitles in those as well as English for those who may need them.Altogether a dynamite package.<p>Get reaquainted with Dr. Lector,but remember..mind your manners at dinner!....Have fun...Laurie</p></br><a href="../users/ARA48345JZPZR.html">ARA48345JZPZR</a><br/><p>I read the book Hannibal and thought it was unfilmable.  I was pleasantly surprised therefore to find that two superb screenwriters, David Mamet and Steve Zaillion, were able to make the changes necessary to delete the parts of the book that didn't work while keeping the essence of Thomas Harris's exercise in dark malevolence.<p>Hannibal Lecter is the boogie man. He is the distillation of the nightmare villain...brilliant, cultured, educated, refined, erudite and thoroughly ruthless and bloodthirsty.  He is a creation of fiction, no more real than Dracula or Professor Moriarty.  He bears no resemblance to actual serial killers, who by and large are a drab, colorless, undistinguished lot.  Maybe that's why we are fascinated by Hannibal, all that talent and charm put to wicked uses.<p>Please note one thing, the book and the movie take place 10 years AFTER Silence of the Lambs.  Clarice Starling is not the wide-eyed innocent of Silence, but a street-tough working cop that is getting jerked around by the bureaucracy she has served faithfully and well. She is the only truly moral person in an unjust and cruel world.  It is that morality that ironically is her attraction for Hannibal. It would have been interesting to see, but I'm not sure Jody Foster could have brought that toughness to the role.  Julianne Moore did fine.<p>Anthony Hopkins owns the role.  As in Silence, it isn't him jumping out and going &quot;BOO!&quot; that makes us uneasy, it is the sinister stillness and self-posession of his Hannibal that frightens and chills.  All that evil nastiness contained within that can be unleashed at any time.  Hopkin's Hannibal is a marvelous creation of wit and charm, ridding the world of &quot;free range rude&quot;.<p>Speaking of nastiness, the movie is wickedly funny with lots of nasty tidbits.  &quot;Okee dokee, here we go now&quot; as matter-of-factly as an usher or a tour guide, &quot;bowels in or out?&quot;.<p>I don't know if Thomas Harris was trying to write a sequel so over-the-top lurid as a challenge to Hollywood &quot;I dare you to film this&quot; or if he looked around at a culture so harsh and unjust and cruel and crass that he decided to pour all of that into his book and pull a terrific stunt...make the cannibal the hero.  Regardless, he gave us a deliciously wicked read that Ridley Scott has transformed into a stylish and wicked movie.<p>Not for everyone's taste (pun intended) for sure, and not with the broad appeal of Silence, Hannibal exists on it's own terms and has it's own pleasures and rewards. The supporting performances are all fine, cinematography excellent. Finally, the material ultimately is not as emotionally engaging as Silence, and for that it just misses 5 stars...but another encounter with Clarice and Dr. Lecter is more interesting than most.</p></br><a href="../users/A38U2M9OAEJAXJ.html">A38U2M9OAEJAXJ</a><br/><p>&quot;Hannibal&quot; was a solid hit upon its release in February 2001, but, like the &quot;Godfather III,&quot; it stood in the shadow of its more superior predecessor. When word got out that &quot;Hannibal&quot; was going to be filmed, expectations were high, and critics gave the movie no love, often comparing it unfairly to the far better &quot;The Silence of the Lambs.&quot; But &quot;Hannibal,&quot; as a film by itself, is a decent picture, and should be watched with an open mind, flaws and all. Julianne Moore gave a great performance as Clarice Starling, although Anthony Hopkins verged on camp during his revisited role as Hannibal Lecter. Some of the scenes were so outrageously graphic, it was often hard to take them seriously and realize the full horror of Lecter's actions. But for all its shortcomings, &quot;Hannibal&quot; the DVD is a worthy purchase because MGM gave this disc such a deluxe treatment. The picture and sound are top-notch, while the features on the second disc inlcude multiple angle shots, documentaries, and other goodies. So my advice is this: if you hated &quot;Hannibal,&quot; then you're not going to find much to like here. But those who, like myself, found the film flawed but still entertaining should grab this DVD: it's among the best MGM has ever produced. It's clear that the studio put a lot a love into its making.</p></br><a href="../users/AV5G37VFE5NVD.html">AV5G37VFE5NVD</a><br/><p>After ten years, the world waited eagerly for the sequel to the legendary THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.  Finally, they have it - although I'm sure it's not at all what they expected.  HANNIBAL is the result of what most will see as a Ridley Scott-Anthony Hopkins-Hans Zimmer collaboration.  Adapted from Thomas Harris' best-selling (although much weaker) novel, HANNIBAL follows only the basic plot of the novel.  Anthony Hopkins returns to his Oscar-winning role as cannibal genius Dr. Hannibal Lecter, who is now roaming freely in Italy.  However, after many years he decides he'd like to come out of retirement; without spoiling any &quot;surprises&quot;, he attempts to make contact with FBI agent Clarice Starling (Julianne Moore, taking over from Jodie Foster), while running from his only surviving victim's (Gary Oldman) assassins.  Hopkins' performance is great and yet you can't help laughing at Dr. Lecter, so polite and yet the deadliest man alive; Moore tries her hardest, but she comes nowhere near close to taking up where Foster previously stood.  There is also a terrific score by Hans Zimmer; the highlight of the film, of course, however, is Scott's directing.  It may be the absolute weakest sequel THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS could have, but HANNIBAL is still a frightening and effective horror thriller.</p></br><a href="../users/A138826JMC0J3T.html">A138826JMC0J3T</a><br/><p>Hannibal was great!  It's a great psychological, suspense thriller that just chilling and all out, a great movie.  Anthony Hopkins returns as Dr. Hannibal Lechter, 10 years after SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.  Also starring in this is Julianne Moore as Clarice Starling and Ray Liotta and Gary Oldman.<p>It's been 10 years since Dr Lechter escaped from custody and his case has been all but forgotten except by 2 people, Clarice Starling and Mason Verger (Oldman), the only survivor of Hannibal Lechter.  Horribly disfigured and scarred thanks to Lechter, Verger has been waiting 10 years to exact revenge on Dr Lechter and now the time is finally right because Verger finds him.  Agent Starling then reopens the case in hope that she'll find him first and be abto find him in time before Verger gets a hold of him.<p>Hannibal isn't nearly as psychologically scary as SILENCE OF THE LAMBS was but I will say that it has a lot more gore in it.  Here's 2 perfect examples, the end scenes and the library.  Hopkins really puts up another quality performance as Dr Lechter.  There are 2 down sides to this movie.  Julianne Moore replaces Jody Foster as Clarice Starling.  It would have been nice to have the original, but Moore does a very good job.  The other thing is that the ending might disappoint a few people.  Personally, I thought it was a good ending and it added a bit a fear to it.  <p>Either way it goes, make sure you watch SILENCE OF THE LAMBS first because there are so many references to it that if you don't see it, than HANNIBAL won't seem as good to you.  I recommend this one to anyone who's into the series and to anyone who likes suspense thrillers because this one will do that for you.  Plus, Hopkins says the classic line "Hello Clarice".  Check out HANNIBAL!</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>Sometimes art gives us a villian that is more memorable and interesting than the hero. Witness for example the villians of STAR WARS: Darth Vader, Boba Fett, and Darth Maul; or the man-eating shark in JAWS; or Shakespeare's MacBeth or Iago. In 1991 another villian entered the collective group conscience and grew into a larger figure in the fabric of American pop culture. That villian's name is Hannibal Lecter and SILENCE OF THE LAMBS marked the beginning of his dynasty. Now he's back in a sequel that bears his name, HANNIBAL.<p>In the film it has been ten years since Lecter escaped from prison. He is now living in Italy as a Renaissance scholar named Dr. Fell. However, he is eager to come out of "retirement". The heroine of LAMBS, Clarice Starling, has been publicly humiliated by a botched drug raid and is put back on the Lecter case after the Justice Department gains new information concerning the cannibal's whereabouts. Starling chases the lead and the game begins anew.<p>Anthony Hopkins is wonderful as Lecter and Julianne Moore fills Jodie Foster's shoes well as Starling. Ridley Scott's direction is once again masterful and the other performances and crafts of the rest of the cast and crew are just as excellent.<p>With that said, HANNIBAL is a major disappointment. The movie starts off suspenseful, but soon falls into predictability. Sure there are a few gory twists and turns, but you know Lecter is going to escape and that he won't harm Clarice.<p>The movie started a controversy because of the violent, campy, gore. Certain individuals will want to see it just for those "cool" scenes. However, as much as I like Anthony Hopkins and as intriguing a character Hannibal Lecter is, the movie was a big let down. Just not enough substance.</p></br><a href="../users/A3QZXDBATXFNZX.html">A3QZXDBATXFNZX</a><br/><p>Ridley Scott's Hannibal in my opinion is just as good as the first one. Ridlet Scott blends hunting images with extremely graphic violence which in my opinion works very well together. I like how they show you the evil of Hannibal Lector. I think that was good the first one should you his good side this one shows his bad side. This film should have got the NC-17 rating for violence its one of the most violent films ever made.<br /><br /> WARNING: This film contains Extremely Graphic Prolonged Groesome violence and Graphic Cannablism.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ.html">A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ</a><br/><p>Hannibal is one fine film. It didn't go over well with critics and some of the audience, but it is good. Sure, it is no match whatsoever for the brilliant Silence Of The Lambs, but it is a good film nonetheless. We all know the story, so need to go over it. Anthony Hopkins is electrifying. You just need to hear his &quot;Lecter&quot; voice and you get goosebumps. He is not over the top, which I've heard in reviews. He is perfect. Julianne Moore is no Jodie Foster, who would've been nice to have aboard, but she is quite adequate. She is very good. She has the right look and charm to her to make it work and to have people not miss Jodie Foster too terribly. Giancarlo Gianinni was also good. He had a strong presence that was a great addition to the film. Gary Oldman was good as usual. The final 20 minutes were surprising indeed. I was shocked at how Lecter went about as if it were a normal everyday thing. It was unsettling to the max!. The confrontation in the kitchen between Lecter and Clarice was rather good. Not as intense as the original, but still a good scene. I was only disappointed by Ray Liotta. He wasn't given enough to do. It seems he was just added just so there was another bad guy oon Lecter's list. Anyways, this was a fine film. It's not really eerie or suspenseful like Silence was,but that's okay. In fact, a lot of the recent slasher films had more suspense.But this film wasn't necessarily about that. It works well on it's own. Don't expect anything as good or memorable as Silence.</p></br><a href="../users/A2C5LA07JCDWTN.html">A2C5LA07JCDWTN</a><br/><p>Hannibal is such a breath of fresh air in today's hollywood landscape. It is a film that is unapologetic and unflinching in its depiction of graphic violence. Most of today's so called &quot;horror&quot; films have been reduced to nothing more than cheap laughs and tight halter tops. Hannibal is the antithesis of the so-called &quot;modern&quot; horror film. Anthony Hopkins plays Hannibal Lechter to scary perfection. He is a refined, well educated, verbose, psychopath. Those who are suspect of the film because of the absence of Jodie Foster should read the title of the film, Hannibal. The great majority of Hannibal focuses on the title character and not Federal Agent Starling. Julianne Moore is servicable but is really a periphery character. Once again Ridley Scott has proven that he is one of the few remaining master directors in Hollywood and he continues to produce important and intriguing work. Overall, this is without a doubt a DVD that you should own not only for the film but for the extras including an alternate ending and deleted scenes. One word of caution: This film should NOT be viewed by children (especially the last 20 minutes). That said, enjoy and prepare to be shocked.</p></br><a href="../users/A3081Z4P774YR4.html">A3081Z4P774YR4</a><br/><p>This is one of those films that is a bit of a guilty pleasure for me. As it goes, FBI Agent Clarice Starling (Julianne Moore) is not in the best of places when she is put back on the investigation to find killer Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins). This is all part of the machinations of the only survivor of Lecter's attacks, Mason Verger (Gary Oldman, in a truly twisted performance) who wants nothing less than to use Lecter for pig food. Sure I can carp about the slight lapses in suspense (moreso when we leave the Italy sequences behind), the ending (not the &quot;dinner&quot; scene, but after that), and to some degree, the charcterization of certain characters. The thing is though, I still get wrapped up in the sick absurbity of it all. Visually, this film is just stunning (especially during the time in Italy), the music is quite beautiful (such as in the opera sequence), and even chilling in some places, like an eerie flashback involving Verger and his reason for wanting Hannibal Lecter dead (and to The Blue Danube, no less). Is it a good movie? The answer depends on what you expect from &quot;Hannibal&quot;. If you expect a straight forward thriller, at least you have a copy of &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;, right? If you expect a dark, gore-drenched little melodrama, then by all means, dig in.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DTCJV6KOMJOA.html">A1DTCJV6KOMJOA</a><br/><p>This film has nothing in common with its predecessor &quot;Silence Of The Lambs&quot; except that Anthony Hopkins once again plays Hannibal Lecter with that same witty and delicious sense of cunning and all out swarm and overt sex appeal. This paints a much more even film thatn its &quot;Silence...&quot;, where as in that film the whole atmosphere was swamped in a sort of thick unbearable nightmare.  This film is more visually driven giving the viewer a rush with the eyes instead of with the mind. The director Ridley Scott does what James Cameron did with Aliens after Scott filmed the original. Scott uses the films score and dark pallette to give the viewer a sense of displacement in the key scenes of the film. The story is quite simple lecter escapes his to new lands where we find a troubled Starling (Moore) who must put him back behind bars. The film has a perverse game of cat and mouse between Starling and Lecter that has them at key scenes being each others worst nightmares and at others being their saviors! Interms of sheer viewer involvement this film more than out does the original. Just watch the criss cross between columns and rained soaked cobbled streets as a niave pickpocket goes after Lecter only to be done away with. The story is dark, witty, gruesome, sexy and visually spectacular and does more than a great job of holding its own in cinema. If one is looking for the mind games and claustrophobic ambience of &quot;Silence Of The Lambs&quot; than watch that fillm instead.</p></br><a href="../users/A3I69IXPTDVKQF.html">A3I69IXPTDVKQF</a><br/><p>I have to say, it took me a while to getting around to seeing this.  I thought "Silence Of The Lambs" was good - it featured a great performance by Anthony Hopkins, and the rest of it was....good.  But that was about it, as far as I was concerned.  It just didn't really click with me, and it wasn't anything near the great movie I'd been hoping for, so when its sequel was released I didn't feel any great need to rush out and get it as soon as it was released.  A bit surprisingly though, I thought "Hannibal" was really great once I finally did see it.  Everyone said it was more geared toward horror than "Silence..." (which is fine by me) and it may have been, marginally.  But much more than that, it was just a Better horror movie than its predecessor, and it was also a better thriller and a better drama movie, in my opinion.  Hopkins is just as good, if not better, than he was as Dr. Hannibal Lecter the first time around, and while I usually don't like recasting roles in a movie (unless the actor or actress is playing a creature or monster or something where you don't see their real face or hear their real voice, and even there they sometimes end up getting the mannerisms wrong) Julianne Moore did a great job stepping into the Clarice Starling role originally played by Jodie Foster.<br /><br />  The movie centers around the hunt to find Lecter by the only victim of his original, pre-incarceration, carnage to survive - a thoroughly despicable pedophile who avoided ever being charged for his crimes by cutting a deal with prosecutors to give evidence against Lecter.  It seems like "Hannibal" has changed tract from "Silence" and is implying that most if not all of Lecter's victims May have been horrendous individuals who in some way brought his wrath down upon themselves.  Whether that's the truth or whether it was just this one victim who was so reprehensible, the effect was to create a foil for Hannibal who's even more evil than he is.  Hannibal Lecter himself is, well, he's not a 'good guy' in this movie; he is, though, presented in very cryptic shades of grey.  His behaviors contradict one another but do so in a way that feels real, and he's much more interesting as a character this time around.  Clarice also is; she comes across here as a character who's somehow traumatized, perhaps even mentally unbalanced, deep down but supresses it so well that it took a genius like Lecter to ever see it, and that's what so intrigued him in the first place.  One possible interpretation of things overall (and this is just one of many potential takes on it; the movie briefly and subtly hints at so many different things that you could take away just about anything from it - making it a great source of conversation for movie-lovers) is that Hannibal Lecter is a person who had/has the potential for great goodness within himself but chose evil, while Clarice Starling has the potential for great darkness and Hannibal-level violence in her, but chose to be good, chose in fact to make her career in opposing those who give in to the same darkness.  A lot of food for thought in this one (no pun intended).<br /><br />  Great performances all around; in notable addition to Hopkins and Moore the brilliant Gary Oldman plays Lecter's nemesis and the chronically overlooked and under-rated Ray Liotta plays an unlikable, rather creepy FBI agent who's constantly at odds with Starling.  A very, very engaging and wel-made movie.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>When Thomas Harris wrote Hannibal, it was a safe bet that a film wouldn't be far along.  Silence of the Lambs director Jonathan Demme and star Jodie Foster declined to take part in Hannibal claiming they found the story distasteful; so director Ridley Scott (Black Hawk Down, Gladiator, Alien) and actress Julianne Moore (replacing Foster as FBI Agent Clarice Starling) were brought into this disappointing follow up.  Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins reprising his Oscar winning role), now living the life of luxury in Italy, finds himself on the run from Mason Verger (an unrecognizeable and uncredited Gary Oldman), a former patient who at Hannibal's advice peeled off part of his face.  Meanwhile, Clarice finds her career on the downward spiral as she as used as bait by Verger to lure Lecter out of hiding.  The suspense can't hold up to that of Silence of the Lambs (movie or book that is) and Scott's direction, even though he gives it his own slick look, is disappointing.  Moore, as good an actress as she is, can't hold a candle to Jodie Foster as we find the once strong willed but vulnerable Clarice be more of a victim here than anything else.  Finally, Hopkins just isn't scary anymore as Hannibal &quot;The Cannibal&quot; Lecter.  That alone is probably the worst part of the film, and while Hannibal isn't necessarily bad, it's one of the most disappointing films to be released over the past few years.  The cast also includes Francesca Neri, Frankie Faison, and Ray Liotta in the film's most infamous scene.</p></br><a href="../users/A29QA79VLQGHY6.html">A29QA79VLQGHY6</a><br/><p>In a marketing no-brainer, MGM  Home Entertainment has dove-tailed a new version of &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; with the video debut of that suspense classic's controversial sequel, &quot;Hannibal.&quot; The film, directed by Ridley Scott, transports upscale villain Hannibal Lecter from the hills of the Eastern U.S. to the mopeds and Michelangelos of Florence, Italy. While &quot;Lambs&quot; was awash in algae green, &quot;Hannibal&quot; is cast in pale blues. Colors on the disc are often flat but fine. There is at least one instance of speckling. The DTS and Dolby Digital audio mixes are a great improvement on &quot;Lambs,&quot; but remain subdued by action-picture standards. Julianne Moore plays FBI veteran Clarice Starling as a  weary centurion, one used to the violence of the streets, but still affected by it. She aptly renders the clipped speech Jodie Foster used in the original, making it more naturalistic and beliveable. Scott, in his mostly focused director's commentary, notes that Moore's great talent is to be &quot;always different in films she does.&quot; Hopkins delivers a cartoon take on his aging Lecter, single-handedly bringing to mind the 007 transition from Sean Connery to Roger Moore. &quot;Hannibal's&quot; notoriety, of course, is based on its final scenes, in which any veneer of seriousness is stripped away. &quot;This has got to be funny,&quot; Scott observes, calling the cannibalism sequence &quot;the outrageous target at  the end of the film.&quot; A &quot;very amused&quot; medical specialist was present on the set to ensure plausibility at the dinner table, says Scott, who tells more than you'd ever want to know about brain surgery (&quot;The brain bleeds like a pig&quot;). The filmmakers struggled with three possible endings, two of which were shot. One alternative ending -- included among the disc's 20 minutes of deleted scenes -- eliminates the bloody handcuff twist. Another scene, never shot, provided a James Bond-style ending, Scott reveals. The deleted scenes are far better than usual. One elegaic Florence scene features Hopkins/Hannibal playing a haunting original composition on piano. Other extras include a surreal but unused title sequence, an interactive breakdown of key scenes offering multiple camera angles, a series of making-of featurettes, and the usual photo galleries and TV spots.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F.html">A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F</a><br/><p>I recently watched "Hannibal" again and I realized I forgot how good a film this is. Directed by Ridley Scott (most famous for "Thelma and Louise") "Hannibal" stars Anthony Hopkins in the role that made him a household name. As Hannibal Lecter Mr. Hopkins is sophisticated, articulate, and most of all terrifying in his attempt to keep the FBI from recapturing him after escaping police custody in "The Silence of The Lambs". I'm not a fan of sequels but this movie works. With an excellent script "Hannibal" is one of those cinematic masterpieces both in story content and look. A lot of the film was shot in Europe and the background adds to the mood of the film. Julianne Moore replaces Jodie Foster in the Clarice Starling role and it is evident, but according to reports Foster couldn't be persuaded to return. Five minutes into the film, however, you forget a different actress is playing one of the biggest parts which is a testimony to the wonderful actress Moore is. "Hannibal" was also a boxoffice smash grossing over $350,000,000. This exquisite two disc set features an array of bonus features that will pleasure the most ardent Hannibal fan. Included is an alternate ending, commentary by Scott, over 35 minutes of deleted scenes, a great featurette on the making of the movie, TV Spots, and more. "Time" magazine calls "Hannibal"..."Thilling". There are also two prequels to "The Silence of The Lambs", the first of which is called "The Red Dragon" that recounts the story of how Lecter was originally captured and there is "Hannibal Rising" that documents Hannibal at a young age and how he became a monster. Both films are worth purchasing.</p></br><a href="../users/AIFXFHO2N9WJB.html">AIFXFHO2N9WJB</a><br/><p>After huge critical success with "The Silence of the Lambs" in 1990 it was really surprising that MGM didn't rush to throw a sequel together to cash in on this new archvillain that had been immortalized by Anthony Hopkins, in Dr. Hannibal Lecter.  Thankfully, Hollywood showed restraint and instead of trying to write a sequel based on characters created by terrific psychological/suspense writer, Thomas Harris, and risking the destruction of a franchise, the sequel would not be put to film until writer Thomas Harris finished writing the sequel, "Hannibal".  By waiting Hollywood and MGM Studios were given a terrific starting point for their screenplay, this one taken directly from the creator's head instead of merely guessing what the author had in mind for the further crimes of Hannibal 'the Cannibal' Lecter.<br /><br />"Hannibal" is set approximately 10 years after the events of "The Silence of the Lambs", Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) is still on the FBI's most wanted list, but continues to flourish in Europe under an assumed name, while working as a musuem curator.  Sadly, FBI agent Clarice Starling (Julianne Moore took the part after Jodie Foster chose not to return) has not had as successful of a career in the FBI as she had hoped.  In truth, after Lecter assisted Clarice in bringing the killer "Buffalo Bill" to justice in the last movie, she really hasn't had a really successful case, leaving many to wonder is Clarice Starling really FBI material or does she need the evil Dr. Lecter to assist her in solving crimes.  Lecter, it seems, is aware of Clarice's fall from FBI grace, and seeks to exploit this weakness by baiting Clarice to come after him in Europe.  Is Clarice only a few steps away from bringing one of the most notorious murderers of all time to justice, or merely a pawn in one of his twisted mind games?<br /><br />"Hannibal" delivered a sequel to audiences that gave both thrills and chills.  Though a different tone and type of a movie than "The Silence of the Lambs" which was more cerebral, "Hannibal" was made to be more of a chase movie, than a psychological game.  Many critics felt that this was where director Ridley Scott (Gladiator) messed up, he should have stuck to the cerebral side of the characters, or left the movie alone completely.  In my opinion this was a great way to end the story that was started in "The Silence of the Lambs" between Clarice and Hannibal.  This movie didn't need to be so intensely cerebral, because the previous film covered that angle, for this movie to succeed Clarice needed to take matters into her own hands and attempt to bring Hannibal to justice.  Where critics are wrong is in the fact that, though not as intensely psychological, Hannibal does play mind games throughout the movie in very intriguing and interesting ways, giving audiences enough story and drama to propel the chase onward, and keep them on the edge of their seats.<br /><br />One thing critics and audiences can agree on is that the acting is terrific in this film, as it has been throughout the entire series of films.  Anthony Hopkins shined once again as the psychotic Hannibal Lecter, and Julianne Moore filled the role of Clarice Starling in a very believable way, where Jodie Foster portrayed Clarice as a more naive, impressionable young cadet, Julianne delivered a colder, more world-weary agent of the FBI.  Though I missed Jodie Foster, I respect her decision to opt out of returning to a character that propelled her even farther into superstardom, but since she didn't feel the character was the same person she knew from "The Silence of the Lambs" she may not have done as good of a job interpreting Clarice for this movie, so it was probably a wise decision on her part after all.<br /><br />Overall, "Hannibal" is a great ending to what was started in "The Silence of the Lambs", though it's not as good as its predecessor, it still is an incredibly worthy sequel, and should not be missed.<br /><br />"Hannibal" is rated R for violence and language.</p></br><a href="../users/A457S8SW690NM.html">A457S8SW690NM</a><br/><p>3 and 1/2 stars<br />I watched this film after reading the book. The book was average but not at all as good as the brilliant silence of the lambs. This movie was a big dissapointment to me because after watching the silence of the lambs, I expected another masterpiece. But, I was wrong. Red Dragon was actually much better than this also.<br />But, this movie isn't at all bad, it's a descent movie, better than a lot that I have seen, but after the two others in the series, it was a letdown. Hopkins was of course at his best, and Julliane Moore did well as a replacement for Foster, but Foster was still better. Gary Oldman was also very good as Mason Verger. Hannibal is loose in this film and Clarice Starling and the FBI are trying to hunt him down. Of course, there are many great scenes in this movie, but it fell short of amazing. The ending was very good though, and was much better than Harris's ending.<br />The difference between the silence of the lambs and this is that while the silence of th lambs is creepy because of the cinmatography, Jane Gumb's and Hannibal Lector's characters, and true suspense, this one repulses you by throwing horrifying and disturbing images on the screen. There's a big difference there as you can see.<br />If you liked the silence of the lambs, you'll like this, but you won't love it. But, it is a better movie than the book was. The book was more of a dissapointment, but this movie tried its hardest to turn an average book into a remarquable movie. It ended up being a little short of great, but ended up still being a good movie, that is recommended for fans of the series.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>I was kind of disappointed by the film at first because it cuts off the second half of the book, the part I definitely preferred because it showed so well there is a real love affair going on between the criminal and the cop who is tracking him. Catching a serial killer is the story of a seduction : the seducing of the cop and the seducing of the killer by the other proponent in each case. But the film has qualities that are undeniable. It is a good thriller, though a little bit fast and consequently skimpy. The end is gross, even if the alternative ending is a lot better, because it keeps the main door open. The official ending closes all doors and locks them up so tight there is no escape from the horror this Hannibal inspires in Clarisse, respect, maybe or of course, but horror all the same. It explores a little bit the extreme culture of this man, his phenomenal way to impersonate practically anyone and charm practically any audience. He is a man who can be on the alert all the time and knows what his opponents are going to do next, even before they know themselves. It is funny how he is not at all disquieted by his being caught by his old high school or university gay offering to the God of death and style, because he knows this Mason has made a mistake : he has called him back by endangering Clarisse and she will know why she has been endangered and by whom, and she will react according to her instinct, she will come after him, Hannibal, because she cannot even doubt he is at stake and she was the bait, and she has to capture him alive, hence to go into the hornet's nest to get him free and then arrest him. That is not going to work exactly like that but the reducing of the rotten justice department offcial to a mumbling kid if not baboon is such a nice thing to see. A young promising man who cannot resist his fascination for easy money and endangers his own colleagues, even uses them as bait and nothing but trap-meat. That is what our system of containing evil instead of reforming it leads to. There is always someone who will take advantage of the situation. That is western corruption and we are experts at it. At the same time this film, for the second time (Red Dragon proved the contrary but The Silence of the Lambs went the opposite way), proves that the famous FBI profiling technique is just a gimmick in the technology of crime-fighting and nothing else. A real serial killer is intelligent enough to foresee what the police is going to do and thus to lead them along the way instead of being trapped by their profiling. A real serial killer is also able to check all computers and sites and know that someone has put their greasy fingers in some files that concern him. If he buys a certain perfume in some luxury boutique anywhere in the world, he wants it to be an indicator of his whereabout to get out of the police what he wants, because he knows there is a camera filming hom and a simple mirror will tell him he is being watched. And he always succeeds because teh police works serially too and very little creatively. He does not want to stay in hiding. He wants to come out and act, so he calculates the action he desires and wishes and he pulls all the strings. It is a shame that the film cuts off the second part of the book and makes it impossible for Hannibal to get out of the chase, but it is a good film and the book is quite different with a serial killer who finally wants to get out of it and tries, maybe succeeds, to do so. Watch and enjoy the film, then read the book and enjoy the difference. Then enjoy the second disk, the alternative or rejected scenes (probably not all of them), the making of, and many other elements. You'll learn a lot about filmmaking and that will give some depth to your pleasure. We are finally reaching the acme of visual art by being provided with the backstage scenes and the backroom discussions. The cinema with the DVD is becoming like the Bible with the fingerprints of Jesus and his full authentic biography certified by the Roman Emperor himself and at least two dozens of eye-witnesses testifying under oath in some Supreme Court of Historical Truth.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU</p></br><a href="../users/AZSN1TO0JI87B.html">AZSN1TO0JI87B</a><br/><p>Following a decade after the enormously successful and critically acclaimed "Silence of the Lambs," "Hannibal" was a sequel that I (and many others) had questioned the quality of. After all, most sequels that come along this late are usually pointless and can't capture the magic of their predecessor or just flat out stink. "Hannibal," though surely a different film, does not stick to routine sequel formula. This film stands by itself. Anthony Hopkins returns to his role as Hannibal "The Cannibal" Lecter and Julianne Moore replaces Jodie Foster as FBI Agent Clarice Starling. Both actors do superb jobs, especially Julianne Moore (who I have always liked) who had a lot to live up to. Clarice, having just been accused of botching a drug-bust, is temporarily stripped of her duties as an FBI agent and is put to the task of revisiting an old-case of hers: Hannibal Lecter. She is given the job of tracking him down, and after receiving a letter from "H," she slowly, but surely, pinpoints his location: Florence, Italy. Problems arise as another detective in Florence is on Hannibal Lecter's trail after receiving word of a large award granted by one of Hannibal's victims, who wants nothing more to see "H" suffer and who will pay any price. The movie relies on a lot of gore. Gallons more than "Silence of the Lambs" did. Exposed brains, exposed intestines, exposed skulls, it's all here and it's about as nasty as it's R-rating will allow it to be. But still, the movie maintains it's dignity, despite being an all-out gorefest. The movie is both beautiful and terrifying. Ridley Scott (Alien, Gladiator) did an excellent job directing. Like the title says, he does a superb job of balancing style with substance. Purists will hate it because it is a lot different from "Silence of the Lambs" and even "Manhunter." But, really, the movie is it's own movie, and if you keep that in mind, you too will enjoy it.</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>At the end Hammer films churned out a number of overwrought films with heavy handed direction and weak scripts. What has all that got to do with Hannibal? Read on and you'll find out. First, the title should have been a dead give away that this was not SOL or Red Dragon. <p>Hannibal has more in common with Alien than with Silence Of The Lambs. Ridley Scott has made a mainstream horror film. It's a shell game really. Scott has taken the genre trappings and put them under another walnut too swiftly for most folks to see. The baroque novel that Thomas Harris wrote really wasn't a very good sequel to his two popular bestsellers Red Dragon and SOTL. The screenplay does the best with what it's got. <p>The performances are over the top as can be expected in a gradiose horror spectacle. Gladiator, Scott's previous film, took Spartacus and merged it with a sword and sandal b movie creating a new sort of gory epic. With the added element of that film's satire (greatly on display in Hannibal as well), this uneasy alliance of different genres worked pretty well.<p>It's a pity that Jodie Foster didn't return to the role of Clarice Starling. Having Julianne Moore play the role brings a different element to the role. She has a world weariness and maturity that Foster might not have been able to bring to the table. That's not slightling Foster. It's a compliment to Moore in that she brought her own interpretation and emotional baggage to the role. Anthony Hopkins is, as befits his character, all over the place. He overplays the role a bit but it works given the film's context as a horror film. Ray Liotta plays a scummy FBI agent that is everything Starling is not -- a perfect foil who is more glory hound and politican than devoted government agent.<p>The screenplay improves Harris' feeble novel. The elements that were taken out are more in line with how the audience believed the characters would behave. In fact, it seems as if Harris' novel has completely different characters with the same names as in the previous work. That's not the case with the film. It's true to its character sources. <p>Is this film detestable? Frankly, there are moments that are pretty disgusting. But these moments also prevent Hannibal from becoming the anti-hero of the piece. He does unpleasant and disgusting things because he's evil. There's no cosmic sense of justice at work. That's where Moore's performance as Starling works well--she becomes the moral center of the film. Despite her dishonor, she continues to hold on to her sense of morality. It isn't dictated by politics but by what is right. <p>The film runs too long and the convulted plot doesn't hang together as well here as it did in SOTL (or Red Dragon). The later is due to the poor source material. I read Harris' book and, frankly, he was trying to destroy the sense of "romance" that had arisen around these two characters. While his intention was honorable, the plotting for Hannibal was sloppy and the character motivations poorly thought out. The screenwriters do a good job of cleaning up the book and making the story more coherent and presentable. Scott does keep Harris' tone though and that's probably what disgusts people more than anything else but it was meant to disgust at the same time as entertain.<p>You'll enjoy this film if you accept it not as a thriller but as a horror film. Silence Of The Lambs was a thriller in the Hitchcockian sense. Hannibal is clearly informed by all the European (particularly Italian) low budget horror films made during the 70's and 80's. Hannibal could have been directed by Mario Bava (if he was alive of course) with similar results. The film is powerful, unpleasant and atmospheric. It's also entertaining in a sick sort of horror film way. Which is precisely what Scott was aiming for. The cult of Lecter needed to be shaken up so that the audience can see him for what he is; a charming, arrogant sociopathic monster. Hannibal is a clear descendant of the type of films Hammer churned out in the late 60's and early 70's. Perhaps that's how it was intended. I'd suggest avoiding Hannibal if you're pretty easily sickened by gore.</p></br><a href="../users/AK7D1BHZOSOL1.html">AK7D1BHZOSOL1</a><br/><p>No I take that back it wasn't nuts it was flipping crazy!!  Now I love Silence of the Lambs but this was just God-awful WAY too violent and just flat out gross.  This movie releyed on Anthoney's canabalism to scare the [heck] out of you.  Slience of the Lambs was much more suspenseful from a psychological stanpoint.  If you have any respect at all for the first movie aviod this just terrible sequel.</p></br><a href="../users/ATS7LYGLUX34L.html">ATS7LYGLUX34L</a><br/><p>When Hannibal was eating his way through theaters earlier this year, I thought to myself &quot;I can't wait for the DVD!!!&quot; I live for the behind-the-scenes stuff, so I was dying to find out how the filmmakers accomplished the effects...Gary Oldman's Verger makeup, the pigs, the climactic buffet scene....so did the DVD deliver? Pretty much. The deleted scenes were very good, and I was especially pleased to see a VERY long sequence concerning Inspector Pazzi's hunt for the infamous &quot;Il Mostre&quot;. These scenes really fleshed out the characters. The 5 behind the scenes featurettes are informative, even if there is virtually NOTHING about the Verger makeup. I really enjoyed the the poster gallery, as well. The film itself looks great, and the commentary by Director Ridley Scott is a keeper. I especially liked his overview of the 3rd ending they were considering. Couldn't they have filmed the Book's ending though?</p></br><a href="../users/AB2AQMK9PCWWX.html">AB2AQMK9PCWWX</a><br/><p>....man! All the pieces were there but, it just did not come off right. My chance to play director...? Goody, goody!<p>First, I would have skipped sections of Lector actually talking face to face with anyone in the early sections of the film and allowed his story to be told &quot;Roshomon&quot; like by Verger, by Barney, by Pazzi, by Florence denizens. I'd then have Lector  shown in the Florence shadows, the darkened corners, the musty street markets and have Hopkins still do the creepy voice overs, like when Clarice listens to the tapes and his reading aloud the Dante cantos, but I would not have him real-time interact with any other characters til he somehow confronts Pazzi AFTER his Dante lecture. Then Pazzi's cell phone rings and it's...Clarice.<p>Lector is supposed to be a man-myth, shrouded in mystery and danger...a bad actor infamous all over the world....like film antihero Kaiser Sose and Scott missed playing up on that. This from the man who scared the whatsis from me with &quot;Alien&quot;. I also expected a cinematic moment a la Brett and Scarlett when Lector carries Clarice from the wild boar pit. Also missing was that Clarice was supposed to start to become as nefarious as Lector...<p>Like I said, the pieces were there, but not connecting. The beautiful cinematography seemed to beg for a more masterfully told story. The music was operatic and appropriate but the libretto lacked the passion it should have delivered. In trying so hard not to become melodramatic, it ends up being melodramatic...</p></br><a href="../users/A2198FZZMTJ38H.html">A2198FZZMTJ38H</a><br/><p>&quot;Hannibal&quot; is everything that &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; is not. So much does director Ridley Scott push the envelope with excessive bloodshed and drawn out sequences, that he loses touch with the magic of the first film, that which made the hairs on our neck stand up. The film is well acted and grand in scale, but without a familiar sense of dread and mystery to keep us intrigued, it chews itself to pieces. <p>The film kicks into gear with a chase sequence that looks like a deleted scene from Scott's earlier film, &quot;Gladiator,&quot; as Clarice Starling, now played by Julianne Moore, guns down a well-known drug ring operator. Her conduct in apprehending the suspect gets her demoted, and for a good hour or so of the movie, she will spend most of her time rummaging through files on Hannibal Lecter, reprised by Anthony Hopkins, who escaped from the law at the end of the previous film. <p>Her investigation leads her to Mason Verger, one of Lecter's victims, who is out for revenge. Verger is played by Gary Oldman, who is probably doomed to look like someone other than himself in any role he plays. His promise of a hefty reward catches the eye of an Italian police officer, who has spotted the famed cannibal masquerading as an art collector in Italy. He intends to turn Lecter in to Verger, ignoring the constant warnings from Starling and unaware of the real danger involved in meddling in Lecter's life. <p>The setup is good, but the execution and payoff are constantly tedious. &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; had a low-key feel to it, something not quite so Hollywood or glossy. Director Jonathan Demme was able to evoke genuine suspense and tension through his photography, the fittingly creepy and downtrodden score of Howard Shore, and through the unconventional and frightening connection between its two lead characters, Lecter and Clarice. <p>Ridley Scott gives &quot;Hannibal&quot; all the guts (literally), grandeur and Hollywood glitz money can buy, something that this sequel does not need; in fact, it's a diminishing trait. His attention to cheap thrills with the use of violence and gory murders ruins the effect that Hannibal Lecter has on us. In the first film, he was frightening because of his ability to penetrate Clarice's mind, and through that, he found escape. Here, he is free to roam the Earth without worry, and witnessing his violence, I lost what little respect I had for him. <p>This attention to gloss diminishes any mystery or intensity we may have had in the beginning. Unlike &quot;Lambs,&quot; which kept its secrets until the blazing, bloody end, &quot;Hannibal&quot; has no secrets to reveal. Starling's hunt for Lecter turns into a cat-and-mouse hunt, which comes too little to late towards the film's end. Those of us who know the relationship these two character had in the beginning know full well that any filmmaker would sooner hang himself than deny us a final confrontation involving the two. This confrontation is the cheese atop the cracker, a finale that is more laughable than it is horrific, and further decimates the connection of these two muddled souls. <p>Anthony Hopkins still churns out a very kinetic performance as Lecter, employing wit and intelligence through his character. We may never feel anything for the new Lecter, but the old Hopkins has not changed a bit since his days behind a pane of glass. Julianne Moore takes over where Jodie Foster left off; her acting is wonderful. In fact, it's not really Foster that we miss, but the traits of her character from the previous outing. This Clarice is given little to go on, and doesn't grab the audience's attention quite like the past Clarice. <p>High hopes and high expectations abound, &quot;Hannibal&quot; became one of 2001's most anticipated films, and one of its biggest disappointments as well. It's mind-boggling to see just how much cinema has changed in the last decade; &quot;Lambs&quot; is genuine, while &quot;Hannibal&quot; is standard fodder.</p></br><a href="../users/A3QZCA4LTTVGAD.html">A3QZCA4LTTVGAD</a><br/><p>I went to see &quot;Hannibal,&quot; the sequel to the unforgettable horror-suspense classic &quot;The Silence of the Lambs,&quot; with great anticipation. And was I in for a surprise. I found &quot;Hannibal&quot; to be more of a grotesque comedy than a true horror film. Still, the film has genuine suspense and gross-out thrills.<p>Anthony Hopkins reprises his role as Hannibal, the cannibalistic serial killer, and he is clearly having fun. Unlike the first film, &quot;Hannibal&quot; begins with the title character free and living the good life in Italy. Julianne Moore replaces Jodie Foster in the pivotal role of FBI agent Clarice Starling, who hunts for Hannibal (and, I might add, she's quite good in the role).<p>But Hannibal is also being hunted by the agents of Mason Verger, a &quot;reformed&quot; child molester who was repulsively mutilated by Hannibal and who wants revenge. Gary Oldman clearly relishes this outrageous role, and the make-up effects for this character are truly spellbinding. Verger's fiendish plans for Hannibal involve a herd of man-eating pigs. Add to the mix Giancarlo Giannini as an avaricious Italian cop on Hannibal's trail and Ray Liotta as Starling's sleazeball colleague, and you have a truly Jerry Springer-ish collection of oddballs.<p>Some bemoaned the film's gore, but I found &quot;Hannibal&quot; to be an outrageous good time. In fact, the violence is so absurdly baroque that it is funny--&quot;Hannibal&quot; plays almost like a coolly intelligent spoof of &quot;splatter&quot; films. And the exquisite musical score and locales add to the filmgoer's pleasure quotient.<p>No, &quot;Hannibal&quot; is not in the same league as &quot;The Silence of the Lambs,&quot; which is a true landmark of horror and suspense cinema. But this film is a unique thrill ride of its own.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>Hannibal (Ridley Scott, 2001)<br /><br />Really, the first question you have to ask yourself is, "what were these people thinking?" Four-time Oscar nominee Julianne Moore, Oscar winner Anthony Hopkins, Oscar nominee Giancarlo Giannini, critical darling Gary Oldman (who should have already won at least two Oscars by now), and Golden Globe nominee Ray Liotta manage to embarrass themselves in front of the camera, while Oscar winner Ridley Scott and Oscar nominee David Mamet (of all people to adapt Harris' novel, why Mamet?) do the same in the rear. All of these people have proven themselves, in some cases many times over, as brilliant workers in film. I mean, Ridley Scott has directed both one of the finest horror films and one of the finest science fiction films of all time. Mamet's House of Games is one of the finest films ever made in any genre. The actors speak for themselves.<br /><br />I assume what they were all thinking is that Hannibal could be Silence of the Lambs II. The problem being that Ted Tally took Thomas Harris' almost aggressively mediocre novel and made something great out of it, and neither Tally nor Jonathan Demme was all too slavish about keeping things Harris-ized. Mamet and Scott, on the other hand, were slavish to Harris' even more aggressively mediocre novel in all the wrong places. Worse, they took the only part of the novel that really worked and destroyed it. I'd put off seeing Hannibal for four years because I expected it to be bad, but I certainly didn't expect the travesty that I actually got.<br /><br />There is, to be fair, some decent acting. All of it, every last bit, comes from Anthony Hopkins, who here still manages to keep Hannibal Lecter from being a complete self-parody (as he was in Red Dragon the year following). The rest of the cast can be written off. Had Hannibal been a one-man play, it would likely have been far more satisfying.<br /><br />Avoid at all costs. *</p></br><a href="../users/A152C8GYY25HAH.html">A152C8GYY25HAH</a><br/><p>Novelist Thomas Harris has written three books about Hannibal Lecter - The Silence of the Lambs, its prequel, Red Dragon, and the sequel, Hannibal. The books, with their scenes of graphic and horrific violence, are more readable than they are filmable. This has not stopped Hollywood, of course, which has even filmed Red Dragon twice - once in 1986 as Manhunter and now under the original title in a version due to be released in 2002. <p>Hannibal nearly didn't become a movie. In his books, Harris created two famous characters, Lecter and FBI Agent Clarice Starling, whom Jodie Foster recreated for the movie of Silence of the Lambs. Ms. Foster won the Oscar for best actress, and the role became the one for which she is most famous. Hannibal's problems arose after Foster declined to play Starling again. The book's ending showed the character doing things Foster felt her Clarice would never do. This is a classic case of artistic differences. Harris had created his version of Starling, and Foster had created another one. Eventually it was agreed that the ending would be changed, but, by then, Foster was no longer available. Getting Hopkins to agree to do Lecter again had never been a problem. Luckily, the producers discovered that another enormously talented actress, Julianne Moore, was available, and project was saved. <p>This movie takes place several years after Dr. Lecter's escape from a mental institution, and he's still on the loose. Clarice remains with the FBI. She isn't the naive young woman she was when she first did battle with the demented doctor. She's a seasoned veteran and has a hard edge to her. Just as she begins to suspect that Lecter has resurfaced in Florence, Italy, she gets involved in a botched FBI operation and is suspended from the bureau. This slows her down but hardly stops her pursuit of him, as she and Lecter are inevitably drawn together through the strange and twisted bond they established long ago. Meanwhile, in Italy, local police inspector Rinaldo Palli [Giancarlo Gianinni], who is more interested in the huge reward posted by one of Lecter's victims than in justice, is about to learn that the doctor is not someone you play dangerous games with. <p>Once more Anthony Hopkins is brilliant as Lecter. He's such a great actor that he could probably entertain us just by reading from a telephone directory. It's not his fault that the character is not quite as interesting this time. One of the most fascinating things about him in Silence of the Lambs was the fact that he was confined to a cell and had to use his mind to envision what Clarice was telling him. Since he is free in Hannibal, the role doesn't require Hopkins to use quite so many acting skills. Moore does well in the rather thankless job of replacing Foster. She wisely doesn't attempt to duplicate any mannerisms her predecessor used. She playa Starling as she might have been when she was older. Ray Liotta is sufficiently sleazy as a government official who is Starling's arch nemesis. Gary Oldham has a major role, but he isn't listed in the opening credits and is impossible to recognize except in one short flashback. <p>I have some fairly major complaints about the movie. The script isn't as strong as Lambs' was because it veers away from the psychological aspects. This makes it far less chilling on an intellectual level. Much of its violence is gratuitous and seemingly meant to gross the viewer out. I know you can do all sorts of tricks with computer generated graphics, but does that mean you should use them just because you can? If, for example, you graphically show someone's being eaten alive by pigs, as Hannibal does, it produces an instintive fear in most people, but, ultimately, too much of this stuff results in mere cheap thrills and brings down the level of the movie's quality.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DZKOOMMJM1MI.html">A1DZKOOMMJM1MI</a><br/><p>One word ran through my ...

I think this movie perfectly followed up the first story with the exception of the new Clarice. The story in this movie is extremely good. Hannibal's victim using Clarice to seek revenge on him. Clarice saving the man she fears only to be stuck at a dinner table and watching Hannibal feed a man his own brain? That scene was very sickening and hard to watch but I just couldn't tear my eyes away. The only let down is that this movie doesn't let you get to know Hannibal more. I'd like to know the first time he ate somebody. Maybe there will be a third one but I doubt it.</p></br><a href="../users/A15YPJLKLZS0MK.html">A15YPJLKLZS0MK</a><br/><p>This stars Anthony Hopkins who reprises his role as Hannibal lector. He comes out of hiding to draw an FBI agent into battle. A decent sequel which features a grisly ending, worth a rent or two.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>Hannibal starring Anthony Hopkins and Julianne Moore is a disgusting sequel to The Silence of the Lambs. Jodie Foster refused to reprise her role as Clarice Starling, she sure made the right decision! Moore is awkward as Starling, she has a hard time tackling the accent. Hopkins is still creepy but that scene with the pigs is so vile, I covered my eyes, ugh! Horrible movie, Red Dragon is better than this.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AKPY4LXIC24O.html">A3AKPY4LXIC24O</a><br/><p>After the initial acclimatization to Julianne Moore as Clarice Starling I became absorbed with how well the screen writers adapted the novel to film.  Besides, everyone was there for the title character anyway and this time there's definitely more for Lecter to chew on.<br /><br />Another plus was the haunting performance given by Gary Oldman.  I can't help but think that this film would have been award bound if Foster had agreed to reprise her role as Starling.  While Moore did an admirable job different people playing the same role only works on stage.  Ridley Scott's direction is, as always, astounding(I'm still irked by his inexcusable loss to Soderbergh in 2000).<br /><br />Hannial is even better the second time around as you are less shocked and more capable of noticing the nuances each actor brings to their roles.  I still don't understand how Anthony Hopkins didn't at least get another Oscar nod.<br /><br />If you saw The Silence of the Lambs you should at least rent Hannibal, if only to see Hopkins as the good doctor.  Also, for you sickos out there Hannibal has one of the most disturbing endings ever in a widely released theatrical film.<br /><br />Bon Appetit!</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDZNPO7U4E6N.html">A1CDZNPO7U4E6N</a><br/><p>&quot;Hannibal&quot; was a pretty O.K movie except for the fact that Jodie Foster wasn't in it. As a southern woman, I must say that Julianne Moore had one of the worst southern accents I have ever heard before, and she didn't bring any justice to Clarice Starling. However, I did love the story, and I thought it was a good thriller. It wasn't necessarily what I thought it was going to be. When you say a name like Hannibal Lector you think of cannibal, but in my opinion he hardly did any killing, and those he did kill weren't killed in the fashion that I thought Hannibal Lector had become accustomed to. &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; was a classic, but I guess you could say that &quot;Hannibal&quot; was a fairly good movie, certainly not one of the best though.</p></br><a href="../users/A91LE0MPYE8GJ.html">A91LE0MPYE8GJ</a><br/><p>This was a good, movie when I saw the previews to this I wanted to see it.

This movie drives you through a master piece of suspense and thriller.<p>The make up was brillaint and thrilling for the &quot;deformed man&quot;! Anthony Hopkins played his role well but the big credit I give to Ridley Scott!<p>The two things that got me not to rate it 5 stars was:<p>1. The story did not cover how did Dr. Lecter manage to do everything (job, escape, travel ..etc.) without any assistance!<p>2. The scene at the dining table at the end of the film was a bit over exaggerated!<p>Other than that, it was a movie not to be missed!</p></br><a href="../users/A2OXDJP1Z3LNOK.html">A2OXDJP1Z3LNOK</a><br/><p>The pyschological edge of Hannibal Lecter has all but disappeared in this sequel.  What once was a character that was almost purely a mental figure has now been transformed into an escape artist with almost super-human ability.  That being said, this movie is not bad - but it really has lost it's edge.<p>Julianne Moore is not Jodie Foster - but she does a good job in my opinion.  Foster was a very tough act to follow.<p>I would still recommend this movie - but it is no blockbuster.</p></br><a href="../users/AUM3YMZ0YRJE0.html">AUM3YMZ0YRJE0</a><br/><p>While the first two parts of this trilogy easily allowed me to suspend my disbelief and enter the most bizarre mind imaginable, this last one is so graphic and unsubtle that I kept saying to myself, "oh c'mon."  It seemed to me that this film did not have anything to add - afterall, how can you surpass "Silence"? - so it just got more graphically grotesque, in particular the final cooking scene.  Then Lector is so brazen and nonchalant, toying with those who are pursuing him and barely escaping, that it is unconvincing.<br /><br />Clarice develops, as she is older and disillusioned.  Moore is a truly wonderful actress, so empathetic and believable.  It really is a pity that the script is so weak, as this could have been a great film based more on her - and the way her career is messed up - than Hopkins cunning and skill at killing (and eating).  The addition of Oldman does not fail completely, but his personality is somewhat undeveloped, though the way he lures Lector to him is quite subtle.<br /><br />So this film has its good moments, just not nearly as good as it could have been with a better script.<br /><br />Recommended with these caveats in mind, but only fans of Lector will want to own this.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZS82R4RC0I2N.html">A1ZS82R4RC0I2N</a><br/><p>This is an uneven movie. It almost works. The atmosphere and music are intriguing and adequate, some moments are visually stunning and a few thrills truly engage and surprise. However, the rythm of the narrative is too slow and the plot is basically just another cat-and-mouse game with an anticlimatic ending that`s way too out there and doesn`t connect with the rest of the movie. Anthony Hopkins is again a convincing Hannibal Lecter but Julliane Moore plays an uninteresting, bland Clarice Starling that shows little sparkle. There are some genuine moments of tension and suspense to find here, though as a whole it`s too flawed and not very captivating. The baroque feel is an edgy and well-accomplished idea, creating some tension, darkness and weirdness that unfortunately don`t work very well in the end. This movie wants to be a rich banquet, yet ultimately is just another happy meal. Tasty enough, but leaves you wantig more.</p></br><a href="../users/A23QOAXJSWIBS6.html">A23QOAXJSWIBS6</a><br/><p>I was disappointed in this film, though it is not entirely  awful.  It misses the uniquely gripping feel of &quot;Lambs&quot; and devolves into scenes of fright and terror meant to shock and revulse in the worst, gratutious way.  Hopkins' performance seems thinner in some spots but almost a caricature of his Oscar-winning performance in others.  Moore holds her own, but I think the film suffers from the producers' presupposition that no matter what they put on screen would benefit from the critical and popular acclaim afforded the first film.  It doesn't happen here.  This film is clearly &quot;off-note.&quot;  I didn't find myself caring more for any of the characters in this chapter.  I couldn't wait until it was over.  Not one I am likely to watch again.</p></br><a href="../users/A27QZDO1FRRFCV.html">A27QZDO1FRRFCV</a><br/><p>I exsepted this to be simailer to Silence of the Lambs Jump right to the point!, This doesnt yes it has a lot of talking in it,, IN my opion this could go on the list of the worst sequals.  It just has Starling looking again for Dr.Lecter, after 10 years she recives a letter from him!!!<br /> Why Jodi Foster! why!!! Dont get me 1 this Clarise does good but she looks younger,,  I mean this is like 10 years later.<p> Despite what many probly think I think this should be the final moive going foward in time,, I mean I think haveing Lecter thrown back in jail would be to orgianal ending after all Lecter is a very smart guy in deed.<br />  Note to the productes: If you ever consider makeing a IV one DONT go ahead go back explane more about Dr.Lecter's past before he was thrown in jail!</p></br><a href="../users/A29IYGR7SNPRIV.html">A29IYGR7SNPRIV</a><br/><p>The only good thing about this film is Julianne Moore who always, always, gives everything she's got to any film in which she appears. She does a creditable follow-up as the alienated Clarice Starling in what is otherwise a deeply stupid film.<p>The screenplay gives only the merest nod to Thomas Harris's signal achievement in actually humanizing Hannibal in the book; in the film, Hopkins gives the same ridiculous, over-the-top performance he offered in Silence of the Lambs. Why he possesses an Academy Award for it will be forever beyond my comprehending. (If you want to see a truly alarming, deeply inhabited Hannibal, check out Manhunter--Michael Mann's ill-advisedly renamed Red Dragon--and see British actor Brian Cox do in only a few minutes what Hopkins cannot do in two full-length films: impart the true horror of evil personified, without bells and whistle but just sheer acting ability.)<p>For all the moody, European effect, this movie just doesn't happen. It comes alive when Moore is the focus. When it's Hopkins, it's all just gore, more gore and still more gore--pointlessly. Unlike the book, where the reasons are clear, in the film Hannibal is just a killing machine. Liotta also gives an over-the-top performance that lacks any hint of subtlety. The audience doesn't even get to enjoy the final scene as written by Harris; it's turned into an additional bit of meritless gore.<p>Don't bother with this one. Get Manhunter instead--which is truly the best film of a Harris book.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6X0DAM87GN4.html">A3C6X0DAM87GN4</a><br/><p>I know by making that statement many people will automatically disagree with me. But, I can't help it, it's what I honestly feel. &quot;Silence Of The Lambs&quot; was indeed a good movie. One though, I must admit, I felt was given a little too much credit then it deserved. For instance, if I were to write a review for it, I would probably give the movie 3 stars. But, the trouble I had with &quot;Lambs&quot; was that it didn't completely carry me. I wasn't totally involved. &quot;Hannibal&quot; on the other hand I find to be a very gripping, intense, and entertaining movie. The only reason one might dislike this film is because it's a sequel. I too personally dislike many sequels, expect for the ones we all love, &quot;The Godfather part 2&quot;, &quot;Empire Strikes Back&quot;....ect. But there's something about this film that just had that certain something where I couldn't take my eyes off it. Ridley Scott, who is just coming off his &quot;Gladiator&quot; success, has made yet another wonderful film. I think everyone knows what this movie is about. Either they saw it already in theathers, or where told by friends. So, I won't go into detail about this film. I will only mention the strong points of the film. Lets start out with the acting. Anthony Hopkins is wonderful once again as Hannibal Lecter. There is a change in the character now. That change is for the better I feel. Lecter seems, and excuse me for the use of this word, more cool. He has more of a suave input on things now. And I personally like him this way. As for Julianne Moore, well. she's just great! We don't miss Foster at all in this movie. Moore delivers an excellent performance. I only wish her and Hopkins had more scenes together. But the ones they do have, hit the jackpot. They both seemed to play off each other very well in this movie. I was really surpised to see Giancarlo Giannini (Whom I personally rememeber seeing in Visconti's &quot;The Innocent&quot;). He doesn't really have what I would dare call a strong character in the film. I mean, no one I know is going to see this movie for him. The one person who is amazing in this movie goes unbilled. He plays Mason Verger (I'm still debating if I should reveal in or not, oh, why not, everyone's seen the movie already) Gary Oldman is a real highpoint in this film. I couldn't even recongize him in this film. The next thing to talk about is the screenplay. I love David Mamet's writting style. I hope there are others out there who enjoy his work as much as I do. Ridley Scott, in my opinion does a wonderful job setting up things. He's a director whom I'm really taken notice to lately. Well, there you have it. Those are my reason to go see this movie. And, I know it's kinda early on in the year to say this, but, this movie could be one of the best films of the year!</p></br><a href="../users/A3OMPSEVL59ZDK.html">A3OMPSEVL59ZDK</a><br/><p>Ok, the film wasn't that bad. Gary Oldman was brilliant as Mason Verger and the make up was both gross and spectacular. The film's cinematography, well it seems that Ridley Scott is still &quot;Fast/Dizzy&quot; camera effect happy since Gladiator. Anthony Hopkins loses some charm now that he's free from his jail cell, its just sorta weird I dunno. Juliann Moore did the best she could with a character who's integrity and dignity are stripped in every part of the movie, its not her fault her character is a complete Dunce who is nothing but the puppet of Mr. Lecture. The one thing that took away ALOT of stars for me. was the STUPIDEST ENDING EVER since The Blair Witch Project. Boy was that a stinker, the book ending was WAY WAY WAY better then this crap. I was totally dissapointed by it, and I can in no way forgive such a result for the characters. Had it been better, the movie would have gotten a better review from me. Yes at times it's entertaining, and contains loads of black comedy, with Mr. Lecture acting so cool and childlike just before he rips someones intestines out. Its not that gross, but beware the shock end scene for those who are squemish. It could have been better, once again Clerice Sterling loses everything you love about her from the first film, she's taken from strong and confident to nothing but the play thing of a whole buncha men who have it out for her.</p></br><a href="../users/A34W7QA4J5UTOR.html">A34W7QA4J5UTOR</a><br/><p>I enjoyed the movie. I had to look away from the screen about three times due to gore. The gore is to be expected. It is a movie about a cannibal. Anthony Hopkins is good as "Hannibal" again. This time we get more insight into what type of man he is. This movie is both thrilling and amusing. <p>My only worry is that some could see this movie as the glorification of a serial killer. It isn't blatantly said that what "Hannibal" is doing is right in the movie but all the indicators are there. "Hannibal" attacks only people he considers sinners. The majority of these people aren't shown in a favorable light for the viewer. He saves "...." And the ending shows him in a favorable light. He's actually this movie's hero! <p>That said, I still want to see this movie again. It's morbidly fascinating.  I keep recalling all these scenes I would like to see again.  The more I think about it and the more I see the commercials for it, the more I realize how much I liked this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NSUJJCG73IRF.html">A1NSUJJCG73IRF</a><br/><p>Director:  Ridley Scott<br /><br />Cast:  Anthony Hopkins, Julianne Moore, Giancarlo Giannini, Gary Oldman, Ray Liotta, Frankie Faison, Francesca Neri, Zeljko Ivanek, Hazelle Goodman.<br /><br />Running Time:  131 minutes<br /><br />Rated R for strong gruesome violence, some nudity and language.<br /><br />When "Hannibal" was in the process of being made, it seemed like it was going to be a thrilling exciting follow up to the Oscar-winning, highly acclaimed "The Silence of the Lambs".  Hopkins was back as Lector, Ray Liotta was to play the obnoxious Paul Krendler, Gary Oldman was the severely distorted and disabled Mason Verger and the film was being directed by the recent Oscar-winning director Ridley Scott (for "Gladiator"). Although Foster turned down the role of Clarice again, it went to Julianne Moore which seemed an astute move by the film crew.  Unfortunately, "Hannibal" turns into a campy shockfest more concerned with orchestrating gory death scenes than actually creating a tense, atmospheric adaptation of Thomas Harris's critically supportive third installment of the Hannibal Lecter novel series.<br /><br />Clarice Starling (Julianne Moore) is now famous for her work with Hannibal "the Cannibal" Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), the notorious killer who has since escaped to Venice. After a bloody drug bust resulted in a mother being shot while holding her child, Starling is tormented by her co-workers and various other people. Meanwhile, Mason Verger (Gary Oldman) is hunting down Lecter in hopes for revenge. Verger is the only victim to have encountered Hannibal and survive, but he's horribly disfigured from the experience and has become obsessed with Lecter. While all of this is happening, Lecter is living the good life in Venice, becoming a very respectable yet creepy fellow. Things become complicated though when Inspector Pazzi (Giancarlo Giannini) finds out who he really is. Verger tells Starling that he may know where the great cannibal is and this sets things into motion. Now with co-worker Paul Krendler (Ray Liotta) breathing down her neck, Clarice revisits her experiences with Hannibal and starts to contact Pazzi. Unknown to her, Verger has paid Pazzi a hefty sum of money in order to catch Lecter alive. After the failed attempt resulted in a gory manner, Lecter comes back to America to visit Clarice and break the silence.  Julianne Moore made little impression with her portrayal of Starling though that`s through little fault of her own because it`s always the most difficult job of an actor playing a role made famous by someone else , and Starling is sidelined in much of the film . As for the other actors, Hopkins is competent but by no means spell binding , Liota gives the impression that a robot played his role throughout the film, Giancarlo Giannini is good, but Gary Oldman absolutely steals the show as Mason Verger playing the role just the right side of camp complete with some great make-up .<br /><br />As for the other aspects of "Hannibal", Ridley Scott directs with an almost operatic touch.  You really do get the feeling watching this that Scott`s ambition in life is to do a remake of "Amadeus" with Hopkins in the role of Atonio Salieri; however, the one major flaw with "Hannibal" is the script by Mamet and Zaillian, only moderately staying true to the book and deviating from the original components that made "Silence of the Lambs" so efficient and engrossing, especially with the ending which is riducously over the top .  Despite Scott's ability to make a visually stunning and intriguing film, we are still left with a lack of narrative thrust, so that while individual scenes, particularly those depicting Lecter at large in a gothically-rendered Florence of shadows and fog, have a certain fascination, they don't really join up to make a satisfying whole. Besides which, Anthony Hopkins does not seem to have re-discovered the inimitable creepiness as Lecter that he nailed in "Lambs". It seems that uncaged, Lecter lacks the coiled menace of his earlier incarnation, and Hopkins seems to have merely turned up to collect his paycheck this time round. Possibly the biggest problem with "Hannibal", however, is the absence of Jodie Foster. Into her shoes steps Julianne Moore, a fine actress in her own right, but a calm, almost ethereal presence where Foster was pugnacious, edgy and brittle. Foster defined the role, and Moore has a thankless task made all the more difficult by a script that gives her little to do but react to the machinations of the corrupt men that surround her.  A major letdown from a big-time director and a usually solid group of cast members.</p></br><a href="../users/A7Y6AVS576M03.html">A7Y6AVS576M03</a><br/><p>This is a very good sequel with a totally different approach from the original. I think this was actually a great character study. Some scenes that reviewers thought were gratuitous are really sorties into the real world. Symbolically you let the demons come to fruition by having them come to the surface. This is not nearly as grotesque as the media hype suggested. That is a shame because it kept many people away from the box-office. This film reminds me of the reactions at the time THE FRENCH CONNECTION II was released. THE FRENCH CONNECTION II was a totally different approach to the character from that in THE FRENCH CONNECTION. Jimmy 'Popeye' Doyle was literally out of his element and out of his country in THE FRENCH CONNECTION II. Many people expected something different just as they did here with HANNIBAL. The DVD extras are interesting to see what was left out. However why are some things left in and others left out? I think only the company that releases the film can answer that.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>**1/2 Journey with us back into the dankest recesses of the human psyche in Ridley Scott&#8217;s &#8220;Hannibal,&#8221; the long awaited sequel to &#8220;The Silence of the Lambs,&#8221; one of the darkest films ever to be awarded a Best Picture nod by the Motion Picture Academy of Arts and Sciences.  In pop culture terms, Hannibal Lector has, of course, become the modern incarnation of implacable evil.  Not only do his cannibalistic acts represent the ultimate in human moral debasement and degradation, but his seeming indestructibility makes him all that much more horrifying.  His escape at the end of the first film served as a perfect setup for this sequel, as we find Lector living a life of seeming &#8220;normalcy&#8221; in Florence, Italy, just waiting for the proper moment to come out of &#8220;retirement.&#8221;  That moment arrives when Clarice Starling, the FBI agent who helped to save Hannibal&#8217;s last victim, is suddenly in the news again after an abortive and disastrous attempt to arrest a major criminal ends in the death of a number of her fellow officers.  Lector begins communicating with Clarice again, vowing to restart the game of intellectual cat-and-mouse he so enjoyed in the previous film.<p>For most of its running time, &#8220;Hannibal&#8221; is a pretty enticing thriller.  Anthony Hopkins repeats the brilliant work he did in &#8220;Lambs,&#8221; making this most evil of movie villains both chillingly unreachable and bizarrely compelling.  With his clipped diction and often-incisive glimpses into the dark truths of the human psyche, he keeps the audience as emotionally off-balance as he does Clarice herself.  Indeed, we understand why she is both repelled and strangely attracted to this man.  Julianne Moore, who replaces Jody Foster in the role she originated ten years ago, brings an impressive reticence and hesitancy to this woman caught between her moral dictates and her desire to know more about the evil she is confronting.  In fact, apart from this explanation, many of her actions later in the film would be inexplicable unless we were to consider her utterly incompetent at her job.  My suspicion is that the filmmakers have something deeper in mind.  In addition, writers David Mamet and Steven Zaillan have created an interesting subplot involving Giancarlo Giannini as an Italian detective who uncovers Hannibal&#8217;s identity and thinks he can outsmart the devilish mastermind, capture him, turn him over to the authorities and make a fortune by collecting the reward money.  Giannini perfectly captures the subtle nuances that define this extraordinarily complex character, a man made up of many different, even conflicting moods and motives.<p>So far, so good.  But then - inevitably perhaps with material of this nature - the filmmakers cannot resist going overboard into downright incredibility and gruesomeness as the film approaches its denouement.  Even those familiar beforehand with the tenor of this story may well be appalled by some of the turns the film takes in its latter stages.  In the past, one used to encounter scenes like these only in low budget exploitation films like &#8220;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.&#8221;  Now they are being fed &#8211; pardon the pun &#8211; to mass audiences in the guise of slickly marketed &#8220;entertainment.&#8221;  Poor Ray Liotta &#8211; I will never be able to look at him from here on out without seeing him in the condition he ultimately ends up in at the close of this film.  It is an image too indelible to ever be completely forgotten and goes well beyond the pale even for a film on this nasty a subject area. Moreover, whereas the first film ended on a note of clever, albeit macabre black humor, &#8220;Hannibal&#8221; closes with a scene that is simply sickening in its unbridled grotesquerie.  <p>Of course, complaining about the level of gruesomeness in a film about a serial cannibal may smack one as a bit of a Pollyanish stance for a knowledgeable viewer to take.  Still, the first two-thirds of the film, in which the writers and director exercise an admirable amount of restraint, prove that this material can be even more effective when it is dealt with through indirection than when it is all laid out for us in such grisly, graphic detail.  There is much to recommend &#8220;Hannibal,&#8221; but unless you have a cast iron stomach and a very short memory span, you may well want to skip out before the final curtain is finally wrung down on the scene.  That is if you ever want to eat again.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>We have gotten to the point with DVDs where we really need to be able to rating both the film AND the packaging (similar to what we get to do with the THREE rating categories for toys), because whatever you might think about &quot;Hannibal&quot; as a film this is an excellent 2-disc DVD package.  Director Ridley Scott's commentary is first rate, although there are more lengthy pauses in the last act of the film (and I cannot get the subtitles to work during the commentary, which is how I prefer to do it).  The best of the extras is probably the bit on the Fish Market shootout that allows you to look simultaneously at the multi-camera angles used to film the scenes.  The &quot;making of&quot; featurette is okay, the cast bios above average, and the dozens of discarded examples of posters for the film are fascinating.  <p>I think we are all pretty much in agreement that the shortcomings with the film version of &quot;Hannibal&quot; are inherent in Thomas Harris's novel.  The main problem is that when Hannibal is &quot;out&quot; he is simply not as powerful a figure.  The potency of the character in &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; is that even when he was thrown in a dungeon cell or masked and harnessed to a dolly he was still in psychological control of the situation.  The idea of Hannibal getting Meigs to swallow his tongue was more horrific than what happened to Pazzi or Krendler in this film.  I am sure the ending of the film has to be more satisfying to fans than that of the novel, although I do want to point out that in the book Lecter used drugs and psychological conditioning to reprogram Clarice into not his lover but rather his consort, which is closer to Frankenstein than Pygmalion. <p>Watching &quot;Hannibal&quot; on DVD confirmed the two strengths I found in the film when I first saw it in the theater.  First, screenwriters David Mamet and Steven Zaillian did a marvelous job of concocting scenes between Hannibal and Clarice.  In the novel the two are never together until the very end, while in the screenplay we have Clarice listening to tapes of their previous conversations and talking on the telephone in a couple of interesting situations.  Without these creative additions &quot;Hannibal&quot; becomes just like &quot;Sleepless in Seattle.&quot;  Second, the best performance in the film is turned in by Julianne Moore.  We have no trouble believing this is Clarice Starling ten years down the road.  Of course this is particularly impressive since the actress is following in the footsteps of Jodie Foster's Oscar winning performance.  I even think you can clearly see echoes of Foster's original characterization in Moore's work.  As for Anthony Hopkins, he is certainly presenting a different, more mellow side to Hannibal, which I suppose is justified by the intervening years.  Still, as the ending amply proves, this is not the same old Hannibal Lecter.  <p>Anyhow, whether you have already seen &quot;Hannibal&quot; or not, as long as you have seen &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; you should check out the DVD version and make up your mind about all these nonsense.  You have to admit the author and the film give you plenty to think about.</p></br><a href="../users/A17FLA8HQOFVIG.html">A17FLA8HQOFVIG</a><br/><p>In this sequel to &quot;The Silence of the Lambs,&quot; Anthony Hopkins is still Hannibal Lecter.  He has escaped and is living in a dark and decadent Italy.  People use cell phones and computers but the theme is the same.  Only now there are many more murders, each competing with each other for grossness.  Hopkins' performance is good, but this is not a surprise.  He has been so typecast as a villain that it doesn't seem like he's acting.<p>Julianne Moore plays Clarice Starling.  Alas, she is no actress.  Her performance is wooden.  But then again the writing didn't create much sympathy for her character.  Ray Liotta is also in this film, over-playing his role as a manipulative FBI chief.  Ridley Scott did a good job of directing.  There was constant action and the scenes all contained the shock value which was intended.  Good cinematography too.<p>All that said, my feelings about this movie can be summed up in one word:  &quot;YUCK&quot;.  It was mildly interesting to me just to see how far a film can go to shock audiences.  I sure couldn't fall asleep in this one.  But unless you, like me, are just curious, I'd recommend you avoid this one.</p></br><a href="../users/A2Z5WEA0KOMN9G.html">A2Z5WEA0KOMN9G</a><br/><p>After seeing Gladiator, I thought it was cool that someone was going to do another Roman movie.  The Punnic Wars being one of the key battles for supremacy of the Mediterranean.  Rome had one city standing in the way of its domination and that city was Carthage.  There were three battles.  One of the battles involved a Carthaginian general named Hannibal.<br />This movie had me a bit confused as I was waiting for the climatic scene with the elephants crossing the Alps.  Especially since parts of it were shot in Rome.  Nor did I see any Centurions for that matter.<br />Anyways, I didn't really care for this movie.  It didn't seem like it had a plot other than trying to gross the heck out of the audience.  Whatever.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GCHG6U8HTVIT.html">A2GCHG6U8HTVIT</a><br/><p>Silence of the Lambs was an exceptionally good movie...scary, funny, original, characters to care about, even touching. What a letdown with Hannibal. What a mess. The movie was all over the place, with calculated yuck moments for the fanciers of evisceration, hogs and chafing dishes. There was no chemistry between Clarice and Hannibal, no tension or anticipation, no wit, no characters worth anyone's interest (all just my opinion, of course). I remember reading Hopkins' answer when asked why he took the role. "Why not," he said, "After all, it's just a movie." That's the kind of condescension this movie earns.<br /><br />It seems such a classic example of Hollywood's calculated commercialism, where the grossness keeps the target audience happy and the grosses keep the producers happy.<br /><br />But the waste. Ridley Scott is the guy who did Blade Runner and Thelma and Louise. Julianne Moore is a top-of-the-line actress (Vanya on 42nd Street, The Big Lebowski). And Ray Liotta, so good in Goodfellas. David Mamet must have breathed a sigh of relief when they pitched his script and reassigned it to another writer. It would be easy to believe that Gary Oldman didn't want an acting credit.<br /><br />So much talent. So little good product. The money must have been persuasive.</p></br><a href="../users/AXFI7TAWD6H6X.html">AXFI7TAWD6H6X</a><br/><p>I loved &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;, the one of the handful of movies that scares the living daylights out of me. I read the book while the film version was still in its early stages. I was totally grossed out by what I read and I don't say that about just any book. The film version gave me the chills, not to mention repulsed me on the same level the novel did. I loved &quot;Hannibal&quot;. Granted that I would have loved to have seen Jodie Foster reprise her classic film role, Julianne Moore gave a stellar performance as Clarice Sterling. I thought she was perfect for Jodie's replacement. &quot;Hannibal&quot; may not be nearly as perfect as &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; in terms of quality, I still found it thoroughly engaging and entertaining. Ray Liotta's performance as that jerk Paul Krendler was just perfect. His character was a jerk in the book and a bigger jerk in the movie. Anthony Hopkins was and is Hannibal Lechter. He was still riveting and compelling to watch as he was in &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;. Gary Oldman as Mason Verger was priceless. He really gave me the creeps in the movie as the vengeful victim of Hannibal Lechter. For the most part, the movie stays faithful to the novel however for anyone who read the book before seeing the movie, you see the holes in the movie. Still it is rather difficult to make a film adaptation of a novel and keep it within a 2 hour limit. Despite the critics' desparaging reviews about the movie, I loved it and thought it was a worthy follow-up to a classic thriller.</p></br><a href="../users/A27PSZX2SE0B51.html">A27PSZX2SE0B51</a><br/><p>[*An image from the film that I think would make a better title than plain old "Hannibal".]<p>&quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; worked on every level it aimed for.  It was a perfect suspense-thriller, horror flick, character study, mood piece, and most effectively, psychological drama.  &quot;Hannibal&quot; doesn't bother to try its hand at all of these, and who's to blame it for that?  The ones it does try for (thriller, horror flick, mood piece) are pulled off with aplomb.  It's full of blood and gore, all in the name of some serious campy fun (&quot;fun&quot; being the key word here).  And on top of that it manages to be a pretty gripping love story, too.  Well... within the context of the serial killer genre, that is.<p>&quot;Hannibal&quot; doesn't shy away from references to its frequently decorated parent.  We are played tapes of past Lecter/Starling interviews, are reunited with Barney the nurse, and are shown that Hannibal still fits into that gruesome green mask.  Knowledge of &quot;Silence&quot;, then, is mandatory.  But &quot;Hannibal&quot; is a different animal, so to speak.  It doesn't take itself so seriously.  For example, any suggestion of the sexism that Clarice must overcome in the FBI is over-the-top and cartoonish.  And, like &quot;Silence&quot;, it revels in its showstopper set pieces.  But where in &quot;Silence&quot; we weren't shown the violence and the gore, &quot;Hannibal&quot; leaves no stone unturned.  Witness the splattering on the pavement after Lecter disembowels then hangs a pursuer, or the finale featuring Ray Liotta (if you haven't yet been tipped off about this scene, you soon will) that leaves little for the mind's eye to fill in.  Whereas some have found these scenes distasteful and unnecessary, I beg to differ.  They serve two purposes: a distancing from the style of &quot;Silence, and a celebration of the campy fun that dominates the film's tone.<p>That's not to say that everything in the film is over the top and outrageous.  There are several scenes in which information is conveyed with shrewd restraint.  I'm thinking mainly of a quick scene that reveals what happened to Lecter's predecessor at a University library, and the chilling epilogue that resolves any unanswered questions left after the denouement (I'm loathe to give too much away here; please discover these scenes for yourself).  Those in the audience expecting to have their hands held throughout the plot will miss much here, if they don't pay close attention.  Kudos to director Scott for trusting his audience's intellect.<p>Anthony Hopkins reprises his role as the good doctor, and does a superb job showing how the man has evolved over the last ten years.  He is still frightening as hell, but also more assured, jubilant, and especially playful.  Age has allowed Lecter to relax within his skin (would a &quot;Silence&quot;-era Hannibal have gotten away with giddily exclaiming &quot;Okey-Dokey&quot; when moving in for a kill?), while honing his ability to control his deviant instincts.  It has also made him restless, which sets the narrative moving. <p>Julianne Moore doesn't really get to do much here, except allude to and update the performance that Jodie Foster gave as Clarice Starling.  In that respect, she does a bang-up job, subtly recreating her erratic accent while giving her a touch of world-weariness.  But really, this is not her movie, and the underwritten part shows that.<p>The Lecter/Starling relationship, which did much to drive &quot;Silence&quot;, is somewhat of a disappointment.  Sure, an ocean separates the two for much of the film's first half, but much more could have been done to enhance the connection between the characters.  As it is, the audience is expected to do much of the work, by remembering what they had going in &quot;Silence&quot; and transplanting it into this film.  That's just lazy filmmaking.  Still, Hopkins has a familiar chemistry with Moore, as he had with Foster, so any blemish is easily forgotten.<p>The rest of the cast has very little to work with, mostly playing one-dimensional characters to various degrees of success.  Gary Oldman, under mounds of make-up, is at his scene-stealing best as the only victim of Dr. Lecter who survived.  Ray Liotta on the other hand, as Starling's sexist superior, is just too ridiculous.  He is a distraction from the campy fun.  The one standout in this one-dimensional dramatis personae is Giancarlo Giannini.  He plays Rinaldo Pazzi, an Italian police detective who unwittingly gets more mixed up in the Lecter affair than he originally intended.  Giannini infuses his Pazzi with dollops of sadness (witness his droopy eyes), bumbling cunning, and subtly concealed fright.<p>I have not read Thomas Harris' source novel, and don't intend to.  So I can't speak to how the film holds up in comparison.  I can say that in comparison with &quot;Silence&quot; it is not close in matching that film's classic status.  However, &quot;Hannibal&quot; is a fun, campy ride that left me with a feeling of adrenalized exhilaration on par with what I felt the first time that I saw &quot;Silence&quot;.</p></br><a href="../users/A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX.html">A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX</a><br/><p>I'm probably the only person who thought this was a dull, boring, pointless, and largely unsuccessful, movie. That's because a film that is merely a grossfest of bizarre atrocities, because it needs to surpass the level of weirdness of the original movie to lure people back, but which lacks any sensible plot to tie it all together, not to mention much else in the way of redeeming aesethetic or other qualities, such as scientific accuracy, is still a dull, boring, uninteresting movie.<p>I wanted to say something more on the medical info, some of which is wildly off-base. This will require my waxing a little technical, so I apologize for that in advance, but I feel obligated to point out that several things in this movie are total nonsense.<p>I'm not a medical doctor, but my masters and doctoral work was in neurobiology, and I do know something about that, and it's highly unlikely someone would cut off their face while on poppers, if that's what Lector gave the Gary Oldman character. There wouldn't be enough anesthesia.<p>Oddly enough, there is a way this could happen, but it's a very rare neurological condition. These people lack a certain type of pain nerves. Mothers with this condition have been known to go into labor without knowing it and had the babies fall out on the kitchen floor--not good.<p>These people are born missing one of the two main neural pain pathways, known as the paleospinal-thalamic tract, or spinal lemniscus for pain. The other pain pathway we have for pain is the neospinalthalamic tract, which is for so-called epicritic pain, which are basically sharp, pinprick-type sensations, as opposed to protopathic pain, which are more dull, aching, type of pain sensations. But if I'm remembering my neurology correctly, it's the former one that's involved in this condition. But nothing in the movie suggests a connection with this strange neurological condition.<p>Well, I didn't mean to get into the technical minutia on all this, but movie-makers have a certain obligation not to desseminate crapola. I also doubt that there has ever been a case like Hannibal the Cannibal. Obviously, he's a fiction or construct, perhaps a combination of several real-life people (such as the Harvard Law School Professor, Kingsley, was in the movie, Paper Chase), but I didn't even mind that too much. The movie revolves around Hannibal's bizarre psychology, which, although they never do explain it very well, is really the only interesting thing in the entire movie, and if they didn't have him, they wouldn't even have a movie at all.<p>Finally, the scene with the hog was lifted from a much earlier Thomas Harris book from about 15 or so years ago, called Red Dragon, which is about a different character than Hannibal Lector. But I didn't even mind that too much, as the hog was probably the best actor in the movie (and I usually like Anthony Hopkins).<p>There are other things I could criticize about this movie, but as this is already a pretty long review I'll leave it at that. You might think I'm one of those hypercritical, nitpicky reviewers who love to find fault with everything, but in fact I'm actually very easily entertained when it comes to movies, and usually I'm not very uncritical of them.<p>This movie completes the parallels between the Roman Coliseum gladiatorial games and Hollywood's film output. Next thing you know we'll be having our own version of the gladiatorial games with the same events the Romans had--gladiators hacking at each other, political and religious dissidents being eaten by lions, and naked boys having to chase and catch porcupines with their bare hands.<p>If you like pointless voyeuristic grossfests almost completely lacking in any other redeeming cinematic qualities, then this movie is for you.</p></br><a href="../users/A2WZ1B92F81LJJ.html">A2WZ1B92F81LJJ</a><br/><p>The moment he signed on to film Hannibal, Ridley Scott must have known he would be thrown out of the window and left to dangle like a Pazzi. It was utterly unavoidable that Hannibal would be held up against Jonathan Demme's rendition of Silence of the Lambs, and inevitable it would come off second best. Silence of the Lambs is not just any old potboiler, after all.<br /><br />So, instead of going head-to-head with Demme in the serial thriller stakes, Scott has done what any sensible director would do - made a different sort of film altogether. In some ways, he didn't have a choice - it's a different sort of book altogether. Inevitable though they may be, comparisons with Silence of the Lambs are pointless - you may as well compare Hannibal with The Remains of the Day - they both star Anthony Hopkins, after all.<br /><br />Where Demme concentrated on the suspense and narrative, Scott explores Harris' characterisation and the deeper thematic content of Harris' writing. The scenes in Florence especially, dealing with avarice and betrayal and Dante's inferno - all of which manifest themselves in poor Pazzi's undoing - are beautifully shot and constructed. This isn't to say the pulse doesn't quicken from time to time along the way, of course. But this time Hopkins tends to play it for laughs and not chills.<br /><br />The American half of the film is much less interesting, and departs more radically from Harris' novel. Sure, certain themes are reinforced - Starling repeatedly crosses bridges, (the Rubicon? the Styx?) and the steaming gates and "sulphurous" lakes of Mason Verger's estate are certainly equated with Dante's vision of hell from the earlier part of the film - but I think in this section Scott capitulates a little on his mission to avoid the cheap thriller, and inevitably it pales. Julianne Moore plays Clarice Starling in a far more one-dimensional fashion than Jodie Foster did, when, given Scott's ambition, you'd expect quite the reverse. The contrast between Moore's uneasy performance and Hopkins' assured one is marked. The old boy is clearly having a whale of a time.<br /><br />The ending, which departs completely from Harris' original, seems to me to sell out the film's artistic pretenses in favour of commercial appeal (by the way, the "alternate ending" isn't very alternative at all, and is even less like the novel). Granted, the novel's ending wasn't popular, but it was courageous. The film's conclusion is neither, and the cynic in me wonders whether Scott wasn't leaving the way open for a sequel. Not, I should think, that Harris will write one.<br /><br />So, no fifth star, but a fascinating movie - in parts - all the same.<br /><br />Olly Buxton</p></br><a href="../users/AP3B615GM191G.html">AP3B615GM191G</a><br/><p>"Silence of the Lambs", the movie from which "Hannibal" is spawned, was an exercise in  creepiness from beginning to end.  The scenes with Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins are almost alive with tension, while the overall plot is well-executed and creepy enough to make you legitimately "weird-ed out" on more than one occasion.  Sadly, this sequel fails to live up to any of those previous benchmarks.<br /><br />For a basic plot summary, "Hannibal" sees Clarice Starling (now played by Julianne Moore) as an under-appreciated F.B.I. agent.  Out of the blue, Starling is contacted by Mason Verger (Gary Oldman), an old victim of Dr. Lecter, who portends to have some new information regarding the whereabouts of Hannibal (Anthony Hopkins).<br /><br />Though difficult to pinpoint exactly what is wrong with what could have been a blockbuster sequel, I believe it is the combination of "little things" that really do this movie in.  For instance...<br /><br />-The tension in "Lambs" comes from the fact that one can never quite "figure out" Hannibal.  At times he seems like a civil genius, yet obviously he is also quite twisted psychologically.  This produces a sense of fear in the vein of "what will he do next".  This movie holds none of that intensity, with Hannibal being portrayed as an "old romantic" instead of a cutting-edge personality.<br /><br />-The lack of scenes involving both Hannibal & Clarice is also unforgivable.  That is where the first movie really succeeds, and here it comes both late and not enough.<br /><br />-Maybe it is the writing, but Foster's Clarice was much more interesting than Moore's doppelganger.  Whereas Foster was vulnerable and conflicted, Moore is just "straight arrow" with no compromises or shades of grey.  Either character would work in the context of the films, but it is the sudden shift between them that makes Moore's performance just seem wrong.<br /><br />-Finally, the "Buffalo Bill" main plotline of "Lambs" far outshines anything this film has to offer.  The visuals of the faceless Verger are striking, for sure, but his character is terribly developed.  He is built up to be the "primary villain", but I found myself not caring about him whatsoever.<br /><br />In essence, "Hannibal" (while not utter, 1-star type trash) is a failure due to the fact that it changes the formula so much from its predecessor.  The tension is gone, the interesting characters are gone, and what remains is a lot of police procedure and talking.  A shame, considering the potential that was wasted.</p></br><a href="../users/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD.html">A3PPXVR5J6U2JD</a><br/><p>Taken chronologically, Hannibal Lecter started out as a brilliant schemer in Red Dragon, refined his - ahem - tastes in Silence of the Lambs, and if the last installment is any measure, became a traditional slasher in Hannibal.<br /><br />Hannibal (Anthony Hopkins) has always been the more gentlemanly of two evils.  Whether it was The Tooth Fairy in Red Dragon or Buffalo Bill in Silence of the Lambs, Lecter seemed pleasant and refined in comparison to the more brutal serial killers. This is what makes an anti-hero so much fun; he's bad, but he's not as bad as the bad guy.  The even-worse villain in Hannibal is Mason Verger (Gary Oldman), a wealthy child molester whom Hannibal convinced (through judicious application of mind-altering drugs) to cut off his own face.  A crippled, revolting shell of a man, Verger seethes with an unholy vengeance and, thanks to his immense wealth, crafts a far-fetched plan to get revenge.<br /><br />And this is where the problems with Hannibal begin. Although it's clear Verger was bad - and presumably, in the Levels of Evil, we can assume molestation of children is worse than cannibalism of adults - but he simply doesn't have the physical presence of the other serial killers to justify Hannibal's own villainy.  Verger is more disgusting than vile, and the shock of the character wears off after a while. Verger's schemes border on cartoon-character levels with his plans to have Hannibal's face eaten by specially bred wild boars.  Yes, that's right - Hannibal's up against a cripple and his army of killer pigs.<br /><br />The first third of the film is a cat-and-mouse game between Chief Inspector Rinaldo Pazzi (Giancarlo Giannini) and Hannibal in Florence, Italy.  This is the Hannibal we know - crawling inside his victim's heads, using their secret shame as a weapon against them, and giving morally flawed human beings their comeuppance for being so gauche. Pazzi's ending is never in doubt, but the increasingly high stakes between the two men makes for thrilling drama.<br /><br />Then we're back to Clarice Starling (Julianne Moore). You'll recall that Clarice was a woman trying to make it in a man's world in Silence of the Lambs.  Forget all that - here, Starling as embodied by Moore is a delicious peach, to be ogled by the camera as it slow pans not once but twice over her body.  Since Hannibal and Starling meet only at the end of the film, director Ridley Scott uses this technique as a substitute for Hannibal's amorous intentions. It's no surprise Foster turned the role down.<br /><br />The last third of Hannibal features Starling, the ridiculously corrupt Justice Department officer Paul Krendler (Ray Liotta, who looks the part), and everybody's favorite cannibal at a dinner for two.  The dinner scene only manages to be disgusting because there's not a shred of sympathy for Krendler, unlike Pazzi who had a gorgeous wife and so much to lose.  By the conclusion Hannibal is in full slasher mode, complete with the ability to silence dogs at a glance, terrorize gun-wielding victims into inaction with just a knife, and otherwise pop-up and disappear as needed for him to abduct his victims.  In short, Hannibal goes from being a three-dimensional character to a one-dimensional killer.<br /><br />Conversely, Starling is a straight arrow.  So straight, in fact, that it becomes inconceivable that there's any room for romance with Hannibal.  She is polite, but frigid - her lack of connection with any other character leaves her as a cipher with about as much charm as a wax statue.  The final showdown between Starling and Hannibal, which is considerably different from the book, detracts from all the romantic opera chatter that took place in the first third of the film.  Hannibal has difficulty staying true to its convictions.<br /><br />But if you know anything about the original source material, you can understand why.  Hannibal, the book, is a grand guignol of ridiculous characters and over-the-top violence.  Hannibal, the movie, is tame in comparison, but not daring enough to conclude the cannibal's movie legacy.</p></br><a href="../users/A1W702WG1LC6R3.html">A1W702WG1LC6R3</a><br/><p>Anthony Hopkins, Julianne Moore, Gary Oldman and Ray Liotta<br />star in Ridley Scott's 2001 thriller sequel.

I have not read the novels, so I can't compare them. The reviews I read (mostly from newspapers and Christian websites) said that this was a really gory movie, so I was expecting that. I was a trifle disappointed that there really wasn't very much blood (and that a pivotal flashback sequence was barely visible, though the audience gets the idea from the blurred images in the scene). That's my only complaint. Oh, yes...why were there scenes in the trailer that were deleted from the film? Really stupid practice, that is. Excellent movie. The film SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN RATED "R."

I see a writer as a God - he creates by the power of his imagination the new worlds and populates them with his creatures. Once, he created the world, he should give his characters free will; they should act by the logic of their personalities not by their creator's sheer caprice. What Harris did in "Hannibal" is unspeakable - he just showed his fans how much he despised them. Actually, he did two things wrong - the ending and his attempt to explain Hannibal, to look behind the mask. The film comparing to the book has several redeeming values: visually, it is a stunning work of a great director. I am yet to see Florence, the celebrated City of Flowers as dark, dangerous, and anti-tourist as in "Hannibal". Second, the movie did not try to "explain" Hannibal, to get inside his head and understand him. Harris attempted in the book to give us the reasons why Hannibal was what he was - it was weak and laughable. If he chose to present Hannibal as some sort of supernatural creature with almost animals' instincts, he should've left him as an eternal mystery. The best description of Hannibal belongs to Clarice. When asked, "Is it true what they're sayin', he's some kinda vampire?" - she replied, "They don't have a name for what he is". And finally, the film avoided the literally vomit-inducing, absurd, irrational, obnoxious slap in face book's ending - for this alone I think "Hannibal" is a very decent movie and a lot of fun.<br /><br />3.5/5</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>Most people hate this film; I love it....well, 95 percent of it, anyway.<br /><br />The shame of it is that most people only remember the last 10 minutes, a totally gruesome scene in which the top of a man's head is cut off and he's fed a morsel of his own brain. Of course, it's disgusting and I don't find it easy to watch, either.<br /><br />However, the first two hours of the film offers a feast, if you'll pardon the pun, for the eyes and ears that is not revolting except for one other three-second shot. This is one of the most beautifully-filmed movies I've ever seen and this DVD is fantastic.  Scene after scene is just jaw dropping and features some of the best shots, outside and inside, of Florence, Italy, you could ever imagine. Ridley Scott is known for his stylish direction and that is certainly the case here.<br /><br />The dialog is fascinating, led by Anthony Hopkins' famous "Hannibal Lecter" character, whose vocabulary and intelligent sarcasm and baiting are clever and entertaining to hear. Unlike "Silence Of the Lambs," there is little verbal crudeness in this film, very little profanity at all. On the third viewing, I played this with the English subtitles on, so I could catch all the dialog.<br /><br />Although Jodie Foster performed well in the role of FBI Agent Clarice Starling, I preferred watching and listening to Julianne Moore play the part in this film. A "sleeper" here, too, was the great performance by Giancarlo Gianni, as the greedy Italian lawman, who winds up paying a huge price for his avarice.<br /><br />Like "Godfather III," this is a very unjustly-criticized and overlooked third installment of a famous film trilogy.</p></br><a href="../users/A6ADO7B6FUVN.html">A6ADO7B6FUVN</a><br/><p>The escaped Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) once again contacts Agent Starling (Julianne Moore), who has come under public scrutiny after an FBI operation gone bad.  This opens up a new opportunity to catch Dr. Lecter for those who seek to catch him.  Hannibal is a suspenseful thriller with some gruesome scenes that will remind the audience of Hannibal's psychological state long after they have seen the film.  In addition, Hopkins offers a solid performance as Hannibal once again, but this sequel does not measure up with the original Silence of the Lambs.</p></br><a href="../users/A27NTH2Y9DAR31.html">A27NTH2Y9DAR31</a><br/><p>In this Hannibal series, this, IMHO, is far and away the best of the group. Stylish, atmospheric and beautifully photographed, directed and scored. The music, especially, is haunting and absolutely perfect; after all, this is Grand Guignol at it's finest hour, thanks to the Master, Ridley Scott. Even the gore is done in an operatic fashion, and when the Abattoir takes center stage (which is rather often), you are still hypnotized and mesmerised by the spectacle, the story and the images. Nothing is gratuitous; nothing is done for shock value, but rather, as an integral; part of the story. Sir Anthony Hopkins is Hannibal Lecter, and his speech, his subtle nuances, and his asides (one favorite is his exceeding delight in the moment just preceding the demise of someone who crossed his path and shouldn't have...alas, too late.) Lecter is such a fascinating character that even his worst moments are beautifully choreographed and served up as a new and tantalizing dish, exquisitely prepared for your pleasure alone. Irresistable...yet he is a fiend. What a gorgeous paradox! Ray Liotta is great, especially toward the end, and Julianne Moore (again, IMHO) makes a superior Starling. I do not like comparisons, but with Moore you get more into the character of Starling, and are not distracted by thinking it's Jodie Foster playing a part. Mason Verger, another remarkable character, who has excellent reasons of his own to capture Lecter, lives in isolation on his estate (the famous Biltmore House, built by George Vanderbilt, ((still privately owned and lived in, can you imagine living in such a place! by the great great grandson...))in Ashevillle, SC, and also used for &quot;Being There.&quot;) except for the beleagured doctor who he demeans at every opportunity, poor Caudell; and assorted faceless servants. When I read the book I was skeptical about displaying such a human ruin onscreen; but the effects are nothing less than remarkable...Verger portrayed by one of my favorite actors.<br />THIS is what moviemaking is all about; this should be used as a template in film schools/studies; it is flawless, not one moment of drag...but the character who made me saddest of all is the poor, fallen-from-grace Police Investigator, Giancarlo Gianinni; he evokes tremendous sympathy, even with a wife who is exquisite beyond words, and still has a good job, but falls prey to his own greed...perhaps for the benefit of his beautiful wife. The opera scene, the music, the streets, transports you away from wherever you are, which, of coure, should be the goal of all films, but in this case, it succeeds beyond any expectations. Magic. Only watch this on DVD! Nothing less will suffice or bring you the production as it is meant to be seen, in all it's glory...fantastic.</p></br></body></html>

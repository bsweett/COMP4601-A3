Robert De Niro is not among the most fluid of filmmakers, but his movie is consistently informative and interesting. The movie is surprisingly balanced, neither blindly apologetic of the CIA nor wildly condemnatory. De Niro even plays a small role, as a General based on Bill Donovan, the founder of the OSS (the characters in this movie are thinly veiled portraits of real people, but with different names). The protagonist in the movie is Edward Wilson, played by Matt Damon and clearly inspired by James Jesus Angleton (the counterintelligence chief at the CIA for many years). Though the fact that Angleton was half Mexican is omitted here, most of his professional life appears here: his early life as a student of poetry in Yale, his role in World War II as an intelligence officer, his relationship with Kim Philby (who goes here by the name of Arch Cummings, and is played, against type, by Billy Crudup), his role in the Golitsyn-Nosenko affair. He also appears as having a role in two operations he wasn't directly involved: the 1953 coup against Guatemalan president Jacobo Arbenz and the 1961 failed invasion of Bay of Pigs. One of the few flaws of the movie is its try at amateur psychology by having Wilson's motivations based on the suicide of his father (something which did not happen in Angleton case). But this is, overall, a fine movie, especially if you are interested in its subject matter.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ALOIPRR8Q06J.html">A1ALOIPRR8Q06J</a><br/><p>The main character is a tool and I don't like him and I don't like his terrible life but that's not why I didn't care too much for this film (of course). It's entirely possible to do a movie about an unlikable and even bland character that makes him interesting and sympathetic. In this character study the creation of an even mildly compelling character whose life we take any real interest in was simply not accomplished. This isn't to say Matt Damon did not act well because he seems to have turned in a decent, understated performace that was befitting of the role. The fact that this is a story about a strange man whose life is his work that is also the story of the birth of the CIA lumps it together with a whole slew of movies that affect for the worse my reaction to this espionage, cold war spy drama. Seems like it could have been a lot more engaging to me, and no I don't mean more action. THE GOOD SHEPHERD is an odd film.</p></br><a href="../users/A33TBHM3O9AY17.html">A33TBHM3O9AY17</a><br/><p>I had some mixed feelings about this one.  It was obviously intended as a "serious" movie, and certainly pulls that off credibly.  On the plus side was the all-star cast, including Matt Damon, Angelina Jolie, Robert DeNiro (who also produced the film), Alec Baldwin, and William Hurt, among others.  Even Joe Pesci makes an appearance toward the end.  However, Jolie's and DeNiro's roles were a bit marginalized for actors who are accustomed to being the star.  Also, Damon seemed (in my humble opinion) to be miscast for the role of Edward Wilson.  He simply looked too young to be believable as a middle-aged man with a twenty-something son, and the birth-control glasses and fedora weren't able to compensate adequately.<br /><br />As to the story itself, I saw it as tracing not only the birth of the CIA, but the dehumanization of Edward Wilson, which culminated in the closing scene with the revelation of his father's secret.  As a spy drama, it is predictably full of intrigue, deception and betrayal.  Wilson is told over and over by other spies that he can trust no one, yet ultimately it is a lesson he must learn through hard experience.  All the while, the viewer watches with a vague sympathy as Wilson's life slips further and further away, as he is dragged ever deeper into the dark web of Cold War espionage.  Yet he is a willing captive.<br /><br />Damon's role was at once central yet maddeningly flat, with relatively little dialogue and a lot of silent, intense staring.  The storyline bounced back and forth between the main tale of exposing a mole who leaked the plans for the Bay of Pigs operation, and tracing Wilson's biography as a college student turned OSS operative in WW2, and later CIA counterintelligence officer.  One must read the subtitles at the beginning of each scene to keep track of the chronology, but even with that aid it can be very difficult to track this subtle and often highly nuanced narrative.  An example is the meeting between Wilson and Modin regarding Edward Jr.'s fiance.  One must read carefully between the lines of their dialogue to appreciate the subsequent scenes involving the young lady's "mishap."<br /><br />In short, this movie is worth seeing once -- maybe twice if you really want to be able to understand better some of the more subtle plot twists.  However, I found it to be too long, a bit dry, and not especially entertaining.  I personally wouldn't waste the time on a second viewing.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JH5J1KQAUBMP.html">A1JH5J1KQAUBMP</a><br/><p>In director Robert DeNiro's ambitious film, the professional rise and spiritual fall of Edward Wilson (Matt Damon) through the ranks of the CIA reflects the evolution of that organization from its creation in the wake of WWII until the debacle at the Bay of Pigs.  The character of Wilson is much like the film itself: enigmatic, quiet, and tightly controlled.  Some may be put off by the long running time and the lack of big action scenes, but more patient viewers will be rewarded with a compelling presentation of the psychological damage caused when mistrust is the normal state of human interaction.  Wilson emerges as a tragic figure, having gone into government service with the best of intentions but, step by step, coming to the point where he becomes responsible for horrific acts.<br /><br />DeNiro does a fine job in his second film as a director.  He has assembled an excellent cast, including some outstanding cameos.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>It's amazing that this film is so highly regarded, especially since we have Matt Damon as the lead character. Damon isn't known for his exciting acting abilities (with the exception of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0788814664">Good Will Hunting</a> which I consider his quasi-breakout role). He's established himself as Jason Bourne in the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00023B1LC">The Bourne Identity</a> franchise, but that doesn't take much acting ability and is almost purely a physical job. His character in the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000062XHI">Ocean's Eleven</a> just seems to go through the motions. He's had limited success in films like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00001ZWUS">Saving Private Ryan</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M5AJQS">The Departed</a>. I say "limited" because it was the other characters and screenplay that brought him recognition more than his own abilities (try imagining Saving Private Ryan without Tom Hanks or The Departed without Leonardo DiCaprio and you'll see what I mean.) So I wasn't drawn to this flick simply because I knew Damon was our main man. But I was wonderfully surprised.<br /><br />Damon was the perfect choice for this role, and that isn't necessarily a compliment. His portrayal of Edward Wilson is flat, ineffectual, and unremarkable, just like the character was supposed to be. Just like many of Damon's previous portrayals. It is this absurd, unemotional character that drives the entire film, and thanks to director/actor Robert DeNiro's relentless pursuit of this movie (it was his pet project for over ten years) we have a gem.<br /><br />Beginning with Robert Kennedy's disastrous Bay of Pigs debacle, the film shows Ed Wilson (Damon) trying to overcome an American/Cuban historical event that many find shameful. The CIA had a leak somewhere that blew the entire assault, and Wilson has to find out who and how. It will take him back to the very beginnings of the CIA, pre-WWII, and then slowly catch up to the1960's.<br /><br />Battling the Cold War with a very worthy Russian opponent, Ed must come to grips with the death of his father (who was an OSS spy in WWI), the loveless relationship with his wife (played by Angelina Jolie), and what he's prepared to do for his son (Eddi Redmayne) when he learns of ignorant betrayal from within.<br /><br />The film really looks at the development of the CIA, how it came to be, what spying is REALLY like (not James Bond-ish), and one man's unwavering support for his country. Dark corners are everywhere, including Ed Wilson's own home. Life and business blur. Separating the man from the mission becomes impossible. A panoply of scenes greets each moment of Ed's life, from the shadowy corners of Post-WWII Berlin to the recesses of his home sanctuary. It's an incredible display with truly gripping photography and a frightening descent into the world of phantom spies.<br /><br />A powerhouse cast graces the screen, with fine performances from such greats as John Turturro (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GBK904">Thirteen Conversations About One Thing</a>), Joe Pesci and William Hurt (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F7CMRM">Syriana</a>).<br /><br />Surprisingly THE GOOD SHEPHERD has made it up to one of my all-time favorite spy films. But a warning call must be sound here. This isn't your typical spy flick. It won't be for everyone. But if you like to think about where the CIA came from and how espionage jobs really work, this one will be high on your list, too.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NH7PYU4AD5GA.html">A3NH7PYU4AD5GA</a><br/><p>An intelligent spy story, somewhere along the tradition of John le Carre and Graham Greene, but set in the US intelligence environment, i.e. of course CIA and predecessors. Time is between early 40s and early 60s, so we get the world war, the cold war, some Central American adventures, and the Bay of Pigs disaster as main historical material. Throw in some African scenery.<br />Unfortunately the build-up of the plot is very very slow. It takes very long until one can put the jig saw pieces in a framework that seems to make some sense. Also unfortunately, the considerable acting skills of Matt Damon are somewhat wasted on a character that is so low key that he hardly ever develops real contours, despite overlength. Maybe the only remarkable aspect of his character seems to be a fetish for women with hearing problems. His main love Laura is deaf, and his only other affair needs a hearing aid (his German secretary, played by Martina Gedeck). Also unfortunately, Angelina is largely underutilized as un-loved wife of the ever absent spy. (I do not think she handles her predicament badly though.) Possibly she hears too well for Mr.Wilson's taste.<br />De Niro directs, and adds himself as a physically handicapped intelligence general who looks remarkably like Kissinger (but calls himself a Catholic). There is also Joe Pesci as a strange Italian character whose only function seems to be to provide Damon with his best line in the movie. I can not quote what Pesci said to Damon, since it is racist and Amazon's censors don't let me quote that. Damon answers: we (i.e. the WASPs) own America, you other guys are just visiting.<br />All in all: no waste of time, but also not completely pleasing.</p></br><a href="../users/A22RY8N8CNDF3A.html">A22RY8N8CNDF3A</a><br/><p>"The Good Shepherd" seems to refer to the CIA, as a Christ-like agency that watches over his sheep.  Matt Damon plays a CIA agent, with flashbacks of his life.  Most of the action is set in the 1960's, however, the film hops back and forth in time.  The first flashback is his father's suicide and him hiding the suicide note, taking the blame for accidently killing his father.  He did not want his mother to know his father took his own life.  The movie meanders through his life and loves, with little emotional punch or interest.  After watching about thirty minutes, you realize it is not a thriller, or even very interesting.  The whole movie runs about three hours and is just boring, complicated and amazing that a man can go through life with his mouth shut, yet realizing you cannot "erase" mistakes, and mistakes can be big.  Top-rate actors like Damon, DeNiro, Jolie, and many others promise a epic film, but somehow there is no interesing hook.  The ending shows Matt reading his father's suicide note, as he kept and hid it for decades.  Even that ending was not satisfying.  The movie wants to relay a deep and important story, but it can't find the keynote to make this leap.</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>You have an all star cast and director, but not quite an all star movie.  This is an intelligent piece of work, very subtle and well acted, though the characters are very subdued.  The problem is the pacing for me.  At 2 hours and 40 minutes it seemed to drag for me.  This isn't a Bourne movie with lots of action.  Sure there is a kill here or there, but for the most part it is a character driven story.  I enjoyed the movie, but I didn't find it compelling enough that I would purchase it for future viewings.  I would say to rent this one first to make sure it is your type of movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NL1KW56O3JR8.html">A3NL1KW56O3JR8</a><br/><p>This is a hard movie to review. On the one hand, the portrayal of the genesis of the CIA was rather interesting but, on the other, the film as a whole drags and can be somewhat dull. Matt Damon is not one of my favorite actors but I think he did a good job in TGS. The irony is he's adopting the personality of someone who really has no personality. We never get inside the main character's head--which is kind of the point since I think you would have to be that way to be good at intelligence work.<br /><br />Angelina Jolie's character seemed rather pointless, however; her character seemed to detract more than she added to the story.<br /><br />The meta-story ties in with the fiasco at the Bay of Pigs and who leaked the info to the Russians. Eventually, the back-story and the "present" events merge but the resolution is somewhat unsatisfying. It seemed a little contrived to me.<br /><br />Overall, the movie is o.k; it has definite strengths as well as serious weaknesses. TGS has been described as "the Godfather of CIA movies." Godfather 3 maybe . . .</p></br><a href="../users/A1IOJE0W1NXOSE.html">A1IOJE0W1NXOSE</a><br/><p>Matt Damon plays Edward Wilson, a sensitive and intelligent poetry major at Yale.  Upon his graduation, he is invited to be one of the first agents in the fledgling CIA.  At this time he has a tender romance with a young, hearing-impaired woman, but a moment's dalliance with a friend's sister (played by Angelina Jolie) results in her pregnancy and their marriage.  Edward leaves her to go overseas to England and thus begins a distant and emotionless marriage and fatherhood.  As the years go by, Edward becomes totally remote and secretive, stung by the cruelty and treachery that he has witnessed.  The role of Edward Wilson is a difficult one to play and Matt Damon does a credible job with it.  There are problems with the script which mar the film, and the constant flashbacks are distracting and confusing.  The premise of the film is a very interesting one, the birth and development of the CIA as seen through the life of one of its early agents, but the movie is cold and emotionless like the lead character, and is told in a monotone.  The length of the film only adds to the deadening effect.  The movie makes a noble effort to tell a story, but it falls short of its potential.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>Given everything that the Good Shepherd has going for it on paper alone, saying the overall result is disappointing is saying it a bit lightly.  Robert De Niro's "pet project" and first directorial effort since A Bronx Tale, the Good Shepherd follows the life of the brilliant Edward Wilson (Matt Damon) and the beginnings and origins of the CIA.  Throughout the film, we witness the career triumps of Wilson as well as his personal failures that haunt him throughout the years.  The multi-layered, fact based script justifies the nearly three hour running time, but the overall effect of the Good Shepherd just doesn't perform nearly as well as it should.  Damon is wooden to say the least, while Angelina Jolie's talent is wasted as Wilson's long suffering wife.  There are notable supporting actors as well, including De Niro himself, Alec Baldwin, John Turturro, William Hurt, Timothy Hutton, Billy Crudup, Michael Gambon, 2001's Keir Dullea, and the great Joe Pesci (making his first screen appearance in almost a decade), but none of them are around long enough to make much impact.  Not to mention that the deliberately slow pacing of the film can really be difficult to sit through, and while the Good Shepherd isn't a bad film one bit, it is a disappointment nonetheless.  All in all, fans of fact based spy films or De Niro should definitely give the Good Shepherd a look, but be well forewarned before entering.</p></br><a href="../users/A2C5LA07JCDWTN.html">A2C5LA07JCDWTN</a><br/><p>The Good Shepherd is a fascinating look at how the counterintelligence unit of the CIA began. Matt Damon plays Edward Wilson, a priviledged Yale graduate and former Skull and Bones member who is recruited to help the United States stave off the growing threat of communism both to our East and later our South. The movie centers around the botched Bay of Pigs invasion and how and why our mission in Cuba failed. Much of the film is told through flashbacks as Wilson trys to determine how and why this mission has failed. The pacing of the film is slow, but the plot is layered, intricate and engrossing. Damon does an admirable job as Edward Wilson, he is as cold and calculating a character as I can ever remember on the screen. A man of very few words even when it comes to his wife and child. Obviously this affects his marriage but the film thankfully does not overbear on this point. For anyone whose read about CIA interrogation tactics, this movie will not shock or surprise you. Overall, a look inside of one of the most secretive organizations in American history should be reason enough for you to see this film, but if it's not then the superb acting and direction of De Niro will nonetheless draw you to see The Good Shepherd.<br /><br />Best Line EVER:<br /><br />Joseph Palmi (as played by Joe Pesci): The Italians we have our families and our kids, the Irish have their homeland, the Jews have their traditions, even the N----rs have their music...what do you people have?<br /><br />Edward Wilson (as played by Matt Damon): We have the United States of America, the rest of you are all visiting.</p></br><a href="../users/ANGH6401L9Y0T.html">ANGH6401L9Y0T</a><br/><p>OK, we know Matt Damon knows how to play a spy: dead-pan, giving nothing away on his face. But this one is without all the judo and guns. This is a spy who does it all with thinking. Does not make for a very big action-type story, but it is interesting.<br /><br />Edward Wilson is a member of Skull & Bones, and we get some inside information on what that's like -- assuming it's accurate, which how would I know? Let's just say that what I do know of secret societies in general, it seems authentic. So that's the first thing that puts him in line, on the insiders' network for espionage work during WWII, in the OSS. Once the war is over and they realize they are going to need spies in the face-off with the Soviets, he is recruited for a major role (apparently number three man) in the CIA.<br /><br />After that, the plot gets very, very complicated. He learned early on that there is no one he can trust, and that becomes more and more true the longer he is involved. Unfortunately, his son grows up to want to be a CIA man, too. And that is really why the plot is so darn complicated.<br /><br />I'm not going to spoil it for you. I can't anyway; I didn't understand half of what went on. I will need to see it another couple of times to figure it all out. But I wonder if I will bother. Frankly, it was disappointing.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LEV4H5ZQ55J2.html">A1LEV4H5ZQ55J2</a><br/><p>The two stars is for crackling and stoppages, too bad to continue. I never saw the movie.

As an eager, optimistic student at Yale, he is recruited to join the secret society Skull and Bones, a brotherhood and breeding ground for future world leaders. Wilson's acute mind, spotless reputation and sincere belief in American values render him a prime candidate for a career in intelligence, and he is soon recruited to work for the OSS (the precursor to the CIA) during WWII. As one of the covert founders of the CIA, working in the heart of an organization where duplicity is required and nothing is taken at face value. A masterful movie, but also one that demands your full attention.</p></br><a href="../users/A126KX6FVI4T66.html">A126KX6FVI4T66</a><br/><p>This movie gives the history of the C.I.A. from the WWII O.S.S.<br />through the 60's.<br />The US was betrayed by the British who had important Soviet moles.<br />The US couldn't do anything well or secret in the 50's and 60's<br />but the power of the secret agencies still grew.<br />Here we follow the life of a fictional counter-intelligence<br />operative/ executive through the post war and the Cuban Bay of Pigs failure.<br />His life isn't an ideal one and he learns from his teachers and experience to<br />trust no one.

Is the film saying that Matt Damon's character honored his beliefs and ideals during his CIA career, compromised them, or a combination of both?  It just wasn't clear how he felt about things, or even (equally unhelpful) how complicit he was in certain activities.  And while I don't begrudge Angelina Jolie playing the occasional unglamorous role, her shrill wife character seemed a waste of her talents.  "The Good Shepherd" gets a few points for looking good, a handful of tense scenes, and some good supporting performances (including one by director Robert De Niro), but overall it was a disappointment.  The DVD looks and sounds great, and features a selection of deleted scenes (revealing an entire excised subplot about the Angelina Jolie character's brother) as its sole special feature.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ.html">A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ</a><br/><p>Ambitious, star-studded, and lengthy, The Good Shepherd purports to give us a sense of how the CIA operated during the Cold War and how it affected those who devoted themselves to the cause.  So it is that, via a series of flashbacks, we meet an intelligent young Yale student named Edward Wilson (Matt Damon), watch as he is recruited into the service of American intelligence, joins the O.S.S. during WWII, helps found the nascent CIA in the 1950s, and goes about doing the thankless, extremely difficult job of keeping America safe through foreign crises, particularly those involving Castro's Cuba in the 1960s.  It's not an expose on the CIA - which it actually deals with quite even-handedly, especially in today's day and age - as it principally focuses on the personal story of this one individual and what might be called his dehumanization at the hands of his sometimes sinister career.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there is a major (but not fatal) flaw at the very heart of the film.  Obviously, a man in Edward Wilson's position must be a cold and calculating man, but his characterization ventures far beyond stoic into the realms of the robotic.  Even the personal glimpses intended to get us past the emotional wall that defines him lack insight and feeling.  We see through his eyes, but we never really get a sense of his inward self.  I also had a problem seeing Wilson as the experienced, upper level CIA man he became because no effort seemed to go in to making Matt Damon appear any older as his character aged; he looks the same in the 1960s as he did in 1939.  Come on, put a few grey hairs in there or something; it takes more than a fedora to make me believe he's a quarter of a century older.  Damon just never looks the part of an older Edward Wilson, and that really impacted - and not in a good way - my perspective of the entire movie.  Additionally, even though this is not a factual account of CIA history, the film's attempt to deflect any blame from John F. Kennedy for refusing to grant air support to the otherwise sitting ducks storming the beaches at the Bay of Pigs really rubbed me the wrong way.<br /><br />I think it helps to have some knowledge of the historical and political background of events touched upon in this movie, especially the dark stain that is the Bay of Pigs fiasco.  That is really the lynchpin of the film's story, as one of the reasons for the failure slowly causes Wilson's personal and private lives to collide and truly test his mettle - with more than a little help from the helping hands of a formidable KGB intelligence officer.  What should be an excruciatingly painful decision dredges up virtually no emotion in the man, however - although the same can't be said of Wilson's sometimes boisterous wife (Angelina Jolie).  The ending doesn't pack much of a punch either, further pointing out the film's quite obvious deficiencies in character development.  Personally, I found the movie pretty interesting throughout, but that was largely because of my interest in intelligence operations and Cold War history.  If you could care less about those subjects, you probably won't enjoy the movie at all because it simply fails to forge any kind of emotional bond between you and the characters.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>THE GOOD SHEPHERD may take a lot of patience to sit through the nearly three hour tale written by Eric Roth (Munich, Forrest Gump, Ali, The Horse Whisperer, etc) and directed with meticulous attention to detail by Robert De Niro, but in the end the film about the creation of CIA ("ever notice that no one these 'the CIA' just like no one use 'the God'?").  And although the script confuses the viewer by its propensity to meander over many time frames and many places, the result is a tense attention holding look at the machinations of big government and frightening big Intelligence organizations.<br /><br />We first meet Edward Bell Wilson (Matt Damon, who carries the film well)  as a son who witnesses his father's suicide, a fact he will hide for years. He follows in the family footsteps of attending Yale, participating in the infamous Skull and Bones secret club, and progressed to join the government as an agent for Intelligence, eventually helping to form CIA and participate in the Cold War tension with Russia and the Bay of Pigs incident.  Wilson is a nebbish on the surface, but underneath lies a man devoted to his country and a man capable of maintaining heavy secrets, even from his wife-of-necessity Clover (Angelina Jolie) whom he marries solely because he got her pregnant.  He is distant, covert, and seemingly cold, a trait that he will pass on to his son whose life following CIA  results in tragedy.<br /><br />Along the way from this personal side of the story the plot is filled with politicians, spies, Russian, moles, double agents - all the expected and needed characters for a story of this sort.  The cast includes such important actors as Billy Crudup, Joe Pesci, Alec Baldwin, a superb Tammy Blanchard, Robert De Niro himself, Keir Dullea, Michael Gambon, William Hurt, John Turturro, Timothy Hutton and Gabriel Macht, each performing excellent cameos.  The production values are equally strong with Robert Richardson as director of photography mixing historical footage with atmospheric cinematography, a fine musical score by Bruce Fowler and Marcelo Zarvos, and a tight editing by Tariq Anwar.  The film could easily have been cut by an hour without damaging the effect, but there is something to be said for the level of tension achieved by De Niro's choices that gives us a feeling of being a part of the Intelligence schemes. It takes patience, but the film is worth viewing.  Grady Harp, April 07</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>You can take the title of this review in two ways: 1) The star referencing Matt Damon's character portrayal of a government agent so loyal to his country that nothing comes a close second to the duty and honor he serves with. And 2) the star referencing the CIA and literally how it came into existence.<br /><br />I've seen some quotes directly or indirectly suggesting that The Good Shepard is "the best spy movie ever made". That may be true if you like a movie that is as long and wide as its aspect ratio with very little action.<br /><br />And the lack of action was deliberate on DiNiro's part (DiNiro directs and also co-stars). DiNiro is on record in almost every interview about the film as saying that The Good Shepard was more the story of the birth of counter-intelligence than it was a Bond-like action movie with gadgets, car chases and explosions.<br /><br />And indeed a good, interesting story it is. It definitely keeps you interested. The acting is superb. And, sure, there's a little action. But Hollywood lately is self-absorbed with movies that are well over 2 hours, and The Good Shepard's tune could have been named in a lot less than 167 minutes.<br /><br />That's right...2 hours and 47 minutes. I was reminded of this movie the other day as I was walking through the corrals that lead up to the airport security checkpoint....You go back and forth seemingly forever seeing the same people pass you on the left and right a dozen times before you reach your ultimate goal of putting your bag on the X-ray belt and walking through the metal detector with no real sense of joy that you just finished a task that should have taken 5 minutes but took 30 minutes. In The Good Shepard you wait and wait for something to happen seeing the same actors over and over again with very little action and then the movie just ends with no real sense that there was a story that led up to "that climactic moment".<br /><br />So do you want to hurry up and wait to see how the CIA was born? At minimum, it's a well-told story. Ya got a minute...or 167? Give The Good Shepard a large allocation of your time.</p></br><a href="../users/A18IK6YI6T3RK2.html">A18IK6YI6T3RK2</a><br/><p>This is a very hard film to love, eventhough it resonates from a good screenplay and top notch acting.  Damon is in top form and a stoic spook, his character is hard to like much less love, I really could not for the life of me figure out why Jolie stays with him for so long; he is a bad husband and an even worse father, it is heart wrenching to watch his young son beg for his father's attention and Damon all but ignore him.  Damon puts country above all else and its amazing how startlingly obtuse he is about his families needs.  The film is beautifully shot and though quite lengthy its does not lag.  I really liked Michael Gambon in this, he is not what he seems and his advice to Damon, though not heeded, was the most valuable intelligence Damon gets..get out while you still can.  Damon's character does several things in this movie, that seem so out of character for someone so measured and with very good survival skills, but i suppose it's to propel the narrative, but still it's perplexing.  Be sure to watch the deleted sceens, because, it includes a story line that should have been kept in the movie, De Niro should have cut some of himself out of this film and left some of the deleted sceens in.  There is a great sceen toward the end with Joe Peci, and Peci asked Damon, and im perapharsing, he says...we italians have family and church, the irish have the irish nationalism, the jews have tradition, and he asked Damon, what do you have..meaning the WASP establishment I suppose, and Damon says..I have the united states of america, you people are only visiting..it's shocking in its honestly perfectly illuminates how a person of his time and place would have thought..in a word..scary!</p></br><a href="../users/A2FEJIORC1MBG3.html">A2FEJIORC1MBG3</a><br/><p>Robert De Niro takes the director's chair in this 2006 CIA epic. Matt Damon stars as Edward Wilson, whose career as an agency spook begins with his enlistment into the OSS during WW 2 and continues through that organization's metamorphosis into the CIA.<br /><br />The film opens in 1961, at the time of the Bay of Pigs invasion. When we are first introduced to Wilson, it is quickly established that he is an officious and inscrutable, yet loyally dedicated Company man. As the story begins to jump back and forth in time (a la "Godfather II") we begin to get glimpses of what lies beneath Wilson's seemingly impenetrable veneer.<br /><br />We witness a (relatively) looser and more outgoing Wilson during his college days at Yale in 1939, as he is inducted into the infamous Skull and Bones society. As part of the initiation ritual, he is directed to regale his fellow Bonesmen with the deepest, darkest secret from his past. The club members get more than they bargain for as Wilson relates a harrowing childhood memory of bearing witness to his father's suicide. Moments before taking his own life, his father hands down a credo about "trust", which becomes the key to unlocking Wilson's inner workings for the remainder of the film.<br /><br />Therein lies the problem with "The Good Shepherd". There is an awful lot of internalizing going on (for 2 hours and 47 minutes). De Niro's plus as a director (not surprisingly) is his willingness to give his actors plenty of room to breathe and inhabit their characters. His minus as a director is his willingness to give his actors plenty of room to breathe and inhabit their characters, if you catch my drift. There are some pacing issues with the film. Not that I was expecting car chases and stuff blowing up real good. After all, the reality of espionage does not necessarily lend itself to flash cuts and pop music montage. It's generally a somewhat somber, mundane and unpleasant business.<br /><br />Eric Roth's script has its moments, but gets murky when it comes to the intrigue. It is tough to keep track of who is doing what to whom, and why (and at times, for whose "side"?). Granted, perhaps that is part of the point; torture is torture and murder is murder, no matter how one attempts to rationalize (a point that Steven Spielberg more than sufficiently bludgeoned us over the head with in "Munich") but I GET it,already.<br /><br />Perhaps the most fatal flaw in the film is Matt Damon's unconvincing "aging". There is not much discernable physical transformation between Wilson's collegiate years and middle age. (Maybe some better prosthetic work could have helped?). At any rate, I just wasn't buying it, and found it to be a major distraction. Damon is a fine actor, but I think he may have been slightly miscast here. History buffs may still find the film worth a look.</p></br><a href="../users/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ.html">A12X2J7AVZ04IQ</a><br/><p>The trailers for "The Good Shepherd" looked really exciting; lots of action, etc. Apparently, all 2 minutes of action were packed into that trailer. This is not to say the film isn't worthy; it IS...on many levels. Matt Damon really is one of our current best actors, and he commands attention. The confusing time-shifts weren't helpful; don't know if that was a problem of director de Niro or the editor or writer. There's a terrifc cast, though Jolie was sorely miscast. Alec Baldwin & Damon had some good banter, as they did in "The Departed". I could watch a film with only those two, and be more entertained than all of "The Good Shepherd". The historical accuracy of this telling of the founding of the CIA is questionable, and putting it in the same league as Carol Reed's "The Third Man", or Demme's "Silence of the Lambs" cannot allow me to put this on my list of favorites. I admire Matt Damon a lot, and he's fine, but the overall result was disappointing for me. Apparently, I missed something, including the 2? hours of my life that were taken up, and I'm too old to waste the time.</p></br><a href="../users/A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8.html">A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8</a><br/><p>This movie is a fictionalized oral history of the genesis of the CIA, from its early days as the "Office of Strategic Services" through the Bay of Pigs debacle.  Its real story is the sacrifice that its protagonist "Edward Wilson" (Matt Damon) makes in order to serve the agency.  The Wilson character is a loose fictionalization of real-life former CIA Deputy Director for Counterintelligence James Jesus Angleton.<br /><br />I enjoyed this movie, and it is full of atmosphere, good dialog, and interesting historical background. There are lots of minor appearances by big stars such as Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, William Hurt, and others. What this film sorely lacks is a solid plot.  There simply isn't one, which is surprising.  Essentially the film takes the Wilson character at about the Bay of Pigs time frame, into a series of flashbacks, as we see how his entire life has centered around his devotion to the CIA to the exclusion of all else.  The "plot" if there is one, is simply this theme: that Wilson sacrifices all, family, fatherhood, his marriage, to serve the CIA.  During World War II and its aftermath, he simply disappears to his new wife for six years, and when he abruptly returns, he is not surprisingly a stranger to her.  This indifference to family in favor of career and devotion to duty is the real theme of this film.<br /><br />I enjoyed this film for its atmosphere and subject matter, but the lack of a plot is impossible not to miss and regret, because this could have been a great movie.  Cold War espionage offers limitless possibilities for telling a solid story (i.e. one with a plot and solid storyline) and the story of James Jesus Angleton is a fascinating one that would make for a superb film, properly done. This piece, however, does not succeed in being that film. That is truly unfortunate.<br /><br />Angleton fought for years to prevent KGB infiltration of the CIA, and this caused an awesome amount of turmoil within the Agency.  After Angleton left as head of Counter-intelligence, a series of catastrophes ensued within the CIA.  We were treated to the Walker spy scandals, Aldrich Aimes, the Hansen betrayal, and other counterintelligence debacles of the type that Angleton prevented during his watch.  He truly was "The Good Shephard."  Unfortunately, this film fails to really tell this story, and leaves the viewer wishing for more plot and less atmosphere.</p></br><a href="../users/A1435P5AMCPB3X.html">A1435P5AMCPB3X</a><br/><p>This film has a lot of filler that needs to hit the cutting room floor.  The tale unfolds initially disjointed, but the pieces do fall in place after a long,long time.  This is a good story about a very cold, stoic man who has a love for his country, but constrains himself so much that he looses sight of his family and personal life. There is a lot of crossing and double crossing, which is complicated, but drug out longer than it needs.  Overall, worth a viewing, and a nice change of pace for Angelina Jolee and Matt Damon, but not worth buying.</p></br><a href="../users/A32AK8FOAZEPE2.html">A32AK8FOAZEPE2</a><br/><p>a repeated personal and family sacrificial tragedy, but also a triumph of patriotism. endless manipulations and betrayals. the truth shalt set thee free? yeah, even covert operation still won't avoid others watching over your shoulders. but for national security, now tab into citizens' phone calls and emails are legit just because the potus said he is the law and above the law. those cia guys call themselves the freedom fighters. the ends always justify the means. so in order to declare and claim that you are 110% patriotic, you fly small american flags together with the purple lakers or dodgers banners over the roof of your car windows. putting ribbon stickers on your cars' rear ends to show that you support the troops whole-heartedly, no matter they died in vain for a war that should never had been launched. of course, we citizens are more mature and more reasonable now, 110% different from what we treated our troops during the vietnam war.<br /><br />yeah, we are the good shepherd of the world peace, just like the guy said in the movie:<br /><br />'we always try to keep the war small.'<br /><br />as the potus stubbornly declared again and again: 'no matter how many g.i. died in iraq, still worth it!' he sure is a good shepherd of this country.<br /><br />amen.</p></br><a href="../users/ARA48345JZPZR.html">ARA48345JZPZR</a><br/><p>The Good Shepherd is a very very good film that I would be reluctant to recommend to many because despite it having a fictionalized history of the genesis of the CIA as its setting, and its cold look at real spycraft, it is really a very quiet and cerebral character study of the sacrifices one man makes for the sake of his country, and the toll taken not only upon himself but also those around him by the life of duplicity, distrust, compromise and real betrayal that this engenders.  I don't know how a 2-1/2 hour movie with so button-downed and taciturn a central character as Matt Damon's Edward Wilson will play in multiplex land, but I give all due credit to Damon for embodying this tightly-wrapped, detached man and Robert DeNiro as director for having the courage to center his film on such a cool and enigmatic protagonist.<br /><br />Using the 1961 Cuban Bay of Pigs disaster as a framing device, we flashback to 1939 Yale and we see Damon's Edward Wilson as a young Eli soon to be inducted into Skull and Bones where he will join the American WASP elite.  I'm glad DeNiro spends a bit of time here as we see Wilson as a brilliant and sensitive young man, seemingly with both heart and humor, with a potential to go in many directions in his life.  A telling secret of his life is revealed in his Skull & Bones initiation, and soon, for several reasons, he is singled out for the World War II OSS clandestine service and sent to London, England.  But not before impregnating the sister of one of his elite brethern and duly marrying her on the eve of his departure.  This marriage will be costly to Edward immediately and eventually to his wife and son as the years progress.<br /><br />Wartime London intrigue ensues and later postwar Berlin and the beginning of the Cold War.  We watch as Edward not only learns his craft, but we see how he begins to shelve his emotions, tighten his grip on himself and don an impenetrable mask of detached stoicism. Edward Wilson is becoming "serious and humorless" and as he shuts-down only glimpses of the younger man appear. Through these scenes we also meet several key characters in the espionage game that will play important parts throughout the story, not the least being the man who will be Edward's opposite number in the KGB, code named Ulysses.  The KGB man tells Edward he is code-named "Mother" and that his propensity for silence is noted and respected.  Both men realize their opposite will be formidable and that this will be a very serious and deadly game they are about to play.<br /><br />Edward returns home post-war to a marriage with a stranger, a son he doesn't relate well to and has little time for, and to the deadly games of the Cold War, dueling with the KGB in proxy wars around the world while coping with moles and betrayal and the internecine wars of bureaucracy.  It all comes full circle in ways tragic and sad.<br /><br />Matt Damon had an incredible challenge playing a man so closed that almost no one knows him.  Apparently a composite of several early CIA founders, most notably the brilliant, mole-obsessed James Jesus Angleton, this character is a man that expects betrayal, can trust no one around him and ultimately cannot trust himself in the form of his own emotions.  Damon somehow conveys the man's inner anguish without breaking his stern outer resolve.  And yet we see flashes, glimpses of the man's regrets, of his lost capacity to love and give of himself.<br /><br />There are coincidences and some doubtful scenes and situations that Edward particpates in or witnesses that seem a bit contrived but are necessary to broaden the scope of the film, and it is a truncated history by necessity.  I can't speak to whether some of the methods and tactics as shown, in particular one interrogation scene, are accurate for the period, and the assertion by a defector that the Soviet Union is bankrupt and hollow rings false for 1961, but overall the mood and tone of the piece seems right.  The nonchalance of the privileged elite in assuming leadership roles and the WASP heritage of the OSS and its offspring is presented well and no doubt persists into our world if you think of the Skull & Bones contest of the 2004 Presidential election.<br /><br />At any rate, I applaud DeNiro and company for taking on such non-General audience material. This is John Le Carre territory, and has much more in common with the Alec Guinness versions of his spy stories as seen in the TV productions of "Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy" and "Smiley's People", with an equally inscrutable central character, than Bourne or Bond or whatever.  This is espionage carried out by a polyglot confusion of often damaged people: patriots, true-believers, careerists, liars, cheats, thieves, sadists and worse--the callous, greedy and corrupt.  As one of them says spies are ultimately "romantics" and romantics are ever doomed to disappointment and failure.  The DeNiro character (based on Wild Bill Donovan, founder and legend of OSS)says "in the end we're all clerks" or "bootmakers for the King" as another says.<br /><br />Watching the idealism of Damon's Edward Wilson harden into the ruthless pragmatism of the cool and calculating ultimate bureaucrat was a chilling and worthwhile experience for me.  It is a hard, often cruel world we live in, and the world these people inhabit is very hard indeed, and we cannot expect the people we ask to live there not to be somehow affected. Edward's final compromise with himself and his ideals is that he can make no compromise with who he is and what he does.  They are now one and the same.  Ideals have been replaced by sheer, rigorous efficiency, and conscience by lies within lies and secrets within secrets<br /><br />The cast supporting Damon (Hurt, Turturro, Baldwin, Crudup, Jolie, Gambon et al)is fine. The production likewise. In an interview DeNiro said that he hopes to continue this story with at least one more film.  I hope this one is successful enough that he gets the chance to do so, as I would like to see this story taken forward all the way up to our times.  I remember when films like The Spy Who Came In From the Cold or All the President's Men could be hits.  I hope this film can find its audience as well, for it is a fine effort.</p></br><a href="../users/A1J03J0HZ7KU5T.html">A1J03J0HZ7KU5T</a><br/><p>Though not for all tastes, "The Good Shepherd" (2006) is an engrossing spy drama in the John le Carr&eacute; tradition. Director Robert De Niro gets the most out of his well-cast ensemble, with Matt Damon remarkably effective as the emotionally cold CIA operative and co-founder. Running nearly three hours, the film's leisurely pace works in its favor - chronicling the CIA's evolution from 1939 to the Bay of Pigs fiasco in 1961. Hopefully, De Niro will continue to explore this fascinating saga in his next directorial project.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KEZLJ59C1JVH.html">A3KEZLJ59C1JVH</a><br/><p>"The Good Shepherd" is an interesting film about Edward Wilson (Matt Damon), a bright young man who graduates from Yale University and goes on to become one of the founding members of the CIA. The movie is set against a variety of important events in U.S. history, which makes the whole government/political aspect of the film very detailed and accurate. However, there's no spark on the emotional side of things. Damon delivers a strong performance as much as the script allows, but his character is a hollow shell of a man who lacks any emotion or feeling, and therefore makes it virtually impossible for the audience to sympathize for him in any way. This movie is almost three hours long, which seems like a lifetime when you haven't developed any sort of attachment to the main character. The supporting cast of the film is very impressive and includes the likes of Angelina Jolie, Joe Pesci, and Robert De Niro (who also directed the film). However, I don't think any of the characters were well-developed enough to allow the actors to display their vast talents, and therefore this film kind of missed its mark for me.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJPMB7N776WS.html">A1TJPMB7N776WS</a><br/><p>Edward Wilson (Matt Damon) is a somber, quiet man. Every morning he leaves his middle class home in the suburbs and along with his neighbors boards a bus for downtown D.C. But unlike his neighbors, who presumably work as office functionaries, Wilson is a top, experienced, "higher-up" for the C.I.A. and though, on the surface dressed exactly like his neighbors in felt fedora and Sears trench coats, Wilson is headed for the monolith that is the C.I.A. headquarters.<br />As written by Eric Roth and directed by Robert De Niro (De Niro's only other directing job was "A Bronx Tale"), "The Good Shepherd" traces the genesis of the C.I.A. as it evolves from the World War II O.S.S. and central to this terrific, fascinating, intelligently written and passionately directed movie is the story of Wilson himself and the ultimate tragedy of his life: a life that begins to unravel the moment he agrees to become a spy right out of college.<br />Wilson, as portrayed by Matt Damon is the perfect spy if there is such a thing: he is without humor, looks like a thousand other men, dresses like a small town banker and is passionate about only two things: his son and his miniature ship in a bottle hobby. And anytime he strays from these two things, as in women or sex, he fails miserably.<br />The world of Espionage is a dirty business, one that defies and twists the basic notions of truth, loyalty and pride. For Wilson there is almost no room for anything else: upon marrying he leaves his pregnant girlfriend, Clover(Angelina Jolie) for six years to serve in Europe without thinking about it twice.  His life is his work and his work ultimately ruins his life by chipping away at the basic goodness and humanity that infuses his core self. By the end of this film, he is used up...hollow.<br />"The Good Shepherd" moves back and forward in time from Wilson's initiation into the Skulls and Bones at Yale through the Bay of Pigs fiasco in 1961 and though the running time is approximately three hours, you are never bored for on the one hand, De Niro keeps things moving quickly and on the other the subject matter is rife with conflict, mystery and operates on the very highest level of commitment and interest.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VIOCJZ22JZXT.html">A3VIOCJZ22JZXT</a><br/><p>I gave this film 5 stars for its courage and willingness to trust the intelligence of the audience to unravel a complex plot and complicated relationships. This is not an easy film for those who don't wish to solve the multiple puzzles we are presented. The film reflects a philosophy that both character analysis and espionage are complex, multi-layered, and often are not what they seem on the surface.<br /><br />The film uses a crisis situation at the CIA to unfold the history of the CIA as well as the history of the agency's top administrators that parallels the development of the agency and its mission. The Bay of Pigs invasion is a failure and it appears that Fidel Castro and his Soviet handlers were well aware of where the invading force would land on the coast of Cuba. This crisis is revisited repeatedly as we see the development of the CIA and the development of Edmund Wilson, an OSS Officer who becomes a CIA founder.<br /><br />Matt Damon plays a resolved, cold character, Edmund Wilson, who is dedicated to the protection of his country even though there are multiple consequences for him, his wife, and his son. He receives two odd, manipulated video and audio tapes that begin to reveal who might have tipped off the soviets and Fidel that the Americans were coming. These tapes are all part of a complex effort to neutralize Wilson by the KGB.<br /><br />The film traces the development of the agency from its OSS roots in World War II. Wilson becomes a spy and is located in London during the war where he is involved with some of the spy and counter-spy activities with the Nazis. His old English Professor at Yale turns out to be a spy who mentors him during the war on intelligence gathering and analysis. However after the war in post-war Berlin he gets to fully experience and develop his craft in a cat and mouse game with the Soviets as they try to find Nazi scientists that both wish to capture and recruit for the emerging cold war.<br /><br />Yet all these espionage experiences also teach him that he can not trust anyone as he experiences duplicity from trusted friends and associates. Gradually Wilson becomes more aware of his KGB rival and they play a deadly and complex game to undermine each other's attempts at intelligence gathering. For example, Wilson attempts to get Nazi scientists out of Germany before the Soviets can obtain them. His translator is eventually revealed to be a spy who is helping the Soviets obtain the scientists or at least trade Jewish scientists for Nazi scientists.<br /><br />The Soviet spy known as Ulysses sends decoy officials to give disinformation to the CIA, he follows Wilson and tries to disrupt his marriage when Wilson has a one-night-stand with an old girlfriend. Eventually the pain and intrigue gets closer and closer to Wilson, trying to find a way to compromise his integrity and put him in a position to give information to the Soviets.<br /><br />I found the film very interesting and complex, requiring me to pay attention to subtle relationships, images, lines of dialogue, and understated movements. This gives the film a feeling of authenticity. In addition, the KGB and the CIA both played very dirty and this seems very realistic. We see spies killed once they are no longer needed and have too much information to allow to live.<br /><br />The cast was superb with Matt Damon playing a cool, hardened man who has sacrificed much for his country yet his sacrifice is silent and only he really knows the extent of what he has lost and how little he has personally gained. In fact, the man had not really gained personally at all except that he has been given intellectually devious competition against which he feels he must prevail. He sacrificed his first love to marry the pregnant sister of his Yale friend and co-member of the Skull and Bones club.<br /><br />Angelina Jolie plays the flirty passionate Senator's daughter who becomes married to a cold man possessed with a mission to protect the USA. She is neglected and resentful. Years of absence from the home distances husband and wife until Edmund can only feel compassion for his wife for all she has endured to support his career and dedication.<br /><br />William Hurt plays the handsome, smart, first director of the CIA who overplays his hand by becoming a board member of a coffee company that benefits from the CIA assassinating the President of a Latin American nation that was nationalizing the businesses within their borders on a path toward Communism. Edmund Wilson gentle lets him know that the game is up and thus allows him to resign and move on without scandal.<br /><br />Robert De Nero plays the role of a General who heads OSS and then lays the groundwork for the CIA at the end of WWII. Alec Balwin plays a cool detached FBI agent who is an ally for Wilson and allows him to identify problem personnel within the CIA. Billy Crudup plays his British counterpart and mentor who eventually is revealed to be something other than what he presents. Joe Pesci plays a Mafia don who assists in the Bay of Pigs invasion when Castro takes over 4 of his casinos in Havana.<br /><br />Eventually the Bay of Pigs crisis is resolved from the intelligence aspect and the culprit who has said too much is revealed. Heavy prices are paid.<br /><br />Those that serve their country with their minds are often overlooked and under appreciated since they make personal sacrifice that only they know have been made. The sacrifices are not made just by the individual who is in government service, but also by those that love him/her and those that he/she loves. This intelligent film honors all those individuals. It is brave motion picture making.</p></br><a href="../users/A17FLA8HQOFVIG.html">A17FLA8HQOFVIG</a><br/><p>Directed by Robert DiNiro, this is the fictionalized story of the beginnings of the CIA.  Matt Damon is cast as Robert Wilson, a composite character who believed in America and closed his eyes to some of its abuses in the belief that he was doing the best he could for his country.  We see him first as a young man joining the Skull and Bones society at Yale, a secret society steeped in tradition which shaped the lives of many of America's leaders.  The CIA is a secret society too, and as the film progresses the audience sees how it shapes its members.  There's a code of right and wrong here, and Wilson makes choices about what he sees as "right".  He marries Angelina Jolie because she is pregnant, but her life is lonely and unfulfilled because he never loves her.  His relationship with his son as well as everyone else has a wide variety of strings attached.  And, in the, end, Robert Wilson learns the price of a life filled with righteous deception.<br /><br />Matt Damon's acting ability is flawless in this film.  He embodies his character completely.  The storyline however, is extremely confusing and I suspect it was by design.  The audience often does not know what is happening or why.  This soon grows tedious to watch however, especially as the film is more than three hours long and it is impossible to be sure of who the bad guys and the good guys are.  As a result, I was bored a lot and even though this is clearly a worthwhile film, there are lots of problems with the fuzzy plot.<br /><br />For many, the appeal of excellent acting and a critique of the CIA's role in America since the 1960s will result in a satisfying film experience.  It wasn't quite enough for me however.</p></br><a href="../users/A3SU3TXON36T0X.html">A3SU3TXON36T0X</a><br/><p>_The Good Shepherd_ is a paranoid's delight, detailing the rise of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) as it initially developed following World War II.  Directed by Robert DeNiro (who also has a role in the film as a general who played a key part in creating the CIA), this film shows us a rare glimpse into the world of spies and counter-spies, paranoia, and secrecy that surrounds the cult of intelligence.  Much of the film is indeed an accurate portrayal of the history of said agency and its role in America's foreign policy decision making throughout much of the Twentieth Century.  The film follows the career of Edward Wilson (played by Matt Damon) from his early years as a poetry student at Yale University, periodically spying on his professors who allegedly were linked to Nazi-sympathetic organizations, to his role in the development of the Allied intelligence community during World War II, to the creation of the CIA and the birth of the Cold War and beyond.  The film is one of epic proportions (some have compared it to other classics such as _The Godfather_) and is essential viewing for all thinking people.  In the world of undercover operations, no one is to be trusted.  Whether or not a certain individual is in fact working for Allied intelligence, the Nazis, or later the Soviets simply cannot be determined, and we witness this world develop as the sense of trust breaks down and paranoia ensues.  The movie travels back and forth between the events that gave rise to the Bay of Pigs fiasco (also hinting at the later Kennedy assassination - believed by some conspiracy theorists to have been the work of the CIA) and the earlier career of Wilson.  At Yale University, Wilson joins up with the class of upper crust WASPs (the "Old Americans") and takes part in their adolescent rituals as part of the ultra-secretive Skull and Bones fraternity.  (Many of our political leaders have arisen from this fraternity and some have conjectured that they are responsible for wielding the true power in the world.  The movie even hints at the idea that they may have been responsible for "Soviet power" as well, as the true puppet masters behind world events.)  Wilson falls in love with a deaf girl (he has a certain "weakness" for deaf girls as we are to see later in the movie); however, a brief affair of his with an upper class girl leads to an unplanned pregnancy and thus forces him to marry.  (However, it should be pointed out that one gets the impression that the "elites" are manipulating the whole thing from behind the scenes anyway, because throughout the movie never once is definitive proof provided that the child is even his.  Furthermore, he is to go away for a long time to aid the Allied war effort and thus is not even there to see his newborn son.)  From his early days of spying on university professors (or are they really?), Wilson becomes more and more involved in the intelligence community.  This leads him to serve on the side of the Allies during World War II.  Following World War II, the Allied leaders make a trade of Nazi scientists for Jewish scientists, and thus begins the Cold War as the Soviet power and America and Britain contend for control of the world.  Eventually a series of events will force Wilson to make the ultimate sacrifice - one of many in his desire to further the aims of American imperialism and consolidate the power of the CIA.  The movie also shows and hints at such historical realities as the presence of homosexuals in the intelligence community (and the fact of their homosexuality being used to blackmail them - the rites of the Skull and Bones fraternity could also be described as vaguely homoerotic for that matter!) and the CIA's experiments with drugs (in particular LSD).  There are some rather chilling lines and uncanny prophecies in this movie which haunted me for days following my viewing of it.  At one point Robert DeNiro's character remarks that it was the "clerks and civil servants" who gave Hitler his power, and thus it will be necessary to somehow limit the CIA's power because otherwise it runs the risk of creating a totalitarian surveillance state.  Secondly, at one point in the movie Matt Damon's character (Wilson) is asked by Joe Pesci (playing an Italian mobster) what "his people" (presumably the upper crust WASPs) have, mentioning that the Italians have the church, Jews have their tradition, and blacks have their music.  To this, Damon replies that they have the United States of America and that the rest are just visitors here.  At another point, it is said that the people from the CIA never put a "the" in front of CIA.  When asked why, they reply that putting a "the" in front of CIA would be like putting a "the" in front of God.  (Angelina Jolie's character remarks on several occassions that during the dinners of the Skull and Bones fraternity they first account for all members of the Bonesmen and then invoke God.  As she puts it, "Agency first, God second.")  These are some of the chilling lines from the movie.  Ultimately the movie raises some very disturbing questions about the nature of government.  As America heads further and further towards a surveillance state (brought further in that direction with each impending war), it becomes necessary to examine where we have come from.  As is asked in the movie, do the elite controllers who make and break world events try to keep war to a minimum, or do they merely use war to further their own agendas and consolidate their power?  Certainly a scary question to ponder.  I feel that this movie offers much to think about (and ultimately is very frightening!), but so long as the tough questions remain unasked and people remain asleep at the wheel, it will be that much easier for those in power to slide us off into totalitarianism.  Finally, I should say that I find it odd that this movie (which not only offers much food for thought but is genuinely very well put together) has gathered such low reviews.  Perhaps it is just a further indication of the fact that the public does not like to think and ask questions and this is scary in and of itself.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MNMZMM6BGLTA.html">A2MNMZMM6BGLTA</a><br/><p>I enjoyed this movie very much. Everything about it was good. There is only one flaw that was very distracting to me. Everybody in the movie ages... everybody but Matt Damon. He looks exactly the same as an aging CIA man as he did when he was a young homoerotic Skull and Bones pledge. Other than that I thought the movie was great. Oh, and casting John Boy Walton as Damons son was kind of bad too. The guy wasn't bad but he was the A-typical 'weakling son of the strong dad' role.</p></br><a href="../users/A3B87UZLPCF0HW.html">A3B87UZLPCF0HW</a><br/><p>De Niro's first outing in the director's seat since his 1993 debut A Bronx Tale is an in-depth look at the birth of the CIA as seen through the eyes of one of its first agents, Edward Wilson (Damon). Wilson, recruited by the OSS - a counter-intelligence unit - during WWII, is approached by General Bill Sullivan (De Niro) to help build an organization to be the "eyes and ears, not the heart and soul" of the United States. Wilson throws himself into his work, but Cold War paranoia takes over and, distrusting all around him, his job has dire consequences for his marriage (to Jolie), his family and his sanity. The Good Shepherd is a nuts-and-bolts, behind-the-scenes peek at a spy genre - the flipside to The Bourne Identity, the paperwork behind a James Bond mission, a cloak-and-dagger film without the dagger. Pretty good I would say.</p></br><a href="../users/A100JCBNALJFAW.html">A100JCBNALJFAW</a><br/><p>i felt it may have been a little too long. at times i found my self trailing off the plot because there are a few scence that are a little boring. but all in all i likie CIA film and this one is about the leak that came out during the bay of pigs. pretty good alittle dragging but not bad.</p></br><a href="../users/A39AWL2FKWDFK6.html">A39AWL2FKWDFK6</a><br/><p>The Robert DeNiro directed "The Good Shepherd" was an overly ambitious, 167 minute film that chronicled the formulation of the CIA through the eyes of the humorless Edward Wilson played by Matt Damon.  Damon playing the eventual CIA head of counter intelligence was one of a star studded cast that couldn't save this plodding film which could have been cropped by at least 30 minutes.  Not only was the film editing questionable but the musical score often times drowned out the dialogue.  The characters were not particularly well developed diminishing their ability to evoke empathy for them.  Venerable veteran actors like Joe Pesci, Timothy Hutton and DeNiro himself were given toothless cameos that didn't showcase their abilities.<br /><br />DeNiro who also starred in the film as General Bill Sullivan, a prominent architect of the CIA, used a flashback format to weave his tale.  Damon seen in the film's present, 1961, takes partial responsibility for the Cuban Bay of Pigs fiasco.  We are then time warped back to the late 1930's to Damon's induction into Yale University's prestigious Skull and Bones fraternal order.  His privileged background allows him to travel in the upper echelons of society.  He is soon recruited by FBI agent Sam Murach played by Alec Baldwin to spy on his thesis professor Fredericks played by Michael Gambon who is sympathetic to Nazism.<br /><br />Soon after being cajoled into marriage as a result of a sexual fling resulting in pregnancy with loose society girl Clover Russell played by a miscast Angelina Jolie, Damon enlists with the intelligence arm of the military. He spends 6 years in Europe separated from his wife and son running the O.S.S. in London ably assisted by John Turturro playing Ray Brocco. On and on the story goes.  The O.S.S. becomes the CIA and Damon rises in the ranks of the intelligence hierarchy.<br /><br />The central theme to the story is Damon's dedication to the service and his country while eschewing his family.  What goes around comes around as Damon's son, Edward Jr. now grown up and played by Eddie Redmayne also joins the CIA putting Damon in the crosshairs of his Soviet counterpart Ulysses played by Oleg Shtefanko.</p></br><a href="../users/ANIMV3SPDD8SH.html">ANIMV3SPDD8SH</a><br/><p>The premise of the history of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), from a college frat-like tough boy club, where pig-pen mud wrestling and macho truth or dare sessions, ("Tell us something about yourself you've never told anyone"), were the order of the day, through to a troubled and scrutinized CIA in the early 1960's and the Cuban Bay of Pigs missile crisis, makes, as backdrop, a much more intriguing story than THE GOOD SHEPHERD's main focus - an upstart recruit's success and conflict, during the founding years of the organization, as he tries to live by his belief to know who you can trust. He soon finds he can trust no one but himself, but before we are accustomed to Matt Damon's bookish characterization of a serious minded government agent, (he's described as a tight-"behind" with no sense of humor), we can't help but wonder why he was so aggresively sought out by the CIA as a junior member. He's first seen, in drag, make-up, wig and falsetto voice, on a college theatrical stage singing in a Gilbert and Sullivan opera. He is, (gulp) a poetry student, and his father committed suicide with the distinction of being a traitor to the U.S. government. These should not be high marks on a CIA score card. But without further explanation he's sought after as if he's the ideal candidate. The rest of the film is a series of knee-deep espionage, and double agent revelations that apparently astounded the filmmakers, (musical score soars), but which could be found as passive page-turners in a mediocre paperback spy novel, (watch out for the brunette with the 'hearing aid' and eastern European accent who asks you over for dinner; wink, wink, nudge, nudge). The film goes on for three hours and is missing a narrative drive despite some dramatic pitstops along the way; Angelina Jolie is quite effective as Damon's socialite wife, and the Bay of Pigs segment seems an accurate portrait of the blundering by the U.S. government, but THE GOOD SHEPHERD mostly shepherds along as if searching a landmark statement it never reveals.</p></br><a href="../users/A38QEATH3NODFM.html">A38QEATH3NODFM</a><br/><p>I had heard mixed reviews about this film, but finally decided to check it out. It is an iteresting piece about the beginning of the CIA and the conflicts early on in the cold war. The movie is a reflection of an agents life from his beginning in the military intelligence in WWII to him signing on with the CIA.  Its done in a number of flashback, and the main film is taking place after the failed Bay of Pigs invasion in Cuba back in mid april 1961.  A lot of stories to try and pick up on, lots of double crossing plots etc, but in the end I was left dissappointed. I thought the plot gave itself up earlier than expected, and then the movie just kinda ended, just fizzling out. It was a long film 2 H 49 min, and I think at the end of the film some big things happened, but just got drug out as the rest of the film did.  Just to long, lost its pizazz, and really wattered down what could have been great.  Could have been condensed to about 2 hours and still been good. Worth watching if you like a little mystery and suspense, as well as a look at that period in history, one which I was happy to see a portrayal of and lead me to do and sparked me to do a little reseach in history.</p></br><a href="../users/A39IBJB2PBVC7I.html">A39IBJB2PBVC7I</a><br/><p>There's an old joke in Hollywood that goes: (Q.)  What are the four most frightening words an actor can ever speak?  (A.)  "I want to direct."  When the actor is Robert Di Niro, (certain to be surrounded by adoring Yes-Men), the results can be as frightening as an exploding cigar or poisoned martini.<br /><br />The Good Shepherd is a true "cameo-fest," no lesser a light than Joe Pesci gets about 5 lines (although they are memorable.)  Alec Baldwin was probably done his scenes in half a day.  (Di Niro himself provides a listless shuffle-on.)  While Jolie, Turturro, Gambon, Hutton, and Hurt are around a bit longer, none are around long enough to help.<br /><br />Di Niro also shows us his Hollywood juice through funding; the film is beautifully produced, time and place are evoked exceptionally well, clothes, cars, interior design, all done with great care.  Why then is The Good Shepherd longer than a Sunday afternoon double-header between two last place teams?  For starters, the run-time is a shockingly self-indulgent 167 minutes, pushing the 3-hour envelope.  For another, absolutely nothing happens.  It would be tempting to blame this on Matt Damon, (still unconvincing when playing an adult, much less an adult in a position of authority), or on Eric Roth, who wrote the screenplay.  But Damon, as the "anti-Bourne," is clearly doing what's he's told, and Roth's screenplay might have been good had it been significantly tightened.<br /><br />As readers of John Le Carre know, the actual work of spies, the tradecraft, is extremely boring.  The fascinating aspect of their world lies in the personalities of these people, their emptiness, their loneliness, their complete inability to trust, their facility with lies until they arrive at the point where they're barely able to believe themselves, and the devastating emotional toll all of this takes.  Carre's work walks you through this inner landscape in a way film never can, because film is a visual medium, and watching a stone faced Matt Damon for the better part of 3 hours tells us nothing - which is rather the point - his ability to reveal nothing serves him well as a spy.<br /><br />Di Niro gets an "A" for hubris, he strong-armed a lot of "names" onto the set.  And he gets an "A" for ambition, it's a complex story of inner turmoil, difficult moral choices, layers of deception, and the clash between idealism and pragmatism.  But he gets an "F" for implementation and direction, averaging out to a "C."  Where The Spy Who Came In From The Cold succeeded because of its laser-sharp focus; bloated scope and lack of character insight cause The Good Shepherd to resemble the Bay of Pigs.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FCWRSICTO2AH.html">A1FCWRSICTO2AH</a><br/><p>"The Good Shepherd" is an interesting, but ultimately frustrating, close to three hour slog.  DeNiro, who directed the movie, shows, for the most part, restraint in his CIA epic.  There are some preachy moments where DeNiro seems to be making some comment on current events, and even a few Oliver Stone like whoppers, cloaked in the movie's muted tone.  Whatever.  But at one point there is the inevitable Be-Careful-You-Don't-Lose-Your-Soul line.  The problem is that the movie, by the time that line is delivered, has established in the viewer's mind that what is being watched is pretty much soulless exercise in filmmaking.  As much as it wants to be, the film never seems to develop into an Epic.  The Length is there, the meticulous craftsmanship in the framing of scenes (why I'm giving this 3 stars), but when it comes to getting a real historical sweep, things get hazy.  Oh, there's the Bay of Pigs, and old Nazi clips, but historical hooks are surprisingly few.  The lead casting is also very questionable.  Damon as the robotic and detached "company" man, Edward Wilson, and the exotic Jolie as the wife and mother, Clover - Margaret, is bizarre.  Actually, both actors do very well, it's just that physically they seem to be wrong fits for the roles.  Further, neither actor seems to ever age in a movie that spans decades.  The model here, was obviously the "Godfather II."  Unfortunately, the Good Shepherd lack both the scale and the story of what is one of the greatest American films.  And that should have been expected.<br /><br />The movie does have several "good" moments however.  The Skull & Crossbones stuff, seemed pretty authentic, even if you've read about it a dozen times in fiction and nonfiction.  And the plane ride murder is chilling, as is the brutal interrogation of a defector.  But three hours worth?  No. Try the "Quiet American," it's shorter, and much better film that deals with the world of shadows.</p></br><a href="../users/AVT9Q9PTUCDMR.html">AVT9Q9PTUCDMR</a><br/><p>At 2 hours and 47 minutes this thing plods along and the worse thing about the DVD package is the extras are only "deleted scenes" meaning they actually edited this movie? What was it originally, an over 3-hour epic?<br /><br />I was pleading telepathically for Matt Damon's character to morph into Jason Bourne and start slapping people to wake up out of their comatose-like acting. Despite heavy hitters such as Angelina Jolie's lips, William Hurt's wig and Alec Baldwin's gut showing up to gain screen time, apparently Robert De Niro was too lazy to actually lift himself from a chair during two scenes in this movie.<br /><br />A complete mess at attempting to "explain" the CIA's rise in a movie. maybe it does depict accurately how the CIA started, works and goes about its business. All I can say on celluloid it's not worthy of watching unless you enjoy paint drying while waiting for a bus that never comes. Excuse the analogy but this topic is better served in book form or as a legit documentary. As a movie, this thing is a total snoozer.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>Everything from the plot, dialogue, directing, and acting is just average. Matt Damon's character is beyond boring, Angelina Jolie wasn't needed, and the other top actors just have bit roles that don't amount to much. Like another review here mentioned, the deaf girl was by far the best and most interesting character. When your watching a movie about the birth of the CIA, you expect a little action, especially in a three hour film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>This is an essential film to understand where the world stands and where it is going in the present period. De Niro signs here a severe and ruthless denunciation of the methods of the US government in the world since they started the CIA at the end of the 30s. A young man, the son of a dead-by-suicide officer of some sort, is recruited by the FBI to find out the identities of the members of a fascist group that is in fact in the hand of an American agent unknown of the FBI. He will then become an essential agent in London during the war and in Berlin after the world, covered as a commercial agent, and it is trade and nothing else, to exchange some fascist scientists who are not too important for the Jewish scientists the Soviets are getting rid of. This will lead the main character who is the head of the office in Berlin to recruit a KGB agent into his service. What is very strange is that the CIA does not find out this agent is being recruited under the name of another KGB agent (the CIA was un-informed on the subject which means they did not cover the whole world and had weak points, just like the Soviet should not have used the name of another KGB agent) and it is done with the complicity of an English agent. This man will become the mole in the CIA when Cuba becomes communist and when the US tries to organize the re-conquest in the Bay of Pigs. The failure is so enormous that they decide that there must have been a mole. And they start looking for it. The Soviet then start playing cat and mouse with the main character and manage to compromise his son in the business by making him fall in love with a woman in Africa, or at least have a sudden desire for the woman that turns into love but this woman is one of their agents. That titillates the man and he really digs out what he can dig out and finds out the real mole by some simple action: to check a book that was offered to that mole by some English agent when he was finally recruited by the CIA. That book should have been checked and was not. Negligence and non-professionalism. And this ex-KGB agent is never the object of the slightest doubt even when another KGB agent arrives and pretends he is the man carrying the name the ex-KGB agent has been recruited under. It is the son who will pay, and pay dearly, for the amateurish caper, indirectly for sure since the woman will be eliminated. So much for love among spies. But what is left after this action is finished, a tremendous action with numerous intertwined though clearly identified flashbacks over the whole period from the 1920s to the mid 1960s? First that this CIA was born in super-patriotic and super-nationalist secret groups in the US, groups that ignore democracy and in a way human dignity, since the new members have to go through a fight in the nude, in mud and with the older members eventually pissing on them. These circles and groups are dangerous. What's more they are so closed up onto themselves that they lose somewhere the necessary objectivity and a negligence becomes possible and a double agent can infiltrate the whole system. The second lesson is that this CIA is supposed to reshape the world in conformity with what the US wants. This is also very dangerous, and there the film is totally idealistic: the CIA can do what they want they can only slow down change in the world, not reverse it, Latin America being the best case ever. It has never been so nearly unanimously on the left, dark and deep pink if not completely red, and only as a reaction to the US's use of the CIA to manipulate people. These agents are also extremely inhuman. They have to forget all links with family, friends, relatives, or any acquaintances. They must be ready to betray all these in the name of their mission and purity and kill every time it is necessary. They are kept under constant surveillance either by the other side or by people on the US side that no one knows. The film finally gives you one example of the El Ghraib torturing methods and that really makes you shudder and shiver. And the tragic end will be all the more pathetic when we know the victim was right and telling the truth. A film you must see absolutely.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine & University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne</p></br><a href="../users/A1JVSIWDF0WT22.html">A1JVSIWDF0WT22</a><br/><p>Long and boring movie full of un-appealling roles for its stars. Some people have praised Matt Damon's performance but the fact his he uses the exact same expression for the three hours this thing lasts. His aging makeup (as well as Jolie's) is just plain ridiculous (does anybody really believe that's how they will look in their '50s) and his son looks just about the same age as him.<br />With apologies for the comparison but a week ago I saw the un-ambitious and inconsequential "Music and Lyrics", that is a film that aims low and achieves what it sets to do. This one aims high and totally fails. Personally I'd rather watch the first type.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>As curious as I was about this movie it had me dazed. The 'Good Shepherd' always struck me symbol for Christianity. Shepherds look after their flocks so the sheep can be killed and eaten. What's good about that? Fortunately, sheep don't have the intelligence to be paranoid. With Bourne Identity movies under his belt, Matt Damon has a good pedigree to play spy movies. Is this one a killer or dead on arrival? With a budget of $85m, we've got Oscar-winning actors, writers, cinematographers, and more stars than flocks by night ever get to see. Pet project of actor-turning-director, Robert De Niro, "The Good Shepherd" tells a story of the CIA from its early days, weighing in at just under three hours. The scene before the opening credits is the one which the whole movie revolves around once that's miss you won't get it. This is a shame, because it's a tantalisingly mysterious and artistically shot.<br /><br />This movie is told from Damon's point of view, its scope is epic, and covering the years from 1939 before the CIA was even a speck in President Truman's eye, to 1961 and the Bay of Pigs. We see the founding years, the London Blitz, post-war reconstruction in Berlin, and increasingly intricate machinations as the Cold War gathers pace. Angelina Jolie doesn't feature in much of the movie, but when she does, she' get into character very well. It's enough to make you wish she would put down her excellent humanitarian work long enough to take on more of the challenging parts for which is so eminently capable.<br /><br />Robert de Niro (got to love him), in the director's chair, is sadly the weakest link. Although he handles it professionally, almost magisterially, he lacks the experience to slowly build momentum, convey gradual moral decay, or make this the Godfather standard-bearer of CIA films. He's done a fine job - just bitten off a bit more than he can chew. What he deserves credit for is attempting a classic depiction of one of the world's most important institutions and pulling it off with considerable dignity; if not quite the artistic flourish that he would have aspired to, given that his mentors are people like Francis Ford Coppola (who is the executive producer). With sufficient dedication, it is easy to imagine De Niro pulling off an Oscar for direction in a future film: his grasp is very broad, and all it needs is a little tweaking.</p></br><a href="../users/A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ.html">A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ</a><br/><p>This movie was called, the Godfather of Spy movies and a thriller. I question both. First of all, the only thing it had in common with the Godfather is that three people got wacked, DeNiro was in it and it was really long at 2 hours and 47 minutes. Oh, and it has Joe Pesci in it too, who has been known to cohoot with the mobster types.<br /><br />Thriller? There was absolutely nothing thrilling about it. In fact, it was very slow and tedious. It starts off interesting, showing how Edward Wilson (Matt Damon) was recruited and indoctrinated into the world of spying and the elite secret group "the Skull & Bones". It also has an interesting Love story between Wilson, Clover (Angelina Jolie) & a shy deaf girl named Laura (Tammy Blanchard).<br /><br />The problem with the film is that it didn't need to be nearly 3 hours long. It really didn't. The movie had no elements of intrigue or hook. It was just a series of events that showed how the life of a spy slowly and systematically destroyed a good man.<br /><br />The film is well filmed and well acted, I'm not knocking these elements of the film. It was just boring.<br /><br />To make a long story short, which DeNiro (who directed the film) should have done, the movie could have been shortened dramatically. After about an hour and forty minutes of the film, I found myself hitting the fast forward button and fully understanding everything that was speeding past my eyes.<br /><br />There's nothing wrong with long movies, but you better have something that keeps your interest. Had I gone to see this at the movie theatre, I would have slept or left. Seriously.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B3Z2QHW3V35S.html">A2B3Z2QHW3V35S</a><br/><p>I tried watching this movie and I was lost. I also think that Angelina Joline wasn't made for that part.

Honey, get the popcorn!<br /><br />At least that's how it should have gone. Unfortunately the recent '06 film `The Good Shepherd' falls far short of my pre-viewing expectations. It is exceedingly slow, too long and the farthest thing from being a thriller than one could imagine. Damon sleep walks through this 2 hour, 48 minute snooze fest and Angelina is delegated to the role of a long suffering ignored housewife (as if that could happen).<br /><br />Alas, it could have been great.

The sad history of the CIA and the destructive impact of misguided patriotism on personal relationships are depressing enough as it is without the lugubrious pacing director De Niro insists on giving them here. There are one or two great scenes, but you might easily sleep through them. Matt Damon is surprisingly bland in a weird, one-note performance that lacks any capacity to evoke empathy, and is completely at odds with the character arc the film apparently tries to trace. This probably accounts, in large part, for why so many have found this film unengaging. It's a shame, because the story it tells is an important one.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PNTEDGMOLMOY.html">A2PNTEDGMOLMOY</a><br/><p>I tried my hardest to fall in love with Robert De Niro's "The Good Shepherd."  All the elements were there for a great film - fantastic material (the birth of the CIA and the Cold War), great cast, and more-than-ample budget.  Unfortunately, the total is far less than the sum of its parts - and far more tedious.<br /><br />Matt Damon plays Edward Wilson, privileged Yale undergraduate who gets inducted into America's least-secret secret society, Skull and Bones.  Given this access to privilege, Wilson receives a unique opportunity - to get in on the ground floor of America's new secret service, the OSS (the forerunner of the CIA).  Over the next few decades, Wilson will play a key part in the evolution of the Cold War.<br /><br />This should be exciting stuff.  Terrific authors have had loads of fun with the very same material - John Le Carre, Robert Littell, James Ellroy - and their novels are riveting page-turners.  Thanks in large part to Damon's depiction of Wilson as an extremely cold fish, "The Good Shepherd" is largely an exercise in exposition and tedium.  Events transpire, characters grow old or die young, and bitterness and recrimination stalk the land.  Sometimes that works in a movie - this is not such an occasion.<br /><br />Put "The Good Shepherd" on the shelf with the Great Missed Opportunities of recent years - movies that should have been terrific and yet failed to live up to expectations.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NYQCLFQRTI74.html">A2NYQCLFQRTI74</a><br/><p>How truthful is this film... no one will ever know.<br />How can anyone know anything about a company (CIA) that (supposedly) deals with lies... again, no one will ever know.<br />Important issues are presented here: imperialism, espionage, loyalty, betrayal...<br /><br />This film was certainly worth watching, for Matt Damon's performance (as Edward Wilson) especially. He and *he alone* carries the film on his shoulders.<br />A surprise: De Niro shows a better talent as a director than an actor.<br />Angelina Jolie, as Wilson's wife, overacts way too much and her character is not credible because not well developed. Tammy Blanchard (who plays Laura) definitely has more talent than Jolie.<br /><br />The melodramatic dialogue didn't help the movie, however well directed it may have been.<br /><br />Recommendation to watch _The Good Shepherd_: Pay attention to the dates, as it is rather easy to get lost in the second act, where Russian spies and the Bay of Pigs invasion are mentioned.<br />Better editing and script-writing would have made the film shorter (close to 3 hours!), as many of those details were not needed to understand what was going on.<br /><br />Certainly worth watching, but be prepared to endure three hours of film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1S8AJIUIO6M9K.html">A1S8AJIUIO6M9K</a><br/><p>Top names cannot overcome this kludge of a movie, which loses one star for kludge and one star for not remotely honoring what the original OSS and the CIA clandestine service really do.  In fact, as a former spy who spent three touirs overseas including one chasing terrorists, this movie, while artsy and compelling in its mash-up of 50 years of mis-adventure, is very disappointing.  They would have been better off sticking to Mr. and Mrs. Smith, which I enjoyed very much as a parody.<br /><br />Until the 1980's, the chief characteristics of the Directorate of Operations of which I was a part, were alcoholism, adultery, divorce, and suicide.  I count 18 suicides in my professional career, beginning with the instructor at the Farm that blew his brains out with a shot-gun, and more recently the Staff Director of the House Permanent Select Committee of Intelligence, and a much admired SES (flag) officer who tried to drum the "Langley Strangler" out of the agency.  Now that's a movie I would be glad to help make.  Today we simply have too many puppies and dilitantes.<br /><br />There is one good aspect: the whole concept of not trusting anyone.  There is another good aspect: enemy opposites can be friends.  Indeed, I have found over the years that I like and trust my KGB and GRU counterparts more than I trust the drones in our own FBI (Agents IC Smith and Crowley excepted).<br /><br />A sideline highlight was the depiction of the Yale fraternity Skull and Bones, to which both George Bush Junior and John Kerry belong.  The overtones of homosexuality, men mud-wrestling naked, men in drag, is consistent with the public information undertones about some of its members.<br /><br />The bad aspect is that this movie tries to represent 50 years of history including all the apects of James Angleton, Kim Philby, and so on, but it is a fantasy, a poor parody.  You would be much better off reading my lists of intelligence and counterintelligence books.  Recruiting people to be traitors, stealing diplomatic pouches, installing audio devices, managing covert action operations are all more interesting.<br /><br />The entire theme of trying to interpret a video to identify the fan, the sounds, the voices, etc is over-hyped garbage, even with the revelation that the witness knows the video is of himself not so long ago.  CIA throws money in the air, and whoever reaches for it is recruited as an agent.  Let me be very specific: CIA is a global laughingstock, and does nothing for the Nation that is worth its cost.  It consists of too many young white males, and no amount of diversity hiring is going to change the basic fact that working out of official installations, and unilaterally (or worse, relying on foreign liaison headquarters for second-hand lies) is going to turn CIA into a mature clandestine and analytic service.<br /><br />The coldness of the business, and the distance between father and son, between husband and wife, is dated.  That is how it was up to the 1970's.  After that, wives were a part of the team and not only fully briefed, but used operationally on occasikon.  Children generally are briefed when they reach their low teens.<br /><br />Bottom line: this is a melange that melanges a bit too much.  Great stars, interesting script, for a real look at the old CIA, see Allen Dulles, "The Craft of Intelligence", and Miles Copeland, "Without Cloak or Dagger".  For the lies and politicization, see George Allen, "None So Blind" or Hiam's "Who the Hell are we Fighting."

Just exactly how much money Larry King was paid to review this stinker hghly is unknown. What should be known is that DeNiro laid an egg here, a really rotten one. Local hero Matt Damon  pays the ultiimate price-totally miscast as the CIA rising star,who's ascent adversely affects his demeanor,marriage and family.How many trillion men in history could say/have said the same thing? The entire "production" is entirely too long, tedious,boring. And, again, it's becoming obvious to this reviewer that if Damon is playing a role that seems to be a part of himself-see "Rounders", "Good Will Hunting", the "Bourne" series etc,-then he's very good. Otherwise, he's typically as useful as Wally Cox would have been playing "Patton"! One positive point: the movie IS marginally better than "Ski Party".</p></br><a href="../users/A32XW50ILWOXNO.html">A32XW50ILWOXNO</a><br/><p>"The Good Shepherd" is a stunning bore, a three-hour dud chronicling the creation of the Central Intelligence Agency. Like its main character, the movie insists on marching through the story with a blank-faced, downward-cast look toward the ground. Maybe it succeeds as history. But it fails, utterly, as entertainment.<br /><br />In a committed and thus dull performance, Matt Damon is Edward Wilson, a wonkish Yale grad who's recruited into the CIA by a paralytic general (Robert DeNiro) and a smarmy power broker (William Hurt) to run counterintelligence; that is, infiltrate the communists. The CIA and Russian KGB spent a lot of lives moving them around their global chessboards; Wilson, a secretive, opaque soul, is a perfect fit.<br /><br />Eric Roth's screenplay starts with the Bay of Pigs debacle, as Wilson tries to find the leak that doomed the 1961 mission, and works in flashback to 1939, when Wilson is forced to ditch his deaf sweetheart (Tammy Blanchard) to marry the pregnant Clover (Angelina Jolie), the sister of a classmate. Jolie is ludicrous, all sex, tears, aggression and jeers - the long-suffering wife trapped in a Bette Davis melodrama.<br /><br />DeNiro also directs, pushing the gas on that musical score and dividing the action into inert two-minute chunks. His camera won't linger or deepen our experience, chained, as it is, to Roth's dense, I-did-my-homework screenplay. DeNiro assembled gifted players - Hurt, John Turturro, Michael Gambon, Billy Crudup, Alec Baldwin, Joe Pesci - and gave them very little motivation. It shows.<br /><br />Roth and DeNiro seem bent on demystifying the CIA and debunking James Bond, Tom Clancy, John Le Carre, "Casablanca" and just about every other artistic foray into the field. Fine. But don't stuff Jolie in there and have us expect credulity. Better yet, watch "Munich" on a loop and see how it's done.</p></br><a href="../users/A1OBPHRXHZF8P6.html">A1OBPHRXHZF8P6</a><br/><p>It is easy to believe that rise of the Central Intelligence Agency--and the political-personal toll which such a process consequently exerted on its founders simply might invoke 'James Bond in the swing era' for a screenplay.<br /><br />With the war in Iraq and question's about our own government's accountability (not to mention their family ties to Yale and Skull and Bones) this film definitely is atypical and thus much more somber holiday fare. It raises so many serious and ultimately disturbing questions about America's past--and by extension---current foreign policy objectives.<br /><br />This story focuses on the partially-fictionalized Edward Wilson (Matt Damon), a founder of what ultimately is now known as the Central Intelligence Agency. Wilson's initial innocence and idealism is tried over the course of those pivotal years.<br /><br />Recruited to join the Office of Strategic Services during World War II, Wilson earns performance kudos at the expense of ultimately loosing what made himself 'him'; humanity. The constant state of paranoia which he is required to operate under finally eats away at both him and his family life.<br /><br />Wilson's real life counterparts James Jesus Angelton (a long-serving CIA director) and Richard Bissell (a covert operations specialist) provided inspiration for this film. Angelton also ultimately became engulfed by the very 'national security' system which he had long-term involvement with.<br /><br />The scripting and directing of this film easily maintained a 'suspense' environment without resorting to flashy special effects. Wilson and his colleagues are not 'bad' people per say, but they are living on the edges of both American and International society by virtue of having creating gray areas which cannot be disclosed to others out of 'necessity'.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>Robert DeNiro is considered by many to be one of the finest actors working in film. Naturally, after playing the number of diverse, challenging roles he has brought to the big screen, he is looking for new challenges. As someone working in film, one of those challenges is directing. Rather than play it safe, DeNiro takes on the complex tale of the birth of the CIA in "The Good Shepherd".<br /><br />April, 1961. The Bay of Pigs is a disaster and Edward Wilson (Matt Damon) returns to Washington, DC as President Kennedy prepares to do some damage control and avert World War III. As he contemplates how the leak may have occurred, he begins to think back to his college days at Yale. Recruited into the secret Skull & Bones society, Edward soon becomes a full fledged member, trying to remain loyal to his fraternity brothers. At one of the society's retreats, he meets Clover (Angelina Jolie), the sister of his friend, John Russell (Gabriel Macht), the son of a Senator (Keir Dullea), who are also members of the society. Clover throws herself at Edward and a couple of weeks later, she announces she is pregnant and she and Edward are soon married. As World War II looms, Edward is approached by General Sullivan (Robert DeNiro), who wants a select group of men to travel to Europe to perform counter intelligence. After they return, Edward meets his son and the counter intelligence operations continue, becoming the basis of the Central Intelligence Agency, under the direction of Phillip Allen (William Hurt). Throughout his life, Edward faces challenges to his family life, patriotism and loyalty.<br /><br />"The Good Shepherd" is a difficult thing to discuss. At over 2 hours and 45 minutes, the film covers a lot of territory and presents a lot of detail and both director DeNiro and writer Eric Roth ("Munich", "Ali", "The Insider", "Forrest Gump") have done a great job of keeping all of this information accessible and easy to follow. You never feel as though you are drowning in story, details or characters, and there are many I didn't even mention.<br /><br />Matt Damon's performance as Edward is interesting. Extremely modulated, he almost never changes the tone of his voice. This does two things; on the one hand, it perfectly conveys his constant unease with his role in society and what he does but on the other hand, it makes his performance slightly boring. You want Damon to speak up, yell, cry, and do something other than stare impassively at someone else. I get that he is playing a spy, and is supposed to remain very aloof, but he is also playing a human. The few times he does yell or shout light up the screen and show us the potential of this character. I understand why it didn't happen more, but if it had, the character would have gone from just good to near great.<br /><br />Anjelina Jolie plays Clover, or Margaret, the precocious daughter of a US Senator (Keir Dullea). From the moment we first meet her, she throws herself at Edward in a determined effort to snare him. As the story evolves, they are soon married and Edward is off to War, leaving her to give birth to their son alone. Later in the film, she complains about being left alone, about how he never loved her, etc. Her role resembles the old fashioned `vamp' type of role. I recently saw some `Pre Code' films made by Hollywood in the early 30s. In these films, Barbara Stanwyck, Jean Harlow and the like, play `upwardly mobile' women determined to sleep their way to the top. In "The Good Shepherd", Jolie's Margaret seems determined to mate with Edward. If this is, in fact, the case, we never really learn why.<br /><br />The film is filled with a veritable who's who of memorable character actors. Michael Gambon plays one of Edward's Yale professors, who may have a thing for young men. Alec Baldwin plays Sam Murach, a member of the FBI who initially approaches Edward with an assignment. Billy Crudup plays Arch Cummings, a British spy who helps train Edward. William Hurt plays Phillip Allen, the man who helps found the CIA and guide the organization in its first few years. Timothy Hutton, Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci and John Turtorro also pop up as various pieces of the puzzle. Some of these supporting characters are more involving and more interesting than others; Gambon stands out as an integral part of the story. As a poetry professor, guiding Edward in his thesis, he makes a pass at Edward who rejects. But this professor plays an important part in the overall story and finding out how he fits in is part of the fun. Alec Baldwin pops up repeatedly as sort of a guardian angel for Edward, guiding him towards the truth. John Turturro plays Edward's assistant, working with him through the decades as they work through one crisis after another. Other characters pop up briefly and then disappear. Joe Pesci plays a gangster ousted from Cuba when Castro takes over. Edward turns to him for help and guidance before the Bay of Pigs operation. The role is interesting, but way too brief and more of a distraction than anything. Oh, look. It's Joe Pesci.<br /><br />"The Good Shepherd" works best when it concentrates on the mechanics of the story, showing us how this agency was created, some of the activities it participated in, the like. From the moment Edward enters Yale, he seems destined to follow in his father's footsteps and become a member of the super secretive "Skull and Bones" society. We watch as Edward participates in the initiation and then his first interaction with Murach (Baldwin), in 1939. Murach wants him to give him a list of people who may be Nazi sympathizers. Edward's patriotism is never at question, so he does what he needs to do. Then, General Sullivan (DeNiro), also a member of "Skull and Bones", asks him to do counter intelligence work in London during World War II. There, he works with Cummings (Crudup) and others to learn about their methods and provide any help he can. Here, he begins a long and trusting relationship with his assistant (Turturro). Upon his return home, Sullivan asks him to continue the work with the new CIA, which will be headed by another member of "Skull and Bones", Philip Allen (Hurt). The film goes to great lengths to successfully show us the wheeling - dealing that went on behind the scenes during the formation of this agency.<br /><br />Then the story shifts and we start to watch some of the operations they were involved in. These are presented as vignettes, of a sort, and they all lead to Castro and the Bay of Pigs. DeNiro and Roth use these events to illustrate the long term problems the CIA and other agencies of its type create for themselves and us. As the CIA becomes more involved in foreign governments, they sometimes make the wrong decisions, which proves troublesome to our country at later points.<br /><br />The last act of the film, which details the Bay of Pigs operation and the resulting fiasco it creates, also involves Edward and Margaret's son, Edward Junior (Eddie Redmayne Jr.), now a young man who is also a part of the CIA. Throughout the film, as Edward steps back into the lives of his wife and son, we watch the boy grow up, insecure, always looking for his father's approval. As a member of the CIA, he is no different. This part of the story was the least successful simply because I found the performance by Redmayne to be fairly one note as well. In one scene, his expression is blank. In the next, he is mad at his dad. In another, another argument. In yet another, the blank expression returns. It is also difficult to believe Damon and Jolie's characters would father a grown son as they look pretty much the same throughout. The one concession to age seems to be a little bit of powder on Jolie's face and she appears to be tired. But they don't really age so it is startling to watch this character grow up as they stay relatively the same age.<br /><br />DeNiro is clearly a talented director, and he is working with a story he has a great deal of interest in. It is also nice to see a film depict such a secretive organization `warts and all'. What the film shows doesn't appear to be sugar coated; we see the good and the bad. And that's a good thing. But as an actor, it seems like he would be able to realize the majority of the performances in the film are lifeless and cold. The most emotional characters are either the least mature, or the most harassed, as two Russian spies turn on the emotions as they plea for their life.<br /><br />"The Good Shepherd" is worth your time, and it will take a lot of it, but it will be stingy in the rewards. You will learn a lot about the operations, but little about the people behind the early days of the Central Intelligence Agency.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TPW86OHXTXFC.html">A1TPW86OHXTXFC</a><br/><p>"Secrets are the ultimate commodity in espionage, the currency that buys information and favor and ideally provides national security. Secrets also foster a pathological distrust that can turn their keepers and traders into hollow shells." Chris Voynar<br /><br />Matt Damon, plays Edward Wilson, and he becomes the man with no life. His character is based on longtime CIA counterintelligence honcho James Jesus Angleton.  He has little emotion, is suspicious and loyal. He shows us his life from the 'Skulls and Bones' of Yale to The Bay of Pigs and World War II.  The movie, directed by Robert De Niro, shifts from one era to another, and pulls us in to the story. This movie requires alot of attention. I spent alot of time tgrying to discover what clue went with what scene. The film is supberb because of the acting.<br /><br />"A lot of questions: was Soviet power overstated to justify the CIA's existence? Can information gleaned through torture be trusted? And, most pertinent of all: What is the personal price of a life ruled by silence and disinformation? The Good Shepherd doesn't address these issues with Oliver Stone-style accusation of conspiracy. It coolly enlists them in the service of an ambitious story that deftly maneuvers visual clues and character motives. Short on gunplay, its thrills are covert, subtle, even a little sneaky, much like Edward Wilson, the quiet warrior who can't afford to open up." Chris Voynar<br /><br />The CIA as we all guess is shadowy and secretive. Anyone who becomes a part of 'The Company' gives up most of their life. This film shows a small piece of one life, and the drudgery and repetitive issues that crop up time and time again.<br /><br /> Recommended.  prisrob  4-7-07<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M5AJQS">The Departed (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>DVD<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305216088">Good Will Hunting (Miramax Collector's Series)</a>DVD<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00023B1LC">The Bourne Identity (Widescreen Extended Edition)</a>DVD</p></br><a href="../users/A2RW7HXNEJ0QTQ.html">A2RW7HXNEJ0QTQ</a><br/><p>This movie is slow ...

I went into the film expecting a slow paced historical restrospective of the movie.  Althought that is what I received, for the most part, the difficult aspect of the movie was the feeling that the fine actors were aloof.  I had trouble connecting with some of the characters, especially the main leads.  Matt Damon did an excellent job, and I imagine he was directed in such a way as to seem a bit ambiguous.  Jolie's character could have been much richer; however, I think the complicated plot took such a long time to tell, that character development took a backseat.  To put this movie in terms of a novel, this would be a LeCarre vs. a Ludlum.  Do not go into this movie expecting a thrill a minute ala a Ludlum novel, rather expect a meandering complicated story ala LeCarre's Absolute friends.<br /><br />I have noted some very well-written reviews regarding this movie.  I agree with several of the reviewers.  However, I would argue with anyone who lables this a bad or terrible movie.  It is certainly not in my opinion.  This is a solid four star movie that falls short of a higher rating due to the inaccessibility of the characters.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NSUJJCG73IRF.html">A1NSUJJCG73IRF</a><br/><p>Director:  Robert De Niro<br /><br />Cast:  Matt Damon, Angelina Jolie, Alec Baldwin, Tammy Blanchard, Billy Crudup, Robert De Niro, Keir Dullea, Michael Gamdon, William Hurt, Timothy Dutton.<br /><br />Running Time:  167 minutes<br /><br />Rated R violence, some sexuality, and language.<br /><br />A gray winter day was a fitting time to see one of the first public screenings of a film called "The Good Shepherd," whose chilly hero Edward Wilson (Matt Damon, in a role modeled in part on CIA founder, James Jesus Angleton) is not so much all things to all men as nobody to anybody. A composite figure in a portrait of the birth, rise, and moral shriveling of the American CIA, Matt Damon's disturbingly shut-down Wilson would be one of recent film's most tragic figures if he were not such a hollow, unappealing man. Directing a long-contemplated project using a screenplay by Eric Roth (who penned "Munich"), Robert De Niro has forged a "Godfather" of Yankee spy-craft, a heavy, solemn epic about betrayal and loyalty in the world of espionage and counter-espionage dominated not by Italians as in the original "Godfather," though Coppola produced, De Niro directed, and Joe Pesci has one of the liveliest on screen moments, but by uptight, stony, patrician WASPs.  Indeed as seen here the world of American intelligence is a privileged and exclusive and deeply conflicted one where Irish, blacks, and Italians need not apply; fathers are absent; privilege grows out of Skull and Bones at Yale, wives are betrayed; sons labor desperately to measure up, and the leading practitioners are ridden with guilt and suspicion. There is no one to trust and nothing to believe in - not family or tradition, or even music - only America, which Edward Wilson says belongs to his class. All others are just visiting.<br /><br />Into this demoralizing story, damning in its picture of the world of white privilege and of intelligence itself but nonetheless intricately involving and at times genuinely disturbing, are woven some of the major incidents and personalities of the period from from before the Second World War - after which OSS morphed into CIA-- till after the failure of the Bay of Pigs invasion under JFK, from hot war to cold war. You have Philbys and fake Russian turncoats, CIA execs siphoning off money to Switzerland in guise of chocolate boxes, and through it all you have a Cuba mole investigation that smashes Wilson's own family.  Wilson's true penchant was for a deaf girl named Laura (an excellent Tammy Blanchard); and with her is the only time Damon seems to develop human warmth. He is forced to marry the more elevated Margaret Russell (an uncomfortable Angelina Jolie) sister of one of his Skull and Bones colleagues who remains Wilson's Old Boy link to privilege ever after. Traumatic embarrassment, revelation of closest held secrets, and doubt of loyalty are seen as inborn elements of the espionage world. The very qualities that make a good spy, as seen here, also make a man untrustworthy.<br /><br />Do spies ever have fun? Not much, as seen from the angle of Damon's character. Dr. Fredericks (Michael Gambon), a randy gay pseudo-intellectual who turns and turns again, is naughty, but he pays for it. Another Brit, Arch Cummings, played gamely by Billy Crudup, similarly wears a smile that turns to dust. A good professional of the lower ranks like Staff Sergeant Brocco (John Turturro), Wilson's OSS assistant in England, is a stern sadist whose use of LSD for an interrogation backfires fatally. Nasty sabotages are devised to spoil the left's Latin American agricultural schemes. Big foul-ups like the Bay of Pigs invasion lead to vicious internal purges. And through it all Wilson's son cringes and his wife pines; the marriage had dried up after his six-year absence during WWII; and his imploded selfhood is symbolized by his only hobby, building ships inside bottles. As the film bluntly puts it, the spy-master must choose either family or country; he can't have both. And is it all worth it? The Russian on LSD declares his country's armed might a myth perpetuated by America to justify its ongoing pursuit of world dominance. Is intelligence a needed quantity, or are its organizations self-perpetuating shams? The movie never gives a positive answer. This may be the cruelest picture of the spy game ever put on film.  Many fine actors play small unappealing roles as spy-masters or cold operatives. These include De Niro himself, Alec Baldwin, and William Hurt, all creditable, but unlikely to get Oscar nods for their tightly held back performances. Damon can be accused of the same limitation, though if his Wilson bothers you, he's done his job better than you may think. And young Eddie Redmayne, as Wilson's grown son, has one of the most gut-wrenching roles in a story notable for its devastating picture of the effects of career on family life.  Despite its epic scale and length (it's 160 minutes long), "The Good Shepherd" is more troubling than flashy, more thought-provoking than moving. Ultimately it may be somewhat an artistic failure. The criticism that it is either too long or too short, that it needed to be pared down or expanded to a mini-series, has some merit. But nonetheless as a work that considers big issues and asks big questions, it's one of the more serious and intellectually stimulating mainstream American films of the year.</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>"The Good Shepard" is a slow paced film that really surprised me because its countless images filled of semiotic profile. It's about a devoted functionary of the CIA in those hard times from the first days of the WW2 until the not so well reminded and frustrated invasion of the marines in Cuba.<br /><br />The use of greyish lights (Please remember Sidney Lumet's The verdict)  is transcendental around practically every single frame of the movie, the faces are involved into a diffuse atmosphere, as the truth they keep is. On the other hand we will assist to the progressive and unstoppable crumbling of the marriage of this efficient agent, who sees what's going on around his personal life, and is incapable to make nothing to avoid it.<br /><br />William Hurt, Angelina Jolie, John Tuturro and Matt Damon are stunning every one of them, from their perspectives, make of this personal film of Robert de Niro appears as one of the most intriguing and devastating films in years around the times in which the C.I.A. was best known as the O.S.S.<br /><br />One of the top films of the year.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R8PXSFGY9MC2.html">A3R8PXSFGY9MC2</a><br/><p>'The Good Shepherd' is one of those films that could have offered so much more, and sadly didn't. The cast was good, the direction was good, the story was good and yet nothing seemed to gel and you're left feeling strangely dissatisfied with everything. The story is very slow paced and although I can normally enjoy films of this type, I found this to be quite a laboured affair. Set against the backdrop of WW2 and the bay of pigs fiasco this story has some great historical touches and added some authenticity to the plot-line. I found it very strange how Matt Damon and Angelina Jolie seemed to age very little as the film progressed, especially with Damon looking the same at the start as at the end which is supposed to be 22 years later! At least they gave Jolie bags under her eyes, but that was about it. There were some excellent cameo appearances from the likes of Joe Pesci and the few scenes with De Niro were very good. Overall, if you like espionage type films, but without the thrills and action, then this is the film for you, otherwise you can safely give this a miss and not worry in the slightest.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TKM36EYEQNSM.html">A1TKM36EYEQNSM</a><br/><p>With a very slow moving story, we are brought through the beginnings of what some may view of how the CIA developed in the first few decades.  Matt Damon does an excellent job portraying a very quiet, somewhat cold hearted man who gets recruited by the CIA while studying at Yale.<br /><br />We have a number of flashbacks and forwards that you must keep an eye on to make sure you know where you are.  Interestingly developed as a story, you see one man's life influenced by what he does for the company.  Although a very interesting story, there are messages you see in the movie.  One is a scene where someone is wearing one of the infamous hoods from the Abu Gharib tortures, this is supposed to be 1959 or 1960, so, the message here is that this type of thing has been common since then.<br /><br />Interesting things include the development of the character played by Damon through the beginnings with WWII and the relationship with the spy networks in England.<br /><br />The play of Damon and his colleagues, the intrigue, the distrust and the final culmination of his work.

It's a noble endeavor, at times wonderfully shot - however, it is ultimately too flawed to succeed as entertainment.<br />The story revolves around the creation of the CIA, seen through the eyes of Edward Wilson (a composite of several real life characters).  It plays as a character driven story showing what can make a man choose a life of permanent paranoia and secrecy, and the impact that has on his life.  In this way the atmosphere around the time of the new Agency's genesis is portrayed rather than a strict blow by blow account of how it came to be.  A superb and committed cast have been gathered, (including a blink and you'll miss it cameo from Joe Pesci), and there is a clear feeling of the proceedings oozing talent, from art direction and photography, through to actors and music.<br />However, there is something about the pacing that is not quite right - at 160 minutes, we should have some significant moments of drama to drive our interest on, but somehow we are left with a spy story of non-people and non-events... a spy movie without suspense.  There's an interesting enough story arc for our main character, and the audience is asked to be intelligent enough to fill in some gaps - but the padding has turned what could have been an atmospheric and informative movie into something bloated and dull.  This is no epic or definitive account.<br />Regular readers of mine will know I am no huge fan of rapid fire MTV style editing a la `Armageddon' and its ilk - but a movie still has to have some drive and entertainment value.  That's missing here, despite the core having some very interesting things to say about the disease of loneliness and what it does to a man.  Sad to say, no endorsement from me on this one, even though it has moments that really make me want to like it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NM0RAYSL6PA8.html">A3NM0RAYSL6PA8</a><br/><p>The Good Shepherd has a quiet intelligence about it, making subtle and interesting points about the human condition -- about trust, sexuality, intimacy, and rationalization. To be sure, it has it's flaws. It's a bit on the long side -- it could lose half an hour and be a better film for it. Although Matt Damon's performance is unusually understated and his character only marginally sympathetic, it's a riveting turn nonetheless. He's one of those smart, quiet "clerks" whose emotions lie buried and whose ruthless intelligence makes him capable of just about everything except meaningful human relationships.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>I wasn't expecting a whole lot from this film, mainly because it received such a cold shoulder from critics and awards bodies alike, despite the fact that it has such a high pedigree and the subject matter is beyond baity.  Still, I wanted to see it and so I indulged my curiosity the other night to a rather surprising effect.<br /><br />I expected to be bored stiff and or unengaged and what I found was a much tighter and much more involved film than I expected.<br /><br />That isn't to say it isn't without flaws, but it certainly isn't without merit either.<br /><br />`The Good Shepherd' tells the story of one of the CIA's founding fathers, Edward Wilson.  Wilson is a sharp young man who is corralled into a very different and guarded lifestyle after being inducted into the CIA.  The timeframe of the film spans from 1939, where Wilson becomes a member of the Skull and Bones, all the way to 1961, where the Bay of Pigs plays a pivotal role in Wilson's overall development.  Taking his time to flesh out certain aspects of Wilson's life, Director Robert DeNiro (yes, THAT Robert DeNiro) allows us to come to know who this man was, even if the guarded nature of his persona makes him appear a mystery most times.  I loved the progressive nature of the film and the way that the film was so sharply edited to find a sense of tension amidst a rather cold and slow moving premise (yes, this film is void of any real action).  Still, one feels the overwhelming intensity that accompanies such a complicated lifestyle.<br /><br />To all that I admired, I would be amiss if I didn't criticize the film in parts.  For starters, Angelina Jolie is completely miscast here and truly squanders her talent.  I mean, she brings NOTHING to the table and seems completely awkward in every scene she's in.  I also found the big reveal surrounding Wilson's father to be anticlimactic and underwhelming.  I loved the angle revolving around The Bay of Pigs and Wilson's connection, and I felt that the film's finale was expertly played (if not a tad soap operatic in tone), but the emotional connection one was supposed to make between Wilson's actions and those of his father aren't as impactful as I would have wanted.<br /><br />There is a balance necessary in order to make a film's cold nature feel relatable, and little touches are needed to bring us there.  `The Good Shepherd' is far more engaging than some will suggest, but it lacks those touches to make it feel poignant to the audience.<br /><br />Still, I highly recommend seeing this; even though I understand why most won't like it.</p></br><a href="../users/AJRFZ0VZ0LD26.html">AJRFZ0VZ0LD26</a><br/><p>If there ever was a worn out spy, Matt Damon is definitely the one in his fine portrayal of Edward Wilson, CIA agent from priviledged family and Yale education.  I have not seen a character like this since John Le Carre's agent Smiley.  Edward is a quiet man, who keeps his emotions and feelings to himself. He is also damaged, since as a child, he witnessed his father's suicide.  The emotional void of having a father figure in his life, pushes him towards seemingly caring man such as his mentor at the university and eventually towards career in CIA.  Edward is pushed into a marriage to a woman (played by Angelina Jolie) he barely knows and the marriage is doomed from the start.  Their son, the bond that keeps the marriage together is also a reminder to both of them of their poor match.  As we trace Edward's career thru some of the important events of the cold war, we learn about him as a father, husband, lover and the unscrupulous secret agent.  It is difficult to imagine that sensitive young man, interested in poetry and above all loyal to the people close to him would resort to the dread of a life of a spymaster full of secrets and lies.  But then, as the film reaches its conclusion we almost get to think of him as a an on the suicide mission of his own.  He is not looking into pulling the trigger on himself, but he is walking on the tight rope, close to falling at any time.  Then again, he is so worn out and alone, that after al, he has very little to lose in this game.  Directed by Robert DeNiro with wonderful cast of actors.</p></br><a href="../users/A356RFKNIG043B.html">A356RFKNIG043B</a><br/><p>3.5 stars<br /><br />This film just bites off more than most any movie could ever chew. It should be lauded for its ambition, but it's just too slow and sprawling to really move the viewer as much as it wants to.<br /><br />Damon is good but not great, and never made me care much for his character. Same for Jolie and most everyone else. Not a great script, but I applaud the effort to inject some truth into the many CIA myths out there. The MK-Ultra scene was quite interesting. Anyone who's read some the books by ex-agents will recognize some enlightening little tid-bits; the cynicism generated by playing both sides against the middle comes through nicely.<br /><br />In the end, however, close but no cigar. The definitive Agency film has yet to be made. But then, that might be far too much truth for the kool-aid drinkers to grasp...</p></br><a href="../users/A13E0ARAXI6KJW.html">A13E0ARAXI6KJW</a><br/><p>As a filmmaker, Robert DeNiro shows the influence of his generation of great directors like Scorsese and Coppola with this epic-length 2006 film. In fact, there is a certain structural similarity to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001NBNB6">The Godfather</a> in DeNiro's careful unfolding of the time-spanning story penned by screenwriter Eric Roth. The plot focuses on a fictionalized account of the first twenty years of the CIA as seen through the experiences of one agent named Edward Wilson, an intentionally cryptic study in excessive self-control which makes him ideal for his career. Ironically, the main problem with the film is the stoic coldness of the central character for which DeNiro and Roth cannot seem to find a voice that would make the story resonate. There is little sense of a personal journey for Wilson, even though there are hints of it beginning with his father's suicide, which is used as a leitmotif throughout the story.<br /><br />Another frustration of the film is the constant time-jumping between the fallout over the failed Bay of Pigs mission in 1961 and key episodes in Wilson's earlier years. The technique doesn't make the drama any more interesting than it really is. Unfortunately there is no getting around the fact that despite the handsome production detail, the movie is a slog at 248 minutes and quite often, an amazing bore. DeNiro has assembled a can't-miss cast, including himself as a pre-CIA operative, but for the most part, they are stranded by a script consisting of coded exchanges and predictable dialogue, the latter most prevalent in the domestic scenes. Matt Damon does all he can as the poker-faced Wilson, but he is given little latitude to elicit empathy for his character.<br /><br />While she starts out with her fiery persona intact, Angelina Jolie has a progressively smaller role as Wilson's increasingly embittered wife Clover merely defined by how shut off she is from Wilson's clandestine profession. DeNiro inexplicably does not age either Damon or Jolie with any conviction over the course of the story, and there is an oddly unsettling dynamic when they are shown as the parents of a fully grown son. Better among the huge cast are William Hurt as a lifelong mentor; Tammy Blanchard as Wilson's true love, a hearing-impaired coed with whom he is reunited years later; Billy Crudup as a rather fey British counterspy; Alec Baldwin as a covert FBI agent; and John Turturro as Wilson's no-nonsense colleague. The 2007 DVD is short on extras, as it just contains seven deleted scenes of little additional interest. Unsurprisingly, the taciturn DeNiro does not offer a director's commentary here.</p></br><a href="../users/A2H22I2RWE0HOV.html">A2H22I2RWE0HOV</a><br/><p>The first thing you see when you go to buy The Good Shepherd is that it's being hailed as "The Godfather of CIA Movies."  Big boast, right?  Does it step up to the level of The Godfather as a classic movie?  Robert DeNiro directs and stars, Matt Damon, Angelin Jolie, Alec Baldwin, William Hurt and the list of supportng castmates goes on.  At two hours and forty-eight minutes it's definitely got epic written all over it.  Well...<br /><br />I look at good long movies like this: if I start to squirm in my seat, it's too long for it's own good.  If I don't even notice the extended length, it's a damn good.<br /><br />I squirmed.<br />Sorry.<br /><br />The Good Shepherd is the story of Edward Wilson, a Yale graduate and all around good guy who happens to belong the the Skull & Bones Society. Neat little upper class cult that it is,  like Frat Boys meets The Illuminati.  Creepy.  Edward witnessed his father's suicide at the age of six and actualy stole the suicide note before anyone got there.  He confesses this while lying naked in a sarcophigi surrounded by his hooded, black-cloaked Skull & Bones brethren. Okay...  Hitler is rising in Europe and even though America is still firmly out of the conflict, the OSS decides it's time to start doing things to keep the U.S. in the game without being directly involved.  The CIA is born.  Counterintelligence.  Spies.  Networks.  The whole nine yards and Edward Wilson is right there from the beginning, traveling to Europe for six years, leaving behid a wife (Jolie) he barely knows and a son yet-to-be-born.<br /><br />The human side of The Good Shepherd is interesting.  Edward fel in love with a deaf girl named Laura and had planned to be with her always, but during a little Skull & Bones reunion, he is taken into the woods by a Senator' daughter and seduced.  She gets pregnant.  He marries her.  So long Laura.  Damn.  We see the rise and fall of Edward Wilson not only as a spy, a counterintelligence agent for the newly spawned CIA, but as a human being.  His morales are tested. His allegiance, too.  His trust in others is absolutely extinguished.  He winds up having hs son's pegnant fiance thrown from an airplane on her way to their wedding because she was working for the KGB.  Nice.<br /><br />Overall, The Good Shepherd is a good movie sharing time between the year leading up to WWII and the faled CIA-sponsored rebellion against Cuba's Castro at the beginning of The Cold War.  De Niro directs masterfully and the cast is well-rounded.  But...I still squirmed and that means that something was lacking.  When you bring up a movie like The Godfather and then compare it, no matter how casually, there is bound to be problems. The Good Shepherd had too many slow spots where a good editing by De Niro might have made it better.  Still a good movie.  I would definitely watch it again, but not too soon.  It may take a while to digest it, perhaps nurtue a fondness for it. Could you spend your money more wisely?  Maybe.  But there aren't too many flick coimng out of this caliber, however, so make your choice.  You should not be too disappointed.<br /><br />Dig it.</p></br><a href="../users/A4X7FBQ5SKPI6.html">A4X7FBQ5SKPI6</a><br/><p>The good shepherd has all of the spooky appeal a film could offer.  Actors who are very well known and recognized as some of the best in the business are seen in it.  So why does this movie stink so badly?  Well what they are really trying to capitalize on is simply everyone's fascination with skull and bones.  Everyone thinks oh yeah it is a secret club with influence so it is bad, well you know most people don't know anything about it in the first place, they just see some film depict a secret meeting and turn into hordes of walking zombies, ranting and raving "Bush and Kerry were in it!" I just laugh.  The way they spied and used recon and photographs to figure stuff out is kind of neat you know, because that is how they did it back then.  The lady getting thrown out of the airplane on her way to being married was by far the most sickening and sad scene in the film.  Other than that it just plods along like a legless zombie, crawling...reaching...for something it cannot capture.  Do your research because I did and most of the supposed "facts" of this film in regards to the beginning of the CIA are not even true, which just further shows how Hollywood will bastardize anything of the truth in order to sway the masses and make some money.  They easily accomplish the former, but the latter category they may have fallen short.  Then yeah spice it up with more skull bones meetings which are really so boring and full of false pomp that it is a wonder anyone has figured out these are less deadly than the gangs of thugs that are currently residing in places like Detroit and Orange County.  DeNiro is a great actor but he really cannot save this film.  Damon is superior in this role but Brangelina is clearly distracted by something and is not very focused.  Then again was she ever a great actress or is it just her attractive figure that gets her into this movie?  This film is like some complex dream that Oliver Stone had but forgot half of it so he let some stoner write the rest of the script don't you think?  Now here is a thought if you had snakes on that plane then they would not have had time to throw that woman out of there would they?  I think I will tag this movie with Brangelina and Snakes on a plane.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TXR85WQLE32N.html">A2TXR85WQLE32N</a><br/><p>Robert DeNiro's 2006 "The Good Sheperd" is a thinly fictionalized account of the founding of the Central Intelligence Agency.  It features an array of talented actors, promising plot material, and some incredibly atmospheric cinematography.  It is also a long, dark, unhappy journey into a world so complex as to almost defy translation into a feature length film.<br /><br />The story centers around Edward Wilson, a counterintelligence officer who at the opening of the movie is investigating a security breach affecting the failed CIA-sponsored 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion.  In a series of extended flashbacks, we learn that Edward was a young, idealist Yale graduate recruited into the Office of Strategic Services at the start of the Second World War.  He learns his trade from his British counterparts, already locked into a cutthroat duel with Nazi Germany.  Edward moves on to Berlin at the close of the war to recruit former Nazis and to size up the Soviets, who will be America's postwar competition.  In particular, he meets his Soviet counterpart, a spymaster codenamed Ulysses, who will haunt his career for the next two decades.<br /><br />Edward returns to America in 1946, to a new organization that will become the CIA and to a loveless marriage with a woman he got pregnant right before the war.  His duties will involve him in CIA adventures in Guatemala and Cuba and in handling Soviet defectors.  As the movie circles back to the present, Edward traces a series of clues to the shocking source of the leak on the Bay of Pigs.  The answer will threaten his career and what remains of his family life.<br /><br />Matt Damon plays Edward Wilson as a quiet, dedicated but guarded man; he learns the hard way that no one can be trusted.  The hazards and hard moral choices of his career turn a likeable poetry-loving student into a man all but emotionally inaccessible by movie's end.  Angela Jolie puts in a anguished performance as Wilson's wife, who lives a sterile life with a man often gone and withdrawn when home.  Alec Baldwin has a nice turn as an FBI agent who works with Wilson on a number of cases.  John Turturro is superb as Wilson's long-time assistant.  Billy Crudup and William Hurt play fellow OSS and CIA colleagues.<br /><br />This movie gets a lot of things right about the espionage business.  The founders of the OSS and CIA relied on ties among Ivy League alumni as a substitute for a vetting process.  The spy and counterspy business between the US and Soviet Union did become a wilderness of mirrors.  The Edward Wilson character seems loosely based on James Angleton, the CIA counterintelligence chief who spent years looking for Soviet moles in the CIA.<br /><br />The story is extremely complex, even for those familiar with the history of the CIA.  The average viewer may be challenged to keep track of the characters and their motives.  The focus of the movie is really the effects of the spy business on its practioners; action is infrequent apart from the deaths of several agents.  This movie is likely to appeal primarily to serious fans of the spy business and the spy movie genre.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>Robert De Niro's second directorial effort "The Good Shepherd" purports to tell the story of the birth of the CIA during the heyday of the Cold War.  Based very loosely on the lives of two intelligence officers, James Jesus Angleton and Richard M. Bissell Jr., the movie is a strong but patience-demanding work that will have some members of the audience sitting up in rapt attention while others squirm restlessly in their seats.  At 168 minutes and with little real action to speak of, "The Good Shepherd" is admittedly not the easiest sell for a mass audience, relying as it does on atmosphere and dialogue - and the patient goodwill of its viewers - to get its message across.  I can easily imagine a person watching this film with one eye planted firmly on his wristwatch and the other on the theater exit.  I'm happy to report that I was not one of those people, for despite a few longueurs that occur towards the end of the movie, I found this film to be both compelling and eminently watchable for most of its duration.<br /><br />Matt Damon, who ages remarkably little throughout the 23-year time span covered by the story, plays Edward Bell Wilson, an agent specializing in the fine art of counterintelligence.  With a screenplay by Eric Roth, the movie uses as its framing device the Bay of Pigs fiasco in the spring of 1961 and the suspicion that a mole in the agency must have tipped the Cubans off as to the American government's plan of invasion.  From there we flash back to 1939 where we meet Wilson as a student at Yale recruited by the FBI to perform surveillance on a poetry professor with possible ties to the then-burgeoning Nazi Party.  From then on, the film traces the arc of Wilson's life as he gets rooked into a largely loveless marriage (if one can call having to marry Angelina Jolie being "rooked"), trains as an agent with British Intelligence and then the O.S.S., then helps to lay the groundwork for the American "peace time" organization known as the C.I.A.  The movie cuts back and forth between the two different time periods with only a few moments of confusion evident along the way.<br /><br />Wilson is probably the most button-downed, completely internalized character to hit the screen since Heath Ledger's Ennis del Mar in "Brokeback Mountain" (though the character here is not nearly as fully realized as that one was).  Wilson is a man almost totally devoid of humor and emotions - in many ways, the ideal person for the life of commitment and loneliness that spy work, by its very nature, demands.  Wilson barely cracks a smile throughout the course of the story, and he is so thoroughly absorbed in his work that he doesn't see his wife and young son for literally years at a stretch.  Wilson is surely one of the least audience-friendly of recent movie protagonists - or at least he would be if Damon did not convey the sort of puppy-dog vulnerability that actually makes us care about the character.  Despite the fact that we know he has dedicated his life to a cause that he considers worthwhile and noble, we have a hard time approving of the way he treats his wife and family.  Yet, Damon is able so show us that Wilson is not all that crazy about himself either and that he would lead a different life if only he were able to crawl out of his own skin and start all over.  But this he cannot do, so he remains locked in his fate, true to what he knows how to do and hoping for a little redemption at the end if the gods should deem him worthy of that blessing.  Damon plays his cards so close to the vest that he makes us continually re-evaluate the character without ever revealing more than we need to know about him.  Wilson may at times be taking stock of his life, but the filmmakers don't feel the need to blatantly spell all the details out for us.  It's in what's going on BEHIND those bespectacled eyes that the true drama lies.<br /><br />The movie does not shy away from the ugly realities of life as a CIA agent, showing us the cold-blooded ruthlessness and mounting paranoia that come with any life built, as this one is, on deception and distrust.<br /><br />Rather than aiming his film at the action crowd, De Niro has decided to focus on the characters and dialogue and simply hope that his audience will follow along with him.  As a director, he brings a quiet, subdued tone to the story, the better to match the persona of his main character.  In order to create a mood of contrasting emotions, cinematographer Robert Richardson uses a dull palette for the scenes set in the present, and a glowing, sepia-toned look for those set in the past.<br /><br />De Niro has assembled a veritable who's who of Hollywood's biggest and brightest to flesh out the minor roles - William Hurt, Alec Baldwin, Billy Crudup, Timothy Hutton, John Turturro, Joe Pesci, even De Niro himself - but, frankly, their parts are so limited that none truly stands out, thus clearing the way for Damon to take center stage.  Jolie has rarely looked so dreamily beautiful before, but even her screen time is too minimal for her to make more than a glancing impact on the film as a whole (it`s hard to believe any man would be as callously indifferent to the Jolie charm as Damon is here, but then, hey, that`s Hollywood).<br /><br />This is clearly Damon's film and he proves once again that acting does not need to be "theatrical" and "showy" to be effective.  His performance is the glue that holds this long, potentially unwieldy film together.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5.html">A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5</a><br/><p>The story occurs in a series of flash-forwards and flash-backs moving play by play like a chess game over many years.  If you miss a caption, you're struggling to figure out just where and when you are.  The film's an interesting bit of history, but hardly worth the thriller designation.  For the most part, it just ground on.</p></br><a href="../users/A3572FTYUQQW3P.html">A3572FTYUQQW3P</a><br/><p>This is a great film and one that I highly recommend, but it is not without flaws.  I won't rehash th plot because other reviewers have already done a much better job than I could do. But first the flaws and these are truly minor.  The costuming and set design were very well done, but Matt Damon's makeup was poor.  We watched him over a period of 30+ years and he never gained weight, turned gray, lost hair, or showed any sign of age, unlike Joilie who looked more mature at the end than she did at the beginning. The sound could have been better because some lines were muffled and in this film every line is important.  The organization of the film -- which is done in flashbacks -- could be better because it was hard to track the sequence of events but the footnotes in the corner helped, but if you miss one you are at sea as to what is going on.<br /><br />Nevertheless, this is an excellent film and Matt Damon does a good job and the story is very similar to the George Smiley Tinker Tailor Spy.  Alec Guniness is more convincing as a spymaster but the destruction of Edward Wilson is more easily observed than with George Smiley but both characters end as The Walking Dead -- hollow men, wrapped in honor but devoid of family, friends, intimacy, trust, or anything worth living for other than God and Country.<br /><br />I thought this film really brought forth the reality that our government is dominated by the Ivy League Patricians.  This has been true throughout the 20th Century and it is this "old boy" network that has created compromised politicians, led to corruption in government, and has placed the country at risk on more than one occasion.<br /><br />The movie presents a variety of moral and ethical decisions which makes this film a good one to watch and discuss with your teenage children.  Edward Wilson's march to personal destruction is determined by individual decisions -- some small -- like the sexual encounter with Clover, which had disastrous results -- and some large -- like the decision to join the OSS.  The decision to spy on his professor was an ethical one but one that characterized Edward Wilson as a man who placed country above himself.  This dedication ultimately leads him to the heart rending decision regarding his son, which leaves him compromised.  This is a film with very complex characters whose motives are deep rooted and not easily discerned during the movie itself, but become clearer on reflection.  It vividly demonstrates the corrosiveness of secrets - especially on families.<br /><br />Some of the reviewers didn't like the film because it was too slow and too long.  It has a slow pace -- but these are spies not Tom Cruise on a "Mission Impossible" more aptly titled a "Mission Improbable".  It has no car chases, bombs, babes, or any of the usual fare that appeals to the adolescent mind. This is a thinking man's movie and an exceptional one at that.  It definitely deserves the 5 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/AUM3YMZ0YRJE0.html">AUM3YMZ0YRJE0</a><br/><p>This is one of those films about which people feel very strongly, positive or negative:  it does not fit into an easy category (e.g. Bond-like action), has extraordinary nuance that speaks to very specific interests (bureaucratic power, the private life of spies, civilian control over dirty tricks, elite secret societies), and has wonderfully understated acting that hides what is going on underneath more than acts it out.  If it isn't for everyone, I found it utterly fascinating and engaging all the way through.<br /><br />The plot revolves around a group initiated into Yale's Skull & Bones club, the elite of the elite who gain connections that will benefit them for the rest of their lives after they are "chosen" and submit to bizarre rituals.  In the mid-1930s, they were white, from privileged WASP families from the NE, and naively patriotic (e.g. George HW Bush).  While fitting in, Damon's character has subtle problems:  son of a suicide who was apparently corrupt and perhaps even a traitor, deeply troubled in his relationships, and deeply secretive to protect his innermost feelings.  Taken into the OSS and married after an almost accidental sexual encounter, he grows into a master spy at the moment that his Skull & Bones "brothers" are founding the CIA.  He becomes one of their early top officials.<br /><br />The viewer enters into the spy's world view, not as dashing swashbucklers, but as the ultimate manipulators of events and opinions from bureaucratic perches in depressingly plain offices.  Their mission is to protect American security, but their activities define their purview in a far wider way than merely military.  Even the architect behind it (de Niro) has misgivings, which the younger "brothers" apparently do not.  In many ways, they begin to be corrupted by their power, which they love yet are not overt about it.  It is a wonderful study of how a professional bureaucracy evolves into ever new areas.  The violence, which underpins everything they are managing, makes only a few brief appearances, which are frighteningly realistic, subdued yet sudden.  Trusting no one, through Damon you see how it impacts their private lives.<br /><br />The Damon character, who had great potential to grow in a very different direction, becomes completely consumed by his duty and subtle lust for power as he masses evidence on his own colleagues as well.  His wife, a great beauty from a Skull & Bones family (Jolie in an unusually subtle role that matches her talents), suffers terribly from his mission-driven egotism, as does his son; they live with constant fear and dread.  In a way, he self-destructs, but at the same time he is an extraordinary achiever and, in my view, a completely believable psychological profile:  he was working to please an absent parent, was driven by his sense of class and purpose, and had extreme talent.  But all of this is revealed in ways that must be interpreted, a layer below his gloomy, dutiful surface, which is great fun if you like to let characters like this enter your imagination.<br /><br />The plot is also wonderfully complex, if somewhat confusing with all the skips in time.  It is based around the failure of the Bay of Pigs fiasco.  A seeming friend, his Soviet counterpart is seeking ways to undermine and co-opt him:  his efforts are yet another way that complicates the Damon character's life, with terrible consequences that once again are not completely spelled out.  Did he follow the route of his father?  Somewhat less?  Can you become partially corrupt?  Or did he betray the last things he held dear for the sake of his career and integrity?  There are no clear answers to these questions, but if the film has spoken to you, you formulate your own answers.  This is filmmaking, in my view, at its absolute best.<br /><br />Recommended as a masterpiece.  All the details are as delicious as they are deliberate.  The acting is first rate, understated, and rich in ambiguity.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L9MIIBI7409N.html">A1L9MIIBI7409N</a><br/><p>This is a well made film, unfortunately overlooked despite its star ensemble cast and production. Clocking in at 168 minutes, it probably would have made a better mini series.  Robert DeNiro does a great job directing this.  However the casting of Matt Damon as a man who gives his life up for the CIA was perhaps not the most inspired choice.  I agree it's hard to empathise with him, but I saw that as the limitations of Matt Damon's acting abilities.  Taciturn and not particularly expressive, Matt Damon also hardly ages much across the decades that this film spans - he's too constant and thus never progresses as a character.<br /><br />Nonetheless, the movie is engaging - even though it could have benefitted from more tension.  As it is, the DVD's deleted scenes reveal entire sequences that would've made the movie even longer.  Given the film's multiple subplots, leaving these scenes out didn't hurt.  To sum up, The Good Shepherd plays/ reads like a book, and for those confused about the plot...watch it with subtitles.  The ensemble cast makes it worthwhile - Angelina Jolie does a great job as does William Hurt, John Turturro, Alec Baldwin, and everyone else.<br /><br />DeNiro may have been trying to channel his Cold War version of the Godfather here, but this is a slow burn and Damon is no Pacino.  Still, a sterling movie and monumental effort from a screen legend.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KB1H0S7T6JX1.html">A3KB1H0S7T6JX1</a><br/><p>An excellent film, The Good Shepherd, brings to the screen the events and people that brought about the establishment of the Central Intelligence Agency.<br />The film follows the life and career of Edward Wilson as he plays his role in laying the foundation for one of the best intelligence agencies ever to be set up.<br />Matt Damon, Robert De Niro, Alec Baldwin, Angelina Jolie, Michael Gambon, and the rest of this AMAZING cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!

Parts of it were difficult to watch, but it is a highly interesting, engaging film.<br /><br />The movie tells the story of Edward Wilson (Matt Damon), an idealistic young poetry student at Yale. The son of a high-ranking federal judge, Wilson is tapped to become a member of the elite Skull and Bones society. After accepting, he is drawn further into a world where the expectations of others will govern his decisions. After a passionate roll in the hay with Clover (Angelina Jolie) at a Skull and Bones retreat, Edward learns she is pregnant. Though he is in love with another woman (the hearing-impaired Laura, played beautifully by Tammy Blanchard), Edward weds Clover.<br /><br />The film is set at the end of World War II, when the OSS/CIA were operating/forming. Due to the strong connections of previous members (many of whom went on to work in the military and in government), several young men in the Skull and Bones society are chosen to work in intelligence and counterintelligence. Edward begins work, and the audience watches as he sacrifices one thing after another for his career. Protecting the United States is a noble calling, true, but Edward pays a high price for his devotion. He doesn't even see his son until the boy is more than five years old because of his overseas work. His relationship with his wife, what little there was of it to begin with, deteriorates due to neglect. He can't trust anyone, and so he doesn't.<br /><br />What's fascinating about this film for me is that it isn't all flash and dazzle, like other spy films you may have seen. This film shows the slow, quiet work of the CIA. It shows the strategy behind the organization and what kind of power it wields. It also shows the birth of intelligence gathering in the United States, and it is pretty darn intriguing to go poking into some of those corners of U.S. history. More than anything, though, it illustrates what working in the intelligence industry does to the individuals who commit to it. (And it ain't pretty.)<br /><br />I think Damon plays a role different from his "type" in this film. Edward has such a character arc. He starts the film with a wonderful, tender relationship with Laura. Though he never seems to be jolly, he is an earnest boy who is not without humor. But by the end of the film, Edward is so careful. He is so silent. He is damaged. Damon expertly paints Edward in all the tones of the things he does not say. This performance is a precise study in minimalism.<br /><br />Angelina Jolie has some aching moments as Clover, as well. Being married to a ghost takes an enormous toll on Clover, and I have rarely seen Jolie play a character with such frailty. It was quite touching.<br /><br />The films also boasts fine performances by Robert DeNiro (who also directed), William Hurt, Billy Crudup, and Alec Bladwin. I found this movie riveting, with both character and plot to spare. Acting is fabulous, and the subject matter couldn't get much jucier. Worth seeing.</p></br><a href="../users/A39IY0JU5JI69G.html">A39IY0JU5JI69G</a><br/><p>You can tell that Robert DeNiro really cares about what he's telling us here...probably too much so.  A little more objectivity and a much better film might have emerged.<br /><br />The spy game and its corroding effects on the human psyche are much better told by LeCarre.  Still it's a good theme and worth exploring.  There's just too much crammed in here and as much as I cared to follow the intricacies of the plot after while I lost interest.  I think DeNiro had to chose which of the two plots to focus on - the spy plot or the human drama; he tried for too much and as a result people just get tired of watching and lose interest.<br /><br />The cast is stellar and they all do heroic jobs.  I usually love Matt Damon and I don't fault him for the less-than-fascinating performance.  He was undoubtably told to play "cold" and "emotionally detached" and he gave us that for two hours and forty some minutes.  I think that the development, or devolution of his character would have been much more interesting if we had seen more of the younger, livelier man, who gradually hardened into stone.  The most interesting parts of the film were his brief love scenes with the two hearing impaired women.<br /><br />Angelina Jolie did a wonderful job but I think she was miscast.  She was far too exotically beautiful to play a girl whom Damon would so easily ignore.<br /><br />As other reviewers here have mentioned, there are certainly some cliches indulged in...There's no guessing what DeNiro thinks about WASP culture...gee, are they all as bad as that?!!<br /><br />The film isn't awful, as Hollywood films go, but I suggest that anyone really interested in the genre to skip this and re-watch the LeCarre films.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MYUI8IT6UBUU.html">A2MYUI8IT6UBUU</a><br/><p>Ingeniously written, with superlative acting and a masterful score, this sinister drama delves into the mysterious and ruinous influences the CIA has on the lives of their dedicated operatives. A slightly disconcerting timeline doesn't deter from enjoying the crafty elements of betrayal, suspicion and sacrifice that permeate this Cold War espionage epic.<br /><br />Edward Wilson (Matt Damon) is a well-rounded Yale graduate who is quickly recruited into the newly formed Central Intelligence Agency due to his desired qualities of discretion and commitment. Suspicion and paranoia gradually overrun his once steadfast belief in American values, as he rapidly becomes a chief operative and an integral part of the system. Engulfed in distrust and intent on combating his KGB rival, Wilson consequently sacrifices his ideals and his family in the pursuit of his career.<br /><br />The Good Shepherd achieves what films of this length usually attempt and rarely succeed at, and that is to delve into the inner-workings of its characters and explore character development to its most complex and absolute fullest. Meaningful events and poignant dialogue work beautifully to immerse the viewer into the traumatic lives of those involved in the secretive CIA and its shaky roots. Most prominently is the character study of the fictitious Edward Wilson, whose dynamic rise and fall parallels films such as The Godfather. Although they both fail in preventing what seems to be inevitable destiny, Wilson manages to wash away guilt, feeling and perhaps even acknowledgement of his situation and the sacrifices made to preserve the job that keeps him in an ominous stranglehold. Inhumanly he acts according to its will, half conscious of the consequences to his family and himself, and yet he relishes in the accomplishments that lead to absolute solitude. So many of his ill deeds are attempts at righting other wrongs, and he is perpetually fixed in compromises, sacrifices and decisions that aid the agency. His choices are those of ill-fate and necessity; he is capable of love, but unable to display it fruitfully, and like his father, negatively impacts the lives of his wife and son. A truly tragic character, the viewer is made aware of his hopeless cycle throughout the film, but only at the conclusion do we see the shell of the man chewed up and spit out and left in reflection; he fails to accept the realizations of how his choices affect those closest to him, even though such repercussions are unintentional. The intense themes of paranoia, suspicion, and betrayal are wonderfully conjured up through masterfully dramatic performances by rising star Matt Damon, and equally stunning supporting actors Angelina Jolie, William Hurt, and Robert De Niro. John Turturro plays operative Ray Brocco, another outstanding supporting performance, who menacingly and efficiently carries out his duty; he retains a sense of humor at his inception into the agency, but gradually develops into an efficiently torturous henchman. Robert De Niro, who also directs, makes a short appearance, as does Joe Pesci, who has been curiously out of the spotlight for a very long time, garnering a high billing even though his character appears for only one scene...<br /><br />Read the full review at www.moviepulse.net</p></br></body></html>

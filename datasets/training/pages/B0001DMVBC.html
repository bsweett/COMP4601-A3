Glad I watched it, but I'd never buy it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1YC9XEDFKXPLK.html">A1YC9XEDFKXPLK</a><br/><p>House of Sand and Fog is one of those rare films to put the shock into anyone's system in recent years; It did me. I recently saw this film and many audience members gasped and were stunned by several emotionally charged pivotal scenes. House of Sand and Fog is full of suspenseful steam. Stunning performances by Ben Kingsley and Jennifer Connelly and supporting cast are phenomenal. This is a highly charged film with enough seething psychological and emotional action ! Cinematography of panoramic proportions and filming techniques of the beautiful California coast and sky is simply breath taking but naturally overshadowed and marred by the devastatingly serious nature of the film.<p>In sum,a young California woman is incorrectly evicted from her home due to business property taxes processed which she did not owe. Failure on her part to open up the mail (notices/warnings) from the property county assessor's office lead to Connelly's character pursuing legal action but to no avail. House is auctioned and a Middle Eastern retired military officer (Ben Kingsley) and family purchase home for a 1/4 of what it is worth to live out the American dream.The house may be their permanent residency or it may become a "transitional" home. Soon, there is a tumultuous tug of war between evicted home owner and new occupants the likes that make the battle between the Hatfields and McCoys seem like a family reunion ! Events,  tempers, emotions flare to astronomical and disastrous horrific proportions pushing all parties concerned to the edge of madness and the point of no return. Just when there seems to be the least bit of glimmer of hope for compromise, well, you get the picture. The tumultuous battle begins to take its toll on both parties involved and the people around them...<p>Critics are right; there are no villains, heroes or heroines ...Just human beings trying to make sense of the madness that certain events life may throw at them while also trying to survive unscathed. It also raises a very powerful question ; How far is anyone willing to go to hang onto or protect what they believe or know is rightfully theirs (not just in the sense of owning a home but on anything in one's life, material or otherwise) ? Viewer sympathy will be split for both sides. <p>I have never read the book from which the film is adapted from, so I cannot critique as to how faithful the film is to the novel. Is this Oscar material (acting, best picture) ? Absolutley, no question about that. House of Sand and Fog will stay with you for some time to come and make you ponder and ask that raw question of "What would I do?"...</p></br><a href="../users/A1L8HRCM60W0W7.html">A1L8HRCM60W0W7</a><br/><p>Like Michael Caine, Ben Kingsley is a master of the unspoken. The subtleties of his facial expressions presented in moments of either joy or frustration are so masterfully restrained, it's a pleasure simply to watch him! <p>In "House of..," he plays an ex Iranian militiary man now working menial jobs in the US. It's probably a predicament that we rarely think about -- perhaps we'd prefer not -- and it's certainly a subject that Hollywood would rather brush by. But Perelman's film, based on Andre Dubus III's 1999 best seller, not only corrects this social/artistic delinquency but does it in such a bold and imaginative way and with such driving force that "House of Sand and Fog" works as much as a potent entertainment as it does as a morality play.<p>I haven't seen much of Jennifer Connelly before, but her absolutely knock-out presence on the screen as a murky character with an alcoholic past is dazzling. When the characters of Kingsley and Connelly finally clash halfway through the film, the film, having until then been a paean to silence and unspoken loyalties, becomes a terrifying thriller, riveting everyone with whom I saw the picture. Perelman moves from a mood piece to a suspenseful drama effortlessly. A jaw-dropping conclusion completes a powerful, unbelievably sad piece of work.<p>It's a harrowing story, cathartic and elegant, beautifully filmed, stirringly told. It will toy with your emotions and work them into a frenzy. What a splendid accomplishment for a first-time director. <p>Highly recommended!</p></br><a href="../users/AR37967IAR6ZT.html">AR37967IAR6ZT</a><br/><p>HOUSE OF SAND AND FOG, directed by first-time filmmaker Vadim Perelman from a screenplay he helped adapt from an Andre Dubus novel, is a story of people who are only at conflict because they see their troubles and desperation as tantamount over those who oppose them. The fight in the film concerns a seaside house and what it represents to those who claim ownership over it.<p>The movie establishes a conflict between its two main characters where neither side outweighs the other, and neither side is entirely wrong. Anti-American and racial sentiments fuel the conflict, and the film acknowledges that - but this isn't just a film about racism. <p>It's about characters whose very natures we come to understand. It, through its visuals and through the uniformly terrific ensemble of actors, also establishes a group of strong core characters, people that you empathize with so much that you cannot choose sides regarding the fight over the house. <p>But, because both sides are desperate and at an impasse, the entire film spirals, like a thriller, toward its tragic, nearly inevitable conclusion. (Certainly, in real life, things might not have turned out as bad as things did for these characters at the end, some might say. But the characters in HOUSE OF SAND AND FOG remain true to their natures, true to their flaws, so it ends the way that it does and feels right.)<p>Jennifer Connelly is terrific in this film. Ron Eldard, playing a character central to the dark turn the film takes, is impressive, making his character so despicable that you hate him, knowing the conclusions he'll jump to before he does. (The last film that generated this sort of response from me was A SIMPLE PLAN, where you could feel that the characters were going to screw up - yet you couldn't help but watch them do it.)<p>Ben Kingsley, who is British and yet is able to transform himself completely in every role, is absolutely amazing as Behrani. The layers of innate goodness, personal pride, potential for violence and paternal instinct necessary to make the character work are all on display here. Kingsley's work is always good, and HOUSE OF SAND AND FOG ranks among the best work he's ever done. The actors playing his wife and son in the film match Kingsley's brilliance in nearly every scene.<p>I'm amazed Vadim Perelman has never made a film before. This film is accomplished, sad and incredibly moving.</p></br><a href="../users/ANIMV3SPDD8SH.html">ANIMV3SPDD8SH</a><br/><p>Dependent on the unlikely actions of several characters, &quot;House of Sand and Fog&quot; is a heavy-handed, utterly earnest excersize in contemporary tragedy. I understand that Jennifer Connely's character is supposed to be an average American whose life history remains obscure but her reason for being involved in a legal dispute over the ownership of a modest home is so unlikely it is rendered shallow. The cop who befriends Connely and slowly becomes psychotic due to a racist mentality is only a device to turn the lame story toward it's melodramatic resolution. It's certainly a watchable movie, even involving, Connely and Ben Kingsly as the compatriot in this legal dispute are excellent, but the platform plot too often sinks in the sand and gets lost in the fog.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TPW86OHXTXFC.html">A1TPW86OHXTXFC</a><br/><p>Moving, sad and enthralling movie is &quot;The House of Sand and Fog&quot;.<br />Andre Dubois wrote the book and received over 100 offers for the movie rights. The movie does the book justice. The photography is<br />superb and the sand and fog surround the house and the movie. Jennifer Connelly follows up her Academy Award performance in another dark film- she is brilliant and believable. Ben Kingsley as always is so &quot;right on&quot; in his interpretation of his character. He is a fomer military man in the Iraq Army, and is ramrod straight and honest. He does not flinch, not once.<p>Jennifer Connelly is removed from her family home for not paying a tax that turns out to be a mistake. Jennifer, it sems has given up drinking and is depressed and never opens her mail. Thus she never sees the bill. Once removed from her home, she is befriended by a local policeman who is lonely and feels sorry for her. This develops into a romance- the man is married and has children and all these lives become intertwined with despair and depression. <p>Into this morass comes Ben Kingsley looking for a home to buy, to repair and sell at a premium. He and his family are living beyond their means- he is working at two jobs to keep up the facade. His plan is to move to the house while they are fixing it up and relieving himself of the stress of the bills and the many hours of work.  He finds the ad for this home for sale at a very large discount- buys the home and then all hell breaks loose.  The juxtaposition of his family heirlooms, gold and silver and glass in a seaside cottage gives the movie an unearthly feel.  <p>Jennifer and her policeman try to get the home back but their plans fall apart. Jennfier starts to slide down that ugly black hole, and all the lives involved fall apart. <p>This is a breath-takingly beautiful movie- so well acted it is real. Academy Award performances abound in this movie. This is not a movie for the squeamish- blood and suspense are plentiful.  Recommended highly! prisrob</p></br><a href="../users/A2GPEV42IO41CI.html">A2GPEV42IO41CI</a><br/><p>Kathy (Jennifer Connelly), a troubled woman who has lost control of her life, is evicted from her home for failure to pay a small tax.  The home is auctioned and then bought by Colonel Behrani (Ben Kingsley), formerly of the Iranian Air Force, now reduced to doing manual labor on highway crews.  He hopes to resell the house for a big profit and thus help his family maintain some of their honor and pride.  Kathy tries to get the house back with the help of  her new love, Lester (Ron Eldard), and the lives of all involved are destined for tragedy.<br /><br />I was anxious to see this film because I was so impressed with the novel by Andre Dubus, which was highly dramatic and suspenseful and exquisitely sad.  The movie is none of these, however, despite the outstanding performances of Ben Kingsley as the proud and once-powerful Colonel and  Shohreh Aghdashloo, as his long-suffering wife.  The problem is Connelly, Eldard, and the script are just dull and disappointing.  Aside from Kingsley's scenes, the movie is exceedingly average and uninteresting.  Connelly and Eldard lack charisma and also any chemistry with each other.  The novel's dynamic conflict and heart-pounding tension are gone, and one cares little in the end.  Fans of Ben Kingsley will certainly enjoy his bravura performance, but outside of that, I recommend the book.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>House of Sand and Fog (Vadim Perelman, 2003)<p>What happens when two Horatio Alger-style great American success stories end up in a head-on collision? Andre Dubus III attempted to address the question in the novel House of Sand and Fog. Vadim Perelman attempted to make Dubus III's attempt into a movie. While neither was successful, the movie did a much better job of it than the book did.<p>Kathy (Oscar winner Jennifer Connelly [Phenomena, Dark City]) has been left by her husband, and is not in the best shape. When her house is seized for nonpayment of a bill that never existed in the first place, she's not too happy about it. While she's trying to get it back, the house is bought at a foreclosure sale by Colonel Behrani (Oscar winner Ben Kingsley [Sexy Beast, Suspect Zero]), an Iranian who had to flee the country with his family after the collapse of the Shah's regime. Kathy gets a well-meaning but unstable police officer (Ron Eldard [ER]) into the mix, and things start to go wrong fast.<p>Where Perelman's film improves (mightily) over the book is in giving us more of the Horatio Alger sense of the story-that both of these people, who have been wronged by their respective governments, deserve to triumph in the end. He brings out the parallels between the two in ways the book never achieved (a more malicious reviewer might say "ways Dubus never even thought of"). Unfortunately, however, first-time director Perelman is not a Hitchcock, able to take mediocre source material and turn it into great film. He does the best he can, to be fair. Ben Kingsley's performance here is a mighty one and well worth your renting the film. The problem is that everything else here pales in comparison. None of the characters is much worth caring about (as in the book), the pace is glacial (as in the book), and the basic stupidity of some of the characters' actions is way too far beyond the pale to be believed (as in the book).<p>Kingsley's performance is worth seeing. The rest of the movie can be safely dismissed as a very pretty piece of fluff. **</p></br><a href="../users/A2QHM5HBSIXRL4.html">A2QHM5HBSIXRL4</a><br/><p>You can read elsewhere on this page about the great acting jobs turned in by Ben Kingsley and Jennifer Connelly.  Both are outstanding here.  I had just seen Kingsley in 'Sexy Beast' so the constrast was stunning.  And Connelly is better here - forced to plumb greater depths - than she was in her Oscar-winning turn in "A Beautiful Mind."  (Why no Oscar nomination here if Kingsley and Shohreh Aghdashloo got them?  Seems an obvious oversight.)<p>The real revelations here are co-star Aghdashloo and director Vadim Perelman.  Aghdashloo was justly rewarded with an Independent Spirit award and that Oscar nod.  Great to see the Academy go a little wider afield in their recognition.  <p>With Aghdashloo and Whale Rider's Keisha Castle-Hughes, it's obvious there's a sea change coming.  Aghdashloo deserves that nomination.  She's the stitching that pulls together each of the film's different threads.  Plus, holding your own in scene after scene with Sir Ben Kingsley is quite a feat.<p>Perelman's personal story is inspiring.  What a trip for this Ukrainian imigrant who was known up until this point as a director of commercials.  He formed a bond with writer Andre Dubus III because he saw that "House" was a bleak, uncompromising story - he made a promise to Dubus not to mess with that tone...no contrived, uplifting ending here.  Far from it.  This is one of the more savage, stunning ends to a film you'll ever see.<p>Perelman's next project is 'The Talisman' (based on a Stephen King story), with Executive Producer Steven Spielberg (due out in 2005).  It's obvious that Perelman's debut effort turned some heads in Hollywood.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KFBAPAKMEQUF.html">A1KFBAPAKMEQUF</a><br/><p>I thoroughly enjoyed this film, and completely identified with the Iranian immigrant family who were pursuing their American dream, while longing for what they had been forced to flee from in their native land.  As an immigrant myself, I understand the desire to own your own home and do well, even while holding on fiercely to one's cultural background.<p>I did not identify at all with the careless female who failed to aggressively ensure that her home was securely in her possession, and who turned around and tried to blame all her problems on the immigrant family who had worked hard to save money to buy her auctioned home.  Apparently, Ms. Connelly's character did not work, was an alcoholic, had no friends, and was generally a layabout.  It just struck me that she was lucky enough to inherit the home from a hardworking father, but failed to take any actions to ensure that she would continue to own this home.  I could not understand why she blamed the immigrant family who legally came into possession of her home, and engaged in what I deem to be harassment against them, instead of suing the county for what she believed was an illegal tax.<p>Anyways, this movie will move you to tears with its all around brilliant and believable performances - especially at its dramatic and painful conclusion.<p>Well done!! This is one of the few movies that was worthy of all the hype.</p></br><a href="../users/A2Z0A3DOG0EVTY.html">A2Z0A3DOG0EVTY</a><br/><p>I have to be painfully honest before I begin. I'm a down home protestant at heart. I spent my entire life going to Sunday school and Church. So when I sat down to write my review for THE HOUSE OF SAND AND FOG those pesky Ten Commandments kept jumping back into my head. Because I believe just about every commandment is represented and therefore broken it was impossible for me to not see it.<br />Philosophically I believe humans to be fallen, and therefore evil to the core. This is not a judgement but a spiritual absolute. I have lied, stolen, coveted, and so therefore I am separated from my Creator. It is only by grace that I am not lost. I also believe the Ten Commandments to be the most practical system of laws to prove this.<p>The characters in THE HOUSE OF SAND AND FOG, is a great representation of this idea. In the film we are presented with two very flawed people. Two people who are fighting over a house that were taken by a bureaucratic mistake.<p>Jennifer Connelly (The Hulk) stars as Kathy, a young woman whose life goes from bad to worse. Her husband has walked out on her, she is recovering from a substance abuse problem, and her family has very little faith in her. When her house was stolen right out from underneath her, she is forced to live in crusty motels and her car until the legal system figures it all out.<p>You see, the government evicted her by accident and sold her house to an Iranian immigrant named Behranini (Ben Kingsly, Ghandi). Behranini has worked his entire life to make a place for his family. He once was a decorated military figure whom was forced out of his country with the Shah. He now lays gravel on the San Francisco Freeway, and works nights at a convenience store. Fiercely proud, he lives above his means so his daughter will marry well. When this foreclosed house comes on the market he sees a cash cow that can pull his family out of financial ruin.<p>These two people are thrown into a battle for a house. Both holding on for dear life and willing to do just about anything to get what each believes they deserve. No one is guilty and yet no one is innocent. <p>To make matters worse, there is this cop (Ron Elderd, Ghost Ship) with questionable morals whom is helping Kathy. At first it all seems innocent. He pulls some strings for her at the beginning. All seems well until they fall for each other and he leaves his family. <p>First time Director Vadim Perelman has crafted a film that is rough around the edges and yet filled with engaging performances. He has made a film where no one is the villain, and yet everyone is. He shows just how important it is to "Love our neighbors," what it means to be truly compassionate, and how easy it is for a regular guy to become a cold-blooded monster.<p>At every turn THE HOUSE OF SAND AND FOG shows its audience the mirror into our own souls. While I do doubt some of the motivations (Mostly those by Elderd's characters), Perelman has gotten performances out of the actors that feel authentic.<p>Jennifer Connelly should be up for an Oscar again. Her performance, while a little too somber, hits the right notes at the right time. The screenplay comes on a little thick, especially the scene involving the cigarette machine. But as we watch her character's slow and deliberate slide into poverty, we feel empathy and anger. She is not a hero, she is not good, but in the end she is human, and so we as the audience long to hug her.<p>Kingsly's character is also very good. He is a man fighting with the honor of his past and also for the American Dream. He is also a man who has lost his faith in his god, and wants so desperately to have everything good. His performance only suffers when the plot drags him and his son on a journey that steals the last moments of the film away from the realm of reality.<p>It is Elderd's character that steals believability from the film. The scenes where he is confronted by his jilted wife and his crying children feel desperate, and drag us away from the main story. His character also does too many things that feel forced. The last fifteen or twenty minutes of the film were adequate but still kind of clunky because of decisions he makes. They did not work for me as much as they should have. <p>The end also steals the action away from Kathy and places it all in Behranini's court. Thus stealing any true revelation from Kathy. It also features Jennifer Connelly standing on a white dock looking out at the ocean. I can think of two movies that use a shot similar to this, can you?<p>THE HOUSE OF SAND AND FOG is so close to being perfect. I hate to harp on the entire end, because some of it works pretty well. I just hate serious character dramas that forget their characters and become slaves to their plot. But trust me, if you are looking for a film that is both challenging and really fascinating, give it a try.<p>****1/2 out of 5</p></br><a href="../users/AMYW43AHO16SS.html">AMYW43AHO16SS</a><br/><p>Oscar winners Jennifer Connelly and Ben Kingsley give solid performances as rivals who both want the same house to call their own.

Massoud Behrani (Ben Kingsley) is a proud Iranian immigrant, once a colonel in the Shah's army, who now struggles to provide a respectable lifestyle for his family. When Behrani purchases Kathy's repossessed home at auction with the intention of reselling it for a profit, he thinks that providence has finally found him. He will be able to own his own home and send his son to college. But the house was improperly seized by the County, and Kathy, who is without any place to live, desperately wants it back. The house is the only thing in her life that Kathy has to cling to. And the house represents a small amount of much-needed prosperity for the Behrani family. This conflict of needs is made worse by Lester (Ron Eldard), a corrupt police officer whom Kathy unwisely relies on in her time of need.<p>"House of Sand and Fog" is based upon the novel of the same name by Andre DuBus III. The film has been flawlessly directed by Vadim Perelman, who also co-wrote the screenplay. This is Perelman's first feature film. He has previously been a commercial director. I must say that this is the strongest debut by a director that I have ever seen. "House of Sand and Fog" is straight drama. The story is a personal one of realistic behavior under unfortunate circumstances. We watch as tragedy unfolds when two people, who are both right in their claim, claim the same thing, and emotions run high. Ben Kingsley is wonderful as the proud and determined Behrani, who has nevertheless been made so vulnerable by leaving behind his life's accomplishments and moving to a foreign country where he has nothing. Kathy is remarkably unsympathetic for a person who has obviously been wronged. But she eventually becomes more sympathetic as she develops some perspective on her situation. Casting Jennifer Connelly in this role meant that the character would be less trashy than in the book. But I think that was a wise decision, considering that Kathy has trouble getting the audience's sympathy as it is. And Jennifer Connelly does a wonderful job here. It is her best work to date. This should establish her as a true acting talent and put rumors that she is just a pretty face to rest. Ron Eldard is also fantastic in his supporting role as Lester, a thoroughly repulsive man, but not an easy one to make believable. Shohreh Aghdashloo is utterly affecting as Massoud Behrani's wife, Nadi, a caring and vivacious woman whose displacement has left her filled with sadness and fear. <p>"House of Sand and Fog" has a slow, contemplative, but even pace. And it's a certain type of film. It exhibits emotions, drama and tragedy on a personal scale. Those who prefer more action or a larger canvas will not like it. But Vadim Perelman has created a masterpiece of personal drama. The performances are outstanding. The cinematography is exquisitely evocative. "House of Sand and Fog" is as good as a film of this type gets. Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A1V3IO23FZFF9L.html">A1V3IO23FZFF9L</a><br/><p>HOSAF is a well made movie.

An Iranian family man legitimatly buys the seized property and plans to sell it at market value, so to turn a hefty profit. The drama becomes tense, as the woman fights to regain the house which she feels is still hers.<br />Kingsly does a fine job as always. The film is well-paced, and well written, albeit a bit overdramatized at parts. It is an interesting film which should cause one to imagine themselves in the protagonists' shoes, and how he would deal with the situations.</p></br><a href="../users/A146D2LYLICNLS.html">A146D2LYLICNLS</a><br/><p>I remember reading Andre Dubus' "House Of Sand And Fog" a couple of years ago. While not among the best books I've ever read, I did find it to be an interesting and worthwhile read that stuck with me long after I finished the last page. And when I heard that it was becoming a movie adaptation my interest in the story was immediately renewed. Today I went to see it and can say without reservation that this is one of the very rare instances when a film version surpasses the novel. <p>Ben Kingsley gives yet another superb performance in his role as Colonel Behrani. Equally as convincing is Jennifer Connelly who plays Kathy Nicolo, the desperate and determined woman who will stop at nothing to claim her house back which Behrani has purchased at auction price because she neglected to pay her taxes on it. Both Kingsley and Connelly are simply excellent in their roles. Ron Eldard plays Sheriff Lester Burdon, a cop who is unhappily married and starts an affair with Kathy, taking her under his wing and promising to get her house back. I found Eldard's performance to be a little wooden at times but for the most part he pulled it off well.<p>The same amount of praise also goes to director Vadim Perelman and the rest of the crew who worked behind the scenes to give "House Of Sand And Fog" the perfect atmosphere and setting. The house used in the movie was EXACTLY how I had envisioned it as I read the book. <p>It should also be noted that this movie adaptation remains very faithful to the book with the exception of the ending which was a little different. For example, those of you who have read the book will notice that Behrani doesn't try to strangle Kathy in this movie version. There are other minor differences, especially during the final minutes, but to reveal them would give away the ending for those not familiar with the story.<p>To sum up, "House Of Sand And Fog" is definitely one of the better movies to come out this year that offers both a good story and great acting. Don't expect a happy ending because there is none; this story is about tragic people making tragic decisions. But it's an engaging plot nonetheless. Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>House of Sand and Fog was one of the best films of 2003 and should have recieved more credit where credit was due (namely in a Best Actress nod for Connelly and a Best Picture nod to say the least) but alas for the Oscars only rewarded Kingsley's potrayal of Iranian imagrant Massoud Amir Behrani and his wife played by outstanding newcomer Shohreh Aghdashloo, and don't get me wrong because they deserved it, but there should have been more awards to it's name.  Kingsley plays an Iranian man who purchases a home for his family, as an investment in order to turn a profit.  Connelly plays the owner of the home, Kathy, who gets everything ripped right out from under her feet.  Technically the house is still hers, but legally it was already sold.  You see the tax office made a mistake and accused Kathy of owing money she didn't owe, so they sold her house.  The key there is that she didn't owe anything and so now she must fight to regain ownership of her house.  The acting, as I stated early on, is a knockout punch with outstanding performances by everyone involved but more notable on Connelly's part who nailed her role and proved that 'A Beautiful Mind' was not a fluke (but anyone who has seen her in Requiem of a Dream already knows that)...I urge any and everyone to see this film.  It touches on so much more than ownership of a house but what makes us as humans whole and how we will fight to know that we matter.  Kathy fights for a house that means the world to her...it is all the stability she has left, the only part of her life that hasn't been ruined by her alcaholism and is the only thing that gives her hope of one day overcoming all and living a normal, stable life.  Massoud will fight for a house that means a future for his family.  The ending is stunning and will make you lose breath.  Please, I urge you...watch this film!</p></br><a href="../users/A1N7YA81ZI4KAF.html">A1N7YA81ZI4KAF</a><br/><p>An utterly depressing but effective film that will have the viewer questioning their morals and that of society's. The film centres around 2 key characters. One is a troubled young woman who is wrongfully evicted from her home and the other is a determined Iranian immigrant who works as hard as he can to provide for his family. The two meet under unfortunate circumstances and unwillingly set off a chain of events that escalates into madness and tragedy. There are several victims in this film. The first being Connelly who is injustly thrown out in to the streets. The second is the determined Kingsley who is unjustly thrown into emotional turmoil by the thought of buying a house that rightfully belongs to someone else. The third is Kingsley's family, who after finding out what has occurred are  thrown in to the chaos. And lastly, Ron Eldard, Connelly's only ally who becomes a victim of his consuming passion for her.<br /><br />This film is dark and depressing and the characters are all gloomy adding a touch of pathos to the already somber tone of the film. As mentioned previously, it had me questioning my morals and at the same time, made me furious at society's lack of compassion and reason. Although the film is not based on a true story, you can see something like this happening in real life and the tragic characters are so expertly played by the actors, most notably Ben Kingsley, Jennifer Connelly and Shohreh Aghdashloo, that your heart goes out to every single individual in the film. Aghdashloo's performance as Kingsley's wife is especially spellbinding. Her facial expressions, her voice combined with her incredible performance haunted me for days. Her character is emotionally rich. She emanates kindness and grace and she is the most sympathetic character in the film. The scene (towards the end of the film) in which she awakens from a dream is so incredibly touching, it almost moved me to tears.<br /><br />Brilliant performances, captivating characters and a compelling story makes this one of the most powerful film's I have seen in a very long time. It is highly recommended but a box of kleenix should be at arm's reach. This film is that effective.</p></br><a href="../users/A3I69IXPTDVKQF.html">A3I69IXPTDVKQF</a><br/><p>With all the emotional trauma, the heartbreak and the seemingly unresolvable angst, it's an enormous tribute to the power of the material and the talent of everyone on both sides of the camera that "House Of Sand And Fog" doesn't come off so depressing as to be almost impossible to get through.  It's sad yes, but sadness isn't all there is here; there are stunning moments of brightness, beauty and compassion amidst the darkness and the desperation, combining for a haunting and mesmerising movie.<br /><br />  When a troubled young woman (Kathy, played by Jennifer Connelly) loses her house due to a government screwup concerning 'unpaid' taxes that she never actually owed in the first place, and the house goes up for auction, it allows Behrani (Ben Kingsley), a hard-working immigrant from Iran (where he previosly lived a life of wealth prior to the overthrow of the Shah) to finally buy a house for his family, with the intention of residing there awhile, building it up, selling it for a profit and the tiny auction sum he paid for it and finally digging his family out of the financial hole into which they've been sliding.  The tragic thing is, neither Kathy nor Behrani are really at fault for the conundrum this all creates, but a heated tug-of-war for the house begins, with the reasons on both sides running much deeper than mere monetary concerns.  There is a ton of backstory to both these characters, and for some of the other characters as well, that is never specifically spelled out but is left for the viewer to decipher, and it adds enormous weight to the show, and even more sympathy for those characters that have been struggling with truly dark demons.  In addition to the exceptional jobs done by Connelly and Kingsley, Shohreh Aghdashloo, Jonhathan Adout, and Ron Eldard have to be singled out as well for their own truly great performances.  Some characters ultimately come off more favorably than others, and one character reveals a real dichotomy in self in being capable of both tremendous goodness and shocking displays of aggressiveness and outright violence (one of which may knock you right out of your seat), a dichotomy that provides real pondering material on what exactly is the extent of this one character's backstory.<br /><br />  I'll say nothing about what goes on in the final quarter or so of the movie.  This is one of the most emotionally diverse and one of the best-acted movies I've ever seen.  Extremely powerful.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PN7Z2VTHICL8.html">A2PN7Z2VTHICL8</a><br/><p>At first, I thought 'House Of Sand And Fog' would be a rather drawn out and boring movie, a sort of touchy-feelie film that I may admire but not necessarily enjoy.  I was happily wrong.<br /><br />House Of Sand And Fog is a drama that blooms with carefully orchestrated, subtle suspense, and carries with it the slight reek of prejudice.  Who would you trust to be honest and fair?  A Muslim Iranian family?  A recovering, unemployed addict?  A police officer?  And just what type of greed would you consider to be the worst type?<br /><br />Kathy (played by extremely talented Jennifer Connelly-Labyrinth, Requiem For A Dream) is a recovering addict, recently inheriting an older but cozy house from her father.  However, the county mistakenly believes that she owes business tax and repossesses her property, leaving her homeless.  Kathy is helped out by Officer Lester Burdon (played by Ron Eldard-Ghost Ship), who gives her an attorney's phone number and helps her pack her things.<br /><br />Colonel Massoud Behrani (played by the incomparable Ben Kingsley-Suspect Zero, Schindler's List, Sneakers), an Iranian immigrant, finds the house listed for sale by the county and quickly purchases it.  Behrani has spent every penny earned at working several jobs to ensure his daughter was married into a suitable family.  Now he must see to his son's college, and dreams of fixing up the old house and making enough profit for his son's future.<br /><br />Kathy hires an attorney to get her house back, but Behrani will not sell back to the county for less than four times the amount he paid for it.  When Kathy sees that the law moves too slow, she confronts the Behrani's in an attempt to appeal to their sense of justice.<br /><br />In the midst of her conflict with the Behrani's, Lester continues to take more than a casual interest in Kathy, to the point of leaving his wife and children to start fresh with her.  How far will Lester and Kathy go to get back what rightfully belongs to her?  Is Colonel Behrani an evil man or a victim himself?  You will find that things are not always how they first appear, and will be holding your breath by the time House Of Sand And Fog reaches its surprising and powerful finish.<br /><br />The lines between good and evil are thin and silvery gray in this exceptional dark tale of misguided intensions and ill-gotten gains.  The photography is virtually stunning, the script tight, the acting above spectacular, and the emotion all too real.  Special mention goes to actress Shohreh Aghdashloo who plays Nadi Behrani, and to Jonathon Ahdout who plays Esmail Behrani.  Their superior supporting roles created a truly believable family with the Behranis.<br /><br />Don't think for one minute that House Of Sand And Fog is your usual, uninspired drama.  This is a dark journey into the heart, touching those black spots that leak poison inside all of us.  Definitely worth a purchase.  Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/AUHG8KSHI529U.html">AUHG8KSHI529U</a><br/><p>This is a painful story that has a great deal to recommend it if you can stand its sadness.  Here everyone is at fault, but no one is to blame.  It is the confluence of a series of awful situations that have simple solutions that are inaccessible.<br /><br />The story is told as parallel revelations of the lives of Kathy (tragically performed by the wonderful Jennifer Connely), and the Behrani family (Massoud Behrani is played magnificently by Ben Kingsley).  Kathy?s life is shattered into a torpor that seems almost fatal.  She is unjustly losing her father?s house because of a bureaucratic blunder she hasn?t the energy to resist.  Massoud Behrani is an immigrant working hard to recover something like the station he had in Iran.  However, he has to work multiple menial jobs just to be broke.  Kathy?s seized property is just the opportunity he needs to get back on his feet.<br /><br />Into this sad and volatile situation comes Lester (well portrayed by Ron Eldard) who is the sheriff sent to evict Kathy and is also in a precarious situation in his life.  What develops between him and Kathy is destructive to both of them and leads to a disaster for everyone in the film.<br /><br />The story doesn't tell you how to feel about the characters.  This adds power and depth to the film because you will find yourself arguing different positions on each of the characters (except maybe Lester).  This is not the result of indifference or ambiguity as much as it is an understanding of the characters and a strong wish that things could and should be different.  Instead, we get this terrible tragedy.<br /><br />Brilliantly done.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R1HAXRNU0QX7.html">A2R1HAXRNU0QX7</a><br/><p>This is an emotionally wrenching movie...utterly fascinating and devastating. Some critics have blasted the movie for having an over-the-top or far-fetched ending. The ending is quite devastating, but it is totally convincing and earns its "tragedy" the old fashioned way...by making us care VERY much for the characters.<p>You probably know the basic plot.  Jennifer Connolly, a recovering addict who is still in deep depression, has ignored pleas to pay taxes on the home she inherited from her father, and is suddenly evicted with no place to go. The house is bought by Iranian emigree (and former colonel and confidant of the Shah) Ben Kingsley, as a way of bringing his family a little closer to the American dream.<p>Kingsley has no idea the circumstances under which Connolly loses her house...he's got things pretty rough himself.  Some early scenes in the movie beautifully show the dignity with which Kingsley endures two horrible jobs...working on a road crew and in a convenience store. This is a proud man, a formerly important one, who strives mightily to keep up appearances...not just for his own pride, but so that his daughter can marry well and so his son can go to university.  He is a prickly  man, no doubt, but noble.<p>Connolly realises that the house was really the last lifeline holding her to some semblance of sanity.  She readily admits that she didn't even take good care of it, but upon losing it, she becomes obsessed with getting it back.<p>She is joined in this by the cop who initially helped evict her, played by Ron Ellard.  He has his own problems, including what he considers to be a shaky marriage.  His attraction to Connolly turns into an obsessive need to prove his worth to her by getting her the house back.  No matter what!<p>I will say right here and now that this is the best acted film of the year.  21 GRAMS was no slouch in the acting department and MYSTIC RIVER was darn good too.  But these performances totally drew me in.  I found myself leaning forward in my seat in anxiety and empathy.  My wife gasped several times during the viewing, as the inevitable tragedy began to unfurl.  We both wanted things to change.  We were INVOLVED.<p>Connolly is terrific as always.  She's a beautiful, quiet actress, who has a few moments in this movie that are so raw and stunning...her reserve finally comes down a bit.  The actress who plays Kingsley's wife (sorry, I don't have her name handy...my grievous error) is FABULOUS.  She MUST get nomitated for an Oscar...and she MUST get more work her in the states.  I was absolutely floored.  And the young man playing their naive, noble son is wonderful as well.  Torn between loyalties and eager to prove himself...he is a true heartbreaker.<p>Ron Ellard is fantastically unlikeable, and that's perfect for the movie.  He holds his own quite well.<p>Ben Kingsley, in my opinion, deserves the best actor Oscar. His colonel has so many layers, but Kingsley lets us see them all, playing just below the surface. His character is the opposite of his explosive work in SEXY BEAST.  There everything was on the surface...here it's hidden beneath his impossibly straight back and intense eyes.  I've always liked him a lot as an actor, but this film, I believe, puts him on yet a higher plane.  He is one of the greats!<p>GO SEE THIS FILM!!</p></br><a href="../users/A3QZCA4LTTVGAD.html">A3QZCA4LTTVGAD</a><br/><p>&quot;House of Sand and Fog,&quot; directed by Vadim Perelman, is based on a novel by Andre Dubus III.  The film stars Ben Kingsley as Col. Behrani, a former Iranian military officer under the Shah who now lives with his family in the United States.  He buys a house from a government source, not knowing that the property was improperly seized from its prior owner (Jennifer Connelly).  This bureaucratic nightmare sets up a personal conflict that drives the film.<p>&quot;House&quot; is a beautifully crafted film, rich in detail and visual impact.  But what really makes it shine are the excellent performances.  Connelly makes her wounded character's pain palpable.  As the colonel's wife, Shohreh Aghdashloo brings out both the inner lamb and lioness of the character.  Frances Fisher brings a steely authority to her small but memorable role as an attorney.  But it's Ben Kingsley who most impressed me.  He gives a rich, multifaceted, full-bodied performance; he explores his character's aspects as husband, father, warrior, businessman, and immigrant in a way that creates a memorable and believable person.<p>I found some plot points to seem a bit forced and hard to believe, but overall the superb craftsmanship of the film and its amazing performances really carry &quot;House.&quot;  This is a drama with moments of shocking intensity, as well as scenes of fierce anger and searing pain.  But there are also scenes of real compassion and tenderness.  It's a powerful story and a compelling use of the motif of the immigrant experience in America.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RDR5G65D9H84.html">A2RDR5G65D9H84</a><br/><p>After watching this movie with my wife I reached a very clear conclusion: this is not a film for everyone. Those of you that can stomach sadness and suffering will be able to admire all the wonderful elements this production presents, from the actors to the settings. However, if dramatic situations spoil the moment for you, you may be able to appreciate the quality of the production, like my wife did, but will probably end up with a bitter taste in your mouth.<br /><br />Kathy Nicolo (Jennifer Connoly) is a young widow that is being thrown out of her property for owing a ridiculously low amount of money in property taxes. But right from the start, we know that the ending of this story will not be all joy and happiness, since we catch a glimpse of the future. In this vision, Nicolo appears to be in shock outside of her house, surrounded by police and paramedics that are carrying dead people away from the scene. Following this revelation, we are presented with a collection of scenes that pique our curiosity: a young colonel (Ben Kingsley) cutting down trees that obstruct the view from his new house towards the Caspian Sea, an older colonel Behrani in the luxurious wedding of his daughter, and finally the same Behrani working with a crew on a highway and dreaming of buying a house that he finds in the classified adds.<br /><br />Behrani and his wife go through the effort of making everyone believe that they have money and a high economic status, with not even their kids being aware of the deceit. However, Nicolo's house presents a great opportunity for Behrani, since he is planning to buy it, make some improvements and then sell it at a handsome profit. When he achieves his goal of purchasing the property, he is in heaven, but everything comes tumbling down when Kathy's lawyer begins with his attempts for trying to repossess the house. That is when the hostilities begin and matters get complicated with other events, like a crooked police officer getting involved in the conflict.<br /><br />Firmly supported by a good performance by Connoly and an amazing job by Kingsley, which should have placed him as a serious candidate for the Oscar for Best Actor, this movie has all the required characteristics to provide a valuable experience. The plot is extremely engaging and it does not lack tense moments and its fair share of suspense. As I mentioned before, only those that are very sensitive to sad situations and suffering should stay away. For the rest of you, this should be a highly rewarding film.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>To be honest, I like depressing.  Seriously, I relish in it; I mean I practically bathe myself in depressing.  I don't know why, label me weird all you want, but there is something about the cinematic representation of that whole `all is lost' that just really moves me in ways that most other cinema cannot.  That said; Andre Dubus III's novel `House of Sand and Fog' was one of the most dreadfully depressing, ultimately frustrating novels I have ever read.  This is coming from a guy who likes depressing (frustrating, now that is another story).<br /><br />The film fares better than the novel for me (which also suffered from being far too long and overwrought) but to be honest, it never manages to lift itself high enough to become brilliant.  I believe the potential was there, but I just don't think the film got everything right.<br /><br />For those of you unfamiliar, `House of Sand and Fog' tells the story of Kathy Nicolo, a young and slightly immature woman who lives in a house once belonging to her father.  When she disregards notes regarding a tax she is unfairly charged she winds up being evicted from her home, even though the tax should have never been administered to her.  Before the damage can be reversed her house if put up for auction and purchased by Iranian former military officer Behrani.  Behrani is desperately trying to give his family the stature they once possessed and he sees the purchase of this home and an opportunity to do just that.  His stubbornness, as well as that of Kathy, lead to some very compromising situations, all of which could have been avoided had either of them acted like adults.<br /><br />Like I said, this story is very frustrating.<br /><br />That is my biggest complaint really.  I remember reading the book and getting all sorts of anxious because I could not foresee any sort of redemption in these characters.  I wanted to slap them all and force them to objectively look at their situation.  Watching the movie is almost as difficult for me, because they do the same stupid things; it only fares better because you don't dwell on the situation for weeks on end, it only takes two hours this time.<br /><br />The film does have some very high points as well though.  The acting on almost every front is superb.  Ben Kingsley and Shohreh Aghgashloo were both Oscar nominated for their performances, and deservedly so.  Kingsley is a force as the confrontational Behrani, but it is Aghdashloo's blessedly restrained portrayal of his wife Nadi that steals the entire film (she should have won the Oscar, hands down).  Jennifer Connelly is also very effective, but she takes a back seat to the commanding strengths of her co-stars.  Ron Eldard is the films weak link, and while he is not entirely to blame (his character repulses me) he doesn't do much to make up for the lack of emotional connection his character possesses.<br /><br />The direction by Vadim Perelman is well done.  It captures the ominous tone of the film.  Like I said, this does fare better than the novel, for it is not as deeply unsettling (although the ending is definitely heartbreaking) so one can actually `take' this one, but know that this is not for the faint of heart.  If emotional distress is something that leaves you with any sort of lasting discomfort then stay away from this film, and please avoid the novel at all cost.<br /><br />Yes, I love a good depressing film, but when depressing mixes heavily with unwarranted frustration I get overworked and overwhelmed.  That said; I cannot deny the fact that this is still a very well constructed film that hits its mark on just about every level.  The character of Lester really ruins a lot for me (I hate individuals that are `that' destructively stupid) but as a whole the film is very good, if not nightmarishly effective.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LU79BYMWZEW9.html">A3LU79BYMWZEW9</a><br/><p>Both the book and the movie have almost as many detractors as admirers.  In my own case, I found that the book packed such an emotional wallop that I was wary of any cinematic effort to tell this seemingly straightforward (but ultimately quite tricky) story.  When I finally did see it, it was on a smallish black and white TV at a friend's house.  I didn't care much for the film version then.  Like so many adaptations, it seemed too rushed, too skimpy on the characters "back stories" and their complex inner lives.  The acting was good, but too much of the dialogue seemed expository to me and not as "authentic" as the dialogue in the novel.<br /><br />Seeing it in color and on a much larger screen, as I did recently, did give me a somewhat different perspective.  The sheer beauty of the film was lost on me on the little black and white TV.  As someone below noted, it's hard to go wrong with the Pacific Coast as your background.  True, but the cinematography is more than just pretty to look at.  Here the stunning nature shots serve as a reminder that the human activity--no matter how high the stakes are for those involved--is ultimately petty, perhaps even meaningless, in the grand scheme of things.<br /><br />I'm not surprised that many viewers (particularly those who have not read the book) find the plot overly schematic on the one hand, and the characters' actions almost inexplicable on the other.  The "back stories" really are essential to understanding the characters' motivations.  And without resorting to too many flashbacks or hokey "let me tell you my story" dialogue, there's only so much of that you can really insert into a movie.<br /><br />What flashbacks there are are limited to a few brief shots of Colonel Massoud Behrani (Ben Kingsley) and family's life in the Iran of the time of the Shah.  Presumably, the filmmakers felt that an American audience would need a little more information in their case than they might with the American born characters.  It doesn't hurt either that writer director Vadim Perelman also threw in a wedding scene (only alluded to in the book) that also gives the audience a flavor of Iranian culture and values.<br /><br />The general's nemesis in this real estate tug of war is an emotionally fragile, recovering addict named Kathy Nicolo (Jennifer Connolly) whose personal story is perhaps all too common a one, one we've certainly seen before.  The details of her previous life are skimpier, but we kind of know where she's coming from.<br /><br />Less clear, in the context of the film, are the motivation of the renegade police officer who abandons his wife and children to become Kathy's knight in shining  (blue) armor.  I imagine for those unfamiliar with the novel, his sudden abandonment of his family and (although this was not his intent originally) his career makes little dramatic sense.  It is certainly problematic--and a little too rushed--in the context of the film.  But Ron Eldard succeeds in giving us some hint of the turbulence going on inside the man.  No mean feat since he has comparatively less to work with than either Kingsley or Connolly.<br /><br />The actors work hard (and succeed, I think) in making their characters actions plausible within the context of the story. Of course, a common criticism of both the film AND the book is that its characters are "unlikeable" and not especially sympathetic, although some are more inclined to empathize with the Colonel and his family, given their plight as refugees and their characteristic dignity and pride.  Others seeing him as part of the Shah's brutally repressive regime might find him more reprehensible than the two principle American born characters, whose "crimes" might be viewed as "small timey" by comparison and their victims mainly themselves.<br /><br />No matter how you slice it, however, the point of great storytelling is not to just evoke sympathy for characters we naturally like anyway.  It's considerably MORE difficult to make the reader or viewer feel compassion for characters we might not be drawn to in real life...ones we might even avoid contact with.  The film version is not quite as successful as the book in evoking that reaction--and plainly, neither the book OR the film won everyone over.  But for those open to it, the story is a strangely compelling one.  It reminds us of just how easily lives can spiral out of control.  In that, this particular tragedy--with its elements of cross-cultural misunderstanding and class and gender conflict--says a good deal about us all.</p></br><a href="../users/A461VTLW9G9YB.html">A461VTLW9G9YB</a><br/><p>This is a wonderful movie. Yes it is quite sad but it has everything a wonderful movie would need. Characters that are not sterotypical or predictable. Moved at a good pace. Wonderful plot and acting by Sir Ben Kingley! I throughly enjoy this film and I will see it again as soon as possible.</p></br><a href="../users/A17JVVAKWEB0M.html">A17JVVAKWEB0M</a><br/><p>Seldom does a casting director find better choices for leads in a film than Jennifer Connelly and Ben Kingsley.  They perfectly capture the essence of the characters so richly detailed in the Dubus novel.<br /><br />As in life, the conflict in The House of Sand and Fog is not the product of good and evil. Rather, disagreement grows between two well-meaning characters whose goals in life can't co-exist. The two main figures, Kathy and Behrani, both lay claim to a house. Each views themselves as righteous and the other as evil (and both are correct from their own point of view). Viewers toggle between the two, as both are sympathetic and both have noble, honest intentions. Kathy loses her home when the tax office makes a mistake and seizes it from her. Behrani buys the house at an auction and re-invents his family's life in the little bungalow. Selling it back to Kathy at the tax office's price would cause him to lose considerable time and investment on the property.<br /><br />The film moves freely between the two characters, with each acting as hero during their "turn" and then being relegated to villain when the other character picks up the narrative.  The film's one fault is its inability to explore the minds of each character.  In the book, the novel was told from the first person point of view of Kathy and Behrani.  This allowed Behrani to discuss his history as an Iranian immigrant and Kathy to talk about her life as a recovering addict.  Without a voice-over narration, all this information is lost.<br /><br />As with the novel, the film's greatest strength is its depiction of the ambiguous nature of "being right". If the film were only Kathy's tale, Behrani would be a Mr. Potter-like capitalist demon, while Behrani's version would depict Kathy as a lazy, irresponsible and illogical American, consistent with those most immigrants encounter after moving to the USA and expecting to see Gary Cooper and June Cleaver in every home. Since both characters are sympathetic, the result creates conflict in the viewer. Who's right? Who should get the house? And at what cost?<br /><br />The rich characters provide a compelling inspection of the nature of human conflict (and a pretty good crash course in real estate foreclosure bureaucracy). After the conflict is established, however, the film becomes a bit too focuses on action and physical drama and goes on a bit too long. I preferred the cerebral clashes of the first part and was a bit disappointed when the blood started to splatter.</p></br><a href="../users/A3MCC5MAJYJYMD.html">A3MCC5MAJYJYMD</a><br/><p>'House of Sand and Fog' is a very sad story.

This is what happens when a recovering addict "forgets" to pay her bills, and three innocent people ending up losing their lives in the process.  It's amazing how her irresponible lifestyle affected others around her, she spun a pretty sticky web.  Her cop boyfriend was no prize either, giving police officers a bad name.  I think he should have had a worse fate than just jail.  Jennifer Connely and Ben Kingsley did great jobs making the story believable, they had me sold.  The ending did the movie justice, I was hoping she didn't end up with the house considering all the damage she caused.  One thing I didn't like is how the movie was spun in her favour, making the Middle Eastern family out to be the villians.  All the while I was thinking, oh here we go again, poor little white girl doesn't get her way so the world should stop and give her what she wants.  This all boils down to a sense of entitlement.  I'm sorry life doesn't work that way, and I'm glad the movie recognized that and had a fit ending to a compelling story.</p></br><a href="../users/A24ZFFRQ4MG3XL.html">A24ZFFRQ4MG3XL</a><br/><p>This was a good movie.

You actually felt very sorry for Ben's character because through no real fault of his own, he suffered great losses with a tragic outcome.  Ron Eldard looked hot in it and was fairly good too.  Jennifer Connelly was a little whiney but overall, this is a good movie and I could understand how some actors were nominated for Oscars</p></br><a href="../users/AAECAHBNP1VD2.html">AAECAHBNP1VD2</a><br/><p>The acting in thie film is superb. At least 3 Oscar-worthy performances (especially Ben Kingsley), and the rest were close as well. That alone is reason to watch this. However as a film, while it's more then compelling -- you need to know how things will wrap up -- it also has an unrealistic/semi-fantastic side that ultimately injures the plot permanently. Not something to watch if you're easily depressed, for sure.</p></br><a href="../users/A2T049UQONS0OY.html">A2T049UQONS0OY</a><br/><p>Here's a fine drama full of good acting but long on anguish and dreariness. Taken from the book of the same name, the story revolves around a dispute about a repossessed home sold to an immigrant family headed by a strong father figure (Ben Kingsley). The homeowner, sexpot turned actress Jennifer Connelley, is wrongfully evicted and seeks to get back her property.<br /><br />The story details her meandering life in eviction and the Greek tragedy of her life -- husband left her, father worked all his life for the home she lost, new boyfriend betrays wife and children to be with her. Meanwhile, the new owner -- an expatriate military leader in the Shah of Iran's regime -- seeks to return to some of the good life his family led in their homeland, in part by getting the house, fixing it up and selling it for a big profit.<br /><br />Unfortunately, no one in this film gets what they want. In fact, they all get more trouble than they want. If their lives were tragic before they met this house of sand and fog, they began to live in utter despair afterward. It should instead be called the house of broken dreams, for its residents have their hopes and lives shattered by involvement with it.<br /><br />The production team interspersed scenes of rapid sky, fog, cloud and sea movement during intervening moments of the drama. This adds to the aura of despair, which is overwhelming during the film's 125 minutes. There is a singular lack of hope and optimism in this movie that will send a lot of viewers home satisfied but unfulfilled.<br /><br />Other fine dramas find a way to send viewers home without this desultory pessimism. One of the finest negative affect dramas ever, 1980's "Ordinary People", found a way to locate optimism at the end even after the mother had left home. Even "The Perfect Storm" found a way to assuage the pain of its stars all perishing at sea with a memorial service for them. They should have done something similar with "House of Sand and Fog" to give viewers a reason to have hope.</p></br><a href="../users/A2U0DKQPZSD50Y.html">A2U0DKQPZSD50Y</a><br/><p>this movie was very interesting and it makes you feel bad for the Iranian family who worked hard and di nothing wrong only to have their lives ruined by a woman to depressed to open the male and her crazy cop boyfriend. A lot of people feel sorry for the woman but I can't see how this movie can really allow them to feel bad for her all of her downfalls were due to her actions and she continues to make mistakes not caring who they may hurt. This story does really make you feel bad for the stories true heros the Iranian family</p></br><a href="../users/A3SFO2GSP5CVSM.html">A3SFO2GSP5CVSM</a><br/><p>Having watched old-time movie serials and pro wrestling for most of my life, as well as soap operas for the last quarter-century I have become something of an expert in the forms of drama and melodrama. The primary difference between the two is that drama is fairly serious and straightforward, and the narrative unfolds over the real reactions of well-developed characters to given situations, whereas melodrama tends to rely on stereotypes, archetypes, and caricatures, and forces climaxes at certain points in a narrative- which is always propelled by the stupidity of the characters. Think of most soap operas- where dumb people foolishly tell deep secrets to those they barely know, and usually someone else is eavesdropping. In true drama- say, Patton, or Ibsen plays, things evolve more naturally out of the events that are portrayed and the protagonists' reactions to them. Of course, sometimes melodrama can rise above its worst tendencies to become drama. In the best of his plays, The Tempest or Hamlet, Shakespeare creates drama out of pure high melodrama, but in his worst- A Midsummer Night's Dream or Titus Andronicus- it's just fifth rate soap opera.<br />  With those definitions in mind, welcome to the horridly melodramatic world of House Of Sand And Fog. This piece of tripe is one of those films like In The Bedroom (ironically penned by the father of this film's novel's author) that start out very well- it's well acted, beautifully filmed, and puts forth an intriguing premise- but falls to unrealistic pieces in the second half.... Also, once the flush of the toilet of the film's credibility begins and you know that the stupidest possible action will result the ending is predictable, no matter how out of character the actions are with the characters' earlier portrayals. Another point that sticks in my craw is that this is the third film in which Connelly is seen musing off the end of a pier- in almost exactly replicated shots- first in Dark City, then in Requiem For A Dream, now this. Why, exactly?  Regardless, like In The Bedroom S&F cheats its audience with its unbelievable and unrealistic end. It's a far worse sort of feeling than viewing a film that was garbage from the first scene, for then you can almost feel a campy glee over the stupidity.<br />  With this bad story I can only scratch my head as to why the filmmakers and company did not change the ending- that's the right and duty of any true filmmaker of merit, to make a story better- no? Obviously, they did not see the gaping flaws because on the DVD's featurette all the actors and filmmakers gush over the horribly written tale. As for the rest, the commentary is likewise banal and asskissy, but the film and sound quality are ok.<br />  Yet, it all comes down to the poor script. This film is even worse than In The Bedroom, though, because as silly and unreal as that ending was at least it was in the realm of possibility due to the darkness of certain characters and events. In S&F we get a virtual bloodbath over a county clerk's screwup. Just silly. If I were to give the first half of the film a solid 75 the second half earns a 5, for a 40 out of a 100 total score. As my dad used to say: Ach du lieber Gott In Himmel! Scratch that- for even God would chuckle at this disaster!</p></br><a href="../users/A2HJB9J5O5CLPB.html">A2HJB9J5O5CLPB</a><br/><p>I'm beginning to believe that Ben Kingsley is from a desert kingdom.  There's sand between my teeth from his recreations of Gandhi, or in this case, one of the Shah's men.  He's very good, and so is Jennifer Connelly who I last saw in an overwrought film that the elitist scum of Hollywood liked, Requiem for a Dream.  Don't bother with that one unless you enjoy dizzy spells and adult toys, but in HOSAF, based on a most un-Hollywood premise, Connelly's sad face is perfect.<br /><br />HOSAF is not a comedy and is not aimed at fifteen-year-olds.  Kingsley is a proud ex-colonel from Iran used to wealth and prestige, but now he is in exile in California.  He wears a suit to work, but changes in a restroom into workers garb, because he is reduced to working as a road-gang, ditch digger and a part-time gas station jockey.  He's saving every penny he makes and wins a house in an auction.  Unfortunately, the County made a mistake and they took the house away from Connelly, a depressed twenty-something, ex-drug abuser.  She should have opened her mail and after eviction, her lawyer and new boyfriend start a campaign to evict the Iranian family.<br /><br />Neither Connelly nor Kingsley is portrayed unsympathetically.  They are fleshed out with pathos.  This is a parable about ethical business and the consequences of our actions.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BT7IC8PT1ZC9.html">A2BT7IC8PT1ZC9</a><br/><p>A friend of  mine recommended this movie to me.

Beautifully acted, directded and photographed, this emotionally draining drama allows us to understand all sides of the conflict.  Kingsley and Connelly are mesmerizing and real.  Aftwer final fade out, the pain of this story lingers.<br /><br />While watching the film, some wiseacre said, "Maybe the Hulk will show up and help his girlfriend."  And I immediately thought of Kingsley in his Ghandi role and pictured the passive Ghandi and The Hulk head to head and lost the train of the movie for a few minutes.<br /><br />Interesting commentary from Kingsley but not Connelly.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FCWRSICTO2AH.html">A1FCWRSICTO2AH</a><br/><p>It's not a big leap to see "House of Sand and Fog" as the best movie of the year.  But the Academy Awards have fallen to such an extent, that it's difficult to take them seriously anymore, unless you want to sift through the nominations for the real gold.  Connelly, Kingsley, and Shohred Aghdashloo all give award worthy performances in a story that has, by its end, enough bodies tragically left on the stage to call up comparisons with Shakespeare or Euripedes.  <p>There are holes in the story - but there are holes in Lear for that matter.  For example, Connelly's (Kathi Niccoli in the film) cop lover (Ron Eldard) is not to be believed in his stupidity.  If his role wasn't so pivotal, it could easily be brushed off.  Further, surrounded by the three main actors, he ends up looking like a deer caught in the headlights.  Then there's the real estate question - it seems a bit of stretch in our super litigious society that a repossession and sale could occur so quickly given a cloud on the title...but I'm nitpicking.  <p>The overwhelming drama of the story far outweighs these problems.  Connelly is superb as the vague and lost house cleaner Kathi.  Her performance has the kind of nuance and depth that I didn't find in her Oscar winning effort in "A Beautiful Mind."  At least Connelly is showing, unlike other recent babe winners (Berry, Roberts, Kidman), she has both the looks and the acting chops.  Kingsley.  What can you say?  The guy is just a great actor who should have a row of Oscars by now. (To get a sense of his range, check out "Sexy Beast.") As the Iranian Colonel Behrani, Kingsley supplies a character that is proud (too proud as it turns out), a lover of tradition, but not so inflexible that he hasn't a heart when the moment calls for it.  He is a good but flawed man who loves his family and is trying to do the best for them.  And finally, there is Shored Aghdashloo's performance as Nadi, a good woman crushed by events.  Nadi's struggles with the language, her kindness to Kathi, the love (and tension) that exists between her and her husband, are all finely balanced and incorporated into a real human being and not another Hollywood cut-out. (Boy did she get ripped off at the Oscars.  I guess her name just wasn't zippy enough.)  Essentially, the heart of "House" is found in the way these three great actors play off of each other.  And it is something special to behold, turning the tragic wheel ever tighter as the movie progresses.  The ending wasn't really a surprise - shock to me, but rather inexorable, much like Medea stringing up her kids.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>"The House of Sand and Fog," easily one of the best movies of 2003, is a haunting and hypnotic tale about how even good, well-intentioned people - through lack of empathy and apparently harmless self interest - can end up hurting others and even themselves without meaning to do so.  It is also about how the most seemingly insignificant events in life can lead to unimaginable tragedies.<p>Based on the novel by Andre Dubus III, "The House of Sand and Fog" stars Jennifer Connelly as Kathy, a young woman battling depression after her husband ran out on her eight months earlier.  One morning, already in the depths of despair, Kathy is informed that she is being evicted from her house for nonpayment of a business tax that she rightfully claims she doesn't owe.  Before the county can rectify the error, it has already placed the house up for auction.  Ben Kingsley plays Behrani, the man who buys the home unaware of its embattled history.  Behrani was a colonel in pre-Khomeini Iran, forced to flee that country with his wife and children when the Shah fell from power.  Now an American citizen, Behrani labors at two low paying jobs to keep his family living as much as possible in the style to which they were accustomed back home.  When Karen's repossessed home goes on the market at a bargain basement rate, Behrani purchases it, hoping to move his family there temporarily, then sell it at market value and move to an even better place.  Thus begins the bizarre conflict between two well meaning but stubborn people, both of whom have a stake in the situation, both of whom are equally victims of the system, and both of whom are determined to come out the winner in this contest of wills. <p>Besides having the most interesting storyline of any movie of recent times, "The House of Sand and Fog" also boasts some of the most interesting characters as well.  Kathy is a beautiful woman who wants desperately to lead a healthy, normal life - she has been working to overcome her addiction to both cigarettes and alcohol - but the fates have simply not been very kind to her of late.  When she realizes that she has become the victim of a bureaucratic bungling, she knows that she must make a stand and fight, fully aware that the people with whom she is contending are as blameless as she is.  In a similar way, Behrani means no harm to anyone, yet he realizes that he too is not to blame for what has happened and resents being made to feel guilty because he is legally trying to make money to ensure a better life for his wife and son.  He also knows that, as an immigrant of Middle Eastern descent, he faces a higher hurdle to mount than white people who were born in this country.  The screenplay does a fine job underlining this subtle attitude of racism, particularly in the third main character, Lester, a sheriff's deputy who comes to care for Karen and who is willing to bend the law some and risk his own career to help her out.  Lester, like the other characters, is also willing to hurt others to ensure his own happiness, even abandoning his wife and two young children to start life anew with Karen.<p>In addition to Connelly and Kingsley, there are superb performances by Ron Eldard as Lester, Jonathan Ahdout as Behrani's teenaged son, and Shohren Aghdashloo as Behrani's wife who is caught between her own strong-willed nature and the traditional role of subservient wife she knows she must play.  Aghdashloo provides some of the movie's most emotionally complex moments and scenes, as she struggles to understand both the events that are taking place around her and what those events say about the character of the man who is her husband.<p>Moreover, "The House of Sand and Fog" is a beautifully written and directed film.  Writer/director Vadim Perelman establishes a lyrical, hypnotic tone through a camera that seems to be forever gliding through and around the scene of action.  The film is so confidently paced and structured that the two main combatants in the story - Karen and Behrani - do not even meet until almost an entire hour of the film has elapsed.  Perelman spends the first sections of the film sketching in the details of the main characters' lives, in order for us to better understand where they are coming from and what it is they want.  It would be so easy in a story like this one to pigeonhole one character as a hero and another as a villain, but the point of the story is that these are just ordinary people who don't want to hurt others but who end up doing so just the same. <p>If the movie becomes a bit more melodramatic in the closing stretches than perhaps is warranted - striving for Shakespearean-type tragedy when a simpler resolution might have sufficed - at least it's TRYING to accomplish something meaningful, which is more than can be said for the vast majority of films these days.  "The House of Sand and Fog" may not be a perfect film, but it comes damn near close.  At the very least, it is a totally mesmerizing experience that is impossible to forget.</p></br><a href="../users/A34D4KCP94ACJZ.html">A34D4KCP94ACJZ</a><br/><p>House of Sand and Fog is a hopeless but convincing tragedy about contested houses and broken pasts. It is morbid and profound enough to keep the riff raff away while also being flat enough to stray from any mainstream. I enjoyed the film for the same reasons critics probably enjoyed it. The film is carried by it's performances first and foremost and almost entirely. One of the more educated knocks on House of Sand and Fog is that the book is simply not really that transferrable toward the movie medium. I never read the book but the film and story stand enough to fuel three of the better performances of that year and also the greatest ensemble considering it's cost.<br /><br />First is Ben Kingsley who plays Colonel Berani, a man who was forced to flee Iran during it's revolution. He sees a similar home in San Franscisco with regards to it's view (in Iran his home oversaw the Caspian Sea beautifully). This new home was recently repossessed from Kathy, played by the beautiful and talented Jennifer Connelly. I genuinely want Connelley to show her range in the future but House of Sand and Fog is not such an environment. Here, Jennifer plays a women ruined by Alcoholism and being ditched by her husband. She then sparks up an affair with a married police officer named Lester, played by Ron Eldred, and the undermining to throw Berani out of the house begins.<br /><br />First time Director Vadim Perleman takes a subtle approach in the differences and similarities between the film's main characters. It was enough to make me walk away from the film wanting more but as if by osmosis the film won me over in perspective only days later. Watching the three main characters tangled in their flaws is enough to keep the film compelling. Berani is too proud and deaf to women, Kathy is too eager and manipulative and Lester is too idealistic and blinded by love. They are all ignorant to one another and completely void of empathy. Nadi is Berani's wife and she is played by the outstanding Shohreh Aghdashloo. Nadi is one of the only really likeable characters, because she is also the only one who sees the other's sides, but she is restrained by her submissiveness and her lack of English. Though heavy handed enough to obtain a brooding feeling that tragedy is inevitable, watching these characters fall is worth the wait if you appreciate this sort of film.<br /><br />Kingsly proves his versatility once again and upstages Connelly in that regard by a long shot. Connelly really just invokes the roles she's been celebrated for before this movie, although she is still quite effective and it revisits her type-casts a bit deeper. It is Aghdashloo that truely stands out and I viewed this film and her performance after the hype with some degree of suspicion. She is excellent.<br /><br />Overall, House of Sand and Fog is a downer. It wasn't as good as I hoped, given both the indie hype prior to it's release and the mainstream hype during and after it's release, but it was still pretty good. The cast alone makes the film worth watching but I would still imagine we will see more from Perleman in the future as well.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R602SXNGOMJ4.html">A1R602SXNGOMJ4</a><br/><p>House of Sand and Fog is a commentary on the cultural gap between American-born citizens and immigrants from war-ridden countries such as Iran. Unfortunately that gap is shown for what it is: wider than ever.<br /><br />The character of Kathy is portrayed brilliantly by Jennifer Connelly as an emotionally unstable young woman caught up in the turmoil of losing both her husband and her family's home within eight months of each other.  Her character is pinned against Ben Kingsley's Colonel Behrani when Behrani buys Kathy's auctioned house in order to return his own family to a sense of stability.  The catalyst for the two characters' conflict with each other is drawn from the supporting character of Officer Lester Burdon (Ron Eldard), a representation of the ignorance and lack of empathy some feel towards people whose lives have led them to seek better ones in the United States. While Behrani's main motive is to protect his family and give it a sense of security, Lester puts his own selfish pleasures before the wellbeing of his own family. Behrani and Lester are complete opposites, Behrani clearly the nobler.  The film shows that there are greater sacrifices in this world than those materialistic in nature.  This type of film truly will tug at your heart and bring tears, yet will give a sense of appreciation for the human life.<br /><br />On a side note, at times I found it difficult to concentrate on this movie because I was distracted by Ron Eldard.  He's very pleasing to the eye ;)</p></br><a href="../users/A9TG2NFA614S9.html">A9TG2NFA614S9</a><br/><p>"House of Sand and Fog" is a shocker of a movie. The clashes of the American and Iranian cultures are made all too real as a young woman (Jennifer Connelly) battles a former Iranian colonel (Ben Kingsley) over her repossessed house which he had bought at auction. To say that Sir Ben overacts might be too strong, but he sure does emote and he is very intense, yes, very intense. His face can be very grim and fierce at times.<br />Connelly plays a self-indulgent brat who because of addiction issues didn't keep track of the county mail that was coming to her warning her of repossession. Ben wants to flip the house and get something better. The house has a beautiful view of the sea, reminding Ben, his wife and teenage son of the beautiful view of the Caspian Sea they had before they were forced to flee Iran.<br /> A bent deputy sheriff, who is a bigot, a self-indulgent boy-man, falls for Jennifer and comes to her aid, threatening Ben with deportation even though he's an American citizen. He's the one who precipitates the tragedy.<br />This drama is told in very realistic terms; the acting is fine, and it will have an impact upon you as you view it. The story is set up almost like a Greek tragedy; there's an inevitability about the situation and the working out of the plot. Everything seems so simple, but because Ben and Jennifer are so relentless and single-minded, there is no easy way out. With emotions running so high, anything is apt to happen. The ending will leave most viewers shaken.</p></br><a href="../users/A3IDMLOWLHWNDJ.html">A3IDMLOWLHWNDJ</a><br/><p>Powerhouse film, starring Jennifer Connelly, Ben Kingsley, and Ron Eldard, that has enough twists and turns with a sudden tragic ending that will leave the intelligent viewer stunned.<p>  Connelly is a young women freshly evicted from her home due to a property tax payment mix up. Due to this mix up, the town puts the house up for sale and is quickly bought by an Iranian family, led by Kingsley. Connelly fights to get the house back but Kingsley isn't easily swayed, especially after he builds a roof deck addition to the house that overlooks the ocean. Whats worse, he also gets the house appraised, making the house three times more valuable than what it once was without the improvements. Connelly continues her fight and gets support from the sheriff (Eldard) who evicted her (they have a major league affair). The events afterwards are quite stunning as all involved spiral downward in a pit of mixed emotions. <p>  The performances are outstanding. Kingsley is one of the best and possibly most underated actors out there today. Connelly gives one of her best roles to date. Eldard takes a break from his so-so comedic roles and is great as the confused sheriff who gets in way over his head. One of the best films from 2003, this &quot;House&quot; won't leave you in the fog.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZTSOBAPOWT3.html">A1ZTSOBAPOWT3</a><br/><p>"House of Sand and Fog" sounds like it would be a haunted house movie with ghosts and zombies, but it's a very deep drama that pulls you in and doesn't let go. Kathy (goddess Jennifer Connelly) was a recovering alcoholic whose house was evicted since she didn't pay her taxes. If only she checked her mail! Behrani (Ben Kingsley) was an Iranian colonel who fled to America in search of a better life for his family. With so many opportunities in the United States, the ex-colonel struggled with his road construction and sales clerk jobs. Since Kathy's house was evicted, it went up for auction and Behrani purchased the home for a low price. Thinking that the new bungalow with its ocean view would be a great place to start again, Kathy fights to regain her home. Once a bird flies away, there is no more life. The movie is very powerful and you really can't choose a side. They both NEED the home. For real, this movie will leave you shocked and it will surprise you. I truly believe it was robbed of numerous award nominations. It is extremely powerful and it's one of the best movies I've seen.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6X0DAM87GN4.html">A3C6X0DAM87GN4</a><br/><p>When I first heard about this movie I didn't want to see it. The story-line seemed too lite. I didn't think it would be able to sustain my interest. Then the reviews came in, and the public reaction, and the award nominations, and soon I had to see what all the fuss was about.<p> Directed by Vadim Perelman "House of Sand and Fog" is an emotional and visual masterpiece. The movie doesn't just create characters, it breathes life into them and makes them seem real. The screenplay by Perelman and Shawn Lawrence Otto based on a novel by Andre Dubus II does something pretty fascinating. To give you a vague idea the movie has Jennifer Connelly and Ben Kingsley fighting over who is the rightful owner of a house. The house was given to Connelly after her father died, but, when back taxes are not paid she is evicted and soon the house is up for auction. It is Kingsley, an Iranian immigrant who buys the house. And so the feud starts. But, the movie is able to present both sides to us. We can see what the house means for both sides. For Connelly it's a rememberance of her past, for Kingsley it means looking forward to the future. Our emotions keep shifting back and forth. We feel sorry for everyone involved and after a while we don't know what to think.<p> The acting in this movie has been getting a lot of attention, and righfully so, but as I watched this movie Roger Deakins' (who usually works with the Coen Brothers) cinematography caught my eye. He is able to get such beautiful shots along with David Stockton.<p> But I suppose it is the acting that will get people into the seats to watch this movie. Connelly after her performance in "A Beautiful Mind" keeps up her winning streak. I can't reveal too much about her character other than saying she's a "lost soul". She just seems to be on the wrong track. To many it is a disappointment she didn't receive an Oscar nomination. Kingsley on the other hand is kind of the cliche "tough as nails" sterotype idea we have of the kind of character he is playing. But it is effective.<p> Vadim Perelman has directed a powerful absorbing masterpiece. The movie seems real. When it was over everyone in the theather was kind of numb. As the credits rolled no one wanted to get up. We all just wanted to sit down and think about what we had seen. How many movies can we say that about? This is one of the best movies of 2003.<p> Bottom-line: Easily one of the most powerful absorbing and interesting working in 2003. Wonderful performance given by this entire cast. Everyone shines. Perelman directs with a sure-fired hand. He bring these characters to life.</p></br><a href="../users/A2DSXA1E02C86D.html">A2DSXA1E02C86D</a><br/><p>Penn, Crowe, Murray, Hopkins and the rest that might think they deserve the Best Actor Oscar for the 2003 film year, forget it. The most deserving of that honor, Ben Kingsley, is right here in THE HOUSE OF SAND AND FOG, a story of three lives that collide like a 3-way train wreck.<p>Kingsley is Massoud Amir Behrani, a former colonel in the service of the Iranian Shah. Forced to flee the country after the fall of the monarch, Behrani now works two jobs - convenience store clerk by night and road maintenance worker by day - to try and stem the slow drain of his savings being spent on the expensive lifestyle that his wife Nadi (Shohreh Aghdashloo) is used to. Perusing the paper, he sees an moneymaking opportunity in the public auction of a house confiscated by the county to pay back taxes. Massoud intends to buy the place on the cheap, fix it up, and sell it at the going market rate. Behrani is a proud man determined to regain his self-respect and the Good Life for his family. By maintaining a facade of affluence, he's already managed to marry his daughter off to another wealthy and respectable Iranian emigre. Now, he needs to put his son Esmail (Jonathan Ahdout) through college. <p>Unfortunately, the home is owned by Kathy Nicolo (Jennifer Connelly), who inherited it from her father eight months previous. Kathy is a recovering alcoholic, who failed to deal with the county bureaucracy when she had the chance, and now it's too late to stop the sale. She's evicted, has nowhere to go, no friends, no nearby family, no money, and is truly on the edge.<p>Into this volatile mix comes Lester Burdon (Ron Eldard), who's the police deputy assigned the uncomfortable task of tossing Nicolo into the street. Burdened by a marriage gone bad, Lester is seduced by Kathy's beauty and vulnerability, and he becomes her champion to the exclusion of common sense and professionalism. (With men, what else is new?)<p>Burdon aside, who's basically a fool guided by his gonads, the viewer will have to decide whom to back - Massoud or Kathy - because this intelligently scripted film doesn't favor one over the other even as the confrontation escalates beyond all bounds of rationality. There's no Hero or Villain. But for good fortune and good toilet training, you or I could be in either position.<p>In emotional intensity, even Sean Penn's performance in MYSTIC RIVER can't match Kingsley's here. There's a scene towards the end in a local hospital that'll knock your socks off, and for which alone Kingsley deserves Best Actor.<p>HOUSE OF SAND AND FOG is one of the very best films of 2003, and deserves an Oscar nomination for Best Picture.</p></br><a href="../users/A38UBVJEV1LLS7.html">A38UBVJEV1LLS7</a><br/><p>I was not so enthusiastic about seeing this movie because of the "curse" that seems to haunt the genre - that being good acting, but a questionable film as a whole ("Monster's Ball," "In the Bedroom," etc...).  The fact is that these movies feel like they were created with the soul purpose of winning Oscars thus a lot of the magic falls deaf on the viewer. I approached "House of Sand and Fog" with this same mentality, expecting a good acting job, but a boring film; however, I am happy to report that this stereotype fell flat on its face. I have never read the book and so I did not know what to expect, but what I got was twist after twist that took me on a whirlwind flight of beauty and pain. At first, the movie seemed a little silly (how Jennifer's character behaved was a little over the top and selfish) and boring, but it morphed into a simply magnificent tale of love and loss. The really great thing though was the plot twist that occurred and how the story throws one back and forth (do I love this character or hate him/her).  It is not until the end that one can even begin to digest what has happened.  <p>Not only was the storyline fantastic, but the acting was phenomenal! Jennifer and Ben were simply fantastic, but the real "show stealer" was newcomer Shohreh Aghdashloo; oh my she was so wonderful and heartbreaking. By the end I can promise that you will cry (at least inside) more than you ever have for a movie; the people seem so real and personal to you (every one of them). I am absolutely appalled that this film did not pick up a single Oscar and very few nominations!<p>This film is a wonderful Drama and so much more. I have never been so drawn in by a cast and story before. I would recommend this to any "Art" loving individual that appreciates the fragileness of life and the human spirit. I do not usually write long reviews but this film deserves pages and pages of praise. Just watch and you will understand that the hype is well deserved.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L8HRCM60W0W7.html">A1L8HRCM60W0W7</a><br/><p>Like Michael Caine, Ben Kingsley is a master of the unspoken. The subtleties of his facial expressions presented in moments of either joy or frustration are so masterfully restrained, it's a pleasure simply to watch him! <p>In "House of..," he plays an ex Iranian militiary man now working menial jobs in the US. It's probably a predicament that we rarely think about -- perhaps we'd prefer not -- and it's certainly a subject that Hollywood would rather brush by. But Perelman's film, based on Andre Dubus III's 1999 best seller, not only corrects this social/artistic delinquency but does it in such a bold and imaginative way and with such driving force that "House of Sand and Fog" works as much as a potent entertainment as it does as a morality play.<p>I haven't seen much of Jennifer Connelly before, but her absolutely knock-out presence on the screen as a murky character with an alcoholic past is dazzling. When the characters of Kingsley and Connelly finally clash halfway through the film, the film, having until then been a paean to silence and unspoken loyalties, becomes a terrifying thriller, riveting everyone with whom I saw the picture. Perelman moves from a mood piece to a suspenseful drama effortlessly. A jaw-dropping conclusion completes a powerful, unbelievably sad piece of work.<p>It's a harrowing story, cathartic and elegant, beautifully filmed, stirringly told. It will toy with your emotions and work them into a frenzy. What a splendid accomplishment for a first-time director. <p>Highly recommended!</p></br><a href="../users/A1YQ6QB2127AJ4.html">A1YQ6QB2127AJ4</a><br/><p>&quot;House of Sand And Fog&quot; is a very compelling movie released in 2003, starring Oscar winners Jennifer Connelly and Ben Kingsley.

It brilliantly combines two lives that later meet: a woman who's life is tumbling downward after having been evicted from her house and an Iranian family who buys that house only as an investment.  The emotional impact is never held back for a moment, which continually builds as the struggles become more intense.  Later, it becomes more than a film about a woman trying to move back into her house.  Its unique chain of events keep audiences awaiting for what happens next.  The Oscar-nominated original score wonderfully accompanies the scenery.<p>Ben Kingsley and Shohreh Aghdashloo give wonderful Oscar nominated performances (Best Actor/ Best Supporting Actress).  Their characters' passions and hardtimes are expressed beautifully.  Kingsley proves that he's continually evolved as an actor through his entire career.  Jennifer Connelly gives a heartpounding performance, especially through her character's life threatening struggles.  All other actors also offer captivating performance.<p>&quot;House of Sand And Fog&quot; is a powerful film that will continue to attract audiences.  This offers an unforgettable viewing experience for everyone.</p></br><a href="../users/A23QOAXJSWIBS6.html">A23QOAXJSWIBS6</a><br/><p>The Dispossessed<br />Early into the film I said to myself, "This is not going to end well." This movie, while dark, is deeply laden with symbolism and pathos and a relentless sense of impending doom. More than just a lament of the human condition, this is a meditation upon possessions and the fear of losing them that drives many of us to desperation. The house represents many different things to the different characters, but trying to possess the house and protect it spells disaster for all - those who fight for it and those caught in the crossfire.  The film borders on horror at times in that it exposes the fear and the despair that lead to murder and suicide.<p>The Colonel is at once the most malevolent but also the most tragic figure here. He realizes his hubris, but only too late. How many of our lives are marked by lies, keeping up appearances and desperate acts. Watch this film for nothing else than the phenomenal performances to which the Oscar nominations should attest. These are the roles of their careers for Kingsley and Connelly. Not for those who like light, tidy cinema. This film is profound and tragic. Only Kathy walks away from the house any wiser.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FTHCGH06O4Y5.html">A2FTHCGH06O4Y5</a><br/><p>Lord, this is a fine movie:  exquisitely directed and peerlessly acted.  Its nightmarish script fearlessly puts the characters into what must have been extraordinarily difficult-to-write scenes and does not cop out.<br /><br />Sadly, I hated it.  Perhaps I was not expecting to be so thoroughly excoriated, for the whole thing is like watching a train wreck.  All of these people messing up their lives (especially the cop) -- sheesh!  I had to keep stopping it about every five minutes just to cool off and yell at the TV set!<br /><br />I must say the filmmakers did a superb job with the aspects of Iranian culture that found their way into the film:  very convicing.  All the actors who speak Farsi are clearly Iranian, and even the furniture in the house is bona fide Isfahan.  The only off-note is Kingsley's frequently horrendous pronunciation, which, given the amount of time he reportedly devotes to developing his roles, is something he should be faulted with.<br /><br />One thing that kind of annoyed me about the movie was the realization, about midway through, that the tax angle of it didn't make any sense.<br /><br />If the woman owed $500 in taxes on a $100,000+ home and the government really did seize it in order to pay the bill, the woman would have then been given about $99,500 in change, meaning that she wouldn't have had to sleep in her car and could have hired a proper lawyer.  When this dawned on me, the rest of the movie lost a lot of its punch.<br /><br />Lastly, I don't think the fog motif worked very well:  it was heavy-handed and annoying.</p></br><a href="../users/AIMR915K4YCN.html">AIMR915K4YCN</a><br/><p>My taste runs more toward the macabre. I am a horror nut. However, movies do come along that drag me out of my comfort zone, forcing me to try something different. HOUSE OF SAND AND FOG is this type of movie. The name Jennifer Connelly (Phenomena, The Labyrinth, Requiem For A Dream, Dark City) was what drew me to this tragic tale of stubborn indignation and desolating pride. She is a wonderful actress, starring in many personal favorites. Here, Ms. Connelly's character faces off w/ Ben Kingsley (Gandhi, Schindler's List, Species) in a duel of wills that leads only to destruction. Two people battle over possession of a house. Both are right in their own way, and certainly in their own determined minds. Who will blink first? Who will submit? As with all such wars, each side believes its own propaganda. Each warrior sees him / herself as the righteous one, taking on an insane, evil aggressor. Locked in a struggle to the bitter end, these two will not relent until the war is won. Unfortunately, there can be no winner. There will only be anguish, criminality, and senseless death. Such is war, large or small...</p></br><a href="../users/A38YUU4J5Q4EJO.html">A38YUU4J5Q4EJO</a><br/><p>I don't know how I let this  movie slip past me all this time, but I am glad I finally saw (and purchased) it.<br />The story is a battle over a house, that, in the beginning belongs to Cathy (Jennifer Connelly's character), and was passed on to her by her Father.<br /><br />A mistake in the system concerning a "buisness" tax causes her eviction.<br />She hires a Lawyer, but before she can reclaim her home, The County auctions  it to a Colonal Berani(Ben Kingsly)  and his Wife and Son.( A very decent and proud Iranian family)<br /><br />The entire story is about the battle that persists between the woman Cathy, and the new owners.I don't want to give too much of the movie away, but I will say that Connelly's and Kingsly's acting is SUPERB ! - There was one scene with Connelly in her car where she broke down, and her vulernability was heartbreaking.<br />Kingsleys character also touched me deeply when he so unashamedly laid out his soul in prayer for his Son in the Hospital waiting room.<br /><br />BOTH characters we see exposed, naked, and bleeding, and we FEEL that..we feel FOR them, and that is GREAT acting.Everyone in the movie did a wonderful and convincing job and really breathed LIFE into these characters.<br /><br />One thing I found interesting was that it was impossible to take "sides" in this because BOTH parties were right.( although in the beginning I did side with Connelly's character)<br />I do not understand why this masterpiece did not win any Oscars.<br />It surely deserved to.<br />This is one of those movies that will stay with you for a long time.<br />The ending will shock you, and take your breath away!</p></br><a href="../users/AW4MT9WP95TVD.html">AW4MT9WP95TVD</a><br/><p>I did not think I would like this film.  Before I finally saw it, there was just something about it that reeked of pretension.  Not sure why, but that's how I felt.  When I finally did get around to seeing it, I was blown away.  So tragic in a stupid, senseless, pridefull way that it really hit me hard.  Entertaining - not really.  Riveting -yes.  The performances here are amazing. A real actors' film - similar to the way I reacted to Mystic River.  It made me angry, depressed, sad - and I could not stop watching it.  The biggest win for me was the fact that all of the characters were in a way stupid or blinded by their experiences, the environment, the timing of the situation, laziness - all of that and more.  In fact, I did not and could not root for anyone, but I still understood them all.  Pride, tradition, self-destruction, sloth, and anger all add up to tragic consequences.  Not a movie I would watch again for entertainment value - but it packs a punch.</p></br><a href="../users/ASJ89T42CIUHU.html">ASJ89T42CIUHU</a><br/><p>I had previously read the book, &quot;House of Sand and Fog&quot; and was passionately impressed. Needless to say I held high hopes for the movie and can honestly say I was not disappointed in any way.<p>Jennifer Connelly plays, Kathy, a depressed hopeless woman who suffers loss after loss until she breaks. Sir Ben Kingsley gives a masterful performance as an Iranian man who has had all of his cultural wealth taken from him prior to arriving in the US. You are torn between rights and wrongs in this film and unlike most stories you are allowed to see two sides. Most stories thrive on good vs. evil, here you are unable to decide and the twists that occur leave you wishing you could help both parties. You will cry at the pride and at the despair of human beings facing choices that bind them for life. Brilliant!!</p></br><a href="../users/A17FLA8HQOFVIG.html">A17FLA8HQOFVIG</a><br/><p>The theme of this story is one of constant contrasts.  Ben Kingsley stars as Behrani, an Iranian man living in California.  He was wealthy in Iran and he and his family escaped with their lives.  They've been in America a few years and the wealth they formerly had is fast being depleted.  Behrani works at two jobs - a laborer by day and a convenience store clerk by night.  He saves his money and buys a house at auction.  He thinks his troubles are over.  But they are just beginning.<p> <p>Jennifer Connolly is cast as Kathy, the young woman was evicted from the house that Behrani buys. She's been abandoned by her husband, works cleaning houses for a living, and just can't seem to keep her life together.  She's also a former drug addict who is easily tempted by alcohol.  Devastated by the eviction, she vows to get her house back.  This is a perfect formula for trouble.<p> <p>The acting is perfect.  And the direction and cinematography are excellent.  Some of the shots were able to show in a few seconds what it took pages and pages to bring out in the book.  It's an ultimately sad story and I remember how upset I was while reading the book.  But watching the film, I actually wept.  There's something about the media of film that could do that.  The book had more detail and background.  But ultimately, it's the story that touched my heart.<p> <p>Don't miss this film.  It's a tear-jerker, but it is great!</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJPMB7N776WS.html">A1TJPMB7N776WS</a><br/><p>Andre Dubus' novel on which Vadim Perelman bases his film, "The House of Sand and Fog" is a masterful, subtle, frightening parable about how we Americans  take our freedoms for granted and how it often takes someone from a country with few or no freedoms to shake us up, wake us up to all that we have here. Ben Kingsley as Behrani says it succinctly when he compares we Americans to children, always looking for the next thrill, the next sweet, the next thing to excite us, the next thing to keep us occupied and interested (paraphrase).<br />But whereas Dubus' novel is spare, direct and to the point, Perelman's film sometimes strays into melodrama, especially in the film's third act when the action gets too contrived and almost veers into silliness. But the epilogue is so strong, so poignant, so well acted by all that you soon forgive "The House of Sand and Fog" it's foibles.<br />Ben Kingsley's performance is a wonder. As Behrani he plays a powerful man forced out of Iran with his wife and children only to work two menial jobs in the U.S. to support his family. He is proud yet cunning, saving his money when he can, always looking for ways to improve his lot. Behrani is a man who ultimately pays for his pride in the worst possible ways, yet he accepts his fate with dignity and courage. His fall from grace is not noble, but it is understandable.<br />Jennifer Connolly as Kathy is one of the walking wounded. She is everything that Behrani is not: driven by her emotions, unable to act, overcome and unable to get passed her recent divorce, really a mass of raw exposed nerve endings. Kathy doesn't even have the wherewithal to take advantage of her beauty and her natural allure. She is so unaware, stripped of all confidence that she is a victim of her beauty.<br />"The House of Sand and Fog" is a gorgeous film to look at and Perelman uses the Northern California locales as a physical manifestation of his characters emotional state: densely foggy, bone chilling cold when emotions are in upheaval and difficult to read and brightly sunlight when things are straightforward and clear, which is not much of the time.<br />Don't visit "The House of Sand and Fog" looking for a surgically precise world free of contradiction, you won't find it. Instead, you will find a world in conflict, a world full of compromise, a world heaving and erupting from the conflict of the have and the have-nots, the confident and prideful versus the tragically lost.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>One interesting thing about 'House of Sand and Fog' is that the film in its opening credits, quite unaccountably, put the name of Jennifer Connelly BEFORE that of Ben Kingsley.  What a strange order, for the strength of the film, which often is marred by clithed direction and improbable story, all comes unmistakeably from Ben Kingsley's powerful acting.<br /><br />The story is quite unbelievable, at least that's what I thought.  Because of some mistakes, one American woman Kathy (Connelly) and one Iranian father (formerly a colonel in his country) Behrani fight over the legal right of ownership of one old house by the seaside.  Kathy, evicted from the home, sticks to her house (her father's house), or the memories attached to it while Beharani, having paid the money, needs it to settle down in this new country.<br /><br />The point of the film is not about the legal side; it's about the characters, all flawed, but all too human.  While there is a better way out for the both parties, and perhaps they know it, they commit many mistakes because of their pride, or obsession, and finally come to the point where there is no turning back.<br /><br />Now, the good thing about the film is its nuance in characters.  They are complex, round, and mostly believable, owing to great acting from Ben Kingsley and Shohreh Aghdashloo as the ex-colonel's wife.  Aghdashloo, herself born in Iran, not only gives credibility to the melodramatic story, but also represents the compassionate, and fragile side of the immigrants coming to America, where little is familiar to them.  And as to masterful performance of Ben Kingsley, what can I add?<br /><br />If Jennifer Connelly pales away beside these two veterans, that is not because her acting is inadequate -- she is perhaps better than in 'Beautiful Mind' -- but because her role, and the sub-plot about the love affair with a local cop (Ron Eldard), are too weak, bleak, and unnecessary.  (And I still suspect that her Oscar winning was a fluke.)<br /><br />THE MOST REGRETTABLE PART OF THE FILM is its ending, or how it comes to there.  Again, we see a familiar plot device -- gun.  After the very emotionally intense and spellbinding scenes, the film allows the B-Hollywood action film clithes to creep into the situation, and blows up the credible tone completely.  The film director (and first-time at that) Vadim Perelman really wanted a tradegy, so HE creates one, disregarding consistency.  Why should the characters act like that, who up until then have been so credible?<br /><br />Among the mediocre direction of the film, you see astounding acting from the two actors -- Kingsley and Aghdashloo.  And the photography of Roger Deakins is another merit of the film.  And the name of Deakins reminds me of the Coen Brothers, who could have made this film much a more plausible and powerful one than it is now.</p></br><a href="../users/AWPODHOB4GFWL.html">AWPODHOB4GFWL</a><br/><p>Director Vadim Perelman has constructed a film of dashed hopes and human errors amid beautiful scenery and fantastically understated acting.  Kathy Niccoli (Jennifer Connelly) is three years into `recovery' but is still too lazy to get out of bed or to open her mail.  What results is the ignored tax notice, which causes her to lose her house.  Colonel Behrani, his wife Nadi (a fantastic Shoreh Aghdashloo) and their teenage son are eking out a living with menial jobs after the high ranking Colonel gets ousted from Iran.  Seeing this as a great opportunity, the Colonel buys the house and settles in for the American dream.  His troubled past seems behind him.  Kathy meanwhile encounters a love struck policeman with his own family troubles who offers to help her win her house back.  The tensions start to rise and we soon realize this is going to possibility be a stalemate at best.  With five people trying to save their lives and their loved ones, there can only be losers and that is what Director Perelman gives us.  You can take all the best acting in the world, but the end result of this film is fives lives more than ruined simply by the lazy selfishness of one recovering drug addict.  It's Shakespearean in tone and ends on an unexpected note of pathetic hopelessness.  It is still worth the viewing, believe it or not.</p></br><a href="../users/A35YWA2V4QHOJ3.html">A35YWA2V4QHOJ3</a><br/><p>This is a painful reminder of what can happen when the law of unintended consequences follows in-step with what would seem to be a banal clerical error.  Lives become unraveled in ways you could hardly imagine.  <p>The story details a house owned by a young woman (played by Jennifer Connelly).  Somehow, she is pinged for not paying a business tax (which she does not owe).  After ignoring her mail, the house is re-possessed.  Within a day it is auctioned off to an Iranian family (the head of the household is played by Ben Kingsley).  <p>The balance of the film portrays  the heart-wrenching obstacles that she must go through to try and get her house back.  In short, the whole ordeal is a legal and logistical mess.<p>One of the most salient aspects of the film is that there are no real villains in it.  We never see the clerk(s) who screwed up in the 1st place.  The personages in the film are all basically good people, but are driven to take desperate action when the legal apparatus fails to resolve the situation.<p>The acting is top notch, and is worth the price of the DVD alone.  I've always thought that Ben Kingsley was an under-rated actor, and he shines in perhaps his most powerful performance.  Jennifer Connolley is an outstanding actress who has the most passionate eyes I have ever seen in my life.<p>If ever there were a Real Estate deal gone awry that could be elevated to the realm of a Shakespearian tragedy, this is it.  The movie is not for the feint of heart as it is actually physically painful to view.  It is depressing with an emotional poignancy I've not experienced in a long, long time.  In short, it is a Masterpiece.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>HOUSE OF SAND AND FOG is one of those films that visualizes a fine novel, adds the luxuries of fine acting, atmospheric cinematography, and yet in the end the whole is much better than the sum of its parts.  For those who have not read the book or seen Director Vadim Perelman's excellent adaptation I would refer you to the several excellent plot outlines supplied on the product page for this movie.  Simply put, this is a story at whose core is a house whose ownership triggers reactions from everyone in the tale.  The sensitivity of Dubus' novel and Perelman's adaptation lies in the way the similarities of each of the characters are essentially laid on a flat line of synergy.  A house is bequeathed to girl who has nothing but a lineage claim to the structure which is usurped by the government in a technical error, sold at auction to an Iranian man living with his wife and son in a strange land without any of the amenities of his previous life as a dignitary in Iran.  The middleman in this contested house is a deputy whose longing to leave his own life of complacency for a taste of passion he has never known.  Everybody is basically needy, grasping for some semblance of security, meaning, and ownership.  It all is built on sand and is as elusive as fog.  Each is driven to ends thought inconceivable and yet there is finally a sense of just what it is to be an isolated human on this globe that can be unkind.<p>Ben Kingsley surpasses past achievements as Behrani, a man of such bruised pride and longing for substance that he fosters his own descent into hopelessness.  Jennifer Connelly once again proves that her spectrum of acting is ever-widening as she makes Kathy a credible victim with a crusted heart of forgiveness.  Ron Eldard allows us to see inside his Deputy and feel his longings even though we may not side with his choices.  Iranian actress Shohreh Agdashloo is powerful as the fully realized wife for Behrani and her responses to all of the incidents are heart-wrenchingly beautiful.  Young Jonathan Ahdout is unforgettable as Behrani's son.  Walking out of this film the audience is stunned not only by the ending, but also by the realization of how fragile we all are as global neighbors and how that in the end gestures of kindness will be all that will allow us to survive.  You cannot ask more from a film than this.</p></br><a href="../users/A1RECBDKHVOJMW.html">A1RECBDKHVOJMW</a><br/><p>Vadim Perelman, in his directorial debut, has created an extraordinarily powerful drama with &quot;The House Of Sand And Fog.&quot; Award-winning actors Jennifer Connelly and Ben Kingsley give truly great performances in this dark and tragic film of the American Dream turned nightmare. Shohreh Aghdashloo, as Kingelsy's wife Nadi, and Jonathan Ahdout as his teenage son Esmail, are also superb. And cinematographer Roger Deakins stunning photography sets the mood throughout the film.<br /><br />Persian immigrant, Massoud Amir Behrani, (Ben Kingsley), is a former colonel in the late, deposed Iranian Shah's air force. He is an intelligent, well educated man, who used to be respected in his native country as a person of position, power, and means. Behrani's former life, with all his efforts to build it, seems like it was constructed on a sea of shifting sand. He came to America with his wife, son, and daughter with limited funds, and has spent almost all of his money setting his family up in the manner to which they had been accustomed. One of the primary reasons for doing this was to marry his daughter to a member of their former social class. He is now reduced to working as a common laborer by day and a convenience store manager by night in order to provide for his family. His co-workers are men he would have given alms to in his native land. Angry and humiliated at how far he has fallen, Behrani decides to invest his remaining funds in a house that has been put up for auction at a Sheriff's Sale, because the owner had not paid property taxes. He wants to make improvements on the house and sell it at a large profit, which he hopes will enable him to provide his family with their former lifestyle, and restore some of his lost dignity. <p>Kathy Niccolo is a disaster waiting to happen. She is a depressed, quietly self-destructive, recovering alcoholic and addict. Her house, in the California hills overlooking the Pacific, was bequeathed to her and her brother by her beloved father. It is all she has. She is adamant in her refusal to give-up her home because of a bureaucratic error. She was evicted for failing to pay a tax she never should have been charged in the first place. However, with her usual carelessness, she ignored a number of correspondences and warnings from the local tax board. <p>Sheriff Lester Burdon, (Ron Eldard), delivers the eviction papers to Kathy. She confides in him and he becomes obsessed with helping her fight for justice. Lester finds himself falling in love with Kathy, although he is married with two children and much personal baggage of his own. <p>The contested ownership of the house is the fulcrum of the intense plot. Two people compete with increasing desperation, for the title to one small bungalow, which has a different meaning for each of them. The tragedy lies in their inability to communicate and understand one another. Part of the movie's incredible power is the difficulty one has in deciding which party to side with, as both are at once sympathetic and worthy of censure. <p>The film is absolutely riveting and the tension builds to a surprising climax. To say that &quot;The House of Sand and Fog&quot; is not upbeat entertainment is a major understatement. So, although I give the movie my highest recommendation, I do so with reservations. Prospective viewers should be cautioned that the grim intensity of this piece will stay with you for a very long time. Definitely not a films to see twice.<br />JANA</p></br><a href="../users/AGQY11NLQJ2JL.html">AGQY11NLQJ2JL</a><br/><p>Have you ever lost everything you worked for and your life became focused only on restoring your legacy? Have you been extremely depressed that even opening your mail became an extraordinarily difficult task? Has fate treated you so horribly that you keep going in circles without a chance to catch your breath? Has your life revolved around one thing, and one thing only, that without it, you started to lose your existential footing? If you never experienced despair before, or your intellect is a shallow lake, you might miss the point of this movie and judge it harshly like many reviewers. On the other hand, you might be lucky enough to understand the real meaning of life and empathize with each and every character in this movie. I thought no movie could replicate the greatness and depth of the book, but with phenomenal performances by all and equally fantastic direction, this movie captures the essence of the book and lead you down a deep well of insight and intense feeling.  Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/AJMU8VVFKMZI4.html">AJMU8VVFKMZI4</a><br/><p>4.5 stars.  I don't know what I was expecting when I popped this movie in the old dvd player, but it wasn't this.  A simple mistake sets off an incredible domino effect that leds to a stunning ending.  There's no way the audience can take sides because both parties are in the right.  I think the only character that was missing a serious amount of marables was Deputy Burdon.  Nothing this man did made sense and it is more him than the two opposing parties that escalates this bad situation into a colossal mess.  Whenever I thought his character was doing something holy unbelievable, I'd think about the stories that sometimes makes the ten o'clock news. (Kiddnapping, diaper-wearing astronaunts anyone?)  But what makes this film a winner is the remarkable performance by Kingsley.  Connelly, though beautiful, always seem to sleep walk through her performances.  They're not horrible, but not very memorable.  That includes A Beautiful Mind.  When I think of that Oscar vehicle, it's not her character that sticks out, it's Crowe.<br />Back to this movie, House of Sand and Fog, is a a good film and is truely worth your time, but be prepared to be a little depressed when the credits roll.</p></br></body></html>

OK the plot is pretty bad, it has a rubbish ending and it may be a touch too long (all reasons for my 3 stars), but it wasn't trying to win any Oscars and is a fun, fairly innocuous, way to spend an afternoon. There are some funny moments, loads of action scenes and plenty of eye candy for the boys and girls. Some people seem to rate this film based against all others ever made, in that contest it will never win. But as an example of light entertainment it doesn't do too badly. Not brilliant, but not terrible either. Worth spending an afternoon watching when you don't want to think too hard.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></br><a href="../users/A3OXHLG6DIBRW8.html">A3OXHLG6DIBRW8</a><br/><p>"Mr. And Mrs. Smith" is an enjoyable and very watchable action flick that also has a lot very funny scenes interspersed through out. This review is for the "R" rated Amazon OnDemand version.<br /><br />No plot spoilers from me: The movie centers on a typical upper-middle class couple living a seeming normal life in suburbia, but both leading double lives as assassins. The pace of the movie starts out a little slowly, but picks up as their relationship and work lives begin to collide.<br /><br />There is definite on screen chemistry between Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie and that goes a long way to compensate for some of the slower scenes and occasionally hokey situations.<br /><br />This is not a very deep movie, but it is a good choice when looking for a lot of action, a little romance, and a laugh or two.<br /><br />Recommended!<br /><br />CFH</p></br><a href="../users/A1O60Q7LBN4MQ.html">A1O60Q7LBN4MQ</a><br/><p>My husband and I thought it was smart and sexy! Personally, I don't care about all the relationships that came out of this movie (or relationships that were broken). It's none of our business as movie watchers. There is a good chemistry between the two of them and that's what made this a better than average film.</p></br><a href="../users/ADE852UR9121C.html">ADE852UR9121C</a><br/><p>This is THE movie. The movie that supposedly broke up Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston. The movie that lingered in the background of the countless tabloid articles that graced our newstands. The movie that brought Brad Pitt together with Angelina Jolie and her kids. In fact, so many things have been surrounding this movie that people tend to miss one very important thing...simply put, this movie ROCKS!<br /><br />The movie's premise is pretty straightforward. A couple's marriage is on the rocks. But the fact that eludes both of them is that they are both assassins. One day however, Jane is asked to kill a target, that John is supposed to kill as well. They then learn the true identity of each another and because their cover is blown, are ordered to eliminate each other. The story ensues...<br /><br />The story is pretty simple. Hardly anything extremely intelligent or thought-provoking. One thing I loved about the movie however, was the on screen chemistry between not just the two leads, but everyone involved. It helps that the movie had some of the best, most sarcastic dialogue I've heard in a long time. The banter and quick quips between John and Jane was highly entertaining. They were a joy to watch. Doug Liman has been churning out great movies like Swingers, Go and The Bourne series and he continues the tradition here. He has a gift for identifying what the audience wants, and if you realize he has dabbled in movies from different genres and pulling them all off with his own style.<br /><br />The acting, especially between Brad and Jolie definitely made the movie much more than it actually was. The passion comes full force when they try to outdo and kill each other. There's a certain sensuality they bring to the characters. This is more sexy than romantic, and I'm not really surprised they fell for each other after the making of this movie. I don't know about real life, but they made a fantastic couple here, neither backing down and both exchanging creative insults. Add a healthy dosage of one of my favorite comedians of all time, Vince Vaughn and you already have a killer movie (no pun intended).<br /><br />Of course, the movie had it's share of absurdity and unrealistic action sequences, but Doug Liman knows this. That's why he never pretends to take the movie seriously because he knows it's all in the name of fun. And that's what makes the movie a blast. In the end, it all comes together very nicely.<br /><br />When you think about "feel good" movies, it doesn't get any better than this. Charming leads, respectable plot, humor, action, witty dialogue...it definitely does not disappoint...perfect for laying back and just enjoying. Thumbs up!</p></br><a href="../users/A3GA09FYFKL4EY.html">A3GA09FYFKL4EY</a><br/><p>Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie manage to do what "Bennifer" couldn't: Make a GOOD on- and off-screen couple flick. Married spies manage to hide their double lives from each other a la "True Lies" - but then are ordered to eliminate each other! It's a hilarious thriller and well worth watching. Pass the popcorn.</p></br><a href="../users/A35YWA2V4QHOJ3.html">A35YWA2V4QHOJ3</a><br/><p>First off, I have no idea what made this particular version un-rated.  Un-rated usually = nudity, but not in this case.  While the lovely Angelina has removed her clothes in other films (see GIA), she sadly keeps them on all the way thru this one.<br /><br />As for the plot, what came to mind as I was watching this film was someone taking a round-trip from New York to L.A. just to pick up a gallon of milk.  That's how circuitous it seemed.  To say it is far-fetched would be a major understatement.<br /><br />Of course, the selling-point of this film is not the absurd plot but the entertainment value.  On that mark, this movie does just fine.  There is plenty to like about two professional assasins who just-so-happen to be married & how they go after each other.  Surprisingly, it makes for some very funny moments, albeit in a sadistic sort of way.<br /><br />The biggest point of this movie, however, are the two actors.  Just about every male not named Tom Cruise would love to be Brad Pitt.  And, just about every non-lesbian woman would love to be WITH Brad Pitt.  Likewise, just about every woman not named Catherine Zeta-Jones would love to be Angelina Jolie.  And, of course, she is the kind of woman who visits the dreams of men such as myself.  So, it is this idea of two "perfect" people being married & yet trying to kill each other that is a big draw.  The fact that this movie spurred on a real-live romance only adds to the intrigue.<br /><br />So, if you're a fan of action movies, action comedies,  Brad Pitt and / or Angelina Jolie, this movie is certainly worth a look.  People who like movies with a twisted sense of humor will also likely enjoy this one.</p></br><a href="../users/AIRHRV3D8X4J1.html">AIRHRV3D8X4J1</a><br/><p>Mr & Mrs. Smith is one of the summers most entertaining movies. I have to say this movie was far better than i expected it to be. What makes this movie so awesome is the attatchment you get to the characters. Brad Pitt is awesome in this movie and hilareous as well. Angelina Jolie did a wonderful job as well. The chemistry between these two is intense and at times very believable. The movie does start out slow and is over the top at times, but it is really a great movie. I have always liked Brad Pitts (Fight Club, Troy) movies but with this movie you see more of a three dimentional character and not just some one dimentional hot looking guy on screen. If you like entertaining and awesome movies then check out Mr. & Mrs. Smith. The DVD will be released Tuesday, November 29th, 2005 and will be loaded with extras!</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>I recommend this movie to all people who want to see a fun, action packed movie. Mr. and Mrs. Smith is smart and sassy, it's a lot of fun. Jolie and Pitt were made for this one.</p></br><a href="../users/A228JH8V9Y700G.html">A228JH8V9Y700G</a><br/><p>It's hard to seperate yourself from this movie considering the hype it generated unwittingly.  The movie itself was overshadowed by the fact that Brad Pitt had left his wife Jennifer Aniston for Angelina Jolie, his costar.  They put down the rumors saying "Oh no, we're just friends".  Of course, that's anything but true now.  Four children, world travel, charitable causes, and one of the most hyped celebrity couples (but not annoying like Bennifer) later, we all know better.  Trying to put that aside, this movie was pretty good.<br /><br />Brad and Angelina play a married couple in a rut.  Bored and rather unwilling to change their status as a "boring couple", they are living in the suburbs, going on with their otherwise mundane existences.  What neither of them knows is that they are both assasins, working for rival groups, and one day they are hired to off each other.  We see a series of events unfolding as they are off on their missions independently, then as their paths cross and realize they are not so boring after all.  Strangely enough, the spark in their marriage returns and they live happily ever after.  They really didn't know each other at all, did they?<br /><br />It's a lightweight action movie with a lot of shooting and violence, yet not campy like some action movies past.  It has a few moments of humor, but it, like their marriage in the beginning, starts of slow and boring.  But, it's a fun time without being too serious.  Good for some entertainment.</p></br><a href="../users/A8F2AZWB20X1H.html">A8F2AZWB20X1H</a><br/><p>I didn't expect to like this movie. By the time I finally got around to catching it on cable TV I was Brangelina'ed out. Feh. But "Mr. and Mrs. Smith" is so much fun to watch, never mind that it is completely and totally unbelievable, that you can't help hanging in for the ride and enjoying almost every minute of it.<br /><br />So: He's John. She's Jane. They're both gorgeous. (Being Pitt and Jolie, what else would you expect?) They meet in Bogota, Colombia in the middle of some government mess, and it's love at first sight. Flash forward to five or six years later (they're not sure which), when they are contentedly if boringly settled in suburbia, each going about their daily business. She thinks he's the head of an engineering firm. He thinks she's the head of a computer company. What neither of them knows is that each is a top agent for rival companies of international assassins, and each company has contracted them to take out the same target, a young hunk named Benjamin Danz a/k/a "The Tank", nicely played by Adam Brody. Through a series of mis-steps, each gets in the other's way and the target escapes. Their respective companies are not pleased. Now they're each assigned to do away with the hindrance, and they find themselves with 48 hours to kill each other.<br /><br />From there, the craziness multiplies exponentially. "Do you know you're ticking?" asks an incredulous bystander, warning John just in time that an explosive device is about to detonate in his jacket pocket. "That's TWO TIMES you've tried to kill me!" shouts John into his cell phone while racing Jane home in a purloined limousine. "Oh come on, it was just a little bomb," she sniffs as she zooms down the highway towards home, where an enraged John is headed and all hell is about to break loose. And amid gun battles, exploding houses, car chases and general mayhem, they discover that their respective firms are not pleased to learn that they are married (sleeping with the enemy is a no-no), and set up the Tank mission all along as a trap for them to take each other out.<br /><br />The plot is so off the wall that it would defy the belief of a five-year-old, but this movie doesn't ask to be taken seriously, as if anybody would. It's a fun movie and doesn't pretend to be anything else. We see the Smiths going about their daily (or nightly) assignments as he is sent to assassinate a guy named Lucky at his poker game; when he returns home, Jane asks John how the game went; John replies, "I got Lucky." Har-de-har-har. While John has been off bumping off Lucky, Jane herself has gone to the hotel suite of a notorious gun-runner with a taste for S & M. "Have you been selling big guns to bad people?" she coos as she strokes his hair and takes hold of his neck. Twist. Snap. Thud. Out the door just in time to make it to the Colemans' cocktail party. Typical life in suburbia.<br /><br />But what really makes this movie is the chemistry between Pitt and Jolie. From their first scene together, these two set off sparks. Their magnetic attraction to each other, even while they're doing their level best to kill each other (or at least to keep from getting killed by the other) hold them and the movie together. Pitt has some nice comic turns ("Honey, you're overreacting!" he shouts at her while she tries to run him down with her car. "We don't want to go to bed angry!") and a couple of tired comic turns as a klutz who keeps making noises dropping things when silence is essential), but it's Jolie who holds our attention more. She sizzles and smolders and her eyes speak volumes; this lady hardly needs words to communicate with eyes like hers. But the movie is almost stolen by Vince Vaughn as John's colleague Eddie, a loser who still lives with his mother because she's the only woman in the world he can trust, even while he yells at her for keeping tabs on him. An assassin and a momma's boy? Hilarious -- and as unlikely as the rest of the film. The movie hits total disbelief through the final gun battle with their firms' combined hit team, in which John and Jane take out every agent with a minimum of fuss and bother, while the hit team acts like The Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight. Well, hey, it's only a movie.<br /><br />When all is said and done, "Mr. and Mrs. Smith" treats us to two hot actors in very nice performances, lots of comedy, loads of action, and not a whole lot else. It doesn't demand anything out of you except to suspend belief and enjoy the ride. Pass the popcorn.<br /><br />Judy Lind</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>Mr. & Mrs. Smith is about as mainstream as mainstream action fare can get, and is more notable for being the first on-screen pairing of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie than it is for anything it offers film wise.  Pitt and Jolie star as an unhappily married couple who soon discover that each other are assassins working for rival organizations, and each one has the other set in their sights.  Yeah, you all pretty much know the premise by now, so there's no need to go any further in that department.  What really sets Mr. & Mrs. Smith apart from other mega budget fodder is the energetic and sometimes electrifying direction from Doug Liman (Go, The Bourne Identity) and the heat and chemistry demonstrated by Pitt and Jolie, but there's really nothing else here to make it anything real special.  Also featuring the always scene stealing Vince Vaughan and Adam Brody.</p></br><a href="../users/A30TK6U7DNS82R.html">A30TK6U7DNS82R</a><br/><p>It must have seemed like a great idea at the time for Adam Brody's management, get your client a key part in the new Brad Pitt Angelina Jolie thriller, MR AND MRS SMITH, directed by Doug Liman, for whom Adam had already proved a breakout star for his role playing Seth Cohen on THE O.C.<br /><br />Well, what on earth happened?  As it stands, the movie seems to be thumbing its nose at young Brody, featuring him in the second reel for about 1 minute and a half, when the boss calls him into the office and his officious secretary knocks him down to size by not letting him cross the threshold.  The audience isn't given the chance to know what this is all about, and he's completely forgotten till about an hour later, when he pops up in a car, being transported to a highsecurity federal prison.  Do we ever find out why?  It doesn't matter, we never really care about his character.  When Brad Pitt threatens him with physical pain, and when Angelina Jolie hits him across the face with a telephone, there's not much at stake, for we still don't know who he is or how he got suckered into appearing in the movie.  Was it to give the project some teen credibility, the way John Wayne was forced into hiring Ricky Nelson or Frankie Avalon in minor roles in his later Westerns?  If so, how ludicrous, because all Adam Brody brings to the part is a trademark dorkiness which makes us think that a cheeky smirk is all he has to offer.  He should fire all his advisors who had him take this role.  Yeah, how's that screen career coming, Seth Cohen?<br /><br />Other than this miscalculation, the star power of Pitt and Jolie burns like a city on fire.  They are perfectly matched and no wonder they fell in love or whatever!  She has never been better and her acting, here a series of mumbles, smirks and fleeting realizations, could almost be mistaken for a lost performance by the divine Louise Brooks.  Asked how long they've been together, Pitt says, "Five years," and Jolie mutters, "Six."  This exchange happens over and over, and it's funnier each time.  (I know it doesn't sound very funny but believe me, in context it is.)  And I know the Hitchcock comedy from 1941 isn't actually the original of this movie, but Liman outdoes Hitchcock at the comedy of manners, heretical as it may be to say.  I'm just putting it out there.<br /><br />My wife wanted to see "that movie about Captain John Smith" (THE NEW WORLD) and this is what they sent us!  For Brad Pitt's name is "John Smith" in this film.  How odd is that?</p></br><a href="../users/A2MNMZMM6BGLTA.html">A2MNMZMM6BGLTA</a><br/><p>I enjoyed this movie. It had some good entertaining action sequences, gun fights and martial arts. Vince Vaughn was his usual motormouth funny self as Brad Pitts sidekick. I liked the concept too. Two spys/assassins from different companies who are living a cover of happily married people with neither knowing the other is what he/she is. I also loved the fact that they were boring, bored repressed married people who when they found out the truth found out they had a lot in common. One of those things being that they got a rush and sexual thrill out of taking out their frustrations on each other while beating the *ell out of each other. And while this is all going on they find that they are more attracted and turned on than they have ever been to one another and that they are secretly soulmates and they didn't even know it.<br /><br />Brad Pitt does his usual good job and adds that little goofey funny stuff that is just hilarious along with his maniacle strange laugh that is just great. Jolie is perfect for the role in that she can play the button up frustrated tight *ss house wife who has the evil, wicked, sex kitten underneath. I heard when this movie came out that Pitt and Jolie had no chemistry. I think that may have been from the overhype by the paparazzi cause I thought they were great together and they seemed to be having a great time making this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/AB9QXH5URDLER.html">AB9QXH5URDLER</a><br/><p>What a great premise as a backdrop to this little adventure flick!  The film in no place takes itself seriously, yet it does engage you and keep your attention.  There is enough tongue-in-cheek humor spread through the comic-book style action to keep most people entertained.  If you want a little "Jackie Chan marries James Bond" type of action, this is the film for you.</p></br><a href="../users/A140XH16IKR4B0.html">A140XH16IKR4B0</a><br/><p>John and Jane Smith (Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie) unbeknownst to each other, are assassins who have entered into a marriage of convenience. The twist is that neither of them knows of the secret life of the other. This complicated their lives (imagine the lies that each must tell the other) but also puts a strain on their marriage. Their day lives are vastly more exciting than their very polite and very perfunctory after-hours existence.<br /><br />This tension and complexity makes the first half of the movie fun and unpredictable. But as soon as the assassins learn of each others' identity, the movie bogs down into a standard shoot-em-up with lots of acrobatics, close calls, impossible escapes, big guns and loud explosions.<br /><br />The extras include somewhat interesting material about problems encountered during shooting, including a couple of "mistakes" (Pitt running into the wrong section of a breakaway fence) that made it into the film.<br /><br />Still, the writing in the second half could have been less predictable. Too bad. The first half had so much going for it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KB1H0S7T6JX1.html">A3KB1H0S7T6JX1</a><br/><p>Mr. & Mrs. Smith brings to the screen the story of a couple who after having spent 5 or 6 years (depending on who you ask) as husband and wife, they realize that they are not who they seem to be...<br /><br />The film does bring to mind True Lies starring Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jamie Lee Curtis; it combines romance, action and adventure making it highly enjoyable.<br /><br />Needless to say, Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie, and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING!), but it's Vince Vaughn that really steals the show for me!<br /><br />The only major setbacks are in relation to:<br /><br />1) Why is the wife's bureau made up exclusively of women?<br /><br />2) The poor choice of an actor to play "the Tank," who is not all man, if you catch my drift... Any particular reason for that?<br /><br />Aside from that, the setting, the plot, the dialogues, and the music are all wonderful!<br /><br />Overall, even though Mr. & Mrs. Smith lacks that extra something to put it over the top, it is a movie guaranteed to provide an evening's entertainment.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EOLRV216BXJ9.html">A1EOLRV216BXJ9</a><br/><p>This is a highly entertaining movie - the 2 hours at the cinema just flew away. On the movie, Brad Pitt and Anglina Jolie looked cool, intelligent and made for each other. The music score was as exciting as the action quickenened the heartbeat. The director(Bourne Identity) succeeded to maintain the pace and tension throughout the movie. He was clever to make full use of Angelina's strengths - determined look and physical prowess built in Lara Croft movies. Brad Pitt had excellent lines and a big heart.<br /><br />What makes this movie better than other summer blockbusters is the focus on the romance part and the attention to fine details in the script - well-written dialogues, timely gags, looks exchanged. There is chemistry between Brad and Angelina.<br /><br />The best scene was when Mr. and Mrs. Smith, both professional killers for different companies, were at the dinner table figuring out whether the other one was the rival player and how much the other knew already. At the same time, they were wary of all sorts of potential dangers - sharp words, knives, poison, guns, car chase etc.  Watch for the crucial moment when Brad Pitt gave a final test to Angelina and she fell for it. From then on, they were at each other's throat and their relationship changed drastically - only for the better as their love for each other was rekindled.<br /><br />Differences between men and women were implicated in the movie. Consider how Mr. and Mrs. Smith work, Jane's sorority vs John's pair, how Jane outsmarted John in the search of the house. Not to mention the head count between Jane and John. The marriage counsel meeting at the beginning and at the end of the movie was a delightful twist.<br /><br />A movie with excellent lines, laughs and action. I walked out of the cinema with anticpations greatly exceeded. Love to watch it again.</p></br><a href="../users/AXSH6O4OP5L4M.html">AXSH6O4OP5L4M</a><br/><p>This film is sort of a remake combination of the Michael Douglas/Kathleen Turner movie, "The War of the Roses," and the Jamie Lee Curtis/Arnold Schwartneger film, "True Lies."  While the former relied upon outrageous behavior and very good dialogue and the later on action and explosions, Mr. and Mrs. Smith relies more on over-the top violence.  Despite the extremes, however, I felt the film was rather bland and predictable.  Both Mr. Pit and Ms Jolie have done better characterizations in other films, but I didn't really care for either of their characters in this film.  I found it difficult to believe that two people who were so passionate at the beginning would be so boring and indifferent after marriage.  I also couldn't believe that anyone could live five--oops six--years together without any kind of attachment until they were challenged by "bad guys." That the two characters were simply psychopathic I could believe, but in that case I'm surprised that one didn't "off" the other long before the marriage counseling stage.  By the time they got to the point of trying to save themselves from becoming victims of their respective agencies, I had long ceased to care if they made it or not.  Strictly for those who like gunshots and explosions.</p></br><a href="../users/A26A64X86VL1R4.html">A26A64X86VL1R4</a><br/><p>If you want some escapist comedy/action/romance with the two most gorgeous stars in Hollywood than this is the film for you!!  Be careful not to switch your brain on because the writing/editing of this film is a little uneven.<br /><br />However, the performances and filming of Jolie and Pitt are great--it makes you wish for a little more thought into the plot.  The action scenes are too long and the endless repartee between Jolie and Pitt regarding what they don't know about one another would be tiresome if, again, Pitt and Jolie weren't so charming and good at what they do.</p></br><a href="../users/AS6SH2JM2YY3H.html">AS6SH2JM2YY3H</a><br/><p>Mr. and Mrs. Smith (the  "Mrs." clearly is intentional as opposed to "Ms.") is a fun spoof of the "What?  You mean we are both secret assassins and we've been married for 6 years (or 5, as Mr. Smith thinks), and we never even had a clue?" genre.<br /><br />Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are great in their roles as assassins in their day jobs, and dull domestic partners in the evening.  The highlight off this movie is the fight scene in their home, when they've come to the somewhat misguided conclusion that the only way out of the mess of working for two opposing agencies is to take out the other.  Lots of firepower and broken glass here.  The neighbors even notice!<br /><br />The worse part is toward the end (not telling you how it will end, of course).  Mr. and Mrs. Smith's bullets miraculously hit every time; miraculously since their opponents are wearing total body armor.  In the meantime, their opponents always, always miss.  The grim expressions on Brad and Angelina's faces, along with lots of paint cans exploding and two fisted shooting, don't cover up this glaring inconsistency.  They weren't this accurate when they were shooting at each other!  Perhaps that is because they really didn't want to cause violence to the other... except for the head butts, kicking, and punching.<br /><br />You know, there was a lot of violence in this movie!<br /><br />See it once to observe the chemistry that got Brad and Angelina together (their first child together was announced this week).  Then you can move on to other entertainment.</p></br><a href="../users/ASIA7V7CBSKD3.html">ASIA7V7CBSKD3</a><br/><p>If you're looking for lots of action and attractive people in the middle of it all, then this movie is for you.  Angelina is, well, Angelina and definately overpowers Pitt and steals the show (not to mention looks good doing it).  While I don't see this movie even getting glanced at when it comes to writing or screenplay, the movie is still entertaining.  Plus there is that whole Brad-Angelina thing going on right now too.</p></br><a href="../users/A3IDMLOWLHWNDJ.html">A3IDMLOWLHWNDJ</a><br/><p>"How many times hav-"<br /><br />"Ten."<br /><br />- Ten is the magic number for "Mr. & Mrs. Smith"<br /><br />"Mr. & Mrs. Smith" is one of those action films that survives on one thing - it's stars.<br /><br />The film opens with Mr. & Mrs. Smith in there first session of marriage counseling. The couple have been married for 5 to 6 years. They met in a third-world country, got married right off & had a happy homelife, at first. But with the ensuing years they both slowly became distant, succumbing to there hum-drum lifestyle.<br /><br />Business picks up when both of them find out a dark secret. Each of them is a trained assasin, working for competing firms. Of course both of them are angry at each other for not telling the other about this & what's worse their latest hit is each other. After the Smith's try to off each other unsuccessfully they decide to team up & figure out how to get out of the mess their in.<br /><br />"Mr. & Mrs. Smith" reminded ao much of the James Cameron film "True Lies" that I was waiting for the Govenator to make a guest appearance. From the dancing scene to Vince Vaughn's funny sidekick, I couldn't help but think that this must have been an early draft for "True Lies 2".<br /><br />The action scenes are pretty cartoonish & aren't to believable (that's an ongoing problem with action films today the bigger the bang the more unbelievable it is).<br /><br />Pitt & Jolie are fun to watch & are what make "Mr. & Mrs. Smith" worth the rent. Sadly, I can smell a sequel coming.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>Call it media blitz problems, but the negative feedback on this film, due primarily to the controversy of its stars, made a lot of people stay away.  But now on DVD MR & MRS SMITH has a chance to prove it is a good little action film.  Pitt and Jolie do have a screen chemistry that is as strong as some of the old film classics.  The plot is a bit silly, but the script takes the chance of addressing some important issues about marriage, therapy, trust, fidelity, and the impact of making relationships work under duress.  Not a great movie but a well-paced one and full of enough fun moments to make it a nice evenings diversion. Grady Harp, November 05</p></br><a href="../users/A2I6MHMAZZDCRX.html">A2I6MHMAZZDCRX</a><br/><p>John and Jane Smith (Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie) have been married for five or six years and are having some marital problems.  Their life has become routine and boring.  They've fallen out of love.<br /><br />What they don't know is that each of them has a secret.  In fact, it's the same secret.  Both of them are assassins who have been hiding what they really do from each other since the moment they met.  Their respective bosses have figured it out, however, and their next assignment is to kill each other, or become a target together.<br /><br />To be honest, I was intrigued by the premise, but really knew nothing else about the film.  I was almost turned off by the gossip surrounding the leads, but went with some friends to see it anyway.<br /><br />We loved it!  This is a black comedy with lots of action and suspense.  And great one-liners.  We laughed ourselves silly at the dialog from the very first scene.  The funniest scene by far was the scene where John and Jane were fighting around their house.  Their lines were exactly the opposite of what they were really feeling, but the actors did a great job of delivering the lines in a way that captured the absurdity of the situation.<br /><br />That's not to say the movie isn't without some flaws.  The beginning, while laying much needed background, is also a little slow.  And the climax is completely unbelievable.  Still, this isn't a movie to be taken seriously.  If you watch it looking for logic, you will be disappointed.  If you disengage your brain, you'll enjoy a fun time.<br /><br />The DVD features the standard stuff we've come to expect these days.  In addition to the movie, there are three audio commentaries with various members of the crew, including one with the director.  There are also some deleted scenes and a making of a scene featurette.<br /><br />Those looking for a logical, sophisticated action flick will be disappointed.  Those looking for a good time will be entertained.  It doesn't take itself too seriously, and neither should you.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />A star vehicle and nothing more, Mr. & Mrs. Smith is reminiscent of Hitchcock's To Catch a Thief: both movies seem to feel that watching sexy stars interact is inherently interesting when all the evidence points to the contrary.</p></br><a href="../users/A2XXV9HF169LCF.html">A2XXV9HF169LCF</a><br/><p>This movie reminded me of all the old black and white dance-and-banter movies I used to watch, with loads of style and deadpan wit, and a good coating of gloss. There isn't much substance-this isn't the sort of movie to go in depth- but there's some really surprisingly good acting. Brad Pitt is a down to earth, old fashioned skills sort of killer; Angelina Jolie is slick, high-strung, part of a big-money-and-loads of neat toys assasination outfit. They do a brilliant job. I really enjoyed it. There's an attention to detail in some aspects that my friend the gun enthusiast would get a kick out of. (Those yellow sunglasses actually have a purpose in top-level competitive shooting; they make your vision ever so slightly better.)<br /><br />My husband and I - both former military - watched it in the theater with a bunch of teenagers, and I think we laughed so hard we embarased them. It's really a good movie, it works on the blow-em-up level as well as a slightly more sophisticated one.</p></br><a href="../users/AUTBHG6070SL4.html">AUTBHG6070SL4</a><br/><p>It's one of Hollywood's freakier genetic experiments: inserting genes from a domestic comedy into the DNA of an action thriller. The real surprise is that the result is not only viable, but lively and enjoyable. The action sequences keep it moving, but the humor of the over-familiar couple is what makes this really worthwhile. Anyone who's been coupled for more than a few years will recognize all the signs: affectionate gestures so habitual they're almost invisible, not-quite-listening to most of what's said, and the daily routine (or rut).<br /><br />And the little secrets we keep from each other. There's no ill intent there, just things we don't want our other to worry about, or things that would be harder to discuss than they're worth. Like, for example, the little thing about international assassinations for hire.<br /><br />There are no grand themes here. It's just entertainment - lots of action, and enough wit to keep you paying attention. If you just want to kill a few hours, Mr. and Mrs. Smith are the ones to do the job for you.<br /><br />//wiredweird</p></br><a href="../users/A15TNUM2PBS6F0.html">A15TNUM2PBS6F0</a><br/><p>"Mr. and Mrs. Smith" is an entertaining romp of action, adventure, and yes, even comedy.  Vince Vaughan plays a supporting role, perhaps a bit too small, but he provides the comedic relief.<br /><br />Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie star as John and Jane Smith.  They are married to each other yet live completely separate lives as hired assassins.  They are both hired to kill...each other.  Sounds rather silly, but I think it was done pretty well.  It was well paced, filled with great action, snappy dialogue, and also quite stylish at that.<br /><br />"Mr. and Mrs. Smith" is a fun film to rent on any night.

Personally, I think this movie is perfectly blended with action and humor at the same time. Pitt and Jolie both portray spies that have been married for 5 or 6 years, but neither one of them know it. The fun begins when they find out the truth about one another. I thought it was hilarious to see these 2 married people trying to kill each other. I think a lot of people missed the real element of this movie. It was not action drama. It was more romantic comedy with a splash of action pitting husband against wife, or a battle of the sexes if you will. Jolie kicks butt as always, and Pitt does a great job too as always. This movie was fantastic in my opinion.</p></br><a href="../users/A6ADO7B6FUVN.html">A6ADO7B6FUVN</a><br/><p>Some 60 years after Hitchcock made the marriage troubled screwball comedy Mr. & Mrs. Smith in 1941 with Carole Lombard in the female lead and Robert Montgomery opposite her the film has received an action-packed makeover.  This remake casts Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt as Jane and John Smith.  The film certainly gives the audience a fireworks spectacle comparable to many Schwarzenegger and Stallone films from the 1980s and early 1990s.  It even has a touch of James Bond and Mission Impossible with its secret compartments and its cool approach to the hush-hush missions.  However, the remake still possesses some of the same screwball humor, as the new Smiths struggle with their marriage.<br /><br />There are both similarities and differences in both the original and the remake.  The original opens in a messy hotel room to which the arguing couple has withdrawn to deal with their relationship issues while the 2005 version delivers a more contemporary solution through a visit to a marriage counselor.  Hitchcock applies a detailed mise-en-scene and terrific performances by the cast to accentuate the character's lives while Jane and John offer information on their relationship through brief verbal testimonials.  However, the most obvious difference is the subtlety of threats in Hitchcock's film while director Doug Liman is much rougher (maybe a clear underestimation) in his depiction of a marriage in trouble.<br /><br />It is in the presentation where the remake highlights the differences with the original film, as both Jane and John live secret double lives.  They are professional killers that serve the highest bidder.  Successfully, they have hidden their secrets from each other for the last five-six years (they do not seem to be able agree on how long they have been married.)  This is also the second time that the theme of a couple having secret double lives emerge, which it also done in James Cameron's 1994 box office hit True Lies.  However, the difference here is that both are secret killers.<br /><br />Jane and John are constantly watching over their shoulder in order to maintain the normal front of marriage.  Often they come close to uncovering one another, but never do. It did not start this way between them, as they once were happily in love.  Over time, their never-ending series of intricate lies and deceits has begun to wear on them.  The weariness has worn out their lustful desire and loving appetite for each other's lips and created an indifference.  Despite their apathy, they both try to maintain the illusion of happiness by doing the things married people do such as eating supper together and going to dinner parties.  The apathy also forges a strong silence between them, which never seems to be broken through any kind of quarrel.  Still, these emotions must surface in order for the relationship to continue, as Hitchcock so well portrayed through his 1941 version.<br /><br />The truth is about to come out when they both take on a job of assassinating the same person.  The question only is how it will affect their relationship, as they both carry years of repressed resentment.  It is a strong bitterness that will affect their reaction to the truth of their identities and fake foundation of their marriage.  Also, they realize that they are competitors living together, and the awareness of one another might just have lethal consequences and bring a love quarrel to another level disguised in blades and bullets.<br /><br />Married couples always encounter some moments in their lives when their relationship might seem weakened.  Some successfully survive the rough spots while others seek divorce.  Jane and John will propel the thought of splitting up into an entertaining action film that will have the audience laugh and rock in their seats, as the characters of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie seek the ultimate ending of a relationship.  In addition, Liman has previously made the witty Swingers (1996), exciting Go (1999), and the suspenseful Bourne Identity (2002) and shows in Mr. & Mrs. Smith his eye for thoughtful and quick action, which displays much promise for future films.  Unfortunately even though the film is amusing and has some flashy action sequences that will draw attention, it never reaches the innovative quality of Hitchcock.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IUI3CJUMB7J0.html">A1IUI3CJUMB7J0</a><br/><p>One of the best films of 2005!! The chemistry is great between Pitt and Jolie(maybe becouse they are seeing each other in real life). The movie has great one liners from Jolie and Pitt. The action scene's are great and the movie is halarious. i never thought this movie would be as funny as it was. The plot is good everything about this movie is good.</p></br><a href="../users/A1129LM24YWSZV.html">A1129LM24YWSZV</a><br/><p>I thought Mr. and Mrs. Smith, directed by Doug Liman, was a fun, entertaining flick. The premise of the movie is this: John and Jane Smith, after five (or six) years of rather lackluster marriage, visit a marriage counselor for a "tune-up." During their session, they admit to keeping "little secrets" from one another. We later learn that they are both assassins for hire, maintaining a secret life apart from one another. Their professional worlds collide, however, when they are both assigned to the same hit.<br /><br />In the ensuing scenes, the couple realizes the duplicity of their marriage as both are assigned to kill each other. A few rollicking shoot outs later, the two decide that perhaps their union is worth saving after all, and they decide to flaunt their employers and fight for one another. (I realize that this plot is not exactly brain surgery. However, how many moody, wordy, deep dramas can one watch? Sometimes a little mindless entertainment is exactly what is needed.)<br /><br />Aside from the physical perfection of both Angelina Jolie (Jane Smith) and Brad Pitt (John Smith), their on-screen chemistry is great. In addition to great physical work in this movie, they both flex their comedic muscles to great effect. (I loved lines like, "You still alive down there, baby?" What a hoot!) And while the story line follows a very familiar path, it is still fully enjoyable.<br /><br />While violent, the carnage in this movie is not particularly graphic; it lives up to its PG13 rating. As no heavy mental lifting is required, it's great, indulgent entertainment. I would recommend this film for both couples and families with older children.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GKPMHV4U64IY.html">A3GKPMHV4U64IY</a><br/><p>Mr. and Mrs. Smith are hired killers and are unaware that they share a profession.  John is supposedly in construction while Jane is supposedly in computer maintenance.  Their secret lives are much different.  They each thought the marriage would provide good cover for their own covert actions but are now going to a marriage counselor.  We get a good look at how they started together and how they got where they are.  Then they are both hired for the same hit and get in each others way.  Now they each have forty-eight hours to eliminate the other before their companies eliminate them.<br /><br />They manage to track each other down and are surprised to learn their spouse is now what they thought.  A misunderstanding then drives them into a series of maneuvers where they keep trying to kill one another.  But all of this give each of them a chance to explore what their feelings really are for each other.  Honesty begins to be a part of their communication and things get more complex.  As the relationships build so does the action until everything is neatly wrapped up.<br /><br />This is not another True Lies although there are some obvious similarities.  The therapy framework as well as the flashbacks and humor help make the film unique and not a retreatment of old ideas.  The change in personas between the real and the cover personalities is also very well done and believable.  This helps cement the rest of the film.  All in all a good film that works well as an action film and as a romantic film.  Check it out.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ.html">A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ</a><br/><p>I'm sure the two stars, director, and studio behind this action packed film would prefer that the film had a better reputation as the film that started the whole "Bradgelina" scandal. But the tabloid fodder that this pairing created, along with Jennifer Aniston, will forever be linked to this film, casting a shadow over it. I know some people who refuse to even see this movie because of what happened. I'm not saying you should see this movie, even though I liked it, but you should see it for yourself instead of letting outside forces rule your choices. As far as simple mindled summer/popcorn films go, this one is actually pretty good. It's definitley not great, but it's not bad. It could of been a lot better and they definitley could of taken it a lot further. What I wasn't expecting from the film was the humor. I just didn't think of it being there. But it was and it was nice to have. Kind of a "Lethal Weapon" funny, but not as much. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie star as husband and wife. John and Jane Smith. Can it get any more blander and average?. Both seem to be living the normal upscale suburban life with both of them having careers. What neither of them know is that both are top assassins, and when they leave for work in the morning, they are killing people and blowing things up. Things get a little nasty when both of their agencies find out about their marriage and decide that it's not good image-wise, and set up a plan for the two to take each other out. The duo find out and start battling, until they realize they really love each other and team up to stay alive. The premise of the movie is pretty fun and it definitley has potential for a lot of great set up. Fortunatley, some of that potential is here. Unfortunatley, it's not enough. The movie moves along pretty quickly and once things really kick in, there is not a real dull moment. But the movie is not as big and explosive and memorable as it wants, or should, be. The direction is pretty slick though and well done, and our two stars are game. I haven't seen a lot of Brad Pitt films, but he fits real well into his role. Jolie is a little more cold. However, she is incredibly sexy here. Vince Vaughan has a small suppoting role as a friend/co-worker of Pitt's, and Adam Brody from "The O.C." puts in a small side role as well. The presence of our two stars brings a lot to the table, and there is enough humorous moments and big action pieces to entertain. But it could of been so much more.</p></br><a href="../users/AK1OBVI54SY73.html">AK1OBVI54SY73</a><br/><p>I decided why not let's see how well Brangelina do together on film that has sparked so much controversy off- stage. I don't see it honestly. These two did not in this film feel compatiable at all. I tried to see it, but I didn't. They just did not look like a belivable couple on- screen. They seemed like two over- hyped sex idols placed together in a film so critics can call it sexy as well as full of action and get a bunch of worshippers of these sex idols to come see the movie. And it works so well too, that's why they did it for they knew Pitt and Jolie had many worshippers.<br /><br />Yet honestly this movie was not good. It wasn't the most awful movie I had ever seen, and in the ending it did get somewhat better, but not enough. The beginning of the movie was drop dead boring, and again Brangelina did not to me make a belivable couple. I kept seeing nothing but two sex idols trying to look like the ultimate couple and it doesn't work honestly for me. Then shocker they're both liars and have secretive jobs where they use guns. The movie could have made it more interesting but they didn't. Like I said the ending got better- (especially when Brad and Angelina drop their guns and start fighting that is the only really good part of the movie)- but by then I was so bored of the lame jokes they made throughout the movie and all of a sudden they showing this great love for each other that seemed so forced that the movie couldn't be saved. If you cannot believe the relationship, and that is what the whole movie is centered on, then the movie is weak. And this movie is. I had good expectations for at least Pitt to carry out the movie well, as he usually does...but I don't know Pitt failed in this movie to me...too bad maybe next film Brad.<br /><br />But yeah I wanted to write this review to warn the readers that even though the plot sounds exciting- two highly paid sex idols given guns is not as good as it sounds. Just keep that in mind.</p></br><a href="../users/AJMU8VVFKMZI4.html">AJMU8VVFKMZI4</a><br/><p>Never has an actor and actress have more chemistry and Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie.  Their chemistry and an entertaining script give readers more than just eye candy.  I haven't enjoyed a Brad Pitt movie in years-might be as far back as 'Seven'.  Going in to see this film, I wasn't expecting funny.  This movie is indeed that.<br />The movie starts off with two assasins attending marriage couseling.  (That in itself is a hoot) and quickly escalates to bond action freezy when the husband and wife are ordered to off each other.  Any more than that will totally be giving the story away--but this movie is a definite must-see.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>"Mr. and Mrs. Smith" is part shoot'em up action flick, part romantic comedy that succeeds on the charisma of its stars and on its humor. John (Brad Pitt) and Jane (Angelina Jolie) Smith met in Columbia five or six years previously and married after a whirlwind romance. Unbeknownst to each other, John and Jane are both professional assassins working for competing agencies. They lie to each other about their jobs, hide their unusual talents, and live a sedate suburban life. So sedate, in fact, that their marriage has gotten stale. That all changes when they are both assigned the same target. Now they're gunning for each other -which sure does spice up their marriage.<br /><br />Not surprisingly, "Mr. and Mrs. Smith" doesn't make much sense. It's never clear why John and Jane want to kill each other or if they really do. But they make quite a show of it. I couldn't figure out if they worked for private or government agencies, which are equally unlikely given the sort of action in this film. Jane's injuries disappear between scenes. The high-tech gadgets are more comical than cool. But neither action films nor comedies stake their success on realism. "Mr. and Mrs. Smith" realizes that, and director Doug Liman takes everything over the top. Even so, the action and cute banter would wear thin if the film didn't have 3 cycles in which John and Jane's situation changes. That shakes things up a bit and keeps the audience interested. There is a whole lot of violence in this movie purely for entertainment purposes. And it's not graphic; it's fun -which some people won't like. But "Mr. and Mrs. Smith" is energetic fluff with 2 appealing stars bickering and shooting and generally looking like movie stars.<br /><br />The DVD (20th Century Fox 2005): Bonus features include one featurette, 3 deleted scenes, a theatrical trailer, a teaser, a soundtrack promotional spot, and 3 audio commentaries. "Making a Scene Featurette" (8 minutes) is a short documentary from Fox Movie Channel about creating the action scene in which John and Jane first confront each other as Jane speeds away in her car. The thought of listening to 3 audio commentaries was so daunting that I didn't listen to any, so I will just say: The first commentary is by director Doug Liman and screenwriter Simon Kinberg. The second commentary is by producers Akiva Goldman and Lucas Foster. The third commentary is by editor Michael Tronick, production designer Jeff Mann, and visual effects supervisor Kevin Elam. Subtitles are available for the film in English and Spanish. Dubbing is available in French and Spanish.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>I enjoyed the chemistry and action behind this movie. The story starts out with the telling of why the Smith's marriage is failing apart. Thru the eyes of a marriage counselor. The Smiths who both are assassins for hire. Both discover their mates' true nature then the sparks fly. Vince Vaughn, whom I truly enjoyed, plays a fellow assassin and John Smith best friend.<br /><br />The ending of the movie was a bit unrealistic to me and closure between them was missing something. The movie just falls apart at the end just a little. They argue and talk about their marriage during shoot-outs which can be annoying at times. Then there's a time that the shoot out last too long which makes it unrealistic.  Seriously I mean the movie just ends after a shoot-out that's not that involving or believable.<br /><br />The movie probably needed a main villain. The movie is just about their marriage though and I guess it would've lost focus a little if their was a main villain. Still though it needed something besides them just killing soldier after soldier that come after them. I really liked this movie and I'm happy that I purchased the DVD. It is far from perfect, but quite enjoyable nonetheless, so I will give it 4 stars out of 5. "Mr. and Mrs. Smith" is a good source of entertainment and that's good enough for me.</p></br><a href="../users/ACEA95FQS1AVP.html">ACEA95FQS1AVP</a><br/><p>I agree with the other reviewers that the studios are just screwing the fans when they release a "special" edition less than 6 months after a previous bare bones release, which most of us bought.  At least New Line had some decency when they let fans know there would be two editions of LOTR.<br /><br />However, I don't want potential movie buyers to get the wrong impression based on the starred reviews.

Naturally, I heard about Pitt and Jolie.  Who hasn't?  He left his lovely wife for a new cutie that he met while making this movie.  Both actors were boring and so was the script.  I thought I'd seen it all, but this one takes the cake.  The plot (what plot?) was a disaster.  You think, at first, they are just an average rich couple bored with each other and marriage.  And why not?  They barely talk to each other!  But soon you realize that this couple are each secret assassins married to each other, but neither one knows what the other does, despite the fact that all the high tech assassin stuff is hidden all over the house, in the oven, in the garage, under the kitchen cabinets, the microwave, the cutlery drawer, and anywhere a movie director and a computer geek can think of to hide it.<br /><br />These assassins are very, VERY  high tech.  (All of Jolie's associates are very sexy women)  In one scene Jolie escapes like a scene from Spider Man, where she slides down a very tall building on a thin little cord.  At that point, I nearly turned it off.<br /><br />Finally the two discover the profession of the other, and that they are working for two different organizations.  What kind?  We don't know.  Organizations that murder people, whoever they're supposed to be.  Then they get an assignment in which they are both going after the same person (but it's not too clear, why).  Never is.  Anyway, on this mission they spot each other on opposite sides, so they figure out that each of them is in the same business.  At first they decide to kill each other, and at that point it becomes totally ridiculous as they chase each other around the house and down the road.<br /><br />While preparing for the End Time, a few kids come up to Pitt and ask "What are you doing?"  Answer:  "Uh, preparing for a block party."  (or something like that. Don't remember.)<br /><br />At some point, the two change their minds about killing each other and from there the movie is just a jazzed up chase film.  I don't know how it ends, because at that point, I turned it off, and my husband had already fallen asleep.<br /><br />Personally I think films that resemble Spider Man or Batman should remain cartoons.  That's what they were meant to be.  I like a film with a good plot, good acting and as little high tech movie nonsense as possible.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TPW86OHXTXFC.html">A1TPW86OHXTXFC</a><br/><p>John has just returned from shooting Lucky at the bar<br /><br />"Jane Smith: Where've you been?<br /><br />John Smith: I just went down to the sports bar. Put a little money on the game.<br /><br />Jane Smith: How'd you do?<br /><br />John Smith: I got Lucky."<br /><br />The above dialogue is a sample of what and how this movie moves along. A shoot'em, bang-bang movie with most of the action between these two people, Mr. and Mrs. Smith.<br /><br />Ok, I was interested in this movie because of all of the hoopla about the stars Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt. It is quite apparent that this movie brought this couple together. Many close scenes between the two, and Angelina Jolie is a beautiful woman. Brad Pitt, not my cup of tea, but obviously somebody likes him.<br /><br />The premise of this movie is a couple, who are both professional hired killers, not known to each other, lying about almost everything their entire married life; and now they have reached the 6 year mark in their marriage and are bored. A marriage made in heaven? A marriage based on lies by two people who have grown apart.  It is not until someone else decides that this couple as separate hired killers is not a good thing to have, that the action begins. The opening scenes where Smith and Smith meet each other in a Latin American Country are filled with attraction and lust and the most believable. After those scenes it is all downhill. However, this is a movie of action and science fiction, and the latest in gadgets of war and is fun. It becomes trite and silly at times and slightly overdone, but we forgive the stars because they are so attractive.  The other premise that this bored, married couple will suddenly see how much in love they are after they use every method known to man to kill each other is a little bizarre. However, if you are in the mood for an action flick, filled with beautiful people and the biggest collection of weapons in one movie, "Mr. and Mrs. Smith" is for you. Recommended. prisrob</p></br><a href="../users/A1PW6G3EFXCLFJ.html">A1PW6G3EFXCLFJ</a><br/><p>Unbeknownst to each other, Mr and Mrs Smith (Brad and Jolie) are assassins, very good assassins. They met "on the job", fell in love, and got married but kept their murderous alter egos secret from each other. Now, however, they don't like each other very much. When they both have the same "job" to do, their animosity turns into violence toward each other. MR AND MRS SMITH had good potential as a story but instead devolves into is a slick but pedestrian and superficial shoot-em-up. And you know what? I didn't sense any on-film chemistry between Brad and Jolie. They must have left their passion for each other in the actor's trailer before the shoots. MR AND MRS SMITH reminds me a little of THE WAR OF THE ROSES, a much better film about marital conflict that gets physical, although, of course, the plot lines are not that similar. Brad is always cool, but I don't get all the fuss over Jolie: she bored me as did the film.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>The brief opening scenes are reminiscent of one romantic comedy. Probably you know the film. The scene is similar to the delightful conversations by the married couples talking directly to the camera about their marraiage. Yes, it's `When Harry Met Sally.' In `Mr. & Mrs. Smith,' however, we see how the husband and wife rekindle their love by trying to kill one another.<br /><br />[IT'S JUST A COMEDY] Maybe you have heard many times that `Mr. & Mrs. Smith' is an action film. It is true that there are several (perhaps one too many) explosions and a few shoot-outs, and one car chase sequence, but few of them are intended as hair-raising thrills. Director Doug Liman has an explicit goal of making the entire film not too serious about itself, even though the two central characters, married couple of professional assassins, attempt to kill each other after knowing the truths about their spouses.<br /><br />`Mr. & Mrs. Smith' looks like curious mixture of `Prizzi's Honor' and `The War of the Roses.' This Angelina Jolie/Brad Pitt film is sexier than those two films, but it has no darker tone of the former film, and less farcical touch of the latter.<br /><br />Now I am not complaining. `Mr. & Mrs. Smith' has often disarmingly charming characters Mr. and Mrs. Smith played by Pitt and Jolie, and Mr. Smith's co-worker Vince Vaughn. I believe Angelina Jolie is still looking for a better script to do, and Pitt is just being Pitt himself - nice guy, really down-to-earth - but he doesn't need to explore the darker side as in `12 Monkeys.' I for one much prefer him in this film though he is not going to get Ocsar nomination for this role.<br /><br />The script is terribly empty (after so many re-writes) and the weak ending of the final take obviously shows the traces of cutting and re-editing. But there is palpable chemistry enough between Jolie and Pitt, and amusing set-pieces to keep the audiences from getting bored. I mean, almost enough.</p></br><a href="../users/A38I00SO3D9ZSM.html">A38I00SO3D9ZSM</a><br/><p>Mr. & Mrs. Smith is a light-hearted action comedy of no substance.  It's the cinematic equivalent of a Big Mac combo meal.  The Smiths are both suprisingly amusing, Mr. Smith particularly charming.  Mrs. Smith's an ass-kicker in the vain of Lara Croft.  The movie's pace is very quick and never lets the viewer get bored. It's worth the couple dollars it costs to rent it.<br /><br />Just don't watch this movie if you're hoping for anything original, creative or mentally stimulating.  Mr. & Mrs. Smith is a blow-em-up movie with a few witty one-liners, nothing more, nothing less.  If you just want to sit back and enjoy a good (over-the-top) car chase or gunfight, get it.  Not that it's the best action comedy flick out there, but it'll do.

The chemistry between Brad Pitt & Angela Jolie is genuine since they were getting to know each other real well off screen. What a deal. It's not art, it's a flick.

Classic Hollywood nonsense, obviously aimed to the eyecandy oriented viewers. There is no message here, there is nothing based on real life, there is only silliness after silliness. Overall: BORING and BADDDDDD!</p></br><a href="../users/A1TK6R2JSC97HL.html">A1TK6R2JSC97HL</a><br/><p>You've seen the trailers, suffered the E! specials, maybe read the celebrity-worship zines,  You know what it's about, yet nothing can quite prepare you for just how plainly and nonsensically unentertaining "Mr. & Mrs. Smith" really is.  Brad & Angelina are two high-priced contract killers - practically superheroes.  The biggest and baddest in the business, neither has any idea of the other's true identity.  It was only a matter of time before they crossed paths, but even odds that they would do so under circumstances that allowed each to stay secret from the other.  The joke is that neither of the two has a real life besides meting exotic forms of execution, so it's no surprise that their marriage is as sexless as the movie.  Eventually, they learn the truth, and become each other's highest-priced targets.  After they've destroyed just about everything else of their lives but each other, they realize that their own bosses aren't happy about their pairing, and will eagerly finish the two of them off if they can't oblige themselves.  Thus, we've got some car chase, lots of gunplay, and too many sub-machinegun-men-in-black to count.<br /><br />In varied parts, you can see that the producers of "Smith" intended to make a romantic comedy thriller - or parts of such movies rolled up into one.  Unfortunately, "Smith" fails at each juncture.  The action is canned - lots of obvious stunts that the script telegraphs or sometimes fails to telegraph at all.  (There's a raid on a courthouse in which it's virtually impossible to follow the action.)  Also, the screenplay has neglected to supply a convenient villain - the "Hans Gruber" that puts the human face on all those black-clad & sub machinegun-armed toadies.  All that inaction wouldn't hurt the story that much as the backdrop to a romantic comedy about the Smiths, but the leads have absolutely no chemistry - in fact, most of the time, it's hard to tell what they're even saying. They don't so much as speak their lines, but deliver them - which we can probably blame on a script that's already obviously in need of the leads' star-power.  In fact, "Smith" is so dependent on who's starring in it, that the whole thing begins to look like one of those movies that indie-moviemakers have been warning us about for years, the overpriced, over-cast, overproduced pure-Hollywood production about nothing.</p></br><a href="../users/A1UNJ46NSB352E.html">A1UNJ46NSB352E</a><br/><p>I love this movie.  Sure, the ending is a letdown and there's not much depth to the movie overall, but it is simply a fun ride along the way.  The Blu-Ray version looks great.  I'm not big into special features, to be honest, so it doesn't bother me that the disc is rather short on special features.  I do wish that this had both versions - the Director's Cut (which I've never seen) and the original theatrical version, but they've only included the original.  That's the only real letdown for me.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VCLTAGM5RLND.html">A1VCLTAGM5RLND</a><br/><p>From the opening scene with Pitt and Jolie and the unseen therapist, it was clear that this movie was going to be a cut above the unsual far. It did not dissapoint. Sharp, witty, smart writting, excellent performances. The movie is like an extended metaphor for the trails and tribulations of modern marriage. Fortunately it does not lay message on too thickly. This movie is not original, the original one was made in 1941.<br /><br />P.S. What ever happen to the "steamy sex scene' with Brad Pitt and Jolie. Was it censored? The movie will do way better with that scene!</p></br><a href="../users/A1SCD2NYTIAQTY.html">A1SCD2NYTIAQTY</a><br/><p>When first exposed to "Mr & Mrs Smith", I had my doubts. First, romantic comedy is something I really don't like admitting to enjoying, (no matter how many guns they have). This movie was a pleasant surprise, and I had a real hoot watching it, (and many times since).<br /><br />The humour is verbal with some very good lines, but this is also made punchier by the plethora of situational gags exploiting the contexts they are used it. Sounds dull and dry the way I say it, but what it amounts to is a complex comedy that works. The tentative questions about "how many" are given a whole new twist with the Smiths.<br /><br />Pitt and Jolie have an on screen chemistry that works in most scenes. There are a couple of fizzled points, but for the most part, they really spark well and add to the laughs. Jolie's line "Are you still alive, Baby?" is a classic. Pitt once again demonstrates his ability for comedy, and Jolie also has a knack for it.<br /><br />Having two enemy assassins married to each other was an inspired innovation, and it really goes off with people like Pitt and Jolie in the lead roles. Vince Vaughn still plays much the same character as in other movies such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BKVQRU">Wedding Crashers (R-Rated Widescreen Edition)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006419IM">Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story (Widescreen Edition)</a>. That sort of "I'm ok, you're ok" guy that Vaughn seems to do well with, recently.<br /><br />All in all, this is a great movie. I think I may have to admit that romantic comedy may be something I like. Bummer.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DAOL3NMHEPLS.html">A1DAOL3NMHEPLS</a><br/><p>"Mr. & Mrs. Smith" blends two genres -- high-speed action and bickering couple movie -- with fair success.

Then it goes on to showing how the 2 met in Bogota Columbia, how they fell in love and how 5 or 6 years later after their married, both find out that they are assassins...hmmm..what makes it even worse is that they were sent to whack each other off, not the target they both were after. So, the 2 try to kill each other, punching each other, shooting at each other, slapping, smashing each others heads into a wall or glass and in the end they find that their getting off on the fact their trying to kill one another...interesting. Doug Liman, has done comedy and action before but this is the first time he has meshed those 2 categories together which let's down some of the fun. The fact of the matter is, is that both stars have their moments but for me, it doesnt cut it at all. Vince Vaughn (Swingers, Wedding Crashers) who plays Pitt's boss is best out of the wasted supporting characters, who lives with his mom still ("Mom, I almost just killed you right there!). Adam Brody (Grind, TV'S THE O.C) wearing a Fight Club t-shirt when the man who starred in it was sitting across from him, yeah, ok. Another thing I hated was that it got to boring when they would find guns in hidden compartments...I mean, enough already. Also starring Kerry Washington (She Hate Me, Ray).

Snapping a new clip on your Glock while your significant other sprays you with semi-automatic love missiles.<br /><br />I appreciate a dark comedy as much as the next curmudgeon, yet MR. & MRS. SMITH annoys more than it entertains.  True, there is a predictable plot about a beautiful couple stuck in a rut--a couple who, unbeknownst to one another, are professional assassins (just try to stop that suspension of disbelief train).  Add to that the erotic chemistry between Brad and Angelina; my eyebrows are still singed after watching them.  But all the sexiness and over-the-top, lamebrained action fail to overcome the annoyance of Pitt's detached smirk and Jolie's constant flirtation with wackiness.  As the fighting (boy, is there fighting) escalates, I was suddenly asking myself, "Wouldn't it be great if they popped each other off?"<br /><br />Maybe in the sequel.<br /><br />While we're at it, would someone please feed Angelina a steak, mashed potatos. . .something?  Nothing wrong with being slim 'n trim, but come on, lose the East Africa look.  In the long run, MR. & MRS. SMITH's biggest problem was the fact Vince Vaughn didn't appear enough.

Both actors give stellar performances as high octane, world-class spies who find out they are both each other's targets--their chemistry, already alleged during the filming of the movie, is more than obvious.  It's high adrenaline, high action, high comedic and high romantic.  Everything about this movie is uptempo and freakin' amazing.  Definitely a worthwhile buy.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>Face it--the only reason this film did so well is that people were gaga over the romantic coupling of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie.  And while the two stars use their charismatic presence to propel the film, it's a two hour mismash of incoherent plotting and lots of shoot em up action, car chases and etc., etc.  The story revolves around Mr. and Mrs. Smith, a bored suburban couple who have kept the important secret that they both are "hit people" for rival companies.  When they are set up to do the same hit, they find out their secret and have 48 hours to off each other.  While the premise is unique, its execution is marred by redundancy and no real sense of humor.  It might have worked better if they had gone for a more comical approach to their attempted assassination of each other, but played with a more serious edge, the viewer fails to find any reason to cheer either actor on.  The climax is incredibly incredible and the movie seems to outstay its welcome.  MR. AND MRS.

Whole chunks of the plot aren't just missing - they've gone fishing. Don't fool yourself: The end of this movie is some cobbled-together compromise of a disastrous shoot; it resolves nothing, it's about nothing and involves no clear villain. Whatever it is writer Simon Kinberg created with this script, director Doug Liman used about half of it. The rest is bullets, Pitt's blue slushie eyes and Jolie's alien physique. This puppy's "Gigli" with nifty guns.<br /><br />John (Pitt) and Jane (Jolie) have hit a lull in their marriage. They're bored with each other, predictably so, since they're contract killers for rival death squads and neither spouse knows the other's profession. Not-so-coincidentally they're led to the same place for the same job, after which they discover each other's identities. Then they fight, a lot, trash their house, blow it up, make up, and then realize they're bosses are targeting them. Cue up elaborate car chase and final showdown in, yes, a sporting goods store against a slew of masked men. End of picture.<br /><br />Once upon a time "Mr. And Mrs. Smith" starred Keith David and Angela Bassett as Jolie and Pitt's respective bosses. Their roles have been lopped off. Gone. Vince Vaughn and Kerry Washington, the best friends, play no role in the final act. It could be said we have no idea who the masked men are in the final scene, or who hired them. They don't speak, they get shot. Movies aren't required to have plausible stories, but if a contract squad is after you, much less two, chances are they'd be a little more subtle about it than this.<br /><br />The leads have requisite chemistry, but this Jolie "blue steel" persona is getting a little old. Here's a woman with pedigree and talent wasting time as the ice queen in forgettable B-movies. Pitt slums, too - it's been six years since "Fight Club" - but he has a humor about it. Jolie reserves whatever warmth she posseses for food missions and refugees.</p></br><a href="../users/A5AIEA4LXWJH3.html">A5AIEA4LXWJH3</a><br/><p>Please describe the audio and video quality of any Blu-Ray you review.

Otherwise quite predictable--definitely for an evening of very, very light entertainment.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PIX2K56IZZYX.html">A2PIX2K56IZZYX</a><br/><p>Except for a few cute moments here and there, this was a rather poorly done action flick. I went into this with high hopes, although not a huge Brad Pitt fan, I knew the man had delivered previously, and Angelina Jolie, even with her few flops, can be a good actress, and let's face it, this chick is smokin' hot!!! But as usual with myself getting "jiggy" for a movie, I was again let down, you'd think I'd be used to this by now. But, anyway, Let's begin with Mr. Pitt, shall we? Obviously one of Hollywood's golden boys, this man has made some huge hits, and this was one of them, and he is, um, OK in this, not great, but OK. I felt that during the comedic moments in this film he was really good, he can make you laugh pretty easily and has a gift for physical comedy, but when the serious, emotional scenes play out, I found him boring and lacking. Don't worry ladies, you get to see the world famous abs and pecs, I'm a strong enough man to be able to say this guy is hot and it'e easy to see why the ladies like him.<br /><br />Now for Angelina Jolie, wow does this woman look hot in a bra, which, among other lingerie items, she seems to be in alot of during this 123-minute movie. She too has a knack for some funny moments, and her chemistry with Pitt is decent, not memorable, but decent. Let's face it, Jolie has not done a decent acting job since Gia or Original Sin, and 'Smith" is no exception, she looks  sexy as hell, but that's about all I can give her, sorry.<br /><br />Now my biggest complaint, Vince Vaughn. One of the funniest men In Hollywood, with huge hits recently like Dodgeball and Wedding Crashers, you'd think he might have a chance in saving this. Nope, didn't happen, the man can't be funny and charming if he isn't given good material to work with, and except for one funny scene when he is yelling at his mother while carrying a rather big gun in his hands, the jokes here feel forced and really don't work.<br /><br />There are a couple of above-average action scenes, but way too many shoot-outs, most of them shot very choppy, scenes moving so quickly, I was wishing they would just slow down, you know, take your time in your killing, put on a show and all....<br /><br />I'm guessing alot of people are going to disagree with my review, In talking to some of my customers at work, alot of them were excited about this, raving on how the action really worked and Pitt and Jolie were excellent together, and that's fine.

The only Pitt movies I liked were "Fight Club" and, because I'm a nerd for ancient history and mythology, Troy. Angelina is, on the other hand, notoriously bad at finding good movies to act in. The only movie I like, and this is self-explanatory, is Taking Lives. So, needless to say, I was skeptical of Mr. and Mrs. Smith. This was not even a purchase I made, but one of a family members. If not for Christmas, I wouldn't have touched this movie.<br /><br />Well, thank you Santa. Mr. and Mrs. Smith is a surprisingly funny and action-packed movie. The movie never goes out of its way to force laughs, but kind of just lets it happen through implication and dry humor. The action itself, though it's very difficult to make an action movie in today's saturated market, is done with freshness, with car-chases and gun-fights and explosions galore. Nowhere is the action and comedy better than when Pitt and Jolie are together. It makes for some classic stuff.<br /><br />The story, if you don't already know, is of a married couple who are assassins-for-hire, though neither know that about each other in the beginning. They go about acting as a regular married couple, what with perfectly timed dinners, gettogethers with other couples, and those suburban vehicles. But on those occasions when a job comes, they are as proficient as killers could be, and go about their job professionally and with enough time to get back for dinner. Things twist, however, when they finally discover each others secret, and they must eliminate each other or else suffer elimination themselves.<br /><br />Like I said before, I'm not fond of either actor, but I am convinced that this movie couldn't have been done without these two. Pitt plays that same cool character he does in most of his movies, but it works here with the comedy as it kind of balances him out, makes him a bit more real. Angelina plays the tough-chick like no other high-powered actress (if you don't believe, try picturing Julia Roberts, Catherine Zeta Jones, or Renee Zellweger in her spot).<br /><br />If you liked True Lies, this is a movie for you. If you like solid action (like what's in Desperado or Kill Bill), then I'd also recommend this movie for you. Also, if you are fans of Pitt or Jolie, as I'm slowly becoming, then go with Mr. and Mrs. Smith, because it is one of the finest movies, I think, either of them played a part in.</p></br><a href="../users/AUHG8KSHI529U.html">AUHG8KSHI529U</a><br/><p>This movie seemed like "True Lies' meets "War of the Roses" meets "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid".  I liked it and enjoyed the way it had fun with the whole ridiculous premise.  Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie hit the perfect balance of playing it straight, but not seriously.  It is an action comedy and a pretty darn good one.  Vince Vaughn adds a nice off beat touch to the whole thing.  Comparing his friendship with John Smith and Jane Smith's team, well, we can see clearly the difference not only in style but in personality.<br /><br />Look, it is hard to take professional killers seriously as people and especially ridiculous that such self-involved cold-hearted professionals appoach marriage as "what's it got for me" and wonder why their "relationship" has problems.  However, it does offer a kind of light commentary on 21st century dual professional marriages, doesn't it?<br /><br />Anyway, my advice is to enjoy the movie as fun and not make more of it than it is.  It is kind of a fun story with some just right performances.</p></br><a href="../users/A2582KMXLK2P06.html">A2582KMXLK2P06</a><br/><p>I don't know how to review this movie.  It was like an action/comedy, except the funny parts weren't funny.  The action parts were, however, really good and plentiful.  The storyline was a bit all over the place for me to really sit there and find any solid enjoyment out of it.  Yet somehow, despite the unrealistic story, something about it kept me tuned in.  It must have been all the gun shooting action.  Maybe I'm getting soft at my old age, or maybe there really was something special about the movie.

Both are attending marriage counseling to work out the problems in their marriage.  Jane works with computers, while John works as an architect with his friend Eddie (Vince Vaughn).  They have dinner each night at 7 pm, and neither has much to say.  They live in a nice neighborhood and have friendly neighbors.  But in reality, there is much more than meets the eye.<br /><br />Unbeknownst to each other, both are cooly lethal, highly-paid assassins working for rival organizations.  They are both assigned the same target, Benjamin Danz (Adam Brody).  Both John and Jane show up at the intercept point, but in reality, Benjamin was being used as bait to draw out both John and Jane.  The organizations have found out that the two are married, and there are orders to kill both of them.<br /><br />Jane soon discovers that John was the one who foiled her attempt to get Benjamin, now she has set her sights on taking out her husband.  What happens now is a battle among husband and wife to see who will survive. Will John manage to escape from his wife?  Will they both realize that they are being used as bait in a much larger inter-organizational battle?  Will John and Jane join forces to save each other?<br /><br />I thought this was a very good movie.  The story is very well-conceived.  There are lots of action scenes, along with guns, knives, explosives, and narrow escapes.  There's even an elevator that crashes to the ground from the top of a building.

The premise of "Mr. & Mrs. Smith" is pretty interesting: Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie play John and Jane Smith, a couple that has been married for five (or six) years and finds themselves stuck in a bit of a rut. John and Jane are both assassins, but neither of them are aware of their spouse's real profession. The truth comes out in a big way when their careers suddenly cross paths and their respective agencies order them to take each other out. Half of the movie revolves around the couple shooting at each other, but then they're both ultimately turned on by all the violence, which rekindles the passion in their marriage. Then their respective agencies decide that both assassins pose a conflict of interest because they're married, and the second half of the movie revolves around the Smiths working together to stay alive.<br /><br />I was pretty disappointed with this movie. It has a lot of potential because the premise is so interesting, and also because Pitt and Jolie have an undeniable onscreen chemistry. However, the script SUCKS! All these characters do is run around and shoot at people. Some people might enjoy that kind of thing, but I think the dialogue could have been much better and the relationship between John and Jane could have been scrutinized in much more detail.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ.html">A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ</a><br/><p>If you can get through the rather tedious first half hour or so, Mr. and Mrs. Smith finds its legs and makes for plenty of entertaining action and adventure.  That first half hour can be pretty rough, though, as Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie really seem to sleepwalk through their roles.  Doubtlessly, this is due in no small part to the nature of their characters, two highly-ranked assassins going through the motions of a normal husband and wife in order to hide their real jobs from one another.  I think it goes deeper than the script, though.  Jolie has always gone all out for her characters, but for quite a while I just didn't think she put her heart into this particular role - ironic, given the fact that she and Pitt began their little love affair during filming.  I have to admit that the whole real-life romantic triangle thing dampened my enjoyment of the film, to a certain degree.  For me, there's a definite ick factor in watching Mr. and Mrs. Smith, since in a sense you're watching a real-life adulterous affair play out right in front of your eyes.<br /><br />The plot is pretty basic and nothing we haven't seen before.  Girl meets boy, girl marries boy, girl and boy try to kill each other.  For the first six years of their marriage, John Smith (Pitt) and his lovely wife Jane (Jolie) are completely unaware that their partner is, like themselves, a high-level assassin.  How they go traipsing all over the world killing people and still manage to return in time for 7:00 dinner every night is just one of many questions the writer chose to blissfully ignore.  They really have little reason to suspect one another, though, because their suburban home lifestyle is exceedingly boring.  Whatever spark of romance they once shared, it's long gone by this point.  Everything changes, however, when they get in each other's way on separate missions centered on the same target.  Neither can afford to let the other blow his/her cover, so their respective agencies quickly pit them against one another.  Of course, things get a little more involved after that, but you can see where this whole thing is going.  Finally, once the Smiths stop being so painfully civil to one another, their characters finally begin to show signs of life.  Too many attempts to be funny during the heat of battle only reinforces the weakness of the entire script, however, leaving you unable to enjoy all of the mayhem and things that go boom as much as you think you should.  Sure, some of the dialogue is funny, but most of the time it just seems terribly contrived.<br /><br />With all of its explosions, big guns, and all-around violence, Mr. and Mrs. Smith should manage to satisfy those who just can't get enough movie mayhem, and Angelina Jolie - even though she's not at her best here - still makes any movie she's in worth watching.  Clearly, though, something is just missing here.  Thanks largely to a relatively weak script, Pitt and Jolie never really bring you in to their characters' world, which means you are never able to forget that you're watching a movie.  As a result, the film entertains but never really satisfies.  It's really a 3.5 star movie; I rounded my rating up to four stars because, despite its many weaknesses, the film did manage to entertain me.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NUHWMHA9XNKV.html">A2NUHWMHA9XNKV</a><br/><p>whoever did the casting what a web they help to weave with Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie, Vince Vaughn (AND I'M NOT SPEAKING BAD OF ANYONE)<br /><br />I didn't want to see this movie because of all the hype that was around it with the stars about whoever is dating or who broke up who, i want to see a movie because the actors did a good job.

Both Brad Pitt & Angelina Jolie are extremely stiff in their roles as the stereotypical upper-middle class couple in appearance that are secretly government operatives.  Of course their next sanctions are each other.  Their attempts at murdering each other is way below the caliber of The War of the Roses and Vince Vaughn plays a poor version of Tom Arnold's character from True Lies.  The special effects pale compare to any of the Charlies Angel's films or even True Lies which is about 15 years old.

In the real world, because of fallen human nature, it's sometimes more about killing each other.  Usually it's just looks that kill and words that bite, but in this romantic action comedy film, the two main characters are real-life assassins who turn against each other in a very real bid to take each other out.<br /><br />Mr and Mrs John and Jane Smith (played by real life husband and wife Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie) begin the film like many a married couple - on a couch, discussing their marital woes and observing how there seems to be so much distance between them.  The distance turns out to be far more than both of them could ever have imagined.  For over five years of marriage, they have both kept much of their real lives hidden from each other, including the fact that they are skilled assassins working for different companies.  It's while on assignment that they discover their true identities, but now they are commissioned to eliminate each other.  The first part of the film sets up this conflict, then moves into some stirring action sequences, with the highlight being a frenzied and violent battle between both protagonists in their home, until the very last moment when love triumphs over hate, and they lay down their guns and team up.  Then just when you thought the film was over, it switches gears, and the last part of the story sees them working together as a team against both their firms, who pull out all stops to terminate both of them.  The PG-13 rating is accounted for mostly by all the gunfire, bloodshed, explosions and the high body count needed to make this happen, as well as considerable sexual innuendo.<br /><br />For me the film just didn't work.  Marriage is intended to be a beautiful thing, and to see a married couple's strife escalate to the point where they are trying to kill each other was just painful to watch, even worse than watching  a train wreck.  Seeing the intense violence of a husband and wife kicking and punching and shooting each other in an all out effort to murder the other is not my idea of fun.  This wasn't helped by the fact that the film trivialized the conflict by taking on a comic tone, which minimized the very real  difficulties that some couples can experience in their relationships - and when it happens, it's no laughing matter.  The fact that the film was a comedy also didn't rescue the fact that the story-line was so unbelievable, particularly the critical and totally ridiculous point where the Smiths move from turning against each other to working together.  In real life, pulling out all stops to kill each other doesn't bring back the spark of love or inflame passion.  And it becomes just a bit too much to ask viewers to suspend their disbelief even further in the action sequences which follow, where our heroes take out a gazillion highly trained soldiers, while barely breaking into a sweat or getting a scratch.<br /><br />Rather than succeeding as a comedy, for me this film was a real tragedy, and epitomizes how Hollywood sometimes gives superficial treatment to very serious issues in the real world.  Even the `happy' ending doesn't make up for this.  Regrettably, for me the comic story of Mr & Mrs Smith just left me feeling disappointed.  There are many very real Mr & Mrs Smiths out there who experience the tragedy of this film in their marriages, and sadly it's no laughing matter. - GODLY GADFLY</p></br><a href="../users/AGNOPNCN6FHB6.html">AGNOPNCN6FHB6</a><br/><p>any married couple watching this might closely relate to this action packed comedy... i.e. the super steamy start, the unfolding ennui, the forced emotion, constant lies, the hatred, the death wish, and the deux-ex machina, the therapist!!  loved this film... intrigue, suspense, humor, and a cathartic conclusion... thought the dept store shootout was overly protracted but the makeup scene was well worth the wait, this is one muy caliente (sp) team that sizzles in every scene and the crazy violence only enhances the instincts...Brad n Angie have a lovely tribute to their on screen nadir which will provide intense excitement for both sexes...thanks for this gift of entertainment! high recommend</p></br><a href="../users/A267IXCC7UK1HY.html">A267IXCC7UK1HY</a><br/><p>This is enjoyable in every way.

In fact, the gunplay, fisticuffs and chases remain secondary to Brad and Angelina's considerable star power - a rarity in today's cineplex environment. "Mr. & Mrs. Smith" (2005) is refreshingly old-fashioned in the classic Hollywood tradition.</p></br><a href="../users/A2WP0GOTX13MG4.html">A2WP0GOTX13MG4</a><br/><p>'Mr. and Mrs. Smith' stars Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie as a married couple living in suburbia.  However, it's not quite that simple.  Jane (Jolie's character) thinks her husband John (Pitt's character), is in construction.  John is under the impression that he is married to a director of a Wall Street systems manager.  What they both don't know is that each is a professional assasin working for a rival firm.  They each take on a job to take out the same target, and the secret is revealed.<br /><br />This was a very interesting movie.  There is a ton of action.  Pitt and Jolie engage in fisticuffs and firefights, first with each other, and then with those sent to get them.  There is a great chase scene and some wonderful explosions.<br /><br />There is plenty of eye candy.  Pitt is suave and dashing in his tuxedo.  The guys get to drool over Jolie.  The onscreen chemistry between the two is quite good.<br /><br />Then there is the examination of marriage.  I thought this was well done.  The movie starts with John and Jane in a marriage counselor's office as they examine their relationship after five or six years of marriage (inside joke, watch the movie).  They both know there is something that is standing in the way of their relationship.  We, the viewers, know about their secret lives, but there is more than that.  The movie makes some subtle statements about what it takes to have a happy marriage, but the violent back drop is rather ironic.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend this film.  I'm strangely fascinated by it, and I have watched it three times in one week.  Pitt and Jolie fans should be very pleased.  Action fans will enjoy the many shoot outs the film has to offer.  There is even a little something for romance fans.<br /><br />Overall Grade:  4.25 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A1C2P5HX5RLPAX.html">A1C2P5HX5RLPAX</a><br/><p>Mr. and Mrs. Smith are a beautiful couple who live in a beautiful home in a beautiful neighbourhood. Both work at successful everyday jobs. Or so they think. The movie opens with the Smiths sitting on a couch being questioned about their marriage by a psychologist who we never see (but is played by William Fichtner: Invasion, The Perfect Storm, Armageddon). When John and Jane met they had instant chemistry, drinking themselves blind and making out in the rain. After a few weeks they tied the knot. "Five or six" years later they fell into the suburb routine of getting up, going to work, having dinner and very little (if any) sex.<br /><br />They have both perfected their skills as liars and as deadly assassins. They botch a mutual job and in so doing learn that the other is also a hired killer. Even though they both lied, each feels deceived by the other but their relationship is the least of their problems. Because of this botch they have 48 hours to clean up the mess. Part of the mess involves getting rid of the other spouse. Sparks begin flying along side the many bullets they rain on one another.<br /><br />Right from the beginning I was laughing at their interaction between Jolie and Pitt. They are very funny, even when they are working (killing people, which sounds horrendous). The nattering between these two is reminiscent of Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant. A few of the violent scenes with them kicking one another's butts made me wince, but overall were tolerable. Fun movie. I'm looking forward to seeing it again.</p></br><a href="../users/A39IBJB2PBVC7I.html">A39IBJB2PBVC7I</a><br/><p>Interestingly enough, this plot was made into a movie several years ago using real actors. Prizzi's Honor, with Jack Nicholson and a then scrumptious Kathleen Turner was smart, sophisticated, funny, and surprising.<br /><br />By contrast, Mr. & Mrs. Smith, little more than a vehicle for two well recognized faces, is dumb, puerile, drab, and almost frighteningly predictable. The meager hopes of this packaged Hollywood frozen dinner rest exclusively on the shoulders of its co-stars, and any alleged "chemistry" between them. That there is none dooms the effort, even the "hot reconciliation scene" in the kitchen looks staged and false, creating enough warmth perhaps for a weak cup of tea but not quite enough to poach an egg.<br /><br />Angelina Jolie's lips seem to be on the verge of taking over her entire face, while Brad Pitt, who still looks like he's about 12 years old, is unconvincing in a part clearly written exclusively for him. Viewers are expected to forgive far too much in this glossy bubble of vapor. The plot is beyond ludicrous, the performances lethargic, frequently the scenery threatens to walk off with the movie.<br /><br />Mission Impossible settings and a pretty darn good car chase prevent one from going to sleep, but cannot redeem this effort. Those who would defend it by saying, "It's not La Strada, for heaven's sake, it's just an action adventure thriller", are forgetting that thrillers are supposed to be thrilling.</p></br><a href="../users/A2KWQ64TRHB3YH.html">A2KWQ64TRHB3YH</a><br/><p>Some films and books are fun to watch and read even though the basic premise is unrealistic and even absurd. The viewer/reader needs to put logic aside. There is an old Yiddish proverb that applies, "one doesn't question stories." This doesn't mean "don't ask questions about it." In fact the opposite is true. One should question everything one sees and hears and never accept something based on faith. What it is addressing is the recognition that in stories, fables, myths, parables, and the like, the narrator is purposely basing his or her tale on an absurd notion that one should realize and never forget is absurd, but nevertheless not allow this fact to destroy or even minimize enjoying the work. All of this applies here for the basic premise that the spouses of a loving couple could not know that the other spouse is an assassin is highly unlikely.</p></br><a href="../users/A1UOTG037037XY.html">A1UOTG037037XY</a><br/><p>The unrated version shows more scenes of their home life and more long slow shots of Angelina Jolie which really show how amazing looking she is.  I didn't like the theatrical release version at all.  It seemed like a rushed collection of action sequences and smarmy one-liners.  I didn't receive the second disc that comes with the unrated set so I can't comment on it. If you want a slightly slower version and you really want to lock onto Angelina Jolie's face, then this version is the one for you.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>Despite being a fun and sexy romp, Mr. and Mrs. Smith will probably go down in history as the film that made Brad Pitt go from Jennifer Aniston to Angelina Jolie. Like a lot of films, the press behind it seemed to interest more people than the actual film itself, although it did a good number at the box office. While it's a bit problematic, this film wasn't designed to get your kleenex going or your mind working; it just wants to have fun and fun it has. This is the unrated edition so there's more stuff put in (or in some cases, taken out) but by and large, it's still the same rollickingly fun movie.<br /><br />While in Columbia, John and Jane meet and soon a relationship blossoms and they get married. But despite being insanely attractive, they don't really get along but seeing as how they're both hired assassins for separate agencies with none the wiser about the other's "real" profession, it's a good thing. But soon they find out and want to kill each other until there's a hit put out on the 2 of them so they have to team up and survive together and maybe even fall in love, and for real this time.<br /><br />Whether the meeting of the co-stars did result in the breakup of a marriage, you have to admit these 2 have huge time chemistry on-screen; so much so that the idea that their sex life is on the fritz seems almost laughable. It's also good that their acting is up to snuff and while they don't feel like completely realized characters, they more than pull it off. There's also some roles by always likable Adam Brody and scene-stealer Vince Vaughn.<br /><br />The action scenes are the highlight although they're none too inventive (although, the use of the dual sliding doors on SUV's was funny) but that's what we came to see: people getting shot at in MTV-style moves. My one complaint is that certain plot elements seem dropped, like the writer didn't want to write TOO much for the movie so he just wrote the bare minimum, even if certain things don't even get explained. But then again, this is a movie meant to be a blockbuster "good times had by all" kind of movie so it's kind of hard to complain when that was the point, no?<br /><br />It might not be the best action movie of that year or any year but if you ever pick it up, you might just enjoy yourself which is the whole point.</p></br><a href="../users/AFJFXN42RZ3G2.html">AFJFXN42RZ3G2</a><br/><p>Mr. and Mrs. Smith was quite a surprise.  The opening scene of the film bears similarities of an obvious plotline.  Little do we know that Brad Pitt (John Smith) and Angelina Jolie (Jane Smith) live a double life in their quaint suburban splendor-- two car garage and neighborhood parties  Behind the white picket fence, lives the gun toting couple who live on espionage and intrigue, and lies.<br /><br />The film is a cross between a James Bond film and an episode from Alias.  With its fast-paced action and semi-dark comedy tone, the film offers the crash and boom along with the laughs.  The laughable dialogue and movie soundtrack includes the eclectic sounds from Joe Strummer, which gives some of the scenes where Jolie and Pitt "duke it out" a quasi spaghetti western feel.<br /><br />Jolie and Pitt may not be in the same league as past Hollywood couples.  However, they attempt at providing sophistication and humor to Mr. and Mrs. Smith, which makes it a "good-looking" film with all its high gadgetry and high jinx.  It is one of those films to see for the fun of it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2.html">A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2</a><br/><p>The principle virtue of this movie is that it doesn't pretend to be anything but what it is.  Part of the problem most big-ticket movies have had in the last several years is that they have been pretentious on the surface and hollow at the core.  "Mr. and Mrs. Smith" is just big, supremely dumb, and gobs of fun.<br /><br />If you've seen the previews you know the basic story.  A married couple has settled into bland co-existence, each unaware that the other is a top-flight assassin.  When the two of them are given the same assignment and botch each other's plans, they are forced to train their sights on each other.<br /><br />That's it.  There are no layers, no profound themes.  Though a serious critic could get a great deal out of the fight scenes, which transparently conflate sex and violence, that's all smoke and mirrors.  This movie is about lush visuals, gorgeously choreographed combat, and coarse humor.<br /><br />It's true that the two leads don't put a lot into the acting.  Did you expect anything more from these two?  They deliver servicable lines and allow the camera to admire their stylish fighting technique.  That's all the movie demands, and that's all you and I need.<br /><br />It's not world-changing.  You won't tell your grandchildren about this movie in your glory days.  This is a movie to watch with hot buttered popcorn, a soda, and your sweetie.  It's plain the moviemakers had plenty of fun themselves, so kick back and enjoy.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AEYDNYCWH2IZ.html">A3AEYDNYCWH2IZ</a><br/><p>I have been dying to see this movie since it was in the theatre's and it was SO worth the wait.

From bad-ass assassins to romping sexuallly through sheer force of willpower and muscle - both are shown with aplomb in this film.<br /><br />Whoever this director is, he is on the right road here.

SMITH is slick and loud and a bit empty and maybe even obnoxious, but since it features perhaps the most beautiful couple in the world, I tend to overlook the movie's excesses and transgressions. You just about have to, with films like this which run on sheer glamorous star power and make you cave with its oodles of sex appeal.<br /><br />The movie starts off cute, borrowing a morsel from WHEN HARRY MET SALLY, that bit where married couples are being interviewed. Immediately we catch on that, after five or six years of gradually eroding togetherness, the Smiths' marriage has stagnated. John Smith is a professional engineer. Jane Smith troubleshoots iffy corporate computer servers. They know this about each other. But what each doesn't know is that the other is secretly an elite contract assassin. And their hidden worlds are about to collide.<br /><br />Essentially MR. & MRS. SMITH is a screwball from the hitman's perspective and it's marked with such a heightened sense of fun and cool and style that I half anticipated cameos from Pitt's Ocean's Eleven cronies. It's more lighthearted than <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009Y3PV">Prizzi's Honor</a> and not as dark as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009X75PQ">The War of the Roses</a>. The action pieces are super-charged and over-the-top; the undercover assassin elements are handled well. Is the movie as gritty as, say, the Bourne flicks? No, but it's obvious that this movie isn't going for that grittiness. It's half a dose of provocative marriage-on-the-rocks romance, and half John Woo-inspired bullets ballet.<br /><br />- Jane Smith to her husband John: "Baby, you couldn't find the button with two hands and a map."<br /><br />MR. & MRS. SMITH frames Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt at their banterful best, their caustic, suggestive exchanges perhaps giving us a whiff of what really went on behind the scenes on set (if you buy all those rumors). Jolie and Pitt are Hollywood royalty, and this film capitalizes on their star power and showcases their spectacular chemistry. And it's hard not to get the vapors, watching their sensual dance in Bogot&aacute;, Colombia or that home-wrecking domestic brawl they get into. This film isn't as good as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00026ZG10">True Lies</a> but it's way sexier (and this is with mad respect to Jamie Lee Curtis's hotel room strip scene).<br /><br />And sometimes the curse of being too beautiful kicks in. Pitt and Jolie are so gorgeous that we sometimes forget that these two have got very good acting skills. They're so natural and charismatic at playing these types of roles that one tends to dismiss the work that goes into the portrayal. These guys can act. Props, also, to the scoring. The droll, easy-breezy score is indispensable, transforming what would otherwise have been an unbearable study of a stifling marriage into something that comes across more as a series of comedic domestic squabbles.<br /><br />But, yes, okay, it does feel at times as if the film is trying too hard. There's a bit of overkill.<br /><br />But, dang, look at all the pretty.<br /><br />This Unrated edition comes in two discs. Disc 1 has the feature presentation and Director Doug Liman's film commentary. Disc 2 has the following:<br /><br />- "Confidential Files" features 12 deleted scenes - including Adam Brody's funny extraction scene and a pretty neat (but predictable) alternate ending - and the screenplay of yet another alternate ending, and almost four minutes of gag reel.<br /><br />- "Domestic Violence: Shooting MR. & MRS. SMITH" - the 33-minute Behind-the-Scenes documentary (a worthwhile look, and I liked the break down footage of several scenes, including the two dance pieces).<br /><br />- "Doug's Film School" - Director Doug Liman introduces seven segments: "Framing Device" tracks Adam Brody's providing narration as a framing device for the story (although the studio eventually decided not to go this route). "Mother & Father" is a series of deleted cutaway scenes featuring John and Jane's respective bosses (Jacqueline Bisset and Terrence Stamp, later replaced with Angela Bassett and Keith David). The lengthy "Snowy Ravine" segment features the previsualization and live shooting of the ravine sequence (where you can see Brad Pitt get in a firefight with a cartoon); the ravine sequence later became the desert sequence, the shooting of which is also included (plus the screenplays for both sequences). We see the animated storyboarding Liman used to prep for the "Hood Jump" sequence (where Jane runs over John with her car); screenplay included. "Underground Garage" presents an alternate take of the Smiths' "run or fight" conversation which, in the movie, took place under a sewer grate but in this bonus scene is set in an underground garage; screenplay included. "HomeMade" focuses on the alternate front-end sequence to the big firefight climax (taking place this time in the HomeMade depot center during business hours instead of KostMart at night); also included, two storyboard sequences and the screenplay. Finally, there are "Previsualizations" (rough conceptual animation) of seven scenes.<br /><br />- and three photo galleries.</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>As far as movies go, MR. AND MRS. SMITH is essentially an action movie containing a snippet of intrigue.  However, sentiment for the film will remain high because MR. AND MRS. SMITH will always be looked upon as the film that brought stars Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie together (despite having probably been involved together before working on the production).  The film opens with John and Jane Smith (Pitt and Jolie) discussing their life together and looking back on the rather bored domesticity they shared in the early years of their marriage.  Originally they found each other attractive and compatible.  But, more importantly, the marriage was a convenience for both John and Jane are top international assassins.  Their relationship enters completely different territory when both John and Jane are both sent to assassinate the same target.  They end up getting in each others' way and the man they were sent to assassinate gets away.  They vow to get rid of the other assassin.  Upon discovering that they are trying to kill each other, John and Jane have to decide whether the love they have for each other is real and worth fighting for or to keep fighting until they kill each other.<br /><br />MR. AND MRS. SMITH is slightly better than the usual action flick.  Much of this is because of the film's stars.  As much as I hate to admit it, Brad Pitt is a decent actor and Angelina Jolie is not a terrible actress.  They are both known more for their looks than their talent, but unlike many of the pretty faces that show up in movies they have some acting chops.  However, looks and talent aside, the real reason that MR.AND MRS. SMITH stands out from other similar action movies is because of the chemistry between Pitt and Jolie.  The weakest scenes in the movie are when their characters try to prevent each other from finding out what they really do for a living and when each of their characters "struggles" with how they feel for each other.  They like each other.  They like each other a lot and their passion is white smoking hot.<br /><br />Not being a fan of either Pitt or Jolie, MR. AND MRS. SMITH wasn't a film I was very excited to watch.  I will admit that it was slightly better than I thought it would be.  The story isn't especially strong and there are some scenes that make many James Bond films seem plausible and realistic.  The acting is much better than in many action flicks.  I especially enjoyed Vince Vaughn's supporting role as one of John's co-workers, Eddie.  Even though I know most will be drawn to the film because of either Pitt or Jolie or both, I was more impressed with the secondary actors in the film.  Unfortunately, they receive very little screen time at all.  Highly recommended for fans of Pitt and Jolie.  If you just enjoy watching action films, you could do better, but you could also do much worse.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>Despite the fact that this movie received more attention due to its stars off-screen relationship and most likely destroyed the box-office because of it, there is really no denying that on-screen these two are impeccable together.

They interact so effortlessly together, so naturally and beautifully that it transcends acting altogether.  That really is the biggest draw to `Mr. & Mrs. Smith'.  This is one of those cases where the actors really elevate the body of the film.  `Mr. & Mrs. Smith' has is detractors, but overall this is such a fun film that those faults are easily forgiven.  Angelina Jolie has never been more radiant then she is in this film (I'm telling you, I don't get the Golden Globe `Comedy/Musical' Actress snub at all!!!), and Brad Pitt has never been more charming (some may disagree, but I'm sticking with that statement for the time being).  That coupled with Adam Brody and Vince Vaughn serving up some hilarious supporting performances and you get a well rounded good time.<br /><br />So the movie finds our two stars in a loveless marriage if that is at all believable.  The first scene has them arguing calmly before a marriage councilor.  In a sense they are bored.  They've been married for five or six years and within those years their lives have become so routine, so predictable that they can't stand each other.  What each fails to realize is that their lives are the furthest things from routine, for they really don't know each other at all.  In fact, both John and Jane Smith are assassins working for conflicting agencies, and when they are both hired to assassinate the same target they end up confronted with the truth about each other, and their marriage starts to heat up as they are instructed to take each other out.<br /><br />The film's major detractor is its running length.  While it is only a two hour film and that in itself may not seem like a long time, with a film of the genre it can seem to drag a bit.  I know that seems odd but action films, like comedies, are generally shorter than your dramas and biopics.  By the time you get to the final stretch of `Mr. & Mrs. Smith' you may feel a bit worn out, but it's only a mere few minutes away from the credits so hold in there.  Aside from that minor complaint I really can't say too many bad things about this film.  At times it is a bit clich&eacute;d, but what film isn't these days.  The acting, like I said, really makes up for any and all issues with the film.  Aside from Pitt and Jolie there is Vince Vaughn who is just hysterical here as John's best friend Eddie, and Adam Brody is spot on as Benjamin Danz, a kid who may know more than he's letting on.  I would have loved to see Kerry Washington used a little more than she is.  Her role is really thankless, and she is so very talented.<br /><br />The action sequences are great here, but obviously censored.  The film's original rating was R, at least that's what I had gathered at the time of release, and that significant cuts where made (especially in that already steamy love scene) and I'm sure those cuts inched there way over into some of the violent sequences.  That said, it's not anything too drastic for enjoyment.  The fight/love scene in particular is so breathtakingly done that it is the immediate highlight of the film.  Not that I'm an advocate for spousal abuse (lord knows I'm the farthest thing from) but that particular scene looks like a lot of fun.  Anyways, moving on, the film is entertaining in just about every respect and is more than just a celebrity gossip piece.  So what if this spawned the most widely talked about Hollywood romance in the history of Hollywood romances, that's the furthest thing from the point.  When the dust settles and the paparazzi get their pictures (and those crazy fans get their hugs) we're left with an entertaining, enjoyable and crowd pleasing good time, and that my friends is exactly what we're looking for.</p></br><a href="../users/A13E0ARAXI6KJW.html">A13E0ARAXI6KJW</a><br/><p>This clanging, crashing 2005 superstar coupling seems to aspire to be a new millennium retake on John Huston's "Prizzi's Honor" and Danny DeVito's "War of the Roses", but it turns out to be a gadget-oriented action flick with grand pretensions about how a seemingly ideal couple handle marital discord.  It certainly helps that director Doug Liman (who did a superb job on the underrated "Go" in 1999) has cast two ludicrously attractive leads whose intertwining personal lives would eventually overshadow their onscreen shenanigans. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie star in the title roles, John and Jane Smith, and things start promisingly with Simon Kinberg's scattershot screenplay setting them up as typically upscale married suburbanites who both try to manage professional demands in light of a sagging marriage.<br /><br />As it turns out, they are both highly paid assassins who of course, are hired to rub the other out. This revelation is hardly surprising, but I didn't know it would signal a significant decrease in creativity for the rest of the film even as the fireworks get more explosive. The special effects and swift gunplay can be dazzling but are left on overkill mode, but by far, the worst scene is an overextended fight scene between the two that eschews its black comedy elements in favor of a commercial for domestic violence. But even this would be forgivable if Liman and Kinberg could figure out how to end the story. It seems to breathe on high-octane but strangely remains devoid of any real suspense and then abruptly stops with no real denouement.<br /><br />Pacing is a major problem with the movie as it feels like it goes on for far too long. Luckily, the stars have enough charisma to maintain some interest throughout. Both often lend a nice comic spark to their performances, though neither knows how to convey irony without an irritating wink-wink manner. As Eddie, Mr. Smith's cohort, Vince Vaughan seems to be the only one who seems completely adept at black comedy. Kerry Washington, on the other hand, makes virtually no impression as Mrs. Smith's task force colleague. Even though he shows off an impressive set of six-pack abs, Pitt seems particularly lost at times, but Jolie manages to dominate the pairing with her stunning beauty and take-no-prisoners attitude. It's too bad the story serves merely as a vehicle for their mutual posturing.</p></br></body></html>

We all know Pixar has established itself as the premiere computer generated feature film studio, but as if gems like the Toy Stories aren't proof enough of their supremacy, enter Monsters Inc.  Nine years old already, this one manages to push all of the right buttons of what a CG feature film could and should be while managing to appeal to viewers of all ages.<br /><br />Reaching the top of a given industry can be serendipitous, sure but this one here represents proof of the gradual climbing process that separates this studio from the others.<br /><br />Monsters Inc., for the two or three human beings on earth who have yet to see it, follows James P "Sulley" Sullivan (John Goodman), a big blue furry monster and his friend and coworker Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal), a smaller green Cyclops, who happen to work at the power company within the city of Monstropolis: Monsters Inc.<br /><br />Subscribers to the theory that monsters work at the utility companies in our own world will be glad to know that in Monstropolis, energy is derived not from the burning of coal or turning of turbines but by refining human screams, which are collected in steel canisters.<br /><br />The monsters travel through doors linked to those in children's' bedrooms in our world and do their best to scare said kids into a nice shriek of terror. Sulley just so happens to be the number one scream-generator at Monsters, Inc. despite intense rivalry from the #2 guy, Randall Boggs (Steve Buscemi). Meanwhile poor Mike, a member of the preparation team, handles Sulley's paperwork, arranges doors and changes his collecting cylinders.  It turns out only the biggest, scariest and most elite employees have what it takes to become scarers.<br /><br />Sulley and Mike's careers at Monsters, Inc. and the very welfare of Monstropolis are in jeopardy once Sulley accidentally lets a human child into the monster.  It turns out that while humans are conditioned to fear monsters, so too are monsters trained to be terrified of human children.<br /><br />What we have here basically is a layered parody of blue-collar life as the catalyst to deliver an inversed look at the myths all kids can relate with.  The plot structure is impeccably tight with enough levels of amusement to appeal (classily) to just about anyone who encounters it.<br /><br />I'm personally partial to all of the instances where an oblivious Mike Wazowski, a role seemingly custom made for Billy Crystal, narrowly avoids fame but is no less enthusiastic about it.<br /><br />Taking in this film, even a decade after its initial release, it becomes apparent that Pixar's charm is actually derived from some of the simplest ideas imaginable.  In fact most other animated films suddenly look way overcomplicated by comparison.  The visuals have since been outdone in terns of complexity, color, and texturing yet few releases since can claim having delivered such a well-rounded package.<br /><br />Additionally a lively Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround EX mix done up by a team at Skywalker Sound. It's as active, and vibrant as the visuals! As a bonus Randy Newman's charming score comes through with spectacular clarity.<br /><br />In all, it had been nearly a decade since my last visit to Monsters Inc. and as a result of a recent mission to visit/ review as many computer generated features as possible, purchased the 2-disc DVD set being reviewed here. Conclusion: Pixar's path to supremacy is lined with some of the finer examples of the genre.</p></br><a href="../users/A1C58YXM2A30CY.html">A1C58YXM2A30CY</a><br/><p>Monsters Inc. is a delightfully funny film by Pixar and Disney.  Released in 2001, Monsters, Inc. reflects the modern human world in many ways, with production quotas, rolling blackouts, and families and children in bustling Monsteropolis.<br /><br />Almost an Abbott and Costello film, Sully & his assistant and best friend, Mike Wazowski.  Randall is Sully's greatest competitor, a scaly, evil chameleon with greed at his heart.<br /><br />Sully does the scaring of children through doors that when connected to children's bedroom closets become a doorway into the human dimension.  Energy is collected from the screams and powers the Monsteropolis.<br /><br />But kids are not getting as scared as they used to.  To increase the quota, there is corruption and intrigue afoot, which is realistic for an animated film.<br /><br />The adult gags and references, such as Harryhausen's Restaurant, are fun to see.  Also, with children being seen as a threat to Monster-dom, there are great penalties for even the slightest contamination from the child's world.  A sock on one unlucky monster's back is enough for panic by the yellow squad of the CDA: Child Detection Agency.<br /><br />The animators and writers made Randall the complete opposite of Sully.  Where Sully is kind, intelligent and gentle, Randall is sly, secretive and evil.  Randall will stop at nothing to get his own ends.<br /><br />The one-eyed Mike is fun to watch and see how the animators give a one-eyed guy such emotion.  He's pretty silly too where he just doesn't get what people are trying to say to him.<br /><br />Crime does not pay and making lemonade out of lemons are good lessons for kids.<br /><br />The "blooper" reel at the end is great, and the jazz music is well done.<br /><br />Great entertainment from Disney.<br /><br />The voice actors include:<br /><br />John Goodman<br />Billy Crystal<br />Mary Gibbs<br />Steve Buscemi<br />James Coburn<br />Jennifer Tilly<br /><br />Other Pixar Films:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030IIYWA">Toy Story (Two-Disc Special Edition Blu-ray/DVD Combo w/ Blu-ray Packaging)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EOQWF8">Wall-E (Two-Disc and BD Live) [Blu-ray</a>]<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JNS0">Cars (Widescreen Edition)</a></p></br><a href="../users/AWG2O9C42XW5G.html">AWG2O9C42XW5G</a><br/><p>This movie is awesome. monsters inc. is a heartwarmming movie about friendship between two unlikely and loveable characters who are actually scared of humans themselfs. when one day a little girl follows them back into thier own world. now thats where the fun starts. this is a good movie and i recommend this movie for eveyone</p></br><a href="../users/A3CN9CCJUNIPKT.html">A3CN9CCJUNIPKT</a><br/><p>"Monsters, Inc.":  4-Disc Edition (BluRay/DVD combo)<br />(Pixar)<br />-------------------------------------------------------------<br />Great movie, one of the best. I first saw it in the theater when it came out, in Emeryville, CA, near the Pixar studios and they had a ginormous, life-sized Sully in the lobby.. With real fur!  So cool... but the movie was even better.<br /><br />I am knocking a point off this particular edition, however, because it's not quite the bargain I thought it would be.  When I wanted to purchase "Monsters, Inc." for my kid, and saw that they had an affordable combo pack that had both DVD and Blu-Ray versions, I thought, well, I might get a Blu-Ray someday, so that could come in handy. Yeah, I'll get it!  Unfortunately, the DVD disc does not also include the same material as the Blu-Ray, so a bunch of games and bonus features are not included, which really bummed my daughter out.  These features were already embedded in the old DVD edition: Disney has purposely *removed* them in order to steer customers towards the new format. As a consumer, I resent this enormously, and I think other potential buyers might want to know that the DVD version has been downgraded and will not be as much fun for your kid as you might hope.  Disney is being needlessly manipulative with its product: why not just give us a package that really is in *both* formats?<br /><br />It's still a great movie, though!!  (Joe Sixpack, ReadThatAgain children's media reviews)<br /><br />----------------------------------<br /><br />(PS.... Sorry, but Amazon aggregates reviews of different formats all together in one review pool.  If I hadn't had issues with the DVD/Blu-Ray bundling, I would have given this a ten-star review.  Same problem with "Up" too, by the way.)</p></br><a href="../users/A3EISFBTLEQC69.html">A3EISFBTLEQC69</a><br/><p>This movie is just so good.  I loved it.  It was so original.

Great story about the Monsters all little kids fear in their bed at night, and their interaction with those kids.

If you liked Toy Story & Finding Nemo, then you will without a doubt want this movie for your collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>If Cars is good, which I hope it is cause trailers don't make it look good, then Monsters Inc is probably my least favorite Pixar film. But of course like the saying goes, it's not my favorite but it's still good. It just doesn't have the hilarity of Toy Story 2, the amazing technical ability of Finding Nemo or the energy of the Incredibles. In the end, Monsters Inc is like films such as Bambi or Dumbo, they're not funny but they still entertain us regardless.<br /><br />In the world of Monstropolis, their power comes not from traditional electricity but from childrens' screams turned into energy. So we have "scarers", monsters who use a vast supply of doors that lead into a child's bedroom and literally scare the kids to get the screams. Only problem is kids are getting really hard to scare. Top scarer Sulley working late one night finds a door left behind, and a kid. And monsters have been conditioned to believe kids are dangerous so he tries avoiding her only she's really attached to him.<br /><br />Only he can't really bring her back because Sulley's rival Randall is after her. Helping out Sulley is Mike, his assistant, and figuring out how to bring "Boo" back to her own room without being detected. This leads to an impressive animation sequence where they see just where all the doors are.<br /><br />The film may not be as funny as previous entries(or for that matter, the next 2) but it's certainly got a warmth and heart to it, something definately lacking in today's animation films. Pretty much bringing all the charm almost single-handedly is "Boo", the girl who ends up in Monster world. Speaking in baby talk and a word now and then, she's certainly the kind of child you'd want to have. Billy Crystal plays Mike and he's got that manic voice going on that Robin Williams did in Aladdin(and again in Robots).<br /><br />One thing that is a sight to watch is the technical aspect of the animation. One scene early on when Mike and Sulley walk to work certainly looks vibrant and colorful and Sulley's hair looks great plus the aforementioned "door room". The humans are certainly looking better too, the Toy Story humans definately looked odd but they've gotten better, with their best probably being their last film, the Incredibles.<br /><br />The only one I'm missing for Pixar films on DVD is Toy Story 2 and of course that comes out boxing day(and obviously Cars but that's not even in theatres out, here's hoping it's good) but this film certainly is good, even if you have a child(ren) or not.</p></br><a href="../users/AUSATFDSU2INS.html">AUSATFDSU2INS</a><br/><p>It's nighttime. Your mom gives you a good night kiss and closes the door. Quietly you try to sleep when suddenly you feel a creak in the door. The closet opens and a monster comes out to steal you a scream<br /><br />.<br /><br />For you it's a nightmare. To the monster it's a way to produce some energy. And that's the premise of Monsters Inc.<br /><br />The Monster City is located at the other side of the closet. Diverse and weird creatures wander on the streets in their daily routines, most of them without interacting with the humans. A particular company, Monsters Inc., transforms children's nighttime screams in energetic resources to keep the city working properly.<br /><br />Monsters Inc staff is trained to scare, and no one is better than James Sullivan "Sully" (John Goodman), who alongside Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal, a riot) is the best team of energy collectors in the company<br /><br />Monsters must avoid contact with the children, because they think children are contagious (genius premise); neither can allow them to go to the monster world, since they can't predict what horrible consequences would follow.<br /><br />And exactly that's what happens. A little girl goes through the door and sends Mike and Sully in an unprecedented adventure.<br /><br />Filled with honest laughs, warm and funny, Monsters is a charming movie with a story as original as their predecessor, Toy Story and A Bug's Life.<br /><br />In this adventure, Pixar once again pushes the excellence level in animated movies, using 2.5 million render marks, compared with the 1.1 used in Toy Story. Such accomplishments are obvious and admirable, especially in sequences where you can see clearly the blue skin of Sully in movement with the air, Boo's hair or the wonderful facial expressions of Mike.<br /><br />This is a happy movie, full of joy and a good lesson. Fear creates power, but a negative one, which inhibits people (and monsters). But, as our character discovers, there are other kinds of power, much stronger, like a good laugh, to deal with our "inner demons" and come out winners in life.<br /><br />Now about the DVD, I have to say that comes with great extras and bonus.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RKI7RPP5CJMG.html">A2RKI7RPP5CJMG</a><br/><p>"Monsters, Inc." is a funny addition to anyone's Pixar library.  It's funnier than "A Bug's Life" and has a storyline that holds up better than "Toy Story."  Sully and Mike are a great duo in this tale and it's fun to watch them interact with each other and Boo.  The opening sequence in the test "Scare" room is funny, and the following sequence at Sully's house is hilarious.  Steve Buscemi is a standout as Randall, the conniving culprit of the movie.  He's devilishly funny and Mr. Waternoose isn't so bad either.<br />All of the monsters in this movie are designed with brilliancy.  None of them come across as too scary for youngsters to watch.  A cameo appearance by the "Abominable Snowman" leads to a funny moment with yellow sno-cones.<br />My 2 year-old wouldn't stop watching this movie for weeks after we purchased it, and now she's hooked on it again.<br />Humor for adults is included as well, but there is nothing offensive about any part of this movie.  It's fun for everyone in the house and will hold the attention of even the toughest two year old critics.</p></br><a href="../users/A138826JMC0J3T.html">A138826JMC0J3T</a><br/><p>Monsters Inc is another great hit from the Disney/Pixar series! Monstaers Inc is about the world of Monsters in our closets and why they come out. In the movie, it's established that a scream will give power and energy, that same power and energy is needed to fuel the city of the Monsters. So like factory clock work, the Monsters go in every morning (night for us humans) and scare people to get that scream.<p>Sully (John Goodman) is the #1 Scarer and his partner Mike (Billy Crystal) is there at his side making sure he catches each scream. Their biggest competition for the #1 slot is Randall (Steve Buscemi). After a night's work, Mike decides to go home and Sully stay behind making sure his paperwork is done and that's when Sully finds Randall cheating and helping his numbers by doing unauthorized scares! Realizing this Sully goes to investigate and finds out that by accident, a little girl has broken into the Monster world! It's up to Sully and Mike to hide her from the authorities and get her home dafely. It's a animaterd comedy adventure that keeps you rolling and brings you to tears.<p>I have to admit, I'm not much of a Disney fan anymore ever since the power days of Disney in the late 80's with the Little Mermaid to 1994's The Lion King, but NOW with these great computer animated full features, I can safely say that I can't wait for Disney to do more of these because there are enjoyable for all ages.<p>Plus the bonus DVD has a lot of great extras in it like the short feature &quot;Mike's New Car&quot;, outtakes and other great features. This is a movie that I'd suggest any family to pop in and have a family movie night. And of course if you're looking for more great Disney/Pixar films, check out TOY STORY and TOY STORY 2 and A BUG'S LIFE. You'll be greatly satisfied. Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A3TUZOJZM9008Y.html">A3TUZOJZM9008Y</a><br/><p>Admittedly, I am a fan of Pixar's work. Their artists have done some incredible animated features over the years. Between the "Toy Story" movies and "A Bug's Life," they have managed in a short time to build an impressive track record. Their shorts are also among the best ever produced. So my expectations going into this movie were very high.<p>The story concerns the monsters in your closet. The theory being that their world runs of the energy produced by children's screams. Sulley (John Goodman) is number one at getting screams. His main rival (Steve Buschemi) will do anything to gain the top spot. Oh, and they consider the touch of a human child to be toxic.<p>While not as instantly relatable as "Toy Story," the movie builds on the talents of Goodman and Billy Crystal (Mike) to bring you into this make-believe world as Sulley and Mike try to get little Boo back through the closet door to the safety of her bedroom.<p>Disney/Pixar has presented this well on DVD. Both Widescreen and Pan & Scan versions are available on the first disc. The second disc has games, outtakes, an award winning animated short, and a fun (easy to find) Easter Egg.<p>All in all, if you enjoy Pixar's work, or animated features in general, this is a must have for your collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IANEBSMVGHS9.html">A1IANEBSMVGHS9</a><br/><p>DISC ONE: For moviegoers during summer of 2001, the marquee was packed with animated options: Shrek, Atlantis, Final Fantasy and Monsters, Inc. If you disect the movies, the first two end up being dissapointing when viewed in the small screen and Final Fantasy is just made with a different public in mind. Now, Monsters, Inc. achieves in DVD format the same feel you got when you (hopefully) saw it in theaters: the movie IS a great movie for all ages. No bells and whistles: simply brilliant!<p>The script is very funny, clever and innovative (it is worth seeing on the DVD how much it evolved from the original treatment it was going to have...), turning around the ageless childhood fear of monsters into a fear of kids BY monsters, who need kids' screams in order to power their society. Top ranking scarer, big, blue and furry Sulley (voiced by John Goodman) and his one-eyed assitant, Mike Wazowski (brilliantly played by Billy Crystal) see their "monstrous" lives turned around when Sulley accidentally brings a little girl (Boo) by accident into their monster world.<p>Complementing the script and the voices, the animation is incredible. The faces of the characters, the blinking of the eyes (the red in the eyes, when Mike sprays antibacterial stuff on his face, the glassy look in Sulley's eyes toward the end of the movie), the fur of Sulley (every hair moving just as if he were real), the illumination all through the movie. Plus the persecution scene leaves you speechless: there's SO MUCH happening in it, and it's so seamless: one of the great animation accomplishments of the movie without any doubt.<p>DISC TWO: One element that powerfully called my attention is the very human (is that ironic or what?) touch that the second disc has. For example, the Director, the two Co-Directors and the Producer appear in the very beginning, showing you how to find your way around the DVD. It's not that it's a convoluted DVD or anything of that sort: simply the two discs are packed with all sorts of goodies and they are making an effort to have you find it all.<p>One of the best things included in disc 2 is the Oscar-winning animated short film "For The Birds" which we all enjoyed in theaters so much right before Monsters started. Also included are the complete outtakes (call them "bloopers" from the movie, if you may, whose concept alone makes you scratch your head in surprise while you laugh till it hurts). But the fun to disc two doesn't end there: there is a wealth of details for the more technically-inclined or those who simply are curious about the way animation is done, with a whole tour through the process, from story reels, to layout, animation, simulation (a key component in the level of perfection accomplished with Sulley's fur and the way Boo's big shirt works) ahd shading/lighting. Same thing is done with design and music & sound. Wrapping up the goodies is a pretty fun tour of Pixar studios where you can catch a glimpse of why these guys are able to come up with such a funny movie: they're having a blast there! :D<p>Technical comments<br />-If you view the DVD on a computer (as I did), the first time you do it, you will go through the installation of the InterActual player software. Hit "Accept" at every step of the way: whether you like it or not, you won't be able to take advantage of all the elements in the DVDs unless you view it using this software...<br />-Another detail for computer users: the "Peek-A-Boo Door game" was useless on my computer. It's designed to be played when viewing the DVD on a DVD player. In fact, it almost brings my laptop to its knees. So, my recommendation to you DVD-viewers using a computer to go past the intro page with all the games on it and click on to view the movie.<br />-Subtitles included are in English only, so that probably will not make Spanish-only or French-only-speaking viewers too happy, n'est-ce pas? Verdad?<p>In general, though, excellent! Five stars to this incredible production by Disney and to its Two-Disc Collector's Edition. You will enjoy every bit of it and watch it several times over.</p></br><a href="../users/A2C27IQUH9N1Z.html">A2C27IQUH9N1Z</a><br/><p>Having a young child, we were waiting for this movie to come out on cable or dvd -- no chance of going to a theater yet!  So we were delighted to receive an advance copy from an online store and Disney/PIXAR.  We've watched the film at least six times in the past four days.<p>The movie is terrific -- one of those films that children of different ages can enjoy AND adults can watch multiple times without going insane.  This is the story of Monsters Incorporated, an energy supply company based in Monstropolis.  In this reality, energy comes in the form of children's screams, and to that end Monsters, Inc. employees emerge from closets all over the world in order to collect a few GigaHowls and keep everyone's lamps and toasters running.  The best scare team at Monsters, Inc.  is John "Sulley" Sullivan (John Goodman) and his assistant Mike (Billy Crystal).  One evening after hours, a child gets through a closet door and enters Monstropolis.  Not good, considering monsters are scared of kids and believe their touch is toxic.  Over the course of the movie Sulley and even Mike become attached to "Boo", risking health and careers to get her back to her home.  In the meantime, incorrigible adorable Boo is having a great time scaring all the big monsters.<p>The film is incredibly well done, as technically flawless as earlier PIXAR productions, the Toy Story series and A Bug's Life, but even funnier.  John Goodman perfectly voices gentle, affable Sulley, and Billy Crystal creates Mike, a frantic egotist who is also optimistic and loyal.  In other words, with more depth than half the human characters being written today.  The animation is stunning, and the story is lots of fun.  Nothing here to disturb little kids, and a lot to entertain them.  The only part I didn't like much was the opening credit sequence, which was reminiscent of 60s bedroom farces, but that's what the Select Scene feature is for.<p>There are two discs here.  On Disc One you can view the film in fullscreen or widescreen format.  Audio commentary by the director and staff is available with the latter.  English captions, audio and video optimizers, and sneak peeks at PIXAR's upcoming "Finding Nemo" and Disney's "Lilo & Stitch" are also here.  Disc Two contains almost three-and-a-half hours of amazing dvd extras. There's an interesting 20-minute tour of PIXAR; a very funny bloopers reel (that also plays during the credits of the fullscreen version); storyboards; deleted scenes; recording studio footage; character design; trailers and tv spots; footage of the Hollywood premiere; discussion of tie-in toys; a poster gallery; two Monsters Inc.-related segments from Ponkickies, a goofy Japanese animated show; Peek-a-Boo, a game; a history of Monster World; a Monsters Inc. employee handbook; and an introduction to Monsters Inc.'s version of baseball cards called Scarer Cards.  The 13-minute original treatment and several scenes from an alternative story are presented that are as funny as the one that made it to the screen. <p>Our favorite extras were the outtakes; a new animated short, "Mike's Car"; the Oscar winning PIXAR short, "For the Birds"; fly-arounds of several movie locations; the guide to "in" jokes (eg, the appearance of Toy Story 2's Jessie when Boo is showing her favorite toys to Sulley); a fascinating behind-the-scenes look at the technical wizardry required to produce complex backgrounds, Sulley's fur, Boo's shirt and the city of Monstropolis; being able to watch a scene as it was done in storyboard, layout, animation or finished presentation; and a fun 4-minute clip with a few seconds of dialogue in each of the 30+ languages into which the film was translated.  There's even a brief appearance by PIXAR CEO Steve Jobs.<p>Packaging and foldout are nice, and include a contest entry form (to win Disney dvds), a free tie-in storybook offer, and a coupon book (for popcorn; Monsters Inc. tie-ins; Disney storybooks, videos and dvds; and Disney on Ice).  With one exception we ran everything on our dvd player without a glitch, and could not be more pleased with this very funny family film and the many many extra features.<p>Highest recommendation.</p></br><a href="../users/A9LNWA25IM2DX.html">A9LNWA25IM2DX</a><br/><p>Before anyone starts saying this has not been released yet and  there cannot be a review of the Bluray edition let me tell you this, this movie has been available in Japan and Mexico for quite some time now, and I was able to get a copy of the Mexican edition, which was at one time, identical to the one to be released in the US. It is a 3 disc edition (2 BD plus DVD copy of the movie), this has now been changed to a 4 disc set in the US to include the additional digital copy.<br /><br />Disc one starts with an intro by director Pete Docter, in which he pretty much explains all the contents in this 'glorious' high definition version of the movie.  A mini documentary on the 'Monsters, Inc: Ride & Go Seek ' ride in Disney Japan is also included. The highlight to me was the creators 'Round table' in which they talk about the process of creating the movie, some deleted scenes not included in prior DVD versions are shown here and they finally explained to me why is it so difficult to get a reservation at 'Harryhausen's' if all the staff from the scare floor seems to hang around there!<br /><br />The Pixar shorts 'For the birds' and 'Mike's new car' (originally made on 4:3 format) are also included in HD format (as previously released in 'Pixar shorts)<br /><br />The movie is presented in 1:85:1 aspect ratio. The word that comes to mind to describe how this looks is simply 'Beautiful', the colors, the textures, Sullivan's fur, the character's skin textures, Roz' sweater. Details pop up, colors are bright and clear. I had never noted that the real name of 'Boo' is actually in the movie until I saw it on Bluray!<br /><br />The audio is another improvement of this BD edition. Presented in an uncompressed 5.1 track, the music by Randy Newman and the sound effects (check the audio in the door chamber sequence or every time 'Boo' laughs/cries and there is a power variation) sound just great. Spanish and French Dolby Digital tracks are also included. An audio commentary with the creators provides a lot of details of the movie, since I have watched this over and over with my 2 year old kid I have been able to play the commentary a couple times so he watches the movie and I learn about how it was made.<br /><br />One thing I noted though, the end credits in the Bluray are not the same as in the DVD. The DVD will have the bloopers play while the credits roll, while the Bluray does not. Those 'Bloopers' though are included in disc 2 as additional features.<br /><br />Disc 2 includes a feature called the 'Employee's manual' Additional spots created to promote the film are included too. Storyboards and drawings from the artists in HD as well as the '100 doors challenge', which is like a trivia game in which based on your responses you will be offered a position in Monsters Inc. Disc 3 as mentioned earlier, is a DVD copy of the movie (in the Mexican edition the 4:3 presentation is included, NOT widescreen) which is great as my kid can have that to watch it as many times as he desires.<br /><br />Fans of the movie or any Pixar movie should not miss this!</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>The best films, regardless if they're for kids or adults, all have the same thing in common--great storytelling, characterizations and imaginative direction. Pixar's Monsters, Inc. has all three in spades. From the film's satirical opening m inutes (with its parody of commericals and corporate America)to its last suspense filled frames, Monsters, Inc. packs humor and heart into a fun filled movie. Director Pete Doctor has crafted a film that entertains whether watched for the first time for the tenth. <p>John Goodman's performance as Sully and Billy Crystal's performance as Mike demonstrate that not all the best acting is found in serious high minded films. Both give comedic performances that rival the best live action work each has done. What's particularly memorable about the film is the imaginative voice casting. Without the right performer, the best animation won't reach an audience. Monsters, Inc. manages to do both exceptionally well. The opening titles (with their witty reference to the old Gerald McBong McBong cartoons)can't even begin to prepare you for the fun that follows.<p>The extras on this 2 DVD set are particularly fun. The animated short about Mike's new car is a blast (it's only found on the video version) and the inside look at Pixar shows us not only who comes up with these nutty ideas but how they give birth to them as well. There's also a section that shows viewers where all the inside jokes are (although I have the sneaking suspicion that there are still a few gems hidden in there somewhere). The Boo game is fun for little ones and the DVD-Rom features are a nice addition as well.<p>The digital picture transfer is spectacular. The widescreen and standard screen formats are both available on the same disc (like with Toy Story 2). It's amazing how detailed the sound effects are on films like this. Viewers could listen to this film and still chuckle.<p>I'd also like to comment on Randy Newman's score. Newman is probably one of the most under rated songwriters/film scorers around. His work on this film (like his best work including his great score for Ragtime) helps accent the action and humor. Newman's sardonic wit is the perfect compliment to Pixar's films.<p> Monsters, Inc. (like Toy Story before it) has set a new benchmark for animated family films; it's sleek, intelligent and funny managing to reach kids and adults equally well.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KY68OTSNHM3G.html">A3KY68OTSNHM3G</a><br/><p>Monsters, Inc. stars Sully (John Goodman) and Mike (Billy Crystal).  The two work for Monsters, Inc, a company that produces power by scaring children in their rooms and capturing their screams.  However, children are extremely dangerous to the monsters.  One touch from a child can kill a monster.  Boo, a little girl, manages to sneak through her closet door and into Monsters, Inc unnoticed.  She is soon discovered by Mike and Sully, who must find a way to get her back safely in her room while keeping her out of sight of the other monsters, especially Randall (Steve Buscemi), who is Sully's biggest rival.  What follows is numerous laughs and close calls as Mike, Sully, and Boo try to outsmart the others.  <p>This is a fun movie for adults as well as children.  Boo is your typical toddler; curious, funny, and always trying to get into trouble while Mike and Sully take on the role of surrogate parents as they try to keep Boo from the others. The outtakes at the end of the movie are funny as well.  Overall, this is a very funny and touching film.  The animation and acting are excellent, and the story line will definitely keep both children and adults laughing all the way through.</p></br><a href="../users/A29QA79VLQGHY6.html">A29QA79VLQGHY6</a><br/><p>At Pixar Animation, the love of detail both seen and unseen is expressed in the company mantra: &quot;We sand the undersides of the drawers.&quot; The fruits of this obsession are on display in the DVD release of &quot;Monsters, Inc.,&quot; the animation blockbuster that examines when bad things happen to things that go bump in the night. <p>The Buena Vista Home Entertainment release sprawls over two discs, with a clear separation of extras for kids (they enter a door marked Monsters) and adults (Humans). The segregation is helpful, but everyone will want to go everywhere anyway. A new &quot;Monster's, Inc.&quot; cartoon (&quot;Mike's New Car&quot;) exclusive to the disc should delight everyone, regardless of age. It includes what could be a dubious first: a cartoon character using a cell phone when trouble strikes. <p>The crush of special features can be a bit much, so the chronically zany folks at Pixar do their best to help along viewers. Clad in Hawaiian shirts and groomed for Disneyland duty, key filmmakers do video intros for many of the extras categories.  Civilians will find the filmmakers' commentary quite a challenge, however. Away from the visual arena, the men of Pixar lose their zip, with the discussion devolving into a survey of the film's problem-solving process. As with many group commentaries, it's hard to tell who is talking -- and when they drift off into a long discussion about the Sock, you probably won't care.<p> &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; looks great, of course. Those lucky enough to first see the film in theaters with digital projection will find the look a bit soft, but the pastels are undeniably beautiful and easy on the eyes. The Dolby Digital EX 5.1 mix sounds solid and focused, with the rear channels used effectively for some dialogue. Voice talents Billy Crystal (the motor-mouthed, one-eyed Mike Wazowski), John Goodman (Sulley) and Jennifer Tilly are seen on the job. One extra, a Sulley and Mike game developed for a Japanese TV show, was &quot;very creepy,&quot; my kid noted.</p></br><a href="../users/A2W00XKTTF1G0Z.html">A2W00XKTTF1G0Z</a><br/><p>MONSTERS, INC. is a movie that when I saw it in the theatre didn't really knock my socks off as I thought it would. Juts a few things short of interesting and for me, not as entertaining as Toy Story or A Bug's Life. (Even Toy Story 2 was a little better than this.)<p>Some standout performances by Billy Crystal (America's Sweethearts, Analyze That) and John Goodman (Emperor's New Groove, What Planet Are You From?)and even Jennifer Tilly (Stuart Little, The Muse) and of course some great gag bits and slapstick humor for a computer generated film. Directed by Peter Doctor (writer of Toy Story 1 &amp; 2) who gives the film a flavor of color and flare.<p>The story is that of the concept that monsters scare you under your bed in and in your closet as a kid and this is how they do it. Very mechanical and very routine. Their job is to collect the screams of the scars and then turn it into power and energy for Monstropolis. There is one fear; the Monsters are more scared of the kids they scare then the kids themselves. Guess what? One gets in the Monster world. I'll let you imagine what happens next.<p>Now the DVD extra's are amazing. There is a very funny NEW short called Mike's New Car, which is short but hysterical. There are games, and Monster training videos and manuals and CDRom extras too. Music videos and a ton of production information on how the film was made and produced. The extras on the DVD are worth it alone. You'll enjoy this one.

After making movies "A Bug's Life", "Toy Story", and "Toy Story II", Pixar and Disney hits it off big with "Monsters, Inc."<p>Children have always been afraid of monsters in their closet. They never realize what an important role they play in keeping the city of Monstropolis running. 'Monster Incorporations' is the corporation which 'takes and stores' 'scream energy'. Hiring a different assortment monsters to scare children to use their screams as energy to power up the whole of Monstropolis, 'Monsters Inc.' is a very powerful company. Until recently when the head of the company, Waternoose (James Coburn), finds out that the business is not doing well. Things get worse when top scare-er James P. "Sulley" Sullivan (John Goodman) gets involved in a situation where a young girl, named 'Boo' (Marry Gibbs), comes from the real world into the monster's world. She immediately attaches herself to Sulley who promptly asks for help from his best friend and assistant, Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal). Can they keep the 'Child Detection Crew' from finding Boo? And can they make sure she gets home before monster rival to Sulley, Randall (Steve Buscemi) has his evil plans for Boo completed? Also starring is Celia (Jennifer Tilly) as Mike's girlfriend whom he's madly in love with, Roz (Bob Peterson) the cantankerous, stubborn, and strict worker at Monster's Inc., and Fungus with the voice of Frank Oz.<p>A most entertaining and hilarious movie, the perfect to movie to spend time watching with the family. The whole idea of "Monsters, Inc." is very original and interesting. From 'scream energy' to Monstropolis, from Child Detection Agency to closet doors being the doorway between the real world and the monster's world. The CG was excellent also, from the quality of Sulley's fur to Mike's eye, everything is well done making everything seem so real. One point I liked best was Randall, the whole idea of him being able to blend in to his surroundings and 'disappear' is pretty freaky for even older kids! Two thumbs up for fantastic work. Pixar also made very good choices for the voice talents of Sulley and Mike. John Goodman I have heard as Pacha in "The Emperor's New Groove". But never have I heard Billy Crystal's voice in any animation movie and you've got to admit, he's VERY GOOD at it! Just listening to him makes me laugh, always reminding me of his role as 'Miracle Max' in "The Princess Bride" (one of my all-time favorite movies).<br /><br />But one of the main things I loved about the movie is the well-done script. There are some very obvious jokes while some very subtle and witty humor is put in, making the movie very enjoyable for adults, too. One of the funniest things I liked about the movie is Celia's... hair. She's a monster of course and her hair is actually many snakes so the ends of her hair are snakes heads. And when she gets angry, you can see some tail ends 'rattling' making a rattlesnakes noise! I thought that was VERY hilarious and I was laughing so hard! Also another favorite part of mine is where Sulley is being attacked by Randall and Mike has NO clue to what's going on! <p>And of course, no one can miss any of the bloopers at the end of the movie. And still even after that, we get to see a very funny 'Broadway musical' (I forgot the name though I know that even just hearing it makes you laugh!). Then keep going to the very end of the film where you can read, "No monsters were harmed in the making of this movie." :-) Then there's the very beginning of the movie, before the story starts, you can watch Oscar-Award winning short film "For the Birds". It just simply cracked me up! The birds were so funny!<p>So if I STILL haven't convinced you to see this film, I don't know what else to say but, "you're missing out on one of the best family films ever." I know I'll be making sure to get the DVD when it comes out which is jam-packed with special features!</p></br><a href="../users/ACVFTS9X2MKJ8.html">ACVFTS9X2MKJ8</a><br/><p>The writer's of this story had to be on some serious "mind-blowing" drugs.<br /><br />The concept here is so original.  No other movie, ever, has invented a story of incredible uniqueness, such as this.<br /><br />Imagine, a power plant.  And how it runs is by monster's going through doors, to go into children's room's and scaring them in their sleep.  The screams of the children fill cylinders that are attached to the door's outside.  The louder the scream, the more power has been collected.  Monster's compete with each other to become "scarer of the month".  And the power plant employees (the monsters) all have to avoid contamination. Which, in this case, is having the children they scare or any of the children's belongings (socks, toys, etc.) touch them.<br /><br />I believe that this film was made for an adult audience.  Not that it's vulgar or suggestive, but only because of it's about a power plant (something that children wouldn't care about).  And all the basic routines of working at a power plant that may obviously be far beyond a typical child's comprehension.<br /><br />This film is so "out there!"  I absolutely love it.  And it looks so good on a high-definition TV and my high definition digital-to-digital HDMI DVD player.  It's a great demonstration DVD for my awesome new TV.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PNTEDGMOLMOY.html">A2PNTEDGMOLMOY</a><br/><p>&quot;Monster's, Inc.&quot; combines a fantastic cast, cutting edge imagination, and a tender storyline into a wonderful, delightful family film . . . it may even cure the nighttime frights of your wee ones!<p>Most of us were scared stiff at some point in our childhood by the spooky, imaginary &quot;monsters in the closet,&quot; usually after we've read &quot;Where the Wild Things Are&quot; for the first time.  &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; plays on that near-universal fear by creating a rational explanation -- monsters live in a parallel universe, connected to ours by closet doors, and they power their land by the energy contained in human screams.  Makes perfect sense!<p>Sulley (the hilarious John Goodman) is a celebrity in Monstropolis as the leading scare-getter for Monster's, Inc.  Sulley is generally a lovable big blue yeti-bear-creature, but he can be quite terrifying.  Blissfully unaware of the terror he unleashes, he enjoys his job.  Basking in Sulley's reflected glory is his sidekick and assistant, Mike Waznowski (Billy Crystal, perfect as ever).  Mike is a lime-green-yellow glob with one giant eye and an even larger mouth.  He helps Sulley get the screams and stay one step ahead of the competition.<p>And the competition is fierce.  The dragon-chameleon Boggs (Steve Buscemi, suitably creepy without being too scary for the kids) is right on Sulley's heels to be the scream champion, and he's willing to go to any lengths to beat his nemesis.<p>All is well in Monstropolis until Boo, a human child, accidentally finds her way through the closet and into Monstropolis.  It seems that as scared as kids are of monsters, the monsters are equally scared of the kids -- their touch (allegedly) brings death and ruin.  (This misunderstanding leads to great comic scenes as X-Files-type HAZMAT crews invade every time there's a kid sighting, usually to the woe of the monster who has seemingly been infected by the kid!)<p>Like all Pixar films, the glories are in the details.  Check out the gentle satire of Hollywood celebrity culture, of mindless bureaucracy, and the perils of romance in the office.  The animation is also wonderful -- Pixar continues to evolve with every picture.  For example, Sulley's fuzzy hair is fully articulated as he zooms through various escapades. <p>The story is fast-paced, with enough jokes to keep the adults laughing . . . which is good, 'cause your kids will likely keep throwing this into the DVD player.<p>Speaking of the DVD -- there are lots of fun extras on this two-disc set.  Personal favorites include the fake &quot;outtakes,&quot; similar to those at the end of &quot;A Bug's Life,&quot; a short film featuring Mike showing Sulley his new hi-tech car (with hilarious consequences), and an Oscar-winning short film, &quot;For the Birds,&quot; which shows how funny animation can be, even in short doses.  There are additional extras that will keep the kiddies occupied for hours.  <p>All in all, a must for the family's DVD library.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EJYJC25OJVKK.html">A3EJYJC25OJVKK</a><br/><p>"Monsters Inc" gets my nod as my favorite of the trainload of CGI animated features that Pixar has brought forth during this great time for animated movies versus the awful period for music. "Toy Story" paved the way for these movies but I never thought it would happen but "Monster's Inc" does the unthinkable, it actually surpasses "Toy Story" not only in the excellent animation but also of groundbreaking graphics (Sully's Fur) and of a really, REALLY original story idea. I guess it's safe to say that this movie made me conquer my fear of going into the closets at night and if there are monsters, I'm no longer afraid of them. Just for a little humor. I haven't laughed so hard the way I did with seeing "Monster's Inc" and it's hard not to see why. That's why I love Pixar's movies. They aim for all ages from young children to elderly audiences and "Monsters Inc" is the best of them all alongside "Finding Nemo". The whole story plot idea is unbelievably original and unsurpassed by many movies since this one. <p>It all begins with a typical night with a monster who aims to scare a sleeping child by creeping out of the closet. The whole thing goes awry and turns out to be a simulation and we discover the reasons why monsters actually come out of closets and scare the children of the human world. The Monsters scare the children because they need to collect the children's screams to a utility power plant where the screams generate electricity for their city of Monstropolis. However the city of Monstropolis is facing a looming power shortage because the children of the human world are becoming harder and harder to scare and thus brownouts are becoming more and more commonplace, threatening the very well being of the monster world. The problems don't stop there. While the top scarer of the monster crew James P. Sullivan (John Goodman) continues his winning streak as the number one scarer, a nemesis co-worker named Randall Boggs (Steve Buscemi) is also causing some headaches. The CEO of the company Henry J. Waternoose is also ready to use any means to keep his company from collapsing from the power crisis gripping Monstropolis. <p>The main storyline though is of a much more chaotic incident. According to Waternoose's warnings, the humans possibly carry germs that may be deadly for monsters to become infected with and the crews take drastic measures to avoid getting touched by the humans that they try to scare. One night, as Sullivan is going to turn in his assistant Mike Wazowski's paperwork and finds a door that is activated. He opens it and unaware of it, a toddler escapes through the door and right into the monster factory. Unable to get her back into her right bedroom, Sullivan attempts to disguise her but fails and as utter pandemonium follows, and vast numbers of C.D.A. (Child Detection Agency) decontamination units scouring the city for the missing child, Sullivan along with his longtime friend Mike Wazowski are on a long quest to get Boo home without being caught by the C.D.A. Sully and Mike however are unaware that they have several enemies that are working within their own ranks which make their mission to return Boo home more complicated and more dangerous. <p> The computer generated animation effects are absolutely breathtaking in just aobut every way you look at it. The animation effects of Sullivan's turquoise blue fur is so well done that it looks almost like actual live footage of a costume. Even the movements look incredibly lifelike and the details in the movie are just incredible! This movie is just about perfect in so many ways. If there is any quibble I have aobut this movie, it's that it's only 90 minutes long. Perhaps I'm spoiled at the movie lengths after seeing the Lord of The Rings movies but I think "Monsters Inc" should've been at least two hours long for more fun but that's just my opinion.<p> The actors selected for the voices perfectly match the personalities of the characters they provided the voice work for. The late James Coburn perfectly fitted the elderly role of the longtime elder Henry J. Waternoose, CEO of the Monsters Incorporated Company which his family has owned for three generations and it's really sad that Coburn moved on so soon after such a great movie. My favorite of all is of John Goodman who provides the stadium sized voice of the great James P. Sullivan, the top scarer of the Monsters Inc. workforce. He sounds so incredibly funny when he screams especially during when he discovers Boo has escaped into the factory. Billy Crystal is incredibly awesome playing Sullivan's constantly agitated assistant and lifelong friend Mike Wazowski and his voice is perfectly especially when Wazowski is uptight about things. Steve Buscemi as Randall Boggs, Jennifer Tilly as Celia, they're all great. <p> While younger viewers will certainly have a great time with the charm factor of this movie, older audiences will likely get a truly good message of about how even fearsome-looking creatures or human beings can in reality turn out being very gentle and caring beings who wouldn't even hurt a fly. And while I don't believe that monsters necessarily exist in most places, this movie also explains the reasons why monsters do this, scaring the daylights out of the sleeping children, they need their screams to power their cities but the monsters are just as scared of the children as the children are of them. <p> Enough said, go and buy this DVD as soon as you can. This is one of the greatest animated movies that has ever been made and the crew behind it's conception deserve the utmost praise for it's creation.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IANEBSMVGHS9.html">A1IANEBSMVGHS9</a><br/><p>DISC ONE: For moviegoers during summer of 2001, the marquee was packed with animated options: Shrek, Atlantis, Final Fantasy and Monsters, Inc. If you disect the movies, the first two end up being dissapointing when viewed in the small screen and Final Fantasy is just made with a different public in mind. Now, Monsters, Inc. achieves in DVD format the same feel you got when you (hopefully) saw it in theaters: the movie IS a great movie for all ages. No bells and whistles: simply brilliant!<p>The script is very funny, clever and innovative (it is worth seeing on the DVD how much it evolved from the original treatment it was going to have...), turning around the ageless childhood fear of monsters into a fear of kids BY monsters, who need kids' screams in order to power their society. Top ranking scarer, big, blue and furry Sulley (voiced by John Goodman) and his one-eyed assitant, Mike Wazowski (brilliantly played by Billy Crystal) see their &quot;monstrous&quot; lives turned around when Sulley accidentally brings a little girl (Boo) by accident into their monster world.<p>Complementing the script and the voices, the animation is incredible. The faces of the characters, the blinking of the eyes (the red in the eyes, when Mike sprays antibacterial stuff on his face, the glassy look in Sulley's eyes toward the end of the movie), the fur of Sulley (every hair moving just as if he were real), the illumination all through the movie. Plus the persecution scene leaves you speechless: there's SO MUCH happening in it, and it's so seamless: one of the great animation accomplishments of the movie without any doubt.<p>DISC TWO: One element that powerfully called my attention is the very human (is that ironic or what?) touch that the second disc has. For example, the Director, the two Co-Directors and the Producer appear in the very beginning, showing you how to find your way around the DVD. It's not that it's a convoluted DVD or anything of that sort: simply the two discs are packed with all sorts of goodies and they are making an effort to have you find it all.<p>One of the best things included in disc 2 is the Oscar-winning animated short film &quot;For The Birds&quot; which we all enjoyed in theaters so much right before Monsters started. Also included are the complete outtakes (call them &quot;bloopers&quot; from the movie, if you may, whose concept alone makes you scratch your head in surprise while you laugh till it hurts). But the fun to disc two doesn't end there: there is a wealth of details for the more technically-inclined or those who simply are curious about the way animation is done, with a whole tour through the process, from story reels, to layout, animation, simulation (a key component in the level of perfection accomplished with Sulley's fur and the way Boo's big shirt works) ahd shading/lighting. Same thing is done with design and music &amp; sound. Wrapping up the goodies is a pretty fun tour of Pixar studios where you can catch a glimpse of why these guys are able to come up with such a funny movie: they're having a blast there! :D<p>Technical comments<br />-If you view the DVD on a computer (as I did), the first time you do it, you will go through the installation of the InterActual player software. Hit &quot;Accept&quot; at every step of the way: whether you like it or not, you won't be able to take advantage of all the elements in the DVDs unless you view it using this software...<br />-Another detail for computer users: the &quot;Peek-A-Boo Door game&quot; was useless on my computer. It's designed to be played when viewing the DVD on a DVD player. In fact, it almost brings my laptop to its knees. So, my recommendation to you DVD-viewers using a computer to go past the intro page with all the games on it and click on to view the movie.<br />-Subtitles included are in English only, so that probably will not make Spanish-only or French-only-speaking viewers too happy, n'est-ce pas? Verdad?<p>In general, though, excellent! Five stars to this incredible production by Disney and to its Two-Disc Collector's Edition. You will enjoy every bit of it and watch it several times over.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TLLX0ZBMZTK7.html">A2TLLX0ZBMZTK7</a><br/><p>Saw this when I was a kid, and I liked it then.

Cute, I mean REALLY cute, story line about how the monsters actually have a work-a-day world where scaring children is a job for superstars. When a human child makes it to the other side of the bedroom door into the monsters' world, all heck breaks out before the situation can be set aright again...the children in my movie theatre, including 3yr-old Alexander, just squealed with laughter the whole time, as did the adults present, too. And not a fart joke in sight! That's the difference between child and adolescent humor, I guess.  <p>If you want to see the TRUE best cartoon movie  of the year, look no farther than "Monsters, Inc."</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ.html">A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ</a><br/><p>Imagine if there really WAS a monster living in every child's closet... and they had an excellent reason to be scary.<br /><br />And for anyone who has heard bumps in the night (adults or kids), "Monsters Inc" is a thoroughly delightful little animated movie that shows Pixar at its best.

I mean, outside of the horrendous `Cars' (I refuse to see `Cars 2'), they have had one homerun after another.  `Monsters Inc.' was one of the first Pixar films to really grab my interest as an adult.  Considering that `Toy Story' was released when I was ten, it was an instant hit with me at the time.  `Monsters Inc.' on the other hand was released when I was sixteen.  It's a lot harder to convince a teenager that an animated film is worthy of their time since to a teenager the word `cartoon' can mean one thing; `it's for children'.<br /><br />I was not a child anymore.<br /><br />That said, it was a film that some of my `female' friends wanted to see and so we all went together.  We loved it.  But honestly, what isn't to love?<br /><br />`Monsters Inc.' is yet another imaginative offering from Pixar, the studio that continues to reinvent animation by giving us vivacious stories of superheroes, flying houses and rats that can cook.  Here we have the story of a monster community that scares children to keep their city running.  Scares capture energy that is used like electricity.  The film focuses on two particular monsters, Sully and Mike.  When they inadvertently bring a young girl (who they affectionately refer to as Boo) back to their world, everything gets tossed upside down.  In the process we get a special and tender glimpse at the world of monsters and we see them come to a more docile understanding of their own existence.<br /><br />By the end of the film you'll just want to squeeze Sully so tight!<br /><br />The voice work is remarkable (but what else would you expect from a company that immortalized Ellen DeGeneres as a fish).  John Goodman is perfectly cast as the warm and lovable Sully (that voice is so serene and calming) and Billy Crystal IS Mike Wazowski!  The animation is crisp and endearing, with bright colors and remarkably real landscapes.  It's a stunning addition to the Pixar filmography, and one that everyone would be proud to own.<br /><br />I guess cartoons aren't just for kids anymore!</p></br><a href="../users/A1FMJJKSVQDDQ.html">A1FMJJKSVQDDQ</a><br/><p>Monsters Inc. is widely recognized as one of the greatest Pixar films ever made, and it's there are several reasons why. First, the premise of everyday monsters actually trying their best to scare human kids in order to raise their economy is something that is quite amusing. Kids and adults alike love the plot because it's very inventive. Also, the characters (especially Sully, Mike, and little Boo) are really likable, while the animation is spectacular and extraordinarily detailed. The effective humor is appropriate for all ages, so there's no need to feel very politically correct about this one.<br /><br />I may not be one of the biggest Pixar fans in the world, but I know a good movie when I see one. And Monsters Inc. is a GREAT movie. I fully recommend it to kids, teenagers, adults, seniors, even pets.<br /><br />Grade: 8.7/10</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZH9LWMX5UCFJ.html">A1ZH9LWMX5UCFJ</a><br/><p>I watched this online one afternoon after work.

Clever, funny, charming. It wasn't scarey so it's good for the real little kids. Nicely done!</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>Monsters, Inc. is the largest scare factory in the monster world and the top kid Scarer is James "Sully" Sullivan, a huge intimidating monster with blue fur, large purple spots and horns. His Scare Assistant, best friend and roommate is Mike Wazowski, a lime green, opinionated, fiesty, one-eyed monster. Scaring children isn't such an easy job--monsters believe children are toxic and that direct contact with them would be catastrophic. Inside the factory can also be found the factory's crab-like CEO, the beguiling serpent-haired receptionist Celia and the sarcastic chameleon monster, Randall Boggs, who schemes to replace Sully as Monsters, Inc.'s top Scarer. Visiting from the human world is Boo, a tiny girl who turns the monster world upside-down. This movie is highly entertaining, funny and cheerful, high-energy, that kids and adults will enjoy.</p></br><a href="../users/A370Z6I5GBWU44.html">A370Z6I5GBWU44</a><br/><p>Pixar has delivered solid hits like Toy Story, and this movie certainly rivals Toy Story. It's a great movie for adults AND kids... though perhaps not all kids, as there were a few moments in the movie that would be quite scary for very young or easily sensitive ones. But at 4.5/5 stars, this movie is a great twist on the old 'monster-in-the-closet' bogeyman tale with a surprisingly heartwarming ending.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R6RA8FRBS608.html">A2R6RA8FRBS608</a><br/><p>Monsters, Inc. is a Pixar masterpiece; the animation astounds me and the plot is very engaging--you won't get bored! There's action, adventure, scenes that evoke genuine emotion and lots of good one-liners and even a few "sight gags," too. The actors doing the voiceovers were chosen with care and the flow of the movie is very good--the plot unfolds smoothly without becoming too fast or too slow. The script was well written, too. The film even explores the themes of friendship and the universal struggle between good and evil; that's very impressive.<br /><br />When the action starts, we quickly meet two employees of Monsters, Inc., a power plant in the city of Monstropolis which, by the way, is populated only by monsters who scare children. There's James Sullivan aka "Sully" (voiced by John Goodman) and his buddy Mike Wazowski (voiced by Billy Crystal). Sullivan is number one at scaring children; but his not-so-friendly coworker Randall Boggs (voiced by Steve Buscemi) is a competitor for the number one slot. Other monsters working at Monsters, Inc. include the boss of it all, Henry Waternoose (voiced by James Coburn); Celia the receptionist (voiced by Jennifer Tilly) and Roz (voiced by Bob Peterson), a cranky older monster who's a stickler for paperwork! Roz is not too happy with Mike because he never seems to file his paperwork correctly--or even on time!<br /><br />At Monsters, Inc., monsters generate power similar to electricity by entering children's bedrooms in the human world at night through closet doors to make the kids scream in horror! Unfortunately, however, Monstropolis has a problem; the monsters are just not producing enough power from the children's screams. Another interesting thing is that the kids don't know that the monsters are actually quite afraid--of them! The monsters believe that human children are extremely frightening--and the kids could easily be toxic, too!<br /><br />A big problem eventually arises when James accidentally lets a two year old child into the world of Monstropolis. The state police-like Child Detection Agents need to capture the child and send it back to its home before the child might infect, harm or even kill a monster! James and Mike go through many trials and tribulations just to keep track of the playful and often hard to catch child; and we get quite a few unexpected plot twists and turns before the movie ends!<br /><br />The two DVD version of this film offers us a plethora of extra features which are truly wonderful. On the first disc, there is the choice between viewing the film in widescreen or fullscreen, although you can only get the audio commentary and the 5.1 surround sound effects mix when you watch this in widescreen format. On the second disc, most of the extras are divided into one of two categories: "Humans Only" and "Monsters Only." With "Humans Only" you get a tour of Pixar Studios (at least as it was when this was first released); deleted scenes; a "Monstropolis Art Gallery;" another featurette entitled "Animation Gags and Guide To `In' Jokes"--and more! With "Monsters Only" you get a training video for your first day at Monsters, Inc.; "See The Monsters, Inc. Employee Handbook;" "Learn The History of The Monster World"--and still more! In a general category you also get "Mike's New Car," "Outtakes" and "For the Birds."<br /><br />Monsters, Inc. is a wonderfully animated family film that is sure to remain a favorite for many years to come. Although there are a few potentially scary scenes near the end of the film, I still highly recommend this film for family entertainment; use your judgment when thinking of showing this to very young children.</p></br><a href="../users/A22RY8N8CNDF3A.html">A22RY8N8CNDF3A</a><br/><p>Another Pixar gem!  The movie is smart and easy to watch for both kids and adults.  The monsters are perfectly animated with each hair flowing seamlessly on the blue monster "Sulley" (John Goodman). Sulley is a whimsical work of art to watch.  He has a buddy and job partner, "Mike" (Billy Crystal) who is a round green guy, with one eye and much smaller than Sully.  He talks all the time, but means well.  They both work for Monsters, Inc., a large company that specializes in children's screams they capture in a bottle.  This is bottled energy that monster land needs to keep lights on and refrigerators running.<br /><br />Monster's Inc. has an assembly line of doors from all over the world.  Once set up in a large room all the monsters enter and they emerge from a child's closet.  A frightening scream from the child is extracted and then the monsters go back through the door and another one is set up.  Kids begin to get used to the monsters and are not scaring as easily.  There is a energy shortage in Monster Land.<br /><br />Then one day, a little girl, Boo (Mary Gibbs) grabs Sully who she thinks is a big "Kitty".  He brings her into the factory by mistake.  Wow - the monsters are scared stiff of children and an exciting adventure ensues.  One discovery is that children's laughter gives more energy than their screams.<br /><br />We have to have a bad guy so Monster's Inc. plot includes a villain that looks like a purple lizard.  He can disappear and reappear and he has a evil plan for extracting screams.<br /><br />The ending is happy and you are glad you watched such an endearing tale.</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>This is a very entertaining animated film. I've seen it twice and enjoyed even more the second time. Billy Crystal said he enjoyed making this film as much as any film he's ever done, so that's a good testimony that you'll get some laughs and enjoy this movie as an adult, too.<br /><br />Kids will love it, I am sure. The "monsters" in here are funny-looking and almost lovable, nothing that would scare your kids (or you). Crystal has a bunch of funny lines but overall I found this to be as much if not more of a human interest story than a comedy.<br /><br />There is a lot of sentimentality to it, even overdone a bit at the end, but that's okay. There is absolutely nothing offensive in here, either. The colors look spectacular, too, and I'm anxious to check it out when it comes out on Blu-Ray in several months.</p></br><a href="../users/A1F1FOR46702YF.html">A1F1FOR46702YF</a><br/><p>The creators of the animated blockbuster "Toy Story" open the door to a whole new world of imagination in the very funny animated fantasy "Monsters, Inc". In the amazing world of Monstropolis, James P. Sullivan (John Goodman) and Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal) are the top-notch scare duo of Monsters, Inc. When an unsuspected human child crosses over to their world, Sullivan and Mike must keep their new guest a secret and learn that humans aren't that scary. "Monsters, Inc" is the fourth animated movie produced by Pixar Animation Studios. The 2001 animated blockbuster is an inventive and delightful family comedy with a superb voice cast and incredible animation. The story is original, funny and appealing for all audiences. The computer animation is simply groundbreaking. John Goodman and Billy Crystal deliver great comic performances. The voice cast also includes Steve Buscemi, John Ratzenberger, Jennifer Tilly and Academy Award winner James Coburn. "Monsters' Inc" won the Academy Award for Best Song.<br /><br />Disney dishes out one monstrous DVD. The animated blockbuster is presented in both THX-certified 1.85:1 widescreen and standard full screen formats. The DVD contains an exceptionally sharp picture quality with bright colors and a positively excellent Dolby Digital 5.1-EX sound. This fully-loaded 2-disc DVD includes audio commentary with directors Pete Docter and Lee Unkrich and executive producers, several deleted scenes, very funny outtakes, multiple behind-the-scenes featurettes in the production of "Monsters, Inc.", the amusing animated short "Mike's New Car" and sneak peeks of upcoming Disney movies.

(Collector's Edition)~ Jack Angel is an astounding animated movie that deals with monsters scaring little children to gain energy for their city. The script is well written and the storyline is amazing. John Goodman and Billy Cristal are doing a bang up job in the movie, and I really love the message of acceptance and tolerance. The music is also perfect for the movie and the animation is some of the best I have ever seen. The movie is filled with many classic scenes like the initial scare scene with the high scores and the scene with the kid and the little monster children. This is a movie that I highly recommend and I give it five stars!</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>Since the very first bedtime, children around the world have known that after their parents turn off the lights, monsters lay waiting behind closet doors, ready to emerge. But what they didn't know is that the monsters are as scared of us as we are of them! By watching Monsters, Inc. you get the whole story and a new light what goes on behind those closed doors. Monsters, Inc. is a superb movie, filled with all the great characters, comedy, and CGA that the movie-going audience has come to expect from the greatest duo to produce computerized movies, Walt Disney Productions and PIXAR. It gives the audience a lot to enjoy, with very little in the way of detractors.<br /><br />The movie centers around two monsters, James P. Sullivan, AKA, "Sully," and his best friend, roommate, and Scare Assistant, Mike Wazowski and their adventures with a genuine child, who has been set loose in Monstropolis and Monsters, Inc. Together, they protect the child and bring her back home safely, all the time having great adventures and misadventures. Wonderful movie for the kids as well as the adults. My kids warned this DVD out since its first release. For those techno junkies out there, the animation is one of the BEST I've ever seen. The story is very well developed and imaginative; the technical aspects of this movie are superb. You can actually see the fur moving on the monsters and the air move around them especially the fur on Sully. Again, very funny and not to scary for the little ones. Highly recommend.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EBHHCZO6V2A4.html">A3EBHHCZO6V2A4</a><br/><p>"Monsters,Inc" is one of PIXAR's cleverest creations. It's about the Cyclopean Mike (Billy Crystal) and the shaggy Sully (John Goodman) whose career is to make children scream, keeping Monsteropolis powered. They collect children's screams. However,their city is having an "energy crisis" since children aren't as easily scared. Sully has been employee of the month--but the jealous salamander Randall (Steve Buscemi) will do anything to get ahead. Then,a little girl named Boo scares Monsterpolis... On the way, Sully develops paternal feelings for Boo,and it's learned that the monsters fear children.<br /><br />"Monsters,Inc" has plenty of in-jokes--from the Harryhausen's sushi bar to an opening like "The Right Stuff." It's a clever,poignant movie. Mike is delightfully neurotic,thinking up that he'll release the little girl to the outside world "using mostly spoons." Sully goes from scaring children to making them laugh. There's a brief,hilarious segment with the Abominable Snowman in the Himalayas with his sno-cones.<br /><br />"Monsters,Inc" was better than I expected. I thought it would be sappy,childish fare. Instead,it'll have you laughing and thinking! It's fit for the whole family.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UCNXHX2PB3KQ.html">A3UCNXHX2PB3KQ</a><br/><p>This is such a great film, I was having fun right along with my kids. John Goodman and Billy Crystal are wonderful and hysterical in the parts of Mike and Sully. Its a fun movie, seemingly set in another world. Monster City is, of course full of scary looking monsters. The entire city is powered by children screaming! But, ironically, the monsters are even more afraid of the children then they are of them. And when one of those children, the delightful Boo, breaks lose into their world, problems of course ensure. The ending is sweet, and the whole movie is very enjoyable and loaded with great scenes.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DGB4HN3QCGAL.html">A3DGB4HN3QCGAL</a><br/><p>There's a little something for everyone in this movie. It's kind of cartoonish for the little kids (might be just a little scary for some of them), lots of not really violent action, a plot that while silly (monsters scaring kids to capture their screams for use as an energy source) is pretty well done, good characterizations (especially John Goodman as Sulley and Billy Crystal as Mike Wasowski)and some really interesting computer animation.<br />These things alone would make it interesting to watch but if I buy it it'll be for the extras.</p></br><a href="../users/A152C8GYY25HAH.html">A152C8GYY25HAH</a><br/><p>"Monsters Inc" is first-rate family entertainment. This Pixar Studios production is visually stunning and shows off digital computer technology at its finest. Its monsters wouldn't scare the average four-year old, which is what the moviemakers intended. This is sheer fantasy, and delightful fantasy at that. Adults should know that the movie lacks the sophistication of "Shrek", "Antz" or other Pixar works like "Toy Story" and "Toy Story 2". <p>In this highly imaginative tale, those monsters who come out of kids' closets at night are actually residents of Monstropolis, where energy is provided by the screams the creatures elicit from unsuspecting children. Times are tough, though, because kids today aren't so easily frightened. The monsters must never actually touch any child because they believe that human beings are deadly poisonous. So, the beasts are actually more frightened of kids than kids are of them. [Who knew?] Much comedy and pandemonium results when a little child called Boo follows one of the monsters, Sully, into Monstropolis. <p>For kids, this is one of the best animated features ever made. For adults, it is painless to sit through and, for the most part, quite entertaining.</p></br><a href="../users/A3IMNZSYDOTTU6.html">A3IMNZSYDOTTU6</a><br/><p>MONSTERS INC. is a thoroughly enjoyable and highly delightful movie about the world of monsters.

Blu-ray version rocks!</p></br><a href="../users/A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL.html">A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL</a><br/><p>Some of the best stories for children have presented their worst fears only to have the menace brought down to size.  "Jack and the Beanstalk" works that way perfectly.  'Monsters, Inc.' helps to tuck the kiddies in and give them the giggles, too.  Taking near day-glow colors, the Monsters in this fluid Pixar picture are hideously cute.  They live in a "green" world where the renewable resource of children's fright powers the Monster community.  Looking like the sorts in (Lucas Films, Ltd. is credited here) a 'Star Wars' bar scene, the film's focus is on the power company where the employees go through magic doors, their portals to children's bedrooms where the fright factor generates their power plant.<br /><br />Heading the troops is big blue "Sully" (John Goodman) a good natured monster, proud of his ability to be the equivalent of "Employee of the Month".  Keeping track of his generating power, he is out to set a plant record.  His green, one-eyed sidekick, Mike Wazowski, (Billy Crystal) has a Martian appearance, but his voice couldn't scare a mouse.  He is smitten by one-eyed purple princess, Shroopsy with hydra hair (snake braids).  They all face their competition with rascally Randall, (perfectly villainous, Steve Buscemi) the salamander-like monster with invisible capabilities.  Pivotal to the plot is Mr. Waternoose, (James Coburn) a tycoon who resembles a tarantula in a three-piece suit.  In the causality is 'Silkwood'-like contamination if any child or remnant remains in the Monster world.  (In other words:  Just like parents often say about insects or some animals:  "They're more afraid of [children], than [they] are of them.")  Sully and James come across "Boo" whom they find in their best interests to return to the dark realm of her own bedroom.<br /><br />Formidable to the fore, 'Monsters,..." takes a premise that could have been a dumb non-starter, and provides supporting plot structures with enough heft to turn the adventure on.  With Pixar animation, the movement is flowing enough to take the technological edge off the look, and Andrew Stanton and Daniel Gerson's screenplay keep the dialogue fresh and funny.  Director Pete Docter gives the movie proper assembly.  'Monsters, Inc.' is therapeutically good for children's dreamscapes as well as their funny bones.  (Highly recommended to rent and to own.)</p></br><a href="../users/A31U2QT7SAL7K.html">A31U2QT7SAL7K</a><br/><p>I've had the movie for over two years and just got around to viewing it.  Well, it was well worth the wait.  An engaging and hilarious story that appeals to the child in all of us, this is a film for anyone that ever wondered about what lay under the bed or hid in the deep recesses of one's closet.  Creative minds and talented actors come together to make a film comparable to the studio's other offerings such as "Toy Story" and "A Bug's Life".  In fact, "Monsters, Inc.", in my opinion is BETTER than the record-setting "Finding Nemo".<br /><br />Unfortunately, the bonus features don't compliment the film.  Included is a "new" unfunny short that, thankfully, is just that: SHORT. Interviews with the animators and other production staff show that they are gifted beyond measure but they are a tad BORING and stereotypically GEEKY!</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>I was sitting there watching &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; on DVD, the first time I had seen the film, and kept thinking it was a very good but not a great animated film.  Then we got to the ending and suddenly I find myself crying.  I get weepy over lots of movies, but rarely animated films (&quot;Bambi&quot; and &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; begin the exceptions that prove the rule).  I think this especially surprised me because I did not think that &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; was going to be that kind of a film.<p>The story is about Monsters, Inc., a corporation in the Monster world that sends scarers into the bedroom of human children all around the world to capture their screams, which are used to provide energy.  James P. &quot;Sully&quot; Sullivan is the best of the best, and Mike is his assistant.  They are going for the all time record when something really, really bad happens: Sully accidentally brings back a little girl from the human world.  At this point, wackiness ensues.<p>The promotion for this film really made it seem like it the main character was Mike Wazowski, the frenetic one-eyed green dude voiced by Billy Crystal.  But this film is really about James P. Sullivan, the hairy blue giant with John Goodman's voice.  I was sort of disappointed that Crystal was not really stealing each and every scene, sort of like Eddie Murphy did in &quot;Shrek.&quot;  But this film is clearly Goodman's show (how did they ever avoid giving this man an Emmy for his flawless work on &quot;Roseanne&quot;?), and he shows you what he can do with just his voice.  <p>Any doubts I had about the rating to give this DVD were quickly settled by the second disk.  You can read the list above of all the goodies you will find there, but the chief joys are (1) the hilarious &quot;outtakes&quot; Pixar always managed to come up with for their films; (2) the Original Treatment, which tells the earliest storyline about Johnson, the monster who dreams of being a star scarer; (3) an all-new animated short film, &quot;Mike's New Car; (4) &quot;For the Birds,&quot; the 2001 Oscar winner for Best Animated Short Film; and (5) a behind the scenes look at Crystal and Goodman recording &quot;If I Didn't Have You.&quot;  I think you will find that with numbers (1), (3) and (4) you might laugh more than you do while watching the actual movie, especially on (3) and (4).  My stomach hurt I was laughing so hard. <p>So, that's the &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; DVD in a nutshell.  You cry, you laugh.  What more do you need to know?</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>I love animated films and Monster Inc. is no exception. It's got great animation, characters and a well thought out story, but it might be a little too intense for the youngest viewers. Classic monster buffs will catch lots of winks and nods to the days of yesteryear in this irresistible and funny film. It might do your young children good to see this with an adult to help them get over 'the monsters in the closet' syndrome most kids have at a young age. The two disc set has a beautiful DVD transfer and lots of extras.</p></br><a href="../users/A7Y6AVS576M03.html">A7Y6AVS576M03</a><br/><p>One of Disney and PIXAR's best. It gives real depth to all the characters. Above and beyond. They all seem so real. I laughed and I cried. You will really fall in love with this movie. I have seen it four times now. I can't wait to see it again. The kids in school just loved it. The images and voices really made it work.</p></br><a href="../users/AAI57M3OXP5NK.html">AAI57M3OXP5NK</a><br/><p>I loved this movie.  I think it was the cutest and soolest movie.  This movie has great special effects and has a great story.  Some of the parts of this movie will make you laugh so hard and other parts will make you cry.  Released November 2001 this movie was a suprise hit and you can see why.  Much better than Shrek, this is a much better kids movie.  I can't wait for the DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/A2KB14WCZ1DVE3.html">A2KB14WCZ1DVE3</a><br/><p>Yes, the special effects are great.  Pixar takes basically the same technology as "Toy Story II", probably added some improvements, and brings us another visual delight.  This one should be a big success on video, as kids are going to love it in their libraries.<p>But of course, it wouldn't mean beans if there were not a good story.  This one creates a brand new world for us.  I wasn't aware of this but it seems that the monsters that hide in our closets have a back exit that leads into their own world.  In this world, scaring kids is just another day at work, and they punch a clock in the same manner that we do.  They are not bad monsters for scaring us, it's just what they do.  <p>So everything is going fine until an actual kid get's into the monsters' world and gums everything up.  Turns out the monsters, at least our leading monsters, are really good guys who just scare kids as a job.  When they encounter the child, who THEIR world considers the monsters, a lot of prejudice has to be overcome.  But once they accept they child, protective instincts take over, and they try to put everything back in it's place.  This, of course, entails all kinds of difficulties, which entertain us enough to make this one a keeper.</p></br><a href="../users/A3OI841P5R6FCH.html">A3OI841P5R6FCH</a><br/><p>While I'm not the biggest fan of Disney flicks, I decided to take advantage of the opportunity to check out an advance copy of Monsters Inc's deluxe 2-DVD set. Aside from the amazing CGI work that has made Pixar a pre-eminent production company in the field, I found M-Eye to be a decent presentation that makes little effort to break the hackneyed Disney character format of the strong-yet-gentle hero, his cynical motormouth of a sidekick who always has plenty of snide remarks to lay out, and the slimy, underhanded villain. Interestingly enough, I found the guys who voiced these roles-- John Goodman, Billy Crystal, and Steve Buscemi, respectively-- to fit their characters perfectly. And the usual silly moments that you'd expect from a Disney toon-film also pop up from time to time. Otherwise, it's a fairly charming and safe movie for the young'uns-- well, except perhaps for the Abominable Snowman's lemon snow cones and the deep belch gag-- and a not-half-bad diversion for the young at heart.<p>The secondary commentary track, covered by four of the picture's producers and/or directors, discusses the talents of the voice actors and some of the original concepts for the film to a small degree. But for the most part their coverage is on the technical aspects of the flick, such as the difficulties of trying to imitate certain surfaces, textures, and shading in CGI (like Sully's "fur", for example). I was especially amused by their discussion of how incredibly cavernous the door-storage facility "set" was, which allegedly could fit the Statue of Liberty on each "floor", were it a real set. The THX-mastered picture and sound were top-notch in the way of sharpness and clarity.<p>Much like its other deluxe 2-Disc Disney cinematic brethren (Snow White, Tron, et. al.), The House of The Mouse and Pixar threw in everything but the kitchen sink onto the second platter. There's an entire behind-the-scenes tour of Pixar Studios that outlines the production of Monsters Inc from the voice acting to storyboarding and many other phases of production. There's also an M-Eye 'blooper reel', company play program, deleted scenes, a couple of bonus Pixar shorts (both with commentary tracks), storyboard & concept art galleries, the Monsters, Inc training guide, games for the kids, and lotsa other tchotchkes that'll likely take many hours for you to go through. If you don't find one part of interest, simply check something else out!<p>Then there's the 'practical' special features. The English subtitles match up very well with the spoken dialogue, and even describe some of the sounds being made in each scene. You can also select between widescreen and standard pan-and-scan presentations! You know, just in case your TV screen isn't big enough for you to fully appreciate the widescreen format, or something of the like...<p>'Late</p></br><a href="../users/A2WZ1B92F81LJJ.html">A2WZ1B92F81LJJ</a><br/><p>If you have small children, movies such as this are worth their weight in gold: the kids love it (our two year old can barely start the day without at least seeing scare trainee Mr. Vile whose friends call him &quot;Phlegm&quot; and his ill-fated run through the bedroom simulation), and since the kids love it, you'd better get used to the idea of YOU watching it OVER AND OVER AGAIN.<br />And here Monsters, Inc. (along with the Toy Story movies and the outstanding Shrek) really shows its mettle: even for my (somewhat addled) parental brain, this film stands up to repeated scrutiny: I think I could probably recite the entire script verbatim and I still get a kick out of it. <p>Partly it's the characterisation - Goodman and Crystal are as good as you'd expect, but the secondary characters are their equal - the adolescent door shredders and, of course, Mr. Vile are amongst my favourites. Every aspect of the film rates highly: the script pops and fizzes (probably thanks to Crystal's ad-libbing), the computer rendering is brilliant (though I still say Shrek is the undisputed CGI heavyweight championship of the world), and the grand scheme of the film - its look and feel, is just remarkable. <p>Viewers who complain that the darker aspects of the story weren't adequately explored seem to have missed the fact that, first and foremost, this is a story for very small children. And besides, there's no way I'm marking down a film that guarantees me a half-hour lie-in on a Sunday morning just because it isn't nasty enough.<p>Two nitpicks (neither of which rob the film of the five stars it deserves): Firstly, the standard version I bought isn't the full widescreen version (this wasn't made clear on the tin, and even if it was, it is a curious and rather cynical decision on Disney's part), and secondly, to get the movie to play you have to scroll through a bunch of other Disney trailers - there seems to be no way to avoid these (other than impatiently cueing through them). This is standard Disney practice - although what they think it will achieve is beyond me, no matter what they do I'M NOT BUYING TARZAN - and it is irritating as hell.<p>But as soon as the family sees Mr. Vile hopping round the room frantically removing jacks from his arse, all is forgiven.</p></br><a href="../users/A38ZTUNQJVGP6S.html">A38ZTUNQJVGP6S</a><br/><p>Monsters, Inc. is one hour and thirty-four minutes and was released in theaters on November 2, 2001. The movie focuses around two main characters: James P. "Sulley" Sullivan and Michael "Mike" Wazowski. Sulley and Mike are best friends who live together and work at the Monsters, Inc; a scare plant. Sulley is the top Scarer at the plant and Mike is his assistant scarer. At the end of a shift one day Mike forgot to file his paperwork because his mind is on Celia Mae, his girlfriend, who he is taken her to Harryhausen for her birthday. Sulley steps in for Mike and does his paperwork for him. Sulley is picking up the paperwork and notices that one of the doors has not been put away. He peeks in the room to see if there are any monsters in it and finds out there is none. When he is back on the Scare Floor he sees a little two year old girl playing with his tail and all fun breaks loose. The rest of the story is about Sulley and Mike trying to get Boo (the name giving to the three year old girl by Sulley) back to her world. Along the way the two find out the Randall is kidnapping children for his scare machine and the one who is to blame for the door being found by Sulley. Mike and Sulley are at one point banished to the Himalayas where they meet the Abominable Snowman who was also banished there for reasons unknown. Back at Monsters, Inc. the two send Randall through one of the doors and destroy the door so he cannot return, get Mr. Waternoose to reveal the plans of the scare machine to the Child Detection Agency, and finally send Boo home. The computer animation of Monsters, Inc. is great, the story does not drag, and it keeps everybody laughing. The only thing I really hate is the two disc set. In my opinion everything could have gone on one disc and much of what is on Disc 2 could have been left off. Monsters, Inc. gets an AAAA++++.<br /><br />DVD FEATURES<br /><br />Disc 1<br />Scene Selection<br />Bonus Features<br />1.

They use the screams of human children to power their city. But the numbers are off and Monsters, Inc. is really pushing the people who work on the scare floor to create more energy. James P. "Sulley" Sullivan (John Goodman) is the current leader. A large, fuzzy bear-type creature with horns, Sulley works with Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal), a round green guy with one eye. As a team, they are the current leaders. Randall (Stave Buscemi) is consumed with jealous rage and wants to be the top earner. Everyone in Monstropolis has been taught that the human children they scare are also toxic to the monsters. This leads more than a few monsters to become afraid of them and quickly call of the visit. One night, after everyone has gone home, Sulley revisits the scare floor and finds that a door to a child's room has been left behind. He pokes his head in and sees nothing. When he returns to the scare floor, he finds that the little girl who lives in the room has grabbed onto his fur. He nicknames her Boo and has to figure out a way to get her back home without causing the city to becomes panicked.<br /><br />"Monsters, Inc.", the newest film from Pixar, is a brilliant addition to their library. Directed by newcomer, Peter Docter, a John Lassiter prot&eacute;g&eacute;, the film starts with a brilliant concept, adds a delightful screenplay and tops it off with some of the best computer animation yet.<br /><br />Much like the previous Pixar films, the attention to detail in "Monsters, Inc." is simply staggering. Monstropolis is basically any large American city, down to the power crisis and potential rolling blackouts. The only difference is that it is populated by monsters of all shapes and sizes. The buildings are given brick detail, the cars are given grills, the interior of Monsters, Inc. has a large lobby. It makes it seem very real. The attention given to the characters is actually even more impressive. Sulley's fur coat seems to be very real and life-like. Every strand of fur seems to move individually. In a couple of scenes, his coat is buffeted by wind and seems to ripple like waves. His facial expressions are also very good and exhibit a whole range of emotions. Mike, the little round assistant, is given more of a goofball comic look, fitting the voice that Billy Crystal uses. His eye and mouth movements are very expressive and help to create an impressive character. Every monster has a different look; Celia (Jennifer Tilly), the girl Mike has a crush on, looks like a sort of Medusa slug, Mr. Waternoose (James Coburn), the head of Monsters, Inc. looks like a crab. This level of inventiveness never fails to amaze the viewer.<br /><br />The story is very involving, providing amusement for the adults while the kiddies are amused by the animation. The story opens with a little boy going to bed, as his parents close the bedroom door. Immediately, his eyes widen as he imagines the closet door open a crack and a shadow flowing from it. It turns out to be pajama sleepers, hanging on the inside. Then, a monster appears, ready to frighten the child, only to get frightened by the child instead. But all of this is actually happening in a simulator in Monsters, Inc., to train the monsters about frightening the children. The method used for getting into the children's bedrooms is very inventive. The story involving Boo, the human child is also very amusing. A chase through various children's doors is also an amusing highlight. Just these few elements represent more thought and inventiveness than that which is invested in most other Hollywood films.<br /><br />There are also a lot of jokes aimed at keeping adults occupied. First of all, the entire film is basically a tribute to baby boomers. Everything in Monstropolis is growing old and weathered. It is the children of today, harder to scare because they are desensitized, that are the problem. The children of the baby boomers are the problem, inferring that the baby boomer period was just fine for Monstropolis.<br /><br />Ultimately, "Monsters, Inc." has a message or moral and it is presented in such a way that all viewers can get the message and retain it. The message isn't rammed down our throats and forced upon us.<br /><br />"Monsters, Inc." is an enjoyable film for everyone in the family. The characters, animation and story will surely win over everyone who watches it. 4 ? stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A175GIISFGGO31.html">A175GIISFGGO31</a><br/><p>I think I can finally get into computerized cartoons now hehe.

Ask any normal movie-goer before 1995 who Pixar was, they would have given you a direct blank stare. In fact, unless you were well familiar with animated shorts, you would be hard pressed to find an average Joe who really knew that such an animation facility was in operation. After 1995 and the prodigious success of their first full-length animated venture, Toy Story, Pixar Animation Studios grew with tremendous strength partnering with Walt Disney Pictures in distributing their future animated films. That deal is now in serious question on whether it will be renewed or will result in the parting of the two studios. On Disney's side, the executives may be leaning more and more toward giving in to Pixar's demands considering the animation studio's features have brought in a combined $600 million domestically alone and recouping their budgets with each release. This is opposite to several of Disney's animated feature films such as Fantasia 2000, Dinosaur, and Atlantis: The Lost Empire that have failed to meet expectations. What happens with the two studios after this may hinder on the success or failure of Monsters Inc.<p>The story center around the misadventures of two monsters that create havoc in the secret monster city. James P. Sullivan works for Monsters Inc., a company that provides energy for Monstropolis. How do they obtain this energy you ask? By going into the bedrooms of children, scaring the young ones and gathering their screams which power everything from cars to lights. Sulley is the best of the best, thanks in part to his buddy Mike Wazowski who helps him on the scare floor. What's more is that everyone seems to just love the big guy, everyone except Randall Boggs, who continuously attempts to pull ahead of Sulley in the scare numbers only to fail. Everything in Sulley's life seems to be going perfectly, that is until he accidentally lets a small little girl into the monster world. From there, all hell breaks loose. Disney and Pixar once again create a picture perfect story that is filled with humor and heart. If you don't usually cry while watching a movie, you'll be hard pressed to see a dry eye including your own while watching this charming tale.<p>One of the most engaging aspects of Monsters Inc. has to be the vibrant voices behind the delightful, and at times scary, characters. The teaming of Billy Crystal and John Goodman has to be one of the biggest, if not the best, highlights of the film with each actor playing off each other gracefully and showcasing perfect chemistry together within the course of the feature. Steve Buscemi gives an utterly chilling voice-over performance for the slippery and cunning Randall Boggs. The familiar voice, at least for many adults going to see Monsters, brings about much needed sinister-like quality to outweigh the humor and the heart-tugging emotions that might have over-flooded the feature had the character not been added.<p>Overall, Monsters Inc. serves as a perfect example of the blending of intensity, humor, and heart so perfectly, it could only have come from the talented artists and writers at Disney and Pixar. They manage once again to out-due their previous successes including the original Toy Story and its sequel in both quality and storytelling unlike most films which, from film to film, tend to take a step backward. As effective as the feature was, there were moments where the filmmakers try too hard pulling off tear-jerker moments and eventually the emotions become a bit much. The ending to the film was a bit of a disappointment especially after it brings the audience to such an emotional peak as the film draws closer to its finale. What makes the ending more disappointing is that it seems to hint at a possible sequel that could never happen under the current Disney and Pixar agreement. But those squabbles are nothing compared to the overall effectively entertaining humor and visuals from one of the best family features in quite awhile.</p></br><a href="../users/AIMR915K4YCN.html">AIMR915K4YCN</a><br/><p>MONSTERS INC is yet another masterpiece from PIXAR / Disney.

While one expects greater technical sophistication with each film (and said expectations are always rewarded), this film also marks the first time where shades of gray creep into the story, and new heights in creativity in the setting, characters and storyline are added to the mix.<p>The three Pixar films prior to this are mostly kids' stuff, with the fun for adults being the gee whiz technical aspects (and seeing long-ago toys come to life), &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; slyly plays with adult conventions, making it a delight for audiences of all ages.<p>For younger viewers, the film may run a little long, but it's still time well-spent. The added features on the DVD are excellent as well, but are arranged in a more kid-friendly format than adult viewers might prefer, although not to the ridiculous extent present on the first Harry Potter DVD.<p>Recommended for film fans of all ages, including adults who worry that Pixar is already starting to rest on their considerable laurels.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ6SV7LDSMGBE.html">AQ6SV7LDSMGBE</a><br/><p>A truly fun and original story and the extras kept me busy for an hour or so.

The animation shows true progression, with one being able to see each strand of fur separately, if you can look that closely. The story line and set pieces are masterpieces of imagination. Whoever thought this whole thing up should have gotten a very large raise. The story arcs nicely, with the viewer getting attached to Boo, the little human girl, as Sulley does. It does tend to drag just a bit in the middle, but the final third is fantastic. The final scene is pure magic.

It earned two Oscar nominations, winning one for Best Original Song (Randy Newman).  Its hilarious and sensative plot is great for a variety of audiences to enjoy.  Its uniqueness takes this film to a whole new level.  This film desplicts a company in Monsteropolis that specializes in scaring kids by entering their closets.  However, the kids live in another &quot;world&quot; that can only be entered through a door.  If a kid enters Monsteropolis, disaster could occur.  A kid enters.  <p>The chain of events form a roller coaster ride that keeps audiences on the edge of their seats.  The variety of themes gives the film the passion and the humor in the perfect scenes.  All are wonderfully expressed uniquely by the actors.  Some monsters become scarier, some become more sensative, some become more greedy, and some become more funny thanks to them.  Such film quality blends perfectly with the animation.  The characters' physical features match with their personalities and the film theme.  The uniqueness offers many unforgettable images.<p>&quot;Monster's Inc.&quot; is a great film that will surely keep audiences entertained.  The quality value proves that this will become a classic in the following years.  Those wanting more should watch the special features, including the process in the making, two short features, a tour of Pixar, and others.</p></br><a href="../users/A3U56M0Y8LYO6J.html">A3U56M0Y8LYO6J</a><br/><p>Peter Docter, David Silverman, and Lee Unkrich's "Monster's, Inc." holds the distinction of being the least noteworthy film put out by Pixar. That's too bad because the film does an admirable job of creating two very distinct and entertaining lead characters. Unfortunately, they were not given a quality story to occupy.<br /><br /> The city of Monstropolis is powered by the screams of children. Because the supply of screams is dwindling, a major energy crisis is inevitable. James P. "Sulley" Sullivan (voiced by John Goodman), the leading scream producer in the city, is assigned the task of remedying the problem. Seemingly up to no good is co-worker Randall Boggs (voiced by Steve Buscemi), an opportunistic rival who has his sights set on becoming the scream collecting champion. Boggs, however, becomes the least of Sulley's problems when a human child named Boo (voiced by Mary Gibbs) accidentally crosses over to Monstropolis. With the help of his pal, Mike Wazowski (voiced by Billy Crystal), Sulley must hide Boo from the other monsters and figure out a way to return her back to her world.<br /><br /> The problem with "Monster's, Inc." is that it starts out brilliantly and then rapidly dissolves into the routine. At the outset, the premise of the story is firmly established and some clever visual gags are thrown in to further amuse. The opening sequence is an energetic tip-of-the-hat to the Kobayashi Maru training sequence in "Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan" (1982). This reference is then followed by a re-do of the slow-mo walk from the "The Right Stuff" (1983) and a tribute to special effects innovator Ray Harryhausen, which includes an Octopus homage to "It Came from Beneath the Sea" (1955). However, the level of sophistication in "Monster's, Inc." then takes a nosedive - the wink to Chuck Jones' "Feed the Kitty" (1952) notwithstanding - and the rest of the film stoops to the level of generic Saturday-morning entertainment. Sadly it appears that the creators felt that they could just coast on the appeal of the Sulley and Mike characters for the entire second half. The voicework is of top quality with Goodman, Crystal, Buscemi, Gibbs, James Coburn, Jennifer Tilly, and Bonnie Hunt turning in great efforts. Yet, while "Monster's, Inc." is a technical marvel and a tribute to some talented animators, it ultimately disappoints because of its failure to maintain the momentum of its great beginning.</p></br><a href="../users/A461VTLW9G9YB.html">A461VTLW9G9YB</a><br/><p>This movie should have been good but it didn't appeal to me at all. It didn't even seem funny. I felt like I wasted money because I believed the hype.</p></br><a href="../users/A35YWA2V4QHOJ3.html">A35YWA2V4QHOJ3</a><br/><p>Every so often, a film comes along that is simply too cute for its own good.  Such is the case of MONSTERS, INC.  The dramatic premise of the movie centers around the following dilemma:  what to do when your ace scary monster finds a kid too adorable to play Mr. bad guy?  Oh, my, Nietzsche would have been thrilled with this one...<p>The animation in this flick is spectacular.  Some of the sequences are sort of a cross between THE GRINCH WHO STOLE CHRISTMAS and DR. WHO.  Featuring the vocal talents of John Goodman, Billy Crystal and Steve Buscemi, this is a rip-roaring hilarious good time for the whole family.  Kids will love it.  Adults are sure to love it more!</p></br><a href="../users/A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK.html">A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK</a><br/><p>What if there actually were monsters in the closet, but their goal was to capture your screams to power their world?  While the plot sounds silly, the execution is hilarious.<br /><br />James P. "Sulley" Sullivan, voiced by John Goodman, and Mike Wazowski, voiced by Billy Crystal, are the leaders in obtaining the highest quantities of screams at the factory.  Life seems to be going well for the buddies.  Mike is in love with Celia, voiced by the sultry Jennifer Tilly.  Sulley is the favorite of boss Henry J. Waternoose III, voiced by classy veteran actor James Coburn in one of his last roles.  Life could hardly be better until co-worker Randall Boggs, voiced by Steve Buscemi, leaves a door in the factory and Sulley steps through it to find Boo, as he names the ultimately charming little girl that follows him through the door.<br /><br />What follows is one of the funniest movies of 2001, animated or otherwise.  Pixar Animation did an outstanding job of animated the monsters throughout this film, and the chase scene through the door factory has to be seen to be believed.<br /><br />Winner of 11 major awards, including an Oscar, and nominated for 29 other awards, this movie has a visual power that will captivate young and old audiences alike.  The two-disc collector's edition includes hours and hours of extras.  As with most two-disc editions, some of the extras were great, some were good, and many I skipped through because I was uninterested.<br /><br />"Monsters, Inc." is a rare family film that is suitable for all but the youngest members of the family.  The animation is superb, the acting is great, and the storyline is creative.  Movies such as these have made Pixar the current leader in animated films.  Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/AHCVWPLA1O4X8.html">AHCVWPLA1O4X8</a><br/><p>Unlike their contemporaries at Dreamworks, the folks at Pixar continue to turnout high quality entertainment with excellent special effects and computer animation time after time.  This movie is great for young and old alike.  As opposed to the traditional fairy tale type story, Disney has taken a different approach this time.  Instead of human or animal heroes, we have monsters.  It has the usual entertaining Disney storyline, complete with enough twists and turns to keep it enjoyable.  And, true to form, Disney has made this film both funny and entertaining.  This is a definite keeper, and will be a great addition to anyone's Disney or animated film collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JJOV69MAU2J2.html">A1JJOV69MAU2J2</a><br/><p>The folks at Pixar have really outdone themselves with this joy-filled DVD package, which I was lucky to receive about a month before the official release.<br />If you have not yet seen the movie, have no fear, buy the DVD, do not rent. You will not regret it. Wildly imaginative, totally hilarious and yet filled with deeper meanings and fine acting, Monster's Inc. is first-rate family entertainment that rewards multiple viewings.<br />And like other Pixar pictures, Randy Newman's unique musical talent is a wonderful antidote to the schlock you will find in other companies' animated pictures.<br />As for the 2-disc DVD set, the bonus disc alone is worth the price of admission. Most DVD "deluxe" packages that I have seen to date have a haphazard collection of lame "making of" features, a few deleted scenes and previews. Not with Monsters Inc. This well-thought out disc is packed with fun games, entertaining documentaries on the movie and on the crazy people at Pixar, and the bonus "Mike's New Car" short among the hours of features on this disc. Instead of 90 minutes of movie, you are really getting four or five hours of real entertainment.<p>The director's commentary track is also a well-thought out addition to the disc, not just an annoying throwaway that you will find on other discs. My wife and I really enjoyed the story behind the story, and the fun that the Pixar folks had in making this movie is infectious. <p>I can't recommend this enough.<p>Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A356HRZZFCEGL1.html">A356HRZZFCEGL1</a><br/><p>***This review may contain spoilers***<br /><br />When "Monsters, Inc."first came out, some perceived a rivalry with "Shrek".  I simply want to conclude that I enjoyed both heartily and own both DVDS, and that both are highly accomplished animated features. On the old "Ebert and Roeper" TV show, I remember that critic Richard Roeper somewhat dismissed the film as something the kids would enjoy, but something where the adults would be glancing at their watches every few minutes. I can assure Mr. Roeper that my eyes did not stray ONCE during the film; the poor fellow must have been jaded by so-called sophisticated movies.<br /><br />I will not rehash the plot. I will say that all elements that constitute a movie, from background to characterization, were dazzling, convincing, and comprehensive. Monstropolis emerges as a fully fleshed out dimension uncannily mirroring our own - even up to the minute, with the simultaneously uproarious but sobering scene where a monster returns from the human dimension with a child's sock stuck to his back and he is manhandled (monster-handled) by decontamination crew members. Mike Waslowski (Billy Crystal) and James P. ("Sully") Sullivan (Goodman) move easily through this world. While the "Odd Couple" pairing is obviously not new (as admittedly, the plot - BUT WHO CARES?), Crystal and Goodman add spicy spin to their camaraderie. Despite Crystal's comedic presence, Goodman anchors this movie with his hulking and massive but ultimately sensitive and caring character, well, at least a good part of the time. Boo gives Sully a run for his money in the presence department.<br /><br />Despite superficial plot similarities to Toy Story (especially in the climactic dimensional door pursuit - yes, a potential Disney theme ride) and yes, even a smidgen of "King Kong), "Monsters, Inc." stands on its own as a fascinating, well-rendered, multi-faceted piece of work. It is NOT a sickeningly cloying, sweet movie. Its moments of tenderness are balanced with some unsettling moments (e.g., Sully's scare demonstration (scared me, too) which terrifies Boo, Boo's restraint in the "Scream Suction" device by the unctuously reptilian Randall, and Sully's/Randall's fight, where Sully is being strangled by his invisible enemy). Sully's and Boo's developing relationship mixed in both laughter and tears. The dialogue and presence of the supporting characters was natural, matter-of-fact, and all the more funny for it.<br /><br />In short, "Monster, Inc."'s plan came wonderfully together. Despite some commentators' views, the movie DOES have messages, not only of love and devotion and self-acceptance, but also about having the courage to risk altering a lifetime of conditioned thinking and behavior when it proves to be misguided. Pixar, you've done it again. Keep doing it...please!<br /><br />ONE QUIBBLE: Boo spends a considerable amount of time in the Monstropolis dimension. I wonder what her parents were thinking when she went missing. Perhaps the Monstropolis dimension is on a different time line, where hours there are the equivalent of minutes in our dimension (time relativity and all).</p></br></body></html>

I had never read the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307387135">acclaimed 2005 novel</a> by author Cormac McCarthy, the basis of the film, but it's obvious that the story ambiguities, philosophizing tone and eccentric side characters were key draws for the idiosyncratic Coen brothers, Ethan and Joel, who again wrote and directed together as a team. Immediately familiar are the dark sensibilities that make an arid-looking West Texas a most unlikely place for a noir-type thriller, but the Coens' rich sense of character and place are certainly evident. At the same time, the relentless chase in the movie is so dominant that there is little time for them to showcase the quirky sense of humor that makes 1996's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009W5CA">Fargo</a> a modern classic. There are a few refreshingly amusing moments here and there, especially those involving the sheriff, but I have to admit that the lurid, heart-stopping scenes are what sear in my memory.<br /><br />Set around 1980 (a point that isn't that clear until there is mention of Vietnam) near the Mexican border, Llewelyn Moss is out hunting in the sagebrush and comes upon the bloody aftermath of a failed drug deal. In the back of a pickup truck are a sizable payload of heroin and two million dollars. He makes off with the money, but through an act of unexpected and belated conscience, he becomes a man on the run by a number of different parties. Chief among them is Anton Chigurh, an unconscionable hitman who escapes local police custody and closes in on Moss with unfettered conviction and unnerving calm. Surrounding both men is soon-to-retire Sheriff Ed Tom Bell, whose county is where the initial crime scene occurs. The characters' fates collide as the plot twists and turns, but the focus becomes less on the storyline and more on how they bring on their own dire situations through their own machinations. Given how the Coens end the movie (which apparently mirrors McCarthy's book) and some holes in the plot, the movie gains its emotional resonance as a tale of self-accountability.<br /><br />The performances of the three leads are excellent. Sporting a hideous mop-top haircut, the versatile Javier Bardem (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXRG">Before Night Falls</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00080Z53O">The Sea Inside</a>) manages to play Chigurh as the heartless killer he is by emphasizing the warped sense of honor that makes his acts reasonable to him. His manner is so discomforting that I was conflicted as to whether I should cringe vulnerably or avert my eyes entirely every time Chigurh shows up on the screen. Cast perfectly to type as the laconic Bell, Tommy Lee Jones is an assuring presence despite the drug-trading malevolence engulfing his territory, a development that makes his character realize that he has become a man out of his time (thus the movie's title). Usually a journeyman actor (with a famous wife, Diane Lane, and an even more famous <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JBXXXG">mother-in-law</a>), Josh Brolin (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXKA">Hollow Man</a>) conveys the precarious balance between opportunistic and decent with minimum fuss. As his worried wife Clara Jean, Kelly MacDonald has just a few effective scenes, and her final one attains a becalming power. The only fly in the ointment is Woody Harrelson, just too familiar a presence to be entirely convincing as a talkative bounty hunter who would be a compelling match for Chigurh. Of special note is the masterful cinematography by Roger Deakins, a past veteran of the Coen's films, which perfectly captures the rural setting.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JH5J1KQAUBMP.html">A1JH5J1KQAUBMP</a><br/><p>An unemployed welder (Josh Brolin) stumbles upon the scene of a drug transaction gone wrong and absconds with a suitcase full of cash.  This puts a ruthless killer (Javier Bardem) on his trail.  Meanwhile, an aging sheriff (Tommy Lee Jones) follows in the wake of the many violent encounters that ensue, trying to make sense of what is happening.<br /><br />I'm pleased to see that, as of this writing, so many people have rated this film so highly.  In the theater where I saw it, several people were quite vocally angered by the finale, and I can understand the reason even though I don't share their disappointment.  For much of the film, writer/directors Joel and Ethan Coen give us every reason to believe that we are watching a film that, however exceptional it may be, follows certain conventions of the action genre.  In the end, though, (and I'm trying to be very careful not to give any spoilers) we are denied a key scene that any other action film would have given us, and the focus shifts to the tired sheriff played by Tommy Lee Jones.  The theme of the film becomes apparent: the escalating violence accompanying the increase of the drug trade is indeed making the US "no country for old men," but rather a land where the energy and savagery of a new breed of younger criminal may be intensifying the violence of the criminal element to an unprecedented degree.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X1CEGHTHMBL1.html">A1X1CEGHTHMBL1</a><br/><p>While out hunting, Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) spots a bunch of vehicles parked in the desert. What he has found is a drug deal gone bad. Multiple men are dead and one surviving man in a truck is near death. A blood trail leads away from the site and he tracks it down. A few miles away he finds a dead man leaning against the only tree in sight and he is clutching a large catalog case filled with over two million dollars.<br /><br />Moss takes the money home and hides it. Feeling bad for the dying man he returns to bring him water and is discovered by the drug ring's partners. What now begins is a continuing chase scene where they track down Moss to get their money back and to kill him. A hired professional hit man goes after him and he is a relentless killer who never gives up and will kill anybody in his way.<br />This is an excellent movie and the storyline follows the book very well. The roles of Sherriff Ed Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) and the killer Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) are very well portrayed and the direction of the movie is well done.<br /><br />I like Cormac McCarthy's novels and he is one of the finest writers of our time. This movie is very good but bloody. I recommend it to you but you should be aware it is violent!</p></br><a href="../users/AU25GMX57XBVO.html">AU25GMX57XBVO</a><br/><p>This is a pretty good movie and I had to watch it twice to say so yet I don't know about the best picture nomination.  I have not seen some of it's competitors from 2007 but maybe after I do could agree.  The storyline is well written I think but it seemed to lack that personal touch I usually get from a great movie.  The ending I thought was so so and I think had to watch the movie another time to understand the ending.  Thought some of the more violent scenes were a little to violent but that can sometimes help a movie.  Overall should keep your attention well from the beginning to then end and then you can decide if it deserves best picture nomination.<br /><br />Peter J. Miller</p></br><a href="../users/AGEIT17HENDIS.html">AGEIT17HENDIS</a><br/><p>Cinematic studies of murderous psychopaths have a long and honored position in film history. Early on in the gangster movies of the 1930s, in such films as The Petrified Forest (with Humphrey Bogart as Duke Mantee) and, perhaps more famously, White Heat with true stone-killer mad man James Cagney ready to blow up everything (and throw an off-hand grapefruit or two), audiences got to confront truly banal (thanks Hannah Arendt) evil characters. Remorseless, if not always efficient. The psycho (played understatedly by Javier Bardem)in No Country For Old Men  written by Cormac McCarthy) carries on that tradition, although as we are now a little more inured to mass murders and odd-ball methods of killing on the screen that those earlier audiences, the methods have been ramped up. In short, take no prisoners. None. Moreover, the Brothers Coen want to, around the murder and mayhem, squeeze in a little tale about how this country (well, Texas, great American West country, Larry McMurtry Last Picture Show country, anyway) has gone to hell in a handbasket since the old western frontiers vanished into, well, civilization.<br /><br />Of course no savage tale of the New West, the border New West, would be complete without some drug deal going south (no pun intended), going south badly. The action of this film is centered on a discover of some dough, some serious dough, just waiting to be plucked like taking it from the low branches of a tree by the first guy (played by Josh Brolin) who comes on the scene, the first hungry, break-out hungry guy who comes along. Now if you or I, maybe not hungry enough, came upon a desert scene with a bunch of stone shoot-out dead bodies, a truckload of dope, and a satchel of dough, we would walk, hell, run away, right. There would be no story then though. So our lonesome hungry cowboy grabs for the brass ring. Unfortunately said dough belongs to those who have hired a bad-ass stone killer ready, very ready, and very willing to exterminate whatever number it takes to get said dough back. And throw in a few innocent by-standers and others for laughs.<br /><br />But this is Texas remember and so once the chase is on the local law, in the person mainly, of one wised-up, old-timey sheriff, played by Tommy Lee Jones, a little out of his element in these new times when there is no honor among thieves (there really never was) and the crimes pile up more quickly and haphazardly than in the old days, is on the hunt. But age and world-weariness have taken their toll and old Tommy Lee is always about a step, maybe two steps, behind the central action. Needless to say things cannot turn out well here, and they don't. Ya, this is no country for old men. Got it.</p></br><a href="../users/AJMU8VVFKMZI4.html">AJMU8VVFKMZI4</a><br/><p>I'm surprised that I liked this film.  I did have to replay the ending to make sure that the DVD hadn't skipped or something.  When I sat back to think about the point the film was making, I believe I understood its point.  Every generation once it reaches a certain age thinks things are getting worse.  The whole 'back in my day' soliloquies we give, but the truth is elusive sometimes.  The wickedness of mankind has always been violent.  We are the ones that change.  Our tolerance, our view of the world and what we think our place is in it.  Everyday there is some story in the news that makes absolutely no sense, but in our films we want the motivation spelled out to us.  In this piece I think the Coen brothers and McCarthy does a good job in portraying "senseless" violence.  Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A34PAZQ73SL163.html">A34PAZQ73SL163</a><br/><p>I was taken aback by how interesting and excellent this film was. I saw several reviews over the course of the last year that claimed No Country for Old Men was a disappointment. I found it to be anything but that. Honestly, at just over 2 hours long, I wished its length was double. Its ending may not be what viewers desire but it was appropriate given the nature of the characters. I found The Ladykillers very poor so I see this movie as definitely being a return to form for the Coen brothers who, next to Martin Scorsese, are the best directors of our era (in my opinion). Yes, Josh Brolin was excellent, yes, Tommy Lee Jones was excellent, but this fellow Javier Bardem was absolutely superb. I had never heard of him previously, but he played the perfect villain--a mixture of subtlety and aggression. The guy is scarier than DeNiro was in Cape Fear. He made the film for me, but then again, the Cormac McCarthy plot would have won me over anyway.</p></br><a href="../users/AY46DEOJJYFTW.html">AY46DEOJJYFTW</a><br/><p>I loved Cormac McCarthy's book NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN and thought the movie plays true to the book. It doesn't pull any punches, doesn't sell itself out or wind up in a Hollywood fantasy ending. It is stark, violent, desperate and a bit nostalgic. An old time county sheriff(Tommy Lee Jones, brilliant in a laconic way) yearns for the days when the bad guys could be contained and caught without alot of violence. He could always solve a case without every using a gun but these days there is no limit to the violence(embodied by Javier Bardem's brilliant portrayal). Josh Brolin's character is out hunting and comes across a drug deal gone bad with bodies littered across the stark desert. A lone man is alive and begs him for water but he doesn't have any and takes off after finding a bag of money. But his conscience tears at him and he does the unthinkable even though he knows it is a stupid thing to do. He goes back to the scene of the crime to bring water to the man who by now is dead and he is seen by the drug bosses and the chase begins. My wife never really liked the movie, too violent and too abrupt of an ending. But like I said having read the book I think the film is brilliant and the best adaption of a Cormac McCarthy book I've seen. Any adaption of a McCarthy novel is close to impossible but the Coen Brothers have done it!</p></br><a href="../users/A3AOKQCH0YBZDS.html">A3AOKQCH0YBZDS</a><br/><p>Saw "No Country For Old Men" in the movie theaters when it 1st came out and thought it was riveting to watch from start to finish!<br /><br />This movie has a great cast of characters in it that make this movie interesting to watch along with the storyline itself. It is definitely a different take on a drug deal gone wrong & what may happen when an unlikely character stumbles across the aftermath & takes off with the loot after the drug deal has tragically gone way south.<br /><br />I liked the movie because it was interesting and different than other movies in the same genre. I also liked the contrasts between the violence and dark humor throughout this movie. The acting was superb on all counts by the entire cast members... However, my favorite performances were that of Javier Bardem, whom won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor in his portrayal of the character, Anton Chigurh, whom I thought was the scariest bad guy I've ever seen in my life!! Tommy Lee Jones was also wonderful in his role of Sheriff Ed Tom Bell & I also enjoyed Kelly MacDonald's performance as Carla Jean Moss.<br /><br />******SPOILER SECTION, SO IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE FILM DON'T READ WHAT I WRITE NEXT******<br /><br />The only thing I didn't enjoy was the ending of this movie.... I felt like it ended terribly!!!!! Did anyone else feel this way too????? What was up with the last 5 minutes where we see Tommy Lee Jones' character tell his wife about the dream/dreams he had the night before? Are we to take it that the entire film we just watched was a nightmare/bad dream Jones' character had the night before?</p></br><a href="../users/AXV9GS0TMSVW.html">AXV9GS0TMSVW</a><br/><p>I watched No Country for Old Men in a theatre without about 5 other people in it.  Three people sitting behind me cussed the screen when the movie was over.  Part of me was saying they didn't get it.  Another part was saying they weren't supposed to.<br /><br />No Country for Old Men is a top notch suspense thriller by the Coen Brothers.  The characters and dialogue are carved so well that you can't help but get taken in.  But if you ask me what the film is about, I'll tell you it involves some deal gone wrong and a Texas man ends up running all over the state trying to keep the money while staying alive.  If you ask me what the film means, I might tell you to pick up the book.  It'll serve you better.<br /><br />As suspense thrillers go, this is great.  It's a chase around Texas.  If you're from Texas, you'll know they got it right.  The Coen's have these sparse locations where you'll feel just a tad afraid because of the isolation.  I particularly love the showdown between Josh Brolin and Javier Bardien in Eagle Pass.  It's shot at night and wondering when and where Bardien's terrifying Anton Sigur is going to strike simply leaves you on the edge.<br /><br />The talent involved is superb. Bardien deservedly got a lot of attention for his role as Anton Sigur, commanding attention anytime he's on screen.  He is easily the best villain I've seen in years.  Josh Brolin is something of an unsung hero though, easily slipping into the shoes of a man who knows he's gotten himself into deep as he's on the run through Texas.  Kelly MacDonald is almost recognizable as his wife.  I didn't know it was her until someone told me.  Then there's the infallible Tommy Lee Jones, not once sharing a scene with Brolin or Bardien, but nonetheless helps paint a picture of the horror going on around him as the officer who stumbles upon the case.  Jones' deliver is sharp, dry, and even has a bit of humor and, if you follow the film's themes, is really the heart of the story.<br /><br />The film deals with some rather challenging themes which the Coen Brothers paint quite well in some scenes, particularly when Bardien and Brolin's characters deal with more youthful characters in separate scenes.  The result is nothing short of poetic.  But this leads to the conclusion, which I will not spoil, but will say it involves analysys.  This is where I have take one star off of an otherwise perfect film.  The ending challenges us but also leaves us asking the question I posed earlier - what exactly does this film mean?  The ending functions better on paper.  It's smart, but a bit much for a movie that is filled with suspense and a good dose of action, almost playing down everything you just saw as rather trivial.  It's okay if you like it, but don't be ashamed if you don't like it or don't get it.</p></br><a href="../users/A10E3F50DIUJEE.html">A10E3F50DIUJEE</a><br/><p>I, personally, found this movie to be quite excellent.<br /><br />The opening scene is just terrifying with Javier Bardem.  (Although, the thick accent of Tommy Lee Jones' voice over was a bit of an obstacle at first.)<br /><br />I think the overall film was just great, and true to the novel it was based on.  Every performance was mesmerizingly good!  The eerie absense of a score made it all the more real for me as a viewer.  And the cinematography was well executed.  I could not have asked for a better adapation.<br /><br />A word of caution: I know many people cannot stand this film, but I think it deserves at least one impartial viewing.  I liked this as a modernization of "the western" genre.  In stead of trying to cram modern ideals into an historic setting, the Coen Brothers updated the western using great source material as their guide.<br /><br />I highly recommend this film, especially for Javier Bardem's chilling performance as one of the greatest maniacs in movie history.</p></br><a href="../users/A1OS2HX2CWQIC7.html">A1OS2HX2CWQIC7</a><br/><p>While it's very easy to trace comparisons between this film and prior Coen projects, such an exercise seems almost trivial when one considers that this story was adapted from one of Cormac McCarthy's most accessible novels. It's comforting to note that the Coens have found a story compatible with their usual trademarks: dialogue characterized by a regional vernacular, eccentrics who both voice and embody the story's themes and a measured pace interjected by bizarre scenes of intense violence.<br /><br />Although the narrative follows the aftermath of a south Texas drug deal gone brutally awry, the central theme of the movie - a world changing for the worse - is always ominously present either in the forefront or periphery. When adapting this novel to the screen, the Coens were wise not to alter McCarthy's despairing, unamenable conclusions.<br /><br />While all of the performances are excellent (most of the principal cast affect drawls nearly as convincing as that of native Texan Jones), the unquestionable centerpoint of the movie is Javier Bardem, whose enormous screen presence and cultivated air of impassive menace command the viewer's attention. Bardem's English is surprisingly keen and his grasp of this simple, vicious persona is startling and entirely convincing. Bardem is already known to many Americans via his extraordinary performance in Before Night Falls and even his breakthrough role in Jam&oacute;n, jam&oacute;n. Hopefully, this incredible performance will establish one of Spain's most popular actors as a widely recognizable talent in North America.<br /><br />From a technical standpoint, this is surely the most beautiful film that the Coens have ever shot. The movie's photographic clarity and fastidious direction produce scenes of extraordinary vividness. Desolate west Texan desert landscapes, endless stretches of interstate highway and even commonplace motel rooms are all rendered with a distinct immediacy. The movie's impeccable sound design isn't encumbered by any involved music; only a few faint ambient tones are heard at certain pivotal moments. While Coen mainstay composer Carter Burwell contributed one track that scores the movie's end titles and a few ambient tones that briefly underscore certain key scenes, no music is featured elsewhere in the film. The result is a soundtrack that never obstructs the tension, grim humor or somber milieu of this film's extraordinary proceedings.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ALOIPRR8Q06J.html">A1ALOIPRR8Q06J</a><br/><p>Go to film critic Jim Emerson's blog, "scanners". Just google "Jim Emerson" and you'll find it.<br /><br />Read Jim Emerson on NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN and read a letter Emerson received from a viewer of the film. I promise you that these two commentaries on this film will help you better appreciate it.<br /><br />What I want to say here is something people have to understand is that a movie is not only about what it is about but also HOW it's about, what it's about. OK? Meaning is to be found in the way the story is told and what is left out of a picture sometimes adds to the picture. Less can be more and what is not there can say just as much, if not more, than what is.<br /><br />Let go of super conventional western/American hang-ups about having a concise, tiddy ending. It ends exactly where it needs to. The way the movie comes to a close has to do with what the story itself is about. Try to be more open minded and you can appreciate more.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ARRAMXWT83PT.html">A2ARRAMXWT83PT</a><br/><p>This film is up for many Oscars this year. It is not hard to see why! It is another instant classic from the Coen brothers. I've seen it twice already, and I can tell you, it holds up - maybe even calls for - repeat viewings. The performances here are amazing. I do believe that this is Josh Brolin's best performance ever. Who knew that Brandt from "The Goonies" would grow up to be such a fantastic actor? Tommy Lee Jones is perfect as usual, and embodies his character to a T. The same could be said for Javier Bardem who is absolutely terrifying as a ruthless serial killer. The writing here is perfect, as expected. There are two films that I am rooting for in the Best Picture Oscar department. This is one of them. Don't miss it!</p></br><a href="../users/A18G7GG53G2X8A.html">A18G7GG53G2X8A</a><br/><p>The Coen Brothers' "No Country for Old Men" is one of those films that can speak volumes in few words, and it successfully moves forward despite going at a snail's pace. This essentially goes against every principle I believe a movie should follow, so in all honesty, I don't know why I enjoyed this film so much. I don't think it has anything to do with the story, which is actually quite simplistic: taking place in 1980, a psychopath searches for a hunter that stole a suitcase full of drug money in the remote deserts of Texas. I'm sure it has nothing to do with the structure, which seems to intentionally forgo a clear beginning, middle, and end. And I know it has nothing to do with the characters, which are crafted so realistically that they don't mesh with cinematic escapism. So what on earth is left? Why did this film work so well?<br /><br />All I can come up with are the numerous scenes of conversation, which are fascinating in both style and speech. At some point or another, every character has something to say. More importantly, every character says what they have to say very well. Take, for example, Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), a low-key yet murderous madman whose weapon of choice is a pressurized air gun--in a scene early on, he challenges a convenience store owner to a psychological duel, and after flipping a coin, he asks the owner to call it. We immediately get the sense that whichever end is facing up will determine whether or not the owner dies. How this scene ends doesn't matter; what does matter is how it reaches the end. Even the way the characters sound is important, simply because tone says much more than actual words do. Bardem uses a deep, monotone voice that perfectly accentuates Chigurh's methodical, sadistic nature.<br /><br />He channels that brutal energy to find Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin), who foolishly gets himself involved in the aftermath of a failed drug trade. After wandering into an area littered with bullet-ridden cars, decaying bodies, and a gigantic stash of heroine, he finds and takes a suitcase stuffed with more than $2 million in cash. He soon realizes that he has to be on the run, which goes completely over the head of his young wife, Carla Jean (Kelly Macdonald), who's caring and approachable but easily confused. She and Moss speak to each other as if they've come to an understanding somewhere along the way: He can do what he wants so long as she doesn't question him too much. This isn't to say that he's an abuser--truth be told, he doesn't even raise his voice to her. It seems to be more a matter of trust, which will be difficult to earn since stealing the money has gotten her involved.<br /><br />As Moss moves from motel to motel with Chigurh in hot pursuit, retired sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) begins investigating the case. Here's a man beaten down by life, unwilling to continue working yet unable to keep himself busy at home. He's weary, lost, and uninspired, at one point saying, "I always thought when I got older, God would sort of come into my life in some way. He didn't." He goes on to say, "I don't blame Him; if I was Him, I'd have the same opinion about me that He does." Most movies with dialogue like this tend to make the character's situation obvious, detailing for the audience what exactly brought him or her to that point. No such details are given in the case of "No Country for Old Men," which only made Jones' character that much more fascinating. Bell begins the case with enough drive but soon loses himself to doubt and frustration.<br /><br />And then there's Carson Wells (Woody Harrelson), a special agent assigned to find both Chigurh and the missing money. His purpose in the story isn't exactly clear to me: on the one hand, he engages Chigurh in a way that's mesmerizing; on the other hand, his methods and reasoning skills are both mysterious and unrealistic. In other words, I just didn't get this guy. But when I think about the way the rest of the film plays out, it's quite possible that I wasn't supposed to get him. Maybe he was meant to be a counterpoint to the insane Chigurh, another enigmatic character that plays against evil in an intentionally ambiguous way. There's really no knowing when it comes to a Coen Brothers movie.<br /><br />This is especially true of the ending, which isn't even partially explained by the word "unresolved." Quite frankly, it's maddeningly unsatisfying, about as anticlimactic as they get. So I once again find myself questioning why I was able to appreciate the film; "No Country for Old Men" is definitely wonderful, yet it twists wonderful storytelling techniques into something unrecognizable. This movie is in a league all its own, a crime drama so unique that it can't easily be overlooked. How it achieved this, I have no idea, and I doubt that multiple viewings would make things any clearer for me. I leave it to you to go see it and come up with your own reasons for liking it. This is a big thing for me to say--for all intents and purposes, this is a movie I should have hated.</p></br><a href="../users/A1U360OMVQRPUB.html">A1U360OMVQRPUB</a><br/><p>Spanish actor, Javier Bardem, plays one of the most cold-blooded, unstoppable killers to ever grace the big screen.  From the very first instant he steps into view in NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN as Anton Chigurh, Bardem radiates menace.  The captive bolt pistol he carries as a killing device and a one-size-fits-all door opener is grisly and awe-inspiring.  When he's initially introduced at the beginning of the film, gets arrested, then steps back through the handcuffs in the background while the deputy speaks to the sheriff in the foreground, a cold chill cycled through me until Chigurh killed the deputy.  By that time I was mesmerized.<br /><br />The Academy-award winning film is based on bestselling author Cormac McCarthy's novel of the same name.  Joel and Ethan Coen (FARGO, MILLER'S CROSSING) wrote and directed the film, returning to the crime and cowboy feel they love in so much of their work.<br /><br />The plot is relatively simple, but it provides a tightly-wound backdrop of tension and motivation for all concerned.  Josh Brolin is absolutely amazing as ex-Vietnam vet Llewelyn Moss, and most of the screen time the first half of the movie centers on him.  The movie is so terse that I had no idea who or what Brolin was or what he was ultimately after for quite some time.<br /><br />I loved the careful, contained way that Moss walks up on the killing ground where the two rival Mexican gangs shot it out and killed each other during a drug buy.  Brolin portrays a competent and savvy hunter, and I was rooting for him the whole way - until I found out he wasn't as good as I thought he was.  Even then, I'd bought so heavily into the character that I was pulling for him the whole way.  Especially after I saw that he was clearly out of his league.<br /><br />The movie delves into character without playing up the backstory too much.  It tells you just what you need to know about each person, and I found that amazing.  The dialogue is kept terse and to the point, while at the same time being witty and true to character and life.  Most of the time you're just watching action, forming your own opinions about things, and being surprised.  There isn't even a musical score to draw your attention off the developing plot and ever-tightening chase.<br /><br />With Chigurh and Moss both in motion, both trying to survive, the movie picks up with Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (played by Tommy Lee Jones) as he borrows his wife's horse to go out to the crime scene.  I loved Tommy Lee Jones.  I think he's one of the greatest actors to ever step into a movie, and he's at his absolute best when he's playing a character like Ed Tom Bell.  Those characters are some of the best natural fits for Jones that I've ever seen.  Bell is a man nearing retirement, but who's also certain that the world is changing faster than he can keep up with it.  Jones provides the voice-over at the beginning that won my heart before the last word floated out of the speakers.<br /><br />Moss, with over two million dollars in his hands, is determined to hang onto it.  Chigurh is determined to kill Moss and take it.  Bell just wants to make sense of everything that's happened and save whomever needs saving.<br /><br />The Coens are noted for their camera work and angles, and both things are used to the best of their abilities in this film.  The scenes move quickly.  The background is absolutely stunning in the high definition presentation of the Blu-ray disc.  The gunfights are exquisitely rendered, and violence smacks the viewer at regular intervals, often catching him off-guard.<br /><br />Even though I was prepared for the film to be bloody, I was still blown away by Chigurh's cold indifference.  I loved how the killer moved so methodically, though, never showing any emotions.  This is probably Brolin's best role and best acting ever.  Even though these actors are playing larger-than-life characters, never once is a scene overplayed, nor is the drama ever false.<br /><br />If you haven't seen NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN, you've got a great film ahead of you.  And if you have seen it, you'll find that the Blu-ray version brings the audio and video quality of the theater into your home in a big way.  Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A37S3ACL57LN62.html">A37S3ACL57LN62</a><br/><p>Javier Bardem (Anton Chigurh) is a cold blooded killer who totes an oxygen tank to quickly kill his victims. He kills without mercy for seemingly no reason at all other than he enjoys this pastime. An innocent man named Lynn (Josh Brolin) gets mixed up in his twisted pleasures when he accidentally comes across a large murder scene. There are dead men and bullet holes everywhere all in the name of a drug deal gone bad. Lynn knows the money has to be close, and with rising greed discovers the man who absconded with the suitcase. He takes it home, knowing he is now doomed, and begins a fateful attempt to run away from Javier's bloodlust and search for redemption.<br /><br />You might notice that I didn't mention Tommy Lee Jones at all, and for good reason. His scenes are utterly forgettable and serve as a lame attempt to make the violent events in the movie somehow poetic and bigger than the dealings of crime. A scene near the end with a former cop is the culmination of this big-headedness.<br /><br />This film is terribly overrated. Sure, it is entertaining and sure the actors worked hard. Sure, the lighting was used well, but this film leaves you with nothing after you see it except the question of why it won best picture. Perhaps it won simply because the other nominees weren't stellar either. Either way, this film will hardly be talked about for years to come.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>`No Country for Old Men' could, for some, get lost in its own hype and wind up being that movie that everyone said you needed to see but proved to leave you wondering why everyone was so excited about it in the first place.  It's become so over praised that one walks into it expected the second coming, and for many that is just not what they are going to witness.<br /><br />But I urge you to pay close attention...because this movie is much more than you may think.<br /><br />`No Country...' is a very well rounded and extremely well crafted thriller that never lets go of its unnerving pace and opens itself up for an intriguing study of humanity at its worst.  It's a very, very good movie; a great movie at that; one that you will thoroughly enjoy and want to revisit time and time again.<br /><br />The film follows Llewelyn Moss, an army vet who just so happens to stubble upon some drug money.  Fully aware of the danger he's subjecting himself and his wife to he decides to take the money and run.  What he doesn't realize is that the man responsible for the `danger' is not anything Llewelyn will be able to stand against.  Anton Chigurh is death; plain and simple.  Chigurh pursues Llewelyn with reckless abandon while Moss' wife Carla Jean tries to keep a level head about the whole episode.  Llewelyn is also being pursued by the local Sheriff, Ed Tom Bell; an old timer who has just about had enough of what this `country' has turned into.<br /><br />What helps elevate this film from standard thriller to exceptional cinema is the masterful cast; from the actors to the directors.  Everyone involved in this film delivers top notch.  Josh Brolin has been tampering with fame for a long time now and finally he's starred in something to be proud of.  His portrayal of Llewelyn Moss is fantastically tempered and controlled.  Tommy Lee Jones is also marvelous here.  This is how I like my Jones; raw and emotionally crippled.  He plays the down trodden `thinker' extremely well.  Kelly Macdonald is flawless here, utterly flawless.  She serves as a beating heart in a film filled to the brim with apathy.<br /><br />The film though belongs to Javier Bardem.  Everything that has been said about this man and his performance is true.  He is commanding and relentlessly savage.  There's a grin that appears on his face often within this film, a grin that gives way to his menacing insanity; a grimace that cements the character of Anton Chigurh in our minds forever.  While I won't be one to say that Chigurh is as masterful a creation as Hannibal Lecter I will say that he is one of the most memorable and interesting villains ever to appear on the big screen.<br /><br />I will say that there is no way that Bardem is `supporting' in this film for he has more screen time then any other actor and really, in the end, the film is all about him.<br /><br />Joel and Ethan Coen masterfully wade through Cormac McCarthy's orgasmic novel and deliver a very faithful adaptation.  Having just recently read the novel myself I was floored at how accurate a translation this film proved to be.  That said, there are two scenes within the novel; my two favorite scenes at that; that were not represented well here.  The first is not even part of the movie, and that is when Llewelyn picks up a young hitchhiker.  They have a very deep and moving conversation that engrossed me so much that I was disappointed to see it completely snubbed here.  The second is that of Carla Jean and Anton's unfortunate meeting.  That meeting is here in the film, and it is probably the most moving scene in the film, but it's not given the attention it deserved.  In the novel the scene is a little more lengthy and it's `completed'; here, in the film, it's left a little too `wide open'.<br /><br />Those two issues are not enough to really complain about for the film is so smooth and so masterfully constructed that those minor squabbles are easily forgiven.<br /><br />The Coen's have built a well oiled and hard working machine that offers the audience a `complete' experience.  This is not a film built on mere acting or a well written script.  It is a film that has those two things and then some.  The film is a marvel to watch.  The cinematography, while not showy, is commanding and awe inspiring.  It captures the mood and emotion that this film sets out to create.  The editing of this film is probably the finest I've seen all year.  It's such a smooth ride; each scene masterfully running into the next.  Another thing I appreciated is the lack of score here.  I love a good score, but what the Coen's have done here was allow the film to speak for itself.  The silence is unsettling and it forces the audience to fall inside the events on screen.  This also allows us to truly pay attention to the small details; the footsteps, gun clicks and heavy breathing; all of which heighten the intensity of the film.<br /><br />On the outset, `No Country for Old Men' may seem like an above average thriller; but there is so much more to this film then drugs, money and murder.  Sure, it is not flawless but it's a film that is perfectly flawed, in that its flaws seem to embellish its beauty.  The characters are walking flaws; the situation is a huge flaw; its reasoning is flawed, but in the end those flaws equal one amazing experience for they expose the imperfection that is this `country'.</p></br><a href="../users/A10X0JN8KTK89H.html">A10X0JN8KTK89H</a><br/><p>I am surprised at the number of negative reviews here.  For some, it seems they don't realize that the Coen brothers didn't write the story of No Country for Old Men.  It's a novel by Cormac McCarthy, and the Coens take great swathes of dialogue and narration verbatim from the book.  I also don't understand what is pretentious about this movie.  It's a fairly straightforward regional thriller set in west Texas in 1980, when violence seem to get more violent as cocaine and heroine started to flow into the United States at an alarming rate.  This new brand of drug dealing gives birth to pure evil, incarnated in the character of Anton Chigurh (played wonderfully by Javier Bardem).  I can see how this kind of a story may not be for everyone.  The violence in this film is serious unlike Raising Arizona and the regionalisms aren't meant to be as funny as in Fargo (although I laughed a lot at the west Texan wit and colloquialisms in this film).<br /><br />The cinematography and sound are excellent as in all Coen brothers' movies, and the acting is spectacular.  Josh Brolin performs well as the resourceful Llewelyn Moss.  He is able to work a scene by himself with no music and no dialogue.  Tommy Lee Jones gives a good performance as a tired old sheriff, Ed Tom Bell.  Even Woody Harrelson does a decent impression of a professional hit man.  But it's Javier Bardem who steals the movie.  He delivers his lines in a measured, very low and gravelly voice.  His Spanish accent comes and goes at surprising times, often in the middle of words.  He has what must be the devil's haircut; he's one of the creepiest human characters I've seen in a long time.<br /><br />Cormac McCarthy seems to have accidently written No Country for Old Men for the Coen brothers.  It shares many elements with their previous films: regionalism, movements from wide open to claustrophobic spaces, Western motifs, cartoon and nightmare natures of violence, and surrealism.  The Coen brothers do a fine job, and I recommend the film to all of their fans.</p></br><a href="../users/AVF60NZ99H9D5.html">AVF60NZ99H9D5</a><br/><p>It's not easy to critisize filmmakers you respect (have liked Fargo, Blood Simple, Barton Fink, etc.), but this one here could have been something truly great...alas, the story limps along and finally leaves you saying What the hell?<br /><br />One solution may have been to make the film longer, because as it stands there is hardly enough time to tell everyone's tale as it should have been told: three different storylines going simultaneously that finally collide and/or connect to some sort of deneument.<br /><br />All you have to do is take a look at Sergio Leone's masterpiece Once Upon A time In America to get what I am saying here: the short version was choppy and didn't work, the long/director's cut works terrifically and is considered (by many) to be one hell of a motion picture, perhaps even a classic of its kind.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KUUII2GSHN7T.html">A3KUUII2GSHN7T</a><br/><p>Our opening scene begins with one of the more powerful voice-overs I've heard in film, a voice that challenges humanity itself with its scratchy lines and raw, buring outlook that continues to haunt me. The vintage sheriff type (played and voiced by Tommy Lee Jones) states, "You can't help but compare yourself gainst the oldtimers. Can't help but wonder how they would've operated these times. There was this boy I sent to the gas chamber at Huntsville here a while back. My arrest and my testimony. He killed a fourteen-year-old girl. Papers said it was a crime of passion but he told me there wasn't any passion to it. Told me that he'd been planning to kill somebody for about as long as he could remember. Said that if they turned him out he'd do it again. Said he knew he was going to hell. Be there in about fifteen minutes. I don't know what to make of that. I surely don't. The crime you see now, it's hard to even take its measure. It's not that I'm afraid of it. I always knew you had to be willing to die to even do this job - not to be glorious. But I don't want to push my chips forward and go out and meet something I don't understand. To go into something you don't understand you would have to be crazy or *become part of it*."<br /><br />This series of voice-over encapsulates the film's point - that evil no longer needs a reason, and probably never did; only now, evil is more prevalent and the old ways of handling evil? Well, they're are finished. They simply won't work anymore.<br /><br />So begins our film. The war that rages in this film is not so much that of a bounty hunter pitted against the man who stole his employer's money, or even of a conflict between an aging sheriff and a heartless killer. The war that resides here is that of ideas. On one hand, we have the idea that holds tightly to a belief that evil needs a reason and follows a code, however shady that code might be, and combating such an evil follows a line of logic. On the other, we have a thoughtless method of killing, where life has no value, and one's death resides as easily on the flip of a coin. It's in this film where the conflict of those two ideas converge, and as reality sets in on Jones' character and those around him, it's clear that evil no longer follows anything, and that some are incapable of rational thought or the slimmest forms of mercy.<br /><br />No Country For Old Men is a difficult, but probably necessary watch for those who study the nature of man and the combating elements which confound logical thought. It's also an excellent piece of cinema. I've never in my life been on the edge of my seat during so many scenes, or at the same time found myself not caring for any of the characters, except perhaps the Carla Jean Moss character. Even she, however, seems just another pawn in a deeper study on the nature of man and the things we'd hope we are as opposed to the things we actually exhibit.</p></br><a href="../users/A140XH16IKR4B0.html">A140XH16IKR4B0</a><br/><p>On one level, NCFOM is story about the collision of cowboy culture with drug culture. Set in 1980, it concerns the aftermath of a drug deal gone wrong, and a missing satchel holding over $1 million. Good guy Llewelyn Moss comes across the money, decides to keep it, and figures he is smart to outrun the bad guys, who also want it back. Yet two larger forces are also at play -- the law, represented by Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) and an enigmatic sociopath, Anton Chigurh, played by Javier Bardem. Anton is fond of shooting metal bolts into skulls or door locks using nearly-noiseless blasts from a compressed air tank. That's when he is not using a silenced shotgun with brutal accuracy. The plot moves the characters from desert to trailer park to motel, with the outcome always in doubt and the intensity on high.<br /><br />But there's more going on here than a shoot-em-up. The movie explores ideas of fate, intention and luck. It also explores the frustrating realization at the base of every human life that one's mission, however grand or petty, however exemplary or banal or destructive, will remain unfinished. As the body count mounts, thanks to Anton and his gas gun, Sheriff Bell struggles with coming end of his own career. As the tide of the drug trade begins to overwhelm his familiar world, he comes face to face with the fact that he will not finish the job he began. Only Death, cold and implacable, extends its icy grip beyond the human lifespan.<br /><br />NCFOM is extremely violent, though the violence is rendered believably. The suspense level is very high until close to the end. This is not a feel good movie, but has other rewards -- the terrific writing, convincing acting, and even bitter humor. Standout performaces were too numerous to mention, but include Josh Brolin as Moss, Kelly MacDonald as his worried but cooperative wife and Garret Dillahunt as Sheriff Bell's smart but unseasoned protege Deputy Wendell.<br /><br />Well-made as it is, this film has not sat well with me. I should have trusted my instincts when I saw the trailer. The violence is right on the edge of gratuitous, threatening to bury the message beneath the mayhem. The Coen Bros may have crafted a fine movie, if you can stand it, but it was no movie for this old man.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GPEV42IO41CI.html">A2GPEV42IO41CI</a><br/><p>The story opens in the desolate west Texas countryside, as Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) stumbles upon a drug deal gone bad and makes off with a suitcase full of money.  He figures he'll be followed and he's right; Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), a ruthless and patient killer, is after him.  Chigurh is, in turn, being tracked by the local sheriff (Tommy Lee Jones), a good ol' country boy who's amazed at how violent criminals have become lately.<br /><br />I'd heard this was a bloody guy-movie so I watched it grudgingly, but I actually liked it a lot.  Yes, it's got a high body count but the violence wasn't off-putting and the cat-and-mouse tale is spell-binding.  The tension stays at 100% throughout and is really frightening.  It's a battle of wits and the only question is:  Will Good win over Evil?  The movie won a Best Picture Oscar and Bardem won for Best Supporting Actor. He's very convincing and charismatic as the heartless madman and does a great American accent.  Jones is perfect as the good ol' boy sheriff, philosophizin' 'bout bad guys.  Brolin was fine as the everyman character of Llewelyn.<br /><br />This is a no-holds barred shoot 'em up for sure, but I still recommend it as an entertaining and well-made film.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>Cormac McCarthy's novel NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN has been successfully transformed into a film in the skilled hands of Ethan and Joel Coen.  The story is intact, the characters are given the dialog so uniquely McCarthy's invention, and the horror of the message of the book - that we have come to a point in time when crime, especially random murder, surrounds our lives - is, if anything, even more pungent than on the pages of the book.  It is an amazing, and a highly disturbing movie, and while this viewer is one of the few who does not believe it deserved the Oscar for Best Picture, there is little doubt that it is a brilliant piece of cinema.<br /><br />The story is fairly simple: on the raw plains of Texas a slaughter of men and dogs engaged in a drug deal is discovered by a simple guy Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin).  Moss observes the mayhem, sees the drugs, finds the 2 million dollar payoff money, takes the money, and embarks on an escape, leaving his wife Carla (Kelly Macdonald) to escape the pursuit of a mad killer Chigurh (Javier Bardem) who in turn is being pursued by the local sheriff (Tommy Lee Jones) and a hired hitman (Woody Harrelson). The satchel of money contains a tracking device and Chigurh has the instrument necessary to follow the trail the device leads.  The remainder of the film is the pursuit both in Texas and in Mexico, accompanied by countless brutal murders of all sorts by the crazed Chigurh, until a surprise ending.<br /><br />But the toughest part of this violent film is more in the discussion of shared philosophies between the sheriff and his old cronies: they reflect on the sad state of universal crime that is so different and more malevolent than in the 'old days'.  The conversations, in the superb dialog of these old men, bring our attention to some realities we would rather not confront, and those realities are even more disturbing than the repeated images of bloated bodies and senseless murders that fill the screen.  Jones, Brolin, and Bardem are indeed superb in their roles, but the small cameos of the townsfolk of Texas are little gems of acting and direction.  This is a difficult film to watch because of all of the violence, but the message is one we must heed. We may be allowing the creation of 'no country for any men'.  Grady Harp, March 08</p></br><a href="../users/A2FRKEXDXDN1KI.html">A2FRKEXDXDN1KI</a><br/><p>Violent, dark, gripping and an off-humor tone that is like no other.  `NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN' is indeed a Coen Brothers masterpiece!<br /><br />The film is possibly the most ambitious film from the Award winning filmmakers, Joel and Ethan Coen ("Fargo", "The Big Lebowski", "O Brother, Where Art Thou?", "Raising Arizona") based on the 2005 novel by Pulitzer Prize-winning author Cormac McCarthy.  "NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN" was nominated for eight Academy Awards and won four which include "Best Achievement in Directing", "Best Motion Picture of the Year", "Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role" and "Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published".<br /><br />"NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN" makes its re-appearance on Blu-ray with a new audio track, five hours of bonus footage and a digital copy.<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />"NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN" is featured in 1080p High Definition with an aspect ratio of (2:35:1).  One thing you will notice is how the colors of the rugged outdoors really pops.  The earth tones and its vibrancy during the day, to the dark black and blues during the night.  I saw no major artifacting or high grain during the low light conditions.<br /><br />Also, when you see the characters in High Definition, you see the wrinkles, the pores...very detailed picture quality.  Even the people who were shot and killed, good amount of detail in the bullet wounds and showcasing how much detail the crew went into making sure the these wounds look realistic.  There is no denying that the picture quality for "NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN" is amazing and right up there with the top tier titles.  The backgrounds of Southwest Texas, the multiple colors that showcase the vibrancy of the film, to the dark scenes that exhibit no problems and of course the overall details that you just never think of, are seen quite clearly on this title.<br /><br />Director of Photography Roger Deakins ("A Beautiful Mind", "O Brother, Where Art Thou?", "The Big Lebowski", "Fargo", "The Shawshank Redemption") continues to be one of the top DP's in the industry and was definitey deserving of an Academy Award nomination for his awesome cinematography.<br /><br />As for audio, this is where "NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN" takes a big step up to perfection.  Buena Vista Home Entertainment made sure the new soundtrack for this second version release utilized an English 5.1 DTS-HD (48 kHz/24-bit) track over the PCM version.  And boy, does it make a difference.  If you thought the gun shots as the bullets hiss, the rifle shots, a dogs being shot, vehicles moving, those action scenes alone sound clearer and punchier than the previous PCM track.  The dialogue is clear and there is just a sense of more clearer sound than the PCM track.  Quite frankly, this is the best audio treatment of the film and the last one was magnificent but for this 2-Disc Collector's Edition, audio is excellent!<br /><br />And again, the film was definitely deserving for its Academy Award nominations for its achievements in Sound and Sound Editing.  The crew did a wonderful job!<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />This second version Blu-ray release of "NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN" is packed with special features.  From December 2007 to February 2008, television, live, online and radio interviews are presented on disc.  So, the hardcore filmmaker or the fans of the film definitely have plenty of content to watch and listen to.  As mentioned earlier in the review, this 2-Disc Collector's Edition comes with a new audio track, a digital copy of the film and five hours of special features.  Included are:<br /><br />  * The Making Of No Country For Old Men - (24:29) A behind-the-scenes look at what it takes to create a Coen Brothers' movie.  Featuring interviews with the Coen Brothers, cast and crew.  Included on the last Blu-ray but nevertheless, very informative and entertaining to watch.  Also, how certain cast members were selected.  Surprising especially when you find out that Kelly Macdonald (Carla Jean) is from Scotland and has a strong, thick accent but played the character of a girl with a Southern drawl quite well!<br />  * Working with the Coens - (8:07) The cast and crew of No Country for Old Men talk about working with the legendary duo.  It's great to hear the cast and crew talk about working with the brothers and talk about how they want a certain scene a certain way.  Fun featurette that was included on the last Blu-ray.<br />  * The Diary of A Country Sheriff - (6 min.) A look at the relationship between Javier Bardem's Anton Chigurh and Josh Brolin's Llewelyn Moss through the eyes of Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones).  A good explanation of how this proud Sheriff who is about to retire notices that he probably is in no league to take on the crimes of today and the types of killers out there.  The days of being a sheriff with no weapons are a thing of the past.<br />  * Josh Brolin Unauthorized - (9 min.) An interesting perspective of "behind-the-scenes" as Josh Brolin interviews certain cast members and the crew.  A dramatic "behind-the-scenes" featuring the cast members with some sort of an edge.  A very interesting featurette.<br />  * Press Timeline - A treasure trove of in-depth interviews and conversations with the Coen Brothers, Tommy Lee Jones, Josh Brolin and Javier Bardem--never before available on disc--offering viewers the most comprehensive look ever at the making of No Country for Old Men.  This is where the bulk of the special features are featured and what's so cool is that some of these are online interviews, live with audience interviews, radio interviews, etc.<br /><br />  1.

The film has its many layers but I think that Javier Bardem's excellent portrayal of the psychopath Anton Chigurh is going to ruffle some feathers because of his overall look, his demeanor and his eyes of the thrill of a kill, you can't help but think how twisted this character is and for certain characters, who encounter Chigurh, you are at the edge of your seat as he wants to determine the fate if they live or die.  It's twisted and his means of killing and the barrage of violence is not going to make the squeamish any happier.<br /><br />This is possible the Coen Brothers darkest film.  Granted "Fargo" was a dark film but "NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN" is well-written, well-acted, well-filmed...it's the Coen Brothers masterpiece extravaganza.  Dark humor, violence galore but a well-told plot and characters that you want to watch.<br /><br />For me, the violence was excessive but it was needed.  It was very important to show Chigurh as this psychopath and the level of detail that went into showing those bloody scenes was well done by the crew.<br /><br />As the Coen Brothers and Javier Bardem did a wonderful job, you also have to give the thumbs up to the other talent.<br /><br />Josh Brolin being denied an Academy Award nomination was a bit of a shock.  Where many people have not been fortunate to get away from Chigurh, the character of Llewelyn Moss was a constant challenge but you actually felt yourself rooting for Moss for a little while.<br /><br />Tommy Lee Jones as Sheriff Bell was portrayed very well.  A World War II Vet and proud Sheriff who is now having to deal with drug deals and mafia style killings, he's not prepared to take on these type of people.  This is not the same country he lived in before, it's become dangerous and hence the title "NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN".<br /><br />I will have to say the shining star was Kelly MacDonald as Carla Jean.  At first, you think that the woman is the token broad at the beginning of the film but her final scenes perhaps is a scene that has left many people wondering what happened to her character.  It's because her character was able to do something that many of the other characters have not and thus, comes away being someone special.  And I also have to say that I was shocked to find out that Macdonald was Scottish and had this thick accent and to hear hear playing a woman with this Southern drawl was amazing.  Well done!<br /><br />Many people who purchased the first Blu-ray disc may be asking themselves, is this second collector's edition worth it?  Absolutely yes!  The new DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack is just amazing.  Combine that with already the perfect video, video and audio are just perfect.  The special features also gets a 5 with five hours of interview footage and in depth knowledge behind what the Coen Brothers wanted to accomplish in the film, to hear the talents (with the exception of Tommy Lee Jones) really show their passion towards this film and just very good insight of the making of the film.<br /><br />So, as much as I hate re-releases especially if they are not long after the previous was released, in this case, I have to say that the release of "NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN" was warranted.  For such an incredible and magnificent film, it deserved special treatment and now it does.<br /><br />"NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN - 2-DISC COLLECTOR'S EDITION" receives an A+ and is highly recommended!</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>In the stylish new Coen Brothers' movie, "No Country for Old Men," the violence is both graphic and coy, both in-your-face and strangely demur in the way it is portrayed.  Bit players are frequently blown away in full view of the audience, while key characters often meet their ends off screen, away from the spotlight of the prying camera.  For this is the theme of the movie, that violence is arbitrary, capricious and unpredictable, and that things are only going to get worse in a culture that has grown increasingly coarse and indifferent to human suffering over the years.<br /><br />The "old man" of the title is Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), a small town Texas sheriff who, right on the verge of retirement, has seen a depressing spike in violent crime thanks to the recent proliferation of drug-running from Mexico (the movie takes place in 1980).  For this is a "new time" in America, one in which an all-out criminal "war" is being fought, as much on the open plains as in the crowded cities.  It is the "old men" like Bell, the last in a long line of old style Texas lawmen, who can no longer recognize their country and who are left to recede into the background bewildered and frustrated by their inability to do anything about it.<br /><br />As the story opens, a group of men lie dead in a windswept field, victims of a drug deal gone terribly awry.  The perpetrator is a psychopath by the name of Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) who is now wandering the countryside on a random killing spree, dispatching human victims as casually as the rest of us would a mosquito or fly.  Llewellyn Moss (Josh Brolin) is a "retired" welder  who stumbles upon not only the carnage-strewn scene but a suitcase filled with millions of dollars in unmarked bills.  When Moss makes the fatal mistake of taking the loot, he becomes the prime target of Chigurh, who will stop at nothing to get what is rightfully his.<br /><br />Based on the novel by Cormac McCarthy, "No Country For Old Men" is less notable for its story and characters than for its cinematic naturalism and impressionistic style.  Despite having made some truly exceptional films in the past, Joel and Ethan Coen have never been as thoroughly in control of their medium or as supremely confident in their filmmaking as they are here.  The first hour, in particular, is such a flawless masterpiece of composition and tone that it will probably be studied as a model in film school courses for years to come.  Not since the films of Terrance Malick has landscape been used to more brilliant effect than in the opening section of this work.  The setting - so brilliantly captured in Roger Deakins' incisive cinematography and Craig Berkey`s stunning sound design - becomes a palpable presence in its own right and a key player in the drama.  The Coens have done their own editing on the film, which explains why the pacing feels like an exquisitely honed piece of music, built on finely calibrated beats and rests, meter and rhythm.  The hypnotic, dreamlike quality of the filmmaking carries the story into the realm of archetype and myth which matches perfectly the surrealistic nature of the piece.<br /><br />Bardem provides a bone-chilling portrait of a human killing-machine whose sole purpose in life is to destroy that which gets in his way (not that he doesn't enjoy killing just for the sheer pleasure of it as well).  In Bardem's hands, Chigurh becomes the true incarnation of evil in its darkest form.  Jones brings a world-weary gravity to the role of the sheriff, while Brolin, who gets the majority of the screen time in the film, does some of the best work of his career as the man desperate to keep one step ahead of his pursuer.<br /><br />Perhaps predictably, the movie is not able to sustain the same level of greatness all the way through its running time and there are moments when the filmmakers seem to lose their way somewhat (particularly when Woody Harrelson shows up as a comic-relief bounty hunter).  The unresolved ending may frustrate those who don't like any loose ends hanging around at the end of a story, but the inconclusiveness of the conclusion actually adds to the verisimilitude of the movie quite a bit.<br /><br />Still, even if the movie falters a bit towards the end, there's no denying that "No Country For Old Men" is one of the outstanding films of recent times.  In fact, that first hour or so is about as close to perfection as filmmaking is ever likely to get.</p></br><a href="../users/A2E3F04ZK7FG66.html">A2E3F04ZK7FG66</a><br/><p>I really loved this film, and for the content itself I give five stars. Lots of people complain about the quality of the film, specifically that they believe it to be uneven, but that is what the Coens usually do. You think you are going in one direction and then they venture off cinematically into a place you would have never guessed you were going. As for the extra features, most of them appear to be public domain stuff, certainly not material made to give more insight into the film.<br /><br />ABC "Popcorn" Video<br />Channel 4 News -- Joel And Ethan Coen Appearance<br />Lunch With David Poland -- IKLIPZ -- Javier Bardem And Josh Brolin Interview<br />WNBC Reel Talk With Lyons & Bailes -- Josh Brolin<br />LA WGAW Q & A Panel<br />Six Additional Audio Interviews<br />Josh Brolin's Unauthorized Behind-The-Scenes<br />Q & A With Joel And Ethan Coen, Roger Deakins And The Sound And Production Design Crews<br />Charlie Rose Featuring Joel And Ethan Coen, Josh Brolin And Javier Bardem<br />EW.com "Just A Minute...With Javier Bardem"<br />VARIETY Screening Series Q & A<br />Instore Appearance With Javier Bardem And Josh Brolin<br /><br />A collector's edition and still no commentary track.

The violence is graphic and unflinching and the actors in every role give a 5 star performance. My review will be based on a three part basis, they will be The Plot, The Characters and The Verdict, these should give you a fair overview of the film along with my personal opinion of the movie itself.<br /><br />The Plot: Llewelyn Moss is a disheveled Vietnam veteran who's looking for a break. While out doing his usual deer hunting he stumbles across a massacre site where a drug deal has gone awry and whatever happened at the deal it lead to the death of all men involved. While investigating the site he finds a case filled with $2 Million which he decides to steal the money in the hopes of a better life for him and his wife Carla. He knows that he can't just take the money and live a happy life so he tells Carla to go and live with her parents while he goes away for a while until the dust settles. Little did Llewelyn know the man who arranged the deal was a murderous psychopath called Chigurh, he's a man that is prepared to kill anyone who gets in his way or anyone who loses the flip of a coin. He carries around a cattle gun and a silenced shot gun for which he uses to create chaos and torment to everyone he encounters. This is one of the chases of its own as Llewelyn is always one step ahead of Chigurh but with Chigurh being an ex special-ops has his ex colleague, Wells on his. Sherif Bell is also a man on the trail of Moss but he's always two steps behind the two of them.<br /><br />The Characters: The superb portrayal of every character by every actor in this movie makes it truly superb and something memorable. The characters that stand out the most are that of Moss & Chigurh and I will discuss both these characters in this section.<br /><br />Llewelyn Moss: Played by Josh Brolin is one of those characters that you root for from the very beginning but there's a deep feeling in your stomach that you know the man is doomed. He's a shell of a man who seems to have simply given up on life up until that moment he finds the money, because he's found it and can see the potential in how it can improve the life of him and his wife he's determined to keep the money no matter who's after him.<br /><br />Chigurh: This is obviously the character that the whole movie revolves around, he's the venerable psychopath for whom nobody can explain his motives or his ideas. At the start of the movie we come to see him as simply a guy who likes to kill, then our minds are changed when we see him chasing Moss for the money and then our minds are changed again and we believe he may just like killing. When walking to a destination or when entering someone in conversation, he gives off this soulless chill that I can't really explain but once you watch the movie yourself you'll know what I mean. He's almost Frankenstein like in his movement, he shows no urgency or change in pace, he moves fluidly to the point of which when he bursts through doors and starts executing people you start to think. "How did he know they were there?" It's a truly superb performance by the relatively unknown actor Javier Bardem.<br /><br />The Verdict: I have to say at first I didn't understand this film and it became quite confusing. I wasn't sure who was chasing who and I really wasn't sure what the movie was all about, then it became apparent as to the whole story which only really starts to come together around the middle of the film. It baffles me though, that how a man can kill so many people in sometimes very brutal and loud ways can still stay a step ahead of the police. It's a great movie and has an intelligence to it that we very rarely see on the screen these days. It doesn't have dramatic explosions and it has no point with which it uses background music in order to add effect, this will have encouraged the actors to give an even better performance and let me tell you it worked superbly. You must buy this movie and enjoy it time after time after time as it really is something great and for the two hour runtime I think we can safely say it's a bit too short.</p></br><a href="../users/A9NCQGVV5W8N0.html">A9NCQGVV5W8N0</a><br/><p>As much as I hate to jump on any bandwagons, I have to concede that this is a magnificent film. Beautifully shot and brilliantly acted. I've read a couple of Cormac McCarthy's books - the one that this film is based on isn't one of them - and the Coen bros. perfectly capture his pared down, lyrical prose onscreen. Something I never would've thought possible. Much has been written about Javier Bardem's granite faced killer (although in fairness, to describe Anton Chigurh as granite-faced doesn't really do him justice: he looks like he's been hewn out of the side of Mount Rushmore) and its all true, it really is one of the greatest onscreen portrayals of a psychopath that you'll ever see; as convincing as Ben Kingsley's turn in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005UV33">Sexy Beast</a> and Brian Cox's turn in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008V5RP">Manhunter (Restored Director's Cut Divimax Edition)</a>, albeit in a completely different way. That said, its really wrong to single out just one performance because the ensemble cast are all note perfect. In fact, what you have here is a synergy of visuals, acting and direction that you rarely see coming out of American cinema in this day and age. I also absolutely adored the complete lack of a score. Its cinema which refuses to concede to the laws of genre or the insidious influence of a marketing demography that has ruined so much western cinema in the last thirty years. I'm not sure that I believe in cinematic perfection, but if I don't, this comes damn close.  Will you get anything out of it? Well, if you can't pick up on the unspoken undertones of threat that can occur in an apparently innocuous conversation between two men discussing the toss of a  coin, then probably not. If, however, you can see what's going on beneath the surface of things, you need to rent or buy it right now</p></br><a href="../users/A12IRGQLFE4EBA.html">A12IRGQLFE4EBA</a><br/><p>While disturbing, the story is a very basic one with good, solid acting and dialogue.  Nothing artsy, eloquent or subtle here... no happy ending either (be warned).</p></br><a href="../users/A3OEECMCM2T4KQ.html">A3OEECMCM2T4KQ</a><br/><p>Psychopathy has only been seriously studied since the last half of the 20th century to present day. A psychopath can be non-violent, persuasive, charming, and on the surface seemingly normal. Then, of course, there's the violent type, who will pursue, torture and murder anyone or anything that obstructs them from their focused goal. What the two types have in common, however, is a lack of true emotion and particularly, a conscience. In No Country for Old Men, adapted from the Cormac McCarthy novel, the character of Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) portrays the unyielding, unmerciful and ultimately dangerous psychopath with unqualified Realism. This is a film that will either shock you into disbelief or (as in my case) raise that pure terror that lies within us all - and as the novel and film ask, pure evil is among us and is unrelenting.<br /><br />On the surface this film could be categorised as just another bad-guy-good guy film, where, in the end, good triumphs over evil. But the message from the book and film is quite clear on this point: evil moves forward, inexorable and any sort of "rational" pleading with them or even an ample description of insanity is close to impossible. The quandary is that insanity by its very nature cannot be explained in rational terms.<br /><br />The plot is a simple one. A drug deal gone wrong; and an outsider comes along and grabs the money and runs. The point is, Llewellyn Moss, (Josh Brolin) is unrelenting as well, but does not really know what or whom he is dealing with. Brolin does an exceptional job in this film - a man with a mission, pursued by true evil.<br /><br />It is unusual for the Coen brothers to adapt a novel to film. However, anyone who has read the novel can see that the film faithfully followed the novel.<br /><br />I love all the Coen Brothers films as they all have an atmosphere, (even in their parody's) of true realism and a special view of the world.<br /><br />A film that deserved all the accolades it duly received.<br /><br />Excellent.</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>This movie reminded me of the Coen Brothers' first film, "Blood Simple" (1984). with its understated but quirky and violent characters, odd dialog and sudden brutality. It's an odd crime film, but that what's the Coen Brothers usually deliver us: odd and entertaining movies. Whether it's the "Best Picture Of The Year," I question, but I did find it fascinating. I liked it even more the second time.<br /><br />Many times the villain is the most interesting character in a movie, and I'd have to say that's the case here, too. Javier Bardem, a Spanish actor, plays "Anton Chigurh" and this guy is one strange dude, with an even-stranger weapon. Josh Brolin and Tommy Lee Jones are almost as intriguing. Brolin is "Llewelyn Moss," a guy out hunting one day and finds dirty money at a bloody crime scene, takes it, and is on the run from the crooks who own it. Jones is the local sheriff, "Ed Tom Bell," who actually tries to help Moss by grabbing him before the killers do. Ed Tom admits times sure have changed and deranged killers like "Anton" are totally unexplainable. To me, Jones is always a great actor to watch.<br /><br />The supporting actors in here are all good, too, and also quirky....just like the Coens like them (see "Fargo" for a good example).<br /><br />Another star of this film is cinematographer Roger Deakins, one of the best - if not the best - in the business. His work here really looks spectacular when viewed on Blu-Ray. This is one of the best Blu-Ray transfer I've seen.<br /><br />To me, though, the highlight of this film was the dialog. Man, there were some strange sentences uttered in here with some odd grammar and expressions thrown in. Early on, I put on the English subtitles so I wouldn't miss any of it, or misinterpret what everyone said. In other words, this was not only a fun movie to watch, but to hear. It was very suspenseful most of the way as this turns out to be a long cat-and-mouse chase story. That's usually entertaining to watch, and this is no exception.<br /><br />Are there flaws in here? Sure, a couple beauties, too.....but I've rambled on enough.</p></br><a href="../users/AHABFECTNE15I.html">AHABFECTNE15I</a><br/><p>Version: U.S.A / Miramax / Region A, B, C<br />Title: No Country For Old Men<br />Aspect ratio: 2.35:1<br />MPEG-4 AVC BD-50<br /><br />Running time: 2:02:10<br />Movie size: 28,65 GB<br />Disc size: 32,26 GB<br />Average video bit rate: 23.18 Mbps<br />LPCM 5.1 4608Kbps 16-bit English<br />DD AC3 5.1  640Kbps English<br /><br />Subtitles: English SDH / French / Spanish<br />Number of chapters: 22<br /><br />#The Making of No Country for Old Men (SD, 25 minutes)<br />#Diary of a Country Sheriff (SD, 7 minutes)<br />#Working with the Coens (SD, 8 minutes)<br />#Trailers (SD, 4 minutes)</p></br><a href="../users/A2OFSDJB3MVQ16.html">A2OFSDJB3MVQ16</a><br/><p>Like their debut film, "Blood Simple", this dark film noir is set in Texas but unlike that film the ending leaves you perturbed. Perhaps what they're saying by the ending is that evil will always persist in this world no matter what ends you do to eliminate it. Again, it's definitely a matter of intepretation but I found this film deserving of the Best Picture of the year at the Oscars.  The great Spanish actor Javier Badem deserved to win for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of pure evil and Josh Brolin gave a career making performance as the pursued. Also the breathtaking cinematography of Roger Deakins deserves mention and I will definitely re-see this film on Blu-ray. I guess what prevents me from giving this fine film a full 5 stars is of course, the ending but don't let that prevent you from seeing this excellent film. Perhaps the Coen's best film to date since "Fargo".</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>The only time I can remember a film deservedly won the Best Picture Oscar was when Return of the King won but that seemed more like a cumulative work than of the film itself (plus the fact it practically swept the whole night made it boring to watch). Ever since then we've had years where a film should've won or wasn't even nominated and we debate on whether the film is that good or if it was just a slow year. Crash is still a bad movie, most people forgot Chicago and Shakespeare in Love and I don't know anyone who watched the English Patient. No Country for Old Men, the latest winner, is a film where some say it was more than deserved while others thought it was well made but not the best but that's always the case huh?<br /><br />Texan Llewellyn Moss stumbles across the aftermath of a drug deal gone bad, with one left alive and a bag with around 2 million in it. Against better reason, he returns to give the survivor water but people catch on and are hot on his tail. Notable is Anton Chigurh, a cunning and quite psychopathic man with a silencer-equipped shotgun, a cattle gun and a detachment to his kills and maybe even a bit of pleasure. Trying to save Moss and catch Chigurh is Sheriff Bell who's finding it more harder to be a sheriff when a lot of the old values have seemingly disappeared.<br /><br />Last year, Martin Scorsese's The Departed won the big prize which I felt was more like an award for his whole career rather than the film itself. With the Coen Brothers, they have had a wildly varied career from hits (Fargo, Big Lebowski) to failures (Ladykillers or the decent Intolerable Cruelty) so a lot of people can say No Country is most likely their finest since Fargo or Lebowski but strangely No Country didn't sit well on the second and third viewing. Not that it isn't a finely made film, remarkably restrained and not as showy, but I felt the film didn't improve when I saw it again even though most films do the more you see it.<br /><br />The 3 leads do super jobs playing their roles from 2007's big hitter Josh Brolin who had no less than 4 prominent roles, Tommy Lee Jones and the Award winning Javier Bardem. The latter of whom probably portrays the most evil and chilling villain in some time with intelligence yet a complete resolve to kill all in its way, it's certainly worth the nod as well as the win (though I'm sad Casey Affleck didn't get it for Jesse James). The rest of the cast has Woody Harrelson who is somewhat unneeded and Trainspotting's Kelly McDonald playing Moss' wife.<br /><br />Where the film might be an issue for some is in its ending which is quite unresolved and leaves quite a few questions unanswered and one scene involving a cat lover that I didn't like and it becomes one of those films that becomes well known because of what ending it was rather than how it fitted with the story, even though the book had the same thing. Not that it's a bad ending but it's one where it kind of nags in your mind for its emptiness rather than its emotional impact.<br /><br />Not being entirely familiar with their oeuvre, I'd recommend No Country but then again just because it won doesn't mean everyone will love it.</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>All of us are well aware about the artistic trajectory of the Coen Brothers doen't obey to prefixed canons, somehow they represent for the American nation what Fassbinder for German, the voice of an ethic conscious.<br /><br />The graphic violence is just an excuse to get into the unsaid desperation of a handful of human beings who are living the golden ages, but told from a bitter perspective; the future of these people is full of clouds and uncertainness.<br /><br />Perhaps since the times of  midnight cowboy we had not witnessed a film burdened of so many questions without answers, a demolishing vision about the last stage of our life. A film that certainly will endure as one of the most nature and devastating among the great winners.<br /><br />Javier Bardem is terrific as the psychopath, who deliberately exterminates one by one (and specially to citizens of the third age) that may become an obstacle in his pursuit.</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>Before even watching the movie, one should take into account that on the surface, NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN should be a good movie.  The film is based upon a novel by Cormac McCarthy.  It's a Coen brothers' picture, meaning that Joel and Ethan Coen wrote, directed, edited, and co-produced the picture.  The cast is composed of mostly talented, though underrated actors, including Javier Bardem, Josh Brolin, and Tommy Lee Jones.  I realize that many times movies with similar credentials have been complete flops.  Thankfully, that isn't the case with NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN.<br /><br />The Coens return to the type of filmmaking, like that of BLOOD SIMPLE and FARGO, that gave them a following.  The film revolves around three very distinct and different characters.  First there is Llewellyn Moss (Josh Brolin) an everyman slacker. Despite his lack of ambition, his wife loves him and they have a good relationship. Llewellyn stumbles upon what appears to have been a shootout over a drug deal gone bad amidst a circle of vehicles in the back country.  Slaughtered bodies lie scattered across the field.  Llewellyn locates the apparent "survivor" of the massacre who lies dead beneath a tree along with a briefcase full of money.  Llewellyn gives in to the temptation and takes the money, thereby placing himself on the top of the list of Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), a murderous psychopath who sometimes decides the fate of his victims with the flip of a coin.<br /><br />Chigurh is the second focal character in the film.  Chigurh is another symbolic character that seems to represent everything that has gone wrong with the U.S.  He is a murderer and stops at nothing to get his way.  Yet, there is an almost twisted logic to some of his actions.  He never contradicts the coin he carries--it is his lord.  He also never breaks a promise; a trait that would be a good thing in most people, but a trait that becomes horrifying in psychopathic murderer.  Chigurh chases Llewellyn across the country with a ruthless abandon.  Along the way, Chigurh settles the score with other men that have crossed his path before.<br /><br />The final focal character is sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones).  Bell is on the verge of retirement.  His father was a lawman as was his father before him.  The world has changed dramatically since Bell was a young officer.  Violent crime and illegal drugs coming across the border are common occurrences.  Bell feels that he is the last of dying breed; the last of an old tradition. He has the nose of a detective and is chasing Chigurh and trying to catch the demon before he causes anymore violence, but he always seems to be just one step behind.  He doesn't realize it at the time, but his hunt to capture Chigurh is the last of his career before he retires to live in a place that truly is "no country for old men."<br /><br />I really enjoyed NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN.  The movie is serious, but has comical moments that relieve the tension.  The cinematography and settings are almost majestic in their simplicity and barrenness.  The acting is top of the line and Bardem, Brolin, and Jones each give great performances.  Even though there are no car chases, super powers, sword fights, or pirates, the film kept me on the edge of my seat as I tried to guess what was going to happen next, root for Llewellyn Moss to escape, and hope that Ed Tom Bell would meet Chigurh in a final showdown.<br /><br />I realize that even though I liked the film, there are many who won't.  NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN is a dark and depressing picture.  It offers no solace, no comfort, very little joy, and paints a picture of the future as being almost hopeless.  It also doesn't have a nice, tight ending.  I liked the film as a work of film, but when I left the theatre after seeing the movie for the first time, I was so saddened by what I had seen that I cried for a few minutes in my car.  Very few dark films have touched me like that.  NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN is without a doubt one of the best movies of 2007.  Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys well-crafted movies.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>In rural Texas, welder and hunter Llewelyn Moss discovers the remains of several drug runners who have all killed each other in an exchange gone violently wrong. Rather than report the discovery to the police, Moss decides to simply take the two million dollars present for himself. This puts the psychopathic killer, Anton Chigurh, on his trail as he dispassionately murders nearly every rival, bystander and even employer in his pursuit of his quarry and the money. As Moss desperately attempts to keep one step ahead, the blood from this hunt begins to flow behind him with relentlessly growing intensity as Chigurh closes in. Meanwhile, the laconic Sherrif Ed Tom Bell blithely oversees the investigation even as he struggles to face the sheer enormity of the crimes he is attempting to prevent. This movie is gut-wrenching, bleak, violent, super-tense and surprisingly funny in a darkly comic manner. Its brilliance and lasting impact will leave you haunted.</p></br><a href="../users/A38I00SO3D9ZSM.html">A38I00SO3D9ZSM</a><br/><p>If you haven't seen this movie, and you can stand a bit of violence, see it.  It's one of those films that only comes around maybe once a year or every few years that entertains and grabs you.  It's moving and powerful, but not in a sentimental way.  Western, noir, (dark) comedy, action/adventure: it straddles all those genres.  It's gritty and authentic without looking low budget or cheap.  There's not a mediocre acting performance in entire film.<br /><br />I won't spoil it anything, but some of its critics hate the ending.  I'll only say that I appreciate if for no other reason that it doesn't wrap up like most films do or even in a way you would hope or expect.  Avoiding cliches while giving something with which the audience can identify is tricky business, but the Coen brothers do just that.<br /><br />I've never read the book it's based on, but some credit must go to Cormac McCarthy for giving the Coens and the screenwriting team what could only have been great source material.<br /><br />I cannot recommend it highly enough!</p></br><a href="../users/A3I49HL6XR62DI.html">A3I49HL6XR62DI</a><br/><p>See this film; it deserved an Oscar. However, everyone is arguing about the ending with good reason. I am concerned that the ending of No Country seems to have been heavily edited -- in fact it is suspiciously non-violent compared with the rest of the film. I actually missed the demise of a major character and had to re-watch the ending on DVD to fully comprehend it. I suspect that there was more to the film's end and I hope that there is a director's cut sometime in the future. No Country also lacks a musical score -- prepare yourself as the silence is sometimes deafening.<br /><br />Kudos to the actors -- Bardim, Jones and Brolin. They are magnificent. However, the Coen brothers have been more creative in the past -- Fargo and O Brother Where Art Thou come to mind, among others. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009W5CA">Fargo (Special Edition)</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXRM">O Brother, Where Art Thou?</a>.<br /><br />As a West Texan, I must compliment the cinematography in No Country. It was stunning. If you are looking for another truly great film set in West Texas I recommend The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada directed by Tommy Lee Jones (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F8O2QU">The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada</a>. That film really captures the soul of this great region and the heart of its people. The Coen brothers were wise to cast Tommy Lee Jones in No Country as he truly belongs to West Texas.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UL0A8GJB4318.html">A2UL0A8GJB4318</a><br/><p>Lean, terse storytelling powers "No Country for Old Men."  Set against the barren, wind-swept desert of the west Texas plains, the Coen brothers latest film is an unflinching portrait of men destroying each other for petty gain and the decay of an American society that played a major part in molding their moral outlook.  Tommy Lee Jones, doing some of the most stupendous and subtle work of his career, acts as Sheriff Ed Tom Bell the world-weary narrator to the downward spiral of humanity.  Javier Bardem, to whom an oscar will be most assuredly be gift-wrapped, shuts down any hint of humanity to play Anton Chigurgh, a ghoulish, blood-chilling, drug-running enforcer who races across Texas to hunt down Lleywen Moss (Josh Brolin, so into character he almost becomes transparent), the unlucky cowboy who happened to take the wrong drug money at the wrong time.  The chase between Moss and Chigurgh is exciting enough, what with the Coen brothers pulling out all the stops to let the blood flow and bullets fly.  Try to remember to breathe when the two shoot it out in motel and around the surrounding township.  But it's the brothers sharply written script that digs in its hooks to extrapolate the plight of Moss and Chigurgh to the world at large, how their violent battles may just be systemic of bigger, deeper and more corrosive trends in American society.  "No Country for Old Men" is a tough film to watch, and not because of the ample, shocking violence; it's tough to watch because of what the violence means.  It's a triumph for the brothers Coen and one of the best films of the year.</p></br><a href="../users/A18758S1PUYIDT.html">A18758S1PUYIDT</a><br/><p>The whole time I was watching this in the theatre, the other viewers barely made a sound; we were all mesmerized by the story and characters.  This says a lot for the writer, directors, actors and others involved.  The film is not as quirky as the Coens' previous work, but then, it's not that kind of tale.  It almost plays out in some ways like a classic Western, but is set in 1980 and does not give us easy resolutions. For this reason, some will complain that the ending isn't satisfying because it does not tie up all loose ends, because the villain walks away, because so many others die even if they were innocent and weren't involved in any crimes.<br />  I found the ending quite refreshing, however.  This is not formula.  This is how things often happen in real life, which is messy and can cause a lot of disillusionment.<br />  This connects to the sheriff played by Tommy Lee Jones, who comes to realize that he cannot stop what is going to happen no matter what he does, and that he is no longer able to deal with the modern world, which is very different from the world he grew up in (apparently, everything went down the tubes when people stopped saying "sir" and "ma'am").  That's where the title comes from:  it's not a world that people of his generation can inhabit any longer, and the existential crisis and realization cause him to retire.<br />  On to the performances:  aside from the rock-solid Jones, we have Javier Bardem, the coolly eerie, unblinking psychopathic killer Anton Chigurh, who can kill with an oxygen tank without ever beating people over the head with it, but who tries to keep from stepping in blood.  And there is the superb Josh Brolin as Llewellyn Moss, a man who makes the fatal error of trying to take a large sum of money that he never should have touched in the first place.<br />  The almost complete lack of music during the movie contributes to the creepiness factor as well, as does the desolate yet somehow beautiful landscape.<br />  Look for nominations next year.</p></br><a href="../users/A2LXG7XUQNZO6E.html">A2LXG7XUQNZO6E</a><br/><p>I know all of you have heard the buzz, the praise and the gushing but, believe me, the film lives up to its reputation. This is, quite possibly, one of the best films The Coen Brothers have made and that's a bold statement indeed when you consider these are the guys that made Fargo. No Country for Old Men is a tense, nail-biting thriller that completely knocked the wind out of me on multiple occasions. All Oscar-winning performances aside, the originality of this film alone deserves to be seen.<br /><br />Oscar, Golden Globe & Goya Award winning actor Javier Bardem handed in an incredibly exciting (and terrifying) performance as the calm, collected and deeply disturbed Anton Chigurh and there's no doubt in my mind that we're going to continue seeing big things from him. Obviously Josh Brolin, Tommy Lee Jones and Woody Harrelson all turned in admirable performances as well but this is Bardem & Coen Country all the way.<br /><br />Its electrifying films like this, and creative filmmakers like The Coens, that really drive home the idea that American cinema was, is and always will be some of the greatest cinema out there.<br /><br />Folks, go purchase this; it's absolutely mesmerizing. The performances were stunning, the violence was unflinchingly brutal and the Coen's knack for dusty nu-Western crime is unparalleled. I not only highly recommend you watch this film but I also recommend purchasing it. In my opinion this is a classic.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VZLLDNLURGJB.html">A1VZLLDNLURGJB</a><br/><p>NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN was quite an experience to watch on my large screen HDTV and BLU-RAY DVD player. The movie itself was great and the video transfer outstanding.  This was clearly a visual film in the Stanley Kubric tradition.  As far as I was concerned the level of screen violence did not set any records, however, due to the way it was presented the effect this film had on me was devastating.<br /><br />"No Country for Old Men" is graphic and implied, both explicit and chillingly indirect. The smaller characters are often murdered on screen, while main characters meet their ends off.  The clear message is that violence is as arbitrary and unpredictable as the toss of a coin and as one writer has already said "things are only going to get worse..."  A coin toss often determined if the killer should or should not end a life.<br /><br />I found very chilling that the victim was made to select "heads or tails" to determine his fate. If you were lucky enough to correctly select the outcome of the coin toss, the killer would just hand you the coin possibly suggesting you save it and leave. I was glad when one of his victims refused him the pleasure of their selecting the coin toss, saying that they knew what they were in for the moment they entered the room. You must see this film to believe it. It is depressing to be sure, but I bet you can't take your eyes off the screen.  Just bring plenty of your favorite antidepressant.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>Vietnam veteran and current hunter Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin in a star making role) has a problem.  He's stumbled upon two million dollars in cash after finding the aftermath of a drug deal gone wrong, and soon enough finds himself hunted by the insanely calm, coin tossing Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem in his Oscar winning role) in 1980 Texas.  In the meantime, World War II vet Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) attempts to get to Moss and his wife (Kelly MacDonald) before Chigurh does, as the end comes sooner for some others, and the film offers shock after shock, with the Coen Brothers cementing their legacy for unconventional film making.  Possibly one of the most bleak Best Picture winners you'll ever see, the Coen Brothers' No Country for Old Men is a restrained, violent, and starkly poetic vision that could easily be considered a dark, modern-day western if nothing else.  What makes No Country for Old Men so good is the cast of the film, with Bardem and Brolin in particular giving finely nuanced performances, possibly the best of their careers.  Also featuring Woody Harrelson and Garret Dillahunt, No Country for Old Men is definitely not a film for everyone to be sure (as you can tell from reading the negative reviews here).  Those expecting a mainstream crowd pleaser here have certainly come to the wrong place.  However, saying that the film deserves a chance is an understatement, as movies like No Country for Old Men just don't see the light of day too often.  In that respect alone, the Coen Brothers' latest is a masterpiece of modern film making.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJIJKKN15KR9.html">A1TJIJKKN15KR9</a><br/><p>I hadn't seen this since it was in cinemas, and found that it's even better than I'd remembered. It's a very unusually-paced film, with a lot of long silences, seemingly-innocuous conversations and dangling plot threads that don't ultimately lead anywhere. In many instances that could make for some infuriating viewing, but in the Coen brothers' hands it all somehow comes together into a master tapestry. The word of the day is suspense, an emotion the brothers have excelled at in the past, and No Country is a glorious example of it at play. The film's three protagonists, retiring sheriff Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), stone-cold killer Chigurh (a terrifying, star-making turn for Javier Bardem) and land-living cowboy Moss (Josh Brolin), never actually meet face-to-face but the wake of ripples left in their dueling pursuits is enough to power several movies' worth of rich, intriguing material. Sweaty, intense action walks lockstep with outstanding characterization, top-notch dialog and a hearty dose of respect for the novel. Like many Coen classics, it gets better with each subsequent viewing.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KEZLJ59C1JVH.html">A3KEZLJ59C1JVH</a><br/><p>"No Country for Old Men" isn't a bad movie, but I really didn't think it was all that great. It isn't the Coen Brothers' best work, and I certainly don't think it deserved to beat out films like "Atonement" and "Michael Clayton" for the Academy Award for Best Picture.<br /><br />This movie, which is based on a Cormac McCarthy novel, is a modern-day western involving a Vietnam vet, Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin), who finds a case containing $2 million in the desert...surrounded by a bunch of dead bodies. Llewelyn opts to take the money and run, but unfortunately for him, a big, burly guy toting a cattle gun (Javier Bardem) is hot on his tail. The whole film basically revolves around this chase, with Llewelyn generally being one step ahead until the very end.<br /><br />I though the movie was interesting, and was especially impressed by Bardem's eerily calm performance. The film boasts a strong supporting cast, including Tommy Lee Jones and Kelly Macdonald, but none of them were brilliant enough to save this movie for me. The entire film is very slow-paced, and the ending is incredibly abrupt and thoroughly unsatisfying. I really expected more, and was ultimately disappointed.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>This film was a real treat and something that I wanted to watch for quite some time because I admire Javier Bardem as an actor. No Country for Old Men is a thriller that delivers brilliant levels of suspense, fear and apprehension whilst simultaneously disposing of the genre's preconceived conventions. The cinematography on show unashamedly harks back to the Coens debut Blood Simple (1983) and with their regular Cinematographer at the helm, Roger A. Deakins, it is no surprise that No Country for Old Men has been nominated for an Oscar in this category. The films score is so subtle that it aids the tension by unwittingly achieving an omnipotent silence recognizable only through an assortment of wind noises which have been superbly complemented by the bleak dialogue and dark humor.<br /><br />To complement the film further it should be noted that on show here are some of the most powerful and flawless performances for some time and Tommy Lee Jones's is purely outstanding. His character embodies a demeanor of pensive sadness beautifully portrayed by the veteran actor in what is conceivably his best role to date (shocking that he has not been nominated for an Oscar, but this could be due to a lack of screen presence) it should also be noted that the final reels of the film are probably among his best ever committed to celluloid. Javier Bardem's role as the relentless and ruthless psychotic killer is astounding, his on screen presence mesmerizing and his mere appearance a pure treat along with a sense of a darkness casting over the whole room and it really makes you feel like you are in the presence of true evil. When it comes to playing a psychotic I would go so far to say that his performance has only ever been equaled by Anthony Hopkins portrayal of Hannibal Lector and maybe in years to come,<br /><br />I would like to point out that there is little to no music in the entire film which is a plus to me. The use of silence throughout the majority of the movie is very original in the sense that the music doesn't cue the viewer how to react and when.<br /><br />So again, not for everyone, but if you are a frequent movie goer and truly understand the makings of a good film, this is an excellent one to see.<br /><br />I hope you enjoy this movie as much as I did...it's undeniably worth your time.</p></br><a href="../users/AZCDCO6KK2T81.html">AZCDCO6KK2T81</a><br/><p>I'm sorry, but I just don't get all the hype about these directors/writers and their films, especially this one.<br /><br />I found this film to be very uneven.  The cast is excellent and compelling to watch from start to finish, but the story is all over the place.  The first half is outstandingly well-paced and delivered, but the second half seems to be directed/written by others as it is noticeably different.  It pales in comparison to the first half.  I wish I could express better HOW this is so, but that is hard.  I just simply found myself no caring about the storyline much and a good thing since the ending is a complete clunker.<br /><br />I have to say that I was very disappointed with the extreme unevenness of this film, but it is good overall.  Nowhere near all the hype, but generally good.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>Somewhere right around the 90 minute mark of No Country for Old Men, the movie went from classic to great, but by the end of the movie it goes from great to good. That--in my book--is a collapse.<br /><br />It's almost like the Coen brothers found something better to do after making 3/4 of the film then rushed through the last 30 minutes. Anyone seeing the movie will know the exact moment that I'm referring to; it's the scene where Josh Brolin gets into a brief flirtatious conversation with a woman at a motel pool.<br /><br />The movie is absolutely brilliant up until the aforementioned point. You have a hunter (Brolin) that becomes hunted after stumbling upon a lot of money from what is apparently a very big drug deal gone wrong. The owners of the money hire a ruthless killer (Javier Bardem) to track down the hunter, and a local sheriff (Tommy Lee Jones) tries to put it all together.<br /><br />During the first 90 minutes you'll be on the edge of your seat while detail after detail is played out in a cat and mouse thriller that gives the perspective of the hunter and the hunted. You'll be thoroughly entertained. You'll be shocked. You'll be engrossed. Then comes the pool scene which is the start of the antithesis of all of the adjectives that I just used.<br /><br />The last 30 minutes seem forced together...rushed. It's not that the movie ends too abruptly; it's that the detail that was included in the first 90 minutes goes out the window. The movie just gets odd.<br /><br />So I'm very surprised at all of the unwavering praise, acclaim and awards that have been thrown at No Country for Old Men. A brilliant 3/4 plus a strange, "wait-what-just-happened-there?" finale = good movie. Not great. Certainly not classic. Just good.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R8PXSFGY9MC2.html">A3R8PXSFGY9MC2</a><br/><p>I want to start by saying `No Country For Old Men' has one of the most menacing bad guys of the many films that I have seen. He is mostly eerily silent and when he does talk it is quietly and controlled, he is ruthless, unrelenting and with an almost psychopathic element to his nature. This alone would make for compelling viewing before you add in the storyline of the film. From the word go this film has a dark and brooding atmosphere to it and the tension is palpable and only builds as it progresses. Following one man who stumbles across a case full of money, another trying to track him down and the sheriff who is trying to protect and serve, provides the hunter and hunted plot that keeps you fully engrossed. This has amazing performances from all involved, Brolin, Lee-Jones and Bardem are all riveting to watch and this is probably Tommy Lee-Jones' best performance to date. You get the added bonus of Woody Harrelson in a minor role and yet he still manages to deliver another top job as he always does. At just under two hours this film isn't excessively long and I found myself intrigued and on edge the whole time. The ending kind of fizzled out after ratcheting up the tension (hence the four stars) but overall this makes for satisfying viewing. This is one of those films on Amazon that seems to be either loved or hated and it has to be said that it's not your Hollywood, all action blockbuster, but it's all the better for that. If you like well acted, slow burning, beautifully directed and tension filled films, then this is the place to go. Well worth a viewing.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DRKVXO300RUE.html">A1DRKVXO300RUE</a><br/><p>By far the best Cohen film ever, and that's saying a lot.  This movie is glorious.  The Javier Bardem character is fantastic; his cool efficiency is very impressive.  I particularly like the gas station scene - great interaction with manager guy.  The dialog throughout is very good, the tempo is great, sense of dread, etc. Note, though, this is a good degree of a cerebral film, not your standard killer fare.  Lots of mood setting, slowly building events, etc.  Brilliant though.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FMJJKSVQDDQ.html">A1FMJJKSVQDDQ</a><br/><p>No Country for Old Men deserved the oscars for Best Director(s) and Best Picture. It has quickly become one of my favorite suspense films after a second viewing. I especially got a kick at all of the symbolic visuals and dialogue that are very significant especially in modern society; this is one of the few films of 2007 that really makes us think. It almost acts as a film by Stanley Kubrick, because it's so distinctive and different from many films made in 2007.<br /><br />Some people (teens in particular) may find themselves hating this film because it has a very ponderous pace and an anticlimactic ending. Well, these two things didn't bother me. They fit very well in this movie. The slow flow of the film adds to the suspense between the three major characters: Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Lee Jones), Anton Chigurh (Bardem), and Llewelyn Moss (Brolin). All three never actually meet each other in person, but each play the most significant roles in the film. Chigurh is not your typical antagonist: he knows how to get what he wants. His biggest challenge, however, is recovering a suitcase of two million dollars from animal hunter Moss. Moss decides to keep the money, but many catastrophic things happen as Chigurh ever comes closer to what he desires. Ed Tom Bell is what you call the "bystander," in which he becomes part of the investigation and comments on what has just happened in front of him.<br /><br />I'm not particulary interested in the works by the Coen Brothers, but this, along with Fargo, is the best that I've seen from the two. The acting is perfect (Bardem as Chigurh still scares me after repeated vieweings), the pacing is perfect (sometimes slow is good), and the very minimal use of music is quite effective. The blood and gore is rather heavy in some parts, so you have been warned. It's now one of my top favorite films (alongside The Godfather Saga, Burton's 1989 Batman, every Kubrick flim that's ever made, and so much more).<br /><br />Grade: A+</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />No Country for Old Men is much better as a straightforward thiller (the scenes with Josh Brolin and Javier Bardem are electrifying) than as an elegaic comment on man's nature (the scenes with Tommy Lee Jones crawl) and I expect a little bit more from a Best Picture winner than a character who only exists to advance the plot (Woody Harrelson); it's a good film but not a great one.</p></br><a href="../users/A25KKXUQQ0OLWB.html">A25KKXUQQ0OLWB</a><br/><p>The Coen Brothers create another film that passes the threshold for greatness once again.  This time with an undisputed Oscar.  Tommy Lee Jones gives one of his greatest performances ever as a quiet West Texas sheriff feeling out gunned and in a more violent world than he ever imagined possible.  A man played by Javier Bardem travels the area as a unrepentant murderer while others try to win money and drugs in a Texas/Mexican horror.  The movie is similar to Blood Simple in that few characters beyond Tommy Lee and his wife have any moral feeling or backbone. The good doesn't win and the bad seems endless, no one does the right thing.  An upsetting movie but a great one.</p></br><a href="../users/A1HG2DOSBZEX4I.html">A1HG2DOSBZEX4I</a><br/><p>The Coen Brothers have without a doubt created one of the best films of 2007. No Country For Old Men is one of those rare films that pulls its viewers in and makes them think about what they have seen when the film is over.<br /><br />One of the questions I have about the film is into just what genre does it fall. It could be called a thriller, it could be called a modern western it may also fit as extremely dark comedy. The film has some of the best lines I have heard in a film in many years. If I had to place the film in a niche I would call it a reflection on the randomness of violence and its aftermath. The film is also an analysis on the new trends and types of violence that are emerging in modern America.<br /><br />The film follows the arcs of its three main characters. Moss (Josh Brolin) is a welder and Vietnam veteren living in Texas who comes upon a grim crime scene in the desert involving a drug deal gone wrong. Anton Chirgurh (Javier Bardem) is a phychopathic killer after Moss to recover the money found at the crinme scene. Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) is an aging lawman who does not understand or like how the world is changing around him.<br /><br />I will not go into details of the plot because this is one of thoses films that must be seen to be truly appreciated. It is enough to know that the Coen Brothers (working from their own adaptation of the Cormac McCarthy novel) twist the suspense to a level that Hitchcock would have been proud of. The cinematography by Roger Deakins shows off the Texas desrt perfectly.<br /><br />The Bluray disc has very few special features. Included is a 24 minute making of feature and two shorter features dealing with working with the Coen Brothers.<br /><br />This film should not be missed.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LBAC84TLIGAX.html">A1LBAC84TLIGAX</a><br/><p>I enjoyed No Country For Old Men, it was an entertaining and compelling film, but it was flawed at the same time. So, I would have to disagree with Roger Ebert's proclamation that this film is flawless. This film has a lot to offer to people who have a dedicated taste in movies and who don't get bored easily.<br />WHAT IT'S ABOUT: A drug deal in Texas goes sour, drug dealers end up dead. Then a man discovers the crime scene, and takes some things he shouldn't have (Some guns and $2 million in drug money). After he takes this money he sets off a deadly game of kill-or-be-killed when the killer comes back for the money and discovers it's gone. He hunts the man who took the money and won't let up, and even kills anyone who gets in his way to finding this man.<br />MUSIC: There is no music, it's like watching an Albert Hitchcock film. This is one of the reasons I find the movie to be flawed is the complete absence of music.<br />ACTION: This film can be suspenseful, bloody, and just downright violent. There are quite of few shooting scenes as well, which adds to great action.<br />ENTERTAINMENT: Usually this film is quite entertaining, but sometimes the dialogue goes on for toooo long (The coin toss scene is the biggest one). This film has its share of satisfying, suspenseful, and surprising moments of violence, but then I can't help but get pissed at the terrible ending (You don't end a movie like that, dammit!). You will enjoy this film if you have fairly decent taste in movies, but be warned of the long dialogue and bad ending.<br />OVERALL: If you're not sure about it, rent it first. This film caters to more specific tastes in movies, so be warned.<br />THE GOOD: Good bloody action, suspenseful scenes, and quite a few surprising moments.<br />THE BAD: Awful ending, no music.</p></br><a href="../users/A1F2EYORWOZ3G1.html">A1F2EYORWOZ3G1</a><br/><p>I watched the movie, never read the book, heard the hype and read other reviews. I have to say I am very disappointed in this film. It was great until the last 5 minutes. Then it just.... wandered off to nowhere. No closure, no real ending. Did they leave it open for a sequel? Are they going to create serial killer serial films? That is the only thing that makes sense with this ending.<br />The acting is very good. The cinematography is great. The sounds are great. The plot is good... until the end.<br />I would recommend this movie only if you have 2 hours of time to waste... and remember you won't get it back.<br />The coen brother have done other great films. 'Blood Simple', 'Fargo' and 'Miller's Crossing' come to mind immediately and each of those is superb.

At the beginning of the film sheriff Ed Tom Bell (played by Tommy Lee Jones) reflects that he has been the county sheriff since he was twenty-five, and had followed in the footsteps of both his father and grandfather who were law men. But times had changed, and "the rise of crime you see now, it's hard to take its measure." The rest of the film demonstrates that point. The simple plot is almost a mere ploy for the Coens's study of human nature-- Llewelyn Moss stumbles upon a pickup full of heroin, slaughtered bodies, and a stash of $2 million. Trying to keep the money was a bad mistake, as the remorseless psychopath and ultra creepy killer Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) wants it back. But does he kill by choice or by chance? People always object to him, "you don't have to do this." He likes to flip a quarter and force his victims to choose. Fate and human freedom loom large for the Coens. The west Texas scenery and the absence of any music add to the suspense. Nor does the film end in any neat and tidy way, only Tommy Lee Jones reflecting on the disturbing dreams he started having after he retired feeling like justice did not prevail.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KFBAPAKMEQUF.html">A1KFBAPAKMEQUF</a><br/><p>Was a little over the top with the violence.

This may be the one movie where Woody Harrelson doesn't steal the show and every scene he is in. I truly enjoyed every second of this movie and I know I will see it many more times.

It is a violent and rugged movie about the world of drugs and money.  What this movie is; however, is an incredibly well-acted and absorbing film.  There is rarely a suspense-free or tension-less moment.  The movie, featuring excellent direction by the Cohen brothers, stars Josh Brolin, Tommy Lee Jones, and the downright spooky Javier Bardem.  Woody Harrelson is also one of the stars.  There is no need to spend time discussing the plot as that has been done several times already.  This movie is worth seeing for the fine acting and directing, as well as the gritty realism of Texas and Mexico.  The three primary actors - Brolin, Bardem, and Jones - are each excellent.  I expect that we will see a lot more of Brolin.  This movie is not for everyone, but for those looking for a great movie with great acting, I highly recommend this 4 star film.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ01Q3070LT29.html">AQ01Q3070LT29</a><br/><p>I saw the previews for this film when I went to see Saw 4. So it really put me in a scared mood already. What intrigued me about this film is it had big name stars in it, so yes, I did pay money to go see this big-budget film in a movie theatre.<br />  This film is for adults. It does contain grisly, bloody violence.<br />  There is a serial killer roaming Texas. His name is Anton Chigurh.<br />  Llewelyn Moss is an ex-wielder who is hunting antelope in the desert. He shoots one, but it escapes. He follows a blood path that leads him to a hurt black pit bull dog. He comes across in the canyon looking from above, several trucks with dead bodies nearby. He goes down there to investigate.  One clue leads to another and ultimately he finds the briefcase full of drug money.<br />  He goes home to his wife (Kelly MacDonald), but is still perturbed by what he saw in the desert. Not able to sleep, he goes back out to the area of the crime.<br />  Suddenly the hunter becomes the hunted. The killer, Anton, has found him.  He is after the briefcase of money and Llewelyn. It becomes a dangerous game of cat & mouse as Llewelyn Moss travels around Texas as the psychopathic killer closes in on him and kills nearly everyone he comes in contact with as he explains, like a coin being passed around for years.  Sheriff Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) is also on the trail for the killer.<br /><br />Also in the cast: Garret Dillahunt, Eduardo Antonio Garcia, Gene Jones, Woody Harrelson, Barry Corbin, Marc Miles.<br /><br />Filmed in Eagle Pass, Texas. Marfa, Texas. Las Vegas, New Mexico.<br /><br />The well-known stars of this movie really make this film watchable. If after seeing this film, you are still disturbed, just keep in mind, this story was set in 1980 and the way the killer gets into a room and the way he gets away unseen, probably could not happen in real life. The character has left behind so many clues, in real-life he would be stopped and caught.<br /><br />You know when Tommy Lee Jones is in a film, it is going to be a good one.<br />  Javier Bardem is in such an unusual role that as the killer, but is a likeable actor and has done good roles in the past. Bravo to Javier Bardem for traveling to America and in Texas of all places to film this movie.  Josh Brolin also gives a fine performance and makes it easy to follow him throughout the film. You want more.<br /><br /> The entire film has been well-cast, even the smaller roles had just the right actors, especially Gene Jones as the gas station proprietor who gives an unforgetable and memorable performance.<br />  This rated "R" film is abit hard on the eyes sometimes as the murders and bodies are grisly.  However, the film does generously pull back from the violence as the film progresses to give you a breather and leaving some murders left to imagination, thank you very much.<br /><br />  I am positive this film will be heavily edited for broadcast television showing. The DVD version will most likely be a popular one and hopefully will include additional scenes.<br /><br />Running time: 2 hours, 3 min.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VIOCJZ22JZXT.html">A3VIOCJZ22JZXT</a><br/><p>The powerful novels of Cormac McCarthy may lend themselves to interpretation on film and No Country for Old Men has been successfully translated by the Coen brothers and is a superb work of art in its own right. In an interview in a recent magazine, McCarthy indicated he was pleased with the translation of his novel into a film, saying that the film captured the novel.  The direct, bleak, no frills dialogue that is a characteristic of McCarthy's novels is captured in the dialogue in the film.  Both the novel and the film are disturbing, not only for violent content but also for the philosophical underpinning of the novel and film. As the literary critic Harold Bloom notes, the violence in McCarthy's work is not gratuitous, but plays and essential role in the underlying message and theme of the work. I hope to focus on this underlying philosophy in this review.<br />The story is that of an everyman, a self contained competent American male against forces that are overpowering even for his rugged native ingenuity. Llewelyn Moss, played superbly by Josh Brolin, discovers where a drug deal gone bad has left all parties (both men an dogs) dead on the field, with neither the money or the drugs taken away. He finds 2 million dollars in payoff money and takes it. However, he violates a basic premise, often explored in the novels of John Bowles, that he should follow his instincts and never second guess himself in such a risky situation. Llewelyn is troubled by the cry of a dying Mexican drug dealer for water and so he fills up an empty milk jug and goes back to the scene of the crimes to give he man water. What a mistake this is and what a price he pays.  He is soon pursued by a paid killer, Chigurh, played perfectly by Javier Bardem. He sends his wife to his mother-in-law's home and tries to escape the, and embarks on an escape, leaving his wife Carla (Kelly Macdonald) to escape the pursuit of Chigurh.  Because of the string of killings, Chigurh is being tracked by the local sheriff, played by Tommy Lee Jones. The sheriff becomes somewhat of a narrator and commentator upon the events as they unfold. Chigurh is also followed by a hitman, played by Woody Harrelson, who works for one of the criminal parties left empty handed after the desert shoot out.  Much terror follows, making for an intense and suspenseful film that will keep viewers on the edge of their seats.<br />But who and what is Chigurh?  Many, in fact the majority, of reviewers see him as a homicidal maniac, as insane, a psychopathic murderer. But he is more than that. He appears in other McCarthy novels as other similar characters. The most obvious is Judge Holden in the frightening novel Blood Meridian. As Harold Bloom points out, this character is also that of Achilles in The Iliad by Homer. He is the embodiment of the dark animalistic homicidal nature of mankind which like tornadoes and earthquakes and hurricanes, is part of nature, is a force of nature, is often unavoidable, and which follows the rules of natural forces and not the rules of man. He also follows the rules of chance rather than the rules of man, as evidenced by his use of a flip of a coin to determine who may live or die.<br />It is the worn-out and wise Sherriff that senses this in his pursuit of the killer Chigurh and his gathering of the endless clues that point to both the brutality and cruelty of Chigurh. The Sherriff has a dialogue with an estranged relative about the death of one of their ancestors, a lawman, who is killed in the line of duty. The comments of the Sherriff and his dialogue with family members and colleagues, reveals his philosophy that this evil force will burn itself out, reach some point of conclusion, and will move away. This is a very different view of how evil should be dealt with in Western, and specifically American culture, where we must fight evil until the bitter end rather than seeing evil as a storm that will one day move on. The strength of the film is absolute fidelity to this philosophy on the nature of evil.<br />With a compelling story, superb acting, penetrating dialogue, and the ability to challenge thoughtful viewer's preconceived notions, this film is excellent.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HW33PQSRHLNO.html">A2HW33PQSRHLNO</a><br/><p>Joel and Ethan Coen have proven, as filmmakers sometimes do, that Hollywood has not entirely degenerated into FX effects, big name actors doing precisely nothing, and huge amounts of money which would have been better used feeding hungry children.  (See "Live Free or Die Hard" for the kind of thing I'm talking about.)<br /><br />Based on the equally grisly novel by Cormac McCarthy, "No Country" is essentially meditation on evil and the way in which evil slowly corrodes the human soul through intimidation, fear, apprehension, and last but not least:resignation.  It is also a thinly disguised commentary on the impotence of authority to protect us from phenomena which arises from the worst of human instincts.<br /><br />Nearly every scene in this film is rich with symbolism, angst, and a sense that things could go horribly wrong at any moment in a huge tide of slaughtered innocence.  Each character represents a piece of the American landscape which, in the present time, has become obsolete.  Josh Brolin's Moss, clearly a cowboy of the classic Bonanza/Western variety, finds that his ethics no longer apply when he comes into conflict with Chiggurh, played by Javier Bardem in one of the best performances I have ever seen in any movie, who embodies the evil and meaninglessness lurking somewhere within us all.  He resembles some kind of bow legged Frankenstein, lurking across the Mexican landscape with his emphysema tank resembling cattle gun, killing sometimes for pleasure and sometimes for principle, taking everything he wants; not so much because he's pursuing the money Moss has as his thorough enjoyment of the entire affair.  Bardem manages to make his voice a grating, terrifying rasp, as though Darth Vader picked up a crack habit and decided to return an re-join the Emperor.<br />Pretty much everyone who comes in his path dies quickly; his coin toss is the only possible salvation, and even that seems tenuous.  If he wants you to die, you do, no matter how much you resist, flee, or hire other people to protect you.  Though it is clear that Chiggurh is human (I wasn't sure until he bled) I have no doubt that the Coen's use him as a metaphor for the absurd ways in which we flee from the inevitable.  Moss goes from hotel to hotel, jumps across national borders, hides in hospitals, and none of it is of any consequence.  You could very safely interpret this film as a very stark reminder that whatever we do, however far we flee, oblivion cannot be avoided, and neither can our humanity.  First Brolin's Moss, after tangling with Chiggurh for awhile and nearly dying as a result, stumbles across three youths walking near the New Mexico border; they ask him if he was in a car accident, and he uses a bloodstained dollar bill to buy a coat from one of them.  Chiggurh does the same thing (with two younger men riding on bikes) at the end of the film, when we finally get to see him bleed a little bit; he uses a similar bloody dollar bill.  The first three youths are eager for the money, and the second group consider it unethical to take money from a man who "has a f**king bone sticking out of his arm".  Hushing up corruption and pain with money, all of it somehow soaked in the blood of another, becomes easier with age.<br /><br />Tommy Lee Jones is perhaps the most "normal" of all the characters in the film, and we slowly discover that he is going to make absolutely no difference in Moss' fate or the fate of his wife.  He has seen too much gratuitous evil, and he is sick of being involved or even trying.  For all that he has some of the best lines in the film, lecturing the younger sherrif about what he's in for.  They both seem like fossilized relics from a time long past when things made sense and they could keep track of the blood.<br /><br />"No Country For Old Men" is a wake up call of sorts, but for all the questions the Coen brother raise they offer very few answers; perhaps because in the worldly sense there really aren't any.  The death of Carlo Jean and the narrow survival of Chiggurh clinches it: salvation is elusive or even absent in this world. The film left me with such a palpable feeling of nihilism and evil that I could almost taste it; for all that, it was also thought provoking, and simply the best movie I have seen in years.</p></br><a href="../users/A3PCTD8QM1BIXI.html">A3PCTD8QM1BIXI</a><br/><p>Other than Rasing Arizona & The Big Lebowski I never been a Coen Brothers fan as I think they are highly over rated. After seeing the abysmall The Ladykillers I vowed never to see another Coen Brothers film, however due to all the postive buzz I decided to give No Country For Old Men a try and I was impressed. Josh Brolin who deserved a Oscar nod for his role in Amercian Gangster shines as Llewelyn Moss as a vietnam veteran who stumbles upon the aftermath of a drugs deal gone wrong in the desert. Watching the film made me recall various Greek tradegy that I read in high school, espically when Javier Bardem as Anton Chigurh comes into play. The purusut of Llewlyn by Anton is a nail biting cat & mouse that kept my attention. I think the film deserved all the Oscars it won and I'd love to see what Javier Bardem can do in a big budget action film as a dirty cop.

Brolin and Lee Jones give excellent performances as the sympathetic characters, as do Kelly Macdonald and Woody Harrelson (as the two more prolific supporting actors in the piece), but the show belongs wholly to Javier Bardem, whose studied, intense portrayal of Anton is absolutely terrifying and totally absorbing.<br /><br />Direction is superlative: beautiful to watch, effectively tense and very layered; the Coen-brand intelligence is never more palpable when you consider the parallels between the characters of Anton and Llewelyn, and then see the visual motifs of isolation and seclusion that the Coens use to underscore this most bizarre of relationships (deserted streets, darkened motel rooms, arid deserts and so forth).<br /><br />From a storytelling point of view, things don't begin to make sense for a half an hour or so, cleverly allowing Brolin, Bardem and Lee Jones ample time to make their presence felt - another clever touch, and one that adds more punch and muscle to this film's character-driven atmosphere.<br /><br />And then, just when you're absolutely certain that you've been treated to two hours of the finest cinema to come out of North America for a long time, the ending jumps on you and you're left with more questions than answers: this plot device is fine for a sense of ambiguity and moral questioning, but this reviewer can't help but wonder if "No Country For Old Men" wouldn't have been more satisfying with slightly more resolution?<br /><br />Still, for all that, this is a brutal and brilliant masterpiece, and one which you absolutely  shouldn't not see.

A deputy is attacked by a prisoner who gets away to kill a man. Another man hunts antelopes and sees a group of cars with dead bodies around them! A pickup truck there is filled with packages. He sees a dying lone man with a satchel full of $100 bills. A drug deal gone bad? He leaves with the satchel of money and returns home to his wife. After dark he returns to the crime scene. [A fatal mistake?] He is chased by men and a vicious dog. He runs away, then shoots the dog. A customer talks to a store owner on strange topics. At night men look over a car. The law is on the trail of a killer, and finds the drug deal scene with the bodies. The killer visits the trailer park to look for Llewelyn. So does the Sheriff. Moss looks for a place to hide that satchel - in an air conditioning duct! Telephone records leave a backtrail.<br /><br />That entry wound in the forehead left no bullet! Moss buys a shotgun, then returns to the motel. An electronic device is used to locate that satchel! [A lesson in found treasure?] But Moss escapes. A man is hired to search for that killer. Moss searches the satchel and finds that device. But someone is still on his trail! There is a silenced shooting. Night time shooting does not cause an alarm? Moss dumps that satchel by the border, then crosses the border to find a doctor. That killer stages an explosion so he can loot a pharmacy and steal medicine and supplies to treat wounds. Mr. Wells finds Moss in a hospital and bargains for the money; he warns him about that killer. The sheriff talks to Mrs. Moss about her husband. The killer finds Mr. Wells in his hotel and talks for a while. The killer knows where Moss is, and asks for the money.<br /><br />Crimes are detected when something happens to attract attention. Moss continues to hold on to that satchel. A friendly stranger helps an old woman with her suitcases. A man stops to help a stranded motorist. [It's the law in some states.] The Sheriff finds Moss at the motel after others have found him. He visits an old man to talk about quitting. Mrs. Moss finds an uninvited visitor in her home. He flips a coin, and leaves. There is an accident at a stoplight. The killer walks away, his arm in a sling. The Sheriff talks to his wife about his past life; he is now retired. And then the film ends!<br /><br />What happened to the rest of the story? Until this it was better than earlier Coen Bros. products because it was adapted from a successful novel. Do the Coen Bros. have a fatal flaw that prevents them from making a good product?<br /><br />This is a story about a chase for unearned wealth, like "The Maltese Falcon" but without the happy ending. There is a coldness to this story and its characters that seems unusual. Note the phrase "last man standing" in the beginning. Does this movie have any redeeming social value? The fatal flaw of Llewelyn was taking a satchel of money that didn't belong to him, and not reporting the dead bodies to the police. It brought grief and misery instead of promised joy. Then, he went back to that crime scene and got identified by the other criminals (who must have had night vision binoculars).</p></br><a href="../users/A2JTD6D79HNA5X.html">A2JTD6D79HNA5X</a><br/><p>I'm reading the book right now so it's fun to compare.

("Blood Simple" and "Fargo," natch.) Though the Coens' films have largely managed to entertain over the past 13 years, the post-"Fargo" era has virtually never achieved the manic brilliance of their first dozen years, and the Coens have inched closer towards becoming the sort of artists that their early critics always claimed they were. (All flash and irony, no humanity.) Interestingly enough, the notoriously idiosyncratic frauteurs revived their stalling careers by saddling their own tendencies and faithfully recreating the work of another prominent artist. This is not to say the Coens have totally excised their own sensibilities, but they have nevertheless produced a work that is impressively faithful to Cormac McCarthy's driven, brutal novel. Though it is impossible to translate McCarthy's florid, allusive prose to the screen, this cinematic adaptation still mirrors the emphasis on texture found therein, and contains as controlled and deliberate a visual style as any thriller. Make no mistake, though few will deny that "No Country For Old Men" displays greater philosophical depth than the average thriller, it is on the purely dramatic level that the film most shines. In short, this is perhaps the best thriller of the past decade, and mandatory viewing for anyone evenly remotely interested in film.<br /><br />Like many classically styled thrillers, "No Country For Old Men" opens with a fairly straightforward premise which is steadily complicated: Shortly after discovering the murderous capabilities of the enigmatic mercenary Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), we are introduced to Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) a Texan good ol' boy who stumbles on a cache of heroin along with nearly $2,000,000 from a drug deal turned bloodbath. After absconding with the cash, however, Moss's guilty conscience causes him to return to the scene to assist a dying man, where he is assailed by some cartel members. With his identity uncovered, Moss must leave behind his young wife Carla Jean (Kelly Macdonald) and flee with both the cartels and the mysterious Chigurh on his trail, while the local sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) attempts to neutralize the situation before more blood is shed.<br /><br />Put crassly, "No Country For Old Men" plays as a combination of "The Terminator" and "A Simple Plan." The former comparison is particularly apt, as Chigurh is effectively a high-lit T-800. Though human, of course, Chigurh displays no more humanity than Schwarzenegger's machine, and is instead a being of pure will and self-preservation, a self-styled over-man. Bardem's killer is not as philosophical as the novel's version (the speeches are too long for film), but Bardem nevertheless translates the peculiarly surreal, unbelievable character to the physical realm impressively. He doesn't quite look like the literary Chigurh (who is described as vaguely foreign with blue eyes, I think), but who could? Bardem's turn is, naturally, somewhat stiff, but he works through subtle expressions and eye movements, imbuing the character with subtle yet pure malevolence. As good as Bardem is, however, Josh Brolin is better. One relative weakness of the novel was my indifference towards Moss, but Brolin injects the somewhat thinly written character with real humanity and an endearing, simple sense of humor, along with a cunning, quick-witted intelligence rare to rural film characters. Tommy Lee Jones is relative a low point. He's solid, but seems a little more foolish and less dignified than was the novel's Bell, somewhat reflecting the Coens' typical portrayal of small town characters. Finally, in smaller roles we have solid turns from Kelly Macdonald as Moss's sweet but dim wife and Woody Harrelson as an overly cocky colonel-turned-mercenary. (I was skeptical about Harrelson, but he pulls the small role off impressively.)<br /><br />All that said, the camera is the film's true star. "No Country For Old Men" is as purely visual as post-silent films come, with countless scenes filmed in near or complete silence. The movie has no music whatsoever prior to the credits, and is the rare film that must be seen in the theater to emphasize the enormous, endless quiet. The cinematography is always elegant, but this primarily serves to make the sporadic scenes of harsh violence all the more jarring. Nevertheless, the low-key scenes are the heart of the film, and allow the audience to enter the minds of the characters, to feel Moss's unrelenting anxiety as he discovers that he will not have a moment's piece in the foreseeable future. Most thrillers exist only for the climactic scenes, but the Coens impressively divide the intensity throughout the film as a whole, finding the drama in the passing of cars and the eerie quiet in the rural night.<br /><br />All this leads to the film's conclusion, which many, particularly those unfamiliar with the novel, see as pretentious, anticlimactic and nihilistic. While the case can certainly be made, I feel the climax (or lack thereof) works. First: climaxes, particularly in well-crafted films, usually fail to live up to the build, a concern which this deliberately circumvented here. Second, the ending is decidedly thematically important, as it also was in the novel, albeit in somewhat different form. The most significant underlying theme of the novel is chance, the lack of control individuals have over their existing. By denying us the expected conclusion, the film illustrates this principle graphically, denying the characters the confrontation that they drive towards throughout the film. Finally, the conclusion is undeniably bleak, but it isn't forced in this way. Though I prefer dark, violent entertainment, I'm not some self-consciously edgy punk who thinks that nihilistic endings are inherently "real." The bleak ending, however, is justified by the film as a whole; it is inevitable. (This is in contrast to "Million Dollar Baby" and the like, which turn bleak merely to establish their critical bona fides.)<br /><br />Hopefully this will mark a renaissance for the Coens, and perhaps the beginning to decidedly unexpected cinematic success for McCarthy. Unfortunately, "Burn After Reading" is all too similar to most recent Coens work, and we can't yet say how "The Road" and "Blood Meridian" will turn out. (I'm told many like "All the Pretty Horses," though I've never seen nor read it.) Either way, these three individuals are attached to one of the finest films of the 00s.<br /><br />Grade: A</p></br><a href="../users/A23GFTVIETX7DS.html">A23GFTVIETX7DS</a><br/><p>Through sweeping cinematography, excellent dialogue, and distinctive characters, this tale of a man hunted by a sociopath transcends its plot.  In the western plains, towns, and cities, a sociopath, Chigurh (Javier Bardem) is in pursuit of a large sum of cash from a drug deal.  Unfortunately for retired welder Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin), who finds the cash, Chigurh will stop at nothing to get it.  The small town sheriff (Tommy Lee Jones), who puts together what has happened, wants to get to Llewelyn, and a tracker (Woody Harrelson) hired by a drug lord wants to get to the money, all before the ruthless Chirgurh does,  The result is a tense, violent chase at the speed of small town life.<br /><br />The dialogue is so reminiscent of the Coen brothers' much earlier "Fargo" that it is surprising that much of it derives from a novel by a different writer, although the melding of Coens with Cormac McCarthy makes perfect sense.  In particular, the sheriff's exchanges with his deputy (Garrett Dillahunt) and his wife (played with down-to-earth confidence by Tess Harper)  give this film its greater context and rhythm as evil is treated with both matter-of-fact acceptance and disbelief.  Philosophy is doled out in brief parcels punctuated by pauses.<br /><br />Tommy Lee Jones has played this kind of character so many times that it is remarkable that he makes each one unique.  with its frighteningly  is pure evil, though even he lives by a set of rules, as ruthless as those are.  Brolin delivers a fine, sympathetic portrait of Llewelyn Moss.  And Bardem is simply terrifying with his monotone delivery and largely blank expression.<br /><br />"No Country for Old Men" is about the unexpected ways evil enters the lives of ordinary people, and the toll it takes on those who try to stop it.  Because of the tension throughout, this theme is not clear until the last moments, in an ending that at first seems out-of-place and rushed (the last a valid critique.) Although much of the violence takes place off-screen, you can never tell when it won't, and that gives the impression of a bloody-and-gore film.  I find this to be one of the best Coen brother films, although it took several days of thinking about it afterward to realize it.<br /><br />-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann</p></br><a href="../users/ABX7SEE84DMLU.html">ABX7SEE84DMLU</a><br/><p>First, the hood ornaments.  The Coens decided to feature a 1970s artifact prominently in this film.  Note the cinematography, showing Dodge Ram and Ford Granada hood ornaments lovingly and prominently.  And then we have our protagonist...<br /><br />Anton's m'name, and fate's m'game.<br /><br />Ya gotta love a guy who loves his work like this.  The obsessive assassin in this wonderful (if not heartwarming) film is named Anton Chigurh.<br /><br />Characters have a hard time pronouncing it.  Some have it rhyming with "sugar."  It looks like it should sound like "chigger" and, to be honest, that would make a lot more sense.  Like chigger bites.<br /><br />The Coens lavish so much attention on acts of violence and their aftermath.  But, as one character says, Anton has his principles - this is not about violence serving cheap avarice.  Anton is an agent and servant of fate.  His particular insanity transcends greed (unlike the bad guys in Fargo).<br /><br />Anton's purpose for existence is to kill.  If he was former Special Ops, he fulfilled his existential position there.  Too bad he was honorably discharged.  Without commanders to direct his killing competency, he must somehow direct himself.  And it's a job he embraces and enjoys.<br /><br />I just love the last scene he's in - random fate deals him a low card, but it has absolutely nothing to do with justice at all.<br /><br />To quote from Sam Spade's "Flitcraft" narrative in "The Maltese Falcon," it's as though someone lifted the lid from life and let us look at the works.  Life is filled with randomness.  It is also malevolent, replete with loss and people who are fulfilled by destruction and killing.  Anton's greatest resonance is that, honestly, there's a little bit of Anton in everyone.<br /><br />But we're the sheriff's dad, too.  You didn't like the ending?

Then call it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZOF747O5EB6R.html">A1ZOF747O5EB6R</a><br/><p>The Coen brothers' films are nothing if not eclectic.  They range from the comedic to thrillers and a number of shades in between.  In the case of "No Country for Old Men", they are very much at the thriller end.<br /><br />The basic plot is that Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) stumbles across a scene of carnage whilst in the Texas backwoods hunting for antelope.  There are multiple bodies (both human and canine), a huge haul of drugs and a bag containing $2 million in bank notes.  Moss takes the notes and returns home before making the questionable decision of returning to the scene.  It is at this point that his life makes a decided turn for the worse.  He begins to be pursued by Chirgurh (Javier Bardem), who is surely one of the most relentless and chilling killers in modern cinema.  He will use any method to kill but his preferred means is the cattle gun using compressed air.  Need more be said?<br /><br />I was unable to count the number of murders in this film.  The squeamish at heart should think twice before seeing this movie.  It's certainly not the conventional date film.<br /><br />Yet for all its murder and mayhem, "No Country for Old Men" remains a compelling film.  The viewer is drawn into the web of destruction.  One further relating point is that the film contains no theme music at all.  Every scene is forced to rely upon its own internal force and persuasion to seize the attention of the viewer.  And it succeeds.  No mean feat!</p></br><a href="../users/A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ.html">A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ</a><br/><p>Wow. Just, . . . wow. I've long been a fan of the Coen Brothers, but this riveting treatment of Cormac McCarthy's novel is the best thing they've ever done. Josh Brolin is absolutely believable as Llewelyn Moss, a West Texas welder and Vietnam vet who's out hunting pronghorn one day and comes across a drug/money exchange gone sour. Lots of dead bodies, lots of vehicles full of shotgun holes, and a briefcase with a couple million dollars in it. He should have walked away and called the police, but he gets stupid and grabs the money, thereby becoming the target of psychopathic killer Anton Chigurh, played with evil intensity by Javier Bardem. Moss is on the run, Sheriff Bell (played perfectly by Tommy Lee Jones) is trying to find him before Chigurh does, and the bodies accumulate. Woody Harrelson is competent as Carson Wells, hired to find the money by the drug people, and Kelly Macdonald, who doesn't get enough screen time, nails the role of Moss's young wife. I know West Texas, and the cinematography is extremely evocative, especially in the early scenes. The accents are perfect -- even Macdonald's, and she's a Scot. I know some people don't like the ending -- or lack of an ending. Did Carla Jean die? Did Moss escape? What happens to Chigurh after the accident? We'll never know. That's just how life is.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>"No Country for Old Men" is based on the novel by Cormac McCarthy, which I have not read. It falls nicely into the oeuvre of darkly comic, intermittently gruesome crime films directed by Joel and Ethan Coen, though there is less plot than we usually get from the brothers Coen. In the parched border country of West Texas, 1980, Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) stumbles across the aftermath of a drug deal gone wrong, including a satchel full of money. He packs his wife off to her mother's and prepares to defend himself against whomever lays claim to the loot. That would be obsessive killer Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), whose trail of carnage has put Sheriff Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) on his tail.<br /><br />The three main characters never meet, which contributes to the film's somewhat excessive length, as we must view them in separate scenes. Llewelyn, a working class Everyman who jumps at the chance for financial freedom, is pursued obsessively by Chigurh, with veteran lawman Bell bringing up the rear, bewildered by the nature of crime he sees nowadays. Chigurh is less a character than a force of nature. His actions seem to have no motivation. He represents all the bad stuff that bubbles to the surface when something in society goes  out of kilter -in this case a surge in the drug trade along the Mexican border in the early 1980s.<br /><br />This is one of the simplest plots I've ever seen filmed: An Everyman, Evil Incarnate, and a Good Guy, chasing one another, like ducks in a row. Perhaps it's too simple for a film of two hours. Tommy Lee Jones' earnest, deadpan delivery, and Chigurh's odd insistence on blaming fate for his actions helped keep my attention. But, apart from an allegory on violence that is so broad as to be meaningless, this is a chase movie that moves at a snail's pace. I was disappointed by the lack of complexity, but "No Country for Old Men" reminds me of  1990's "Miller's Crossing". Both films are violent, entertaining exercises in style, not substance, though this one is both funnier and more violent.<br /><br />The DVD (Miramax 2008): There are 3 bonus featurettes. "The Making of No Country for Old Men" (23 min) interviews the Coens about their attraction to the material and adapting the book, the cast about their roles, executive producer Robert Graf, and some creative and technical crew about recreating the 1980s.  In "Working with the Coens" (8 min), the cast and some crew talk about the Coens directing style. In "Diary of a Country Sheriff" (7 min), The Coens talk about the Bell and Chigurh characters. Subtitles for the film are available in English SDH, French, and Spanish.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FEJIORC1MBG3.html">A2FEJIORC1MBG3</a><br/><p>The bodies pile up faster than you can say "Blood Simple" in Joel and Ethan Coen's neo-noir, "No Country For Old Men", a true return to classic form and one of the most confidently assured pieces of pure filmmaking that I have seen in quite some time.<br /><br />The Coen's screenplay (adapted quite faithfully from the Cormac McCarthy novel) is rich in characterization and thankfully devoid of the self-consciously "quirky" tics that have left some of their efforts from the past several years teetering on the verge of self-parody.<br /><br />The story is set circa 1980, amongst the sagebrush and desert heat of the Tex-Mex border, where the deer and the antelope play. One day, a pickup-drivin' good ol' boy named Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) is out shootin' at some food (the playful antelope) when he suddenly encounters a fleeing, grievously wounded pit bull. The trail of blood leads him to discover the grisly aftermath of a major shootout. The one lone survivor is too dehydrated to talk, but a pickup truck loaded with heroin and a satchel stuffed with 2 million in cash speak volumes about what went down. Llewelyn skedaddles back to the trailer to tell sweet young wife Carla Jean (Kelly Macdonald) to pack a bag and start thinking about early retirement.<br /><br />"Someone" is always going to miss 2 million dollars, naturally, and the antelope hunter quickly becomes the hunted. Enter one of the most unique movie heavies in recent memory-Anton Chigurh (a supremely focused Javier Bardem) who has been hired to track down the money, with extreme prejudice. Chigurh is a textbook sociopath (he literally slaughters people like cattle, with a pneumatic prod); but he does appear to live by a code (of sorts). It's not unlike the same kind of twisted code that drives Lee Van Cleef's heartless "Angel Eyes" character  in "The Good, the Bad & the Ugly" to see his contracts through to the end, regardless of any "collateral damage" that may ensue.<br /><br />In fact, the Coens do seem to be channeling Sergio Leone all throughout "No Country For Old Men". If Chigurh is the "bad" (the "Angel Eyes" of the story) and Llewelyn is the "ugly" (like "Tuco", he's a smarter-than-he-looks oaf who has a native talent for crafty opportunism) then world-weary Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) is the "good", and the conscience of the story (he's the only player in the tale who doesn't have a self-serving agenda and actually shows compassion toward the suffering of others). He's an old-school "lawman" who (you guessed it) comes from a long line of "lawmen".<br /><br />Complicating the chase even more is the addition of one of Chigurh's professional rivals, Carson Wells (Woody Harrelson, in a nicely droll performance) an ex-green beret who has also been hired to chase down the loot (by a competing employer).<br /><br />The actors are uniformly excellent. Bardem's portrayal of Chigurh is very understated, but still quite menacing, made all the more uber-creepy by his benign Peter Tork haircut. His character is a man of few words; in the few scenes where he does "engage" conversation, it is with the detached, feigned interest of a clinical psychiatrist who is watching the clock and wishing the session would end so he could get to the golf course.<br /><br />With all of its tailor-made twists and turns, this tale is a slam-dunk for the Coens, and they gleefully take the ball and run with it. Everything about the film is pitch-perfect-the script, the casting, the editing, you name it. The cinematography is expertly handled by Roger Deakins, who has been the brothers' DP of choice since "Barton Fink". While there are a few signature Coen camera shots (the "front bumper cam" eating up the asphalt, the obsession with characters whizzing past "now entering..."/"now leaving..." highway signs), they are used judiciously and serve the narrative well. As per usual, it's the masterful implementation of little details (use of ambient sound, subtle POV perspectives and a Hitchcockian ability to milk suspense from focusing on the most mundane objects) that make this very much a "Coen brothers film".</p></br><a href="../users/A2MYUI8IT6UBUU.html">A2MYUI8IT6UBUU</a><br/><p>Relentless in method, challenging in presentation, and unforgettable in execution, the Coen Brothers' adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's acclaimed novel glimpses upon pure genius in its characters and suspenseful build, but sacrifices much of the clarity (though not the power) of its narration in the strict adherence to its source material. Boasting some of the finest performances of the year, the Coen's fantastically intricate thriller demands an astute mind and a perceptive eye to decipher the multi-layered parallels that lie in No Country for Old Men.<br /><br />When Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) stumbles upon a drug deal gone wrong and leaves with $2 million in cash, he is relentlessly pursued by several interested parties, including cunningly vicious psychopathic killer Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), cocky hitman Carson Wells (Woody Harrelson), and Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) . While Llewelyn struggles to stay alive and protect those he loves, the inevitable confrontation with his pursuers steadily closes in on him, as does unflinching fate and its inescapable finality.<br /><br />From the existentialist perspective on life, death and the inevitability of the revolutions of the future, No Country for Old Men examines several complex subjects, many requiring further investigation into the symbolisms of the characters and events portrayed. But what the film sacrifices in its quest to fully represent Cormac McCarthy's speculations and musings on human life is the conventionality of storytelling that many moviegoers all but demand. Initially the film follows Llewellyn's struggle to survive against the unyielding force of Anton's steely-eyed psychotic killer. The film builds with suspense and flawless pacing, allowing the audience to acknowledge and become familiar with these two characters and their missions. But the harsh transition back to Sheriff Bell's narration and story arc is a difficult change for viewers who were so heavily immersed in the chaotic thrills of Moss' and Chigurh's riveting chase.<br /><br />Almost as if we're cheated out of seeing each subplot through to completion, No Country for Old Men jumps around not in its time sequencing, but with its time lapses. Events most viewers would determine to be crucial to witness are not shown, instead displaying aftermaths and subsequent events that are supposed to appease our wandering minds. While this method of storytelling is both radically unique and faithful to the source material, it lessens the appeal to general audiences who expect basic information to be served up in a relatively understandable manner. Here is a film that actually appeals to critics more than to fans, and sadly the balance is a little off-kilter, resulting in too much Barton Fink and not enough Fargo. Although one gets the distinct feeling that the Coen Brothers chose this novel based on the similarities in its story and narrative to their own style and previous films, the result is one that still feels specifically like a Coen Brothers movie, despite the adaptation of another's story.<br /><br />While No Country may not find perfection in its unorthodox narrative, what has found cinematic sublimity are the performances. Josh Brolin as Llewelyn Moss pulls the audience in to his desperate situation and though his motives aren't noble by any means, never is there a doubt who you should be rooting for. A victim of greed, obstinance, and unfortunate circumstances, Llewelyn provides an antihero whose pressing journey never ebbs in intensity or moral conflict, and ultimately never ceases to intrigue. Almost destined for an Oscar nomination, Javier Bardem's monumental portrayal of ruthless killer Anton Chigurh reinvents the notion of an unstoppable juggernaut and also realizes one of the most imaginative instruments of murder ever given its wielder. Violently dispatching his victims with a fateful coin toss and an incomprehensible code of honor, Chigurh blends the best of stone-faced serial killers from the finest slashers with the cold and calculating demeanor of the most intelligent of his kind. Rarely does such a deviously twisted character create such a mesmerizing presence. While Tommy Lee Jones provides much of the sarcastic, witty dialogue inherent to the Coen Brothers' films, he also represents a narrator of sorts and offers the audience an untainted view of the horrific events unfolding. The supporting cast all turn in admirable performances as well, most notably Woody Harrelson as the egotistic Carson Wells, and Kelly Macdonald as Llewelyn's innocently na?ve wife.<br /><br />A brilliant examination of unavoidable fate and unconventional storytelling, the Coen Brothers' latest effort is one of masterful precision. Though the story is based on McCarthy's famous novel, No Country for Old Men still retains the unmistakable mark of the directing duo, and combined with phenomenal characters in a brutally unforgiving world, this thrilling saga of murder, mayhem, and destiny should not be missed.<br /><br />- The Massie Twins</p></br><a href="../users/A2T049UQONS0OY.html">A2T049UQONS0OY</a><br/><p>I heard a lot of bad stuff about this flick from my friends before I saw it -- that is wasn't Oscar-worthy, that is was same old-same old Coen brothers, that it broke no new ground, that is was slow and crawled at a worm's pace. Much of this is true but, having recently seen Oscar-nominated film "Michael Clayton" and the even slower and more boring "Atonement", I would suggest the Motion Picture Academy made a wise choice handing the statuette to this movie.<br /><br />"No Country for Old Men" is a Western reinvented in 1980 and crosses paradigms between post-Vietnam angst (both main characters, the hunter and hunted, are veterans of the conflict) and the coming Reaganomics of the era, where personal self-indulgence and winning at all costs was the mantra of making money in the 1980s.<br /><br />If you haven't seen the film, a hunter goes out to dusty rural Texas one day and stumbles upon a drug deal where everyone is shot up. He finds $2 million and a game begins between him and two other gents wanting the money. It's not clear from the film what role each protagonist played in the drug deal -- one is a bounty hunter after the dough while the other seems to have had some role in the shoot em up -- but both want the money. One is the lead character, a bad dude that dislikes everyone and sheds a lot of blood throuhgout the film.<br /><br />As is their wont, the Coens throw in another character and star -- Tommy Lee Jones as the local aging sheriff -- to mix up the bubbling cauldron. Put this all together and you have an old fahsioned cowboy chase film shot in modern day Texas using picup trucks and SUVs as substitutes for horses and covered wagons.<br /><br />One of my favorites parts of this movie is the silencer the bad guy uses on his shotgun that looks like a tin can. Boy, is that thing funny! He uses it to good affect throughout, offing about 15 people in his bloodthirstry search for the money. One of my least favorite parts is the Coens' inability to tie a knot at the end of the film, which ends the same way "The Sopranos" TV series ended -- inconclusively. You have no idea what happened to anyone still alive or the $2 million.<br /><br />That shortcoming aside, this is an interesting, involving and intellingent film made from a book that is the Coens first real suspenser since "Blood Simple" in 1984. It has much of that film's aura, pace and design and, as such, represents a return to roots for the Coen brothers. Let's hope they can continue making high quality films and continue leaving George Clooney out of their movies. That makes things better for everyone, in my opinion.</p></br><a href="../users/AUHG8KSHI529U.html">AUHG8KSHI529U</a><br/><p>I have not read the Cormac McCarthy novel on which this movie is based, so I can't use that to assess the movie.  In any case, two or three hour feature films are necessarily very different than three hundred page novels.<br /><br />This is a very violent film, but the violence is more the fabric of the film than the point of it.  I have to say that when the film ended the way it did, I was somewhat ticked off.  Then, as I thought about the title, the opening narration, and the ending, I was able to see an interpretation of the film where this ending makes a lot of sense.  Tommy Lee Jones' Sheriff Ed Tom Bell opens expressing a difficulty with the modern world where crime isn't an aberration, but far too normal.  At one point in the film, Bell has a poignant conversation with an old family friend, Ellis, who is now confined to a wheel chair after being wounded in the line of duty.  They talk about the decadence of the time, and this note is touched on again and again.  While, I could go on for pages about this, I think one point is that law enforcement is meant to clean up the spills and messes that occur in a largely orderly and moral society.  However, when the spills turn into floods of immorality, drugs, murder, greed, and thievery, well, the lawmen of the former age, the old men, realize this is no longer a country in which they can do their old job. In fact, it is a world in which the very idea of law has become an anachronism.<br /><br />The central focus of evil in the film is a character with all the pity, humanity, and warmth of a Great White Shark, Anton Chigurh (a wonderfully chilling portrayal by Javier Bardem).  This creature (hardly a man) moves through society seeking after something as an excuse to prey on humanity as if each person were no more than animals coming to his slaughterhouse.  During the film he is after a couple of million dollars Stephen Root's nameless businessman invested in a drug deal gone bad.  It was first stolen and then found by Llewelyn Moss (well portrayed by Josh Brolin) as he was out hunting for food.  Moss and his wife, Karla Jean (Kelly MacDonald give a very fine performance), are very poor and live in a run down trailer.  Moss thinks he is tougher and more aware of what he needs to do than he really is.  Frankly, he is quite good in the near term tactics of a situation, but can't see the larger forces working around him, and this is where he makes his serious mistakes.<br /><br />So, Sheriff Bell is trying to find Chigurh, becomes aware of Moss and tries to help him and his wife, Roots nameless business man is trying to recover his money, and a group of Mexicans want the money they think is theirs because it is associated with the bad drug deal.  Root hires Carson Wells (nicely done by Woody Harrelson), a bounty hunter, to get his money and stop Chigurh.  Wells is confident, even overconfident, he can do both and is quite talented at what he does.<br /><br />But the plot, and I will leave the rest for you to work out, is really only the thing that ties all the wonderful conversations together.  Short or long, it is the people talking together about all this disaster happening around them that makes the film so worthwhile.  Yes, the film is harsh and grim, but the goodness of Bell and his associates almost redeems things.  I don't share McCarthy's and the Coen Brothers despondent view of the world and, in the end, I reject the film's ethos.  Still, there are many many worse films to see.  It is far better than "There Will Be Blood" to compare it to one of its contemporaries.<br /><br />Reviewed by Craig Matteson, Ann Arbor, MI</p></br><a href="../users/A2LBG01YBSUP96.html">A2LBG01YBSUP96</a><br/><p>if hero doesnt go back to give shot up mexican some water 5 hours AFTER running into him,theres no movie.<br /><br />great acting,well written/directed and deserving of its awards and accolades.thing is,a minutes worth of common sense and this movie couldnt have been made.</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>*In a nutshell: A chase film involving, drugs, money and murder.<br />* Looks superb<br />*Three featurettes on the making of the film while it isn't bare bones, it deserves better and more special features.<br />*Try to get it as inexpensive as possible because the Oscar win leads me to believe a DOUBLE DIP will be coming later.<br />*Won't be everyone's cup of tea but for those who enjoy the work of the Coens this is an exceptional film.<br /><br />A reflection on mortality, evil and how we can lose our place in the world is the focus of the Coen brothers film adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's novel NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN. While set in 1980, the film really (like all films set in the past or future) is really about the average person copes in a world where the rules have changed so rapidly its as if the rug of reality has been pulled out from under us. It's about the changing landscape around us and how we adjust to the brutality that hides beneath the social veneer around us.<br /><br />In some respects "No Country for Old Men" reminds me of a horror film crossed with a modern day western (something the Coens suggest themselves in the extras).<br /><br />SOME MINOR SPOILERS:<br /><br />When Llewellyn Moss (Josh Brolin) stumbles over the bodies of drug dealers and cash this Vietnam vet realizes that he's hit the mother lode; no one survived and no one will miss the money. Leaving the drugs, Moss makes off with the cash. When psychopathic killer Anton Chigurh (Academy Award winner Javier Bardem creating the most chilling character since Hannibal Lecter) begins leaving a trail of bodies in pursuit of Moss, Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) is drawn into the case trying to figure out what happened and try and help Moss before Chigurh catches up to him.<br /><br />Filled with memorable performances particularly from Brolin and a world weary performance by Jones, "No Country for Old Men" provides the perfect vehicle for the Coens to continue to mine the themes from previous films enrich and add depth to them. As the title implies Bell realizes that he's a man out of time; the world has changed and all his values no longer seem to be the basis for society, behavior and his reality. Chigurh something totally out of Sheriff Bell's experience--a psychopath with his own bizarre moral code who appears to be the devil incarnate punishing those he perceives to have crossed that moral code and often leaving the outcome of his encounters to the randomness of destiny represented by the coin toss he uses to often decide his victim's fate. As Bell learns, however, the violence has always been around him and has seeped into the very ground of the country he love so much but he's at a loss with how to deal with the blunt brutality that is engulfing his world where people had at least the trappings of civilization.<br /><br /> As with "Fargo" and "Blood Simple" the film is a mixture of grim reality and black humor with the latter providing a counterpoint to the few scenes of relentless and brutal violence that Chigurh unleases.<br /><br />END OF SPOILERS:<br /><br />The DVD version of "No Country for Old Men" captures the superb photography of Academy Award nominated cinematographer Roger Deakins (who lost probably due to multiple nominations this year). His sweeping involving camera work captures the empty vistas of Texas creating the sense that Bell and others are trapped in something of a no man's land (or Hell...you can interpret it a number of ways). The muted vistas are perfectly rendered in both the DVD and Blu-ray with sharper image quality and detail in the latter particularly during the night scenes.<br /><br />The 5.1 audio mix deftly incorporates the ambience of the vast undeveloped land that surrounds our characters and comes to life brutally as action scenes are unleashed.<br /><br /> As with most Coen films that appear on home video, there's no commentary track (although cinematographer Roger Deakins would have been welcomed).  We do, however, get three long featurettes on the making of the film. Although I suspect we'll see a double dip at some point in the future due to the Oscars the film won, the featurettes really don't do enough to provide us with information on the making of the film compared to many others for lesser films.<br /><br />"The Making of No Country for Old Men runs about a half hour and has a lot of interviews and clips from the film. The most interesting aspect of this is the comments from the Coens who rarely provide us with a lot of insight into their world outside of the film itself.<br /><br />"Working with the Coens" has interviews with the actors discussing how they work as a team and their impact on their performances. It's an interesting featurette with some incredible insights from Josh Brolin and Javier Bardem.<br /><br />"Diary of a Country Sheriff" takes into Ed Tom Bell's world via interviews with Barden, Tommy Lee Jones and others. It provides interesting insights into the difficulty the sheriff has in adjusting to this new, bizarre, brutal world order.<br /><br /> A superb film that looks marvelous on both DVD and Blu-ray, the only drawback to "No Country for Old Men" is the lack of more substantive featurettes, interviews and a commentary track. I can highly recommend this film although I suspect there MIGHT be a double dip down the line (I'm on the fence on this...it needs more but I personally don't want to have to get this twice), this amazing, powerful film remains one of the Coens best since "Fargo". Although this film isn't for everyone, those who have seen other Coen films will enjoy this.<br /><br />**If you disagree post a review remember the voting system isn't about whether or not you agree or disagree about the merit of the film BUT whether or not the review helped you make a decision to buy the product.**</p></br><a href="../users/AUEHG0DB54B7K.html">AUEHG0DB54B7K</a><br/><p>My wife and I like many of the Coen bother's films, particularly Fargo. However, neither of us liked Fargo at first and also agreed that No Country for Old Men needs to be seen more than once for a complete appreciation.  The film is beautifully photographed (with New Mexico standing in for Texas) making optimal use of the wide vistas.  The performances, particularly by Tommy Lee Jones and Javier Bardem, are superb.  Tommy Lee Jones is the quintessential Western sheriff, coming from a long line of sheriffs, and is still a resourceful lawman but a bit tired as well.  Javier Bardem turns in a remarkable performance as Chigurh, an unstoppable assassin who methodically kills just about everyone who crosses his path.  When he is uncertain about snuffing out someone he will let his decision fall to a coin toss.  There is a scene early in the film when Chigurh offers a coin toss to a clerk; the dialogue is masterly, with Javier Barden being vague in a sinister way and the clerk attempting to understand what is going on, that is an example of the marvelous acting and superb editing of the film.<br /><br />Josh Brolin is perfect as the money-driven Llewelyn Moss.  Mr. Brolin has had a very good year with excellent performances in American Gangster and No Country for Old Men. One minor point that I was wondering about is he really a Vietnam Vet?  Moss appears to be younger than a man who served two tours and the answers he given a border guard about his military service could have information from a father or uncle.  The supporting roles are well cast.  Woody Harrelson has some great scenes as Chigurh former partner who has been given a contract to take him out and Kelly Macdonald is wonderful as Llewelyn's wife who ends up becoming a victim of her husband's greed.<br /><br />I have not read of Cormac McCarthy's novel but understand that the Coen brothers have faithfully followed the book including the unresolved story elements.  One difficulty with No Country for Old Men is that as the story unfolds you might be a bit lost with who some of the characters are.  My wife and I were attempting to identify on what side of the drug deal (gone fatally wrong) some of the characters were on.  We presumed that the business man who given Woody Harrelson his contract for Chigurh was in on the drug deal but his connection is never explained.<br /><br />No Country for Old Men is loaded with suspense and tension.  It is not a fast-paced film but is never boring and has a kind or moral: don't take what does not belong to you.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R1HAXRNU0QX7.html">A2R1HAXRNU0QX7</a><br/><p>I'm a HUGE fan of the Coen Brothers.  Even some of their less successful movies always leave me delighted because they dare play around with tone and audience expectations.  Who but this brotherly team would attempt a movie like THE LADYKILLERS or MAN WHO WASN'T THERE?  But in NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN, they return to their true forte...the crime thriller.<br /><br />Although my personal favorite is RAISING ARIZONA...it is probably true that in decades from now the Coens will be best remembered and admired for BLOOD SIMPLE, FARGO, MILLER'S CROSSING and now their adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's bleak Southwest thriller.<br /><br />NO COUNTRY...tells the story of how one simple man (Josh Brolin), out on a hunting trip somewhere in the vast emptiness of west Texas, stumbles across the scene of a drug deal gone bad.  Empty pickup trucks, dead men everywhere, and one lone survivor.  This dying man asks for water (which Brolin doesn't have) and then Brolin finds a big bag full of about $2 million.  He takes the money, not really thinking about the consequences.  We find that he lives in a single wide mobile home with his attractive but too compliant wife.<br /><br />We think Brolin is a simple and probably heartless man...but when he decides he needs to go back and give that dying man some water...his moment of kindness is his undoing.  He is discovered and soon his is identified.  Now he's being hunted by the authorities, the drug dealers and most awfully, he's being chased by Anton Chugurh (Javier Bardem), who could be one of the most malevolent serial killers / hitmen in movie history.<br /><br />Brolin sends his family into hiding and goes on the run himself.  He hops from one rundown hotel room to another, leaving a trail of death and violence following him.  And drawing ever closer is Bardem...calm, steady and absolutely convinced that he will recover the money and kill the man who took it.<br /><br />Trying to sort everything out is Tommy Lee Jones as the local sheriff, who feels that not only is he in over his head (although we see very early on that he has a native instinct and craftiness for his work that actually make s him a pretty brilliant investigator)...but he feels that society itself has moved on without him.  The scenes of violence he encounters are beyond anything he's experienced.  He is afraid, but worse than that, he is spiritually shaken.<br /><br />These three men, and a host of supporting characters (including a well-cast Woody Harrelson) chase each other around...and just the chase itself would make an entertaining film.  But what we have here is a film that makes us smell the desperation, feel the emptiness and loneliness of the landscape AND the people who live there.  This is a brutal and non-compromising film.<br /><br />It's so great because it is splendidly entertaining...and yet it fills you with a tension that goes beyond the simple plot developments.  In a way, we begin to feel about the events much the same way that Tommy Lee Jones feels.  We are invited into his inner turmoil...and we feel it.  And as always, the Coens are utter masters of tone.  They know exactly how funny they want humorous scenes to be and exactly how to turn tension up and down.  Then just up and up and up.<br /><br />It is a VERY well acted film. Bardem will almost certainly be nominated for an Oscar...and he deserves it.  What a role!  He's a complete success at conveying emptiness.  He kills with no pleasure...but he has also made killing his first line of action in almost any situation.  I guess he's just learned that this is the best way to solve problems and get people out of the way.  Bardem is riveting.  It's a complete clich&eacute; to say "you can't keep your eyes off him," but I'm comfortable reporting that for me, I couldn't keep my eyes off him.  It's a brilliant creation of McCarthy's...interpreted by the Coen Brothers and then brought to amazing life by Bardem.<br /><br />Brolin gives by far his finest performance.  With this performance and his role in AMERICAN GANGSTER, he must now be taken seriously as an actor.  Jones is the ONLY actor who could have played his part...he's that good and that iconic.  What other actor do we know who should be playing a grizzled Texas lawman in the modern age?  Robert Duvall perhaps?  Other than that, the list only includes Jones.<br /><br />I must warn you...you almost certainly will not like the ending.  McCarthy has never felt the need to wrap up his stories in a tidy package (doing so would in fact undo much of what he's trying to say about life) and the Coens have not shied away from his vision.  I found the ending a little jolting myself...until I took the time to reflect on what it meant and how it made me feel.  Then I understood a little better how brilliant it was.<br /><br />This is easily one of the most satisfying, most artistically mature and most viscerally entertaining movies of the year!  A triumph for the Coen Brothers!</p></br><a href="../users/A2WZ1B92F81LJJ.html">A2WZ1B92F81LJJ</a><br/><p>I have often thought it would be fun to write the plot to a film which was genuinely reflective of how real life unfolds and where no concessions were made to the conventions and impulses of dramatic structure: where the set of narratives, while looking for all the world like they'll lead somewhere, are corrupted, interfered with, or simply lapse through inattention, and are consequently frustrated, transformed, reconstituted and restated on the fly, with no dramatic lesson or deeper metaphyiscal meaning, thus ruining everything before a satisfying outcome is allowed to occur. Not dramatically satisfying, sure, but at least it wold be honest and reflective of how life really is on our side of the silver screen.<br /><br />No Country For Old Men is that sort of film. A few commentators have taken it to task for its failure to live up to story-telling and character development conventions; the plots and histories to which it introduces us don't prescribe satisfying arcs: They start off well enough but are blown off course, interrupted, or subverted. Some see this as a shortfall; to me, it is very much the point.<br /><br />It happens, in small details as much as in the main narrative, right from the beginning: Texan everyman Llewellyn is distracted whilst walking through scrubland to retrieve a deer he has shot. He sees a transverse trail of blood, leading over a hill. He follows it, and as a result never gets to collect the deer: the arc is interrupted. The trail of blood leads to the grisly scene of an aborted drug deal. Bodies everywhere and a ring of shot-up pickups suggest it has not gone to plan: its arc was interrupted. Llewellyn is thereafter drawn, like a puppet on a string, by the unintended consequences of his own actions, fiat and the deliberate pursuit of others, to completely re-sculpt the trajectory of his life. That trajectory is itself interrupted (from the perspective of the narrative of the film) in a quite unexpected way.<br /><br />The unexpected interruption of arcs continues throughout, even in small details: We are introduced to plans and trajectories we know are about to be impaired: An elderly gas station attendant, facing down a man he gradually realises to be a psychopathic killer, recounts briefly the story of his life, and how he came to be at that point at that time. His would-be murderer, Anton Chigurh, flips a dime, and makes facile observations about the fate and destiny of himself, the coin, and the gas station attendant in the same place. Note also the entry and exit from the film of Carson Welles (and for that matter his employer) - both seemingly primed to make a significant dramatic contribution but not ever getting the chance to thanks to events beyond their control. The role of destiny, fate and chance in framing our existences looms large throughout this film.<br /><br />As does the idea of non-verbal, almost innate communication. Chigurh and the gas station attendant carry on what on its face is an anoydyne conversation, but both are entirely aware what is meant and intended. Later, Chigurh and Llewellyn sit either side of a closed door, neither knowing the other is even there, but a spookily unspoken, almost telepathic dialogue carries on between them. It is masterful film-making.<br /><br />And this is not to mention the wonderful cinematography, the clever direction, the assured acting, and the clever soundtrack - where even the absence of sound is as significant and suspenseful. No Country For Old Men is also no film for every man or woman: It's extremely violent and the tension is almost unbearable at times: if you're expecting a purely intellectual journey into the dark heart of the American psyche you might (literally) get a fright: it's an old fashioned hide-behind-the-sofa sort of film into the bargain as well.<br /><br />That said, a second viewing, where the suspense was largely removed, would be highly rewarding. A candidate for DVD release for sure.<br /><br />Olly Buxton</p></br><a href="../users/A319Y83RT0MRVR.html">A319Y83RT0MRVR</a><br/><p>I was totally confused by this film. I must be missing something because I don't understand what the fuss is all about.

I know Film Appreciation classes try to normalize those answers by giving parameters by which to judge, but I still believe actual answers are as unique as the members of the audience.<br /><br />In my case, greatness is defined by the number of snippets of the individual films that are engraved in your mind. For example, the scene in "Casablanca" where the Germans at Rick's are singing their national anthem and everyone else joins together to sing the French national anthem louder.  I once had the privilege to see "Casablanca" screened at the Paramount in Austin and heard the stillness as the first words in French sounded--then the thundering applause at the end.<br /><br />Add a second quality.  Great films make me think--whether I want to or not.<br /><br />I didn't come out of the theatre this evening with a 5-star rating for "No Country For Old Men."  I sat down twice before this to write the review for this film and walked away.  Now, I'm up at 4:21 AM still considering events and dialogue and I htink I'm ready to write.<br /><br />At the very first, Sheriff Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) delivers a monologue against a West Texas backdrop.  He's a third-generation lawman who knows of a time when the Sheriffs didn't carry a gun...The times are changing (kids now have green hair and bones in their noses), but he still looks back on that prior generation as a role model.<br /><br />Next, a Texas deputy is in the process of arresting a Hispanic man (Javier Bardem).  The Deputy takes him into the station and calls the Sheriff commenting that the man had an oxygen tank and a hose kind of like someone with emphysema. That deputy was dead wrong.<br /><br />A hunter Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) is shooting at some pronghorn deer.  He hits one, but doesn't make the kill shot.  In his search for the wounded animal, he comes across a drug deal gone bad.  Both parties had apparently gone "Wild West" on each other, leaving a pickup bed full of heroin and 2 million dollars in cash in a suitcase.  Moss leaves with the suitcase full of money, but returns later that night to take a drink of water to the only survivor, a Hispanic man. One of the best scenes in that film occurs between Moss and his wife Carla Jean (Kelly McDonald) as he's leaving:<br /><br />Moss:  If I don't come back, tell Mama I love her<br />Carla Jean:  Llewelyn, your Mama's been dead 20 years<br />Moss:  Then I'll tell her myself<br /><br />By the time Moss returned to the scene, the 'corporate people' are looking for the drugs and money. Chigurh killed them, but where's the money?<br /><br />This sets Anton Chigurh (Bardem) on Moss' tail.  He's not just a gangland fix it man, Chigurh may well now be the Energizer Bunny of Sociopathic Killers.  He moves through Texas like a tornado--wreaking havoc wherever he goes, but occasionally whimsically sparing a person.<br /><br />Many reviewers have offered up "No COuntry" as an Oscar contender and I certainly would agree it's a possibility.  Bardem's portrayal of Chigurh is as fascinating as it is hair raising. Brolin and McDonald definitely deserve a nod as supporting cast. McDonald particularly stood up to Bardem very well.<br /><br />I offer up three cautions to people planning on attending this film:<br /><br />1.  Don't attend "No Country" when you're looking for passive entertainment.  Yes, there's plenty of that to be had--but the film is much more than chases and gunfights and you need to be paying attention to understand what's happening.  (I'm planning on going back by myself to review some bits I didn't quite understand)<br /><br />2.  If high violence with concomitant bloodshed and tension are problems for you, be advised that "No Country" is "no film for the squeamish or faint of heart."<br /><br />3.  If you like definitive endings, this is not your film.  On the other hand, if you like to consider the character, the circumstance, and follow the clues--like me, you can come up with a scenario that works for you.  Indeed, "No Country" may be an interesting film to show to a writing class to have students try and write an ending of their own based on the clues.</p></br><a href="../users/AYWSFRCIMOAYE.html">AYWSFRCIMOAYE</a><br/><p>This movie has no ending. That's what I don't like. I can accept a depressing or a happy ending but I don't feel comfortable with no ending. Besides that, Javier Bardem's acting is scary.<br /><br />It's worth watching once.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>If you're a Coen brothers fan, you're gonna be extremely delighted with NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN. This is Ethan and Joel at the pinnacle of their directing careers, something that should not be missed by anyone interested in film or entertainment. Forget <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009W5CA">Fargo</a>. Push aside <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000A7DVR2">The Big Lebowski</a>. Move over <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXRM">O Brother, Where Art Thou?</a>. No Country is leaps and bounds beyond those. In fact, it reigns supreme as 2007's best film.<br /><br />I don't always agree with movie critics but this time they got it right. It is the first time that Associated Press reviewers David Germain and Christy Lemire have both selected the same film as their #1 pick. With more award nominations than you could shake a stick at (including four Golden Globes, three Screen Actors Guilds, probably a gaggle of Oscars and many, many, many others), No Country will undeniably have directors, actors and screenwriters jumping up on stage come awards ceremony time.<br /><br />Equal parts thriller, western, crime-drama, and action, No Country weaves a tapestry of excellence throughout its length.<br /><br />The first note of excellence must be directed at Spanish actor Javier Bardem. Probably not very well known to most American audiences, Javier has cemented himself as the leader in portraying a psychopathic killer and (dare I say it!) has surpassed that of Anthony Hopkins in his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005LINC">Silence of the Lambs</a> Hannibal Lecter role (something that I thought would never happen). Ruthless, unforgiving, sociopathic, and in desperate need of a new hair style, Anton Chigurh (Bardem) is flawless. Every time he showed up on-screen I felt a chill run through my bones ("Call it"). Absolutely perfect.<br /><br />The next note of excellence must go to Josh Brolin and Tommy Lee Jones. Llewelyn Moss (Brolin, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000XASD1K">Planet Terror</a>) is the lucky/unlucky soft-spoken Texas cowpoke/hunter who stumbles across a veritable fortune in drug money only to be relentlessly pursued by killer Anton. Mr. Moss' gradual decline in health (mainly due to wounds inflicted on him by Anton) is painful to watch up until the very end. Sheriff Bell (Tommy Lee Jones, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F8O2QU">The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada</a>) is the opposite of Anton Chigurh. He doesn't understand all of the death and destruction laid at his feet. He longs for a time when murders were easy to track and solve, not these new-fangled deaths where bullets aren't used (air-guns do just fine) and there seems to be no rhyme or reason to their patterns.<br /><br />The fourth (perhaps this should've been first) note of excellence goes to the Coen brothers for their perfect adaption of Cormac McCarthy's novel by the same name. Many lines of dialogue were lifted verbatim from the novel itself, including the ending monologue by Tommy Lee. It's noteworthy to mention here that the Coen brothers not only directed but wrote the screenplay, too.<br /><br />The final note has to go Cinematographer Roger Deakins (he's worked with the Coen brothers on many occasions and also did the exemplary <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000DZIGDU">Jarhead</a> work). Every scene was so well thought-out and so convincingly filmed that viewers are carried freakishly easy through this incredible story.<br /><br />It's difficult to do justice to this film with one short review, simply because there are so many great elements to it. The casting was spectacular -- with Woody Harrelson (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQLZ8S">North Country</a>) and Kelly Macdonald (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000A59PL0">The Girl in the Cafe</a>) pulling in exceptional supporting roles -- as was Carter Burwell's haunting original musical score and Mary Zophres impeccable costume designs.<br /><br />If you missed this film at your local cineplex, you may have gypped yourself from experiencing this amazing cinematic event. Now you've gotta wait for the DVD to be released and then ...it's your call.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL.html">A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL</a><br/><p>Times have changed. Surely that's what Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) has in mind when he visits an old friend and commiserates about how things ain't like they used to be.  "This land's hard," muses his friend.  Another police friend has examples of kids with green hair and bones in their noses who have left out "Sir," and "Ma'am" out of their vocabulary.  They both shake their heads over "The dismal tide".<br /><br />But, really we're not all that ready for the events that happen, either.  Significantly, a chilling psychopath, Chigurh (Javier Bardem) goes on a rampage, slipping out of a U.S. border town deputy's hands with the coolest and calloused of skill. He's involved with a drug ring, one that has a shoot out that's left about a dozen dead in the desert.  Besides a gun that has the force of a lightening bolt, his weapon of choice is an electrical device--one that's meant to quickly put cattle out of their misery (something like a hydrolic nail dispenser).  Just like Tommy Lee Jone's portrayal of Two Face in 'Batman Forever' <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0790731002">Batman Forever</a> his bitterness of fate has his victims choosing heads or tails in a coin toss, meant to mirror the randomness of bitter fortune in his own life.  The difference is that in the 'Batman' movie it was campy; here it comes across with deadly solemnity--one that hits you right between the eyes.  The only one who comes the closest to understanding him is Carson Wells, (Woody Harrelson), a man with corporate ties whose one conversation reveals quite a lot.<br /><br />So it goes with the rest of the movie.  A Vietnam vet, Llewelyn (Josh Brolin), takes the center stage.  While hunting antelope in the desert, he comes across the aftermath of the shootout and discovers a cache' of money.  He isn't too forthcoming with his wife, Clara Jean (Kelly Macdonald), but he's on a mission as someone who hasn't seen too many breaks in his own life.  Chigurh's stalking has so many twists to it that I found myself craning my neck as if I had to look around the corner from getting shot.  It's all cat and mouse, and the villain seems to almost possess an unnerving omniscience for anyone who gets in his way.  Chigurh eventually uses Clara Jean as bait for Llewllyn to give the money back.  While I've seen many movies where the villain uses the spouse as bait, this movie rendered it so refreshingly original, I felt I was watching this plot component for the first time.<br /><br />It has been said that the Coen Brothers are masters of plot.  Here they draw from the same-titled novel by Cormac McCarthy.  While I haven't read the novel, I am grateful that, although I'm a big Coen Brothers fan, they didn't resort to kidnapping in any frame of the movie.  Besides that I never knew where this movie was going.  There's still the ingenuity of the Coen Brothers' irony, but they rely heavily on one of the most chilling portrayals of any villain I can think of in cinematic history.  This movie is also the most violent of any I've seen this year.  (Considering I've seen '3:10 to Yuma' and 'Eastern Promises' among them, that's saying a lot.)<br /><br />For all it's innovation and startling violence, 'No Country for Old Men' has to be one of the tensest and best movies woven together all year.<br /><br />(The special features are worthwhile.  I must note that if you're looking for a definite commentary for the ending, you'll need to look elsewhere [although they certainly explain the theme well which is at least half of the framed ending.]  "Working with the Coens" goes for less than eight minutes.  Commentary on the movie is worthwhile and clocks in at about 23:00.  There's also a worthy third section that is approximately seven minutes long. For me I couldn't get enough.  If you don't mind going behind the curtain to see the secrets of the magic show, then the extras are quite worthwhile.  [Within Amazon Miles Moore's commentary "Yes, Virginia, There's a Plot Resolution in 'No Country for Old Men'" illuminated a lot for me.  Some other discussions suffice.]  I think Cormac McCarthy wanted people to have the theme and concepts stuck in their heads rather than a neat resolution.  Real life is often like that.  I keep thinking of real life serial killers:  Son of Sam and The Zodiac Killer.  Justice catches up to them, but some things in life are elusive--just like the movie.  I like being able to glimpse Sherrif Bell's head at the end.  "You don't know what He (God) thinks," says Bell's friend, played by Barry Corbin.  (This character is essential for assuaging Bell from stepping into the chasms of pride and despair.)  I think there's hope "kindled" in Bell's mind at the end, but you can buy this film and watch it over and over again and decide for yourself.)</p></br><a href="../users/A6FIAB28IS79.html">A6FIAB28IS79</a><br/><p>Poetry fans tend to make much of the original source of the the title--W. B. Yeats' "Sailing to Byzantium," in which the aging narrator wishes to exchange his hard life in Ireland ("that country") for an imaginary aesthetic existence in ancient Byzantium, with its mosaic temples and golden sculptures.  But neither the novelist (Cormac McCarthy) nor the Coen brothers are promising any sort of deliverance through poetry, art or any other imagined alternative to mortal existence.  This isn't a story for elitist intellectuals and interpreters of Yeats' frequently arcane visions (some of my students even find the poem downright "wacky").  On the other hand, the movie is not merely a story for those in need of a couple of hours of escape (though I frankly found the basic plot and characters so entertaining I was hanging on to my seat with white knuckles to the very end).<br /><br />But the story is the Coen brothers' "bait" to get the viewer to think about non-trivial matters.  After all, it's only we humans who are blessed with "self-consciousness"-- with the capacity to think about our individual "identities," and even about our own life and death (though the beauty of good movies is that further inquiry into "deep meanings" is an option, not a requirement).  Personally, I choose to take the bait and the next step: what's the point of the story?  what's the "meaning" of what we've just seen?  After some (not much) deliberation, I'd offer the following "translation" of the title (sorry about the wordiness): the older we get in this finite, temporary world, the more conscious we become of our mortality and death.  Some of us pretend we can beat it; most of us see it as irrational and unfair; practically all of us avoid or at least postpone thoughts about the subject, instead preferring to wait around and see what happens.<br /><br />Tommy Lee Jones says toward the end of the story that he's quitting as sheriff.  He had expected "God to somehow come into his life" but is now too fully aware that God (much less he himself) is over-matched.  The film's nemesis is a merciless "executioner" with less conscience than The Terminator and sufficient inscrutability to make even Woody Harrelson's perceptive diagnosis of him (as a psychopathic killer with principles, albeit devoid of "morality") inadequate.  In short, the film is a version of an Ingmar Bergman film like "Through a Glass Darkly" or an earlier, better-known film like Bergman's "The Seventh Seal"--the primary difference being that the Coen Brothers' filmic and narrating style is more apt to catch the attention of a larger, "non-academic" audience.  It's doubtful many of those who see the film will be satisfied with the conclusion.  In fact, there is no closure, thus breaking an unwritten rule of all cinema.  Recall how Hitchock has a shrink appear at the end of "Psycho" to explain in logical terms the character of Norman Bates (and practically everything we've just seen).  When the 1919 German expressionistic film, "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari," played before American audiences, an actor was hired to appear on stage at the end of the movie to assure us that the monstrous killer-psychopath was now completely cured (no need to worry about guys like Hitler).  And so we would all like to believe--about extended life-spans, the "cures" of medicine, the progress of science.  But the older you get--and the more inquisitive--the more you realize that the advertisers-promoters-money-hungry pharmaceutical companies, cosmetic surgeons, "powerful" positive thinkers--have sold us all a bill of goods.  Like the characters in the film, they're as likely as us not to know what's going to happen next, pretending that life is an open and free proposition and that we could be one of the "lucky ones," awaiting the equivalent of personal fame and fortune if not immortality.<br /><br />Josh Brolin appears to be the sympathetic "hero"--flawed by greed and, like the characters of "Treasure of the Sierra Madre," making what could be a fatal mistake.  Yet he has a John Wayne-like rugged individualism, a knack for survival, and commands instant respect from those around him once they learn of his service in "Nam"--but that won't get you diddly in the relentless, fatalistic, flip-of-a-coin determinism that, in the Coen Brothers' view of modern existence, controls our lives.  Brolin's conscience requires him to return to the scene of a crime with water for the survivor of a drug deal gone terribly bad, yet he can dismiss his wife's concerns for her mother. And in this instance we as the audience can afford to dismiss them as well.  By this time we're conditioned to expect such  a remark to be followed by the Executioner's (Javier Bardem--looking like a smaller but more chilling version of Schwarznegger or Andre the Giant) quick extermination of the person so named via his powerful weapon with its menacing silencer.  But that would follow a certain pattern of logic--instead she dies of cancer.  And when our leading contender for hero is momentarily distracted by a sunbathing babe in long shot, there's no need any longer to even play out the execution. We see a dead body floating in the motel's pool (motels outnumber "homes" by a considerable margin in this movie--as mortal beings, we're all "transients," whether we know it or not, whether we've paid a mortage or not.<br /><br />Brolin's wife suddenly becomes a central figure, but only briefly.  She at least has no illusions about getting a lucky roll of the dice.  Her fate, like that of all mortals, is preordained, and she refuses to play the Executioner's coin-flip game, calling it more accurately: "It's not me or the coin that decides what happens to me.  It's you."  But in this circular question about free will and the meaning of life, Bardem answers her back: "You're wrong.  That's how I got here."  In other words, each of us could not have been born had the slightest circumstance been changed on the night (or whenever) we were conceived.  And who knows why we were born as human beings and not cats?  It's all a game of chance, and there isn't even an authentic card dealer. (The viewer can only speculate why the Executioner sees his own dicy birth as license to reverse the process--serving as the agent of hastening death for all.  Is he sparing his victims Kierkegaard's characterization of mortality as a "sickness onto death"--a charitable interpretation, yet his actions practically resist characterization as "evil" due to their irreversible and mechanical necessity).  But its through this mysterious (and deadly) character that the movie destroys all of our illusions and ultimately goes after the worst of the deadly sins--about which, even after the Bible and all the world's important literature and religions, we lack awareness: pride, hubris, taking upon ourselves what belongs only to God.  When will we learn?  Why can't we?  Why must we be so prideful in the face of more violence, terrorism, and destruction?<br /><br />But therein lies the film's admission of Aristotle's "fatal flaw" and along with it the small ray of light in the film (along with some moments of humor, which even the critics seem to have missed).  Brolin, after all, did make a mistake and had the arrogance to think he could get away with his theft of the drug money intended for someone else.  And for a moment, he let carnal desire distract him from the real threat.  Moreover, he took his own life more seriously than that of his wife or mother-in-law, by assuming that the Nemesis-Executioner was interested "only" in him!  But you simply can't take for granted the next move of this Executioner, who passes up an opportunity to snuff out the sheriff, Tommy Lee Jones (the closest thing to an authentic hero). Not being detected could be a motive, but is it possible he senses in the sheriff greater realism and honesty than in any of the other characters?<br /><br />The last two scenes do nothing to prepare the spectator for an end, but they do practically "require" interpretation (witness the complaints from the numerous reviewers who trash the entire film because it doesn't end as they might like).  I like happy endings, and I'm frequently impatient when things don't go my way, but I'm afraid that in this story, especially, those viewers who simply refuse to discuss, think about, or interpret a disturbing moment (or even a fictional movie!) are told  to shape up or ship out. The Executioner (quite vulnerable himself, by the way, but a better survivor than Harrelson or Brolin) walks away.  Behind him he leaves the seeds of greed (and of fatal pride) in a young boy who took money (from the Nemesis, naturally) in exchange for what began as a Good Samaritan act.  Next on the agenda of the recovered Executioner, who ambles off into a typical American neighborhood (like that in David Lynch's "Blue Velvet") who knows what or whom?--the sheriff?  His are the last words as he reports a dream about meeting his father (who did not die an old man), and then says: "I woke up."  That awakening is what this movie is all about. The screen goes black waiting for the spectator's inner light to come on.  It's time to wake up--perhaps now more than ever.  There may be a future, but there will be no lottery tickets--even to those who win them.  It's we who must act to make the best of that mortally-defined fateful span of existence that lies before us.  We can't know if our efforts will bear positive fruit, but we can know that "good" isn't simply going to happen by wishing and waiting for it.  And we can also know that our prideful moments can only bring more misery.  And if we don't know this now, the storyteller seems to be saying, we most certainly will either know it, or feel the effect, when we're older.<br /><br />But this may too rigid, or unforgiving, an interpretation. Thinkers like Kierkegaard, Tillich, O'Connor, Ingmar Bergman had no illusions about the lack of theological curiosity residing in human beings.  Yet they also accepted Socrates' insistence that "the unexamined life is unfit to be lived," knowing that fatal pride is born of presumptuous ignorance, not of open inquiry).  Created with the unique ability to question, to examine, and to know, humans often appear practically eager to forfeit this "gift" (we can be thankful most of the world's great religions make room for a God of grace--a Deity extending love to those who may not have the opportunity for rigorous examining of one's self and surroundings).<br /><br />For those who prefer a less theological interpretation, the emphasis on "land" in the title provides it.  Why would the storyteller select as a setting for this parable about modern-day America a vast, open, dry and sterile wasteland?  Reminiscent of T. S. Eliot's modernist poem "The Wasteland" or Italian film director Michelangelo Antonioni's critique of present-day America ("Zabriskie Point"), the setting repeatedly points to a vacuum, a void, a land laid waste by the same human beings it once nurtured and empowered.  Everyone wants answers.  We have the power to find them, but only if we're not too complacent or proud to search for them.</p></br><a href="../users/A21B2TJBWCSK1R.html">A21B2TJBWCSK1R</a><br/><p>After two lackluster efforts - the bland romantic comedy, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JMET">Intolerable Cruelty (Widescreen Edition)</a> and the unnecessary remake of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00029LNYQ">The Ladykillers (Widescreen Edition)</a> - the Coen brothers return to form with a vengeance with No Country for Old Men. Even though it is an adaptation of the novel of the same name by Cormac McCarthy, the subject matter is very familiar territory for the Coens. The story revolves around a bag of money and the desperate quest by several men to acquire it and who are more than willing to kill for it. Sound familiar? <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005LC4P">Blood Simple (Director's Cut)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009W5CA">Fargo (Special Edition)</a> and (rather humourously) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000A7DVR2">The Big Lebowski (Widescreen Collector's Edition)</a> are past Coen brothers films that feature a similar story so it is certainly material that they are drawn to and the results speak for themselves: critically-lauded and the recipient of numerous awards including four Academy Awards.<br /><br />Javier Bardem is chillingly effective as a sociopathic killer who sometimes lets his victims decide their fate with a coin toss. Like other cold-blooded killers in Coen brothers films (the Dane in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008RH3L">Miller's Crossing</a>, Charlie Meadows in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008RH3J">Barton Fink</a>, and Gaear Grimsrud in Fargo) Chigurh is an enigmatic unstoppable force of nature. In contrast, Sheriff Bell is the film's moral voice of reason and who better than Tommy Lee Jones with his kind, weathered face and equally weathered voice that instantly suggests years of life experience. He conveys the intelligence of his character by the way he works a crime scene, quickly deducing what happens through keen powers of observation much like Marge Gunderson in Fargo. Unlike Marge, however, Bell has seen better days and does not share her optimism. There is a tired sadness in his eyes that says so much about his character.<br /><br />Roger Deakins' superb cinematography perfectly captures the harsh, desolate West Texas landscape and how its vast expanse dwarfs the characters. They are at its mercy as much as they are with each other. The Coens have made a nihilistic thriller reminiscent of ones made in the 1970s.<br /><br />"The Making of No Country for Old Men" takes a look at how this film came together. Producer Scott Rudin brought the book to the Coens. They liked the cinematic possibilities and how it could be adapted into a genre film that subverts genre. This is a fairly standard featurette but everyone speaks eloquently about the film.<br /><br />"Working with the Coens" features the cast and crew speaking admiringly of working with the Coen brothers with a lot of their crew having worked with them for years.<br /><br />Finally, there is "Diary of a Country Sheriff" which takes a look at Sheriff Bell and how his character is a meditation on aging. He pursues Chigurh but does not understand him or what motivates his actions. The Coens and the cast talk about these two characters and their contrasting takes on life.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TEMNM9ZEOLJ6.html">A1TEMNM9ZEOLJ6</a><br/><p>Javier Bardem steals the show here as a zombie-esque bad guy who kills people with a cattle gun as he stalks Josh Brolin who has Bardem's $2 million from a drug deal gone bad. Tommy Lee Jones plays the same lawman he's done at least a dozen times before. Intense violence marks this chase movie which, in the end, doesn't tell us much, despite attempts at seeming important and ominous in some way. Set in 1980, the soundtrack of the times is missing, though the cars look right. The end is extremely anti-climactic, which may be one reason this got so much praise. I'm inspired to check out the literary work on which it's based. Never heard of Bardem before, but he is great here, very spooky.</p></br><a href="../users/A18IK6YI6T3RK2.html">A18IK6YI6T3RK2</a><br/><p>In typical Coen Bros. fashion this film is hyper violent, well acted and beautifully filmed.  Bardem won a much deserved Oscar for his role, he get the most out of this psychotic with an odd honor system; every time Bardem was on film, he sent chills up your spine.  The story is one of choices, all the characters have choices and their fate rides on these decisions.  Alot has been made of the ending, and though I agree is sort of abrupt, I really had no real qualm with it.  I did wish however that one character at the end, had been more willing to play the game so to speak, I was saddened most by this persons fate.  Really good movie, worthy of its Oscar haul.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BZ7MYTSNYMEW.html">A2BZ7MYTSNYMEW</a><br/><p>I will first say that when I started watching this movie it was really late at night, and I fell asleep with only about 30 minutes to go. But the next morning, I woke up and watched it again and realized that I must have just been tired because it was a decent movie. I like the old look of the film, and I liked the fact that the movie did not depend on a lot of special effects but instead counted on vivid imagery to tell a decent story.<br /><br />Llewelyn, an VietnamVet, happens upon a bloody "drug deal gone bad", where everyone is dead (with the exception of a man who is on the verge) and $2 million dollars is just sitting there (in a suitcase) for the taking. What does Llewelyn do? He ignores a dying man (who is begging for water), takes the money and goes home to count his good fortune (why he didn't think the real owners of the money would come looking, I will never know). What does he do next? He feels guilty and goes back to the scene to give water to the dying man (which isn't so smart because if he does live, wouldn't he want the money back?). He was waging the internal war between his greed and his guilty conscious. Now initially, I thought that this was the cause of the chain of events that follow, but I soon realized is that the money would have been located by the Killer regardless. It had GPS! That's right boys and girls, the crazy killer (Chigurh, who has a thing for making you choose your fate...he asks you to pick heads or tails) would have found him anyway because he was following the money.<br /><br />Sending his sweet wife to her mother (who is crazy and tells everyone who will listen that she is dying), Llewelyn attempts to outsmart and outrun the killer (and I do mean killer, he kills any and everything with a cool gun) and keep the money. After several deaths, and a lot of maneuvering Llewelyn comes face to face with the killer and several other interesting characters, while a very determined local sheriff attempts to uncover the truth and find him before it is too late.<br /><br />Now don't get me wrong, I do have a few criticisms (although I still gave it 4 stars). #1. I felt a little cheated at the ending. After almost 200 minutes of story, I had an ending that really would have been better if some things had happened differently, but I won't tell you how it ends. I could have just thought of different endings for Llewelyn, Wells, the wife, the cop, and the crazed killer. And therefore, I found the ending to be a little anticlimactic.  And. #2. Maybe I am stupid, but I am still confused about who had the money in the end? And if it is who I think it was, well that is even more disappointing.<br /><br />Now I will say what I did like....I liked each and every character (the good, the bad and the ugly). I loved the conversations that Tommy Lee Jones had with the guy in the wheelchair who put his entire life into perspective, and I thought the mother (Llewelyn's wife's mother) was hilarious. I also thought that the imagery (dry scenes, Texas) and the language (Southern drawls) were extremely appropriate.<br /><br />Anyway, with all that said, I really thought that the movie had more positives than negatives. And I believe that the average movie watcher, if they aren't expecting a lot of special effects, but want instead to see a crazy killer (with a bob), who mutters few words, and appears to be smarter than the average person, will enjoy this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A17FLA8HQOFVIG.html">A17FLA8HQOFVIG</a><br/><p>This film is directed by the famous Coen brothers who also wrote the screenplay adapted from the novel by Cormac McCarthy.  It is dark and brooding story and the suspense is so thick that it kept me squirming uncomfortably in my seat throughout.  Indeed, it is a fine film, artistic in every way.  It's already won a whole bunch of awards and will certainly make it into the Oscar nominations this year.<br /><br />John Brolin plays the role of Llewelin Moss, a simple working-class welder, and occasional hunter who accidentally comes across a murder scene in the Texas desert.  The inhabitants of several trucks are all dead or dying and there is a satchel of money from what looks like a drug deal gone bad.  Llewelin grabs the money and runs and the rest of the film is a cat and mouse game between him and Javia Bardem, cast as Anton Chiguh, the personification of evil itself.  Llewelin is way over his head as he matches wits with Chiguh, whose deadly weapon of choice is air gun which is usually used to kill cattle. Tommy Lee Jones is cast as the aging and wise sheriff.  He tries to stop the mayhem but is powerless against it.<br /><br />I didn't like the plot.  I want good people to win.  I want a resolution.  I want a tidy ending that I understand.  I don't like leaving the theater and feeling that the conclusion was just a cop out by the author who wrote himself into a hole and, because he couldn't figure out an ending, kills off a lot of people and then decides to let the viewers figure it all out for themselves.  O.K.  I know this is art.  I also know that I can find a book or a film satisfying either in spite of, or sometimes because of, this kind of world view.  But it the case of "No Country for Old Men", all I felt was annoyance and depression.<br /><br />I cannot say this was a bad film.  Film buffs will appreciate it.  The directing and acting were impeccable.  And even though the 122 minute-runtime seemed to move at a snail's pace, there wasn't a wasted motion or expression.  And so, even though I appreciate the artistic impulses that went into this film, I can only give it a lukewarm recommendation.</p></br><a href="../users/A28OB1QLXN5BM6.html">A28OB1QLXN5BM6</a><br/><p>I watched this movie to see what all the fuss was about.  It won the Academy award.  I hoped and expected to like it.  But, I am not sure I even understood it.<br /><br />There are some truly wonderful points about this film.  The acting is outstanding.  Tommy Lee Jones, Josh Brolin, and Javier Bardem all give stellar performances.  You love Tommy as the country sheriff; you root for Josh Brolin all the way, and Javier Bardem is an extremely creepy bad guy.  There is also a great cast of tremendous supporting actors, who all give marvelous performances. The settings are authentic - there is no question that you are in rural Texas.  The cinematography adds to the feeling of desert and desolation.<br /><br />However, the plot is all over the place.  It SEEMS to be about the hunt for a psychopathic killer.  It SEEMS to be about the aftermath of a drug deal gone bad.  It SEEMS to be about the life of an old country sheriff in rural Texas.<br /><br />However, based on the odd, unfinished, unsatisfying end of this film, where TLJ is explaining the dreams he had the night before to his wife, the summation of the actual story appears to be "life sucks, and then you die."  That's it.<br /><br />I watch a movie for a number of reasons.  To be entertained.  To be moved or touched.  To learn something.  No Country for Old Men did none of these things.  At the end, I felt...nothing.  I have no impressions from it, no real thoughts about it.  Just a vague sense of "why?"...<br /><br />I cannot recommend this film to anyone.  The emperor truly is naked.</p></br><a href="../users/AIMR915K4YCN.html">AIMR915K4YCN</a><br/><p>NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN isn't a thriller / horror film. It's not an action / drama either. NCFOM is a tragedy. This is 1980 TEXAS, representing American innocence and ignorance. Enter Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), psychopathic murderer, relentless hunter, and harbinger of doom. He is the Reaper, the Angel of Death, the Antichrist, Randall Flagg, Michael Myers, and the TERMINATOR x 10! Chigurh represents our societal dissolution into chaos. Our slow, cancerous demise as a nation of life, liberty, or the pursuit of happiness. He is the beginning of the end. We are no more than cattle for his bolt-gun. Who is he really? The devil? Well, I don't believe in the devil. However, Anton Chigurh seems extremely familiar to me. Unfortunately, I do believe in him, and read / hear about him most every day, in all of his various guises. He is not so much eeevil as he is anti-good. There is no humanity, only bestial survival. No love (nor hate for that matter), only cold, dead advancement through a society that dares not look at him. I truly believe that he's always been with us. It now appears that he has gained great strength / momentum, and is ready for his day. NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN is a dire warning told in a fable. I can't get it out of my head...</p></br><a href="../users/A31ARSC1LGY8WK.html">A31ARSC1LGY8WK</a><br/><p>The Coens return to "Fargo" territory with a blood-soaked tale of local yokels coming up against big city criminals, however, this time the result is completely reversed. Javier Bardem is creepy as a "grim reaper" type and Josh Brolin is excellent as an opportunist who gets in way over his head. Tommy Lee Jones and Woody Harrelson have small but telling parts as an old cop and "fixer", respectively. The only thing that detracts from this film - and the same is true of all Coen films - is the frequent and unnecessary brutality that the Coen's enjoy wallowing in.</p></br><a href="../users/A2CK0VXUDVXGMN.html">A2CK0VXUDVXGMN</a><br/><p>Great acting, suspenseful, but with a message that evil often wins...riveting at times, disgusting, heart thumping, great action...great acting...worth the effect if you enjoy a kind of lingering depressive effect.  I did not sleep well...</p></br><a href="../users/A387BD735MI50R.html">A387BD735MI50R</a><br/><p>The slow, self-assured menace of Javier Bardem's character is riveting to watch. However, since so much of this movie depends on the tension created by Bardem's terrifying, toying deliberation, you might be a little disappointed by what seems to be some unwarranted hastening of the action in certain places. It feels as if a number of scenes were left on the cutting room floor - scenes that we want to see, that we are primed to see by the overall pacing of the movie.<br /><br />For example, there is the scene that was so often used to advertise this movie - the scene in which Bardem's character engages a convenience storeowner in what we clearly perceive is a life-or-death coin toss. When Bardem mockingly calls the storeowner "Friendo" and commands him to call heads or tails, we feel that something in particular triggered Bardem's animosity, that the storeowner himself might have presumptively addressed Bardem as "Friendo." However we don't see any of what might have led to the showdown. The scene is pretty much limited to just the action shown in the advertising trailer.<br /><br />If one of the reasons we watch thrillers, outside of pure vicarious enjoyment of violence, is to rehearse what we ourselves might do if confronted by extreme threats - then it's important to see the whole development of the threat.<br /><br />One other quibble: the plot's logic fails on a key point. Bardem's character proves to be such an implacable, unerring juggernaut in tracking down whoever stole his drug consignment, we wonder how he so easily lost track of the drug package in the first place.<br /><br />However these minor points aside, "No Country" is an absolutely engrossing trip - taken once. When I went to watch it through a second time though, I found I wasn't nearly as involved. I did appreciate having another chance to get to know Tommy Lee Jones' character, with his wonderful, heroic resign. But Bardem's Chigurh character didn't seem as interesting the second time around. Whereas I can watch other Coen Brother's classics such as "Fargo" and "Blood Simple" any number of times and always find some new fascination with them - this movie didn't seem complex enough to hold up that way.<br /><br />In summary, this is a great movie to rent, but it might not be worth adding to your permanent collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FG91CM8221X1.html">A1FG91CM8221X1</a><br/><p>Everybody who is looking at this product page already knows the basic plot of "No Country for Old Men," so I will not waste time recounting it here. So many of the reviews take the Coen Brothers to task for not resolving the plot at the end. I beg to differ; there IS a resolution to the plot of "No Country for Old Men." The resolution is simply so bleak and dour--cutting us off totally from the traditional pleasures of crime dramas, Westerns and even film noir--that viewers just don't want to believe it. I haven't read Cormac McCarthy's original novel, but everything I've read about the film leads me to believe it is extremely faithful to the source. McCarthy, for those unfamiliar with his work, is a novelist whose views of life and fate make Thomas Hardy look like A.A. Milne. It isn't surprising, then, that the makers of "Blood Simple" and "The Man Who Wasn't There" would find McCarthy's work so congenial, and be able to do justice to his unsparing vision while other filmmakers (Billy Bob Thornton's version of "All the Pretty Horses" comes to mind) flinch from it. "No Country for Old Men" is the Coen Brothers' best film since "Fargo" (though even "Fargo" is a Disneyfied cheerfest compared with "No Country for Old Men"; if Cormac McCarthy had written "Fargo," Marge Gunderson and her unborn child would have been residual casualties, and Gunsrud would still be wandering the prairies looking for a "pancakes house"). "No Country for Old Men" is a movie I greatly admire and respect, though--unlike "Fargo"--it's not a movie I envision watching over and over again. But the Coen Brothers certainly blast the film's memory into your brain, as surely as Anton Chigurh's cattle gun. The film's screenplay (by the Coens, of course) and cinematography (vast echoing expanses of desert and mountain, captured brilliantly by the great Roger Deakins) are perfect in every way. So are the lead performances by Tommy Lee Jones, Javier Bardem and Josh Brolin, each earning a one-way ticket to Brandoville, the capital of Olivier Land. The supporting performances of Woody Harrelson, Kelly Jean Macdonald, Barry Corbin, Tess Harper, Beth Grant, Gene Jones, Stephen Root and others are of equal (that is to say, surpassing) excellence. "No Country for Old Men" is unquestionably a great movie. I must confess, however, that after seeing it I had to watch "I Remember Mama" as an antidote.</p></br><a href="../users/AT6CZDCP4TRGA.html">AT6CZDCP4TRGA</a><br/><p>I'll not bore you with a plot synopsis, which about half of all the reviews here have already provided.<br /><br />Nor will I go on at length about how masterful the script, actors, cinematography, and directors are---you probably already know that anyone who likes quality films (i.e. NOT the usual, execrable Hollywood big-budget, cliche-ridden, mainstream blockbusters, but REAL films that were *not* solely made by and for idiots and focus groups) raves about this movie's technical and artistic excellence.<br /><br />No, it's the ending of this movie, which is completely abrupt, inexplicable, and deeply unsatisfying in the conventional sense of what we usually expect from an ending: some kind of closure and resolution, some kind of "message" or "point," the good guys win or lose, the bad guys get caught or escape, the boy gets the girl or doesn't, tragedy or providence step in, etc.<br /><br />This movie ends with NONE of those things.  It doesn't seem to have any sense or meaning, rhyme or reason.  It's as if the rug was suddenly pulled from underneath us during the blink of an eye, and we have no idea who did it, when, or why.  It just happens.<br /><br />Well, this is one of the best reasons to buy this film on DVD: if you are totally confounded and befuddled by the way it ends, in the Special Features there is one segment where the directors and several of the cast talk about the film...they pretty much tell you what it's about, which is mainly through the title, the setting (the nakedly pitiless, harsh West Texas desert), and especially the stunningly diabolical character that Javier Bardem plays (for which he won a richly deserved Oscar).  It's kind of a nice Cliff-Notes feature, really.  And believe me, it makes all the sense in the world.<br /><br />In a nutshell, to truly "get" this film and its seemingly enigmatic ending, you have to understand one simple nugget: Sometimes making NO sense at all, actually makes the MOST sense of all.</p></br><a href="../users/A9I40WFF40R4.html">A9I40WFF40R4</a><br/><p>A new Coen Brothers film is always something to look forward to, even if what you are seeing is not these film-makers at their best. "No Country For Old Men" from a line from the poet William Butler Yeats-- adapted from a book by the same title by Cormac McCarthy-- is certainly one of their finest. From the opening  panoramic shots of the arid countryside to the excellent casting--to a person-- to the abrupt, existential ending, this movie delivers. Both Josh Brolin (Llewelyn Moss, the Vietnam veteran who discovers the drug money), and Jommy Lee Jones as Sheriff Bell, give rugged understated performances. Javier Bardem as Chigurh, the crazed mysterious henchman who kills for the delight of it, steals the show, however. An Iago type character, he is the epitome of evil. He kills when his own life is not in danger, if we assume that killing is justified if one's life as a hunter of other humans is in jeopardy.<br /><br />If you see this movie in a theatre, try to select one that shows art films. I made the mistake of seeing "No Country For Old Men" in one of those theatres, that run 25 or 30 movies at the same time, situated of course in the obligatory shopping mall. Although there was only a handful of people watching the movie when I saw it, they made up for scarce attendance by laughing through most of the movie as dark and serious as anything I'e seen lately. The couple behind me talked througout the entire film and expressed their surprise and displeasure at the ending. I'd like to see this one again but only when it is released on DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/AW4MT9WP95TVD.html">AW4MT9WP95TVD</a><br/><p>Loved this movie.  It is so beautiful to look at it's amazing.  The actors are uniformly excellent here.  Bardem is a pure evil killing machine and will scare the crap out of you.  It is long, but it pulls you into the story so intently that it feels much shorter than its running time.  The Coens have done it again.</p></br><a href="../users/A39AWL2FKWDFK6.html">A39AWL2FKWDFK6</a><br/><p>Using panoramic Texas and New Mexico scenery as a backdrop Ethan and Joel Coen fabricated a gripping, outstanding adaptation of Cormac MacCarthy's "No Country for Old Men".  Commencing with a monologue about the changing times from weary Texas sheriff Ed Tom Bell played by a craggy and ancient looking Tommy Lee Jones, the film quickly propels into the main storyline.<br /><br />Retired welder and ex-Vietnam vet Llewelyn Moss played by Josh Brolin is out in the desert near the Mexican border, hunting proghorn.  Tracking a wounded animal he comes across a charnel among a convoy of vehicles, a drug deal gone bad with dead bodies and a huge cache of drugs.  He also finds a satchel packed with about 2 million in cash which he is determined to keep.  Almost immediately he is pursued by a monstrous psychopathic killer hired to recover the loot named Anton Chigurh played terrifyingly by Javier Bardem.<br /><br />We first meet a handcuffed Chigurh as he is strangling the deputy who had the misfortune of arresting him, at the police station.  He recovers his possesions, namely a captive bolt pistol or cattlegun, which he uses to kill anyone that gets in his way as he goes rampaging through the countryside.<br /><br />Meanwhile sheriff Bell gets wind of what happened and is trying to get to Moss to protect him by recruiting his wife Carla Jean played by Kelly MacDonald.  Chigurh, however using a transponder hidden in the money is pursuing Brolin through Texas and into Mexico.  The rightful owners of the money also hire bounty hunter and former partner of Chigurh, Carson Wells played comedically by Woody Harrelson.<br /><br />What we have is essentially is a film where everyone is chasing someone or something leaving behind a trail of violence in the wake.<br /><br />The character developement courtesy of the talented Coen's is first rate creating a dichotomy on either side of the spectrum of drugs and violence.  The tired, ready to retire Bell played so effortlessly by Jones can't survive anymore in a word populated by soulless killing machines like Bardem.<br /><br />The truncated ending which may be disturbing at some level leaves open a plethora of possibilities for the analysis of this thought provoking flick.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AYN3IIUNQCIA.html">A1AYN3IIUNQCIA</a><br/><p>Warning: Minor Spoliers<br /><br />For the past three years or so, I have been pretty oppossed to the Academy Awards and their Best Picture winners (the last of which I truley accepted being The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King). Million Dollar Baby was a nice movie, but it didn't stick with me in the long run. Crash was a very mediocre film that only got lucky because of its LA fan base and conservative members (Brokeback Mountain was by far superior and should have won), The Departed was pretty good but not one of my favorites of the whole year, and now, this years winner, No Country for Old Men, has won the award and so naturally, I had to see it. I've obviously heard about the raves this film has been getting, most everyone calling it a masterpiece, saying it was the best film in a long time and picked up almost every single major Best Picture awards. I figured, there must be something about the film thats so great.<br /><br />The film intwertwins three diffrent story lines that all seem to center around a drug deal gone bad. Llewelyn Moss stumbles upon the massacer and along with the huge pile of drugs, finds a suitcase full of money. So naturally, he takes it. Unfortunatly for him, he has just stumbled into a dangerous situation and is now being hunted down by a hired gun name Anton Chigurh, while a local sherrif is right behind them as he tries to piece together the whole crime.<br /><br />For the positives, I definently agree that all the acting was pretty good, Javier Bardem just morphing into a great villian. With steely eyes, cold determination, he's like a walking Reaper, armed with his pressurized gun and killing almost everyone unfortunate to cross his path. Tommy Lee Jones makes the most of his small role while Josh Brolin took me by surprise with his pretty restrained performence and Kelly MacDonald also surprising me with her nice gem of a role. Even Beth Grant does wonders in her role that literally only last for over a minute. So, bravo to the actors.<br /><br />However, and this is the big however, my one big problem with this movie is this. When its all said and done, the film was really just a whole bunch of nothing. Sure, we know there's a drug deal and money and a killer and all that stuff and there was a pretty thrilling scene during the middle but its almost as if the film just obidently trudges on through the film, having its characters do all this stuff and say all these things, and by the end, what does it all add up to? Is it a film about free will? or the after match of violence? is the whole thing about violence? changing times? what was this whole movie about?<br /><br />Now, to put it out, I have never really been a Coen Brothers fan. I just don't get any of there movies. Maybe i'm just the odd one out but I honestly don't see anything when I watch there films. Blood Simple, Fargo, The Big Lebowski, all of those films I just found either very average, completly upsurd, or just plain weird. So even before I was going to view this movie, I already had an idea that this may not live up to all the hype its getting.<br /><br />Another problem I have is with the ending. Now, I don't mind open ended movies. Hell, I think that a film can be superb with an open end. But for me, when the whole thing ended, I really just thought it was almost like a complete waste of my time. Again, the whole ending added up to nothing. I ask you, what was the whole point in the sherrif's ending speech? what significance did it have with the whole of the film? why are we shown Chigurh getting hit by some car at the end? is there something there that I'm not getting? and the whole thing with the sherrif and his uncle, again, what was the whole point of that scene? are we suppose to take notice and say 'yeah, violence, its always going to be there and stuff'. And as for Woody Harrelson, can someone tell me the whole purpose of his role? I mean, did he really had anything to the story? at all?. Basically, in general, were those last 30 minutes or so ABOSULTLY nessesary?<br /><br />I really just think this film is a critics film. Something that all the professionals rave about and absolutly adore and love. But for the general public, it dosen't always translate like that. For people like me, its just a jumble of events that lead to a pretty vacant (and slightly pointless) ending. For others, its a masterpiece of a film and the critics are right to cheer and its one of those films that has to be seen. And for some, they just won't get it at all and leave the theater (or television room) scratching there heads in frustration.<br /><br />In short, No Country for Old Men can arguably be added up to a film about a lot of nothing. For me, a film (no matter how great or bad) has some sort of meaning to its making, some sort of theme that drives it along. But as the credits begin to role and your sitting in your seat wonder 'so what exactly was that all about?', it just seems sort of like a waste of time. For the critics and all those who love this film, thats good for you and obviously you all see something that I'm not seeing. Cause all I see is a film of pointless violence, pointless talk, pointless scenes, and basically a handful of pretty 'decent' moments and great acting, all of which add up to...nothing.<br /><br />I guess I'll have to see what next years Best Picture winner has to offer. Who know's, maybe</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>No Country for Old Men (Joel and Ethan Coen, 2007)<br /><br />The Coen Brothers show, finally, that it is possible to successfully adapt a Cormac McCarthy novel to film. With adaptations of The Road (to be directed by John Hillcoat) and Blood Meridian (to be directed by Ridley Scott) on the horizon, that is quite a comforting thing.<br /><br />The plot, what there is of it, seems to center around Llewellyn Moss (Grindhouse's Josh Brolin), a hunter who stumbles upon the scene of a drug deal gone bad, and walks off with a satchel containing two million dollars. The owners of the money want it back, and so they hire psychotic escaped criminal Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) to track the money and get it back. On the other side of the equation is Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), the sherriff in the district where the drug deal went down, and Carson Wells (Woody Harrelson), an associate of Chigurh's who's a little less nuts, and is willing to let Moss live as long as he hands over the cash.<br /><br />This is a movie that succeeds on so many levels it's scary. Before getting to the obvious, however, the main reason for this movie's success, it seems to me, is the work of cinematographer Roger Deakins, whose use of light and shadow is a character in itself; the light (or lack of same) in this movie is a virtuoso performance, easily on the level of Darius Khondji's work on Se7en or Frank Byers' on Twin Peaks. There are dozens of scenes I could single out (and other critics have, with many of them) to illustrate the greatness to be found in the cinematography here, but one of the scenes that seems, on the surface, pedestrian really blew me away: there's a scene where Moss is in a motel room. He turns off the light, and the drapes are closed, so we see only a thin line of light coming in under the drapes, and all it illuminates is a part of Moss' cowboy hat, sitting on the bed. His hand comes into the light, picks up the hat, and then there's nothing for a few seconds until Moss opens the door and walks out. When was the last time you saw a scene like that in a film? It's gutsy. More to the point, its minimalism offsets the rest of the film, with its glorious over-the-top (and yet disturbingly realistic) violence. The Coens spend two hours putting the pedal to the floor in this movie; even the quiet scenes are tense. And here, in the middle, there's something that really is quiet; it's tense, but it's not "Anton Chigurh is sitting in the chair across from you" tense. Deakins was justly nominated for the Best Cinematography Academy Award, and it will be a crime if he doesn't collect.<br /><br />The movie has also been nominated for seven other Oscars, including Best Picture (and I have to say that it is, far and away, the best film I've seen released in 2007, as of this writing), Best Director, Adapted Screenplay, Editing, Sound, Sound Editing, and Supporting Actor. Odd that only one actor in this flick got an Oscar nod (and that being Javier Bardem, who is racking up ignored Oscar-worthy performances just as fast as Willem Dafoe; Bardem deserves this Oscar, as he has deserved many others, but odds are he won't win), since so many folks in this movie do such an excellent job. Tommy Lee Jones hasn't been this good on a screen in over two decades, and I say this as someone who's loved a lot of the movies he's made in the interim. Harrelson turns in his best performance since Natural Born Killers. Kelly MacDonald, who here plays Moss' clueless wife, is amazing. I've seen her before, but she never really registered with me. Barry Corbin and Trent Moore both have excellent bit parts. Bardem, of course, is always fantastic; there are many movies that are worth seeing just to watch the man act.<br /><br />What is most impressive here, however, despite all the accolades I've heaped on this film (and will continue to heap on it), is that despite the fact that the Coens have made an unflinchingly violent action movie, they have done so in such a way that it is still an absolutely beautiful film. It's pleasing to look at on just about every level.Even the bits that are difficult to watch keep you riveted simply because they're so well-framed and so perfectly shot. This is a movie that commands the attention in ways that very few films do; in fact, off the top of my head, the only movie I can think of that works in the same way is Rampo Noir. A truly amazing piece of work; the Coen Brothers' finest film. And that's saying something. **** ?</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>I am a huge fan of the Coen Brothers, the duo behind such classics as "Fargo", "The Man Who Wasn't There", "Blood Simple" and "Raising Arizona". Their films gleefully mix a sense of humor so dark it could almost be black with whacky, off-center characters who get involved with violent events. When I first heard about "No Country for Old Men", their new film based on a story by Cormac McCarthy, I was intrigued. "Country" appeared to have the same sort of wacky characters they are known for, but without the dark humor, placing these people in a dark, dramatic, violent story.<br /><br />"No Country For Old Men" is even better than I could have imagined. It will be one of the best films of the year.<br /><br />Texas, 1980. Lewellyn Moss (Josh Brolin, "American Gangster") is out hunting when he happens across some blood. Following the trail, he finds the scene of a massacre, a bunch of off-road trucks in a circle, a bunch of dead guys, most of them Latino, and a truck filled with drugs. He continues to look around and finds one of the victims sitting under a tree with a satchel filled with $[...] million sitting at his feet. Lewellyn knows the owner of this money will not simply let the money disappear, but he decides to play the odds and makes off with it. He hides it under his mobile home and tells his wife (Kelly McDonald) she has to go and visit her mother in Odessa. Anton Chiguhr (Javier Bardem) is sent to recover the money and the drugs. Visiting the scene of the crime, he quickly realizes someone else was there and figures out it was Lewellyn. Anton made a commitment to find and recover the money and he will not let anything, repeat anything, stand in the way of his commitment. Soon, he is hounding Lewellyn's every step, using his weapon of choice, a can of pneumatic air and a cattle stun gun to remove any obstacles, including people and locked doors. Sheriff Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) and his deputy (Garrett Dillahunt, "The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford") happen upon the crime scene and also realize Lewellyn was involved, but at this point, they are a few steps behind, so Bell decides to try to contact Lewellyn's wife in Odessa. If it was that easy for Bell to find the wife, you know Chiguhr (mispronounced "Sugar" by more than one person) will have no trouble. Thus begins an intense game of cat and mouse featuring one of the most reprehensible, evil villains I have ever seen on film.<br /><br />"No Country for Old Men" is a violent film, but it seems more violent than it is and that is because of the mesmerizing performance of Javier Bardem. With a fish bowl haircut and a crooked grin complemented by dead eyes, Bardem's Chiguhr is a bit like a flesh and bones version of Schwarzenegger's Terminator. To call Chiguhr human would be wrong; there is nothing in this character that is human. From the moment he escapes custody and dispatches the deputy who has no idea what wrath he has brought upon himself, Chiguhr cuts a swatch across the Texas landscape, all in his quest to retrieve the money for his employer. Using the cattle gun, he leaves no traces of gunpowder or bullets in his victims, leading the authorities to come up with no clues. But worse than that, Chiguhr seems happiest when he is killing people.<br /><br />As he is about to claim a victim, his mouth breaks into a crooked smile and his lifeless eyes attain a little glitter. Worse yet, people seem mesmerized by him and, since he rarely uses a gun or knife, they don't seem to be threatened when he approaches with a large can of compressed air and a cattle gun.<br /><br />As he begins his quest, Chiguhr also realizes this device can be used to get through locks and do so in such a way as to stun the intended victims.<br /><br />As Bardem works to make this character one of the most evil I have ever seen on film, the Coen Brothers do a very smart thing. Both actor and filmmakers have so clearly established the villainy of this character, and the lengths he will go to, that they actually stop showing us the full extent of his acts upon his victims. We know what he is capable of, so when he dispatches one victim, it is enough to see a pool of blood slowly approach his boots. When he leaves another victims house, he checks his boots for blood, signaling to us what has just happened. Just like in the best horror films, our imagination fills in the details in a far scarier and effective way.<br /><br />Josh Brolin is also very good as Lewellyn, a tough guy used to having to work for everything he has, and he doesn't have much. The key to his performance is that he is able to make us believe he might just have a chance against Chiguhr, a remarkable accomplishment given how evil his adversary is. When Lewellyn initially stumbles across the crime scene, he shows us a certain level of smarts, he knows how to check the scene, how to protect himself, what he is looking for. A lot of this must come from his hunting background, as there isn't any indication that he stumbles across a drug deal gone badly every day. When he sees the money, his greed overtakes him and he runs off with it. But he also has the common sense to try to hide it, and not immediately begin spending it, because that would raise too many suspicions in his small community.<br /><br />And Lewellyn also has a conscience leading him to try to help one of the victims. This ultimately leads Chiguhr to him, so this act also leads us to suspect he isn't always the best at making decisions.<br /><br />In a way, the Coen Brothers have returned to their roots with "Country". Much like their brilliant debut "Blood Simple", this new film is pure drama, with a lot of violence, and it also seems to revisit some of the same classic types of situations they tried in their first film. But because they have matured as filmmakers, they have also developed their skills and these scenes are even more powerful. As Chiguhr hunts down Lewellyn, he tracks his prey with steely determination. Lewellyn hides out in an old hotel in a small Texas town. After he checks in, he looks through the bag of money. Soon, he senses something, a presence, and tries to prepare. This begins a chase through the small town with Chiguhr and Lewellyn facing off in the dark, silent town, leaving a few dead in their wake. As I watched, I remembered a similar scene in "Simple" when Ray (John Getz) is trying to outwit Loren (M. Emmett Walsh), the determined private eye, who is a little like Chiguhr-lite. Both scenes are very effective, but well-seasoned filmmakers, confident of their craft and skill, craft "Country". "Simple" is exciting because the filmmakers who made that film were very raw.<br /><br />With all of this madness circulating, much like a hurricane flowing through this Texas landscape, Tommy Lee Jones' Sheriff Bell is the perfect antidote. Calm, seasoned, intelligent, he looks at something and can pretty accurately assess the situation. He and his deputy have amusing conversations, with Bell almost always correctly contradicting his younger deputy's theories. He provides the grounding force to the story.<br /><br />Strangely, Bell is almost immediately able to figure out that Lewellyn was involved in this mess, in some way, but he is now a couple of steps behind the local and his pursuer. He knows he should contact his wife, Carla Jean, and even knows where she probably is, but she doesn't offer any help. So he does the only thing he can do and follows the path of destruction, hoping to eventually cross paths with the two men.<br /><br />Woody Harrelson has a brief turn as a private detective hired by the same people who hired Chiguhr. He sets out to try and persuade Lewellyn to return the money. When Chiguhr finds out someone has been sent to clean up after him, he becomes, shall we say, a little upset.<br /><br />"No Country For Old Men" is a great, great film. There are so many things to like about it, it is impossible to list them all without revealing key moments in the plot. Everything, from the memorable performances, to the storytelling, to the cinematography is outstanding. Javier Bardem's performance won't soon be forgotten. And the fact the Coen Brothers are smart enough to realize that at a certain point, we only need the merest hint of violence to realize Chiguhr has been up to his usual business if particularly impressive. And yet another example of why the film is so effective.</p></br><a href="../users/A9LAPV8XNKZVZ.html">A9LAPV8XNKZVZ</a><br/><p>you may not care for the ending.

It stars Josh Brolin, Tommy Lee Jones and Javier Bardem, and all are excellent in their performances.<br /><br />STORY: Anton Chigurh is a cold blooded killer who would much rather kill people than talk it out with them. Llewyn Moss is a person who finds some dead bodies in a desert and some money, along with a heroin stash. Llewyn takes the satchel and flees with it, not knowing that he's being tracked by Anton. As soon as he finds out he's being tracked, worlds collide!<br /><br />THOUGHTS: Amazing movie!!!! I saw it down in Ontario visiting family, and we loved it. Why is it rated 18A here and 14A there???? It's not that violent!!!!!!!<br /><br />Anyway, great movie, and I hope to see it again!</p></br><a href="../users/A3PQ3K5RKNJYA1.html">A3PQ3K5RKNJYA1</a><br/><p>Okay, so I don't understand the Coen brothers crap that they give to Hollywood. I still don't see why Tommy Lee Jones was even cast in this movie. Yeah, yeah....old men, times change, people change; and all that rubbish.<br /><br />The story was really about Josh Brolin (Llewelyn) who stumbles upon an a large amount of cash from an aborted drug deal gone bad between a bunch of dealers and buyers (everyone's dead on the scene, except one guy in a truck - he's later killed. But not by Brolin). And the Psycho killer, Anton (Javier Bardem) who goes around capping off people shooting bolts into their foreheads, or blowing them away with a suppressed shotgun (right) in his attempts to recover the cash that Llewelyn has taken. Anton acts like sort of an automaton throughout the movie. Sometimes flipping a coin to see if he'll take the life of his next victim (the victim is supposed to "call it". Uh-boy.<br /><br />Leewelyn's girlfriend, Carla Jean (played by Kelly MacDonald) was a really annoying stereotype of "trailer trash," with a double-digit I.Q. to boot. Seemingly spaced-out and unable to do any thinking on her own. Or maybe it was because she was so used to taking orders from Llewelyn (who cares).<br /><br />Woody Harrelson plays a short part (that's right, he gets blown away by Anton) hunting Anton and trying to get the money back from Llewelyn without really wanting to kill him.<br /><br />Tommy Lee Jones goes about the movie blabbering lines and contemplating this and that....oh my gosh, you really have to be into this existential garbage that the actors are attempting to convey to the audience. I got it - it was just plain stupid.<br /><br />The killer gets away in the next to the last scene. And then we see good 'ol Ed Tom who blathering to his wife about a dream. Oh, help me. I can see why it grossed ONLY $74 mil. With the exception of the shootout between Anton and Llewelyn - Bad movie. Lousy Movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1RSXP7MB772E3.html">A1RSXP7MB772E3</a><br/><p>Too often I get burnt in forums like these for expressing my opinions when they are starkly against what the majority think.

I make my statement true to how I feel.<br />This movie stunk. I loved certain elements, but like all the great one's say, a movie is great not from segmented pieces but by the whole. It has all the makings of an indie film, which is my kind of movie. I've lived in Art houses every since 2005 with a history of violence. I love the tame and mature approach to revealing a movie. I get the sense that the aim of this movie was to produce such dramatic, theatric sadness that we couldn't handle seeing the reality of the ending. That this is no country indeed for old men, or for the matter, any men or women. Now what I'm about to say does not apply to every genre, but please: Movies are different from books not just on the intellectual approach, but also in that the power of certain cinema features it is indeed what you see that bares its most powerful infliction. Seeing is believing and to think that such an ending, almost Saprano's like, could settle such a furiously showcased film is implausible for me. It felt abandoning. A few exhasperated speeches by a Sheriff beyond his capabilities in dealing with reality and a criminal psychopath preoccupied with unknown thoughts. That's what there is, and no matter what your preception clearly that is the point, it is up to great discussion. But for me, that discussion is short lived because I save my great discussions for politics and greater films.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MNMZMM6BGLTA.html">A2MNMZMM6BGLTA</a><br/><p>Top to bottom a great movie with no weakness'.<br /><br />Call it.</p></br><a href="../users/A100JCBNALJFAW.html">A100JCBNALJFAW</a><br/><p>a very well done film filled with thrills and great acting.<br />coen bros have done it again! another soon to be classic.<br />in my mind this is in my top 5 of 07.<br />you will either love it or hate.</p></br><a href="../users/ARA48345JZPZR.html">ARA48345JZPZR</a><br/><p>There are no easy answers supplied in the Coen's adaptation of Comac McCarthy's bleak and unyielding No Country for Old Men, which while commendable for the film's integrity will likewise make it difficult viewing for a general public.  This is a lean and hard tale rendered in spare and uncompromised terms and it refuses to follow whatever direction you might assume it's going.  Stubbornly original and true to its despairing view, this is challenging film work that disobeys the rules and conventions of the genre that encapsulates it.<br /><br />Dominating the film is Javier Bardem's eerie hired killer as remorseless and unrelenting malevolence personified.  There is a tangible sense of dread whenever he is on screen, which is a good deal of the time, and his detached and bemused lethality is both chilling and the perfect metaphor for the anguish over lost values and decency that is at the heart of the film.  Here is total savagery, ruthlessly walking amongst the sane and the civil, unbridled and uncontrollable and impervious to mitigation, negotiation, reason or mercy.  It is a frightening portrait of the violent insanity of our times.<br /><br />And it is the insanity of our times that overwhelms the other characters we come to know.  Josh Brolin's tough Viet Nam vet, stubbornly trying to reverse his hard luck and bring a bit of ease to his sweet wife, nicely played by Kelly MacDonald , with dirty money chanced-upon.  And even more essentially, Tommy Lee Jones' honest and savvy sheriff, dazed and bewildered by the vanishing values of his West Texas heritage and the seemingly bottomless degrees of violence and degradation that have infiltrated and threaten to subsume the world left him by his lawmen grandfather and father.<br /><br />The film bears all the trademarks of the Coen brothers best works:  a tight and lean script; beautiful and essential cinematography from Roger Deakins; wonderful lead characters and great care in the casting of all supporting parts; occasional dark gallows humor; spare and meticulous dialogue; and artful and judicious depictions of unspeakable violence.  Their great craft is evident throughout.<br /><br />Finally, this is a film that is unrelievedly bleak and despairing in its vision and at its heart.  There are no compromises made and no reassuring answers supplied.  In the long coda that ends the film, does Tommy Lee Jones supply a glimmer of hope that light will be found in the darkness, or is he once again simply offering a sad requiem for the lost simple decencies of our fathers?  You decide.  This is superb film-making for those willing to be challenged.</p></br><a href="../users/A14Q6R4481YFFG.html">A14Q6R4481YFFG</a><br/><p>To tell the truth, I was a little disappointed in Sheriff Bell.  No one forced him to become a lawman, to confront evil as a business.  I don't mind the movie's post-modernism (evil sometimes triumphs) or its existentialism (things happen randomly) but the lack of professionalism is just unacceptable.*<br /><br />Anyhow, a good movie if you like the genre, or the Coen Brothers.  It's got a lot of Fargo in it, a lot of Blood Simple too.  But it's its own thing.<br /><br />*  I do recognize the fact that a professionalism is necessarily a belief in duty, and postmordernism would posit that a belief in duty (e.g., Marshall Kane in "High Noon") is pointless or even should be attacked as outmoded, not useful and superstitious.  Postmodernists are a grim bunch.</p></br><a href="../users/A1SVXJZ3386U2D.html">A1SVXJZ3386U2D</a><br/><p>After a steady diet of older movies and foreign movies, I rented a recent American release; "No Country for Old Men".  My initial reaction was one of emotional exhaustion.  This movie held me at the edge of my seat from beginning to end but gave me nothing that I could hold on to.  To elaborate more might spoil part of the effect of "No Country for Old Men" and I guess I benefitted from being totally unaware of what was going to happen next throughout the whole movie.  Therefore, without discussing the plot in any detail, what makes this an excellent film?<br /><br />"No Country for Old Men" has many strong attributes including a constant onslaught of dramatic action and suspense.  We start out with a situation that demands explanation and we are constantly confronted by successive scenarios that demands explanation and/or resolution.  The cinematography, at times, was brilliant.  However, for me, the key to "No Country for Old Men" is the casting and that includes top billing to honorable mention.  Woody Harrelson seemed to not fit the bill until I realized that he was everything his character was supposed to be (including being somewhat cocky and obnoxious).  My nominee for the Best Supporting Actor was the guy at the gas station.  That was another one of those scenes in which had several possible outcomes and it was this guy who made the scene such a memorable one.<br /><br />The problem with the movie, for me, was What are we supposed to get out of it????  Evil reigns supreme???  The ending underscored the lack of any coherence.  What was that all about???  I realize that there is a connection to the film's title but that would be either too shallow for what we had just seen or too distracting.  I guess the key to all this munderstanding is to remember the producers.</p></br><a href="../users/AE9GUE3HHOX3U.html">AE9GUE3HHOX3U</a><br/><p>I don't know what went wrong.  I thought this was a no brainer (no pun intended).  I almost bought it without seeing it first. Thank goodness for $1.00 rentals. "No Country For Old Men" (what does that mean anyways?) didn't live up to my expectations.  Because I love "Fargo" and "The Man Who Wasn't There", I thought this latest installment of a Coen Brothers film would blow me away.  The film just got too evil for me and too creepy.  The characters were bizarre and reprehensible so I wasn't too interested in the story that went along with it.  I like Josh Brolin, he was the best part of the movie for me.  Javier Bardem's character just creeped me out in a bad way, maybe it was the hair, who knows.  The quirkiness of The Coen Brothers films was missing here and when the characters tried to be quirky, it didn't work in that genuine way.  Like why the scene with the teenage boys selling their shirt?  That scene was borderline inappropriate, like we need to see a shirtless teenage boy, the movie could of done without.  The scenes with Tommy Lee Jones bored me to tears and then out of nowhere the movie stopped.  Credits rolled and I just chalked it up as a loss.  Very dissapointed. Now I wish Hal Holbrook would have won the oscar for supporting actor, and "There Will Be Blood" or "Into The Wild" should have won for best picture.  No country for me, I'll leave it at that.</p></br><a href="../users/A38DQCCC64K4W.html">A38DQCCC64K4W</a><br/><p>I know that many of today's movie goers get bored if there isn't some huge action scene every 10 minutes; The latest Coen venture is all about tension, followed by sudden and unexpected bursts of violence. It's all about a situation you know isn't good for anyone, the people involved, and the places it takes them. No, there aren't any huge explosions or 20 minute shoot-outs. But you have an ensemble cast that sucks you in, a flawless screenplay adaptation(inc. some of the best dialog in recent memory....), and some beautiful desert settings.  It's brutal and relentless, yet it's a film that has you thinking days after it's over.  And while many had a problem with the ending, I don't think it could have ended any other way.  I have read a lot of reviews that called this movie 'boring'. Personally, I can't understand that. I was never bored, and when it was over I watched it again.  Fans of true-to-life crime will find this to be an incredible film. There's a reason it won best picture. And Javier Bardem is the best criminal psycho since Samuel Jackson in 'Pulp Fiction'. This movie is the real deal, made by people who know what they're doing and have a love for making movies that matter.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>No Country for Old Men is a great movie.

Heck, even all the little side character seemed very natural, like they weren't even acting. I did have a few problems with the abrupt ending, but the movie as a whole fit together just right.<br /><br />I see why the critics are raving, and if you haven't already, you should see too.<br /><br />4 and 1/2 out of 5 stars</p></br><a href="../users/A3B87UZLPCF0HW.html">A3B87UZLPCF0HW</a><br/><p>Adaptation of acclaimed author Cormac McCarthy's novel, it tells the story of a hunter (Brolin) who stumbles across several corpses, a dying Mexican, $2 million cash and a stash of heroin near the Rio Grande.

The DVD transfer is excellent and there are some interesting extras.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JV4QKTEB7QBL.html">A1JV4QKTEB7QBL</a><br/><p>From the first few minutes of Joel and Ethan Coen's film adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's novel, "No Country for Old Men," I was hooked.  The opening scenes of the Texas hill country vaguely remind me of the golden beauty of Tuscany--a wild starkness sans the cypress trees that suggests the purity and serenity of an open landscape where from the beginning of time, men roamed simply because they wanted to and could. These men learned to manage not only the land--making it work for them in a symbiotic way where neither was destroyed and a careful reverent balance was maintained--but also and more importantly controlled the insidious evil that unfurled within this domain since the snake slithered into the Garden of Eden. As one of the triumvirate of main characters, Anton Chigurh, played with a succinct and taciturn cruelty by Javier Bardem, proves as he strangles his arresting officer with the very cuffs meant to restrain him, now darkness pervades; moral stability still lives on, albeit conditioned by what is thought to be lackadaisically acceptable for "modern" times.  Most definitely, the delicate balance once barely managed has spiraled out of the control of its sentinels.<br /><br />But what can be done about this rampant evil?  Nothing much, it seems.  We are damned if we do, and damned if we don't.<br /><br />In "No Country for Old Men," the inundation of evil (call it corruptness, depravity, immorality . . .whatever) that began with less dramatically insistent indicators like the absence of manners--no longer requiring the respectful usage of `sir' and `ma'am'--or the breakdown of appropriate dress--eyesores like wearing green hair and piercing bones in one's nose--has accelerated to an intensity level where drug deals, bloody carnage and murders are commonplace.  The infringement of this darker tolerance brings with it a Pandora's box of latter day plagues that symbolically battle-worn lawmen like Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) attempt to clamp shut--with limited success.  One gets the sense of an overwhelming encroachment of all things bad--things that after awhile seem tame only through the conditioning of what we are told is acceptable.  Indeed, Bell knows that monsters like Chigurh are legion; wearing a marked world-weary grimace of frustration and futility on his face, he regrets, as his retirement looms, that time has outdated his methods and has matured him into the role of commentator rather than activator.  His hopes and aspirations lie now only in a field of dreams in which he must eventually awaken.<br /><br />In sharp contrast to Bell's caricature of the quintessential onlooker, Vietnam vet Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin)--his brash economy of motion belies his way lesser rank in the war between good and evil stalks the Texas hills with the easy nonchalant grace of the antelope he hunts.  Happening upon a drug deal gone wrong and the ultimate riches-of-the-city temptation--a valise filled with money that could enrich his life with his pretty little wife (Kelly Macdonald) 2.4 million-fold, he catapults into a plan that Sheriff Bell realizes from afar will take him down.  Most of the film's action follows Moss as he attempts to outsmart the devil incarnate (the tenacious Bardem sporting a haircut reminiscent of a dark-side 70s Gerard Depardieu and his weapon of choice--a nasty little dehumanizing compressed-air-mechanized stun gun used to kill cattle.)  Minor characters pop up like targets in an arcade shooting game--mere examples of the genuine coldness of this killer and the Coen brothers' penchant for over-the-top, gory, eye-popping brutality that almost desensitizes the audience like an overexposure to the horrific behavior of Hannibal Lecter in the three Thomas Harris inspired films.<br /><br />Not only do the Coen brothers enjoy a good blood bath, they take pleasure in bitter twists of irony.  Greed motivates the good guy--Moss fights tooth and nail to keep tainted money and jeopardize his wife's security--while a bald honesty holds bad guy Chigurh in check; the strange Anton allows his victims a choice by which he religiously stands.  Oddly, for him, a promise made becomes a promise kept.<br /><br />In terms of performance, the workings of all three of the major roles here border on what seems an effortless genius.  In particular, Bardem enthralls each and every time he enters a scene wielding that oxymoronic brand of macabre attraction and repulsion is reminiscent of Anthony Hopkin's skill in portraying the murderous cannibal in "The Silence of the Lambs." Brolin forges headfirst--his would-be sheep-for-the-slaughter a veritable thinking machine of non-stop action.  Jones brings all his wryness to this role--the character Bell seems written specifically to display the adeptness of his acting ability.<br /><br />Bottom line?  "No Country for Old Men" is not intended for a general audience--so parents think twice about bringing children into the theatre to see this one.  The images of bloody brutality come swiftly with little warning--I spent much of the time squeezing my eyes shut to avoid the virtual spatter of blood.  Otherwise, the film, seemingly an allegory for the eternal battle between good and evil extends beyond the obvious clouding over with nihilistic predetermination while presenting a world where conditioning to the nastier aspects of life renders all that blood-letting mere accoutrements meant to entertain rather than horrify.  Fascinating and highly recommended.<br />Diana Faillace Von Behren<br />"reneofc"</p></br><a href="../users/A39IBJB2PBVC7I.html">A39IBJB2PBVC7I</a><br/><p>When an A student comes home with a C- it's a lot more disappointing than when a C student comes home with a D.  From the very beginning, the Coen brothers have been in my personal pantheon of favorite writer/directors - even their failures are better than the successes of lesser practitioners.  Coen brother films could be relied upon for sturdy craftsmanship, memorable characters, keen intelligence, dry - even lethal - wit, and the ability to dance easily between the absurd and the vividly authentic.  Even lesser films like The Big Lebowski (very dumb) and O Brother, Where Art Thou? (ham-fisted) stood head and shoulders above everyday Hollywood fare.  That's why it's so ironic the Academy swooned over NCFOM, the worst movie these two prodigies have produced.<br /><br />Unlike so many of their contemporaries, the Coen brothers never succumbed to the style-over-content trap - until now.  For them, character always drove plot, protagonists were interesting and well drawn - not to say quirky.  The gushing over this film's first act, with its lovely desert footage, elegant pacing, and atmosphere - conveniently glosses over the complete lack of action - or point.  Llewelyn Moss, Josh Brolin, stumbles over a drug deal gone bad and unwisely takes the money he finds. (Brolin is actually quite good as a doomed idiot.)  This act prompts what some would describe as action, or story.  Tommy Lee Jones essentially channels himself as aging Sheriff, Ed Tom Bell.  While his hangdog expression - painted on a face resembling 40 miles of bad road - "says" that the violence of this day is beyond his comprehension, the story does not.  That's a pity - since that is allegedly the film's theme.  TLJ moping doth not a movie make.<br /><br />Coen brothers films are always characterized by black comedy - think back to the white glove and knife in Blood Simple.  One must wonder what happened to their sense of humor.  NCFOM is devoid of irony, wit, or even the ability to poke fun at its own pompousness.  Woody Harrelson's pointless stroll through the scenery might have been intended as funny, I hope not; it's dreary filler that arrives when the film is already dragging.  More egregious still is the body count.  The Coen brothers have certainly killed off quite a few characters over the years, but in the past there was always a reason, it was integral to the plot.  The killing in NCFOM is relentless, pointless, and repulsive.  Apologists would say; this IS the point, the merciless, unending nature of violence.  My response is that this is a movie, not a philosophical debate.  The moment you have symbols instead of protagonists, you're in trouble.<br /><br />Which brings us inevitably to Anton Chigiurh, played by Javier Bardem.  Mr. Bardem must get points for not giggling while sporting his ludicrous haircut.  But the Academy was just flat-out wrong.  His character is one-dimensional and his performance is one-dimensional - at least Bergman had the creativity to put Death in a Speedo and cape.  The celebrated "coin-toss" scene is indeed wonderful, but it's a very small moment of excellence in a large, arid landscape.  O Coen Brothers, Where Art Thou?</p></br><a href="../users/A13IKSGDYNBNQS.html">A13IKSGDYNBNQS</a><br/><p>I haven't read the book which this is based on. Other reviewers have indicated it is a masterpiece. If it is, then so is this brilliant film version. What the Coen brothers have done here is make a film that is completely different from mainstream Hollywood, and so far above the mainstream in terms of quality that it makes you wonder how Hollywood manages to survive with some of the rubbish it produces. There is no comparison you can make with mainstream Hollywood. Really you have to look to European cinema to find films made in the similar style.<br /><br />It revolves around a drugs deal that goes wrong, and mainly follows two characters: Moss who finds the money associated with the deal and the other man wants it back. The second man is psychopathic killer called Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) who in his relentless pursuit kills anything and anyone who gets in his way. Sometimes this is just for fun and he tosses a coin to decide the victims fate. Another unusual aspect of this killer, is the main weapon he uses which is a cattle gun which is fired by compressed air. Not the most convenient of weapons but very effective. In pursuit of both men is Sheriff Bell, played by Tommy Lee Jones. He is really out of his depth. The title of the film is a direct reference to him as far as I can make out.<br /><br />The Coen brothers film all this in their unique style, with their slightly odd take on the world. However unlike probably all their previous films, this one does not contain much, if any elements of black comedy. Another very unusual aspect to this film is the almost complete absence of a music soundtrack in the film. All the more surprising then when at one point in the film Moss wakes up to find a group of Mexican singers serenading him.<br /><br />In terms of their previous films this is closest to Blood Simple, but its a much better film than their debut. In fact if I see a better film this year I'll be very surprised.</p></br><a href="../users/AJRFZ0VZ0LD26.html">AJRFZ0VZ0LD26</a><br/><p>Texas heat and a slew of shady characters ornament this movie. As main character Moss runs into mess of human and canine bodies and finds $2MM drug money during his hunting trip, we get to see the determination of the former Vietnam vet to turn the life of his family around once he has a full possesion of his money. As he tries to avoid drug dealers, former special operations soldiers and a serial killer he gets on to fight for his life as if he is back in the war fields.  We track him pacing between US and Mexican border, beaten, battered and wounded attempting with all his might to preserve the money he found in order to ensure a better life for himself and his wife.  Javier Bardem plays a killer who kills indiscriminately everyone on his path.  He needs no other reason to kill them but the fact that people see his face or loose the coin toss bet to dispose of them.  He fights by the principals that are stronger money, power or any other values we are used to.  He makes his own rules.  Ending is somewhat unexpected, but than again this is a Coen Brothers' movie and they have their own way of presenting reality to their audience.  I expected more from this movie.  Josh Brolin shines in his role of a vietnam veteran and so does Tommy Lee Jones in his role of the tired police sheriff.</p></br><a href="../users/A2QHM5HBSIXRL4.html">A2QHM5HBSIXRL4</a><br/><p>I had read Cormac McCarthy's book upon its original paperback release.  Like many, I looked forward to the movie...especially after learning that long-time personal favorite Javier Bardem would play Anton Chigurh.  He didn't disappoint.  I thought both he and Josh Brolin were outstanding.  And, no doubt Ed Tom Bell could have been written with Tommy Lee Jones and his now-patented world-weariness in mind.<br /><br />The Coen Brothers' adaptation excels in clarifying some of the narrative of McCarthy's work.  The writer's prose is so terse at times that I had trouble following who was providing what side of a conversation.  The movie also firmly sets the action in the early 80s, thanks to cars, clothes and Bardem's god-awful haircut.  Also, the staging of the aftermath of the bloodbath in the desert is brilliant.  It captures the bleak, spooky, riveting and ultimately fateful nature of Llewelyn Moss's (Brolin) chance discovery in the desolate outskirts of a small west Texas town (hello, Marfa, TX!).<br /><br />All that aside, I enjoyed <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00121QGPY">Michael Clayton (Widescreen Edition)</a> even more.  I thought it was the best thing I saw in 2007.

Based on Cormac McCarthy's novel, this existential modern-day western features knockout performances by Tommy Lee Jones, Josh Brolin and Javier Bardem (a classic villain despite the Beatle haircut). Though excessively violent, the movie provides a disturbing meditation on uncompromised evil within its cat-and-mouse framework. When the Coens go full throttle, the results are exhilarating. However, Joel and Ethan occasionally stumble in their over-faithfulness to McCarthy's source material. Another misstep is the needless subplot involving Woody Harrelson's sharp-dressed bounty hunter. Kelly Macdonald, on the other hand, makes the most of her limited screen time as Brolin's devoted wife.

The plot is loosely based on "A Simple Plan" in which someone finds some drug money by chance, and intent on keeping this, puts himself and his family in danger. The way in which the story is told owes much to Pulp Fiction, with several groups of characters who never meet each other, or whom only do so en passant. Likewise, there is a debt owed to Psycho; where the audience is wrong-footed into thinking that one character is the star of the film, only to have that character give way to another person part way through the film. The Coen brothers go one better than Hitchcock, however, and have a third good guy (Woody Harrelson from Cheers) take over halfway through, only to be blown to bits a short while later.<br /><br />There is some controversy over whether this is a western. It's debatable, but my vote goes to "yes". There's classic western themes of good against bad, people both good and bad operating outside the law, a law which proves ineffectual due to the huge extent of gun ownership, the setting on the Tex-Mex border, the scene with horses, and the white cowboy hats worn by all four of the principle good guys. There's even an "old timer" there to tell tales and give advice.<br /><br />In contrast to the white hat-wearers, Chiguhr, Javier Bardem's baddie wears only black for most of the film(in fact it has to be said, he has a very gay sense of style, from his hair, to his cropped jacket and tight buttock-revealing trousers...notably he only seems to be enjoying himself when on the floor strangling a policeman who is lying on top of him in a very homoerotic fashion). The star of the film is undoubtedly this villain, the peculiar looking and acting Javier Bardem, and he has a truth to his character consitent with his zealous belief in principles. His callousness might seem unbelievable, but it's clear that this is an instinct which ensures his survival at times when lesser baddies fall by the wayside. He is consistent, whereas the good people are inconstant, lose concentration, or make unnecessary allowances.<br /><br />Josh Brolin plays the everyman character who finds the money, being a resourceful Vietnam veteran with McGuyver-like skills at making things, now making a meagre living and living in a trailer home. He's likeable despite being trigger happy and a little amoral at times.<br /><br />Tommy Lee Jones's Sherrif decides to retire BEFORE he gets old, having found many old men killed during the course of his investigation (hence the title). By contrast, women don't come off very well in this film. It's almost irrelevant whether the main female character lives or dies (it's not shown), and most women are either there as support for men, a nagging mother-in-law, or harridan-like gate-keepers. Only the final scene of Kelly MacDonald's character Carla, shows her to have any character, and in this one scene she does what no man has done before; she refuses to play Chiguhr's game. How this is resolved isn't seen on screen, but it's interesting that no women are seen to be killed in this movie.<br /><br />In contrast to Pulp Fiction, the film benefits from the minimalist score. There's no sweeping James Horner strings or Danny Elfman cellos here. The sound is presented as though it's all naturalistic, for example the first ten minutes or so are accompanied only by the sound of the wind, giving the impression of the stark, desolate landscape much better than a score could ever do.<br /><br />Apart from Brolin and Jones, the film is cast mainly with lesser-known actors who all put in competent performances, leading us to concentrate on the duels and gun battles between the four main characters. Although there isn't a normal resolution to the film, it does seem quite satisfying at the end that Jones's character is still alive, even though he doesn't succeed in capturing Chiguhr.<br /><br />I would recommend this film to anyone who likes Pulp Fiction, Westerns, and intelligent cinema.</p></br><a href="../users/AW99SBGWEXP0J.html">AW99SBGWEXP0J</a><br/><p>Anton Chigurh (Bardem) is a serial killer, wandering Texas and killing indiscriminately.  The only thing likely to help one win an encounter with him is winning a coin toss.  He is cold blooded and merciless.  Moss (Brolin), a welder on a hunting trip, stumbles upon a bunch of dead bodies, a truck full of "Mexican brown" and a suitcase full of money - all that remains of a drug deal gone bad.  He takes the cash and runs, but somebody else wants the money.  Sheriff Bell (Jones) is the sheriff in the county where Chigurh escapes and where the drug deal went down.  They are all on a collision course, and not all of them will be left standing when all is said and done.<br /><br />"No Country For Old Men" is non-stop relentlessness from beginning to end.  The story is great, full of twists that are not at all predictable.  The acting is top notch, especially Bardem, whose Chigurh is a terrifying, remorseless killer.  He is not someone you would ever want to run into.  The direction by the Coen Brothers is some of the best of their careers.  This film is a definite Oscar contender on many fronts, and I highly recommend it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TPW86OHXTXFC.html">A1TPW86OHXTXFC</a><br/><p>"Misguided souls will tell you that No Country for Old Men is out for blood, focused on vengeance and unconcerned with the larger world outside a standard-issue suspense plot. Those people, of course, are deaf, dumb and blind to anything that isn't spelled out between commercials on dying TV networks. McCarthy reveals a soulless America that is no country for anyone, never mind old men." Peter Travers<br /><br />Cormac McCarthy's book from whence this film came is a masterpiece. The Coen Bros. have done homage to McCarthy. Not much, if anything veered from the original manuscript. Magnificent is how I would describe this film. The characters were all as I pictured in my mind. Tommy Lee Jones as Sheriff Ed Tom Bell is the hard nosed, difficult to please but compassionate codger he was meant to be.  He knows the country is in trouble- drugs have taken over his West Texas area and nothing but trouble is to come.<br /><br />Trouble comes by the dozen and before too many scenes there are blood, bones and bodies strewn throughout the landscape. The man who has caused this massacre is Anton Chigurh, played by Javier Bardem. And by the way Mr Bardem won an Oscar for his portrayal. When you think of the worst of the worst there is Chigurh. Probably the most heinous killer in filmdom history. He likes to play games and will flip a coin for your life.  Something went wrong with one of his drug deals and all were killed and the money and drugs are gone.  Llewellyn Moss played brilliantly by Josh Brolin finds the money and the drugs and all Hell is about to break loose for the man.<br /><br />From one horrendous scene to the next, we sit on tenterhooks, holding our breath while Chigurh and Moss play cat and mouse. Action aplenty. Words of wisdom and grief from Sheriff Bell and his crew. The scenery, the photography, the score are all brilliant. Kelly MacDonald who plays Moss's wife and is an absolute smash I remembered from the BBC series "State of Play'.<br /><br />"Still, if "No Country for Old Men" were a simple face-off between the sheriff's goodness and Chigurh's undiluted evil, it would be a far stiffer, less entertaining picture. Llewellyn is the wild card -- a good old boy who lives on the borderline between good luck and bad, between outlaw and solid citizen -- and Mr. Brolin is the human center of the movie, the guy you root for and identify with even as the odds against him grow steeper by the minute. And the minutes fly by, leaving behind some unsettling notions about the bloody, absurd intransigence of fate and the noble futility of human efforts to master it. Mostly, though, "No Country for Old Men" leaves behind the jangled, stunned sensation of having witnessed a ruthless application of craft." A.O. Scott<br /><br />The best film of the year and it garnered an Oscar. Well deserved, the film was everything it should have been and more. Cormac McCarthy has been honored.<br /><br />Highly, Highly Recommended.  prisrob  04-13-08<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F8O2QU">The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0011V7PSC">In the Valley of Elah</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V3JGII">Coen Brothers Gift Set (Fargo / Miller's Crossing / Barton Fink / Raising Arizona / Blood Simple)</a></p></br><a href="../users/ATXL536YX71TR.html">ATXL536YX71TR</a><br/><p>Amazon asks us "Do we love,like,feel okay,dislike or hate " a film.They are ALL subjective terms.It leaves room for personal taste and interpretation.So,this will be a very tough and,I am sure,unpopular OPINION of mine,but here goes...<br /><br />I thoroughly disliked this film.The story offered nothing to me.I did not find it at all interesting.I did not care for any character.I found them all to be lacking in every sense of human dignity.I found the killing numbing.This film made me feel like Anton-cold and lifeless inside.I did not find it suspenseful.Each murder made me feel as though," Oh well,just another day at the office!"I really just wanted the film to end.The slow moving and exacting pace of the film was not to my liking,especially without any viable soundtrack.The film was very devoid of colors other than the browns and tans of desert and paneled motel rooms.The film had little dialogue.I did not like FARGO,so I suppose that the Coen Brothers are just not my style...but I can understand other people liking their films.<br /><br />What I did like was the way in which the film was cleverly cut in order to show the movements of Brolin,Bardem and Jones.It allowed the story to see all of the actions going on in each character.Still...not enough to hold my interest.<br /><br />There was one continuity error that glared at me which was The Regal Motel offered "Free HBO" on it's sign.Nope....not in 1980 it didn't.Check your facts.<br /><br />Javier Bardem was the only reason that I went to see this film.I love his work.Not even he could save it for me.It was fun to see Scottish actress Kelly Mac Donald play a Texas wife.That was unique.I'll be in the minority on this one.Here come the "not helpful votes"....Ahhhhhhhhhhhh.....</p></br><a href="../users/A5TZXWU8AALIC.html">A5TZXWU8AALIC</a><br/><p>Skimming through all of the other reviews, it appears that whether this movie is rated highly or not everyone agrees that it begins really strong but loses steam about 2/3 of the way through.<br /><br />I enjoyed the film...but you can put me in that category as well.<br /><br />The first half is some of the Coen Brothers' best filmmaking.  The actors are particularly strong in their roles and the storytelling is lean and driven.  Javier Bardem makes the movie, portraying the unstoppable "ghost" (not a literal one but something an old law man likens him to) always one step behind everyone...or ahead of them.  Everyone else you get a good sense of, but this guy you'd like to see more of, like to try to understand more.<br /><br />But the last section of the film isn't as tight and seamless as the first half.  To open a story so well with so little exposition and dialogue, the filmmakers leave us with a unsensational downer ending that looks (sorry) sloppy and undeveloped.<br /><br />Still, a great movie, but--in a weird way--like THE BIG LEBOWSKI: fascinating characters, excellent scenes, compellingly watchable...but uneven.</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>This was a 5 star movie the first half.  Things didn't run as perfectly the second half, but it is still an outstanding picture.  The desolation and bleakness is overwhelming at times, as is the extreme violence that explodes on the screen.  Based on the Cormac Mccarthy novel, this is a wonderful cinematic experience.  Great acting from top to bottom, this is a film I will buy the day it is released on dvd.  Though it is dark, there are a couple of quirky scenes which make you laugh.  The only problem I see for people is the ending.  This isn't a typical hollywood ending.  All of the loose ends are not tied up and everyone goes home feeling good.  I am looking forward to listening to the commentary while watching the movie to get a better insight on some scenes.  This is a must buy.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZBOBV9H1HDV.html">A3LZBOBV9H1HDV</a><br/><p>"No Country For Old Men" is brilliant! This is how the story goes: Violence and mayhem ensue after a hunter stumbles upon some dead bodies, a stash of heroin and more than $2 million in cash near the Rio Grande. The cast led by Tommy Lee Jones (excellent as Sheriff Ed Tom Bell), Javier Bardem (chillingly brilliant as Anton Chigurh), and Josh Brolin (impressive as Llewelyn Moss) is brilliant! The screenplay (based on Cormac McCarthy's novel), directing and film editing (under the name Roderick Jaynes) by Joel And Ethan Coen (who also wrote and directed "O Brother, Where Are Thou?"

This is the best film of the year, so far, even though, the year is almost up. All three of the performances by Jones, Brolin, and especially Bardem, who gives the best performance of his career thus far, as does Brolin and Jones. The Coens, Bardem and Bardem's co-stars should be remembered when Oscar nominations and Oscar night roll around. This is the Coen Brothers' best film of the career, even ahead of "Fargo" and "Blood Simple". This is a well-crafted thriller that will keep you thinking and wanting you to see it again.

He finds a suitcase of money, and decides to just take the money and run.  He lives in a trailer with a young wife, and realizes they are both at risk when he takes the $2 million for himself.<br /><br />Heading the drug-related transaction, Anton Chigurh, is the psychopathic killer and on Moss' trail like a hound dog.  He has no empathy, just dispassionately kills almost every person involved in his hunt for the money.  Moss tries to keep one step ahead of the bloodbaths, but Chigurh is relentless.<br /><br />Sheriff Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) sees the enormity of the crimes, and understands the growing intensity of the pursuit.  He is smart, but realistic.  He is also soon to be retired.<br />From the beginning, the Sheriff tries to convince Moss, through his wife, Carla Jean, that he should turn the money over to authorities.  He has a bad feeling this is ending in tragedy.<br /><br />In the end, the cat and mouse game is between Tom and Anton.  Tom goes to a hotel room (behind the crime scene yellow tape) where the assassin waits.  Chigurh has shot the lock cylinder out, indicating to Ed that it's Chigurh's doing, and both of them watch the other's movement in the reflection in the shiny lock tube. Ed Tom draws his pistol and enters for a search, and realizes the killer is still within, given the locked window in the far room.<br /><br />The ending surprises you, no matter what you think is going to happen.....

This could pass time but it has no social redeeming value. All there is is violence for violence sake and then maybe not for that.  Dogs get shot and we have to drive in 80's vehicles.<br /><br />The actors must have been hard up for a film to make. Same people are major ascots and all I can think is that someone must have had something on them because you could not pay them enough to compromise their career.<br /><br />It is the primitive pre-cell 80's. The unsuspecting good greedy victim was decided to be made a two true Vietnam (60's) person; this is supposed to make him cunning and maybe dangerous.  I spent two tours and I am anything but cunning or dangerous. And I never saw a Remington 700BDL (designed for snipers.)  Not saying they did not exist but we did things the old fission way with M14's (No bolts) accurate enough for Government work.<br /><br />On the plus side is that the Texas country was beautiful and Tommy Lee Jones can still make an interesting face.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000640SB">Men in Black - Tommy Lee Jones(Deluxe Edition)</a></p></br><a href="../users/ARFCORBCTKX1J.html">ARFCORBCTKX1J</a><br/><p>"Citizen Kane" is what I call a "movie movie". That is, it is as much about the /process/ of film-making as it is about telling a story. We are very much aware of the film on both levels -- tale-telling plus movies-as-artifice.<br /><br />The Coen brothers often make such films. This style can work well, when the story is strong enough, and they minimize their tendency to cruelly caricature people, or turn up their noses at "hicks" who never went to college. * It also works when they perfectly mimic a literary style ("Raising Arizona").<br /><br />Despite the brothers' claim that "No Country for Old Men" is unlike anything they've done, it's obviously a rehash of "Fargo", and inferior hash, at that. Tommy Lee Jones and Josh Brolin play intelligent, appealing people, and Javier Bardem's turn as a psychotic murderer with a terrible haircut is frighteningly good, but the rest of the characters are mostly dull-witted boobs.<br /><br />In short, "Fargo" /works/, while "No Country for Old Men" is little more than an exercise in style, one that we've seen too often. "Fargo" skates dangerously close to the thin ice of the Coens' trademark style (how's that for a metaphor?), but succeeds, because, despite the Coens' tendency to hold their characters at an emotional arm's length, all have recongnizable personalities & problems, and are not merely caricatures or types. And though Marge starts off as a funny-talking buffoon, we are won over by her intelligence, dedication, and (at the end) her sincere and forthright expression of what is and isn't right.<br /><br />Ultimately, we are /involved/ with "Fargo"'s characters. "No Country for Old Men" isn't much more than clever writing and good acting. It's a technically well-made film, and little else.<br /><br />Just to clarify a point... I am an intellectual, I like intellecutal things, and I have no fundamental problem with the Coens' "intellectual" approach to film-making. But you cannot tell stories about "ideas", only about people. When you reduce people to shallow caricatures, you lose the ability to connect with the audience, which is the reason for making the film in the first place.<br /><br />I think I'll stop by the library and borrow the book. I suspect it's a lot better.<br /><br />----------<br /><br />Here's my book report. (I might post an extended review of the book, but don't know right now. If you're interested, click on "see all my reviews" and browse.)<br /><br />On the surface, "No Country for Old Men" has "Coen brothers movie" written all over it. It's shot through with acidly black humor and a generally dismal view of (some parts of) humanity. To my surprise, all but two or three lines of dialog were lifted directly from the book, including the following from Sheriff Bell (TLJ):<br /><br />"Here last week they found this couple out in California they would rent out rooms to old people and then kill em and bury em in the yard and cash their social security checks. They'd torture em first, I dont know why. Maybe their television was broke."<br /><br />That's not Joel and Ethan -- that's Cormac. (So is the idiosyncratic use of apostrophes and the failure to capitalize proper nouns.)<br /><br />The problem is that, in passing McCarthy's Coen-flavored story through the Coen's own filter, the Coen-ish elements are emphasized at the expense of the McCarthy-ish. The film is primarily a crime drama with an icing of social commentary, whereas the book uses the crime as a hook to hang the commentary on. The film doesn't ignore the philosophy/perspective/insight (whatever you want to call it), it's just that they take a back seat to the sorts of weirdness and grotesquerie that appeal to the Coens.<br /><br />The process of converting "No Country for Old Men" to a film both amplifies and diminishes the book. The amplification lies mainly in hearing fine actors deliver the lines. The diminution lies in the Coen's failure to clearly dramatize the book's reason for being -- an attack on the gross materialism of American society. The film shows what is easy to show -- the physical activity of the chase -- and pays less attention to the characters' inner lives -- which is not the Coen brothers' "style", and would kindly bring the film to a dead stop, anyway.<br /><br />The Coens are not known for their "humanity", and the relatively thin treatment of Llewelyn's and Ball's marriages -- both happy ones -- hurts the film, because it largely lacks a "humane center" against which to play the utter evil of the story. The story of Carla Jean's belief about how, when she started working at Walmart, she knew she would there meet the man she was destined to spend her life with -- which she does -- is not only poignant, but perversely justifies Chigurh's claim that everything she has done in her life has inevitably led to his murdering her. Yet it is omitted in the film.<br /><br />However entertaining "No Country for Old Men" is (and it is highly entertaining), it is a poor adaptation of an outstanding novel. The Coen brothers are hardly the first directors to take what they like from a story and leave behind what is truly important, and will not be the last.<br /><br />As odd as it sounds, if you're interested in reading the novel (and I can't recommend it highly enough), see the film first. This sequence throws what is so good about the book into sharp relief.<br /><br />PS: As a degreed EE, and licensed Amateur operator (KA3QXL), I have to point out that, once the transponder was placed in the air duct, its output would be shielded to the point where you'd be hard-pressed to pick it up even a few feet away. Indeed, even if it had been sitting on the floor in the motel room, it's unlikely it could have been picked up from the highway, especially with the interrogating transmitter sitting on the car's seat, where its signal would be blocked by the door.</p></br><a href="../users/A3SFO2GSP5CVSM.html">A3SFO2GSP5CVSM</a><br/><p>The film, as shown above, is often called a thriller or Gothic, but neither term really applies. It's not Gothic because it is too tied to the earthen landscape, and it's barely a thriller, because, well, it's so predictable. It's simply a monster movie- a bit more realistic than the Hannibal Lecter/Freddy Krueger sort, but not much. One wonders what the film would have been like if the assassin Chigurh had been more like the hitman character played by Forest Whitaker in Ghost Dog: The Way Of The Samurai, Jim Jarmusch's underrated film about an assassin, which is also one of the most realistic depictions of organized crime on film. R, perhaps he could be more erratically real, like Johnny Boy, Robert De Niro's psychotic character from Martin Scorsese's Mean Streets, another realistic depiction of organized crime. Instead, what does Chigurh offer besides The Terminator and The Joker? Yes, another Batman foe, Two-Face's obsession with coin flipping to decide whether or not he commits murder. Perhaps in his construction of the novel, McCarthy thought that this device was somehow deep or profound, that it lent Chigurh the status of cosmic force of nature, but what it really did was explicitly tie the character down to a comic book level realism. And, incidentally, Two-Face was played by Jones in 1995's Batman Forever.<br /><br />  But, to get back to the point I raised, the film is SO predictable. Do we not know how Chigurh's victims will end up? Do we not know that he will escape at the end, despite the bone of the car crash tossed in to make it seem like cosmic justice will out? Do we not know Moss is a dead man? That is wife is also a walking corpse? That Sheriff Bell will prove as incompetent as he is apathetic? And, I earlier mentioned the overrated Thomas Paul Anderson film, There Will Be Blood, but since both films so posture themselves on `depth' in dealing with their amoral characters, it's a wonder why so few critics took these films to task for never truly delving into that amorality. Great, amoral characters- see Films, Slasher (20th Century). Yawn. Yet, of the two films, and even laden with its own considerable flaws, it still has some occasionally interesting moments wrought by the acting abilities of Daniel Day-Lewis (although that film's lead character is not amongst his best). Is there a single character in this film with a fifth of the complexity of Lewis's Daniel Plainview, even considering how thin that character is developed? No. Simple. No. And that is the same answer to give to the query over whether this film is worth rewatching.<br /><br />  On to the DVD features. There are three disks- one to download a digital copy onto one's PC (thanks, I'll pass), then the disk with the film. Unfortunately, it lacks an audio commentary. One of the prime things a DVD has in its favor, as a mode of visual art, is the ability to feature commentaries on films, and barring a Woody Allen-like decision yo always forego such, it is incumbent upon DVD companies to include such, especially to supplement mediocre films like this. The disk also has a good making of featurette, a film on working with the Coen Brothers, and a small piece on Tommy Lee Jones' character. The final disk has a bevy of features: a tongue in cheek featurette shot by Josh Brolin, and a slew of clips regarding the promotion of the film over several months- from interviews to book store appearances to radio interviews. All in all, a decent bonus features package. But, the lack of audio commentary is glaring.<br /><br />  As for the film itself, on the technical side, the cinematography by Roger Deakins is solid to good. At times the views of West Texas are very Antonionian, whereas, at others, little is made of perspective, framing, and editing. Carter Burwell's scoring leaves no impression, one way or the other. The acting is rather pedestrian- from the stilted Bardem to the so laid back he's barely acting Jones to the solid Brolin. And, as I opened this essay by stating, some things are better excerpted. This film's trailer is proof, for it is engaging, unlike the film. The last 15 or so minutes of the film, after Moss's death, are utterly superfluous, for they add nothing to the plot, which is the primum mobile of the film. The film would have been much better had its rather incisive portrayals of small town Texans and their quirks been given more screen time, and then a reduced scenario of the drug chase, with more realistic characters, were added to that brew. But, alack, this might require work, and thought, and too often, in Hollywood (including the vaunted Coen Brothers) these sorts of things simply cannot be bothered with. Instead, the small time characters flit in and out of this film with such rapidity that they are lucky that a few of them rise above stereotypes. Fair enough, I guess, if you consider film a business first. I consider it an art first, so be equally fair and give the Coens the same in return as they gave to their screenplay: don't bother with their film. After all, your time and money are as precious as any film investor's. No?</p></br><a href="../users/A30TK6U7DNS82R.html">A30TK6U7DNS82R</a><br/><p>I've read that they are trying to land Christian Bale for the starring part in the upcoming TERMINATOR SALVATION, but someone tell the producers to line up Javier Bardem, Spain's most popular star, to play his robotic unstoppable super-rival.  This is the best Terminator picture since the original one.  By far!  Bardem does things with an air gun that you never saw Schwarzenegger even try to attempt.  We saw this movie over the Thanksgiving holiday with a friend, and all of us were sitting gripping the arms of our chairs white-knuckled, so tensed up with suspense we were hyperventilating.<br /><br />I liked Javier Bardem when he played Cuban in BEFORE NIGHT FALLS, the Reinaldo Arenas story, but here he plays a man called Anton Chigurh (Josh Brolin twitches when he hears the name, snorts "Sugar?" as though to underscore how evil a man could have so sweet a name), who is charged with getting back $2 million dollars in drug money.  Josh stumbles onto this cache of money, packed neatly into a highly distinctive portfolio bag, whilst out deer hunting on a lazy day somewhere on the Texas Mexico border.  Not far away, Tommy Lee Jones as the state's most seen it all sheriff contemplates happy retirement with Tess Harper, both of them made up to show they've spent too much time in the sun.  The movie's set in 1980, not too long ago on the calendar, but let's face it, any movie set in the past before cell phones and the internet is going to seem like it's from the distant Old West past.  When a motel has a sign, "Free HBO," or another character refers to an ATM, at first you think it's some sort of anachronism, like seeing that wristwatch on Moses' wrist in THE TEN COMMANDMENTS, then you stop and think, well maybe they did have HBO and ATMs back in 1980 but otherwise, you're just left wondering why did they bother trying to situate the story back 27 years?  It would have played just as well in today's era, or slightly in the future like the other Terminator movies.  Maybe this one is like a prequel of sorts, only it's not an origin story, instead Chigurh seems fully formed and totally evil from the very first time he ambles onto the screen, in his moptop Beatles haircut and dragging that oxygen tank.  He doesn't say much, but what he says is packed full of contempt for human nature, as befits his slightly monstrous physical makeup.  The Coen Brothers, whose dialogue is often self-reflexive to the point of being goofy, here play it down a bit and keep it on the level of the famous "Hasta la vista, baby" quips Arnold fired off in parts 1 and 2.<br /><br />I didn't really understand why they (or author Cormac McCarthy called it NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN, but apparently it comes from Yeats' poem "Sailing to Byzantium," which became early on a rallying cry for the cyborg movement with its repeated please to leave the human behind and move into a post-human re-mix.  "Once out of nature I shall never take/ My bodily form from any natural thing."<br /><br />Some of the action setpieces here rival the ones James Cameron dreamed up for the original movies.  The very first one, even before Javier Bardem shows up, has Josh Brolin catapulting down a rocksliding hill and slamming belly first into a quickmoving river while a feral dog races after him only a nip away from his butt the whole time.  Ferocious action filmmaking at its finest.  My favorite part was on line waiting for tickets for the show and the guy in front of me asked for two for "No Country Music for Old Men."  Oh brother, where art thou?</p></br><a href="../users/AS28WVBBZ3G99.html">AS28WVBBZ3G99</a><br/><p>NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN is so old and tired it can't get out of it's own way. It doesn't even struggle to its feet in order to at least end well. After a couple of tedious hours of the bad guy dragging about a cattle gun attached to a compressed air tank, the Coen brothers are so pleased with themselves, they decide to insult the audience with nothing more clever or novel than a blank screen ending. I was, however, relieved it was over.<br /><br />I understand the existential angst of the film. The Coen's do portray convincingly the aching despair, hopelessness, and helplessness of the human condition. They point to the gathering storm and darkness on the horizon. Unfortunately, this particular film does not illuminate.  I want to tell them that they got it wrong and it's okay; the end has been written; evil is vanquished and the prince of darkness loses.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NM0RAYSL6PA8.html">A3NM0RAYSL6PA8</a><br/><p>I sat in the theater for about ten minutes after No Country for Old Men was over. It wasn't the genius of it that left me motionless. In fact, I didn't detect very much genius in it at all.  I found none of the characters terribly appealing or engaging, save for the sheriff played by Tommy Lee Jones, and he was, at most, an attempted surrogate for the audience--bearing witness to the events of the film and emoting a combination of disbelief, chagrin, and shock.  The story was scattershot and barely engaging.  And what held it all together at all was a murderous character who seemed to be a superficial study in ruthlessness--a man who, in the relentless pursuit of money, gets to indulge a grim kick for gratuitous killing. Everyone knows that there are bloodless, heartless, and fiercely stoic maniacs in the world, and that there always have been.  In fact, in the kind of spoon-feeding I truly hate in movies, Tommy Lee Jones's character recounts a newspaper story about a brutal killing to unnecessarily drive home the point. The only question No Country for Old Men left on the table, at least for me, was, "So what?"  It's like Terminator told from the point of view of the machines--a heartless, relentless tale with nary a lesson in it apart from the obvious:  Don't mess with drug dealers because you're likely to find a kind of ruthlessness you've never imagined.  Not exactly rocket science, and not exactly unimaginable, since it's been done before in better movies, including The Professional.<br /><br />Part of the reason No Country for Old Men left me cold is that it seemed remarkably undecided as to its own message.  As a result, the critics have had a field day coming up with all manner of metaphors they believe inhabit the story and the characters.  I could find none.  At best, Javier Bardem's killer represented the kind of conscienceless, amoral persona that has become a rather common trigger point for fear and public panic. Not shaded by any empathy or concern for human life, he may be a representation of the modern, existential killing machine who is beyond reasoning with or avoiding--like the carjacker who kills the young mother after she tries to connect with him and provides details of the young children she will leave behind.  He is a predator unmoved, and perhaps even disgusted, by other human beings.  One monumental problem, however, is that No Country For Old Men provides no counterpoint for this. There is not a single character I cared about who came into the crossfire of Bardem's narcissistic psychopath.  In addition, since he mainly focuses his murderous rage on those who, to one degree or another, are culpable in the theft or attempted recovery of drug money, his persona lacks the cold-blooded arbitrariness of so many real killers that make the news.<br /><br />No Country for Old Men, in the end, is the cinematic equivalent of watching a shark feed.  As the movie wrapped up, I thought, maybe the one person spared by our homicidal shadow of a character might kill him in some unintended accident.  At least that would put a nihilistic smile on our faces at the end of this otherwise humorless dirge.</p></br><a href="../users/AQUVTQFFXP4AC.html">AQUVTQFFXP4AC</a><br/><p>[..]<br /><br />I was not biased against the film when I saw it.  I loved "The Big Lebowski", and was even amused by the similar theme in the two: both involve a suitcase full of money which the main character carts around, for events to get the suitcase lost, and inevitably leave the audience in the dark as to the eventual fate of the money.<br /><br />Unfortunately, as great as the movie started out, it devolved into pretentious art-film-like moviemaking and a muddled ending with no clear ending.  Not defined ending or happy ending, but CLEAR ending.  The whole thing came to an abrupt end like a train that hits an invisible wall at low speed.<br /><br />The cinematography was something worth an Oscar in itself, and I especially loved the way it was shot when Llewellyn discovered the botched drug deal and eventually the money.  It was so realistic, you could almost feel the mucky grime of blood drying in the sand or the greasiness of an overused dumptruck, the plainness of the brand-less milk, all the homey settings of a western border-city.<br /><br />The character Llewellyn isn't very likeable.  He reminds me something of The Dude in that he's very much aloof to the horrors of seeing the shot-up drug dealers, and casually takes their money and goes home, suddenly remembering one of the dying men asked him for water, and deciding to go back with a gallon of tap water for him, until Anton Shigurh comes after him and he panics, and is forced to become resolute.<br /><br />In the beginning, Anton Shigurh, played by Javier Bardem, seemed the ideal villain; quiet, utterly irredeemable, seeming the kind of person who would kill someone at any moment without any sort of honor.  Even the scene where he makes a shopkeep gamble on his life with the flip of his coin, you fully expect Anton to kill him at any moment, even when he lets the man live.<br /><br />At about the mid-way point of the movie, it starts to unravel.  Perhaps I need to see the movie again, but for the life of me, I cannot begin to wonder what Tommy Lee Jones's character's purpose in the movie is.  He promises Llewellyn's wife that he'll make sure Llewellyn lives, and goes about doing nothing but reading the newspaper and lounging about in the office or at a diner.  Only once does he visit the crime scene, and towards the end does he come close to the killer.<br /><br />Next come the nameless character played by Woody Harrelson, and the oh-so-elegantly named "Man in the Office" played by Stephen Root.  Woody Harrelson's character describes Anton for us, and then wanders off to meet with Llewellyn, and then get killed by Anton for some reason.  Anton then randomly appears in the Office man's office and kills him in the middle of interviewing some guy for a job.  Anton doesn't say anything of worth to the other man, and is then back to the western area chasing Llewellyn.  I have no idea what that was supposed to be about.<br /><br />The thing is a mess, as the movie skips ahead slightly with Llewellyn dead, and Anton flustered that he lost the money.  In a moment that completely changes my opinion of Anton from cold, calculating, assassin of pure evil, to a pitiful, pathetic, stubborn childish creature that kills Llewellyn's wife just because Llewellyn didn't let Anton kill him.<br /><br />For some random reason, as Anton is driving off from her house, he gets hit by a car, staggers out with a broken arm, and walks away.<br /><br />For another random reason, Tommy Lee Jones's character has some retrospect, then gives a long, rambling soliloquey about a dream he had.  I have heard many accents, and I have very sharp hearing.  I can understand some of the most rambling of mumblings and mutterings, but for the life of me, I could not understand more than a few words of Tommy Lee Jones's heavily accented, mumbling, rambling speech about dreaming about his father.<br /><br />And it suddenly ended with "And then I woke up."</p></br><a href="../users/AIFNOZKR9WTYI.html">AIFNOZKR9WTYI</a><br/><p>I tried to watch the recent Coen brothers movie No Country For Old Men last night.  Real crud.  Its based on the novel of the same name by an ultra-pretentious and hyper-established hack named Cormac McCarthy.  The story telling (in both the book and movie, I'd imagine) is completely unrealistic.  Here's an example of crummy dialog.  Trailer trash protagonist to wife as he is heading out the door to do something dangerous: "If'n Ahh don't cum back, say hello to Muther fer me."  "But LouEllin, Yer Muther is dade!"  (considers a moment) "Well, then Ahh reckin Ahhl tell'r muhself."<br />The movie is psychologically completely unrealistic.  For example, toward the end, the "Sheriff" (who does absolutely nothing and seems to have no interest in actually apprehending anyone or doing more than read the paper and occasionally offer a bit of folk wisdom), played by Tommy Lee "Folksy" Jones, ruminates about some dreams he had to his long-suffering wife.  "Ahh had me some dreams lass naght."  "Anythang innnarestin'?"  "They alwuz iaz to the party concerned."<br />Now, this is false.  Dreams are a digestive product directly analogous to feces.  I have written down my own dreams for more than ten years and can report that frequently I have to force myself to write down a dream, forcibly overcoming an aversion to revisiting it, not because it was unpleasant but simply because the most frequent first impression of most remembered dreams is that the dream is too worthless to recount.  But none of this matters in the mind of Cormac McCarthy or the Coen brothers.  They are not interested in reality, only gimcrack everyman profundities that fall apart the moment they are looked at steadily.  McCarthy is a man who likes the sound of his own supposed eloquence.  He is imbued with the notion that just because a sentence comes out of him, it's got to be good.  This is what makes for bad, fraudulent writing.  Hemingway was exactly the same.  And so you have stylized gibberish like when Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Any real need for that ungainly middle name, Cormac?  Usually down south the first and middle names are carefully chosen so that the nicknames can be run together, like Robert Joseph becoming Bobby-Jo.) says of himself and his deceased father, "We wuz sheriffs at the same tahm.  Ahh think he's proud of that.  Ahh know Ahh wuz."  Why the mixing of tenses, other than a knee-jerk narcissistic urge toward pretentious bilge?  I mean, why is Sheriff Bell's father, who is deceased, STILL proud of this fact, whereas Sheriff Bell himself is, seemingly, NO LONGER proud of this fact.  It's not deep, it's just nonsense.  And, no, this is not The Hunting of the Snark.  I tried to look at the movie from that angle and it doesn't work.<br />The movie is unrealistic in too many ways to enumerate.  However, one example of how crizap No Country For Old Men is, which most people would consider nit-picking, is the following:  LouEllin, the trailer trash protagonist, is hunting deer when he stumbles across the scene of a drug deal gone bad, with dead bodies everywhere, a bunch of kilos of Columbian bam-bam and the inevitable tired stock plot element of the Briefcase Full of A LOT of Dirty Money.  He then decides that some one of this group who shot each other to hell and gone must have survived and walked away from the scene.  So he takes a submachine gun from one of the dead guys and, slinging his own rifle across his back, goes in search of this fugitive.  He finds him some while later and, leaving his rifle behind, he goes to investigate holding the  newly-acquired (Uzi-like) submachine gun.  This is completely unrealistic.  No person familiar with guns would, in a bad situation, exchange his own rifle for a weapon he is completely unfamiliar with and which he has never test fired or even inspected to be sure it is not jammed.  The movie is full of stuff like this.  I believe it won Best Picture.  This is what the world is, halfwits making entertainment for halfwits who then praise the other halfwits to the skies.<br />  Another key plot device of No Country For Old Men is that the Bad Guy, a killer who dresses all in black, originally enough, goes around with a cattle gun, which is an air powered device that shoots and then retracts a bolt, used to stun cattle.  This cattle gun derives its compressed air from a large metal oxygen tank that he lugs around, not to breathe out of but merely to power the cattle gun.  He uses this cattle gun to kill people and also, many times, to knock the cylinder clean out of door locks.  The scene is, the cattle gun busts the lock cylinder right out of the door and it goes shooting across the room.  As I say, this happens many, many times.<br />  So this morning I'd had enough of this nonsense and I called a locksmith to ask his opinion.  The guy I talked to had actually seen the movie and so he knew exactly what I was talking about.  He said that it was completely unrealistic and that he laughed when he saw it.  However, this preposterousness did not cause him to stop taking the movie seriously, strangely enough.  Seemingly people do not go to see movies expecting any degree of realism of any kind, be it physical, mechanical, psychological, what have you.  In short, a people get the movies it deserve.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LU79BYMWZEW9.html">A3LU79BYMWZEW9</a><br/><p>If you've had water cooler chats about NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN, you've probably heard it described as "disturbing"--even by people who loved it.  I recently re-watched the film with friends (neither of whom has seen it before) one of whom said, "I'm glad I saw it; but I'm sure it's going to give me nightmares."  The other just nodded her head in agreement: she was otherwise speechless.<br /><br />Even the film's detractors have to admit that it packs a wallop.  Of course,  since it IS the Coen Brothers, you might expect that the amount of blood spilled would be effectively countered by any number of laugh out loud moments.  Well, not quite.  There IS humor in NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN, but overall, the film's vision is as bleak as the West Texas landscape it depicts.  Like the preceding films in the Coen oeuvre, this movie drips irony, and conventions are subverted right and left.  There's much that can be savored intellectually and aesthetically.  And then, there's the level of violence, which, frankly, many will find off-putting.  And if law officer dealing with all this carnage is the sharp, but world weary Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones, natch) and not the smart, funny and life-affirming (and life bearing) Marge Gunderson of their earlier masterpiece FARGO, well, you are missing at least ONE leavening touch.<br /><br />Of course, neither the Coen Brothers nor any filmmaker should be required to always leave the viewer with that little ray of hope.  Whereas in previous films, their vision might have been described as absurd, here the Brothers Coen veer towards the nihilistic.  And that will leave a lot of viewers as cold as the film's numerous corpses.  They are, of course, adapting the work of novelist Cormac McCarthy, and reportedly did not stray too far from their source work.  That may account for a lot.<br /><br />Filmmakers as original as the Coens do not deal primarily in adaptations, although, in this film, and its immediate predecessor, the re-make of  THE LADYKILLERS, we may be seeing something of a reversal of that trend.  The brothers have said on many occasions that the source novel was perfect material for them, and I certainly won't dispute that assertion substantially.  I will suggest, however, that in films their original screenplays, evildoers are, in the main, quite human and sometimes even oddly sympathetic.  The only other film where there seemed to be an implacable evil entity was the **COMEDY** RAISING ARIZONA.  And in that film, the embodiment of evil turned out to be quite mortal, after all.<br /><br />Put simply, NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN is what it is: the stuff nightmares are made of.  Thematically, its themes of happenstance and fate, the futility of our best laid schemes are classic Coen.  No earlier film of theirs has ever weighed on me so oppressively as this.  But I won't deny its excellence.  Whether future films will prove as bleak and (yes) "disturbing" as this one remains to be seen. The fact that they followed it up with the comic BURN BEFORE READING is a sign at least that it won't all be existential angst from here on out.<br /><br />Not that there's anything WRONG with that.</p></br><a href="../users/AIFXFHO2N9WJB.html">AIFXFHO2N9WJB</a><br/><p>When I visited my local video store recently I was having a difficult time deciding on what movie I wished to see. Several new titles of interest had been released, yet I knew that there were still some from earlier in the year that I had yet to watch. This thought led to a new problem for me, choosing which not-so new release to pick up. After much internal debating with myself, I finally decided I wanted something that had some substance to it, and wasn't going to be a movie where I could just turn my brain off and watch it. I wanted a movie that was going to demand my attention, thus I decided I would pick the film chosen as Best Picture at this year's Academy Awards, the critically acclaimed "No Country for Old Men", written and directed by Joel and Ethan Coen ("O Brother, Where Art Thou?").<br /><br />"No Country for Old Men" follows an intense couple of days for a man named Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin), who happens to come across a drug deal gone bad and discovers for himself two million dollars in cash. However, taking the money may just prove to be the biggest mistake in his entire life. As a sadistic killer (Javier Bardem) is hot on his trail, and leaving a mess of dead bodies in his wake, the likes of which the local sheriff (Tommy Lee Jones) and the West Texas area has never seen.<br /><br />If there's one thing I can say with the utmost certainty about "No Country for Old Men", it's that this is definitely one film that demands your attention, and if you get too distracted at any point you will quickly become lost in the intricately detailed story. With that in mind, even though I gave the movie my undivided attention, I still found myself somewhat confounded by the events in the closing moments of the movie. For roughly 85% of the film I was right there with it every step of the way, perfectly understanding everything, but in the final five to ten minutes it just got strange for me, and I didn't quite understand how it had ended. I do believe that I have a decent grasp on it now, having given more thought to the film and even re-watching the final moments, but even with my newfound understanding, it's still a strange and disappointing ending to what appeared to be a superb film.<br /><br />That brings me to my problem with this film; I was really into the story and thought that perhaps this was going to be a movie that I would want in my collection, but the ending ruined it for me. For starters I'm somewhat surprised by the fact that I even remotely enjoyed "No Country for Old Men", because lately it seems that most Best Picture winners and nominees for the Oscars tend to be these high-brow dramas that don't appeal to me in the least, yet here was the most recent winner enthralling me with its excellent storytelling. I thought the many concepts that the film dealt with, such as fate and/or destiny (which the killer, Anton Chigurh, mentions to many of his victims), the depravity of society as reflected by the more sadistic killers being unleashed upon the world, or how pride always comes before a fall, were all very well presented and thought provoking. Yet, as great as the story was, the extremely unsatisfactory final act and resultant ending that left me puzzled, managed to bring the entire movie to its knees. I believe I am a smart man, and I can't remember the last time that I watched a movie that left me feeling so stupid because of my inability to grasp what I had just seen, but that's how this movie made me feel. I understand that the Coen brothers are extremely talented and smart writers, no argument there, but perhaps they could have rethought the final portion of this movie. Not necessarily changing all the events, but at least the final moments that confused me, and from what I've heard, it did the same for many other viewers as well.<br /><br />As far as the acting goes every single performance was fantastic, not a single one felt out of place or off the mark in any way. Josh Brolin ("W.") convincingly portrays just a down-home, good ol' country boy who just so happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, and allowed his pride to stand in the way of finding the means to save himself. Veteran actor Tommy Lee Jones once again portrays a law enforcement official, something he has done all too often since winning an Academy Award for "The Fugitive". At least in this movie Tommy didn't play the same old guy as he has so many times before. This time around he played an aging lawman who is struggling desperately to find relevance for his brand of justice in a world that has become so dark that it may have passed him by. Javier Bardem ("Vicky Cristina Barcelona") delivered a chilling performance as killer Anton Chigurh, a man who believes killing to be a perfectly natural solution to any problem, no matter who or what may be involved. Lastly, Woody Harrelson ("Semi-Pro") gives a surprisingly strong supporting performance as a man hired to track down Chigurh and stop him by any means necessary. I personally never thought Woody could act all that well, but he definitely brought his A-game to the table in this picture.<br /><br />"No Country for Old Men" is one of those instances in movies where virtually every element works perfectly together to create an engrossing experience. From the superbly written screenplay, thought-provoking ideas and concepts, and excellent performances, this movie delivers in almost every way imaginable; however, the troublesome final act of the film brings the movie crashing down amidst a cacophony of confusion and disappointment. It's such an unfortunate fate for such a promising film.<br /><br />"No Country for Old Men" is rated R for violence and language.</p></br><a href="../users/A17JVVAKWEB0M.html">A17JVVAKWEB0M</a><br/><p>During their interviews in last year's "Infamous", Truman Capote and Harper Lee speak to a grizzled farmer who attended church with the brutally murdered Clutter family. He tells of how the killings scared him and disrupted his view of the world's balance and order.  Despite all the good done by Herb Clutter, when the evil winds blew, they whisked him away like a feather. "You're in control until you're not in control", the old man says. "Then you're helpless."<br /><br />Such powerlessness in the face of evil echoes through No Country for Old Men, the instant classic from Joel and Ethan Coen. In a quest to recover stolen drug money, evil incarnate (Anton Chigurh played by Javier Bardem) decimates anything in his way with almost supernatural power.  Bardem's mesmerizing portrayal immediately takes a place next to the quintessential evil men in film history, from Hopkins' Hannibal Lecter to Jack Palance's gunslinger Wilson from Shane.  Yes, he's that good.  In Chigurh's wake is left the bodies of his former colleagues and rivals and an endless string of seemingly good townsfolk who just happened to be in the wrong place when the evil winds came a-blowin'.<br /><br />Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) is the object of Chigurh's pursuit. While hunting antelope, Moss discovers the drug money and soon realizes his great fortune comes tethered to an even greater price. The unrelenting, unstoppable Chigurh finds his way to all of Moss hiding spots, always armed with weaponry rivaling in creativity the arsenal of Taxi Driver's Travis Bickle. I'm far from a gun nut, but the two devices of death primarily used by Bardem in this film are flat out cool.<br /><br />The search for Moss and the ensuing body count plays out under the nose of Tommy Lee Jones' aging lawman, the film's conscious and analytic voice. As the man in the best position to save the innocent (and not so innocent) from Bardem's monster, Jones' Sheriff Ed Tom Bell slowly realizes the futility of trying to stop evil. As an old friend and mentor tells him, wickedness has always and will always exist, and anyone who believes they can stop it falls victim to vanity.<br /><br />No Country for Old Men gives this seemingly nihilistic view to its audience, with an ending that will no doubt disappoint those expecting men in white horses to ride in and save the day. In fact, viewers expecting any kind of traditional ending (either good or bad) will find the ambiguous close of this film frustrating. Several people stayed in the theater through the credits when I watched it, as they almost demanded or even willed an additional scene to find its way to the reel.<br /><br />This difficult lack of closure, these frayed knots left untied shouldn't be the film's legacy. Up until the ending, No Country for Old Men gives its viewers a merciless edge-of-your-seat ride, full of some of the most unforgettable characters and scenes in years.  Its heightened sense of drama and tension is unmatched in anything since The Shining.  This film will cause you sleepless nights, as your only comfort will be knowing that you don't have a bag of Anton Chigurh's money, and he's not coming for you.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JVSIWDF0WT22.html">A1JVSIWDF0WT22</a><br/><p>If you've ever seen "Fargo" you could have gone to this movie without knowing anything about who made it and realize it was a Cohen brothers film in about 2 minutes. The same crazy circumstances surrounding the main plot, the same "you have to see them to believe them" weird looking characters talking in the stragest of accents, etc.<br />Some people have liked the ending, some haven't, if only I could remmember what the heck Tommy Lee Jones was saying when the credits cut him off for good, if only I hadn't had to wonder for about 5 minutes if that was indeed the main character dead on the floor (or was it one of the mexicans ?). Leaving to your imagination what happened to the girlfriend is one thing but this ending felt so anti-climatic !<br />Still there's tons to recomend this movie and if some people liked the ending, good for them. Personally, I'm not going to pretend I did.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BPDFR58H9575.html">A2BPDFR58H9575</a><br/><p>"No Country for Old Men" is a typical in the good sense Brothers Coens' film. In their new Crime /Drama / Western/Thriller, adapted from Cormac McCarthy's novel of the same title, Coens explore the subject they seem to be very interested in: the crime gone wrong, the temptations it promises, and how it involves and affects the basically good and decent people who suddenly find themselves running for their very lives with death just one step behind or even closer. It is bloody, gripping, extremely atmospheric, darker then dark, with the tension that makes your anticipation of the horrible things to happen even stronger than actually watching these things happen, and with typical for Coens humor that they find in the darkest places. If anything, the movie introduces the evil of such quiet, demented, determined, and meticulously deadly force in the character of Anton Chigurh in the performance of life time by Javier Bardem that it will set the new standards of the screen villain from now on. Bardem plays ruthless, slow speaking, coin tossing hit man who would always finish his job, keep his word, and follow his own twisted code of ethics. His favorite killing weapon is a pneumatic air gun and I am not sure when I was scared more, when Bardem used his weapon or when he politely talked and smiled with that blood freezing smile of his. I will be very surprised if Bardem does not receive the Oscar for his performance.<br /><br />The film has infuriated almost as many viewers as it has satisfied with the unorthodox road it took somewhere 30 minutes before the ending. I can only say, if you want a nice and neatly wrapped up cool little thriller, go and see a Hollywood movie. "No Country for Old Men" is no country for predictable but if you want to see a movie you would not be able to stop thinking about way after it's over and you'd keep playing it in your head over and over, and wouldn't shake off its atmosphere, and couldn't forget its characters, go and see "No Country for Old Men - you may find yourself at home in that country of film-making.<br /><br />4.5/5</p></br><a href="../users/AG6UYD56VHOG1.html">AG6UYD56VHOG1</a><br/><p>Good Blu-Ray picture.

I recall when I was about nineteen and saw "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly" I thought wow is this cool or what? I went around smoking the little cigars like Clint Eastwood did for months. If anyone told me it wasn't cool I would have wanted to tell them they didn't know what they were talking about and vote negative for them, so I expect some negative votes here from young boys that enjoy Grand Theft Auto IV as I am not nineteen anymore and I have seen over two thousand movies since. One key difference here is the Good becomes chicken, the Bad lives, and the Ugly dies instead of the Bad. Don't get me wrong I enjoyed the movie, but Jarvier Bardem does not show Lee Van Cleef acting skills here any way you stretch it. Since there is to much undue hype about this movie and Bardem's part in it, to fully appreciate this movie there are a few prerequisites:<br /><br />1. You must like homicidal maniac killers with no remorse getting away at the end.<br />2. You have to like the killer doing things like asking for a person to call a coin toss to live or asking questions with no point except for him (This is considered way cool by fans very impressionable by a remorseless role with slick lines of unexplainable cold blooded killer movies)<br />3. You must like that the guy that grabs the money in the beginning (usually considered the hero or at least a likeable character you become attached to) will be killed.<br />4. You have to like innocent people being shot in the head with an airgun just like cattle at a slaughterhouse.<br />5. You have to like that the killer can't act his way out of a wet paper bag but for this movie he will recieve high praise for his dead expression and (see 1, 2, 4).<br />6. You can't expect an obvious sense of humor as in other good Coen movies like "Raising Arizona" and "Fargo". (There may be subtle humor, but almost imperceptible except to fans of the Coen's)<br /><br />If you think I can't take hardcore like this, you are mistaken. I enjoy movies like "Reservoir Dogs" and "Heat". This isn't on the same level. There is some good acting for certain, but someone having a dead expression and shooting people with an airgun doesn't make it good acting. Josh Brolin was great and I loved Tommy Lee Jones as the sheriff in this movie, and they made it all worth my time. I would love to see Jones as a sheriff like that again in a murder investigation, but where the cold blooded murdering dog gets the chair or for the mamsy pansies lethal injection. However, in this movie I did not like the killer walking away at the end. I wanted Josh or Tommy to root him down a few feet under. I guess what they were creating here was a country version of "Pulp Fiction", or "Natural Born Killers" so if you enjoyed them, you may like this one as well. In fact Woody Harrelson is even a killer that doesn't get to kill in this one. To bad, he should have killed Jarvier Bardem's character with extreme prejudice since Woody can act. If you want to see a scary killer that can act, watch Tom Noonan in "Manhunter" or Anthony Hopkins in "Silence of the Lambs". That is unless I missed the point and Jarvier was playing Michael Myers from the Halloween movies. That would make the expressionless facade, indestructable ability, and walking away at the end make sense. This is not to say Jarvier isn't scary, but saying Tony Moran had great acting skills in "Halloween" or Bardem does in this movie, is kidding yourself. I am sure even Arnold Schwarzenegger will admit it wasn't real acting he did in "The Terminator" since he is so much more talented today. Let's see if Bardem can show off his acting chops in his next movie. If you enjoyed this be sure to catch "Before the Devil Knows You're Dead" and "Love Lies Bleeding". Good quality DVD, with fair replayability.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HJB9J5O5CLPB.html">A2HJB9J5O5CLPB</a><br/><p>I really think that without Big Studio guidance, or even the old Hays Office, Hollywood filmmaking has deteriorated badly. I'm all for freedom, but films are collaborative affairs with huge budgets and when the artiste runs the show, we get disaster after disaster. Now the Coen's have jumped the shark.<br /><br />Look, I liked the Josh Brolin character, gritty, poor, but resourceful when he finds the money in the midst of a bad drug deal. But just because you're in old Indian country on the Mexican border, it doesn't mean that there's no human compassion out there. All the existential, it don't matter anymore crap, the cheap killing and philosophizing before execution, all of that has no artistic merit unless someone believes in something. I don't care if it's God or Marx, we can't relate unless it touches our heart.<br /><br />Finally, okay, A Fist Full of Dollars kind of adventure, gritty and the good-guy shoots the bad guys, you won't get that here. The good-guys just retire and mumble something about the good old days when dudes get shot on a porch or something. Awful!</p></br><a href="../users/A2T7TZBOTP68C7.html">A2T7TZBOTP68C7</a><br/><p>I wish I had some of what the Academy of Motion Pictures was smoking the day they voted this as Best Picture.  I see in other reviews a lot of words being tossed around, crowing praises about this film: "minimalist," "thriller," "classic," "bone-chilling," and "masterpiece."  I heartily disagree.  As much as I love movies, as many as I have seen, this is hands down the most pointless, heartless, meandering, and senselessly violent movie ever turned out of Hollywood.<br /><br />People who say they understand this film, were excited by it, loved it or whatever strike me as the same folks who praised the Emperor's new clothes as he paraded around naked.<br /><br />Save your money.  This is not even worth a one-time rental.  It will leave you depressed and disturbed.  If there is a message in the movie, it is that life is a random crapshoot in which you cannot escape your fate, that no one will be spared, and that evil will win in the end.</p></br><a href="../users/A18MBO1U4DPY20.html">A18MBO1U4DPY20</a><br/><p>Great film, good dialogues, good action sequences, surreal effort and all. But it's definitely not as good as vast majority paints. Why? Well, apart from lacking extremity in morality or the lack of it, the film doesn't really exclaim loud enough. No tears in the film. The villain deserves an oscar to be fair.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>This film makes Cormac MacCarthy's style ten times more powerful because it provides the words and metaphors with images that are slowly unwrapped and disentangled from the unbearable reality of life. The USA have reached a point when history is the only master of the game, master of ceremonies. The USA have produced a situation that will resolve itself by using its own contradictions till the whole world is destroyed if necessary. This world is dominated by money that has to be easy and does not have to be clean, even would I say that is to be dirty: that gives it more taste and flavor. The world is dominated by the hunger of overstuffed men for anything that will satiate this hunger with something unreal, surreal, over-real: let it be a powder, an injection or whatever but let it erase the darkness of the night, even in the middle of the day, and cultivate some kind of visionary illusion. Then add the third dimension of this world seen through the distorting glass of the USA: violence not for the sake of making anyone suffer. That is no longer funny. Torturing is the pleasure of the simple minded. We are dealing here with a totally psychotic and asocial schizophrenic who can only find his satisfaction, his fun, his pleasure in imposing death in the cleanest way possible. And if a bullet does not suffice let's have a second to prevent any useless suffering. The USA in their immense hunger for money and drugs, speculation and hunger, accumulation and greed, have attracted on to themselves the worst killers ever, the worst predators ever, the worst rotten-meat-eaters you can imagine. They prosper on manure that they distillate in their speculative bank practices. They thrive on human garbage they concentrate in their appropriative confiscation of all they see and cannot accept not to have. Some try to play cat and mouse with them but these are not the cat and the cat knows it and the cat cannot accept any escape. The sheriff though will survive because he will realize the vulture is wounded less than two yards from him and he the lawman will walk away without confronting him. He will resign due to his cowardice and he will dream his father in a typical posture of the Trail of Tears celebrating the end of the Indian genocide, but carrying a horn full of fire as if Satan did not have any matches. No hope for the average American who wishes to have eternal life in this world without death and perfect innocence in a time when even new-born babies are soiled with the grossest crimes and desires imaginable. A hairless teenager at the end will find five hundred dollars kind of not enough for a five dollar Wal Mart shirt sold to the hyena who disappears when no survivor is any longer blocking his way. Pure darkness in which black finds darker shades of black to even make the absence of any light seem to be too light still to be realistic.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines</p></br><a href="../users/AB0W9GTNGHSI3.html">AB0W9GTNGHSI3</a><br/><p>just a mellow yellow movie was boring and quite,, loved the story but was kinda daydreaming when it was playing,,, i liked the airgun thing that was neat this just didnt inpress me with all the award crap--- rent this at the least i wouldnt purchase this one</p></br><a href="../users/ASEBX8TBYWQWA.html">ASEBX8TBYWQWA</a><br/><p>There are literally hundreds of reviews of this DVD release on Amazon, so I'm sure this review will not make a lot of difference but, after spending over two hours watching the film - and some time with the - FIVE HOURS of bonus features (much rehashing why the film is a "Classic") - I'm left with many visual impressions (mostly those of Javier Bardem's face). But that is it. Once you start watching this film, you can't leave your seat; you are drawn in, waiting for the next move. But the ending is quick. Didn't Bob Newhart do this on TV. Were the last two hours a memory? Who's to decide? The Coen Brothers certainly won't tell you. They are wonderfully quirky. I loved their early films like "Blood Simple" because they were small and oddball. And "O Brother, Where Art Thou" was a a musical masterpiece. But Oscar worthy as Best Picture? I can't agree.<br /><br />Just as importantly is the graphic violence. Sure "Saving Private Ryan" had it and won Best Picture. To be honest, I've only watched the second part of that film as the graphic violence was too much for me. The point could easily be made in less time. We saw these scenes on TV in the late 60s from the Vietnam War - but TV no longer shows the violence in Iraq on the nightly news.<br /><br />When a film is honored like "No Country" it attracts attention and teens and young adults will go to see it - or rent it. Unless I missed something in this film, violence is condoned and accepted as natural. How many impressionable young (or even old) people will go out and get one of those "air guns" - or whatever they are called - that Bardem uses to break into room or kill people. Do you need a license for those? The Coens have always used violence but it was comic book violence with humor. I saw no humor here and the quality of the production - from great scenic photography to great acting - put this in a class well above the Rambo and "Die Hard" action pictures.<br /><br />It seems no one is "middle of the road" when it comes to loving or hating this film. And that's okay. But my only comment is that before you watch it you should be prepared for graphic violence equal to modern war films and use that as a guide when watching it with your children. Believe me, I don't believe in censorship, just awareness of the contents of films.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />"Anything Phonographic"</p></br><a href="../users/A2J57EQ9KPGXR9.html">A2J57EQ9KPGXR9</a><br/><p>The Cliff Notes version:<br />Josh Brolin: "I like walking in the desert, looking pensive..

I kept wishing for a tidier ending, but there was nothing 'tidy' in this story. A hard working man living in a trailer (played expertly by Josh Brolin) stumbles upon a drug deal gone bad while hunting, he's not prepared for the consequences of his actions when he takes the cash. This is no easy money for the battered war vet and a blood trail is soon left in the wake of his actions. Well deserving of the Oscar for Bardem and a film that will not soon be forgotten!<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author</p></br><a href="../users/A3BJDFGSLXFB36.html">A3BJDFGSLXFB36</a><br/><p>Well, after reading many, many reviews here on this film, it's obvious that there are as many naysayers as there are those who herald the film's brilliance.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I'm a naysayer. I just saw the film last night and felt pretty much the same way about it as a felt about Martin Scorsese's "The Departed"; all flash, no crash.<br /><br />First off, the actors in this film are absolutely brilliant. Bardem was chillingly creepy and the hitman without conscience or remorse and Tommy Lee Jones was excellent and likable as always.<br /><br />The film starts off with a bang and keeps you rivited....until the very end.<br /><br />Just like "The Departed", "No Country" just abruptly.....ends. After witnessing great cinematography, amazing acting, and an intriguing plot, the film just goes absolutely nowhere.<br /><br />>>>> POSSIBLE SPOLIERS - No loose ends are tied up, no justice is meted out, and no plot comes to a resolution. Things just happen.....and then they stop happening.<br /><br />This was the picture of the year? Wow. Who makes these descisions?<br /><br />At first, I really liked the film. When it was all over, I felt cheated out of an ending.<br /><br />Yeah. The world is a violent place. Our society is going to hell in a handbasket and all that, but for the makers of this film to feel that they are making some profound statement about the nature of humanity and passing it off as art is downright arrogant and pretentious.<br /><br />Sorry, folks. In my opinion (and it's ONLY that; an opinion), this film is a letdown and completely unworthy of even an Oscar NOMINATION, let alone the winner for best picture. I've seen MUCH better films in 2007.<br /><br />On a side note, I love that fact that this site exists so people can share their opinions and viewpoints about films such as this, but it would be a lot better if everyone would just stop criticizing and attacking each other just because their opinions are different. If everyone had the same tastes, media and the arts would be boring and pointless. Enjoy the diversity!</p></br><a href="../users/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z.html">AEQFYOI6YJ83Z</a><br/><p>You hear the phrase "daring film-making" tossed around like a beach ball these days; someone kills off a main character, it's "daring" and "original" and should be nominated for 20 Oscars.  If you want to know what "daring film-making" really is, stick around 'til the end of "No Country For Old Men."  Not that you'll have much trouble--you'll be glued to your seat the entire time.  Probably shaking in terror and anticipation.<br /><br />Here's the premise, and I'll sum it up quickly: a man finds a satchel containing 2 million dollars and then hits the road, persued by a psycopathic hitman and a haven't-seen-it-all-yet-apparently sheriff.  If that summary of the plot doesn't suit your purposes, then just go see the movie.  It's not about plot anyways.  The plot is good, the plot is interesting and great...but it's not about plot.<br /><br />It's about acting.  It's about cinemetography.  It's about script.  It's about Josh Brolin putting you on edge and yet getting your sympathy vote; it's about Tommy Lee Jones giving the performance of his career; it's about Javier Bardem creeping you the [bleep] out.  Hell, even Woody Harrelson, in his too-brief role, proves he's more than a funny man.  The main star is, of course, Texas--beautiful, rugged, majestic, and eerily terrifying.  The dialogue is brisk when it needs to be, thoughtful when it's called for, and always engaging.  There are two scenes that rank as the most suspensful I've ever seen: the scene where Brolin's character is sitting in the dark of his hotel room, waiting for Bardem's character to make his move; and the scene where Jones's character enters the hotel room near the end.  Both scenes left me shaking in my seat, sweating, scared and rivetted.  I don't think that's ever happened before--at least not twice in one movie.<br /><br />A word on the ending.  I went to see this with a buddy of mine.  On our way home from the theater, we talked about nothing but the ending of the movie (eventually we got around to "Cheers" and began bashing Ted Danson and praising Danny de Vito, but that's neither here nor there).  The plain and simple fact is, it works.  I mentioned "daring film-making" at the beginning of this review.  To me, "daring" is when a film-maker stays true to the movie, to what needs to be done for the sake of art.  The Coen Brothers, more than anybody else out there, do that; and they have never done it better than with "No Country For Old Men."  So casual viewers beware: you may leave the movie feeling unfulfilled, like something is missing.  And you will probably have nightmares afterwards.  But that just goes to show how effective "No Country For Old Men" is.  It's a classic.  See it, and you'll understand my reasoning.  Or don't see it and miss out on a truly original cinema experience.</p></br><a href="../users/A2E3F04ZK7FG66.html">A2E3F04ZK7FG66</a><br/><p>Almost one hundred people have reviewed this film so far, and I can't really add much to what's been said as to the plot and quality of the film. I believe it to be the best film of 2007, and one I'd actually like to own, which is a rarity these days with all of the CGI-laden plot-poor films that fill the theaters. The Coens have always been the creators of some of my favorite modern films, with their odd choice of topics and even odder takes on those odd situations. This film is no exception.

And I thought Fargo was good!<br /><br />My best buddy and Amazon friend, CLINT BRONSON, told me I had to see it it, because it was my type of movie, boy, he really knows me inside and out!<br /><br />Briefly, the movie begins where Lewellyn (Josh Brolin) goes hunting and comes across a bunch of dead bodies---humans & dogs both.  He investigates and finds a briefcase full of money.  He takes it, sends his wife to her crazy mother, and tries to take care of himself.  But Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), one ultimate, psychopathic killer, is the owner of the briefcase and has put a transponder in it. NOTHING will stop him from getting his possession back.  Tommy Lee Jones is the local Texas sheriff and Woody Harrelson is the bounty hunter.  This is one hell of a journey and back and you won't be disappointed!<br /><br />I liken this film to Silence of the Lambs---one exciting movie---FLAWLESS!  Buy it and enjoy!  The sound on a 5.1 surround system was so intense my dogs were barking from a distant room in the house---they were convinced it was real, and they don't do that often.<br /><br />THANK YOU CLINT, for more-or-less forcing me to buy this---it is definitely one of the best!</p></br><a href="../users/ABN5K7K1TM1QA.html">ABN5K7K1TM1QA</a><br/><p>(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book "Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!" Get it at Amazon.)<br /><br />BEWARE SPOILERS (and tedious plot discussions)<br /><br />The way the last quarter or so of this movie was cut makes me wonder, who did the cutting and what was the rush?  We see Llewelyn dead but we don't see him die.  We can presume the money went to Mexican drug dealers but we don't see that happen.  Or--because Chigurh gives the kid a hundred dollar bill for his shirt--maybe HE got the money.  Whether Carla Jean (Kelly Macdonald) is still alive as Chigurh walks out the door is unclear--intentionally unclear since the psychopathic fatalist gave her a coin flip.  However she wouldn't let Chigurh avoid responsibility for her death by calling the coin flip.  What's a madman to do?  We never find out.  Or--since we see Chigurh checking the bottoms of his boots for something (blood?) as he leaves her place--maybe he did kill her.<br /><br />I also wonder about keeping such a sickie alive as the closing credits run.  I wasn't keeping count but Chigurh wantonly killed somewhere around a dozen people, mostly just because he could.  I think this kind of character--a psychopath with a code (you harm, insult or even inconvenience me and you die)--plays well in this age of violence in which we live.  He is something like shock and awe made flesh.<br /><br />Don't misunderstand me.  This is a riveting flick, as one would expect from Ethan Coen and Joel Coen.  The acting, especially by Javier Bardem and Josh Brolin is superlative.  Bardem, with the thick pageboy hairdo and the big malevolent eyes and the no nonsense conversational style, is particularly good.  Brolin becomes the country and cocky Llewelyn Moss very well.  He is much more likeable in the movie than in the book.<br /><br />One thing that the movie cleared up for me was the business with the money in the air conditioning shaft at the motel.  Llewelyn puts it there in the first place to hide it.  When he comes back to the motel he sees that the drapes are a bit parted and he knows somebody's in there waiting for him.  So he rents the room on the other side and manages to pull the suitcase out.  The Mexicans who were waiting for him didn't have the tracking device (transponder) so they didn't know the money was nearby.  Chigurh knows of course, but by the time he is through shooting the Mexicans, Llewelyn is gone.<br /><br />A problem in the very beginning of the movie comes up when Llewelyn acknowledges that he is about to do something incredibly foolish.  He goes back to the bloody scene in the scrub desert to bring the dying Mexican some water.  The fact that he says it's foolish doesn't excuse it as a plot device.  The guy was just about dead when Llewelyn left him many hours earlier.  Coming back now with water isn't going to save him.  Furthermore, Llewelyn was originally indifferent to his thirst.  There must have been some water or something to drink somewhere in all the vehicles on the scene, but Llewelyn doesn't bother looking.  It's curious that Llewelyn didn't realize that bringing the man who had been bleeding for many hours some water wasn't really going to help.  If he wanted to help he could have dialed 911.<br /><br />By the way, this device, which has the effect of giving Llewelyn a "fatal flaw" in the Greek dramatic sense, was also in Cormac McCarthy's novel.  If Llewelyn doesn't return to the scene, the story would play out a bit differently, to say the least.  Since Chigurh has the transponder he would locate the money and possibly take Llewelyn by surprise.<br /><br />What are the chances that Carson Wells (Woody Harrison) is able to go to the exact spot where Llewelyn threw the money over the fence and into bushes?  Close to zero, I would say.  I suspect that the Coens were going to do something with this unlikely plot event but as it turns out, they didn't.  In fact, there is a lot they didn't do or show, so much so, I just think they got overwhelmed with all the footage they had and the time constraints and just sliced it up near the end.<br /><br />Now, why is this called "No Country for Old Men"?  Cormac McCarthy took his cue from the poem "Sailing to Byzantium" by William Butler Yeats.  Here is the opening stanza.<br /><br />  That is no country for old men.  The young<br />  in one another's arms, birds in the trees<br />  --Those dying generations--at their song,<br />  The salmon-falls, the mackerel-crowded seas,<br />  Fish, flesh, or fowl, commend all summer long<br />  Whatever is begotten, born, and dies.<br />  Caught in that sensual music all neglect<br />  Monuments of unageing intellect.<br /><br />The theme of Yeats' poem is the impermanence of this world, and so he set sail "To the holy city of Byzantium" where things are made of more permanent stuff such "as Grecian goldsmiths make" and where things are eternal like ideas.<br /><br />One of McCarthy's points is that the bloody violence of the border towns of West Texas about which he writes resembles more "the mackerel-crowded seas" than the holy city of Byzantium, and the "sensual music" is the sound of bullet hitting bone from those dying generations at their song.  Additionally, the old men in the story, Ed Tom Bell (played very effectively by Tommy Lee Jones), Roscoe Giddens (Rodger Boyce), and Ellis (Barry Corbin), feel estranged from the lust of the young after money and drugs.<br /><br />The premise of the movie centers around a dope drop in the semi-desert gone bad that Llewelyn Moss stumbles onto some time after the shooting has stopped.  Bodies everywhere.  Bullet holes in vehicles, blood, etc.  Moss is wondering, where's the money?  He follows the bloody trail of someone carrying something heavy and finds him and it.  It's a carrying case with $2-million in hundred dollar bills.<br /><br />Needless to say that kind of cash attracts a lot of flies.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RHQMV5GD18Z8.html">A2RHQMV5GD18Z8</a><br/><p>***Spoilers Within***<br /><br />Oscar ceremonies are sometimes dominated by one or two films because the opposition is weak, but that definitely wasn't the case in 2008. Nominees included No Country for Old Men, There Will Be Blood, Juno, The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, Ratatouille, Once, The Bourne Ultimatum, Into the Wild, Atonement, Michael Clayton, Eastern Promises and American Gangster.<br /><br />I was torn at the time because I couldn't decide whether I wanted There Will Be Blood or No Country for Old Men to win for Best Picture. In hindsight, my two favorite films from that year are Juno and No Country for Old Men. I think the Academy got it right for once by awarding No Country for Old Men the Best Picture Oscar and Daniel Day-Lewis Leading Actor.<br /><br />So why do I think that No Country for Old Men deserved its win?<br /><br />The film contains so many strong elements. It gave us three memorable characters and expertly combined their three viewpoints to give us a compelling story. Roger Deakins did another wonderful job showing us the bleak Texas landscape, while the direction and writing were both superb.<br /><br />Llewelyn Moss (Brolin) makes a discovery while hunting for antelope. After tracking an injured animal, he finds what appears to be the result of a failed drug deal. Five trucks are surrounded by corpses and he deduces that the last man standing would have looked for shade. He eventually locates the final corpse and finds a case containing two million dollars. Moss lives in a trailer with his wife and the money represents a chance to completely change his life.<br /><br />The most interesting character is Anton Chigurh (Bardem). We see him captured by police at the start of the film, but he escapes and kills a deputy in the process. He is extremely violent and his motives are unclear. At times he appears supernatural in the way he evades capture. Is he supposed to represent Death or the Devil? Bardem makes Chigurh one of the most memorable villains ever to appear on screen. There's a scene which rivals Tarantino's farmhouse scene in Inglourious Basterds in terms of tension. Chigurh has a conversation with a gas station owner and it ends with a coin flip. The scene is both absurd and chilling at the same time. We know what's at stake.<br /><br />The other major character is Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Jones). He's old, wise and extremely competent. Some of his choices show that he's more concerned with self-preservation than pursuing criminals, but he somehow gets the job done. One of his strengths is the ability to reconstruct crime scenes. He has a dry sense of humor and uncanny instincts.<br /><br />The first part of the story focuses on Moss. He's an experienced tracker and a Vietnam veteran and we see him trying to evade pursuit. At first, he doesn't know who will be coming after him, but eventually learns that it's Chigurh. Instead of simply leaving the country, he decides to face Chigurh himself. That might seem to be a stupid choice, but Moss does have some intelligence and appears able to take care of himself.<br /><br />Chigurh also seems highly competent and we get the sense that he's being doing what he does for a very long time. His pursuit is relentless. When he is injured, he's able to take care of his own wounds. He does bleed, but there's still the sense that he either is, or he at least represents, a supernatural force.<br /><br />I won't reveal any more of the plot. I have heard two complaints about the film. One is the level of violence present and the other is the unusual ending. I think the ending is partly showing how unpredictable life can be, but I understand the complaints. I thought the ending was appropriate and my only regret was that I couldn't watch these characters for longer.<br /><br />No Country for Old Men is many things. On the surface, it's the story of an extended chase. The Coen brothers said that it is a story of a good, evil and something between the two. Moss can be perceived as good or evil, but he's definitely committing a crime.<br /><br />Some of the scenes require us to pay close attention to the events and contain very little dialogue. It reminds me of the opening sequence in There Will Be Blood in that way. It succeeds because of the writing and the tension that's present throughout the story. If you enjoy thrillers, this is one of the best I have seen.<br /><br />The Blu-ray presentation is just about perfect. Every little sound comes across clearly and the Texas scenery looks breathtaking at times.</p></br><a href="../users/A3956O40ZZYFMY.html">A3956O40ZZYFMY</a><br/><p>When I saw this movie upon its theatrical release I was sure it would finally launch Javier Bardem as a Hollywood actor of much demand. I had seen the man master several foreign film roles and was happy to see him in this Coen Brothers release. He did nothing different than he had in every foreign film I had seen him in, single handedly making the film great by way of applying his superb acting "chops". His skill even allowed one to forget the rather eccentric movie making efforts of Coen Brothers films, truly quite the accomplishment itself. The film and the actor were recognized for the obvious but as several years have now passed since the films release, Hollywood maintains its famed flaw of failing to recognize and take advantage of true acting skill. How many miserable Nicolas Cage movies have come and gone, or mindless DeCaprio vehicles similarly popping up and quickly being forgotten since No Country For Old Men was released with nothing but a void from Hollywood for films featuring the vastly more skilled Bardem?<br />I digress and am merely wool-gathering though. No Country For Old Men is a must see. Easily the best film of its year and at least for me, a film that will never be forgotten. Rent it, buy it, steal it...anything is worth the cost to see this great film. Forget the popcorn, it will sit unbothered, growing cold and stale while this fine film takes the viewer on a journey never to be forgotten.</p></br><a href="../users/AJD9EA658HCFW.html">AJD9EA658HCFW</a><br/><p>In a wide open country region where an old fashioned Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) the sheriff of this country region in West Texas is struggling to catch on to the rising crime rates and the breeding of a new criminal.<br /><br />"No Country for Old Men" is centered on Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin). While hunting one afternoon, he stubbles across a drug scene gone bad. There are several dead men and dogs, along with two million dollars. Moss decides to take the money back to his trailer home. Later that night while he is thinking about what he saw, he decides to bring water to a man who was still alive. While doing this, Moss gets chased by some men in a truck. He escapes the men, and returns to his trailer home to get the money and send his wife to her mother's house. Moss checks into a motel in the next county, where he stashes the money in his motel rooms vent.<br />Meanwhile Hitman Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) is hired to recover the money. Sheriff Ed Tom Bell is on the case, but is always one step behind Moss and Chigurh.<br /><br />The fascinating aspect of "No Country for Old Men" are the two themes in the film, which are the cat and mouse like game between Moss and Chigurh, and the Character Tommy Lee Jones plays (Sheriff Ed Tom Bell). He is proud to be the sheriff, but knows he is falling behind the modern criminal.<br /><br />Directors Ethan and Joel Coen do a great job turning a novel into a good movie. The characters are well acted and the screenplay is well written.</p></br><a href="../users/AJ9W09EUQPAKE.html">AJ9W09EUQPAKE</a><br/><p>The Big Lebowski was a movie with a plot riddled with more holes than a Swiss cheese and triumphed because of it. No Country for Old Men is let down by the same flaw. The good points about this movie - the brilliant ersatz 1980s New Mexico borderlands cinematography, the tough landscapes of badlands and small time dusty towns evoke the mood of the McCarthy novel brilliantly. And there are some fine acting performances, especially Javier Bardem as Shigurh, the psychopathic Hannibal Lecterish killer on the loose.<br /><br />But the plot. Jeez. What is going on here. Lazily constructed doesn't even start. From the start - who is the protagonist? The old timer sherrif with his riffs on the decline of the old moral certainties? Nope, because he doesn't solve anything during the movie and his character develops not one bit. Llwelyn Moss, retired welder who comes across a case of a million dollars after a shoot out? Nope, because his final denoument is conducted off scene. The killer, Shigurgh? He is a flat 2d psychopath. That is evidenced early in the movie and he progresses along that predictable trajectory.<br /><br />And the ending is such a let down. This is a slick, elegant, intellectual thriller that fails to paper over the serious flaws in its structure.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZB8B7VQONZA6.html">A2ZB8B7VQONZA6</a><br/><p>NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN<br /><br />I don't know about you but I have always been a huge fan of the Coen Brothers Joel and Ethan, I have liked every film the two have put together. This is no exception and is just another classic in a long list of classics, both theatrically and on DVD this is a brilliant film. I can honestly say that a lot of the time I do not agree with the winners or even the nominees chosen by the Academy for the Oscar but they got it right with this one. By the way I do not care what people think, that ending was BRILLIANT.<br /><br />The story is all about Llewelyn Moss [Josh Brolin] a normal every day guy who happens to stumble upon something he should not have. When he comes across a massacre and ends up leaving the area with a bag full of money a killer [Javier Bardem] comes after him and one of the best movies ever made starts to unfold. Add in a sheriff who is trying to put this all together played by Tommy Lee Jones and another hired hand played by Woody Harrelson and you have one great scenario taking place. This movie has every thong you could want in a film, there is some good humor although it is on the darker side. There is also not only some good action going on but a really dramatic tale of greed. Don't let any one tell you differently this movie is all about greed and obsession. One mans combo of the two leaves not only him but his family in danger that may even lead to death. Another's combo of the two leads him down the same path while another's completely breaks him. It may seem confusing reading this but when you watch it you will get it, and dare I say you will enjoy it.<br /><br />Writers/directors/producers Coen Brothers have crafted one of the best films to come out in years. The direction of this film can be felt threw out the entire thing and the screenplay is amazing. This could be the best film the two have put together and that is really saying something, come on just think of what these two have made. Acting wise this film shines just as much as Josh Brolin gives one of the best performances of his career. I was really rooting for this guy during this movie even though he brings it all on himself, but man does he give Bardem's character a run for his money. Woody Harrelson is just as good in this film as a hired hand trying to get the money back for his employer. He really shines with his sense of humor in this film and the way he carries himself. Tommy Lee Jones as usual is great as the sheriff who is determined to find his man, so much so that it brings him down. It is somewhat disappointing knowing about the drama going on between him and the studio about this film, mainly because he may never work with the Coen Brothers again. But aside from that we have what has got to be one of the greatest performances in cinematic history, and I am serious when I say that. Javier Bardem turned in one of the best performances I have ever seen, really brought to life one of the most interesting characters I have had the pleasure of viewing.<br /><br />This film is definitely worth your money, I say buy this not rent it. I hear people complain about the ending of this film all the time and I don't understand why. I thought that it was one of the most brilliant endings in a long time; I never thought it would end like that. Maybe because it isn't what would be considered a typical ending people hated on it, but I think that it what makes it so good. I loved it and so did my brother who watched it with me, at least one person agreed with me on that ending.</p></br><a href="../users/A2582KMXLK2P06.html">A2582KMXLK2P06</a><br/><p>I didn't really get this movie, or understand why it deserves all the awards it has gotten so far.  The action scenes involving an insane murderer going around killing people in graphic style was interesting to the natural horror fan inside of me, but understanding the point of all this went CLEAR over my head.  I can't blame the movie for that- only blame myself for not getting it, which explains why I'm giving the album a very good rating (a 4 out of 5).</p></br></body></html>

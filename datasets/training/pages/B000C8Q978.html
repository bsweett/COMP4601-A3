What he gets (see the title for this review) is not original but probably appropriate for one who gets described by almost everyone else as a "Don Juan."  That is, of course, the idea behind the famous romancer: that romantic love and sex are all about the here and now (that is why romantic love and marriage are such uneasy "bed partners": the best that romantic love can offer is an unimaginable "happily ever after" because the real future is not so romantic).<br /><br />The response, "what are you, a Buddhist?" is a deliberate jab on the part of Jarmusch at this philosophical approach that says everything and nothing.  The irony is that this film will likely be appreciated for its moments more than for what I take to be its underlying critique of the "philosophy of the moment" (a version of an existentialist philosophy).<br /><br />Because Don lives in the moment, he cannot really act -- he has no character.  What he does is merely a reaction to those he is  with -- he is for others just what they expect to see in him.  He lets his actions be dictated to him by his neighbor.  He never describes himself in this film but is described by others: as a Don Juan, as Don Johnson, as a rich man, as a computer guy.  It's significant for this question of labels that Don made his money in computers but refuses to have one in his house.  That would define him.  He doesn't like any labels to stick: even when he thinks he's found his son he tells him not that he is his father but merely admits that he might seem like that to the boy.  (This issue of labelling is fairly complex in the film: most everyone in the film can be labeled and even accepts a label - Lolita, the real estate agent, the pet communicator; note though that Don's neighbor isn't easily labeled -- he's a Jamaican family man with three jobs who fancies himself a detective but whose daughter insists he can't be identified with any of the "famous detective" labels that Don tries to pin on him.)<br /><br />The idea of having a son is precisely what he has to reject if he is going to hold on to his philosophy: because to be a father is to have an inescapable past, a moment that defines you essentially in relation to another person, and to have a future that is bound up with the vicissitudes of that other person's life.  At the end of the film, though, in the first real show of feeling and passion Don begins to want such a connection -- as if in despair over his own lack of identity.  The ambiguity of the ending captures this despair in a simple and powerful way.  A very fine film, well worth the ride -- with an incredibly cool Jamaican jazzy soundtrack.</p></br><a href="../users/AR37967IAR6ZT.html">AR37967IAR6ZT</a><br/><p>"Broken Flowers," I guess, is supposed to be this long, contemplative film about a man's journey into his past to discover how his life and history of loves has added up. Initially, the film is structured as a mystery - as Bill Murray's character tries to find the old girlfriend who bore his son, but it's more about the journey than the destination.<br /><br />But, to me, this movie was one of the most boring things I've ever sat through. There are an endless number of minutes-long takes of Bill Murray driving a car by himself. There are several scenes of him sitting alone in his living room, listening to the stereo and thinking. A couple of these scenes, where the silences could be meaningful and carry depth, would be fine in a film like this, if the film carried more weight or gave Murray's character more of a background than "a bemused, aging Don Juan." Instead, once the movie ends, I felt like it contained several good scenes where Murray interacted with the old girlfriends and about 30 minutes of dead air. Why, why, WHY were there four editing cuts done as Murray drove a Taurus down a country road? Wouldn't one shot establish the plot point as much as is necessary? I get it. He's driving.<br /><br />Oh, and I figured out that Murray's character was an aging Don Juan within the first five minutes, when he's watching the movie about Don Juan. I didn't need to have Julie Delpy call him "Don Juan," then have Jeffrey Wright call him "Don Juan," then have everyone comment on how his name is Don Johnston. I get the point. Don't hammer it into the ground.<br /><br />This is not a good movie. If it gets across-the-board good reviews, I'll be baffled. It's pretentious, meaningless and doesn't go very far. It doesn't function as a mystery. It doesn't function successfully as an illustration of a character. Good actors, like Jessica Lange, Frances Conroy and Sharon Stone, are given little to do in episodic scenes.<br /><br />All in all, the emperor's not wearing any clothes.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TAPL67U2A5HM.html">A2TAPL67U2A5HM</a><br/><p>Broken Flowers~ Jim Jarmusch is a parody of American life and shows the "crazy" animal communicator, the rich and stiff upper class, the redneck family and the white trash family. Bill Murray perfectly plays the role of the old millionaire, living in his dark mansion. The women that he meet to find his son are all meant to show a portrait of America. First we get to meet Laura and her daughter Lolita (whom tries to get him in bed with her from the first scene and in one scene walks around completely nude talking on her cellphone). The second woman that he meets, Dora, is supposed to be the upper class wife whom lives in an " antiseptic McMansion" and the food they eat is a riot. it is rice, some fish and some carrots and they are all made in an "artsy" yet "clean" way. The other two women also show a portrait of the American, Carmen (the quirky pet comunicator) and Penny (the redneck woman). The movie does not miss anything like small details such as the expensive dog treats at Carmens place, the "beaded" cell phone of Lolita (Yes, she plays the same role as in Nabakov, and I started chuckling to myself when she mentioned her named), the piles of rusted cars in Pennys frontyard and many other details that desribe America in a nutshell. I love this movie and would warmly recommend it to anyone that loves well made movies.</p></br><a href="../users/AT6CZDCP4TRGA.html">AT6CZDCP4TRGA</a><br/><p>Like all of Jim Jarmusch's movies, "Broken Flowers" is above all a journey: sometimes quick, sometimes slow, sometimes interesting, sometimes fascinating, but always random, unpredictable, and deliciously impenetrable.<br /><br />Really strong cast all around, from Jeffrey Wright (who supplies some awesome Ethiopian pop music) to Sharon Stone (in a non-bimbo role for a change) and Jessica Lange.  As with most Jarmsuch movies the soundtrack is excellent.<br /><br />I won't bore you with a plot synopsis, because many others here have done so already, and also because this movie is really not about plot at all.  It's more about the absence of plot which is really the plot of all our lives...IF we are awake and aware and open enough to realize it.  Yes, there is a strong Zen flavor to this film.<br /><br />Unlike your typical linear 3-act, conflict-and-resolution movie (not to mention the moronic Hollywood mass movies Murray used to star in), "Broken Flowers" is a film you can come back to and watch over and over again and still find something new in it every time.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>**1/2<br /><br />I have rarely seen a movie handed such a promising premise and yet do so little with it.<br /><br />In "Broken Flowers," Bill Murray plays an aging Don Juan-type who has had a long succession of girlfriends but never a fully committed, sustained relationship with any of them.  On the same day that his latest love interest has decided to move out on him, Don receives an anonymous letter from one of his former girlfriends informing him that he is the father of a 19-year-old son who may be coming around to look for him.  Eventually, albeit reluctantly, Don decides to go in search of the four women who could possibly have written the note and find out for himself about the boy he never knew he had.<br /><br />In typical Jim Jarmusch style, "Broken Flowers" is all windup and very little follow through.  The preparation for the trip is done with a great deal of style and subtle humor, as Don first balks at the prospect of tracking down the women, but then relents under the persuasive persistence of Winston, his concerned next door neighbor and first class buttinski.  Anticipation is high as Don, filled with curiosity and anxiety, sets off on his journey into the past.  Unfortunately, after all the suspense and build-up, not much happens once he gets there.  To call his encounters with the ladies "under whelming" would, in itself, be a masterpiece of understatement.  For in his effort to avoid melodrama, Jarmusch has pretty much thrown out the drama as well.  Yes, we understand that the point is that we never really can go back to the past and make restitution for what we did back then, but does the theme have to be presented in so attenuated, episodic and dramatically inert a way?<br /><br />This is a particular shame considering the caliber of actresses Jarmusch has hired for the occasion: Jessica Lange, Frances Conroy, Sharon Stone and Tilda Swinton, not to mention Chloe Sevigny and Alexis Dziena in even more minor roles.  All these women are given so little time on screen that they are unable to develop any truly memorable characters.  What a waste.  As Don, Murray plays pretty much the same zonked-out, near-catatonic fatalist he did in "Lost in Translation," but he does it so well that he keeps the movie interesting even when it is faltering and trying to figure out where it wants to take us.  With the subtlest possible facial expressions - the ever so miniscule tilt of an eyebrow, the barely perceptible half-smile, the sardonic twinkle in his eye - Murray conveys thoroughly what his world-weary character is thinking and feeling.  It's another breathtaking performance from a man who began his movie career as a broad comic and will surely end it as a first rate dramatic actor.<br /><br />Despite the sag in the middle, I must say that "Broken Flowers" ends on a brilliantly sustained high note, a long scene involving Don and a young vagabond that hints at how great the movie could have been had the whole thing been played at this level.  The inconclusive ending and the lack of a clear-cut resolution goes a long way towards redeeming much of the rest of the movie as Don comes face-to-face with the emptiness and meaninglessness of his existence.  It's a fine finale to a deeply flawed and ultimately unsatisfying film.</p></br><a href="../users/A21B2TJBWCSK1R.html">A21B2TJBWCSK1R</a><br/><p>Bill Murray continues his middle-aged sad sack routine with this movie, his face affixed with a consistently deadpanned, hang-dog expression worthy of Buster Keaton. After this film, his shtick feels played out. Murray has explored just about every variation and nuance possible for this particular type of character and kind of performance. His acting in Broken Flowers mirrors director Jim Jarmusch's laid-back direction perfectly.<br /><br />The always reliable Jeffrey Wright is excellent as Winston who does all the leg work and pushes his friend to solve this mystery. He is the proactive counterpart to Don's reluctant protagonist - a hallmark of Jarmusch's films. In typical fashion of all of the director's movies, Broken Flowers is an understated comedy and this is evident in the way Winston and interacts with his family - they clearly love each other but Jarmusch doesn't hit us over the head with it.<br /><br />Broken Flowers most closely resembles Jarmusch's Stranger than Paradise with its long, static takes and deals with a protagonist's inertia. Don is an aging Don Juan, a bit of a sad sack stuck in rut with no direction in his life and the anonymous letter he gets in the mail motivates him into action. Or rather, he stumbles into an adventure. A large weight of regret hangs over Don and this overshadows his entire journey. True Jarmusch devotees are wondering throughout if this film will be open-ended a la Down by Law or have some kind of closure like Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai. Ultimately, Broken Flowers is about a journey that forces Don to re-examine his life and his relationships with the women in it.<br /><br />"Girls on the Bus" features more footage of the terminally chatty teenage girls that Don encounters on a bus.<br /><br />"Broken Flowers: Start to Finish" is an amusing outtakes reel that takes us through the entire movie.<br /><br />"Farm House" features behind-the-scenes footage with Jarmusch talking in voiceover about the random nature of life and how he likes to have scenes in his movies where you don't know what's going to happen next.<br /><br />Finally, there is a theatrical trailer.</p></br><a href="../users/AL277B4AQCWBG.html">AL277B4AQCWBG</a><br/><p>When Don Johnston (Bill Murray) is dumped by his latest lover, Sherry (Julie Delpy), he resigns himself to being alone yet again. Then he receives a mysterious pink letter from an anonymous former lover who informs him that he has a 19-year-old son, who may now be looking for his father. Prompted by his neighbour Winston (Jeffrey Wright) who has a penchant for unsolved mysteries and has tracked down the names and addresses of four possible mothers from Don's long list of ex-girlfriends, Don reluctantly begins a journey to visit each of them and try to figure it all out... Great setup. You think you know where this is going - aging Lothario revisits the past and learns something about himself - and are even looking forward to the journey. The problem here is that Jarmusch does very little with it and does it so tediously that most audiences are likely to be more frustrated than engaged. The pacing is truly mind-numbing. So much of the running time is consumed by repetitive transitional sequences, most of which add absolutly nothing to the story or character, nor anything more to the atmosphere than what was established by the opening scenes, that they seem little more than excuses to hear the soundtrack. They're used to such an extent that they infect the entire film with an artistically unnecessary lugubrious tone. Thankfully, the performances compensate. The ex-girlfriends - Sharon Stone, Frances Conroy, Jessica Lange and Tilda Swinton - are all excellent, doing wonders with very little screen time. Much has been made of Murray's minimalist style. It works, to an extent. Although it does make you wonder how such a stick-in-the-mud ever managed to attract such a coterie of women, or what he used to be like and what hideous event changed him. But we never find out. We never find out much of anything in this film. In the final moments, all we are left with is a banal regurgitation of Buddhist philosophy - a philosophy of the Eternal Now that Don, by the way, seemed to be living quite perfectly when he was sitting alone in his living room, doing nothing, being present, in the semi-dark. Arguably, the (non)resolution of this (non)story is realistic in the extreme, but it's a very unsatisfying ending. This may well be what Jarmusch intended: the answer to our future doesn't lie in nostalgia for an unrecoverable, impenetrable past; and the magic is in the silences, in the unsaid. Fair enough points. But they don't make for a very good movie. "Broken Flowers" is quite enjoyable on one level, but not the deeply satisfying film you might have expected. Think of it as "About Schmidt" or "Sideways" or "Lost in Translation", but without the growth. Or the hope. Or most of the laughs. Which doesn't leave much to enjoy.</p></br><a href="../users/AF3X7J0XC391L.html">AF3X7J0XC391L</a><br/><p>The idea behind the story was a good one - what happens to the young lady's man when he grows old and begins to look back at the life he has squandored?  It was a theme that could have been quite good and with Bill Murray in the lead, it could have been great.  In the end it was mediocre and seemed an anticlimax to the description on the back cover of the DVD package.  A good lesson that could have been much better.</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>Three previous references around the memories and the vanished youth have been made with remarkable success. The first one was the famous cult movie "The swimmer" in 1968 with Burt Lancaster, "The man who loved women" with Oskar Werner of Francois Truffaut of 1977, and  "The night of Varennes" of Ettore Scola with Marcello Mastroianni in 1981.<br /><br />This is every penetrating film to watch; it talks about absences, of vanished illusions and disappointments, a retrospective journey in search of certain clues in order to restore or rebuilt certain unfitted pieces.<br /><br />Back into our memories, there is not so much to find: the people we loved and ourselves change according the interests and the years.<br /><br />But perhaps, the most interesting aspect to remark is the visible existential boredom of this living wreck, who is forced to initiate a desperate and troubling search of a teenager, product of love affair.<br /><br />The urban jungle: airports, airplanes, buses and mails, filled of empty words without importance, seem to accent still more the vast silence underlined by inexpressive dialogues; trying to find a door exit that leads to nowhere; old love adventures: All those women of his past intend to live or survive and somehow represent an extension of his ego: Sharon Stone, a very attractive widow with a daughter named Lolita (a posthumous homage to Vladimir Nabokov' s novel and Kubrick's film); a mind reader of animals; an unhappy and  narrow-minded wife and an outlaw woman who lives in the suburbs conform a mirror image of himself.<br /><br />The incisive and corrosive shot is implacable: five intersections, five women, five fingers that represent the hand of fate. The film possesses a visible dark poetic flight; the process of edition itself is part of the narrative speech.<br /><br />Two points to remark: the central personage  was extremely flat; Bill Murray is simply an extension of the previous character in "Lost in translation" (I think about Jeremy Irons who looked perfect for this role) and second: Jarmush is not Antonioni. All of us who have watched his artistic trajectory know about his concerns in Mystery train.</p></br><a href="../users/A2X6GEC6LCDN4S.html">A2X6GEC6LCDN4S</a><br/><p>This film is the definition of "off-beat."  Even though the film moves very very slow at times the characters are fairly interesting, interesting enough to keep you viewing.  Bill Murray delivers a performance like only Bill Murray can deliver.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>"Sometimes life brings some strange surprises." The tagline of `Broken Flowers' goes like this, but for anyone who has been watching the film of Jim Jarmusch, this film's strangeness hardly comes as surprise. The real point is whether or not you like the director's insistence on his own method of filmmaking, which prefers the minimalist approach to the film's material. And I couldn't bring myself to like his method. Well, in short, it was boring.<br /><br />It is true that Bill Murray again did a fine job as the tired protagonist Don, aging Don Juan-type guy whose simple life-weary facial expressions or poise is always attractive though it is no longer amazing after seeing him deliver dead-pan humor in `Lost in Translation' and other recent films.<br /><br />To him a letter in a pink envelope arrives, which tells some news about his son. With a help from an officious neighbor played by Jeffrey Wright, Don hits the road to search the sender of the letter, and the road movie-like scenario brings him back to his ex-girlfriends played by Sharon Stone, Frances Conroy, Jessica Lange, and Tilda Swinton.<br /><br />To avoid making vague commentaries about the elusive film, let me talk about the most obvious. Like Spike Lee, Jarmusch has never been good at handling female characters, and he shows it again. It looks as if the director is intent on making them as ordinary as possible, and except for too brief appearance of fantastic and unpredictable Tilda Swinton and the free-thinking daughter of Sharon Stone's character (whose one scene is just jaw-dropping), these female characters including the one played by Julie Delpy are all ciphers. Perhaps you may say this is exactly the point, but then what is the point of Don Juan's visiting these ciphers?<br /><br />The critics as always hailed this film as Jarmusch's masterpiece, but even they seem at a loss to pinpoint what really makes them think the film `beguiling' `existential' and `subtle.' I agree with all these words as far as Bill Murray and Jeffrey Wright are concerned, and I may feel differently when I'm the same age as Don, but honestly, for me, except the opening and ending parts, the film itself is too remote and detached, too slow-paced and self-indulgent to make me awake.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDNTB7377YH2.html">A1CDNTB7377YH2</a><br/><p>This is a movie where you wait for something to happen and nothing ever does!  What's worse is that the ending did not resolve the story.  Bill Murray as a kind of loser who receives an unsigned note from an old girlfriend claiming that he is the father of her child.  Murray seeks out 4 old girlfriends to find out who might have sent it.  The director tries to be cute by having the daughter of one of the women (named Lolita of course) walk around naked in front of him.  This was supposed to be the comedy in this film?  This movie lacks any real humor and should be avoided at all costs.</p></br><a href="../users/AKT8TGIT6VVZ5.html">AKT8TGIT6VVZ5</a><br/><p>I know that art house film goers and critics have praised with ample enthusiasm the work of Jim Jarmusch. However, judging from "Broken Flowers", the praise seems a bit overrated, unless it's mainly for the existentialist themes of his films, fine acting and cinematography. Bill Murray's Don Johnston, the main protagonist, is quite literally a male cipher, whom we, the audience, should have little empathy for. Having just broken up with his latest girlfriend (Julie Delpy, in yet another terrific role as a cynical, head-strong  young American), Johnston receives an anonymous letter from a long-lost flame, announcing that he has a 19 year-old son who is out somewhere looking for him. Aided and abetted by his computer geek friend Winston (Jeffrey Wright), Johnston travels across the United States on airplanes and rental cars, chasing down four of his long-lost loves, portrayed by Sharon Stone (as an over eager former cheerleader who realizes how much she misses Don), Frances Conroy (a successful real estate businesswoman with whom Don has a rather surreal dinner with her and her husband, Christopher McDonald; the latter gives a spellbinding performance as the husband), Jessica Lange (as an affluent "animal communicator" who may have a serious relationship with her young receptionist, portrayed by Chloe Sevigny),  and Tilda Swinton (as a poor white-trash Southern woman who reacts belligerently to Don's unexpected visit). The film is replete with many funny and sad moments about human relationships, so for these reasons alone it is worth seeing. However, those who may find maddening the slow pace and existentialist quality of Jarmusch's film should think twice before viewing it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1A535W556ROBQ.html">A1A535W556ROBQ</a><br/><p>It is really sad to see Bill Murray reduced to a caricature of middle age angst, rendered in an almost comatose state, as he sleep walked through this movie.  Jarmusch, who has given us such off-beat classics as Stranger than Paradise and Down By Law, seemed at a loss as to how to present suburbia, which made me wonder why he wanted to go there in the first place.  This movie plods along at its ineptitude pace as Murray, as Don Johnston, searches out a handful of girlfriends from the past, after receiving a mysterious note that he has a grown son.  We get cameos by Julie Delpy, Sharon Stone, Jessica Lange and an unrecognizable Tilda Swindon along the way, which shows you just how much cache Jarmusch has these days.  However, the stilted dialog barely holds the vapid scenes together.  About the only excitement is a brief peep show by Alexis Dziena as "Lolita."  I kid you not. And, the only real binding force is the selection of music by the Ethiopiques, given to Don by his neighbor Winston, who prods him into this road trip.  I can only hope that this completes this depressing cycle of movies for Murray, which included Rushmore and Lost in Translation.</p></br><a href="../users/AJMU8VVFKMZI4.html">AJMU8VVFKMZI4</a><br/><p>I can't decide whether Murray's performance is effortless or lazy.  I kept looking for this "Don Juan" to show up and I just didn't see what made him such a lady's man.  I found his neighbor Winston interesting.  I thought his love for mysteries endearing, plus, he seemed to know Don better than he knew himself.  As much as I found the subject matter interesting, the pacing can try the average viewer.  It was just a bit too slow for my taste and I really don't care for open endings like this.  But there are some things to like about the production.</p></br><a href="../users/AMP7TQRWAIE84.html">AMP7TQRWAIE84</a><br/><p>-- a partial quote from Bill himself; Don, in the movie.<br /><br />He chases these women from the past that he was involved with and asks all of them (except the one who hated that he showed) a series of questions when all he wants to know if he had a son he doesn't know about (with them).<br /><br />He searches and searches, as a series of events happen; he visits a long haired blond woman, who isn't home at the time. Her daughter is, however. She's very ditzy, but open. When she goes to answer the phone, and Don gets up to look at some pictures to help him find out more about the family, she comes back, stark naked, and doesn't even act like Don's there. Maybe she forgot or didn't care. Either way, she was beautiful.<br /><br />Most guys will go wild for this scene. She just turns, continues to talk on the phone and exits, going into another room or upstairs...(can't remember, wasn't paying attention to that!)<br /><br />The next lady he visits, after having no luck with the last is an animal communicator.<br />"Are you an animal psychic?" Don asks.<br />I laughed.<br />"No." she politely, yet seriously chimes. "I'm a communicator." she says, with a smile.<br />Then the cute cat is let in, and eventually Don asks,<br />"Is he saying anything?"<br />"Yes." she says. "He says that you have a hidden agenda." which was true.<br /><br />She lets the cat out and then as Don persuades her to walk him to his car, they walk out and at the car she doesn't tell much. All we know is that she was married and had one kid; a female who was only 16.<br /><br />Don searches and searches but you will have to watch it to see the ending and what he finds out.<br /><br />3.8 stars.<br /><br />End note: The quote was taken from the end of the movie...the movie was decent though. It kept my attention mostly, and turned out fine.</p></br><a href="../users/A10DB0H2NZF11E.html">A10DB0H2NZF11E</a><br/><p>Fun, but the ending is left open deliberately.  If you like Bill Murray and enjoy off beat films you will like this.</p></br><a href="../users/A13E0ARAXI6KJW.html">A13E0ARAXI6KJW</a><br/><p>Like his role models Yasujiro Ozu and Robert Bresson, accomplished indie filmmaker Jim Jarmusch provides his typically slow-moving, elliptical ride of a movie by placing Bill Murray squarely in the driver's seat of this sometimes hilarious, more often bittersweet road film. The episodic structure and constant sense of dislocation draw the viewer into an idiosyncratic world filled with knowing glances and almost subliminal comments. Your enjoyment of the film will depend on how much things need to be spelled out for you, as Jarmusch the screenwriter prefers to drive a story by insinuation.<br /><br />The plot, such as it is, revolves around lifelong bachelor Don Johnston, the subject of too many "Miami Vice" jokes, who opens a letter, typewritten on pink stationery, informing him that he has a 19-year-old son who may soon show up on his doorstep. The letter is unsigned, which tweaks the interest of Don's best friend and next-door neighbor Winston, an enthusiastic and persistent amateur sleuth. It is Winston who tracks down Don's ex-girlfriends across the country and organizes a trip for Don to meet and subtly ask each one a series of questions that may lead him to conclude who is the mother who penned the letter.<br /><br />The subsequent film really provides mini-showcases for four fine veteran actresses (Sharon Stone, Frances Conroy, Jessica Lange, Tilda Swinton), who pierce through the hearts of their characters with minimum fuss. Don pretty much remains a cipher throughout these encounters, as he gleans just enough information to tell him what he needs to know. He first meets up with Laura, a recent widow with an exhibitionist adolescent daughter named appropriately Lolita. Looking as beautiful as ever, Stone underplays her white trash role with surprising subtlety, even as she vividly describes her race car husband's fiery death and chats about her calling as a closet organizer.<br /><br />Next on Don's list is Dora, an uptight real estate agent married to a fellow glad-hand agent, who seems to be bubbling just below the surface about Don's sudden appearance. Conroy, ideally cast in a controlling variation of her Ruth Fisher character on "Six Feet Under", gives a nuanced performance of a woman cracking slowly within the walls of a perfect, pre-fab home. The next stop is at the office of renowned "animal communicator" Carmen, an edgy professional who has apparently abandoned men for animals and a misogynistic receptionist (played with an ideal sense of passive malice by Chlo? Sevigny). Lange plays Carmen in sharp, unapologetic detail, conveying the bitterness she holds toward the type of man Don represents to her.<br /><br />The last encounter is with an even more embittered biker chick named Penny, played with seething force by an almost completely unrecognizable Swinton, who is in turn, defended by a couple of hyper-sensitive, mullet-head bikers. What happens from all these episodes toward its intriguing conclusion will not satisfy those looking for closure, but Jarmusch provides enough emotional baggage for Don to recognize what his journey means to him and to us.<br /><br />Murray is his typical deadpan self here, but he still maintains that peculiar sense of goodwill he has without which the character would have been simply insufferable. With a Jamaican accent, Jeffrey Wright is wryly comical as Winston even as his curiosity gets the best of him. Also worth mentioning are Pell James' sweet turn as a sympathetic flower shop clerk and Mulatu Astatke's jazzy musical score. Well worth watching for those who like to come to their own interpretations when observing the lives presented by Jarmusch and their personal histories of which we can only speculate.</p></br><a href="../users/A16IXZW2A0NFR6.html">A16IXZW2A0NFR6</a><br/><p>I've alaways been a big Bill Murray fan, Ghostbusters, Rushmore, Groundhog Day, Kingpin, Caddyshack, The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou, Ed Wood and now Broken Flowers rate as some of his best performances to date. After the disappointing Lost in Translation which was praised as if it had been blessed by the buddha himself by every single critic under the sun, I wasn't sure if this was going to be another overrated, over hyped boring snoozer too. This one turned out to be a fresh highly original and beautifully acted film, equal parts humor and dramatic narrative, a movie with a heart and a brain. Bill Murray is in peak form here. Bill Murray has the ability that many actors whose primary income was based on comedic talents to switch effectivly between serious and tongue in cheeck hilarious with a blink of the eye. Highly recommended film. Funny,touching and tragic at times, a quality film that I wish we saw more of.</p></br><a href="../users/A2QHM5HBSIXRL4.html">A2QHM5HBSIXRL4</a><br/><p>If you thought Bill Murrary was underplaying in Focus Features' "Lost in Translation," he makes that role look like Tom Cruise on Oprah compared to what he puts on the screen here in "Broken Flowers."  Murray is completely believable as the undiagnosed yet obviously depressed, stuck and emotionally devoid Don Johnston.  A little pink envelope from a (ex-?)lover and wanna-be detective neighbor Winston (the great Jeffrey Wright) slowly but surely shakes Don from his moorings.<br /><br />I'll admit, like others, to feeling perplexed and unsatisfied by the ending.  However, I'll also own up to the fact that I completely missed a key clue in the movie, which - after realizing it later and piecing things together - I feel took me to a higher level of appreciation of Jim Jarmusch's direction.  Well played, Mr. Jarmusch.<br /><br />That's not to say "Broken Flowers" is on par with "Lost in Translation."  That was Murray's role of a lifetime - no question he deserved an Academy Award for that.  Let's hope for a make-up call here.<br /><br />And, what the world needs now is more Julie Delpy.  Her luminous presence at the beginning of "Broken Flowers" has me once again scratching my head trying to figure out why every director in Hollywood isn't beating down her door.  This smart, attractive actress should be on everyone's A-list.  Anyone who disagrees needs to watch her Nina Simone impression at the end of "Before Sunset."  She's so pitch-perfect and fetching, you'll be slack-jawed.</p></br><a href="../users/ABSX5TGEGRH76.html">ABSX5TGEGRH76</a><br/><p>Bill Murray's character of Don Johnston bears a few similarities to the character that he played in Lost In Translation, which was also produced by Focus Features.  Both of them are rich men who have hit a wall in their lives, and are having trouble with the women in their lives.  I had heard many good things about this movie, and the fact that it was produced by the same people who did Lost in Translation, one of my favorite movies, made me even more excited.  The result, however, wasn't everything that I hoped that it'd be.<br /><br />As I said, Johnston is having trouble with women, in the sense that he can't really hold on to one.  His neighbor and friend Winston (Jeffrey Wright) often notes that Don is like Don Juan, and many people call attention to the fact that his name sounds like Don Johnson.  Don seems to go through girlfriends pretty quickly.  His latest woman, Sherry (Julie Delpy) has just left him, and he finds an annonymous letter from an old flame saying that he fathered a son about 19 years earlier.  At first, he has no interest in what may be a prank, but Winston, who sees himself as a detective-in-training, encourages him to pursue his mystery son, and soon, Don has compiled a list of 5 possible women who may have had his child.  After a few internet searches, Don is on his way.<br /><br />On his journey, he reconnects with a few of his former girlfriends, each of whom are living very different lives in very different places.  The first woman, Laura (Sharon Stone), is a widow living with her young (and possibly nudist) daughter (Alexis Dziena).  Dora (Frances Conroy) is a subdued real estate agent living under the passive aggressive Ron (Christopher McDonald), while Carmen (Jessica Lange) is an animal communicator who may have a certain bond with her receptionist (Chlo? Sevigny).  Penny (Tilda Swinton) lives in the middle of nowhere in the deep south, while the fifth woman is confronted under different circumstances.<br /><br />The events of the search are both humorous (though not laugh-out-loud funny) and sad.  Some of them show regret for leaving Don, while others wish that he'd never shown up in their lives.  Others have problems with their current men.  Unfortunately, most of the events prior to the journey and what happens afterward aren't as interesting.  I will say that at the very end, his talk with a young boy (Mark Webber) seemed to be leading up to a certain ending, only to have something else happen.  While I was definitely expecting a very non-Hollywood ending, what we got was, in my opinion, a little unsatisfying.  I didn't hate it, but there was something missing in my opinion.<br /><br />I'm going to try not to give too much away, but I think that writer/director Jim Jarmusch wanted us to draw our own conclusions about certain things using the themes of the film, such as the color pink, daughters, and sons.  All in all, this film wasn't bad, it's just very different (not that different is a bad thing).</p></br><a href="../users/AXFI7TAWD6H6X.html">AXFI7TAWD6H6X</a><br/><p>I have been anticipating the release of "Broken Flowers" for a few weeks now. Ever since "Lost in Translation", I have fell in love with Bill Murray's films all over again. His film roles of lately have been quirky and very interesting to watch. Unfortunately I can't really say the same for "Broken Flowers". The premise of the film is interesting. Don Johnston (Bill Murray) discovers through a mysterious letter that he (supposedly) has a 20 year old son. With the insistence of his neighbor Winston (Jeffrey Wright), Don goes out on a search to find out who wrote the letter and who his son is. He pays a visit to Sharon Stone, Frances Conroy, Jessica Lange, and Tilda Swinton.<br /><br />I found myself a bit bored with the film. The traveling scenes were not necessary. I would have liked to have seen less of Don's visit with Frances Conroy (which for me dragged on longer than it should have been)and more with Tilda Swinton. I thought Don's past with Tilda's character Penny appealed to me the most. I would have liked to have known more about their past relationship. Bill's performance in this film seemed kind of a drag. Jeffrey Wright as Winston stole the film for me. I liked the premise of the film. It is too bad the writing was rather weak.</p></br><a href="../users/A22RY8N8CNDF3A.html">A22RY8N8CNDF3A</a><br/><p>My first point - Bill Murray's performance detracts from the film. He's a 'downer' from start to finish. Second, the ending is terrible - Murray has met a young boy that might be his son. Murray repels the boy by asserting that he knows the boy is looking for his father. Boy runs off. End of movie. What was the point? 3)The entire movie, start to finish, is boring. It's about Murray looking for a woman who might have born his son 19 years ago, and at the same time that 19-year-old looking for his father.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KROYMQ61M7A.html">A3KROYMQ61M7A</a><br/><p>Of course here, he can't be 'Carl<br /><br />Spackler funny', but you get the point!<br /><br />Comptuer man (no-no, stop laughing)<br /><br />Don Johnson (no, not the one from<br /><br />Miami Vice) is a self made millionaire,<br /><br />bored out of skull and sitting around the<br /><br />home watching classic movies and waiting<br /><br />for the mail to arrive every day. One day<br /><br />he gets an anonimous letter from one of<br /><br />his former ladies in the past and tells<br /><br />him he has a child, boy, 19, who has<br /><br />run away from her and may be on the way<br /><br />to look up Don. He shows the letter to a<br /><br />neighbor, an eithiopian man named Winston<br /><br />who tells him (Don) that HE MUST find out<br /><br />wether he has a son and by whom. Winston<br /><br />uses Don's credit card and rents cars,<br /><br />hotels, et, al and plans at trip to<br /><br />the cities of the four women who MAY<br /><br />be the mother of Don's child. Murray's<br /><br />character gets more than he bargains for<br /><br />when he goes a-lookin'! And despite some<br /><br />good drama from Murray (the first we've<br /><br />seen since 'The Razor's Edge' remake back<br /><br />in '84 (***), and some laughs, the ending<br /><br />really sucks! I won't give it away but<br /><br />it really disappointed me greatly. A good<br /><br />movie nonetheless. See it with a girlfriend.<br /><br />It beats the horrid 'Broke Back Mountain'!</p></br><a href="../users/A2BEU7GPGNIG44.html">A2BEU7GPGNIG44</a><br/><p>Bill Murray stars in the film Broken Flowers as an middle aged "Don Juan," who isn't getting any younger. He wears track suits every day and has a sexy young girlfriend who leaves him at the beginning of the film. When he receives a mysterious letter that claims that he is the father of an adult son he never knew existed he doesn't know if the letter is a hoax or if he really has a son out there. His Jamaican friend Winston (Jeffrey Wright) is intrigued by the mysterious letter and relentlessly urges Don Johnston (Murray's character), to pursue the women he was with at the time to find out if he really has a son out there.<br /><br />Broken Flowers is an intriguing film about a subject matter that is constantly in the tabloids and on daytime television. Bill Murray once again offers an excellent dead pan on performance as Don Johnston who seems to careless about solving the mystery. When he finally cleans himself up and sets out to find the women from his past the story really heats up. Broken Flowers features Sharon Stone, Frances Conroy, Jessica Lange and Tilda Swinton.</p></br><a href="../users/A16QODENBJVUI1.html">A16QODENBJVUI1</a><br/><p>Thank god!  After one of the worst summers for movies in years, we needed a thoughtful, subtle, quietly intelligent film to balance out the horrors of the previous months.  I have long been an admirer of Jim Jarmusch, having seen STRANGER THAN PARADISE the first weekend it was shown in Chicago and all of his subsequent films.  This is, in my opinion, one of his very finest films.  It is also another surprisingly fine performance by Bill Murray, who in his mid-fifties has put together a string of unexpectedly excellent performances.  For those who still think of his more from his over-the-top, gonzo roles of the early eighties, these roles could almost stand as the the complete antithesis of what he used to do.  Indeed, it would be hard to find many performers who could contrast the goofiness of Murray's role in CADDYSHACK with this role in BROKEN FLOWERS.  If in the former he crazily managed to generate all kinds of rage at gophers, here he manages to suppress any kind of rage at all.  In fact, Murray's Don Johnston in this film is like someone from whom all hints of human emotion have been sucked clean.<br /><br />Structurally, this movie reminded me somewhat of Bergman's WILD STRAWBERRIES, in which an older man (in the Bergman a quite old man) takes a trip during which he is forced to confront the life he has been denied by the life choices he has (or has not) made.  After Johnston's girlfriend (played by Julie Delphy) leaves him, he receives a pink-enveloped note in the mail in which someone anonymously informs him that twenty years earlier when they had an affair, she has become pregnant and had a child of whom he was unaware, a child who was now a 19-year-old boy who could possibly be coming in search of him.  Prodded by his next door neighbor Winston (marvelously played by Jeffrey Wright), Johnston compiles a list of potential mothers of a child from that time, and goes off in search of clues as to who the authoress of the note might be.<br /><br />Johnston's journey involves visiting five former girlfriends, four living and one deceased.  One is the widow (played nicely by Sharon Stone) of a NASCAR driver who is also the mother of an absurdly sensual teenaged girl improbably named Lolita (who wears ear rings that mimic the famous sunglasses worn by Sue Lyon in Stanley Kubrick's LOLITA).  Another (played by SIX FEET UNDER's Frances Conroy) is a real estate agent married to a mildly irritating fellow agent.  A third ex (played by Jessica Lange) is an animal communicator, author of several quite odd books, and, it is hinted, a lesbian.  His most unpleasant encounter is with a former girlfriend who has become a backwoods societal drop out (played by the very nearly unrecognizable Tilda Swinton, who wears a long black wig to hide her red hair).  None of these apparently the mother of his possible son, though several are vague possibilities.<br /><br />Though Murray starts off the film as someone incapable of human emotion, as if he just can't be bothered to care, by the end some subtle new emotions begin to assert themselves, such as regret, sadness, remorse.  None of the people he meets have spectacularly enviable lives, but one senses that Johnston has understood his own complete lack of a personal history, his lack of a network of significant human relations.  The film ends with his meeting a young man he mistakenly believes might be the son searching for him.  Though a profoundly cold person, we see by the end that he is someone who yearns for more, and is forced to confront the lack of anything at all significant.<br /><br />This is truly one of the loveliest movies I have seen in quite a while, and it forms a nice trilogy with Murray's two previous significant roles in LOST IN TRANSLATION and THE LIFE AQUATIC.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>Don Johnston (Bill Murray) receives an anonymous pink letter notifying him that he may have a nineteen year old son who may be looking for him. At a bit of a cross roads in his life; his current girlfriend (Julie Delpy) has just dumped him, he is a bit lost, unsure what to do with the money he made from the Internet boom. He sits in his house, in the dark, thinking, watching old movies, contemplating. His next door neighbor, Winston (Jeffrey Wright), a father with five kids, three jobs and a penchant to become a detective, suggests he visit each of the five women he had relationships with during this period. After some research, Winston determines one of the women died, but comes up with an itinerary to visit the other four. Don is certain that if anything, the letter is a joke, but eventually agrees to Winston's elaborate game, more because he doesn't have anything else to do. Don sets off on his journey and eventually visits Laura (Sharon Stone), Dora (Frances Conroy), Carmen (Jessica Lange) and Penny (Tilda Swinton).<br /><br />"Broken Flowers", the newest film from writer/ director Jim Jarmusch, is a very good study of one man's journey for meaning in his life. The film is funny at times, touching at times and very, very slow. The pacing is almost glacial. There are a lot of shots which end with Bill Murray's character staring off screen as the film does a slow (very slow) fade away. I don't mind this, but I feel that people should be aware of it before they go. Unfortunately, much like people feel it is okay to talk in theaters because they are conditioned to watching DVDs at home, and talking during the film, people are conditioned to expect a faster pace in their films. The majority of films released today barely hold an image for two seconds, so afraid that the attention of the audience will wander. If a film is for adults, don't worry about this. But I think Jarmusch takes it to the other extreme in "Flowers", the slow fades are nice, but there are too many and they impact the film.<br /><br />Murray is clearly making a new cottage industry for himself. In his last few films, which were, coincidentally, his most well-reviewed films, he plays very quiet people, observing a lot of the action around him, essentially transforming himself into the straight man. In "Lost in Translation", he played an actor in Japan, making a commercial, lost in the sea of culture swirling around him. In "Flowers", he plays a role which is even more cerebral, but the portrayal works. We watch Johnston as he thinks about things. Not exactly thrilling on paper, but Murray makes it work.<br /><br />Jarmusch sets up the film to allow Murray to react to the various characters he comes into contact with. His relationship with Winston, played by Jeffrey Wright, is humorous and adds a lot to the portrayal of each. For Murray, this solidifies our feelings that he is lost, nothing to do, nothing to care about. When Winston presents him with the plan, Johnston is so reluctant to participate that when he eventually does, we get the depth of his longing for something to do.<br /><br />Wright's character is funny and multifaceted. With five kids, three jobs and a hobby, he is a ball of energy compared to Murray, which also adds a lot of depth to Murray's character. Their relationship is unique, funny and interesting. When Winston calls Don, Johnston springs (well, for his character anyway) over to his house to help.<br /><br />As Johnston visits each of his former girlfriends, he reacts to the craziness in each of their lives. Two of these works really well, the other two don't, creating an uneven balance. Stone and Lange seem to have the most richly observed characters. Their lives are unique and strange, polar opposites from each other, allowing Murray to react and create some real, genuine laughter. Conroy's Dora is stiff and emotionless and I didn't get any connection between them. Dora's husband (Christopher McDonald) is slightly amusing, but the sequence is too long. Conversely, Tilda Swinton's Penny is on screen for all of two minutes, making her role the shortest and most difficult to accept and understand.<br /><br />A couple of times, people mistake Don's name for the former "Miami Vice" star. He quietly corrects them. This seems like a joke that wasn't completely worked out. Is Jarmusch trying to make fun of Don Johnson's past? If so, the idea seems half-baked.<br /><br />It seems odd to me that Murray is receiving so much acclaim for such low key performances. His performances are so good, that he deserves the acclaim, but for someone who started his career in high energy comedies, the transformation is all the more remarkable. I thought Murray was great in "Lost in Translation" and he is very good here. But after "Translation", "Life Aquatic" and now "Broken Flowers", each performance seems to have slightly less energy, as though he is simply content to stand and react. And the performances work. But I wonder if his next film will feature him sleeping through the entire film. It seems like the next natural step. And Murray will no doubt make it work.<br /><br />"Broken Flowers" is a very good, but not great film. It features a very good performance from Murray and some interesting supporting characters. But the pacing is so slow and the supporting performances are uneven, robbing the film of lasting interest, greatness and longevity.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L8HRCM60W0W7.html">A1L8HRCM60W0W7</a><br/><p>Oh boy. Enough with the artifice of minimalism. Murray's latest bare-bones entry seems like a quick slide down to being a one-trick pan-faced pony. Lost in Translation was slick and novel for its time, even had some genuine cross-cultural humor thrown in. The Life Aquatic was quirky in bits if too sporadic for a general audience. But Broken Flowers' strained effort at being a soulful existentialist pondering just got my dander up.<br /><br />The theme, I admit, is intriguing. Don (Murray) is a middle aged man leading a pitifully listless life. One day he gets an anonymous pink letter saying he had fathered a kid twenty years ago. Egged on by his faux-detective Ethiopian friend, he sets off to interrogate all his ex girlfriends. The vivid assortment of these women -- Sharon Stone as an isolationist closet organizer, Jessica Lange as a flaky animal communicator, Tilda Swinton as a redneck biker woman, and Frances Conroy as a button-down prefab real estate agent -- gives the film its only promise of flavor in contrast to Don's banal existence. I recall a couple of moments that I found amusing enough to blurt out laughing.<br /><br />But in a stylish statement of keep-the-audience-guessing, everything goes unexplained, unexplored. Why does Don not own a computer despite having made his fortune in the computer business? Why had none of his relationships worked out?<br /><br />The pace, slower than a barrel of tree slugs, seems moody at first. I began by enjoying the great economy with which Murray plays his part; we can almost see through his transparent countenance to figure what he is thinking. But it quickly gets tiresome. He spends endless minutes driving at what seems like 5 mph, or gawking at roadside walls, or sitting in awkward sullenness across the table from his counterparts. There is even a gratuitous faux-Lolita nudity moment thrown in, which, like much else, amounts to very little.<br /><br />At the end of it all we are probably expected to tie all those loose strands into a conception that should make it all amusing and oh-so-thoughtful. "Live in the present" is the bankrupt philosophy that we are left to mull over, which seems rather apt, because beyond that disappointed moment in the theatre when the credits suddenly started rolling, this is an utterly forgettable, insipid exercise in Murrayism, built on the assumption that some newfangled Ethiopian jazz (which sounds like a Gotan Project recording on an African safari) will make up for the spice that the storytellers clearly forgot to bring to the table.<br /><br />A largely boring film with a cavalcade of big name stars that should appeal to pedantic critics, or people looking for a good background for a comfortable afternoon nap. One hopes Murray's upcoming vehicles will attempt to be a bit more upbeat than his recent capers.</p></br><a href="../users/A2LW5AL0KQ9P1M.html">A2LW5AL0KQ9P1M</a><br/><p>I'm torn. The pace of the film was (MUCH) slower than I expected, but couple that with the relentless, bruising heartache it inspires ... well, this work may have been just too painful for me (personally).<br /><br />The acting was spot-on. Murray is playful and tender in his role as Don (Juan) Johnston. Though he has made (and makes) some bad decisions, the viewer is never pitted against him (if we were - if hating him were easy - this film wouldn't be as potent). Likewise, Stone is fantastic in her small but memorable role. In fact, I didn't even notice that she was playing "Laura" until several minutes of her being on-screen. She was just "Laura." Finally, Jeffrey Wright is wonderful as Winston ... Johnston's best (only?) friend. His quirky role is well-written and excellently played.<br /><br />The music is stark. Even much of the soundtrack is diegetic in nature (we hear the music to which Johnston listens). This dramatically contributes to the overall sense of crushing bleakness. It is just so quiet ... contemplative.<br /><br />There are many inside-jokes for lovers of film and literature (which I found entertaining). Lolita's giant heart-earrings (framing her face) were clever (see the poster to Kubrick's adaptation). Likewise, the notion of her wanting to share Popsicles with Johnston is equally amusing. And just when you thought the joke would stop there ... it goes OVER THE TOP (no spoilers from me). But, unlike some, I found this moment neither offensive nor distasteful ... I found it outrageous and hysterical.<br /><br />Still, watching Johnston look for his child in the eyes of every teen-age boy that passes him (the "model," the boy outside the airport, the kid in the car ...) it becomes more than poignant ... it becomes (again) too much. And all the cosmic-collisions and "coincidences" ... it begins to feel like the universe is conspiring against this relatively harmless man (and I mean "relatively" in the grand-scheme ... since the impassioned reaction of two of the women reveals Johnston's guilt).<br /><br />I think that Jarmusch has created a truthful film ... but it may be more truth than I (personally) am prepared for (but this is me ... I felt similarly about Reed's "The Break-Up" ... night and day comparison, I know). But kudos for creating a sensitive, engaging film which breaks from mainstream dreck. I will continue to experiment with this director's work.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BPDFR58H9575.html">A2BPDFR58H9575</a><br/><p>Bill Murray stars as an aging Don Juan (yes, sure, I just got it - his character's name is Don Johnston ) who is so deadly bored with his life and his much younger beautiful girlfriend (I assume his girlfriends have been always much younger and beautiful, and a man may actually get tired and bored with it) that he does not seem alive at all. One day, his latest girlfriend leaves him and at the same day a mysterious pink letter informs him that he could have a 19 year old son. Reluctantly, literally pushed by his friend and neighbor, an amateur private detective Winston (Jeffrey Wright), Don visits his four formers lovers (Sharon Stone (she organizes people's closets and has a teenage daughter Lolita (and Lolita she is ), Frances Conroy (a realtor with a loving husband and a big and sadly quiet house), Jessica Lange (she does not drink, she does not eat, she does not walk - but she can read the animals' minds); and Tilda Swinton, in a surprising role of a white trash who has a lot to say to Don but...does not. Instead, two of her intimidating friends do). This movie has been praised as a humorous cross-country journey a-la Jim Jarmush - anti-Hollywood style but I think that it is one of the scariest horror movies I've seen - "from the lives of zombies" and Bill Murray is the best zombie I've seen. Will he find out if he actually has a son? Do zombies have children? Do I care?</p></br><a href="../users/A1SPB225CVTRUU.html">A1SPB225CVTRUU</a><br/><p>Broken Flowers is no doubt a star-showcase film for Bill Murray, since he is in every single scene, and he managed to delivered a heartfelt if not as funny as his Lost In Translation<br />performance. This film didn't work well as a comedy, because it's rather slow-paced, conversational, and a lack of jokes. There are numerous silent moments when Murray performs solo scenes, and it seemed like a waste of screentime, considered that the actresses in this film had very little screentime. Murray's interactions with the ex-girlfriend characters were far more captivating and entertaining than the scenes of him observing other people or having flashbacks at the airport and in the plane.<br /><br />Bill Murray plays an over-the-hill playboy named Don Johnston  as his current girlfriend Sherry(Julie Delpy) calls him before leaving him to do some self-discovery, and confronts to him that she felt like a mistress to him even when he's not even married at his age. Don receives an anonymous letter from one of his ex-friends telling him that he has a 19 year-old son and is on the way to find him. He's surprised and confused, and had to seek the advice of his neighbour Winston(Jeffrey Wright). From there Don would travel on the roads and flights to visit his four ex-girlfriends in hoping to unsolve the mystery.<br /><br />Sharon Stone plays Laura, a single mother with an ultra-precocious teenage daughter named Lolita(Alexis Dziena), who was always walking around either naked or in bikinis inside the house. Don wondered why Laura would give such a name to her daughter. Frances Conray plays Dora, who's happily married to Ron(Christopher McDonald), and they are successful in realty business. She was very suprised by the unexpected visit from Don, and it was obvious that she still has feeling for him. Jessica Lange plays a lawyer turned "animal communicator", and she's by far the most eccentric of them all. Her intense and controlling assistant is played by the scene stealing Chloe Sevigny. Finally, the least exposed Tilda Swinton plays Penny, an angry woman resided next to two mean truckers in an isolated area.<br /><br />As a fan of Tilda Swinton, Jessica Lange, and especially Julie Delpy who was unforgetable in last year's Before Sunset, I was kind of disappointed that they all had less than ten minutes of screentime. Of all the female characters in this film, the most striking were Sharon Stone and Frances Conray. Jeffrey Wright provided some comic relief moments opposite Murray. Overall, Murray is very good with his restraint and subtle expressions. Even though this is a flawed movie, but Murray's Oscar-caliber performance is quite worthwhile, and the supporting cast is just irresistable.</p></br><a href="../users/A4PPZNQF1X2IY.html">A4PPZNQF1X2IY</a><br/><p>I was excited to see this movie as I love Rushmore and was<br /><br />moderately pleased with Lost in T.  Although the movie starts<br /><br />out well with the ever cynical Murray in his dark apartment<br /><br />with choice music and the intrigue of his sleuthing friend,<br /><br />the movie goes nowhere afterwards.  Just the repetition of<br /><br />the 4 plane/car trips, and the quirky old-flames that add<br /><br />almost zero humor and just detract from any focus the story<br /><br />had.  The ending is somewhat sensible (as it shows he's learned<br /><br />nothing), but also lackluster.  In total, although Murray<br /><br />is excellent at playing the cynical, nothing-to-lose character,<br /><br />it is getting a bit dull seeing him trod through stories<br /><br />exclusively in this roll, especially when the script is rather<br /><br />lacking.</p></br><a href="../users/A19JYLHD94K94D.html">A19JYLHD94K94D</a><br/><p>Broken Flowers is, in many ways, not a typical film for Jim Jarmusch. But then again, what is? After twenty five years of work, Jarmusch is still one of the most original and creative directors in the US. Broken Flowers is not, by any means, his best; it is his most sensitive and most mature, though. Many have blamed Jarmusch of going mainstream on this film. That's partly true - in the sense that it conforms to film-genre norms more than any of his previous films. By that I mean: Dead Man (1995) was a western that was an antithesis to every other western in the world. Ghost Dog (1998) was a gangster film and a samurai film, and at the same time it was absolutely neither. Broken Flowers doesn't actively challenge Hollywood; instead, it's a study in character and in human life. As such, it's the most personal, most beautiful film that Jim had pulled yet, and it manages to do what films like Sideways have tried to do in recent years but just didn't get right.<br /><br />More than it is a triumph for Jarmusch, Broken Flowers is a triumph for Bill Murray, who plays Don Johnston, an aging Don Juan who receives a letter regarding a long lost son, and sets out to find which of his old flames the mother is. Like most of Jarmusch's films, the premise is simple, and the film is slow and minimalist, but the combined strengths of Jarmusch's direction and script and of Murray's performance make it a powerful experienced. Murray, who had spent much of his youth as a successful mainstream comedic actor, had in the last few years, with a chain of critically acclaimed films that included Rushmore, Lost In Translation and The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou, based himself as one of the most talented and intelligent actors at the fringes of Hollywood. His poker-face, which shows none and yet reveals all, comes to wonderful use in the role of Don, which in a way is further development of the character he created in Sofia Coppola's beautiful Lost In Translation, and it may just be the most brilliant performance of his career - yet.<br /><br />The rest of the small cast is absolutely flawless; like in most of Jarmusch's films, in Broken Flowers Don is the only true major character, but he's better defined by the fascinating personalities surrounding him. Four stellar actresses - Sharon Stone, Frances Conroy (Six Feet Under's Ruth Fisher), Jessica Lange and Tilda Swinton, play the women in Don's life, each one shedding her own unique light on him; Jeffrey Wright (Basquiat, Angels in America), one of the most humble and underrated actors in Hollywood today, is fantastic as Don's neighbor Winston; Julie Delpy (Killing Zoe), Alexis Dziena, Christopher McDonald, Pell James and Mark Webber (Hollywood Ending) are all worthy of praise as well.<br /><br />You can say that Jarmusch has gone 'middle of the road', but the fact is that all his marks are here, color and all; and none of it is fake, he's still one of the most sincere and most original creators in America. His unique approach to cinematography, to pacing, to editing and to music (Ethiopian fusion artist Mulatu Astatke does for Broken Flowers what John Lurie did for Down By Law, Neil Young for Dead Man, and RZA for Ghost Dog, and Jarmusch's fusion of music into the film is as seamless as it always is) are fresher and more creative than anything seen in any mainstream film and Broken Flowers is probably the most beautiful film we'll see this year.</p></br><a href="../users/A23L2BR07AOBG1.html">A23L2BR07AOBG1</a><br/><p>I have seen Jim Jarmusch's earlier work (Stranger than Paradise) as well as his later work (Ghost Dog) and so I had an idea about what he'd do with this film, but the cast also got me excited once I heard about them.  One thing that's most striking about the film is the use of silence to convey things.  Jarmusch uses it in part to signal the awkwardness of everyday conversation and experience as well as for the purpose of outlining what his character is like.  He has no problem having minutes of silence where the only realization is that the main character is bored, lives a boring life,  and has no desire to really do anything remotely interesting.  These things add up to an experience that most filmgoers are not going to appreciate, or like.  Most people are trained to believe that everything that makes it into the film must be interesting, when in actuality the rule is that everything that makes it into the film must be in the film.  That last sentence is not meant to suggest that the film doesn't have interesting moments, because it does it's just that the film doesn't feel it's necessary to interesting from beginning to end. The run through of the story is that Don Johnston is a wealthy man who's trade was computers and now he doesn't even have computer at home.  His girlfriend leaves him and notes that he just recieved a letter that is probably from another one of his girlfriends. He reads it and is nonplussed. It is an anonymous letter stating that he has a son and the son has come looking for him, he reads this to a friend who interested in writing mystery novels so the friend looks into solving the myster for him by setting up detailed plans for Don to seek and find out who the mother is.  He goes to all of the women he was with at the time, that he remembers and follows a simple plan (he brings pink flowers, since the envelope and paper it was written on were in pink and it was typed on a typewriter, so he asks about them when he goes).  Each woman presents an entirely different obstacle for Don to overcome.  With the first woman it's her daughter, with the second it's her husband, with the third it's her receptionist, with the fourth it's her boyfriend (?) and his friend and the fifth girl is dead.  Some of these encounters are funny, some are violent, and some are uncomfortable.  Mainly I find it interesting how Jarmusch decided to make a movie about a character who doesn't want a movie made about him, wouldn't care if there was, and has not interest in seeing it even if he lived next to the theatre. Making the main character a reluctant and offbeat character enhances this story in a way that obviously won't appeal to many people, but it appealed to me. Also, the acting in some of the scenes was simply excellent. For instance, the scene in which he goes to see his former lover who has become a real estate broker and he ends up eating dinner with them. In this scene Christopher McDonald is simply great. Although the film has a relaxed attitude about the mystery that spurs the action forward, it still has some interesting features of the most interesting mysteries.  It has plotlines and clues that may or may not lead to anything.  I'm not giving anything away by saying that this film leaves some of the mystery wide open while dispelling some of it. What's also funny about this mystery are the dreams he has where he's internally processing different things he notices during his journeys.  You wonder if they will actuall lead to anything and that is something I will leave to those who to see the movie to find out.  As for Murray, I like this part of his career just as much as when he was younger.  He may be funny, but now he's working on being more than that and in this film some of his decisions are divisive, but I'm glad that he's making them because they make his characters more individual and you can't just say that they're the "The stock Bill Murray character." I wouldn't have given the film a prize persay, but enjoy it nonetheless.</p></br><a href="../users/A9I40WFF40R4.html">A9I40WFF40R4</a><br/><p>Don Johnston (Bill Murray) just after his latest alliance walks out on him gets a mysterious unsigned letter (all in pink) supposedly from an old lover informing him that he sired a son 19 years ago and that that child is on a search to find his father. Don's nextdoor neighbor convinces that he should go on a road trip to interview the possible candidates for the author of the letter and comes up with the names of five woman, four living and one deceased.<br /><br />The rest of the movie essentially is about Johnston's quest. Bill Murray is a terrific actor, having great timing. He is joined by other good actors, particularly Sharon Stone and Jessica Lange; but their fine performanes do not keep this movie from dragging. The last movie I rented was "The Brown Bunny." I am sorry to say that this film reminded me a lot of more of that dog than I would have liked. Some of the driving scenes are almost as slow. Even Chloe Sevigny makes an appearance here but this time as the assistant to Jessica Lange, the "animal communicator," rather than as a specialist in oral sex.<br /><br />I really wanted this film to be a lot better.</p></br><a href="../users/AS6SH2JM2YY3H.html">AS6SH2JM2YY3H</a><br/><p>Please!  Bill Murray, as Don Johnston in Broken Flowers, has zero personality (but women are attracted to him in the spirit of male fantasy), horrible communication skills (but the women don't mind that he has none), and the most one-dimensional facial expression I've seen since...  Lost in Translation.<br /><br />Don Johnston gets an anonymous note stating that his 19 or so year old son (it's the first time he's heard of it) will be paying him a visit.  In an orchestrated preemptive strike, he visits his list of "usual suspects."<br /><br />After the second visit, you can predict the personality types of the remaining two old girlfriends.  I give you a 95% chance of getting it right.<br /><br />The acting is bad, the dialogue is horrible, the realism is nil...  brrrr.<br /><br />Note that the director also makes it impossible to ever, ever figure out where in the heck Johnston (Murray) is traveling to visit his old flames.  No cities mentioned, no signs in the photos, or distinguishing features in the scenery.<br /><br />The film went from bad to worse.  For all the women out there reading this review, please avoid all men that fit the Don Johnston profile.  You'd be much better off dating the Scarecrow in the Wizard of Oz.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HJB9J5O5CLPB.html">A2HJB9J5O5CLPB</a><br/><p>I gave a thumbs up for all reviews both hating and loving. The truth is, this film is good awful.<br /><br />Bill Murray takes his Lost in Translation, emotion dead character to further extremes.  It's almost like watching the Weekend with Bernie, dead guy, visiting his four ex's of a certain time to find out which one sent the letter telling about a son he has sired twenty years before.  Don Johnston is sort of a Don Juan, but we never see his talents as a Romeo, but rather, we see the results.<br /><br />Go ahead; suddenly show up at an ex-lover's door twenty years after the fact.  What's their reaction?  Sharon Stone jumps back into bed with him.  Her daughter is Lolita.  Then he visits the Real Estate woman.  Are the pearls she's wearing the one's he gave her?  Julie Deloy plays it deliciously restrained; yet, she is very attractive for a middle-age gal.  Her husband is a silver-fox fake. Then there's the pet whisperer.  She's a bitch. Then there's the biker girl with a real bad attitude, but watch out for her boyfriends.<br /><br />Yes, there's too many shots of Murray just sitting there, but there are also true shots of kitch Americana.  You must have an IQ over 120 to view this material.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TWTULVD6F22O.html">A1TWTULVD6F22O</a><br/><p>Jarmusch's movie is startling and bold, in a somnolent sort of way. Jarmusch is all about symbolism, and Murray is perfect for the role of Don Johnston, a wealthy bachelor who lives through life, seemingly emotionless.  His angst over losing girlfriend Julie Delpy at the film's beginning, is buried deeply, and shown only in the way he sleeps and wakes...a deadish man who makes a feeble attempt to talk Delpy into staying.  As she leaves, the mail she leaves contains a letter from an old lover who doesn't identify herself, other than to say that Johnston has a son who is 19 years old.<br /><br />Enter Don's neighbor, Winston (the very capable Jeffrey Wright).  His life  is 180 degrees away from his friend Don's.  His house, bursting at the seams with his glowing wife and 5 children, is full of toys.  Despite the fact that he has three jobs, he is writing a mystery novel.  Don's mysterious letter (in a pink envelope) is a goldmine for Winston, and he determines that Don will pursue this mystery, and must provide a list of potential mothers - lovers from 20 years prior.<br /><br />From the reluctantly prepared list Winston culls not only addresses, he mapquests the instructions to reach each house and books Don's flights and rental cars.  Don is reluctant, but can't afford to turn down this slice of life that Winston offers.  He embarks on the journey.<br /><br />The movie breaks down a little for me here...the repetitive shots of Don flying in and out of airports get on one's nerves, particularly since Don never seems to go anywhere different.  The five women are all located off the beaten path from each airport, and Jarmusch is careful not to identify the cities with landmarks.  In truth, the scenery is so similar for each location (kind of an upstate NY-Jersey-PA small town trip) that you wonder if Jarmusch is making a statement about the fact that all of Don's loves have chosen similar scenery, or if perhaps the film just didn't have enough funding to make the womens' locations more diverse.  A nagging point for me.<br /><br /> There's a running small gag about Don's rental cars and hotels...although he can afford much better, Winston has economized with different color Ford Taurus' and chain motels located off busy highways.  The audience picks up on Don's silent notation of Winston's predicted clues; a woman who likes pink, signs of a young man in the house (in this case, the existence of a basketball hoop in each location).<br /><br />Following Winston's plan, Johnston drops in on the four women from his past (Sharon Stone, Frances Conroy, Jessica Lange, and Tilda Swinton). In these scenarios, Jarmusch focuses on the color pink...they color of the flowers Johnston invariably brings to each of the women, following Winston's orders, and the increasing focus on the color he encounters from each visit.  Each woman is more and more intense, and each vignette turns up the volume on the symbolism of the color.  Johnston is greeted unfailingly with surprise, as though each of the women knew that, by his choice, he would never see them again (out of sight and out of mind; younger women are available!).<br /><br />These vignettes with the women shed some light on Johnston, but Jarmusch, I was led to believe, shot them with the focus on the women themselves, and not Johnston's reaction to them.<br /><br />As Laura, Sharon Stone is lush and cheap- her daughter Lolita shows sexual significance and eroticism that the viewer believes she copies from her mother.  Young Lolita shocks even the jaded Johnston.  With only a daughter, clearly Laura did not send the letter. Laura's wantonness and availability lead Johnston to spend the night; a decision he clearly regrets in the morning.  Stone is as "dead on" in her portrayal as an actress can be.<br /><br />Frances Conroy, as Dora,  shows rapid aging and deterioration found in women married to a control freak who successfully subjugates them without abuse or violence.  Ron (Christopher McDonald, who has appeared in countless roles on TV), the monstrous husband, has her in a cookie cutter house and sneers at the picture of the young Dora in hippie garb and flowers, that she keeps to remind her of who she once was.  It is unclear if Dora has a child...she responds that she has no children with Ron.  Johnston is understandably uncomfortable in this house where violence simmers behind the carefully groomed shrubs and carefully groomed owners.  He leaves after being forced to stay for dinner.  Jarmusch again uses quiet symbolism in the food Johnston is served...it clearly reflects the life that Dora now leads.<br /><br />Jessica Lange has always been a powerful actress, and hers is a rich role.  An attorney when he knew her, Lange's Carmen is now in the field of veterinary medicine - but she doesn't treat the animals, she talks to them, and analyzes them emotionally.  Unlike the former two women, the sense is that Johnston was deeply involved with Carmen, and that the regrets that they are no longer together are his, not hers.  Carmen is an overachiever; she's bitter; she's removed herself from any emotion and she doesn't want to explain herself to Don.  A malevolent force in Carmen's life is Chloe Sevigny, who plays her office assistant, and the guardian of Carmen's forbidding castle.<br /><br />Swinton's cameo is almost gone before the cameras catch it, but in her desolate backwoods world, pink is startling and pouring out of nooks and crannies in the house and landscape.  She's drawn by the site of Don immediately to anger and violence.  The viewer is surprised, given her surroundings and her actions, when Don says..."you left me, Penny".  Johnston is subjected to an attack by her friends, and finds himself broken and sad, finally expressing emotion, visiting the graveside of Michelle, the last of the women he identified for Winston.  It's possible that the son in question may have come from the liaison with either Penny or Michelle.<br /><br />There are a couple of dream sequences strewn in Don's journey, startling in that the viewer really doesn't understand what they mean or why they are filmed.  As the journey proceeds, Don becomes more and more aware of young men in their late teens - the final sequences, which are frustrating for some(in that they provide no answer to the mystery), deal with his encounters with them, and his summary for Winston.<br /><br />Murray plays his detached, nuanced character from "Lost in Translation", with perhaps a less effective script.  Supporting performances are crystal clear and the players are visibly more engaged than is Murray's.  Winston is a delight, and each one of the actresses must have yearned for the richness of the character they finally get to play on the screen in middle-aged cameos.  Symbolism, as noted before, abounds.  Sometimes it gives the viewer food for thought, and sometimes it just gets in the way.<br /><br />At the end of the film (which has a subtle and fitting score), I was absorbed, involved, and vaguely unsure of why.  I was also curious about why Murray's character gets so deeply involved in the quest for the young man; obviously, Jarmusch is conveying self-discovery, but there is no joy at all in the process, at least none on view for this filmgoer.<br /><br />Jarmusch has created a successful film for small theater venues, and art houses, that is being picked up around the country as a feature film, given the success of "Lost in Translation".  That's dangerous, because many will attend looking for Murray's comedy and grow angry at the "waste of film" and lack of action in what is really a superb small film.  Thus, look for a lot of 1 and 2 star reviews for the movie, but if you are a serious follower of films that make you think, see "Broken Flowers".<br /><br />4 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MNMZMM6BGLTA.html">A2MNMZMM6BGLTA</a><br/><p>I thought this was a pretty good movie. It is very understated as is Bill Murrays performance but I still enjoyed it and the subject matter. This is not a real feel good movie. It deals with regrets and past loves lost. It also deals with going back and confronting your past and what you left behind and really if you are not better off leaving the past in the past. Don is a sad character and time has past him by. He is what he is and suddenly he gets a letter that makes him question who he is, how he has lived his life and that he may have a grown child out there that he doesnt even know about.<br /><br />This movie is kind of a downer but is worth a look.</p></br><a href="../users/A3HM5G9IV1FTFP.html">A3HM5G9IV1FTFP</a><br/><p>"Broken Flowers" is just the kind of film I love: It's equal parts funny and sad, intelligently written, beautifully shot, and directed by someone smart enough to get out of the way and let the outstanding actors shine. And shine they do. Once again Bill Murray, as Don Johnston, is understated, and once again it works, allowing the rest of the cast to flesh out their richly idiosyncratic characters. The journey is Don's, but the film really belongs to the actresses who play his former lovers. Don sees himself, and the world, differently through the eyes of each of these four women. The beauty lies in the subtleties: the glimpse of nudity that Laura's (Sharon Stone) daughter un-self-consciously allows Don, the desperate looks Dora (Francis Conroy) shoots to Don over dinner with her obnoxious, soulless husband, the hostility that seethes under the surface of Carmen (Jessica Lange), or Don's strangely unsurprised reaction when he's attacked by Penney's (Tilda Swinton) backwoods companions. Rich, dreamy, and bittersweet, "Broken" never looked so good.</p></br><a href="../users/A36HBE2C5SQ2E6.html">A36HBE2C5SQ2E6</a><br/><p>After being dumped by yet another girlfriend, Don Johnston(Bill Murray)receives a mysterious envelope with news that he has a son and that his son is looking for him. He, along with a friend, plans a trip that will devolve into his past and will examine his relationships with his old flames long after they have ended.<br /><br />Jim Jarmusch is notoriously known to have films that are slowly done. People say that his films move at the pace of a snail. Well, in this movie, his style really finds a niche here. The film is slow and really detailed when it comes to the shots and the pacing. I have had no problem with that. His films, Down By The Law and Dead Man, were impressive. Jarsmuch's writing skills are solid too, although there is not all that much dialogue in the film.<br /><br />Bill Murray's performance was sluggish, brooding, and depressing yet brilliant in a way. He takes a role that is extremely complex and lonely and makes it his own. He literally amazes us and makes us locked to the screen with his performance. He was fantastic.<br /><br />I have been a big fan of Jim Jarmusch after I watched Dead Man late one night in my room, with no light on. I felt for the characters in every films that he has made. His slow style won't suit anyone. In fact, some people probably won't have the patience to watch a Jarmusch film. In my opinion, Jarmusch probably originated the long shots, no dialogue and Gus Van Stant just borrowed off of him. Jarmusch shows that he is a great filmmaker and this film is proof why we need more films from this man.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>I admire Bill Murray's choices as an actor which doesn't mean that I agree with them.  Instead of going for "Meatballs V" or "Ghostbusters III" Murray has sought out adventurous directors and interesting characters which doesn't equate to boffo box office.  With the exception of his work with Wes Anderson, though, most of his films miss the mark.  "Broken Flowers" is quirky without being humorous.  The central premise of a middle-aged lothario seeking out the possible mother of his son yields few laughs or insights.  You first have to buy into the idea of the taciturn Don Johnston(Murray) as some kind of Don Juan and it doesn't fly.  Director Jim Jarmusch seems to be more interested in the quirkiness of Johnston's past flames.  The women in Johnston's life are more caricature than character.  The most normal woman from Johnston's past is the biker chick (Tilda Swinton)and she's only dealt with perfunctorily.  The film's saving grace is a nice supporting turn by Jeffrey Wright as Johnston's buddy who fancies himself an amateur sleuth.</p></br><a href="../users/A2582KMXLK2P06.html">A2582KMXLK2P06</a><br/><p>Bill Murray has been a part of many wonderful films over the years.  Broken Flowers is yet another one.<br /><br />The movie starts off pretty slow, I admit.  It's slow and boring for about 20 minutes.  But then the story picks up about a letter that shows up at his house one day, and it says Bill has a 20-year old son.  He doesn't know who sent the letter.  His neighbor tracks down the addresses of all the women who might be the mother of the child.  It turns out there's four women who it might be.  Bill goes on a journey to find the four women and find out which one has the son.<br /><br />Now, with that out of the way, I thought the movie was hilarious.  It's not supposed to be realistic- the humor lies in the way Bill interacts with the women.  All four of the women turn out to be VERY different from one another, and that's where the plot and the humor kick in.<br /><br />I have nothing more to add except if you like Bill Murray films, give this one a chance.  It's very good.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R36DZQEWNVJ1.html">A3R36DZQEWNVJ1</a><br/><p>Bill Murray (Rushmore, Life Aquatic) stars as Don Johnston (sometimes people say Don Johnson after he's said it), who worked with computers and as of lately his girlfriend Julie Delpy (Before Sunrise, Before Sunset) left him for good. He gets a mysterious pink letter in the mail with no name of return address on it saying that he has a son and he reads it to his friend Winston, played by the always amazing Jeffrey Wright (Shaft, Syriana). Winston then wants to investigate this letter more and he tells Don to write down all the names of the women he dated back then. Winston then finds the names and sends Don on a trip all over the place as Don visits the women from his past. First up is Sharon Stone (Basic Instinct, Total Recall) who has a teenager named Lolita, played by Alexis Dziena (Havoc, Wonderland). Dziena bares all in one scene which might make some people look away. But that doesnt ruin the film. When he gets done with her he goes to the next one, played by Frances Conroy (Six Feet Under) who is married to Christopher McDonald (The Perfect Storm, Quiz Show). Then he goes to animal communicator Carmen, played by Jessica Lange (Rob Roy, Titus) and then he visits a biker chick, played by the wonderful Tilda Swinton (Constantine, The Deep End). Don even gets his ass kicked when he visits her. Lastly he visits the grave of "Little Michelle Pepe" and goes back home where he encounters The Kid, played by Mark Webber (People I Know, Winter Solstice) who might be the son he is looking for. Bascially what you might find in a Jim Jarmusch film and Murray gives a marvelous tour de force performance...he hasnt lost his touch. Also starring Chloe Sevigny (Brown Bunny, Kids), Chris Bauer (8MM, Third Watch), Larry Fessenden (Habit, Session 9) and Pell James (Undiscovered, The King).</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q4XAQXKKV6V.html">A3Q4XAQXKKV6V</a><br/><p>Before you think I'm one of "those people" who expect "Adam Sandler" style humor in order for a movie to be "funny" you should know I LOVED The Royal Tenenbaums. If you think I don't "understand" strange movies and must be force fed plots and subtext please understand I LOVED The Life Aquatic.<br /><br />Broken Flowers on the other hand is simply a shell of the above, coated in an armor of DULL. Each encounter Murray has seems worse than the one before it and by the time the movie rounds the three-quarter mark you will be saying; "Only a miraculous ending can save this mess of boredom." The funniest part is... the ending is quite possibly the worst part of it all. Not because I'm some mass-market-shlub that is not enlightened but because I'm not pompous enough to pretend to want to THINK about this movie any more than necessary after it was over. You can sit and try to pry symbolism out of this movie if you want but since the performances and dialogue were subpar, I suggest moving on with your life.<br /><br />Broken Flowers was indeed as bad as Lost in Translation. It wants to be a movie about awkward circumstances but instead BECOMES an awkward circumstance. The movie was simply poorly cast and lacks any sort of passion, the rest follows suit downhill. I am giving this two stars because the premise is at least good, and Bill was satisfying. I instead reccommend: Punch Drunk Love, The Royal Tenenbaums, the Life Aquatic, About Schimdt, or even Sunshine of the Eternal Mind; these movies are in the same vein, and they actually... bleed.</p></br><a href="../users/ACMAUJEBY6GJF.html">ACMAUJEBY6GJF</a><br/><p>...usually just a look at the guy makes me laugh.

To me.<br /><br />Murrays' previous "hit", that underwater-movie, was also horrible. Too easy, too simple. "Lost in translation" was beautiful. And proved a variety in Murrays' acting skills. Hoping for a more demanding part for him soon, it is easy to put a lot more into a movie that "Broken flowers" that in truth it deserves. Keep that in mind when you watch a movie that no matter what "has got to be good. Why otherwise would Murray be in it?"</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>Bill Murray has nearly become synonymous with introverted, angsty middle-aged men in the past decade. "Broken Flowers" is his latest film on that theme, written and directed by Jim Jarmusch. This time, Don Johnston (Bill Murray), a computer mogul without a computer in his home, receives a mysterious letter just as his live-in girlfriend (Julie Delpy) is leaving him. The letter, composed with a manual typewriter on pink paper, is from a woman claiming to have been Don's lover 20 years before. She announces that Don has a 19-year-old son, who is on a road trip in search of his father. But the letter is unsigned, leaving Don to wonder who might have borne him a son or if it is a hoax. Don's neighbor Winston (Jeffrey Wright) wonders more than he does, and convinces Don to set out across the country to visit the 5 women who could have been the mother of his child.<br /><br />Bill Murray can certainly play aloof angst. It isn't the extent of his talent, but it is unfortunately sometimes the extent of his characterization. Beyond that, "Broken Flowers" isn't about anything. The characters seem tailored to fulfill their particular roles, which are inconsequential, not to impress anyone as genuine. I kept hoping Winston would reappear, because he is the only character who  seems to be among the living, even though he's not credible either: A working class man who lives in a modest home next door to a multi-million dollar house, speaks with a charming accent, works 3 jobs, and is a meticulous and efficient travel agent for no pay. The film spends an inordinate amount of time staring at Don in his living room or in his car. At least 20 minutes worth of  unnecessary shots should have been trimmed. "Broken Flowers" has just one moment of genuine emotion when Don is overcome by exhaustion and self-pity. I thought about giving the film 3 stars, but that one moment is the only thing I could find to recommend it, and that isn't enough.<br /><br />The DVD (MCA 2006): "Girls on the Bus" (1 ? min) is additional conversation between the 2 teenagers in the bus scene. "Broken Flowers Start to Finish" (7 ? min) follows the filming from scene 1 to 63, skipping some scenes, by showing the clapboards for each scene. There are a few bloopers and a lot of clapboards. "Farm House" (4 min) features behind the scenes footage of the farmhouse scene while writer/director Jim Jarmusch speaks about the film's themes and his intentions. There is also a theatrical trailer (2 min). Subtitles for the film are available in English, French, and Spanish.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KL7NXOAGKD3U.html">A3KL7NXOAGKD3U</a><br/><p>I could not stomach another second of this movie...Bill Murray is not what he used to be...yes actors have to grow with time ( it is expected) but what he has done in the last 8 years is nothing more than become this actor who just sits there, thinking that he is going to get laughs just because he is Bill Murray. He shows zero feeling when he is acting, there seems to be nothing there....gather to guess that in his heyday, he may have done too many drugs or something. Ever since Osmosis Jones, his acting has not been something that I seek out. Terrible, not even worth a chuckle or anything in this case.  Yuck!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A1BJJVV2B5VLUQ.html">A1BJJVV2B5VLUQ</a><br/><p>First let me state that I loved Bill Murray back in the days of "Saturday Night Live", "Caddyshack", "Ghostbusters", "What About Bob", "Groundhog Day", "King Pin", Stripes", etc. Since perhaps the late 90's, his movie roles have changed... characters leaning to the softer more subtle side of humanity... often with impeccable timing. I know Murray is no longer the young pup filled with energy. He's an old timer now in Hollywood. With such a treasured past of movie roles on his resume, I can't help but get excited when I see a new movie of his getting ready to hit the movie theaters. I really had to scratch my head with his "Lost In Translation" (2003). Slow, boring and more importantly disappointing were not strong enough words. Now, 3 years later, "Broken Flowers" follows in the same vein. Slow, boring and again disappointing. How long can we sit and watch the main character drive his car, sit on the sofa, read his mail, stair out the window (without dialogue or any background music)? I agree with one Amazon reviewer here that the "pre-teen nudity scene" was unneccesary and "disturbing". Not to mention the abrupt ending... it just fades to black in the middle of a scene. After watching Murray's latest 3 bombs ("Lost In Translation", "The Life Aquatic...", and now "Broken Flowers"), I'm absolutely starting to think the days of Murray's comidic genious are well behind him. For me, "Broken Flowers" is a total downer and a very bland and bitter pill to swallow. Two stars for some interesting cinematography and some of Murray's dialogue with the neighborhood kids... but that's pushing it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1O60Q7LBN4MQ.html">A1O60Q7LBN4MQ</a><br/><p>Bill Murray plays an aging Don Juan who goes looking for an possibly illegitimate son he just found out about about through the mail anonymously.

White trash trying to get to middle class status, a aging yuppie into suburban real estate with her husband, an "animal whisperer" and a tough redneck woman.<br /><br />Bill Murray does his role deadpan all the way through through movie but it seems right.

An old ? bachelor ?, which means (typically American) an unmarried lady's man, is titillated by life : one more girl friend goes away, and a letter arrives from an old anonymous girl-firend announcing the existence and eventually popping up of a 19 year old son of his. He is dumb enough to get on the road to check his old girlfriends to try to find out the one who is playing with his nerves, because the idea of having a son is definitely trying on his nerves. And of course he ends up in a blind alley, or rather a set of five blind alleys all dead. That's Jarmush. These ? bachelors ? of the libertine generation of the 60s, 70s and 80s are just misfits when they reach the ripe age of sixty. They have a luxurious house, they have a good income, but they have nothing affective, nothing sentimental. They are a wasteland left on furrow for fifty years and there is like a crazy dream that maybe they would enjoy a son or a daughter, or whatever that could look stable till the final departure. Jarmush is a sentimental undertaker who buries even the slightest and smallest illusion we may have about a possible redemption in this world. We were abandoned a long time ago by all gods that we imagined existed and we find ourselves, soulless, selfless, godless, and so on, in other words in total ? suffering ?

The films are philosophically dense where there are no single true answers to Jarmusch's questions, yet each viewer will have to strive to find their own interpretation.  All of his adventures contain a deeper meaning such as the transcending Mystery Train (1989) where people pass through Memphis to the spiritual Western, Dead Man (1995) with Johnny Depp, while Jarmusch also touches on eastern philosophy in Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai (1999).  Broken Flowers continues on the path that Jarmusch has laid out for himself without deviating from his thoughtful guidance to cerebral enlightenment.<br /><br />There are several reasons why Jarmusch's films are fascinating.  One of the reasons is his visual sense of capturing the essence of time and place, which he efficiently makes use of in the opening of Broken Flowers.  The first scene allows the audience to see a hand mailing a pink personal letter, which is then followed through the technology of the postal services until it arrives in the mailbox of Don Johnston (Bill Murray).  There are numerous scenes where Jarmusch allows a motionless camera to capture Don's current existence, which brings out the melancholic state that he is experiencing.  The first impression might be boredom, for the audience, but if the audience submerges themselves into the story with thoughtfulness they will discover a gem among cinema that deals with existentialism.<br /><br />Another reason why Jarmusch makes his films interesting is the characters that he has in his film.  In this film, Don is a has-been Don Juan with countless number of ex-girlfriends who has lived a life in the moment and never seized the opportunity to plan for the future.  This seems to bother him, as he often remains immobile, which suggests that he is in a contemplative state.  Yet, he never reaches any conclusions, as nothing ever seem to change around him.  For something to happen, an external event must take place that forces him to do something, and in this case it is the pink letter.  The story surrounds the pink letter, which he opens in the company with his Ethiopian neighbor and friend Winston (Jeffrey Wright).  Through the letter Don finds out that he has a son with a woman he met some 20 years ago, but she kept it a secret until now.  However, the letter does not disclose anything in regards to who sent it, or where it comes from.  Thus, Winston coerces Don to solve the mystery and find the mother, which is easier said than done.<br /><br />Winston's forcefulness ushers Don to begin something he would never have done by himself, as Winston asks him to write a list of the women that he thinks could be the possible mothers.  With the help of Internet and Mapquest.com Winston finds the women and he produce an extensive traveling plan for Don to see all the women.  Don sets off to find the women while listening to Winston's home burnt CD with Ethiopian modern music, which helps generate the mystifying atmosphere that often lingers in Jarmusch's films.  It becomes a journey into Don's past, as he seems to find the things that drew him to these women.  Furthermore, the audience will discover the similarities among the women, which in itself offers additional amusement.<br /><br />Broken Flowers plays with visual symbolism in regards to how the environment and people change with time while it is experienced in the present, as Don ponders the future and visits the past.  Bill Murray's performance might feel familiar with Royal Tenenbaums (2001) and Lost in Translation (2003), however, he deals with different issues in this film and succeeds in pulling off a unique performance.  In addition, there are several strong performances by several actors including Jeffrey Wright, Sharon Stone, Jessica Lange, Tilda Swinton and many others who enhance the silent and melancholic character that Bill Murray presents.  Under Jarmusch's direction the actors deliver dry comedy with moments of laughter, but also a more meaningful existence where he leaves the audience to think about the philosophical possibilities of the past, present, and future.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>I heard all of the accolades that Bill Murray received for "Lost in Translation" before I say the movie and while I enjoyed his performance I thought there were still parts where he was still acting like Bill Murray and that it was not the best thing he had ever done (that would still be "Groundhog Day").  But if you were wondering how far Murray can go in divorcing himself of his well-known mannerisms and such, then "Broken Flowers" would say the answer is pretty far.<br /><br />Murray plays Don Johnston (pay attention, people, there is a "t" there), who apparently made enough money from computers to feel comfortable sitting on his couch and watching his latest girlfriend, Sherry (Julie Delpy) walk out the door.  For all we know her exit could write "fini" to his life, but then he gets an unsigned letter that says twenty years ago he fathered a son who might, at this very moment, be searching for him.  So the letter constitutes fair warning, but makes no impact on Don.  However, his neighbor Winston (Jeffrey Wright) is intrigued by the mystery, compels Don to make a list of all the women who could be the mothers of such a child, and then arranges a trip for him to check out the possibilities.  All Don has to do is go on the journey.  Giving the women pink flowers to gauge their reactions and seeing if they have a typewriter (the letter was typed on pink stationery) are Winston's helpful hints as he sends Don forth into the void.  He also promises to keep an eye out for any 19-year-old boy who shows up looking for his father.<br /><br />So it is that Don takes off to look for the woman who may be the mother of his child.  The candidates are Laura (Sharon Stone), Dora (Frances Conroy), Carmen (Jessica Lange), and Penny (Tilda Swinton).  Don must have been some sort of Don Juan (or even Don Johnson) two decades earlier because otherwise it would be pretty hard to connect the dots given that quartet of women.  As Don goes from one station of his journey to the next it is hard to tell if it is making an impression on him because Murray's performance is going for a minimalism that is quite impressive because it forces you to focus on what little he gives us to try and glean what is going on in his mind.<br /><br />Writer-director Jim Jarmusch ("Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai") makes it clear that the journey is more important than the destination.  After all the best case scenario here is that only one of the women on his itinerary can be the writer of the letter.  You may well watch "Broken Flowers" from start to finish wondering what it is all about, because Jarmusch's approach is to show instead of tell.  Some will find that maddening and others compelling, and your tolerance of this film could well be how much you like Bill Murray.  Fortunately, most people like him a lot, and that could well be the foundation for allowing his performance to be your conduit to this film, because without him it does not stand a chance.</p></br><a href="../users/A3OEECMCM2T4KQ.html">A3OEECMCM2T4KQ</a><br/><p>This particular collaboration between auteur director Jim Jarmusch and Bill Murray seems to be a perfect mix of acting sensibilities and a director's artistic vision. Jarmusch is not known for main stream films though his contributions to the film community, really has brought something different and rare to the industry.<br /><br />A good example is Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai, staring this years Oscar nominee, Forest Whitaker, (The Last King of Scotland) plays a somewhat reluctant assassin with an obsession with carrier pigeons. A very strange film but an interesting one, feeling compelled to unlock the film's message when, in fact, there might not be a message.<br /><br />This is Jarmusch's style, emotion and visuals must carry the film, words, on the other hand are incidental.<br /><br />The same could be said about Broken Flowers. Bill Murray's expressive eyes and revealing body language says more than his limited dialogue.<br /><br />The plot is a simple one: rich, retired and lifeless man loses girlfriend and receives a (pink) letter telling the man that he has a 19 year old son. Feeling self pity over his present break-up with his girl friend, he becomes more lifeless, despite the fact that someone has reached out and stated he has a son. The emotional state of Apathy is a strange disease. Nothing in life matters and the strength to even move from the couch to the bedroom requires a tremendous amount of effort. (This is done extremely well in the opening scenes).<br /><br />Enter his next door neighbour, Winston, (Jeffery Wright) an enthusiastic man in love with life, not only a father of six, working several jobs, but working on his first crime novel. Johnson's (Murray) only real friend, he coaxes Don to investigate the matter, thus he hits the road, visiting his old girlfriends, in search of his son. This is a great premise for any story whether short story, novel or film.<br /><br />"Revisiting" films, plays and novels, is a well used premise for any protagonist to examine their life and make an honest assessment of their past and an opportunity to set their life `right' again. The list is enormous, Our Town, A Christmas Carol, It's a Wonderful Life, etc. this territory has been well trodden.<br /><br />Broken Flowers, however, does not follow the realist form of story telling, that is to say, a resolution and awakening from the main character. The Murray character, in most respects, is just as lonely and apathetic at the end of the story, but he at least, reaches for a possibility, (seeing a homeless boy) which was a far cry from his behaviour at the start. This character does transform, though not in a dramatic way, but somehow changes into a lesser form of apathy. The story ends and we wonder what will become of him...and the boy he meets...Will this man continue on this path or return to his lifeless existence...Jarmusch, like most great story tellers, leaves it up to us to decide, finishing the tale, leaving the audience to form their own conclusions.<br /><br />Broken Flowers is one of Jarmusch's more accessible films though never created for the main stream perspective.<br /><br />Broken Flowers is not a great film but a very good one.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ARRAMXWT83PT.html">A2ARRAMXWT83PT</a><br/><p>Bill Murray gives another stunning performance in this film, as does the rest of the wonderful cast. Jim Jarmusch is such a talented director. His originality never ceases to amaze me, and this film is wonderful! Everything about it is great! It's the "Lost in Translation" of 2005, and you don't want to miss it! Some people may be put off by the ending. It's not a conventional ending. This film doesn't adhere to a typical Hollywood formula, so no, nothing is spoon-fed to the audience. We need more films like these!<br /><br />RENT IT.

'Broken flowers' is one of those films. You get the initial impression that the charecters you witness on screen, are genuine, realistic and so are the situations. Bill Murray plays the charecter called Don and you are forced to think from Don's point of view, from his eyes. Bill Murray is almost perfect in his role and makes you think what would it be like to be in Don's shoes. Its the story about Don, his present and then certain things that introduce us to some of his old aqcuaintances, takes him and us to a journey to his past. Its truely a beautiful piece of cinema, very genuine and Bill Murray steals the show easily. Watch out for Tilda Swinton, her role is brief but her performence is just beyond words. A silent drama not to be missed at all. I am happy to own the dvd.</p></br><a href="../users/A3SFO2GSP5CVSM.html">A3SFO2GSP5CVSM</a><br/><p>Bill Murray is the closest thing to a modern Charlie Chaplin, not in being a filmmaker, but in creating an onscreen persona. His `dour schlemiel' is every bit as iconic as Chaplin's tramp. He has played the same basic character in films from Groundhog Day to Lost In Translation to his latest incarnation in Jim Jarmusch's latest film Broken Flowers. This film is one of those works of art that should be filed under `nice attempt', but is ultimately a failure. And it fails for the simplest of reasons that all bad films fail: a bad screenplay, which was written by Jarmusch himself.<br />  Murray plays a former Lothario named Don Johnston, who made a fortune in personal computers, watches The Adventures Of Don Juan on tv (for all call him a Don Juan), and whose girlfriend Sherry (Julie Delpy) is leaving him. His Ethiopian friend and neighbor Winston (Jeffrey Wright), is a mystery writer and amateur detective. On the day Sherry leaves Don gets an unsigned letter in a pink envelope, typed in red ink, from a former girlfriend saying that twenty years ago he fathered her son, and he may be searching for him. Don is is pushed by Winston to search for the writer of the letter. The first of his ex-girlfriends he visits is Laura (Sharon Stone). She's a NASCAR widow, whose daughter Lolita (Alexis Dziena), is a gorgeous nymphet who nakedly tries to seduce Don (wow, what a shock!). She does not succeed, but Laura does (ah, film!- only in such a medium could a guy like Murray, and a cipher of a character like Don, have a prayer of bedding Sharon Stone- or her onscreen lookalike). Don, in Murrayvian fashion, never tells her his real reason for the trip, then later fantasizes about....of course, Lolita- yes, it's really that heavyhanded in its attempts at symbolism.<br />  His second ex-lover is Dora (Frances Conroy), who, with her husband Ron (Christopher McDonald), are realtors of pre-fab homes. Again Murray equivocates and does not reveal the reason for his trip to see her. The nest woman on his list is New Age pet psychic Carmen (Jessica Lange), whose lesbian assistant (Chloe Sevigny) resents Don's intrusion. Carmen's so fruity that Don does not even attempt to really tell her why he stopped by. His fourth ex-lover is Penny (Tilda Swinton), a biker chick whose boyfriend punches Don out when she goes psycho just a minute after meeting him. A fifth lover is now dead, and he returns to his posh home, and Winston, unsatisfied....Others have detailed the rest of the film.... Jarmusch is still a daring director, but he seems to be in mid-life crisis mode, not knowing what he will do next, or what he should do.</p></br><a href="../users/AFFVUZEGP1FDQ.html">AFFVUZEGP1FDQ</a><br/><p>Although the movie itself is interesting, well performed, engaging and mostly excellent, it just fails at the end. I was left wanting for a real ending</p></br><a href="../users/A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ.html">A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ</a><br/><p>For some reason I keep watching Jim Jarmusch films and listening to hype around him. Critics seem to love everything he does. I guess he must be a tremendous filmmaker. I really don't see it. Everything in his films is played down to the point of just being boring. Although this film has some great acting, it's no exception.<br /><br />Although the film is interesting, and the acting is great, the plot is a bit diluted and seems forced at times. Basically, Don Johnston (Murray) receives an unsigned letter from an ex-girlfriend telling him that the son he never knew he had is coming to find him. He receives this letter as his current girlfriend is leaving him.<br /><br />This leads his best friend Winston into wanting to play detective and sends Johnston to visit each of his old girlfriends to look for clues as to who could have sent the letter.<br /><br />Each woman's character is remarkable and they provide the high points of the movie. And although Bill Murray is even more sedate than he was in Lost In Translation, it works. The whole thing is very realistic. Sometimes to the point of being realistically boring.<br /><br />Some things in the film are cliche and some are surprising. For example, having a teenage daughter named Lolita is cliche. Having her parade naked through the living room with a stranger in the house is surprising. Surprises like that help keep the movie from being utterly tiresome, but Broken Flowers still manages to stay pretty uneventful throughout.<br /><br />On the DVD there's a special feature where Jim Jarmusch talks about his creative process and how creatively creative he can be. Basically, you get to hear him loving to hear himself talk while weird shots of a barn are shown in the background.</p></br><a href="../users/A34D4KCP94ACJZ.html">A34D4KCP94ACJZ</a><br/><p>Broken Flowers is about a lonely retired former womanizer played by Bill Murray.  His name is Don Johnston, a "Don Juan" if you will, who receives a random letter in the mail from an unnamed former girlfriend.  The letter indicates that Don has a son who has just begun a trip to search for his father.  Don seems somewhat indifferent to the news but given the theme of the film it's likely that he is more tired of life and perhaps a bit self-absorbed than actual indifference, as this news is something that will eventually serve to re-awaken Don and perhaps it gives him just the self-interest he needs to live life with renewed vigor.  In that sense, the story of Don is an existential tale more so than one with a conventional end.  The film offers us means to complete a nice story of a father's union with his son that he's never met.  But director Jim Jarmusch is not conventional and he is too smart to throw such a trivial narrative our way.<br /><br />At the suggestion and great enthusiasm of his friend and neighbor Winston, Don is convinced that the search for this former girlfriend and the mother of his son is a worthy undertaking.  So he goes off to find five of his former girlfriends at the time his son would've been born (about 20 years ago).  One, Michelle, has passed away and he visits her grave and seems to express more reverence for her than the others...he even tells Winston he loved Michelle and she is the only one he says that about.  Another is Laura played by Sharon Stone.  Don gets to sleep with Laura again and he doesn't seem as surprised as I was when Laura's flirty teen daughter Lolita walks about the house in nothing but her epidermis.  Her overt sexuality probably mirrors that of her mother's and Don seems unfazed by it...great dead pan acting once again by Bill Murray. Dora is another former girlfriend and she is played by Frances Conroy.  Dora seems to contain an underlying regret in her decision to choose a lifestyle completely different than the one she practiced when Don met her.  Jessica Lange plays another former girlfriend who works as an animal communicator.  All three of these women seem to initially react quite positively to Don and are pleasantly surprised to see him, but they are still interesting and unique in their own ways. Finally, Penny is played by Tilda Swinton and seems to be the only former girlfriend that is really disgusted with seeing Don.  I won't reveal how Don's journey ends but I will say that he is given an opportunity to reflect on his life during his travels, and that is something he badly needed.<br /><br />Perhaps Broken Flowers doesn't ask that we read into the clues as to who sent the letter and if Don will find his son.  If you look carefully in the credits and perhaps watch the movie again you will find some decent resolution to those questions but that isn't necessarily what Jarmusch is telling us about Don.  Broken Flowers is not about a father meeting his son as much as it is about a man becoming a father.<br /><br />To note further on the film's content, I must say that I always enjoy the atmosphere of a Jarmusch film, as much as they may require a bit of patience.  Some will find it to be a slow movie but it is both fascinating and funny.  In my humble opinion, it also happened to have the best soundtrack of 2005.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LU79BYMWZEW9.html">A3LU79BYMWZEW9</a><br/><p>I once toyed with the idea of writing a column about how we REALLY see movies--that is to say, how the average viewer (who may or may not have something of a critical sensibility) sees movies.  Even those of us who love film passionatesly, but who are not professional critics, experience film in quite a different way from those critics, no matter how "of the people" they strive to be in their writing.  Simply put, if you see maybe a couple of films a week, and maybe the majority of those months or years after their release, your experience of those films HAS to differ from those in the pro-crit establishment, who as a professional necessity, live and breathe the cinema.<br /><br />I was thinking about this very fact when I caught Jim Jarmusch's most recent film BROKEN FLOWERS.  I haven't seen nearly as much of his work as I might have liked--not nearly as much as thought I would have by now.  You know how it is, you have a running list of films you intend to see, books you want to read, music you hope to get around to listening to.  Then one day you realize that, hey, there are only so many hours in a day.  And most of those are spoken for by everyday life concerns.  So maybe you better pick and choose your entertainments carefully.<br /><br />It's not too late, of course, but I wish I had chosen to get better acquainted with Jim Jarmusch's work well before now.  The understated humor, thoughtful and episodic approach, and his brutally honest cinematography (which captures the American landscape as it really is) were all elements that I felt I instantly understood and related too.  It's presumptuous at best to say that an artist's sensibility matches your own.  But you can't help but get excited when you begin to feel that kind of spiritual kinship.  In cinema, it happens all too rarely these days.<br /><br />This is what some might call a "quiet film."  Casting Bill Murray as a laconic, vaguely depressive aging Don Juan (punnily named Don Johnston--jokey on a couple of levels, both pretty good) may seem almost too easy.  The aging, alienated hipster is a role that Murray could pretty much phone in.  But no one does it better--and I for one, prefer his jaded performance here to that of say LOST IN TRANSLATION.  He just seems more, well, "at home" wandering the contemporary American landscape than he did in the confines of a Tokyo superhotel and studio.<br /><br />The inconclusive plot will frustrate some, but as some have noted a more conventional "Hollywood" ending would have been less than honest.  The story of a man's initially half-hearted search for a son of whose existence he never knew (and is actually still not sure of) seems like a dismal and futile quest from the outset.  But we go along willingly, in part for the absurd comedy of it all.  In part, because we all have loose ends that were never quite tied up in any satisfactory way.  You can't go back again?  Well, you can try, but you're really going someplace else.<br /><br />As BROKEN FLOWERS suggests, the Information Highway has made tracking down the people in your past much easier than at any time in history.<br /><br />Actually reconnecting with those individuals is quite another matter.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL.html">A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL</a><br/><p>Life is mysterious.  Sometimes bombshells shake us up.  Life seems to be a run toward fulfillment with expectations that frustrate our deepest desires.  Such is the quandry for Don Johnston (Bill Murray) who is a solitary middle-aged bachelor.  His live in lover, Sherry (Julie Delpy) leaves him at the beginning.  He seems slightly startled out of his orbit, but her complaints provide the crux of his situation.  "You're never going to change," she complains.  "I don't want to be with an over-the-hill Don Juan...," and "I'm just like your mistress, except you're not even married."  Romance is certainly not elusive for Don "the Juan" Johnston, but he seems attached to the experience and not any lover.  He dreamily lives his life through dinner with wine, DVD's, and classical music, sitting almost stupor-like, oblivious to all but the nuances of his surroundings.<br /><br />It is, however, at this transition that he receives a mysterious pink letter.  In it he is told by a former lover that he fathered their boy who is now about twenty years older and set on a sojourn to find and meet him.  She relates some of his personality traits, but otherwise leaves his son mysterious.  The handwriting is unrecognizable, and the letter is unsigned.  Meanwhile, he makes his best emotional connection with his next door neighbor friend, Winston (Jeffrey Wright), an Ethiopian emigre' who works hard, is an amiable presence, and works three jobs while grooming to be a freelance mystery writer.  His family, including his precocious and cute daughter, Rita (Brea Frazirer) provides a vicarious outlet for Don to the family life.  Don is clueless to any emotional connection to his newly identified son, but Winston, naturally, is fascinated.  After a series of meetings between the two friends, Winston has gathered a whole plan to find the mother and lover who bore Don's son.  Winston's detective sensibilities provide the addresses, workplaces, and MapQuest directions (even a burned soundtrack C.D. for his romantic quest).  At first Don resists, then he is convinced:  It is fascinating and worthwhile to connect with the past.  "Bring pink flowers...look for red typewriter ribbon and pink stationery...just say you're checking in..." are the key words Winston advises to make the trek work.<br /><br />The movie makes emotional connections by rejuvenating Don's spirit at times.  It provides all of the awkwardness one would expect to find in an adult comedy.  Fragments of his former love lives come to roost.  Sometimes it is refreshing (as with Laura [Sharon Stone]), and sometimes it is downright awkward (as with Dora [Frances Conroy] when he finds her married to a man who remembers him as a past love interest, while expounding on trite pleasantries during dinner about how their marriage is so wonderful.)  It is here that Murray shows his comic prowess.  Much of the humor is written on his face (not unlike Bob Newhart, only here he is more subtle with less agitation).  Besides that all of the encounters have that school reunion uneasiness where everyone stares at one another until the other party recognizes the addressed guest.  The four encounters with the would-be mothers provide anything from the sublime to the tragic.<br /><br />We leave 'Broken Flowers' with tender longing.  The film is not entirely unlike Bill Murray's other acting achievement 'Lost in Translation'.  There is loneliness presented in distant worlds with whimsey and aching trying to break through the pattern of longing and unrealized fulfillment.  Don Johnston may or may not fulfil his inquiry into life's rich enigma's, but Jim Jamusch's directing perfects with bullseye precision this fascinating, easy chair trek.  And, just like 'Lost in Translation,' we too, have been transported by the same sojourn as the protagonist.  Some of the movie is deliberately slow moving with a reflectiveness that deserves the treatment of its subject matter.  The aftermath of 'Broken Flowers' leaves us to reflect on our own thoughts about our own world in all of its possibilities...</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>I loved most of his early movies. I watched Lost In Translation, which made me cry, but lately, he's gone for what can only be described as oddball movies, when he could have probably got any script he wanted. Why? Cos he didn't want to be stereotyped. He's always the funny guy. In recent movies, he's become the older man, the loner, the guy who's really not so funny as much, but can relay so much in just an expression. That's why I loved Lost In Translation so much, I saw a much different side to Bill than I'd ever seen before.<br /><br />There was something not quite right about Broken Flowers though. It just didn't seem to gel. The director seemed to like long, lingering shots of nothing to do the film, random shots, and then lots of shots of Bill just sitting on the couch, in that godawful tracksuit. The characters were very strange, but they worked. The whole story is about a bachelor going from woman to woman, never quite settling down. He discovers he has a son he never knew about, from an old flame 20 years ago, and is persuaded to go out and find this son. He visits old girlfriends from 20 years ago, finding them married, childless, still very much in love with him, or angry. (And isn't Tilda Swinton in this film unrecognisable?) Does he ever find out who or where is son is? No. The film has a very unsatisfactory ending, but after a few days of thinking about the film, I've decided I'm still not overly thrilled about the ending, but it worked. It was left open, for viewers to make their own decisions, as there is quite a few clues left throughout the film. I still can't make up my mind who I think the mother is.<br /><br />Some of the characters are quite funny, especially the scenes with Sharon Stone and her character's daughter, Lolita (played by Alexis Dziena, a star to watch out for.) Lolita totally not getting the reference to her name, and then appearing totally naked (and full frontal - brave girl). It's a weird relationship between her & her mum, and then they involve Bill's character, I just didn't know what to expect next! I'm still not sure whether the nude scene was completely necessary or not. And does she come on to him or not?<br /><br />The ending is pretty much about searching, and connecting with people. Also discovering more about yourself. Expect to be puzzled completely by this film, but as I already mentioned, I put off writing this review for a couple of days, as I wanted to think about it some more. Expect to be crying when you see some genuine emotion in the character when he visits one particular ex girlfriend's grave. I sobbed. Oh, and by the way, don't bother with the extras, they're rubbish!</p></br><a href="../users/A38YUU4J5Q4EJO.html">A38YUU4J5Q4EJO</a><br/><p>Seriously, This film COULD have been good because the characters were all interesting enough,some a little weirder than others,but then....I thought the player had messed up because it ended in the middle.Then I realize that WAS the end !<br /><br />I actually did get very caught up in the story.<br /><br />He gets a letter , unsigned ,that says he has a Son , and his detective wannabe buddy takes a list of names of ex lovers , maps him out a route , motel rooms etc. (He has to travel what I assumed is long distances between ex-lovers) and he is off on a quest to find the Son , who we find out in the beginning (from the pink letter) is also looking for Dad.<br /><br />I still can't figure out why all the guessing on his part.( Why not just straight out ASK these women if he fathered a child by them,Instead it is a big guessing game.) And<br /><br />the way we were left just HANGING ,The director must have wanted us to come to our own conclusions , ( either THAT or he was doing MAJOR drugs :)<br /><br />We are left with all the pink clues,and I would've thought it was the trailer trashy girl ( because of the pink typewriter)  but her reaction at seeing him would have been WAY off base after HER getting ahold of HIM. So in my mind that eliminated HER.<br /><br />But yet, the kid that shows up at the end I DID feel was supposed to be his Son...then another kid drives by in a car to confuse us FURTHER<br /><br />I have seen movies end abruptly , but this takes the cake.<br /><br />My guess is that the trailer trash girl who had him beat up WAS supposed to be the Mother of his child after all, and the kid who he bought the sandwich for wasn't the Son (because his reaction was genuine shock and he ran away ), and I feel that the kid that drove by in the car probably was just a "symbol" that Bill Murray would just never know for sure  but my guess is as good as anybodys.<br /><br />Any comments on anyone else's conclusions would be appreciated. I know a lot of the more modern movies now don't have the "traditional ending" and we are left to explore the possibilities on our own , but dammit! I want an ANSWER.<br /><br />Although the letdown really sucks , I still give it 3 stars for the acting.Anyone else interested in sharing thier thoughts on a conclusion here? Thanks!</p></br><a href="../users/A5TZXWU8AALIC.html">A5TZXWU8AALIC</a><br/><p>I didn't really care for LOST IN TRANSLATION--I thought it was bland and pretentious--but I was thrilled that Bill Murray got an Academy Award nomination out of it.<br /><br />I'd seen him in 1984's THE RAZOR'S EDGE many times (check that movie out!) and knew he was capable of more than Hollywood was getting out of him.  His supporting role in 1982's TOOTSIE, still one of the greatest comedies of all time, was an early clue.  (His convictions in 1980's disastrous WHERE THE BUFFALO ROAM were right, but everything else in that film was a wreck).  Even 1988's SCROOGED showed a great range.<br /><br />So I went to BROKEN FLOWERS with a lot of hope.  Murray's great in it, if a little understated.  The whole movie has that slow, steady feel to it.  I just wish the film would've included a little of Murray's sense of humor.  It would've explained how he got all these women in the first place (which is never addressed, honestly) and it would've been another aspect of his "loss" as a person.  We're left to decipher his somber expressions to see what's going on inside.<br /><br />The film has moments that teeter just at the edge of inspired lunacy--not slapstick or crude laughs--but surreal and emotional moments of hilarity.  The appearance of "Lolita" perked up the audience I saw it with and generated some real laughs.<br /><br />The rest of the cast is great.  If you run out for popcorn (or blink), you'll miss Tilda Swinton (the Ice Queen from THE CHRONICLE OF NARNIA).  It was fun to see "Nurse Charles" and "Jeff Slater" from TOOTSIE do a scene together, as unnerving as Jessica Lange was in that scene.<br /><br />Look carefully in the end credits for "Homer Murray" for another clue about the son.  It's actually Bill's real-life son.<br /><br />Although I'm not sure what it means to the movie....</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>Jim Jarmusch continues his exploration of the human plight with BROKEN FLOWERS, a story he both wrote and directed, and this time he examines the psyche and the consequences of the Don Juan complex.  In doing so he offers a quiet meditation about choices and their reverberations and leaves  many thoughts open-ended, a definite tribute to the intelligence of his viewers and followers.<br /><br />Don Johnston (Bill Murray) is a middle aged bachelor who has devoted his life to being a success in computer work, all the while being a lothario with countless women used as  sexual partners over his lifetime. His most recent paramour Sherry (Julie Delphy) has just left him: 'You make me feel like a mistress and you're not even married!'.  He now lives alone in Anywhere, USA, his only friends being his next-door neighbor, novelist Winston (Jeffrey Wright) and his wife Mona (Heather Simms) and five children. Don receives a pink envelope in the mail, no signature, no return address, informing him he has a 19-year-old son  who may be out looking for him.  Don's affect is flat: he has no idea of his parenthood or the identity of the mother.<br /><br />Winston is curious, takes the letter in hand and begins detective work to find out whom the mother might be.  In a matter of days he has located four prospects from a list Don reluctantly and fuzzily makes of girlfriends from 20 years ago, makes all the travel arrangements, gives detective type advice, and  sets Don (Juan) Johnston off on his journey with instructions to greet each of the four with a bouquet of pink flowers.  The four women are a disparate group: Laura (Sharon Stone) and her au natural daughter Lolita (Alexis Dziena) where he pauses for a physical dalliance; Dora (Frances Conroy); animal communicator Dr. Carmen Markowski (Jessica Lange) with her sexy office assistant (Chlo? Sevigny); and Penney (Tilda Swinton) whose fellow bikers beat him.  Don returns home, without having a clue as to who sent the letter or has the son.<br /><br />Back at home he receives a second pink letter which he turns over to Winston: case unsolved.  He remains a lonely man, befriends a young lad (Mark Webber) at the thought he may be the son, but that too leaves stories unresolved.  Was the lad his son,  had he met the mother, or is this all a concoction for a novel by his best friend Winston?<br /><br />Jarmusch leaves the ending to the audience.  He has created enough characters with whom we can identify and understand and then just leaves it there.  The cast is excellent, with Bill Murray's Don being the finest interpretation of his career. Each of the cameos is brief but fully realized and allows each of the actors a divergent role from their usual casting.  Though promoted as a comedy this story is more of a meditation on lust, desire, loneliness, and failure to connect.  It is a fine little film.  Recommended.

I'm a fan of him and of those movies, but they tended to frustrate as many people as they delighted, and seeing Murray stare down another midlife crisis almost feels like watching Billy Bob Thornton play another surly drunk or Angelina Jolie play another femme fatale.<br /><br />He gets away with it again, though, and "Flowers" is, again, one of those movies that will please some greatly and absolutely confound others.<br /><br />That split is largely the result of writer-director Jim Jarmusch, who specializes in movies that would march to the beat of a different drummer if they actually chose to march at all. His films ("Stranger Than Paradise," "Coffee and Cigarettes") are comedies that tend to elicit lots of wry smiles instead of huge belly laughs. Low on plot, they move at their own steady pace.<br /><br />"Flowers" is no exception and it certainly takes its time; it's also a wise, funny and eventually very moving little film, with a script that carefully lets viewers answer some of the story's questions on their own. There's also a lot of fine acting, especially from Wright, who's extremely funny, and Lange, who's quite frightening; but this is mostly Murray's show and even if it feels a little like material he's covered before.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D3XQC2DIT.html">A1D3XQC2DIT</a><br/><p>Director Jim Jarmusch, best known to me for his work in making Ghost Dog - The Way of the Samurai, first worked together with Bill Murray in Coffee and Cigarettes before getting back together two years later to make Broken Flowers.<br /><br />Broken Flowers features Bill Murray acting in a role similarly caught up in the mundane passing of time as was his character in Lost in Translation. Murray plays Don Johnston...with a T...a "middle aged Don Juan" with a whose past relationships with women are to be admired. As he says, he was just living his life when one day he receives a mysterious letter which had neither a return address nor a signed name. The letter read that it was from a woman from 20 years into Don's past and that shortly after they went their separate ways she gave birth to a son. Don's son.<br /><br />Winston, Don's sleuth-obsessed neighbor gets involved to discover the origin of the letter. His blueprint involves Don creating a list of possible women from which he will plan an itinerary. The choice, then, is Don's; whether or not to set out on this wild goose chase to find a woman who may or may not have given birth to his child.<br /><br />The movie was good. It was not great, it was not incredible, it was not wonderful. It was good. I think it COULD HAVE BEEN great, incredible and/or wonderful. Something was missing.<br /><br />Winston was the loveable character. It was his role that should have been developed further. He and his family with their relationship to Don could have been used more. Maybe a few less cut scenes to watch a plane take off.<br /><br />I understand that the idea was to let Don embark on an outwardly manifested journey into himself, but so many solo shots of Murray sitting quietly as he learned more about himself made the movie progress too slowly.<br /><br />I know I broke the cardinal rule of movie watching and entered the theater last night with expectation(s) for this film. Granted I had not heard much of the movie itself, only that Murray was great. I will concede this point, but with exceptions. To an extent I will draw a parallel between Bill Murray in Broken Flowers and Tom Hanks in The Terminal. Both men were great in their respective roles, the problem was that maybe the roles themselves needed work. The Terminal was a horrible film, so I will go no further in using the two movies in the same sentence. I said before, Broken Flowers is a good movie.<br /><br />I laughed (maybe too) loudly at many points. That is part of what made the movie difficult for me as I would laugh so hard and then there would be such a long lull before the next laugh. This emphasized some parts of the movie as being slower than I believe they really were upon reflection; the contrast was too great.<br /><br />There were two things that I definitely enjoyed about Jarmusch's direction. One, though it made me a bit nauseous, was his camera shot out Don's driver side window. The shot is right out the window, including the reflection in the side mirror. This shows Don on his journey through his past to maybe find a piece of his future. We watch the world pass by his window then vanish into the horizon. The second technique was the use of basketball hoops. Winston instructed Don to keep an eye out for clues that may indicate which of the women mothered a son. Each neighborhood he travels to shows a basketball hoop. The hoops are used as hope that maybe he is on the right path.<br /><br />I was also fascinated by the newfound desire in a man who had never exhibited any signs of wanting a family of his own to find his son in the face of every 19 year old young man he passed on the street. ...So I guess that was three things I liked....<br /><br />Either go in committed to "the long haul" or maybe get antsy in your uncomfortable theater seat, either way the movie is good. Maybe Jim Jarmusch will just let me see his next script ahead of time so we can work in a few more jokes to keep up the intensity. Until then, go see Broken Flowers. (Oh and I recommend Ghost Dog, too.)</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJIJKKN15KR9.html">A1TJIJKKN15KR9</a><br/><p>Bill Murray puts on the sad clown face in one of his drearier roles. It's a black comedy at heart, with an eye cast to the implications of paternity and an increasingly weird series of long-extinguished romances, but there's no joy in Murray's role as the dry, lonely playboy on a mission. The ever-changing cast, whose major players never last long enough to settle down and get comfortable, makes it an act with several faces but no identity. Worth a few awkward snickers at its most daring, on the large it's terribly bleak and morose, and ultimately runs kicking and screaming from the answers to its one major question.</p></br><a href="../users/A39IY0JU5JI69G.html">A39IY0JU5JI69G</a><br/><p>Good idea---aging Don Juan, now named Don Johnston, who is watching a film about the real Don Juan sits, in his sleazy running suit, eyes fixed on the tube, while his very pretty girlfriend walks out.  He manages to rouse himself from the couch long enough to utter a few weak words of protest but Sherry hits the road.  Good for her!<br /><br />I liked Bill Murray in Lost in Translation---the script was clever enough to support his aged, cynical, middle-aged man character.  Here that character is exploited and magnified, and we are treated to many, many. long minutes of this dreadful, basset-hound-like countenance, behind the wheel, on a plane, in an airport, on a couch.  He shows no emotion, only an occasional flash of testosterone as he views a thigh here and there.  That's what passes for love, in the heart of this soul-less man, and no wonder all the ladies left him.<br /><br />In order to sustain a viewer through two hours of film, the central character should be someone we care about.  I didn't see anything in this man, other than a knee-jerk response to his wonderful neighbor's family, to even remind me that he was alive.<br />I guess his humor was supposed to be drole and dead-pan, but it was very light on the drole and way too heavy on the dead-pan.<br /><br />On the plus side, we got to see some wonderful, aging women actors perform---Sharon Stone was gorgeous as the desperate, lusty trailer park ex; Jessica Lange was terrifically scary-intense as the "animal interpreter" and Tilda Swinton was good, too, as the biker-chick.  Jeffrey Wright, as the Ethiopian neighbor, Winston, brings some much needed humanity into the picture---very much Don's "dark-side."<br /><br />Yeah, it's fashionable to resist the temptation to give "Hollywood Happy Endings" in the Indie-World...But here Jarmuscsh has carried out the lack of any sort of conclusion to the ultimate point of not-caring.  The idea of sending this guy on the trail of his past is brilliant.  The fact is, when he bothered to meet these women, he didn't say anything that could have helped him to understand why these relationships never worked.  Where did he go wrong?  What could he learned now that would help him to resolve his Don Juan complex and learn to truly love?  When the ex's ask him why he's there, he just gives lame responses like "I was in the neighborhood."  The thing is, it's Winston, with his healthy life urge, who has propelled this guy onto the road, to solve the mystery.  The mystery is ostensibly to find the actual mother of the son, but we know that the real mission is for the aging lothario to find himself.<br /><br />The fact that this film maker has set up such a promising plot and then dropped it makes me angry. It could have been a film of substance, in which a real human being learns something but Jarmusch dropped the ball and contented himself with a stylistic trick.<br /><br />I also object to the condescending treatment the four ex-girlfriends are given.  Each one is shown in the most negative light. As another reviewer wrote, I was glad when the biker guy punched our hero in the nose---he deserved it.<br /><br />The obvious elephant-in-the-middle-of-the-room issue, which I will dare to mention, is---what did these four attractive women ever see in this guy in the first place?  I think this is a guy's movie, made by a guy, with a guy's fantasy point of view.  The fact that this really ugly guy with zero personality once had all these beautiful women, some of whom look like they still want him, is sheer wish-fullfillment on the part of the director in my humble female opinion.<br /><br />I was going to give this three stars, but now that I think about it, I'm reducing it to two.  The two stars are not for the writer-director, nor for Bill Murray, but for the wonderful women actors who showed up for this endeavor and for the promise of what this film could have been.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />This story of a jaded middle-aged man (Bill Murray) visiting various ex-girlfriends to see if he sired a child with one of them has no romance or excitement but it's a good character study from Jarmusch and a fine film; if you're interested in the new Bill Murray (who, as in Lost in Translation, eschews sarcasm for weariness) or the director then by all means rent Broken Flowers.<br /><br />3/4</p></br><a href="../users/A1K3NQAO49LXL2.html">A1K3NQAO49LXL2</a><br/><p>Great film of Bill Murray moping. Sort of like his Lost in Translation persona, or maybe even him in Rushmore. He's a middle-aged man in a track suit, he's had several women in his life. The day that one of them leaves him he gets a letter; he doesn't know which one of his ex-girlfriends it's from, but she says in the letter that she had his baby 20 years ago. With the help of his Ethiopian neighbour (cue opportunity to have Ethiopian jazz in the soundtrack) he works backwards and comes up with five names. So he goes to visit several of them to try and solve the "mystery." There's not much mystery, but there's an opportunity to film several episodes. The first one is the best - Sharon Stone, and her "daughter" Lolita, played by a magnetically horny Alexis Dziena. It goes downhill from there. A lot can happen to people in 20 years - some end up in loveless marriages with real estate developers, some become psychics, while others slum it as biker chicks. But life is long and good things can come of it if you're Bill Murray and you don't take things too seriously or get delusional about a son you may or may not have. There's always tomorrow. The film uses quite good songs in its soundtrack (including, briefly, Sleep), and the fantastic "There Is An End" by The Greenhornes with Holly Golightly. Great boogie woogie retro rock with cool old guitar plucking. Crazy, dad, crazy...</p></br><a href="../users/A356RFKNIG043B.html">A356RFKNIG043B</a><br/><p>Dear Bill, Why are you doing this to us, to yourself, to future generations of potentially giddy viewers? The Razor's Edge is one thing, Lost In Translation another, and now this. But, they're all pretty much the SAME thing!<br /><br />You're one of the truly great comic actors of your time. If you weren't so funny and so successful at it, you'd never get to make these "serious" movies, because you are NOT a serious dramatic actor. So why keep humping that dead camel? The truth becomes clear when there is easily more entertainment in the 7-minute blooper reel than in this entire film.<br /><br />You pick good directors, but these scripts seem designed to let you sit expressionlessly, scene after scene, as if a tiny tic will convey your inner Brando essence. Your picking these static characters in these inert movies is killing us! It's not that we want to see Carl chase gophers forever, or Todd give noogies. It's just that your making this kind of plodding film is like Michelangelo running a plumbing service. He can do it, sure...but what's the point? There are lots of plumbers in the world. There is only one Michelangelo. Let him do what nobody else can.<br /><br />And there is only one Bill Murray. He's the guy in the blooper reel who can't help but be funny at every turn with everybody. He's the guy who fills our hearts with joy and mirth and feeling. But he seems nowhere present in this and your other "serious" movies, and the guy who replaces him is, well, rather boring.<br /><br />When you go halfway, as in Rushmore and the Tenenbaums (though not so much in Aquatic, but Wes knows who you are and uses you well), you get the dramatic approval you seek, but framed by your comic perfection. Take away the comedy, and nothing happens.<br /><br />Maybe I'm way off here. But there was so much life in that blooper reel, and so little life in this movie. Jarmusch says in a dvd extra here, "It's not my job to know what a film is about. It's my job to make it. It's the viewers' job to tell me what it's about." Well, say no more. Please tell Jim that this viewer thinks it's about not knowing how to write a well-paced, continually engrossing film. It's about taking a handful of good actors and giving them little to work with. But most of all, it's about using one of the great comic actors now working and watching him be funny all day, except when the cameras are rolling. Then he just sits there and projects nothingness, in a film that could have taken its conceits twice as far in less time.<br /><br />What a waste. So much more could be done in this turgid bore, but instead we get a kind of college-level faux Bergman flick that uses good music as filler for the dramatic tension that the writer/director just can't produce. It worked ok in Down By Law and some others; here it's just a crime.<br /><br />Bill, it's your life and you've given us more than enough. You owe us nothing. But perhaps you owe it to yourself to find more scripts that let your true genius come to the fore. You could go halfway again: what if Nick falls in love with his lounge pianist and then finds out she only has a month to live? Just kidding, but man I miss your humor! You're a master at it.<br /><br />Put it this way: if you can't hit a one-iron but are great with the five-wood, bring it home on the 18th at Pebble with what you do best.<br /><br />Thanks for the laughs, Bill.<br />Regards, A Fan</p></br><a href="../users/AQ990HW13DP08.html">AQ990HW13DP08</a><br/><p>Does Don Johnston (Bill Murray) really have a 19-year-old son from his philandering past? Does it matter? An anonymous letter he received insists that he does, and that his enterprising son is on a journey to find his father. Don's not so sure; perhaps it's a hoax. Next door neighbor Winston, a wannabe detective writer, cannot resist the intrigue, and sends Don packing to visit four girl friends from his past, all the while looking for important "clues" to discover who sent the letter and bore his son.<br /><br />  We know that Don will visit four former lovers, and that they will now live in extraordinarily different settings. "It sure is crazy how people change," exclaims the husband of a former lover. Laura (Sharon Stone) is a "closet organizer," Dora (Frances Conroy) was a former hippie who lives in a wealthy but sterile suburb and sells "high quality pre-fab homes," Carmen (Jessica Lange) is a former lawyer turned "pet communicator," and Penny (Tilda Swinton) lives in rural isolation among angry grease ball bikers. Winston identified a fifth candidate who died, so Don visits her grave too. But this simple road trip develops more subtleties than we might imagine.<br /><br />  The journey transforms Don. At first he professed wholesale disinterest, then he agreed to go, he eventually becomes interested in these former lovers and how their lives had intersected, and by the end he himself is haunted with finding his son. Also, violent dreams about any number of other women agitate him with unpleasant memories. A second letter from his most recent former girl friend Sherry on similar stationery bookends the end of the film. But to the last of the film you do not know if Don succeeds in his quest, and neither does he. Then you realize that this film is not about Don's girlfriends or his phantom son but about himself, an aging Don Juan who made money "in computers" but who awakens to move beyond his laconic, couch-potato existence. He is not trying to find former lovers, or even his son; he's trying to find himself.</p></br><a href="../users/A359IT81FBX64Y.html">A359IT81FBX64Y</a><br/><p>Nobody does comatose middle-aged angst better than Bill Murray! Just like Lost in Translation, Murray plays to the hilt the role of a rich, jaded, washed-up, older ladies' man. The only problem is that he's boring to watch. This could have been a decent movie if the character of Don Johnston actually had a spark of mischievous life left in him, and I know just the actor who could have pulled it off brilliantly: Jack Nicholson. Sure, Jack's fat, ugly, and middle-aged, but he still effuses like crazy his "bad boy" pheromones. Murray's deadpan demeanor might play better in the role of a corpse in a wake.<br /><br />As for the story, I did not like the inconclusive ending - it seemed pretentiously avant-garde. A decent conclusion might have redeemed the plodding plot. And why did all of Don's exes have to be messed up in one way or another? Is it asking too much for just one of them to be happy and normal? Wait, I get it! All those beautiful, delicate, messed up women are the broken flowers, and our Don Johnston, aka Don Juan, is the cad who broke them, right? But the movie never shows us how these ladies were broken, and it never shows Don as a cad. Don is boring, depressed, rude, and unwilling to make a commitment - just like that other middle-aged twit in Shopgirl, and just like the real-life Don Johnson, come to think of it - but he seems harmless enough.<br /><br />And just how did Don remember the names of five women he had brief affairs with from twenty years ago? And within one day his neighbor could find the current addresses of all five from a quick search on the internet? Wow, I'd like to learn that trick. And of course all of the ladies happened to be home whenever he came unexpectedly knocking on their doors. Oh, and give me a break with the oh-so-highbrow literate humor when the half-dressed nymphet teenage daughter of one of Don's amours introduces herself as "Lola, but my friends call me Lo, but my real name is Lolita." (And she hasn't got a clue about the book or movie of her infamous namesake) That's just too funny - and it makes me feel so smart that I got it. Even more highbrow humor could be found with numerous people mixing up Don Johnston with Don Johnson. Did Johnson pay to have his name repeated, like the embedded ads for Ford Taurus and MapQuest in this film?<br /><br />More seriously, Don is a poor communicator and he never seems to feel empathy for anyone. That explains why he's alone, but it doesn't explain how he continues to attract an endless stream of beautiful, younger women. Since he leaves Sharon Stone with a very satisfied smile after a sleepover tryst, I guess we're supposed to assume that Don is a great lover. Don may appear to be bored, depressed, and rude, but he's red hot in bed! Some of Don's remarks are insensitive and border on cruel. The best scene in the film is when an oafish biker punches him in the eye for being rude. I wanted to punch him, too.</p></br></body></html>

Excellently captures Harlem's 1970s setting.<br />*Good story that encompasses Frank Lucas' entire career. Lots of interesting ideas concerning his approach to his business. Also good focus on his enemy (whoever Russel Crowe played, I forget his name). It was very interesting to see them cooperate at the end.<br />*Good, somewhat fascinating portrayal of the main characters.<br />*Plenty of drama.<br />*Some action and violence.<br />*Some memorable scenes and imagery.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*A little long.<br /><br />Compared to other gangster films, this one seems no better and no worse. It has lots of good imagery and interesting scenes. Ridley Scott's direction is excellent, as always. There is a lot of drama, and it looks like they went into a lot of trouble to make the film as realistic as possible to the characters, events, and settings. Still, it doesn't seem as thrilling or deep as the established classics. If you're into these kinds of films, then by all means watch it. Otherwise, rent it first and see what you think.<br /><br />The DVDs contain a massive shed-load of special features on the first two discs.  Disc one includes both the theatrical and extended cuts.  The third disc in this collector's set has only another hour's worth of features, and the digital copy of the film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MNMZMM6BGLTA.html">A2MNMZMM6BGLTA</a><br/><p>I would say this movie is a good companion piece for The French Connection, Serpico and also Prince of the City. I like the movie pretty much from top to bottom and found it to be an old school cop movie like the great ones from the 70's.<br /><br />I recommend it to everybody. I didn't however like that they gave it the 'feel good' ending that they did. I have also read that some of the stuff they commented on at the end about Lucas helping put so many people behind bars was b.s. so that soured me too.</p></br><a href="../users/A18IK6YI6T3RK2.html">A18IK6YI6T3RK2</a><br/><p>This being a Ridley Scott movie, I was worried about the length, I was afraid it would drag, I mean the extended version is three hours, but much to my pleasant surprise, it never drags.  Denzel Washington is fantastic as ever, he exudes power and he is very believeable as this nefarious Harlem capitalist.  Crowe was very good as well, he can do just about any role and he is as good as Washington in this, if not better.  I had wished Scott had included more one on one moments with Crowe and Washington, it was sort of like the movie, Heat, with Pacino and De Niro having like ten minutes together in a three hour movie.  I was pleased to see that Ruby Dee got any Academy Award nomination for her role in this, she was great; it reminded me of her heartbreaking role in Jungle Fever.  The extended version gives a slightly longer ending; it provides for some more screen time between Crowe and Washington, but frankly it feels added on, like it was an afterthought.  This is a powerful movie, based on real events and it resonates.</p></br><a href="../users/A2DAHERP7HYJGO.html">A2DAHERP7HYJGO</a><br/><p>The late 60s and early 70s gave us a lot of different things to remember. Apparently one of them was the burgeoning business of drug dealing. While a number of drug smugglers came and went, there was one that made a killing, literally, during this time. His name was Frank Lucas and his story is told in this dynamic drama/biopic.<br /><br />Denzel Washington stars as Lucas, the right hand man of criminal mastermind Bumpy Johnson (Clarence Williams III). When Bumpy passes away, Frank takes over his action in the streets of Harlem. At the same time, several others attempt to do the same. It only ends in a bloody finish with Frank on top.<br /><br />Looking for a way to make the sale of heroin more profitable, Frank decided to cut out the middle man and go direct. Via his cousin in Vietnam, he contacts one of the largest wholesale dealers there. The pair strike a deal and soon Frank is smuggling in large amounts, cutting it less than his competition and selling more and more.<br /><br />At the same time, an overly honest cop by the name of Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe) is doing his best to put an end to the dope dealers. Disliked by other policemen because of his honesty (he even turns in $1,000,000 that he finds during a stake out), Frank is sought out by his supervisor when a drug task force is formed in New Jersey. Choosing their men carefully, the team sets out to take down the suppliers of drugs rather than the street hustlers.<br /><br />The paths of these two men will eventually cross, but the story revolves more around Frank Lucas. Frank brings in his brothers to back him in his business dealings and sales. He rules the streets with a savage brutality and at the same time does what he can to help the people of the neighborhood. These people look up to him full well knowing what it is he does for a living.<br /><br />Preferring to attract as little attention to himself as possible, a single night wearing a fur coat to a championship boxing event leads to Frank's picture being taken. This is the first step that Richie and his team take to discovering that Frank is the main supplier of heroin in the city. It is the first step in the end of Frank's reign of the streets.<br /><br />As always, Washington does a fantastic job in his performance here, exuding the cool, calculated ways of Frank Lucas as well as the outburst of anger and menace when times change. Crowe does an admirable job as well, showing Richie's discomfort with public speaking and his change, the confidence he gains as he reaches that moment where he captures the man behind the myth.<br /><br />Brutal, honest and a true story to boot, this movie is one that should be seen not only for the tale of two individuals but as a precautionary tale for anyone considering this lifestyle as well as the toll taken by heroin users. A bonus here is interviews with both the real life Richie Roberts and Frank Lucas who helped with the making of this movie. To think that Lucas made it back to the free world is amazing. To think he lived to see a movie made of his life is even more so.</p></br><a href="../users/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z.html">AEQFYOI6YJ83Z</a><br/><p>Frank Lucas is king.  No one disputes that.  They dispute it, they die.  Richie Roberts is the sole exception: an honest cop--think Serpico on steroids--who is dedicating his life and career to bringing down America's drug kingpin.  And nothing--absolutely nothing--is going to stop these two men...except each other.<br /><br />To say "American Gangster" is a thrill to watch is, quite simply, a horrible understatement.  Ridley Scott's film rockets along (despite it's epic length) at break-neck speed, fueled by stellar performances from Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe (and when the two men meet, in the interrogation room, you'll be so enthralled you'll have to try not to giggle in excitement).  The supporting cast, too, is spectacular: Ruby Dee as Lucas's mother is a wonder; Josh Brolin is absolutely chilling as a corrupt cop; Cuba Gooding Jr., in his brief role, is fantastic (we can forgive him for his last dozen movies or so).  The rest of the cast is fantastic as well.<br /><br />I'm not saying "American Gangster" is perfect; it has its flaws, such as a couple of unnecessary side plots, and the fact that Roberts's story parallel's "Serpico" so much (it's a true story, so we can't change the facts; however, having just watched "Serpico" not too long ago, it was stuck in my head).  But...well, let's face it, you're coming to this movie to see two powerhouse actors go up against each other.  Remember Robert De Niro and Al Pacino in "Heat"?  Same thing, except with heroin.  And you're gonna get what you want, what you're expecting, plus a whole hell of a lot more.  "American Gangster" isn't quite on the classic level, but it's damn good cinema, an expertly-made film that brings a new (true) twist to the gangster movie.  Buy it, rent it, whatever--just see it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FEJIORC1MBG3.html">A2FEJIORC1MBG3</a><br/><p>There is a key scene in Ridley Scott's riveting crime epic "American Gangster" that speaks volumes about the personal code that drives one of the film's principal characters. "Look at the way you're dressed," says the impeccably groomed and tastefully attired 1970s Harlem drug kingpin Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington) in disgust, to his ostentatiously pimped-out brother Huey (Chiwetel Ejiofor), "...it's a look that says: `arrest me'. Remember, the loudest one in the room is also the weakest one in the room."<br /><br />It's one of the axioms Lucas picked up while paying his dues working as a driver for his mentor, an old-school Harlem crime lord (Clarence Williams III). By the time his boss keels over from a heart attack, Lucas has been thoroughly schooled in the shrewd business acumen of how to remain a "wolf in sheep's clothing"; no matter how venal your methods are for getting to the top and maintaining your position, if you're able to swing it while maintaining a respectable public appearance, everybody will still love you.<br /><br />Scott's film is all about "appearances"; judging a book by its cover, if you will. When we are first introduced to the film's other main character, New Jersey police detective Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe), we're not sure if we're observing a cop and his partner serving a warrant, or if we're watching a disheveled street thug and his pal pulling a B & E on someone's apartment. While his personal grooming habits may be questionable, it is apparent that his integrity is of the highest order. He is an honest cop in a department that is swimming in corruption (he's sneered at as a "boy scout" when he turns in nearly one million dollars in cash discovered in a dealer's car).<br /><br />Lucas, on the other hand, maintains the outward appearance of an upstanding citizen. He has prospered via an ingenious Southeast Asian heroin pipeline that bypasses any pesky "middlemen". He buys an estate in the suburbs and sets up house for his brothers and his mother (played by the great Ruby Dee, who we don't see enough of these days). He marries a beautiful Latina (Lymari Nadal) and ingratiates himself as a pillar of the community.<br /><br />Steven Zailian's screenplay is based on true events; the story takes place in the same seedy 70s N.Y.C. milieu that inspired films like "The French Connection", "Serpico" and "Prince of the City". There are numerous references made to the real-life French connection case, as well as the police corruption that was depicted the latter two films.<br /><br />Scott uses a trick that worked well for Michael Mann in the similarly structured "Heat".  He builds a considerable amount of dramatic tension by keeping his two powerhouse stars apart for the lion's share of the film, while steadily teasing on the inevitability that the two men's professional paths are destined to cross. When Washington and Crowe finally do share a scene together, it proves to be well worth the wait (when you see it, watch closely for the coffee cup prop that becomes a proxy chess piece; it's a masterstroke of gesture from both actors).<br /><br />Scott utilizes his patented ultra-slick visual style, although a grittier look might have served the story better. Despite the deliberate pacing for the first 2 hours, something about  the denouement feels curiously rushed (sorry, can't elaborate-potential spoiler!) The performances by Washington and Crowe are superb, with a nice turn as well from Josh Brolin as a corrupt Special Investigations Unit cop, and Armand Assante as a mob big shot. I liked the period soundtrack as well, although we need to declare a moratorium on Bobby Womack's "Across 110th Street". It's a great song, but it's now been used in three films!</p></br><a href="../users/A1JVSIWDF0WT22.html">A1JVSIWDF0WT22</a><br/><p>No need to say more about this film other than it is as good as could be expected from the teaming of Denzel, Crowe and Ridley Scott. Be aware though of the high level of truly repulsive violence in it, no matter how much it is an integral part of the story. I noticed people literally jumping out of their seats at the theater I saw it in, funny thing is, when a single animal is killed in the movie they decided not to show it on camera, I guess movie goers are a lot more offended by the killing of animals than that of people in films.<br />With the possible exception of "A Good Year" which wasn't that bad but wasn't great eiter, it seems like Russell Crowe hasn't made anything but great, great films in the past 10 years, starting with LA Confidential and up to this one. He has to be the biggest sure thing in Hollywood these days.</p></br><a href="../users/ARMVAHWQQ9S8A.html">ARMVAHWQQ9S8A</a><br/><p>The mere thought of an EXTENDED version of "American Gangster" makes me want to run.  Why would a movie viewer subject themselves to adding more tediousness to an already tedious film?  As with any Denzel movie, the acting is great, but... the story is really, really unfocused.  Yes, it's based on a true story, but movies and books are supposed to tell a coherent, focused tale, and "American Gangster" very simply doesn't.<br /><br />Plot threads are built up, but never pay off.  Many scenes seem pointless and nearly every single one seems over-long.  Also, it appears that every other scene of the film could be titled "Frank Lucas (Denzel) does a gangster thing to shock you."  It's just that.  Furthermore, the scary thing about that is that when I saw this movie in the theatre, the audience cheered every time he shot someone or set someone on fire.  That's more of a fault of our society than the movie, though the latter does seem to glorify Frank Lucas and put him in a very morally ambiguous area.  The fact that most people took scenes that were likely put in to be shocking and disgusting as "cool" left me with a bad taste in my mouth.<br /><br />Again, though... my distaste paled in comparison to my boredom.  Could it have BEEN any longer?<br /><br />I can't believe this dreck was made by the same man behind <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UBMWG4">Blade Runner</a> and, one of my favorite movies, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009ZYBY">Gladiator</a>.  I would never, never watch this again, nor could I recommend it to any serious film fan.<br /><br />2/10</p></br><a href="../users/A9LAPV8XNKZVZ.html">A9LAPV8XNKZVZ</a><br/><p>I waited the whole movie for the scene in the trailer, where Denzel executes someone and drops the gun as in "The Godfather". It wasn't there. We've seen the story before, and better done. A walk thru for talented people.</p></br><a href="../users/AT6CZDCP4TRGA.html">AT6CZDCP4TRGA</a><br/><p>As many reviewers have noted, this film is not much of an innovation to the genre of cops-and-mobsters flicks.  However, it really doesn't do anything wrong as a film, and does perform a wonderful public service in showing the reality and depth of corruption and collusion between drug lords and the "system" (=local law enforcement, court/prison system, politicians, business, etc.).  That by itself is a wonderful relief from the usual "good guys vs. bad guys" simplistic dualism that the media usually bombards us with when covering the so-called "war on drugs."  So there is a refreshingly down to earth, let's-be-real-folks sensibility here, not some puerile moral soapbox. The fact that it's based on a true story, despite the inevitable poetic Hollywood embellishments, only makes it that much more powerful.<br /><br />Director Ridley Scott has not made a truly bad movie in ages, and here he picks the two best leads out there to carry the film, Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe, both of whom effortlessly command the viewer's attention in every scene they're in.  The narrative unfolds slowly at first but then quickly gears into a brisk pace (not as brisk as a Scorsese film, but plenty brisk) and together with Scott's trademark mastery of visual framing, made the 2.5 hours' runtime really fly by.  There is actually not that much graphic violence for a movie of this genre, so don't expect a "Scarface" or "New Jack City."<br /><br />There is, God bless, a fair amount of very very yummy eye candy for male viewers (whom I'd imagine are the main audience for this type of movie) through Crowe's luscious ex-wife and especially his SMOKIN' HOT lawyer whom he's boinking on the side, oodles of gorgeous black women especially the ones working in Washington's heroin lab who are not allowed to wear clothes for fear they'd steal the goods, and of course Washington's Puerto Rican wife.  No explicit sex scenes, just plenty of artful nudity by some exquisitely-chosen actresses.<br /><br />The "uncut extended version" of this movie doesn't feel so bloated like many "extended versions" do, plus it has an extended ending that I found pretty cool.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>A story told smoothly and very well. A richly satisfying film and probably the best gangster crime drama of the year.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FMJJKSVQDDQ.html">A1FMJJKSVQDDQ</a><br/><p>This is yet another ultimate movie from Ridley Scott, Denzel Washington, and Russell Crowe. This is not just a gangster flick, but, like The Godfather & Heat, is also a psychological drama. It tells the story of Frank Lucas, an African-American man who becomes a #1 drug importer in 60's Harlem. Richie Roberts is the cop who's willing to bring Lucas and his tainted business down. Seems like a simple story, but the film itself is far more complex. There is more story than action (not to say it is bad, but it really stands out with other awe-inspiring motion pictures). Ridley Scott simply knows how to make a great film, and this is one of his greatest. The performances here are also memorable. Washington, Crowe, Brolin, Gooding Jr., Nadal, Dee, Common, and T.I. give their roles their all, and they do it almost flawlessly. I'm surprised Washington wasn't even nominated for an Oscar. And the costumes and sets are just ravishing! It really feels like you're back in the late 60's, where you're anticipating the most intense boxing night in history.<br /><br />It's not as great as other gangster/cop flicks, but it's great on its own level. Grade: A</p></br><a href="../users/A1HG2DOSBZEX4I.html">A1HG2DOSBZEX4I</a><br/><p>Ridley Scott's American Gangster is a gritty portrait of the New York drug underworld in the early 1970's. With great performances by both DenzelWashington as drug kingpin Frank Lucas and Russell Crowe as cop Richie Roberts the film takes on both the gangster lifestyle and the currupt police problem of New York.<br /><br />The film has all the earmarks of an epic. The story written by Steve Zaillian, while a bit long at times, effectively portrays life on the streets at the time period. The camara work by Harris Savides is both gritty and dark.<br /><br />The disc I viewed was the HD DVD and while presenting a great picture and sound field is not without its problems. Now that HD has fallen to Blu Ray this may just be a passing footnote to the industry. The disc presents both the HD movie and the standard definition extended cut( some 18 minutes of additional scenes). Both versions present an audio commentary by Scott and Zaillian which is very informative. Scott takes on the problems of filmmaking on such an extensive project while Zaillian talks about the writing.<br /><br />The HD special features include the deleted scenes that were placed back into the extended version and a five minute featurette with the real Frank Lucas and Richie Roberts. The problem is that this is all that is included as extras. The standard definition disc have many more additional features that are not included in the more expensive HD package.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PN7Z2VTHICL8.html">A2PN7Z2VTHICL8</a><br/><p>It's Harlem, 1968, and "Bumpy" Johnson is speaking to his driver and right-hand man Frank Lucas (the amazing Denzel Washington).  Bumpy laments the loss of the middleman in business, the jobs lost to overseas companies, the end of the era of the working man.  When Bumpy dies and Frank takes over, he omits the middleman too and purchases his heroin directly from Bangkok and ships it via military aircraft through Vietnam to the US.  Frank is on his way up, and he doesn't let anyone stand in his way, even those who think now that Bumpy is dead, so is his business.<br /><br />Detective Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe) is an honest cop who's taking night classes to become a lawyer.  He's well aware of how corrupt the Drug Enforcement Division is, the police taking busted dope from evidence, cutting it, and reselling it on the streets.  Richie and his partner find $1M in the trunk of a dealer's car, and against his partner's warning they turn in the money.  Now they can't get backup and the other cops won't work with them because they can't trust honest cops.<br /><br />While Frank represents The American Dream (even if it's the wrong dream) by being a gentleman, a good family man who loves his mother, his wife, and America, Richie the honest cop is a failure at his marriage, a womanizer, and a absent father to his son.<br /><br />Frank's on top of the world, until an innocent gift from his wife begins his decline.  Always counseling his brothers not to dress flashy and attract attention, he makes the mistake of wearing the showy, fifty thousand dollar chinchilla coat and hat his wife gave him to a boxing match.  Sitting in better seats than the Italians, shaking hands with Joe Lewis, and standing out like a sore thumb, he catches the attention of Richie, who's heading a task force to nail all the big time drug players.  The cops are onto Frank now, both the good ones and the bad ones.  Frank is exposed, and his world is about to change.<br /><br />Though based on a true story, I've never heard of the case so I can't comment on how close to reality the film came.  The movie starts slow, and is kind of hard to get into.  Keep watching, the movie comes together and the pace quickens.  It's a movie where you'll find yourself rooting for the bad guy even though you shouldn't, because Frank seems like such a nice guy (except when he's shooting people).  It's also a movie you'll want to view again, to catch all the nuances in the relationships.  On a personal note, I liked all the old cars they found to use in the movie, not one car was outside the time frame.  This review is based on the Unrated Extended Version, not the theatrical version.  Rent first, then buy.  Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A3NL1KW56O3JR8.html">A3NL1KW56O3JR8</a><br/><p>Crowe and Washington are two of my favorites, this this movie was a real treat. Ok, so the plot is somewhat predictable but it's well acted and nicely put together. Compared to something like "The Departed" AG is a bit one-dimentional but it's definatly worth watching.<br /><br />Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>I love a great gangster movie! White Heat, Scarface, The Godfather(part 1 & 2), Goodfellas, Casino.....the list goes on and on. 'American Gangster' has a great cast, excellent production, interesting story, but for all it has going for it, the film didn't completely draw me in. It's certainly worth seeing, but I don't see myself watching this movie more than one or two more times......once to see the extended addition. I rate it 3 1/2 stars. Rent it before you buy it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HW33PQSRHLNO.html">A2HW33PQSRHLNO</a><br/><p>During the entirety of "American Gangster", the story of legendary scumbag Frank Lucas who ran the Harlem Mafia for 20 years, I wanted Denzel Washington to stop acting princpled, gentlemanly, professional and revert to "Training Day" mode.  Nostalgia for his monstrously depraved, charismatic dirty cop hit me in waves, particularly when he was conversing with Russsell Crowe at the end of the movie.<br /><br />Altogether, this is less an attempt at an honest portrayal of what the brilliant drugdealer was like than an attempt to create a "black Godfather".  Lucas is not the guy for this and despite Denzel Washington's superb acting skills, one cannot turn a heroin dealer from the ghetto into Marlon Brando's Don Corleone with this cast lineup.  The supporting actors are not there and the film moves too fast from nightclub to nightclub, sporadic murder to murder, betrayal to betrayal.  Crowe's Richie Roberts, a cop who did what he was suppposed to do at a time very few others were, has said that this movie is only "20 percent" true. In Frank Lucas' own words: "They should have never made a movie about me."<br /><br />Washington's Lucas is too evasive to really grab a hold of.  He is a bad dude, that much is clear: when a particularly nasty rival challenges him to shoot "in front of everybody" on a Harlem streetcorner, he obliges.  Washington's performance is so compelling that one wants to know more about Lucas--where did he come from, why did he end up with Bumpy Johnson, why is he such a tough guy, and what are his motives for even being in this business? But the flash and glitter of the film allow for no such answers.  What is clear is that Lucas is simply another capitalist in many ways.  When a rival by the name of Nikki Barnes cuts the purity of his infamous "Blue Magic" down for no apparent reason, Washington visits him and says: "Blue Magic" is like "Pepsi".  Okay?  I stand behind the product, and it's fast selling."  Lucas may not even see what he's doing as evil.  It's simply the way he makes money and it's very successful.<br /><br />This is movie is basically a testoterone rush and as that it works very well. I'm still waiting for Alonzo to return in "Training Day II".</p></br><a href="../users/A2GA2SO3YK6CXI.html">A2GA2SO3YK6CXI</a><br/><p>American Gangster provides a rare view into a USA that most of us, thank God for that, fail to see.<br /><br />Frank Lucas, played by Denzel Washington is a Harlem crime lord that grows up in the shadow of a great man, who teaches him great life lessons, but also... to become a criminal.<br /><br />Frank Lucas is able to amass wealth at the expense of drug addicts, bringing heroin, directly from Asia, during the Viet-Nam war. The key to this story is that the US army supports his efforts and is the means for the distribution and entry of drugs into the USA.<br /><br />The intricate web of support created by Frank Lucas is under observation by a New Jersey cop by the name of Richie Roberts, played masterfully by Russell Crowe. He is a cop who studies law and passes the bar, something that allows him to understand the consequences of each and every action and makes him a rather interesting character.<br /><br />Richie Roberts is honest to a fault, not taking kick-backs, even when it appears that no one is looking and that it is in his best interest to do what all other cops are doing. The subject of good versus evil in this movie is a constant force that makes us be riveted on the screen.<br /><br />Frank Lucas follows rules that protect him, trying hard to NEVER call attention to his person, but falls prey to the vanity of wearing a chinchilla coat his wife purchases for him. His beautiful Puerto-Rican wife fully understands who he is, and yet at some point, you can sense the guilt of never having confronted her husband to MAKE him leave a life that ultimately destroys their marriage. Frank Lucas' mother never questions all she gets from what she suspects is illegal... but at some point tries to save her son by "hitting" some sense into his life.<br /><br />A must see, perhaps one of the best movies we have seen lately!</p></br><a href="../users/A141HP4LYPWMSR.html">A141HP4LYPWMSR</a><br/><p>`American Gangster' is a bit uneven at times and somewhat overlong but the film succeeds in delivering a searing indictment on American society and the pervasive nature of corruption in the "natural order of things" as lived out in the United States during the Viet-Nam War era.<br /><br />There are scattered moments of greatness reminiscent of the classic `Godfather' movies but not quite enough to elevate this film to such a lofty level of consideration. Denziel Washington provides his usual superior performance as gangster / drug lord Frank Lucas. It's his storyline that makes the film worth watching. The role of honest cop Ritchie Roberts portrayed by Russell Crowe is the weaker of the two merging storylines but when the two finally come face to face late in the film everything comes together in grand fashion.<br /><br />My Rating: Worth a watch if you're a Washington or Crowe fan, into gangster films, or just curious about the socio-political climate in the `60's; -4 Stars-.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>Despite the fact I like Blade Runner and Alien, I always found Ridley Scott's career rather spotty. Known not sticking to the same genre, there's times where he'll offer an interesting film, other times he misses the ball severely and others will outright praise a film that really had little to go for it. That's where I always find fault with his films, especially current ones: they're directed with such gusto and flair and outright spectacle at times that whatever story there is gets excused since it's got an "epic" story thanks to the visuals. American Gangster doesn't have the huge visuals but it's long with lots of speaking roles and is one of those kind of films where it'll entertain you in spots and divide in others.<br /><br />After Bumpy Johnson dies, his right-hand man Frank Lucas takes up his mantel but does things a little differently this time. Rather than buying heroin from the Mafia, Lucas goes straight to the source in Southeast Asia, strikes a deal which cuts down on costs and thanks to Lucas' low price, it becomes a smash in Harlem though there's more overdoses thanks to the heroin's purity. Keeping family members involved and considerably well looked after, Lucas rises to the top of the drug underworld.<br /><br />On the other side of the law, Richie Roberts is an almost too-honest cop more well known for reporting near a million in unmarked bills than his cop work. With his personal life not as strong and cops not wanting to work with him because of his anti-corruption views, he eventually joins a drug task force designed to go after the big suppliers and players as opposed to small-town dealers. Unbeknownest to him, Lucas is the man to go after but how can you catch someone that doesn't even stand out in the crowd?<br /><br />I'm at that age finally where I can appreciate the more longer, character-driven films where emphasis is placed more on acting and pacing as opposed to getting the story over and done with (Seven Samurai, despite being over 3 hours, never feels it) but on occasion, a film comes out that, while not long as any others, still feels like trimming could've benefited the film. Like Kingdom of Heaven, it's not a film long because of so much twists and turns but rather just seeing character's lives and who they are. There's times where the story gets really fascinating and you get caught up in it but then others, you're looking at the running time and find only an hour has passed. It doesn't add anything to the genre or even does what it does the best, but it's probably hard film to walk out on as well.<br /><br />It's hard to deny that American Gangster is similar to other crime dramas but one that pops up is Heat with a look at both sides who are just as adept at what they do rather than good guy is good, bad guy evil. But whereas Robert De Niro's side is more interesting in that film, here the film is more on the good side since he's just as likable and interesting as a character and although Russell Crowe is quickly becoming like Martin Scorsese's own De Niro...(oh yeah, he doesn't use him anymore, more like DiCaprio), he does deliver a good performance. One that's disappointing is Denzel Washington since, despite having a strong screen presence, he's just not that interesting a character and seems more like his Training Day role part two.<br /><br />Like Gladiator and Kingdom of Heaven as well as the phenomenal Blade Runner release recently, Scott loves the big DVD's with tons of features. With the original as well as the extended cut along with several featurettes, it's an interesting look at the film that's just memorable enough to recommend but not enough to absolutely love.</p></br><a href="../users/A14Q6R4481YFFG.html">A14Q6R4481YFFG</a><br/><p>Hard work.  Creativity.  Guts.  Cutting out the middleman.  Honesty in operation.  Maintaining brand image.  This is what makes American business great.  Why should the smack trade be any different?  One enterprising American decides to take the best of the American business model, and do for heroin what Best Buy did for electronics.  We follow the arc of Frank Lucas' (Denzel Washington) dazzling career from small-time hood to capo de tutti capi (di colore), and of his nemesis Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe), who eventually brings him down.  Yes, this is a "the rise and fall of" film like Carlito's Way, but it's probably the best of the recent offerings in the genre.  Would it be too much to compare it to "Little Caesar"?  I don't think so.<br /><br />All in all, a great guy movie.  Good violence, good action.  There is some female nudity, which is always appreciated by my prurient and adolescent mind.  Unfortunately, there wasn't a lot of it, and it wasn't exploitative or overtly sexual.  But you take what you can get.<br /><br />The standout scene for me is the confrontation between Lucas and Roberts in the time-honored "let's make a deal" scene.  It's really a pleasure to watch two outstanding actors at the top of their game working with great dialogue and direction.</p></br><a href="../users/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ.html">A12X2J7AVZ04IQ</a><br/><p>Interesting film, and a good expose of a modern crime boss. Denzel is very good as Frank Lucas, and his motivations are well explored. However, Russell Crowe has an amazingly complex role, and handles his material like a super-pro. This took place during the same time frame as Frank Serpico, and good cops had a really tough time. Ridley Scott did a fine job in bringing out the complexities of the narrative and the characters. Period detail, even though it was only in the 60's, was right-on, and it's always nice to see Ruby Dee, if even so briefly. Fine as she always is, I'm sure she won her awards because of who she is; she certainly wasn't challenged in this role (I liked her a lot in the TV version of "The Stand"). As a history lesson, this is worth a look. Production values are high, and the second DVD disc fills in a lot. Worth seeing...</p></br><a href="../users/AUHG8KSHI529U.html">AUHG8KSHI529U</a><br/><p>While there is a real grit to this film, it is never sensationalistic and does not glorify crime.  This is the story of two real life people, Frank Lucas and Richie Roberts.  Frank Lucas grew up in North Carolina and fled to New York to avoid trouble with the law.  On the streets of Harlem he became the right hand man of a gangster who ruled Harlem under the Italian mafia, Bumpy Johnson.  After Bumpy died, Frank rethought his position in life and what he wanted to do about it.<br /><br />What he decided to do was become the main supplier of Heroin in New York and New Jersey.  He hatched a scheme to go to Vietnam and Thailand and from there into the mountain jungles to buy uncut heroin direct and cut out all the middlemen in the drug trade.  How he got it back to the states is one of the interesting plot points of the movie and if you were alive during those years you probably remember the news stories after he got busted.<br /><br />Along the way, he brings his family up from North Carolina and they build their own drug business that is so effective (the Blue Magic brand heroin they sell is twice as potent at half the price) that the Mafia works out a deal to buy wholesale from him!  Yes, he is ruthless.  Yes, we see the squalor of what his drugs do to people.  Yes, we see the degradation of the women who work to cut and package his dope and have to work naked so they can't steal anything.  We briefly see the brothels, but the way they are shown nothing could be less sexy.  It is all just so sad and filthy.  Unlike the Godfather films, this movie doesn't try to pretend there is nobility and doesn't separate us from where Frank's millions come from.  However, Frank separates himself.  We see scenes of him at Church with his mother, of them holding hands and praying around their Thanksgiving Day meal, and so on.  Frank views himself as just another business man moving a commodity that people want and are going to buy with or without him.  So, he rationalizes, why not cash in.<br /><br />Pursuing Frank is Detective Richie Roberts.  Remember, this was the time of the movie "Prince of the City" and the police force was notoriously corrupt.  This was especially true of the drug squads.  Richie will not take.  He just wants to be an honest cop and this confuses and enrages the crooked cops, but gets him on a team trying to actually go after the big drug dealers.  The death of his former partner who got into heroin gives him a lead to the Blue Magic brand.  You see, the junkies weren't used to the stuff being so potent and there were many deaths from it.  The movie's main plot is how Richie learns about Frank and finally brings him down.  A nice twist in the film that was also a part of real life is that Richie was also going to law school and passed the bar.  So, when it came time to prosecute Frank, Richie did it.<br /><br />The extras disk has a feature that shows the real Richie and Frank and how they are still friends today.  Richie eventually became a defense attorney and worked to defend Frank and get him out of jail after serving 15 years instead of the 70 he was sentenced to.<br /><br />An interesting and honest film that I found quite compelling.  Frank is played by Denzel Washington and Richie is played by Russell Crowe.  They both do superb work.</p></br><a href="../users/A36NUDST4Y5JBA.html">A36NUDST4Y5JBA</a><br/><p>The positive reviews' already written says it all.  The scene where Denzel's Lucas burns the $50,000 Chinchilla coat said it all for me.  See what happen's when you show off?  You draw unwanted attention to  yourself!  Lucas was on top of the world and still ended up in jail, his family in ruins.  Great film (and object lesson) for the interested.<br /><br />I rate this movie: 5 stars!</p></br><a href="../users/A36RS7KTNOBROF.html">A36RS7KTNOBROF</a><br/><p>I never knew about this true account of how drugs were brought in the USA during the late 60's and 70's.The acting and story are brilliant.I just got done watching the film,and I can't wait to see it again.</p></br><a href="../users/A34PAZQ73SL163.html">A34PAZQ73SL163</a><br/><p>I had no inkling that this film would be as outstanding as it was. I figured it was just another pop release along the lines of the lackluster "We Own the Night." I was totally wrong though and could not stop watching once it started. I'd put it right up there with The Departed, but below masterpieces such as The Godfather and Goodfellas. No matter where you place it, American Gangster touches on a seldom discussed topic in the history of crime and is riveting. If you haven't seen Across 110th Street it really adds to this film's appeal. Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe were magnificent and I was pleased to see Chiwetel Ejiofor in the cast. I loved "Dirty Pretty Things" and he gave an amazing performance as Okwe. Josh Brolin's Detective Trupo was haunting. I know, of course, of his dad and step-mom but was not familiar with him beforehand. Overall, American Gangster is a must see.</p></br><a href="../users/A17FLA8HQOFVIG.html">A17FLA8HQOFVIG</a><br/><p>I wanted to see this film because there was a lot of buzz about it and because I like gangster films.  However, I never read much about it first, and therefore didn't realize that it was based on a true story which happened in the 1970s.  I saw it simply as another Hollywood formula flick with Denzel Washington cast as the drug kingpin and Russell Crowe cast as the honest cop who brings him down.  That said, I relaxed and enjoyed the film, but I must say that I laughed out loud often because of what seemed like a very contrived plot.  For example, the cop character turns in a million dollars in unmarked bills making him hated by other cops and therefore incorruptible.  And the African American drug kingpin from the South buys a house for his mama.  Denzel Washington plays it cool, so cool in fact that he seems unreal, especially in the scenes where he goes to Southeast Asia to buy drugs from the source.  He is always dapper and in control of all emotions.  His role called for little if any subtleties.  Russell Crowe, on the other hand, had a more difficult role to play.  His character was always full of self doubt.  In spite of that, or perhaps because of that, it became a mission for him to arrest Denzel Washington.  How it all plays out makes a fast, well paced film, which held my interest throughout.<br /><br />It was only at the end of the film that I realized that the story was real, and then I went flying to the internet to learn more background.  This gives the film a different context and I appreciated it more.  But I just can't help remember how funny some of the stereotypes were.<br /><br />Recommended for some light entertainment, but American Gangster doesn't even get on the playing field when compared with a show like the Sopranos.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IOJE0W1NXOSE.html">A1IOJE0W1NXOSE</a><br/><p>Denzel Washington plays the part of Frank Lucas, a gutsy black gangster who sets himself apart from the Mafia by importing and selling drugs on his own.  As he builds his empire, an honest and persistant cop (Russell Crowe)sets out to catch him.  As Lucas's money and power increase, Crowe closes in on his operation.  This is a compelling and well-done movie which shows the hypocrisy of a gangster, living an orderly family life, while other people's children die from the drugs that he distributes.  Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe play the fascinating cat-and-mouse game of two men who are both very good at what they do, and they provide a very good evening's entertainment.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R2YB0WTTB0IJ.html">A3R2YB0WTTB0IJ</a><br/><p>*** 2007. Directed by Ridley Scott. Two nominations for the Oscars and two other for the Golden Globes. The film tells the story of the black NYC mobster who brought, during the Vietnam war, Asian heroin into the U.S.A.. Ridley Scott is no Francis Ford Coppola and no Sergio Leone and AMERICAN GANGSTER is just an average and long movie, without any epic dimension, about the life of a criminal. Already forgotten.</p></br><a href="../users/A18758S1PUYIDT.html">A18758S1PUYIDT</a><br/><p>Russell Crowe proves once again that he is one of the most versatile and chameleon-like actors working these days, this time in a role as a cop trying to bring down a drug kingpin.  Denzel Washington gives a nuanced performance as Frank Lucas, who ran a tremendous drug operation in the 1970s that spanned two continents.<br /><br />Director Ridley Scott handles the complex and lengthy tale well, with excellent production values, appropriate music, and a nicely executed ending that gives us a bit more info on the two main characters even after we read subtitles about what became of them.<br /><br />And once again, Crowe is dissed by the Academy, which could have nominated this film instead of Juno or Atonement.  But what else is new?</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>As a huge fan of Russell Crowe (I don't even know if the word `huge' can really relay how much I do absolutely love this man) I obviously had to see `American Gangster'.  It was just a huge plus to have greats like Denzel Washington and the under-seen Josh Brolin (what a breakout year for him this was) included in the cast.  I mentioned this movie a bit when reviewing the stunning `Zodiac' and while their similarities are few I can see why some would link the two together.  They both utilize lengthened scenes to enhance a moody atmosphere, `Zodiac' leaning towards the creepy unsettling feeling of never catching the bad guy (whom they never catch) but `American Gangster' uses these scenes and apparent slowed pace and long running time to accomplish something else, fuller characters.  I think that's probably the one thing that I loved most about `American Gangster' is that by the time the credits began to role I felt as if I knew everyone, even those with few scenes, those with limited speaking lines; I still felt as though I knew them inside and out.<br /><br />Many have noted that `American Gangster' brings nothing `new' to the table; that it adds nothing to the crime genre but that isn't necessarily a bad thing.  `American Gangster' may, in the sense of plot formula, add nothing new but it does take that `same old same' and add layers of class.  `American Gangster' feels so genuine; it feels so realistic, gritty and raw that you feel as though you are walking the streets with drug kingpin Frank Lucas.  The wardrobe (I feel weird calling them costumes), the music, the buildings; even the way the actors walk all bring to life the time in which the film takes place.  Everything is spot on authentic and genuinely engaging.<br /><br />I feel a need to defend this film because so many have attacked it for the buzz and accolades that it has garnered.  Many feel pressured to compare this to last year's megastar `The Departed' and this serves as a disservice to `American Gangster' because it substitutes to glitter and Hollywood glam of `The Departed' for grit.  `American Gangster' feels like an older film.  This is a positive in my book but some have turned this into a negative.  The other problem many have with `American Gangster' is that it didn't prove to be `Training Day Part II' as many had hoped it would be.  Denzel Washington does not reenact his Oscar Winning role here but is much more subtle and reserved.  I have my reservations about his performance which I will get to in a minute but in my defense of this I will say that Frank Lucas is not Alonzo and it's unfair to expect him to be.  Neither of these complaints carries much weight with me for they take nothing away from the film in general.<br /><br />`American Gangster', as many are probably privy to already, follows drug lord Frank Lucas' rise to infamy in the Harlem underworld.  It also tracks his pursuit by Detective Richie Roberts.  It almost plays as two films, two companion pieces.  We have Frank Lucas building his drug empire, amassing great wealth and prestige and then we have Richie Roberts falling out among his peers and losing his family life but retaining his conscience as he works to incarcerate Lucas.  Lucas and Roberts have their own sets of demons but they share some enemies, namely the crooked cops that permeate the area.<br /><br />The cast is extensive and for the most part marvelous.  Josh Brolin sizzles as crooked Detective Trupo.  I've been a fan of Brolin's for a while and I am so happy that this year he was given the opportunity to embrace his acting talents and take off so-to-speak.  Ejiofor also delivers a great performance as Lucas' brother Huey.  He's sorely underused but what he contributes is memorable.  In fact his few scenes had me wishing he would have been cast as Frank instead of Washington, but I'll get to that in a minute.  RZA, Common and T.I. take a break from rapping to act and all do well.  Cameo performances like that from Cuba Gooding Jr. and the sensational Ruby Dee are also captivating.  I was wondering what happened to Cuba and I was glad to see him embrace his few moments of screen time to give us a memorable cameo, but it was Ruby Dee who delivered one of the most powerful performances in the film.  I don't even think you can call what she did acting.  The way she let her hands grab her knees in excitement or the way she trembled in frustration you felt her emotions so purely, so naturally.<br /><br />But this movie of course has two bigger stars battling it out for your attention; Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe.  Well, to be completely honest, and I say this with no bias, Russell Crowe is the champ here.  Denzel just doesn't grasp who this man is.  Yes, Lucas was a man that believed in a low key profile, a man who stayed purposely out of the limelight so as not to attract the kind of attention you don't want but Denzel takes this too an extreme he didn't need to take it.  He never let his charisma shine.  In some of his final scenes alongside Crowe (in the interrogation room for instance) we get a glimpse of the sarcastic and confident side of Lucas and it made me angry that Washington waited until the very end to show us what he could have done all along.  He has his moments (mostly with regard to his brothers) where he dominates his character and delivers beautiful scenes but for the most part he was kind of boring.  Crowe on the other hand masterfully got inside Richie to flesh out his demons and his admirable qualities and always did so with charm and in a manor that drew you to him.  You wanted to watch him.  Crowe had such a knockout year with this and `3:10 to Yuma' under his belt that it makes his Oscar snub so undeniably heartbreaking.  Crowe's ability to lose himself inside his characters is one of the many things I love about him.<br /><br />In the end I feel that `American Gangster' is a very strong film, a film that stands on its own merits and delivers beautifully.  Is it the best film out this year?  No, but it's far from the worst.  In fact it's a very solid film that manages to engage it's audience and deliver thrills, chills and that feeling of satisfaction we receive when we watch something that truly entertains.  This feeling is all thanks to the marvelous Ridley Scott who just adds yet another mastered genre to his resume.  Scott is probably one of our greatest American Directors working today.  He's taken genre after genre (unlike some who never leave their comfort zone) and delivered consistently solid work.  From swords and sandals epics to war films to sci-fi horror films to cross country dramas to the gangster film Scott has stamped his signature mark on modern cinema with flair and perfection.  Please, someone, give him his Oscar.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>This viewer rented the DVD form of AMERICAN GANGSTER, having passed it by in the theatrical run, thinking that it was yet another 'crime and corruption in New York' genre film.  It was surprising to discover that this very long film (just under three hours in the Unrated version) is completely riveting and in a way far different than the usual gangster film: this story, based on real people as outlined in an article by Mark Jacobson (transformed for the screen by Steven Zaillian), and while it has its share of grisly killings, it seems more concerned with the issues of integrity in the face of police corruption as embodied in the character of Richie Roberts, the etiology of the heroin use escalation following the Vietnam War, and the presence of a 'Black Mafia' lead by one Frank Lucas.  It is delivered with compelling gusto and intelligence by director Ridley Scott and has some of the best acting of the year.  In other words, this is not a film to be lightly dismissed as a Hollywood retread, but instead it is a tense drama with many very fine points.<br /><br />Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington) follows the footsteps of his idol Bumpy (Clarence Williams III) who 'ran' the Harlem streets, and when Bumpy dies, Lucas inherits his mantle.  Lucas is wise, cunning, a gentleman, a powerhouse of ideas, and quickly finds a way to bring the best uncut heroin from the Far East to the streets of New York at a price that undercuts the other mobsters' product.  To establish his control he enlists his family, including his brother Huey (Chiwetel Ejiofor), and rapidly becomes the kingpin of the streets.<br /><br />Simultaneously within the NYPD we meet Detective Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe) whose personal life is a mess but who, with his partner Lou (Ted Levine) discovers corruption in the NYPD and more particularly the Drug Enforcement sector of the police: Detective Trupo (Josh Brolin) works with the existing drug lords, grabs their drugs and money and then recycles both to his benefit.  During a particular drug bust, Richie and Lou discover a stash of nearly a million dollars and turn the money into the police - a deed that makes the duo seem foolish and lose the respect of their fellow cops but establishes Roberts as a man who is committed to being a good detective.<br /><br />From these two separate studies the film weaves the development of each character and the interaction between Roberts and Lucas we know will take place.  The end result may be known to those who followed the story as it developed in the 1970s, but for those for whom this true story is new information, the resolution of the film is fast-paced, thrilling, illuminating, and just plain fine cinema.  Both Washington and Crowe  are in peak form, as are those in the many small roles (Ruby Dee, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Josh Brolin, Lymari Nadal, Carla Gugino, Cuba Gooding etc).  This is more of a drama than an action film and while many may feel the final moments of the movie are weak, they do reveal the true ending of the story and say a lot about the narrow line between crime and criminal investigation. This is one of Ridley Scott's most successful films and one that will be around for many years as a model for the medium.  Grady Harp, February 08</p></br><a href="../users/A1J03J0HZ7KU5T.html">A1J03J0HZ7KU5T</a><br/><p>There's little new in director Ridley Scott's "American Gangster." However, the emphasis on characterization over violent action is refreshing. Denzel Washington gives a compelling performance as real-life Harlem drug lord Frank Lucas, with Russell Crowe equally impressive as New Jersey detective Richie Roberts - the man determined to bring down Lucas' heroin empire. An excellent supporting cast features standout portrayals by Josh Brolin and Oscar-nominated Ruby Dee. Regardless of the predictable outcome, Scott manages to keep the pot boiling for 157 minutes. "American Gangster" does not rank with the classic crime epics, but remains a solid achievement.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZOF747O5EB6R.html">A1ZOF747O5EB6R</a><br/><p>"American Gangster" is a powerful film.  The cast is exemplary and wonderfully led by Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe.  It has been apparently overlooked for Oscar nominations and this is both a surprise and a mistake.<br /><br />The film is set in the late sixties and early seventies and covers police corruption in the exercise of drug enforcement in the New York City area.  The apex of this corruption is Frank Lucas, as played by Denzel Washington, who is a smooth but thoroughly brutal importer of heroin directly from the golden triangle.  He distributes favours and skilfully supports a web of personnel based mainly in Harlem.  He manages to largely slide under the radar until he is spotted in ring side seats at the Ali versus Frazier fight in Madison Square Garden.  How is this "no one" able to have such a seat?  Who is he?  It is at this point that his world begins to unravel.<br /><br />The forces for law are led by Richie Roberts, played by Russell Crowe, who is an apparently incorruptible cop based in New Jersey.  He is relentless in his pursuit of Lucas even though this has personal consequences.  In the end, he gets his man.  He also manages to implicate a vast swathe of his fellow law enforcers.  Lucas's network extends far and deep.<br /><br />I found this film to be absolutely enthralling.  It moves languidly until interspersed and confronting violence drags the viewer's attention back to the forces at work.  Washington and Crowe are great in their roles.  The support cast is commendable and the soundtrack is powerful as it evokes images of the late sixties and the era of Vietnam against which backdrop the film evolves.  I can thoroughly recommend this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2INL3AYAT6325.html">A2INL3AYAT6325</a><br/><p>I was looking forward to seeing this film.<br /><br />I was not disappointed.<br /><br />Russell (the reason I bought this DVD package) was great.

Does the mix sound right? Oh...how unoriginal. I wish I knew that the movie was going to be nearly three hours long before I rented the flick. Had I knew, I wouldn't have been interested in seeing the movie until five years later. The fact that Ridley Scott directed the film makes it all worse. At least I was hoping for a good Denzel Washington performance. Nope...I didn't get that. All he did was look and walk around. Or in other words, Denzel was Denzel. The story was all derivative and completely uninteresting, as if the plot was done million times over. So, what else new can be offered through American Gangster? Pretty much...nothing. Josh Brolin does his best to look like Razor Ramon. In a particular scene, I thought one guy looked extremely familiar until I figured it out that this cop was the serial killer from Silence of the Lambs. Mighty interesting, is it? Every time a subplot develops, it gets discarded right away. Say for an example, Cuba Gooding's character disrespects the black don loser, so as a follow-through, I was expecting the black don loser to give him a b***h slap, pour kerosene on his body, light him on fire, and shoot him about hundred of times just to make sure he feels it. Of course, the director felt it unimportant and moved on. It's hard for me to think of suggestions to improve American Gangster, but it's a lot easier to say that the movie shouldn't have been made in the first place since it glorifies the black don loser as a Jesus Christ figure or perhaps simply as noble as Denzel Washington. At the same time, I am not forgetting that this loser killed thousands of people, white or of his color, through his "brand name." In short, American Gangster is boring, uninteresting, too long, and a huge waste of time. Wondering that I didn't make a mention of Russell Crowe yet? He sucks, that's why.</p></br><a href="../users/AER15RIMV8E6D.html">AER15RIMV8E6D</a><br/><p>I thought it started off really slow and thought it would never pick up. Finally, later it did.

The acting was pretty good, but I'm not a fan of either Denzel or Russel Crow.  That's not saying they are "bad" actors, I'm just "not a fan"!  I thought the movie became hokey during certain parts, like when Denzel walks out of the church when he finds out they're on to him, and "Amazing Grace" is being sung by the choir in the background.  Hollywood seems to overuse the beautiful hym in alot of films, and it's becoming corny, like, oh no something traumatic happened, cue "Amazing Grace".  Use something original to evoke emotion, instead of relying on the easy way out.  They also used "110th Street" in the film, which was used in Jackie Brown!  It's like whoa, it's too soon to use that cool song in a movie again.  Blatant.  My favourite parts of American gangster were the scenes with Ruby Dee.  (All 2 of them).  For them to nominate her for this role is bizarre.  Ruby Dee was so much better in "Jungle Fever".  Her character was similar to the one in this movie but it was much more dynamic in Jungle Fever.  Why didn't they nominate her for that role, huh????  Oh yeah, it's a Spike Lee movie, I forgot.  Ruby Dee also had a much better role in "The Stand".  She is just a fantastic actress. And that's the good part, now for more bad...  The end of the film seemed a bit rushed and just didn't end on a good note.  It sort of made the whole movie collapse on itself. This is good for a one time viewing, the story was interesting, but been done before in a lot of other films.</p></br><a href="../users/AK0CENM3LUM28.html">AK0CENM3LUM28</a><br/><p>American Gangster (Blu-Ray) / B001EIOOVS<br /><br />*Spoilers*<br /><br />This is a fascinating movie, something akin to the Godfather series, but with a serious and critical look at police misconduct. I cannot say with any authority how accurate this movie is, in comparison with the actual history, but the drama here is fantastic and worth taking in.<br /><br />American Gangster is the story of a poor Harlem black man who takes over the business and leadership of the area's most influential and recently deceased small-time crime lord, and builds a drug empire with his own two hands. Drugs are shipped in directly from Vietnam, via military planes, and are flooded onto the streets at high purities and low prices. And in the midst of all this, corrupt police simultaneously threaten and protect the drug dealers, working the system to milk it for all it is worth.<br /><br />There are several things I like about this movie, several points that undermine popular Hollywood conventions. Frank Lucas is not presented as an oppressed angel, nor as a lionized dark hero. He is a character with control and caution, but this control is not deemed as a virtue, and it is made clear than violence simmers under the surface, when he attacks employees and family members who have foolishly failed to adopt his careful control. And Richie Roberts, our intrepid detective, is presented  carefully, with plenty of flaws. Rather than use his numerous affairs to build up his character as a 'real' man, it is made clear that he is a somewhat shallow human being, who cares more about winning than about his son, and who does not cut off contacts with known criminals who are old friends.<br /><br />I appreciate that this movie is careful to show the casualties of the drug empire built by Frank Lucas. Unlike The Godfather (which I am fond of, make no mistake), where you rarely remember (or care) what the family is selling, you never forget that Lucas is selling hard drugs. And no matter where you stand on legalization, you recognize that flooding a market used to 5% purity with a product that is nearly 100% purity, and without warning, is going to result in some pretty gruesome overdoses. And it does.<br /><br />In the end, though, what I like most about this movie is that Roberts isn't just interested in the drug dealers - he wants the crooked cops, too. He recognizes that crooked cops are a danger to society and a smirch on his own standing as a cop, and he works within the system to improve the system. And that is something we need more of, both in real life and from Hollywood.<br /><br />This version provides a closed caption option for the hard of hearing. I do not own this movie - I rented this through my Blockbuster Online account. I enjoy the movie immensely and am considering purchasing a copy for my home library.</p></br><a href="../users/AP3B615GM191G.html">AP3B615GM191G</a><br/><p>If one were to focus strictly on plot/story when evaluating this film, it would easily receive five stars.  Whether it be the U.S. military flying drugs out of Asia, the corruption of U.S. cops, or the almost surreal life of mobster Frank Lucas, all those real-life accounts are riveting, making one question how such things could possibly happen in our great country.<br /><br />Yet, as portrayed in this film, those stories became quite overextended or overblown, as a result making this film seem like a documentary instead of real life-inspired drama.  True, I did watch the Extended Edition, but I am confident that the 18-minute less Theatrical Edition would have improved things only slightly.  The film moves along at a snails pace, which while probably necessary in order to portray all the complex emotions of the movie, still may make the viewer feel as though this is a marathon viewing.<br /><br />Also, the acting in this film is pretty toned down as well.  I'm not sure if this was because that was just what the real-life people were like, but either way it was underwhelming.  The cool, intense Denzel Washington only comes out in glimpses, which is a shame in a movie that features so much of him.  Only Russell Crowe's character shows great character development, and even that is not up to the standards of most dramas.<br /><br />To conclude, then, this film was likely the best it possibly could have been...but still doesn't translate into compelling drama.  The complex drug storyline is very interesting, but the movie's extremely long run time and mellow acting will often make you feel as if you have been watching forever.</p></br><a href="../users/A126KX6FVI4T66.html">A126KX6FVI4T66</a><br/><p>Bumpy was the gangster in Harlem in Shaft's 1970's black-exploitation<br />films. Denzel Washington just isn't a Richard Roundtree: he does a better<br />Othello than a gangster. The poor honest cop stick is way over done too.<br />This era was a dirty one that hasn't really yet come clean.<br />More or less, you take one dealer down two volunteer in his place and fight over it... I kind of think the sexy Shaft was more honest than this<br />apology after the fact for a really dirty dog eat dog era in New York.</p></br><a href="../users/A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ.html">A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ</a><br/><p>Rags to riches, it's the American dream. All too often in the movies, however, this dream is accomplished through crime. That's the story for Harlem gangster Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington), who has no problem selling drugs and/or murdering people to get to the top.<br /><br />Lucas is mentored by Harlem crime boss Ellsworth "Bumpy" Johnson in the late 60s. He learns everything from Bumpy, the ins and outs of the business. When Bumpy dies of a heart attack, the city is wide open and waiting for the next person to take over. As Johnson's heir of sorts, Lucas feels it's his duty to collect on past debts and keep the neighborhood status quo. To do this, Lucas turns to selling heroin.<br /><br />With the assistance of his brother in Vietnam, Lucas manages to import 100% pure product, something with which even the slightest dosage a person becomes addicted. In no time at all he has the market cornered with his product, "Blue Magic", and he is a millionaire with street-cred, and some serious clout.<br /><br />His rise to fortune comes with unwanted fame and trouble, however. He has trouble from other local drug dealers, from corrupt cops looking for a bribe, and from legit cops looking for a bust. Lucas realizes the eventual burden and responsibility; so, he calls on his family members to work for him and do the majority of the actual crime. When this becomes too profitable, and when a death occurs at the hands of "Blue Magic", he attracts the attention of Det. Richie Roberts (Crowe), a gum-chomping, do-gooder, workaholic whose only mission in life is to catch criminals.<br /><br />Just as in "Training Day", Denzel Washington is mesmerizing, commanding attention as a person who seems to have no limits and no conscience. His evil side, or at least a character capable of evil as in "Man on Fire", is fascinating, a truly marks Washington as one of Hollywood's elite. In this movie, he does not disappoint. Likewise, Russell Crowe nails his role as Richie Roberts. The mannerisms, the speech, the ragged nature, all exude the exact feel and look of the character he's portraying. What's disappointing, however, is that there is no epic meeting of the stars like when DeNiro and Pacino met in the diner in "Heat". They barely share the screen, and the viewer is left wondering what could have happened if they locked horns in a truly important and powerful scene.<br /><br />Another knock on the movie is its length: a whopping 2 hrs 37 min. It wouldn't have been bad if there were more action, but that just isn't the case. Aside from three or four real action scenes, the movie is boringly slow at times, and drags in others. It's wonderful story telling, but j u s t a l I t t l e s l o w. As a connoisseur of gangster movies, I expected much more in the actual "committing crimes"-department, even if slightly insignificant, in only to keep blood pumping.<br /><br />Nevertheless, American Gangster is a worthwhile movie. The drama and storyline alone are worth the price of admission. To see two heavyweights like Washington and Crowe square off makes it all that much more enjoyable.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>American Gangster arrived on my doorstep back at the very beginning of March. So here I am approximately 3 months later finally writing my silly little review about it. Why? Why did it take me 3 months to get to a movie that was by some so highly praised?<br /><br />Why did I view movies like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015XHP2W">Rambo</a> which was good, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018QCXGY">Cloverfield</a> which was good, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00147F8Z0">Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem</a> which was bad the day they arrived at my house from Amazon, only to wait 90 days to watch American Gangster? NO, not because I'm adolescent minded! It's the time....Almost 3 hours for the Unrated/Extended Edition of American Gangster required some time-dedication.<br /><br />Look, Ridley Scott is a great director, but sometimes I think Hollywood can get a little self-indulgent with the time they take to tell a story. I mean too many movies these days are well over 2 hours. There better be something really compelling to get people to sit for 3 hours, and as I suspected, Amercan Gangster was good, but it didn't need to be 3 hours long.<br /><br />The story in American Gangster was simple enough: it depicted the life a Frank Lucas played by the always fun to watch Denzel Washington from his rise to power to his inevitable fall. And I say "depicted" as opposed to "documented" because there are disputes as to whether Lucas was actually "the boss" of the Blue Magic empire or if it was really Zach Walker (according to gangster Bumpy Johnson's widow) or if it was really gangster Nicky Barnes (according to some NY area Bronx locals). Walker didn't even get a mention in American Gangster and Barnes (played by Cuba Gooding Jr.) had only a brief appearance.<br /><br />The action in American Gangster was few and far between, but the story was very well told. However, most of the movie was forgettable. I already remember less about American Gangster than I do about Rambo or Cloverfield. As for Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem?....Let's just say that it would be nice if Ridley Scott got back into the Alien franchise and revived what the last two Alien/Predator directors killed.</p></br><a href="../users/A2582KMXLK2P06.html">A2582KMXLK2P06</a><br/><p>I didn't find a whole lot to like about this movie to be completely honest. American Gangster had a pace that was only sometimes interesting probably because there wasn't enough action segments to keep me satisfied- just spoken bits that were never really memorable, and every time Russell Crowe spoke in his character role the quality of the storytelling felt like it slipped a little.  It's like the movie kept tricking you into thinking it would become more interesting with every new segment but never delivered.<br /><br />I realize most people who've watched American Gangster really respect it, but I can't bring myself to call this film a classic or anything- just barely good enough to keep a story flowing, and nothing more.</p></br><a href="../users/AD0J5KK4WQXNS.html">AD0J5KK4WQXNS</a><br/><p>Scott's latest foray is about the coming to power of the black mafia in America and how it effectively put the Italian mafia into their lap because they could smuggle cheap and high grade herion out of Vietnam during the war.<br /><br />Denzil Washington plays, Frank Lucas, the gangster who made it all happen. Russell Crowe is Det. Richie Roberts a Jewish straight cop whose honesty makes his department look bad. Roberts is assigned to bust drug barons while Lucas remains low-profile and takes control of Manhattan block by block.<br /><br />As far as gangster movies go this is no Scorsese, however it is a very good drama and there is a substantial twist in the end that makes it worth while. One could hope that there would have been more screen time between Lucas and Crowe (they only meet in the last few minutes) but even apart they still hold their own. This isn't just a story about the rise and fall of the black mafia though. There is something else lurking in the background but that really is the ace card that is lurking up Scott's sleeve. By all means do watch American Gangsters but don't expect too much and you may well be watching one of the best dramas of 2008.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NKFB39AIEN8W.html">A3NKFB39AIEN8W</a><br/><p>On another film I reviewed on Amazon, I said that I only follow directors and not actors. Here, I'll make two strong exceptions. But, first let me digress a moment to applaud Mr. Scott for yet another great film. There are directors who I look upon as the infrastructure--the superhighways--on today's movie landscape. Spielberg, Cameron, Scorsese, Scott (Tony), Lynne, Tarantino, Greengrass, Nolan, Greenaway, Tykwer, Verhoeven, Noe, Amoldavar, Jackson, Inarritu, Anno, Lee--when I see these names attached to any movie, I automatically know that the movie's going to at least be decent, if not, damn good. If Hollywood had a Mount Rushmore, Ridley Scott's image--and those of his contemporaries--should be deeply etched one stratum below the immortal images of Hitcock, Fellini, Bergman, Lang, Coppola, Powell, Kubrick, Kurosawa, etc. From BladeRunner, to Alien, to Gladiator, and now American Gangster, Ridley Scott's canon of films are among the best films ever.<br /><br />Now, to my two exceptions: First, Denzel Washington. The man ages like wine. Like DeNiro or Clint Eastwood, Washington is a ticket pull all by himself. His presence and machismo overpowers the screen. He makes a bad movie watchable. In fact, I can't recall the last bad movie he starred in, which speaks a lot of his intelligence in selecting quality scripts.<br /><br />Secondly, there's Russell Crowe. Like Denzel, Russell Crowe is a man's man in every role he plays, whether he's playing good-guy or bad-guy it doesn't matter. He proves that the leading man doesn't have to be Brad-Pitt-pretty-boy to be a Hollywood leading man. Russell's got the kind of durable rugged looks and powerful rottweiler build you're likely to see on some guy in the middle of the road driving a jackhammer through the pavement. Or the kind of guy you'd envision out on probation--the kind of guy you wouldn't want to see at night in a dark alley. Like Denzel, Russell can carry a movie on his back, and also like Denzel, Russell knows how to select quality scripts.<br /><br />American Gangster is the story of Frank Lucas and his rise to the pinnacle of Harlem's organized crime world. Under the tutelage of his ailing mentor, Ellsworth Bumpy Johnson, Frank Lucas foresees the end of the old model of organized crime based on middlemen, exaggerated profits, and diluted product. Young Lucas is Johnson's personal driver and sole prot&eacute;g&eacute;. Following Johnson's death, Harlem's drug scene washes into a violent free-for-all with up and comers battling to succeed Bumpy as Harlem's kingpin. Meanwhile, Frank Lucas is aloof. Even before Bumpy's death, Frank had been quietly formulating his own schemes for life and crime AFTER ol' Bump, who'd constantly lament about the good old days of customer service, middlemen, and respect among thieves. Bumpy's death frees Frank to do business a different way.<br /><br />He disrupts the monopoly of the New York Italian Mafia. Frank personally flies to Asia and establishes a direct link to smuggle heroin into the U.S.  He enlists a distant cousin, U.S. Army sergeant Leslie "Ike" Atkinson, to transport his dope into the U.S. inside the coffins of dead soldiers. With no middlemen, Frank's dope, called Blue Magic, is 100% pure on the streets of Harlem. Frank organizes his immediate family and cousins in ancillary posts--or fronts--throughout his drug network, from processing, measuring, and packaging, to receiving and distribution. Because Frank carries himself conservative and low-key, he's able to avoid the cops.<br /><br />Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe) is a persistent New Jersey Cop determined to find out who's taken over Bumpy's turf. For a while, Frank is invisible. Then, one night he makes a big mistake. He shows up at an Ali fight in full regalia, draped from head to toe in mink and chinchilla, and festooned in diamonds and gold. He's shaking hands with the movie stars, the boxers, and the Mafia figures. Richie Roberts spies all of this from a distance through his binoculars--now the cops know who has taken over Bumpy's turf.<br /><br />Richie, however, has his own problems; he's a poor and honest cop. Discovering almost one-million dollars in the trunk of a car, Richie does the wrong thing and turns in the money without divvying it up with the force. His wife is leaving him because he makes peanuts as an honest cop.<br /><br />Both Richie and Frank are opposite sides of a coin: want of money disrupts Richie's life; wealth is not enough to prevent Frank's marriage and family from disintegrating. Richie's on the right side of the law, and Frank's on the wrong side of the law. Both lose everything.<br /><br />From the music, the sets, the cars, and the costumes, American Gangster is solid entertainment all the way.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>Though it languished in development-hell for some time, American Gangster has finally seen the light of day, with none other than visionary director Ridley Scott (Gladiator, Alien, Blade Runner) at the helm.  Oscar winning mega-stars Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe are the prime drawing point of the film, and both actors chew every bit of scenery that they can during the film's duration.  Washington is Frank Lucas, the newly christened drug kingpin of Harlem after taking the reigns from legendary gangster Bumpy Johnson (Clarence Williams III), and soon finds himself hounded by crooked cops, rival dealers, and honest cop Richie Roberts (Crowe).  Though it really doesn't offer anything we haven't seen before in the gangster epic genre, American Gangster is still a rousing and worthwhile crime epic that is carried by the power of its stars and director.  The action and set pieces are well done, but the film as a whole doesn't come close to the greatness that it aspires to emulate from other classics in the genre like Serpico and The Untouchables.  Flaws aside though, American Gangster is still a more than admirable true crime drama, which can be evidenced even more so on the unrated extended cut, which is included here along with the theatrical release.  The extended cut features much more character development, which isn't a bad thing at all when the cast includes Chiwetel Eliofor, Josh Brolin, Cuba Gooding Jr, Ted Levine, Armand Assante, Deadwood's John Hawkes, rappers RZA and Common, and Ruby Dee in a brief Oscar nominated turn as Lucas' mother.  All in all, American Gangster is a very satisfying crime drama, and though it really isn't anything we haven't seen before, it's still definitely worth a look.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GHUN5HXMHZ89.html">A1GHUN5HXMHZ89</a><br/><p>The Black Godfather in a manner of speaking.

After a glut of mediocre movies, how satisfying to find an intelligent, superbly shot and edited movie that works on several levels, and telling a true story to boot.<br />Denzel Washington plays Frank Lucas, the Harlem drug lord who started as driver and general right hand man to the previous drug King of Harlem.  When his boss dies, Lucas brings a business ethic - capitalist thinking that any business school would be proud of, to the business.  Rebuilding the drug trade without relying on the middle men or the Mafia, and undercutting the competition, he created a brand name - a business success story as it were.  He uses a sound business model to beat the previously untoppled opposition.  If he is presented as a superb businessman, we also see him as a violent man, almost a thug, when `necessary'.  Make no mistake - this is not a film about action scenes, but where there is violence (and that means from the very first scene) it is stark and brutal., and not for the fainthearted.<br />Russell Crowe on the other hand plays a cop - and in 70's Harlem, a real oddity - he's an honest cop, a man of integrity in his job.  Being an honest cop means he is the only one in a position to head up a new task force, hand picked by Crowe, to make major arrests to stem the drug flow into the city - and he sets his sights on Lucas' organisation.<br />What's fascinating about the movie is the comparison of the two men.  In the same way `Heat' had flawed characters that refused to be stereotyped into pure good and pure bad, we equally have realistic characters here that make you uncomfortable.  We admire Lucas's business acumen and honesty in his relationship, and find ourselves trying to excuse his bursts of violence.  And on the other hand we admire the integrity of Crowe's cop, handing in a million bucks to do `the right thing', and ultimately confronting corruption in the cops (as exemplified in Josh Brolin's caharacter) even when it means alienating himself from his colleagues... and yet at the same time his marriage is a mess as he is a serial adulterer.. so is he a man if integrity when he can't bring the same uprightness into his marriage..?  His wife feels the very pain as a victim of dishonesty of her husband at home, that he seeks so hard to stamp out at work.  It's a fascinating character study that refuses to airbrush out flaws, but those very same dichotomies in the individuals make the ending so much more understandable, and indeed, plausible.<br />Beyond these two, there are very few niggling problems - the wives are not well written and although important in the men's lives we never get a feel of what really makes them tick.  The length may put some people off - but I watched the extended version, which was 2 hours 38 minutes, and it flew past for me.<br />The highlight of the movie is probably the moment, as in Heat, when the two men meet and have their head to head.  The d&eacute;nouement turns out not to be a Scarface orgy of violence, but something quite unexpected (unless you know the story already).<br />This movie passed me by at the cinema for some reason, and what a shame.  For this is intelligent moviemaking for adults, multilayered fare to stimulate discussion and thought.  It's not an easy watch - the violence is sudden, strong and senseless, there is nudity, sex and violence, and the characters are not cuddly white hat and dark hat ciphers.  Instead we have a morally murky movie that actually tells a layered story, a story examining both character and capitalism .  It's a `<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0017HRJ04">Heat [Blu-ray</a>]'-like period meld of `<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006JU7T">Serpico (Widescreen Edition)</a>' and a Harlem `<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018CMJSU">The Godfather - The Coppola Restoration Giftset DVD</a>', depending whose viewpoint you favour in the movie, and a welcome intelligent addition to the period crime genre.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R8PXSFGY9MC2.html">A3R8PXSFGY9MC2</a><br/><p>Based on a true story 'American Gangster' takes us on another gangster style journey, but made refreshing as not based around the Mob or Italian stereotypes. As other reviewers here have noted, this film stands out by the great performances of both Washington and Crowe and they both add depth and flair to their respective roles. I was hooked in the first ten minutes and although Washington plays a flawed character, you can't help but like him. Excellently directed and with great supporting actors as well, this film managed to hold my attention for the duration. If you like crime and gangster films then this rates pretty highly and is well worth a look and even if you're not a fan of these films this has enough on offer to appeal to everyone else as well. A solid four star film.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></br><a href="../users/A2WSI8HOWHFDOT.html">A2WSI8HOWHFDOT</a><br/><p>For the longest time, it has been argued that "The Godfather" (from the book and movie of the same title) is not about Vito Corleone but about Michael Corleone because it is about his ascent/descent into the underworld. And, at the very end, he is the godfather to Connie's son while his rivals are being executed. In the same respect, I had to wonder about who the real gangster is here: Frank Lucas (Washington) or Special Detective Truppo (Brolin). While we do watch Lucas' burgeoning success as a drug dealer, it is Truppo who acts with the viciousness of a gangster. He and his flock of black-jacketed, vulture-like crooked cops are more terrifying and brazen than Lucas. Lucas acts with compassion at times--even while burning an enemy alive in the opening sequence, he mercifully blasts him away before the flames can prolong his agony. In fact, any time he resorts to violence seems forced. Truppo has no compunction about saying things like "Maybe next time I throw you and your brother in the river." In fact Truppo is a nemesis to both Lucas and Officer Roberts (Crowe). His malevolence is everywhere.<br /><br />Then, like "The French Connection" it is about the complex world of drug-trafficking and the frustrations of law enforcement to understand it--especially in the wild and wooly days of the late-60s to late-70s. Crowe does an exceptional job of expressing this frustration and confusion (he cannot believe that a Black man could do what the Italian Mafia could not--monopolize the drug trade in all five boroughs and then the outer counties, including New Jersey). To make matters worse, Roberts has to contend with the corruption in his own department.<br /><br />All this makes for a dark but engrossing film that leaves you impressed with director Scott's ability to recreate a world that has vanished a few decades ago, at least in appearance.<br /><br />So why not a perfect score? Two things: First, the prolonged scenes concerning Roberts' divorce are way too distracting. While I love looking at Carla Gugino, her thankless role in thankless scenes detract from the film's pacing. Second, the second disc--with its self-congratulatory nods to the costume designers, set designers, fried egg designers--really aren't worth watching. The only thing on that disc worth watching is the discussion between the real Frank Lucas and the real Richie Roberts. And even that discussion is marginally interesting. Still, this is a set worth owning.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>This film is not particularly interesting as for the story which is that of a gangster who is captured by the police along with thirty members of his family, and decides to help the police corner the whole drug dealing system in New York, and particularly the rotten cops who are getting some kickback money for closing their eyes. It is not either the case of a clean cop who arrests all those gangsters and then turns lawyer and takes as his first client the fink of a gangster he arrested first and has his prison term reduced to 17 years instead of 70. The real point here is that this gangster is black. He becomes the dominant drug dealer in New York in the early 70s. He uses direct buying in Vietnam during the last war years and has that drug flown to him in military cargo planes, the last time in the coffins of dead soldiers. The only interesting thing here is the fact that he is black and no one can believe that famous gangster who no one knows can be black in New York, in spite of the ethnic and racial cleansing practiced by the mafia. But the film proves nothing, except that those who are anti-black racists are also anti-jew racists. Anti-Semitism goes along with racial racism. But that is nothing new under the sun. The film is well done and shows cruelly well how a cop from New Jersey has better not come and hunt on the land of the police of New York, on the other side of the Brooklyn Bridge, or whatever. But that still does not make it a great film. A good film indeed but flat as for the plot.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGID</p></br><a href="../users/A11PTCZ2FM2547.html">A11PTCZ2FM2547</a><br/><p>The former bodyguard of a Harlem mobster decides he wants to corner the heroin market in New York City.  He not only wants to corner it, he wants to sell Grade A pure dope by cutting out the middleman and getting his supply direct from where it is made:  in the jungles of Southeast Asia.  So he goes to Vietnam himself (during the height of the Vietnam War) to establish his contacts, then smuggles the heroin into the country via military cargo planes.  His dope becomes such a runaway success he quickly becomes the biggest underground kingpin in New York--a mobster who effectively eludes the clutches of the city's corrupt police force, which wants in on the action--and the target of a 24/7 investigation by a handful of honest police officers.<br /><br />Such a story, if fictitious, would defy believability; but truth is indeed stranger than fiction.  Based on the true story of Harlem drug lord Frank Lucas, director Ridley Scott's AMERICAN GANGSTER is an outstanding depiction of the gritty, violent underworld, set in the turbulent Seventies.  Scott doesn't just film a scene; he presents a powerful visual that makes the viewer flinch.  From smoke-filled bars in Saigon to filthy Harlem tenements, Scott tells this gripping story through impressive, thought-provoking cinematography.<br /><br />Equally impressive is the cast, headlined by Denzel Washington as Frank Lucas, and Russell Crowe as New Jersey detective Richie Roberts.  Both actors are superb:  Washington as the brooding, sometimes sinister gangster; Crowe as the honest cop with several vices of his own.  Both roles are on an inevitable collision course; yet when this collision ultimately occurs, it's anticlimactic and almost glossed over, which was my only disappointment with this most remarkable film.  I was also impressed with Josh Brolin, the ringleader of the corrupt New York detectives on the take.<br /><br />Packed with action, drama, suspense, and intrigue, AMERICAN GANGSTER brings a difficult story to uneasy life, and shows that Scott plus Washington plus Crowe are a winning combination indeed.<br />--D.

How many bad movies do you see with either of those guys starring in them? Not many, and neither actor disappoints here. Both play fascinating guys, Washington, a big gangster ("Frank Lucas") and Crowe, an honest cop ("Richie Roberts")<br /><br />This movie reminded me a lot of the '83 "Scarface" film in which Tony Montana (Al Pacino) rises from the bottom up to be a big drug lord, only to have things crumble big-time. We see a similar tale here with "Lucas," except that his fall is sudden in this stor.<br /><br />Director Ridley Scott and photographer Harris Savides also give us a slick- looking film, very pretty spots and stylishly-directed. The story wasn't quite as good as the "hype," but I was never bored despite the two- and-a-half-hour length of it. I was a bit confused in the first 25 minutes but things straightened out after that.<br /><br />It was entertaining enough for me that I'd watch it again.</p></br><a href="../users/AUM3YMZ0YRJE0.html">AUM3YMZ0YRJE0</a><br/><p>As I was warned that there is "nothing new" about this film, I was unsure if it was worth it.  To be sure, the story is pretty run-of-the-mill:  after a long apprenticeship with a Harlem manipulator, a young hustler figures out a new way to get pure heroin into the country.  He then runs it like a business, establishing a superior brand and building an empire.  Meanwhile, a cop focuses on him, and you can guess the rest.<br /><br />What made this a fabulous experience was the acting:  Washington is second to none in his ability to project an entire environment and background into every gesture.  Crowe is also superb as an honest, though troubled cop, who gets extraordinary powers to build a team and pursue him.  In between, you get a vivid (and thankfully not too detailed) picture of the times, from the Vietnam War to the changing role of blacks in US society.  Taken together, the film is a true gem, one of Scott's best in my opinion.<br /><br />Warmly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/AJRFZ0VZ0LD26.html">AJRFZ0VZ0LD26</a><br/><p>Film based on the real character, black gangster from NYC area who was distributing Blue Magic drug in late 60s and early 70s.  It is a story of a man driven to succeed in the only trade he knew, at any price.  He uses Italian Mafia tactics and employs his immediate family and cousins to help him with distribution.  The genius of his channel distribution is that he has arranged for drug delivery via MP transport between military bases on the US east coast and Vietnam where the war was fought.  As he pushes competition away with his superior products and takes away cut from the middle man that happens to be NYC Special Investigation Unit, he starts building enemies, slowly but surely.  The moral of the story is that this man, Frank Lucas, no matter how ruthless is the picture perfect of the American Dream.  He works hard, he is driven and dermined and has his goal.  He becomes someone that white people have to recon with.  But at the end, his empire is like a house of cards where he takes NYC police department, his family and himself down to the dungeons.  His wealth and success are not saving him from the justice system where he spends 15 years of his life before he can be free again.  Wonderful cast and a great story.  Many of the support actors are from HBOs shows like "Deadwood" and "Wire", they look worn out, raw and full of supressed anger - fantastic characters.  Great movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2JHHYYOOO4DS6.html">A2JHHYYOOO4DS6</a><br/><p>Hats off to the two leads as they did a splendid job of portraying what being a gangster means as well as the challenge it sets before the law. Who is really clean or who is really dirty? Can the dirty ever become clean or how far is the clean from becoming dirty?? Great job!!!</p></br></body></html>

One year after Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, now you may ask why that's so important, because steven spielberg thought that Temple of Doom was too violent. And asked that ratings board to come up with a rating between PG and R, thus PG-13 was born. Goonies is PG, I won't go through the plot since that's been done a thousand times. This was one of my favorite movies growing up as a child, and now that I'm married with a child on the way. I hope this movie becomes one of her favorites, who didn't dream of finding a pirate treasure map, following it. Going through all those traps, and finding the ship at the end, with all that gold. Priceless, considering it's directed by the same man who directed Superman The movie. Dick Donner himself, I would give this movie more stars if i could. Would I sit my two year old, or three old in front of it, no. But i would sit my seven year old in front of it. This is the perfect movie to watch on a rainy day, it gets the imagination going. I can say nothing but good things about this movie. Plus Lyle Alzado is in it as Sloth.</p></br><a href="../users/A1W702WG1LC6R3.html">A1W702WG1LC6R3</a><br/><p>Sean Astin and more star in Richard Donner's 1985 adventure film.<br />A kid and his friends find a map and search for a famous pirate's<br />treasure. I've always liked this film since I was a kid and it's nice<br />to have it on dvd. It has good picture and sound plus some neat<br />extras. I recommend this good 80's childhood adventure.</p></br><a href="../users/A2582KMXLK2P06.html">A2582KMXLK2P06</a><br/><p>It's incredibly hard to believe, but I seriously think a couple days ago was actually the very first time I ever watched the Goonies. Some of the scenes looked familiar like I'd seen bits and pieces of the film in the past, but I don't think I ever sat down and actually watched it the entire way through.  This is hard to believe considering I spent my entire childhood in the 80's.<br /><br />Well, for the most part it's a family/adventure type film involving a group of troublemaker kids around 10-years old and going on an enormous adventure.  It's funny whenever the kids think they're doing something they'll be grounded for, it's actually mild compared to things kids do in reality.<br /><br />As you can tell, adventure movies came a long way since the Goonies- just look at Harry Potter for example. Two completely different films perhaps, but both putting heavy emphasis on the adventurous aspect of the storytelling.<br /><br />Anyway, this movie aged somewhat well. You can definitely tell it was released in the mid 80's, and my goodness, Anne Ramsey is one of the scariest women of all time! I mean that as a compliment- she'd immediately scare *any* troublemaker child straight just by looking at them with that mean expression on her face!  I remember her fondly throughout the 80's- rest in peace.  A terrific actress she was.<br /><br />This is a pretty good film. I'm surprised it's popular enough to have received 500 reviews here on amazon, but I guess it's easy to see why- it's a fun flick.  Perhaps the Goonies is more important than I'm giving it credit for and it's considered either a perfect timepiece of the 80's, or I'm just underrating its overall popularity, or maybe it's a major influence on something.  Whatever the case, I'm glad I watched it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FMJJKSVQDDQ.html">A1FMJJKSVQDDQ</a><br/><p>Boy, THIS sure brings back a whole lot of memories. Flight of the Navigator, Milo & Otis, Casper, and now The Goonies are just some of the family films that I remember watching when I was a little kid. I sure had a good time watching them either alone or with the entire family. The Goonies  I particularly remember very well for the underground adventures, and the characters Chunk & Sloth. They make a great duo, don't they? The booby traps and the "keys" to the hidden treasure were a bit frightening back then, but now they're pretty imaginative. This, along with the other family films that I've mentioned above never gets tedious. Of course, they don't! We loved them when we were kids, and it's not such a bad thing when you're looking for some childhood nostalgia. Although I slightly prefer Milo & Otis and others, The Goonies is still a great one.</p></br><a href="../users/A2M5FI4CB6VUXF.html">A2M5FI4CB6VUXF</a><br/><p>This movie was little more than your typical 80's "Teen angst" movie, starring Sean Astin, Josh Brolin and (we hope) a sober and drug free Corey Feldman. A search for pirate treasure, a trio of bad guys who keep their deformed brother locked in a basement and an Indiana Jones-like trek through tunnels, caves and booby traps takes this from a campy 80's kid flick to an enjoyable Richard Donner film.<br /><br />I just watched it again this past weekend with my 9 year old. He sat wide-eyed at the tense parts, laughed his toosh off at the funny parts and raised a freaked out brow at the first sighting of Sloth...<br /><br />And when it was all over, he asked me a very simple question... "When's part two coming out?"<br /><br />I didn't know what to tell him. After 20 years, if they haven't made one by now, they're not likely to make one. "Chunk" at 35 just wouldn't be as funny.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M1NNDD95HR0R.html">A3M1NNDD95HR0R</a><br/><p>Even though this film was released in 1985, now, more than 20 years later, it is still highly entertaining.  You get at least a few moments with each character, develop a feel for them, and come to like them all.  You really want to see them succeed, and the suspense of whether they will or not is constant.  This movie is good for all ages, and is rated PG.  The Cyndi Lauper "The Goonies 'R' Good Enough" song was a nice touch.  Richard Donner and Steven Spielberg created a magical movie that will be enjoyed for years to come.</p></br><a href="../users/ASIA7V7CBSKD3.html">ASIA7V7CBSKD3</a><br/><p>What a Classic this movie is.  I have never met anyone who didn't absolutely love this movie.  With rememberable characters and classic one-liners, you will be watching and quoting this movie over and over again.  If your movies collection is 1000 DVDS or just one, you need to own this incredible movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MS6UV7ZGTMLR.html">A2MS6UV7ZGTMLR</a><br/><p>The Goonies.. What can I say? The Goonies was one of my all time favourite movies as a kid. It had everything - adventure, danger, treasure, cool gizmos, and bumbling bad guys. This, in my books, is the best kids adventure movie ever made. What's more, it is still great to watch as an adult - there are numerous gags that would just go straight over the heads of kids that now make so much more sense.<br /><br />The Goondocks, in Astoria, are being demolished to make way for a golf course and resort. A local bunch of kids, who have affectionately named themselves The Goonies, are not taking the news too kindly as this is their favourite place in the whole wide world. On a rainy day before the Goondocks were due to be demolished Mikey Walsh (Sean Astin), Brandon Walsh (Josh Brolin), Mouth (Corey Feldman), Chunk (Jeff Cohen), and Data (Johnathon Ke Quan) are bumming around the Walsh house feeling very depressed. On a whim they decide to go rummaging through the attic, out-of-bounds to all mind you, and 'stumble' across an ancient treasure map and doubloon depicting the whereabouts of One-Eyed Willie and his treasure.<br /><br />Needless to say The Goonies see this as a great adventure, not to mention a chance to pay off foreclosing banks! Along the way they get mixed up with the Fratellis, some of the most bumbling 'evil' criminals ever to grace the silver screen. Ma Fratelli (Anne Ramsey) is the matriach with a firm controlling hand on Jake (Robert Davi), and Francis (Joe Pantoliano). Boy, is Ma one scary lady! The Goonies also come across Andy (Kerri Green) and Stef (Martha Plimpton). These two join the swelling ranks of The Goonies and help wend their way through the caves and booby traps laid by One-Eyed Willie centuries ago.<br /><br />Throw into this movie mix the enigmatic, and gigantically huge, Sloth (John Matuszak), booby traps, high adventure, a blender, a few bats, an octopus (almost!), incredible treasure, a one-eyed pirate, falling boulders, the most amazing waterslide, a few skeletons, and a buccaneer fight aboard an ancient pirate sloop - what more do you want? This is a great movie that I am very pleased to have in my collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A36AH31X84FIC8.html">A36AH31X84FIC8</a><br/><p>i just  love the goonies it's a wonderful film and a childhood fav. i do have to say that warners should do a special edition of this classic film and restore the scenes that were cut from film. i saw a version of this film with the scenes in it and quite prefer that version over this one. don't get me wrong i love this film but it made far more sense with those scenes in the film then without. So Please Mr. Donner think about it, you already have done a special edition of your other films like Superman. So why not this Classic? it would'nt be much work to restore the scenes anyway. You could do a Special edition package with  both discs of both versions in it. just thought from a fan.<br /><br />P.S.  anyone else reading this if you get a chance to visit where the  Goonies were filmed it's a blast such a nice town too.  visit imdb  for the locations. Goonie Rock and Mikey's House are Awsome to see!<br /><br />Highly Recommended Film.<br /><br />Heyyyy-- You Guys!! a quote. i could'nt help myself.</p></br><a href="../users/A3P121GNV5QYIN.html">A3P121GNV5QYIN</a><br/><p>I was 4 years old when I saw this,I'm 21 now and could never tire of it.It was and still is one of the best movies of my childhood.And I still want that Purple Rain shirt(lol).We follow the adventures of Mikey,Brand,Mouth,Data,Stef,Andy and who could forget Chunk.NO ONE!!! It's one of Richard Donner's best films I think his first best will be and forever will be Superman.When I heard that this awesome classic was going to DVD,I ran out of the house to buy it,even though I did have it on video,DVD is way better.I wished they had more outtakes on it but I loved the DVD.But they have other cool stuff on the DVD,The making of the Goonies,Commmentary,The Goonies R Good Enough music video and theatrical trailer.Didn't we all want to move down to Astoria,Oregon after seeing this?I know I did,just so I could find that [great] waterslide.I hope like E.T.,that they bring back The Goonies to theaters for it's 20 anniversary,if they do,I'll be one happy kid to see my favourite kids movie in the theater for the first time.Have fun and remember for now and forever.THE GOONIES R GOOD ENOUGH!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A28MM46KI4EQB2.html">A28MM46KI4EQB2</a><br/><p>This is among my list of all time favorites, and I would have to say that overall this is a pretty awesome collector's set for fans of this movie...the board game and story boards and little magazines & whatnot are all pretty neat little collectables.  Glad to have this set in my collection.<br /><br />I think the only one little gripe I would have to say is that I was sort of expecting a better copy of the Blu-Ray in this sset...maybe some kind of limited edition casing and/or inserts or something.  However, that's a small deal and this set is still pretty awesome!  My wife and I play a lot of board games, and we'll probably enjoy playing the board game together.  I waited to get this for a while because, let's be real, $50 in my opinion is a bit much to spend on a single movie, even a cool set like this.  However, waiting paid off because I wound up scoring it brand new down the road for only $30.  Not bad.<br /><br />If you're a big Goonies fan like I am, this is a really cool collector's set to own, and I would say it's worth it to add this beauty to your collection.  They have both DVD and Blu-Ray sets, whichever capabilities you happen to have.  This set is awesome!</p></br><a href="../users/AWSYTZ2I2MW0V.html">AWSYTZ2I2MW0V</a><br/><p>WHAT A REMARKABLE movie!!!!

Despite the 1980s special effects and acting, there's a certain charm to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000P0J09W">The Goonies</a>. It's largely from the energy of the kids - led by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001VL0K2">The Lord Of The Rings</a>'s Sean Astin. The kids are loud - sometimes too loud - but they're also adorable. The movie follows them along on their quest for lost treasure - and maturity. This is a great adventure movie for kids (although Sloth might be a bit scary).</p></br><a href="../users/A2YCG57S65QXUU.html">A2YCG57S65QXUU</a><br/><p>This 1985 family adventure classic has a great cult following, and with good reason, this film was the most popular movie of that year. The Goonies is about a group of young friends who is on a search to find a hidden pirate treasure, and trying to outwit a family of career crimnals. The special features includes a video commentary by director Richard Donner and the cast of The Goonies as well as the now-classic 1985 Cyndi Lauper music video. Watching The Goonies has brought back a lot of fun memories for me. the movie is perfect for rainy day weekends or for the kids to watch. :)</p></br><a href="../users/A1YB29BIDULEYE.html">A1YB29BIDULEYE</a><br/><p>What makes this movie so great is not only the great stories, but the lovable and believable characters.<br /><br />The story starts actually quite sad in that some friends are going to have to leave their homes, which of course also means leaving each other. We then have just a glimmer of hope that they won't have to leave. (If they can find an old pirate's treasure.) Now what is interesting here is that the hope revolves around a willingness to believe again as a child.<br /><br />Now what is interesting here is that the 4 young friends set off on this journey together, and gradually, Sean Astin's older brother, his possible girl friend, and her friend join the party. (The party started with 4 young children, and 3 older people ended up joining the party.)<br /><br />They go through an interesting series of caves filled with traps in hopes of saving their homes. What is especially interesting here is that no one is there without a purpose. (Corey Feldman knows Spanish and can read the map; Data has some gadgets that may prove useful; Andy can play the keyboard at a crucial time; Brandon is a little older, so he may be acquainted with some dangers the younger crew is not ready for, etc.<br /><br />Of course, we can't have it that easy. They are later persued by 3 The Fratellis who are very bad. But they carry a charm that makes them likable despite their crimes.  A signature moment is when one of the Fratellis complains that his mother always liked the other son better, and then she slaps him and says: "That's right."<br /><br />An especially funny moment with the Fratellis is when they want their prisoner Chunk to tell them EVERYTHING about the hidden treasure, but he takes it literally, and tells them every bad thing he ever did. And one of them gets interested in Chunk's confessions and responds: "I'm starting to like this kid."<br /><br />While the movie may seem simple, it is never boring. And the delightful interaction of the characters who aren't exactly experts, but who all have something to contribute to this journey may very well thrust this movie into the classics.<br /><br />It is emotionally enduring; funny; suspenseful; and full of adventure. Why? Because it's "The Goonies!"</p></br><a href="../users/AER15RIMV8E6D.html">AER15RIMV8E6D</a><br/><p>This is an awesome classic! It has been a few years since I've seen it. I saw it on tv today, and decided to refresh my memory. A group of friends called the Goonies face foreclosure on their families' homes. When Mouth, Chunk, and Data visit Mikey and Brandon Walsh on their last day together, and begin to rummage through the attic, and find a treasure map. The group set out to find the treasure and meet a lot of misadventures along the way. I highly recommend that you hang out with THE GOONIES!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A1VZLLDNLURGJB.html">A1VZLLDNLURGJB</a><br/><p>The Goonies (1985) was a five star film experience for me and my two young boys back in 1985 when we first saw it in the theater. Now that over 20 years have gone by and my boys are grown, I occasionally watch it on DVD and in retrospect, I am a little surprised at some of the lines. I know this film is a cult movie and it probably deserves it, but really didn't see the need for some of the language, like "Oh Sh-t" from Chunk, and so on.<br /><br />My kids really enjoyed this film and wound up being "influenced" by the flick in a few ways.  My wife and I bought a pirates map on fake parchment for them which we had framed and placed in their room which we called a Goonies Map.  For a period, my younger boy was interested in pirates, pirate ships and coins, and the family even wound up staying at Pirates Cove (a hotel which featured a full size pirates ship) on a trip indirectly because of this darn film.<br /><br />That being said, when I screen this old movie with subtitles on I am surprised at some of the things the Goonies say in the course of the entertaining racket. Just an observation, that's all. All in all, a great film and I would still vote it five full stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A370Z6I5GBWU44.html">A370Z6I5GBWU44</a><br/><p>This is one of these great old movies which will always be a classic, and stands out among all the shill that is produced today.

This and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXIP">Stand By Me (Special Edition)</a> are the essential children's 80's movies that everone should see.

Heck, I continue to love it even to this day.  It's about a group of kids that find a treasure map in an attic full of old pirate antiques.  A pretty seamless transition then takes place, considering the unusual circumstances, where the kids follow the map to an old abandoned restaurant that serves as a hideout for a family of escaped convicts.  The rest of the movie is a wild chase for the kids, as they make their way through a booby-trap infested tunnel with escaped convicts right on their tail.  The creative booby-traps are very reminiscent of Indiana Jones, which shouldn't surprise anybody who watches movie credits, and even though the content is most unusual, the movie never loses it's believablity (except, perhaps, during the Superman shirt gag).<br /><br />This may very well be my favorite Spielberg film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1I7QGUDP043DG.html">A1I7QGUDP043DG</a><br/><p>This movie will always be one of my favorites.

They are being forced out of their homes by a local land developer that wants to build a country club. The only way to save their homes is to come up with enough money to pay off all the back taxes their families owe. Unfortunately, it is a feat that is practically impossible to accomplish. However, The Goonies discover a map that is supposed to lead to the buried treasure of the legendary &quot;One-Eyed&quot; Willie. Determined to keep their homes, the group sets off on a quest to find the rich stuff. Little do they know, that the beginning of the hunt leads to the basement of the local crime family The Fratelis. Now with the Fratelis hot on their tails, they must overcome numerous obstacles and booby traps to find the loot. <p>Sean Astin who is known for his role as Sam in the Lord of the Ring films, offers an outstanding performance as Mikey - the leader of the Goonies. He is the believer of the group and has always loved pirates - especially &quot;One - Eyed&quot; Willie. Johnathan Key Quan plays Data, who is the creative one of the group. He is obsessed with making wacky inventions and none of them work. Corey Feldman is great as Mouth. Mouth is a smart aleck whose mouth always gets the group in trouble. Jeff Cohen probably offers the film's best performance with his portrayal of Chunk. He is the main reason why the film has become such a fan favorite. Chunk is the most entertaining character by far. His constant whining, food cravings, and &quot;truffle shuffle&quot; will have you laughing for the majority of the film. Mikey's older brother Brand ( Josh Brolin), his girlfriend Andi ( Keri Green), and her best friend Stef ( Martha Plimpton) are also great as they come along for the ride. Troy Perkins ( Steve Antin) is the rich and spoiled bully that makes it his mission to terrorize the Goonies. He also has a thing for Andi and is in constant battle with Brand for her affection. The Frateli crime family is great. Mama Frateli (Anne Ramsey) will give you the creeps. Joe Pantoliano and Robert Davi play the Frateli brothers Francis and Jake. Their constant bickering and other antics will make you laugh. Then there is Sloth. Sloth is their brother that is disfigured and possesses superhuman strength. They keep him chained in the basement. Sloth however is my favorite character and has a heart that matches the size of his love for Baby Ruth's! The relationship between him and Chunk is very touching.<p>The Goonies is one of my favorite movies. I have seen it maybe a dozen times, and I still love it just as much. Richard Donner does an excellent job directing the vast array of talent in the film. Steven Spielberg crafts an amazing tale of friendship and determination set in extraordinary circumstances. The characters that pave the road for the story are by far the best thing about the film. The visuals in this movie are beautifully done. The underground caverns, the booby traps, the pirate ship, and the treasure all give the film a sense of authenticity when dealing with the pirate genre. <p>The DVD is outstanding. It contains deleted scenes that include a hilarious convienient store scene and the infamous octopus scene. The commentary is the best feature. It brings back all the Goonies and shows them in the booth. You get to see Data, Chunk, Mikey, Brand, Mouth, Stef, and Andi all grown up. It is great to hear what they have to say about working with each other, the characters that they played, and the movie in general. The movie itself and the amazing DVD make it a must own!</p></br><a href="../users/A2WX1UESDOLXRE.html">A2WX1UESDOLXRE</a><br/><p>This is the kind of stuff every kid dreams about. Having an adventure with your best friends that includes treasure, being chased by bad guys, avoiding the booby traps, and all the while having a massive blast. The Goonies is wickedly fun, includes all the above mentioned, and more. The story is built around such solid characters, characters that you see yourself in, your friends in, your family in. These everyday people are thrust into a wild adventure.<br /><br />Mikey (Sean Astin-- look at how little he is!!) and his brother Bran (Josh Brolin) live in Astoria, where their house is being forclosed on by men who want to build a country club over it. Mikey dreams of finding a buried treasure, "rich stuff," to save his house and the houses of all his friends, who are also being forclosed on. His father works in a museum and has kept priceless artifacts in the attic, where Mikey, Bran, and their gaggle of friends find a treasure map. Mikey can't resist. He has to find this treasure and find out if the stories his father told him about the legendary pirate One Eyed Willy are true.<br /><br />Joining Mikey are his hilarious friends-- Chunk, a clutsy eating machine; Mouth, the joking talker; and Data, the inventor. Andy the cheerleader and her friend Steph tag along too, mostly so Andy can schmooze with Bran. And of course, they are being chased by three inept, money hungry criminals. It's such a whirlwind adventure, so much fun, an Indiana Jones flick of sorts. There aren't that many great adventure films. This is one of the top ones of all time.</p></br><a href="../users/A1T3O2LILVK0C4.html">A1T3O2LILVK0C4</a><br/><p>In 1985, Steven Spielberg (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXC5">the Indiana Jones films</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CX9Q">E.T.</a>) served as an executive producer on the Goonies, an adventure film based on a story by Spielberg and directed by Richard Donner (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000059Z8J">Superman</a>). Since the film's release, it's become a cult classic of sorts, as well as being a favorite film for nostalgic teens and adults.<br /><br />The story follows a group of outcast kids growing up in Oregon, who call themselves the Goonies, as they spend their last weekend together before their parents are forced to sell their homes to make way for a golf course. Mikey, the youngest and most precocious of the Goonies, finds a pirate's treasure map in his attic and realizes that if the Goonies can find the treasure then their parents won't have to sell their homes. Mikey and his good friends, Chunk, Mouth, and Data begin following the clues that will lead to the treasure and they're eventually joined by Mikey's older brother, Brand and two high school girls, Andy and Stef. But things become complicated when a family of second-rate criminals, the Fratellis, catch Chunk and find out about the treasure. Jake and Francis Fratelli lock Chunk up in a room with their deformed brother, Sloth. Sloth may be fearsome in appearance but his grotesque exterior hides a heart of gold, and he and Chunk become fast friends. Meanwhile the other Goonies make their way through a series of underground tunnels, all the way avoiding booby traps and following the clues. Little do they know that the Fratellis, lead by Mama Fratelli, are in hot pursuit. But can the Goonies find the pirates' treasure and save their homes, and can they outsmart the Fratellis?<br /><br />Like many of Spielberg's own films, The Goonies follows a specific formula. The kids, like those in E.T., swear frequently and use vulgar language, so parents be warned. There's also some risqu&eacute; humor and comic violence, but most of which is simply too funny to be offensive. When inspected closely, the story unravels due to numerous plot holes, continuity errors, and a general lack of realism. But that's all part of the charm of The Goonies.<br />The ensemble cast is terrific especially Sean Astin as Mikey, Jeff Cohen as Chunk, Corey Feldman as Mouth, Ke Huy Quan as Data, Josh Brolin as Brand, Martha Plimpton as Stef, Kerri Green as Andy, John Matuszak as Sloth, Robert Davi as Jake Fratelli, Joe Pantoliano as Francis Fratelli, and Anne Ramsey as Mama Fratelli.<br /><br />The excellent DVD includes outtakes (features the infamous missing octopus scene), The Making of The Goonies vintage featurette, a ridiculously silly 12-minute Cyndi Lauper music video, theatrical trailer, and an audio commentary (with video commentary by Richard Donner, Sean Astin, Jeff Cohen, Corey Feldman, Ke Huy Quan, Josh Brolin, Martha Plimpton and Kerri Green). This audio/video commentary is perhaps the most entertaining feature I've ever seen on a DVD and alone makes this a worthy purchase.<br /><br />Also recommended:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005J6UR">Gremlins</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006AL1E">Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019GO582">Explorers</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001I562I">Flight of the Navigator</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Q6GUKM">The Monster Squad</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HT3PQK">Home Alone</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005RT3N">The Sandlot</a></p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>The Goonies is a classic children's film from the 1980s. Sean Astin and Corey Feldman give the best performances in this adventure flick. Great film to watch on a rainy Saturday, I highly recommend this "treasure". Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A2EBLL2OYEQJN9.html">A2EBLL2OYEQJN9</a><br/><p>The Goonies is every bit as powerful as it was upon its original release twenty years ago.  Is there really a need to recount the plot?  (A group of misfit kids embark on a treasure hunt for a lost pirate ship, battling some really bad guys along the way.)<br /><br />If only modern movies had plots as well-crafted as this movie!  I would label this as a family movie with the caveat that the children are a little older than 8 or so.  There is some foul language, but nothing that hasn't been overheard by little ears before.  The action (and the deformed chained-up beast Sloth) can be a bit terrifying to younger children, so this should be watched by the entire family, parents included.<br /><br />The Goonies is a movie about friendship, family, and the triumph of hard work when you really apply yourself to a goal.  It's the realization of every kid's fantasy.  Everyone will find one of the Goonies to identify with.  This is a must-own DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/A138826JMC0J3T.html">A138826JMC0J3T</a><br/><p>The Goonies to this day is still one of my avorites! This is just an awesome movie! It starts out that Mikey (a young Sean Astin) finds out that they have to move because a rich man is buying up their house and putting a golf course down in it's place. <p>While haning out with his friends Mouth (Corey Feldman), Data (Ke Huy Quan) and Chunk (Jeff Cohen), they find a map of their town and on the map it says there is buried treasure. Mikey then gets the idea that if they found the treasure, they wouldn't have to leave! In a wild and crazy adventure from hiding from the criminal family the Fratelli's, who want that treasure too, to dodging booby traps to some good old laughs, this is a great family comedy movie that will entertain the entire family.<p>Now there is some swearing and sexual humor in this movie but it's very minute compared to some of the things these days. It's almost a timeless classic that you'll never get bored of. Pick up this movie and enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A2EIK4L9730WWJ.html">A2EIK4L9730WWJ</a><br/><p>The Goonies is another great classic film from the 80's and i heard that they might be bringing them back for a sequel!!!!! When this one came out in 1985 it was a hit and it has everything from action to some romance to some great chases!!!! When a bunch of kids go exploring they come across a treasure pirate ship with treasures that will make the kids rich,but a mob wants the treasure too!!!!! Its a battle between the kids and the mob for this treasure!!!!!!

Just the movies unless otherwise stated.<br /><br />Please note that the rating above might not accurately reflect my thoughts, you will see a rating sentence at the end of the review.<br /><br />This movie achieved 3 times it's original budget, but it wasn't nearly one of the top grossing films of the year. Meaning, it had a low budget. It was so lucky to get Steven Spielberg, that guy knows what movie to do weather or not he gets a paycheck. Now, that doesn't always be the case.<br /><br />Of course I have to talk about S.S. Film for a second, I love that guy. He did infact do E.T., Close Encounters, Gremlins, Jaws, Back to the Future, Blues Brothers Duel, Indiana Jones Tetra logy, Hook, Jurassic Park Trilogy, Saving Private Ryan, Men in Black Duo logy, Schindler's List, Poltergeist, he too me is the best director/producer/writer of all time. However, in his early years and frankly his later years, he hasn't done quite as much as his prime. He rejected offers to do Superman - The Movie, King Kong and Jaws 2, which would have been awesome had Spielberg done it. Don't get me wrong, I love Superman - The Movie and King Kong and Jaws 2 have qualities most people don't talk about. However, if Spielberg directed those films they would have been both more successful and better.<br /><br />I feel the best films are directed by Spielberg. Lately, he has done a lot more artsy films. I'm okay with these, and some are masterpieces, but some of them bug me. Needless to say, Steve better get back off his @$$ and do some Sci-Fi and Horror. Which, he has, including War of the Worlds, A.I., and the Transformers soon-2-be trilogy, along with the new Indiana Jones [& The Kingdom of the Crystal Scull.] However, his ratio is Dramas:Sci-Fi as is 2.5:1 at mid-range. I also have a problem with one film he directed: the Money Pit. Need I say more? Worst movie ever. That's alright though, everyone has there ups and downs.<br /><br />A few movies that I would have loved Spielberg talent in :Superman Tetra Logy, Batman Motion Picture Anthology, Jaws Sequel Trilogy, King Kong, The Terminator Quadrilogy, Alien Quadrilogy, Predator Duo logy, AVP Soon-2-Be Trilogy, X-Men Trilogy. X-Men Origins, Cloverfield, Any of the Star Trek/Star Wars Movies, Harry Potter Films, Lord of the Rings Soon-2-Be Tetra logy, Sings, and of course, The Matrix Trilogy+1. @#$%ing He11 any God Dam movie would have been awesome with Spielberg! Now, I do love all these movies, I just think...heck, every single Sci-Fi, Fantasy and Sci-Action-Fi film shoudl have had Spielberg in some form.<br /><br />Now that you've heard my thoughts about the Producer ans Writer, lemme talk a little about the movie. This movie is a classic, but watching it on a small screen will not do it justice. This is something for you too talk yourself into and immerse yourself. A true trip back to childhood, in a way that nobody expects. You never think of these memories of your childhood that the Goonies go through because you feel "you're to @#$%ing sophisticated to have been such a person." Lighten up Jack! We all asked our mom if we could go out naked when we were 4! Did We? DID WE?!!?!! I think we did. For those who haven't seen the movie, nobody is younger than 10 I'm just using a comparison. There is no nudity.<br /><br />This movie does appear to be a little dated, which if you're patient, adds to the charm. The characters...well Chunk is the side of us that is clumsy and naive, he is the innocence and dishonestly in our childhood. The one that lies when he knows he's lying yet he thinks he is telling the truth. Chunk is the part of us that wants too live in the dreamworld, replicated as Oz in those Oz films, but since he cannot brings it into the real world. Sloth is the guy who shows us the part that is outcast by the adults and can be accepted by children. This also replicates innocence. He is the feeling we have "why doesn't anybody like me." And on a scale, nobody does. They don't like that part of you. Only you and the righteous like that part of you. And that part of you is what makes you different and special. Here, he is accepted by the Goonies, representing the Goonies as a whole as the good people in the world.<br /><br />You know, this movie is just as symbolic as the Disney Alice in Wonderland. It's just discredited for being understated.<br /><br />Ma Fratelli is someone in our lives. That teacher we hate, the times when our mom yells at us, the stranger who asks us for change, the bad neighbor, or just some idiotic creep. Just someone we really, really hate as a kid. That evil person who doesn't give a dam about childhood. She just wants money, and can't even remember being a child. YOU SEE THIS KIND OF PERSON IN CHILDRENS MOVIES ALL THE TIME! Not that this is a kids movie, not by a longshot. Some pretty disturbing stuff in their. A relative of mine went to see this when she was 14 and couldn't stay in the theater. But now I am off topic. The mom is obviously mom, our mom, his mom, every bodies mom, it's just hard to grasp sometimes. Brand (or Troy) is obviously the big brother, he always is the tough guy, always loved, picks on you, you get the picture. However, behind the scenes he is usually in a pickle himself, and just takes his anger out on you. Eventually, you get payback. Weather he learns his lesson or not is not a casual case.<br /><br />Rosalita Rosalita Rosalita, dang. She represents a baby sitter, or a visitor, somebody who is our mom's friend and is invited into our territory without our approval. She is an unwelcome visitor and needs to leave the premisis before further action is taken. This is what you say in your mind when this character visits you except it translates too "mommy I'm scared." And that's another thing, kids don't understand how to express the great feelings that they have through what we only understand being the English language. Unless you speak another language. But children understand such feelings through thought, but since we have no telepathy, children aren't able to communicate the greatest of things to us. To Kill a Mockingbird (book) tried to express these thoughts through the mind of Scout and through the words of Scout as best as it could, but still there will always be locked away secrets in the mind of a child.<br /><br />Mikey is our Cocky side as a kid (and frankly life), he is the one who, usually is right, but when he is wrong he pays. But he thinks he's always right and he thinks he can do anything because of his innocence. He is the leader in us, the one who cannot help but want more in life and not just be as great as everyone. Do you know that most Americans don't wanna be rich, but instead wanna be richer than everybody else around them? Incredible, everybody is a 10 year old. Mouth, oh what the heck, I'm just gonna copy it from Wikipedia, it states it so well, "an obnoxious, smart-mouthed Goonie who loves to talk and tends to be a bit of a trickster." Who hasn't had that phase? He kinda ties in with our Cocky side. Data is the side that everybody loves, we all have our talents. But when were young, they are seen by others a lot more because we stand out. Data even exaggerates and makes a joke out of such love for kids.<br /><br />Stef is our sister, no doubt to that. Young or old, she just got chosen older out of luck. I think we all know our sister, the brat, the so called smart one, the one everybody is proud of but she feels like nobody appreciates her. We all know that person. I could be confusing Stef with Andy.<br /><br />Okay, I was wrong, it was among the top 10 highest grossing films of the year. But, that's another story. *gets slapped in the face by Mr.Black.* Well, besides the excellent symbolism, this film portrays the first of the awesome tales of the adventures of action-adventures of children. I AM REDUNDANT! You know this movie inspired a genre, such movie example Jumanji.<br /><br />The Rating? 4/5 would be usual, but I can't help my soft spot for symbolism and give it a 4.4/5</p></br><a href="../users/A1DRKVXO300RUE.html">A1DRKVXO300RUE</a><br/><p>Not sure the point of reviewing the Goonies; its like critically evaluating the architectural design of the Biltmore Estate.  As a modern day classic, it stands on its own as the de facto standard for adventure.  Die hard fans will note the scene similarity with Twilight - the surfing/beach (the "Push"?) scene.<br /><br />http://mynetflixlife.blogspot.com/</p></br><a href="../users/A2PMQH87R1H3QU.html">A2PMQH87R1H3QU</a><br/><p>Every generation has certain movies that will always transport them back to childhood. "The Goonies" does that for alot of people in my generation. The cool thing about this flick is, not only does it take you back, but, once there, it captures so wonderfully what the best moments of being a kid felt like. Yes, the plot is mostly a fantasy-the ultimate wish fulfillment of having a great adventure, and saving the day. However, the soul of the movie-why it's still cherished today-is it's understanding of friendship and family. "Stand By Me" is the only other film that has so accurate a portrait of adolescent boys interacting with each other. The cast had such an amazing chemistry. Great direction by Richard Donner, and this is Spielberg magic in it's prime. This fantastic DVD presentation does the film justice. Some may think this movie is way too 80's, but to me "The Goonies" is an essential classic.</p></br><a href="../users/A2Z9XBCYT3AHHU.html">A2Z9XBCYT3AHHU</a><br/><p>i grew up on this film among others. it's great to see it out on DVD finally.</p></br><a href="../users/A3OI841P5R6FCH.html">A3OI841P5R6FCH</a><br/><p>Well, gee-whiz! Looks like I'm not the only one who waxes nostalgic about this flick! Of course, having grown up in the 80s, gettin' sentimental over The Goonies  is pretty much a given. How can any self-respecting Gen-Xer NOT be taken back whenever he/she watches this bad-boy? Yeah, see what I mean? Heck, I even remember re-enacting my fave Goonies  moments with the few friends I had way back when. I was always stuck with havin' to play 'Chunk' for obvious reasons (I still do today!) but that's cool, 'cuz he had the best lines anyway! Now I'll admit that doin' the Truffle-Shuffle was sorta lame. But the guy you really hadda feel for was the one who was picked to play Sloth !<br /><br />All right, enough nostalgia now; time for me to break out a proper review. Now if you're lookin' for a synopsis of the flick, take a look at the top of the item page. That having been said, I'm goin' to comment on the picture quality (pretty good, but not quite tops compared to other DVDs in the Warner Bros.  catalogue) and sound quality (above-average; but like the picture quality, Warner  has done better with their other video discs).<p>Now it's on to the special features, of which there are a decent amount. To me the most notable extra feature is the commentary audio track, featuring director Richard Donner and the six Goonies  adventurers, all grown up! Just about everybody throws in an anecdote or two as the flick plays on, except for 'Data ', who had to be prodded into talking by the others on occasion. Sean 'Mikey ' Astin throws in his two cents every once in a while for about the first forty minutes, then mysteriously disappears for the rest of the presentation. And Corey 'Mouth ' Feldman spends quite a few moments takin' shots from his castmates regarding his character's VERY 80s fashion tastes, which included parachute pants and a Prince  Purple Rain  T-shirt!<p>Then there's the behind-the-scenes mini-doc featuring Donner getting things going with the kids, and Executive Producer Steven Spielberg throwing in a few comments about the flick and how it relates to his childhood memories of old-time adventure flicks and stuff. Also of note are the outtakes. The showcase cutting-room scrap: a scene at the local convenience store featuring the fab four of Mikey , Mouth , Data , and Chunk . Personally, I felt this particular bit should've been restored to the movie itself, but then again, it's probably best that they left well enough alone. The rest of the excised snippets include a giant octopus attack in the hidden pirate cove, and a few scene extensions.<p>Last-- and least-- is the two-part Cyndi Lauper Goonies 'R' Good Enough video, which has to be one of the weirdest and dumbest music videos ever produced. It's basically a fifteen-minute-long mini-movie featuring Cyndi going on her very own Goonies -style adventure, with a few of the mo-pic's principals and a lotta WWF stars roundin' out the cast. If you ever thought that Captain Lou Albano, Rowdy Roddy Piper, Classy Freddy Blassie, or Andre The Giant had no acting ability, this unfortunate little ditty-drama will prove you right!<p>Now if only Warner would put their discs in PLASTIC keep cases instead of cardboard, this bad-boy would be near-perfect!<p>'Late</p></br><a href="../users/A126KX6FVI4T66.html">A126KX6FVI4T66</a><br/><p>A mixed bunch of kids follow a treasure map to a hidden<br />pirate ship while being chased by a family of forgers.<br />The fat kid and his deformed buddy save the day,<br />but they have to leave without any treasure ( or so it appears).<br />The motivation is saving their homes from greedy developers.<br />The movies is fun, but not really very deep.<br />It seems to be made like a lot of other movies as mindless<br />enterainment,<br />but real pirates and real sunken treasure have been found since then in several places<br />and not by following pirate maps in Spanish either.</p></br><a href="../users/A2F8R40Z2OMIJM.html">A2F8R40Z2OMIJM</a><br/><p>I've always loved THE GOONIES. It's arch villains (the Fratelli's and their Mama with her tatoos) are inspired casting!  The film has an innocent, Hardy Boys sense of adventure that is hard to resist.  I've always enjoyed the hyper-active line readings in the film. You can tell that director Richard Donner created an ad-lib atmosphere on the set. Some of the lines are hilarious and I always hear something new during repeated viewings.<p>The DVD has a great bonus:  The commentary is a screen within the film of the reunited actors.  They got everybody back!  Check out how the child actors have grown up!  Some of the commentary is hilarious.  Martha Plimpton has some particularly enjoyable memories and a ferocious laugh.<p>The cut scenes (including the famous Octopus scene) are disappointing.  The Octopus looks really fake.  No wonder they cut it!  The digital revolution of the 90's really changed filmaking.  Today, the Octopus would be CGI.<p>Also, it was fun to see the second part of Cyndi Lauper's &quot;Goonies&quot; video.  I used to watch MTV all the time, trying to catch part two!  I never saw it.  It seemed like they only played part one.  This video, with its campy wrestling stars and lovely, kooky Cyndi, is a hoot!<p>As the Cyndi Lauper song goes: THE GOONIES &quot;are good enough for me&quot;.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ01Q3070LT29.html">AQ01Q3070LT29</a><br/><p>The entire younger cast of The Goonies are reunited on this DVD version in the Special Features/Commentary With Hidden Treasures. On camera is Jonathan Ke Quan (Key Huy Quan), Corey Feldman, Sean Astin, Director Richard Donner, Kerri Green, Martha Plimpton, Jeff Cohen and Josh Brolin.<br /> The reunion and commentary is fun to hear and see.  Also in the Special Features section are three outtakes, the original theatrical trailer, a short documentary "The Making Of The Goonies", and the Cyndi Lauper music video "The Goonies 'R' Good Enough" Part One and Part Two.  The first outtake is 3 minutes long. The second  and third outtakes are about 2 minutes long.  Watch out for that giant octopus!<br />  I enjoyed the reunion of the cast.</p></br><a href="../users/A13H2JJ3GEMJN1.html">A13H2JJ3GEMJN1</a><br/><p>&quot;The Goonies&quot; is an entertaining movie that the whole family can watch together. It starts with a close-knit band of friends spending a last morning together. Their neighborhood is about to be demolished, scattering the families that inhabit it. When they discover an old pirate map, though, they decide to follow it in hopes of finding treasure and saving their homes. What follows is a fast-paced adventure with caverns, crooks, skeletons, booby-traps, and a old pirate ship. There is also a liberal sprinkling of funny lines to go with all the thrills and chills. <p>While this is a fine movie, and great fun to watch, it is not a long-lost Hollywood classic. It doesn't have the action of the Errol Flynn version of &quot;Robin Hood&quot;, the drama of Hitchcock's &quot;Rear Window&quot;, or the classic humor of &quot;Arsenic And Old Lace&quot;. All the five-star ratings here would suggest that this is a movie of classic proportions. It isn't. It's great fun, and I recommend it for family viewing. There's never a dull moment, and I believe most people will enjoy it. I do. I own a copy, already. Just don't expect too much.</p></br><a href="../users/A2198FZZMTJ38H.html">A2198FZZMTJ38H</a><br/><p>Part preteen mystery novel, part shiver-me-timbers adventure trek, &quot;The Goonies&quot; is a classic example of crowd-pleasing entertainment that needs no logic in order to tell its story. Director Richard Donner seems to have gathered this seek-and-find journey from the childhood fantasies of every child in the world a dozen times over, and the result is pure, unrelenting fun from beginning to end!<p>The plot is the simplest one imaginable: Mikey, Mouth, Data, and Chunk, a group of friends who call themselves The Goonies, stumble across a centuries-old map of the upper West Coast, near their homes, where there is a treasure believed to be buried somewhere along the shoreline. Despite the disagreement of Mikey's older brother, Brandon, they leave in search of the treasure, in hopes that their newfound riches will save their homes from a greedy developer. <p>Their hopes are somewhat thwarted when the path to the treasure lands them face-to-face with the Fratellis, a mother-son crime team who begin tracking the kids once they realize that there is money at stake. As they all make their way deeper and deeper into the caverns leading to the pirate ship, they encounter dangers that will keep kids on the edge of their seats. <p>This is all done with a high level of laughter, lightheartedness, and surprising enjoyment. Each character is given a certain demeanor, different from others. Mikey is crippled by a speech impediment, while Chunk, like his name, is husky and clumsy; Data has a pseudo-James Bond fascination about him, and Mouth is outspoken and crude. All of their personalities combine with hilarious results, a special part of the film's magical charm. <p>The cast also seems to be having a tremendous amount of fun with the movie. To scrutinize their performances is completely cynical, for their is little that can be criticized. The dialogue is corny from the start, but everyone takes it all in stride, and together, they polish off each moment with comedic joy and humor. <p>As a child, I enjoyed this movie immensely, and as I look back on it, the adventure was quite suspenseful, due to my age and experience with movies. The journey through the underground caverns, the booby traps, the children at the hands of the not-so-cunning crooks... all of this is pure magic for a kid, without being overly frightening. Now, as an adult, the movie has a much different effect on me, allowing me to recall my childhood fantasies, and the vast enjoyment I had for this film. <p>&quot;The Goonies&quot; is a classic adventure that appeals to many, kids and adults alike. It's got a charm and sense of humor that grow on you, and its indulgence in its own corniness is, in its own way, appealing. For those who experienced it as a child, to watch it now is to recapture a pleasurable memory from childhood; for those new to the experience, it recalls your own fantasies and beliefs as a kid, and leaves you smiling with satisfaction.</p></br><a href="../users/A1Z2ZN39LL07GI.html">A1Z2ZN39LL07GI</a><br/><p>The Packaging very exclusive .. you must own if the prices right dan the lowest.

Guys."<br /><br />Shut up!<br /><br />I honestly cannot fathom the universal adoration that the masses have for The Goonies. It's one of the most overrated movies I have ever seen in my life. Only the Von Trap children and the brats Spielberg cast as the Lost Boys in Hook have irritated me more than The Goonies (with the exception of Chunk). Before I get into the movie I'll give you a run down of the cast.<br /><br />Sean Astin as Mikey: seems as if he is phonetically reading off cue cards (a-la Peanuts) rather than fully understanding what he is saying.<br /><br />Josh Brolin as Brand: a constant damper on the adventure as he does nothing but attempt to diffuse the fun with his constant 'grown-up' perspective.<br /><br />Short Round as Data: so lovable in Temple of Doom, in the space of one year he managed to become the most annoying characters in movie history. Very little he says can be understood. His inventions are cartoonish, out of place, contribute nothing, and spoil many scenes. Whenever he opens his mouth I just want to grit my teeth down to the gums.<br /><br />Corey Feldman as Mouth: would be tolerable if he stopped screaming so much. This applies to the whole cast, but especially Mouth. Is better when he's serious instead of sarcastic, which isn't often unfortunately.<br /><br />Kerri Green as Andy: again, she would be bearable is she just shut up. Her random petrified rant about looking after her body is completely un-called-for and spoils the scene.<br /><br />Martha Plimpton as Stef: likable, but doesn't have much to do or serve any purpose.<br /><br />Jeff Cohen as Chunk: adorable, and the best (and youngest) actor of the bunch by far. Cohen's talent is infectious and it's a shame that the rest of the child cast undo his effort. In the scene where he confesses his previous misbehavior you can see that Robert Davi is loving it and cannot hold in his laughter.<br /><br />John Matuszak as Sloth: also adorable, but his "Hey, you guys" moment spoils everything.<br /><br />The Goonies was the second of three films in a row that Chris Columbus wrote for Amblin. If it had the shades of darkness and horror of Gremlins before it, or Young Sherlock Holmes after it, then it may well have been a true classic. Richard Donner (a loud, monstrous director who I really like) even used darkness to great effect in Scrooged a few years later, but here he seems to be really distracted by the fact that he's laughing at the antics off-camera and unable to see that, as a finished film, it's not as funny as he thinks it is. I mean what teenage kid, in the 80s, played with marbles or pretended to be James Bond? He directs these kids as if they were 7 or 8 instead of 13-ish. A film depicting more realistic teenagers would have won me over right away.<br /><br />The titular gang themselves live in Astoria, Oregon and are failing to enjoy their last weekend together before the rich folks tear down their houses to build a golf course. That is until Mikey suddenly remembers the treasure map up in the loft. So off they go to find the treasure of pirate captain One-Eyed Willie against the wishes of downer big brother Brand. They soon discover that the entrance to the subterranean world where Willie lies waiting begins underneath an abandoned restaurant used as a hideout by the Fratelli crime family. They only just barely manage to sneak into tunnels without being noticed, leaving Chunk behind to have his own sideshow adventure. Once inside the tunnels they encounter a gauntlet of traps set by Willie to prevent anyone getting his loot.<br /><br />Sound good right? And it would be if handled by a different director, or was scored by someone other than Dave Gruisin, who turns in a fully generic effort with no standout themes or melodies. Silvestri and Goldsmith were very busy in 1985, but nobody Gruisin, who I have never heard of before or since, was the wrong choice. I fully believe that Columbus' script was worthy, as I have read the novelization and it's far superior to the film, but for above listed reasons it doesn't work for me as a film.<br /><br />A lot of The Goonies has been rudely forced into pop-culture too. How exactly is 'The Truffle Shuffle' funny? Why do people fondly remember this? It's...nothing. Why do people always quote Sloth's "Hey, you guys!" as if it's hilarious. It isn't. It is absolutely not funny at all. By the end Donner allows the action to become campy and farcical, disrespecting the story and pathos. There are moments towards the climax where I honestly feel like switching the movie off.<br /><br />Stick with the novelization, and be thankful a sequel was never made.<br /><br />The Blu Ray features an above-average 2.40:1 1080p picture with Dolby TrueHD sound. All of the extras from the 2001 DVD have been ported over with no new material.</p></br><a href="../users/A15YPJLKLZS0MK.html">A15YPJLKLZS0MK</a><br/><p>Hilariously cheesey Spielberg involved film starring Corey Feldman with soundtrack music by Cyndie Lauper. Following a treasure map into an underground realm to race ahead of bad guys. Overall an enjoyable film you can take the kids to.</p></br><a href="../users/A3CCYAQRHUTPIQ.html">A3CCYAQRHUTPIQ</a><br/><p>Everybody of a certain age (23-26 or so) will have seen this film at the cinema, or on television already. One of those Steven Speilberg films that wasn't actually directed by him (see also: 'Gremlins', 'Poltergeist', and  so forth), it features a gang of kids who shout constantly until you want  to torture them to death. And Corey Feldman (not Haim), too.<p>It's not as  good as you remember - action-wise, it doesn't get into gear until about  half-way through, and the kids are really, really irritating. It resembles  a less-expensive version of 'Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom', and  that was always the lesser of the Indy films.<p>Still, it passes a wet  boxing day well, and it's horrifying to think that, in a decade from now, a  futuristic version of me will only have 'Pokemon: The First Movie' to write  about.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EMDSTJDUE6B0.html">A1EMDSTJDUE6B0</a><br/><p>This is mediocre, at best. Watchable, yes, with children, but just barely. The plot is very predictable. The ending is weak. The effects are marginal (some are downright bad). The editing is not very good, either. If it weren't a serious attempt, it almost could be a classic late night show (which is not always a good thing). Pass this one by.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B3Z2QHW3V35S.html">A2B3Z2QHW3V35S</a><br/><p>My husband watched this movie when he was a kid. He enjoys watching it till this day. He introduce me to this movie. I watch it with him, but I really don't care for it. It is interesting in the beginning. Some parts of the middle of the movie is ok. But when they get to the ship I think it get's boring.</p></br><a href="../users/A1COW0UIB5HA9J.html">A1COW0UIB5HA9J</a><br/><p>four kids named Mikey (Sean Astin), Chunk (Jeff Cohen), Mouth (Corey Feldman) and Data (Ke Huy Quan) who call themselves "The Goonies" discover a treasure map in the attic of Mikey's house. Their beloved neighborhood is going to be a major golf course, so they go on an adventure into finding the lost buried treasure so they can all help out in protecting their beloved neighborhood. Unfortunately three ghastly criminals Mama Fratelli (Anne Ramsey) with her sons Jake (Robert Davi) and Francis (Joe Pantoliano) are also after the treasure.<br /><br />One of the 80's most beloved adventure movies! Director Richard Donner whom made such classics like "Superman 1 & 2", "The Omen" and "Lethal Weapon" and executive producer Steven Spielburg has created a hilarious and entertaining flick for everyone to enjoy. The film co-stars the beautiful Kerri Green as hottie Andi, John Matsuzak as Sloth the lovable  deformed man and Josh Brolin as Brand, Mike's big tough brother and the acting especially by the kids are very well done. It's one of the best movies of it's time and still appeals to kids, teens and adults alike in this must see movie.<br /><br />This DVD contains great picture and sound with good extras like video/audio commentary by the cast and crew, trailer, Featurette, Outtakes, and "Goonies R Good Enough" music video by Cyndi Lapher.</p></br><a href="../users/AAU7CAQIN5BAE.html">AAU7CAQIN5BAE</a><br/><p>you gotta be a goon times 25 if you didnt immediately fall in love with Goonies, at any age. But how wonderful it was for those of us in the pre teen years, who saw this when it first came out. How magical the ride was.<br /><br />I mean Speilberg, Donner and Chris Columbus. I mean the cream of the incessant crop.<br /><br />"Goonies" is quintessential Speilberg. When a film, not in the era of CGI, and computer animated everything, can just grip you with an amazing score, a slew of talented kids, and a storyline that is gripping, flowing and totally fun, you feel so great about yourself over and over again. I can be down in the dumps to the extreme, and throw Goonies in, and it takes my through a rough day with smiles and enticing childlike splendor.<br /><br />How many of us wanted to be part of that group? How many of us dreamt, in those wee hours, before slept crept in, when we saw Goonies for the first time, or the 90th time, and dreamt such amazing things: to find hidden treasure, to climb down wells and discover hidden caves, to dig through canals and taverns in our backyards and find our own One Eyed Willie, eye mattey, ehhhhhh, yes, the magic of the Gonnies so transformed my youth and brought me to that magical place of make believe, which only the brilliance of Speilberg can do producing. Pirates of the Carribean doesn't touch Goonies for sentimentality or the like.<br /><br />I will never forget seeing this when I was 9 or 10 or so, and getting all red with my mother when they kiss in the dark. I was learning about life then, and Goonies certainly helped me realize the wonderous things I was to look forward to.<br /><br />Not to mention that the character actress Anne Ramsey is impeccably sinister and perfect in her role as Mom Fratelli.<br /><br />One of my favorite films in the world as a child, and totally up there even by today's standards.<br /><br />Chunk, Baby Ruth, Rocky Road, and the hilarious performance by Corey Feldman.<br /><br />Thank you.</p></br><a href="../users/AY69ZK7G6CNYJ.html">AY69ZK7G6CNYJ</a><br/><p>Brainchild of cinematic genius Steven Spielberg, The Goonies is a thrilling fantasy adventure film for younger audiences - although adults will find it enjoyable as well. Foreshadowing the success of the Harry Potter films, The Goonies involves a series of tests and obstacles that a group of young kids must overcome in order to save the day. In a lot of ways, the film is like an Indiana Jones for kids - produced in such a way that kids can envision or fantasize about being in just such a situation.<br /><br />The film follows the exploits of a neighborhood group of kids who call themselves The Goonies. Upset that they will soon have to part ways because of the forced commercial development of their neighborhood, the kids are enjoying what they believe will be one of their last meetings together.<br /><br />But while Mikey, Chunk, Mouth, and Data (the nicknames of the Goonies respectively) are exploring Mikey's attic, they find a treasure map hidden in the back of an old picture frame. Purportedly, the map leads to the long lost treasure of the famous pirate "One-Eyed" Willy. Banding together with Mikey's older brother Brandon and two neighborhood girls, Andy and Stef, the group sets out to uncover the pirate's vast riches and thus save their homes from the wrath of the wrecking ball.<br /><br />But a small problem stands in their way. The treasure map's starting point rests underneath an old abandoned house used as a hideout by the notorious Fratelli crime family. Brothers Jake and Francis, coupled with their deformed yet gentle brother and mean Mama Fratelli, are quite an intimidating force. When the Goonies manage to uncover the entrance to the cave that harbors their treasure, Chunk is left behind. The Fratelli's viciously interrogate the boy in an effort to find out what happened to his friends. But it takes a freak accident (spilled water falling down the hole in the fireplace) before they find One-Eyed Willy's secret passage.<br /><br />With the Fratelli family hot on their heals, the Goonies must pass through a series of mental and physical obstacles set up centuries before by pirates intent on keeping undesirables away from their precious bounty. Interspersed in the action is a number of clever and humorous one-liners that add to the overall audience enjoyment of the film.<br /><br />In the end, the kids discover One-Eyed Willy's monstrous treasure. But can they stave off the greedy ambitions of the Fratelli family? Will they manage to save their neighborhood with the newfound treasure? You'll have to watch to find out, and trust me, this movie is a lot of fun...<br /><br />Each of the stars contributes to the film in his own way. Chunk provides many moments of comic relief with his endless whining, and Data's constant deployment of quirky homemade inventions, although stretching the limits of reality, are a welcome addition to a fantasy adventure film tailored for a young audience.<br /><br />With the introduction of The Goonies DVD, an entirely new generation can discover the thrill and wonder of this instant cinema classic. Given its wide range of appeal to audiences of all ages and the exciting quest for hidden treasure, The Goonies passes the test as a definite must-see film. If you haven't seen it, or even worse - if your children have been deprived of seeing it - then I highly recommend renting this one...<br /><br />The DVD Report</p></br><a href="../users/A146D2LYLICNLS.html">A146D2LYLICNLS</a><br/><p>What can I say about this super-cool excellent movie that hasn't already been said? Not much, other than it's one of the classic &quot;fun&quot; movies from the 80's that's just as enjoyable today as it was when it was first released. You got everything here: action, adventure, romance, thrills, chills and most of all, a lot of FUN. Is it somewhat silly? Perhaps. Does one need to suspend their disbelief? Absolutely. But that's all part of the fun, and what makes it so great to watch. They just don't make movies like this anymore.<p>I'm really glad to see that this great movie has gotten the DVD treatment it deserves, full of extras. My favorite has to be the Cyndi Lauper video of &quot;The Goonies 'R' Good Enough.&quot; I just love the 80's &quot;cheese&quot; factor of it; what a guilty pleasure. A must-have movie for anyone who likes to just sit back and enjoy the ride. What a fun time those 80's were.</p></br></body></html>

It becomes an adventure to see who will escape alive.<br /><br />Mostly good acting by Laura Dern and Sam Neill as dino experts, Jeff Goldblum as the chaos theory mathematician, and Richard Attenborough as the park designer. The kids, played competently by Ariana Richards and Joseph Mazzello had some of the best lines.<br /><br />All the characters seem to think the idea of cloning dinosaurs is a good idea except Goldblum who wonders if we should do what we (in the movie) apparently can do.<br /><br />An entertaining adventure, but no big concept. Not quite the same level as Raiders of the Lost Ark, or Jaws. The movie is best when there are dinosaurs on screen.<br /><br />The only nit-picks include wondering why Jeff Goldblum wears black leather to the tropics, and why a pre-teen girl can save the day on a complex computer (again - see S1m0ne) with her knowledge of UNIX.<br /><br />DVD has wide-screen movie, a behind the scenes documentary, and a few other minimal goodies.</p></br><a href="../users/A1F1FOR46702YF.html">A1F1FOR46702YF</a><br/><p>Director Steven Spielberg's spectacular blockbuster has finally arrived on DVD.

For one of the first times, dinosaurs look real.  Mixing animatronics and CGI every carnivore is menacing as hell.  The opening sequence will definitely get your attention and once everyone reaches the island, the suspense is sustained.<br /><br />Adapted from Michael Crichton's bestselling novel, multi-millionaire John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) has created a theme park on an island near Costa Rica unlike any other.  He and his scientists have found a way to clone extinct plants and animal DNA using blood from mosquitoes captured in amber millions of years ago.  He brings dino-diggers Alan Grant (Sam Neill) and Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) and mathematician Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) to the island to help him convince his investors represented by attorney Donald Gennaro (Martin Ferrero) that the idea is solid and that is successfully nearing completion.<br /><br />Several monkey-wrenches are thrown into the mix to put everyone at risk from the meat eaters.  To complicate matters further Hammond's 2 spunky grandchildren are along for the ride adding a different element of risk.<br /><br />For those who have a decent home theater, I would urge you to watch this on a Blu ray disc.  It is only available as of this writing as part of the "Ultimate Collection."  It will give the dinosaur's roar and foot stomps the proper treatment, not to mention a beautiful picture.</p></br><a href="../users/AWSYTZ2I2MW0V.html">AWSYTZ2I2MW0V</a><br/><p>This is one of the greatest movies i ever seem...Dinossaurs are such interesting creatures, and this is the best DINO movie ever...the story is amazing and the special effects are unbeliavable for the time Jurassic was made...Such a great movie, i think everyone in the world should see this classic!!</p></br><a href="../users/A370Z6I5GBWU44.html">A370Z6I5GBWU44</a><br/><p>I've never read the book (I really should, one of these days) and I really enjoyed this movie. The premise is very creative, and the premise and special effects made this truly a memorable film, especially the T-Rex and the raptors... part of this movie could be considered horror given the scary scenes where the dinosaurs chase people, but it is also a very good piece of sci-fi.</p></br><a href="../users/A11PTCZ2FM2547.html">A11PTCZ2FM2547</a><br/><p>Hard to imagine few movies as fun as JURASSIC PARK.  I had fun when I first saw this Spielberg offering in the theater, and I have grand fun every time I catch it on cable.  I have an eclectic DVD collection, and this movie needs to be a part of it, so there will be a parting with my coin in the near future.  Outside of the suspense, the sheer terror of running for your life from a T-Rex or a raptor, it was, and still is, the (then) state-of-the-art CGI effects that make this thriller so special.  And I still get goose bumps every time I see that puddle of water shake from the approaching steps of a mean-tempered predator.<br /><br />The cast is exceptional, but I especially enjoy Jeff Goldblum as a free-spirited science ethicist; his one-liners and zingers are priceless.  Wayne Knight is the rotund villain we all love to hate, and who isn't entertained by a chain-smoking Samuel L. Jackson pecking away on a keyboard?  Yes, the cast is stellar, but the dinosaurs steal this movie, gobbling up (pardon the pun) every scene they're in.  The effects are as terrifying as they are believable, even after all these years and subsequent technological enhancements; who knew hiding in a kitchen from two determined raptors could produce such white knuckle effects?  Four stars, however, instead of five; with the exception of the ongoing disillusion of Park founder John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) none of the other characters are fully vetted and fleshed out--including the leading roles, played by Sam Neill and Laura Dern (wolf howl).  Yet I'm being picky; in JURASSIC PARK, why should a character be fleshed out when they already have their real flesh at risk?<br />--D.

He invites them for a tour along with some other scientist and his two grandchildren.  during a bad storm they wind up without power and the electric fences are turned off.  Feeding time!  The dinos have no rules and these people are running around like white mice.  People are getting eaten, animals are getting eaten, theres alot of chasing, its terrifying, but at the same time the movie has some of the most beautiful scenes ever.  Its all shot on a beautiful island, there is one particular scene where they are overlooking a family of brontosaurus.  the music adds so much and there are one or two peaceful dinosaurs in the movie but dont get me wrong, the rest are meat eaters and there's a whole lot of chasing and sneaking up on humans going on.<br />i think the first one was definately the best.  the other ones that followed were great too but they didnt have the beauty of the first one, they were mainly just violent.  after the first one you really wanta scream, "are these people that stupid?!!!".  I mean people get ripped in half, 2 children are almost killed, you look around and see a big bloody mess of an island, millions of dollars are in the toilet and you think "hm, maybe we should try this again?!" some numbskull decides to transport a t rex for a viewing in the middle of the city, the scientist who started it all decides to have another go at it.  it gets to the point where you want to hit the old guy in the head with a stick and say "look at your grandkids, old man, arent they probly warped enough from the first time?"<br />lol anyways.  the first one was the best but in one of the sequels, i think it was the second one but im not certain, they see the kids again and i love the look the kids give them.  its definatly got the whole "grandads gone nuts, do something, people are gonna die again" thing going on.<br /><br />jurassic park does for the jungle and science what jaws did for trips to the beach.</p></br><a href="../users/AP3B615GM191G.html">AP3B615GM191G</a><br/><p>Far too many times, movies that tackle very complicated, edgy topics end up taking too much of a "black and white" approach and not showing the shades of grey that exist in all areas of life.  Fortunately, director Steven Spielberg doesn't let this happen, and instead lets the plot play out to its fullest.<br /><br />For a basic plot summary, "Jurassic Park" sees billionaire mogul John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) build an amusement park housing eight species of dinosaurs.  However, in order to get the corporate "O.K" on the whole project, Hammond calls in two scientists Alan Grant (Sam Neil) and Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) to put the place through a fine-tooth comb from a biological perspective.  However, largely due to some corporate intrigue, the park is completely shut down during the tour, leaving all the electric fences unwired and setting up a struggle between species that were never meant to interact.<br /><br />First and foremost, this is an action/adventure flick filled with impressive images, and in that role it succeeds admirably.  The 1993 graphics still measure up to anything that has been produced today, and almost all of the action sequences are breathtaking and will have you on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />What really gives "Jurassic Park" a solid four stars, though, is that Spielberg doesn't "take sides".  Equally screen time is given to both perspectives: educational and biological.  The viewer is allowed to see the pros and cons of both, and weigh them themselves in advance of the sequel.<br /><br />Overall, this is a solid film that delivers in all important departments: effects, action, plot, and characters.  Plus, thanks to the Spielberg direction, it holds up very well almost 20 years later.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>On a remote island, a wealthy entrepreneur secretly creates a theme park featuring living dinosaurs drawn from prehistoric DNA. Before opening the attraction to the public, he invites a top paleontologist, a paleobotanist, a mathematician/theorist, and his two eager grandchildren to experience the park, and help calm anxious investors. However, their park visit is anything but tranquil as the park's security system breaks down, the prehistoric creatures break out, and the excitement builds to surprising results. The special effects are still good today, but they were revolutionary for back in 1993. The acting is good, and the ensemble cast is great. All of the action sequences are perfectly executed, creating plenty of suspense and tension. Steven Speilberg will take you to places in this movie that no one else ever will. I highly recommend Jurassic Park.</p></br><a href="../users/A3OXHLG6DIBRW8.html">A3OXHLG6DIBRW8</a><br/><p>The original Jurassic Park movie remains my favorite of the three in the series. Released in 1993, this was one of the first movies to heavily use CGI effects seamlessly in conjunction with live action. The overall effect is nothing short of unbelievable or, more to the point, totally believable dinosaurs interacting with humans.<br /><br />The movie's plot centers on a Paleontologist (well played by Sam Neill) who is hired to give his stamp of approval on a new "Theme" park ahead of its grand opening. There is also good casting and acting from Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum (a good fit as a "Chaos-tician"), Samuel L. Jackson (way underutilized), and Richard Attenborough (very likeable as the entrepreneur, John Hammond). Rounding out the main cast are two kids (Ariana Richards and Joseph Mazzello as Hammond's grandchildren) and an annoying programmer (Wayne Knight, "Newman" from Seinfeld).<br /><br />The movie does require some suspension of disbelief and acceptance of pseudoscience but overall the plot is strong and the effects are believable.<br /><br />Once the action starts in this movie it really doesn't let up until the very end. This is one of the few movies that has the ability to keep you literally on the edge of your seat. I have "nervous" people in my family who can't watch the movie all of the way through because the tempo of the action is so intense. For that same reason it is one of my teenager's favorite movies.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!</p></br><a href="../users/A5KLP39OKXD5P.html">A5KLP39OKXD5P</a><br/><p>"Jurassic Park" has always been one of my favourate films ever since I was a child. Excellent direction, good editing and a well chosen cast makes the film worth a watch. The film hasn't lost its spice in all these years, its entertains me today as much as it did then. I had always wanted the movie on Dvd and finally glad to get it. The dvd is perfect with great picture quality and sound and has some interesting features like 'the making', etc. In other words, if you loved "Jurassic Park" wholeheartedly, this is the Dvd for your collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A11KRMIA0ES88I.html">A11KRMIA0ES88I</a><br/><p>Dinosaur-mania peaked with the movie based on Michael Crichton's novel. Dinosaurs lived in the Mesozoic Era between 65 and 220 million years ago. The Mesozoic Era is divides into Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous Periods. Jurassic Park brings dinosaurs into the present by cloning them from DNA. They are kept on an island with plans of making them an attraction. They get loose. The velociraptors are fierce. T Rex goes on a rampage. I felt that not enough species were represented. Where are triceratops and stegosaurus? duckbills and ankylosaurs? The theme that man should not tamper with nature is ridiculous because the whole point of science and technology is that man can better himself by understanding and harnessing natural forces. Movie makers are negative. Both George Lucas and Steven Spielberg use dark, chaotic scenes.</p></br><a href="../users/A38UHOCEKSUOSP.html">A38UHOCEKSUOSP</a><br/><p>While I loved almost every aspect of the movie, its the dinosaurs that steal the show, naturally.  And it's not just because we see a T-Rex in full form or a pair of ruthless Raptors, but this is the first time something is presented in glorious CGI.  Jurassic Park made a huge impact with that for its time, just like Terminator 2 did in 1990 and the Matrix in 1999.  Jurassic Park had its place too, at bringing to life dinosaurs that look wonderful and real, and hold up even today on the screen.<br /><br />Based off the book by Micahel Crichton, one can't expect the over all feel of the film to be as good, but honestly the whole thing worked just fine.  If you compare this original to the sequals, its even that much better.  The cast is quite decent, and though huge amounts of dialouge are not shared as well as deep in depthness to most of the characters, its ok because this is about the dinasours and the park on the island.  The first hour is spent much like one would feel taking a trip to this park, almost a vacation if you will, though already the park has its glitches.  A tropical storm comes, and combined with a sneaky worker named Dennis (Wayne Knight - that big nerdy guy in Animal House) who is just too funny sometimes, all heck breaks loose - including the dinosaurs.  Thus begins the last hour thrill ride of chases and survival tactics.  There are two scenes that are very action filled.  The first is the T-Rex attack on the two park vehicles in the rain at night.  The other was just down right scary, the pair of Velociraptors hunting the two children in the dark kitchen.<br /><br />In addition to the dinosaurs, I enjoyed the characters and their acting was fine.  The story was excellent too, and though a bit slow at first, it works out well.  Time is taken to appreciate and learn the mesmorizing truth about these creatures and how they have been recreated.  Thanks to the directing of Spielberg and the outsanding score by John Williams, every scene is a good one.  And thanks to Williams usual impressive composing skills, he creates not just good music, but a theme for Jurassic Park that is easily recognizable whenever heard.<br /><br />Though this went down as a great film, I think it deserves even more credit.  It was created before its time, and holding up very well for today's standads.  The sequals can't even compare.  The story is fascinating and the dinosaurs themselves - breathtaking, and scary.<br /><br />Acting - 4.5<br />Action - 5<br />Characters - 4.5<br />Story - 4.5<br />Overall - 5</p></br><a href="../users/AB1UMC7SB9D7Z.html">AB1UMC7SB9D7Z</a><br/><p>Great action adventure that can appeal to everyone?

He invites the scientists so that they may endorse his park to open it to the public, but a greedy computer engineer and other problems soon let the dinosaurs out of their cages, endangering the island's visitors and creating an unforgettable special effects adventure.<br /><br />Time is slowly outdating the science in this science fiction adventure, but the graphics and action are brilliantly done and very realistic, keeping the realism at the essence of the suspense still gripping. It also contains some of the best performances ever put into a summer blockbuster. Everything as large as a brachiosaurus and small as a little hand gesture are finely crafted by everyone involved into perfection.<br /><br />It's a movie that shall never go extinct.<br /><br />--PolarisDiB</p></br><a href="../users/AY69ZK7G6CNYJ.html">AY69ZK7G6CNYJ</a><br/><p>An adventure 65 million years in the making... such is the tagline for Jurassic Park, the onscreen adaptation of Michael Crichton's wildly successful novel about the human-aided return of dinosaurs to planet Earth. One of Steven Spielberg's greatest achievements, Jurassic Park was, and remains, a special effects masterpiece unrivaled by its peers. Dinosaurs roam the plains and scour the forests against the backdrop of conductor John Williams's original score (some of the best music of his career, which is saying a lot). Unlike the Godzilla movies of years past, you can't see human hands or construction paper props in the background of this movie. The computer generated creatures are so amazingly animated, that you'll finish the film believing that Jurassic Park is a real life destination...<br /><br />Dr. Alan Grant's (Sam Neill) life is dinosaur bones and the study of the various ancient reptiles that once dominated the Earth. He and his colleague Dr. Elli Sattler (Laura Dern) spend their days excavating the barren hills of South Dakota and loving every minute of it. But when Dr. Grant is approached by the eccentric multimillionaire John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) in regard to touring "something of great interest," the man's world of dinosaurs becomes more realistic than he ever thought possible.<br /><br />Hammond's creation is an isolated island called "Jurassic Park" where his company uses dinosaur DNA extracted from mosquitoes encased in amber during the Jurassic period many millennia before to clone dinosaurs. Prior to opening his park to the public, Hammond wants to take a number of experts on a tour of the facilities, among them are Grant and Sattler, a lawyer named Donald Gennaro (Martin Ferrero), and a mathametican/philosopher - Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum). When everyone but the lawyer expresses great reservations about the very idea of cloning dinosaurs (especially the carnivores), not to mention the safety concerns for an aspiring theme park, Hammond insists on putting their fears to rest personally.<br /><br />But John Hammond's dream goes terribly awry when a disgruntled computer programmer, Dennis Nedry (Wayne Knight of Seinfeld fame), compromises the island's security systems in order to smuggle some dinosaur embryos off the island, where a competing corporation has offered him a handsome monetary reward. Nedry's death, and the inadequate security systems of Jurassic Park, put the dangerous T-Rex and the lightning fast raptors on level ground with the island's human inhabitants. Now, Hammond and his guests no longer spend their idle time assessing the merits of Jurassic Park, but instead spend every waking minute fighting for their survival...<br /><br />You'll be hard pressed to find a film which rivals the brilliant special effects of Jurassic Park. The Star Wars films are the only movies even in the same league. But Jurassic Park also offers an interesting and compelling story, lots of action, and reams of suspense. Even an occasional lawyer joke helps to break up the intensity... Jurassic Park has it all. A summer blockbuster by a director who almost single-handedly invented summer blockbusters, Jurassic Park is a definite must-see movie. If you shy away from excessively commercial films, then make an exception for this one. I promise, you won't be disappointed...<br /><br />The DVD Report</p></br><a href="../users/A2M597GCCE1N2S.html">A2M597GCCE1N2S</a><br/><p>Lets face it, Congo and Sphere just both bombed one after the other, but Jurrasic Park sure showed what you can do with a great author's story when you combine it with a great director. Point taken that the movie does not follow the book, but I think it made it appear to people in another way of what might happen if someone of Crichton's level remade his story.<br /><br />Jurrasic Park is the story of a man named John Hammond, well in his senior years, who is a billionaire that decides to open a park on an island off the coast of Costa Rica. There is one difference with his park, or should I say, there is a big difference with his park.<br /><br />His park has full grown disonasuars, from herbivores to carnivores, any type you can name of, and some you might did not know even exist. To show that his park is safe, Hammond decides to invite several guests to his park for a special tour. They include two palenantologists, a mathematician, a lawyer from the company Hammond owns name InGen, and Hammonds own grandchildren.<br /><br />Sam Neil plays Alan Grant, the head hancho in my opinion, who is obsessed with dinosaurs and doesn't really know what to think of the park. Laura Dern plays Ellie Sattler, the second paleantologist, who thinks that the park isn't a good idea. And then you have the best character in the movie, again my opinion, Jeff Goldblum, whos plays Ian Malcom, who hates the idea of bringing the dinosaurs back to life.<br /><br />The park tour goes smoothly, if not for some sick triceratops and some no shows at some exhibits, but when a storm comes, and a park employee decides to cash in on the embryos with the Dino's DNA, thats when the movie gets really interesting.<br /><br />The Dinosaurs are some of the best special effects you will ever see, I guarantee it, even if you hate the plot you have to respect the power the dinos are shown in. A lot a mayhem, and a especially scary scene when the T-Rex gets out makes this a super chiller.<br /><br />But the good part of the movie are when the Velocoraptors get out, now they are the truly nasty son's of b*tches. And the Dinosaur that has a fin on his neck is trully creepy. [I know it sounds funny, but when you see it spit acid maybe you wouldn't want to meet it face to face afterall.]<br /><br />Luckily all the annoying people get killed; So if you think someone should just shut up when he or she talks don't worry, they probably will be silenced for good. Although I did like Samuel L Jackson's character in it, but why kill him off, he was cool. [Sorry if I ruined that part to those who haven't seen it]<br /><br />I enjoyed this movie, it truly is a classic, and if Spielburg directed, you know you will get your money's worth, no matter what happens in it. Also look for the incredible special effects, both terrifying and aw-inspiring, add all those things up and you have yourself a great movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A25ACLV5KPB4W.html">A25ACLV5KPB4W</a><br/><p>When it came out, this was the epitome of the action movie, boasting amazing visuals, a fascinating and almost-believable plot device, and creative editing that gave an interesting spin to action sequences, as when a car, suspended in a tree, drives down the tree in a freefall. The actors and characters are beneath the level of achievement of the filmmakers, but that hardly matters as we are treated to a host of scary dinosaurs in a pleasing variety. Today, the things that made the film special have become commonplace, but the meshing of elements still places it near the top of groundbreaking monster flicks.</p></br><a href="../users/A2VD2D1QHCMF9Q.html">A2VD2D1QHCMF9Q</a><br/><p>This is probably the most credible, most perfect concept in science fiction that I can recall.  All those saying that it can't possibly happen in real life have no imagination.  I have no doubt that the restoration of life from extinct genetic material will one day be possible, and that is what makes this movie so exciting.  The plot is secondary to the main ideas in the movie, and is not important.  Bravo to a great movie, with great effects.</p></br><a href="../users/A1J2931UBBJPXM.html">A1J2931UBBJPXM</a><br/><p>It's indeed rare when a movie comes along that is so special, and has such a tremendous impact on audiences of all ages, that when it happens, it's an occasion for celebration; which is exactly what Steven Spielberg gave the world with "Jurassic Park," a film that made the impossible possible:  It enabled dinosaurs to walk among us.  He put these monsters from a bygone era on the screen for all to see, and the unique thing about it was that they were real; so real you could reach out and touch them it seemed.  And in doing so he touched the imaginations of every child who sat there in the dark of a theater and watched his creations come to life, and he touched the child that still resides within every adult who came to see his show as well.  Jaded moviegoers and those who affect cynicism as a mission statement of life may scoff, especially now, after some time has passed and the magic has worn off somewhat, but it doesn't alter the fact that with this movie, Spielberg surpassed any and all standards of the cinematic world and set the precedent for all that would follow.  To borrow a line from one of his own characters, he "Spared no expense," and simply made one of the most exciting and memorable films in the history of the Silver Screen.  Spielberg pulled out all the stops to make this remarkable film, and it goes without saying that the special F/X are incredible; what's easy to overlook amid all the spectacle of it, however, are the performances turned in by one and all, and most notably by Jeff Goldblum, who brings such nuance and style to the role of Dr. Ian Malcolm.  It's a supporting role into which he immersed himself to create one of the more memorable characters in the film, and his performance-- with the countenance and attitude he lends to Malcolm, even the commanding, mesmerizing way he speaks-- has never received the attention it so richly deserved.  Nor has the performance of Richard Attenborough, as John Hammond, the entrepreneur who makes Jurassic Park a reality.  He's such a gifted performer that he makes you forget he's acting; Hammond becomes real, which makes what he's doing real, and it's just another example of the many things that add up to make this such an incredible movie.  Spielberg and his cast and crew have given such care to detail that it, in effect, releases the viewer from the baggage of even having to suspend disbelief because they're given a world that is "real" from the ground up.  The result of using all of the magic available, and using it wisely.  Also turning in outstanding-- and entirely believable performances-- are Sam Neill, as Dr. Alan Grant, and Laura Dern, as Dr. Ellie Sattler, each creating figures central to the plot and around whom much of the action revolves.  And there are a number of performances in supporting roles that are just too good to go unmentioned as well,  including Bob Peck, as Muldoon, the park's head gamekeeper; Martin Ferrero, as the "blood-sucking" lawyer, Donald Gennaro; Wayne Knight, as computer hacker Dennis Nedry; Samuel L. Jackson, as computer programmer Ray Arnold; and last, but not least, Joseph Mazzello and Ariana Richards as Hammond's grandchildren, Tim and Lex, through whose eyes the child in all of us vicariously experiences the wonders of Jurassic Park.  The wonderful thing about a movie like "Jurassic Park" is that, not only will it forever remain as a testimonial to a filmmaker of genius and vision, but that it will be there for all the generations that follow to discover anew.  The world may change drastically around us, even from one day to the next, but as long as even a single spark of imagination survives, one thing will always remain constant:  The fascination by children of all ages for these legendary beasts that once ruled the earth.  And that is why, when all is said and done and the skeptics have become no more than shadows and dust, this film-- as well as Steven Spielberg-- will remain a cause for celebration.  This is the legacy, and the true magic of the movies.</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>JURASSIC PARK is one of the best, if not the best, movies made about dinosaurs ever.  It's also one of only a handful of movies ever made based on a novel that was already in preproduction before the novel ever was released.  It's also one of the first movies to use CGI in significant scenes throughout the film.  It's also the movie that gave Sam Neill a break and reinvigorated the career of Jeff Goldblum.  The movie (promoted by the release of the novel about a year earlier) got the general public (and not just kids) excited about dinosaurs again and did to paleontology as a major what RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK did to archaeology.<br /><br />The premise, seeped in pop science, is that a multi-billionaire, John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) brings dinosaurs back to life by cloning the dino-DNA taken from mosquitoes trapped in amber.  He builds a zoological theme-park he calls Jurassic Park.  However, in order to call off a bunch of lawyers after an accident with one of the park's workers, Hammond has to get a group of scientific experts to endorse that the park is safe and viable.  Thus, Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill), Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern), and Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) arrive to tour the facilities.  Hammond's grandchildren, Lex (Ariana Richards) and Tim Murphy (Joseph Mazzello), are also along for the ride as test subjects.  Due to a hurricane and the shenanigans of a greedy employee, the park experiences a major breakdown and the dinosaurs get loose.<br /><br />JURASSIC PARK set records upon its initial release in 1993 and it isn't difficult to see why.  The CGI effects that have become common in just about every movie since then were in their infancy then, yet the creatures appear completely lifelike.  Of course, Spielberg not only used CGI but he had some live action dinos and models involved as well.  It was a massive undertaking, but one that had a huge payoff.<br /><br />There's not much to complain about with JURASSIC PARK.  Sam Neill is great as Dr. Grant (the role was originally offered to Harrison Ford and I'm actually glad he turned it down) and Jeff Goldblum is almost always a delight to watch on screen.  After 15 years of directing his own movies, Richard Attenborough came back for the perfect part as John Hammond.  The action sequences in the film are still as exciting to watch as they were when the film first was in theatres.  The movie is classic Spielberg and those are some of the best movies ever made.<br /><br />This DVD includes a very informative documentary about the making of JURASSIC PARK, some clips from an early production meeting (it's probably the closest an average person can come to meeting the real Spielberg), some storyboards and other illustrations, Phil Tippett's Animatic of the "Raptors in the Kitchen" sequence showing the raptors as they were originally conceived with having lizard-like tongues, trailers for all three JURASSIC PARK movies, a dinosaur encyclopedia featuring the dinosaurs seen in the movie, some production notes, and a list and partial filmography of the cast & crew.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FDW1SPYKB354.html">A1FDW1SPYKB354</a><br/><p>I believe that Steven Spielberg's original &#34;Jurassic Park&#34; is the ultimate dinosaur flick. It is a truly &#34;fun&#34; movie experience from start to finish. And evidently a bunch of other folks agree with me, because &#34;Jurassic Park&#34; earned approximately 357-Million dollars at the box office after premiering in movie theaters on June 11, 1993, placing the film in the Top 10 of all-time money-makers in motion-picture history (as of this writing, the film ranked #10).<br /><br />Spielberg was making &#34;Jurassic&#34; at precisely the same time he was also directing the emotionally-draining &#34;Schindler's List&#34;, which is a film that would go on to win the 1993 &#34;Best Picture&#34; Academy Award. Talk about a large workload! But Mr. Spielberg seemed to thrive on this juggling act of making two pictures at virtually the same time. And both movies came out in fine shape too, a fact which is backed up by the accolades (and huge box-office numbers) each movie garnered. (&#34;Schindler's&#34; earned just under $100-Million at the U.S. box office; and approximately $321-Million in worldwide release.)<br /><br />The personal storylines that were written for &#34;Jurassic Park&#34; are a smidge on the weak side, true. But that doesn't really matter all that much in the final analysis -- because the movie is so much fun otherwise! And the choice of actor Jeff Goldblum to play the part of &#34;Dr. Ian Malcolm&#34; was the best casting decision made for the whole picture, in my view. He adds a lot of humor to the film.<br /><br />I've liked Mr. Goldblum in everything I've ever seen him in; and the &#34;Jurassic Park&#34; films are no exception (he reprised his role as &#34;Ian&#34; in the second &#34;Jurassic&#34; picture as well). His dry humor and easy-going style come across nicely in this film. Such as his humorous line: &#34;Yeah, I'm always on the lookout for a future ex-Mrs. Malcolm.&#34; And, of course, THE funniest moment in the movie, when Ian/Jeff utters the hilarious line of dialogue that I've used as the title of this review (after narrowly escaping a rather large predator in a high-speed chase). LOL!  :-)<br /><br />Plus, yet another witty Goldblum-ism (reacting to a disappointing dinosaur-less tour of the park): &#34;Now, John, you will eventually be having DINOSAURS on your dinosaur tour, right? Right?&#34; :)<br /><br />Mr. Spielberg blends a great deal of comedy in with what should be a major calamity --&#62; dinosaurs coming back to life and running free, spreading death and destruction! Sounds pretty serious, right? Well, it is -- but Spielberg manages to lighten up this scenario skillfully, with several humorous scenes. Besides the aforementioned funny Jeff Goldblum moments, there's also &#34;The Guy On The Toilet Meets Dino&#34; scene; as well as the nerdish computer programmer (played nicely by Wayne Knight), who gets way more than he's bargained for in the end.<br /><br />The great John Williams composed the music score for &#34;Jurassic Park&#34; -- and it fits the movie like a glove. I don't know how Mr. Williams keeps doing it, coming up with first-rate musical scores for film after film -- but he does. Amazing.<br /><br />This Universal Studios single-disc &#34;Collector's Edition&#34; DVD of &#34;Jurassic Park&#34; offers up great picture and sound -- via a full and booming Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround soundtrack and a handsome Widescreen (1.85:1) Anamorphic video transfer. Those pre-historic beasts really &#34;come alive&#34; while watching this DVD.<br /><br />A generous helping of Special Features is dished out by Universal, too -- with the top prize in the package being the very informative behind-the-movie documentary featurette, &#34;The Making Of Jurassic Park&#34; (hosted by James Earl Jones). Mr. Spielberg has lots of on-camera time during this eye-opening featurette, explaining much of the creative work that went into getting this film to the movie screen.<br /><br />This Making-Of program throws the viewer right into the center of Steven Spielberg's movie-making process. Included are many details about the computer-generated effects, which were quite new and untested in the motion-picture industry at the time of the film's production in late 1992 and 1993, making &#34;Jurassic Park&#34; a true pioneering film in many &#34;CGI&#34; ways.<br /><br />Other bonus items on the disc include: An &#34;animatics&#34; feature, storyboards, production photographs, design sketches and paintings, theatrical trailers, DVD-ROM stuff, a &#34;Dinosaur Encyclopedia&#34;, and some cast-&-crew text notes.<br /><br />Additional Data Concerning This DVD .....................<br /><br />&#62; French language soundtrack included (in Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround).<br /><br />&#62; Subtitles in Spanish.<br /><br />&#62; Running Time for Main Feature = 2 hrs., 7 min.<br /><br />&#62; MPAA Rating -- PG-13.<br /><br />&#62; Any Paper Insert(s)? -- Yes, a 4-page mini-booklet, with some behind-the-scenes pics and a Chapter List (20 total scene selections).<br /><br />----------------------<br /><br />Parting Jurassic Thoughts ...................<br /><br />There's a certain &#34;magic&#34; that emanates from &#34;Jurassic Park #1&#34; -- with its three main ingredients for success (and fun) being: Director Steven Spielberg, John Williams' terrific score, and those first-of-their-kind computer-generated images that we see on screen, which make the dinosaurs seem, almost literally -- alive!<br /><br />The &#34;Jurassic&#34; sequels that were released in 1997 and 2001 were, IMO, okay films in their own right. But you can't top the original.</p></br><a href="../users/A1T3O2LILVK0C4.html">A1T3O2LILVK0C4</a><br/><p>Steven Spielberg's filmmaking career could almost be divided into two categories: adventure and drama. In 1993 he managed to release films in both genres. First came Jurassic Park, a science fiction adventure based on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0345370775">Michael Crichton's brilliant novel</a> and then came <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00012QM8G">Schindler's List</a>, a Holocaust drama based on the haunting book by Thomas Keneally. Spielberg's filmed versions of these two stories were groundbreaking. Jurassic Park set a new standard for special effects in moviemaking, while Schindler's List proved that Spielberg could tell a serious, emotional story.<br />With Jurassic Park Spielberg had to overcome the gargantuan challenge of creating realistic, believable, lifelike dinosaurs that would share the screen with actors. There were a number of approaches that he considered for bringing the prehistoric titans to life. His first idea was to use full-size animatronic robots for all of the dinosaurs, but this was too costly and too dangerous to do (not to mention highly unrealistic as it would have required years of technicians developing new mechanical elements). His second idea was to use "go-motion" animation (a variation of stop-motion animation, in which a model is photographed one frame at a time in order to create the illusion of movement) to create the dinosaurs, but this proved to be too time consuming and lacked the photo-realism that he was striving for. Spielberg then gathered together some of the greatest minds in the special effects field. He and Dennis Muren, Phil Tippett, Stan Winston, and Michael Lantieri discussed the possibilities. Dennis Muren, who had just worked on the revolutionary computer-generated T-1000 character in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008PC2O">Terminator 2</a>, suggested that CG (Computer-Generated) dinosaurs might be their best bet. Spielberg was desperate for a quick solution so he told Muren to show him what could be done with CGI (Computer-Generated Imagery) and Muren shocked Spielberg with a film clip showing skeletal dinosaurs running through a field. A later test, which was even more impressive, showed a tyrannosaurus rex stalking for its prey in the harsh sunlight (one of the most difficult illusions to create because of  the precision needed for believable lighting, reflectivity and shadows). Spielberg gave Muren the go-ahead and film history was made. Utilizing Dennis Muren's computer effects, Stan Winston's animatronics, and Phil Tippett's understanding of realistic movement they set out to create naturalistic dinosaurs. They even consulted Jack Horner, an esteemed paleontologist, to assist them in their efforts.<br />In June of 1993 the highly anticipated film was released to eager audiences. Both audiences and critics were blown away by the most realistic depictions of dinosaurs ever caught on film, but not everyone was wowed by the film itself. Some critics felt that the story was oversimplified, that the philosophical subtext of the novel was lost, and that the characters were shallow and uninteresting. Even so, the film was a worldwide success and spawned two sequels (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004U8JV">The Lost World: Jurassic Park</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXXS">Jurassic Park III</a>) and a boom in movie merchandising.<br /><br />The story focuses on an eccentric capitalist, John Hammond, who uses modern science to genetically engineer living dinosaurs from cloned DNA. He plans to open an amusement park on a remote island near Costa Rica, where people can observe and study these ancient leviathans for a price. However, Hammond is suffering from legal setbacks. His investors have doubts about the park's safety, so Hammond invites Alan Grant, a paleontologist and Ellie Sattler, a paleobotanist to visit and endorse the park. Also along for the ride are Ian Malcolm, a charismatic mathematician and an expert on Chaos Theory and Donald Gennaro, an irritatingly skeptical and greedy lawyer. Hammond even invites his two young grandchildren, Lex and Tim, saying that they are the target audience and therefore perfect to prove the potential allure of the park. But it's not long before Malcolm is proven right and chaos engulfs that island. One of Hammond's employees, Dennis Nedry, betrays him and steals dinosaur embryos, which he plans to sell to a rival research company. In order to obtain the embryos, Nedry turns off the park's automated security system. Naturally the dinosaurs escape and Jurassic Park ceases to be wonder to its visitors and begins to terrify them. During a tropical storm Alan and the two children are separated from the rest of the tour group and their weekend excursion becomes a frightening struggle for survival. Can they survive monstrous predators from the prehistoric past?<br /><br />Though the film doesn't match Spielberg's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0008KLVG4">Jaws</a> in its portrayal of complex characters facing a primal force, it does succeed as an intense sci-fi thriller that will stun its viewers. The talented cast includes Sam Neill as Alan Grant, Laura Dern as Ellie Sattler, Jeff Goldblum as Ian Malcolm, Richard Attenborough as John Hammond, Ariana Richards as Lex, and Joseph Mazzello as Tim. Other cast members include Samuel L. Jackson, Bob Peck, Martin Ferrero, B.D. Wong, and Wayne Knight.<br /><br />The DVD includes the following bonus materials: The making of Jurassic Park documentary, early pre-production meetings, animatics sequence, storyboards, dinosaur encyclopedia, production notes, cast and filmmakers' bios, and theatrical trailers for all three Jurassic Park films.<br /><br />I also recommend the beautifully evocative <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000002OOY">soundtrack by John Williams</a>.</p></br><a href="../users/AJMU8VVFKMZI4.html">AJMU8VVFKMZI4</a><br/><p>But not because it is a great script.  It's not really.  An amusement park ride from hell-is all that's on paper.  What will make this a Classic is the ground-breaking Computer graphic animation.  When I first saw this film in the theater, I was completely blown away.  Some think that this particular art as been approved upon--I don't hold that same opinion.  I see too many movies where you can tell what is real and what is fake.  This movie--everything looks REAL and for this film-there lies the horror.  Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/AV5G37VFE5NVD.html">AV5G37VFE5NVD</a><br/><p>Who hasn't heard of JURASSIC PARK?  While ranking among the top of the highest-grossing films list, it also brought Spielberg back into the spotlight (as did the same year's SCHINDLER'S LIST) and surpassed any special effect previously filmed.  JURASSIC PARK, which was very loosely adapted from the best-seller by Michael Crichton, follows a group of scientists who successfully clone dinosaurs for a theme park - from there, of course, everything goes haywire.  Sam Neill and Laura Dern are two paleontologists who unexpectingly end up as advisors to the park; Jeff Goldblum is the advising mathematician; and Richard Attenborough is the child-like owner and creator of the park.  Neill is especially good and would later appear in JURASSIC PARK III; Goldblum is funny and would later appear in THE LOST WORLD: JURASSIC PARK, the first sequel.  Spielberg's directing is very good, but unfortunately not some of his best; the thrilling screenplay is by Michael Crichton (from his novel) and David Koepp; then there's one of John Williams' greatest scores.  Of course, the true highlights of the film are the dinosaurs; they are some of the most realistic special effects ever seen in cinema (those effects would later be surpassed in JURASSIC PARK III).  JURASSIC PARK certainly doesn't rank among Williams' best, but it's an exciting film and a landmark in the special effects industry.</p></br><a href="../users/A1A87TUBBDPMF0.html">A1A87TUBBDPMF0</a><br/><p>Jurassic Park, Steven Spielberg's 1993 blockbuster based on Michael Crichton's technothriler about cloned dinosaurs running amok on a Costa Rican island, is still an exciting journey of the imagination, even though it's been 10 years since its theatrical release. Although its computer-generated effects have been surpassed over the past decade, Jurassic Park's tale of a misguided science experiment fueled by one man's ambition to create the ultimate theme park still packs a Jaws-like mixture of chills and thrills.<br /><br />As in Crichton's novel, the story revolves around eccentric billionaire John Hammond's (Sir Richard Attenborough) plan to convert Isla Nublar into a tourist attraction that would put all the Disney theme parks to shame. With all the resources of his InGen Corporation, a major genetics research company, Hammond has built a huge entertainment complex/luxury resort/wildlife preserve. But unlike similar resorts in Africa where tourists go on ecologically-friendly safaris to see lions and elephants, Hammond's scientific team has done the seemingly impossible...and cloned dinosaurs.<br /><br />After an incident in which a worker falls prey to a velociraptor (in a sequence that pays homage to Jaws, Spielberg's first megahit), InGen's board of directors gets antsy and demands that the Isla Nublar complex, Jurassic Park, be inspected by a team of experts to ensure the park's viability and safety. Otherwise, says InGen attorney Gennaro (Martin Ferrero) "if I'm not convinced, they're not convinced," and Jurassic Park will be shut down.<br /><br />Hammond, determined to open his ambitious dream park, recruits paleontologist Alan Grant (Sam Neill), paleobotanist Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) and chaos theorist Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) to assess Jurassic Park's safety and viability. Grant and Sattler are swayed to go by Hammond's offer to fund their Montana dig for another year, but Malcolm is openly skeptical. Hammond's dream, he thinks, is a natural time bomb ticking inexorably away, waiting to explode.<br /><br />Worse yet, Hammond has invited his grandchildren Tim and Lex (Joseph Mazziello and Ariana Richards) to visit, ostensibly to help them cope with their parents' divorce, but mainly to prove  his confidence in the park's security features.<br /><br />Little does Hammond know, however, that his dream park is doomed from various threats. Out to sea, a hurricane approaches Isla Nublar from the east. Inside the park itself, greedy computer technician Dennis Nedry (Seinfeld's Wayne "Newman" Knight) plans to shut down the security systems to be able to steal dinosaur embryos at the behest of a rival genetics company. Worse, one of the techniques to enable the cloning of the dinosaurs -- a scientific short cut -- is backfiring badly, even though InGen's top geneticist Dr. Wu (B.D. Wong) is unaware of it.<br /><br />When all these elements converge, things go dreadfully wrong on Isla Nublar, and when humans and dinosaurs interact, disaster follows, ending Hammond's ambitious and arrogant science experiment to the sounds of roaring T-rexes and hissing velociraptors.<br /><br />While not Spielberg's finest achievement ever (Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan and the Indiana Jones movies are better), this is still a fun movie to watch, especially on a lazy, hot summer evening. It is exciting and suspenseful, and like its close cousin Jaws, is better than the novel that inspired it, thanks to a crisp screenplay by Crichton and David Koepp. Adding to the magic are, as expected, composer John Williams and the techno-wizards at Industrial Light and Magic, Stan Winston's live action dinosaur crew, and all the rest who labored on this film. Even more amazing, Spielberg also gave us Schindler's List later that same year, proving his talents in organization and creativity...and diversity as a director.<br /><br />The Universal DVD Collector's Edition includes the 1993 blockbuster which was the biggest box office hit until Titanic was released in 1997, various making-of featurettes, exclusive DVD-ROM features, and the usual extra features (theatrical trailers, cast and crew credits, and production notes).</p></br><a href="../users/AOVJYIUATQKR5.html">AOVJYIUATQKR5</a><br/><p>This is the almost perfect scarey movie.  everyone loves dinos.

In ten years JURASSIC PARK has become a contemporary classic and spawned two sequels.  It's definitely among Spielberg's most fun films ever made and one of my favorites.<p>JURASSIC PARK, adapted from Michael Crichton's runaway best-seller, is the tale of a group of everyday people (including a chaos specialist and two paleontologists) who journey to a Costa Rican island to see the brainchild of John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) - an amusement park that stretches across the entire island and is of yet top secret.  Disney World copy?  Not so, because this amusement park is home to walking, roaring, breathing and hungry dinosaurs.  Emphasis on hungry.<p>The animatronics are perfect, along with Spielberg's always great directing.  Michael Crichton and David Koepp write the suspenseful screenplay from Chrichton's novel; the cast is also very good (especially Sam Neill and Jeff Goldblum, who would both return in the sequels), not to mention John Williams' always terrific score.  Williams' score really stands out in this one.<p>JURASSIC PARK is definitely a magnificent film and will continue to entertain us for generations to come.  In fact, it's one of the most entertaining films in years.  But don't listen to me jabber about it.  Go see this wonderous thriller for yourself.<p>OVERALL: 4 [Nearly a Masterpiece] out of 5 [Perfect]</p></br><a href="../users/A2XVRCU5DQBULH.html">A2XVRCU5DQBULH</a><br/><p>This is one of my all-time favorite films. Let me just lay that out. This one rules. Hopefully, you've seen it by now and if you haven't you must. This techno-savvy thriller from Steven Speilberg doesn't follow its source novel to the letter, but it's just as fun to watch this movie as it is to read the (very good) book. It's about a theme park gone horribly wrong. The test tourists exploring the dinosaur park soon become dino fodder for the main attractions. This is an immensely fun movie, and is just as deserving to be called a classic as Speilberg's &quot;Jaws&quot; and &quot;E.T.&quot; The special effects are still incredible. That scene with the brontosaurus still sends chills down my back. It looks so real! There are plenty of mistakes in this movie, but they're mostly continuity stuff or little things. All the important stuff they got right. Speilberg is a master behind the camera, and &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; proves why. This is a must-see.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZTSOBAPOWT3.html">A1ZTSOBAPOWT3</a><br/><p>Scientists have played the role of God and recreated dinosaurs with old fossils. Too bad they couldn't do something more resourceful by finding cures to diseases. Man! Oh well, the most brilliant people in the country flock to Jurassic Park to be the first to walk through the park. Everything seems fine and dandy at first, but a big, fat jerk tries to steal D.N.A. samples to sell it to a smuggler. He ruins everything because he's not in shape and the dinosaurs break out of their quadrants. A Tyrannosaurus Rex eats a guy off of a toilet, chases a speeding jeep, and then eats other dinosaurs/animals. What's the matter kid? You don't like lamb chops? Little Timmy is smarter than the adults. Alan Grant doesn't like children, I can see why. Ian Malcolm talks funny and he looks like my friend. Too bad they didn't use Arnold Schwarzenegger to save the day. Can you imagine? However, Steven Spielberg did a fine job of directing and fans won't be disappointed.</p></br><a href="../users/AAI57M3OXP5NK.html">AAI57M3OXP5NK</a><br/><p>This is pure entertainment at its best.

If you want a movie you really want to enjoy then this is the movie for you.  The next two sequels proved to be far less entertaining and more boring than the original.</p></br><a href="../users/A2W00XKTTF1G0Z.html">A2W00XKTTF1G0Z</a><br/><p>What more can be said about Jurassic Park than has already hasn't been said? The movie was phenomenal. When I saw it in the theatre, I was amazed at how real the dinosaurs were. They were real looking and life-like and right in front of me on the screen.<p>The energy of the film was adventurous and who can forget Jeff Goldblums best line "at least when the ride breaks down the Prates don't eat the guests...". Sam Neil and Laura Dern were superbly cast in this film. The kids were charming and right on the money with their reactions.<p>Visually the film is eye candy. The mechanical effects of the creatures and the digital effects of some of the long shots made my mouth drop. The story is again simple but the plot is very obvious. Even Sir Richard Attenburough gives a stellar performance.<p>The DVD is filled with behind the scenes footage of the film and its production. The interviews with Spielberg, the cast and crew are very interesting.

The pacing is first-rate, the comedy is well done, and the special effects are........well, do I really need to say anything? They practically speak for the whole movie. And the cast is perfect; Sam Neil as Dr. Alan Grant (one of his best roles), Laura Dern as his partner, Jeff Goldblum as the eccentric Dr. Ian Malcolm (hence came the now-famous line &quot;Must go faster! Must go faster!&quot;, which he hillariously repeated three years later in &quot;Independence Day&quot;, which is just as good). The scenery and location are also A+ material, from dense jungles to wide open plains.<br /> I'm definitely going to get this on DVD...probably in the &quot;Jurassic Park Trilogy&quot; 3-pack boxed set. It's to bad the sequals weren't as good, but then again, they never are.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AY3EV2MFRFGG.html">A3AY3EV2MFRFGG</a><br/><p>Jurassic Park, while exciting and awesome in parts, is no Jaws.  The movie is really an excuse for Spielberg to mount the greatest Ray Harryhausen movie never made, and he succeeds far too brilliantly.  The commentary and conscious of Crichton's terrifying novel is disposed of in favor of easy thumbnail sketch characters and simplistic narrative tools to make the monster movie machine hum right along.  Once the dinosaurs do get loose the movie drops any pretense of developing or even caring about the 'characters' and invites the audience to simply enjoy the spectacle of the attacks.  The pioneering effects may make this an essential in some collections, but the lack of dramatic weight makes it no more effective that its 1950s drive-in cinema cousins The Black Scorpion or The Deadly Mantis.  Recommended just for the thrill of it all.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JH5J1KQAUBMP.html">A1JH5J1KQAUBMP</a><br/><p>Scientists learn how to recreate living dinosaurs via recovered DNA fragments, and a rich entrepreneur uses this knowledge to construct a prehistoric amusement park on a remote island.

Jurassic park is amazing and intriguing, a must see.</p></br><a href="../users/AK6UVFSU07NXH.html">AK6UVFSU07NXH</a><br/><p>Written by Michael Crichton, Jurassic Park is one of the big budget special effect jobs that the critics love to bag. So what! It's awe inspiring. The cinematography is nothing short of perfect.  The effects are  seamless and the action is heart stopping. On the less than brilliant side,  the characters were mainly two dimensional. Specifically, the lawyer was a  joke, (intentional but unnecessary). I just wish that the game warden's  character had been explored a little more.<br /><br />The plot is  straightforward. We have a scientific breakthrough that brings the  dinosaurs back to life after a much touted 65 million year absence.  Strangely, instead of scientific motivation, it has been created for  financial reasons. (-: A game park to be precise. But before it opens, the  backers want a run through with some experts, (and a couple of cute kids),  in order to check for safety.  It may well have been safe, except that the  one man programming company that set up the systems, (who by the way should  get the programming god of the century award), is selling out to the  baddies who want some dino-embryos.<br /><br />The next thing you know, T-rex  has escaped and is snacking on lawyers and the rest of the good guys are  battling it out against a pack of vicious Velociraptors. Lots of tension  and suspense here. But don't worry it is a Hollywood movie and therefore  gets a happy ending. Look out for the sequel, which if Crichton's novel is  any guide, will be a &quot;me too&quot; version of the first movie. Never  mind, the first one was good enough for two.</p></br><a href="../users/A3MCC5MAJYJYMD.html">A3MCC5MAJYJYMD</a><br/><p>This movie was an AWESOME AWESOME experience when it was released in the theatres.

After the critical and commercial failures of Always and Hook, Spielberg returns to form with one of the most astounding adventure films ever made.<p>Spielberg's dinosaur adventure is not his best film but it's up there with the all-time greats. Taken from Michael Crichton's thrilling novel, Jurassic Park is one of the most entertaining and exciting films ever made. The special effects are from FX maestro Stan Winston, who did the special effects for Aliens (1986) and Terminator 2 (1991). The seamless combination of CGI and robotic creatures creates some truly terrifying action set- pieces.<p>Despite what some critics thought when the film was released, I feel that all the principal actors give good performances, especially Sam Neill as Alan Grant and Jeff Goldblum as Dr. Ian Malcolm. But admittedly, the special effects are the main attraction, and Winston's dinosaurs (which won him another Oscar after Terminator 2) are truly frightening. Great entertainment. <p>The film's transfer onto DVD is first- rate, with superb picture and sound. The special features are exceptional, with a 50 minute 'making of' of the film and trailers for Jurassic Park, the Lost World and the teaser for Jurassic Park 3. Most interesting, however, is the footage of early pre-production meetings with Spielberg and the FX team discussing how certain shots and effects should be done. Also, there's a Phil Tippett animatic &quot;Raptors in the Kitchen&quot;, showing how claymation assists the director in visualising the shots and camera angles. Also there are storyboards, production photos and web links. A 5 star film, 5 star extras.

The movie inspired awe in anyone who first saw it in the theatres. this was the first time we have seen a REAL looking dino on the big screen. Richard Attenborough is a rich man who creates an island theme park full of cloned dinosaurs, and is one of the first films to deal with the serious issue of cloning. He invites a team of scientists to sign off on the island, which includes Sam Neill and Laura Dern as paleontologists as well as a mathamatician, played by Jeff Goldblum, and Attenboroughs 2 grandkids. Of course, the park breaks down, and the dinosaurs run amok, creating some of the best scenes in movie history. The special effects are good to this day, especially with the crisp clarity of the DVD picture and OUTSTANDING sound. There is also a load of extras, including trailers for all 3 films.</p></br><a href="../users/A2E3IB2ZHJ7QXJ.html">A2E3IB2ZHJ7QXJ</a><br/><p>Spielberg's Jurassic Park still stands on it's own as being a great film, nearly 20 years later after the film was first released.  While there has been tons and tons of movies that have used CGI and CGI has been commonplace everywhere, Spielberg's film still has the emotional power to stir and move like a legendary filmmaker should.  Jurassic Park will be the work of an aueter that keeps it from growing old, while so many films like it are now forgotten within a few years.  We all know that Spielberg's Jurassic Park is terrific entertainment, with thrills and chills on every corner.  But it also manages to be quite a powerful cautionary tale, doing something that films like Frankenstein still haven't been quite able to master.  Now how exactly can a film that made close to a billion and was a franchise starter and marketing powerhouse do that?<br /><br />This is why.  Michael Crichton book has more detail, science, and more ideological intelligence, but Spielberg's film has what Crichton's novel doesn't have: emotional intelligence to make his own viewpoints through behavior come across in a much more convincing way.  Behavior is real but an idea is not necessarily real.  Obviously, this is not an absolute, and the former can justify the reality of the latter, but this makes for a much more convincing and real argument.  Some people call this shallowness, but in my opinion, being able to paint the experience and emotional content of a complex emotional experience is not shallow, and Jurassic Park's scenes of consequence and danger are able do so, with kaleidoscopic emotion and<br /><br />The initial T-Rex scene, one of the most famous of them all, is a good example of this.  Spielberg directs the scene with danger, and the Dinosaur is absolutely primal, stripped down to it's instincts at dangerous cost.  This is a prime display of why Spielberg's Jurassic Park EXTREMELY succeeds in showing WHY tinkering with genetics can be so damn dangerous.  Spielberg also never sugar coats these animals abilities, reminding us of just how primal and vicious they can be.  These creatures can tear up a goat in half a second, they can find their way through environments looking for something to eat, stalk their pray and having no sense of right or wrong that humans do (like animals), and how these creatures are, all in all, extremely, extremely, EXTREMELY dangerous.  It's one reason why this is a valuable and piece of science-fiction, and why it's very much essential as much as other great films.<br /><br />Understandably, this is still a large budget thriller, with more thrills and chills than a roller coaster, but it's damn good one at that, made with talent and passion by Spielberg and company.  There are some underwhelming moments here and there, but some of these are overpowered by Spielberg's awesome visuals, spectacular sound design, and humanistic acting.  The CGI here, despite being somewhat stiff at times, recreates these Dinosaurs as you would expect, and there's a HUGE sense of AWE and BEING, LIFE, even nearly 20 years later.  But it's the sound of these creatures that works.  The ground shaking when a dinosaur lowers it's foot, the huge roars, and the primal ferocity of these animals that will send chills down your spine.  The bone chilling roar of the T-Rex makes you want to trample a city (seems fitting that Mastodon sampled it). I also think the production design is great as well, for what that's worth.  John Williams score is also amazing and uplifting.<br /><br />The character development is a little thin, but I think this is easily transcend with good performances.  Spielberg has a knack for being able to make his characters seem very real (no matter what other people try to convince me.  Nice try but you can't convince me), which really separates his ability from lesser hacks.  There's not a feeling of "cardboard" character, as they feel very much like what you would expect if you saw one of these people in life.  Even if you didn't have, Regarding the I give some props to Spielberg to not having a cloying "I'm ready for children I love THEM!" moment, but instead some subtly that shows Alan Grant's very realistic alleviation to his dislike of all children after finally opening his mind (or forced to, for a better word).  It's not too deep because characters are second, but it's got enough pathos to move you.<br /><br />I do think that Crichton's book is much more technical and layered, considering that he's a scientist and didn't have to work with David Koepp.  And I do think that the book obviously has value and does thing that Spielberg's film can't do (and vice-versa).  But the movie, for me, is better because it's just more convincing, and simply showing the is much more riveting and makes you think about the consequences of tinkering much more, simply because Spielberg.  On top of that, it has enough heart stopping moments to give, so that certainly doesn't hurt either.  I suggest reading the book to get more of the ideas and applying to the behavior on screen.<br /><br />It's too bad that Jurassic Park is considered to some to be a big soulless, dumb blockbuster film, because there's a lot here to chew on along with awesome special effects, entertaining performances, and white knuckle terror (this definitely isn't a film for young children).  Skip the sequel, as it's merely a cheap facsimile of this film, a big (and boring) budget monster movie with a 100 million dollar budget (the book isn't bad, although it was written more hastily because Spielberg pressured Crichton to write another book).  Whatever you do though, see this one for it's relevance and artistic intentions within one of the most well known pieces of entertainment.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VZLLDNLURGJB.html">A1VZLLDNLURGJB</a><br/><p>Jurassic Park rates five stars but only because that is full scale (I would award this movie 10 stars if I could)! Never have we seen anything like this fantastic film before. First off, with a great and seemingly plausible story by Michael Crichton, good casting and performances, and absolutely wonderful cutting edge CGI by ILM and the full scale creature effects of Stan Winston this movie will be very hard to ever top. The work that went into paleontology research, animal motion and design studies for the full scale dino work of Stan Winston made me feel like I now know what actual prehistoric animals look like in action.<br /><br />Most important was the basic story which was one of the best science fiction novels I have ever read. The author is reported to have discussed his cloning ideas with friends at MIT who were in agreement that the described approach seemed most plausible. I would expect the actual cloning of a mammoth to occur in our lifetime. Of course, only a Steven Spielberg and his great eye for composition, editing and direction could have pulled all the necessary talent together!  Hats off to Sam Neill and the entire cast for their great performances.  A movie experience this great only happens a couple of times in a movie goers lifetime.<br /><br />The documentary on the making of the film was also excellent and very informative, as well as the other extras provided on the DVD. Although many later new movies have incorporated credible dino CGI, the excellent detailmovies. This movie sets the new gold standard for state of the art CGI and full scale creature effects.</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>Well, I have to hand it to Steven Spielberg, even though he often annoys me. He made us pay attention to archeology and the Ark Of The Covenant; he educated us on Great White Sharks; he made us love an ugly little space alien and he even made Whoopi Goldberg look good. Wow, say what you will, the man has done some amazing things in the world of film. Here, he brings dinosaurs back to life and gives us another classic adventure story, unlike anything seen up to this time.<br /><br />I rank this one right up with the best of all-time among great adventure stories. Few people can forget how stunned they were when they viewed these life-like dinosaurs for the first time on screen. And who can forget the T-Rex in the first frightening scene and the Raptors in the last intense scene? This is truly memorable stuff. To this day, those scenes can still get your attention.<br /><br />The movie has always been fun to watch, and not just because of the thrills or special effects, of which there are too many to recite here. There is humor in here and characters are interesting, led by Richard Attenborough as the scientist who creates Jurassic Park. The kids in here - Joseph Mazello and Ariana Richards - do a fine job of acting, as good as the adults.<br /><br />The only thing left is to see this in high-definition Blu=Ray, which should bring another generation of fans to this innovative film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>'Jurassic Park' is on my list of the best movies to never recieve a 'Best Picture' nod at the oscars.  Now, some of you may not agree, and then some of you may.  I feel that 'Jurassic Park' is still one of the best films to ever grace the big screen.  Adapted (loosly) from Michael Crichton's novel of the same name 'Jurassic Park' delivers a solid script, solid acting and SOLID thrills that can not and will not be repeated (as is proven by the failed attempts in 'The Lost World' and 'Jurassic Park III', both of which are decent but nothing even close to the original)  Before the doors to the Amusement Park to end all Amusement Parks is opened, the owner ushers in a few experts to take one final look.  Amoung these experts is a Mathematician (Goldbloom) and dino-experts/Paleontologists (Dern and Neill).  Of course upon hearing that this park offers guests a chance to see extinct dinosours these experts are a bit (or I should say a lot) skeptical, but after their first glimpse at the finished product they are stunned.  The film quickly turns from awe and wonderment to fear and terror and it does so with smart and effective scenes and dialog, and what works so well here is that not only does it serve up great action and suspence but it also builds up the charactors and gives you a look into these people, creating a three dimentional cast and giving the veiwer a feeling of being there with these people as the try and survive.  One of the most effective thrill rides to date and well deserving of all the praise.  This is the film to beat.</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>It has been told so many times: we have withdrawn so far from Mother Nature that we tend to forget it. So, intrenched in our own modern Trojan world, we are trapped in our words `s jungle: even we dare to believe in certain imported mind terms with such strong that we use to think they exist.<br /><br />Jurassic Park is in last instance, the tempting Pandora `s box, the final choice and golden opportunity to recreate thanks our undeniable genetic advance, a part of the lost world in the night of the times, in our ancestral genes and the minutely investigation of scientists, investigators and Historians. Once more Michael Crichton  retook the ancient myth: to look behind , immersed in Orpheus punishment respect his wife,  Eurydice,  Lot `s woman in the Holy Scriptures and finally in Goethe `s Faust.<br /><br />The script is a bitter vision about the eternal and never satisfied love for the knowledge, to challenge the question: what if I ... ?  The final result was an admirable exercise of vivid and unconscious terror respect our antipodes, the recreation of a primitive world; a entry through the tunnel of the time to experience the primordial fears with its logical consequences.<br /><br />Perhaps the film made no use of the mythical load immersed within this post modernist tale. Maybe this punch would have been extremely profitable to achieve a striking picture where entertainment, and humor would have shaken hands with the mythical experience.<br /><br />A splendid cast delineates a kinetic plot with the secure and accurate vision of this unbeatable entertainment 's wizard: Steven Spielberg.</p></br><a href="../users/AQBRMBQ99ESI7.html">AQBRMBQ99ESI7</a><br/><p>Imagine an eccentric coming up with a way to resurrect the dinosaurs and then building a theme park around the idea. Imagine further that a couple of scientists get invited to look over the park before it opens. Imagine as a final step that the visitors, along with some kids, are on a tour of the park when a saboteur brings down the security systems and the giant monsters are let loose. The only thing left is the tremendous technical challenges to make all of these imaginings come to pass. Spielberg pulls it all off.<br /><br />It is a fight for survival when they are caught in the park when the power goes down. The only thing the people have going for them is their intelligence. Unfortunately, some of the dinosaurs are intelligent themselves. They can learn and they are hungry. They are also hacked off at being cooped up. Everyone has to run for it.<br /><br />The story presented in this film is interesting and fun to watch. Just as interesting and fascinating in its own right is watching these flights of fancy come to life on the screen. The dinosaur footage is worth the price of admission all by itself. It is truly miraculous. The dinosaurs are the real stars of this show. The excellent performances by all the rest of the cast are just the icing on the cake.<br /><br />This version of the DVD has a "Making Of" featurette.  This too is worth the admission.</p></br><a href="../users/AM2PV53UX1JEQ.html">AM2PV53UX1JEQ</a><br/><p>This movie contains some of the most laughable dialog in recent memory, as well as some of the most ridiculously bad performances EVER in a movie (the Laura Dern/Richard Attenborough scene over the ice cream is classic).  Yet  the terrors are great fun, and, though over-the-top with a typical  Spielberg flourish, deliver in spades.  I particularly love the raptors in  the kitchen and of course the T-Rex, whenever he/she appears.  But unlike  so many of Spielberg's other movies, this one has not held up in terms of  watching it over and over -- after two viewings, I am essentially DONE.  I  think the violence is extreme for kids, so if you are looking for something  for the family and have younger kids, wait a few years.  The special  effects still look terrific, and the basic conceit of dinosaurs somehow  being resurrected certainly inspires one with awe; too bad the populace and  script surrounding this idea are so often ignored. Since this movie was  being completed at the same time Steven was wrapping Schindler's List,  which is infinitely more considered, perhaps Steven figured it would still  make a gazillion dollars without too much attention to, oh, CHARACTERS or,  oh, PLOT.  He was right, of course.</p></br><a href="../users/A8F2AZWB20X1H.html">A8F2AZWB20X1H</a><br/><p>I can't remember looking forward to a movie more than &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; after having read the book umpteen times.  The movie does some justice to the book, and should have done a lot more.  The acting is adequate; the casting ranges from good to awful (I liked Jeff Goldblum as Ian Malcolm but Sam Neill was not, and is not, Alan Grant, and Laura Dern was terrible as Ellie Sattler), and the plot changes were unneccessary and detract from the story.  There was no need to make Ellie Grant's girlfriend; there's not enough fire between them to generate any interest; and the movie tried to take P.C. too far with the children and transformed the nerdy older boy and the bratty younger girl (she was so obnoxious in the book I wanted to feed her to a raptor) into the computer whiz older sister with a whiny little brother.  If it weren't for the dinosaurs, the movie would be a washout.  But the dinosaurs save the day.  The computer effects are so breathtaking that one wants to drop the popcorn and gasp, good goshamighty, those are REAL DINOSAURS!!  The dinosaurs, in fact, have more personality than the people.  The tyrannosaurus is the tough guy on the block and the raptors are the boyz in the hood, lean mean killing machines.  I would have liked to see some more plant-eaters (a stegosaur or two would have been nice) but what there was, was terrific -- the gallimimus stampede is so real it makes you want to duck down in your seat, and there's a hilarious spot when the girl goes &quot;kitchy-koo&quot; to a brachiosaurus, and the reptile responds by saying &quot;achoo&quot; and spraying a gallon of brachioboogers into her face.  The movie's ending is far more upbeat than the book, anticipating &quot;Jurassic Park 2&quot;, and the dark undertone of the book, that playing God is one of man's worst mistakes, somehow doesn't come across as strongly in the film.  But the dinosaurs are a miracle in themselves, and make the movie the ultimate fun ride it is.</p></br><a href="../users/A356HRZZFCEGL1.html">A356HRZZFCEGL1</a><br/><p>*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />You don't need me to tell you that "Jurassic Park" (hereafter JP) has indelibly embedded itself into humanity's collective consciousness. You don't have to be a paleontology or prehistoric animal or dinosaur buff (as I am), or have seen JP in the theater after waiting at 10 p.m. in insanely snaky long lines (as I did) or own the VHS video or Michael Crichton novel that inspired JP (as I do) to appreciate the movie's special status in movie lore as the source of realistically animated extinct beasts. Yep, JP is immortal. But it is not perfect. Why? Well, it's the insidiously asinine and anticlimactic climax!<br /><br /> Our intrepid team has cleverly eluded the velociraptors throughout the extended chase sequence at the island center culminating in the atrium with the Tyrannosaurus skeleton. However, the cunning theropods have surrounded the team. How does the team escape? One more brilliant plan? No! The T-rex which battered and spit out the tour jeeps earlier in the movie materializes behind them out of nowhere to chomp on and spit out the raptors and smash his skeletal relative, and provide the necessary distraction for our crew to flee!!! Our toothy savior! Wow, how does a 3-7 ton salivating monster sneak up behind you unnoticed? How did he get into the atrium anyway? Presumably, he must have broken through a back wall. But why? What is his motivation? Why chase puny humans when he has his pick of fleshy hadrosaurs, ornithomimids, or ceratopsians to hunt? Admittedly, the sequence is exciting, but it really is just a dumb version of the "god (dinosaur) in the machine".<br /><br />I understand Spielberg was so impressed with the T-Rex that he couldn't resist bringing it back for the JP climax. Shame on him! He should have resisted the urge. Even the center exploding would have been a better climax.<br /><br />Is it too late to make or discover an alternate ending?<br /><br />P.S.:  JP does not have many illogical scenes, but another one recently came to mind.  Of course, everyone remembers the glass of water rippling from the T-Rex's vibrating footsteps.  God knows I love monsters that can make the ground vibrate with their footsteps.  However, the T-Rex stomping around like Godzilla really does not make much sense.  Everyone knows that if a predator wishes to capture prey, it does not announce its presence until the very last second, when the prey has no chance of escape.  Any unusual noise, like STOMPING, would scare the prey away.</p></br><a href="../users/A2I6MHMAZZDCRX.html">A2I6MHMAZZDCRX</a><br/><p>John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) has come up with the most incredible idea for a theme park yet.  He has found a way to clone dinosaurs.  He's thought of all the controls to keep the population in check and the dangerous ones under control.<br /><br />Unfortunately, his investors aren't sure that the park is safe.  So, before he can open it, he has to bring in dinosaur experts Alan Grant and Ellie Sattler (Sam Neill and Laura Dern) and chaos theorist Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) to sign off on the park.<br /><br />The three are admittedly impressed by what they see, especially Alan and Ellie.  But the wonder soon turns to horror when security goes down, freeing the creatures.  Suddenly, the group finds themselves stranded on an island in a storm fighting to survive these creatures from the past.  Will any of them make it off the island alive?<br /><br />This movie was one of the first to use computer effects, and it revolutionized the industry.  Frankly, these effects still hold up even today.  You'll really believe that these people are interacting with the dinosaurs.<br /><br />The biggest weakness is the story.  It starts out very slowly while the science is explained.  There's lots of talking in the first hour.  Once the dinosaurs get loose, the movie kicks into high gear and becomes an edge of your seat thrill ride.  It doesn't matter how many times I've seen it, I still get knots in my stomach during most of these scenes.  Unfortunately, the climax is again weaker then it could have been.<br /><br />I have never understood why this movie was marketed at kids with fast food tie-ins and action figures.  This isn't a kid's film.  It's downright scary for at least half the length.<br /><br />Despite the weaknesses in the story, this is still a well deserved classic.  If you haven't seen it, you're in for a heart pumping thrill ride.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZVERVFM25MJT.html">A2ZVERVFM25MJT</a><br/><p>Whilst obviously comparable to Spielberg's other big monster movie, 'Jaws', this is still excellent in its right.  Based on the Michael Crichton novel it retains the barest threads of the scientific argument.  Indeed, this argument is mostly represented by Jeff Goldblum who is rapidly demoted to a back seat.  That's not too important though seen as this is the kind of movie that manages to genuinely fascinate its audience with its outstanding special effects.  Even several years on, the sight of the T-Rex clawing its way past metal fencing remains spectacular.<p>Basically this is a rollercoaster ride and little else but for what it is, 'Jurassic Park' is great fun.  Placing its little humans in various apparently inescapable situations seems to be the story, but what situations they are!  There's a car falling through a tree inch by inch, a huge T-Rex and a particularly nasty little one that seems cute and innocent at first.  Most impressively though, it remains pretty scary.  Rather than overusing the big T-Rex, the raptors are much scarier and more efficient at making the audience jump.  One particularly well constructed scene has two kids hiding out in a kitchen which is being stalked by two vicious raptors.<p>The acting, as in many movies like this, is incidental.  Neill plays a pretty flat main character, Dern excels as a feisty archaeologist, the kids are good value, Goldblum is fun whilst Attenborough doesn't appear to do anything.  Most importantly though 'Jurassic Park' grips from the very beginning and will keep you on the edge of your seat.  It's not the most complicated movie ever,..., but it's definitely thrill-packed.</p></br><a href="../users/A34W7QA4J5UTOR.html">A34W7QA4J5UTOR</a><br/><p>Classic man against nature conflict.

This is a great movie even after all this time.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VV4GUGLUVUP1.html">A3VV4GUGLUVUP1</a><br/><p>Mega-blockbuster about people and the dinosaurs who eat them. Actually, it's more about the dinosaurs, which makes it ultimately a disappointment. Ironically, this movie about a theme park shares all their flaws: it's exciting, but ultimately, it's a shallow experience. <p> Based on the effective Michael Crichton novel, &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; is about a group of people trapped on an island amusement park where biotechnologists have resurrected childhood's favorite scary monsters. Sam Neill is a bland paleontologist who hates kids- guess who he bonds with in the park? Well, it ain't Vegas showgirls (although that would've made for a more interesting film). Laura Dern, easily the best actor in the movie, flounders without a character to play; she mostly giggles and mumbles. Samuel L. Jackson goes to waste (literally, after the dinos eat him) and Wayne Knight pretty much plays his &quot;Seinfeld&quot; character, Newman.  <p> There's one scene in particular that illustrates the major problem with this movie. Paleobotanist Dern studies a leaf and mutters how this &quot;shouldn't be here&quot; and how it's extinct, until Neill taps her shoulder, which causes her to look up and see a giant brachiosaur for the first time. Behind her, everyone else is already reacting to the as-yet unseen brachiosaur.  <p> The only reason she's looking at a leaf in the first place is so Spielberg can build suspense by delaying the dinosaur revelation. But in order to do this, they have to give her a reason to be so fascinated- ergo, extinct plant. Enter plot hole, in the service of audience manipulation. Did the Jurassic Park engineers also clone extinct plants? Or did they just happen to find an island with extinct plant life? And if it's not important, why introduce it in the first place?  It's a manipulative trick that's shocking in its clumsiness. <p> It's not that manipulation itself is a bad thing (Alfred Hitchcock was an admitted arch-manipulator)- it's just &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; does poorly so many of the things that makes a movie great. Think of &quot;Jaws,&quot; another Spielberg movie about a fangs; it's one taut bit of filmmaking. Not a bit of fat on the bones, not a wasted scene, even when they're not pursuing the shark.  <p> With &quot;Jaws,&quot; and Hitchcock's &quot;The Birds,&quot; you can forgive very dated effects because the people in the film are so believable and memorable, and the manipulation isn't so cynical or transparent. Despite photo-realistic dinos, &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; has no more reality to it than &quot;Pirates of the Carribbean,&quot; which is referenced in one of the few intentionally funny bits of dialogue.  <p> <p> That said, &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; is fun for casual viewing, and I find it remarkable Spielberg pulled it off at all while also working on &quot;Schindler's List.&quot;  Plus, there are two very effective set-pieces: the tyrannosaur attack on the tour cars, and the velociraptors-in-the-kitchen sequence; here, Spielberg uses his tricks to perfection. It's just a shame they're in the service of a special effects fest that's so... unspecial.</p></br><a href="../users/A1I7QGUDP043DG.html">A1I7QGUDP043DG</a><br/><p>I'm trying to decide which of the three I love the best, but all should be part of one's home library.

And while he may not always be successful at it (1941 and HOOK being examples), he is successful far more often than not.  JURASSIC PARK, based on Michael Crichton's 1990 novel, is a prime example of Spielberg's abilities.<p>The story revolves around the dreams of an eccentric billionaire (Richard Attenborough) to construct an amusement park on an island 120 miles off of Costa Rica that features genetically engineered dinosaurs, created from cloning dinosaur DNA.  He invites two paleontologists (Sam Neill, Laura Dern) to the island to check it out for themselves, along with a hugely cynical &quot;chaos&quot; mathematician (Jeff Goldblum).  But while the park itself is overwhelming to its visitors, including Attenborough's two grandkids (Joseph Mazzello, Ariana Richards), there is a strong feeling that Attenborough and his fellow creators have left a few things out.<p>Then it hits.  An overly ambitious security expert (Wayne Knight) has involved himself in smuggling dinosaur embryos off the island for a competitor.  But the only way to pull it off is to shut down the entire park's security systems...which is exactly what happens, unfortunately.  With the fifty miles worth of electrified fences shut off, and a tropical storm lashing the island, the dinosaurs break free of their enclosures.  What results is some of the most terrifying and suspenseful sequences of 1990s cinema, from a director who clearly studied the techniques of the Master, Alfred Hitchcock.<p>Winner of three Oscars (Sound, Sound Effects Editing, Visual Effects) and a $1 billion box office winner to boot, JURASSIC PARK, scripted by Crichton and David Koepp, is a hugely entertaining and relevant science fiction/suspense thriller that, while giving audiences the requisite chills and thrills, also has a warning about the potential dangers of cloning, which now seem to be coming perilously true in reality.  Even well-meaning enterprises like this film's amusement park are susceptible to human failures or lapses of morality.<p>Neill, Dern, Goldblum, and Attenborough are pretty good in their roles; and, contrary to what others might think, I don't think the special effects overshadow them.  John Williams, yet again, provides Spielberg with another memorable music score.  Followed four years later by THE LOST WORLD: JURASSIC PARK (a very respectable sequel), and in 2001 by JURASSIC PARK 3.</p></br><a href="../users/A5TZXWU8AALIC.html">A5TZXWU8AALIC</a><br/><p>Steven Spielberg has directed some of the biggest and best movies ever made: JAWS, RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, SCHINDLER'S LIST, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN.<br /><br />But, when kids are involved in his movies, he indulges them and spoils them--and the movies are ruined by a deadly amount of The Cutes.<br /><br />Those first truly great movies I've mentioned all have one thing in common: no cute, adorable kids as main characters.<br /><br />Watch INDIANA JONES & THE TEMPLE OF DOOM, and compare it to RAIDERS and you'll see what I mean.  It's like Mr. Spielberg loses his genius-like ability to craft a film when cute kids show up on the set.  Still don't believe me?  One word: HOOK.<br /><br />Unfortunately, that's my major problem with JURASSIC PARK.<br /><br />Michael Crichton's original novel is a brilliant, well-oiled machine of a story.  Read it.  But although some of Crichton's excellent ethical arguments make it into the film, the menace and suspense of the original storyline are lost because Sam Neill's character has to warm up to the idea of having some cute, adorable kids himself.<br /><br />The priority of the novel was: Not To Get Eaten.<br /><br />The priority, at times, of the film appeared to be: Kids Are Just Too Darn Cute For Anyone to Resist Them.<br /><br />The best scene in the movie was also the most exciting chapter in the book: the first time we see the T-Rex tearing its way out of its pen and rampaging against the guests.<br /><br />The special effects were the real stars of this movie.  I wish they would've had more screen time.</p></br><a href="../users/A2E3F04ZK7FG66.html">A2E3F04ZK7FG66</a><br/><p>The biggest attraction of this film back in 1993, of course, was the realistic computer graphic animation of the dinosaurs by SGI coupled with the realistic sound effects and the good use of suspense built around them both. After I first saw this movie in the theatre 14 years ago, I laid in bed awake for hours, not from fright, but from the lingering excitement of the entire experience. Up to that time, nothing like it had ever been done on that scale. This is hard to remember when the Discovery Channel now has the whole "Walking with ..." series of documentaries on dinosaurs, early man, and creatures before the dinosaur that use the same techniques that this film did, and thus people have become accustomed to this level of realism in animation. Thus with the "shock value" of the animation removed, this movie doesn't seem quite as "5-star" as it did during its first run. The dialogue, in particular, seems a bit thin now. One aspect of the movie that still impresses me that doesn't get much mention is the outstanding use of sound and sound effects. For example, when the T-Rex first appears in the movie, it is not just the sight of the thing that terrifies, but its tremendous roar. It is still great action adventure viewing for the entire family, and the 50-minute documentary "The Making of Jurassic Park" was very interesting too. James Earl Jones narrates this extra feature in which the special effects are given particular attention and examination. The documentary also includes interviews with Steven Spielberg and Michael Crichton. There is also a "Dinosaur Encyclopedia" with several pages of information on every dinosaur that appeared in the film. Besides that, there are two or three other very short features on how particular scenes in the film were done. The best of these short features is "Raptors in the Kitchen", which, of course, talks about how the scene with the raptors stalking the children in the kitchen was done. Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A13TO1ZFAH9SVN.html">A13TO1ZFAH9SVN</a><br/><p>If you haven't seen Jurrasic Park yet you really need to crawl out from the rock you've been under for the last decade.<p>Off the coast of Costa Rica a wealthy business man is creating the theme park of all theme parks. He is secretly cloning dinosaurs and will soon feature them in this park. Before Hammond(Richard Attenborough) can open his park he must get it sponsored by the tops in the dinosaur and science fields. Alan Grant(Sam Neil), Ellie Sattler(Laura Dern) Ian Malcom(Jeff Goldblum) and Hammonds two grandchildren are brought to experience the park. After a storm and some suspected sabotage the movie turns into a race to get out of the Park alive.<p>Steven Spielberg has made a cinematic masterpiece with this movie. I can remember being nine years old and just being awe inspired by this movie. The Dinosaurs look fantastic. Industrial Light and Magic did a great job creating the prehistoric creatures. They really are breat defeying throughout the movie. The movie is shot so well. Spielberg is a master story teller and he sets everything up well. The movie uses so many things to make it good. There is action, suspense, comedey, and just enough seriousness to make you think.<p>Jeff Goldblum as Ian Macolm to me had the best performance of all the actors in the film. Very few people in Hollywood can reach the level of weirdness that Goldblum can achieve on screen and he has another one of a kind performance in Jurrassic Park.<p>All the other actors are solid all the way across. It'a a fantastic cast. It's solid all the way around with stars like Neil, Dern, Samuel L. Jackson, and Goldblum. Goldblum has the best performance, but the others don't disappoint.<p>The music is great in Jurrasic Park. Once again John Williams has shown us why he's the man in one of the best movies ever scored. If you like to see why Williams is the best just watch the movie and see how his score makes the movie so much better.<p>This is a fantastic movie. At one time it was the most successful movie in box office history and it's easy to see why. It's a fun movie. It doesn't insult the hit book it was made from. It raises questions on whether cloning should be legal. It's a cinematic masterpiece that should be enjoyed by all.</p></br><a href="../users/A29R4FCO6RFX4K.html">A29R4FCO6RFX4K</a><br/><p>Spielberg's dinosaur adventure Jurassic Park is up there with the all-time greats. Taken from Michael Crichton's thrilling novel, Jurassic Park is one of the most entertaining and exciting films ever made. The special effects are from FX maestro Stan Winston, who did the special effects for Aliens (1986) and Terminator 2 (1991). The seamless combination of CGI and robotic creatures creates some truly terrifying action set- pieces.<p>Despite what some critics thought when the film was released, I feel that all the principal actors give good performances, especially Sam Neill as Alan Grant and Jeff Goldblum as Dr. Ian Malcolm. But admittedly, the special effects are the main attraction, and Winston's dinosaurs (which won him another Oscar after Terminator 2) are truly frightening. Great entertainment. <p>The film's transfer onto DVD is first- rate, with superb picture and sound. The special features are exceptional, with a 50 minute 'making of' of the film and trailers for Jurassic Park, the Lost World and the teaser for Jurassic Park 3. Most interesting, however, is the footage of early pre-production meetings with Spielberg and the FX team discussing how certain shots and effects should be done. Also, there's a Phil Tippett animatic &quot;Raptors in the Kitchen&quot;, showing how claymation assists the director in visualising the shots and camera angles. Also there are storyboards, production photos and web links. A 5 star film, 5 star extras. Excellent entertainment.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R8AO9XASQ15C.html">A1R8AO9XASQ15C</a><br/><p>Steven Spielberg won the Oscar for directing &quot;Schindler's List,&quot; and it is as great as any other Big, Serious Movie you'd care to name. But that same year he also directed the pulpy &quot;Jurassic Park,&quot; which, for reasons of its own, was just as special as his angry and deeply personal Holocaust masterwork.<p>Here is a special effects movie that, like &quot;Terminator 2&quot; before it, heralded a new era of filmmaking. True, both movies announced the arrival of a lot of bad cinema (&quot;Jurassic Park III,&quot; anyone?), but &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; is memorable because of the love and care its director lavished on his beasties. This is sci-fi adventure escapism at its best.<p>The story is not terribly strong, more like a clothesline on which to hang some of the most exciting action scenes ever devised. The movie isn't as elaborate as Michael Crichton's book, but it's just as fast-paced and handles its resurrected dinosaurs with equal awe. Did Spielberg dumb-down some of Crichton's more difficult scientific concepts? You betcha, but you know what? I've seen worse.<p>I will always admire this movie for the T-Rex sequence, which scared me so badly in the theater that I had to pony up three more times to take the ride again. What a great moment; it sort of makes me imagine what it must have been like to have seen the premiere of &quot;King Kong&quot; back in 1933, because &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; garners comparison.<p>The velociraptors were also great villains, photographed in menacing fashion and given distinct personalities of their own. The final scene, which brings together the T-Rex and the raptors, is a fast, brutal classic that leaves you wanting more. Wisely, Spielberg gives us just enough.<p>The acting isn't great, but it is efficient. I give high marks to Jeff Goldblum for his flashy portrayal of chaotician Ian Malcolm (is he trying to channel Bono?) and Sam Neill, for his Harrison Ford-like turn as Dr. Grant. Laura Dern grates a nerve, and Richard Attenborough plays John Hammond as if he were Santa Claus, but these are flaws I'm willing to overlook.</p></br><a href="../users/AO461REE0KA4J.html">AO461REE0KA4J</a><br/><p>This is the DVD you bought your Dolby Digital or DTS sound system for.  Though primarily famous for its visual effects, this film has a highly active and creative surround soundtrack that should give your 5.1 speakers the most workout they ever got.  Compared to the old laserdisc's Dolby Prologic sound, the DD 5.1 sound (I haven't heard the DTS version) has much clearer and louder dialogs, much stronger and richer surround effects, and much better integration of dialogs, effects, and music, so they sound more cohesive to, and yet distinctive from, one another.  The sound effects span the entire frequency spectrum, from the deep bass of a triceratops' groaning, the earth-shaking tremble of a T-Rex's footsteps, to the shrill cries of a velociraptor. This is one DVD that really takes advantage of the newer sound formats.<p>The picture quality has nothing to complain about except the flesh tone on John Hammond looks a little too red at times, which was something I didn't see on the laserdisc.  There are only 20 chapter stops on the DVD, compared to 47 on the laserdisc.  The PCFriendly software that comes with the DVD appears to be an updated version, but it still causes frequent crashes to my PC.  Exclusive DVD-ROM features are nothing but web links, wallpapers, screensavers, and such; they are for Windows PCs only, but Mac users won't miss them.<p>The supplements on the DVD are good, but not great.  The '95 documentary &quot;The Making of Jurassic&quot; has been aired on TV countless times, but it does provide a nice recounting of how the visual effects got made.  The &quot;dinosaur encyclopedia&quot; includes only info on the dinosaurs that appear in the film, and some info is not accurate, such as the unproven claim that a dilophosaurus could spew venom.  The &quot;go-motion&quot; film clip of the &quot;kitchen attack&quot; scene done by Phil Tippett is very nice, and I wish more such clips were included.  (Although Tippett's clay model work was later replaced with computer graphics to his dismay, the clip shows that he contributed much to the scenes' visual style.)  There are camcorder video segments of a Spielberg-Winston pre-production meeting and a location-scouting session; both are noteworthy but superficial.  In a way-too-brief video segment called &quot;Foley Artists&quot;, a few sound artists demonstrate how certain sounds are recorded.  The best supplements, in my opinion, are the storyboard sequences of 5 dinosaur attack scenes, including 2 that were omitted from the film.  Storyboards are an excellent way to show how key shots were constructed and got translated into the finished film.  Other supplements include the usual production stills, cast &amp; crew bios, production notes.  There is no shooting script, no outtakes, no film clips of deleted scenes, no director's commentary.  Perhaps the biggest regret is there is not one word about DTS or Dolby Digital (in fact, the topic is rarely mentioned on any DVD).  It would be nice to mention at least what they do and what their advantages are, especially on a disc where DTS and DD are put to such good use.<p>The Jurassic Park DVD is sold in 3 versions: Widescreen/Dolby Digtal, Pan &amp; Scan/Dolby Digital, and Widescreen/DTS, but no Pan &amp; Scan/DTS. There is also a 2-pack edition that includes The Jurassic Park DVD and The Lost World DVD, and it comes in Widescreen/Dolby Digtal and Pan &amp; Scan/Dolby Digital versions, but no DTS version.  So make sure you order (and receive) the right copy.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RKI7RPP5CJMG.html">A2RKI7RPP5CJMG</a><br/><p>Perhaps one of the best films ever to grace a big screen, "Jurassic Park" is a suspenseful thrill ride that I never tire of watching.  It's hard to believe that this film came out over a decade ago and yet the advances it made in special effects are still influencing films today.  I won't waste much time on describing the plot because just about everyone already knows what happens.  For those not so inclined, here's a brief run-through:  Scientist screws with dino-DNA, clones a few of the beasts for an amusement park/zoo, needs legal and scientific approval, Newman steals information and shuts the entire park down, people begin to die, the surviviors attempt to escape.<br /><br />Now that you have an idea of what is going on, just know that this is one of the most suspenseful films made in the last twenty years.  It features a wonderful cast headed up by Sam Neill, Laura Dern, and Jeff Goldblum.  Richard Attenborough turns in a wonderful performance as the park's visionary creator and Ariana Richards and Joseph Mazzello play his very eager grandchildren.  In fact, Mazzello almost steals the show with his constant bickering over the facts in Dr. Grant's (Neill) book on dinosaurs being related to birds.<br /><br />Since its creation, I have yet to see a film influence movie-making as much as this one did.  The special effects are almost flawless.  The action is thrilling and suspenseful and the sound is amazing.  Even the cinematography provides some stunning visuals for the viewer.  Speilberg outdid himself with this one.<br /><br />If you purchase only one film from the nineties, this is the one to buy.  It was followed by two sequels, the horrible "The Lost World" and the popcorn friendly "Jurassic Park III," but both pale in comparison to this original classic.<br /><br />Highly recommended to ALL fans of cinema.  I don't care if you're a lover of Westerns, Comedies, Sci-Fi, etc.  This one film is one of the best of all time.</p></br><a href="../users/AQZH7YTWQPOBE.html">AQZH7YTWQPOBE</a><br/><p>I remember when Jurassic Park first came out. It was probably the last true blockbuster of the modern era. Everybody loved the special effects and seeing realistic dinosaurs on the big screen (remember, this was the FIRST time a movie had realistic dinosaurs as opposed to Godzilla-like monsters). But what really made this movie click was the characters. It's a perfect mix of lovable and oddball characters. I love the subtle character development over the course of the movie, particularly with Dr. Grant and John Hammond. You actually do care if they get eaten and you want them to survive.<br /><br />Jurassic Park is also the only time I've ever thought that a movie was better than the book. The book was more like a B-rated horror story with flat characters and more violence. The movie by contrast embraces the wonder of seeing dinosaurs on the big screen and is much more fun to watch. It was already an instant classic when it came out and I predict it'll be so even years from now.</p></br><a href="../users/A1C58YXM2A30CY.html">A1C58YXM2A30CY</a><br/><p>Spielberg's Jurassic Park was for the most part a revolutionary film, mixing the then-new CGI with traditional model effects to bring us dinosaurs.  The nitpickers might complain that the dinosaurs were all from the Cretaceous period.  Still, it won the Saturn Award for Best Science Fiction film for a reason.<br /><br />You know the plot:  a rich philanthropist, John Hammond, has found that cloning dinosaurs is a reality and decides to introduce the world to this phenomena by making a park that will entertain the rich masses to his little island.<br /><br />Everything is fine until we find the fat computer programmer is actually trying to sell dinosaur embryos to the highest bidder (Dennis Nedry, played by Wayne Knight, from Seinfeld).  In trying to escape and get his goods off the island and get his money (in the middle of a hurricane, no less) he shuts down the park's security system.<br /><br />This shut down then leads to massive failure of the electric fence system and many of the dinosaurs get out -- and begin their mass destruction of the human's activities!<br /><br />The movie's main draw for me was the actual dinosaurs live on screen.  You knew that one of the characters was correct -- this was nature's power and she decided to have the dinosaurs up for extinction and yet Man brought them back is looking for trouble -- but to see them grazing, running, herding and killing each other was really thrilling!<br /><br />Much of the book's charm and character development was cut out of the script, written fairly well by Michael Crichton (who also wrote the novel) and David Koepp.<br /><br />The DVD also had some great features, including a fascinating "making of" and the decisions to use computer-animation techniques and meld them with traditional model techniques was fascinating, as well as an interview with Spielberg and what was going through is mind in shooting this film.  His excitement and interest over the project was fascinating.  A director's enthusiasm often translates to the crew and cast and this was evident in the film.<br /><br />The film achieves the "awe and wonder" that other reviewers have stated, but is missing the development of character that is very evident in Crichton's original novel.  Still, well worth watching<br /><br />Other Spielberg Films of Interest:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00012QM8G">Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005QCYC">Jurassic Park Trilogy</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CX9Q">E.T. - The Extra-Terrestrial (2-Disc Widescreen Limited Collector's Edition)</a><br /><br />And of course books of interest:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0345370775">Jurassic Park</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/034538122X">The Making of Jurassic Park</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1600107605">Jurassic Park</a></p></br><a href="../users/A38921VU3NJDFK.html">A38921VU3NJDFK</a><br/><p>Another instant classic from Steven Spielberg, this spectacular translation of Michael Crichton's famous novel entertains with constant, enduring bouts of excitement and a full plate of terrorizing sequences as memorable as they are awe-inspiring. A forewarning of the possible cataclysmic effects of meddling with biology and genetics, Jurassic Park exercises one of the most engaging, smartly-conceived plots in Hollywood history--simple, yet beyond the realm of most peoples' imaginations. Spielberg's use of special effects (in particular, animatronics) is absolutely perfect--the dinosaurs are more realistic than anything similar that anyone's ever seen. This film's cast is pleasant and applicable, and its sound effects rival its visuals, making it one of the most technically flawless films of all time. For any film aficionado, this is an absolute essential piece of any DVD collection.</p></br><a href="../users/AWG2O9C42XW5G.html">AWG2O9C42XW5G</a><br/><p>Steven Speilberg dose it again. he directed a terrific movie that know one will forget. this has to be his best movie since e.t. i love this movie and so will you.  recommend it for everyone</p></br><a href="../users/A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX.html">A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX</a><br/><p>Please note that this is on the movie which I saw on HBO a few days ago, not on the DVD transfer, so I can't speak to the quality of that.<br /><br />I would like to make a few comments on the video and animation, though. I just saw the movie again for the first time since it came out, and I have to say it still holds up very well from the standpoint of the special effects and animation. Certainly, the CGI effects are better today, but for the time this was state of the art.<br /><br />The dinosaurs are realistically rendered, and movement is very fluid and realistic also. One difference between then and now is that high level optical effects still weren't very highly developed, such as the ability to render certain kinds of reflections, such as those involving chromatic aberration and specular highlights, and the ray-tracing programs were not as technically capable. But overall this is still an impressive movie from the standpoint of the special effects.<br /><br />The dinosaurs were seamlessly inserted into the Jurassic backgrounds with the humans, and the movie benefited from the revolution in dinosaur theory that began back in the 70s with the new ideas about dinosaurs being much more agile and faster and possibly even warm blooded. The paleontologist, played by Sam Neill, even suggests that they had the ability to communicate through calls like birds and mammals. Today, it is thought that mammals like foxes, not just primates, have as many as 50 distinct calls.<br /><br />As to the other things like the acting, it was fine but let's face it, the dinosaurs were the real stars here and I think they upstaged the more advanced mammals in the flick, and my vote goes to them for their performance. :-)  But I have always liked actor Sam Neill and this might be his most famous role as the enthusiastic and intrepid dinosaur expert. And Mr. Attenborough is always good in whatever he does.<br /><br />Overall still a great adventure classic that still holds up well today.<br /><br />By the way, if you like animated flicks, I have to put in a plug here for the movie, "The Battle for Terra." It's an independently produced fully animated movie that didn't receive wide distribution, since it was done by Hollywood outsiders. But it's a beautiful and visually appealing movie about a war between a peaceful race and warlike humans who attack their planet. If you compare it with say, "Titan A.E." from almost ten years ago, you can see how much the animation technology has changed in that time. "Titan A.E.," although great for its time, looked more like an animated cartoon. This movie looks like they're shooting actual 3D models, the figures and sets are so realistic and lifelike. It's a totally different world, literally.<br /><br />Even technically difficult lighting effects such as simple and complex reflection and refraction such as specular highlights are rendered realistically, which many world-class painters have trouble rendering (Vermeer and van Eyck are two of the greats who could do this well). As if this wasn't enough, at the very end of the movie, amazingly, some erudite visual jokester inserted chromatic distortions that look like the internal reflections typical of compound optical lenses, which various high-tech optical coatings are designed to minimize, as if the movie was shot with a real film camera. Too funny.<br /><br />So if you're into CGI stuff I can recommend this movie also.</p></br><a href="../users/A3IXPFN5DU9Z9L.html">A3IXPFN5DU9Z9L</a><br/><p>Jurassic Park is one of the best Crichton film adaptations thus far. Though the screenplay is only marginally faithful to the plot of the novel, the basic premise, people being hunted by prehistoric beasts in a tropical paradise, remains intact.<br /><br />The animatronics and computer technology used to bring the film's dinosaurs to life have aged remarkably well, and the action sequences remain as gripping as ever. The fantastic video quality and available Dolby audio makes for a great viewing experience on wide-format TVs and surround sound systems. DVD extras are sparse for a 'Collector's Edition', but I normally don't care for special features anyway.<br /><br />This is one of my favorite films and it was certainly a crowd pleaser when it was released in 1993. Spielberg keeps the introductions relatively brief and once the action starts, it continues pretty much unabated until the closing credits. His knack for giving the audience what they want creates a few glaring continuity issues (ex: The T.Rex paddock seems to be at road level when when the T.Rex walks through the fence and between the two cars. Moments later, Lex and Grant must rappel down into the paddock, which is now a long drop down from the road.) but the film is so enjoyable that one hardly notices them.<br /><br />The relatively one-dimensional characters are nevertheless filled out nicely by the cast, with Wayne Knight in a great performance as Dennis Nedry and Sam L. Jackson adding his trademark, smoke enveloped cool. I can highly recommend this film and DVD version.</p></br><a href="../users/A3PCTD8QM1BIXI.html">A3PCTD8QM1BIXI</a><br/><p>In the year 1993, Hollywood saw something unlike anything else, the film Jurassic Park. Never before 1993 had dinosaurs been so breathtaking and realistic on the silver screen. The plot is very original. A group of scientists cloned dinosaurs, and are about to open an amusement park where people can see the dinosaurs. The creator John Hammond(Richard Attenborough) invites a group of people, along with his grandchildren, to see the dinos and enjoy a relaxing time at the park. Could anything go wrong, at the time it doesn't seem like it, but something else is going on. Employee Dennis Nedry is planning to steal dinosaur embryos. In order to do this, he causes a security breakdown so he can get the embryos and escape. He isn't the only one that can escape, as hungry dinos also escape. After this, everyone on the island is in danger, and loose dinosaurs are everywhere. That is where the fun in Jurassic Park comes in.</p></br><a href="../users/A2II09GQGWOMTQ.html">A2II09GQGWOMTQ</a><br/><p>JP doesn't have much in the way of a story.<br />It really didn't need one.<br />Everyone went to see the scary dinos.<br />And Speilberg succeeds yet again, delivering the thrills and chills at a breakneck pace.<br />The story?<br />Genitically engineered dinos.<br />That's the story, basically.<br />If your looking for "Gone With The Wind" with dinos, your looking in the wrong place.<br />Action, action and more action.<br />This is a must have / must see movie.<br />RECOMMENDED!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A10ODC971MDHV8.html">A10ODC971MDHV8</a><br/><p>Based on Michael Crichton's best-seller, this nerve-jangling monster movie takes time to gather steam, but once it does, look out! Groundbreaking computer effects make dinosaurs frighteningly real, and once more, Spielberg knows just how to build tension, inch by gut-wrenching inch. The initial Tyrannosaurus scene is downright terrifying (particularly the first time around), along with those raptors in the kitchen. Whole cast is fine (including Samuel L. Jackson and Wayne Knight in supporting roles), but make no mistake: the dinos are the real stars. Original feature is vastly superior to the two sequels.</p></br><a href="../users/A3TNM3C9ENUCFW.html">A3TNM3C9ENUCFW</a><br/><p>Nearly 10 years on, this Spielberg classic is rivalled only by Jaws for originality, tension, and superb performances. Richard Attenborough plays the stoic billionaire who has discovered how to extract dinosaur DNA from a mosquito fossilised in tree amber, and decides to bankroll a genetics created theme park to wow the World. As always, with these schemes, you should listen to the age old maxim "Don't mess with Mother Nature" and despite the remote Island Location, the huge Reptiles get loose, and go on the rampage. This was the first and definitely best in the series of 3 movies, and I almost wish they'd stopped here, where the trilogy arguably peaked. Wonderfully realistic CGI blends seamlessly with superb acting performances from Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum (to name but a few). The best thing about this picture is it's longevity however. Like "Jaws" it is a non topical and timeless adventure for the whole family (with the exception of very small children). It's gripping, and often scary without being offensive or gratuitous and will undoubtedly be rediscovered by each succesive generation of viewers. Deservedly hailed now as a classic piece of Cinema. A great movie at a great price. Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/AYQF4Z1EQDACU.html">AYQF4Z1EQDACU</a><br/><p>One of the greatest movies of all time. Steven Speilberg's thrilling blockbuster masterpiece that became the highest grossing movie in worldwide box office history for some time. On an Island of the coast of Costa Rica, John Hammond has set up a biological reserve with genetically engineered dinosaurs, the result: JURASSIC PARK. He has invited paleontologist Dr. Alan Grant, Paleobotanist Dr. Elly Satler, Dr. Ian Malcom and his grandchildren Tim and Lex. When the power is shut down and the dinosaurs get loose from their electric fences. the park is no longer safe. The menacing T-Rex,Velicoraptors and many others are out on the island. What began as weekend excursion became a fight for survival from prehistory's greatest beasts. This film is one of Speilberg's best,an imaginative,brilliant,thrilling roaring ride,a triumph for all ages to enjoy. Steven Speilberg was the king of movie animals from JAWS to Jurassic Park. One of the most honoral films ever and  one of the most honorable for visual effects, the dinosaurs are one of the most real looking animals ever on the screen. I recommend this for a dinosaur movie,a speilberg movie and great movie all around. If Like Jurassic Park you should see the Lost World:Jurassic Park and Jurassic Park III. this is an thrilling epic not to be missed and it seems only yesterday this was this ruled the box office in 1993, it is the highest grossing movie of 93 and in my opinon the best of 93. Bring home one of  cinema history's greatest triumphs. Welcome to Jurassic Park.</p></br></body></html>

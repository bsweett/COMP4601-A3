An Academy award and a Golden Globe nomination. The 60's seen through the songs of the Beatles. A unique vision developed by one of the most interesting directors of our time. I was already enthused a few years ago by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JLPK">Frida</a> and the way Julie Taymor managed to give life to some of Frida Kahlo's paintings, now I can't but praise this film. The screenplay is uttermost smart, the actors perfect and Julie Taymor a director one has to count with. Masterpiece.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>ACROSS THE UNIVERSE is a musical for those who love the Beatles and/or the Vietnam War era anti-war protests. Specifically, it's for those who love the Beatles though.<br /><br />Paying homage to almost all the Beatles' songs of this era, Across The Universe paints a set of narratives across the silver screen against the lyrical backdrops of such greats as `All My Loving', `Let It Be', `Come Together', and `Hey Jude' to name a very few. All of the character names are also either pulled directly from Beatles tunes (Jude, Maxwell, Lucy, Sadie, etc.) or from the times (JoJo as Jimi Hendrix, etc.).<br /><br />Although very cleverly put together as a whole, the first forty minutes of the film are scattered and much of the music forced into the plot in order for it to make sense. The constrained script plugs along, trying to take wing but more often than not, falling back to Earth and trying again.<br /><br />About an hour into the film, however, Across The Universe finds its wings and gets aloft. After Max (Joe Anderson) gets inducted into the military, there's an incredible sequence in which we see a platoon of soldiers carrying the statue of liberty across the jungles of Vietnam. Never have I seen something so contrasting yet beautifully explored with regards to how the U.S. felt as boys were sent to fight in Southeast Asia (`Liberating' the Vietnamese by trampling down their country). The song `I Want You' is interspersed here with the lyrics "she's so...heavy!" cut from it. Amazingly done.<br /><br />The story is really about love and tolerance during a time of incredible bloodshed and governmental turmoil. Lead actors Jim Sturgess (as Jude) and Evan Rachel Wood (as Lucy) do a fine job of making us care about this conflicted couple and how in love they eventually become thanks to their similarities but also their differences. Jude wants to stay out of the war and focus on his artwork, while Lucy is forced into the Peace Movement when her brother (Max) gets drafted and shipped out. Lucy finds that peace at any cost is too high a price, while Jude's eyes are awakened when he pulls his head out of the proverbial sands.<br /><br />The drug culture is explored in-depth as our would-be lovers trek across the U.S. in a psychedelic bus after drinking some "purple punch." The visuals are wild, and the colors even wilder as their "experience" drops them into the hands of Mr. Kite (Eddie Izzard, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000J4QW8Q">My Super Ex-Girlfriend</a>) who sings, not surprisingly, `Being For The Benefit Of Mr. Kite.'" His blue buddies are indicative of the LSD experience for those who wanted to "turn on, tune in, and drop out."<br /><br />The ending is well rendered if a bit predictable. Love cannot be denied amongst these terrible times, so Jude and Lucy must find a way to make theirs work.<br /><br />If it weren't for the terrible beginning, this film would've gotten an easy five star rating. But it faltered so much in those first forty minutes that I'd be lying to myself if I said the middle and end made up for all of it. It didn't. But Across The Universe is still a musical worth watching. Just get past the beginning and you'll be swept up in the nostalgic music and characters.</p></br><a href="../users/A141HP4LYPWMSR.html">A141HP4LYPWMSR</a><br/><p>I found the '07 release `Across the Universe' to be a nostalgic, enjoyable film that beautifully highlights the songs of the greatest rock/pop group of the twentieth century and beyond. The cast is thoroughly likeable, the cameos excellent, especially Bono and Joe Cocker, and the storyline and visuals pure `60's.<br /><br />There are numerous levels of thought and genres from which one can approach this film. It's a musical, a period piece, a cultural/political statement, a love story and a poignant coming of age tale. Remarkably it succeeds on all levels. Put on your walrus outfit and give it a try.<br /><br />My Rating: -4 ? Stars-.</p></br><a href="../users/A13E0ARAXI6KJW.html">A13E0ARAXI6KJW</a><br/><p>When I saw the eye-popping clips of this 2007 movie in a preview earlier this year, it became readily apparent that director Julie Taymor has lost none of the visual invention that informs her vivid staging of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000001M1B">The Lion King</a> and her Baroque-level approach to 1999's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E6ESKS">Titus</a>. What I feared most from what I saw was that it would be more like an extended fantasy-laden musical video with the classic Beatles songbook basically providing most of the dialogue. It turns out I am mostly right, though there is a somewhat trite and rather predictable narrative, provided by Taymor and co-screenwriters Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais, at the core of the movie. Building a story around thirty-three unrelated Beatles songs is no easy task, and the contrivances are gratefully not as exaggerated as one would expect. At the same time, the characters feel hastily developed to fit the contours of the diverse songs, and most of the resulting performances are not compelling enough to bring it all together in a cohesive manner.<br /><br />Set in the 1960's, the plot revolves around Jude, a working-class bloke from Liverpool going stateside to visit the father he's never met, and Lucy, a product of East Coast privilege who becomes increasingly radicalized after her high school sweetheart dies overseas as the Vietnam War keeps raging on. Jude and Lucy meet through her brother Max, a Princeton undergrad who drops out to live in bohemian style in Greenwich Village but then gets drafted into the military. No surprise that a romance between Jude and Lucy evolves amid the anti-war countercultural movement, including a bus trip through psychedelia. There are other characters in the mix with equally familiar names - Sadie, a raspy-voiced Janis Joplin doppelganger about to break big on the rock music scene; Jo-Jo, her lover and competitor who evokes Jimi Hendrix's looks and individualistic guitar style; and Prudence, a sexually confused Ohio cheerleader who literally comes in through the bathroom window.<br /><br />The love story is strictly by the numbers, but the musical performances can be infectious. Evan Rachel Wood continues to impress even in a role as self-contained as Lucy, and her plaintive rendition of "If I Fell" is surprisingly affecting. The rest are definitely more singers than actors. Jim Sturgess appears to have been cast for his vocal resemblance to Paul McCartney, not a bad reason though he does manage to capture Jude's plot-driven angst with convincing abandon. He gets the lion's share of the classic ballads - "Girl", "I've Just Seen a Face", "Something", "All My Loving", "All You Need Is Love". Joe Anderson delivers a party-hearty "With a Little Help from My Friends" with his Princeton frat brothers and later a somber "Hey Jude" as a postwar-traumatized Max. As budding lesbian Prudence, T.V. Carpio does a doleful version of "I Want to Hold Your Hand" crossing through acrobatic football players during practice. Dana Fuchs brings a soulful thrust to "Helter Skelter", "Why Don't We Do It in the Road?", and "Don't Let Me Down", while Martin Luther McCoy poignantly covers "While My Guitar Gently Weeps".<br /><br />A few of the sequences don't work as well as others, for example, Jude's extended trashing of the protestors' office to the strains of "Revolution", the pin-cushioned strawberries transforming into bombs during the dual-perspective montage of "Strawberry Fields", and the drug-hazed antics of Bono as a Timothy Leary figure on "I Am the Walrus". Some of the more interesting performances come from the surprise guest appearances, such as Eddie Izzard as the ringmaster of a weirdly psychedelic "For the Benefit of Mr. Kite", Carol Woods and Timothy T. Mitchum delivering a powerful "Let It Be" set against the 1967 Detroit riots, and Joe Cocker showing his unmistakable vocal style under three different guises on a rollicking "Come Together". Even Salma Hayek shows up as a coterie of nurses in a roulette-style hospital during "Happiness Is a Warm Gun". There is a very defined audience for this type of confection, and there are more definitive performances of these classic songs elsewhere. At the same time, Taymor has an audacious visual sense well worth experiencing. Proceed with caution.</p></br><a href="../users/ANGH6401L9Y0T.html">ANGH6401L9Y0T</a><br/><p>Darn shame the system only has five stars maximum. I want to give this movie more. Maybe ten. Maybe it's because I'm a baby boomer and aging hippie, but this touched me very, very deeply. I'm sure I've annoyed my room-mate wearing the earphones and singing along with the songs.<br /><br />Lucy, an American girl, and Jude, a British lad from Liverpool, are the couple at the center of the story. But Sadie's there, and Prudence, and a most artful weaving of Beatles songs into a relatively coherent story. And anything done during that period has to be a little incoherent anyway in order to be authentic.<br /><br />I'm going to be a brat and not tell you hardly anything of the story. But I will say that you will recognize how well the songs fit, and how well other elements from the same era fit, including one character that will remind you of Janis Joplin, and another that will remind you of Jimi Hendrix. There are some artful touches, like the choreographed ballet with the soldiers and the nearly naked inductees at the draft board. The cops that break up an anti-war demonstration are singing.<br /><br />This is a unique concept in story-telling, and I don't want to ruin it for anyone who hasn't seen it. Anyone who hasn't seen it is highly recommended to do so at the earliest opportunity. And if you are over 40, you will probably not be able to resist singing along.</p></br><a href="../users/A2OU415LB9I5J6.html">A2OU415LB9I5J6</a><br/><p>The Beatles are a hot commodity, and with good reason. They started what became known as the "British Invasion" of the 1960's, and are the most commercially and critically successful group of the modern era. For that reason their song catalogue has been sought out by many industries from Cirque du Soleil to movies. One would think a biopic would have been made about The Beatles by now, but nothing more than the stories of their early years (Backbeat, Nowhere Boy).<br /><br />While there still hasn't been a biopic about The Beatles, artists have found many interesting ways to utilize and pay tribute to the music of The Beatles. Director Julie Taymor (Frida, The Lion King on Broadway) had a great idea to craft a new musical around The Beatles' song list called Across the Universe. The result was a coming of age story set during American turmoil during the late 1960's and features 33 songs from The Beatles ranging from early classics such as "All My Loving" and "I Want to Hold Your Hand" to later tracks such as "Oh! Darling" and "Something".<br /><br />Young Liverpudlian, Jude (Jim Sturgess), moves from England to New York in an effort to make it as an artist in America and to find his birth father who works at Harvard. While at Harvard he meets a rebellious student there named Max (Joe Anderson) and they become friends, and Max brings him to his home in Dayton, OH where Jude falls in love with Max's sister Lucy (Evan Rachel Wood). Things begin to unravel for the group as Max gets drafted for the Vietnam War and Lucy joins an antiwar group.<br /><br />If anything can be said about Julie Taymor, it's that she is an extremely visual and artistic director. Her visual sense at times lends itself to make elements of the film feel surreal and even avant-garde. She also has a real eye for authenticity. Across the Universe really draws you back to the times of the `60's and her staging of the Detroit race riots and the antiwar riots makes the tension feel palpable. Taymor lends an edge to the film that brings you back to that era, while also representing parallels to today's political climate while not glorifying one side over another.<br /><br />To me, musicals are always best when actors actually know how to perform and sing their own songs. Adding to that is the fact that most of the actors and actresses in this film are relative unknowns, allowing you to feel their performances more thoroughly. There are several cameos that really steal the show when it comes to performances though. Eddie Izzard has brilliant fun playing Mr. Kite (the circus leader in "Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite"), and Joe Cocker plays three different roles (pimp, bum, and hippie) while crooning "Come Together". Bono steals his scenes as Dr. Robert during an upscale book signing event.<br /><br />While Taymor has added some brilliant flourishes to this film, her tendencies toward avant-garde and surrealism takes away from the story as a whole. At times the plot feels disjointed and major lapses in the films time frame can cause the viewer to lose focus of exactly what's going on in the narrative. There's also such a huge cast that some of the characters aren't fleshed out as much as they should be. For example, Prudence (TV Carpio) seems to be more of an excuse to use the song "Dear Prudence" and she's not much more than a closet lesbian throughout the narrative.<br /><br />Despite its flaws, Across the Universe is a fun and engrossing film. All of the elements are there to appeal to just about anyone: romance, comedy, drama, and even a little action. Visually the film is impeccable. If you're a fan of the music of The Beatles, or you're just looking for a film that gives a little something for everyone I highly recommend that you check this out.<br /><br />3/5<br /><br />Be sure to check out: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006K7WZ7S">Armadillo & Sands: Intellectual Properties at Work</a>!</p></br><a href="../users/A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I.html">A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I</a><br/><p>Across the Universe is literally a beautiful movie and something every Beatles fan will enjoy wathing. The plot pulls you in, but fans will be waiting to see which song they use next. The reason this didn't get a perfect score is because of the story. I sometimes had a hard time following it, but luckily, this film doesn't need a story to be great. It has some brilliant visuals and songs that will have you dancing if you love the Beatles. The style of most of the songs are changed, but it still has the "Fab Four Feel" to them. Beatles fans, you need to see this movie. To me, this is the Beatles version of Pink Floyd's The Wall. Classic!</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>Julie Taymor once again uses her considerable innovative magic to create a film that not only is mesmerizingly beautiful to watch, but also a 'semi-documentary' about the world changes that occurred in the late 1960s and early 1970s as young people for the first time spoke out against the war in Vietnam, the death of Martin Luther King, and the senseless mayhem that extended from the battlefields of Vietnam to the streets of America, all set to the significant, timely music of the Beatles. It sounds like an impossible juxtaposition of themes and ideas, but in Taymor's hands it succeeds.<br /><br />Opening in Liverpool, England (where the Beatles began their impact on music and thought) we met Jude (Jim Sturgess), a working class boy with the gifts of an artist who decides to set off on a sea journey to meet the father he has never known. Once in New York he meets Max (Joe Anderson) and Lucy (Evan Rachel Wood) who represent the wealthy class,  but who both show roots of rebellion against the comfortable norm and an objection to the war that is festering like an abscess in the rice paddies of Vietnam. Jude meets his janitor father in a union that is anticlimactic, and in disappointment he falls in with Max, living the artists' life in the Village with free-wheeling singer Sadie (Dana Fuchs), her beau/guitarist JoJo (Martin Luther) and their newest tenant Prudence (T.V. Carpio), an Asian girl trying to find her place in a confusing world.  The group eventually bond with music and rebellion mixed with free love and the passion that they can make a difference, while around them racial crises are at a peak and the draft tags many of the young men (including Max) for the war they cannot condone.  From all of this turmoil the story builds to a climax leading to some very touching scenes that convey the spirit of the times and the overriding importance of love and understanding in a world torn apart by political and racial crises.<br /><br />The cast is strong with each of the actors singing their own versions of various Beatle songs very well  (the division between singing and spoken dialect favors the former).  But the real magic comes from Julie Taymor's mixture of hallucinogenic visuals, wonderfully choreographed crowd scenes, and ingenious movement from reality scenes displayed on the television to the reactive scenes of the world as viewed through the eyes of the youths and the lyrics of the songs.  It is at once touching in its ability to recreate a particular period of history and wholly entertaining in the inventive use of music/dance/visual effects/drama. This film is important now and will only increase in stature as a document of that troubled but exciting time in the history of the world.  We can only wonder why the youth of today are not responding to the Iraq War in a like manner, or, more uncomfortable to consider, why we,  now as adults, can't muster the same degree of distress about the myriad traumas that are still happening 'Across the Universe'.  Grady Harp, April 08</p></br><a href="../users/A18G7GG53G2X8A.html">A18G7GG53G2X8A</a><br/><p>If it were possible to go into the mind and film the imagination, if one could actually get a glimpse of a creative spark and present it as a movie, the end result would look something like "Across the Universe." Here is a film so vibrant, colorful, and imaginative that it practically flies off the screen. It's not something you simply watch; this richly detailed musical fantasy is something you fully experience, from the stunning visuals to the brilliant soundtrack. Few films have successfully incorporated previously written song material into an original story; one notable exception is Baz Luhrmann's "Moulin Rouge," in which songs by Elton John, David Bowie, Madonna, The Police, and many others were interwoven. "Across the Universe" gets its inspiration from the music of The Beatles--every song fit the story so naturally, it's almost as if they were specially written for the film.<br /><br />But as much as I enjoyed it, I can't help but feel that I'm the wrong person to review it; not only have I never listened to the music of The Beatles, I also never lived through the 1960s. "Across the Universe" explores the dynamic atmosphere of that era, from the artistic movements to the social unrest to the turbulent political climate. I can't pretend that I know what the filmmakers were saying or why they were saying it, and I certainly don't know what point The Beatles were trying to make. But I can still appreciate this movie. And I do; "Across the Universe" thrives on energy and ingenuity, and it isn't afraid to tell a simple yet effective love story through music.<br /><br />The plot focuses on Jude (Jim Sturgess), a young dockworker and artist from Liverpool. He travels to America in search of his father, who was stationed in England during the Second World War. Jude is led to Princeton University, and it's there that he meets Max (Joe Anderson), a freewheeling college student with no apparent goals and no apparent desire to reach any goals. The two instantly click, and for a while, they have a lot of fun. So does Max's sister, Lucy (Evan Rachel Wood), a college freshman whose clean-cut appearance masks a progressive mind. As soon as life in New Jersey gets boring, Max and Jude decide to leave for New York, where the Bohemian life can be lived to the fullest. They take residence in a small apartment, already inhabited by Sadie (Dana Fuchs) and her band.<br /><br />After a while, Lucy joins the group, much to the dismay of her conservative parents. She and Jude quickly fall in love. But as the social climate gets more intense, their relationship gets more complex. The Civil Rights Movement is in full swing, as is the Vietnam War; such unrest cannot be ignored. Ever since losing her high school sweetheart to the War, Lucy's political views have taken a sharp turn to the left--she's now a militant activist, dedicated to bringing about social reform and an end to war and violence. Her feelings only grow stronger when Max is drafted and shipped off to Vietnam. All this puts a strain on Jude and Lucy's relationship, and it only gets worse when Lucy begins collaborating with a radical organization. Can their love survive this turmoil?<br /><br />Woven all throughout is a myriad of songs, all of which perfectly capture the emotional impact of a given scene. When Max and Jude first meet, "With a Little Help from My Friends" accentuates their high-spiritedness. The drama of "Let It Be" overflows during a race riot, in which a young boy is killed. Confusion and frustration overwhelm as Jude and Max sing "Strawberry Fields," and images of dripping strawberries make an especially strong impact. A love-struck cheerleader named Prudence (T.V. Carpio) sings "I Wanna Hold Your Hand" with regret, knowing that the girl she's dreaming of will never feel the same way. The power of "I Want You" is felt as Max is dragged through an army recruitment center; dancing, squared-jawed soldiers are prominently featured, as are half naked draftees. At one point, they forcefully carry a miniature Statue of Liberty into the jungles of Vietnam.<br /><br />The four most creative song-numbers feature cameo appearances. Joe Cocker sings "Come Together" just as a guitarist named JoJo (Martin Luther McCoy) enters the city. It's a highly choreographed sequence, featuring a chorus line of prostitutes and office workers. "I Am the Walrus" is a psychedelic trip featuring Bono as the leader of a busload of hippies. Eddie Izzard plays a showman named Mr. Kite, whose circus--"The Benefit of Mr. Kite"--is a bizarre mixture of the fantastic and the frightening, featuring a cast of blue-skinned performers that are anything but human. Salma Hayek appears as a nurse during Max's rendition of "Happiness is a Warm Gun." As he lies on a hospital bed, he tries to get a handle on the fear, anger, and physical pain that have been holding him back.<br /><br />By the time we hear "Hey Jude" and "All You Need Is Love," the sentimental side of the story hits us like a ton of bricks. And that's exactly what we want. One of the simplest pleasures imaginable is to be young, in love, and free; this movie does a masterful job of giving the audience that same feeling, if only for a little while. "Across the Universe" is one of the most delightful, inventive, and refreshing films of the year, a perfect blend of music, story, and character. To see it is to be emotionally rejuvenated.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KJ6JAZPH382D.html">A3KJ6JAZPH382D</a><br/><p>There have been several movies that have tried to make the music of The Beatles a central focus of their reason d'existence. Some - like The Beatles' own <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000542D2">A Hard Day's Night</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000JRUQ">Yellow Submarine</a> - are perfect, some are not (the dismal "All This and World War Too"). Even the camp classic <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009APB6">Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band</a> was so bad it was worth seeing because of the music. Heck, even the forgettable <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005TT77">I Am Sam</a> raked in a killer soundtrack thanks to John, Paul, George and Ringo.<br /><br />But they've got nothing on "Across The Universe." Taking the turmoil and tumult of the sixties and re-imagining it through the lyrics of Beatle's songs, it is a trippy, hallucinogenic ride that is a visual and sonic feast. Jude (from Liverpool, naturally) comes to the US to find his American soldier dad (Robert Clohessy, a regular from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00031TYBC">Oz - The HBO prison drama</a>) only to collide with rich kid renegade Max and then to fall for his sister, Lucy. Suddenly, they find themselves in NYC with a Janis Joplinish landlady, Sadie, and her Jimi Hendrixian boyfriend, Jojo.<br /><br />The sixties then take their turn into the war, and the drama unfolds as Jude falls for Lucy ("I've Just Seen a Face"), Max finds himself drafted ("I Want You") and Lucy falls under the spell of the anti-war movement leader. Each point is often brilliantly illustrated, and director Julie Taymor tosses subtlety out the window for several of the film's best sequences. In particular, when Prudence sings "I Want To Hold Your Hand" as a lament for a love that can't speak out loud, football players fly through the air and collide as she walks through them. When Max gets to his indoctrination and the exaggerated GI Joes march in "stomp dance" style to "I Want You," it's breathtaking. While the narrative occasionally falters, the visuals and set pieces never do.<br /><br />Of course, there is the music. While there's nothing earth-shattering here, all the actors acquit themselves just fine. The small handful of cameos are great, especially Joe Cocker singing "Come Together" as three different characters, and Bono playing the Ken Keasey Electric Kool-Aid guru Dr Robert on the magic bus, promoting his new book titled (heh heh) "I Am The Walrus." (I could have done without Eddie Izzard's "Being for The Benefit of Mr Kite," even if the sequence is sufficiently madcap.) But this isn't a sloppy kaleidoscope like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000067L8">Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band 1978 Soundtrack</a> was; other than the three men mentioned prior, there are no stars here. In particular, Sadie (Dana Fuchs) and Jojo (Martin Luther McCoy) give dynamite performances, and other than Evan Rachel Wood, the cast is relatively unknown.<br /><br />I really can't say enough about the pleasure I got from "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WCBPOG">Across The Universe</a>, and it may be the first time you walk into a theater humming the songs. I was skeptical at first, because many of the reviews I'd read were not kind. But I have a feeling many of them were written by folks of a more tender age, lacking the comprehension of the times portrayed on screen. One of the most fun things about this movie was catching the goofy Beatles' homages sprinkled in the film's dialog (favorite, when Prudence sneaks into the Sadie's communal apartment and someone asked where she comes from, Jude replies "she came in through the bathroom window").<br /><br />This is also a recommendable movie for one other reason. It isn't. When I say 'it isn't,' I mean, not a sequel, not a rip-off of a TV series (old or new), not a remake and some lowbrow teen sex-romp. There isn't anything cloying or coy, and while the movie is certainly political, the politics you get from it will be what you read out on your own. "Across The Universe" is as relevant today as it was when when The Beatles sang "But if you go carrying pictures of Chairman Mao, you ain't gonna make it with anyone anyhow." Grab your popcorn, sit back, relax and float downstream.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DGVB3T5QJNRE.html">A3DGVB3T5QJNRE</a><br/><p>As someone who was literally a child of the mid - late 60's & and a student of the time period, I first want to thank everyone who had anything to do with the making of this film! Your timing could not of been better! You helped me to remember the fervor, passion and idealism that made up the mid-late 60's. It's been many years since I have burst out sobbing in a movie theater! Thanks for helping to lift the fog a bit! As an activist, you have collectively given me some badly needed renewed vigor!<br /><br />I also feel so very, very sorry for all the critics of this movie who don't have a clue about what  all this means, or whose hearts have grown so hard with such bitterness, cynicism or despair; or have just simply sold-out; or plain no longer care! All your ranting and raving and nay saying won't do a thing to take away one moment of  the adventure, creativity, experimentation, excitement or passion that made this time in history so great!<br /><br />I also what to thank the brilliant filmmakers for paying homage to so many important cultural icons, organizations and events of the period: Walter Cronkite, the greatest  broadcaster of the 20th century. Baba Olatunji, the Nigerian Drummer and social activist, his double looked like he came right off the Drums of Passion album cover! I can now see him smiling from heaven! The tremendous scene with Bread and Puppets, a living, breathing, direct link to 1960's radicalism, warmed my  heart! You even went up to their stronghold in Glover, Vermont, to film part of the scene! Bravo! The SDS (Students for a Democratic Society), which did not advocate violence, and the much smaller splinter-group that morphed into an organization advocating extreme measures, called the Weather Underground. The brave Martin Luther King, Jr. and his intervention in a labor dispute, which cost him his life. The historic occupation of  the Ivy League, Columbia University by its students protesting both the Vietnam war and the intense poverty that surrounded the school.  Ken Kesey and his legendary bus. The Jimi Hendrix & Janice Jopplin characters who show such dignity, and a passion for music. And, of course, the Beatles! Their music reaches deep into my soul. You gave me insights into the meaning of their tunes that after all these years never crossed my mind!<br /><br />I also enjoyed being bathed in all the very colorful special affects. The 60's and early 70's were a time of outrageously bold colors and design. Something brilliantly portrayed in Across the Universe!

Jude (from Liverpool, naturally) comes to the US to find his American soldier dad (Robert Clohessy, a regular from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00031TYBC">Oz - The HBO prison drama</a>) only to collide with rich kid renegade Max and then to fall for his sister, Lucy. Suddenly, they find themselves in NYC with a Janis Joplinish landlady, Sadie, and her Jimi Hendrixian boyfriend, Jojo.<br /><br />The sixties then take their turn into the war, and the drama unfolds as Jude falls for Lucy ("I've Just Seen a Face"), Max finds himself drafted ("I Want You") and Lucy falls under the spell of the anti-war movement leader. Each point is often brilliantly illustrated, and director Julie Taymor tosses subtlety out the window for several of the film's best sequences. In particular, when Prudence sings "I Want To Hold Your Hand" as a lament for a love that can't speak out loud, football players fly through the air and collide as she walks through them. When Max gets to his indoctrination and the exaggerated GI Joes march in "stomp dance" style to "I Want You," it's breathtaking. While the narrative occasionally falters, the visuals and set pieces never do.<br /><br />Of course, there is the music. While there's nothing earth-shattering here, all the actors acquit themselves just fine. The small handful of cameos are great, especially Joe Cocker singing "Come Together" as three different characters, and Bono playing the Ken Keasey Electric Kool-Aid guru Dr Robert on the magic bus, promoting his new book titled (heh heh) "I Am The Walrus." (I could have done without Eddie Izzard's "Being for The Benefit of Mr Kite," even if the sequence is sufficiently madcap.) But this isn't a sloppy kaleidoscope like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000067L8">Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band 1978 Soundtrack</a> was; other than the three men mentioned prior, there are no stars here. In particular, Sadie (Dana Fuchs) and Jojo (Martin Luther McCoy) give dynamite performances, and other than Evan Rachel Wood, the cast is relatively unknown.<br /><br />I really can't say enough about the pleasure I got from "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WCBPOG">Across The Universe</a>, and it may be the first time you walk into a theater humming the songs. I was skeptical at first, because many of the reviews I'd read were not kind. But I have a feeling many of them were written by folks of a more tender age, lacking the comprehension of the times portrayed on screen. One of the most fun things about this movie was catching the goofy Beatles' homages sprinkled in the film's dialog (favorite, when Prudence sneaks into the Sadie's communal apartment and someone asked where she comes from, Jude replies "she came in through the bathroom window").<br /><br />This is also a recommendable movie for one other reason. It isn't. When I say 'it isn't,' I mean, not a sequel, not a rip-off of a TV series (old or new), not a remake and some lowbrow teen sex-romp. There isn't anything cloying or coy, and while the movie is certainly political, the politics you get from it will be what you read out on your own. "Across The Universe" is as relevant today as it was when when The Beatles sang "But if you go carrying pictures of Chairman Mao, you ain't gonna make it with anyone anyhow." Grab your popcorn, sit back, relax and float downstream.</p></br><a href="../users/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ.html">A12X2J7AVZ04IQ</a><br/><p>To understand this odd (but compelling) film, perhaps you had to be around during the 60's (which I was). The confusion and frustration of that period is so very well conveyed. How better to do that than to bring to life the immortal words & music of the Beatles?! Very fine and original idea. Also, one must understand the gritty, down-to-earth vision of the wonderful Julie Taymor. I've admired her since "Titus", a most profound take on Shakespeare. I was fascinated by "Across the Universe" for many reasons. Her clever use of color may be matched only by the vision of Zhang Yimou's films. Assembing a perfect cast, led by Jim Sturgess and Evan Rachel Wood, and supported reliably by Joe Anderson & Dana Fuchs, it couldn't have been better. Indeed, the entire cast was brilliant, with bit parts performed by Bono, Eddie Izzard, Selma Hayek, to name a few. Fresh material is a concept Hollywood has seemed to put on the back burner. Luckily, there are still visionaries like Julie Taymor who can connect with audiences, new and old, to bring fresh air to the often stale and conventional style used by most auteurs. The 2-disc DVD is excellent, with a glorious widescreen version of the film on disc 1 and loads of wonderful and interesting extras on disc 2. Ms. Taymor's vision is well presented.</p></br><a href="../users/A2OCJNB6B46OKP.html">A2OCJNB6B46OKP</a><br/><p>As a huge Beatles fan since the age of 5 seeing the trailer for this movie was a very big thing. Not that many people have the audacity to bring the Musical to the big screen anymore, especially if the story is not based on a broadway musical. 'Acorss The Universe' is the story of an English bloke named Jude (from Liverpool no surprise) heading to America in the 60s to find his estranged father. No sooner that he get there he is swept up into the whole revolution that was America at that time. A wild and fun loving guy named Max and his sheltered younger sister Lucy guide him through this crazy time through travel, drugs, politics and of course song.<br /><br />While the movie was creative and being a Beatles fan it is something to see, I felt that the movie was just a little overhyped. I felt there were plenty of unanswered questions due to plot holes. There wasn't enough character development. While the story was very well thought out I felt that the movie was more focused on the music leaving the plot very shallow. Yes it is true that the point of the movie was for the songs to tell the story, as a person that loves film I just don't like that concept. I like to get involved and think about the stories, not just get lost in a visual specticle. Still, the linking of Beatles knowledge and 1960's pop culture references was pretty much what kept me interested in sticking around from start to finish.<br /><br />Did I hate this movie...no I found it origional and entertaining. I loved the guest appreaences of faces like Bono and Eddie Izzard. I loved the refernces to alot of secondary Beatles songs. I just feel that it was a story that could have been developed so much more if the movie was not focused on the songs. I have seen many musicals in my days. 'The Music Man', 'The Sound Of Music' and oh hell 'South Park: Bigger Longer and Uncut'. They are had songs driving the movie, but at the same time a fantastic story that made you love it when the credits rolled. Still any Beatles fan out there should take the time to see 'Across The Universe'. You will be glad you did.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FEJIORC1MBG3.html">A2FEJIORC1MBG3</a><br/><p>When I first heard that there was a new movie musical based on classic Beatle songs, the trauma of watching "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band" back in the 70s came back to haunt me (and let's pretend that "All This and World War II" never even happened, mmmkay?)<br /><br />However, when I found out that the gifted film and stage director Julie Taymor ("Titus") was at the helm, I decided to, er, give her new piece a chance; and to my pleasant surprise I was treated to the most imaginative, eye-popping screen musical since Baz Luhrmann's "Moulin Rouge!" breathed new life into the genre back in 2001.<br /><br />"Across the Universe" is fundamentally a collection of slickly choreographed production numbers, all propelled by Beatles covers and loosely connected by the requisite "boy meets girl" motif. Toss in a sprinkling of iconic 60s counterculture references(Vietnam, Leary, Kesey, Owsley, the Weathermen, Hendrix, Joplin, etc.)and voila! Admittedly, the plot is a bit thin; this will likely be a sticking point for those looking for a deeper meditation on the peace love and dope generation.<br /><br />The story's central character is Jude (Jim Sturgess), a young working class Liverpudlian who stows away illegally to the States in search of his father, an American GI who had a brief wartime fling with his mother. He ends up at Princeton University, where he finds out his father now works as a janitor. Jude soon falls in with Max (Joe Anderson), a free-spirited Ivy League slacker, through whom he meets the love of his life, Max's sister Lucy (Evan Rachel Wood). Eventually, the trio decides to "drop out" and move to Manhattan, where they find an apartment managed by the (sexy!) Sadie (Dana Fuchs), a hippie earth mother archetype who also is an up and coming rock singer (replete with a bluesy Janis Joplin wail). The three roommates are soon sucked into the vortex of 60's turbulence. Max is drafted and shipped to Vietnam;  Lucy throws herself into political activism and the mercurial Jude,still trying to find himself, flirts with becoming an artist.<br /><br />There are some memorable cameos. Joe Cocker belts out a great version of "Come Together", U-2's Bono dispenses hallucinogens and hams it up as the day tripping Dr. Robert, crooning "I Am The Walrus" and Eddie Izzard (bearing an eerie resemblance to the late Oliver Reed as he appeared in "Tommy") cavorts with a chorus line comprised of Pixar-worthy Blue Meanies, to the strains of "For the Benefit of Mr. Kite".<br /><br />Inevitably, a few of the more exuberant numbers recall Milos Forman's 1979 film version of "Hair". In fact, one could say that some elements of the storyline in "Across the Universe" recall "Hair" as well; but I think Taymor is sharp enough to navigate that fine line between "inspiration" and "plagiarism" (or as film makers are fond of calling it: "paying homage"). I also gleaned references to "The Graduate" and "Alice's Restaurant".<br /><br />If the film has a weakness, it lies in the casting of the two leads. The character of Jude, as written, holds many obvious parallels to the life of John Lennon; the Liverpool roots, the estranged father, the creative angst and inherent cynicism. Jude's NYC apartment and his eventual deportation is undoubtedly a reference to Lennon's later visa issues. Sturgess doesn't quite have the depth that a more seasoned actor might have put into those particular elements of the Jude character. Wood sleepwalks through the film as well; it's a disappointing follow-up to her acclaimed performance in "Thirteen".<br /><br />At the end of the day, however, we must keep in mind that this is, after all, a musical. Audiences seem to be much more forgiving about rote line readings when there's lots of good singin' and dancin'. Even a genuine genre classic like "West Side Story " had weaknesses on that front; Richard Beymer was no Brando, and Natalie Wood could have used a better  dialect coach. But what do people remember most about that film? The fantastic choreography and the incredible music score. And do you want to know the best part about "Across the Universe"? The Bee Gees are nowhere to be seen.</p></br><a href="../users/AXV9GS0TMSVW.html">AXV9GS0TMSVW</a><br/><p>Musicals are running amok in Hollywood and theatregoers were treated to at least 3 of them (there may be one I missed) with the gentle and lovely Once, the movie turned broadway musical turned movie Hairspray, and artistic visually stunning Across the Universe.  While Hollywood likes churning out Broadway adaptations regularly (in the case of Hairspray), these unusual experimental musicals are welcome.  Once was my favorite this year.  Across the Universe was the most stunning.<br /><br />Across the Universe is set up for failure though.  It's a jukebox musical, right?  To me, those are dreadful, big Vegas style romps that try to gain a narrative from splicing well known hits together.  Across the Universe has the Beatles songbook, with songs too well known it seems to generate enough originality.  But the film has a weapon in the form of Julie Taymor, who has proved her artistic weight in gold.<br /><br />If you're reading this, your are by now familiar with the setup.  It's a love story in the middle of the social unrest of the 60s, set largely against the Vietnam War and all that came with it: civil unrest, peace rallies, protests, and drugs.  When the setup is clear, you realize the Beatles songbook was, in fact, a narrative for the times.  Songs like "Revolution," "Helter Skelter," and "Happiness is a Warm Gun" are at home here.<br /><br />But narrative aside, it's the visuals that steal the show.  Across the Universe is like a long form music video.  Yet the story is cohesive and the imagery for the songs brings the story to life.  The two that stick out in mind very clearly are "She's so Heavy," which in the film makes a dramtic statement about the draft at the time - complete with freaky looking Uncle Sam's with excellent choreography, and "Strawberry Field's Forever," which is a dramatic duet from the two male leads while one struggles with his art and love and the other struggles in the Vietnam War.  After you watch the film, you may not be able to help but pair up some of the images with the Beatles songs.  There's also some notable cameos, and while Bono's is well publicized, it's Eddie Izzards take on Mr. Kite that steals the show.<br /><br />The film suffers only from it's grand ambition.  Notably, there is a little character clutter.  This seems to be the case with the character of Prudence, who's appearance seems superfluous, appearing briefly 3 times in the film, once so someone can sing "Dear Prudence" to her.  To me, however, this was the only major misstep.<br /><br />Across the Universe is a visual marvel and takes the musical into experimental realms not yet explored in the general Hollywood arena.  The talented cast executes the Beatles songbook quite well and demonstrate that pop stars don't need to dominate a musical.  Taymor combines the performances with imagery I guarantee you haven't seen in a musical before.  The visual achievements alone make it worth the while.  The music isn't half bad either.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>I must admit that I enjoyed the first half of the movie more than I thought I would, but the second half was like Moulin Rouge all over again. It just went crazy on me. The songs weren't sung or performed that well and left me wishing to hear the original versions instead. The plot also didn't seem to have much purpose other than a thrown together love story mixed with a little anti-war for good measure. Across the Universe seems to be a movie that most people love or hate. I didn't hate it (the visuals were nice), but I wouldn't want to sit through it again.</p></br><a href="../users/AF8C86SGYLH81.html">AF8C86SGYLH81</a><br/><p>I really don't know exactly where to begin with this movie review.  Most of you are fed up and tired with my reviews of horror films that deal with extreme violence.  This review is the complete and exact opposite...a film of love...a film encased within the hearts of many people (my age) that truly enjoyed the "love" generation.<br /><br />"Across the Universe" has moved into my TOP THREE films of all time.  Immediately after I finished it, I wanted to see it again...much like my fever for "Jurassic Park" and something much more endearing as "When Harry Met Sally".  What's the comparison?<br /><br />"Across the Universe" is a visual anthology of everything that the legendary Beatles stood for.  Not within their crazy and bizarre real lives, but within the tone and realism of what their words and music stood for.<br /><br />I'd like to deem this movie a musical, but it goes far beyond that.  It is a love story of "Titanic" proportions, and a film that tugs at your emotions from start to finish...ONLY if you have ever been in love...yearned for love...lost your love...perhaps never really understood what love is all about.<br /><br />Bear with me.  I need to be clear and explicit with this review, my buds.  This film is one of, if not the best, I have ever seen.<br /><br />In a nutshell, the pure love and innocence of The Beatles music and lyrics are put into action in this incredibly romantic vision of love...love...love.<br /><br />I took notes as the film unfolded.  Here are some of my notes:<br /><br />"Coming from a movie maniac like me, when I say this is one of the best movies ever produced, please hear me out."<br /><br />"This is a tribute to The Beatles...their music and their message within the music...put to action in a priceless...moving...portrayal...by committed and caring Beatlemaniacs...like me."<br /><br />"I loved the classic films such as Jurassic Park, Forrest Gump, and Silence of the Lambs.  Across the Universe takes you back to reality...the turbulent Sixties...the tearful times when we lost lives in senseless combat...searching for love in all the RIGHT places...not fearful of crying...women or men."<br /><br />"How can you take 40-plus Beatles' love songs and not tug at the strings of your heart?"<br /><br />"If you don't cry in at least 10 different scenes, I question the devotion of your heart."<br /><br />"This is a beautiful love story of the Sixties...with incredible visuals that define The Beatles' music, message, and purpose in life."<br /><br />"If you only watch the scene where the song "I Want You...She's So Heavy" is so masterfully visualized, you'll get your money's worth."<br /><br />But it doesn't end there.<br /><br />"This film is an anthology of our times/lives from 1963 to 1973...a decade of love, peace and protest.  This film explains it all.  If you have ever loved from your heart, buckle your seatbelts and fathom this epic."<br /><br />"Can a movie tug at your heart for two hours?  Yes.  This one does.  Tears, hope, joy and sadness.  This one took me home my Buds.  My life was revisited in 120 minutes...as a veteran of the U.S. Army...a young man in love...an old man in love...all of my love...revisited by the melodic sounds of The Beatles."<br /><br />"The Beatles launched their career with epic love songs.  Enjoy them and the cast as they live within the lyrics."<br /><br />This movie is beautiful...profound...exhilarating.  There's something in the way it moves...it has  strawberry fields forever...and your guitar will gently weep.  It gives you All My Loving...and demands a response to the question...If I Fell.  Oh Darling...there's no room for Helter Skelter or a Revolution, but Lucy's Sky with Diamonds will send you on a journey ACROSS THE UNIVERSE that only true Beatle fans will ever understand.  Take the journey.<br /><br />This one, on a scale of 1-10...gets a solid TWENTY!<br /><br />Bottom line...ALL YOU NEED IS LOVE...LOVE IS ALL YOU NEED!<br /><br />No...I'm not pulling your leg.  This is one of the best films I have ever experienced.  It will live within my heart forever, because it represents so many things that are important to my/your generation....LOVE...LOVE.  That's all we need...the box</p></br><a href="../users/A3RTMB76CJWY9U.html">A3RTMB76CJWY9U</a><br/><p>Gorgeous.<br /><br />Across the Universe is a gorgeous film, with wonderful artistic direction, an incredible soundtrack (naturally), and a fine plot set in the turbulent youth movement of the late 1960s.<br /><br />I never would have thought that you could create such a story out of the songs of the Beatles, and even if the film stretches itself to meet the fab four's lyrics from time to time (giving the character Maxwell a silver hammer to use?), it still ultimately comes across as almost natural. Almost as though the Beatles had written the music for the movie, and not the other-way-around. Certainly what comes to my mind the most are numbers like "A Little Help From My Friends," "Revolution," and "Hey Jude."<br /><br />For each number, the film expertly crafts visual imagery and tone. Even some of the songs that I've never particularly liked, like Strawberry Fields Forever, become engaging and magical, here. This movie provides the viewer with a number of moments that will stay with you. The gigantic Uncle Sams in the induction center? The sexy nurses (all played by Salma Hayek, I believe) singing Happiness is a Warm Gun? The dead Vietnamese women singing the title song? Are images not likely to leave anytime soon.<br /><br />Setting the story in the late 60s, with a backdrop of student protests and war, is brilliant, too. Not only is it a great setting for a strong love story, but it ties into the times in which the Beatles were writing and lends a genuine feel to the whole project. I do not think that the Beatles would have been unhappy to see their music used so.<br /><br />All in all, this movie is more than a movie: it is a statement. An event. It takes incredible music, blends that with stunning visuals, and a fine story woven into a stirring, and appropriate, backdrop. In a word?<br /><br />Gorgeous.</p></br><a href="../users/ACVFTS9X2MKJ8.html">ACVFTS9X2MKJ8</a><br/><p>I'm usually uncomfortable about anybody singing Beatles songs.  I grew up with the Beatles so, of course, I had to see this movie.  One thing I have basically confirmed again to myself about this movie, is that John Lennon and Paul McCartney were fabulous songwriters.  Some songs here were sang slower that the original Beatle versions so it's easy to cherish every written word of the songs while hearing them with a mildly darker, grungier, intention.  Listen again to the words of "I've Just Seen a Face."  What an excellent song!  Nobody writes songs like this anymore.  No wonder everybody continues to love the Beatles.<br /><br />You know, if you liked this film, then check out 1978's "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"  which starred Peter Frampton and the Bee Gees, plus an all-star cast.  It's basically the same intention that you're seeing with "Across the Universe".  In "Sgt Pepper..." you'll get a series of go-nowhere events that allows the stars of the film to break out into a Beatles song.  Plus, in "Sgt. Pepper..." you'll get a variety of popular seventies artists singing Beatles songs.  Many which became hits.  Aerosmith did "Come Together", Alice Cooper did "Because", Steve Martin did "Maxwell's Silver Hammer", Earth, Wind, and Fire did "Got to Get You Into My Life", and Robin Gibb did "Oh Darling".  Plus lots of other songs by various artists.<br /><br />Though the film "Sgt. Pepper..." was considered silly at the time, all you "Across the Universe" fans just might think that it's one to cherish as well.  At least, rent it and check it out.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5.html">A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5</a><br/><p>For those born too late and those who want to remember, "Across the Universe" is the sound of the times for the 60's.  "Across the Universe" takes songs composed by the Beatles and sets them into the real world environment of the 60's reinforcing the poignant and sometimes psychodelic images.<br /><br />Jude (Jim Sturgess) is a Liverpool lad who signs up as a sailor and then jumps ship in the US in order to find his Dad, who he believed to be a Princeton professor.  What he finds instead is a janitor who really doesn't want a son to come into his new life.  Max (Jim Carrigan) a Princeton frat boy who's tired of college and ready to hit the scene invites him home for Thanksgiving, which Jude has never celebrated and really doesn't know much about.  Over the turkey and dressing, he meets Lucy (Evan Rachel Wood) Max's sister, who is in love with a soldier boy gone off to war.<br /><br />When Max feels rejected by his family, he and Jude decide to go to New York City and Greenwich Village.  That's where the real adventure begins.  Both the War Machine and the Peace Movement are clearly depicted.  In the meantime, Lucy loses her soldier boy and comes to join the two.<br /><br />There's enough humor (bad Beatles song puns, among other things) to keep you laughing after the inevitable shock and tears.  Overall, I thought this film was beautifully filmed and well acted.  Kudos to the cast and crew for such a well-thought-out film.</p></br><a href="../users/AFJFXN42RZ3G2.html">AFJFXN42RZ3G2</a><br/><p>ACROSS THE UNIVERSE was indeed a surprisingly amazing film from Director and writer Julie Taymor. Taymor visually displays the tumultuous 1960s, and uses the most popular and influential music of The Beatles, which brought the generation together. Besides the music, the story line and the very artistic images make the film, which conveys the confusion, revolution, and love that was generated by one of the most misunderstood generation.<br /><br />The interesting aspect about the film is that the six major characters possess names from Beatles songs. First, there is Jude ("Hey Jude") from Liverpool, England, who takes a respite from his job as a ship dockworker, and heads for New York City to find his long-lost father who works as a janitor at Princeton University. Second, there is Lucy ("Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"), who waits for her high school sweetheart who is fighting in Vietnam. Third, there is Max ("Maxwell's Silver Hammer"), Lucy's brother, a Princeton dropout, who moves to Greenwich Village and becomes a taxi-driver, but is later drafted into the war. Fourth and fifth, Sadie ("Sexy Sadie")and Jo-Jo ("Get Back"), the musicians in the film who are a cross between Janis Joplin and Jimi Hendrix, but act more like Ike and Tina Turner. Sixth, Prudence ("Dear Prudence"), the lesbian-cheerleader from the Midwest, drifts in and out of the picture.<br /><br />There is plenty of symbolism in the film that crosses a variety of genres, which include music, art, and politics.  Foremost, the images in the film represent the events that shaped the Sixties, such as the Anti-war movement, Civil Rights Movement, Vietnam War, hallucinogenic drugs, and free love. And the highlights of the film is the appearance of Joe Cocker and his rendition of "Come Together," and U2's Bono who plays Dr. Robert and sings "I Am The Walrus," (he almost looks a little like Dennis Hopper's character in EASY RIDER).<br /><br />Overall, ACROSS THE UNIVERSE is a no nonsense entertaining film that relives one of the most powerful periods in American history. At times, the images of yesterday almost resonate an ironic present.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL.html">A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL</a><br/><p>Everyone from U2's drummer, Larry Mullen, Jr. to the person on the street knows about the universality of The Beatles' music.  `Across the Universe' works very well using a sketchy story that shows the effect of their music on people's lives.  Not entirely detached from the everyday person presented in films like 'Forrest Gump,' the film manages to mix the mundane with an extraordinary inner voyage.  Love and music have provided people transcendence for centuries.  What makes 'Across the Universe' distinctive is its ability to contrast typical lives as they are transformed, especially here by the Beatles.<br /><br />A song can paint a thousand pictures.  "Hey Jude" is Paul McCartney's lyrical masterpiece about seeking consolation during painful transitions in life.  It may be about Jane Asher or Julian Lennon to him, but the way it's created makes it a lyrical goldmine for everyone.  That's why any film that manages to venture into a voyage using The Beatles' music could easily become a disaster.  (Even the Beatles' own `Magical Mystery Tour' has been rendered flawed at best.)  After seeing this movie, I wondered why no one thought of it earlier.  Much of this vision couldn't have been conceived without digital enhancement, but even then, no outing bereft of imagination can be launched at all.<br /><br />To me 'Across the Universe' succeeds where an admirable attempt of, say 'Tommy', fails.  First of all, fluidity is present.  It is a musical first and foremost, and the "ordinary people" who sing give us admirable, heartfelt performances, making their transformation tangible and audible.  The choreography and computer graphics put on a real show--only occasionally veering close to being stiff or maudlin.  It is also well-rounded, bringing the Peace Movement (with all its attendant flaws), the Black Movement, and the Generation Gap in ways that preserve the music's integrity and universality.  There's a story molded by the music, not the other way around.  Some of the songs selected were huge hits; others were obscure masterpieces.  It seldom feels forced.<br /><br />There's also the risk of becoming clich&eacute;d.  All of the characters in the movie have Beatle names delivered in a natural way.  There's the protagonist, Jude (Jim Sturgess); his love interest, Lucy (Evan Rachel Wood); a sexy, siren landlady, Sadie (Dina Fuchs); her lover and bandmate, JoJo (Martin Luther McCoy) and Prudence (T.V. Carpio), a lesbian companion who catches up to them.  We meet all sorts of characters along the way, including the Psychedelic companions Dr. Robert (Bono) and Mr. Kite (Eddie Izzard).<br /><br />My first objection to the film was seeing the bleak landscapes.  Jude is from Liverpool, and all of the friends end up together in New York (significantly John Lennon's major digs)  where the landscape is quite bleak.  There are factories belching out pollution, boxy city dwellings with dreary views, and a dingy laundromat and a bowling ally.  But this is really the point.  Whenever people break out into song, they are brimming with falling in love, expressing outrage at injustice, and reeling with the joys of music and alternative consciousness.  Although some of the nightmares of drug use aren't presented with the dreams, the flow of these dreamscapes is stunning.  In contrast the horrors of reality are presented:  of separation, of war, of death, of addiction.  Each shows the universal need for escape and some solace.  What keeps people humming in life more than a landscape of Beatles' music?<br /><br />There may be objections that the movie never really ends.  It is, in a way, a never-ending story.  But the film does end properly enough with a focal point, one that needs little explanation or apology.  'Across the Universe' may not be everyone's vision, but it is a wonderful vision extremely well done.</p></br><a href="../users/A31I3HXMD5H1EL.html">A31I3HXMD5H1EL</a><br/><p>For a generation, the only Beatles-themed musical was the abysmal "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band", and, truthfully, I feared director Julie Taymor's "Across the Universe" wouldn't be much better...but happily, I was wrong. This is a remarkable, multi-layered rock tribute of an era that not only homages the music of the Fab Four, but may just be the finest musical in years!<br /><br />Closer in spirit to Milos Forman's "Hair" and Ken Russell's 70's extravaganzas, the story of Jude, a lad from Liverpool (Jim Sturgess), his American friend, Max, a footloose anarchist Ivy Leaguer (Joe Anderson), and Max's sister, Lucy, a pampered rich girl (Evan Rachel Wood), echoes Forman's exuberance in recapturing the spirit of revelation, experimentation, and disillusionment that was the heart of the 1960s. The trio winds up in a Bohemian, free-spirited Manhattan, bonding with Joplin-esque singer, Sadie (Dana Fuchs), Hendrix-inspired rocker, JoJo (Martin Luther McCoy), and sensitive lesbian, Prudence (T.V. Carpio). This opening third of the movie is so exuberant and heartfelt that you may catch yourself singing along to Beatles' anthems like "A Little Help from My Friends" and "I Wanna Hold Your Hand".<br /><br />The film nearly loses itself in Russell-like visual overkill as it slides into the psychedelic drug culture, personified by acid guru Dr. Robert (Bono), and counter-culture showman, Mr. Kite (Eddie Izzard), but Vietnam, race riots, and the anti-war movement restores a balance to the story, with a moving rooftop finale reminiscent of the climax of the Beatles' final film, "Let It Be".<br /><br />After the grim, off-kilter musical, "Chicago", it is refreshing to see a film combine music and story in a celebration of life and love. The cast sings Lennon/McCartney and Harrison superbly, the choreography of the big production numbers is inventive and often amusing, and, best of all, there is a youthful optimism and energy in every aspect of the production that is infectious.<br /><br />"Across the Universe" proves movie musicals aren't dead, they only need the right inspiration...This is a film you can cherish!</p></br><a href="../users/A2FWEZ0QS8N7A7.html">A2FWEZ0QS8N7A7</a><br/><p>Well, you knew it had to peak with Hey, Jude and Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds, and it does, on the rooftops of New York with romance to spare among the water storage tanks required by city code.  It's sappy, but it works, not least because it's been an entertaining ride getting there with two sympathetic and scrappy lovers.  The closest ancestor of Across the Universe is Moulin Rouge, a movie I found just annoying.  Not so with Universe -- most of the Beatles songs are performed adequately or more, and some, e.g. Dear Prudence, Revolution, and She Came in through the Bathroom Window, mesh nicely with the loose plot.  It's not the least about the Beatles, but is loosely about the 60's as seen through some of the Beatles' songs.  Call it the 60's that nobody and everybody lived.  Many of the sequences are drenched in color, and a few are over-choreographed, to simulate -- perhaps -- the distortion of color and time when high. But most of Across the Universe is a rush, and the dancing, when not over long, is high energy and imaginative. In the end, the movie may be like the 60's themselves, a great run, a little silly, and not quite as world turning as some of the participants may have wished or believed.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>ACROSS THE UNIVERSE is a stunning musical paen to love, loyalty and commitment.  Set against the turbulent 60s  anti-war sentiment, the movie is magical and amazing in its effortless segues into the classic Beatles music.<br />Not since WEST SIDE STORY has a musical been so insightful into the cultures of the time.  Under imaginative and superb direction, the cast is superlative.  Evan Rachel Wood is a luminous Lucy' Jim Sturgess is wonderful as Jude and the support from Martin Luther, Dana Fuchs and Joe Anderson is strong.  Cameos by Joe Cocker and Bono sweeten the mix.  The music---well, what other contemporary musicians have amassed such a wide variety in style and endurance?<br />ACROSS THE UNIVERSE deserved better commercial success but if you like a great musical film, this one should grace your repertoire.</p></br><a href="../users/ARYSE5JQ3AG7L.html">ARYSE5JQ3AG7L</a><br/><p>Watched it while on vacation<br />Movie was well done, like Moulin Rouge but in it's own niche.</p></br><a href="../users/A15YPJLKLZS0MK.html">A15YPJLKLZS0MK</a><br/><p>This is a rock musical set in 1960s America.

He meets up with Max (Joe Anderson) at the college Jude's father works at and they become friends. Jude then falls for Max's sister Lucy while Max gets shipped to Vietnam and Lucy joins the cause as well.<br /><br />What makes the movie extraordinary are the Beatles songs that are interwoven into the story and the way that the characters sing them (especially Jim Sturgess and Joe Anderson.)<br /><br />A very powerful movie whose music will stick with you long after you see it.</p></br><a href="../users/AM2PV53UX1JEQ.html">AM2PV53UX1JEQ</a><br/><p>Julie Taymor's incredibly energetic homage to the music of the Beatles has an undeniable pop power, driven largely by an overactive imagination and those indelibly perfect songs.  I found the music to be truly affecting, gorgeously and creatively arranged and winningly sung by the game young cast.  The plot is really an excuse for production numbers and specific songs to make their way into the film, but as a loosely strung together series of such moments, darned if it doesn't start to become emotionally engaging.  The wonderfully anachronistic appearance of Bono as a trippy dippy new age psychobabbler delights, as does the almost unrecognizable Eddie Izzard.  It all moves quickly, and many of the visuals have the jagged, sincere look of a senior film school thesis.  But by the time everyone is singing Hey Jude and All You Need Is Love, I dare you not to smile...it's hard to resist!</p></br><a href="../users/A1IWWRZJOXOSYP.html">A1IWWRZJOXOSYP</a><br/><p>"Across the Universe" is a stunning movie musical.  Comparisons to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000077VR3">Moulin Rouge! (Widescreen Edition)</a> are well-founded.  Julie Taymor, whose last film in 2002 was the visually stunning <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JLPK">Frida</a>, brings those skills to this project.  Usually, American audiences have to go to Chinese cinema such as "Heroes" or "House of Flying Daggers" to see such visual creativity.  Also starring in this production is the incredible music of the Beatles that holds up well today, even the more lyrically challenging songs like "I Am the Walrus."  I appreciated the way that the script used the songs to carry the story forward from the first opening song on the beach, "Is there anybody going to listen to my story all about a girl who came to stay" through to the end of the film.<br /><br />Taymor brings new faces to the screen who have been cast with a master eye since they fit so well and perform so brilliantly.  Lucy is played by Evan Rachel Wood who performed in one of my favorite films of 2005, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JNP4">The Upside of Anger</a>.  She shows great range as an actress and is in good voice in the film.  Jude is played by Jim Sturgess who has acted in quite a few British TV shows.  He does a great job as the guy from across the ocean who comes and gives perspective to the cultural unrest during the Vietnam era.  Joe Anderson who played Henry Austen in Becoming Jane plays Max Carrigan, Lucy's brother.  All three of the leads act and sing amazingly well.<br /><br />The supporting players are also a strong cast.  Newcomer Dana Fuchs plays Sadie, the landlady rock star.  Her rock numbers are show-stopping stunners.  JoJo the lead guitarist is played by Martin Luther McCoy.  T.V. Caprio does a good job as Prudence who comes in through the bathroom window.  Lucy's boyfriend who is killed in Vietnam is named Daniel and played by Spencer Liff who recently played in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W4KT64">Hairspray (Full-Screen Edition)</a>.  Rocker Joe Cocker plays the bum, the pimp & the mad hippie while U2's Bono plays the crazed Dr. Robert.  Eddie Izzard's talk/sing and inane additions to Mr. Kite were the only part of the film that didn't work so well for me, although visually it was stunning.<br /><br />The one sequence that resonated with me was when Max has to report for induction into the army.  The military strips the guys down to briefs or boxers; and they slide across conveyor belts.  This segues into one of the most stunning images of underwear-clad inductees tromping through the jungle carrying the Statue of Liberty on their backs.  The film achieves a universal appeal as we relate the war of yesterday to the war of today.  "Across the Universe" is an excellent piece of cinema, one I'm sure to want to play repeatedly when the DVD is released.  Bravo!</p></br><a href="../users/A3KJ6JAZPH382D.html">A3KJ6JAZPH382D</a><br/><p>There have been several movies that have tried to make the music of The Beatles a central focus of their reason d'existence. Some - like The Beatles' own <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000542D2">A Hard Day's Night</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000JRUQ">Yellow Submarine</a> - are perfect, some are not (the dismal "All This and World War Too"). Even the camp classic <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009APB6">Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band</a> was so bad it was worth seeing because of the music. Heck, even the forgettable <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005TT77">I Am Sam</a> raked in a killer soundtrack thanks to John, Paul, George and Ringo.<br /><br />But they've got nothing on "Across The Universe." Taking the turmoil and tumult of the sixties and re-imagining it through the lyrics of Beatle's songs, it is a trippy, hallucinogenic ride that is a visual and sonic feast. Jude (from Liverpool, naturally) comes to the US to find his American soldier dad (Robert Clohessy, a regular from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00031TYBC">Oz - The HBO prison drama</a>) only to collide with rich kid renegade Max and then to fall for his sister, Lucy. Suddenly, they find themselves in NYC with a Janis Joplinish landlady, Sadie, and her Jimi Hendrixian boyfriend, Jojo.<br /><br />The sixties then take their turn into the war, and the drama unfolds as Jude falls for Lucy ("I've Just Seen a Face"), Max finds himself drafted ("I Want You") and Lucy falls under the spell of the anti-war movement leader. Each point is often brilliantly illustrated, and director Julie Taymor tosses subtlety out the window for several of the film's best sequences. In particular, when Prudence sings "I Want To Hold Your Hand" as a lament for a love that can't speak out loud, football players fly through the air and collide as she walks through them. When Max gets to his indoctrination and the exaggerated GI Joes march in "stomp dance" style to "I Want You," it's breathtaking. While the narrative occasionally falters, the visuals and set pieces never do.<br /><br />Of course, there is the music. While there's nothing earth-shattering here, all the actors acquit themselves just fine. The small handful of cameos are great, especially Joe Cocker singing "Come Together" as three different characters, and Bono playing the Ken Keasey Electric Kool-Aid guru Dr Robert on the magic bus, promoting his new book titled (heh heh) "I Am The Walrus." (I could have done without Eddie Izzard's "Being for The Benefit of Mr Kite," even if the sequence is sufficiently madcap.) But this isn't a sloppy kaleidoscope like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000067L8">Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band 1978 Soundtrack</a> was; other than the three men mentioned prior, there are no stars here. In particular, Sadie (Dana Fuchs) and Jojo (Martin Luther McCoy) give dynamite performances, and other than Evan Rachel Wood, the cast is relatively unknown.<br /><br />I really can't say enough about the pleasure I got from "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WCBPOG">Across The Universe</a>, and it may be the first time you walk into a theater humming the songs. I was skeptical at first, because many of the reviews I'd read were not kind. But I have a feeling many of them were written by folks of a more tender age, lacking the comprehension of the times portrayed on screen. One of the most fun things about this movie was catching the goofy Beatles' homages sprinkled in the film's dialog (favorite, when Prudence sneaks into the Sadie's communal apartment and someone asked where she comes from, Jude replies "she came in through the bathroom window").<br /><br />This is also a recommendable movie for one other reason. It isn't. When I say 'it isn't,' I mean, not a sequel, not a rip-off of a TV series (old or new), not a remake and some lowbrow teen sex-romp. There isn't anything cloying or coy, and while the movie is certainly political, the politics you get from it will be what you read out on your own. "Across The Universe" is as relevant today as it was when when The Beatles sang "But if you go carrying pictures of Chairman Mao, you ain't gonna make it with anyone anyhow." Grab your popcorn, sit back, relax and float downstream.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>When I first saw the trailer for "Across the Universe" I was pretty sure that I was going to like it.  I have dozens and dozens of covers of Beatles songs, having put together playlists for each of the Beatles albums, in many instances having been able to find cover versions of all of the songs on a particular album.  Also, in my youth, I contemplated a stage musical that would use the songs of Stevie Nicks to tell the story of the Welsh witch Rhiannon, so I appreciate the inclination.  Besides, with 200-plus Beatles songs, the problem would not be finding enough songs for an entire musical but rather drawing a line and getting the finished movie in at under 2 hours.<br /><br />I would have said that using the music of the Beatles as the soundtrack for a movie is a fool proof idea, but that was because I was taking the idea at face value and had forgotten about "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009APB6">Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band</a>."  Then I remember that "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000066HAS">I am Sam</a>" used contemporary covers of Beatles songs, but that example is really not on point since they are used in the background, the way Simon & Garfunkle's songs were used in "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00079Z9VO">The Graduate</a>."  "Across the Universe" is a more traditional musical, even if it is, in Roger Ebert's memorable phrase, a musical "where we walk into the theater humming the songs."<br /><br />Before we are a minute into this 2007 movie I knew it was going to work, as soon as Jude (Jim Sturgess), sitting on a stormy beach, turns to the camera and sings: "Is there anybody going to listen to my story, All about the girl who came to stay?"  I was reminded of the beginning of "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000060OFT">William Shakespeare's Romeo & Juliet</a>" when the newscaster does the whole "Two households, both alike in dignity..." prologue and I knew this "modern" version was going to work.  It is not often when a movie is able to convince you in the prologue that it is going to work, but when it does (e.g., "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CX8Y">Beauty and the Beast</a>," "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000AOV4I">Sleepless in Seattle</a>"), you tend to remember them.<br /><br />Because the characters all have names from Beatles songs, from Jude and Lucy to Sadie, Jo-Jo, and Prudence, there is an expectation that the songs from which they get their names are all going to pop up during the proceedings (or the end credits).  But that does not prove to be the case.  Sometimes a single line from a song pops up, so Beatles fans need to pay attention even when characters are not singing.  The plot is basic boy (Sturgess's Jude) meets girl (Evan Rachel Wood's Lucy), boy loses girl, on to the requisite happy ending, played out against the turmoil of the 1960s, which means the War in Vietnam, the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr., and the like.  Part of the fun is seeing the new contexts in which these familiar songs pop up, both in terms of the times, as with "While My Guitar Gently Weeps," "Strawberry Fields Forever," and "Happiness Is a Warm Gun," and in terms of relationships, like with "I Want to Hold Your Hand."<br /><br />Julie Taymor previously directed "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E6ESKS">Titus</a>" and "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JLPK">Frida</a>," it is not surprising to those relatively few souls who have seen both of those films that she pulls this one off.  A major treat here is seeing how Taymor makes specific lyrics work so well, from the "Won't you come out and play" from "Dear Prudence" to the "Jude, Judee, Judee" part of "Hey, Jude," and even a "duh" moment when she works in "I Want You (She's So Heavy)."  I can also add to the list the nice use of the final chord from "A Day in the Life."<br /><br />The cast are relative unknowns, with Evan Rachel Wood the most familiar fact (but when Taymor suggests on the bonus disc that nobody knew Wood culd sing I have to respond that everybody who saw the final episode of the second season of "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009F43FY">Once and Again</a>," where Wood sang "Red Red Robin" after the wedding was well aware Wood can sing).  It says something of the quality of the singing if I say that Wood might be the weakest vocalist in the cast and I have no complaints regarding what she does on .  Dana Fuchs' Sadie was my overall favorite, belting out "Helter Skelter," "Oh, Darling," and "Why Don't We Do it in the Road?"  But I could listen to Sturgess sing just anything, and it was great to have Joe Cocker show up for "Come Together."  Some of my favorite parts here are the harmonies, most notably on the gorgeous version of "Because" the cast sings laying en masse in a field.<br /><br />Yes, I know all of the songs are available on the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WCBPOG">soundtrack</a>, and that is fine for driving around in the car, but listening to these songs on the DVD is way better.  Despite all the visual treats, "Across the Universe" is a great movie for playing in the background.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L9MIIBI7409N.html">A1L9MIIBI7409N</a><br/><p>When I first came across Across the Universe, it looked a little esoteric, even with the musical pedigree of the Beatles.  But from the first minute when Jim Sturgess sings "Girl" - it all makes sense.  You have to really respect how well the Beatles' musical legacy has been woven into this effort. Lennon, McCartney, Harrison and Starr made some of the greatest music of the 20th century and besides being a nice movie, Across the Universe really puts that into focus.  The power of the songs comes alive at every turn.<br /><br />Vividly imagined with beautiful art direction and cinematography, Across the Universe expertly weaves the Beatles into the socio-political context of the times the songs were written in.  Hats off to director Julie Taymor and team who clearly thought this out very well, and the excellent cast who all sing better than anyone would expect.  This is quite a feat, considering that it could have come off cheesily or poorly done.  Actor Sturgess reminds me of a young Paul McCartney but that's where the resemblance to anything Beatles ends.<br /><br />It's a pity Across the Universe didn't succeed as well in the theatres, but I suspect that the treatment may have been too intelligent for today's audiences.  It's a movie that comes from the heart that every Beatles fan should watch and those curious about the music can check out.</p></br><a href="../users/A18758S1PUYIDT.html">A18758S1PUYIDT</a><br/><p>Perhaps it's lost something on the transfer to the small screen.  At any rate, Julie Taymor's latest feels overwrought in the way that only movie musicals can feel.  Visually stunning? Yes, but it's obvious that the story was painfully forced into shape by cobbling together various Beatles songs.<br />For what that's worth, the renditions of the songs are quite listenable. Bono in particular does a great job with "I am the walrus," while the "Come Together" sequence is both fun and scary to behold.<br />Take away the silliness of the scenes and you have a fantastic soundtrack.  In fact, I'd probably recommend that in the end.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>There was a point where, upon going to the theater to see Spider-Man 3 (theater packed with kiddies keep in mind), the trailer for Across the Universe came on. Starting out with male lead Jim Sturgess singing directly to camera, a bit of snickering came from the crowd. Not quite the response the film would eventually garner but filmgoers were rather unsure of what to make of the film with some loving it while others either hated it or didn't even bother to go see it. While the film isn't one of those "best films no one saw", it's kind of surprising how lukewarm the reaction was.<br /><br />The story's really a cliche love story set in the 60's with the use of Beatles' songs for narrative or just coloring. But a more detailed story is that Jude, a British worker, travels to America to find his father and on the way meets Max, a wild do-whatever-I-want kid who comes from a rich but stuck-up kind of family. Jude meets Lucy, a girl who just recently lost her boyfriend in the war in Vietnam and the 2 end up falling in love. But with the war going on and Lucy getting motivated and Max getting drafted, the 2 have to stick together...all the while singing Beatle songs.<br /><br />For the life of me, I could never get into musicals. Aside from Disney films, I couldn't get past the idea that characters would all of a sudden break into song and dance but with the Beatles catalogue as the songs, it's not all that bad. Sung by the actors, the songs get different interpretations that in some cases, and this is gonna turn heads,("blasphemer!"), is even better than the originals. Songs such as "Dear Prudence", the title and "Strawberry Fields Forever" strangely just sound better and the actors do good jobs; Sturgess particular with his sort-of Beatles-y vocal tone and Dana Fuchs with her Joplin-esque wail. However, some don't work such as "For the Benefit of Mr. Kite!" which is not only way too strange looking but it doesn't even feel like a song and it drags the pace while "With a Little Help From My Friends" and "Come Together" could've been taken out as well.<br /><br />But this is a film and to that end, it's sort of a polarizing one since on one hand it's visually inventive with tons of strange, abstract and even beautiful images and on other occasions it's long, nothing in terms of character development and it even runs a little long. Then there's other just strange stuff as having characters named after Beatle songs (Hey Jude, Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds, Dear Prudence, Doctor Robert), 60's references (Jojo and his Hendrix look/sound) and odd character/song use such as the character Prudence singing "I Want to Hold Your Hand" to a fellow cheerleader implying an unrequited lesbian attraction which she then feels towards Sadie which then gets dropped out completely.<br /><br />As I was nearing the end of the film, one thought struck my mind: I could rewatch this again one day. While some might hate it and I don't necessarily love it, I wouldn't mind owning it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GA2SO3YK6CXI.html">A2GA2SO3YK6CXI</a><br/><p>Across the Universe is just magnificent, especially if you enjoy Beatles songs. Set in both Liverpool, England and the United States, the film provides a view to the Vietnam War era and the challenges faced by those living lives that were impacted by the death of loved ones during a War that many protested, avoided, and / or despised. There is much political and social unrest going on, we see the Rainbow buses, the issues with drugs, and the social unrest that ends in clashes with police and the assasination of Martin Luther King.<br /><br />The central characters are played by Jim Sturgess, whose name is Jude and Evan Rachel Wood, who plays Lucy, a beautiful young girl who sees her first love drafted and go to war only to then attend her first ever funeral, as she sees her boyfriend, decorated as a hero... but buried...<br /><br />Her brother Max, played by Joe Anderson, soon is drafted as well, and her anger at losing those she loves, makes her become part of the protesting groups, at some point endangering her life. All characters move to New York City, where they find an apartment ran by a singer named Sadie, played by Dana Fuchs, who is dating a guitar player by the name of JoJo, played by Martin Luther. As you may be beginning to realize, all names lead to some of the best Beatles songs of our times, and as the plot develops, all circumstances result in listening to our favorite tunes.<br /><br />These young characters are in turmoil over the war, Jude, who is from England, finds that he has no cause and therefore is able to stay outside of the individual turmoil that is consuming his friends, but he falls in love with Lucy and as she gets deeper and deeper into the groups that are protesting the War, Jude finds himself embroiled in the thick of it and because he is in the USA without the appropriate Visa, he is soon sent back home.<br /><br />They want to change the world, to make the world a better place, to hold on to the belief that it is all about love and that love is all we need. But the reality is that emotions are too powerful, hatred reigns, misunderstandings are powerful, and the clash leaves many suffering the consequences of the War.<br /><br />If you like a good dramatic romance, we recommend this movie, but if you simply LOVE Beatles songs like we do, we hope that you obtain this DVD and enjoy excellent music, and a plot that puts the times in perspective for us.  Enjoy!!</p></br><a href="../users/A30TK6U7DNS82R.html">A30TK6U7DNS82R</a><br/><p>I went to see ACROSS THE UNIVERSE in San Francisco with an appreciative crowd and a great artist as my date (*Wayne Smith*) a man who had been an obsessive fan of the Beatles as a boy.  He wasn't sure how he could handle Julie Taymor's interpretative take on the Beatles' music, but by the end of the movie he was all smiles.  She has done a magnificent job of rethinking what the Beatles were trying to do with their music, and yet by setting it in the sixties she seems to be underlining how very long ago it was!  I kept looking at the dingy, scarred up Manhattan pictured in the film and wondering how they could afford the budget they must have used to slum it down.  Same with Liverpool--could it really be as dire?  And yet the press materials the theater handed out insisted that the opening scenes were really shot in the Cavern Club and not some studio recreation.<br /><br />I loved the movie, but yeah, all through it I kept thinking that, even if it is not a disaster on the scale of that Robert Stigwood Sgt Pepper film, it certainly has script problems!  Evan Rachel Wood--love her, but she is not capable of playing the part of Lucy and convincing us of her passionate love for a boy killed in VietNam, her radicalization as a result of his death, or a growing comradeship with a charismatic movement leader.  She can sing, but her overenunciation reminds you of Julie Andrews or Barbra Streisand trying to go rock.  Wood is excellent however in her scenes with Jim Sturgess who plays Jude, but even there, the storyline sinks with predictable tension built into the storyline (as an allegory, I guess, for the way the 60s collapsed of their own weight).  Sturgess is enormously appealing when he smiles--a star is born--but when he's grim or trying to act tough forget it, it's not on his calendar.<br /><br />The other performers are very good but basically, script problems ruin the story.  The commune setup run by sexy landlady Sadie is cute but you've seen it all before done much better in HAIR and RENT.  Indeed ACROSS THE UNIVERSE should be paying HAIR and RENT royalties for all the setups the new film takes from these older touchstones (can't call them classics exactly).  The giant "I Want You" number just replays the title sequence in "Hair" of the draftees moving through the system in their undershorts, stripped of their human rights and turned into machines, though it adds a few surrealist touches like the scene in which GIs lift a statue of liberty onto the camouflaged jungles of VietNam.  There's also a Wall Street bit right out of HAIR, while the RENT parallels are too many to mention.  (Couldn't they have just hired Adam Pascal--Roger in RENT--to play Max in ATU, instead of directing poor Joe Anderson to mimic him in every single detail of acting, singing, tossing his hair?)  Nevertheless one watches the movie in fascination at so much daring, so much imagination, so much sheer Busky Berkeley craziness thrown up at the screen in a titanio effort to take you to a strawberry fields-like place in your mind.  For me it worked pretty much, but I wouldn't recommend it to any of the sophisticated people I know.</p></br><a href="../users/A17BT73RVRQYSP.html">A17BT73RVRQYSP</a><br/><p>Any excuse to feature Beatles music is usually worthwhile, but Across the universe is an mediocre picture wrapped in a psychedelic anti-war wet dream.<br /><br />The picture has it's moments, the Character of Jude is excellent and well played by Jim Sturgess who next to the music is clearly the best thing about the picture.  The integration of the Beatles music in the picture works very well and the various musical numbers are really well choreographed, and the first 20 minutes of the picture are the strongest plotwise.<br /><br />Unfortunately besides that there is little else to recommend.  The actual performances are not to blame, most are at least passable but yet another attempt to make a "statement" movie on Iraq=Vietnam just doesn't do it.  This movie on a 45 Million dollar budget failed to make $30 mil back, that was no accident.  You can feel the self importance of the filmmakers and it can't help but turn you off.<br /><br />I'd recommend the sound track <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UZ4G82">Across the Universe</a> but unless you are a big fan of MSNBC this is a rental, worth seeing once for the musical numbers and Jim Sturgess (who I will look for in other pictures) but other than that, nothing special or important.  In fairness I can't see how the picture could ever be as important as the filmmaker thought it was.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>"Across the Universe" is a musical with Beatles songs. But do we really need another Beatle musical (after "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band") when we already have "A Hard Day's Night" "Help!" "Magical Mystery Tour" and "Let it Be"? How about fabulous "Yellow Submarine"? But of course, I may be wrong. After all, it's the Beatles and you can't go wrong with their great songs, but as far as "Across the Universe" is concerned, I am not still sure.<br /><br />You either love or hate "Across the Universe" which is directed by Julie Taymor. Her works as film director include "Titus" and "Frida" and if you have seen her previous works, which some viewers call creative while others, well, pretentious, you know that storytelling is not her forte.<br /><br />Because so many reviewers have already summarized the plot (or the lack of it) I will not go into the details of it. In short, a young man from Liverpool Jude (Jim Sturgess) meets Lucy (Evan Rachel Wood) in America and they fall in love with each other. The time is set in the 1960s, politically and socially turbulent years.<br /><br />So far, it is good. But the romance of Jude and Lucy needs a better story. Their story is clich&eacute;d, disjointed, and their romance is uninvolving. Moreover, "Across the Universe" runs more than 130 minutes, which is 40 minutes too long.<br /><br />But you might say it is a musical and it is music that matters. Unfortunately our Jude is no Paul and his singing is just passable. Besides, it seems some songs are randomly chosen, which do not fit in the story. Visually intriguing as it is, for example, the musical sequence featuring John Lennon's "I Want You" sequence is rather pointless, with one bizarre idea of "She's So Heavy."<br /><br />Also, many references to the Beatles songs and the group member's background (Jude's father, for instance) are thrown in. They are mildly amusing at first, but soon start to look shallow, even silly. You remember the song "She Came in Through the Bathroom Window." Yes, she really does.<br /><br />Some musical scenes are really brilliant ("I've Just Seen a Face" in a bowling ally scene and Joe Cocker's "Come Together" with a nice choreography). But as I said, you can't go wrong with the Beatles songs.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D3XQC2DIT.html">A1D3XQC2DIT</a><br/><p>The movie was very much like Billy Joel's Movin Out in how it set characters in the appropriate time period and made them face situations represented in the music, but instead of Billy Joel, Across the Universe uses songs only by The Beatles. And I was amazed to find out how many of the songs I would have sworn were not by The Beatles.<br /><br />In Across the Universe we see much of the 1960s American culture through the lives of a few young adults. When Jude comes to the US from England (Liverpool!) he makes some friends who will challenge the way he sees the world - as the world changes around him.<br /><br />All of the songs were sung by the cast, whether it was Jim Sturgess (Jude), Evan Rachel Wood (Lucy), or anyone else. The singing was great, the song choices were great, and the scenes into which they were incorporated were great. I'm not sure if I should praise the writers or the director or both for the scenes picked and the cast member(s) chosen to sing. There was at least one time when the singing was done by someone who was seemingly just an extra in the film and it was very powerful for me.<br /><br />I've not been able to understand the storm by which Evan Rachel Wood has taken the film industry. But she was good in this role, but more in her non-talking scenes. Her emotions are great, but I find that most of the time she comes off as too young. Separately, I thought she did a great job singing.<br /><br />The movie starts well and ends well after a short break in the middle. I thought the story took a dump for a while when working in the psychodelic 60s, but that part did feature a brilliant cameo by Bono. The story was VERY artsy. Sometimes it was a little over-the-top, others it was beautifully artistic. I really enjoyed Across the Universe and the more I think about it, the more I realized how much I liked it.</p></br><a href="../users/A126KX6FVI4T66.html">A126KX6FVI4T66</a><br/><p>A new Yellow Submarine has arrived on the back of Sargent Pepper's band?<br />Only that the music isn't original makes me stop at 4 stars.<br />The original music was 5 stars.

The film incorporates over 30 songs from The Beatles into its story and is loaded with endless references to other Beatles' songs and associated lore.  As a tribute the film is outstanding.  As a film it is as visually beautiful as any movie released in 2007 and is definitely worth owning on blu-ray if you are a Beatles fan or, at the very least, you're familiar enough with their catalogue that the many references to their music are not over your head.  The other big bonus in Across the Universe is its young cast.  The film includes great performances from Jim Sturgess and Evan Rachel Wood especially.  I did not know that Wood could sing and evidently she can.<br /><br />The story may sound secondary and it isn't particularly important, primarily because it is not the film's strength.  So I won't dwell on it too much.  It is set in the 1960s as Liverpudlian Jude (Sturgess) heads off to the states to find his father.  When he gets there he befriends Max (Joe Anderson) and his sister Lucy (Wood).  He falls for Lucy amid a backdrop of the Vietnam War and the timely protests.  There are subplots involving other supporting characters with names referencing Beatles songs (i.e. Sadie, Prudence, Jojo) as well. In addition, there are many other interesting details I should leave out.  Suffice to say, Bono as Dr. Robert singing I am the Walrus is great, and Eddie Izzard's entry as Mr. Kite is fun and perhaps appropriately reminiscent of some of Monty Python's work.  The film also includes cameos from Joe Cocker and Salma Hayek.<br /><br />There are things that might dissuade someone's interest in this movie.  Firstly, if you don't like the Beatles, then you probably won't like this.  It is saturated in everything Beatles.  Secondly, if you don't like Taymor's work then you may not appreciate this either.  Taymor tends to put style first and Across the Universe's greatest strengths, even beyond it's amazing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WCBPOG">soundtrack</a>, is how the film appears.  Taymor's films are visually immaculate and she wants everything about the story and the characters to melt into the visual elements.  She succeeds here of course and Across the Universe is undeniably a beautiful looking and sounding movie but the viewer is left to decide if they care about that or not.  There are also flashes of her theatrical influences that might strike some viewers as odd but I actually wanted even more of it.  Overall, I enjoyed the film very much and rank it up there as among the best of 2007.</p></br><a href="../users/AHABFECTNE15I.html">AHABFECTNE15I</a><br/><p>Version: U.S.A / Region A, B, C<br />Aspect ratio: 2.40:1<br />MPEG-4 AVC BD-50<br />Running time: 2:13:17<br />Movie size: 30,38 GB<br />Disc size: 48,41 GB<br />Average video bit rate: 23.65 Mbps<br />Dolby TrueHD 5.1 48kHz/24-bit English<br />DD AC3 448 Kbps Spanish / Portuguese<br />Number of chapters: 16<br /><br />Subtitles: English / English SDH / French / Spanish / Portuguese / Chinese / Korean / Thai<br /><br />#Audio Commentary<br />#Featurette<br />--Creating the Universe (HD, 29 minutes)<br />--Stars of Tomorrow (HD, 27 minutes)<br />--All About the Music (HD, 15 minutes)<br />--Moving Across the Universe (HD, 15 minutes)<br />--FX of the Universe (HD, 9 minutes)<br />#Extended Musical Performances (HD, 35 minutes)<br />#Deleted Scene (HD, 1 minute)<br />#Still Gallery (HD)</p></br><a href="../users/A2R1HAXRNU0QX7.html">A2R1HAXRNU0QX7</a><br/><p>Where to start?  There are so many things to dislike about this film, I hardly know how to start.  It's a bad film, but not like BLOODRAYNE II or BENCHWARMERS is a bad movie.  It's been made by committed, creative people who somehow missed actually stepping back and seeing that what they were making was silly, ludicrous and often quite boring.<br /><br />Why did I give it 2 stars?  Well, the one truly great thing about the film is that it reconvinced me that the music of The Beatles is a miracle...that it can stand the test of time in a way that no other "pop/rock" music can.  So that was good.  And I suppose it will turn a lot of the current teen generation on to the Beatles...I just hope they go out and listen to the real stuff.  Then they'll realize just how bad some of the renditions in ACROSS THE UNIVERSE are.<br /><br />Full disclosure time:  I'm a 44 year old man, who saw the movie with my 44 year old wife and 15 year old daughter.  The theatre was quite full (about 85%) and many, many teenagers were there...that was heartening.  My daughter liked it alot...my wife liked it okay.  All I could muster when it was over was "At least I stayed awake."  So I understand a lot of people won't agree with my assesment.<br /><br />The "story" follows a British "lad" named Jude, who in the early '60s leaves his Liverpool home to sneak into America to try to find the father who unknowingly left his mother pregnant when he was in Britain during WWII.  Jude meets up with Maxwell (Max) at Princeton.  Max is the unruly child of wealth and the two become fast friends.  Max drops out of school (naturally, since this is the Vietnam era, and being in college protected you from the draft...wouldn't YOU drop out of college just because it "wasn't for you.") and Max takes his new best buddy to Greenwich Village.  There they rent a room from Sadie, a Janis Joplin type.  Their crew is soon joined by Prudence, a lesbian from Ohio, Jo Jo (a Jimi Hendrix type) and most importantly, Lucy.  Lucy is Max's sister, who is coming to "spend the summer" with her brother, because she is grieving over the death of her boyfriend in Vietnam.  She gets over her grief awfully fast, because of course she falls for Jude...who returns the affections.<br /><br />The rest of the movie basically shows us the totally overworked, cliched view of the Village as America's heartland of music, drugs and Vietnam protest.  Every idea about the village that is presented has been done millions of times before.  The whole concept is not informed by real life, but by the filmmakers' remembrance of how the village always looked in other, far better movies.  You wonder if any of the people who made the movie had ever been to New York City.  Naturally, the all take psychedelic drugs and we get lots of scenes straight out of a '70s exploitation movie, with swirling reds and greens and images of bodies floating through mult-colored water smooching.<br /><br />Relationships struggle, the war protests grow more violent and the movie gets more and more laughable.<br /><br />But what of the music?  Well, early on, I had hope.  The film starts with our young Jude sitting on a lonely Liverpool beach, singing simply to the camera the opening lines of "Girl."  His voices aches, but he has a mischievous smile too.  I thought, "okay, this isn't bad...the song fits."  (Later, you come to realize that this young actor [in a BAD wig] can't really sing anything any other way...so you hear lots of slow aching renditions of songs that needed more texture.)  We also see a scene bouncing back and forth from UK to US of teenage kids dancing to cover bands performing "Hold Me Tight."  That was good.  But once we hear Jude achingly, slowly sing "All My Loving," it's pretty much over.  Soon after, we see Prudence, a cheerleader in Ohio, slooooowly singing "I Wanna Hold Your Hand" to the crush who will never return her love. When we first realized that she's singing about a fellow cheerleader and not the hunky football player, the audience burst out in laughter...not the good kind, either.  (Prudence would prove to be the worst character in the film..and the inspiration for a STUPID rendition of "Dear Prudence.")<br /><br />"With a Little Help From My Friends" was centered around an unimaginative night of partying with Max, Jude and Max's fellow rich, lazy Princeton classmates.  Much later, Max is inducted into the army, and "I Want You (She's So Heavy)" is used as a setting for a strange anti-war kinda thing in which all the soldiers wear creepy masks and the line "She's So Heavy" shows a group of recent inductees carrying a gigantic statue of liberty through a Vietnamish landscape.  Oh, and "I Want You" is sung by an animated Uncle Sam on an induction poster.  I found it all "heavy"-handed, recycled and vaguely offensive as an American.  Other "winners" include Jude's gutless "Revolution," Eddie Izzard's head-scratchingly weird take on "For The Benefit of Mr. Kite," and Sadie's Janis-Joplin take on "Helter Skelter."  The Beatles totally rocked that song, and yet somehow, Sadie's backup band is hardly heard in the film, and the song looses the insane nature of what Paul McCartney had meant to show that the Beatles could do a head-banging song (not that they called it head-banging in the '60s...but you know what I mean.)<br /><br />Were there NO good song renditions?  Okay, I admit some were okay.  "I've Seen A Face," set in a bowling alley, was actually fun, but it felt inspired by (or ripped-off) musicals like GREASE.  Bono singing "I Am The Walrus" reminded me how nice having a singer who actually knew how to sell a song is...even though much of the scene was generic psychedelic dribble.  Joe Cocker sang a decent "Come Together" although he didn't need any screen-time, with his heavily made-up face and cliched pimp clothes.<br /><br />Julie Taymor, the "creator" of this movie, is best known for her Broadway staging of THE LION KING.  She clearly has deep theatrical roots...but her sense of film is missing.  Many scenes feel like a theatrical staging, not a film staging.  And the movie is 2 hours and 15 minutes long...to much for such fluff.  Yes, it's fluff, even though it wants so badly to be taken seriously.  It feels way, way too much like everyone thought all the time..."oooh, aren't we clever, we worked in a joke about 'She Came In Through The Bathroom Window'?"  Also, the movie fails because almost every person in it is a terrible actor.  Even Evan Rachel Wood, the experience young actress who plays Lucy,is unlikeable.  She's a heartless brat most of the time.<br /><br />All that being said, I know others will respond to the movie totally differently.  So I'm not saying YOU shouldn't go...just that I wish I hadn't.  If you do go...I hope you enjoy it more.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>The Beatles, the Vietnam war, star crossed lovers and show-woman Julie Taymor.  That is what `Across the Universe' brings to the table.  It doesn't always work and yet it is never less than intriguing.<br /><br />Using Beatles songs as jump off narratives for plot shifts, Taymor wraps her `Shakespearian' tale around a poor artist from Liverpool who travels to America and falls in love with a girl out of his league and mourning the loss of her beloved (who died in the war).  Together they make an odd pair, born more out of division than unity (their style, taste and political aspirations all stem from separate places) and yet the stars have aligned and shown them the light.  Musically, it doesn't always work.  It seems a little too all over the place and other than Sturgess and the dynamic Dana Fuchs, the vocals don't always deliver the goods.<br /><br />That said, it is a lovely looking film (the art direction is stunning and those costumes are spot on) and it has a central flow that keeps one glued, but it doesn't always make it's point quite how it wants to, and the interwoven storylines (especially concerning Prudence and Sadie) don't add anything to the film...in fact they tend to take away.  Taymor has an issue with overthinking her productions.  She creates truly grandiose looking vehicles (you can add this in with `Titus' as one of the prettiest feature films in recent memory) and yet they are hollow, forgettable almost.  She hasn't figured out how to incorporate her obvious talent for window-dressing into a film that has substance.  Oh, and the special effects here are somewhat atrocious.  She tries to tamper with Baz's insane editing and fast paced musicality with one of the earlier numbers and it comes across messy and childish.<br /><br />It had promise, but overall `Across the Universe' falls flat.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ALOIPRR8Q06J.html">A1ALOIPRR8Q06J</a><br/><p>Across the clich&eacute;s of the 60s Beatles songs are played and it's all pretty cheesy.

The songs vary in quality dramatically, with the very worst being "Let It Be", "Come Together", and "I Want You" (as an Army recruiting musical), although given the breadth of material it's hard to single out a true low point.<br /><br />There is lots of very plastic dialogue about revolution, etc. (e.g. "We need to radicalize!"), which would be easier to take seriously if the characters weren't named Jude, Prudence, Lucy, Jojo, and other obvious starting points for musical numbers. While the film is ostensibly a love story, it it's really more an excuse to revisit the radicalism of the 1960's, with spoiled self-important whiny brats providing self-indulgent and brainless commentary on world events, with Vietnam at the obvious forefront.<br /><br />Several things should be obvious takeaways from this cinematic Hindenburg: Bono shouldn't act, Joe Cocker should never be backed by a choir, and Julie Taymor should never, ever be allowed to make another movie.

It always feels jumbled and uninspired with a focus on postmodern concepts of the period, music, lyrics, personalities etc.  The one thing that amazed me was this: despite being full of Beatles songs, lyrics, characters named from their songs, period correct clothes, drugs, sex, attitudes, and looks, it still felt as if nothing was tied together.  The Beatles songs are adventurous and organic, to me, and this movie betrayed those two things for a large portion.  I didn't expect, or want a revival show, but the material provided by this movie sucked, more or less. Only a few of the versions prove to be interesting enough to exist (happiness is a warm gun, come together, being for the benefit of mr. kite), none of the characters stand out, and the visual style is scattershot saccharine which saps even psychedelia of it's authenticity. The film is just painfully bland when it should be edgy. It doesn't allow any dramatic payoff because there's no depth, or development, it just runs along. I'm not a fan of Julie Taymor, because I find her to be a visual stylist who can't make a satisfying film from front to back, but can occasionally dazzle you. Here, she tries that and is only successful once (during mr. kite).  There are moments of good performances to be found in this movie, but the rest of movie made me forget, or at least become mad that they weren't more frequent.  This movie did make me mad while watching it because it seems that they often weren't going for anything in particular except an honorary invitation to the 21st century extravaganza club (big films without true joy, or emotion). Roger Ebert is intelligent in his opinions, but has been wrong more than once about the films he chooses to review these days, at least I didn't agree him that is.  He said he didn't even want to hear the argument that the songs weren't like the original versions, stating that they're timeless songs that belong to no one. I didn't want, or expect them to be, Roger, but you have to consider there's a reason these particular songs were chosen and are considered timeless.  It's because they were well-written and brilliantly performed pop songs.  When you take out the inspiration for these songs and make them fit your own revisionist purposes....they're not so timeless, they're disposable.  They also have no backing within a true story, it's only a plot that's as thin as the paper used to play the game Thin Ice and unconvincing like Clinton saying he had no sexual relations with...you know. Add to that the fact the brilliance with which these songs were performed is gone and often without exuberance, or true spirit. Sometimes the film and music come together and make up for this like in the bowling scene for "I've just seen a face" but these times of excellence are few and far between. The film tries to overcompensate by having every visual be a symbol and it just becomes monotonous and tiring thing to endure. It actually makes the film harder to take for me. I actually thought of walking out and kind of wish I did. I'll say the last gripe that I can remember before I end this acknowledged hate-fest of this film and end it quickly. The film takes a wide open approach to the ideology and activism of the time and in some ways presents a wide open movie full of such non-mainstream elements like casual sex, hippie posturing, Vietnam rehashing, drugs. I say non-mainstream because the 60's presents a type simultaneous naivete and danger concerning these subjects that's never developed in this movie so as a result you get the sex without the hornyness, or joy, the hippiness without the stupidity, the radicalism without the conscience, and violence...well, there wasn't really any violence in it, or drugs for that matter, it just feels fake. The film is pg-13 and it's riding R, and even material that would bypass that into the NC-17 arena, but because we're dealing with Beatles songs they don't even passably go all the way (in so many ways). This treatment feels dishonest to me and should never, ever, have been.  It makes me feel like I imagine I would if I were to watch the Sergeant Pepper movie with the Bee Gees. Like that movie, this movie should never have been made.</p></br><a href="../users/A18CRS4FLVH5YW.html">A18CRS4FLVH5YW</a><br/><p>This movie insults the music of The Beatles and musicals in general.

It's great on DVD but I imagine the cinema experience would have been even more incredible.  This is such a fantastic musical movie, and whether you're a fan of the Beatles or not, you can't help but fall in love with the music and the characters.<br />It's set during the turbulent Vietnam War protest-era and it's told brilliantly.  The characters names are picked from different Beatles songs like Lucy, Jude, Sadie and Jo-Jo to name a few.  There are more than 30 Beatle's songs that tell the story of Jude and Lucy, such as Let It Be and All You Need Is Love and obviously, Across The Universe.<br />Joe Cocker makes a cameo as does Bono in a trippy scene with him singing I Am The Walrus.<br />I cannot tell you enough just how brilliant this is.  It's so much fun to watch and you can tell how much detail and passion must have gone into the making of it.  You can't help sing along throughout the movie and it's very very enjoyable.

As a diehard Beatles fan, my initial trepidation was not wholly without warrant, seeing that the one previous attempt at crafting a movie around the Fab Four's oeuvre was the kitschy, lamentable "Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band," as bad a film as has ever stunk up the inside of a movie theater.  Faced with such an appalling precedent, I certainly did not have high hopes for this latest endeavor, which, from its previews, looked to be another Beatles-inspired travesty in the making.<br /><br />The good news is that "Across the Universe," written by Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais and directed by Julie Taymor ("Titus"), never sinks to the level of that earlier fiasco, although it does come perilously close a few times - mainly in the second half of the film when it lapses into pseudo-psychedelia of the worst kind.  But, luckily, that doesn't happen very often, and much of the film is surprisingly sweet and charming in its intentions and approach.<br /><br />It's the early 1960's, and a scruffy Paul McCartney look-alike named Jude (Jim Sturgess) leaves his home in Liverpool to find meaning, adventure and purpose in America.  While there, he falls in love with Lucy (Evan Rachel Ward), a beautiful young blond who becomes actively involved in the antiwar movement when her fiance is killed in battle and her brother is shipped off to fight in Vietnam.  Their love story is played out against the backdrop of the turbulent `60's, a time of free love, flower-power fashions, peace demonstrations, drug use, and anti-establishment radicalism, all of which find their way into the fabric of the film.<br /><br />The Beatles' canon, which served as the perfect soundtrack for that extraordinary era, is so uniquely rich in songwriting material that each fan is sure to find something to carp about regarding which songs the filmmakers have chosen to put into their film and which they've opted to leave out.  I would have preferred more selections from the band's earlier period and slightly fewer from their later, even though I realize that the latter provide the kind of narrative richness and thematic depth around which a group of filmmakers can more easily construct a full-bodied story.<br /><br />Most of the songs are seamlessly sewn into the narrative, although there are times when we can sense the scenarists stretching the material to make a certain song fit.  For instance, there's a character named Prudence who serves no real function in the story other than to give the other characters a chance to sing "Dear Prudence" to her ("Jude" and "Lucy" are marginally more forgivable since they are at least the names of the main characters in the movie).  "Across the Universe" works best when it keeps its vision simple and close to everyday life.  Conversely, it runs into the most trouble when it edges towards surrealism and stylization, often slipping over into pretentiousness and self-indulgence when it does so.  Taymor exploits her trademark fascination with puppetry and masks, but the visions she creates with them often feel outdated, cheesy and campy.  Particularly egregious is an ill-conceived scene featuring Eddie Izzard as a Timothy Leary-inspired Mr. Kite, a sequence that has the "Sgt. Pepper" movie imprimatur stamped all over it.  Bono doesn't fare much better as Dr. Robert, trapped as he is in one of the most poorly shot psychedelic nightmares since the Beatles' own "Magical Mystery Tour" movie from 1967.<br /><br />Still, these are minor lapses in a movie that is often funny, touching and captivating in its own right.  Most of the credit, of course, goes to the Beatles themselves whose songs are so musically rich and lyrically resonant that they can both define a specific era and literally reach out across the universe at one and the same time.  With their film, Taymor and her crew have captured a good deal of that timelessness.</p></br><a href="../users/A3HQXFLZ6WI70Q.html">A3HQXFLZ6WI70Q</a><br/><p>When I bought this bluray, I did not expect it to be as musical as high school musical. I was expecting it to be more like sound of music (less music, more movie). They break into songs every 5 minutes. But after a while, I began to appreciate it. This movie is really good. If a heavy metal fan can enjoy this movie, I guess the rest of you could too. Very good bluray. Very cool video. Audio is awesome too.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DHQ5WO80X1IZ.html">A3DHQ5WO80X1IZ</a><br/><p>Hit and miss musical. It's a hell of a lot better than the last time they tried to make a musical out Beatles songs (Peter Frampton and the Beegees anyone?). The storyline is generic, sort of like a TV miniseries about the Sixties; no cliche left untouched. However, some strong performances and some inventive choreography saves the day. Not everything works, but luckily no act is longer than 3-4 minutes, so just wait for the next song to begin. My favorites included a radical reworking of "I Want To Hold Your Hand" (I hear it in a completely new light now), and the scenes with the Janis Joplin-like Sadie. Oh yeah, and there's the trippy scenes with Bono as Dr. Robert and Eddie Izzard as Mr. Kite that are both pretty funny. As an added bonus, the soundtrack (when not recorded by the actors) was done by The Secret Machines!</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>Across the Universe is a colorful and turblent tale of love and war in the late 1960s. Evan Rachel Wood and Jim Sturgess play Lucy and Jude who fall in love during the midst of the Vietnam War. This is a musical and all the songs are Beatles classics like Strawberry Fields Forever, If I Fell, Happiness Is a Warm Gun, I Am the Walrus, I've Just Seen A Face, and many many more. The acting and singing is superb and the plot works perfectly with the Beatles fun and moving lyrics. Look for cameos by Bono, Joe Cocker, and Salma Hayek. My favorite music number is I Want You (She's So Heavy) featuring a great new face Joe Anderson. I highly recommend this tripped-out, hippie love gem, enjoy!!</p></br><a href="../users/A3EUSH8DPW75LR.html">A3EUSH8DPW75LR</a><br/><p>This film is such a discovery and so unique.  Someone decided to take a chance and go into new territory and it more than succeeded.  A film that manages to show all the emotions and reality of what the late 60s was and to do it with very believable characters and Beatles music to boot.<br /><br />This film is more than a musical.  All emotions are expressed in song and having the characters sing them is amazingly effective.  I must say that you do not have to be a Beatles fan to admire this film.  The songs are used so expertly and so perfectly placed speaking such emotion that it's as if you are hearing them for the first time.  Also, the songs you know may take on a new meaning for they are so well interpreted here.  You also see the depth there really was to the Beatles songs, early in their career and later, for all carry an emotional wallop here.<br /><br />I found the male lead Jim Sturges as Jude the true revelation here.  His acting was superb.  His singing was amazing.  He not only had a great voice but he maneaged to evoke such sincere emotion and feelings into each song.  Evan Rachel Wood as Lucy was superb as well and seeing her here made me realize how many excellent films I have seen her in and what a great quality collection of work she is establishing. (Also, don't you love it - Jude and Lucy !! )<br /><br />The 60's defintitely live here and again the music runs the show.  Some are production numbers, some are solo pieces and some have action in the background.  ALL YOU NEED IS LOVE and HEY JUDE are both amazing.  This film will grab you and you will have an amzing experience.  Even Selma Hayek appeares in a very unique cameo and I was really wowed.  I had to give the film 4 stars for I found a few of the experimental song scenarios did not work well.  Very few, mind you.  So is this a masterpiece?  Not quite, but it is definitely one of the best films of the year and deserves a place in film history.  Excellent acting all around, great vocal interpretation with the great music selections.  And a plot that will grab you.  It shows the late 60's in a very unique way.<br /><br />I highly recomend this.  It is a must see.</p></br><a href="../users/A2Z5WEA0KOMN9G.html">A2Z5WEA0KOMN9G</a><br/><p>I'm not a huge Beatles fan, but I like their music and this movie was recommended from a Pink Floyd board that I visit.  I wasn't sure what to expect as I was going into this movie.  But I liked the way that they used the Beatles songs.  I also liked the cinematography in this movie.<br /><br />I liked the way that this movie portrayed the 60's.  And I was kind of surprised that it didn't show the protesters as being all lily white.<br /><br />Anyways, good movie.</p></br></body></html>

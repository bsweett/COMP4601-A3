He had won an Oscar also, in 1992, for Unforgiven and this movie was snadwiched between the two and, truthfully, was as solid an effort as the other two were. Meanwhile, both Sean Penn, winning best actor, and Tim Robbins, winning best supporting actor, were totally convincing. The odd man out was Kevin Bacon, who played a boyhood friend of the other two and was now a police detective. As great as he was, his role did not appear to be as demanding as those of Penn, who plays a low level hood in working class Boston, and of Robbins, who is an emotionally damaged victim of a kidnapping/sexual abuse episode decades earlier when he was a child.<br /><br />The story revolves around the three who are brought together following the brutal murder of Jimmy's daughter. Robbins, whose character's name is Davey, seems pretty much to be a nonentity. He is emotionally damaged from his horrible childhood experience and he is pretty much just a guy who hangs out in the neighborhood. Although he has a wife and son, he bears the scars of the earlier event. There are questions about Davey, however. The detective, played by Bacon and his partner, played by Laurence Fishburne investigate information that Davey was one of the last people to see Jimmy's daughter, the night she was killed after she came into a bar while Davey was drinking. Before long, the possibility that it was Davey is written off. However, Davey, haunted by his past, is uneasy about that night. Was he involved in the killing after all or, perhaps, did something unrelated happen? This is the mystery which must be solved.<br /><br />Ulitimately, there is a resolution but, this is no feel good movie so, this resolution is not necessarily satisfying. But then again, often life isn't always satisfying and what is portrayed is a gritty realism. I can't reveal any more about the events without ruining the suspense but I can add that at the very end, there is a parade scene and Jimmy's life seems to be getting on, almost as if he is able to compartmentalize and not be deeply effected by events. This emotional distance is a bit disturbing as there seems to an unforgivable detachment. But then, like I said, in real life, endings are not always what we wish them to be.<br /><br />Now, some editorial comment. There is often debate as to whether an actor should be nominated for an Oscar as best actor or best supporting actor. Robbin's role was major yet, he was nominated for and won best supporting actor. If he had been nominated in the best actor category, he would have lost to Penn. Penn's role was the pre-eminent role but, Robbins played a role that was nearly as pivotal. It is certainly a wonder as to how the academy splits hairs between a lead role and a supporting role. It could easily be argued that Penn, Robbins and Bacon shared the lead roles and were not supporting actors. A little more editorial comment: Penn and Robbins are among the most politically outspoken members of the Hollywood elite. On a personal basis, I do not like either one. Having said that, I have the deepest respect for their acting abilities and my personal feelings do not weigh in. I feel that they were both very deserving Oscar winners (given the fact that Robbins was in the supporting actor category).</p></br><a href="../users/A1FCWRSICTO2AH.html">A1FCWRSICTO2AH</a><br/><p>"Mystic River" is based upon Dennis Lehane's fine novel of the same name.  Eastwood does a good job with what it is basically a faithful retelling of the book.  Unfortunately, probably out of necessity, the novel's depths are often given a shorthand treatment that relies a great deal on its actors.  And for the most part this works.  Penn as Jimmy is terrific.  Anguished and angry, his intensity simply jumps off the screen.  He deserved the Oscar.  But just as good is Tim Robbins, as the damaged Davey.  To some extent his role is the more difficult one.  Sexually abused as a child, a middle aged failure who has nevertheless succeeded at being a good father and husband despite the psychological black hole he carries around with him.  Bacon, less so as Sean.  But his character in the novel is similarly hard to grasp, probably because he is not so locked into fate.  To some extent he has escaped, but he has his own problems even if he has moved on to a better life (if being a detective so qualifies).  On film this plays strangely, and Sean's estranged relationship with his wife, explained in the book, can only draw a "What?" from the viewer who has not read the novel.  All the supporting cast give superb efforts, contributing to the movie's long bass note of sadness and tragedy.  Still, this is a three star effort, mainly because the stakes are higher.  Lehane's novel is essentially Greek Tragedy with a Boston setting.  Perhaps Eastwood's chief error is not spending an extra ten minutes or so developing the three "friends" personalities when they were children.  Lehane provides considerable layering at the start of his novel, showing the tensions that exist between the boys (and their families), and how these tensions are fueled by the economic and social status each is born in to.  In many ways, the neighborhood, as Lehane portrays it,  is an oppressive hell hard to escape. Like the sins of our fathers, it is a millstone that is inherited.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NSUJJCG73IRF.html">A1NSUJJCG73IRF</a><br/><p>Director:  Clint Eastwood<br />Cast:  Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, Kevin Bacon, Laurence Fishburne, Marcia Gay Harden, Laura Linney.<br />Running Time:  125 minutes.<br />Rated R for violence and language.<p>"Mystic River" delves into the unspeakable world of a boyhood friendship secret, in which three young boys were confronted by a mysterious, dark man who proceeds to kidnap one of the children and torture him for days.  As the story moves to present day Boston, the audience learns that the three boys have moved on with their lives, working in different professions and starting families, but the undying enigma of their past haunts their every move.<p>Sean Penn stars as a local crook-turned-fairly successful businessman who tragically loses his teenage daughter when she is found murdered near a bar.  The initial clues lead to his molested childhood friend (played brilliantly by the creepy Tim Robbins), who was out late that night and has begun to act extremely strange around his wife and friends.  Hot on the murder case is the third of the youth trio, a slick officer (Kevin Bacon) who has separated from his wife and searching for more than just answers to a crime.  As Penn uses the underground to hopefully find the killer and put his despair to rest, Bacon's character must interrogate his disturbed long-time friend, in hopes that he really is not the vicious killer.<p>Clint Eastwood's direction is articulate and scrupulous, making "Mystic River" one of the more strikingly effective films of the year.  The first two-thirds of the film are superb, with the Oscar-winning Penn (in the role that he was born to play) morphing from a father full of anguish, into an unwavering maniac in seek of the truth.  The ending is not a disappointment, but certainly unexpected and unusual-perhaps leaving a bad taste in some mouths.  "Mystic River" is a taut, intense film that will certain strike with its excellent cast and direction, but the slightly uneven adaptation of the Dennis Lehane novel may leave some wanting more.</p></br><a href="../users/A15Q7ABIU9O9YZ.html">A15Q7ABIU9O9YZ</a><br/><p>Erwin Rommel was supposed to have made a similar comment to one of his Lieutenants while he was preparing the defenses at Normandy in April of 1944. Of course we know this is not true. It wasn't true for General Rommel any more so than it was or Sean, Jimmy and Davey when at about the age of 12, Davey is kidnapped by 2 pedophiles off the apartment bordered avenue where the three friends are playing 'street hockey' where they lived in south Boston.<p>There's a remarkable scene at the end of the movie when Sean Devine, a State Police Detective, asks Jimmy Markham if he's seen Davey? Jimmy turns to Sean and says "I haven't seen Davey for 25 years, since he disappeared in that car."<p>This is a dark movie from a dark book by Dennis Lehane of the Patrick and Angie series. The book was a painful look at people, for the most part normal people or at least people we are familiar with, traumatized by an event so miniscule that it nearly goes unreported with no room on the agenda of the Rathers and the Brokaws, but sufficient enough to last a lifetime for the three boy-men.<p>In the middle of the movie Sean Penn, who is brilliant, explains how he got together wth the mother of his now murdered daughter, Katie. The mother was apparently well above the social strata of the then 19 year old Jimmy. Penn says, "I get into that car when we're kids, I'd never have the juice to ask her out."<p>Clint Eastwood does an extraordinary job just following the book. It is scary and haunting with wounded has beens acting heroic and heroes making awful mistakes. Everyone knows their part, Laurence Fisburne as Kevin Bacon''s Sergeant is excellent, Tim Robbins as the adult Dave Boyle's superior performance nearly won him a best supporting; and Sean Penn is positively the best I've ever seen.<p>The endings remain the same; perhaps there is more to the final scenes in the book as Lehane wrote it, yet Eastwood does a remarkable job in juxtaposing one scene against another. I would be astonished if after 10 years, this didn't still rank as one of the best movies of the decade. A great, haunting, disturbing, memorable, critically acclaimed movie. Larry Scantlebury. 5 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A27RJ30RN5K9MX.html">A27RJ30RN5K9MX</a><br/><p>Mystic River is a film set in Boston that tells the story of three childhood friends Jimmy Marcus ( Sean Penn), Dave Boyle (Tim Robbins), and Sean Devine ( Kevin Bacon). As time passes the three friends drift apart, but are unexpectedly reunited after Jimmy's daughter Katie (Emmy Rossum)is murdered. Sean is now a police detective and is assigned to head the investigation along with his partner Whitey Powers ( Laurence Fishburne). The main suspect in the murder is Jimmy and Shawn's friend Dave, because he came home the night of the murder covered in blood spinning a half baked story about being attacked by mugger. However, as the film progresses, the question of Dave's guilt comes more and more into question. Now it is up to Shawn to find the murderer and to keep Jimmy from gaining revenge for his daughter's death.<p>In my opinion, Mystic River is the best film of 2003. I was literally blown away at how good this film turned out to be. Clint Eastwood shows once again that he is an amazing director. Mystic River is definately his best film since Unforgiven. The reason Mystic River is so great, is because the mystery of the killer is extremely well done. Tim Robbins did an excellent job as Dave and deserved his academy award for best supporting actor. His actions throughout the film are extremely questionable, but you are never quite sure if he is the killer. When the killer is finally revealed, it will shock you. Sean Penn gave one of the best performances I have seen in a while. His character Jimmy is a hardened ex-con who is attempting to lead an honest life. But the murder of his daughter pushes him towards his old lifestyle. Penn's performance was filled with emotion and intensity. The scene where he learns about his daughter's death will blow you away. Kevin Bacon, Laurence Fishburne, Marcia Gay Harden, and Laura Linney are all great in their roles as well.<p>Mystic River is a well thought out and emotional murder mystery. The entire cast is phenomenal, and the ending is extremely satisfying. It is a shame that Mystic River did not beat Return of the King for best picture, because even though Return of the King was a good movie, I personally thought that Mystic River was a better film.<p>A solid 5 stars...</p></br><a href="../users/A1R2URG8OHNEDS.html">A1R2URG8OHNEDS</a><br/><p>Wow! That basically sums up the entire review so why the heck am I going to waste time to write a full review for this. I'll tell you why. Because this movie was just so amazing and so great, that I want to explain to you in details what made it like that. My initial thoughts about this film, before I went to see it, would be that I would either think it was incredible and possibly one of the best films of the year, or it would be a terrible waste of time, money, and talent. I was glad that I was wrong about the latter. <p>Although "Mystic River" was not the best movie of the year, it will most positively be in the top ten, if not five, top twenty five movies of the year 2003. This is a movie on the list of this years classics of "Matchstick Men," "Open Range," "Chicago," "Adaptation," and many more. It's a thriller with just enough action to satisfy that group of people, just enough suspense to satisfy the people who are looking for that, and just enough drama to sadden the veiwer to the point where they just have to make sure the end of the movie has resolution, while more suspense is being thrown out. This movie had better suspense and a better storyline then most dramatic thrillers out there now. It sounds a little like "In the Cut," without all the sex. "Mystic River," was only rated R for it's profanity and some scenes of violence.<p>The ensamble cast was terrific. The main character probally is Jimmy Markum, who has the most conflict. His nineteen year old daughter Katie was murdered by the unknown. He sets it upon himself to find the guy who did it, and then kill him. But this is way ahead of myself. It begins with Jimmy and his friends Dave and Sean, all as kids. Writing their name is wet cement is one thing, but when two men posing as cops yell at them is another. Because they take Dave, claiming to bring him to his mother's house for ruining wet cement. Dave is missing for four days and when they catch the pedofiles, Dave becomes a little messed up. An unknown amount of years later pass and we see all of them grown up. Jimmy is Sean Pean, Dave is Tim Robbins, and Sean is Kevin Bacon. Jimmy is married to Annabeth, with a criminal record in his past, Sean is a policemen working with his partner Whitey, and Dave....well Dave is messed up. Married to Celeste and with a kid, he is still crazy about when he was abducted many years back. Jimmy's daughter Katie is killed. Sean and Whitey are the detectives who try to find out who did it. The three of them all reunite, from the abduction which seprated them apart from each other. They have their own lives, and their own secrets. <p>Celeste becomes a little confused about Dave. The night of Katie's murder, Dave came home in the middle of the night, blood covering his chest. He claims he beat up a mugger and killed him, but Celeste never finds anything about a dead mugger in the newspaper, AND Dave's story rapidily changes as the movie continues. Plus the viewer knows for a fact that Dave saw Katie when she was murdered, so Dave becomes the prime suspect in the investigation. Things begin to change, and revolations are told that begin to shift gears, all to the explosive conclusion that I seriosuly did not figure out. Crafty Clint Eastwood directs a mind boggler of a picture, what a guy!<p>The lighting of the movie gave off a dark, dismal, look on life. It made me think. It scared me, moved me, interested me, and wanted it to not end. No storng violence is present, mostly implied, by the profanity is a little strong. I look forward to reading the book. <p>I loved "Mystic River." I loved everything about it. The storyline that although is present in many movies that I have seen, is incredible. The acting plays off from the storyline strongly, making the movie oddly depressing, when in the end the message is hope. You hope for everything to end up alright, you hope for all of these sick people to stop taking young children, you hope to stop the murders, and you hope of stop the violence and the everlasting battles between bad guy and good guy. What a movie! I loved it! Definintly one of the best films of the year, and one of the best films that I have seen. See "Mystic River" now! A movie to see in the theatre, a movie to buy on video.<p>ENJOY!<p>Rated R for language and violence.</p></br><a href="../users/ATE5SA1VTJNP8.html">ATE5SA1VTJNP8</a><br/><p>Of course the performances by Penn, Robbins, etc are brilliant, but it really is the overall feeling this film left me with that makes it worth seeing.<br /><br />This is a deep character study, and poses alot of 'what if' questions. A million movies with a redemption theme have been made, what make Mystic River stand out is its candidness when dealing with the human condition.<br /><br />Abducted at a young age while playing street hockey with his buddies, Dave (Robbins)ends up escaping, and we then see him as an adult- a husband and father. When Dave comes home late one night from the bar, his wife finds him with blood stains, he claims that he was mugged, and that he fought with the mugger. That same night, Dave's niece (Penn's daughter) was murdered. And so the mystery begins. While unraveling this mystery, the three childhood friends find themselves involved in this. I will not say any more regarding the plot, but want to emphasize the extraordinary job done in developing the characters, and presenting the viewer with angles that are seldom thought of.<br /><br />Well-done!</p></br><a href="../users/A2RDR5G65D9H84.html">A2RDR5G65D9H84</a><br/><p>As a general rule I like to read the book before watching the movie. However, every once in a while it happens to me that while watching a film I think that I would like to read the novel too. This was the case with "The Shipping News", and it was also the case with "Mystic River". When I watched this production, I was constantly thinking that the story was so perfect, that the book must be great. I hope I get a chance to confirm this suspicion soon.<br /><br />Anyway, going back to the movie, the story evolves around the lives of three childhood friends that went through a traumatic experience when one of them, Dave, was bullied into a car by two adults posing as police officers. He was abused for days until he could finally escape, but something broke inside him, and all three friends where affected as a result.<br /><br />Now, Jimmy (Sean Penn) owns a convenience store and is still involved with some dangerous men from his days as a delinquent, Sean (Kevin Bacon) is a police officer who was abandoned by his wife six months ago and Dave (Tim Robbins) is a married man that lives a quiet life but still has ghosts from his past that visit him. These three men have not really been in contact with each other over the last few years, even though they live in the same city.<br /><br />When Jimmy's oldest daughter is murdered, Sean is the detective in charge of the investigation. Also, Dave was in the bar Jimmy's daughter went to the night of her death, and he later came home to his wife bearing a knife wound and alleging that he was mugged by a man that he had to kill. Once the path of the three friends converges, we find ourselves in the middle of a craftily constructed story, which has all the elements that make a great mystery.<br /><br />Besides the script being incredibly good, it allows the actors to show their best aptitudes by having very powerful scenes and a lot of interesting exchanges. If you have seen this movie it should come as no surprise that both Sean Penn and Tim Robbins won Oscars for their performances in the Lead Actor and Supporting Actor respectively. I really found no drawbacks in this film, but understand that some people may find the story somewhat disturbing. I still think that it is worth seeing by anyone that is not extremely sensitive to murder and violence.</p></br><a href="../users/A1SVXJZ3386U2D.html">A1SVXJZ3386U2D</a><br/><p>It has been awhile since a film numbed me but that was the feeling I had at the end of &quot;Mystic River&quot;.  This is an intensive psychological murder mystery.  It is a roller coaster ride that starts out fast and never slows down.  This is a movie that explores the lives of three men deeply (in degrees) affected by a savage event of their youth.  As we see them as adults, we note the different directions that their lives have led and how they become intertwined again.  The development of the numerous essential characters in the story is outstanding yet it is done so well that the action never seems to slow down.  The acting is superb with special kudos to Sean Penn who seemed to reach new heights in his already impressive career.  There is such an array of subtlety, innuendo and shock that special recognition has to be paid to the Director; Clint Eastwood.  I know that he has directed before and won the Academy Award for &quot;The Unforgiven&quot;.  However, this movie has set a new standard for him as well.  The editing somehow missed an Oscar nomination but I can't see why in as much as the movie moves along so well.  If there is a criticism, it would be the ending.  I have no dispute with how the movie ends, I just think it falls a bit short of everything that led up to it.  I have not read the book but, knowing that the book is usually better than the movie, I'll certainly have to in this case.  This is not a movie for the whole family since the subject matter is probably too intense and, hopefully, incomprehensible for pre and early teens.  The violence and profanity is not over done as seems to happen so often these days.  This is a complex story told in a kaleidescope of imagery.  We get to know most all of the characters in such a way as to be involved in their pain and suffering.  The spouse of Dave is especially pathetic in a moving manner.  I don't necessarily watch movies to become emotionally exhausted.  However, when it happens, I know I have seen a work of art.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BEU7GPGNIG44.html">A2BEU7GPGNIG44</a><br/><p>All of the actors in this film were so convincing I felt like I was watching a real story.  This film is a real downer, especially if you are a parent, but the story has so many twists and turns that at the beginning you may feel like you have it all figured out only to find out that you were wrong.  Sean Penn looks awesome in this film and his Boston accent is on point.  Kevin Bacon and Tim Robbins give excellent performances as does Marcia Gay Harden as the confused Celeste. Be wary when deciding to watch this film, although it's good it might down you out.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FEJIORC1MBG3.html">A2FEJIORC1MBG3</a><br/><p>Powerhouse performances by a skilled cast should keep most viewers riveted to Clint Eastwood's otherwise overlong and somewhat predictable neo-noir. The story of three childhood pals who suffer symbiotic personal traumas both as children and later as adults recalls classic noirs like "Out Of The Past" and "The Strange Love of Martha Ivers". Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, Kevin Bacon, Laurence Fishburne, Marcia Gay Hardin and Laura Linney inject the film with much more life than the workmanlike script deserves, and these fine actors are well worth spending the time with. We have become accustomed to Eastwood the director's character-driven, leisurely-paced and deliberate way of making films; with certain efforts it has worked beautifully ("Unforgiven" and "Bird" come to mind)-but this time out, Clint should have pulled in the reins a bit tighter. What you end up with is an extended episode of TV's "Homicide"; basically a standard police procedural with better-than-average acting. Worth a look on cable or as a rental, but it would be tough going to sit through this one more than once.</p></br><a href="../users/A1PCQHQ6NPGL9F.html">A1PCQHQ6NPGL9F</a><br/><p>Mystic River has great performances.

The only thing I think hasn't been touched on alot was the ending. Once you figure out who did it, it really isn't all that great. Why? Because when you learn the motive, it makes the movie seem kinda overdone. The performances are good, but the movie can't quite make up for that.</p></br><a href="../users/ANIMV3SPDD8SH.html">ANIMV3SPDD8SH</a><br/><p>Grim and gripping melodrama sucks viewers in to sordid tale of three blue-collar Boston playmates brought together again as adults by a tragedy. Opening sequence is very distasteful but the story settles down as the police probe into a murder swings into high gear. Acting is uniformly great and Director Clint Eastwood has an ocean of emotion to work from. The final resolution though, seems unlikely and why did the Massachusettes FBI, and not the City Police work on this case?</p></br><a href="../users/A1655SGPPUUCRP.html">A1655SGPPUUCRP</a><br/><p>"Mystic River" is, by far, one of Clint Eastwood's finest films to date.  Adapted for the screen by Brian Helgeland (L.A. Confidential, Payback, Blood Work) from the book of the same name by Dennis Lehane, the writers take what typically would have been a simplistic murder mystery/thriller and turned it into one of the most engrossing, fascinating, and heartbreaking films I've seen all year.  Essentially, "Mystic River" is about how the past never leaves us and how the events in our past, especially in our childhood, affect us as we grow older and lastly, how grief affects people differently, in both good and bad ways.<p>The movie follows the individual fates of three childhood friends and their families, Jimmy Marcus (Sean Penn), Dave Boyle (Tim Robbins), Sean Devine (Kevin Bacon), whose lives were forever changed by a nightmarish childhood incident.  The pain resulting from this incident and another that occurs to one of their children when the friends are adults is a metaphor for the river of grief (thus the title) that, unbeknownst to them all, binds each of these men together.  Grief, as it always does, brings each of the men closer together, but ultimately results in tragedy for everyone involved.<p>Hands down, this is one of the finest casts ever to be assembled on screen.  Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, Kevin Bacon, Laurence Fishburne, Marcia Gay Harden, Laura Linney.  Wow, can it get any better than that?  And it's not as if these actors are all just thrown together with no chemistry whatsoever.  They all work together so well and none of the actors end up stealing the spotlight.  Each actor disappears into their roles with startling ease, leaving their big Hollywood names behind and truly becoming their characters, Boston accents and all.<p>My only problem with this film is its last act.  Fore me, it simply did not live up to the high caliber artistry of the rest of the movie.  I was so engrossed in this film and was expecting an ending to match it, but found myself ultimately dissatisfied with the solution the writer offered.  I felt as if he'd "taken the easy way out".</p></br><a href="../users/A2MS6UV7ZGTMLR.html">A2MS6UV7ZGTMLR</a><br/><p>Mystic River opens in a dreary lower middle-class suburb of Boston in the 1970s, where 3 young friends, Jimmy, Sean and Dave are killing time just being boys, playing street hockey and getting up to minor mischief. One of them, Dave, is then kidnapped in front of his friends, by a pair of child molesters masquerading as plainclothes police. We then learn that he escaped from their clutches after four days of sexual abuse at their hands, but was obviously deeply scarred mentally. The film then flashes forward to the same area, but in the present day.<br /><br />The three guys, though they have drifted apart, are still living in the same neighbourhood. The daughter of one of the three, Jimmy Markum, played by Sean Penn (I am Sam, Thin Red Line, Dead Man Walking), has been murdered recently. One of the other three, Sean, played by Kevin Bacon (Footloose, Flatliners, Hollow Man) is the investigating police officer. The remaining member of the trio, Dave, played by Tim Robbins (Shawshank Redemption, Arlington Rd) is the prime suspect in the case.<br /><br />Mystic River is a good, old-fashioned murder mystery in which the tension and plot thickens effectively over the duration of the film. There are plenty of plot twists and red herrings to keep the viewer guessing till the last few minutes. The film is ably directed by the great Clint Eastwood, at the helm of his 24th film. In this film, like in just about all his films, he doesn't try anything flashy or groundbreaking at the helm but is sensitive and competent and builds and maintains a good pace and tension. Despite his long career in action based films, Eastwood seems particularly at ease directing (and acting) in films with a strong focus on characters rather than simply action.<br /><br />This is primarily a dialogue driven story, with powerful acting from the three leads, supported ably by some great actors including Laurence Fishburne, Marcia Gay Harden and Laura Linney. Indeed, the performances of Penn and Robbins garnered them the Oscars for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor respectively. This was the first time since Ben-Hur in 1959 in which the two awards have been won in the same film.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>MYSTIC RIVER ranks with the finest films created in the past few decades.  Clint Eastwood directs this harrowing story with a quiet brilliance that cuts right to the message of the film: everyone has an inner darkness which propels us to surprising acts at unexpected times.  This film is more Theater than movie in its intensity: the story and character development are primary and the visuals and camera work, though spellbindingly superb, are tools for Eastwood's commitment to finding the psychological core of every aspect of a group of people whose lives intersect in this almost unbearably bitter bit of truth.<p>Three boys playing street hockey on the neighborhood street in the Flats near Boston share a commitment and comraderie that is so strong that it doesn't need dialogue. During a simple act of mini-vandalism (writing their names - Jimmy, Sean, Dave - in the wet cement of their neighborhood sidewalk), one of the three is 'hauled away' by what appears to be a cop but in reality is a pedophile who subjects young Dave to four days of catpture and molestation.  Flash to the present and the three bonded boys are now middle-aged men who have little contact with each other and even less in common.  The mature Dave is haunted by his past which is never discussed but left to fester as a poisonous nidus.  Jimmy is an ex-con who operates a gang-like existance and Sean is a Boston cop whose wife has deserted him for reasons unknown.  The three are brought back together by the murder of Jimmy's daughter leading to a series of events and consequences which bring to the surface all the damage inflicted by the encounter that opens the story.  The suspense and development of the crime investigation are so razor sharp that revealing the ending would be a crime against those who have not yet experienced this movie.<p>The cast is impeccable and under Eastwood's direction gives some of the most thoroughly realized, brilliant performances on film.  Yes, individual performances can be singled out - Timothy Robbins as the mentally fragmented and fragile Dave is extraordinary, Sean Penn as Jimmy gives a performance of passionate power and pain and anguish, Kevin Bacon's understated protrait of Sean the investigating cop is the epitome of subtlety, Marcia Gay Harden shines as Dave's terrified, tremulous wife, and Laura Linney is steely perfection in the small role of Jimmy's embittered yet supportive second wife.  All of the cast, including Laurence Fishburne as Sean's cop partner, have successfuly adopted the Boston accent.  Every member of the supporting cast is exceptional and Eastwood knows how to pull natural acting from people whose experience is to this point limited.<p>The "look" of the film - that grimy, Mystic River grit atmosphere - is consistently captured by the cinematographer and the dialogue of the peerless screenplay never drops below perfect.  This is an emotionally devastating film to watch but, like the performance of a symphony that plumbs the depths of the soul, it is in the end an achievement that deserves a Bravo! - even in the muted silence as you exit the theater.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RFG9LI7JDILS.html">A2RFG9LI7JDILS</a><br/><p>Sean Penn, without a doubt, is the heart and soul of this movie... Mystic River is one of the very best of Clint Eastwood's pictures and it features highly charged emotions in a great screenplay that flows beautifully despite the length of the film... It all comes back to childhood this is something (I think) we should all know - and something the characters in this movie discover as they fumble around trying to right the wrongs of the world.. Tim robbins' character (i try to be careful not to give away plot elements) is torn inside from a childhood experience and sees the world as a place where vampires roam and suck the blood of the innocent - something he takes upon himself to venge against.. Sean Penn's character is intent on finding justice himself following the death of his daughter.. and kevin bacon (who is a cop) is obviously trying to make up for the wrongs of the world - all three try and fail - because at heart they are children (like we all are) born to suffer in an unjust world.. Mystic river will make you cry if you truly let it break through your personal barriers.. Though i am not normally a fan of such movies (i generally find them predictable) 'mystic river', despite its rehashed dramatic techniques, works out - highly recommended..</p></br><a href="../users/A13F2IV3ME23R.html">A13F2IV3ME23R</a><br/><p>Excellent acting  --<br /><br />Jimmy seems to have just stayed in his life of mafia crime.  Heading up the Savage brothers.  All relatives.  Was his second wife egging him on.  Because of her daughters was there jealousy?<br /><br />How did he feel about the brutalizing of Davey?<br /><br />Dave, of course, was still living with the trauma he suffered as a child.  Yet he still seemed to be a loving husband and father.  Was he the last one to see Jimmy's eighteen year old daughter?  What was she doing at the bar anyway?<br /><br />Sean was having his own problems with his wife.  Yet he kept up an intense search for the killer of Jimmy's daughter.  It was spine-tingling to watch the clues unfold.  When you thought you knew who the killer was something else popped up.<br /><br />And was Dave's wife eyeing Sean?  Good thing his wife and daughter showed up.<br /><br />The character of Jimmy proves that mob control never leads to justice.  What a ratty character.<br /><br />Dave's trauma was powerfully moving - he had my sympathy.<br /><br />Sean seemed to be cool and controled in the midst of chaos even with his own problems.<br /><br />This was a combination of some very powerful acting of both the men and women involved.<br /><br />It must be viewed with sensitivity and an open mind to be able to catch all of the nuances of tragedy involved.</p></br><a href="../users/AIFNOZKR9WTYI.html">AIFNOZKR9WTYI</a><br/><p>if you don't want to shell out the time and money to actually watch this turkey, here is what you need do:  just take a Norman Rockwell painting... and go to the bathroom on it.  Knowwhamsain?  Its either that or you will be forced to sit still for Sean Penn as a low-rent crime boss, who - according to his wife - could &quot;run this city&quot;, him and the mental midget knuckleheads that he pals around with, occasionally dreaming as big as to get busted for somebody else's liquor store hold-up.  Yeah, this guy's a criminal mastermind.  Then his daughter gets murdered and he has his two-man goon squad try to riot their way through the police line at the crime scene like they're in the NFL.  This, followed by a totally disgusting scene of Sean Penn IDing his dead daughter at the morgue.  Thanks for that.  I've often wanted to rubberneck at a parent's worst nightmare.  Tasteful.  If you are ever prone to philosophically wonder whether fame and fortune might have the power to turn one's mind to rubbish, just watch a Hollywood movie.</p></br><a href="../users/AD0J5KK4WQXNS.html">AD0J5KK4WQXNS</a><br/><p>I missed this film twice in the cinema and only got around to watching it on DVD after all these months. Since word of mouth and the reviews had tooted this murder-mystery drama vehicle as Clint Eastwood's best thing since "Unforgiven" and with a cast to die for, Mystic River seemed like the kind of film that I would actually prepare my day around watching. Mystic River was not only a major disappointment but begs to ask questions about how this film got such acclaim? Was it on the bases of the book's following? Is this a case of what looks good on the page not translating to the screen? No it is more than just that - the acting is a way Over The Top (wait for Sean Penn to start crying out for his daughter in a crowd of officers) and at times appears as if the actors and actresses are aware of the camera (wait until the last scene to see this at its most distracting). Okay so we could live with a little OTT, but not only is the story really overacted but it is just plain bad and is terribly, terribly, slow (and this is coming from someone who watches Tarkovsky - no problem). So when I say slow I mean S-L-O-W is a sort of Steve McQueen "Bullet" sort of way where things are almost done in real time and nothing happens for up to ten minutes on end. People in the room fell asleep while watching this. Yes Eastwood manages to give us one of these long five minute shots where people sit around talking about grief - then in the next scene does exactly the same again! We where waiting maybe one hour and twenty minutes after the murder for something to happen, and it does, but it is just pointless at that moment because you don't care and just want to get this soppy completely dull viewing over and done with and Eastwood put back in the old folks home as soon as possible. Mystic River is a low-budget direct to DVD release that has someone managed to get itself `stars' and put itself on the silver screen. Without the stars the story is JUNK, television network quality screenwriting. It seems that a domino effect may have occurred with all the actors signing on one after the other like lemmings.<p>The story, which I tried hard to avoid to read about(and wish I didn't) seems complex on the outside but is thoroughly hollow with some extraordinary scenes that totally break any realism that the film tries to employ. I would recommend Penn movie "The Pledge" or even "Sleepers" over this one any day of the week. <p>Sean Penn plays Jimmy Markum, an ex-con with a family, Annabeth (Laura Linney who turns up for about four small scenes), a daughter who winds up dead in the side of the road battered to death with a bullet in her head, a detective, Kevin Bacon playing Sean Devine, who is hot on the case with Laurence Fishburne, Whitey Powers. Tim Robbins, playing Dave Boyle, comes home one night with blood all over him and a strange story about possibly killing a mugger. His wife Celeste, Marcia Harden, believes that Dave may have murdered Jimmy's girl. Tom Guiry plays Brendan Harris, son of a criminal who was connected to Jimmy and who wants to run away with Jimmy's daughter and to leave his deaf and dumb brother and friend behind. Jimmy, Sean and Dave used to grow up together in the neighbourhood but Dave was abducted and abused when he was younger.<p>Sounds good right? Yeah this sounds like the makings of a really good crime drama, but it is all fake with the central plot revolving around Dave and Celeste's marriage breaking up and Celeste telling Jimmy what she 'thinks' she knows. So you can guess where this probably all goes in the end, but it is pointless because it is just so dull, lifeless and ultimately this movie GOES NOWHERE with an ending that is sprung from the pages of how to write a clich&eacute;d script. It is all bad bar the acting, but even at times the big names fail to bring us anything engaging by possibly trying to be too smart about something that wasn't. <p>Bottom line in this thing is that it is a disappointment and drawn out slowly over a very thin plot with cornflakes box characters. <p>Avoid and pretend that you never saw the REAL Mystic River that you heard about. Even Stir of Echoes is miles better than this thing!</p></br><a href="../users/A2GYX971VETQBV.html">A2GYX971VETQBV</a><br/><p>I was knocked out by _Mystic River_.  It truly lived up to the hype that had surrounded it for the months that I failed to see it in the theaters.  Flawlessly directed by Clint Eastwood, _Mystic River_ has all of its bases covered-great filmmaking, directing, script, actors, etc.  In the end, however, this movie comes down to the quality of the acting.  Everyone is in this film.  And I mean everyone.  While Sean Penn steals the show in my book, his character has to compete with Tim Robbins, Laurence Fishburne, Kevin Bacon, Marcia Gay Harden, and Laura Linney.  Everyone does a superb job and together they create a film that will quickly become a classic.<br /><br />Many have knocked the film for its "unsatisfying" ending.  Nothing could be farther from the truth.  One has to wonder what these audience members expected-a happy, Hollywood ending where everyone joins hands and dances around the Maypole?  Had _Mystic River_ fallen to these stale devices, the film would have blown up and taken hits for wasting all of its potential.<br /><br />In my opinion, faulting this film for not having a "satisfying" ending is just to fundamentally disagree about what "satisfying" entails.  If you want a "popcorn" flick that satisfies your desire to turn off your heart for ninety minutes, do not rent this film-it will not "satisfy" you.  But if you want an original film with a compelling storyline and complex morality, this film definitely "satisfies."  The emotions in this film are real.  The actors are real.  The performances are real.  Robbins haunting performance at the end of the film is real.  Are there loose ends?  Yeah.  Does the film leave you wondering?  Sure.  Is it a happy ending?  No way.  But all of these facts point to the very reason that the film succeeds.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TPW86OHXTXFC.html">A1TPW86OHXTXFC</a><br/><p>Dennis Lehane wrote the book and Clint Eastwood directed the movie. It is rare that a movie is equal to the book, but in this case they are both superb works of art. Three young boys friends and playmates grow up in Southie,a neighborhood in Boston. On a summer's day, Jimmy, (Sean Penn) and Sean (Kevin Bacon) have marked their names in fresh cement, and Davey (Tim Robbins) is just about to write his name when a car drives up. A man who purports to be a detective tells them they have broken the law and takes Davey with him to tell his mom. Davey goes missing and turns up several days later after running away, a victim of sexual abduction. The friendship is no more with Davey, and he has a difficult adolescence. Years later, these three men unite after the murder of Jimmy's teenage daughter. Each man has had his tribulations. Jimmy has spent time in prison, and it appears that he remains the thug as depicted. Sean Penn gives the performance of his life. Sean became the character, Jimmy. I was<br />unable to take my eyes from him- he is the center of the movie- a rough, tumbled man with passion and love for his family. Sean, Kevin Bacon, has become a detective in the Massachusetts State Police. His life has fallen apart- his wife has left him and calls frequently but won't talk- what is that all about? Sean is an honest detective, an oxymoron except in his case. And Davey, Tim Robbins is rambling through life with a wife, Marcia Gay Harden and young son. Davey's wife, Celeste has a fear that Davey is responsible for the death of Jimmy's daughter. The lives of all three men and all those who surround them are intertwined in a complex maze. Did Davey murder Jimmy's daughter?  Who and how is the young man who was going to leave town with Jimmy's daughter, involved with these people? Will Sean and his wife resolve their communication difficulties? This remarkable movie is a culmination of Clint Eastwood's directorial abilities. The praise that has been heaped is well deserved. Sean Penn will most certainly obtain an Oscar nomination for his part in this movie-he became the movie. The movie is indeed dark, but the message is clear. A movie well worth your time.`</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>Again, I haven't read the book however the Movie does it all. I am sure there are things we all wish to forget. Moments in time in which our lives and the lives of others are altered by one singular movement, one phrase, or that one hockey shot that was just out of reach. Nothing is more true when it comes to the lives of Jimmy (Sean Penn), Sean (Kevin Bacon) and Dave (Tim Robbins). Mystic River is an emotional and amazing film about the reconciliation of three friends and their wives by the tragic murder of Jimmy's eldest daughter, Katie Markum (Emmy Rossum). This rough Boston suburb that lies on the bank of the Mystic River is thrown into sorrow and misery over the loss. Jimmy (Penn) makes a vow to find the killer of his daughter and end him and throw him into the Mystic.<br /><br />The story is superb. Twists and turns and changing plot lines makes this story brilliantly unpredictable. It proves nothing is what it seems. Dealing with issues of child abduction and the effects it has on the future, Mystic River watches and deals with the change n the course of someone life. What something would be like if Dave hadn't gotten into that strangers car? Katie Markum would never had been born to be murdered.<br /><br />The acting is bar none and has been recognized by the Academy by awarding Sean Penn and Tim Robbins best actor and best supporting role at the Oscars. Sean Penn was incredible in this film. He was so into his character. An angry gangster trying to move on with his life, and get out of his life of crime and deceit. To love his children and to be the best father he can be. Strong and determined, hard and angry he tries to deal with the grief of the loss of his last real memory of his late first wife. Penn is perfect in performing this role. Tim Robbins is also and incredible actor. A man who had been abused neglected. Finally admitting to himself of the abuse he felt. He kept himself bottled and up. An angry and almost psychopathic man, who is doing his best to try and overcome the terrors he experienced by hopping in the car. An ensemble cast also included: Laura Linney, Marcia Gay Haden, Laurence Fishburn.<br /><br />Mystic River is truly amazing. Clint Eastwood is an incredible director. If you like Million Dollar Baby then you will simply love "Mystic River." Not to be missed.</p></br><a href="../users/AR37967IAR6ZT.html">AR37967IAR6ZT</a><br/><p>Now, if you're going for a thriller that will have you on the edge of your seat or if you're seeking a mystery that's plot-driven and all about the clues, then MYSTIC RIVER is definitely not going to satisfy you. I went to see it because the cast that director Clint Eastwood assembled is incredible, and the story is motivated by character-rooted actions and decisions.<p>Still, I was underwhelmed by MYSTIC RIVER. <p>Sean Penn is absolutely brilliant playing a neighborhood ex-con who becomes a successful businessman, yet he cannot escape his past when his daughter is brutally murdered. It's a role that seems like the sort of part Penn has played well before, yet there are layers to his character that are fascinating to watch. Still, at the same time, his character Jimmy never really surprised me with any of his actions. I saw where the film was pretty much going from its opening moments, and it went exactly in that direction.<p>Tim Robbins, playing an adult survivor of a childhood abduction and molestation, does incredibly well at creating a suspicious yet sympathetic character. He, though, is also saddled with a plot contrivance that was brought in from the book, where he doesn't share crucial information at a point when you would expect him to, even when he can. That's an incredibly frustrating thing to watch in any film, where you feel that the characters are withholding information merely to service the film's plot.<p>Kevin Bacon, playing the third lead character, has far less to do in the film. He's saddled with a strangely-filmed subplot involving his wife, who calls on the phone throughout the film but doesn't speak and whose face is never shown. His character, as well, isn't as well-rounded as the other leads.<p>In supporting roles, the amazing Laura Linney and Marcia Gay Harden play the spouses of men caught up in a bizarre murder mystery. Linney's closing speech at the end of the film is so good that I wished the film had more moments with her in them. Harden's final scene is compelling and heartbreaking.<p>All in all, I thought MYSTIC RIVER was an incredibly acted, flawed mystery film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NH7PYU4AD5GA.html">A3NH7PYU4AD5GA</a><br/><p>With a superb plot about the interrelated lives of three childhood friends, this movie has the emotional depth of classic Greek drama. The plot combines story lines over 25 years, of kidnapping and child abuse, armed robberies, betrayal, revenge, jealousy and murder in a completely convincing and thoroughly constructed script. I have watched it three times and am fully convinced that there are absolutely no holes in the story. Every single aspect of it is thought through and in line with the whole.<br />Yes, there is violence in the story, but does that make the movie a violent "show", as one review claims? Definitely not, much of the violence happens off screen or is not shown in a full and direct way. There is no violence peeping, no gloating in sordid details. Violence here is funtional and not overdone.<br />The actors are top notch, Sean Penn and Tim Robbins fully deserved their acting Oscars. The rest of the cast is on the same level, mainly Kevin Bacon, Lawrence Fishburn, Marcia Gay Harden, Laura Lynney. The directing is superb, Clint E. would have deserved a directing Oscar.<br />The movie, in my view, tells the story better than Dennis Lehane's novel. Apologies to the author, whom I respect a lot for his Boston crime fiction.</p></br><a href="../users/A1V3IO23FZFF9L.html">A1V3IO23FZFF9L</a><br/><p>Mystic River is a great movie.

An excellent movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L8HRCM60W0W7.html">A1L8HRCM60W0W7</a><br/><p>If there's any justice in the world, this movie is bound to sweep the 2004 Oscars. What a brilliant, haunting masterpiece from Clint Eastwood, easily his career's magnum opus as an auteur. <p>To begin my paean, this is not your average police procedural mystery. It is a mystery about human behavior, about these men, their pasts, their relationships with women, and their world (the men are brought together by a murder.) It is only about their relationships with one another as those relationships are colored by external events. As such, this is safe territory for a "guy movie" that plumbs deep emotion without feeling anything too personal. It's a story about what Real Men dream of doing, and how it feels when the dreams become real. It is difficult to address any issue in the plot without unraveling the tapestry Helgeland weaves in his screenplay. I can say that this film is full of disturbing moments, sucker-punches, and palpable anguish.<p>While the theme is not out of this world, in fact all these actors have been in a congruent role in some part of their careers, it is nevertheless chock-full of stunning performances. It may actually be a must-see for the acting alone. <p>Sean Penn nearly resembles Robert DeNiro from "Once Upon A Time In America." Kevin Bacon has matured and for the first time in many years, turns in a performance that is both dark and sympathetic. Marcia Gay Harden plays haunted better than anyone, although we don't see a great deal of range from her in this film. Tim Robbins was perhaps too obvious a choice in his role, but he delivers exactly what "Jacob's Ladder" and "Arlington Road" showed he could do before. He chews a bit of scenery, but always when it's called for.<p>Eastwood directs like a man of passion, in love with his actors and his scenery, employing long takes and two-shots to give the story a sense of real time that is too often avoided by younger directors in favor of interesting angles. <p>5/5 for the performances, screenplay and Eastwood's steady hand. But 1 point reluctantly deducted for a somewhat indulgent pace and the frequently out-of-place background score (really, it could have been more cheerful!)<p>All said and done, you just have to see this one.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>Mystic River directed by Clint Eastwood is very unsettling and difficult film to watch. The beginning is tragic and the rest of the movie is a bit slow and one-dimensional. This is not Eastwood's best film, but the acting is superb thanks to Sean Penn. The performance that surprised me the most was Tim Robbins, he never stood out in his movies but this one he does and it's amazing. This film is a mixed bag, decide for yourself.</p></br><a href="../users/A2VD2D1QHCMF9Q.html">A2VD2D1QHCMF9Q</a><br/><p>A riveting movie, with some rough spots, but overall, a thoughtful, deliberate and successful story.  It's a slice of working class life in a working class town, where there is no escaping the past.  Only in a town like this, as opposed to a big city, would the three friends at the center of the story, live in the same place and reminisce about the same things they did a generation ago.  There are so many conflicting themes, including a wife who does not give her husband the support a wife should provide, and prior friendships seem to dissolve in spite of themselves.  And at the end, the morality of actions beg the question of  . . is a painful life worth living.  Do things always turn out with some kind of poetic justice, and how is good and bad defined with respect to each other.</p></br><a href="../users/A2Q457CES5ZUZ.html">A2Q457CES5ZUZ</a><br/><p>Director Clint Eastwood made the correct decision in Mystic River to closely follow the vision and story portrayed in the best selling novel by local Boston writer Dennis Lehane.  In doing so that meant shooting the film on the mean streets of lower middle class Boston, where the struggles of those depicted contained a ringing relevance.  The script by Brian Helgeland follows Lehane's story closely.<p>The story reveals activities of three Boston men from youth to adulthood at around age 40.  Sean Penn, Kevin Bacon and Tim Robbins were neighborhood youngsters engaging in the traditional youthful mischief of carving their names in fresh sidewalk cement.  A car stops when they are in the midst of their endeavors.  One of the two men jumps out of the car, falsely identifying himself as a policeman and, after berating them for defacing public property, harshly orders one of them into the car.  The car departs with the two friends watching helplessly.  <p>The years pass and they meet again under anything but auspicious circumstances.  Tim Robbins, the victim of child molestation by the two criminals who abducted him, has trouble adjusting, haunted by the event.  He drinks a lot to still his nerves as well as forget, but instead of forgetting the visions become more vivid,  He talks morbidly about wolves in the woods.  Sean Penn, after a stretch in prison, runs a small market, barely able to make ends meet.  Kevin Bacon is a Boston police detective.<p>When Penn's daughter turns up dead all the old scars from the past are reopened.  Robbins has been involved in a violent incident the same night that Penn's daughter was killed, leading Penn as well as others, including Robbins's wife, Marcia Gay Harden, to suspect him.  When he tells contradictory stories suspicions naturally multiply.  Penn has two local underworld thugs investigate possible Robbins involvement.<p>Kevin Bacon is a man caught in the middle, remembering his old friend Robbins from their respective youths, and his partner Laurence Fishburne is compelled to pressure him to take a long, hard look at Robbins as a suspect.  Eventually Fishburne hauls Robbins in for questioning with tormented Bacon assisting in the process.  <p>The Mystic River holds the key as bodies are dumped there.  These bodies reveal crimes and motivations that will unlock the ultimate mystery of the murder of Penn's daughter.  As Robbins's case is investigated further doubt emerges as to whether he or somebody else killed Penn's daughter.  Secrets from Penn's dark past are also uncovered.  <p>The picture ends in a deliberately ambiguous mode, letting viewers fill in a murky picture emerging from equally murky circumstances.  The ending dovetails with Lehane's hard-hitting novel.  This is Boston in its toughest blue collar mode.</p></br><a href="../users/A27CHILBK6HIL2.html">A27CHILBK6HIL2</a><br/><p>MOVIE: This was a favorite come the time of the Oscars and really showed some talented actors doing their thing. Personally I felt that this movie was a well made film but I think it got more praise than it deserved.  I'm really glad that it only won its Oscars for its acting because when it came down to the story it was just an above average crime drama.  What makes the movie above average is that it doesn't just deal with the "whodunnit" factor, it really incorporates the characters into the story. There is so much character development that it really shows the audience the true darkness of human nature.  Everybody was praising Clint Eastwood for this movie when all the credit should go to the actors and actresses in the picture.  Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, and Marcia Gay Harden (I still can't figure out how someone can get a name like that) all gave stellar performances. I really feel that it was overrated.  It is one of the greatest crime dramas out there its just that so is Se7en, and so is Life of David Gale.  A great movie that had so much support from the critics that it ended up being loved by everybody.<p>VIDEO: Very nice transfer from warner that really handles the dark scenes very well.<p>AUDIO: The 5.1 mix is a little soft in places but overall decent.<p>PACKAGING / EXTRAS: This review is pertaining to the 3 disc edition.  The Digipak comes in a slip sleeve and folds out into three segment. In the center you have the feature disc, and on the right you have the other two discs overlapping each other in a design that was done with the Pink Panther Film Collection. The left flap is just printed cardboard.  Disc 1 just has a commentary. Disc 2 has a platter of really "movie buff" extras.  First up is the standard making of, a 23 minute featurette called Mystic River- Beneath the Surface.  Next is an 11 minute segment titled Mystic River- From Page to Screen, mainly dealing with the actors.  Then there are The Charlie Rose Show Interviews. Eastwood's interview is 42 minutes, Robbins' is 50 minutes, and Bacon's is 19 minutes. These are not bull interviews but real good conversations about the movie. Disc 3 is the soundtrack to the film, which I was not a fan of. I really think Eastwood shouldn't have composed the soundtrack because I felt that it was too unemotional.  Maybe he wanted it that way so that all the emotion could come from the fine acting, but I just felt that it didn't support the tone of the movie as well as it could have. Overall it's a 2-disc version with the soundtrack attached. Definately worth buying versus the single disc edition. Plus you don't want another pesky WB snapper case would you?<p>MOVIE SCORE: (* * * *)<br />DVD SCORE: (9 / 10)</p></br><a href="../users/A2DSXA1E02C86D.html">A2DSXA1E02C86D</a><br/><p>MYSTIC RIVER may win Clint Eastwood an Oscar for Best Director, but I'd be surprised if the film wins Best Picture because it concludes with too many loose ends and thus fails as a conventional morality play. A rough justice of sorts was at least served in Clint's Oscar-winning UNFORGIVEN.<p>In the opening sequence, three boyhood pals - Jimmy, Dave and Sean - are playing on the streets of Boston. Jimmy goads the other two into defacing a freshly-poured square of concrete sidewalk. A car pulls up, apparently carrying two plain-clothes cops, one of whom berates the lads for their antisocial behavior. Ultimately, Dave is carried off by the police, ostensibly to be driven home and reported to his mother. In fact, the officers are child molesters in disguise, and Dave is cruelly abused in a cellar for four days before he escapes.<p>Decades later, the three still live in Boston. Jimmy (Sean Penn), now a tough-guy ex-con, runs a neighborhood convenience grocery. He's married with three daughters, the oldest being Katie (Emmy Rossum), the apple of his eye. Dave (Tim Robbins), a handyman, is married with one son. Sean (Kevin Bacon) is a homicide investigator with the Boston PD.<p>Late one night, Dave arrives home with a mangled hand and a superficial slash across his stomach. He claims he was attacked by a mugger, and in the ensuing struggle perhaps killed his assailant. The next morning, the police receive report of an abandoned car with a bloodied interior  and a bullet hole in the driver's seat back. The vehicle turns out to be Katie's, and her corpse is soon found in a nearby park. She's been brutally beaten and fatally shot after, apparently, being pursued by her killer. Sean is assigned as lead investigator.<p>Dave's wife Celeste (Marcia Gay Harden) scans the dailies expecting to find report of the dead mugger. Such never appears, and a corrosive doubt eats at her mind. Whom did Dave really kill?<p>The three principals in this gritty, take-no-prisoners piece (Penn, Robbins, and Bacon) give three noteworthy performances. Those of Penn and Robbins are particularly excellent, and surely merit Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor nominations respectively.<p>The core of MYSTIC RIVER is not the procedural identification of Katie's killer. Indeed, there are glaring logic lapses as both Jimmy and Sean seek the answer. Moreover, the involvement of the latter and the BPD serve only as the socially acceptable and expected counterpoint to a plot that has little to do with a legal resolution to the crime. Rather, it's an unrelentingly dark tale of deep emotional disturbances resulting from severe childhood trauma, and the potential for extra-legal, primal violence inherent in the philosophy &quot;a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do&quot;. I found the film's ending unsatisfying because of its loose ends. But that's not overly important, because the unsettling nature of Eastwood's message is embodied in the Getting There and not the Destination.  <p>You might think that MYSTIC RIVER is a Guy Flick. But that the female of the species also has a role to play in tribalism is indicated by the message given Jimmy by his wife Annabeth (Laura Linney) in the last minutes of the film. One tough babe, that.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6X0DAM87GN4.html">A3C6X0DAM87GN4</a><br/><p>As pointed out by so many others "Mystic River" is a powerful, emotional, well acted, well written film directed by Client Eastwood ("Unforgiven", "Play Misty For Me"). Without question this is one of the year's best films. And what about the performance by Sean Penn! Of all the movies I've seen this year Penn delivers the best performance I've seen as actor give this year. Unless something really amazing comes out in the next month Penn better win the Oscar. Tim Robbins is right on target as well. He delivers an Oscar caliber performance. Other note worthy aspects of the film include the cinematography, the editing, and the adapted screenplay by Brian Helgeland based on Dennis Lehane's novel.<p> "Mystic River" tells the story of three young boys growing up in Boston. One day a traumatic event occurs leaving a permant emotional scar on one of the boys. Fast foward 30 years later now yet another terrible event occurs. The death of one of their daughters, bringing the demons of the past up front again as they now deal with new demons. And who knows what's the come in the future. All of these characters seemed scarred for life. There is a bleak feeling one gets by the end of the movie.<p> The childhood friends grow up to become Sean Penn (Jimmy Markum), the one who loses his daughter. Tim Robbins (Dave Boyle) and Kevin Bacon (Sean Divine) who has become a cop and is assigned to the case. As I said before there is wonderful acting here. The three men turn in fine performances by almost everytime Penn was onscreen I had goosebumps. Now, I don't say that just to offer idle praise. I'm being sincere. Penn shows a very wide range of emotions in this movie.<p> One of the only faults I have with this movie is it seems to be the men's movie all the way. You have two very talented actresses in Marica Gay Harden and Laura Linney and they are not used properly. I admit more time is given to Harden but they seemed to have forgotten Linney. Now naturally I can't speak for everyone but I thought Linney was great in "You Can Count On Me". I find her to be an extremely talented person. But she has just about nothing in this movie. Her only really good scene where she has more than two lines is at the end of the picture! I just wish they could have given her a better role. Other than that I've no complants.<p> Also spot Eli Wallach, Eastwood's old buddy in "The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly" in a delightful cameo.<p> Bottom-line: An emotional powerhouse of a film. Great acting, good script and fine directing by Eastwood. Truly one of the year's best films.</p></br><a href="../users/AP3B615GM191G.html">AP3B615GM191G</a><br/><p>In hindsight, after being attached to incredible films such as "Million Dollar Baby" and "Gran Torino", the name "Clint Eastwood" has become synonymous with "master director".  In this case, however, it was clear that Eastwood was still honing his craft.<br /><br />For a basic plot summary, "Mystic River" tells the story of three childhood friends now grown up but still intertwined with each other:<br /><br />-Jimmy Markum (Sean Penn): The intense, mob-dealer type who's daughter is murdered and provides the investigative basis for the film.<br />-Dave Boyle (Tim Robbins): At the beginning of the film, as a child, young David is kidnapped and abused.  He's clearly never gotten over that experience.<br />-Sean Devine (Kevin Bacon): A cop on the Markum murder case.<br /><br />The good thing about this movie is that it contains enough interesting themes (both physical and emotional) to keep the viewer engaged.  You'll really be curious as the movie unfolds to see how all this will turn out.<br /><br />Here's the problem: In a rare moment of Eastwood being "off", most of those interesting themes either die off with no explanation, or lead to conclusions that are unsatisfying.  In, say, "Million Dollar Baby", Eastwood is perfect in resolving all the themes and character development.  In this effort, he fails at that task.<br /><br />That being said, this is still an okay movie.  If you don't compare it to Eastwood's better directorial efforts, then it may look even better.  Now, is it as good as the Academy thought it was in '03?  I beg to differ.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KB1H0S7T6JX1.html">A3KB1H0S7T6JX1</a><br/><p>Mystic River, brings to the screen the story of three old friends who reunite years after a traumatic experience made them drift apart.  The circumstances under which they meet again are not the best and their old friendship will soon be put to the test...<br /><br />To a certain extent Mystic River bring to mind Sleepers (also starring Kevin Bacon, but in a much different role).<br /><br />Sean Penn, Kevin Bacon, Tim Robbins, Laurence Fishburn, and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are extraordinary to say the least!  The actors give it their 100% and it really shows!<br /><br />The only setback is in relation to Tom Guiry who as Brendan Harris is not really convincing in his role as Katie's boyfriend (He does not seem to be "all man" if you catch my drift...).<br /><br />Aside from that, the plot and the setting, are both excellent!  In addition, it is one of those films that gets you and keeps you thinking long after it's over.<br /><br />Overall, Mystic River is a movie guaranteed to provide an evening's entertainment.</p></br><a href="../users/A3SFO2GSP5CVSM.html">A3SFO2GSP5CVSM</a><br/><p>It is a truism in the world of soap opera (the purest form of modern melodrama) that the characters must always do the dumbest possible thing to propel the story forward. While this is not egregious in melodrama, it is so in drama. Yet, a large portion of film today is pure melodrama. I think of highly lauded films like Michael Mann's Heat as melodrama incarnate.<br />  Another truism in regard to films is that actors turned directors tend to not be very good. Mel Gibson, Ron Howard, and Kevin Costner (Academy Award winners in direction) come to mind, as does Clint Eastwood (another Oscar winner). Perhaps the only actor-cum-director who has proven his chops artistically, though, is Woody Allen, although he was really a stand up comedian, not an actor. Actors tend to direct very ham-handedly, with static camera work, and no real sense of film's visual aspect, and even less skill at understanding what constitutes good story structure. Eastwood is very much in this vein. In his highly lauded Mystic River Eastwood shows that he has everything it takes to direct tv movies of the week, but not serious art. This film is larded with poorly framed scenes, bad lighting, very pedestrian angles, color-strained, as well as bad performances, a horridly unrealistic script, banal music, and too many red herrings.... There are some nice touches- like abused Dave's name drying half-finished in the cement, but they are too little in depth and too few. More often the script, by Brian Helgeland, merely allows wallowing for the actors, and denies them any real chance to show real emotion. Like the poor In The Bedroom, Mystic River had a chance to be an adult meditation on grief, rather than a plot reject from a 1970s cop tv show like Kojack or Starsky And Hutch.<br />  The basic problem is that most moviegoers simply do not understand nor appreciate good writing- everything is homogenized down into a lowest common denominator plot mulch. I've read other critics state that Eastwood is a jazzy director, in that he tends to just riff. Well, maybe so in other films but in this one he's at his Director's 101 worst. The film is dull and predictable, and the acting is forgettable- certainly not indelible. You know this when there is nothing unique about a performance and any other actor could have pulled off the part. So it is with the three main characters.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R9GZ8FC44MF5.html">A1R9GZ8FC44MF5</a><br/><p>This is a good movie the first time you see it, but after that there is no reason to watch it again.  Sean penn's performance although deserving of a nomination could have been better, i think johnny depp should have got it.  He shows emotion throughout, but in some scenes he lacks the right expressions to pull off the effect, the drama suffers becuase when he should be freaking out like in the scene when the cops are holding back(the best scene in the movie), he doesnt.  Tim robbins is good but also could have done better.  The story is average at best.  The ending is the biggest dissapointment and is very predictable, they should change it really.  The movie is an 8 out of a 10 the first time then goes down to a 3 the next.</p></br><a href="../users/A1E11HKN4IRY09.html">A1E11HKN4IRY09</a><br/><p>MYSTIC RIVER is a well made, depressing, and genuinely run-of-the-mill drama that yet again shows the wide range of crying, weeping, and sobbing SEAN PENN is always capable of.  Chock full of unsympathetic characters and predictable plot arcs, this flick is way overrated.  Which should suffice for fans of PENN, who is the most overrated actor in hollywood today.  He and the supporting cast do a decent job of bringing their characters to life, but the story doesn't give you a chance to really like any of them.  CLINT EASTWOOD's direction is assured if not inspired and the end of the picture drags on for quite some time.  Maybe I expected more from MYSTIC RIVER due to the high praise it recieved, but as a cinematic experience it's just plain there.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>I can understand why many people may feel that Mystic River is overrated, but I disgress.  Everything about the film, from the performances from the entire cast, to Clint Eastwood's super slick direction, is flawless.  Taking place in working class Boston and revolving around three childhood friends in Jimmy (Sean Penn), Dave (Tim Robbins), and Sean (Kevin Bacon); all three of whom are seperated after a tragedy involving Dave, and the murder of Jimmy's teenage daughter years later re-unites them as the clues point to Dave being the perpetraitor while Sean, now a cop, scrambles to stop former thug Jimmy from taking the law into his own hands.  The performances are nothing short of superb, with Penn and Robbins both earning their Oscars, and Marcia Gay Harden (as Dave's wife) earning her Oscar nod.  Eastwood's moody score and Oscar winning screenwriter Brian Helgeland keep the film twisting, the only problem being Helgeland's script doesn't go as in depth as Dennis Lehane's novel, but he did a more than commendable job nonetheless.  This overpriced Special 3-disc edition is scant on the extras, and while Eastwood's score is included, you'd think that he would have done a commentary at least.  That aside though, this is still a fabulous film, and more than worth seeing.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZLROGIL2V7GV.html">A2ZLROGIL2V7GV</a><br/><p>Clint Eastwood has directed a masterpiece which is most likely his best work ever.  Completely character driven and full of tension, drama and danger, &quot;Mystic River&quot; is a cinematic experience that shouldn't be passed up.  For those 130+ minutes, I was intrigued and amazed.  It's a film that doesn't rely on action or senseless non-stop violence, but it relies only on the characters.<p>Jimmy, Dave and Sean were best friends when they were kids, but something terrible happened.  Dave was abducted by two strangers posing as cops one day, only to be held captive and abused (physically, and by &quot;other&quot; means).  He did manage to escape, but the experience has forever scarred him.  Years later when all three are grown up, they are reunited when a horrible crime arises--Jimmy's nineteen-year-old daughter ends up murdered.  Sean's a cop who is on the case and Dave, still deeply disturbed by the past, is acting very strange and suspiciously.  The childhood past that these three had has paved the paths of their lives today, which has set in motion these chain-of-events.  It is a sad story that can only end in tragedy that will affect all three in unimaginable ways.<p>On the surface, this seems like a mystery/thriller when it is anything but that.  True, it is a murder mystery, but the murder is not what the movie is really about.  It's about how the past can never be forgotten and how these three individuals have turned out as a result.  You see the characters and how they deal with the tragedy that has befallen them.  The mind frame, the course of action, and the need of closure all play a very important role in this tension-filled drama.  It's one of those rare films where you could've watched it unfold forever.  Clint Eastwood has done a marvelous job of directing this masterpiece of human tragedy and loss.<p>It has to be said.  The cast is PHENOMENAL.  The cast could've really made this film a complete and utter failure if the wrong people were chosen, but that is not the case here.  Everybody was outstanding.  Sean Penn and Tim Robbins give it their all in making their roles come to life.  I now know why the two won Academy Awards, and they deserve them very much.  Kevin Bacon is terrific and comes off more than just a simple cop.  Laurence Fishburne was a complete joy to watch, as well.  I didn't even know that he was in this until I bought the DVD, and he was brilliant in a stand-out role.  What it all comes down to is that the complete cast is terrific.  Not one wasted talent can be found in this entire film.<p>There are two versions of this movie you can buy--not counting the widescreen/full screen versions.  You can either buy the &quot;bare bones&quot; version that has absolutely no special features whatsoever, or you can buy the &quot;Deluxe Edition,&quot; which is three discs.  I bought the &quot;Deluxe Edition.&quot;  While it is a pretty nice package, I wouldn't really call this edition of the movie &quot;Deluxe.&quot;  Special features included are two making-of featurettes, Charlie Rose interviews with Eastwood, Robbins and Bacon (all separate interviews), two trailers and audio commentary given by Robbins and Bacon.  The third disc is a CD that is the soundtrack to the movie with the score composed by Clint Eastwood.  Like I said, nice package, but nothing really &quot;Deluxe&quot; about it.  It's up to you whether you want to get a version that has no extras in sight or pay a little more for a couple of nice features.<p>&quot;Mystic River&quot; is an unforgettable, heart-breaking and overwhelming film that really can show you how fantastic a movie can be if you have the characters and the emotion.  Not everyone will enjoy it, as it isn't action-packed, but for those who love character development are in for a real treat.  If you haven't seen it yet, I really recommend checking it out.  It's definitely one of the better movies to come out of 2003.  It's a shame it had to come out the same year as &quot;Return of the King,&quot; otherwise I really think this film could've won a few more awards. -Michael Crane</p></br><a href="../users/ASJ89T42CIUHU.html">ASJ89T42CIUHU</a><br/><p>I found this film to be disturbing, haunting and quite confusing.<p>Clint Eastwood did a great job directing this film, allowing the actors to take on the character's personas with stunning ability. He also kept extremely close to life as it exists in the Boston suburbs, nothing fancy or colorful, just an average working class living. The actors were cast in nearly perfect roles for their vulnerabilities. Eastwood allowed the story to evolve without pushing but I wish he would have included more explanation and a more thorough ending.<p>Sean Penn is PERFECT in his role and I can see why he received an Oscar. He is open and raw with his feelings, in fact so much so that your heart is almost wrenched from your own chest as a few of his scenes are played out. Tim Robbins edged upon scary as his character dealt with the consequences of his childhood. Kevin Bacon seemed a little too reserved and I kept expecting him to open up and really act at some but sadly he never did. The wives are all a little too sappy for my taste and seemed to agree with whatever their crazy husbands decided to do so I was disapointed by their characters. <p>This film is good and mysterious but sort of leaves one hanging at the end with many strings seemingly unconnected that should have been. Sean Penn's performance is well worth the watch however. At least I was eventually able to figure out where the title &quot;Mystic River&quot; came from, but as for the rest of my questions I will search for them in the novel.</p></br><a href="../users/A36EW68H08UOCS.html">A36EW68H08UOCS</a><br/><p>It didn't surprise me that Clint Eastwood directed "Unforgiven", good as it was, because he is obviously well steeped in the legend and lore of the Western.  He has done a fine job with several other films as well, but in Mystic River Clint signals a full maturity in his gift as a director.<p>He began with a stellar cast, and I won't waste anyone's time being the ten millionth person to praise Sean Penn's stunning performance.  A cast that breathes life into this sorrowful tale surrounds him.  Tim Robbins returns on-screen in a role that is perhaps the most difficult and complex one of the movie, and he seems believable every moment.  Kevin Bacon and Laurence Fishburne make good cop-partners.  The wives of Sean Penn and Tim Robbins are played by Laura Linney and Marcia Gay Harden, and they are both heart-breakingly good.  <p>None of us are perfect, and this is a theme that runs through this story of abuse, suffering and death.  We are perhaps least perfect when we let our passions rule us and we go off half-cocked when things would probably turn out better if we had our emotions and facts straight.  Many things are not quite as they seem.  <p>There are many virtuoso sequences in the film as two simultaneous events are juxtaposed upon each other.  Note snippets of visual information we are given in the early sequence that alternates between the first communion of one of Sean Penn's daughters, and the crime scene investigation where the police will eventually discover that the eldest daughter has been murdered.  Note also later on the climactic confrontation between Sean Penn and Tim Robbins on the banks of the Mystic River while at the same time Bacon and Fishburne confront the former boyfriend of the dead daughter.<p>This film leaves you with a little pit in your stomach.  But it does that with consummate skill, and I admire it for that.  I watched the movie first in the theater, then last night on DVD.  I pose this question to viewers:  After the events of the end of the movie, what do you think is the response of the Laurence Fishburne character?</p></br><a href="../users/A1EMDSTJDUE6B0.html">A1EMDSTJDUE6B0</a><br/><p>This is a very good movie with realistic turns of events that make the viewers believe it could happen to them. Good acting and good delivery.

Eastwood brings out the drama through thorough character development by creating a connected history for the characters that continues throughout the film.  The cinematography is well balanced with terrific performances by the cast (including Tim Robbins, Sean Penn, Kevin Bacon, Laurence Fishburne and many others), which displays a realistic atmosphere.  This atmosphere creates a clash between the screen and the viewer as the story depicts some disturbing elements.  The disturbing elements provide a suspenseful tension that does not let go even after the end credits.<p>The story begins with one of the three main characters being kidnapped and molested as a child by two strangers.  This traumatic experience plays an essential role in the story as it connects the main characters and attributes to their personalities.  This attribution of personal characteristics pulls the audience into an unwanted, yet unavoidable direction.  Consequently, Mystic River offers an exceptionally good cinematic experience that will leave the audience pondering for a long time.</p></br><a href="../users/A152C8GYY25HAH.html">A152C8GYY25HAH</a><br/><p>"Mystic River" is a rich, densely-layered movie. Part drama, part psychological thriller, it is one of the finest films of 2003. It is also an actor's dream. Containing at least a half dozen excellent roles, it provided Sean Penn a Best Actor Oscar, as well as one for Tim Robbins as Best Supporting Actor.  <p>`Riveting' is a good word to describe the story. At the start, three boyhood friends are playing games on the sidewalks of a working-class Boston neighborhood. Two men, allegedly cops, abduct one of the boys. He is found a few days later in a cellar. He has been sexually molested and, naturally, is traumatized. The movie implies that no one knows how to deal with what has happened to the boy. It's a working-class, Catholic neighborhood. Life just goes on.<p>Flash forward about thirty years later to the present. Each boy's life has taken a different path. Jimmy [Sean Penn] has become the operator of a successful neighborhood grocery store - but only after a stretch in prison for armed robbery. He still hangs out with the local thugs. Sean [Kevin Bacon] has become a detective with the Boston police department. His professional life is fine but his personal life is a shambles. Dave [Tim Robbins], the one who was kidnapped, lives life as best he can. When Jimmy's teenage daughter is brutally murdered, the three boyhood friends reunite on a chaotic collision course which leads to tragedy. <p>This is not a movie for people with short attention spans. Those who do not pay attention may be befuddled by the end of it. <p>"Mystic River" is possibly Clint Eastwood's crowning achievement in a long and very interesting career. It's the kind of movie that would be hard for any filmmaker to top.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VIOCJZ22JZXT.html">A3VIOCJZ22JZXT</a><br/><p>There are several outstanding features of Mystic River; the superb acting by the three male lead actors, the twisted unfolding plot, and the underlying theme of revenge and justice. I will discuss all three below.<br /><br />You can not beat Sean Penn's acting in this film. He portrays a rough man of the streets, trying to hold a family together and run a business, in a working class blue-collar neighborhood. He is fully alive in this role, as protective father seeking the murderer of his elder daughter while simultaneously dealing with his intense grief. His wife, Laura Lenney, describes him best in the final minutes of the film, when she emotionally absolves him of the murder of a childhood friend he mistakenly believes killed his daughter. She evokes the Jungian archtype of the king as she tells him he is a king who protects his family and home and that he acted on the best evidence he had, even if that evidence is flawed.<br /><br />Tim Robbins was amazing as the odd adult male who is still damaged by the childhood rapes he endures for 4 days at the hands of two male pediophiles. He now sees himself as a child continually trying to escape from the werewolves, which are the memories of the molestation he experienced. His oddity however marks him as a suspect for the murder of a 19 year old girl.<br /><br />Kevin Bacon plays the tight competent policman, trying to control his emotions under all circumstances when we see evidence that this strategy drove his wife from him.<br /><br />The story-line unfolds gradually, tragedy after tragedy, misunderstanding after misunderstanding, like a house of cards falling apart in slow motion. The interaction of the three main actors form the structure around which all the tragedy flows. Clint Eastwood paced this film very well, never rushing and never boring the audience.<br /><br />Underlying the plot however is the themes of justice, revenge, and our connectedness in a web of relationships. The film asks whether justice can ever be obtained and is it right to take justice into our own hands. In this case we see two men try to take justice into their own hands, Sean Penn and Tim Robbins, and the tragedy that unfolds because of that.<br /><br />However the film also displays our interconnectedness in that the dynamics of the tragedy are in the past and the tragedy continues into the future. As you watch, notice how much the murder of Just Ray by Sean Penn sets up the dynamic whereby Sean refuses to have his daughter date the son of Just Ray - a dynamic that begins the current tragedy of his daughter's death. So it is not just the molestation of Tim Robbin's character that sets the stage, it is also Sean Penn's murder of an old friend who betrays him that sets in play the death of his own daughter. On the day of her funeral, Sean Penn sits on his backporch, and addressing the trees and spirit of his daughter he says "I know that somehow I am responsible for your death, but I don't know how."  The film reveals to him and to us  how he was responsible.<br /><br />The film does not end on happy note, for Sean Penn kills again and this time it is a damaged man, also a secret killer. In the final scenes a softball parade goes through town, the characters lock eyes, knowing that an impure justice has occurred with which they all must live and the young son of the deceased Tim Robbins, sitting on a float in his softball uniform, implies that it will cycle through again, unresolved, because justice and revenge are structures of human interaction and relationship, not absolutes.</p></br><a href="../users/A20ZFWGBY4REFX.html">A20ZFWGBY4REFX</a><br/><p>Directed by double Academy Award winner Clint Eastwood (Best Director and Best Picture, "Unforgiven" (1992)) from a screenplay by Brian Helgeland ("L.A. Confidential"), based on a bestseller by ace mystery writer Dennis Lehane, and starring such respected, actorly heavyweights as Sean Penn ("I Am Sam"), Tim Robbins ("Mission to Mars"), Kevin Bacon ("Flatliners"), Laurence Fishburne (The "Matrix" films), Marcia Gay Harden ("Meet Joe Black"), and Laura Linney ("The Mothman Prophecies"), "Mystic River" has as unimpeachable a pedigree as any American studio film in history. And though it may not quite be the masterpiece that the early buzz suggests, it certainly makes the most of the tremendous talents at its disposal. A mournful meditation on revenge and guilt, "Mystic River" is perhaps Eastwood's most mature and moving examination yet of what has always been his great subject: the peculiarly American juxtaposition of vigilante violence and official justice.<p>The film flows from two linked moments of violence, which, in turn, beget other violence -- one moment that pulls three childhood friends apart and another, 30 years later, that brings them back together. "Mystic River" opens in the '70s (the period established by a transistor radio broadcasting a Red Sox game with Luis Tirant on the mound), in a working-class neighborhood, as three boys play street hockey. There's Dave, who seems a little slow, Jimmy, a reckless kid who wants to steal a neighborhood car for joyriding, and Sean, a cautious kid who frowns on Jimmy's plan. Finding a slab of sidewalk where the concrete is still wet, the boys begin writing their names only to be confronted by two older men posing as cops, who take Dave away in the back of their car, where he is kept for several days and sexually abused before escaping. Flashing forward to the same neighborhood decades later, Dave (Robbins) is an introverted husband and father who doesn't seem to have quite recovered from his childhood ordeal. Jimmy (Penn) is an ex-con who runs a corner grocery store in the neighborhood but is still crime-connected. And Sean (Bacon) is now a Boston homicide detective, an outsider in the old neighborhood, working his beat with an astute African-American partner named Whitey (Fishburne). Jimmy and Dave are still friends -- Jimmy's ice-queen wife Annabeth (Linney) is a cousin of Dave's warm but (understandibly) skittish wife Celeste (Harden) -- but all three friends are brought together when Jimmy's 19 year-old daughter Katie (Emmy Rossum) turns up missing, and later dead, on the same night that Dave returns home late covered in someone else's blood. A distraught Jimmy, not waiting for the legal system to work, has a couple of his neighborhood goons out looking for the killer, while Sean is assigned to work the case. (The parallel police and underworld investigations might be a nod to Fritz Lang's serial-killer masterpiece 'M', which would only be a beginning to the debt "Mystic River" owes to Lang's artful police procedurals.) As Sean and Whitey investigate the case, dual clues point strongly to two suspects: Dave, one of the last people to see Katie alive, and a neighborhood boy whom she had been dating.<p>By acclimation, "Mystic River" is Clint Eastwood's finest film since 1992's Oscar-winner "Unforgiven", and you'll find no argument here. A handsome, old-fashioned film, it's so stately, so measured, and so elegant that it acts as a formal rebuke to most other contemporary studio takes on this kind of material. "Mystic River" is a mystery spiked with deep emotion and considerable gravitas. It has a tremendous feel for its location, for this almost tribal old-school neighborhood on the brink of gentrification. It's marked by a tight vocabulary of formal elements -- sure crosscutting and sweeping pans over the film's title waterway. Most of all, it seems intentionally driven by a vast series of doubles and rhymes: two wives, two mute witnesses, two murders, two investigations, two friends whose lives go in opposite directions, two heartbreaking shots -- 30 years apart -- of Dave in the backseat of a car being taken away. And this matches the film's series of actorly one-on-one confrontations: Dave and Celeste, Dave and Jimmy, Celeste and Jimmy, Jimmy and Sean, Jimmy and Annabeth. But Eastwood's precise, conservative direction makes room for occasional visual flourishes, such as the operatic matching aerial shots that show Katie's bloodied, beaten body, found in a park, and nearby Jimmy howling as he's held back by a phalanx of cops.<p>As one might expect, "Mystic River" is as much an actor's film as it is a director's. Its performances are uniformly excellent, with Sean Penn's and Tim Robbins' showy turns perhaps bested by Marcia Gay Harden, whose doting but doubtful wife is perhaps the film's most tragic figure. "Mystic River" isn't perfect. Laura Linney's underwritten part makes Annabeth's sinister, ruthless late transformation seem awkward and abrupt, and sometimes Eastwood reaches a little too much for effect (or for the Oscar) when the generally understated music swells more than necessary. But these are just quibbles.<p>"I'm gonna find him. I'm gonna find him before the police do and I'm gonna kill him," Jimmy says as he stands over Katie's lifeless body. His insistence on keeping that promise is the source of Eastwood's most effective critique yet of American vigilante justice. "Mystic River" ends with a patriotic neighborhood parade, all the film's major characters in the crowd. It looks welcoming and friendly, but for one character it's a moment of horror and loss that brings "Mystic River" full circle. In conclusion, a powerful cast and superb direction by Clint Eastwood makes this story of violence and justice an unforgettable one. A DVD must-own when released!</p></br><a href="../users/A38U2M9OAEJAXJ.html">A38U2M9OAEJAXJ</a><br/><p>&quot;Mystic River&quot; is an across-the-board triumph of filmmaking by the talented Clint Eastwood, who not only directed and co-produced this movie, but also composed the film's dark and brooding score.  Set in working class Boston, it tells the story of two childhood friends (Sean Penn and Kevin Bacon) who are emotionally scarred after witnessing the abduction of another friend, Dave (Tim Robbins).  As adults, Jimmy (Penn) is an ex-con trying to make a decent living with his wife Annabeth (Laura Linney), while Sean (Bacon) is a homicide detective.  But when Jimmy's daughter is suddenly killed, a murder mystery soon unfolds and Sean is soon called upon to investigate the case.  While much has been made of &quot;Mystic River&quot;'s cinematography, the film's power lies in the performances, all of which are stunningly good.  Expect yet another Oscar nomination for Sean Penn, who vividly brings to life the agony of a mourning parent desperate to seek revenge for the murder of his child.  The solid Marcia Gay Harden also deserves props for her role as Dave's wife Celeste.  But the real star of the show is definitely the 73-year-old Eastwood, who no doubt made his best film in years.  You can run to the multiplex to catch a big budget movie that's louder and flashier. But in terms of dramatic tension, believable performances, and a witty script, &quot;Mystic River&quot; is so far the movie to beat in 2003.</p></br><a href="../users/A37B3O457INKEA.html">A37B3O457INKEA</a><br/><p>MYSTIC RIVER is an excellent movie which deserved the ton of praise it received at the time it was released in 2003. The plot centers around the tragedy that unfolds as one of three boyhood friends is abducted by two pedophiles while playing on the street in a tough working class neighborhood in Boston. By the time the three former pals reach adulthood they are no longer friends, but the murder of a daughter of one of the men brings them back in contact with each other. This is definitely not a feel-good film but it is certainly unforgettable.<br /><br />The leading roles are played by Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, Kevin Bacon and Marcia Gay Harden. The director is Clint Eastwood and the movie is based on a novel by Dennis Lehane.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UYAFQ40U2PHS.html">A2UYAFQ40U2PHS</a><br/><p>This is a great film, but it is very depressing and probably the bleakest film of Eastwood's career.  Many have said that Clint's film, Million Dollar Baby, was depressing.  That film was sad, but there was a sort of transendence at the end of it.  This film has nothing like that.  The 3 boyhood friends, played by Penn, Robbins, and Bacon, have all gone their seperate ways in life when they are reunited when Penn's daughter is murdered.  After an inital meeting where they all share their grief, the tensions between the friends increase as the mystery unfolds.  Robbins is especially good (and deserving of his Academy award) as the man who was molested as a young man, and who is permanently scarred because of it.  While at first you feel sympathy for Penn's character, you realise slowly that Penn is really a cruel, brutal man.  Bacon is very good as the detective, the only character of the three who really seems to be balanced, even though his wife has left recently, and he is a typically cynical detective.  The film ends brilliantly on an ambiguous, dark note, with Kevin Bacon giving Penn a "I know what kind of person you really are" at the end of the film.  This is a disturbing, brooding film, one of Eastwood's darkest (even darker than Unforgiven), but it's definitely worth all the accolades that it has received.  It has the marks of a great tragedy, because like all tragedies, things never worked out for the best, they seemed to have worked out for the worst, but we're really not sure.  Great film....</p></br><a href="../users/A32XW50ILWOXNO.html">A32XW50ILWOXNO</a><br/><p>Infused with near-biblical power, Clint Eastwood's "Mystic River" is a straight hard drink of masculine theory, a journey into the world's dark, vengeful crevices, where the strong eat the weak, yet are not spared by God, and pay dearly for the feast. Beginning in the streets of Boston during the 1978 baseball pennant race and ending 25 years later on the banks of the title river, Eastwood transforms Dennis Lehane's novel into a portrait on the permanence of tragedy and untidy justice. <p>The seams of the plot burst wide open in the film's final 20 minutes, but by then the hooks are in us as much as they are three dye-in-the-wool Irishmen - Jimmy (Sean Penn), Sean (Kevin Bacon) and Dave (Tim Robbins) - caught in a storm of fate that starts to churn when they're 12 years old, as Dave is molested by men pretending to be cops. Dave escapes them after four days, but he's marked - the adult Dave likens it to the undead state of a vampire - and by that adulthood he's lost touch with Jimmy, a shrewd, anguished ex-con running a corner grocery market, and Sean, a square-jawed homicide detective. <p>But their lives intersect again when Jimmy's oldest daughter, Katie (Emmy Rossum), is murdered in a nearby park. Dave - who returned home to his wife Celeste (Marcia Gay Harden) awash in blood and a gash across his belly - is a likely suspect, as is Katie's secret boyfriend (Tom Guiry), who had planned to elope with her to Las Vegas and has more ties to Jimmy than it first seems. Sean and his sharp, no-nonsense partner Whitey (Laurence Fishburne, nicely low key) lead the murder investigation. Jimmy, meanwhile, has his own team of interrogating thugs. <p>Eastwood, always for substance over plot, wisely pushes the emotional intangibles of Lehane's novel, bearing his camera down on these haunted men and their frailties, while offering Penn free reign to chew whatever scenery he sees fit: His Jimmy is a smart, passionate man, capable of deep love and deep hate, and always mindful of a criminal side he can tap in a flash. <p>Penn has always been a mannered, showy actor, and this performance might be filled with more dramatic blarney than any of his celebrated roles, but he is magnetic in scene after scene; when one character suggests Jimmy could rule the town, we believe it. Penn is a lock for every award nomination they've got to give.<p>The rest of the cast is informed by Penn's work, and equally good. Robbins is perfectly cast as a sad-eyed, shut down giant stalked by his own shadow.  Dave isn't stupid - watch how swiftly he turns the tables on Sean and Whitey during one interrogation - but broken, and hardly comforted by his timid wife, played by Harden as a bundle of nerves barely holding herself together. Bacon essentially inhabits the Joe Friday role, though his character is wrapped up in a bizarre subplot with a long-estranged wife who calls him up only to say nothing. Guiry is fine as the boyfriend, and Laura Linney, in a small role as Jimmy's wife, Annabeth, is given a rather cruel, unlikely speech in the movie's final moments that nonetheless hammers home the have/have-not theme on which the movie thrives. <p>As a director, Eastwood is notoriously quick and economical; as a result, some of his more recent films - "Absolute Power," "True Crime" and "Blood Work" - have been thin and visually flat. But the 73-year-old is up to this material, and much like his masterpiece "Unforgiven," Eastwood has the strong script (from "LA Confidential" writer Brian Helgeland) and actors to tackle a fast shoot.  "Mystic River" is stark and naturally lit. The few flourishes it takes - a God's eye view of the murder scene, a screen of pure white during the movie's climax, helicopter tours of the dark, velvet river - are masterful touches.  <p>"Mystic River" is such a tense, moving experience for much of its running time that the ending, which includes a left-field suspect and a turn of events that fly in the face with judicial reality, is a bit of disorienting letdown. Linney's speech, and that final, cocky shot of Penn, is likely to draw a few looks of disbelief. But the movie has so enforced the idea of lifelong spiritual debt that, while "Mystic River" ends, there is a distinct sense that the characters have not finished their penance. As one character says: "God says you owed another marker. He came to collect."</p></br><a href="../users/A3ENN25NFADE1X.html">A3ENN25NFADE1X</a><br/><p>"Unforgiven" was Eastwood's finest work. It had incredible dialogue that explains their legends. "Unforgiven" had demensions in their character and had an incredible story. There is really nothing original about "Mystic River", or even an original twist.<br /><br />THE PLOT<br /><br />Jimmy,Dave,Sean. Friends who grew up in a working - class Boston. They drift apart after a terrible tragedy. Years later, brutal events reconnect them.<br /><br />This is a great film, I wish I could of given it five stars, but it's not original, but this film has great acting.  Tim Robbin and Sean Penn deserved their Oscar's.</p></br><a href="../users/AW4MT9WP95TVD.html">AW4MT9WP95TVD</a><br/><p>Beautiful performances from the cast make this one the worthwhile film that is. I enjoyed watching really good actors flex their muscles with strong tragic material, I guessed at the mystery and stayed glued to it until the end.  BUT, I never felt really involved.  A big part of me felt removed from the story so the dramatic and emotional impact was severely lessened.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IOJE0W1NXOSE.html">A1IOJE0W1NXOSE</a><br/><p>Three young boys play together on a Boston street.  As they are writing their names in some fresh cement, a man approaches them angrily, claiming to be a policeman.  He takes one of the boys away in this car and proceeds to sexually abuse him while his friends stand by helplessly.  Tim Robbins plays the grown-up version of the boy who has been abused, and Kevin Bacon becomes a police officer who is investigating the death of the 19-year-old daughter of the third friend, played by Sean Penn.  Each of these three actors is brilliant in his part and they are well-supported by Marcia Gay Harden, Laurence Fishburne, and Laura Linney.  This is a classic tragedy, as high emotions, lack of communication, and exaggerated innuendoes lead to a sad conclusion.  The evil done to these boys continues to poison their lives into adulthood.  This is well-written, well-acted, and well-directed and it deserves all of the accolades it has received.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>This was one of my favorite films of 2003. Sean Penn and Tim Robbins both deserved the Oscars they took home. My advice to anyone reading this review is save 10-15 dollars and buy the version with just the film on it. The Special Edition contains nothing more than some of the most boring interviews, which go on for over an hour or two, and a dull commentary track. No insight on the making of the film or the casting. The Soundtrack is decent but not worth the extra bucks. Please take my advice and buy the &quot;bare bones&quot; version of this outstanding film and nothing more.</p></br><a href="../users/A20DZX38KRBIT8.html">A20DZX38KRBIT8</a><br/><p>This movie was going good for me then the ending was so dumb that it ended up ruining the whole thing.....anyhow started good then went to crap.</p></br><a href="../users/ABN5K7K1TM1QA.html">ABN5K7K1TM1QA</a><br/><p>Clint Eastwood does a great job of getting the best out of some very fine actors in this urban working class instant classic.  Sean Penn, reminding me of some of the best work by such stars as Al Pacino and Robert De Niro, is absolutely authentic as Jimmy Markum from the mean streets of Boston, a guy who brushed with the law, went straight, and then, when his beloved daughter comes up murdered, is tested and found...<br /><br />All too human.<br /><br />He is supported by Tim Robbins as his boyhood chum Dave Boyle, a man tottering on the edge of sanity, a man haunted by a childhood abduction by pedophiles, one of whom flashes a priest's ring.  Penn won an academy award in 2004 as Best Actor, and Robbins won as Best Supporting Actor.  Best film that year went to Lord of the Rings, but Mystic River couldn't have been far behind in the voting.<br /><br />Kevin Bacon, the third of the boyhood pals who have gone their separate ways in adulthood, plays Sean Devine, a homicide detective with the Boston police.  He also does a great job.  His sidekick is played by Laurence Fishburne who brings the very familiar black police detective role to a new level of excellence with his balanced and realistic portrayal.  Also excellent is Marcia Gay Harden as Celeste Boyle, Dave's wife, who through stupidity, fear, and a misreading of human grief, makes a fatal mistake in judgment, a mistake that leads to a needless murder.<br /><br />The story itself is riveting.  Eastwood's direction is tight, focused, always believable, and atmospheric.  The script by Brian Helgeland, adapted from the novel by Dennis Lehane, is nothing short of mesmerizing.  This movie is that good.  It reminds me a little of some great mafia classics like The Godfather in the way it depicts east coast urban America: the family ties and betrayals, fateful acts born of anger and frustration, stupidity and human frailty, and most notably in the high quality of all aspects of the production, especially the most important ones, story, character and veracious setting and atmosphere.<br /><br />A couple of other things set this film apart.  One is the interesting and deep psychological situations that some of the characters find themselves in.  Detective Sean Devine has an estranged wife who calls him but doesn't speak; Jimmy has dark secrets in his past known only to himself; Dave Boyle does something that nobody knows about until the end, something totally in keeping with his character; and finally, the boyfriend of Jimmy's daughter, Brendan Harris (Tom Guiry) knows something that solves the murder in his mind, but he doesn't want to tell it just yet.<br /><br />The second is, even as Brendan runs home to confirm what he knows, you'll never guess who murdered Jimmy's daughter.  Only in the next scene as the film nears its climax, is it clear what happened and why.  And the difficulty isn't anything artificial as is so often the case in movie thrillers.  The difficulty results from a beautifully constructed story based on a realistic and believable plot that makes us feel when the truth finally comes out, that it is right and understandable although almost impossible to guess beforehand.<br /><br />See this for Clint Eastwood who, with this film, can take his place alongside Hollywood's great directors, and for Sean Penn who gives the performance of his life.</p></br><a href="../users/A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z.html">A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z</a><br/><p>An over-publicized production that wallows in a predictably boring plot conveying absolutely no theme. I disagree with the critics who claim that this is more than a simple 'who dunnit' film. The plot and character development being so shallow and disjointed, it's hard to find any of the deep meaning the critics are raving about.<br /><br />  The acting of Sean Penn, Kevin Bacon,and Tim Robbins is overblown for such a mediocre screenplay. The mystery of who killed Sean Penn's daughter is rather predictable making the characters' attempts at solving it seem amateurish if not idiotic. The story also focuses too much on issues that arose between the characters in the past that have absolutely no manifestation or relevance with their present dilemmas: they might as well have been complete strangers and the story would have had the same impact: none. Although critics praise the film as a complex exploration into the human psyche one never really gets that impression from the film. The characters and plot are too poorly developed to comprise a meaningful character study. What does Tim Robbins' past as a victim of pedophilia have to do with anything in this story? Absolutely nothing. Although it functions as a plot technique for suspense, it could have been just about any other traumatic experience to make the character seem odd, evasive, and suspect. The film focuses too much on this and makes it appear an important element when it really has very little relevance. In sum, the film's plot and theme are poorly woven: they have little to no logical relationship to each other and comprise little else than big a non-sequitur in logical reasoning.<br /><br />  This film is but a shallow, if not dry, river bed of a story with no character or thematic depth whatsoever. This by far has to be the most over-rated film of 2003. It deserved no Oscars.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TZKXU6Q0EDNP.html">A2TZKXU6Q0EDNP</a><br/><p>This is a classic case of a movie being seriously overhyped by both critics and movie-goers only to prove the classic axiom "don't believe the hype" once again true.<br />  That said hype though is not all non-deserved.<br />"Mystic river" has things going for it that should've made it a great film were it not for a small lil thingie missing: a competent script.<p>  But let's start with the good news first. The cast in this movie is superb as are the performances. Kevin Bacon is not only "as usually good" but gives one of his finest performances. Tim Robbins shows once more his tremendous talent in depicting difficult characters. Lawrence Fishburne, more of the same even though he's not given too much to work with. Sean Penn, well, I happen to like his acting quite a lot, but i think he's the only one that seems to be going through the motions. But the rest of the cast too, the so-called "second characters" are all major quality-acting contributors.<p>  So doesn't "Mystic river" go on then to be a great film? Uhm, no it doesn't.<br />  From the very beginning you have the obvious impression that this is going to be a "whodunnit" flick with some very in-depth social commentary. But that's exactly the problem. As the film progresses you realise it has no depth at all, in fact the more it goes on the shallower it gets and that, mind you, is for a full 2.5 hours which is assumingly the reason the director or the scriptwriter gave themselves that much time: to develop the characters and the plot.<p>  But no. The characters, with zero exception, are all painfully underdeveloped, glass figures acting superbly yes but acting a plot that's not really there (more kudos then for the acting). The story suffers on a multi-level basis. First of all there are serious plotholes and secondly since depth is never achieved the movie also drags and becomes predictable at the same time because you know way too early on that the "killer" the director is trying to trick you into focusing on is indeed innocent and that someone else has done it. <p>By that time though, you dont really care who it is. You cant identify with any of the characters (only exception here being that of Tim Robbins but that's like shooting the proverbial fish in the barel because of the character he plays, someone who was molested as a child).<p>  The plotholes, could've been "overlooked" had the depth and the development of the characters of "Mystic river" been achieved. But instead, the scriptwriter makes a pointlessly convoluted plot that feels deep but when you ask all the questions during and after the film they all come up unanswered: "who are really these people" and "do i care?".<p>  Finding its setting in a typical "working-class" neighborhood where the murder of the daughter of one of the main characters spawns not only the investigation of the police but that of the community as well, and where archetypical concepts kick in such as the urge for revenge, Mystic river should easily have been the vehicle for a an intricate critique on human nature and the dynamics (positive and negative) of human relationships through tragedies. But no again. Whether you'd read about such a story in the papers with the lightweight analysis usually accompanying them or saw this film is one and the same: superficiality is the main dish.<p>  All in all a pity considering how many aces the director (Clint Eastwood) holds up his sleeve but i think that Clint -when behind the camera- has shown that he's mostly willing to give life as lived by humans a very simplistic and rarely convincing look.<p>  And it's this simplistic, borderline-superficial approach that ultimately ruins the whole thing.<br />  Two stars for the great cast and the even greater acting. An extra minus star for the generic and terribly boring soundtrack written by the director himself...</p></br><a href="../users/AIFNOZKR9WTYI.html">AIFNOZKR9WTYI</a><br/><p>Now, in Smellarama!  Sean Penn IS the owner of a convenience store.  Tim Robbins IS a kinda flakey blue collar gentle giant type guy who got sexually worked over as a kid.  Susan Sarandon IS... oh, wait, somehow they didn't squeeze Baghdad Sue inno the flick.  Though I believe I did see Fidel Castro in a supporting role.  I believe he will soon win an Oscar simply for BEING Fidel Castro.  And Ed Asner has a brief role as the airplane mechanic.<br />But seriously folks, is it really plausible for any of these spoiled rotten Hollywood actors to ever play real people anymore?  While the rest of us slave away actually BEING real people, these hams sit around saying things like, "Well, yes Jay, in order to prepare for the demanding role as a convenience store clerk, I actually worked as a clerk in a 7-11 for three months, I did (total BS)"  "Oh, really, Sean?  What was that like?"  "Oh, it was really grounding, you know, I mean to like, BE there behind the counter selling people stuff and making sure teenagers didn't vandalize the video games it was... (begins to cry unconvincingly) It was a deep experience... please.... just give me a minute..."<br />See, as someone who has actually got his back to the wall with the pressures of ordinary life pressing in relentlessly, I resent the implication that these actors can by now remember the slightest thing about what it is like to live an ordinary, unglamorous, difficult life.  I read an article not so long ago about a little baby who was violently shaken by his father and will probably be brain damaged for the rest of his life.  Where's this kid's Oscar?

It's a movie emotionally charged with situations that can be very dramatic, so the only way that this movie could have been well made, was counting with a good director and excellent performances.<br /><br /> Thankfully &quot;Mystic River&quot; has an impressive cast that successfully contributed to create this complex movie. In the wrong hands, this movie could have been merely a good film. Clint Eastwood managed to get an excellent performance from everybody in this movie. From the big stars to the supporting cast, every actor in &quot;Mystic River&quot; did a terrific job.<br /><br /> Without a doubt Sean Penn's performance in &quot;Mystic River&quot; is outstanding and he deserved every award that he got for his role of Jimmy Markum, a multi-dimensional character. Tim Robbins is excellent in his portrayal of a very dark character, a man tormented by his personal demons, and his complex performance also granted him some nominations and awards. Kevin Bacon, Marcia Gay Harden, Laura Linney, Tom Guiry, Adam Nelson and Robert Wahlberg created very human and believable characters, their performances help to get the audiences involved in the plot, making &quot;Mystic River&quot; a very interesting story from beginning to end.<br /><br /> &quot;Mystic River&quot; is a very good movie, one of the finest of the 2003 class, and thanks to its great artistic quality, it's a very recommendable film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HJB9J5O5CLPB.html">A2HJB9J5O5CLPB</a><br/><p>You know a film succeeds when you don't want to get up and go to the head.  Yes, there's a murder mystery and a psychological study of three men, boyhood friends in a lower-middle-class white neighborhood.  Sean Penn plays an ex-con turned businessman.  Penn wins the Academy Award for his role as this disturbed man with a motive to kill.  I don't think this part's a stretch for Penn.  Murderous jailbirds are his specialty.  Tim Robbins plays a disturbed man under soft skin, and he wins an Oscar.  Robbins always plays that soft-spoken whacko.  There's another stretch.  Kevin Bacon returns to his old neighborhood.  He's the homicide detective a little too wrapped up in neighborhood history.  I must admit, I had no idea who the real killer was till the last scene, but in truth, this plot MacGuffin's too much.  Hitchcock always left discernable clues.  In Mystic River, all the clues misdirect.  When the film was over, I was left with some disappointment.  The mystery was too clever, still, a good one, tense.</p></br><a href="../users/A2X6GEC6LCDN4S.html">A2X6GEC6LCDN4S</a><br/><p>Timothy Robbins and Sean Penn earn their Oscars in this one. Both play shady type people who are tarnished by the rough environment they grew up in...on the wrong side of the tracks in Boston.  I found myself feeling very sorry for the characters and the deep holes they are digging for themselves in their lives.  The films underlying message, I think, is that no human life is unimportant, no matter how messed up that life happens to be.  Another message, sometimes things go terribly wrong and there is little anyone can do to change what fate has in store.  A scary movie, but well dome by Clint Eastwood!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A5TZXWU8AALIC.html">A5TZXWU8AALIC</a><br/><p>Clint Eastwood has made another powerful film that, like his brutal Western UNFORGIVEN, plunges into the murky depths of justice and evil.<p>In UNFORGIVEN, the story's impetus is a brutalized prostitute.  In MYSTIC, it's a molested child.  Gene Hackman's Oscar-winning lawman now becomes Sean Penn's Oscar-winning backroom gangster and the moment of evil revealing itself--Clint's final snarling threats as he rides out of UNFORGIVEN and Laura Linney's whispered justifications in MYSTIC--are unsettling and disorienting.<br />Exactly as Clint meant them to be.<p>Am I saying they're the same movie?  No.  Each one stands on its own and the performances are outstanding in both.<br />But both films take its viewers into dark uncharted waters where there are no white hats or black hats.<br />Like life, they're just not that easy.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AMVA4R3G58TV.html">A1AMVA4R3G58TV</a><br/><p>I attended a screening where Clint Eastwood spoke after the film.

It succeeds brilliantly, and is a benchmark for movies where character and not plot take center stage.<br /><br />First, you must have a plot, even if it's not the centerpiece of the movie.  Too many "character-based" dramas are meandering messes that go nowhere.  In contrast, "Mystic River" has enough of a plot to keep things moving, and it's interesting.<br /><br />Second, you must have a good script.  Oftentimes "character-driven" movies are tedious at best, because the characters have nothing to say.  Here, the screenwriter really created some memorable characters and great dialogue.  I am sure that Robbins, Bacon and Penn had a lot to do with that, too.<br /><br />That leads into point three - you must have great actors to breathe life into your characters, when your characters are your movie.  Robbins, Bacon and Penn have never been better, and each do a fantastic job.  Their performances are engrossing, and keep the film from dragging.<br /><br />Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>My last review was really long, but for some reason didn't get posted here. So I will make this one short. Sean Penn deserves the Oscar to go along with his Golden Globe, as does Tim Robbins. They are both really great, especially Penn. Kevin Bacon and Laurence Fishburne are also really good as the cop duo trying to break the case. I was going to give this movie 4 stars, but then I began to realize that I have been thinking about this movie since I saw it two days ago, so I think that warrants that extra star. It's that powerful. If you are in the mood for a slow moving thriller with plenty of interesting characters and dialogue, check this movie out as I did. I missed this film on its first theatrical run, but when I heard they were bringing it back to theaters for a few weeks I went out and saw it the very next day. I'm glad I did, and so will you if you take my advice.</p></br><a href="../users/A1N0LCPR7O7OLL.html">A1N0LCPR7O7OLL</a><br/><p>Powerful, admirable filmmaking from Eastwood and Co. in this dark and brooding drama starring Sean Penn and Tim Robbins.  This better sweep at the Oscars.  This is now one of my new favorite films.  I was particularly surprised with how strong Lawrence Fishburne and Kevin Bacon were in the film.  I loved their scenes together.  The teens/kids (i.e. Brendan) were terrific and turned in stunning performances.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>I just saw this film today because I had missed it in its first run at the theaters, but I heard that it was just put back in theaters. I was going to give this movie only 4 stars, then I began to realize that I had been thinking about this film ever since I got home over 8 hours ago. This is just one of those movies that won't leave your mind for days, it's that powerful. Okay, I'm gonna come right out and say this is Sean Penn's finest performance of his career. He deserved that Golden Globe he won last night, and he really should get the Oscar too. He displays so many emotions in this film it's hard to "Penn" down what his character is really feeling. Of all the performances in this great cast, Penn's felt like he wasn't even acting. It almost looked too real. I also really liked Kevin Bacon and Laurance Fishburne in the roles of the cop duo trying to break the case. The only main performance I really didn't care for too much was that of Tim Robbins, which also got him a Golden Globe last night. I know a lot of people said he was great and convincing in this role as a man with a tortured soul, but I found many of his strong emotional scenes unbelievable. Don't get me wrong he was good in this movie, but not his greatest role and film which I believe is still The Shawshank Redemption. The twist ending wasn't quite what I expected, but I still left the theater emotionally drained and yet satisfied. This is easily one of Clint Eastwood's best films and should be seen by all who have patience for a slow moving, yet interesting story. See it in theaters before you have to wait a few months or more for it to hit Dvd. I know I'm glad I did!</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>I was fortunate that I went to see &quot;Mystic River&quot; today knowing nothing more than that Sean Penn headed an impressive cast in a film directed by Clint Eastwood.  Consequently, I watched this story unfold without any preconceptions whatsoever and was able to get into the flow of the movie to the point that when Penn's Jimmy Markum declares that he knows that he had a hand in the twists of fate that led to the murder of his 19-year old daughter, Katie (Emmy Rossum), I knew that this was a pivotal line in the film and a key to unraveling the mystery.<p>&quot;Mystic River&quot; begins with a past that is prologue.  The only real clue is that Luis Tiant is the Boston Red Sox pitcher under discussion by the guys on the front porch.  Three young boys are interrupted while writing their names in drying cement by evil wearing a false face of authority.  We learn enough of the details to understand how all three boys are scarred, in different ways, and that when circumstances bring them together a couple of decades later, what happened way back when is a material part of their present realities when Jimmy's world is shattered by his daughter's violent murder.  <p>Beyond that I am not inclined to get into much more detail regarding the plot.  The script by Brian Helgeland, adapted from the novel by Dennis Lehane, does a good job of laying out the clues and false leads.  I found that I was just far ahead enough of the dual investigations, one by the cops Jimmy (Kevin Bacon) and Whitey (Laurence Fishburne), the other by local thugs Val (Kevin Chapman) and Nick Savage (Adam Nelson), to know they were getting closer but not putting the pieces together the right way.  However, even though I know that telling such a story in a world where modern forensics turns a pint of blood in the trunk of a car into a mountain of damning evidence, the holes in the story's logic did not prove a distraction and my only serious comment would be that I would have changed the motive of the murder to conform better with Jimmy's self-incriminating epiphany.  The film plays fair with the audience and ultimately it is the characters that captivate us. <p>It is only November but it is not too early to talk about Eastwood and this film getting nominated for Academy Awards.  Sean Penn is almost certainly going to get an Oscar nomination for his performance and I would expect the same for the eerily sedate Tim Robbins, although I suspect it will be in the Supporting Actor category.  But the performances of the entire cast are outstanding and it is easy to believe that these people all grew up in this neighborhood and are indeed feeling the pains that force them to make the life altering decisions they do in the course of this film.  The film's tagline--&quot;We bury out sins, we wash them clean&quot;--is not paraphrased until the climax, but we recognize the truth of that idea long before that point.<br /><br />This is also a film that successfully hints at the depth of the novel, no more so when Jimmy's second wife, Annabeth (Laura Linney) delivers what is essentially the films benediction and provides a new perspective on the events that have transpired, putting them rather unexpectedly on a larger level.  As I turn over this film in my mind my final question is whether &quot;Mystic River&quot; is more akin to a Shakespearean tragedy or an ancient Greek tragedy.  Either way, Clint Eastwood has presented a film that tells of tragedy on a grand scale even if it is played out in a small corner of South Boston.</p></br><a href="../users/AIFNOZKR9WTYI.html">AIFNOZKR9WTYI</a><br/><p>Ok, listen, last night I watched this sorry flim (even to call it a film is to overstate its ontological stature) and then tendered my disgust in the form of a one-star review.  Today, I find myself still reeling from the unbelievable lousiness of the pickture.  It staggers the mind that anyone can possibly tolerate this inferno of badness.  But at least one is now able to definitively write off the entire cast plus the director.  Anyone who got involved with this stinker without having a gun put to his/her head is an idiot, plain and simple.  Whaa?  You want examples?  Well, lets just say that a certain detective (kevin bacon) knows full well who committed a certain crime but decides that this particular criminal mastermind and his equally brilliant sidekicks are just too staggeringly competent and so he resolves to not even try to find any evidence - like a body floating in a river with some slugs in it, hello? - of who might have done the crime.  We are given to unnerstand that this crime will just have to go unsolved, due to the criminal genius of those who committed it.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>I know "Mystic River" is a great film.  It has unanimously great acting from the cast, and its gloomy mood is morbidly appealing.  but you may not like it.  And I didn't like it either for all its greatness, I confess.<p>Still it's a four-star film, deserving one win of Oscar of maybe two.  The story is about three ordinary kids in Boston, Jimmy, Dave and Sean.  When they are 11 year-old boys, playing baseball and having fun curving their names on the street, a guy with a badge scolds them, ordering only Dave to come with him.  In the backseat of the car, Dave (and we) realizes that a traumatic event is waiting for him.<p>After 25 years later, Dave and Jimmy are living in the same neighborhood.  But one daughter of Jimmy is brutally murdered, and Sean, now a police detective, comes back to his old places to meet them again.  As Sean investigates the case, Jimmy is also desperately after the murderer, and Dave's wife (Marcia Gay Harden) thinks something is wrong with her husband.  <p>But what really happened, and is going to happen at the end?  The story (based on Dennis Lahane book, adapted by Brian Helgeland) is nothing that can be called original, and to some, it simply looks impossible.  Things turn up at the exact moment when the film wants them to happen, and the conclusion is too neatly done.  And if you love to watch mystery films, it's not hard to guess the truth.<p>The strength of the film is its actors.  Tim Robbins is impeccable as a man whose tragic past haunts and torments him forever, and Sean Penn gives another great acting as a man in agony whose own personality is his worst enemy.  If Kevin Bacon and Laurence Fishburne seem a little less impressive that is because they are now outsiders of this tightly secluded  community in which the two lost souls represented by Penn and Robbins keep wandering.<p>More surprisingly, director Clint Eastwood managed to bring life to female characters, especially to Dave's wife who has to witness his husband's pains so close.  Marcia Gay Harden, after her perfect turn in "Pollock," is wonderful to see though this "wonderful" means inevitably "painful."  <p>Do not watch it as a thriller; it's more about the characters.  And they must all somehow or another face their destinty.  But this somber tone of Greek tragedies is exactly the virtue of "Mystic River."</p></br><a href="../users/A2Z0A3DOG0EVTY.html">A2Z0A3DOG0EVTY</a><br/><p>My Fianc&eacute; and I like to watch LAW AND ORDER on TV.  She spends the whole episode trying to figure it out the mystery.  I watch the opening moments, meet all the characters, and think about it for a moment and of course I call the outcome 90% of the time.  It doesn't mean that I don't enjoy sitting through a good mystery.  It's just after a while it becomes more difficult for me not to figure out what happens in the end.<p>That's the problem I had with Clint Eastwood's (Blood Work) new film MYSTIC RIVER. It's a riveting and tense thriller, it's one of the best films of year and of course I went and ruined it for myself by figuring out the outcome about an hour before the movie ended.  Was it the "Old Economy of Characters" that made it so easy? Not really!  I think it's just the film has one logical ending and if you miss the clues you'll kick yourself in the head.<p>The story follows three friends in South Boston.  They are Jimmy (Sean Penn, I Am Sam), Dave (Tim Robbins, Bob Roberts), and Sean (Kevin Bacon, Wild Things).  As kids, Dave was kidnapped and raped by some guys dressed liked cops, they kept him in a dirty cellar for four years until he escaped. He got home but he never quite recovered.  Jimmy grew up to be a petty thief, served two years in prison, and is now a legitimate shopkeeper is his neighborhood, and Sean is now a detective with a marriage that's almost non-existent.  These three friends are forced to come to grips with their friendship when Jimmy's daughter (Emmy Rossum, Songcatcher) winds up murdered.  <p>MYSTIC RIVER is about the sins of our past, mistaken identities, and those small moments that change our lives forever.  It's about what ties us all together, how we face our demons, and the bonds of friendship and family.  It's also about flawed people forced to face the demons.  It's probably the best-acted film I've seen all year.<p>Sean Penn gives the performance of a lifetime.  I finally forgive him for the travesty that was I AM SAM and I'm hoping that he moves on as well.  There is a powerful moment, as he must tell his wife (Laura Linney, The Life of David Gale) that his daughter (From a first marriage) is dead.  The two of them look at each other for a moment and then embrace.  This kind of scene is very rarely powerful, in most films it's almost laughable, but all I could think was "Wow!"  For once it wasn't mucked up.  For once a director allowed raw power to move a scene and not harsh swelling music.<p>Clint Eastwood has proved once again that with the right material he can direct a film that is smart and well told.  He has a very shaky track record, for every UNFORGIVEN, there are messes like TRUE CRIME and BLOOD WORK.  MYSTIC RIVER is better than UNFORGIVEN, but these two films will be considered classics.<p>I liked MYSTIC RIVER.  I liked how it unfolded.  I just wish I could have shut my brain down because I hate it when I call the end of a good mystery.  It reminded me of the moment when I called the end of THE OTHERS.  Of course I loved the film, but I felt cheated by my own cleverness.  I sometimes wish I could enjoy a movie like the masses.  But since I can't,  I will sing MYSTIC RIVER'S praises, and beseech the Academy to nominate Penn for this performance, he deserves it.<p>So, If you're looking for a taught thriller with lots of mystery give MYSTIC RIVER a chance.  It's well worth two hours of your time.<p>****1/2  (out of 5)</p></br><a href="../users/AUDSM2CTLLW1Q.html">AUDSM2CTLLW1Q</a><br/><p>Whenever a movie receives an avalanche of critical support, I get a little hesitant about seeing that film.  What typically happens is towards the latter third of the year, movie studios will release their films that they feel are most likely to receive Oscar nominations.  The problem that occurs is that many of these movies generate tremendous advanced word and end being the benefactors of the mob mentality among films critics.  If a few notable critics give `Year's 10 Best' acclaim to these award-season films, the majority of other critics will feel pressured to make themselves believe the movie is just as great.  Unfortunately, many times, these films prove to be just `ok' at best, and frequently they may actually be quite bad.  In past years, films that received an astounding amount of critical acclaim, but were inappropriate, unsatisfying, or downright clunkers include "The Sweet Hereafter", "I Am Sam", and the Laura Linney debacle "You Can Count on Me".<br /><br />The latest offering by director (not actor) Clint Eastwood, "Mystic River" falls firmly into that category of the over-praised year-end films.  The reputation of the director, not to mention a grade-A cast that includes Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, Laurence Fishburne, Kevin Bacon, Laura Linney, and Marcia Gay Harden gives this film a pedigree that few films have ever had.  The previews make "Mystic River" look like a truly powerful and moving film.  However, there's a danger with movies whose sole source of power is the impact they are able to have on your emotions, as is the case here.  The danger is that, when in the course of being emotionally gripped (or manipulated, depending on your point of view), the audience reacts very poorly to any plot developments that confuse, distract, or disturb them.  Disturbing, inappropriate, and unnecessary subplots destroyed whatever affect "The Sweet Hereafter" was aiming for.  In "Mystic River" some confusing developments nearly derail this film, as well.<br /><br />The story, itself, focuses on the lives of three friends from Boston.  As children, they were inseparable, until one day when a despicable cop and priest deceive, kidnap, and molest one of the boys.  The boy, named Dave, escapes, but his life and the friendship of all three of them is changed irrevocably.  Fast forward 25 years and the three friends have long since gone their separate ways.  Dave (played by Tim Robbins) is still shattered by what happened to him as a child, but is trying to have some semblance of a normal life with a wife and a young son of his own.  One of the two other friends, Sean (Kevin Bacon), is now a Boston homicide cop whose estranged wife has an annoying habit of always calling him, but never saying anything.  The other friend, Jimmy (Sean Penn), is an ex-con who controls something that resembles his neighborhood's underworld, though he is trying his best to stay as legitimate as possible for the benefit of his children (one is an older daughter from a previous marriage and two are young girls from his current marriage).  There lives end up intersecting again on a terrible day in which Jimmy's oldest is found murdered after a night of partying.  Sean is one of the cops assigned to investigate the case and Dave's wife is the cousin of Jimmy's wife and tries to be supportive in their time of need.  Questionable motives first lead to a number of suspects before Dave's bizarre behavior begins to draw the focus squarely on him.<br /><br />What makes this movie work, and why I won't give it a negative recommendation, is the powerhouse performances a few of the actors.  In this respect, the critics are correct in heaping praise on this movie.  Sean Penn's devastation as the grieving (and aggrieved) father is heart wrenching.  It is top-notch performance.  Yet, even it pales in comparison to the sorrowful and agonizing performance given by Tim Robbins as Dave.  Robbins, who is normally viewed as a better director than an actor, hits all the right notes in his embodiment of Dave.  In Robbins portrayal, you can empathize and almost sympathize with emotions and distress that are an everyday part of Dave's life.  He's a man who hasn't felt like he will ever be human again or ever be an accepted member of society, no matter how hard he tries.  These performances are what make this film go.<br /><br />On the downside, there are uninspiring performances by Kevin Bacon and Laura Linney (who plays Jimmy's wife), and a bizarrely neurotic one by Marcia Gay Harden as Dave's unsympathetic wife.  In addition, "Mystic River" includes that `confusing' moment that leaves you scratching your head and saying, "what just happened here?"  Without revealing any crucial plot details, it can be said that at the end of the movie, there is a scene where Jimmy is confessing to his wife about the actions he has taken and his wife gives a bizarre and confusing monologue where she seems as though she could be a related to Lady MacBeth.  Even though the climax of the movie was a bit unsatisfying, it was arrived at honestly.  The inclusion of this odd denouement can't do anything but make the viewer feel unnaturally uncomfortable with everything that took place in this film.  Now, it is fact that this last scene is present in the book "Mystic River", but it left readers very uncomfortable there, too.  Under the guise of `artistic license', Clint Eastwood would have been well served by excluding that scene.<br /><br />On the whole, "Mystic River" is not a bad movie, and I give it three stars (though just barely).  The points made above demonstrate why this film is not worthy of ridiculous praise it is receiving, but on its own merits is still a credible film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2W00XKTTF1G0Z.html">A2W00XKTTF1G0Z</a><br/><p>5 - MYSTIC RIVER<br />Clint Eastwood (Unforgiven, Sudden Impact. Space Cowboys) has directed for many years and this film is one of the best Who Done It - I have seen in along time. He makes you guess and guess and guess. Just when you thought you figured it out - Wrong! I even got mad at myself watching this because I thought I was pretty sharp...but....oh well.<p>This film is well crafted and very intricate in the story. I really admire Kevin Bacon's (Footloose, Wil & Grace, Apollo 13, The River Wild) for his performance as the straight lace detective of the group of three boys who grew up with a very common episode that happened in their lives as kids.<p>Sean Penn (I Am Sam, State of Grace, Thin Red Line) give an incredible performance as a father who has a tragedy happen to him and makes choices that affect everyone's life. He is scary in this film.<p>Tim Robbins give a stellar performance the boy with the past who haunts his future and creates a situation that he can not control. He is a nut - with a twist...and the stunning performance by his wife played by -Marcia Gay Harden (Space Cowboys, Flubber) makes you feel even more creepy.<p>Laurence Fishburne (The Matrix 1,2 & 3, Event Horizon) gives a great compliment to being Kevin bacons partner.<br />It is truly a mystery within a mystery. Set in today's world of CSI and crime solving Real TV environments - this puts a new twist on who you think did it.<p>Beautifully photographed and stunning camera work make this a very intriguing mystery.

Oh, how I wished I had read the spoilers first!<p>It was tightly directed, though with a style and feel that echoed a much better film, A Perfect World.  But unlike A Perfect World, where the were good guys, bad buys and bad guys who had good in them, this film has no one that is likeable, no one you can respect.  Worse, it has no remorse, and that is SO sad, no redemption. <p>Bacon, Penn, and Robinson put in strong performances in their going nowhere roles.  I admired Eastwood's flair in A Perfect World, an emotional film that touched you on all levels.  Only this movie...well, you want to wash after watching it.  You cannot empathize with Penn's character, even though the murder of his 19-year-old daughter is the focal point of the film.  Sorry, to point all the problems of this film one would have to go into spoilers left and right (I wish someone had told me the spoilers before!).  There are devises that have no place in the film, that do nothing to further the storyline, just Eastwood's sense of quirky?  Quirky worked in A Perfect World, quirky worked in Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil.  Quirky in this films was an insult to the intelligence of the viewer.  I have loved Eastwood since his Rowdy Yates days, and marveled all the films he has starred in or directed ever since.  But this one just is so pointless.  This movie has a lack of honor, of true caring, of heart and it just hurts to see such talent put to such a useless waste of 2 ? hours.<p>My best advice - Rent this film before you buy or - be sure to read all the BAD reviews before making up your mind.  Most people will not enjoy the senseless violence and to no end.  Most people will not like the total remorse in nearly all the characters.</p></br><a href="../users/A356TJCTCLDN89.html">A356TJCTCLDN89</a><br/><p>I have great respect for Clint Eastwood as a director but if you already saw Sleepers then you can happily skip this movie. It's dull, slow and Sean Penn does the worst Robert DeNiro imitation I have ever seen.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EFS5PV3HOFDI.html">A1EFS5PV3HOFDI</a><br/><p>Mystic River was the first movie that I have ever watched that was directed from Clint Eastwood, and I am happy to say that it was worth the time.<br /><br />Mystic River is very sad, and rather depressing. If you've ever watched the Sleepers, then you'll understand when I say that Mystic River was exactly like that one. Except this time Kevin Bacon was on the right side of the law.<br /><br />The ending did nothing in making the film lighter or more joyous, instead, it left me even more sad than when the movie began. Not the best way in ending a movie, but thats life I guess, not everything is going to turn out for the better. Still, I couldn't help but wonder if things could have turned out  better, and what would have happened instead if such a thing was possible.</p></br><a href="../users/A24F1UX8ZT5IXY.html">A24F1UX8ZT5IXY</a><br/><p>So many great criticisms have been written about this film on Amazon already: from the ridiculous plot that relies on about 20 coincidences and characters witholding crucial information in completely unrealistic ways -- to Sean Penn's inconsistent and overacted performance -- to the silly Lady Macbeth speech at the end which didn't have a freakin' thing to do with anything that came before. A lack of directoral skill seems very evident, as people are just acting up storms all around the place with nowhere to go. If the film attempted to be a trenchant look at loyalties and dynamics in a working-class urban environment, it failed. If it was really trying to be a sophisticated, postmodern whodunnit -- it failed.  Even the costume design (Sean Penn's Donnie Brasco jacket at the end looked ridiculous and way too Hollywood) was off the mark by leagues.  This film is very infuriating becuase it makes you sit through all this  "character development" and then it simply hemmorages on itself.  The redeeming elements? Well at least it was about human beings and not explosions / car chases. Bacon and Fishbourne were good.</p></br><a href="../users/A1K3NQAO49LXL2.html">A1K3NQAO49LXL2</a><br/><p>A truly frightening film, I just didn't know in what way. Of course, it's really all about the moral ambiguity of Sean Penn, which we see in every single scene of the film (although we don't know it at the time). Tim Robbins is fantastic as the mortally screwed-up Dave, who was kidnapped as a child by child molesters under the eyes of his two friends. As adults, their lives intersect over the murder of Penn's daughter. Nothing is as it seems, and the unravelling of the story is fascinating. Unfortunately, there's a superfluous sub-plot over Kevin Bacon's estranged wife, who has escaped to New York to give birth anonymously to their child. While it seems superfluous, it may also serve to display that Bacon's character, while he has his problems, got off the lightest of the three.<br /><br />The film was made in Boston, so it has a "The Departed" feel to it somehow. I have been to Boston, but I didn't get a feeling like this about the place. I should ask my friends from there how the fims rate.</p></br><a href="../users/AIFNOZKR9WTYI.html">AIFNOZKR9WTYI</a><br/><p>Here's another run at the badness of this movie.  Warning, will blow whole plot.  This review is intended for people who have seen this trash and are trying desperately to reassure themselves that they are not alone in hating it.<br />Tim Robbin's character, Dave Boyle, was raped by men as a child.  Since then he has lived his life as best he can, apparently.  He is a devoted husband and father.  On the night that Sean Penn's character's daughter is murdered, Boyle has the bad luck to murder a pedophile right at the same time and to behave cagily accordingly.  Thereupon he is mistaken by lots of people for Penn's daughter's murderer and is eventually executed by Penn.  When it becomes known that he is not the killer, that he did in fact kill a pedophile who was in the process of sexing-up a young boy, the general consensus is, "Ahh, well, its for the best anyway"  the idea being that since he was raped as a child he's pretty much better off dead.  As one character puts it, "Looks like damaged goods to me."  And as Sean Penn's character figuratively says, "The last time I saw Dave Boyle?  It was (before he was molested as a child)."  So, do you see why I loathe this flick on a variety of levels?  Do you?  It is not enough for the flick to contain bad acting, bad writing, bad directing, bad continuity... the picture also is morally vile:  it is a message movie, the basic message of which is, "If you were molested as a child, do everyone a favor and put a bullet in your head.  You're finished.  Gee, that's real inspiring.</p></br><a href="../users/A39AWL2FKWDFK6.html">A39AWL2FKWDFK6</a><br/><p>Clint Eastwood does a superlative job in directing an extremely fine cast in his gloomy, foreboding portrayal of Dennis Lehane's poignant novel.  <p>Three boyhood friends, Jimmy, Sean and Dave who grew up in a lower middle class Boston neighborhood reunite due to the apparent murder of one of their children.  The boys have taken separate and divergent paths since one of them was abducted and molested many years ago.  Sean Penn is superb playing Jimmy Markham, a reformed ex-con whose daughter was murdered.  The murder investigation is headed by Trooper Sean Devine played by Kevin Bacon and his partner Laurence Fishburn.  Tim Robbins does a creditable job in his portrayal of Dave Boyle, a married working stiff tormented by internal demons as a result of his abduction.<br />Both Laura Linney and Marcia Gay Harden give convincing performances as Penn and Robbins's respective wives.<p>In one scene when Penn learns that his daughter is actually the murder victim, he goes off the deep end.  This awesome scene is reminiscent of James Cagney going ballistic in White Heat, one of the most classic scenes in cinema history.<p>The appearance of Eli Wallach, one of the most accomplished  character actors of all time, as the liquor store owner was a terrific reunion with Eastwood (not since The Good, The Bad and The Ugly).</p></br><a href="../users/A2UL0A8GJB4318.html">A2UL0A8GJB4318</a><br/><p>&quot;Mystic River&quot; is the kind of film you don't see much anymore. A powerful film that uses textured, mature acting and a story that cuts at its characters as its probes its own plot. Director Clint Eastwood is may bot be the most flashiest filmmaker out there, but his style feels as if it has evolved with experience and trial and error. Each shot looks and feels as if it has been set up by a skilled master of the game, and one who knows how to handle the story of &quot;Mystic River,&quot; adapted from the novel by Dennis Lehane.<br /><br /> Three friends from urban Boston (a dynamic acting trio of Sean Penn, Tim Robbins and Kevin Bacon) share a history. One that involves kidnapping and sexual abuse. As adults they have drifted apart, but when Jimmy's (Penn) daughter is discovered murdered, they come back together again as Sean (Bacon) is the cop assigned to the case Dave (Robbins) slowly becomes the prime suspect. Surprisingly, there is a lot of ground to cover, detailing Jimmys' chekered past as well as Dave dealing with his own wicked experience as a boy. Screenwriter Brian Helgeland (L.A.Confidential) does so with a clarity and even-handedness that proves invaluable. No major plot detail goes without being explained, and in a way that doesn't distract from the main murder mystery.<br /><br /> Eastwoods' supporting cast is equally stellar as the three leads. Marcia Gay Harden is haunting as Dave's wife, exuding subtle terror and fear that preludes the film's tragic two-pronged climax. Laura Linney has but a small part as Jimmey's wife but she makes an impact in the parade scene that ends the movie. The one real surprise of the film is Laurence Fishburne. For all of us who thought he was the walking dead in the ill-advised &quot;Matrix&quot; sequels, here he is a sly, humorous partner for Bacon, as well as being a great foil for the star in the scenes they share. Eastwood, however, makes the film. His style, though workmanlike, is masterful. He knows how to use the actors at his disposal and when he is at his best, he knows how to make a story deeply emotionally resonant, especially here with Helgeland's shrewd script. &quot;Mystic River&quot; is a film that you may not see often anymore, but it's one to be remembered.</p></br><a href="../users/A3956O40ZZYFMY.html">A3956O40ZZYFMY</a><br/><p>It is common knowledge that each of us reads a novel from our own unique perspective. Many reviewers have commented on Eastwood's faithfullness to the novel but I have never seen a book put to film seemingly from my own perspective until now. I have never been a believer in "channeling", but the notion fleeted across my mind when viewing this movie. Perhaps not all credit should go to Mr. Eastwood as whoever cast this movie chose actors that my "minds eye" seemed to invisage when reading the novel.<br />The actors performed incredibly, the score was excellent, just a tremendous movie to a surreal degree.</p></br><a href="../users/A2198O25QYUPXE.html">A2198O25QYUPXE</a><br/><p>Mystic River is a scintillating film that reassures the viewer to feel certain, and suddenly wallops this secure belief with startling revelations. Loyalties and objectivity are tested in the narrative of this movie, which concludes with assumptions as the cause of devastating miscalculations. A fantastic film!<br /><br />Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author</p></br><a href="../users/AUUH6Z8MSGGF.html">AUUH6Z8MSGGF</a><br/><p>Mystic River DVD Review<br />2 Disc Widescreen Edition (2003)<br /><br />Mystic River cleaned up and won Academy awards for Best Actor - Sean Penn, and Best Supporting Actor - Tim Robbins and was nominated for everything else you can think of. It did not, however win Best Picture. Directed by Clint Eastwood from the novel written by Dennis Lehane, Mystic River is about three childhood friends who after a tragic incident grow up to be a cop, a victim, and a suspect.<br /><br />This movie can feel very slow in the pacing and action. It takes a while for events to pick up and characters to start opening up. The feel of the movie and accuracy helps set the location very well. Everything is dark and in blues like the river. The ensemble cast is a big who's who of a generation in Hollywood. Since Clint Eastwood prefers to get everything done in one or two shots, you know actors had to step up their game and that makes the performances a little more impressive.<br /><br />I'm a fan of Tim Robbins, mostly because of The Shawshank Redemption. He just always finds a way to look so.......haunted. He plays a quiet, kinda crazy guy who was sexually abused as child when he was kidnapped and held prisoner in a cellar for four days. Now he's grown with a wife and child and comes home at 3 a.m. one night with blood on his hands. His facial expressions and tone of voice are so eerie. His character is a pathological liar because the time he told the truth when his friends lied, he was made into a victim. Now in any threatening situation, he lies to stay safe and it makes him even more of a suspect.<br /><br />Sean Penn's daughter played by Emmy Rossum (who is beautiful and innocent as always, this was her first notable role in a big film) is found to have been murdered. Penn does a heart-breaking job screaming over and over again, "Is that my daughter in there?" Honestly, he gets it in about ten times and has to be restrained by like seven guys to avoid going to see her body where they found it. He brings out the raw emotion at the drop of a hat and his performance is very compelling.<br /><br />Their other childhood friend, Kevin Bacon is one of the investigating cops along with Laurence Fishburne and they (of course) try to piece together the puzzle and find out what happened. There's a side mystery of his silent wife who calls him and says nothing which is sad but unessential to the core of the film. Bacon walking the line between victim's parent and suspect being his childhood friends is quite the feat. While they are not close any longer, under every conversation is a vast canyon of history that is addressed in subtext.<br /><br />Marcia Gay Harden plays Tim Robbins's wife and stays in the background looking worried and scared most of the movie. Laura Linney plays a great grieving stepmother and makes a big character turn that comes out of left field at the end of the movie. To avoid any spoilers for those who haven't seen it, the movie really could have ended after the main action when Sean Penn and Kevin Bacon were talking in the street. But no, it continues to show more aftermath conversations and a parade. I guess it is to set up the audience choosing in their minds what happened to the characters later, but it's really so ambiguous it feels like overkill. The comparison of marital relationships from which is most loving to which is most likely to last is interestingly ironic.<br /><br />This movie is good....but it just isn't THAT good. It has some beautiful individual performances but as a package, loses my interest at points. I guess the Academy and I have different standards......then again, it didn't win Best Picture now did it?<br /><br />DVD Extras:<br /><br />There are two featurettes, "Beneath the Surface" and "From Page to Screen" that go over the casting of the movie, production details, Eastwood's one-take style of directing, and the accuracies of where they shot the movie. The writer points out that they started shooting about a block and half away from where he wrote the book. Also the writer was very concerned that all these Hollywood actors would sound different than how he heard his characters in his head, but that they mastered their accents and characters well to his imagination. There are full-length interviews from "The Charlie Rose Show" that into detail with Clint Eastwood, Kevin Bacon, and Tim Robbins. No Sean Penn? The part of the extras I enjoyed the most was commentary with Tim Robbins and Kevin Bacon. I always enjoy actor commentary the most since I have a background in acting in theatre and film myself. They break down some of the scenes and reveal a little more about motivations for why certain things were done and are just interesting to listen to if you are fans of their work. This edition also includes a complete CD soundtrack which I did not have the pleasure of checking out because the copy I had was from the library and didn't include it. Bleah!</p></br><a href="../users/A2DAHERP7HYJGO.html">A2DAHERP7HYJGO</a><br/><p>I wasn't sure what to expect with MYSTIC RIVER. I know that Clint Eastwood is a highly underrated director. I know that the stars were all part of a generation of actors known for the quality of their work. But something about this movie never made me want to rush to see it. I'm glad that I finally got to it.<br /><br />The film opens with three young friends playing on the street, scraping their names in fresh cement. A police detective gives the kids a hard time for what they are doing and takes the one who doesn't live in the nearby houses home. The truth though is that this is not a policeman and he doesn't take him home. Rather young Dave Boyle is abducted by two pedophiles that he escapes from later.<br /><br />The movie then jumps forward to present day where one of those youngsters now grown, Jimmy Markum (Sean Penn) owns his own market and watches as his daughter goes out for the night before his other daughters first communion. It is the last time he will see her alive. The next day she is found, murdered.<br /><br />This sets about a chain of events and a reunion of sorts for the boyhood pals. The third member of the three is Sean Devine (Kevin Bacon) who is now a detective for the State Police. And the murder falls under his jurisdiction.<br /><br />Young Dave has grown (Tim Robbins) and is still haunted by the experiences of his past. And the night that Jimmy's daughter was murdered Dave saw her and also came home covered in someone else's blood. Putting these items together, Dave's wife Celeste (Marcia Gay Harden) begins to wonder about her husband. He claims to have been mugged and to have beaten the mugger to death. But no newspaper articles make her doubt his story.<br /><br />The main portion of the movie moves across the stories of the individuals involved. Jimmy wants vengeance and will do anything to find and kill the person responsible for his daughter's murder. Dave grapples with the demons of his past. And Sean just wants to believe that his friends can't be involved in the murder as he searches for the real killer.  Each becomes a piece of the puzzle, the answer of which is not revealed until films end. But by then, the world is turned upside down and facts are misplaced.<br /><br />While some might have thought this was a simple murder mystery, a whodunit put together by Eastwood, it is much deeper than that. It is a look into the psyche of three very different people who grew up together, who were affected by their past. The inner struggles of all three are different, but all tied into their past as well. And this makes for a drama unlike any mystery could hold.<br /><br />Perhaps the biggest thing that this film offers is a ton of outstanding performances that will be hard to match in any current film. An assembly of talent such as this is rare in today's films. Most notable is Sean Penn as the father in turmoil. All accolades he received were well deserved.<br /><br />Make a point of renting this one. You won't be disappointed. And the discovery of just who the killer is, whether it is Dave or perhaps Jimmy's daughter's boyfriend or someone else, makes for a fitting together of clues that mold well. Give this one a watch.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>I have not read the book, although my wife has and she said that the movie followed it quite well.  I wanted to say that first because it's such a hollywood tradition to drastically change a novel when creating a film adaptation that they rape it of everything that made it special in the beginning.  I'm glad to hear that Eastwood did not do that to Dennis Lehane's masterpiece (or so I hear that it is a wonderfull novel)  That said, I was surprised at how well this movie was done.  I mean, when a film is that glorified it better be perfect, and I really was expecting to be let down, but to my shock I was not, not at all.  The acting I must admitt was amazing, especially on the part of Tim Robbins who plays Dave Boyle, the grown man still trapped in the mind of the child he once was.  The story revolves around three friends years after one of them was molested.  That one was Dave.  Now they are all grown and have moved on.  Jimmy Markham (Penn) is a one time crook (or is it one time) who is now married and has a beautiful daughter Katie (Emmy Rossum from Phantom of the Opera).  Dave is also married to Marcia Gay Harden's charactor and Sean Devine (Kevin Bacon) is now a police detective.  All three of these men have rarly kept in touch (especially Kevin Bacon's charactor) but are all forced to interact after Jimmy's daughter is brutally murdered, Dave becomes the prime suspect and Sean has to investigate.  The story itself is gripping and the whole charactor study was wonderfully exicuted.  Both Laura Linney and Marcia Gay Harden did wonderful jobs as supporting and yet greiving wives, one as she deals with the loss of a daughter and the other while she struggles with the idea that her husband is a killer.  I was in tears by the end of the film (for more than one reason) for this is one of the most moving films I've ever seen.  I will say this.  Sean Penn was great, but I felt his performance in 21 Grams was better.  Tim Robbins is the reason this film works so well...just watching his charactor move you can see all that he is and you know that Tim became Dave Boyle...and that is a good thing, a very good thing...How Lord of the Rings beat this as best film of the year I'll never understand...</p></br><a href="../users/ACMAUJEBY6GJF.html">ACMAUJEBY6GJF</a><br/><p>Sean Penn and Tim Robbins are really that great in this movie, and no surprise there. Two of the best actors in the world today.<br /><br />But :<br /><br />It doesn't take you long to reveal the plot, does it? In the beginning of the movie we hear two boys call 991, "Your name, son?" the police ask - "He wants to know her name" the boy tells "someone" - hmmm...<br /><br />Wouldn't cops in the USA check out the anymonous call a little closer when they start their investigation. In the end (!) this call reveals it all, there is no grown man the police should be after. A major weakness to the story, and I realize I am not the only one to notice this, of course - or am I picky here?<br /><br />Anyway :<br /><br />Overall this movie is very, very well done - great camera-work, acting - and that behind a very tense and gripping story.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>During a summer in 1975, Dave Boyle and two friends, Jimmy and Sean, are playing on a sidewalk in Boston when Dave is abducted by two men and subjected to sexual abuse over a period of several days. Eventually escaping, but haunted into adulthood by his trauma, Dave becomes a primary suspect when Jimmy's daughter, Katie, is found murdered. Sean, assigned to investigate the crime, finds himself facing both demons from the past and demons in the present as the circumstances surrounding Katie's death are uncovered. "Mystic River" is a surprisingly dark movie, with a controversial denouement. It is masterfully directed, acted, shot, edited, lit and scored. It is a mostly humorless and occasionally difficult realist drama, that will undoubtedly affect most viewers emotionally in a variety of ways. The story is absorbing. "Mystic River" is a impressive achievement for those who made it and a rich, memorable experience for those who see it.</p></br><a href="../users/A13OMT8D4GPIBV.html">A13OMT8D4GPIBV</a><br/><p>Mystic River is a director's dream when it comes to the cast.  Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, and Kevin Bacon all give excellent performances in this flawed masterpiece.  The supporting casts exemplifies the material perfectly.  One of the best of 2003.<br /><br />This particular DVD is such and upgrafe from the barebones disc.  The DVD features a commentary with Tim Robbins and Kevin Bacon and a few featurettes.  Also included in this three disc release is the film's soundtrack.<br /><br />Must Have.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PN7Z2VTHICL8.html">A2PN7Z2VTHICL8</a><br/><p>The first thing I would like to recommend about Mystic River is that you watch it twice before coming to any conclusions.  Not that it will change the mystery, but so you can fully appreciate what the actors and filmmakers achieved with this movie.<br /><br />It an old plot line of tragedy occurring in the bloom of youth that affects the lives of a group of friends later in life, but Mystic River goes far deeper than most of the stories that follow this path.  I haven't been this overwhelmed by this particularly downtrodden plot since Lorenzo Carcaterra's "Sleepers" (the book, NOT the movie).<br /><br />Jimmy, Dave, and Sean (played by Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, and Kevin Bacon respectively) were childhood friends growing up in a "working man" neighborhood, when a cop stops to confront them about carving their names into fresh cement on the sidewalk.<br /><br />The "cops" take Dave away, but they weren't cops; they were child molesters.  Dave is held captive by these monsters for four days, until he manages to escape.<br /><br />The movie then skips to present time, roughly thirty years later, and picks up on the lives of the boys.  Dave is married, marginally employed, with a young son of his own and dark memories of his past.  Sean is a detective, with an absent wife that telephones him at odd hours and says nothing.  Jimmy is married, three daughters, and owns a corner store.  Jimmy also has a criminal past, and an active relationship with the Savage Boys, neighborhood tough guys.<br /><br />Jimmy's nineteen year old daughter, Katie, is brutally murdered, and while Sean heads the investigation of her death, Dave retracts more into his own world, hiding a dark secret.<br /><br />Is Mystic River a riveting movie?  No.  Is Mystic River the kind of mystery that has you on the edge of your seat?  No.<br /><br />Although there is a pleasant twist in the ending, there are no surprises and no biting of fingernails.<br /><br />What you will feel is that tingle of dread creeping along your spine, a vague horror constructed of real life tragedy, a shivering echo of "what if", all portrayed superbly by this stellar cast.  Tim Robbins is always great, but his portrayal of Dave's tortured mind is provocative and stunningly realistic; this may be Robbin's greatest performance to date.<br /><br />And I never expected Sean Penn to develop into such an exceptional actor, Mystic River really is his finest hour on screen.<br /><br />So yes, the movie unfolds at a slow pace, but at no point did I find myself bored or loosing interest in the storyline.  The acting was inspired, the storyline is a fresh twist on a used plot, the mystery enough of an unknown to keep the pace, the dialogue believable, and the horror kept well hidden in the shadowy corners of your own imagination.<br /><br />Over all, I highly recommend this movie.  Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A2GPEV42IO41CI.html">A2GPEV42IO41CI</a><br/><p>In Mystic River, director Clint Eastwood has taken the themes of  pain and loss, added superb actors, and a literate script to make a memorable movie.<br /><br />Jimmy, Sean, and Dave were childhood buddies growing up in a working-class neighborhood in Boston.  One day, Dave was lured away and sexually abused by two men.  Years later, Jimmy (Penn) is an ex-con with a loving family, Sean (Bacon) is a cop with marital woes, and Dave (Robbins), forever damaged by his childhood trauma, is barely clinging to reality.  When Jimmy's daughter is murdered, Sean investigates, Jimmy vows vigilante justice, and Dave is a prime suspect.<br /><br />The lead actors are outstanding here.  Penn is utterly convincing as the former thug and grieving father.  Robbins displays his acting chops in the performance of a lifetime, showing a fragile man dealing with such pain that he can no longer function rationally.  The two men certainly deserved their Oscars.<br /><br />This is a movie that will pull at your heartstrings while keeping you guessing who the killer is.  There are, thankfully, no graphic scenes of child abuse or the girl's death, yet you will be on the edge of your seat much of the time.  This is an outstanding film.</p></br><a href="../users/A319SKSB556033.html">A319SKSB556033</a><br/><p>Spoilers thar be!<p>I remember being hyped at seeing this film at the Edinburgh International Film Festival last year, as were a lot of other people. Then, for no known reason, Clint Eastwood cancelled and we were left to wait another six months for the film to be released nationwide. <p>Was it worth the wait. Well, while I've never doubted Eastwood's talents behind the camera (I really liked Absolute Power) there is just something in this film that fails to connect with me. <p>The story of three childhood friends (Penn, Robbins, Bacon) torn apart as adults after one of them is abducted is intriguing. <p>Penn is the thug father with a loathsome and heartless wife (Laura Linney), Robbin's is the meek and humble dad with a loving (but totally traitor) wife (Marcia Gay Harden) and Bacon is the investigating Cop who's wife has run away. All of them perform very well, especially Robbin's who has always struggled to shed his 'nice but dim' typecasting. And Eastwood's direction takes its time and builds the story at a deliberate, unrushed pace. <p>But as soon as Sean Penn's daughter is murdered I lost all sympathy for them. The story falls into darkness as suspicions and tensions mount. Every character gets what they deserve. I had no connection with Marcia Gay Harden at all and her panic and denial at the end is her own fault. Her character was the wife of Tim Robbins' for what appears to be over a decade, she simply would have known her husband wasn't a killer, should never have confided in Sean Penn. Tim Robbins is also to blame for telling lies about how he came home bleeding and shaken.<p>Sean Penn's character also gets what's coming to him (though it's a bit of a let-down we don't actually see it). He's a bad man and despite his brilliant acting and grief at the loss of his daughter, why on earth would I care about such a despicable man? <p>Basically, many horrors and tragedies could have been avoided in this story if people just told the truth. Fair enough, there wouldn't BE a story if that were so but the result is a film that I cannot engage with and in the end I just don't care.<p>The DVD is in great-looking 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen with Dolby 5.1 sound. There are 2 extra discs worth of features (one of them is a soundtrack CD) if you can't get enough. I've had my share of this movie. It may have much greatness to it, but I want no more.</p></br></body></html>

Hudson is pretty good considering but, I don't think her performance is Oscar worthy. When I think of all the performances over the years that got snubbed at the Oscars, it's a crime to see this young lady walk away with an Oscar for just a "good" performance. Dustin Hoffman "Toosie", Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Robert De Niro "Flawless", Richard Harris and Robert Duvall "Wrestling Earnest Hemingway" even Sean Penn in "Fast Times at Ridgemont High" oh well, the list goes on and on. It's an OK story that has been done before better. Even though Hudson's vocals are good, they are not show stopping! Rent it don't buy it. 2 1/2 Stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DK5AZMXS1QA3.html">A1DK5AZMXS1QA3</a><br/><p>For all the importance of music within African-American history, musicals used to be a whites-only genre in Hollywood.  Then came Queen Latifah's role in Chicago in 2002, followed by the hit Ray in 2005.  But whereas Latifah had only a supporting role in Chicago, and Ray was more a drama with great music, this movie is truly a musical in every sense of the word, with all the major roles played by African-Americans.  The story is of three women in Detroit who grow up as childhood friends and become international pop stars.  Along the way, they meet men, become rich, break up, and finally reunite at the end of the movie.  The casting is great, and includes both older (Eddie Murphy and Danny Glover) and younger (Jennifer Hudson and Jamie Foxx) stars.  Many of them turn in great musical performances, and my personal favorite is Eddie Murphy, who puts in one dazzling stage show after another.  The movie portrays multiple facets of the celebrity life such as betrayal, substance abuse, sexual rivalries, money-grubbing, contractual disputes, and the ever present dumbing down of content to increase sales.  The movie makes occasional references to race issues.<br /><br />As a musical, the music pieces ranged from good to great.  Their placement in the movie however, was not the best.  The movie broke out in music during proper music scenes, like during the scenes of performances.  But the movie also had songs during "non-music" scenes.  For example, many conversations became singing scenes.  Unfortunately, the most heartfult songs; those with the most emotion, fell into the latter category, whereas the the stage performance songs sounded like generic pop hits.  This might have been done on purpose, as a reflection of the character Curtis's belief that the music has to be superficial and shallow enough to please all crowds.  But it detracted from the movie as half the songs had little heart but too much glitz.  This, and the constant replacement of dialogue with music was probably why this movie did not receive the Best Picture nomination at the Academy Awards.  My belief is that it is a better musical than Ray (also starring Jamie Foxx), but had nowhere near the heart or emotional punch to it.<br /><br />This DVD is fairly straightforward; movie plus extra scenes.  I just wished the DVD came with an option of playing the movie with all the extra scenes added into it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R2YB0WTTB0IJ.html">A3R2YB0WTTB0IJ</a><br/><p>2006. Written and directed by Bill Condon. 2 Academy awards. Third pseudo biopic in a row for Bill Condon who manages to describe in two hours the rise and fall (at least in term of quality) of the R&B record industry.</p></br><a href="../users/A31U2QT7SAL7K.html">A31U2QT7SAL7K</a><br/><p>2006's "Dreamgirls" shares much in common with 1985's "The Color Purple": a film with a mostly-black cast helmed by a white director (the latter guided by Bill Condon and the former by Steven Spielberg), a story adapted from another medium ("Purple" from Alice Walker's bestseller and "Dreamgirls" from the Broadway hit), a running time of over two hours ("The Color Purple" at 154 minutes while "Dreamgirls" runs at only 131), and multiple Oscar nominations but with few or no wins (eleven for "Purple" with no wins, eight for "Dreamgirls" with only two wins).<br /><br />It is the latter reason that is the greatest injustice.  Though he was nominated for best supporting actor, Eddie Murphy lost to Alan Arkin in the category and that loss was one of Oscar's greatest blunders.  Murphy is spectacular as the over-the-top-soul-man James "Thunder" Early in what could truly be described as that proverbial "role of a lifetime."  It's as though he was destined to play that part and he should have received an Oscar for his efforts.<br /><br />However, his is not the only ouststanding acting job in the film.  Oscar winner Jennifer Hudson, Jamie Foxx, Beyonce Knowles, Anika Noni Rose, Keith Robinson, and, in a lesser yet pivotal role, Danny Glover, all deliver brilliant performances and, for that, the film presents one of the best ensembles of the year.<br /><br />This multi-disc compilation is a packaging wonder.  Sporting a version filled with an extended cut, featuring twelve not-in-the-theatrical-version songs, a plethora of bonus and entertaining features/featurettes, this, like the movie, is entertainment of the highest value.<br /><br />'Tis a shame that Oscar voters didn't quite see it that way.</p></br><a href="../users/AWG2O9C42XW5G.html">AWG2O9C42XW5G</a><br/><p>this is a very good musical drama. this movie is awesome. I Recommend it for everyone</p></br><a href="../users/A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F.html">A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F</a><br/><p>Movie musicals gained new notoriety with the release of "Chicago" a few years back, so it was only natural that a studio was going to finally release the film version of "Dreamgirls". I say finally because ever since "Dreamgirls" debut on Broadway in 1981, starring Jennifer Holiday, there has been talk that this fine show would make it to the big screen. In 2006 "Dreamgirls" premiered at the boxoffice to audience and critical acclaim.<br /> I first saw most of the cast of "Dreamgirls" when they promoted the film on "Oprah" and I knew it was going to be a huge hit. Beyonce, Jennifer Hudson, Eddie Murphy, and Jamie Foxx star in this film based on the lives of 1960's girl group The Supremes. However, it is Jennifer Hudson's searing performance of Ellfie that steals the film with Oprah telling her that watching Hudson's performance is like "a religious experience".  She plays the role based on the life of Florence ballard, the Supreme who became an alcoholic and died broke. Beyonce is also great in the Diana Ross role. Everything from the beautiful music to the costumes is excellent, and you do not have to be a fan of Broadway musicals to enjoy this film. "Dreamgirls" is an entertaining movie for everyone who has ever had a dream of making it big in show business. Jennifer Hudson would reach superstardom by winning that years Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her role in the film.<br /> This 2 disc set comes with a slew of bonuses, the best being a two hour documentary on how "Dreamgirls" was developed from Broadway to film.<br /> "Dreamgirls" has so far made over 154 million dollars worldwide.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />When it's at its best Dreamgirls is an aggessive and engaging musical, but too often it slides into slow scenes and uninteresting songs (We are a family/like a shining tree) while focusing on characters like Curtis (played by a thoroughly bored looking Jamie Foxx) that the audience doesn't care as much about; Dreamgirls is a mixed bag but I suggest you pass.</p></br><a href="../users/A15TNUM2PBS6F0.html">A15TNUM2PBS6F0</a><br/><p>I finally watched "Dreamgirls" last weekend.  Mostly I wanted to see it because it had won an Oscar, or should I say Jennifer Hudson won the Oscar for Supporting Actress. What a performance!  To think she came from American Idol(and not the winner) and is such an amazing performer and actress.  The movie seemed like the perfect vehicle for her rev up her movie career.<br />"Dreamgirls" reminded me a bit of the story of The Supremes.  It is the 50's when it starts.  Three back up singers for Eddie Murphy's Jimmy "Thunder" Early, dance and sing their way up to the front of the stage.  Eventually they have their own girl group, The Dreams.  Curtis Taylor, Jr. played by Jamie Foxx, is the manager of the group.<br />Beyonce Knowles plays the main singer, Deena Jones, who gets all the attention that I felt Effie White, Jennifer Hudson's character, deserved.  I felt she got the shaft because she wasn't the imagine that they wanted for the group.  She was the most talented.  She knows it too, and eventually takes a bad turn away from the group.<br />"Dreamgirls" was a musical/play before it was a film and it transitioned well to onto the big screen.  It had some great songs and was set from the 50's to the 60's.  It's worth watching just to see Jennifer Hudson perform her Oscar winning performance.</p></br><a href="../users/A21XVS00AIENLX.html">A21XVS00AIENLX</a><br/><p>I do give props to Jennifer Hudson for her performance whose voice is very strong in this movie and carries Effie quite well.  I wouldn't have thought to nominate her for an Oscar, but she did well, and I'm glad she got it.  It wasn't because she is a brilliant actress, it was because for a girl who got kicked off American Idol, she had a brilliant voice that was finally revealed.  It is definitely Tony quality, but since it was in a movie, it's Oscar worthy.  Secondly, for a newcomer to acting, her enthusiasm was decent.  Dreamgirls is entertaining, dazzling, well-editted and well-put together.  But no wonder it didn't receive Best Picture.  It doesn't have the depth of Ray or the Grab-them-by-the-heart-strings sense that a Best Picture film should have.<br /><br />Despite not being nominated,  I though Beyonce, Jamie Foxx and Danny Glover did a great job as well.  This movie should have won at least for editting and costumes.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>While the Oscar snub was certainly shocking I can't say that it wasn't justified (not that the lineup for 2006 impressed me in the least).  `Dreamgirls', while probably one of the most entertaining films of the year, was far from the best.<br /><br />It delivers in many ways.  It's visually stunning, from the set pieces to the beautiful cast.  It's very easy on the ears.  The musical numbers (for the most part) are all brilliantly structured and add layers to the film.  In fact, the films biggest and key emotional scenes are in fact musical numbers.  Both `And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going' and `Listen' are the most emotionally connected scenes in the film for through music they convey the very feelings of the singer.  It also delivers, to an extent, in the acting department as well.  Eddie Murphy is fantastic as James "Thunder" Early and delivers a career best performance.  Beyonce Knowles shocked me with her delivery of Deena Jones and Anika Noni Rose beautifully captured the immaturity and naivety of Lorrel Robinson.  In fact everyone delivers decently here except for Jamie Foxx who was, without a doubt, miscast.<br /><br />Sadly, with all this delivery the film fails to deliver in the one area that matters the most; substance.  By the time the credits begin to roll `Dreamgirls' is nothing more than a fun time.  The characters, while superbly acted, lack any real depth and the film fails to evoke any real emotion in the audience.  With all the hype surrounding this film you'd expect to be really moved, really taken-a-back by it's magnitude but in the end it doesn't really do any of that.  One may be blinded by the glitz and glam upon a first viewing, as I was, but upon second and third viewings it becomes apparent that the film feels kind of empty, especially when the music has stopped.<br /><br />The film tells the story of aspiring musical act `The Dreamettes' who finally get their big break after aspiring music manager Curtis Taylor Jr. sees them perform in a talent show.  He persuades them to sing backup for R&B sensation James "Thunder" Early and thus their showbiz life begins.  The group suffers from internal struggles when lead singer Effie is pushed aside so the slimmer, more socially termed `pretty girl' Deena can sing lead vocals.  This seemingly small gesture drives a wedge in friendships and relationships, working and social, and creates a whirlwind of tragedy and in the end justice.<br /><br />Now, I left off one key element to the film for a reason...and that is the fact that arguably there was no bigger star in 2006 than the beautiful and talented Jennifer Hudson.  I don't necessarily agree with her Oscar win, but I was so happy for her because she delivered on all fronts and was so gracious with all the accolades she was receiving.  She handled herself like a true star, and that is commendable.  As Effie White she truly breathed life into this film and serves as one of the only actors here to actually flesh out her character.  With all the `lack of depth' found in `Dreamgirls' it is refreshing to see Jennifer grab a hold of Effie and make her real and relatable to the audience.  So I am here to tell you that Jennifer ain't goin nowhere, and that is a fact!<br /><br />So, the film is, like I said, extremely entertaining and a truly fun filled time.  Parts are corny (that whole "Steppin' to the Bad Side" part was dreadfully painful to watch) but as a whole it is just good ol' fun.  But that is it.  It is a fun film, but not a deep one and not one that deserved to win Oscars (aside from some technical, musical and acting recognition).  So, do I feel that the Oscar snub was truly a `snub'?  No, but I don't feel that that really takes away from the appeal and the good time that a film like `Dreamgirls' brings to the table.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>I deliberately waited until all the hype was done; all the awards were won, and until I was no longer tired of Beyonce to view "Dreamgirls." It is indeed an excellent presentation.<br /><br />This film is a roman &agrave; clef about the onset and heyday of Motown and in particular one of the most popular R&B groups, The Supremes. We witness their ascent to fame, the divisions between the manager's wants and public tastes and their struggle to remain in vogue in a changing world of popular music.<br /><br />Director of Chicago, another fantastic musical, wheels in a star cast fully showcasing the razzle-dazzle and enchantment of the songs and glittery costumes and wigs by bringing in "Dreamgirls" to the screen. This excellent Broadway production of the 80s put Jennifer Holiday on the map. Apart from top-notch production standards, wonderful costumes, fantastic music, and excellent performances all around, "Dreamgirls" is indeed another wonderful presentation of a slice of African-American life/culture.<br /><br />After watching this I didn't think it was much of a musical so I don't feel its right to compare this to `Chicago' excluding one major scene on stage. I thought all performances were equally fascinating. It's a shame Florence did not have the happy ending Effie did, but such is life. Jamie Foxx gave an understated performance which I found believable. Eddie Murphy also gave a great performance whose impact and appreciation may have been lost due to Eddie's past comedic roles where he basically did the same kind of voice and facial expressions he used here for the Character of Jimmy and I am so glad he got a chance to sing a few songs. I felt this was a strong performance by Eddie especially the scenes where he didn't say a word and his face said it all. It would have been nice to see him win the Academy Award. But there is no denying that Jennifer Hudson overshadows all these Hollywood heavies in this movie with her knockout performance as Effie White. She owns every scene she is in. The part given more meaning for those of us who saw her through the "Idol" drama where she was accused of not having the "Depth" to compete. Well, after I first heard her sing on Idol I too believed she did not belong there....She belonged in a higher place....her voice was a force of nature. Her talent was bigger than IDOL. The dream has really come true for this dreamgirl and I certainly understand the standing ovations it got in some theaters and friends of mine who went to see it in theaters I attest to that.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>I feel it incumbent to weigh in on the Oscar controversy surrounding "Dreamgirls".  Not having seen the film at the time the nominations were announced, I was taken aback nonetheless by it's shutout in the Best Picture category because of it's win at the Golden Globes and the pre-nomination forecasts.  Having now seen the film my feeling is it wouldn't have been out of place in the Best Picture category but 2006 was a strong year for pictures.  I can think off the top of my head three films that also could very well have been nominated("Blood Diamond", "Children of Men", "Pan's Labyrinth").  As far as Alan Arkin's upset of Eddie Murphy in the Supporting Actor category, well, the Academy got it right in my humble opinion.  For sure Murphy's account of James "Thunder" Early was an impressive piece of acting it brought to my mind Murphy's send-up of James Brown on "Saturday Night Live" 25 years ago.  I was more impressed with Murphy's work in "The Nutty Professor" in 1996 which he won a New York Film Critics Circle award for.  As for Jennifer Hudson, there should have been an inquest if she were denied the Best Supporting Actress award.  It's been years since an actress has come on the scene and dominated a picture like Hudson does here.  When she's not on screen, the energy level of the picture goes down slightly.  Her showstopper, "I'm Telling You I'm Not Going" should be listed as one of the classic moments of American film.  I remember when Hudson was on "American Idol" and she was criminally voted off early in the competition.  I think alot of it had to do with the unseemly harsh criticism directed at her by Simon Cowell.  Hudson maintained her dignity but was no shrinking violet in the face of these barbs.  My gut tells me that Hudson chanelled that experience into her performance here.  Jennifer got her revenge on Simon.  As for the film itself it's a better-than-average fictionalized account of the Supremes story.  Hudson's song aside, the music is good but not indelible.  What distinguishes the film is the superb ensemble acting.  Oddly enough, the underrated Danny Glover got scant mention in the film's reviews.  My guess is that he is so consistent that he tends to be overlooked.  If the film has a weakness I would have to say it's the film's ostensible star, Beyonce Knowles.  Knowles is extremely attractive and a very good singer but she leaves a little to be desired in the acting category.  The makers of the film, cognizant of this, cleverly tailored the film around Knowles' acting deficiencies.</p></br><a href="../users/A9I40WFF40R4.html">A9I40WFF40R4</a><br/><p>Okay. So it's not about the Supremes-- excuse me-- Diana Ross and the Supremes. Never mind that "Dreams" sounds a lot like "Supremes." Forget that the name "Deena" sounds terribly close to "Diana" or that Beyonce Knowles has an uncanny resemblance to Miss Ross and sounds like her. And the last song the women sing as a group has the same sentiment as "Some Day We'll Be Together."<br /><br />The story line is a little thin; the film gets off to a slow start but gathers a lot of momentum as it progresses. By the time Jennifer Hudson sings her incomparable rendition of "I Am Not Going," the most skeptical viewer is hooked. Besides Ms. Hudson's knockout performance, the other surprise for me was Eddie Murphy who in this film is not to be believed. He plays the character James Earley (a James Brown reflection?) with grit and passion and dominates the screen when he is on-- and he isn't a bad singer either.<br /><br />In the end it's all about the music. The production numbers are quite wonderful. It's worth whatever you paid to see this film to see and hear Jennifer Hudson. Finally the dedication to the late Michael Bennett, involved in the stage version, was touching.<br /><br />A film not to be missed.</p></br><a href="../users/A36RS7KTNOBROF.html">A36RS7KTNOBROF</a><br/><p>I really enjoyed this DVD,but I don't want to see it again.I did want to see "Lady sings the Blues"over and over again.I think Diana Ross should write her life story and bring it to the screen,with the GREAT music from the Motown area,now that would be a DREAM to see.</p></br><a href="../users/A9RNMO9MUSMTJ.html">A9RNMO9MUSMTJ</a><br/><p>Have you ever see Eddie Murphy act like that...wow, the man of many faces can also sing and does a great job with his character...but there is more here than just Eddie, we have the Dreamgirls who will enchant you with the several songs they present. The production and direction of this film is slick and things dont get boring too long. It is a musical, and they do sing a lot, so it helps to like music/musicals to really enjoy this film.

Well, it didn't deserve it.<br /><br />I saw the original Broadway cast and it was an amazing experience - so much more than had been managed on Broadway before.  It was excellent even without the showstopper song.  The music told the story more than the acting.<br /><br />In the movie, the music lost all the intensity it had on stage.  They wanted names - Beyonce, Jamie Foxx - fine, but their acting and vocals didn't bring the emotional impact of the originals.<br /><br />The only character that did was Effie.  Ms. Jennifer Hudson didn't try to copy Jennifer Holliday - who could.  She made it her own.  Her acting was the most believable in the film and when she sang - she SANG.  That girl spoke more emotion through the songs than all the other actors did throughout the entire film.  Her Oscar was mor than deserved and not only for AND I AM TELLING YOU.<br /><br />Otherwise, the adaption was a mess.  When thet sang the song FAMILY and then Jennifer and Jamie went outside arguing they were in the middle of the riots complete with gunshots.  How unrealistic.  if all this was happening outside would they have all just been sitting in the theatre.<br /><br />And on the stage, when the song DREAMGIRLS was performed, as the group transitioned, it was magical. You were lost in it.  It was such a let down in the film.  The vocals didn't make it soar and even the shooting, editing of it certainly lost an opportunity to shine.<br /><br />For me, this movie made me wish the stage magic could have been brought to film.  It was e reminder of a memory.  Beyonce was stiff and some of the worst acting by Jamie so far.<br /><br />I would give this film 3 stars as an ill fated attempt but Jennifer Hudson made the material shine and anyone who had a scene with her looked better.  When she sang you wanted to stand, clap and shout as if you were seeing it live.  Jennifer Hudson - for you - I AM TELLING YOU - I have to give the film 4 stars. You deserve a career with much opportunities.<br /><br />Jennifer - your beautiful, emotional voice has certainly touched me and made this film something I will watch over and over, just for you.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>"Dreamgirls" is a cinematic version of the Tony award-winning musical that had a 4-year run on Broadway in the 1980s. Inspired by 1960s R&B girl groups and the rise of Motown Records, the musical follows the personal trials and career triumphs of a trio called "The Dreams". By making subtle changes in the characters' circumstances, the movie associates The Dreams more closely with The Supremes than the stage musical did. Although it's easy to identify the movie's inspirations in the history of The Supremes, this is clearly a fictionalized account that has just enough real life to tantalize the audience. The film introduces some new songs but has less music than the stage production, as it's shorter.<br /><br />Three hopeful young women sing their way into the audience's hearts at a Detroit talent show, where they are spotted by Curtis Taylor (Jamie Foxx), an ambitious manager who thinks the ladies are just what aging R&B star Jimmy Early (Eddie Murphy) needs to revitalize his act. Curtis signs "The Dreamettes" as back up singers and sends them on tour. Determined to achieve success on the pop charts, Curtis makes them a stand-alone act, moving willful, talented Effie White (Jennifer Hudson) to backup role and replacing her with the pretty, slighter chanteuse Deena Jones (Beyonce Knowles), who, along with backup singer Lorrell Robinson (Anika Noni Rose), become "The Dreams". The act is a hit, but Effie's resentment and Curtis' stifling control breed behind-the-scenes strife.<br /><br />"Dreamgirls" is a slick, competent, thoroughly conventional musical that doesn't find its footing until about halfway through. The first hour is frankly dull. But the story becomes more compelling as it progresses and tensions between the characters heighten. I wasn't impressed by the singing. I would expect better on Broadway. But The Supremes were never strong singers, and the lovely Beyonce Knowles, who rose to stardom helming girl group Destiny's Child, is the perfect choice for Diana Ross-inspired Deena. Jennifer Hudson won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her Florence Ballard-inspired role. There is no subtlety in the performances, but if I had to choose a stand-out, it would be Eddie Murphy. In any case, there are enough showmanship and intriguing insinuations in "Dreamgirls" to satisfy.<br /><br />The DVD (Paramount 2007 single disc): Bonus features on the single disc include 12 Extended and Alternate Scenes, and a Music Video (4 min) for the song "Listen" performed by Beyonce Knowles. Subtitles for the movie are available in English and Spanish. Dubbing available in French.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDZNPO7U4E6N.html">A1CDZNPO7U4E6N</a><br/><p>I only have 2 names that come to mind when I think of this movie...Jennifer Hudson and Eddie Murphy, or should I say, "Effie White" and "Jimmy Early". Those 2 made this movie. Let me just start by saying that Beyonce' who plays "Deena Jones" may as well have played her real life story. A story about a woman with less talent and better looks being placed as lead singer in a group where the talent is in the back where the looks aren't as important. Not to say that Beyonce' isn't talented, but Destiny's Child fans know what I mean. Anyways, that's another review though. Really, this movie is really about achieving your dreams no matter the cost. It chronicles the rise and fall of a female group of friends from stardom to their downfall when appearances seem to matter much more than real talent does. My girl Jennifer Hudson proves that she not only has the vocal talent, but the girl can act too. An Oscar for her would be well deserved, as well as Eddie Murphy who makes you laugh one minute, and feel incredibly sorry for him the next. Needless to say, I loved everything about this movie, and if I could give it 10 I would.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZBOBV9H1HDV.html">A3LZBOBV9H1HDV</a><br/><p>"Dreamgirls" is excellent!

It's really great and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  I have known of the musical for years, but living in Australia, it's never come here and I've never seen that.  But whether you look at it as a movie version of the play or just as a stand alone movie, it's brilliant either way.<br /><br />The music is amazing.  All the singing is great.  The costumes and make-up and hair are great and the acting is superb.  Beyonce does a good job, and while Eddie Murphy is great, I almost thought Jamie Foxx was better.  Danny Glover is fantastic, Anika Noni Rose shines but the true brilliant acting does come from Jennifer Hudson.  She deserves the Oscar for sure.  Look out for good cameos like Jaleel White (Urkel) and Loretta Devine.  Sharon Leal (Boston Public) stars as the 'third' member after Effie leaves.<br /><br />The resemblences in the movie to real life are there - there is a group in some scenes who are just like the Jackson 5, and some of the looks that Beyonce had are so similar to Diana Ross.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this movie highly enough - especially if you love the sounds of Motown and further into disco also.  I cannot wait for this to come to DVD.  I just hope they don't run short on copies because everyone will want to snatch this up as soon as it's released too.

Many feel forced as the cast breaks out into song at the most bizarre of times. Cheesy is perhaps the best descriptor, but occasionally I enjoy a good toe-tapping flick if it's done right. And DREAMGIRLS is definitely done right. It certainly ranks up there with MOULIN ROUGE and CHICAGO as one of the more recently successful musical films, it too being a period piece (covering the late 50s through the early 70s).<br /><br />Acting in these style of films tends to lend itself more to dance moves than actual roleplaying of characters, but there are two highly mentionable performances in Dreamgirls: first time actress Jennifer Hudson of American Idol fame, and a major comeback role for Eddie Murphy. Hudson took home Best Actress trophies from The Golden Globes, The BAFTAs, The Screen Actors Guild and The Oscars for her portrayal of Effie White, the powerful and ultimately embittered lead singer for The Dreamettes. Eddie Murphy as James "Thunder" Early is surprisingly excellent, perhaps helping wash away the stains of DADDY DAYCARE and THE ADVENTURES OF PLUTO NASH from his more recent, acting, downward spiral. Murphy can sing alongside Hudson and Beyonce and hold his own, too.<br /><br />The added entertaining fact about Dreamgirls is that there's an actual story behind the music, making this film much more watchable than many musicals which rely solely on their high notes rather than acting skill. This story is firmly entrenched in the early music industry as a "white-washed" form of entertainment, separating it from "black music"...until Curtis Taylor (Jamie Foxx, JARHEAD), a car salesman in search of more, jumps into the music biz and launches his own record label (Rainbow Records). Foxx's Taylor character is another smashing success for him in that he makes this man both lovable and despised as he turns from caring manager to control freak.<br /><br />Likewise, Murphy's Early character is someone who's moral ground we're never quite sure of. He's a married man with womanizing tendencies, but he's also a musical purist, trying to create sounds that are true to him while at the same time dismantling what he once was (a great, yet small, singing sensation). His fall from grace hits the viewer hard as heroin, time, and his own industry begin taking their toll.<br /><br />But veterans Murphy and Foxx can't hold a candle to newcomer Hudson's performance. She is the crux that holds the entire production together, and she does so with power, grace and a great emotional range. The ending is sure to choke-up many viewers.<br /><br />The only complaint I can lodge against the entire film was within one small section where Effie (Hudson) breaks out into a long chorus about being wronged by Foxx and the other Dreamettes. This seemed rather awkward and I would've liked to have seen this acted out in dialogue rather than burst into song.<br /><br />Still, this is a powerful musical film that deserves much praise ...and has rightfully gotten it.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>"Dreamgirls," originally a hit Broadway production in the 1980s, is a lavish musical inspired by the history of Motown and its super group The Supremes. Like the songs in "Grace of My Heart" which is clearly based on the career of Carole King, the soundtrack music of "Dreamgirls," good as it is, can't match the power of the real Motown sound. Actually the film's musical numbers hardly sound like Motown Sound, but still some of them are real showstoppers thanks to the film's gifted stars, especially the dynamic singing voice of Oscar-winner Jennifer Hudson.<br /><br />In "Dreamgirls" you should not expect much from the story, which runs a familiar course of superstars or celebrities, with the meteoric rise of three R&B singers (played by Beyonc&eacute; Knowles, Jennifer Hudson and Anika Noni Rose) to the fame and their subsequent troubles and ego-clashing within the members and their shrewd, business-minded producer/manager (Jamie Foxx). It is a same old story you have heard somewhere else in gossip magazines. .<br /><br />Once the three girls' dreams come true with the glitter of showbiz, it takes the center of their lives, and once it does, none of the characters are allowed to breathe much. Anika Noni Rose and Danny Glover are not given enough time for their characters, and even the role of Beyonc&eacute; Knowles is not fleshed out satisfactorily. Eddie Murphy is outstanding as a popular singer and ladies' man named James "Thunder" Early (with a haircut like Little Richard's), but there is nothing new in Thunder's story about his love affair and fading stardom.<br /><br />Still I enjoyed watching "Dreamgirls". I know it has lots of shortcomings, and I hear the complaints from the fans of the original stage (which I haven't seen). Yes, I know. Perhaps the number of the film's shortcomings depends on each viewer's taste or expectations, and I liked the filmed version of "Dreamgirls" for what it is. I like it for its entertainment values such as gorgeous costumes, beautifully staged live scenes and cinematography, plus the powerful, emotionally-charged songs by Jennifer Hudson, all of which compensate for the lack of a better story.</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>Firstly I really enjoyed the musical numbers from every character.  The loose story of the Supremes, I mean Dreams is fairly entertaining but not as engrossing as I would have hoped.  I found I didn't really care that much about any of the characters.  I especially didn't like the Hudson character Effie.  I was hoping for her fall since her first minute on screen.  She has a nice voice, but I couldn't stand her character.  I guess I was hoping this would play less like a broadway show and go deeper into the characters like a movie.  As it jumped forward in time, often I was hoping it would slow down a bit to see the transformation that every character seem to go through.  This is worth seeing if only for the great music.</p></br><a href="../users/AZCDCO6KK2T81.html">AZCDCO6KK2T81</a><br/><p>This film belongs to Hudson and Murphy who are both far more talented than most ever expected.<br /><br />I knew Jennifer Hudson could sing from her stint on American Ido, but I had no idea that was an actress too and I mean a top quality actress capable of pulling off an Academy Award in her very first film.  It's my sincere hope that we will see much more of her in the future even if the roles don't include music.  Hudson is simply an acting find and a visual delight to behold on the screen.  She is a charming as she is talented.<br /><br />Eddie Murphy's performance is as much high energy, flamboyant, and satrical as it is subtle, emotional and insightful.  I was floored by his flawless performance in this film and found it a terrible shame that he followed this dynamic performance with the totally distasteful <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000PATZK6">Norbit</a> which was released just prior to the Academy Awards and in which some believe cost him the Oscar.<br /><br />Members of the Academy are well-known for voting out an actor or actress based upon his or her personality as was the case with Madonna who gave an Oscar-caliber performance in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6304806418">Evita</a>, but was shunned because she was . . . well . . . Madonna, and for voting out an actor or actress based upon a poor follow-up film released the same year and don't want to reward what they may consider a "fluke" performance as with Whoppie Goldberg in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000084326">The Color Purple</a> (thankfully she finally got her well-deserved Oscar for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000059TEP">Ghost</a>) years later.<br /><br />I believe Murphy really blew his Oscar chances for this film because of "Norbit" and that isn't fair, but it was predictable based on past Academy voting tendencies.  I generally believe in not holding things against a performer or a specific performance, but I have to admit that even I have moments of extreme bias, like anyone else, so I can understand how that happens.  This may have been Murphy's only real good shot at an Oscar, but we can always hope that he will be given another juicy role like this one to strut his considerable talents.<br /><br />Beyonce Knowles is no great actress, but she has terrific stage/screen presence that more than compensates for anything that she is lacking in genuine acting talent.  To her credit, I actually had trouble recognizing her early in the film.  I even asked my wife, "Where the hell is Beyonce?  I thought she had a big role in this film."  My wife then pointed her out and I was rather surprised at how well she disappeared into her role.  However, the more I thought about it the more I thought she didn't just "disappear" in what started out as a supporting role, but was simply more out shined and out-acted by Jennifer Hudson.  I don't mean that as an insult to Beyonce or her acting talent as she does have acting talent, but when surrounded by more genuine talent her limitations are clear no matter how beautiful she is, or how gifted she is as a singer, or how engaging she is generally as a stage performer.<br /><br />Moving on to Jamie Foxx I have to say that I was somewhat disappointed with his performance in the film.  I can't pinpoint the problem, but I just feel that he felt somewhat out of his league amongst these great female performers.  His performance was simply below what he is capable of delivering, but that doesn't mean he was awful or miscast; he just wasn't at his best.<br /><br />Now, one might question that with all this talent in the film why so many on here haven't given it 5 stars.  I think the problem with this film is with the director.  The film seems disjointed somehow.  The editing isn't very smooth, transitions are weak, and the lack of focus on just who the "stars" are in the film creates an uneven film that works better in clips.  In other words, the sum of the parts don't equal the whole.  That may explain why so many "liked" the film, but didn't "love" it.  It goes down smooth enough, but it never became what it could have become and that feeling is usually the fault of the director.<br /><br />Overall, this is a fun and entertaining musical with some strong, dynamic performances, but still somewhat weak for this genre.</p></br><a href="../users/A33CLVW2K7SL1P.html">A33CLVW2K7SL1P</a><br/><p>During Jennifer Hudson's first song (I don't remember which song that was), I turned to my friend and whispered, "This girl lost?" I was, of course, referring to American Idol. For those who don't know this, in an interesting reversal of fortunes, Jennifer Hudson beat out former American Idol winner Fantasia for the role. And now, she's nominated for a Golden Globe, and has already snagged eleven awards (see imdb). Talk about life imitating art.<br /><br />Translating a Broadway smash to the screen is never easy, but this seemed seamless, and the other cast members, specifically Beyonce, Eddie Murphy, and Jamie Foxx, lent the film extraordinary believability.<br /><br />I generally don't enjoy musicals, but listening to Jennifer Hudson sing was absolutely a revelation.</p></br><a href="../users/A29QA79VLQGHY6.html">A29QA79VLQGHY6</a><br/><p>Paramount just announced "Dreamgirls" for May 1, the campaign starring a double-disc "Showstopper Edition" with a glitzy package of extras. The title also is coming out with in two-DVD sets for both HD formats (unusual) and a single-disc DVD version with some deleted scenes.<br /><br />The box art mentions Jennifer Hudson's Oscar, but the big type goes to the film's Golden Globe for best picture. Smart marketing since the movie didn't make the cut to get into the Academy Awards' best pic race.<br /><br />Par promises "12 extended and alternate scenes including a DVD-exclusive, never-before-seen performance by Jennifer Hudson of 'Effie Sing My Song,' a feature-length documentary entitled 'Building the Dream' presented in nine chapters, behind-the-scenes featurettes on the costume design, editing and lighting of the film, cast member auditions and screen tests, previsualization sequences and more."

Sorry, audio buffs, no DTS. It's a real shame to see a musical this rich come out without the superior audio format. Perhaps the HD formats will get to show off their superior sound abilities, an upgrade that by and large we're still waiting to experience. Guy can dream, right?</p></br><a href="../users/A359IT81FBX64Y.html">A359IT81FBX64Y</a><br/><p>I understand that this movie was "based" on groups like The Supremes and it was not intended to be a bio, but still I was disappointed at how little The Dreams resembled their inspiration. Yes, the glamour was there, but the music, which was fine, did not evoke The Supremes or even Motown.<br /><br />Beyonce, as Deena, plays the role of lead singer Diana Ross, but her role, both as a character and as a singer, is surprisingly weak in this film. Jennifer Hudson, as Effie, is supposed to represent Florence Ballard, and it is her character and singing that drive the movie. Effie's brother C.C. is the songwriter for the group, cranking out one hit after another.<br /><br />I didn't see the stage version of Dreamgirls. In the movie I felt confused about the firing and subsequent alienation of Effie. Deena began sleeping with Effie's fiance, Curtis (Jamie Foxx), the group's manager. Effie was missing rehearsals, arriving late, and "making trouble" due to "medical problems" (we find out later that she was pregnant by Curtis), so the entire group, who called themselves a "family," fires Effie and pretty much tell her to get lost. For the next five years or so, while The Dreams go on to great success, Effie is a single mom on welfare, and not even Effie's brother knows that she has a kid. Then, when Effie suddenly comes back into the music scene, her brother tells her that he has written a sure-fire hit song for her that only she can sing, as if the last five cruel years hadn't happened! And suddenly all the bad things that happened to Effie were the fault of Curtis, not anyone else. What? During the final song, with Effie joining The Dreams once again, there is an odd scene with Curtis standing in the aisle staring, perplexed, at the daughter he didn't know he had. Likewise I felt confused about the character of Curtis. I know that larger-than-life people can be complex and both good and bad, but in this movie it was hard to figure out which was which. Near the end of the movie Curtis steals a song that he has no reason to steal, and then he is blackmailed into giving it back. Very strange!<br /><br />The nicest surprise of this film, and the character who most evoked Motown, was Eddie Murphy as the irrepressible soul singer Jimmy Early. I felt another brief and funny nostalgic moment during a glimpse of a Jackson Five-like group. Sometimes this film went into operatic mode, with sung dialogue and arguments, which I enjoyed.</p></br><a href="../users/A1P6NRWDD1NT4B.html">A1P6NRWDD1NT4B</a><br/><p>The recommendation for DREAMGIRLS is based on the performances of all the leads especially Eddie Murphy, Jennifer Hudson (who won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar), and Beyone Knowles. A film which is loosely based on the Motown Story and particularly the group The Supremes. This reviewer enjoyed the film, however, it is one of those films where one viewing is enough and would not want to see again. The production values and direction are excellent along with the music and their set pieces are first rate.  However, the story is predictable following a template of a typical rock'n'roll rags to riches to break-up plotline.  The audience can predict what is going to happen after each scene in the film and what characters are going to do what. Eddie Murphy should have won the Best Supporting actor in the film instead of Alan Arkin's performance in LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE. However, perhaps the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences was in a way gave it to Alan Arkin because of his past work (and he is getting on in his years).  Also, Eddie Murphy released NORBIT during the voting period of the Academy Awards and everyone forgot about his performance in this film. Overall, a good film which warrants only one viewing and then put it on the shelf as a museum piece.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IOJE0W1NXOSE.html">A1IOJE0W1NXOSE</a><br/><p>I don't know if it's because I grew up in Michigan during the 60's or what, but from the first note from the "Dreamettes", I was hooked!  This movie has great music, wonderful performances, and tremendous energy.  It's the story of a trio of young women from Detroit and how they made it to the big time.  It tells of their days as backup singers for James Early (Eddie Murphy) to their promotion as a group by manager Curtis Taylor (Jamie Foxx).  It chronicles them falling in and out of love with self-centered, ambitious men who are only looking out for themselves.  When Jennifer Hudson sings "And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going" the world stands still and the viewer feels all the pain of a young woman being betrayed in her love life and her career.  This is a fast-paced, totally absorbing movie and I highly recommend it!</p></br><a href="../users/A1IKOYZVFHO1XP.html">A1IKOYZVFHO1XP</a><br/><p>The DREAMGIRLS rock the stage especially Jennifer Hudson,who rose to fame on AMERICAN IDOL and rose even higher in this film. Great moral support from Hollywood veterans Eddie Murphy and Danny Glover. This film was based on the Broadway play which debuted back in 1981. My earliest memory of DREAMGIRLS was the play,when I was a high school freshman back in 1985-86,I remember three black female students from my chorus class,rehearsed several numbers and performed them in either our Christmas concert or Spring concert. If you love soul music,you'll love this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2XRZV63X79YSJ.html">A2XRZV63X79YSJ</a><br/><p>I saw the orginal Los Angeles production with Jennifer Holliday.  It was rightfully described as a living film.  Every scene flowed into the next, no blackouts.  Add to that a brilliant book and score with sets, costumes and lighting to match, you have an incredible experience.<br /><br />When I heard that Bill Condon (who adapted the screenplay of Chicago)was writing and directing, I was happy.  Too many musical transfers have been ruined by putting them in the hands of directors who have never had any musical experience (John Huston & Annie and Richard Attenburough & A Chrous Line). But unfortunately, it just proves how great a director Rob Marshall is.<br /><br />Dreamgirls is about family, fame and how the American public rewards beauty over talent.  The film forgets this and trys to be about the Motown experience and doesn't accomplish this.<br /><br />The Dreamette are three friends that dream of fame as a girl group.  Effie is the lead singer of the group and her brother CC writes the songs.  The girls go to a local talent competition and meet promoter Curtis Taylor. He immediately sees the girl's potential.  To get them started he makes them the back up singer for fading star James "Thunder" Early.<br /><br />When it is time for the Dreamettes to breakaway to become The Dreams, Curtis moves the beautiful Deena to be the lead and makes the more talented Effie step to backup.  This creates an on going conflict between the two divas.<br /><br />Eventually, Effie is replaced and the Dreams becomes supertars.  Effie eventually rebuilds her career with the help of her old manager. (To me the best moment is Jennifer singing "I'm Changing")  CC eventually realizes that Curtis only concern is the bottom line and goes back to Effie to help her comeback.<br /><br />This sets up a final battle between Effie and Curtis when Curtis wants CC's new song for The Dreams to lauch Disco.  This leads to the great scene where CC puts it all on the line.  In the end, everyone sees Curtis for what he is and all the Dreams reunite for one last time.<br /><br />Add to this basic storyline, riots, assinations, and drugs and you have the movie.<br /><br />Part of the problem is that Condon wanted to make this an issue film instead a of a slice of entertainment history.  The other problem is that he does not trust the musical forum.<br /><br />There are a number of occasions where he omitted the intro of a song (sometimes he would use the lyrics spoken!) and other times use the intro??  The best example is in Cadillac Car.  In  the musical, the intro to the song talks about how different groups of used ownership of Cadillac Cars to prove that they were equal to the White upper class.<br /><br />People say that musicals are impractical because people don't break out in song in real life. Well 90% of all films have characters doing improbable things. But most people will see a film if it is done well, people don't care!<br /><br />One final thing is that Condon reduced all characters to supporting roles there were really no leading performaces, this is a ensemble movie.  (I don't really know if this is a positive or negative.)<br /><br />When Ann Reinking revived Chicago, I told people that if they never saw Bob Fosse's original production with Chita, Gwen and Jerry, then see the new show and you will love it. But if you had, don't expect the new production to be as good.  That is what I say of this film.  You will still like the film but the stage production was definitely superior.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>Two things came to mind immediately after viewing "Dreamgirls", the new film based on the Broadway play starring Jamie Foxx, Beyonce' Knowles, Eddie Murphy and Jennifer Hudson.<br /><br />1. This is a good film getting too much hype.<br /><br />2. Eddie Murphy deserves an Academy Award nomination.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong. "Dreamgirls" is a good film. It moves fast, entertains, is filled with good music and a couple of good performances. But it is not a great film. Because of all of the hype, people will go to see this film expecting to be blown away. When what they actually experience is only a `good' film, they will feel let down. If people went in with lower expectations, they would probably enjoy the film more.<br /><br />Eddie Murphy plays James "Thunder" Early, a `James Brown'-esque singer. Now, you may think, as I did "Wow, he's just going to use the impersonation he did so well during his years on `Saturday Night Live'." But the role is so much more than that and Murphy is able to show the true range of his acting ability.<br /><br />In case you have been living in a cave: "Dreamgirls" is a fictionalized look at the early career of Diana Ross and the Supremes. The Dreamettes, a local girl group from Detroit, enters a talent contest and catches the eye of Curtis (Jamie Foxx), a used car salesman desperate to become a music producer. He watches the group led by Effie (Jennifer Hudson), backed by Deena (Beyonce Knowles) and Lorrell (Anika Noni Rose), sing up a storm and bring the crowd to their feet. Some quick negotiations with Early's manager (Danny Glover) lead to a gig singing backup for the famous musician. Now, Curtis needs to introduce himself to the Dreamettes. After helping Early become a bigger, breakout star, Curtis decides to let the Dreams tour on their own. But he wants Deena to front the group, shocking everyone including Effie, Curtis' girlfriend. Everyone agrees, for the good of the group. As the Dreams become more famous, Effie becomes more resentful and eventually parts ways with the group. Curtis has no trouble finding a replacement and the group soon becomes `Deena and the Dreams'. Curtis has even bigger dreams; a record label, movies, television. And he will do anything to get there. Deena begins to notice some of these bad things and starts to look for a way out.<br /><br />Written and directed by Bill Condon ("Gods and Monsters", "Kinsey") and adapted from the play by Michael Bennett, "Dreamgirls" is an old-fashioned Hollywood musical. It is nice to see this and see a good example of the genre. But this film would never have happened without the success of "Moulin Rouge" and "Chicago".<br /><br />Condon, who helped adopt "Chicago" for the big screen, has done a good job of integrating musical numbers into the story. This is the type of musical where the characters spontaneously burst into song, which become extensions of the character's dialogue, making the transition virtually seamless. I have never seen the play, but I was surprised by the lack of choreographed dancers. There are only two points when songs are accompanied by old fashioned production numbers including choreographed dancers, and these are fun to watch. But the majority of the songs are performed by one person or a small group.<br /><br />I was also surprised by how much of the story of the Supremes is "borrowed" for the film. From what I know, they follow the story pretty faithfully, changing names and places, until the end. The ending is significantly changed and I am not sure why as it robs the film of a lot of dramatic potential.<br /><br />Condon does a great job of bringing together all of the production elements to successfully evoke the periods of the film. As the Dreams rise through the ranks, they play the fancy nightclubs of the 50s up through the discos of the 70s. As their fortunes rise, the d&eacute;cor of their personal surroundings becomes more and more elaborate and help evoke the taste of the era.<br /><br />Jamie Foxx plays Curtis, the Berry Gordy-like Svengali who attaches himself to Deena and the Dreams and strives to help them achieve fame. Foxx's performance is one note and lackluster. The character's obsession is aided by this same one note nature, showing another example of his drive, but Foxx delivers practically every line in the same voice, showing little, if any emotion. A couple of times Curtis is seen staring at Deena and Effie, looking through them, in an effort to show his feelings towards them. Even towards the end, when things start to crumble, he shows little emotion.<br /><br />Beyonce Knowles can sing, but she is a weak actress. She is better suited to small roles in films like "Austin Powers" and "The Pink Panther", films that allow her to speak as little dialogue as possible and use her required music video to provide promotion on MTV. She simply isn't a good enough actress to make Deena a real person. It also doesn't help that Deena is made such an understanding and nice person. She supports Effie and doesn't want to lead the group, she has to be persuaded. Because the film makes her so saintly, she never has an opportunity to show any dramatic force.<br /><br />Eddie Murphy's performance as James "Thunder" Early is the best and most interesting in the film. As a well-known singer, he is also a well-known womanizer and agrees to let the Dreams do backup because he is interested in Lorrell (Leal), the youngest member of the group. Murphy brilliantly brings this character trait to life. As soon as they hit the road, he begins the seduction and quickly realizes it will take a little longer than planned. Over the course of the film, Early changes, grows and regresses along with the rest of the industry. Murphy makes all of these character changes, good and bad, believable and real.<br /><br />This is something I never thought I would say but Eddie Murphy deserves an Academy Award nomination for the role.<br /><br />Jennifer Hudson plays Effie, the discarded member of the group, the fourth Dream. Her character is the best singer and her story is the most dramatic, so she naturally comes across as more interesting than Deena. Hudson does a very good job of showing Effie's talent, struggles and triumphs. Her show stopper number "I Will Tell You I Am Not Going" is also the most powerful and memorable song in the film. Because her performance is so good, it makes Beyonce's performance seem all the more weak. If you are a well-known performer and play the weaker member of the group, you need to be able to make the role resonate. Beyonce doesn't do that and every time Hudson appears on screen, we are reminded of that.<br /><br />Think about it. Beyonce is playing the self-acknowledged weaker singer of the group and the best song is performed by the best singer in the group. How does this help Beyonce exactly? Hudson wipes up the floor with her.<br /><br />"Dreamgirls", despite the problems, is a fun film to watch.</p></br><a href="../users/A32XK1ZCXM66OT.html">A32XK1ZCXM66OT</a><br/><p>Wow, this was a great movie. I mean, when I went to see it. I thought that I wasn't going to like it. But trust me, you will like this film. The music was just fantastic!!! Jennifer Husdon just stole the show. Eddie Murphy, Beyonce and Jamie Foxx were in fine form too. But, it was Jennifer Husdon who dominated this film. A truly great movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1SPB225CVTRUU.html">A1SPB225CVTRUU</a><br/><p>Dreamgirls is a certainly highly-entertaining, and it's not a entirely a musical, because there is more talking than singing of the dialogues. It's a fast-paced ala biopic of The Supremes. It's a good story about friendship, trust, and faith between the three/four dream girls through the years. I personally like Eddie Murphy the most because his performance is simply sassy and funny, and at the same time there was emotion to the more dramatic moments at his character's downfall. Jamie Foxx is very convincing as a no-good all manipulative manager. I find that while there is plenty of singing photo shoots scenes for Beyonce to work with and she was fabulous in them, I was craving for more dramatic scenes for her character. Considered that she's not a singer turned actress, and it's her first starring role, she did struck gold. However it's Jennifer Hudson the less attractive of the dream girls who had the juiciest and scene-stealing part to work with. As a newcomer, she was best when she gets to sing her emotions out. A very strong moment was when she gets to do that number called I am Telling You I am Not Going. I have a feeling either Murphy or her will get an Oscar nod in the supporting category. Perhaps the costumes will get a nominations too.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>I can honestly say that I have never been in a theater where so many people were cheering and whistling and giving shout-outs to the actors in my life, and while at times it was entertaining in itself, and at one point down right comical, I've decided that I never want to sit through that again.  I'm the type of guy that likes to watch my movies in silence, so I can get everything the first time and not have to watch it again because I missed a whole scene because the idiot in front of me decided to get out his lighter (serious, that happened).  THAT aside, `Dreamgirls' was a great experience.  While not as great as the hype would suggest, I've learned that to almost always be true and thus forgo the hype when walking through the cinema doors.<br /><br />`Dreamgirls' chronicles the careers of Supremes knockoffs `The Dreams', Lorrell (Anika Noni Rose), Deena (Beyonce Knowles) and Effie (Jennifer Hudson).  Singing together for years they have strived to make it to the top, and one night after singing in a competition and catching the ear of aspiring producer Curtis Taylor (Jamie Foxx) they get their big break singing backup for superstar James `Thunder' Early (Eddie Murphy).  Effie immediately stands out as the backbone and spokesperson of the group, giving Curtis a hard time about the mere fact they are singing backup.  Her persistence both pays off and in a way breaks her down as Curtis decides to make them stars, moving Deena to the front of the band and in a way moving Effie out completely.<br /><br />The movie succeeds to sheer brilliance when its female costars are acting through song, Hudson earning her soon to be Oscar with her gut wrenching `And I'm Telling You I'm Not Going' while Beyonce blew me away with her equally powerful `Listen' which gave me Goosebumps.  The film has everything going for it, and while it's not perfect, it's not too far off either.  I still feel that some past musicals (`Chicago' & `Moulin Rouge' come to mind) are better films, but what makes `Dreamgirls' so outstanding is that they got the feeling, the singing and the actins spot on.  Unlike say `Chicago', `Dreamgirls' doesn't have ONE bad note in the singing department.<br /><br />This film is one of the better cast films I've ever seen, every acting playing their role to perfection.  Eddie Murphy gave a career best here, Beyonce underplayed splendidly (it was nice to see her not try to be the center of attention, and so for me in a lot of ways she stood out), Anika Noni Rose does wonderfully as the na?ve member of the group, Danny Glover is great here as is Keith Robinson, and while I'm not a Foxx fan I will admit that he fit nicly here.  The real star though was newcomer Jennifer Hudson who can not only sing circles around the rest of the cast but is such a talented actress, and for her first role, I mean come on.  If you can't se the talent then you're utterly blind.</p></br><a href="../users/A18G7GG53G2X8A.html">A18G7GG53G2X8A</a><br/><p>I'm sure that "Dreamgirls" will rank with some of the more famous musical play adaptations, and rightfully so; not only is it a thoroughly entertaining film, it's also incredibly well made, from the performances to the costumes to the overall look. We have writer/director Bill Condon--who penned the screenplay to 2002's "Chicago"--to thank for this adaptation of the original Broadway musical. Here's a film that's truly alive, with vibrant colors, energetic, soulful music, and singing voices that definitely do justice to the material. I can't say whether or not these qualities will result in a successful movie; over the past a couple of years, a number of well-made musical films were overlooked or flatly rejected ("The Phantom of the Opera," "Rent," and "The Producers" come to mind). Here's hoping for some recognition.<br /><br />I say this because, within the scope of the narrative, "Dreamgirls" is a winner, from the very first frame to the last. Never once did it seem as if something was lacking or improperly handled; everything felt absolutely right. There are a number of possible factors: good casting; decent script; a simple yet significant story; a gathering of exciting, show stopping musical numbers. This film has it all, and it's sure to completely satisfy those in need of Broadway experience outside of Broadway. I'm afraid I can't say how faithful this film adaptation is to the original play, nor can I speculate on how accurately it portrays the real life story of The Supremes. What I can say is that this film is able to stand on its own, and making comparisons to different material is unnecessary.<br /><br />The basic plot is about three singers and their whirlwind journey through music superstardom. Beginning in mid-1960s Detroit, Deena Jones (Beyonce Knowles), Lorrell Robinson (Anika Noni Rose), and Effie Melody White (Jennifer Hudson) are part of a struggling girl band called The Dreamettes. They're about ready to give up because they've been together a number of years without having gotten a break. But then they meet Curtis Taylor, Jr. (Jamie Foxx), a smooth talking music producer/used car salesman (which already should be indicative of an interesting journey). He offers them the chance to sing backup for James "Thunder" Early (Eddie Murphy), both locally and while he's on tour. Naturally, the girls accept (although Effie needed a little more convincing than the other two).<br /><br />Meeting Early is like hitting a brick wall, for both the girls and the audience. He's not charming, but he sure is magnetic, a trait that barely surpasses his wild onstage persona and offstage arrogance. Even his manager, Marty Madison (Danny Glover), isn't in a position of control; Early will only do what he wants to do. I got the sense that Murphy put everything he had into this role, which is good because it resulted in one of his best, most memorable performances. The same can be said for Knowles, who at last has been given the chance to show some acting talent (which couldn't have been said for films like "Austin Powers in Goldmember" or "The Pink Panther"). She gives Deena a sweet yet determined demeanor, fueled by the desire to sing. Her desire only gets stronger as the national tour becomes successful and recording offers are made.<br /><br />Deena and Lorrell begin the film as backup singers for Effie, who clearly has the more dominant voice (and Jennifer Hudson certainly lets us know this; just try to keep your hands apart after her renditions of "And I'm Telling You I'm Not Going" and "Love You I Do"). But as the three drift apart from Early and begin their own act, Taylor insists that Deena become the lead singer. Understandably, Effie isn't happy about this. Thus begins the first of many ups and downs the girls will have to endure, not helped by the fact that Effie and Taylor are romantically involved. Everyone begins to feel as if Effie is too demanding, too outspoken, and too inflexible for the good of the group. After much offstage squabbling, she's unceremoniously replaced by Michelle Morris (Sharon Leal).<br /><br />The story then stretches out for about eight years, bringing the story into the 1970s. Many things happen during that time, both good and bad: Deena and Taylor get married; Lorrell and Early continue a love affair; many new albums are recorded; Deena is signed on to play Cleopatra; and Effie struggles to revive her career, a situation made worse by the fact that she's now a single mother. We also witness the growing tension between Taylor and songwriter Clarence Conrad "C.C." White (Keith Robinson), Effie's brother. For years, C.C.'s songs--sung by Early and The Dreams--were subject to heavy revisions, both in terms of the music and lyrics. From Taylor's point of view, it's strictly a matter of business; songs have to be a certain way if they're to make an album sell. But from C.C.'s point of view, the integrity of his work is suffering. None of this is helped by the fact that he and Effie haven't spoken in a couple of years (C.C. supported the rest of the group instead of her).<br /><br />All the human drama prevents the film from losing itself; it's not too bright and bubbly, but it's not too melodramatic, either. This very easily could have turned into a hollow story, something that was all glitz but no substance. A real story is being told here, one that would work even if it weren't told in the language of song. I also appreciated how it plausibly portrays the roller coaster ride that fame is; we're not spared the reality that celebrities can crash and burn much more easily than they can climb to the top. Such ingredients made for one of the year's most entertaining films, one that ends just as strongly as it begins. I can't say whether or not everything turns out okay for The Dreams (assuming you've never seen the play), but I guarantee you that finding out will be a thoroughly enjoyable experience.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KJ6JAZPH382D.html">A3KJ6JAZPH382D</a><br/><p>This is a great big blast of glitter and glitz, fun and entertaining. For those who haven't heard the plot a million times already, I'll recap. The Dreamettes, fronted by belter Effie (Jenifer Hudson, totally earning that Oscar) catch a lucky break and start working as singers for a fading James "Thunder" Early (Eddie Murphy, a revelation as a mash-up of sixties soul singers from Wilson Picket to James Brown to Marvin Gaye). The ersatz Berry Gordy character Curtis Taylor Jr (a lackluster Jamie Foxx) decides to move the less powerful but prettier Deena Jones (Beyonce, giving an eerie Diana Ross impersonation) to the front of the newly christened Dreams. As the sixties and seventies cascade about them, the conflict between these four drives the movie and the music.<br /><br />Fortunately for "Dreamgirls," the musical performances carry the day. I don't find many of the songs here to be all that memorable - other than "One Night Only" and "Cadillac Car," I have a hard time humming any of these once the DVD is over. But to see Hudson bring the house down with her version of the original centerpiece "And I'm Telling You Now I'm Not Going" is an astonishing career-maker of a scene, and Murphy steals the show just about every number he does. (As for all the Theatre Snobs decrying Hudson Vs Holliday, did you ever stop to think about how few people actually SAW the play with Holliday in it? Like, over 20 years ago? It's like saying the current stage play of "Mary Poppins" will never be right because Julie Andrews isn't in it.)<br /><br />THAT grouse aside, "Dreamgirls" is not without its flaws. As previously stated, Jamie Foxx seems miscast here. While Murphy is brilliant, the wide range of styles he's run through (from James Brown bark to Marvin Gaye 'message song' croon) seems unwieldy for the character. Anika Noni Rose is bubbly and fun, but gets little by way of memorable scenes. With those out of the way, I still enjoyed this. Watch for the cameos from John Lithgow and Loretta Devine (Lorrell Robinson in the original Broadway production) as the jazz singer in the wake scene.<br /><br />I am happy to see "Dreamgirls" as the success it's become. It gives me hope that the Movie Musical genre that has been given shots in the arm via "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005QZ7U">Moulin Rouge! (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)</a>," "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JLSE">Chicago (Widescreen Edition)</a>" and - to a lesser extent - "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E1YVZU">Rent (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>" will be given an ongoing forum.</p></br><a href="../users/A39AWL2FKWDFK6.html">A39AWL2FKWDFK6</a><br/><p>The super hyped "Dreamgirls" a musical based on the evolution of the Detroit Motown sound focusing on a group modeled after The Supremes. absolutely delivers.  The group first called The Dreamettes and later The Dreams was composed of Deena Jones patterned after Diana Ross played by Beyonce Knowles, Lorrell Robinson played by Anika Noni Rose as Mary Wilson and the star of the show Jennifer Hudson playing Effie White, the Florence Ballard role.  The girls were discovered at an amateur talent show by used car salesman Curtis Taylor Jr. played by Jamie Foxx and based on Motown record mogul Berry Gordy Jr.<br /><br />Foxx using a slick rap convinces Danny Glover playing manager Marty Madison whose meal ticket James "Thunder" Early played by a surprisingly good Eddie Murphy is a chitterling circuit R & B legend, to use The Dreamettes as a back up group.  Lead singer, the incredibly talented gospel voiced Hudson leads the group but is promised by Foxx that he's striving to make them headliners.<br /><br />In colloboration with Effie's song writing brother C.C. played by Keith Robinson. Foxx decides that the slim attractive Knowles needs to front the group instead of the full figured Hudson, to cross into the mainstream of pop music.  In this pre-civil rights era R & B suffers also from segregation.  Foxx pushes hard using payola to get his music appreciated and played by the American Bandstand set.<br /><br />Successfully making the transition, the moody and tempermental Hudson is booted from the group without anyone knowing she was pregnant with Foxx's child.  Effie breaks into the soulful heartfelt "And I am Telling You I'm Not Going", a five minute superb vocal performance by Hudson, in response to her banishment.  Years elapse and Deena Jones (Knowles) now married to Foxx, becomes the diva we remember Diana Ross to be.  The story concludes as the group is breaking up as Knowles begins to pursue an acting career.<br /><br />While the some biographical leeway is taken and the dialogue often falls short, the musical numbers both original to the film and from the Broadway production are very impressive.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ.html">A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ</a><br/><p>I didn't dislike Dreamgirls, but I didn't love it either. It's just your typical been-done-before Hollywood film, only this time it's done with a big famous soundtrack and storyline. That only partly makes the film a success.<br /><br />The first hour or so of the film is dedicated to slowly revealing all the characters that we will be watching for the next 2+ hours. Danny Glover, Jamie Foxx, Eddie Murphy, Beyonce Knowles, Jennifer Hudson, and even Steve Urkle is in there for a second at the beginning (that's when you know they're pulling all the stops).<br /><br />Although there are some dazzling shots and some amazing singing performances, most of the acting is lackluster, except for Jamie Foxx, and Eddie Murphy occasionally, though he's just playing the Eddie Murphy we've always seen. For some reason when he plays the same character in a dramatic film, it earns him an Oscar nomination. That speaks more to the low amount of respect given to comedic actors in comedies than to Eddie Murphy's acting. Jennifer Hudson is not an actress, except when she's singing. Maybe they should have invented a new category for her called "Best Supporting Singer" because during straight acting scenes she was stunningly blank and disappointing.<br /><br />The film itself drags quite a bit, even with the four or five montages used to show the singers' rise to the top. It all gets a bit repetitive and boring, although the second hour is much more exciting and entertaining than the first.<br /><br />Overall, like I said, it's not a bad movie, it's just not a good one. And it's definitely not a Best Picture contender... I don't know how that idea got sold to Academy Award nominators. Check it out if you love musicals or if you love watching pop-singers pretend to act in between singing and dancing. Other than that, it's not worth the time.</p></br><a href="../users/AJMU8VVFKMZI4.html">AJMU8VVFKMZI4</a><br/><p>I've never seen the Broadway production and I dragged two friends to see this movie though they've never heard of the film or the buzz going around it.  I just told them to trust me and crammed them into the theater.  This is the first time I went to a film after hearing the Hollywood buzz and had not been disappointed.  This movie and especially Jennifer Hudson deserves everything that's happening right now.  In my theater after the BIG number Hudson received a thunderous applause and again at the end of the movie.  My friends raved for hours after the show-so overall it was great music and great performances.  You will not be disappointed.  Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>I can't believe I actually thought this movie would be good. And I love musicals! (I do own Grease one and two, Sound Of Music etc - I am that sad.) I was actually warned before hand that the characters actually start SINGING their lines to each other, but I figured, every musical does that at some point - against a backing track. But no, there's no backing track at the some point, and it's simply stupid for them to start singing their lines.<br /><br />Basically, there's no story. It's trying to work a story around the songs, basing the story around the story of the Supremes, and also possibly Destiny's Child if you look closely enough. There's absolutely no point to Eddie Murphy's character, he has become a paraody of himself, and was pretty much playing Donkey the entire role.<br /><br />Beyonce lost approximately 20lbs to play this role, which was absolutely unnecessary since she had a gorgeous figure as it was. She thankfully, doesn't go too skinny, which could have been possible, but yet I don't think they would have told Jennifer Hudson to lose weight somehow!<br /><br />The film does start to go somewhere towards the end, for their final show, and just before Deena gets fed up with her life, and records the brilliant song "Listen". The lyrics meant a lot to me when I heard it on her album, but the lryics mean so much more in the film. It's really the only part of the movie that works.<br /><br />I would warn everybody to avoid this movie as much as possible. There's no point to it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EOLRV216BXJ9.html">A1EOLRV216BXJ9</a><br/><p>This definitely is the vehicle for Jennifer Hudson's success. She exudes the emotional depth and subtleties of the well-written character Effie White. I could not help admire how the numbers were cleverly arranged with no dialogue needed. The singing itself and the shots spoke it all, as "Family" demonstrated when all tried to persuade Effie to cede singing lead. Jennifer Hudson's powerful, rich, brassy voice is unforgettable - a desperate voice to be heard. Whether she was protesting being replaced by Sharon Leal in the trio - they sang "It's all over" and she sang "And I'm telling you I'm not going", or fighting for a living in "I'm changing", her performances were marvelous and unparalleled. When the Dreamgirls bade farewell in the end, she was exuberant and sang her heart out to her little darling. It is simply a delight to watch the ups and downs (or rather the downs and ups) of Effie White.<br /><br />Other characters are also very watchable and their voices most creditable - Jamie Fox, Eddie Murphy, Danny Glover, Keith Robinson (as C.C. White), Anika Noni Rose, Sharon Leal, Queen Lativah. Needless to say, Beyonce Knowles paled in comparison because of her difficult role. Maybe she was too beautiful, maybe her character, Deena Jones, was too perfect and thus appeared unreal and weak when compared with the struggles of those around her. Jennifer Hudson's role as Effie White, by contrast, was all flesh and blood.<br /><br />This could easily have been a movie more on Effie White and less on Deena Jones. The movie could have been more like All about Eve, placing equal emphasis on Bette Davis and Anne Baxter. Jennifer Hudson fully deserves an Oscar - not just for a Supporting Role but for a Leading Role.</p></br><a href="../users/A27H9DOUGY9FOS.html">A27H9DOUGY9FOS</a><br/><p>"Dreamgirls" has finally arrived on the screen. After being touted all of 2006 as the film to beat come award season, the expectations within the industry seemed impossibly high. After unveiling a sequence at Cannes, the Oscar talk began in earnest--months and months before its release (or anyone actually seeing the final product). Can any film really sustain this type of hype? Does "Dreamgirls" live up to it? The answer is a qualified "No." But that doesn't mean that "Dreamgirls" isn't a worthy film, for it is. It is an extremely well made and beautifully performed movie musical. It isn't breaking any new ground, however--but very few, if any, films that year could have been the wondrous creation that insiders were expecting of "Dreamgirls."<br /><br />"Dreamgirls" tells the story of a girls' group (based loosely on the Supremes). The Dreamettes get their break singing backup to a legendary soul performer (played with gusto by Eddie Murphy). Guided by their manager (Jamie Foxx), the trio take the gig hoping to break out on their own. Effie, played by Jennifer Hudson, is ostensibly the group's leader as she is its frontwoman with an incredible singing voice. Also in the group is Deena, played by Beyonce. As Foxx positions the girls to be an act of their own, he asks Deena to step to the forefront as the most beautiful, and therefore commercially viable, asset of the group. This betrayal sets the stage for Effie's departure as she is relegated to singing backup for someone with less talent.<br /><br />The movie follows fairly conventional standards, the more successful the group gets--the more relationships suffer in the name of business. Foxx becomes the villain of the piece, and one by one, those who have been his allies fall by the wayside. The dramatics, especially in the second half, plod along at a predictable pace. It's here where the musical numbers rescue the picture. Where they are incorporated more effectively in the first hour, they become the whole movie near the end. So it's a good thing we have such a talented and engaging cast to keep us connected. Jennifer Hudson is a marvel, the movie (as the stage musical) clearly belongs to Effie. Eddie Murphy gamely triumphs. And Beyonce acquits herself well. Writing and incorporating her original song "Listen" into the musical's score gives Deena a soaring highpoint that she doesn't get on stage. Everyone in the cast is uniformly excellent.<br /><br />Of course, anyone familiar with music or musicals undoubtedly knows the signature anthem "And I'm Telling You I'm Not Going." Performed by Hudson as Effie is left behind, the song conveys so much emotion--pain and rage--that it is an instantly recognizable Broadway standard. Having won Jennifer Holliday a Tony Award as Effie, it is garnering many film awards for Hudson. If anything, though, the moment is so BIG--the number is actually a bit overproduced. With so many shifting camera angles, and a swirling crescendo of symphonic music--we threaten to lose the heart and soul of the song, its simple power. Credit Hudson, though, for keeping us grounded.<br /><br />I liked "Dreamgirls" a lot. Obviously it sounds great, but all the production values are topnotch. But for all that is good, we have lost some of the intimacy of the stage show. There are a number of moments that might have been scaled back. By showing restraint in the orchestrations and film technique--the voices, the lyrics and the acting could have more effectively conveyed genuine emotion--raw and powerful as the show should be. Bonus points for Loretta Devine (Broadway's Deena) popping up to sing a nightclub number near the end. Definitely recommended! KGHarris, 12/06.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL.html">A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL</a><br/><p>Truth is stranger than fiction.  Or at least it's very familiar in 'Dream Girls, a triumphant survey of modern black music interspersed with behind the scenes drama of backbiting, drugs, egos, and deception.  The thinly veiled look at Motown (Rainbow Records) and the debacle between key members of Diana Ross and The Supremes almost makes this whole musical historical fiction--or, I should say, non-fiction.<br /><br />It all starts, of course, with earnest talent like a James Brown-like performer (Eddie Murphy) who wows audiences and a girl group who tries to break through the fixed Detroit talent contest.  (They groom a B.B. King-like performer to win.)  Once they lose, they must depend on managers to see them through (Curtis, a very Berry Gordy-like figure played by Jamie Foxx, and an older entreprenuer (Danny Glover) who depends on his old-hand skills for catapulting stars.)  They all seek the top, but only Curtis sees what's necessary to get a black act there.  For all their talent, their records are stolen and sanitized by white singers (more than a little reminiscent of Pat Boone) and brought to the top of the charts.  Using gambling and mob money, Curtis bribes the D.J.'s to play his own music.  More galling is his maneuvering to unseat Effie White (played with spunk by Jennifer Hudson), the talented but overweight lead singer, to the backdrop and put Deana Jones (Beyonce') to the head of the group.  Even though her own mother is even perplexed by the venue change, Curtis, to his conniving credit has, cynically, the winning formula.  Everyone is at his mercy until they all either become washed up or leave his productive but overly possessive nest.  (And how many parallels can be made when Deanna and Effie  are nearly dead ringers for Diana Ross and Mary Wells?)  If that doesn't convince you that this musical movie is hardly fiction, then the near replicas for The Jackson Five surely will.<br /><br />'Dream Girls' is a glorious display of modern black music since the advent of the girl group in the early sixties.  It also intersperses well events like the riots and Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King's presence.  But one objection remains:  The backstage bickering is necessary, but also burdening.  When they expose the politics of alliances and talented people burned, they do it well.  That is until they sing about it; then it becomes awkward and maudlin.  Numbers like "When I Saw You" and "We Are the Family" seem sappy next to the splendor of the numbers they perform on stage.  See 'Dream Girls' by all means, but realize that it has limitations.  It is sometimes overly sentimental and embarrassing when they sing about their troubles--not as well integrated as, say, 'Chicago' in this regard.  Despite its flaws, 'Dream Girls' has a likable ensemble, a good story, and, most of all, glorious music.</p></br><a href="../users/AV5G37VFE5NVD.html">AV5G37VFE5NVD</a><br/><p>Bill Condon's DREAMGIRLS is the finest kind of musical.  It may be forgotten, it may remembered, but what's important is that while watching it, the audience is transfixed, uplifted, and compelled to get up and sing.  It has great music, a great cast, and a great screenplay to tie it all together.  The moral of the story, if there is one, isn't really clear, but the plot, based on the tale of Diana Ross & The Supremes, revolves around three young women who become R&B superstars in the 1960s, and how their lives fall apart as their stardom increases.  If the film does have a problem, it's because it uses the same formula used by every other "motown bio drama" ever made: nobodys have a shot at stardom, they work for stardom, they become superstars, they fall into drugs and depression, they redeem themselves and accept the end of their careers.  Fortunately the rest of the film is grand enough that the formulativeness is hardly noticeable.<br /><br />The three young women are portrayed by Beyonce Knowles, AMERICAN IDOL finalist Jennifer Hudson, and Anika Noni Rose; by the film's end, a fourth girl, Sharon Leal, has joined.  Jamie Foxx plays the slimy manager, and Danny Glover plays the kindhearted manager.  Keith Robinson plays Hudson's brother and the girls' songwriter, and Eddie Murphy plays the rambunctious James "Thunder" Early.  The entire cast is excellent, but standouts are Hudson, who is a surprisingly talented actor, and Murphy, who finally receives a chance to show off some dramatic acting and succeeds in doing so.  Foxx is also great as his most despicable character ever.<br /><br />Bill Condon, who did a marvelous job with 2002's hit CHICAGO, does some great work here, utilizing numerous camera angles to create a sort of swirling, uplifting feeling.  The editing is seamless, and the production design is shiny and fresh.  It's the music that's really wonderful, though - sweet, hearty, warm, soaring, and a variety of other colorful, delectable adjectives.  With audiences' recently-renewed interest in musicals, I'm surprised that an R&B musical hasn't been done earlier.<br /><br />There's not a lot to be said about DREAMGIRLS - there's nothing especially original or bold about it.  But it's good, well-made, high-spirited fun, and if you're looking for a way to kill 2 hours, you can't do much better.  The cast is great, the music is great, the film is great, and even if no one remembers it ten years from now, the sheer enjoyment the audience gets from the experience is all that matters.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>Dreamgirls is one of the worst films I saw in 2006. First of all, I can see why this picture wasn't nominated for an Oscar in the best picture category. And who said Jennifer Hudson could act, she would have never gotten the role of Elfie if it wasn't for American Idol. Hudson's acting so self-righteous and wooden, please tell how she won the Academy Award. Eddie Murphy can't sing and Beyonce looks like she doesn't know what's going on half the time, this film is pretty bad. I was expecting some great Broadway tunes but they are completely awful. The song, Cadillac is embarrassing and ridiculous. Stay away from Dreamgirls, such a pointless and idiotic musical. If you want to see a great musical then check-out  Grease, A Chorus Line, and Chicago.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ULSA0IRUE09E.html">A2ULSA0IRUE09E</a><br/><p>A few notes on this film and the DVD release to help you make your purchase:<br /><br />THE PERFORMANCES:<br /><br />1. Beyonce Knowles : Obviously modelled on Diana Ross, Beyonce flits in and out of this movie, holding us only with her beauty. This woman has no acting ability, lets face it, and her singing is only barely tolerable.<br /><br />2. Jennifer Hudson : A very overrated performance, in my opinion. She sings her heart out, but to me it seemed like a whole lot of nothing. At the most, it seemed like a young woman who wanted people to notice her performance and therefore went over-the-top. I didn't like this performance.<br /><br />3. Eddie Murphy : Adequate, but badly scripted. This role could have been done by any black actor of that age group, and Eddie does not add anything special to the role.<br /><br />THE DIRECTION & FEEL<br /><br />I loved the direction, the sets and the orchestrated choreographed dance and song numbers. It all felt a bit overblown and HEARTLESS but hey thats just me. You'd probably love it more than I did.<br /><br />THE MUSIC<br /><br />We all know this was the weakest aspect of this movie. Even Hudsons' showstopper number (am I the only one waiting for her to shut up?) had no melody really. And other than "Listen" by Beyonce, I don't see anything here worth humming.<br /><br />FINAL THOUGHTS<br /><br />My only sensation after watching this was "What Happened to the Great American Musical?". What happened to classics like "The Sound of Music", "Carousel" and "State Fair"? Those were real musicals. "Dreamgirls" felt like a gigantic ornamental pom-pom stuffed in my face, and I just couldn't bring myself to like it.<br /><br />If you are a fan of this movie, sorry. I just have to say that I love musicals, and this was NOT a musical. It disrespects what a musical ought to be.<br /><br />Note to directors : Please do not cast Beyonce in the lead role in films anymore. Its a total waste of precious film.</p></br><a href="../users/AT07UZQQR7ZEH.html">AT07UZQQR7ZEH</a><br/><p>As a drama major in college, I bemoan the fact that roadshow versions of Broadway musicals are too damned expensive nowadays, especially when souvenir booklets and sweatshirts are factored in.  So I am grateful when an Oscar-winning writer/director like Bill Condon (GODS AND MONSTERS, CHICAGO) decides to lavishly film a Tony winner, like 1981's DREAMGIRLS.  It's a fabulous, glittering three-ring circus of a movie, with a strong script, stunning performances by three extraordinary African-American singers (Oscar winner Jennifer Hudson as Effie, Beyonce Knowles as Deena, and Anika Noni Rose as Lorrell), and dazzling theatrical lighting by Jules Fisher and Peggy Eisenhauer (Tobias Schliesser is cinematographer).  It's a gem of a musical that, at a running time of 130 minutes and with twelve almost non-stop songs, has to be pretty close to the stage original.  And if some songs have been shortened, I did not notice.<br /><br />With lyrics by Tom Eyen, music by Henry Krieger, and choreography inspired by  Michael Bennett, DREAMGIRLS is loosely based on the rise and fall of the Supremes.  Effie, Deena, and Lorrell are here called The Dreams, and Jamie Foxx as Curtis Taylor is their arrogant manager.  He is not afraid to walk all over people in mid-1960's Detroit when the more talented Effie is put in the rear of the trio because Deena is more beautiful.  And Eddie Murphy (deservedly Oscar-nominated as James "Thunder" Early) never attracts a white crossover audience as a drug-addicted R&B lounge singer; he eventually dies of a heroin overdose.  We follow The Dreams all the way to Los Angeles around 1975 as they try to make it as black singers in mostly white middle America over fifteen years or so.  The finale is a stupendous and dazzling, ten-star, rock-the-house affair that leads in to ten minutes of closing credits to let us know that literally hundreds of talented people on both sides of the camera helped bring this beloved stage musical to the screen as a razzle-dazzle affair.<br /><br />The version of DREAMGIRLS that I bought is the "2-disk Showstopper Edition", and they aren't kidding.  Disk one with the movie includes extended versions of all twelve musical numbers, a special cutting room floor Jennifer Hudson number, and a Beyonce music video.  And a mammoth disk 2 includes a full 2 hour documentary on creating both the stage musical and the movie step by step 25 years apart; auditions and screen tests; and individual featurettes on the dazzling lighting, creating the costumes, doing the editing, and many more technical shorts.  It should keep you out of trouble and humming happily for days on end.<br /><br />For once, new Hollywood has improved on old Hollywood by showing how to transfer an award-winning stage musical to the screen brilliantly and successfully.  DREAMGIRLS is a giddy and exhilarating knockout.  And, yes, it should have been an Oscar nominee for Picture and Director, though it got plenty of other nominations.  Like the brilliant LITTLE CHILDREN, also shut-out for Picture and Director, it will be fun to see what movies from 2006 people are still raving about in ten or twenty years.  By the way, do see DREAMGIRLS in wide-screen format for its Panavision images.  Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ.html">A12X2J7AVZ04IQ</a><br/><p>Because of dubious reports on the merits of this film, I never saw it in the theatres, and only bought the single-disc DVD. After watching the film, I think it would be interesting to see the 2nd disc. "Dreamgirls" is a good film, with very good characters and character development. Bill Condon kept the essence of the goings-on, and the editing of Virginia Katz kept a good flow of events. The cast is outstanding, with Jennifer Hudson centering the film in an auspicious award-winning performance; it is a many-layered performance, and she shines brightest of all. Jamie Foxx & Danny Glover are fine, as are Beyonce and Anika Noni Rose. One of the best performances in the film is by Keith Robinson, who is usually relegated somewhat to the background, but is really a catalyst in the plot as Hudson's brother. There is also some of the best choreography I've seen in a long time (by Fatima Robinson), but not enough. The surprise cameos of John Lithgow & John Krasinski were also a treat. One thing that bothered me about previous reviewers was that it was too "white", whatever that means. Indeed, as a period piece, where Black musicians weren't allowed on shows like American Bandstand, and had to make due with their own localized record labels, those performers had to break through insurmountable barriers. These performers were intelligent people, and I'm glad they didn't resort to ebonic stereotypes. Eddie Murphy may have deserved the Oscar, if only for his long and illustrious career. But so did Alan Arkin, for the same reason; both actors were killed off early in the film. Eddie certainly gave it energy! But, in the end, it's Hudson you'll remember. Her strength and determination really commands, and she sings well, too. I never found it boring. There's more to say, I'm sure, but these are my immediate reactions.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AYN3IIUNQCIA.html">A1AYN3IIUNQCIA</a><br/><p>Dreamgirls is phenomenal, the performences, the music, and some lavish set designs make for one great movie. i still dont know why Dreamgirls was snubbed for Best Picture and Director, that to me is just one big Effie-sized shutout. but that still cant hurt the movies merit. the film, based on the popular Broadway show, tells of the Dreamettes, Deana Jones, Effie White, and Lorrell Robinson who have just been discovered by car salesman Curtis Taylor who is determined to make them famous. when the Dreamettes become backup singers for regional hotshot singer James "Thunder" Jones, there careers suddenly take of and soon, they become the Dreams. however, fame has its price as outspoken Effie begins to disrupt Cutris's plans until she's ousted compeltly and Deana is made lead singer. what follows is what the price of fame will do to best friends and to the ones they love. the music in the film is definenlty in vein with Motown, each number is just full of energy and flare you cant help but get up. all the actors are great but the standouts are definently Jennifer Hudson and Eddie Murphy. Murphy redeems himself after some lackluster films and shows off dramatic chops he hasent bothered to used in years. it still baffels me he lost the Supporting Actor award. but it is Jennifer Hudson's Oscar winning role that steals the show, she totally embodies Effie with all her sass, heartache, and big voice, and i mean BIG voice. when she sings her solo "and i'm telling you i'm not going", she just brings the house down, no she actually destroys the house and sends chills up your spine. take that American Idol! so if you want to see one of the best films of the year, then Dreamgirls is the film for you.</p></br><a href="../users/A146H6A41B26QT.html">A146H6A41B26QT</a><br/><p>The hullabaloo over this film's NOT getting a Best Picture nomination overshadowed what is one of the best movie musicals I've seen in years. The story is familiar and fascinating--especially for those of us of Baby Boom vintage---and the all-star cast was wonderful. Eddie Murphy has to be the most versatile actor around; I couldn't believe it was he in the part of the fading R&B star. Newcomer Jennifer Hudson sings her heart out, and Beyonce` is drop dead gorgeous as well as credible in the Diana Ross role.  The music echoed the golden age of Motown and carried the story. The audience clapped--hard!--when it was over. Forget the press and see the movie--it's great!</p></br><a href="../users/A13E0ARAXI6KJW.html">A13E0ARAXI6KJW</a><br/><p>Like many others, I vividly recall how Jennifer Holliday sent shivers down my neck when she ripped through her defiant anthem, "And I'm Telling You I'm Not Going", in the original Broadway production nearly a quarter century ago. It is the kind of transcendent moment in the theater that had exponentially raised my anticipation of the much-delayed 2006 screen adaptation. The great news is that director/screenwriter Bill Condon has pulled together a top-notch entertainment piece full of ceaseless energy and eye-filling dazzle. Even if the narrative deficiencies of Tom Eyen's original musical have not been resolved here, Condon compensates by bringing more historical context to the story and making even more pointed references to the characters' real-life counterparts. More importantly, he recognizes that the episodic human drama really takes a back seat to the early Motown-to-disco musical pastiche brought forth by Henry Krieger's sturdy, crescendo-heavy score and Eyen's constantly engaging lyrics.<br /><br />The time-spanning plot focuses on a girl group in Detroit, three childhood friends - vocal powerhouse Effie backed up by good-girl Deena and chatty Lorrell - who are together known as the Dreamettes. Showing promise but failing to win a local amateur contest, they are corralled by smooth-talking Cadillac huckster Curtis Taylor to sing back-up for local R&B star James Thunder Early. They become a hit on the chitlin' circuit, but Taylor wants broader fame. Along with Effie's ambitious, soft-spoken songwriting brother C.C., Taylor launches a new label, Rainbow Records, right out of his car dealership. They record a song that starts to move on the charts but not before it is lifted by a white group in an antiseptic cover version. Taylor turns to payola to ensure Early and the Dreamettes achieve pop success on their own. He also tries to tone down Early for white audiences and makeover the girls into the Dreams. The latter strategy means pushing Effie into the background and Deena upfront, a move that causes friction and resentment in spite of the group's burgeoning success. Eventually, Effie's diva behavior gets her kicked out of the Dreams, and Early's star fades into addiction and irrelevance. Meanwhile, Taylor has built a media empire with plans to make Deena a movie star. His Svengali-level of control reaches a breaking point when he takes back a song C.C. wrote for Effie's resuscitating solo career in order to make it a disco hit for the Dreams.<br /><br />It's most fortunate that casting is exemplary here because that could have easily been the film's downfall. Even though it is an ensemble piece, the lion's share of the press has been going to Jennifer Hudson's blazing debut performance as Effie. Standing in the shadow of the startlingly overwhelming Jennifer Holliday is no picnic, but with her zaftig figure and huge voice, Hudson effortlessly captures the character's sassy self-confidence and eventual emotional deconstruction. Musically, she clearly has the vocal chops and technique to nail all of Effie's numbers, especially "And I'm Telling You I'm Not Going", the film's crowning moment. As Early, Eddie Murphy finally has a role that takes advantage of his gift for mimicry (this time an amalgam of Wilson Pickett, Jackie Wilson and James Brown - who sadly just died this morning), adds darker colors and textures to his established screen persona and dares him to try singing again. The result is nothing short of a revelation.<br /><br />As Deena, the obvious Diana Ross doppelganger, Beyonc&eacute; Knowles manages to hold her own, even though her character has not been sharpened into a stronger personality. A stunning woman by anyone's measure, she manages to capture her progenitor's breathy, slinky singing style, while lending a naturalistic quality to her portrayal. She has one shining musical moment, a new song called "Listen", though ironically, her powerful vocal delivery seems at odds with Deena's supposedly limited talents. With the unenviable task of playing Curtis, the Berry Gordy-like figure of Machiavellian villainy, Jaime Foxx begins solid even as the character becomes more cardboard as the story progresses. With a beautifully soulful voice of her own, Anika Noni Rose shines as Lorrell moving fluidly from ditzy back-up singer to resigned mistress. Keith Robinson also displays a fine voice and brings gravitas to his subtle performance as C.C, while Danny Glover provides his welcome seasoned presence as Early's manager, Marty.<br /><br />There are several moments that are plain wonderful. One in particular is when Early starts to rehearse the Dreamettes on "Fake Your Way to the Top", and as he gyrates, it turns into the actual stage show. Another is the near-operatic histrionics on "It's All Over" when most of the principals take flashy, fiery turns to illuminate the story's turning point. I like some of the movie's more overt send-ups like Early wearing Marvin Gaye's knit cap as he sings his civil rights-themed ballad, "Patience", or when Deena comes floating down the theater aisles blowing air kisses just like Diana Ross at the Motown reunion concert. All the production values are first-class from Tobias A. Schliessler's dazzling, color-saturated cinematography to Sharen Davis' va-va-voom costumes to Virginia Katz's kinetic film editing to John Myhre's evocative production design which includes recreations of the 1967 Detroit riots. Despite a smattering of weakly contrived dramatic moments in the second half, this is knockout entertainment for anyone who enjoys the musical genre.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>Eddie Murphy, in the finest work of his career, this movie will dazzle and delight you. A wonderful entertainment. Jennifer Hudson all I can say is wow. You will not be disappointed.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TWTULVD6F22O.html">A1TWTULVD6F22O</a><br/><p>Somewhere out there, Jennifer Holliday is shaking her head and sighing. Jennifer was nearly 25 years ahead of her time when she starred in the Broadway version of "Dreamgirls" as Effie. Today, she's seen the show come to film and make another Jennifer, Jennifer Hudson, a star. Timing is everything. Hudson was poised like no other entertainer, to pick up the strings and threads left by the amazing Aretha Franklin as a queen of the soul sound.<br /><br />Amazing that she is propelled into the role by a movie, and not by a record. "Dreamgirls" is loosely based on actual Motown events, on promoter/producer Berry Gordy (Curtis Taylor, played by Jamie Foxx),an amalgam of a black male singer that is a combination of James Brown-Marvin Gay (James "Thunder" Early, played by Eddie Murphy) and a trio of female singers sketched after the Supremes. Like the Supremes, the trio starts with three girls who have been singing together forever (Effie, played by Hudson, Deena, played by Beyonce, and Lorrell, played by Anika Noni Rose) and who finally break into the Motown scene as backup singers. Involved in the success of the group is Effie's brother, who writes their songs (C.C. White, played by Keith Robinson).<br /><br />The movie takes the players through love and hardship, from gaining respect to being a multi-platinum success, with the downside issues that come with fame. Characters betray each other, love each other, find redemption.<br /><br />The music is spectacular, so much that I purchased the soundtrack. The world talks about Hudson's incredible solo of "And I Am Telling You (I'm Not Going)." I equally enjoyed her solo takes on "I Am Changing" and "One Night Only". She's incomparable. The group performance (with Eddie Murphy as lead) of the anti-war anthem, "Patience", was a highlight for me. And there is a sweet, sweet moment at the memorial service for Thunder, when Loretta Devine (from the Broadway production and the TV show Boston Public) sings "I Miss You, Old Friend".<br /><br />The costumes are equally well done, and the screenplay works hard to make the production flow (although it doesn't succeed nearly as well as "Chicago" did). It takes Dreamgirls from the tough times of the black music circuit in the 60's, to actual footage of the race riots and Martin Luther King, to the glitz of Miami and the disco scene, and the ennui that was Hollywood in those days. There are some "down" spots, an example of which is Thunder's drug problem...the script has focused on his womanizing, and the addiction issue comes out of nowhere.<br /><br />Completely entertaining, musically outstanding, "Dreamgirls" is a great addition to your collection of DVD musicals.</p></br><a href="../users/ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV.html">ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV</a><br/><p>DREAMGIRLS opened on Broadway in 1981 and was in the running for a film version long, long before it closed in 1985.  Very loosely based on the lives and career of The Supremes, it told the story of a black girl group whose cross-over from "race records" to the pop charts fuel the success of an increasingly cut-throat recording mogul--and find the price of fame and fortune in the recording industry too high for their liking.<br />While it borrows a great deal from numerous music personalities and stories of the 1960s and 1970s, DREAMGIRLS is essentially a riff on the career of The Supremes and the group's relationship with Motown founder Berry Gordy.<br /><br />The Supremes were originally created by Florence Ballard, a powerhouse vocalist who worked with Diana Ross and Mary Wilson as back up singers.  Berry sought a group that could cross over into the pop charts and reformulated the line-up, moving the prettier Diana Ross to lead--and ultimately dismissing Ballard from the group entirely, replacing her with Cindy Birdsong.  After the music industry turned its back on Ballard, she declined in alcoholism and poverty and died at age 32.  She is widely regarded as one of the great tragic figures on the long list of American rock and roll casualties.<br /><br />When DREAMGIRLS opened on Broadway in 1981 critics praised its powerhouse performances and its dazzling staging--but were somewhat less favorable toward its script and score, noting that the characters were one-note and with one or two exceptions that the score was neither memorable nor able to capture the sharply crafted pop hooks of the Motown style it tried to mimic.  Even so, the play ran five years, and over the years numerous studios, producers, directors, and stars have took a crack at bringing it to the screen--something that didn't happen until 2006.  And once more critics praised its powerhouse performances and dazzling staging--and were considerably less enthusiastic about its script and score.<br /><br />The great flaw in DREAMGIRLS is that, while it centers on the story of Florence Ballard, neither the stage nor screen version actually has the nerve to play it out: it, the rivalry between Ballard and Ross, and the brutalities of the music business are actually somewhat underplayed in an effort to place every character in a softer light.  As for the music, the score does include the stunning "I'm Telling You I'm Not Going," but the original criticism stands: although pleasant enough, the songs are not particularly memorable and they do indeed lack the sharp, slick edges of the Motown sound that inspired them.<br /><br />Like many another period film, the look is not really accurate: instead of accurately depicting the 1960s and 1970s it is that era as seen through a modern filter, the 1960s and 1970s as we tend to recall them rather than as they actually were.  Even so, there is plenty of visual splash; the costumes, the concert stagings, and the overall art design is quite fine, and you never actually question accuracy while it unfolds before.  And then there are the performances.<br /><br />With the exception Jamie Foxx, who seems slightly miscast in the role of music manager and producer Curtis Taylor, DREAMGIRLS is filled with memorable performances.  Although she does not imitate Diana Ross per se, Beyonce Knowles captures Ross' look and sense of style remarkably well;  Danny Glover offers a memorable turn as agent Marty Madison; and overall the supporting cast is quite fine.  But the big noises her are Eddie Murphy as James Early, a role based on several singers of the era but most particularly on James Brown, and Jennifer Hudson as Effy White, the role based on Florence Ballard.<br /><br />Murphy's film career has been very up and down over the years, ranging from the popular 48 HOURS to the diastrous HARLEM NIGHTS, and he is at present best known for such mild comedies as DR. DOOLITTLE and NORBIT.  He typically plays himself--but DREAMGIRLS puts him on the acting map in a serious way.  Not only does he does he offer an extraordinary bit of work as the flamboyant but self-destructive R&B singer, he tears strips off his musical numbers.  Prior to her appearance in DREAMGIRLS, Jennifer Hudson was best know as an also-ran on television's American Idol, which entirely failed to anticipate the depths of her vocal talents and acting skill.  DREAMGIRLS, however, exploited what television missed--and while it is technically a supporting role, Hudson's Effie White is the glue that holds the whole thing together.  It is easily the most remarkable screen debut since Barbra Striesand's 1968 FUNNY GIRL.<br /><br />DREAMGIRLS is not a "perfect" film, much less a "great" musical.  As previously noted, the script is a bit weak and the music slightly below expectations, and when all is said and done it's a bit too glossy for its own good.  But it is easy on the eyes, the cast is solid, and you'll never be less than amazed by Murphy and Hudson.  The one-disk DVD offers extended scenes but little else; if you are a hardcore fan you'll no doubt want to go with the double disk special edition.

I got James Brown ,but I'm not sure about the others.  Jenifer Hudson plays a young black woman with an attitude and a big voice, could it be that she is a young black woman with an attitude and a big voice.  Maybe she wasn't acting.  I'll hold off in judging her acting abilities until she has a different role.<br /><br />All in all an enjoyable movie.

The sight of people breaking into song mid-sentence annoys me to no end, and the very idea that people would talk to each other in verse is ridiculous. That being said, I wanted to see this movie because I'm a Jennifer Hudson fan and I wanted to see what all the talk was about. I'm glad that I did. Dreamgirls isn't a cheesy musical. There is no moment when the people are doing something absolutely ridiculous but it's justified because they're singing at the same time. In fact, the singing supports the story rather than the story supporting the singing, which is the main problem I have with musicals. Dreamgirls was enjoyable from start to finish, and I'd encourage those who don't consider themselves musical fans to give it a go.</p></br><a href="../users/A5TZXWU8AALIC.html">A5TZXWU8AALIC</a><br/><p>I've never seen the Broadway show of DREAMGIRLS but I know it's been around for a long time.  Maybe if I'd followed this story's history better I could've navigated the movie a little better...but I was thrown by the insertion of conventional musical numbers into a really good dramatic film.<br /><br />It's a story about music so there could've been plenty of songs but having the actors burst into song during some heavy dramatic scenes threw me off a little.  It didn't have to lapse into that convention.<br /><br />Everyone was excellent.  Eddie Murphy was outstanding.  It's a finely-crafted film that left me wondering just how far removed it was from the real-life story of Diana Ross and the Supremes.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RH7ARWQSUVQV.html">A2RH7ARWQSUVQV</a><br/><p>"Dream Girls" is a brilliant, glitzy and thoroughly entertaining production.  The women in the film sparkle with both talent, grace and beauty.  The men, both entertainers and agents, are sleazy enough to want to make you take a good both after watching them.  They are acquisitive, double-dealing and sleazy.  Eddie Murphy as a James Brown surrogate does an especially great job.  Consumed by intemperance and drugs he crashes out before the end of the movie.  It is a little difficult to understand why the female "Dreams" love these creeps but...hey...it's Hollywood.<br /><br />"The Dreams" are fairly clearly styled on the "Supremes" and their music and back up verges on the spectacular.  The choreography is every bit as good as the original 'Supremes", maybe better.  Effie, as the not quite so pretty and a little overweight member of the developing group that will become the "Dreams", is especially good.  Despite the fact that she is the most talented member of the group she is tossed aside because their agent thinks she doesn't fit the beautiful image of the other girls.  We feel her hurt and humiliation as she tries to survive without the music she loves.  Effie, if I'm not mistaken, is an Aretha Franklin type character, not beautiful, perhaps, but a terrific talent.<br /><br />Anyway, most of the scuzzy men in the film are ultimately left in the dust but the glorious 'Dreams' go on to greater glory.<br /><br />Ron</p></br></body></html>

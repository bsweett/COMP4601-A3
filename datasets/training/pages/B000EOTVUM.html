I have seen more than my share of bad acting and choppy film making in my day, and Wolf Creek was far from bad. Without looking at what other's wrote, here goes:<br /><br />Wolf Creek is a refreshing and somewhat unique horror movie set in Australia. 3 partiers set off across the country, and end up in need of help in a very remote location. It is here that the story begins.<br /><br />While none of the story elements are unique (car breaking down, young post-teens, remote country hick killer, etc), the execution is perfect. Wolf Creek had me scared, and on the edge of my seat. There are few horror movies that have done this to me. I was totally immersed in the film.<br /><br />The acting was amazing and completely believable. The actor's fear became our terror. Your heart will race when the victims are being pursued. The filmmaking was top notch as well. Despite the low budget, the lighting and feel of the movie is creepy and does nothing but add to the terror.<br /><br />The best part of the film for me are the locations. The killer's hangout is quite unique, and definately not a place I would like to visit.<br /><br />Wolf Creek does an amazing job of selling the story as a completely plausable situation. I could believe that these events really could happen, regardless of whether they actually did or not. Wolf Creek doesn't turn the villain into a bad-dialogue shouting goon, and doesn't turn the victims into cliches.<br /><br />Please also note that this film does not rely on gore or torture as fear tactics. While there are a couple of glimpses at other dead victims, Wolf Creek does not try to shock you through gore; it frightens you with the story.<br /><br />Of all the horror movies I have seen in my life, and I have seen many, I would rank Wolf Creek in the top 5 overall. With a great combination of pitch, acting, feel and (of course) fear, Wolf Creek will not disappoint. I don't have a clue why this film received low ratings: this is no Freddy vs. Jason, or Jason is space. Try Wolf Creek, you won't regret it.<br /><br />Total Score (out of 100) = 90<br /><br />47 (out of 50). Enjoyment. A rating based on my overall enjoyment of the film.<br />9 (out of 10). Acting. How good was the acting?<br />9 (out of 10). Immersion. Did the movie suck me into the story?<br />10 (out of 10). Intangibles. Special effects. Movie pace.

The movie is an enjoyable story as a group of friends travel through some remote areas, then find themselves in an unimaginably bad situation.  I'm starting to enjoy these types of films less - torture, kidnapping, etc.  This one is no exception though, as the torture is palpably real and particularly brutal.  That said, it is very well done, and I can enjoy just watching the first half, and content myself with knowing that the ending isn't so good for the cast.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R6ST52EBN2FK.html">A3R6ST52EBN2FK</a><br/><p>I put off watching this one because I was told it was hard to understand the Australian accents.  Not true, it was easy to understand.  This movie was excellent.  John Jarrett was so friendly at first, until he gets the kids to his lair, they all go to sleep, and wake up to an utter hell.  I do agree with the reviewers that were amazed the one girl returns (after successfully escaping!) to find a car, if it had been me, I'd have gotten the hell outta there on foot, but..  no movie would have been there then.

The very best example of this genre is, of course, `The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' (the original, of course). The very best example of this theme in a mainstream film is `Deliverance', which is easily more scary than many genre horror movies.<br /><br />The sense of reality is enhanced by the statements that the plot is based on real events. Not being privy to any Australian newspapers, I have to believe the producers on this, and it is not too hard to believe, as I can imagine a dandy horror movie made from a homegrown American serial killer. (Come to think of it, it's already been done with `Silence of the Lambs').<br /><br />Unfortunately, this movie falls far short of the grand filmmaking of `Silence of the Lambs' and it even falls short by a bit from its primary mentor, Tobe Hooper, director of the original `Texas Chainsaw Massacre'. This is not to say it is not a good, chilling movie, as it makes good use of conventions which others have not used very well.<br /><br />Like `Cabin Fever', it makes good use of teenagers on a trip. Oddly, like `Cabin Fever', it also has an unbalanced group with an odd number of people instead of an evenly paired up boy girl, boy girl... Even more oddly, there is nothing made of any `triangles' created by this arrangement, but then, the primary order of business is horror, not romance. But, the director plays the relation between the principle characters exceptionally well until things start to get hinky with the car and the appearance of the perp. The writer also makes excellent use of the queasy feeling one gets about `out of towners' encountering the local crowd of louts, as played to the hilt in the classic cult film by Sam Peckinpah, `Straw Dogs'.<br /><br />While no supernatural agent is involved, the movie makes seems to make excellent use of a natural phenomenon in that the magnetic effects around a large Meteor crater, which also happens to be a major tourist attraction, disables automobiles which sit in the influence of the field for very long. The parties facing this disabled vehicle are then victim to the perp. The perp is so unusual as horror movies go that no less a figure than Quentin Tarantino is quoted on the cover as praising the invention of this character. This character is unusual, but I think he is still not as good as our old favorite, leatherface.<br /><br />The director seems to buy into the belief that things seem more horrible in the dark. This may be true when we are dealing with unseen, supernatural effects. But, if we are to learn anything from `Deliverance', it's that up close and personal terror is worse in the bright sunlight and in the open, unless we happen to be specifically playing on claustrophobia.<br /><br />For those who like their horror unvarnished with spooks and seemingly immortal characters like Halloween's Jason, this is a very rewarding shriekfest, even if the gore is not quite so well executed as by master Hooper.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ASIT0JYIGHTA.html">A2ASIT0JYIGHTA</a><br/><p>Based on actual events of two missing British female backpackers, this movie does pull you in, although is rather slow moving for the first half.  Wolf Creek was a surprise hit at the Australian Box Office considering horror films have been out of sorts for some time.  Wolf Creek works for AUstralian audiences in particular because we are all so familiar with a number of back packer murders in the Australian outback.<br /><br />Wolf Creek has a reasonably eeery atmosphere, and as mentioned above, is more realistic than say another torture film "Hostel".  "Hostel", while effective, is hard to take seriously as what is depicted has never actually happened in the country the film was set in, or anywhere that I have heard of.</p></br><a href="../users/AE4JNORCLW8F6.html">AE4JNORCLW8F6</a><br/><p>A horror film, especially one based on true events, is expected to be tragic. Wolf Creek contains some real tragedy and horror. Unlike a lot of typical horror movies, the first half of the movie travels along a benign adventure experienced by three young people just looking for a peaceful vacation. Midway, the film takes a creepy turn that just gets creepier and creepier until it bursts into horror flames. There is fright power in this film. And the ending, also unconventional for a horror movie, left me guessing a bit about the entire premise of the movie. Great plot and execution. Production, editing, writing and acting were great. Some may feel the first half of the movie drags since it contains no 'horror' scenes. I look at it like the build-up to a sneeze. The outcome is inevitable. That makes the horror segments at the second half of the movie that much more shocking and 'horrible.'</p></br><a href="../users/A1X15AQVSCKKRG.html">A1X15AQVSCKKRG</a><br/><p>Ok flick. "Wolf Creek" is nothing special but it does pass the test for viewing, "Wolf Creek" is basically a slasher /homicidal flick that is based on true events.<br /><br />Man this film is incredibly slow for the first hour almost to the point that I stopped watching the flick. Way too much emphasis on the Australian scenery and what not.<br /><br />Kristy, Ben, Liz are three friends out in the Wolf Creek area when their car doesn't stop, they meet a couple of disturbing , trashy , filthy locals in a bar. Eventually the trio becomes the focus of a deranged little killer Mick and his friends.<br /><br />Once the movie does get going (with roughly thirty minutes left) the action does as well. Pretty decent stunts, and some gore with a couple of intense scenes. The scene near the highway reminded me of "Mad Max" when one of the killer's buddies wants to run down one of the victims. Greg McLean does at least have an eye for creating some memorable shots in the movie<br /><br />Overall "Wolf Creek" is pretty average but it is ok for viewing. Again nothing new here except this is based on actual events.<br /><br />I will say that the acting for the movie when it calls for it ain't that bad. There are some memorable scenes  near the end too.<br /><br />Worth seeing at least once.</p></br><a href="../users/A2W3HLHIA9UP4D.html">A2W3HLHIA9UP4D</a><br/><p>I was immediately intrigued about this film after reading quotes like "not since the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre has terror felt so real" and "as good as horror gets", as well with the extra hype added in that this was based on true events. Nevertheless, I also I had my doubts too. When any film is being compared to the level of the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre,  I have my doubts, because no horror movie, before or since, has quite been able to reach that level. And no, this movie does not reach that threshold of horror, but that doesn't mean it isn't a good movie. The story of the film, though rather quite simple, is good, the acting is surprisingly good as well. The film does have a "documentary-style" feeling to it. There are a lot of close-ups and shaky hand-held camera shots, and the actors seem to be really talking and communicating with each other, rather than just acting out lines of written dialog. What I didn't like as the length of time (almost an hour) in the film before anything really started happening. I would be willing to let this go if there was any real plot development during that first hour, but nothing really important or valuable to the overall story happens during this time. But once the movie kicks in, its quite good. There's an excellent torture scene that I enjoyed, (that sounds a bit sick, doesn't it? lol), as well as a couple of excellent chase scenes. Another thing that jumped out at me, was how the movie fools you into thinking certain characters are gonna survive, only to kill them off. I'm not going to give away the ending, but to me, the character that I would have least likely thought of being the sole survivor, actually does survive! This doesn't happen that often in these type of films. But while I'm on the subject of survivors, I did think that the body count was way lower than it should have been. And though, it was implied that the killer had murdered many others, you only get to see a handful of kills. Perhaps another character or two should have been added in some way, or maybe a quick flashback to a previous murder would have worked. I guess I'm just sick, but some more killing would have been nice!! Now as far as  this DVD goes, the special features are ok. There's a director's commentary thats pretty good as well as 50 minute "Making of Wolf Creek", which is pretty decent. There's also 1 deleted scene, which I hope was included as a joke or something, cause it's really short and stupid. But all in all, this film is definitely worth buying if you're a horror fan. And though I wouldn't consider this movie a modern day classic, nor put it anywhere near the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre, it does have a certain look and feel to it that makes it good little horror movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>Wolf Creek (Greg McLean, 2005)<br /><br />Wolf Creek is another of those movies that often gets lumped in with Saw and Hostel, and not to anyone's benefit. Least of all the movie's. Yes, there are a few scenes that might make the squeamish cringe, but the gore factor here is surprisingly low; I'm half-convinced the movie has the rating it does because of the language rather than the violence.<br /><br />Based on the true story of Ivan Milat, a serial killer who was relatively unknown outside Australia previous to the making of this movie, Wolf Creek follows three kids--Ben (Nathan Phillips of Snakes on a Plane), Kristy (Darkness Falls' Kestie Morassi), and Liz (TV actress Cassandra Magrath)--as they head out to Wolf Creek, a large meteorite crater in the Australian outback, and go hiking. When they get back to their car, they find it dead. A few hours later, a friendly chap named Mick (Picnic at Hanging Rock's John Jarratt) offers to tow them back to his camp and get their car running. That's not what he has in mind, as you know if you've seen any of the trailers.<br /><br />The acting, with the exception of Jarrett (who has been much-lauded for his efforts), is average, maybe slightly above. The cinematography is wonderful, which you can pretty much automatically expect from any movie that comes from that neck of the woods; there's just something about Australian cinematographers. The pace is, as with most horror movies since, modeled upon that of Alien--do nothing for a long time, and then cut everything loose. It's getting kind of old, to be honest. And that's the movie's biggest problem; it cleaves tightly to horror film convention for being an indie flick. Happy beginning, ominous stories at night, false alarm, car breakdown, scary serial killer. Woo. It's done with some style, to be sure, but it's nothing you haven't seen before. ***</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>I had heard a lot of hype about this film, so I went into it expecting a lot.  The last Australian horror I had seen was Undead, which I just found to be ok.  This film is low budget, but you can see the people making it have talent that shines through.  The acting is decent, though some of the Aussie accent and slang is hard to make out.  This film would be the Australian answer to the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  My problem with the film is that the beginning is a bit slow, and I wasn't really convinced by the (psycho) main bad character.  Maybe if they had shown him actually torturing the people and really building the tensions it would have been better.  Instead the characters fall asleep and awaken in a bad state.  This one is okay for a watch, but I don't think it would be getting a tenth of the attention it has received if it was just another low budget U.S. horror release.</p></br><a href="../users/A25PM9JGHPU8EI.html">A25PM9JGHPU8EI</a><br/><p>God, I can't believe it took so long for this to finally come out. I saw its unrated (and presumably) uncensored cut many, many months ago. This is one of the best horror films to come along in a long time mainly because of John Jarratt who plays his character VERY believably. Greg McLean did a terrific job ratcheting up the tension and I applaud his most effective use of violence to freak the kids and you, the audience, out. When I saw this, people were getting up and walking out - a sign that this film worked in its ability to shock and horrify. I truly hope the version I saw survived the MPAA and didn't have to be cut into a chopped-down edit. If it did, well we all have the "Director's Cut" dvd to look forward to. See it and feel the horror.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UKC6QFG9L5GV.html">A2UKC6QFG9L5GV</a><br/><p>I can't understand why most of the people here is booing this flick. Well, the beginning is rather long indeed, but it's in no way boring. It's utterly intense - not by the amount of action going on on screen but psychologically intense. I can't recall any films I saw lately I was feeling myself so uneasy about. These first 30 or 40 minutes (I don't remember exactly) when "nothing happens" fill you with such dread of something inevitable that's going to happen, I found them enormously disturbing.<br /><br />When the situation begins to evolve "Wolf Creek" turns into a usual "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" type of a movie, but it's still very well done. Intense cat-mouse game, no foolish actions from the main characters who try to escape death... I was impressed especially given the fact it's an Australian, low-budget flick. Maybe it's not as powerful as Alexandre Aja's "High Tension" and not as mindblowing as "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" (and I doubt any movie can top this one speaking of viciousness), but it definately stands in one line with "Wrong Turn", "House of 1000 corpses" and so on (unfortunately I haven't seen the remake of "The Hills Have Eyes" yet). Maybe it's not your cup of tea, but "Wolf Creek" is perfect to spend your evening with if you like thrills. And if you are deeply into horror films, you won't regret if you buy it for your collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NSUJJCG73IRF.html">A1NSUJJCG73IRF</a><br/><p>Director:  Greg McLean<br /><br />Cast:  John Jarratt, Cassandra McGrath, Kestie Morassi, Nathan Phillips, Gordon Poole, Guy O'Donnell.<br /><br />Running Time:  99 minutes<br /><br />Rated R for R for strong gruesome violence, and for language.<br /><br />Three young vacationers are traveling through Australia visiting landmarks and such. One of their most anticipated stops is an ancient meteorite crater park called "Wolf Creek." After enjoying the sights the group prepares to leave, but can't start the car. Their watches have also stopped and a strange, almost supernatural, unease rests in on them. They nervously wait until a kindly stranger (John Jarratt) comes by and tows them to his house and offers to fix their car for free; however, they soon find out that this "kindly stranger" isn't so kind at all.  The resulting film is a well-done, tense horror story. Like many other films to come out of Australia the main story element here is the land and its mystery and as each character tries to escape they are literally swallowed up by the land. The unresolved enigma that the film presents is it's main strength; it can be seen as a metaphor for hell, the personification of true hopelessness, and a regular horror film viewer will be able to draw and appreciate many other things from it. Also much like the recent "High Tension" from France, the film is told in practically real-time as each character tries to desperately climb out of their horrifying situation and figure out what is going on, but primarily they just want to get the hell out of there.<br /><br />Director/writer Greg McLean takes an incredibly long time to set his story up, although it didn't really seem that long to me. The first two thirds of the movies unfold like a love story rather than a horror flick. The cinematography is beautiful and it's real nice to see the three main characters hanging out, having fun and falling in love with each other as they travel across the country. Those aren't your average shallow horror characters. You can identify with those people, you like them and the more you do, the more you feel uncomfortable as they descend into trouble.  The cast is surprisingly very strong; you'd be hard-pressed to find anyone looking as genuinely terrified on screen as Cassandra Magrath and Kestie Morassi. They act and react just like you'd imagine someone in their situation would. John Jarratt as the villain, however, steals the show. Again, this guy just seems so real; you could easily see yourself falling for his tricks only to wake up to him torturing you. This is no chainsaw swinging, skin wearing monster, but a seemingly regular guy that turns out to be a relentless psychopath.  Greg McLean may not re-invent the wheel with "Wolf Creek" but he manages to drive an old genre to near perfection. The movie remains unpredictable throughout and never relies on old tricks. The most disturbing thing about "Wolf Creek" is that you really feel like this could happen to you, which is quite an achievement in a genre that's usually so over the top, it makes you laugh instead of scaring you. "Wolf Creek" will achieve what your mother never could: you'll think twice about trusting helpful strangers.</p></br><a href="../users/A329U9CDUPKXAC.html">A329U9CDUPKXAC</a><br/><p>This movie took way too long to get going. It didn't really seem to have a story until the crazy old dude entered in. But once that happens it's a good old fashion killing spree. The characters follow in horror movie tradition by doing the dumbest things possible like going back to the killer's house after they already escaped. They did that to get a car but instead take the time to look at photographs and watch movies. Oh, and venture down into a hole filled with dead bodies. It's so stupid but things like that have to happen. So I loved it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FUBUJAIGM87T.html">A3FUBUJAIGM87T</a><br/><p>In "Wolf Creek", a trio of backpacking friends decide to venture to a deserted location in the middle of nowhere to go sight-seeing. While things seem fine at first, it becomes apparent that this become a story of the wrong place at the wrong time. In the interest of not spoiling the story, suffice it to say that the movie is not what it appears to be, at least ostensibly. That being said, the movie does begin to take a dark, brutal, and morbid shape by movie's end.<br /><br />In a sense, the movie attempts to provide some light misdirection as to what the audience is seeing at first, albeit quite weakly, with a trio of friends engaging upon an adventurous trip out in the middle of a deserted Australian location. A sense of desolation, isolation and desertedness becomes apparent to the audience, and the viewer is able to understand that if something happens to a person in this type of place, the prevailing thought will be, who's going to know or do anything about it? The desolate setting is a precursor of things to come in this movie and sets the tone for the despondency and dejection the protagonists will eventually experience in this deserted part of the country.<br /><br />"Wolf Creek" delves into the horror of becoming captive of someone who is not what he appears to be, someone who is cruel, evil and hateful, but appears to be nice, helpful and a good ole boy at first...this is effective in showing the audience that people are not always what they appear to be.<br /><br />The protagonists or supposedly good characters in this movie ultimately experience the feeling of being powerless to control their own life while being subject to the disgusting and bestial pleasures of a maniacal killer out in the middle of nowhere and there is no one to help them. Imagine being unconscious and waking up confined in an unfamiliar location without the friends you were with originally and not knowing of their whereabouts or their well-being. Imagine hearing or observed the pure suffering of one of those friends at the hands of someone you thought was going to help you. These are the ideas of horror that "Wolf Creek" utilizes quite effectively by putting the viewer in the position of the characters which is certainly realistic and terrifying with the character's individual situation in and of itself.<br /><br />The acting is average at best in "Wolf Creek". John Jarret does an OUTSTANDING job (and really makes the movie good) as the villain; Jarret is clever at showing that monsters do not always appears to be monsters at first but appear just like everyday normal people, and he certainly does well for the Australian theme and setting. However, the protagonists (even if they are ordinary) are somewhat poorly casted and they are not very good actors, and that does bring the movie down a bit in my opinion because the protagonists are difficult to sympathize with except for the dark haired girl who did a decent job I guess, and their inept acting ability as a whole is a direct result of the audience's inability to sympathize with such characters. Aside from that, these protagonists are just a unlikeable lot, and difficult to relate to--at least for my generation.  But, perhaps that's just it, a generation gap...alas, I digress.<br /><br />Certainly, "Wolf Creek" breaks all of the horror movie rules so you never know what to expect, and this is most definitely a good thing. However, "Wolf Creek" fails to do enough with the horror that it initially creates. The setting is good, but once the viewer realizes the situation, the action that follows is completely overshadowed by the setting and situational horror used so well to set things up. In other words, the movie begins to go downhill in the subsequent action...the acting is definitely lacking, and as I alluded to above, the protagonist characters are rather difficult to sympathize with and they don't do a very good job of portraying the character's human reactions and emotions to such an ordeal.<br /><br />The cat and mouse game that follows has its moments but is rather poorly done overall and lacking in substance and in style. Perhaps the style and mood or lack thereof is where the movie suffers the most.  However, for its faults, "Wolf Creek" does a decent job of sneaking up on you, and then it is BAMM right in your face. Clearly, "Wolf Creek" is weak on atmosphere and stylistic elements of cinematic horror, but "Wolf Creek" is definitely a good horror movie for today's standards, but one of the main problems with that statement is that today's horror movies have no standards.<br /><br />Relative to classic horror movies of yesteryear and some of the greatest horror movies of all-time, "Wolf Creek" clearly fails to measure up, but "Wolf Creek" is still a good situational horror film representative of new age horror at its very best, possesses its own charm and survives on its own merit as a horror movie that attempts to attack a basic fear that we all have as individuals, that of being in helpless in an unfamiliar area with no one to help you and completely at the mercy (or lack thereof) of a maniacal and sadistic killer. That's pretty real folks, and "Wolf Creek" does a decent job of bringing this home to the audience. "Wolf Creek" earns almost THREE STARS on my grading scale, but I'm feeling like Santa Claus today, so keep that in mind when reading this review.<br /><br />As a final note, "Wolf Creek" is supposed to be based (probably very loosely) on the true story of a brutal and sadistic killer in Australia some years ago. I saw a supposedly real picture of this killer online after looking this story up, and the way he looked in real life made John Jarret look like Santa Claus. Also, personally, I should point out that I found the ending of "Wolf Creek" to be a bit anticlimactic and disappointing, and this has noting to do with the dark nature of the ending but more to do with the ending and climax being overshadowed by the increasing action and initial setting of the situational horror that is employed so well in "Wolf Creek".</p></br><a href="../users/A2HJZ2KN9YA9L2.html">A2HJZ2KN9YA9L2</a><br/><p>One of the most tedious movies released last year.  The first 45 minutes are devoted to watching a group of attractive young 20 somethings get drunk at a pool party.  It may be exciting to those who thrive on Reality TV, but no clear sense of any personality emerges from any of the characters at the party.  We just hear generic banal chatter, see them get plastered and dive into the pool.  Three of the partiers then go on a drive, stopping off at one of those creepy gas stations that only exist in horror movies, before making their way to this really cool crater.<br /><br />I loved this crater.  That crater was big, it was impressive.  If I ever go to Australia I want to visit that crater.  It was neat and litererally the only thing impressive about this movie.<br /><br />Sad to say, they leave the crater, return to the car which won't start, get a tow from a guy who sounds like Crocodile Dundee, and then do all kinds of wildly stupid things that leads to them getting killed.<br /><br />About the time they were getting towed I got bored and watched the rest of the movie in fast forward.<br /><br />When they started getting killed I tried reverting to regular play, only to find that the movie was still too slow, so I speeded it up again.  Even the stabbings are too slow in this picture.  Didn't the director watch Psycho?  Doesn't he know how to kill people and make it exciting?<br /><br />Apparently not.<br /><br />I cannot help but compare this to other movies about doomed tourists.  The best of which has to be An American Werewolf in London.  That movie opens up with an unsubtle visual metaphor of the heroes riding in the back of a truck filled with sheep -- lambs to the slaughter -- not to mention the fact that these are smart, funny guys whom the audience can immediately like.<br /><br />Then there's the more recent Hostel, a gruesome chiller that moves, even if the characters aren't quite as likable as American Werewolf in London.<br /><br />All in all, what can be said about a movie where the actors are upstaged by a hole in the ground?<br /><br />That is one dull movie.<br /><br />But a very cool crater.</p></br><a href="../users/A5UMUVEV1RUS9.html">A5UMUVEV1RUS9</a><br/><p>I'm halfway between 3 1/2 and 4 stars for Wolf Creek. Despite being a low budget production, the scenery shots are quite stunning. But as for people calling it gory, it wasn't that gory. Perhaps that's because I just saw Hostel before watching Wolf Creek or perhaps it takes a whole lot more gross-out to officially freak me out. Regardless, Wolf Creek is enjoyable and I should warn you to be prepared to wait a little bit for the set-up. But once it gets going, it is pretty creepy. 2 girls and a guy are making their way across Australia when they stop at a place called Wolf Creek. But when they go to leave, of course the car won't start. Enter a man from the Outback who  seems as friendly and charming as Crocodile Dundee. He offers to help them out and gives them a tow, but of course in grand scary movie tradition, this "bloke" is more than just a smidge unbalanced. One of the best things I can say for Wolf Creek is that I thought a certain outcome was evident (and to tell you would ruin it) but I was caught off guard. The atmosphere is creepy and certainly gives you that freaked out feeling you hope to attain from movies in this genre. Not bad at all, and although not the best out there, it's very enjoyable and a change of pace from the American fare. Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/AYWAY5MKLAITN.html">AYWAY5MKLAITN</a><br/><p>Although the following is based on a true story, I found no original, film wise, creative plot points.<br /><br />The movie takes place in australia where three friends go to wolf creek. Of course, like all thrillers, they find themselves stranded and with no hope of getting back to their place. But, along comes a friend, supposedly, to help them.<br /><br />Some critics said that it was like Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Somewhat. I can somewhat agree on that but as for the tone, style, mood, and cinema style; it's all been done before. This film, in my opinion, would have done much better as a short film or as a documentary. But to watch this movie is to watch the same stuff that's already out there. Yes, there is tension and there is suspense but the movie is Highly, highly, highly, highly predictable.<br /><br />I will say, that the villian did present himself truly. He wasn't flat or 2-demensional but, still, the movie's situations just scream "Rewrite."<br /><br />Final Verdict: Wolf creek is worth renting but not worth owning.</p></br><a href="../users/A27CHILBK6HIL2.html">A27CHILBK6HIL2</a><br/><p>Here we go. Another entry into the teen horror genre, this time brought to us from down under. The movie tells the tale of three friends venturing out on a road trip to visit Wolf Creek. The opening credit montage is just vast wide shots of the outback while they drive through it, all shot with a wide angle lens. They drive their car all the way out into the middle of the outback and hike to see the massive meteor crater at the Wolf Creek hiking trail. When they come back their car doesn't start (big suprise!), and they have to spend the night. Luckily a man in a tow truck finds them and he nicely tows them back to his bachelor pad, which also happens to be in the middle of nowhere. So, he attempts to fix their car and as he works on it our protagonists fall asleep by the fire. When they wake up it's a whole different situation as they find themselves being hunted by their good tow truck Aussie friend. What follows is just pointless nonsense that is not entertaining at all.<br /><br />First of all, Ben appears to be the main character yet we don't see him for the majority of the movie. When I watched the featurette and heard the director say that he wasn't the main character I was thinking to myself "well, why did you make him appear as if he was the main character and then take him out for the entire movie until the end?". Another problem I had with the movie was it's inconsistencies with time and weather. One scene it's raining and Ben says that it'll pass in a few hours. The next seen sees Liz sitting by some rocks and it's not raining and they do no transition shots to suggest a passing of time. Also, the first time Liz wakes up and realizes she has been tied up and captured, it is dusk. The sun is starting to set and is low in the sky, and she unties herself and jumps out the window. In the time she unties herself it becomes pitch black in one minute. Then there is the whole plot of the movie, which is not scary at all and really has no logical purpose to it. This is supposedly a "true" story (what isn't these days?), but still, not everything is meant to be a film. The movie ends so abruptly, you will sit there and be like "well? Is there anything else?". It really ends in such a horrible way that it doesn't tie anything together. In fact, you feel like there is a missing second half to the film somewhere, and it isn't found in the "unrated" edition, I can tell you that. The only highlight of the film is the use of scenery to establish an atmosphere, unfortunately the score didn't support it to create a tension filled atmosphere. The music was dull and at times there were few cues that sounded exactly like Harald Kloser's score to The Day After Tomorrow. Otherwise this is an empty story that just adds another waste of time to the horror genre.<br /><br />I think the problem with horror films these days is the lack of attention to character development. All the cheap gore driven horror films we see these days are usually between 90-105 minutes in length. They quickly jump into all the death and gore, and you know what? No one cares for the characters. The acting in the film was just not anything special. Any actor could have played these empty roles, all the roles call for are wide eyed facial expressions and the ability to cry and scream. The film is trash and is not entertaining. I sometimes wonder to myself if we'll ever see another masterpiece of horror like The Shining, The Exorcist, or Rosemary's Baby.</p></br><a href="../users/A363QRXP83K8ZE.html">A363QRXP83K8ZE</a><br/><p>Wolf Creek definitely makes a go at being a fresh, new take on a sorta-slasher movie.  For one, it's Australian, so not quite as chained to the Hollywood conventions and necessities.  On the other hand, it's a bit uneven and is then only remembered as another lovely outing in the serial killer / torture / sadism / shock genre.<br /><br />A group of backpackers (two girls and a guy) take a trip to the Australian outback.  Eventually, they come in contact with a Crocodile Dundee-type outbacker guy who turns out to be a complete psycho who likes to kidnap, torture, and murder people, sometimes paralyzing and mutilating them for the audience, too.<br /><br />We then get the now-classic escape by the lone girl (or is it the guy?) sequence in which someone witnesses bad, awful things happening (like torture), escapes, fights and wounds the bad guy, escapes, fights more, etc, etc, etc.  Adjust the level of nihilism and you get a slightly different ending each time, but still the same dark message: you will die, no matter what.  This time, the message is infused with some truly stunning outdoor photography, a bit more character development that I can't recall, and a lack of deep character development (of madman Mick) that I DO recall since it was effectively played and spooky.  A few creepy moments to be sure, but few of them involve blood and gore, which is sporadic but not wall-to-wall.  No, Wolf Creek is a drawn out exercise in terror that gets pretty demented and depraved, but is only memorable by its (straight down) story arc.  No ridiculous plot twist ala the also-foreign High Tension, but nothing really new.<br /><br />The DVD has a few extras but nothing very enlightening about the film, though overall the release looks amazing in parts with its shots of the outback.  Almost two movies in some ways, the plot about the backpackers themselves, the atmosphere, and the photography are largely wasted once the mayhem begins.  It doesn't make the stalking more terrifying to know this much mundane detail about these people (like they drink, and smoke, and have relations, etc, etc).  Effects fans may enjoy some of the work simulating a real insane killer's skills.  Reviled by some critics, hailed by others, that's the type of film it is...either it's a repugnant, sick movie, or an effective, terrifying warning.<br /><br />No doubt a Wolf Creek 2 awaits one day, because life in these times wouldn't be complete without another film detailing the exact methods of torture used on random people by a serial killer in the Australian outback, perhaps they can top the 'head on a stick' bit here.  Used in Vietnam by the USA, reminds the Aussies!</p></br><a href="../users/A2NUHWMHA9XNKV.html">A2NUHWMHA9XNKV</a><br/><p>I don't know if they wanted us to get to know the characters but my thoughts on it taking so long to get into was a little crazy but towards the end on my reveiw meter i would put the arrow between ok/good...<br /><br />Its watchable if you can stand the first hour or so of the movie....</p></br><a href="../users/A5TZXWU8AALIC.html">A5TZXWU8AALIC</a><br/><p>I have a point in these gruesome "torture porn" movies where I bail on them and shut them off.<br /><br />When the victim somehow frees himself-but-it's-usually-herself and momentarily gets the upper hand on the psycho killer, they hit/stab/shoot/incapacitate the killer...and then run away.  Now the psycho killer has terrorized the victim, viciously murdered the second or third banana in the cast in front of them, and--these days--sawed off a toe or finger or ear or limb...but the victim will knock down the psycho and run away, leaving the psycho to gather his wits and come after them again.<br /><br />That happens in WOLF CREEK, another exercise in depressing sadism.  The surviving girls knock out the psycho killer (with a shovel, I think) and try to run away.  Just once I'd like to see a movie where the victim goes all kinds of crazy on the psycho with that shovel or club or whatever blunt instrument they use and make really sure he isn't coming after them again.<br /><br />But this is just another tedious movie where young women are tortured and menaced by some gleeful maniac.  These movies have gotten progressively worse since the original TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE and HALLOWEEN.  Considered grindhouse drive-in trash back then, those two films are now the artistic classics compared to the monthly schlock foisted on us by Hollywood these days.<br /><br />Where are we at when we're using "tedious" and "torture" in the same sentence?</p></br><a href="../users/A2G6GO4O7EVCPF.html">A2G6GO4O7EVCPF</a><br/><p>2 in a half. In Broome, Australia in 1999, two girls and one guy go on a road trip and they stop along the way in Wolf Creek where they take a gander at a large crater (pretty cool aerial shot of it by the way). Supposedly a metetor hit it (which is like 2 atomic bombs dropping). When they get back to the car, the girls notice that their watches arent working and then the car isnt working...so they are stuck there but later in the night they are helped out by a stranger, played by John Jarrett (Better Homes and Gardens, Next Of Kin), who tows their car back to his shop. One of the girls wakes up tied up and gagged. She then gets free and finds her friend being tortured by Jarret. They escaped and then they go back to look for their other friend and one of them finds out why this sicko killer does what he does. Predictable situations cloud this movie with only one uncomfortable scene (it's at the end where the guy who is kidnapped takes himself down from the wall because he's pinned to it) and there are some pretty good camera work. The Acting is ok but it turns into the typical screaming and hollering like most horror movies. Not bad for a lowbudget horror movie but it just wasnt all that great. Inspired By True Events....when isnt it? Also starring Nathan Phillips (Australian Rules, Neighbours), Cassandra Magrath (Hotel de Love, Shock Jock) and Kestie Morassi (Darkness Falls, Strange Bedfellows). There was an Emu Creek, why didnt they just visit the Emu's instead of hiking 3 hours for the big crater?</p></br><a href="../users/A2HW33PQSRHLNO.html">A2HW33PQSRHLNO</a><br/><p>Things must be in a really sorry way with the horror genre if "Wolf Creek" is the new "must see".  I thought they already made "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"; and if enough people wanted to see it done with Australian accents, I'm sure Tobe Hooper would have obliged for the right price.<br /><br />I'm sure the director didn't expect so much acclaim, as he wisely decided to play the "Based On True Events" card (it is very loosely based on two different incidents, neither of which occured in the Australian outback.)<br /><br />This isn't a terrible movie, but there is nothing in it to set it apart from a billion others of the same ilk.  Three young people who want fun fun fun wander into the wrong place and are brutalized by a psychotic killer.  The protagonists (not really protagonists, more like three pieces of convenient prey) are three Swedish backpackers who get drunk, smoke weed, swim in pools, and go on about failed romances when the Big Bad Guy comes along to deliver the inevitable message these kind of movies carry: if you take too much of a risk, you get chopped up for your daring.  The painfully long time we spend with the guy (who might have been an extra on "Jackass") and the two young women tell us little about them except that they are cut whole cloth from the stereotype of "youth" in society and are innocents who have done nothing wrong.<br /><br />The killer, Mick Taylor, is a cross between a sadistic killer, failed Elvis impersonator (those muttonchops add a bit of comedy to everything he does, however gruesome), and failed comedian.  His attempts to humorous and terrifying at the same time fail miserably with the sombre mood of the movie.<br /><br />There is one geuinely funny part, though: before he drugs the three with his special water, he takes offense at something the young guy says and gives him a rooster look as though he had been buggered by Popeye himself.  I nearly hit the theater floor laughing when that scene came up.<br /><br />More less, this is your typical slasher movie.  Greg McLean seems to be trying to a convey a sense of "the hunt" or whatever, but it falls dead in the air.  This isn't awful; it just isn't that good one way or the other.</p></br><a href="../users/A10HMPPHWI3V0A.html">A10HMPPHWI3V0A</a><br/><p>I thought that the beginning was completly pointless<br />and had absolutly no meaning, I mean think about it<br /> ... what a waste of Film .... BUT after about 45<br /> minutes of nearly falling asleep the movie finnaly<br /> took a sudden and abrupt turn for the better. I<br /> really got a good vibe from this movie, there is<br /> only a handful of movies that actually depect true<br /> horror and this is one of them. Some parts of the<br /> film actually reminded me somewhat of the Australian<br /> "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre". You could really tell<br /> from the picture quality that the film was on a<br /> tight budget but the director really did a nice job<br /> of working around that and putting together an over-<br />all good "Bad Guy" horror film ... not to shabby, not<br /> shabby at all.<br /><br />Grade: B-</p></br><a href="../users/A1COG8T9MPP3KA.html">A1COG8T9MPP3KA</a><br/><p>Based on real events. That is what it says at the beginning. However, this movie is a very overblown and improbable version. This movie is sure to stir up an urban legend about the Australian Outback, and probably this movie means to do just that. Apparently something like 10,000 people go missing every year while in remote parts of the outback. This is sure to plant the seed in people's head that a serial killer or two lurk in the outback.<br />I've got to hand it to the makers, they pulled off an edge of your seat film. Even though it is pretty ordinary stuff. Travelers take a wrong turn in an isolated area and become prey to the local looney blokes.<br />here is more on the REAL STORY:<br /> 2 tourists travel down Stuart Highway in Wolfe Creek National Park, in the Northern Territory. A  bushman tries to assist them with car trouble and ends up trying to kill them, only to kill the male while the female escapes.<br />Sure to become an urban legend on that stretch of highway for sure.<br />Oh by the way, the film is really beautifully photographed in HIGH DEF.</p></br><a href="../users/AVF60NZ99H9D5.html">AVF60NZ99H9D5</a><br/><p>But that's about it. The people you're supposed to care about come across as dingalings, so there really isn't anyone to give a damn about.<br /><br />Spoiler: At some point, after the two chicks have gotten away from the killer's bloody grasp, one of the chicks decides  they absolutely must have a car, and returns to the psycho's lair.<br /><br />Huh? Wait a minute. There is no way this would have happened in real life. They (pretty much) lost me right there.<br /><br />John Jarret's performance is pretty solid, but this was hardly enough to keep me involved.<br /><br />The behind the scenes was quite dull.<br /><br />I wanted the flick to work. Glad I borrowed it from a friend, instead of having spent money to buy it.</p></br><a href="../users/AJRFZ0VZ0LD26.html">AJRFZ0VZ0LD26</a><br/><p>I was compelled to see this movie because it is based on the true story.  Set in Australia, story follows three young people who decide to take a cross country trip in an old, used car.  They are carefree, not particularly ambitious, just seekign some fun and each other's company.<br /><br />The best part of the film is the shots of the Wolf Creek National Park that features meteorite site that is magnificent in both appearance and size.  The hike trip alone can take three hours and as it happens this seems to be a perfect pick up site of unsuspecting tourists for the serial killer.  This is not an everage killer.  He likes to torture his victims before killing them.  On the outside, he seems harmless, but there is something sinister in his laugh and amiable demeanor.<br /><br />As these young people experience car trouble and accept the offer from the local to get their car fixed (with no fee and no strings attached - how naive someone has to be to figure out that something is up?).  Before long, they are in for a gruesome experience.<br /><br />If it was not for the meterorite visuals inthis film I would have felt that I have wasted two hours of my life on this less than average movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3JLOIXFM75QNV.html">A3JLOIXFM75QNV</a><br/><p>The buildup is very slow in Wolf Creek, allowing the viewers to get to know the three central characters before things go bad for them. But even with almost an hour of buildup and establishment, I still felt no connection to the characters. The characters themselves were just not that interesting to begin with so when the action picks up, I couldn't find any pity or horror towards them.<br /><br />As for the horror part of this film, well, lets just say it is nonexistant. Perhaps for those who frighten easily, you may find this disturbing and creepy, but in reality, it wasn't all that scary or chilling. Supposedly based on a true story, it just doesn't work onscreen, especially since there were pretty much no witnesses from the original crime, so most of it feels made up, hence, making it less than frightening.<br /><br />The violence and gore are mediocre, not even remotely comparable to similar torture films, like any of the Saw films, or even Hostel, which is also slow to pick up. Again, for those squeemish people, it may be disturbing, but I felt none of that. The characters themselves suffer from the familiar clich&eacute;; doing stupid stuff in a horror movie. Some of it is eye roll inducing. There is one gag that is actually pretty sick, called 'head on a stick', which works really well in the scene, but the event leading right up to that is pretty ridiculous and disbelieving.<br /><br />The acting is pretty decent by everyone and the film has a sort of Indie look to it, but that is all it has going for it. There really is no actual plot besides the one that picks up about 3/4 of the way in. Just way too slow and lacking in actual scares and tention. There are PLENTY of slasher fics out there that are creepier than this one. Skip it.</p></br><a href="../users/APOUYO1BEPK22.html">APOUYO1BEPK22</a><br/><p>I just cant stand this movie because of the the first 3/4th's of it. I was really excited to see it on Christmas day when it opened. I went by myself and to my surprise, the movie house was packed. As the movie kept trying to build itself up and make you care about these characters, all i could pay attention to was the movie audience. It seemed just about everyone in the house was thinking what I was thinking..."What did I just pay 8 dollars to see?". Once the killing started, I still didnt care about the characters because they bored me so much, that I actually thought they deserved to die for making me waste my money.<br /><br />But.<br /><br />There was some good in this movie. The killer was fantastic and just seemed like someone you'd never want to cross. Even with a friendly joke/poke at him, he scared the crap out of me. The atmosphere during the killings was also great. Everything seemed claustrophobic to me, even though they were in the extremely huge outback. It felt like no matter what they did...there just was NO escape. The death scenes were pretty good, especially the one girl trying to get away in the car.<br /><br />Then there is one other thing that really bothered me. I thought this movie was based on actual events, which made me believe that it was based on more fact than fiction. What I mean here is, during the death scenes, I really felt tense cause I usually picture myself in that situation. But at the end, the person that makes it out finally, never saw ANY of the death. And they also said the bodies were never found nor was the killer. So it was all made up. That dissapointed me and just was the last straw for me.<br /><br />Out of 5 stars I'd give it a 1. The death scenes were cool, but the rest of the movie was just plain bad.</p></br><a href="../users/ANBQIWHO9JRFS.html">ANBQIWHO9JRFS</a><br/><p>As per usual, there have been a great many moronic things said about this movie.  Some critics have been offended by it, but don't let that make you think this is some sorta gorefest.  The violence is intense and reasonably graphic, but it's certainly not gory in the conventional sense.  I find it amusing that those who were offended by the film have more or less said that it was too horrifying, cause ya know, god forbid that someone actually be horrified by a horror movie.  They've also said it is misogynistic, just like they've said about every other slasher movie ever. (Slasher movie isn't entirely appropriate for describing this, but it's as good as we'll get.)  This is a particularly irritating complaint, first because they always say this, second because it's a bullcrap non-argument evasion intended to avoid any real analysis, and finally because it isn't true.  In fact, it's even less true here than it usually is, cause the film doesn't make the killer into the hero.  Yes, bad things happen to the women in this film, but we AREN'T supposed to be happy about it.  And, of course, very bad things happen to men in the film as well, but who the hell cares about them anyway? Everyone knows that women are much, much more important than men.  I also think it's interesting that the killer is a fat, greasy dude from out in the country, as they so often are in this sorta movie, yet it has not been accused of being bigoted against rural people, nor has any horror movie I've ever heard of.  What a bizarre coincidence.  Wonder why critics don't seem to care about those sorts of people.  Maybe they really think that they all are killers. I dunno.<br /><br />But, critical idiocy aside, this is a very nicely done horror film.  The plot is simplicity itself- 3 youths are captured and tormented by a backwoods psychopath while vacationing near Wolf Creek in Australia.  Subplots are rarely of interest in slasher films, and 'Wolf Creek' fortunately has none of them.  Still, with the very small cast we get to know these characters quite a bit better than we usually would in a slasher film, and they are certainly far more likable than the hot young teens of the American slasher revival.  (Of course that doesn't mean much, as said hot young teens are usually loathsome.)<br /><br />'Wolf Creek' was really made on the cheap, only about 1 million bucks, I hear, and it's certainly got a rough, gritty look.  Some people claim that grainy, DV films with handheld cameras are more realistic, which makes precisely no sense as life is not especially grainy, and I tend to hold my head fairly still. However, this technique can allow for a greater sorta intensity and physicality, which works well here.  Despite the generally rough visuals, it's still got some rather beautiful cinematography at times, and the great Australian deserts are a fine backdrop for such events.<br /><br />Yeah, the film does take a while to get going, certainly longer than is necessary, but seriously, are you guys all 3 years old or what?  Go out in the lobby and drink your juice and then go potty, and then it'll almost be time for the killing to start.  The acting is extremely good for a film with this kinda budget.  The 3 leads all do a fine job, with some fairly authentic, if not exactly fascinating, casual banter in the first half of the film.  Still, the second half is much more important, and they play it a bit different from most horror films, which is largely why this bothers so many critics.  In most horror movies, none of the characters are ever authentically terrified.  They're pretty nervous and jumpy and may let out a scream before they die, but they're pretty much in control.  Not so here, as Magrath and Morassi spend much of the latter part of the movie in near hysterics, and are utterly convincing, with two of the finest performances of this sort since Marilyn Burns' classic turn in the original 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre'.  John Jarrat is also excellent as the killer.  They use a trick which is fairly common, in that we are introduced to him as if he were a normal character, who seems amiable enough, if a bit odd, and we then slowly see his violent side revealed.  It's an old trick, but a good one, and it works especially well here, aided by his Australian accent, which are always inherently non-threatening to me, for some reason.  He does get to be a bit wisecracking at times, but never to the point which he becomes the hero of the film.<br /><br />Many will say this has an anticlimactic ending, and while I can't help but agree with this to some degree, it's also kind of interesting in that it is so different from what you'd usually see in this sorta film.  The small cast also makes it quite a bit less predictable, as most slasher movies have the few central characters who will obviously survive, along with plenty of cannon fodder.  With only 3 main characters there just aren't enough people to allow any meaningless little kills stuffed in at the beginning, and it's tougher to predict the order in which they will be offed.<br /><br />Though I'm sure many of you are sick of hearing this, `Wolf Creek' really is a throwback to the more intense horror films of the 70's like `The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' and `The Hills Have Eyes'.  It's got an intensity and seriousness that is almost inevitably lacking from later slasher movies, and the old rough and violent feeling.  As such, it certainly isn't for everyone, as many people seem to only like gentle, feel-good horror or conventional gorefests.  But, it you've got a taste for something darker and more intense, `Wolf Creek' is definitely worth a look.<br /><br />Grade: A-  (This is after watching it again on DVD, and determining that it was even better than I'd thought initially.  I'd change the rating to a 5, if I could.)</p></br><a href="../users/A268EEWUXYCA8Q.html">A268EEWUXYCA8Q</a><br/><p>The thing about horror movie conventions is that you get stuck following them.  You get so used to them that you either figure the movie out before it even gets going or you might be scared but you're really simply going through the motions.  Then comes a movie that plays with conventions and, at times, decimates them.  You're no longer in your comfort zone.  You no longer know what's going to happen.  Wolf Creek is kind of like that movie.<br /><br />It begins slowly as a road trip film.  A great deal of the beginning is spent on developing characters (shock!  What a novel concept!).  At times it might drag a bit, but really its all set up.  A lot of negative reviewers have commented that its boring.  I guess in today's society of instant gratification I shouldn't be surprised...but I think the slower start works well for this movie.  There are a couple scenes setting up a feeling of unease in your stomach.  But what the beginning does really well is set you at ease before destroying that ease with one of the cruelest villains seen in today's horror film culture.<br /><br />What happens when the scares start is out of a nightmare.  I'm not going to say anything else about the plot because in the way it plays with conventions, there are some nice little twists in the plot.  It keeps you on your toes.  In fact, if you are an avid horror film buff, you will probably enjoy this movie the most simply because of the way it continues to crush horror film cliches and conventions.  I think that's what impressed me the most about this movie.  As a horror film buff, I sat there and watched in glee as things that normally happen in a horror film were turned on its head.  Also, like a fellow reviewer has mentioned, with a cast of 3 protagonists, there really is no "cannon fodder."  And you never know who will survive and who won't.  I really want to talk more about it but it will ruin some of the little twists that really make this film what it is.<br /><br />The movie is very dark in tone.  It reminded me of the feel of High Tension (another great horror film this year).  The gore isn't as over the top as High Tension which helps ground the film in the possible territory.  And Australia is the perfect location for this film.  The scenes of complete isolation and utter desolation; the kind where you don't know which way is which.  Its disorienting in a way that many horror films try to capture but never fully express.  Some scenes toward the end are so bleak and disorienting you can't help but feel lost and wondering if you were stranded out there what WOULD you do?<br /><br />This has been an "interesting" year for horror films.  On one hand there have been a ton of PG-13 horror films that have catered to the safe and money-making teen crowd.  These films offer mainly the "boo" scare with the loud music and close ups.  The kind of movie people shriek at because they are surprised, then spend the next ten minutes laughing about it.  And there have been a few movies that have been "throw backs" to the 1970/early 80s horror/gore flicks; the really in your face flicks that at one time defined what horror was.<br /><br />One of them took all of the bad parts of those films (The Devil's Rejects) and left out all of the good.  This film did the exact opposite.  What films like The Devil's Rejects forget is that violence for violence's sake does not instill terror.  However, when you care about the characters, like in the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre and in this film, the violence gets under your skin.  It gets into your head and you find yourself holding your breath that everyone makes it out okay...but knowing full well its not that kind of story.<br /><br />Wolf Creek: a must see.</p></br><a href="../users/AIIR8E34EDKCQ.html">AIIR8E34EDKCQ</a><br/><p>I chose to see this movie after a dinner with some girls from work, and perhaps this Horror is not for everyone, we all got creped out and totally engrossed in the story line.<br /><br />Shot in what felt like real life cinematography it felt so raw and real I had to remind myself to breathe while the story unfolded. I liked how the cast was small and very likable, and although the beginning unfolded slowly we got to know and like Liz, Kristy and Ben more, until I remembered that this was not going to be a pretty movie and I had a huge knot in my throat thinking about what was laying ahead for them.<br /><br />The are simple young kids backpacking through Australia when they visit the Wolf Creek National Park, and spend some time at the Crater, which is a tourist attraction while in the middle of nowhere. Their troubles start when their watches and the car stop working, and they have to rely on a friendly local to help them out. Unfortunately the friendly local has other intentions about their future and they are gruesome. I was shocked while watching half the scenes; this movie really stays in your head, days after you see it. Perhaps because the kids are so nice and likable and real and when bad things happen it's like watching yourself in this situation.<br /><br />I really liked this movie because it reminded me of books such as Intensity by Dean R. Koontz, where you had a young person or more, trying to survive a deadly game with a lunatic killer who is insanely hard to outwit.<br /><br />The major plusses of the movie were that the cast was small and let me tell you, they were not spared close encounters and even death, but you must watch for yourself to see how that unfolds. All I can say it that when you saw the struggle and pain and thought a certain person was safe, only the worst happened over and over. This movie grabs you slowly, but then it sucks you in like a tornado. I loved this low budget flick and I will definitely hold it above many Hollywood productions. If you love horror, then you will love this, no iffs and buts about that!</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZOF747O5EB6R.html">A1ZOF747O5EB6R</a><br/><p>Let there be no mistake, "Wolf Creek" is of the true crime genre.  It is not a movie for the faint hearted.  Reasonably explicit acts of violence are part of the story.<br /><br />"Wolf Creek" is said to be based on a true story.  This may be stretching the truth a bit.  There are probably two cases which are points of reference.  The first is the so-called back packer murderer, Ivan Milat, who is currently doing a life term in a high security prison near Sydney.  The second is the Peter Falconio case where the man in question has gone missing presumed murdered with a defendant currently in the dock.  Both cases were particularly gruesome.<br /><br />John Jarrett plays the murderer in "Wolf Creek" and he personifies evil.  He is a serial killer who shows neither remorse nor any sign of slowing down.  His technique is generally the same.  He acts to assist travellers who have broken down in the outback before drugging them and then moving on to rape and murder.  For many people, travel in the outback will never be the same after watching this film.<br /><br />Regardless, the film is well worth watching.  The plot is plausible as are the characters.  However, as already mentioned, the scenes are violent and upsetting.  If such violence takes you beyond your comfort zone, avoid the film.  Walking out in disgust, as same patrons have done, is little more than a display of ignorance.</p></br><a href="../users/A3W13VVBRY5GL7.html">A3W13VVBRY5GL7</a><br/><p>Kristy, Ben and Liz are three fast friends (he's Australian, they're British tourists) who decide that yes, of course it's a good idea to drive a beat-up old station wagon halfway across the Australian desert to see Wolf Creek crater, one of the most impressive meteoric craters in the world. Along with their inevitable auto breakdown comes rescue in the shape of friendly-yet-strange Mick Taylor, a bushwhacker with plenty of auto parts and a slightly aggressive desire to assist them in their hour of need.<br /><br />The most noticable thing about the first segment of 'Wolf Creek' is the slowness of the pace - this movie does take quite a while (some forty minutes) before the real subject matter is dealt with, but thanks to the quality of the acting and the really excellent, fresh direction, this long build-up doesn't drag.<br /><br />As Kirsty and Liz, Kestie Morassi and Cassandra MaGrath turn in likeable and convincing performances as two backpackers in search of fun, and don't really suffer from the 'civilian-turned-superwoman' syndrome of so many contemporary horror movies. Nathan Phillips as Ben gives a similarly decent turn in his role, and, while his part is considerably smaller, it's no less pivotal to the movie. John Jarratt as Mick Taylor is excellent; he's a malevolent and realistic version of Freddy Krugger, and the superb contrast between placidity and violence that Jarratt portrays make this one of the tightest, most effective movie villains for many years.<br /><br />Direction is gorgeous - using a very dark, washed-out palette, Greg McLean builds on his previous directorial success with award-winning short 'ICQ' by creating a visual atmosphere that's both incredibly strong and very, very subtle. The intense melancholia of the daytime scenes is nicely balanced with the artfully-shot violence and the whole piece comes off as very polished and very, very convincing.<br /><br />The fact that this is a movie based on a true story does help its rating, though - were this simply a standalone horror movie, it would be a solid three-star effort. This isn't the fault of the actors or the director, who all do superb jobs. Rather, in terms of content, not a whole lot happens here that's particularly memorable. Once the movie is over you still find yourself waiting for the real punch and muscle behind the picture; sadly, this never arrives. The ending is great, and totally unexpected for a film in this genre, but there is an overall sense of something missing from it.<br /><br />Still, while you're in the middle of it, 'Wolf Creek' is certainly a gripping and worthwhile film.<br /><br />Recommended highly for rental.</p></br><a href="../users/AK1OBVI54SY73.html">AK1OBVI54SY73</a><br/><p>A lot of people were making this out to be truly and utterly scary...and I don't see it. I hardly was scared in this film- grossed out yes sometimes but not scared. And this movie was claimed as gorey when it wasn't even that. Don't believe that fellow readers it is hardly gorey. Yet that's a good thing for me because I hate movies that overdo the gore. Yes the point is the movie did not keep me on the edge of my seat, mainly because in the beginning it dragged somewhat and made me grow bored. The movie lost points in the beginning definitely.<br /><br />Now when they finally get put into this old sick man's world then you get worried for the kids who are obviously in deep danger so this gets you interested in how they will survive and constantly are yelling to the screen to run or other things like that.<br /><br />Yet somehow the movie still wasn't amazing. Maybe it's the way it was acted out(the actors are not too amazing), maybe the plot I felt could have been written better- and overall I think my deep disappointment was the end. That wasn't much of an ending, and you don't really know what happened truly and a lot of the movie isn't nothing but a story it merely was a drawing on the aspects on many of the backpack murders that's all. A lot of people like the movie better assuming this is a truly what happened to these kids, when it isn't. There isn't much you can know of what happened, that's what the end tells you mainly. Like someone else said it is a poor showing of what really happened and that's what overall hurt the movie to me. It just wasn't amazing- just an average horror/ thriller and that's all. You want to try it out, go ahead, but don't be surprised if it doesn't live up to the hype people such as Quentin Tarantino puts it up to.</p></br><a href="../users/A2J57EQ9KPGXR9.html">A2J57EQ9KPGXR9</a><br/><p>DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE IF YOU ARE TIRED.<br /><br />There, you've been warned...<br /><br />Wolf Creek is one of the most boring and slow horror dramas to come out in the last few years. What's worse, it portrays itself as some nifty little horror film but it is just a "dumb kids do stupid stuff and wind up getting killed" type of slasher flick.<br /><br />Halfway through the film, I was rooting for the killer or another meteor to come crashing down on top of the lame characters in this ode to boredom. Take a pass on this one.</p></br><a href="../users/A15Q9YEG1XPEJN.html">A15Q9YEG1XPEJN</a><br/><p>Wolf Creek may be based on a true story, but it still doesn't make the first half of this film any more watcheable. The entire first half of the film could have been edited down to about two scenes and thus cut out useless and boring expositional material.<br /><br />Two British girls and an Aussie boy, all decent, if not snarky but not particularly bad, travel across the outback of Australia (why I don't remember being told) to get to a town inland. In a story not unreminscent of "The Hills Have Eyes" and "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" they come to a bad end.<br /><br />The second half of the film isn't particularly unique although it is filmed well and the acting isn't horrible. However, the script, maybe in an effort to prove its "Blair Witch" "reality" credentials, doesn't inform us about some of the background information on our killer that would make this film more frightening. We just know the killer's been at it a long time and no one has ever stopped him.<br /><br />Still, it's not as emotionally taxing as "Chainsaw Massacre", which let us become emotionally invested in the characters without almost an hour of very boring expositional material. I recommend fast forwarding this DVD until the three kids actually reach "Wolf Creek" at night. Even then, it doesn't really get moving for about another fifteen minutes, but at least you'll be caught up.<br /><br />And you thought movies from the 1970's took forever to get to the scary parts....</p></br><a href="../users/A2PN7Z2VTHICL8.html">A2PN7Z2VTHICL8</a><br/><p>If you want to watch a tiresome dialogue between three young adults before and after climbing into a car to do some camp traveling, then by all means grab this movie.  But when forty-five minutes pass and there has not been one drop of blood or any evidence of upcoming chills, its time to eject and chalk it off to wishful thinking.<br /><br />After waiting far too long for something scary or gory to happen, along comes an Australian Outback Redneck with a tow truck to drive our boring camp party to their deaths.  The movie was based on a true story where a group of kids disappear without a trace in the Outback.  I can see the writer's scratching the bald spots on their heads, flakes of dandruff fluttering down around the crumpled papers on their desk, asking each other, "So what happened to them?"  "Well, let's just keep the lead-in going until we figure something out."<br /><br />There is no suspense, boring dialogue, no feeling of creeping dread, a lot of driving and/or running about at night, very little blood or gore (with the exception a finger-chopping), and no surprises.  The characterizations were too obvious, even the redneck was far too typical to feel like a threat.  The only shivers I got from 'Wolf Creek' were the mounting feelings of dread stemming from the fact that I had actually paid to rent it.<br /><br />To the performer's credit, the acting, while far from spectacular, was okay.  There is also one very good line in the movie, "Head On A Stick."  This is referring to one of the girls when her spinal cord is severed (shown abstractly, not graphically -- the finger scene was worse).  The writer that came up with that line should be the only one to get paid for this piece of cinematic tripe.<br /><br />My recommendation: if you are curious, use a free coupon to rent it.  Don't pay any money to watch this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GANR9I6XHTU9.html">A2GANR9I6XHTU9</a><br/><p>They say this is a true story but I wouldnt count on it. Now I dont doubt something like this happened but i assume they guessed most of the story due to the circumstances. Think about it for a second...the last camper who manages to survive and live to tell 'the story' never even witnessed his friends deaths nor saw any of what took place. They just assumed what happened because the bodies were never found. My Second problem with this film is how the killer kept popping up oh so conveniently when the timing was correct. For instance, the scene where the girl leaves her friend and ends up in the garage, theres many cars there, she chooses one and gets in and it just so happens the killer is in that one waiting to kill her. Plus how the hell did he get back to the garage so quick and just so happened to be waiting for her in that exact car she chose.<br /><br />Plot- setting, Western Australia, 2 brit girls and one aussie guy decide to go backpacking at a place called Wolf Creek. Very slow moving for the first 50 minutes. The girls & guy end up climbing wolf creek , they come back down , go to the car and the thing is dead. They notice lights approaching and a car pull up and out walks an old aussie guy. Turns out the guy is a whacko then the typical horror movie scenes ensue.<br /><br />Ive seen many many horror films. There is nothing new or novel about this film. Ive sat through Citizen Kane and I still think this film is boring. It dragged on and on then when the killer finally lost it , it still wasnt that great. There is really not too much to say about this film other than it was average run of the mill horror.<br /><br />If you want to see a good horror film try The Original Texas Chainsaw Massacre or if you are interested in seeing a new film that was actually good check out High Tension or Funny Games. They make this film look like Bambi.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R36DZQEWNVJ1.html">A3R36DZQEWNVJ1</a><br/><p>In Broome, Australia in 1999, two girls and one guy go on a road trip and they stop along the way in Wolf Creek where they take a gander at a large crater (pretty cool aerial shot of it by the way). Supposedly a metetor hit it (which is like 2 atomic bombs dropping). When they get back to the car, the girls notice that their watches arent working and then the car isnt working...so they are stuck there but later in the night they are helped out by a stranger, played by John Jarrett (Better Homes and Gardens, Next Of Kin), who tows their car back to his shop. One of the girls wakes up tied up and gagged. She then gets free and finds her friend being tortured by Jarret. They escaped and then they go back to look for their other friend and one of them finds out why this sicko killer does what he does. Predictable situations cloud this movie with only one uncomfortable scene (it's at the end where the guy who is kidnapped takes himself down from the wall because he's pinned to it) and there are some pretty good camera work. The Acting is ok but it turns into the typical screaming and hollering in any horror movie.  The movie it started out ok but then it ended. Inspired By True Events....when isnt it? Also starring Nathan Phillips (Australian Rules, Neighbours), Cassandra Magrath (Hotel de Love, Shock Jock) and Kestie Morassi (Darkness Falls, Strange Bedfellows). There was an Emu Creek, why didnt they just visit the Emu's instead of hiking 3 hours for the big crater?</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDZNPO7U4E6N.html">A1CDZNPO7U4E6N</a><br/><p>I'm in disbelief about how many people are raving about this movie. Quite frankly, this movie deserves no stars not even 1. I thought it was absolutely terrible. For one thing, let me just say, for the first hour NOTHING! happens. It doesn't pick up at all until almost the end, and even then it's just mediocre at best. I was nodding off in the theatre waiting for some action and NOTHING! happened. There are only 4 people in the entire movie 1 being the killer and 3 being the victims. It had no point or reasoning behind it. It followed every other slasher/stalker movie cliche in the teen horror genre even though it's suppose to be based on true events. Needless to say, I felt robbed, disappointed, and I wasted an hour and 45 minutes of my life.</p></br><a href="../users/ABP69F7LFTI1R.html">ABP69F7LFTI1R</a><br/><p>Formula filled, nothing new, except the kids in this movie that get chopped up are the most stupid idiots I've ever seen.

Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>"Wolf Creek" is one of the most brutal splatter slicks I have ever seen.  I watched it during the daylight with the shades up and that did nothing to mitigate the bad parts of this one.  If you are tired of horror films that wimp out and/or rely too much on special effects, then this 2005 effort from Down Under is for you.  If you watch horror films for the cathartic experience, then stay away from this one, because once you climb down into the abyss on this one you do not really get back out the whole way.  Not even close.<br /><br />Liz Hutner (Cassandra Magrath), Kristy Earl (Kestie Morassi), and Ben Mitchell (Nathan Phillips) are a trio of young adults who decide to go hiking in the remote but scenic Wolf Creek National Park in the Australian Outback.  On the way there they stop at a roadhouse and Ben has a run in with a mean looking customer, which is the sort of thing that does not bode well for young people in splatter flicks.  But these three have no idea.  It takes a while for things to start going wrong and a bit longer to get to the point where the bad things start happening and start building in intensity.<br /><br />In the featurette on the DVD McLean talks about wanting his serial killer, Mick Taylor (John Jarratt) to be an Australian icon and a counterpart to Freddie and Jason.  But Mick's humor ring hollow compared to Freddie because he is not a supernatural being and his victims are not stupid, oversexed teenagers who are killed in creative ways that allow you to take perverse pleasure in their deaths.  Mick takes out people the old fashioned way, with a knife and a high powered rifle.  "Wolf Creek" does not allow any buffers between you and the violence.  This guy is a sick bastard.  He is not particularly inventive when it comes to hurting people, he is just brutally effective in what he does.<br /><br />For many viewers the fact that is takes a while for things to start happening in this one will be sufficient reason to knock down the rating one star.  Not much happens in the first half of this film and it is not like the character development of Liz, Kristy and Ben is all that important.  But for me the part where I did the deduction comes when the victims have their best chance to get out alive.  Now, if there is one thing we have learned from these splatter flicks it is that the killer is down but never out.  When you get them down, do not stop, do not pass go, and do not go running off so they can chase you down.  Do whatever you need to in order to take them out.  Given that premise, if you have an empty gun and are precluded from shooting them, then it should be obvious where to hit them.  Unfortunately, that proves to be too obvious for the characters in this movie.  Still, the ending does not play out the way you would expect and there is a rather interesting shell game when it comes to who is the hero, which earns bonus points.<br /><br />I was curious as to what exactly were the true events on which "Wolf Creek" was based, because for all I knew it could be the statistics thrown at you in the beginning of the movie regarding how many people are lost in Australia each year.  But it turns out there is the case of Ivan Milat, a serial killer who was convicted for what are called the "Backpacker Murders" in Australia, and last year Bradley John Murdoch was convicted for killing a British backpacker.  Of course these simply serve as an inspiration for writer-director Greg McLean the way Ed Gein inspired "Psycho" and "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre."  Besides, the question with splatter flicks is never whether they are true, but whether they come across as being real, and this one is ahead on that score at the end.</p></br><a href="../users/A37OOQQLMMKYR8.html">A37OOQQLMMKYR8</a><br/><p>WOLF CREEK<br /><br />**** ? Out of 5<br /><br />Release Date- December 25th, 2005<br /><br />Running Time- 104-Minutes<br /><br />Rating- R<br /><br />Writer/Director- Greg McLean<br /><br />Starring- Cassandra Magrath, Kestie Morassi, Nathan Phillips and John Jarratt as Mick Taylor<br /><br />Wolf Creek has mostly received a passing grade from horror fans, but the biggest complaint is Wolf Creek is too slow and that sort of bothers me. Too many people complain that horror movies have become more about violence and gore and not enough set ups on the characters and that is where Wolf Creek strays from what the genre has become. Writer/Director Greg McLean could have taken the easy way out and loaded the movie with violence and gore rather than character development and had faceless victims in a faceless movie.<br /><br />But instead of being filled with a body count there are only three main characters and half the movie is focused on them and it's really not until the final 40-minutes is when the action kicks in. It just bothers me what people complain about in the genre isn't here and yet people still feel the need to complain. I thought the first half of Wolf Creek was excellent in setting up the characters and getting to know them and that's what elevates the 2nd half. And actually if anything I'd say any pacing problems were more in the 2nd half rather than the first.<br /><br />The screenplay by Greg McLean was quite solid; the main characters are well developed and also very likeable. They come across as real people and that's what helps keep Wolf Creek strong despite the lack of action. Like I said McLean could have easily taken the easy way out and created a slew of characters and have them knocked off in gruesome ways. But instead we only have three characters and they are developed rather than being killed off one by one. The villain Mick Taylor played by John Jarratt was an excellent villain. The problem with movies like Wolf Creek is the villains are often too likeable and that does create a problem.<br /><br />Mick Taylor is actually quite funny and entertaining, but he's also really creepy and scary. And when he's being funny it's also really creepy. I suppose the best way to describe him is sort of like the characters in Tobe Hooper's Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Like Taylor, they were funny in a really creepy way. Sometimes people who are insane are actually funny in the things they say and do. Not that I laugh at people with mental illness, but they can be funny. And Mick Taylor is funny, but there is something really sinister underneath and the flaw that often brings movies like Wolf Creek down is avoided.<br /><br />Wolf Creek was the feature film debut by Greg McLean and he handles it like a pro; the pacing of the movie early on was slow, but not in a bad way. It's slow paced, but never boring and the time spent with the characters greatly adds to the movie when the action kicks in. McLean takes his time getting to the action when he could have taken the easy way out and made a splatter flick. While the characters aren't the most developed I've see, but they are some of the most likeable and feel like real people and McLean is able to create a sense of looming danger even when nothing is really happening.<br /><br />The 2nd half is when the action kicks in and there was a lot of hype on how disturbing it was, which is sort of true. Wolf Creek is inspired by a true story and you can also see the 70s exploitation film influence as well and maybe I've just seen too many, but for me while it was twisted it's not like what was made out to be, but than again when you've seen enough of these movies it gets harder and harder to shock the viewer. But with that said the scenes in the 2nd half do pack a heavy punch, which has more to do with the viewer invested into the characters and when these terrible things happen to them again it may not be the most shocking, but works on a twisted level due to the amount of time we've spent with the characters.<br /><br />McLean delivers some solid suspense and tension and is able to craft some really dark scenes and the first major character to die was one of the greatest scenes this genre has ever seen. As excellent as the scene was the power lies more with the fact we've gotten to know the character. Though any pacing problems I found more in the 2nd half rather than the first half. There were a few moments in the 2nd half where it slightly dragged, but very little. McLean manages to keep things running smoothly.<br /><br />The acting was solid and the characters as well, which I mentioned before. Nathan Phillips is solid as Ben and Cassandra Magrath as Liz and Kestie Morassi as Kristy were both likeable and sympathetic. But the true star was John Jarratt as Mick Taylor who delivers one of the greatest horror performances and possibly the best of the decade. Like I said earlier the problem with a lot of these movies is the villain is often too likeable and while Jarratt is funny at times he's still creepy and again like I said before even when funny he's still creepy. Mick Taylor is cruel and vile and Jarratt plays the role to perfection.<br /><br />The biggest complaint for Wolf Creek was the first half was too slow, which I simply don't understand. Unlike most movies of this type or horror films in general Wolf Creek takes it's time and sets up the characters and that is what makes the 2nd half so powerful. Wolf Creek is an excellent horror flick and one of the very best of the decade.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>WOLF CREEK may not be a film for everyone to see, certainly not children, but if you're up for a taste of the macabre then this well made horror movie is certain to please.  The most terrifying aspect of the story is that it is based on true incidents, incidents in Australia that carry the same degree of impact as the Manson murders or the Hillside Strangler.  Murder and Madness are well married.<br /><br />A lively group of young daring travelers decide to take a camping trip to explore some fascinating regions of Australia, such as the crater site that is one of the largest in the world. We get to know lovable Ben (Nathan Phillips) and spunky Liz (Cassandra Magrath) and Kristy (Kestie Morassi) as they set out on the highway for an adventure only to backpack into one of their destinations and return to find their car won't start and their watches have stopped.  A friendly older gent Mick (John Jarret) stops to give them a hand and tows them to his ranch - and the story really begins. In continued scenes of seat-grabbing terror each of the three discover just how evil Mick is, and each is taken captive in different ways, tortured and well, to tell more would be to destroy the plot.<br /><br />Director Greg McLean takes his time in the first portion of the film, leading us to believe that this may be just another outback road trip with love interests, humor, and minor conflicts. But when he introduces Mick he alters the look and the style of the film, opting for some of the most magnificent vistas of Australia as the background for some of the more grisly depictions of horror on film.  The camera work (Will Gibson) is terrific and the musical score by Frank Tetaz adds to the mix of terror and madness. The actors all turn in fine performances: Nathan Phillips is a welcome new persona on the screen and John Jarret becomes one of the most realistic and repulsive of bad guys ever created on film.<br /><br />As long as you know what you're in for, this is a fast moving scary movie that will hold you to your seat and make you check your doors and windows for closure before going to bed!  Grady Harp, May 06</p></br><a href="../users/A5X1B2HBQUR3P.html">A5X1B2HBQUR3P</a><br/><p>Wolf creek is an utterly entertaining even if a sadistic horror movie. A lot of reviewers panned this as being too gory. High profile reviewers saying that it crosses the line. I don't know what all the fuss is about. Its got less than a quarter of the gore of say texas chain saw massacre (new one) or say hostel1&2. I found the movie had more of a pshycological fear infused in it due to the character of the australian boogie man aka crocodile dundee character. The story starts of as 2 girls and a guy leave by car to visit the wolf creek a site in the australian outback where the characters plan to hike around. The find their car break down and then are offered help by a supposedly good samaritan "crocodile dundie" type of guy who seems to be a local and conversant with the area. They take the help to be towed by the dundee's guy's pickup. Only it lands out to be a bad deal for them. They just got towed to their deaths. This apparently happy go lucky naive, bumbling along help-a-friend-in-need cheerful stranger happens to be as cheerful when killing people. It's different from the regular slasher film because I felt the terror of this villain. The way he snickers and speaks. He is a true sadist but it's no where near as gory as hostel. The most gory it got to to which some reviewers expressed dissent as being inappropriate was when the villain guy apparently severes the spinal chord of one of the girls with a dagger. Now this is shown in an abtuse way. We dont really see the actual deed in gory detail. If you consider the circular saws, blow torches and drills used to tear apart the faces in hostel, or the hellish implements used to squash, impale and twist people to ther deaths in say the saw series, this movie is very tame indeed. The movie is based on real life unsolved australian outback murders. The movie has a bit of this "blair witch project" feel to it. Not a lot but a bit. I can't say a great movie but a good movie neverthless.<br /><br />regards, Vikram</p></br><a href="../users/A27H9DOUGY9FOS.html">A27H9DOUGY9FOS</a><br/><p>This Australian exercise in sadism may also be the biggest, most pleasant surprise I've had in quite some time (at the risk of alienating anyone--pleasant is an odd choice of words for this film)!  Expecting little, I found much to appreciate in "Wolf Creek"--a potent entry in the slasher/torture genre.<br /><br />First of all, the film is practically a masterpiece compared to recent American films with similarly nasty themes.  Without a Chad Michael Murray, Paris Hilton, Amber Tamblyn, or other fresh faced TV-ready star in place, "Wolf Creek" already starts out at an advantage.  Here, we get a young trio on vacation.  They like to party hard, but unlike their American counterpoints, they speak and interact believably without that self-aware dialogue that plagues many modern horror films.  You get to know them, the build up and character development is admirable.  In fact, there is one scene where two of the characters tentatively kiss.  It's well played and very sweet.  How often have you said that when watching a film for its gore content?  Maybe never.<br /><br />Once the torment begins, I was invested in these three kids.  I wasn't wishing them to be dispatched--say like in "Hostel" when I was thrilled to see our obnoxious horndogs put to the knife (of course, they were cartoons not characters)--no I wanted our heroes here to persevere.  And every action and reaction is credible!  When they can help a friend, they try.  If they can't, they don't.  And they take every opportunity to escape.  This is not a witless exercise.  Logical choices are made--for good or bad result.  So this played out in a very real, very unexpected way--I was surprised by the outcome several times as we got closer to the end.  I can't give it much higher praise than that.<br /><br />One cliche, however, that seems to extend across all borders--the rural caricature.  Be it the Australian Outback or the American backwoods, those unfortunate enough to inhabit these desolate countries are depicted as mentally challenged an/or bullying rednecks!<br /><br />I think this film could appeal to an audience outside typical slasher films.  There is a resourcefulness and intelligence that make this distinct from a lot of Hollywood product.  It's a tale of survival as much as anything.  But obviously, there is brutality and unpleasantness.  Approach with caution, and you might be rewarded!  KGHarris, 10/06.</p></br><a href="../users/A6VXZ1EEPRTLV.html">A6VXZ1EEPRTLV</a><br/><p>Filmmaker Greg McLean's conceived the basic story for Wolf Creek several years before it came to the screen.  His goal was to do a distinctly Australian horror thriller.  Apparently, elements from a real case involving a serial killer who preyed on hikers, and other actual crimes, were later incorporated into the screenplay.  While not strictly `based on actual events' as is stated at the beginning of the film, Wolf Creek is a chilling tale featuring a ruthless and sadistic predator, with a long history of murder and torture in the Australian outback.<br /><br />The killer is a bushman named Mick Taylor (John Jarratt), and his latest victims are a trio of visitors to Wolf Creek National Park.  Aussie Ben Mitchell (Nathan Phillips), is travelling with a couple of British tourists, dark haired Liz Hunter (Cassandra Magrath) and fair haired Kristy Earl (Kestie Morassi).  After spending the day hiking around the scenic meteor crater, the group find themselves alone and stranded, when their car fails to start.  Spending the night in the car, they are awakened by the arrival of a tow truck.  The driver Mick, seems friendly and willing to help, so they hitch up the car and tow it back to Mick's place, what appears to be some kind of mine somewhere deep in the boonies.  After a little supper around the campfire, the tourists bed down for the night with no worries, while good old Mick gets down to working on repairing their vehicle . . . . .<br /><br />. . . . . well unfortunately Mick is into brutality, rape, and torture, and for the three unlucky travelers, life will never be the same again.  Much of the film from this point forward follows the actions of Liz and Kristy as they attempt to escape from a sadistic killer, who is an expert hunter, tracker, and marksman.<br /><br />While there are some questionable plot developments that challenge logic, overall the story holds together pretty well, with a strong atmosphere of fear, urgency, and terror.  And when Mick gets riled up, he's one mean and nasty guy.  The grisly act of making a `head on a stick', is just a source of amusement for his twisted mind.  Not to reveal specifics, but this is one nightmare that doesn't end well.<br /><br />The DVD's special features include the `The Making of Wolf Creek' an excellent, extremely comprehensive documentary that covers most of the key aspects of the making of the film.  The film also has a commentary track with McLean, actors Kestie Morassi, and Cassandra Magrath, and executive producer Matt Hearn.  The commentary is informative, but being generally lighter in tone, at times it may seem somewhat inappropriate for the grim happenings on screen.  Wolf Creek was shot in high definition video, with much of the footage shot with the camera hand held.  The reasons for doing this were to give the film a `documentary' type look, capture high definition images, and also enable the film to be shot at a faster pace, and less expensively.<br /><br />Wolf Creek is an impressive feature film debut for writer/director Greg McLean, who succeeds in his goal of bringing to the screen the chilling story of a sociopathic killer loose in the Australian outback.  McLean would return to present another unique view of Australia in his next film, Rogue (2008), an exciting adventure featuring a giant killer crocodile.  Hopefully bigger and better things are in store for this filmmaker.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LBAC84TLIGAX.html">A1LBAC84TLIGAX</a><br/><p>Wolf Creek is a fantastic example of how you can do a lot with a little. This easily one of the best independent films I've ever seen and is easily one of the most terrific and well-executed horror films I've seen. While the film received mixed reviews from critics (Roger Ebert, you're a major ***hole) and moviegoers, if you give it a chance and you're not easily bored, Wolf Creek does impress.<br />WHAT IT'S ABOUT: Year: 1999. Three friends; Liz, Kristy, and Ben decide to go on a cross-country across Australia to go to Wolf Creek to see one of the world's biggest craters. When they get back to their station wagon, it won't start or even make noise. Just when they are about to spend the night there, a man named Mick just so happens to come along and offers them a tow to his place to fix their car. So the group goes along with the plan, but when they wake up the next morning they realize that are trapped with a vicious and dangerous serial killer in the middle of nowhere and try to find a way to escape. The problem is, like Mick said, you never know where he might pop up.<br />MUSIC: Music comes and goes at times, but it's still very good and provides for the tense atmosphere which this film does an excellent job of providing.<br />ACTION: This film starts off pretty slow, but when it gets going it doesn't stop. This film is very tense, very suspenseful, and is actually scary. This film does a great job of capturing the feeling of realism because this is fully capable of happening. The violence is pretty gruesome throughout the film as well. Thank God, a horror film that is actually scary.<br />ACTING: This area was generally good, but there were times in which the actors dropped the ball and they were cheesy. The dialogue was fairly believable, but it also ran into problems. It's pretty good overall and the actors make it seem real, that's the important thing.<br />OVERALL: If you're a person who is tired of the usual pointless crappy horror films, then Wolf Creek is a definite must-have. Wolf Creek is a fantastic independent horror film that is definitely worthy of a purchase. It's creepy, it's gruesome, and it feels realistic.<br />THE GOOD: The actors, the gore, the music, and the realism.<br />THE BAD: Moments of bad acting and dialogue, and it's slow in the beginning.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PIX2K56IZZYX.html">A2PIX2K56IZZYX</a><br/><p>Solid horror movie here people, well acted, good scares, decent suspense, beautifully shot, all in all a rather nice surprise. I remember seeing the previews some time last year and thinkin' that this had some potential. I then read up on the 'true events' that the movie was based on and it does give you a few chills when you think about it. In the early 90's seven hikers/backpackers were murdered in the Australian outback, it seems he liked to let them go after he caught and tortured them because he was fascinated with the 'chase'. Just remember this movie is loosely based on true events, most of it is just the deranged and psychotic antics of the director and writers, gotta love 'em.<br /><br />Three hikers travel to Wolf Creek to check out a stretch of land where a meteor crashed some years back, after a good hike and some makin' out they realize they can't leave 'cuz guess what? you got it, the old car-is-broke-in-the-middle-of-nowhere situation (really stretchin' the artistic mind there aren't they?) Anyway, along comes Mick Taylor, a dirty, scruffy old bushman who tells them he can fix it, but the parts are at his place. Much to everyone's surprise our young hikers agree to head on back to his place, and our fun is soon beginning. Seems Mick's 'pad' is an abandoned mine, real fixer-upper let me tell you. Then around the campfire during storytime, Mick drugs each one and they all wake up hours later alone and tied up.<br /><br />Our first victim is Liz, played by Cassandra Magrath, I'm not to familiar with her work, but she does a splendid job, great screamer and a pretty tough chick too!! She wakes up all tied up in this little room, she is able to free herself, but right before she decides to make a break for it she hears a terrifying scream coming from her best friend and victim #2, Kristy, also played very well by Kestie Morassi. This scream sent chills down my back people, I'm not kidding, a scream of complete suffering and horror. Liz soon finds Kristy being tortured rather brutally by Mick (this scene is not for the squeamish) Kristy and Liz then have a cat and mouse game With Mick for the next hour trying to escape, I won't tell you what happens to them but they do a superb lead-in to our last victim Ben, who is nailed to a cross, but he too also manages to escape. Ben is played by Nathan Phillips, although not as strong a performance as the ladies, he does an above-average job as well.<br /><br />The thing that really got me was how 'real' the two ladies were, the pain and suffering they feel you feel too. The absolute struggle between life and death is brilliantly played out by all involved, and that alone makes it a cut above the usual slashers. Another reason it works so well is John Jarratt playing Mick Taylor, what a complete psycho, and he hams it up like you wouldn't believe. I'm not sure how many of you saw the movie High Tension, but Jarratt's performance ranks right up there with the leading lady from that excellent horror movie as well. At first he comes across as this Crocodile Dundee type, then you see this dark and uncaring soul who totally gets off on pain and torture.<br /><br />This isn't as gory and graphic as everyone is saying, yes there is some, but it's not nearly as bad as Devil's Rejects or even High Tension. It gets you more with it's gritty realism, strong suspense and a building sense of dread as the movie wears on. Wolf Creek is so beautifully shot, the scenery and locations are incredible. All the scenes of the Australian mountains, sunsets, desert hi-way's are so colorfull and bright, but yet perfectly balanced with the dreary, grainy feel and look of Mick's mine and torture rooms. This movie won't scare the hell out of ya, but it sure will bring on some fun conversation. I rented History Of Violence with this, so I'll let ya know how that one is soon, later!!<br /><br />acting......4 stars, Don't recognize a single one but they sure got the job done.<br /><br />directing...4 stars, Very well done<br /><br />special effects....3.5 stars, Not many to be seen, but decent, the car and cliff scene is nifty to watch<br /><br />horror rating....4 stars, Will get ya talkin'<br /><br />quality....4.5 stars, One of the better looking horror movies I've seen is recent years, nearly flawless in presentation.</p></br><a href="../users/A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ.html">A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ</a><br/><p>When traveling through Australia, two British chicks (sheilas), Liz and Christy, meet a moronic Aussie bloke named Ben.  The three decide to take a trip to Wolf(e) Creek National Park, a remote meteorite crater in the Australian wilderness.  Prior to their long trip Ben decides to get their wheels: a beat up, red wagon monstrosity costing $1500 quid.  Brilliant - buy a used rust-bucket for a trek into the barren, remote outback.  Ben eats soup with a fork.  After their arrival at Wolf(e) Creek, with the subsequent hike being over, their P.O.S. car doesn't start.  Of course it doesn't.  Luckily, they meet a friendly bushman named Mick (John Jarrat).<br /><br />Mick seems friendly enough, in a pedophiliac, overweight, clich&eacute;d Crocodile Dundee sort of way, sporting a harsh Australian accent, a filthy akubra, and gloriously huge mutton chops.  He attempts to fix their beater, and then eventually tows it to his secluded camp: an abandoned mine site.  With complete trust the three travelers, completely unaware of their surroundings, without a reliable mode of transportation, and having only known their friendly mechanic for a few hours, decide to relax and go to sleep.  No worries.<br /><br />It turns out they were drugged, and Mick's time in the wilderness has made him go troppo and lonely; the roos only provide so much love.  Liz wakes up bound and gagged in a closet, her friends nowhere in site but experiencing presumably similar predicaments.  Let the Aussie version of hillbilly torture porn begin!<br /><br />For the most part it's a typical horror movie throughout, a cross between Texas Chainsaw Massacre and The Hills Have Eyes.  There were a few moments when the victims did something smart, making me think, "Good onya!"  Unfortunately for them, however, they revert to retarded, and the carnage begins anew.  (The ridiculously bad decisions are the main negative aspect of the movie)<br /><br />The filming and scenery are very beautiful at times, reminding everyone what a beautiful country Australia is, with stunning wide-angle looks at the Wolfe Creek Crater, and spectacular, multi-colored sunsets.  Conversely, there are scenes with almost indie tones to them, with possible retro-horror tribute to 70s horror flicks' close-ups.  The acting is pretty much average for the tearful trio, with a few good screams.  Mick, however, is abso-bloodly-lutely brilliant.  One moment he's sadistically cheery, and the next eerily creepy.  He's a gleeful madman, laughing and taunting his prey like a child charring an ant with a magnifying glass.<br /><br />With a tense buildup and an evil haze throughout, it's better than most of the garbage Hollywood steals from Japan and passes off as horror nowadays.  It's definitely worthy a horror fan's viewing, and probably a good bet for casual fans.<br /><br />(This review brought to you with random Aussie slang.)</p></br><a href="../users/A6DOCZ10B7JAJ.html">A6DOCZ10B7JAJ</a><br/><p>This 2005 Australian tale is one of the most horrifying films ever made.<br /><br />So disturbing, many critics just can't hang.  Roger Ebert gave this a rare 0 stars, stating how he desperately wanted to walk out.<br />Other whiny critics cry about the excessively brutal torture scenes aimed toward women.<br />Still others moan about the extended buildup of the story.  They're used to horror movies showing ample nudity and some grotesque murders in the opening credits of the film.<br /><br />Whatever, go watch a lame remake of a classic Japanese ghost story then.  This is pretty close to perfect for the real horror fanatics.<br /><br />Loosely inspired by the Backpack Murders in the 90's.  We are shown actual footage of Wolfe Creek, the large crater caused by a meteorite crash.  A trio of hikers explore this site, and upon returning their car will not start.  Crikey!<br /><br />Little do these tourists know, the real fear is about to begin.  Mick, a brash but jovial Aussie bushman just happens to be strolling by, and he offers some help.  With little options, the group accepts the tow back to his place.  They wait by the campfire while he works on the car.  But they make one more costly mistake--they shouldn't have drank the water...<br /><br />The handheld camera gives a very raw feel to the sadistic torture scenes.  There is plenty of blood and gore as the madman does his deeds.  This film avoids nearly all stupid cliches of the genre to make for a truly unsettling experience.  The acting is outstanding, plus it has one of the most alarming villains ever!<br /><br />One interesting note, Mick's little lair appears to be at an abandoned mining site called NAVITALIM.  Flip that around a bit and you have the real killer's name--Ivan Milat.<br /><br />Ignore the bad reviews, this is one of the best horror films in the past 30 years, without a doubt.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>You're an everyday kind of guy. You like to have fun. Party. You make impulse decisions and impulse purchases. And one day you make an impulse decision with two of your female friends to buy a cheap car and take a road trip across the desolate Outback to the Wolf Creek meteor crater.<br /><br />It's fun. The country is beautiful. One of your friends has a crush on you and you have one on her. You get to Wolf Creek Park and have to hike out to the meteor crater.<br /><br />The meteor crater is awesome. You hit it off very nicely with the gal who has a crush on you, and she will probably be your girlfriend after today.<br /><br />Everything is going great until you hike back to your car from the crater and your new used car won't start.<br /><br />In Australia 30,000 people are reported missing every year, and of those 90% are found. The movie Wolf Creek is about the folks in my scenario above. And the folks in my scenario are players in a story of what perhaps the fate is of some of the 10% that are not found.<br /><br />Wolf Creek is one of the better Horror flicks that I've seen in a while. It is not a gore fest. It is not a jump out of the dark scare 'em up. It is not a slasher movie. Wolf Creek is a suspenseful thriller that gives the viewer a realistic fly-on-the-wall perspective of the perilous fate of a few everyday people that run into a very bad situation.<br /><br />Kudos to the cast...the acting is absolutely superb. Very believable. Too many times in Horror movies you find a cast of teeny boppers overacting and just acting foolishly. Wolf Creek is the antithesis of teeny bopper Horror. Wolf Creek's 3 young adult actors capture the young adult viewer with dispositions that can easily be related to, and they check all campy Horror movie humor and cliches at the door.<br /><br />This movie is done very well, and it is truly scary, because none of our party is faced with a guy in a mask, or a guy with a claw hand, or a supernatural being of some kind. They are instead faced with that stranger you passed on the highway just the other day. They are faced with some Outback nut that really could be out there.<br /><br />Thinking of a nice drive in the country anytime soon? I'd watch Wolf Creek after that trip if you want to enjoy your drive.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HII4U9WQ0XUV.html">A2HII4U9WQ0XUV</a><br/><p>Let me ask you a quick question: is there anything more sickly, nastily vulnerable than a guy and his chick, strangers in a strange land, driving through the night-gaunt countryside in a really unreliable car?<br /><br />It's not so bad by day, of course, but my God, don't those windows feel big and black and cold and exposed when the hungry darkness comes rolling off the fields and empty spaces, presses its hungry mouth up close to the lips of your beloved?<br /><br />So what it boils down to is this: British co-eds Liz and Kristy hook up with laconic but friendly Aussie Ben, and head out across the sere and empty Australian outback for a chummy road trip into the guts of the country's vast, unpeopled interior.<br /><br />So they party, they drink a little too much, they laugh, they flirt, they tell jokes and make plans.<br /><br />The object of their pilgrimage, and their curiosity, is Wolf Creek National Park, the site of a massive crater pounded into the otherwise freakishly featureless flat plain, the result of a massive meteor impact hundreds of thousands of years before.<br /><br />"Wonder why the meteor hit here, and nowhere else?" muses Liz, idly considering the rainswept crater with its dwarfish forest far below.<br /><br />Why, indeed.<br /><br />Maybe for no reason at all. Maybe. Or maybe, as Ben suggests, "maybe it was drawn to something in the Earth".<br /><br />Maybe so.<br /><br />So when our trio get back to their car and discover that it won't start, and their watches have all stopped, and Wolf Creek is rich in tales of drooling terrors drawn from the Stars to this wild haunt of inky darkness---and you start to wonder if our gang isn't about to have a Close Encounter of the Third Kind.<br /><br />And as those lights in the distance, jouncing roughly just above the ground, draw closer---well, turns out aliens are the least of the kids' worries. They're about to have a Close Encounter, alright: a Close Encounter of the Worst Kind.<br /><br />Greg McLean---with only one other indie short to his credit---has captured, on HD digital video and on a shoestring budget, nothing less than the naked, hungry face of Abject Terror.<br /><br />McLean is particularly impish in the way he conjures up his hellish little landscape of death, cruelty, and carnage: the fiend our heroes encounter (John Jarratt, who owns every inch of his role and chews up the scenery and the tourists with equal aplomb) is the very worst sort of predator, one with zero mercy, ferociously cunning, one that hides its black oozing malice beneath a rube's jowly flesh and easy smile.<br /><br />Oh, and did I mention this guy really likes to hunt?<br /><br />McLean has crafted a very precise, clinically merciless, gorgeous-looking monster of a film: it is depraved, and ruthless, and banal, bleak, and nihilistic. It asks no quarter, and in return offers none.<br /><br />It will instantly polarize: you'll be transfixed or repulsed, or both: McLean knows how to find a nasty, fleshy, spongy wound of horror, and poke it, prod it, and then tear it open. Part of the film's pungent, deadly ability to horrify stems, I think, from McLean's decision to contrast the frail mortality of his protagonists against the hard, seamy, craggy infinity of their ancient surroundings.<br /><br />Part of it, no doubt, is the way he makes us voyeurs: we don't want to watch, but we can't look away.<br /><br />And part of it, I'm certain, is the way in which the voyeur ultimately gets served up as victim. And there are, "Wolf Creek" proves, far, far worse fates than death.<br /><br />Watches stopped? Darkness pressed up against the windshield? Lights in the distance, bouncing peculiarly, against the horizon?<br /><br />I'd hope it's aliens, if I were you.<br /><br />JSG</p></br><a href="../users/A13IKSGDYNBNQS.html">A13IKSGDYNBNQS</a><br/><p>Although you could argue that this falls into the recent spate of torture-porn films, in fact its vastly superior to all of these. Yes it follows the old pattern of young good-looking people getting into trouble, but it does it with a verve and style that is missing form say Hostel and Capture.<br /><br />The main reason it works is because some time is spent developing the characters in the first half of the film. So when things start to go bad for the innocent trio you do have some sympathy with the nightmare that they find themselves in.<br /><br />Another important point is that this is not a Hollywood movie and as a result it does not do what Hollywood movies do. In the last 1/3 of the film there quite a few unpleasant surprises which you wouldn't get in a Hollywood film.<br /><br />It is supposed to be based on a true story, although there may have been some artistic licence. Nevertheless even if its only 50% true the events portrayed are truly nightmarish. If you are a fan of horror films you'll like this a lot, otherwise I'd advise caution!</p></br><a href="../users/A22TZUXUKA11SQ.html">A22TZUXUKA11SQ</a><br/><p>In the spirit of Halloween, I thought I'd rent this movie to get me into the mood for the season.  I thought it would be scary, but not terrifying. I was wrong. Let me preface this review by saying I like scary movies, but I get frightened whether it's Scream, The Amityville Horror, or Friday the 13th. It's the music that does it more than the murder. That being said, you don't even need the scary music when you have the sounds of people being tortured, of a woman begging for her life, and of a person so traumatized that even when you're scolding her for breathing so loudly while the killer searches for her you know you'd do the same thing in her place. Any movie where people are just minding their own business trying to do their hiking/camping thing and something goes wrong and they, foolishly, believe in the inherent goodness of others only to wind up being hunted has the potential for being either creepy or campy. Wolf Creek is the former.  After watching this movie I had to watch some episodes of Family Guy just to get to sleep. I'd highly recommend it if you're in the mood for a scary movie.... just as long as you have something lighthearted to watch afterward.</p></br><a href="../users/A387BD735MI50R.html">A387BD735MI50R</a><br/><p>This film is definitely several notches above the average horror flick. It overturns a number of slasher film cliches.<br /><br />First of all, you get to know the three victims as interesting individuals before the horror starts. These three are not the usual gum-chewing teens tossing a few random, pointless curses at each other before they encounter the psychopath. They are three intelligent, likeable people - which makes their ultimate brutal ordeal all the more wrenching.<br /><br />Then the ending is not what you expect. These characters' journey into hell will leave you shaken and depressed. I don't at all mean to make the real-life sufferings of people around the world frivolous with the comparison - nevertheless, I did walk away from this movie with a feel for what the the victims of mass genocide and attempted mass genocide in places like Rwanda and Cambodia may have gone through - a better feel than I generally have gotten from watching all the serious documentaries on those slaughters. Here I was plummeted right into proximity with a madman bent on butchery. I was forced to FEEL what it was like.<br /><br />I've heard a lot of analysis of why we flock to horror movies. Some say we are all sadists at heart and are getting our jollies vicariously. Some say that we go in order to rehearse what we might do if we are ever actually forced into such extremis. For me - I sense a certain amount of hidden malevolence in the average person, the person who starts out saying, 'Hi' and smiling - but who is harboring or can be triggered into a hatred that will end up undercutting life. And seeing this transformation, this shedding of the sheepskin - graphic, exaggerated, and overt on screen - somehow makes all the real-life hidden agendas around me more manageable, more expected.<br /><br />Whatever your motives for going to horror films, Wolf Creek will probably satisfy them. But don't listen to the running DVD commentary afterwards. The actors' and director's remarks don't add anything of interest. And their giggling, lightweight banter destroys the deadweight mood of the film itself.<br /><br />There's one last reason to see this movie. The scenery is a fifth main character in the action. You get a sweeping view of the Australian outback - of the remarkable meteor crater formation the characters visit - of the emptiness. You'll feel you've been there. You may think twice about paying an actual visit anytime soon.</p></br><a href="../users/AW4MT9WP95TVD.html">AW4MT9WP95TVD</a><br/><p>Just finished watching Wolf Creek, home alone.  Also just finished checking the windows and doors.  Jeez, what a grisly little pic this is.  A little slow to develop, but I think if the horror kicked in any sooner, people would probably not be able to take it.  It's that violent and creepy.<br /><br />Also some beautiful shots of Australia : beach, sunrise, sunsets - good enough to tide me over because I'm not going anytime soon!  This can scare the wits out of you!</p></br><a href="../users/A19V0VJMKKRMC8.html">A19V0VJMKKRMC8</a><br/><p>The year 2006. I never expected to like this as much as I did.

Gruesome best describes the movie.  You may feel as if the movie is never going to start, and I literally thought, "ok, ok, you are trying to establish tension between the two chics and the due....fine, get ON with it...."  However, after the initial scenes which get the movie off to a slow start (though camera trickery is used to attempt to overcome this problem), the movie actually begins.<br /><br />Once the movie truly starts, and the basic plot lines are established (character tension, etc.), the movie sucked me in, grabbed me by the gonads, and didn't let go.  Once the Freddy Kruger of Australia enters the story, all hell breaks loose.<br /><br />I was very surprised by the gruesome and horrific scenes in this movie.  I review <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/078401213X">Pi</a> as "Disturbing," but that was on a different level.  Wolf Creek is truly Disturbing, because of the detail of the horrific scenes, the cold blooded ruthlessness....but even more so because it seems so real.  This movie leaves you wondering about solo hiking trips and other adventures.  Can't say I'll be touring Australia any time soon.<br /><br />If you like the new <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KJU1KK">The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning - Unrated (New Line Platinum Series)</a> movies, you will probably enjoy Wolf Creek.</p></br><a href="../users/A4F8CJ1L4348V.html">A4F8CJ1L4348V</a><br/><p>I liked this movie, but I am one that loves B horror flicks. I read in an earlier post that this movie is just like the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I don't agree with that at all. This movie is way better than the TCM by far. It was based on a true story in Australia about some some "hikers" getting trapped at a hiking trail and someone comes along to "save" them. Yes, it seems like the story has been told before. If you bear in mind, history does repeat itself and so do crimes even in different countries. I thought that the acting was very good and the story does hold it's ground. Yes, there were holes in the story with the "victims", but this is a B horror flick and it doesn't have a very high budget. See this movie and maybe it will be just as enjoyable for you as it was for me. I recommend this one!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A2RKI7RPP5CJMG.html">A2RKI7RPP5CJMG</a><br/><p>I really don't know how much of "Wolf Creek" is actually based on the Backpacker Killer of Australia, but even if a tinge of it is true, it makes for a good horror tale.  Mind you, this isn't your typical hack n' slash Freddy or Jason flick, this film is about a demented man who just enjoys torturing and killing people.  There is some gore, but I've seen a lot worse.  Besides, gore doesn't make a movie scary, it's the PLOT that makes it scary.<br /><br />A number of things set "Wolf Creek" apart from your average horror flick.  For one, there are only three characters who become potential victims.  Our killer doesn't have a huge party or some wild bunch of teenage idiots to work with.  He's only got three, and he makes the most of it.  Also, we get to learn quite a deal about our three victims.  Cassandra Macgrath heads up the group of backpackers and she takes on the primary heroine role in the film.  Nathan Phillips plays her would-be love interest and Kestie Morassi hits the trail looking like a young and somewhat prettier Christina Applegate(perhaps the accent gives her that "something extra").  John Jarratt plays Mick Taylor, our prime suspect.  Relax, I haven't given anything away by fingering Jarratt as the killer, it's almost obvious when he hits the screen.  He's almost too likeable and friendly at first for the average viewer to think of him as anything else.  He does sort of look like old Roscoe P. Coltrane from the "Dukes of Hazzard" TV series, so that kind of took the edge off of him for me.  No matter, the entire cast did a wonderful and convincing job.<br /><br />The story sounds rather stereotypical of the horror genre:  friends trek off for a weekend of fun and end up being systematically tortured and killed.  Though it isn't quite as relentless as "Texas Chainsaw Massacre," I can see the similarities in the cruel and garish actions of the villain.  The back of the DVD case compares this flick to "The Blair Witch Project," which I feel is a disservice to "Wolf Creek."  This is a much better film.  I didn't care when things happened to the jerks in "Blair Witch," but I did pull for the victims in "Wolf Creek."<br /><br />Overall, if you're a fan of horror along the "Texas Chainsaw" line, you'll enjoy this flick.  If you think scary is defined by the body count, stay away.<br /><br />One other thing, I was amazed at how intelligent the characters were in this film.  They actually defended themselves and attempted to escape.  Only one character got a little too sure of themself, but I think that was due more to delirium than attitude.<br /><br />Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/AW99SBGWEXP0J.html">AW99SBGWEXP0J</a><br/><p>Liz (Magrath), Kristy (Morassi), and Ben (Phillips) are travelling across the Australian outback, on their way to the east coast.  Along the way, they stop and do some sightseeing at a crater in Wolf Creek.  When they return to their car, it will not start.  They are in the middle of nowhere, with no one around for miles.  Fortunately for them, one night Mick (Jarratt), a local, comes across them and offers to fix their car and take them back to his place for the night.  Unfortunately, Mick has other plans for the three of them as well.<br /><br />"Wolf Creek" is a genuinely creepy movie.  The kids' aloneness is very evident and eerie, and it is easy to believe that this could really happen.  (Indeed, the movie is inspired by true events).  Jarratt is about as disturbing as you could want in a killer in this type of movie.  "Wolf Creek" was a surprise for me, as I enjoyed it more than I anticipated (if "enjoy" is actually the correct word to use for a movie of this type).  I recommend this for horror fans only.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FPDWTD9AENVK.html">A2FPDWTD9AENVK</a><br/><p>Though criticized during its initial release for its grueling depictions of violence and torture, Greg Mclean's first feature film has much more to offer than it is commonly given credit for. WOLF CREEK begins with two English girls and their new friend taking off through the Australian Outback on a sightseeing tour. They return to their car after visiting a remote state park only to find that the engine will not start. Luckily, a local hunter spots them and offers to tow them to his camp, where he can fix the car in the morning. As these three unfortunate travelers would soon find out, they are not the first tourists to run into trouble in the desert, and their would-be savior is actually a wolf in sheep's clothing.<br /><br />Mclean captures the natural beauty, tranquility, and vast emptiness of the Australian landscape in a way that few film exports have in the past. The gradual buildup and leisurely pace are used to establish the futility of escape once the hunter's trap is set. This also allows the audience time to truly connect with Kristy, Liz, and Ben, who are portrayed as honest and utterly believable characters. WOLF CREEK's casual dialog does not make it a point to form rounded backgrounds for any of its players, but rather focuses on creating organic conversations out of everyday speech. John Jarratt assumes the role of Mick, the jolly huntsman that is hiding a cold and calculating killer behind his lively exterior. Jarratt is able to turn character in seconds, and in doing so, he has become one of the most terrifying on-screen villains in years.<br /><br />The gently subdued score adds an unsettling note that underlies the entire picture without ever relying on punctuated jump scares to effectively shock audience. Mclean's tight, hand-held filming has a hint of voyeurism, which draws the viewer in to the intimate dialog but also makes the attacks that much more visceral and disturbing. Unjust criticisms that dismissed the film simply for containing elements of torture were far to quick to judge it on its more brutal qualities, when beneath the horror lies a brilliantly-crafted thriller that is sure to find a growing audience in the years to come.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies</p></br><a href="../users/A8DI0COTCMRDV.html">A8DI0COTCMRDV</a><br/><p>Greg McLean's "Wolf Creek" is a masterful addition to the backwoods horror genre. Destine for horror greatness & much more factual than Tobe Hooper's 1974 landmark horror film "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" wich is loooosely based on "the ghoul of plainfeild" Ed Gein. McLean's film is about one (mostly real) incident in wich a man named Ivan Robert Milat aka "The Wolf Creek Killer" or "The Back Pack Killer" who was found guilty of killing 7+ back packer's between 1989-92 in aultralia's back woods in & around a national park called wolfcreek this is just one of the stories & it is truly scary! enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A3IXPFN5DU9Z9L.html">A3IXPFN5DU9Z9L</a><br/><p>The tension created in Wolf-Creek is unbelievable. I haven't been that wound up during a thriller since I watched "Event Horizon" when I was 13. From the very start the film creates an atmosphere of alienation and vulnerability, all set against the inhospitable backdrop of the Australian outback.<br /><br />In this type of film the core group of characters usually provides a solid foundation and comfort zone for the viewer. We know these people are "Safe" as long as they stick together. In Wolf-Creek, however, the core group lacks that kind of cohesiveness, an unexpected element that  isolates the characters from each other even when they are together.<br /><br />We are introduced to Liz and Christy, two young Brits who embark on a spontaneous tour of Australia, content to let their impulses guide them. With them is Ben, a reckless bad-boy type the girls befriended and invited along. In such a constellation sexual tension is a given, and before the story is even underway an uneasiness has fallen over the trio.<br /><br />This idle tension is turbocharged with the arrival of Mick, a grizzled 'Outbacker' who happens upon the youngsters and their broken down car - In an isolated park in the middle of the desert - At night.<br /><br />The affable Ausie offers to tow their car to his garage where he promises to fix it up and send them on their way. As they sit around the campfire and talk to their new friend, Ben can't resist his macho impulse to put the back-country Mick down. In this moment, shortly before the scales of destiny tip horribly against the trio, we catch  a glimpse of the real Mick hidden just below the cheerful exterior.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this is where the film became unpleasant to watch. I like my excessive gore just as much as the next guy, but I'm sick of watching people being sadistically tortured.<br /><br />When an alien spears a guy through the stomach and blood spews out of his mouth I lean forward, wide-eyed and say "Holy Sh**! Did you see that! Sweet!" and then I high-five the dude next to me. When some psycho paralyzes a girl with an 8inch hunting knife to the spine just as you think she's going to escape, then promises her a slow and painful death, or when he waves the same knife at a bound and bloody woman while he threatens to cut off her breasts, the only thing I feel is acute abhorrence.<br /><br />The kind of violence in these films is a calculated imitation of sexual sadism, whether the sexual gratification is made explicit or not. Torture for the sake of titillating the audience, making us uneasy and selling it as thrills, is a cheap parlor trick that takes advantage of our darkest impulses. We may not be aroused by torture, but we can't seem to look away either, and once we've made peace with consuming the pain of others for entertainment, we come back again and again. The Roman's discovered this in the Colosseum, and Hollywood has rediscovered it in the modern slasher film. The popularity of the SAW series is a testament to the fact that Torture Porn sells.<br /><br />I'm not judging those who loved this movie, and I'm not saying you're a sadist (although some fraction of Torture Porn fans most certainly are). Everyone is entitled to choose the type of film that entertains them, and censoring this type of content wouldn't change the fact that it would still sell. However, this film gets  2 stars from me for wasting its potential on base brutality, and this review is a warning to others who share my views not to subject themselves to this film.</p></br><a href="../users/APQ8N1UKS1RDC.html">APQ8N1UKS1RDC</a><br/><p>Oh! those naughty Aussie's. Wolf Creek was a film that the<br />title and cover just screamed LAME! To me. Was I surprised.<br />I really enjoyed this low budget TERROR film. It is about three<br />teenagers going to see Wolf Creek National Park and their<br />car breaking down along the way. Not to worry? For here comes<br />Mick Taylor(No! Not of the Stones)played brilliantly by the<br />actor John Jarratt. He really gains their trust and seems<br />like a real friendly guy. DON'T YOU BELIEVE IT!  For he is<br />as nasty as they come. The death scenes in this are some<br />of the most unexpected I've ever seen. There are setbacks<br />like if you we're  trapped by this madman and he had left for awhile<br />and you untied yourself.  Would you really take the time to start<br />reading newspaper clippings on this guy and watching videotapes of<br />him??????????  No! You would get the Hell Out! With that and a few<br />other eye's to the ceiling I found to enjoy this movie. For 2000 and up<br />that's saying a WHOLE LOT! Give this movie a try for Oct.<br />You might just HOWL at it(sic)<br /><br />Best line from the movie: There ya are! Just a Head on a stick!</p></br><a href="../users/A1VCPMT1RRS7K0.html">A1VCPMT1RRS7K0</a><br/><p>This is a decent thriller movie. A lot of the plot is highly predictable, yet it is still disturbing to see it all play out. Three young people set out on a hiking vacation to Wolf Creek in Australia, where they run into a crazed local killer. There isn't all that much gore, but there are a few slightly nasty scenes. For the budget used to produce the film, it is a successful movie. It is definitely worth watching, but I wouldn't care to own it for repeated viewings.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PMQH87R1H3QU.html">A2PMQH87R1H3QU</a><br/><p>I really like scary movies and have big giant collections of it...I rented this movie one night on Saturday with friends we watched it...we was in edge of  our seat..

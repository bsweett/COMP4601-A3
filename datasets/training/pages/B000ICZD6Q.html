Well, it's a little more thoughtful than that, and extremey well done. There are lots of issues being explored, and the wonderful script gives credence to a number of those issues: Corporate greed, parenting, young love, family situations, office cameraderie, etc. I enjoyed the film a lot. It's worth a look, especially at the end, which allows a smattering of justice and redemption.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>I just got back from seeing this Drama/Comedy and it was much better than I expected. I thought going in that it would be mildly entertaining, but by the time the credits began to roll I didn't want to leave these characters I have come to know over the last two hours. Each character is well written and the three leads are cast so perfectly that none really stand out due to the fact they are all equally good. Dennis Quaid is usually hit or miss in the acting department, but this is a role that he really shines in. Topher Grace may be best known so far for "That 70's Show" but this role here proves that he will have a long acting career. And finally we come to Scarlett Johansson. While this is probably not her best role to date, she is good in any part she is in and her presence is undeniable. She is gorgeous (never looked better) and I love that voice of hers. All in all, this is a movie well worth seeing and I am glad I didn't pass this one up.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EBLL2OYEQJN9.html">A2EBLL2OYEQJN9</a><br/><p>This movie got plenty of advance positive press.  I heard about it on TV, on NPR, in magazines, and everyone was hyped for it.  Great premise:  20-something rising star Topher Grace becomes the boss of the 50-something Dennis Quaid in a company take-over.<br /><br />What do you expect from this kind of movie?  Weirdness over the age different and role reversal?  Check.  Grace is going to think he knows it all, but he actually has a lot to learn from Quaid?  Check.  Grace is going to relate to Quaid's daughter better than he does to Quaid?  Check.  The universe is going to be righted at the end of the movie, and both Grace and Quaid are going to go off in the world changed and better people?  Check.<br /><br />This movie delivered exactly what one would expect if they know the premise.  It was formulaic in that respect.  There is still some excellent acting and some great drama, but it is all pretty straightforward.  I wasn't moved or surprised in any way.</p></br><a href="../users/A16QODENBJVUI1.html">A16QODENBJVUI1</a><br/><p>I enjoy writing reviews for Amazon, which I do in part to make sure I take some time each day to string together a few moderately conservative sentences.  To facilitate my reviewing, I keep a list of books that I have read or movies I have seen or albums I have listened to that I would like at some point to write a review about.  I saw IN GOOD COMPANY about three weeks prior to writing this review, but I have to confess that from about five minutes after having finished watching it to this very moment, I haven't given it a second's thought.  And therein is the problem with the film:  while it is moderately entertaining while you are watching it, it will be entirely forgotten as soon as you are done.<br /><br />The plot is simple:  a marketing exec in his early fifties is demoted and given a boss half his age when a large corporation takes over his magazine.  The young boss has a brief but not a lasting affair with his daughter, who is an undergraduate at NYU.  Many of the former employees are fired as corporate down-sizing takes hold.  Eventually, the company sells the magazine and the young boss gets released and the middle-aged exec gets his job back.  To be honest, in spite all this, nothing much really happens in the film.  It is all just OK.  The script is just OK, the plot is just OK, the production is just OK.  As a result, there just isn't a whole lot to remember.  In other words, it is a solid and completely unspectacular Hollywood product.<br /><br />The cast was good, but given a much better cast wouldn't have faired much better since there was so little to work with.  Dennis Quaid was good as usual, and Scarlett Johansson, she of the beautiful eyes and mouth, was interesting to look at.  Topher Grace could have been vastly improved upon, and I'm not quite sure why he was cast in the role of the young hot shot executive.  Sometimes casting is just a mystery.<br /><br />All in all, there are worse uses of time than seeing this film, and many better uses.  I wouldn't advise anyone running away from it if it is on TV or if a friend has rented it, but I certainly wouldn't counsel anyone going out of their way to see it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EEUQ81DTY7G3.html">A2EEUQ81DTY7G3</a><br/><p>In Good Company would have to be one of the smartest, and satirical movies made about the trials and tribulations of the corporate world in recent years. Part love story and part wry social commentary, In Good Company effectively probes, deconstructs, attacks and, in a strange way, even celebrates corporate greed, and age discrimination. The themes of the movie are common and extremely relevant in a world where globalization has taken workplace security away, where work is now mobile, and where workers are at the impulse of corporate takeovers.<br /><br />Carter Duryea (played by Topher Grace) is a young, ambitious upstart who tosses around buzzwords such as "synergy." Carter recently had a hit with a line of cell phones aimed specifically at children and he so impressed his super conglomerate CEO that he has been promoted to the head of ad sales at the corporation's new flagship sports magazine. Dan Foreman (Dennis Quaid) is the current boss of the magazine, and his years of experience and his more traditional style of working, have given him years of security along with admiration and respect from his colleagues. He's also blessed with a loving family, which includes his beautiful older daughter Alex (a gorgeous Scarlett Johansson) who is bound for NYU.<br /><br />When Carter becomes Dan's boss, Dan grudgingly adapts to his demotion and the sparks begin to fly as Carter, under order to cut employees and trim budgets embarks on a steady round of firings. It doesn't help that Alex begins to take a steady shine to Carter, when Dan accidentally invites the lonely Carter over for dinner. Carter is smug and hyperactive - he constantly downs cups of coffee to keep his creative energy levels up - but his restlessness is only a front. Underneath lies a fearful and frightened young man who is suffering from a crumbling marriage and yawns for love and fulfillment. Dan, on the other hand, is fifty-two and is about to be a father again.  He has a paternal, world-weary wisdom that has been amassed from years of experience both as a family man and as a worker.<br /><br />The fluid dynamic between Carter and Dan is at the core of the movie. And as their roles shift and evolve, their develops a very special relationship - part father and son, part colleague and mentor. Both men are almost always at odds, sometimes violently so, and the film pulls off the clever trick of keeping both characters completely sympathetic, even when one, the other, or both give in to their piggish and wrong-headed tendencies.<br /><br />In Good Company is film making at its best. With intelligent writing, witty dialogue, and steady direction, director Paul Weitz has made a film that brims cheer and is also quite devastating in its view the harshness of the working world. The characters are all intricate and textured and the actors do a terrific job of bringing out their very human foibles. Dennis Quaid delivers one of the finest performances of his career, and Scarlett Johansson is fabulous to watch as Dan's artistic, fiercely independent daughter. In Good Company is deliciously off-center and has some spot on things to say about ambition, work and office culture. Mike Leonard January 05</p></br><a href="../users/A1EOLRV216BXJ9.html">A1EOLRV216BXJ9</a><br/><p>I thought this would be a romantic comedy about two young people, Scarlett Johansson and Topher Grace, both of whom I really like, but I was wrong. The movie is more about a middle-aged man and a father-to-be (Dennis Quaid). He was handling a job crisis (his company was just taken over), a financial crisis (his baby coming and his eldest girl transferred to NYU), middle-age crisis (his new boss was young enough to be his son and the "old and traditional" people could not compete with the "young and inspiring")  as well as an emotional crisis (daddy girl has grown up and moved out). To make it more difficult, he has always treated his co-workers as a family and now he had to fire some of them as a consequence of synergy. All he could hang on to was his family. However, even as he has always treasured his closeness with his eldest daughter and expected her to keep no secrets from him, things were not the same anymore.<br /><br />When things didn't come at all as expected, at work or at home, he had to juggle between upholding his principles or making compromises. Actually he did a bit of both. I must say I am most impressed by Dennis Quaid. He played the role well and the struggles he has to face are so real.<br /><br />Having said that, the romantic part of the movie is still well presented. Especially well-played is Topher Grace, the 26-year old ambitious young man who, inspired by Dennis Quaid, ultimately embarked on a new course heading one step closer towards his dream.<br /><br />I like the movie because the ending is not so Hollywood and  the theme in the movie is consistent- that people are most important and the most valuable asset, both in a family and in a company; that people can still be upright and successful; and people, regardless of their age, can still hope for a better future.</p></br><a href="../users/AVOCNUFOXUCA6.html">AVOCNUFOXUCA6</a><br/><p>We've seen all this stuff before.  A man with a perfect family (of course it's perfect, because how could we have sympathy for anyone who's not perfect?) has a mid-life crisis, emerging victorious at the end.  Kind of like Death of a Salesman without the death part.  Along the way, trite set pieces of drama arise (someone's in the hospital!  how can I pay for college!) to be overcome as well.  The script is banal, trite and Lifetime Channel movie-like.<br /><br />Scarlett Johannsen is strangely lifeless, as in virtually all her roles, and sucks the energy out of the film every time she appears.  Her popularity, and her seeming presence in every single movie in 2005, are perplexing at best.  I've seen props that have outacted her.  Not even Bruce-the-Shark type exciting props like in Jaws, but just stuff lying around the set.  The supporting players are ill-used, particularly Quaid's wife, who gets to say about 5 sitcom lines in the course of the movie.<br /><br />On top of that, the direction is strange and clunky, with bizarre camera placements and directorial decisions that veer between television-basic and outright strange.<br /><br />"In Good Company" is also a stellar example of screenwriters' complete lack of familiarity with the business and corporate world outside of Hollywood and the studios.  While corporate politics abound in the real world, and layoffs happen all the time, the behaviors of some of the people at the companies in this movie are clunky and cartoonish, and bear no resemblance to the real world.<br /><br />So what's good about this movie?  Why three stars?  Dennis Quaid and Topher Grace.  They turn in performances that convert what could have been a trite, painful-to-watch mess into a serviceable film.  Indeed, "In Good Company" is a textbook example of how good actors can overcome a trite screenplay and clunky direction.  Topher Grace has always been likeable, even though I've always suspected that in That 70s Show he essentially plays himself.  However, in this film, he shows that he can turn in not just a performance, but a great one.  The same goes for Dennis Quaid.<br /><br />This movie is not worth going out of your way for at the video store.  Nevertheless, if it's Friday night at 10 pm and one of the only choices that remains for you is "In Good Company", it's worth picking up.  You aren't going to love it, but you won't be chucking shoes at the TV when it's over shouting about how it stole two hours of your life, either.</p></br><a href="../users/ALJGB7XHPFCR.html">ALJGB7XHPFCR</a><br/><p>Dennis Quaid gives a magnificent performance as a long-time salesman who's proud of his work, and who suddenly loses his status when he gets demoted. Topher Grace plays the new boss, and he's terrific as an obnoxious but charming kid on a power trip. Quaid and Grace's awkward, amusing, and (eventually) fond friendship is the crux of the film, and the best reason to see it. The movie's flaws: First, it's slow at times, I expected more inter-office interaction. Second, for a film about cold corporations and job insecurity, the comedy is less sharp than it could be. It's almost as if the movie is too light for its subject. Characters get laid off but you never see how it would hurt their families. The only really bad thing that happens to anyone is that they have to take out a second mortgage! Another reason the comedy is so lightweight is that there no major bad guys to make fun of. Quaid and Grace (who lays off Quaid's colleagues) represent different business philosophies, but they're both essentially good-hearted. Only one or two characters are slightly villainous, and they're on screen for just a couple minutes.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FG91CM8221X1.html">A1FG91CM8221X1</a><br/><p>Paul Weitz's "In Good Company" gives us a classic farcical setup--a middle-aged executive suddenly finds himself saddled with a boss half his age--and adds the not unexpected complication of the young boss falling in love with his older subordinate's daugther. That this story doesn't end up quite where you think it will, without sacrificing any of the pleasures of a well-wrought movie comedy, is a real tribute to writer-director Weitz, whose last film, "About a Boy," was similarly likable and unpredictable. Those who are looking for the broad ribaldry of Weitz's first major hit, "American Pie," will be largely disappointed by the gentle yet sharply observant humor of "In Good Company." Much of the film's appeal is centered in the appeal of the two leads. Dennis Quaid exudes gruff charm as the displaced middle-aged executive, and he's as sexy now as he's ever been. As the young boss, Topher Grace--as hesitant and bumbling in his new position as a newly hatched chick--has much the same appealing, Everyman quality as the young Tom Hanks. The story is essentially that of two good, likable men forced by circumstance into an adversarial relationship, and Quaid and Grace are extremely adept at keeping the laughs coming even as your hearts are breaking for them. As Quaid's daughter and Grace's love interest, Scarlett Johansson isn't called on to do much except be charming, but she's very good at that, as is Marg Helgenberger as her mom. There also are plenty of sharp supporting performances, particularly David Paymer (who looks more like Larry of The Three Stooges with each new role) as a downtrodden corporate cog; Clark Gregg as a loathsomely smug corporate hatchetman; and Malcolm McDowell in an unbilled cameo as the Bransonesque tycoon who serves as the plot's major catalyst.</p></br><a href="../users/A3SYMLB8JSW5VD.html">A3SYMLB8JSW5VD</a><br/><p>This is such an amazing movie.

Topher Grace (best known as Eric Foreman on 'That 70's show' stretches his acting chops. He plays the youthfull boss of a reccently demoted salesperson, Dan Foreman (Dennis Quaid).<br /><br />As Carter Dureya, Grace plays an uber-kid. Having no use for the 'old-fashioned' business handshake, he instead promotes products through each other. Grace does a wonderful job portraying somebody who although very smart is still learning about life.<br /><br />After being dumped by his wife of seven months, Dureya inexplicably goes after the subordinate's daughter. Already unerved about the one-two impact of his boss's young age and his wife Ann (Marg Helgenberger)'s late-life pregnancy, Dan must now deal with the even-more uncomfortable idea of his daughter dating his own boss.<br /><br />Confronting this boyfriend when they stay out late...etc would be very difficult. This plot twist creates all kind of innovative perspectives.<br /><br />What could have ended up being either a cheesy teen flick or a cheesy grown up soap fest is instead an enjoyable feature for many age ranges. Youth will flock to see Grace and his romance, their parents and others will be drawn in from familiarity with downsizing.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>Hats off to Paul Weitz!  Who would have thought that the person behind 'American Pie', 'Nutty Professor II', 'Antz' etc could write and direct a film so intelligent and sensitive and genuinely funny in the most sophisticated sense of the word 'comedy'?  But pause; 'About a Boy' is also to his credit, so perhaps the other ventures were just exploratory surgeries which allowed him to find his particular voice and view of life today!<br /><br />IN GOOD COMPANY  deals with many issues, not the least of which is the current conflicted status of the Baby Boomers.  In our increasingly youth oriented culture, the generation now in their late forties and fifties is struggling to maintain a niche and identity that allows them to continue pursuing the American Dream as the X Generation of instant gratification young ones step on experienced hands on the ever-lengthening ladder to success.<br /><br />Dan Foreman (Dennis Quaid), approaching age 52, is a laid back ad salesman for a successful sports magazine that allows him time and money to enjoy his two beautiful daughters Alex (Scarlett Johansson) and Jana (Zena Gray) and his ideal wife Ann (Marg Helgenberger).  Enter Mergers and Acquisitions - that increasingly dreadful and greedy term that we banter around between fears of concerns over job loss and acknowledgement of Corporate abuse in out-sourcing, executive wealth plus greed, etc.  A new media company buys Dan's magazine and in downsizing the staff to increase corporate profits, Dan is replaced by one Carter Duryea (Topher Grace), a 26 year old kid whose only claim to experience is a ridiculous line of dinosaur cell phones to court the 'under 5 year old' market!<br /><br />Dan's life seems to be crumbling and to add to his disillusionment he discovers a pregnancy test kit in his bathroom wastebasket, immediately implicates his lovely 18-year-old daughter Alex, only to hear that his wife is indeed the pregnant one.  The threat of bills for Alex seeking to attend NYU, his demotion, and the impending new baby plague his psyche, and his once secure life seems to be in the hands of his new boss, Carter.<br /><br />Carter starts his new terrifying Corporate Executive job with a surprise divorce, meets Alex early on, eventually falls in love with her, hides his newly treasured relationship from Dan, fires many of Dan's loyal company, and in general unwittingly sets himself up as Dan's nemesis, all the while idolizing Dan for his abilities, his character, his family life, his home in the suburbs,...as well as his daughter.  How all of these elements resolve is a fast-paced comedy/tragedy that results in a large dollop of self-introspection and realignment for all of the characters in this life drama.  No happy-wappy Hollywood finale here, but instead a series of tender lessons learned.<br /><br />The brilliance of Weitz' superb script and direction are ably abetted by standout performances by Topher Grace, Dennis Quaid, and Scarlett Johansson.  Watching them at their craft is sheer pleasure.  This film takes 'comedy' to new heights and it has so much to say about current personal vs corporate status that it should be required viewing.  Highly recommended.

I'm assuming most critics panned this film (it came out in 2004) because the comedy is clean and not based on college, stoner jokes.<br /><br />Carter is your typical career-oriented male whose marriage has just ended. He is brought into the Sales Department as head honcho and tasked with firing a larger number of the sales team. Even though Dan (Quaid) makes the most money, Carter decides to keep him on as wingman.<br /><br />It's your Obi Wan-teaching-Luke plot with the twist of the young boss dating the daughter.<br /><br />Topher Grace does a great job in this role, much like any role he plays. And Dennis Quaid should remember how he can actually make wise movie decisions (like this one) without having to act in the poor direct-to-dvd movies.(Horsemen)<br /><br />The only thing I have to say about Scarlett Johansson, is my amazement at how low her voice is!<br /><br />In Good Company does have some foul language in it but all in all, this is a fun, decent film to rent.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />In Good Company is a rather forgettable movie; it doesn't do itself any favors by eschewing the primary romantic plot halfway through in favor of male bonding between Topher Grace and an annoying Dennis Quaid.</p></br><a href="../users/A1J66TA573ZPRX.html">A1J66TA573ZPRX</a><br/><p>This was not your regular comedy.

Grace then gets to know Quaid and his family a little better by leeching onto him and in the process he becomes involved with Quaid's oldest daughter, played by Scarlett Johanssson (Lost In Translation, Ghost World). Things heat up with Quaid finds out about the relationship and the company he is with starts to crumble. Good natured performances by everyone especially Quaid and Grace. It can be funny sometimes, dramatic sometimes and all the mushy guhsy stuff but it's another winner by writer and director Paul Weitz who also did the movie About A Boy which was a good movie as well. Also starring Margaret Helgenberger (Species, Tv's CSI), Ty Burrell (Dawn Of The Dead '04), Clark Gregg (We Were Soldiers), Selma Blair (Cruel Intentions, Hellboy), David Paymer (Chill Factor, Mr. Saturday Night), John Cho (Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle, Better Luck Tomorrow) and a surprising cameo by Malcolm McDowell (Pact With The Devil, A Clockwork Orange).

But once you actually see the film it is clear the subject is not romance but big business, and this film belongs not to the youngsters but to Quaid.  In fact, the movie is more about the two guys, while Johansson and Marg Helgenberger are largely wasted, although each has good moments.<br /><br />Dan Foreman (Quaid) is past 50 and he thinks finding the box of an empty home pregnancy test in the garbage is the worst thing that could happen to him, but he is sadly mistaken.  Dan works as an ad-exec for a "Sports Illustrated" type magazine and there his biggest concern is trying to land a big client to place print aids in the age of the Internet.  Then the magazine is gobbled up by Teddy K (Malcolm McDowell), a Murodch type media mogul and Carter Duryea (Grace), a hotshot half Dan's age, is sent in to replace him.  The "good" news is that Dan gets to stay on as Carter's "wingman," but only because Carter is scared of his new responsibilities.  We know this because he confides it to Alex (Johansson) in the elevator, not knowing she is Dan's daughter.<br /><br />Dan cannot quit.  For that matter he cannot afford to be "let go," and it is not just because of his age.  Every time another one of his colleagues is "let go" only underscores his vulnerability.  So even when he learns that his boss is dating his daughter there is really nothing he can do about it.  But we know that it is only a matter of time until we get to the straw that breaks this camel's back.  Then the question is whether Dan goes out in a blaze of glory or if a happy ending can be salvaged from this mess.<br /><br />Writer-director Paul Weitz's movie has a couple of things working for it beyond the performances of the cast who largely follow Quaid's lead in inhabiting their roles with an ease that allows us to play along with the rough spots.  The main thing is that the character of Carter is in play.  He has been raised in the corporate world of Teddy K and his eager minions, but some of Dan's wisdom is starting to rub off on the kid.  Maybe he is only hanging on to Dan because firing the father of the woman you love is not the sort of romantic gesture that usually works.  Then there is seeing what the business world he has been living in looks like to those on the outside.<br /><br />The other part that works is the resolution to the story, which is certainly not what anybody would expect given everything that had been set up in the film.  With movies today having an ending that qualifies as anything like a surprise is commendable.  It also makes up for the problem with the big moment when Dan fights back against the new corporate order.  It really is a bit too little, too late, and the conveniently contrived last chance to save the day and the corporadum ex machine the finishes the job have to be taken with a grain of salt.  But "In Good Company" is, after all, a comedy and not a tragedy, which is what a realistic story about corporate take overs almost always has to end up being.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZBOBV9H1HDV.html">A3LZBOBV9H1HDV</a><br/><p>"In Good Company" is impressive!

Weitz, the man behind the similarly-themed "About a Boy" and the polar-oppositely-themed "American Pie" films, is a master of blending real-life drama with accessibly comedy.  Though there is a bit too much of an emphasis on the romance between Scarlett Johansson's and Topher Grace's characters, Weitz has an undeniable gift for capturing achingly truthful human behavior in any given situation.  It is this valuable ability that makes "In Good Company" such a beautiful film.<br /><br />This smart, funny and refreshingly honest portrait of two businessmen at different crossroads in their lives, masquerades as a romantic comedy with the distracting romance between Johansson and Grace, but still manages to get its point across in the most pleasant of ways.  It subtly suggests that audiences examine how they set their priorities and live their lives.  Numerous questions popped into my head during throughout the film, ranging from "What is happiness?" and "When are you really happy?" to "What is really important in my life?"  In a darkened theater, it's a reminder of how anemic, routine and emasculated character-driven comedies released by major studios have become because "In Good Company" is anything but anemic, routine and emasculated.<br /><br />Everyone will find a character to identify with.  Are you the middle-aged businessman/family man struggling to balance the two?  Are you the housewife trying to hold your family together while your husband is always working?  Are you the teenage daughter on the brink of womanhood trying to find your identity?  Are you young and ambitious with a troubled past desperately trying to find meaning and purpose in your life?

Contemporary big business practices are satirized here Big Time! Written and directed by Paul Weitz, this is a film with a fluid storyline interwoven with some poignant threads about how we set our priorities and choose to live our lives. Not corny or too sentimental, the top-notch cast and good acting only increase the viewers' pleasure. Dennis Quaid is fabulous here, as is Topher Grace, his young nemesis. What more could one desire in a movie for a fun evening - except some hot popcorn?<br /><br />Dan Foreman, (Dennis Quaid), is the successful Director of Marketing for Sports America Magazine. He actually likes his work, which is good, since he is a twenty-five year veteran of the ad industry. Dan is a fifty-something family man, married to forty-ish Anne Foreman, (stunning Marg Helgenberger from TV's CSI),  who, we learn early on, is pregnant - a pre-menopausal surprise! It's OK, they're thrilled about the upcoming event! Daughter Alex, (Scarlett Johansson), an eighteen year-old college student, and her slightly younger sister Jana, (Zena Gray), really make-up the kind of warm, loving family anyone would want to belong to. These are decent, intelligent, normal people, who all seem to possess a sense of humor - some quirkier than others.<br /><br />Carter Duryea, (Topher Grace), is a 26 year-old marketing wiz for GlobeCom, a multinational corporate conglomerate, owned and run by a Rupert Murdoch-like figure, "Teddy K," (Malcolm McDowell). Carter has frequently impressed his colleagues and managers with his creativity. His latest success, a cell phone ad campaign which targets preschoolers with dinosaur multi-colored mini phones, that roar instead of ring, has put smiles on GlobeCom employees' faces. Carter is driven, smart, smug and filled with energy fueled by lots of caffeine. He chugs down cup after cup of Starbucks' best. His marriage to a shallow, spoiled, deb type is definitely on the wane. Maybe he should spend more time at home, less at work. But then he wouldn't be GlobeCom's golden boy.<br /><br />When GlobeCom acquires Sports America Magazine, young Turk Carter Duryea is promoted to head of ad sales. Guess whose position he usurps? At least Dan still has a job - as Carter's assistant - his "wing man!" Carter moves into Dan's corner office. Believe it or not, there are worse nightmares. Corporate acquisitions and mergers frequently trigger downsizing and lay-offs. Dan's entire sales team and many other Sports America employees are fired. Meanwhile, Dan's emotions run the gamut from rage to disbelief. And Carter doesn't know too much about magazine sales. He does talk a lot about "synergy," however - a popular buzz word around GlobeCom. In a rousing speech to his new "team," he asks them if they are "psyched for an awesome quarter." Although nobody seems to understand what this all means, they are eager to suck-up to the new boss, so they nod their heads in agreement.<br /><br />"Synergy" we are informed by Teddy K., "means the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. The relationship which the parts have to each other is a part in and of itself - the most empowering, unifying and exciting part." Carter comes to learn what Dan knows from Day 1 - "synergy" does not sell ads!<br /><br />Weitz has structured his film in such a way that as we observe the parallel lives of Foreman and Duryea, we do not villanize the aggressive, yuppie brat. In fact, the further we move into the story, the more sympathetic both Carter and Dan become as characters. Dan may be depressed, humiliated and frustrated about his demotion, but trust me when I say that Carter's life is not the proverbial "bowl of cherries!" The juxtaposition of scenes contrasting the two men's worlds is truly effective. In one instance Dan signs papers taking out a second mortgage to pay for Alex's transfer to NYU, plus the expenses a new baby will incur - while Carter signs his divorce papers and buys a top-of-the-line Porsche. Dan's contented family life, along with his temporary financial difficulties are far removed from the financially secure but very lonely and isolated situation young Carter experiences.<br /><br />Dan invites Carter to dinner after a long business meeting - not through hospitality, but by accident. He never expects Carter to accept. Carter and Dan's daughter Alex click, subtly enough that both parents are unaware. Carter finds in Alex a person he can talk to with honestly, without pretension. Alex experiences similar feelings. The situation really becomes weird when the two begin a relationship, while, at the same time, Dan and Carter's relationship improves - in many ways resembling a father-son situation, even when things turn violent. The dynamic between the two businessmen continually shifts, as do those between Alex and her father, Alex and Carter, Dan and Anne, etc.. There are enough wily twists and turns in the plot to keep things lively throughout. Nothing sappy or contrived here!<br /><br />This is an intelligent film well worth watching. I recommend it highly.<br />JANA</p></br><a href="../users/A1L8HRCM60W0W7.html">A1L8HRCM60W0W7</a><br/><p>This has to be my surprise find of 2004! How many recent films have stood for something fundamental and still managed to be heart-warming and funny without being schticky? Let's count them on an amputee's fingers.<br /><br />The main thrust of In Good Company is to sketch the lives of people caught in the throes of capricious M&As but it offers an accurate glimpse into modern office environments -- motivating co-workers, intra-office hostilities, nepotism and favoritism, and so forth -- much of which is handled with uncanny weight.<br /><br />The movie is not without it lighter moments though, every mention of harebrained co-branding strategies or of platitudes like "synergy" had me grinning and cringing at the same time.<br /><br />While the film's ultimate resolutions are too feel-good for its own good, it couches a great deal of sensitivity for its characters. We readily relate to the folks in the company. The flurry of indiscrimate downsizing is not easy to watch, nor is the apprehension thereof.<br /><br />On the family front, father-daughter relationships are well played out. Dennis Quaid in his bipolar role of experience and naivete guns for the Jack Nicholesque and nearly gets there.<br /><br />But no question, the show belongs to the youngsters. Scarlett Johansson continues in the same understated confident streak as Lost in Translation. Her chemistry with Topher Grace feels very natural, who by the way has to be among the most promising young actors around. His versatile performance hits just the right notes in both measured humor and complex poise. That we're able to feel for his whippersnapper character at all is evidence enough.<br /><br />For its assured near-noirish tone or the soft rock on its soundtrack that captures two ends of the generational spectrum, I'd say this film would make for an exquisite evening rental. You won't be disappointed.</p></br><a href="../users/ABSX5TGEGRH76.html">ABSX5TGEGRH76</a><br/><p>It is extremely rare when a movie made and produced by a major studio such as Universal can feel and entertain like an independent film.  Relatively, of course; while there are defininte Hollywood influences, compared to most of the crap that Hollywood puts out now, this film has a very non-mainstream feel to it.<br />"In Good Company" tells the story of three people living in New York City and its suburbs.  Dan Foreman (Dennis Quaid) is the head of ad sales at Sports America, one of the most prominent sports magazines in the country, and he has been happily employed there for about 30 years.  Everything suddenly changes when the publishing company that owns Sports America is bought out by the super-corporation Globecom, run by the eccentric Teddie K (an uncredited Malcolm McDowell), and soon, the 51-year-old Dan is demoted.  His replacement is the 26-year-old Carter Duryea (Topher Grace), an up-and-coming hot-shot who, while being a very nice guy, has no idea how to run an ad department.  The third member of the movie's trio is Alex Foreman (Scarlett Johansson), who has just transferred to NYU to pursue a degree in creative writing.<br />So at first, Dan obviously harbors a lot of animosity towards Carter.  Carter, however, looks up to Dan, despite the fact that he is Dan's boss, for not only does Dan know what he's doing, but Dan has "the perfect life" according to Carter (sadly for Carter, his wife of seven months, Kimberly [Selma Blair] has just left him- possibly for the second time).  Dan has a loving wife (Marg Helgenberger), two beautiful daughters (the other played by Zena Grey), and a third child on the way.  After Carter is able to get himself invited over for dinner, he and Alex begin a romantic relationship, and for the first time in his life, Carter may be truly happy.<br />The movie told a great story about corporations; while it never really called them evil, it did point out a lot of their shortcomings in comic ways.  I'm pretty sure that the CEO, Teddie K, is a caricature of the CEO of Virgin, and there is something he says that is probably one of the greatest jab at corporations in the movie, but it is very subtle (it may have even been an unintentional joke).  It dealt with selling sodas on all seven continents simultaneously (even Anctarctica!).  However, I was surprised that a movie seemingly about the dangers of corporations had so many corporate sponsorships (Dominoe's and Pepsi were even mentioned by name).<br />Lately, there have been way too many comedies that have had no heart.  In "In Good Company", you actually care about the characters, even when you are laughing with/at them, and believe me, there is a LOT to laugh about.  Furthermore, while all the actors in this movie do a great job, the three lead actors are astounding.  Grace and Quaid play extremely well each other, both when they are at odds as well as when they are friends.  The young Johansson keeps continuing to amaze me with both her talent and her beauty.  I can hardly believe that this girl is barely 20 years old (just about 2 years older than I am); both her acting ability and her appearance are a lot more mature than the average actress her age, which tends to be the over-surplussed "teen queen" (note to Ms. Johansson if you are reading this [not likely, though]: this is a compliment, and I'm sure you appreciate the benefits of not being part of that category).<br />As I said at the beginning of the review, this film had a very independent feel to it.  Unlike most mainstream movies, I was unable to predict the direction in which this film went, and I was very satisfied by the ending, which was definitely not a typical "Hollywood ending".  That's not to say that there weren't a few moments that felt a little contrived, but the majority of the film more than made up for the few instances of corn.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZOF747O5EB6R.html">A1ZOF747O5EB6R</a><br/><p>"In Good Company" proved to be a pleasant way to while away a few hours on a Sunday afternoon.  The viewer is never really challenged but, rather, is taken along for a comfortable journey.<br /><br />In essence, the film involves a series of corporate takeovers in America where a comparatively na?ve young executive Carter Duryea (Topher Grace) and that's not a mis-spelling, is placed in charge of a department formerly managed by Dan Forman (Dennis Quaid).  The 26 year old apparent wunderkind has the 51 year old offsider.  Yet to further muddy the waters, Duryea falls in love with Forman's university student daughter.  Forman, needless to say, is less than impressed.<br /><br />In a somewhat formulaic process, the young pretender learns a few things about life the hard way.  Experience triumphs over youthful ambition.  Duryea leaves for a new, perhaps simpler, life and Forman returns to the fold back in his old job.  The young lovers go there own way.  A lesson is learned and there are no hard feelings.<br /><br />Would I recommend this film to others?  Well, yes, but only as a piece of escapism.  Do not expect to be challenged or made to question motives and outcomes.  See the film just for the fun of it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KEZLJ59C1JVH.html">A3KEZLJ59C1JVH</a><br/><p>"In Good Company" completely blew me away.  Dennis Quaid stars as Dan Foreman, a middle-aged advertising executive at the peak of his career who suddenly finds himself demoted to a lower position when his company is taken over by a large corporation.  To make matters worse, Dan's new boss, Carter Duryea (played by Topher Grace), is young enough to be his son, making for an extremely tense working environment.  When Carter starts dating Dan's college-aged daughter (Scarlett Johansson), things get even more complicated.<br /><br />This film tackles a subject that has unfortunately hit close to home for many Americans these past few years: the fear of losing your job.  We see many characters facing sudden unemployment and the struggle of trying to make ends meet.  The issue of maintaining personal and professional relationships is also explored in the movie, and the cast does an amazing job with this touching and witty script.<br /><br />"In Good Company" is slightly more bittersweet than the television trailers have made it out to be, but there are many amusing moments peppered in among the more serious scenes.  (Carter's first ride in his Porche and Dan's birthday party entrance are two especially hilarious moments that pop into mind.)<br /><br />Overall, this movie was incredible.  It's the kind of movie that you'll want to watch again and again.  I think everyone should make the effort to see this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2DSXA1E02C86D.html">A2DSXA1E02C86D</a><br/><p>As you drive off to the 9 to 5 in your company Lexus, consider how secure is your grip on that corner office with a view.<br /><br />At age 52, Dan Foreman (Dennis Quaid) is the veteran, successful, and respected advertising manager for a national sports magazine. Life is good. Sure, there are speed bumps: his late-forties wife, Ann (Marg Helgenberger) suddenly announces she's pregnant with their third child, and his eldest daughter, Alex (Scarlett Johansson), is off to live in the Big Apple and attend NYU. But, a second mortgage will take care of all this. Then, the publication is bought by a corporate takeover shark, and Dan's office and position are hijacked by Carter Duryea (Topher Grace), an upstart executive literally half Foreman's age. Though not fired himself, Dan is relegated to being Carter's "wingman", and must watch as other members of his old team are axed. Oh, and did I mention that Carter is seduced by Alex and lands in her bed?<br /><br />Perhaps Duryea should have been scripted to be, in the eyes of the audience, more callow and unredeemably meaner. At first, it appears that this may be the case. But, after Carter's brand new Porsche sports car is crunched by an SUV as he drives off the dealer's lot, he acquires a conscience, sensitivity, and the viewers' sympathy. Thus, the ending, during which balance at the office is restored, seemed oddly unsatisfying and open-ended.<br /><br />The best reasons to see IN GOOD COMPANY are Quaid, Johansson, and Grace, all of whose characters are basically decent and incredibly engaging. None of the obvious tensions result in irretrievably rancorous conflict between the three, and so the film becomes primarily a comedy with dramatic overtones rather than a drama with comedic elements.<br /><br />IN GOOD COMPANY is a 4-star piece of inoffensive fluff perfectly suitable for holiday viewing by the whole family - eminently watchable and enjoyable, but not memorable.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HJB9J5O5CLPB.html">A2HJB9J5O5CLPB</a><br/><p>Topher Grace is the finest young actor in film.  Yeah, he's better than DiCaprio and all the other young pretenders.  Anyone who hasn't caught his fresh-face boyish looks in P.S. has missed a gem of wry comedy.  In Good Company, we get more of the same.  Movie stars have a shtick and Topher takes over where Tom Hanks left off, but with a difference, Topher is manlier in his sentimentality.  When he hugs Dennis Quaid at the end of the film, he does so as a young man that has learned a tough lesson, a man that has matured.  I love Tom Hanks, but there's always a hanky ready, it's expected.<br /><br />The other great thing about In Good Company, it's a film for adults about business.  Sure, corporations buy each other, spin off a department, shuttle their employees about, provide benefits like healthcare, education, life insurance, and a decent salary. They also fire workers for all kinds of unintelligible reasons.  Personally, I love corporations and I don't care what out-of-touch Hollywood Liberals think. The folks that work at corporations are no better or worse than in most microcosms.  Maybe academics and film actors are perfect in their love for humanity, but corporate man (Dennis Quaid)is concerned with paying his mortgage, sending the daughter (Scarlett Johansson) to college, and doing a good job, an ethical job at work.<br /><br />Young hotshot Grace causes mayhem when he becomes boss to the much older Quaid, and more mayhem when he beds Quaid's athletic daughter.  None of these events happens because Grace is a bad person; he's a corporate workaholic that has succeeded right out of college beyond his wildest dreams but without a family life and without a tender wife.  In fact, Grace is alone with his Porsche.  Quaid's family looks like the Garden of Eden to our glib executive.<br /><br />Will Topher Grace find freedom from frivolous "pseudo-religious corporate think," and can Quaid save his job, coming to terms with his middle-age crisis.  Watch this delightful film to find out.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>What's so refreshing about IN GOOD COMPANY is is lack of predictability and cloying sentimentality.  Dennis Quaid and Topher Grace are marvelous as the protagonists of the movie, and they get fine support from Marg Helgenberger and Scarlet Johannson.  The relationships that develop form the heart of the movie, and it is both comic and bittersweet.  Grace is a revelation as he captures the youth but competitive aggression of a new boss, and Quaid captures the frustration in having to work for someone half his age.  All in all, a very entertaining and well done film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GMUNBN9HKRZS.html">A2GMUNBN9HKRZS</a><br/><p>This is a thoroughly enjoyable movie, from start to finish. Perfect acting, direction, dialogue, shots, editing. The music was icing on the cake. In a way, it sort of reminded me of "The Graduate", back in the day, with Dustin Hoffman. Not in the story, but the feel, and lessons learned. Light hearted, but serious. A film an adult will appreciate. Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A2JYIDH7JIG48H.html">A2JYIDH7JIG48H</a><br/><p>In Good Company isn't a hilarious comedy, nor a serious, "edge-of-your-seat" drama - yet something about it made it one of the most absorbing movies of 2005, pleasantly fascinating and easy to watch.  The story is about a middle-aged sales exec (Dennis Quaid) who's company is sold, with over-night demotion and a new boss (Topher Grace), a young whipper-snapper half his age and pathetically callow, though exuding infectious confidence and ambition of youth.  The new boss even naively falls for his older worker's daughter, oblivious to the obvious impracticality.<br /><br />So without a lot of hilarious comedy nor a suspenseful plotline, what makes In Good Company so interesting?  Two things I think.  One, the movie starts out with a premise that lends itself to extremely cynical comedy (like the Simpsons), but very realistically and gradually rises above that temptation to a conclusion that's uplifting in spite of the realistic situation.  Second, the unusual platonic chemistry between the two male leads seems real and strangely appealing, like you want to know these people and root for their friendship.  You don't see that done well in the movies often, and this is probably the most effective case since Cary Grant and Ronald Coleman in Talk Of The Town (in which they were in a romantic triangle with Jean Arthur, so it's really not the same situation).<br /><br />I'm afraid you'll just have to watch the movie to see what I mean.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EMDSTJDUE6B0.html">A1EMDSTJDUE6B0</a><br/><p>This is one of those films that reinforces good values and "what life is all about". I like the way it ended -- more realistic than most films. The acting is pretty good and it moves along at a pretty good clip. Quaid is exceptional and you really wish he was your dad, or you were him. Too few people like that in the corporate world.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>I saw this movie without really any expectations and was completely taken away by how great this movie really was.  It's one of the best films I've seen that really show the feelings between father and daughter, husband and wife, boss and employee...it was just all around a great, feel good film.  It really did make me smile.  I'm not sure what oscar season it would fall into, last years (which would be a shame) or this years but I would hope to see Quaid and Grace up for oscars, moreso Quaid than any.  I've always felt Dennis was a great actor, but this I feel was a turning point in his career...it proved to me that he is a talent to take VERY seriously.  Great job, and I'm pulling for you come oscar season.</p></br><a href="../users/A2XGJ56VCFOKKZ.html">A2XGJ56VCFOKKZ</a><br/><p>I was very surprised by this film, as it was fresh, clever, and not predictable. It plays with your expectations and goes in a surprising direction each time. The premise reeled me in, as this film is about a man who has been at a Sports Magazine his whole working life and during a merger, he suddenly finds himself working for someone young enough to be his son. Such tensions are relevant in today's immoral corporate culture where loyalty and longevity are no longer valued, where people are only as good as their last ad campaign.<br /><br />Dennis Quaid as an actor has done an amazing thing in this century, as his roles and movie choices have improved. I'm not sure if this is positive side effect of his falling out with Meg Ryan (whose career, on the other hand, only suffered since their 2000 breakup). Between Kevin Costner and Dennis Quaid, Kevin was my favorite in the 1990s, but now I think Dennis Quaid has the upper hand. He is great in this film and comes across as a decent person...someone you'd love to have as a boss.<br /><br />Topher Grace is amazing, as he is in every film I've seen him in so far. He has the nervous, fidgety, inexperienced, fresh-out-of-college-and-in-way-over-his-head persona down perfectly. He makes a good team with Dennis Quaid and I like the juxtaposition between the breakup of Topher's marriage against the strength of Dennis' marriage. What I get from watching this film is that while our corporations may value the young hotshots who lack experience but make up for that in arrogance, that sometimes, experience does matter. A person who believes in his job and is committed to it is a far better person to be promoted than one who is only using the company as a stepping stone to bigger and better things. If anyone doubts this...look at Enron and the lack of loyalty to the company there. Incompetence should never be rewarded, no matter how "brilliant" some upstart might seem.<br /><br />The ending wasn't typical of most Hollywood films and its a logical ending that works out for the best for everyone involved. Scarlett Johannsen is good in this film, and even though I didn't buy her relationship with Topher Grace, it was an interesting subplot to the whole film. Besides the story and acting, I also loved the music of the soundtrack. All in all, the film makes some good points about our corporate culture even though the big dramatic scene was a bit of a stretch (when Dennis Quaid questions the head honcho). None of the flaws take away from the overall beauty of this film. It is worth seeing and owning.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BEU7GPGNIG44.html">A2BEU7GPGNIG44</a><br/><p>This was an interesting and captivating film.  Captivating because you really will want to watch it to the end.  One thing though, I really didn't consider this a comedy.  It didn't have the laugh out loud funny moments that you would expect in a comedy and the funny moments seemed forced and placed in the film only to give it a comedic edge (a car getting wrecked, an accident during a basketball game).  There is really something un-funny about a man threatened with losing his job when his family needs him the most, and to see his co-workers lose their jobs.  The Topher Grace character was really great in this film as young "Carter," a hotshot marketing guy who finds himself thrust into ad sales.  The relationship between Dan (Dennis Quaid) and Carter's daughter also suprised me.  I was under the impression before I saw the film that Carter was going to be his new boss and then he was going to find out that she was dating his daughter.  Not so, he meets the daughter for a second time at Dan's house.  I didn't think the relationship between Alex (Scarlet Johanson) and Carter was well developed.  It was like they chilled one time and then were on the fast track.  At the beginning of their relationship (which received very little screen time), she seems to have no concerns or regards for getting intimate with her fathers boss.  At times I was wondering if she was getting close to him to help save her fathers job.  Another thing about her character I found was odd, it seemed to me that her voice changed during the movie.  In the beginning when she was in full tom boy mode her voice had much more base than when she let her hair down and started attending college in the city.  Overall, it is an entertaining movie, nothing I would want to watch again, but it was interesting although a bit predictable at times.  Dan fell down so much you just knew he was going to make a rebound before the movie ended.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D3XQC2DIT.html">A1D3XQC2DIT</a><br/><p>I will admit that for In Good Company my expectations were high. There has not been a movie out in a while that I have anticipated as I did this. My cards are now all on the table. You can accuse me of no bias. That said, let's begin. The movie started off as I would expect a movie which I had tauted as my favorite movie 2005 (to date) before even having seen it would.<br /><br />I had my doubts about Topher Grace's ability to play a more serious role. I think it is a safe assumption that you will never catch me sneakily watching the Butterfly Effect, not all characters from "That 70's Show" can deviate from the Comedy realm. He did however do a great job.<br /><br />Scarlett Johannson is not my favorite actress. She often times comes across as cold towards other characters, even in times when she is trying to be warm to them. In In Good Company she took this to a new level. Her family is shown as highly functional. Despite the loving nature of their family bonds, she seems to shy away from her father (Dennis Quaid) on more than one occassion. I cannot say that this detracted from the overall feel of the movie, but it certainly did not help; it just happened to be something that I noticed.<br /><br />Dennis Quaid did well. I was glad to see him get a decent role. I am not not saying anything bad about Day After Tomorrow...<br /><br />There were a few times that I was afraid the movie was going to turn predictible. I thought for sure a couple of things were going to happen at certain times that would have immediately ruined my opinion of the film. My fears never became reality, however, and I was able to go on enjoying the movie.<br /><br />As the movie started to wind down, a few things happened that as they occurred I noted that I disagreed with how they were done. I am not sure if I just needed to disagree with each piece in turn to realize that there was no other way to do it or maybe there was some other reason. As the movie ended I enjoyed a quick introverted moment where I smiled to myself and thought that the way the movie ended was the right way. The only way.<br /><br />One thing that I almost never pay any attention to is the soundtrack as it plays over the movie. Often times I am asked to help identify a movie in one a particular song played and I am forced to apologize for being no help. Very rarely are the songs that play throughout the movie of any consequence to me. That being said, the soundtrack to In Good Company was very good. The soundtrack features bands such as Iron & Wine and The Soundtrack of Our Lives.<br /><br />I did not love this movie with every inch of my soul as I had expected to do. I cannot say that I was disappointed with it though. The more I think about the movie, the more satisfied I am with it. I stand by my decision to see In Good Company and recommend it to you.</p></br><a href="../users/AW99SBGWEXP0J.html">AW99SBGWEXP0J</a><br/><p>Dan Foreman (Quaid) is the Sales Director at Sports America magazine.  He is a very good salesman who has built relationships with his customers.  When Sports America is taken over by Worldcom, Dan (and his co-workers) find their world turned on end.  Dan finds himself demoted to "wingman" for the new boss, Carter Duryea (Grace).  26-year old Carter is not a salesman, but he has had success in the business world.  He is in over his head, and must rely on Dan's assistance if he wants any chance to succeed.<br /><br />After seizing an opportunity to come over for dinner at Dan's house, Carter is amazed by the nice life that Dan has put together for himself.  Coming off of a failed marriage, Carter longs for what Dan has, and soon finds himself dating Dan's daughter Alex (Johannson) behind Dan's back.<br /><br />"In Good Company" is a movie about relationships and the business world.  The interaction between Quaid and Grace and Grace and Johannson feels genuine, and that is the main reason that this movie works.  There is nothing too original here story-wise, sometimes grasping at long-time plot devices, but it is the start interaction with each other that makes this movie stand out.  Dennis Quaid gets to be the likeable guy that most see him as in real life, and Topher Grace gets a chance to shine on the big screen as the good-hearted young man that he seems to be in real life.<br /><br />And, while this movie does rely on formula to some extent, director Paul Weitz is gutsy enough to not give any of the characters a clear answer to their problems.  It feels real, and that is why "In Good Company" succeeds.</p></br><a href="../users/A33CLVW2K7SL1P.html">A33CLVW2K7SL1P</a><br/><p>This was a movie that I expected to be light, funny, romantic, and above all, formulaic. I was right on all but the last assumption.<br /><br />This wasn't a deep movie: it's classified as both drama and comedy. In other words, this isn't Million Dollar Baby. There are extremely funny moments in the film. When Quaid, playing fifty two year old Dan Foreman, tries to dunk during a basketball game, the ball gets stuck between the rim and the backboard, and Foreman takes a wicked fall, hurting his arm. That type of physical humor is always good for a laugh.<br /><br />There's the obvious comedic element, of course, of Carter Duryea (played very convincingly and impressively by Topher Grace) taking Foreman's old job after a corporate take over, being Foreman's boss. (It's a bit strange referring to someone as "Foreman" when that person isn't Topher Grace; especially when Grace is in the film.)<br /><br />There's romance: Duryea falls in love with Foreman's daughter, Alex (Scarlet Johannsen) in an interesting twist on falling in love with the boss's daughter. Here, he falls in love with the former boss's daughter.<br /><br />Here's what we expect.<br /><br />-Foreman's wife is pregnant. He is excited, and asks if it is a boy. He wants a boy, and this generally means it will be a boy, in the very final scenes of the typical formulaic movie.<br /><br />-Duryea and Alex fall in love and have a secret romance. Alex breaks up with him after (another hysterical moment) her father catches them. There's the typical boy-meets-girl, boy-loses-girl, boy-gets-girl setup here).<br /><br />-When Foreman catches his daughter with Duryea, he decks Duryea. One would imagine that a boss would automatically fire their employee.<br /><br />As I'm writing this, I realize there are several others that I could outline, and then say: some happen, some don't. But the others give away much of the fun of the movie, and I don't want to spoil that for anyone.<br /><br />I expected to walk away from this film enjoying it mildly, giving it perhaps three stars, but walked out liking it much more because it didn't do what I expected it to do. Not that the plot twists are going to knock your socks off like the ending of The Sixth Sense, but they're still fun.</p></br><a href="../users/A1129LM24YWSZV.html">A1129LM24YWSZV</a><br/><p>In "In Good Company," Dan Foreman (Dennis Quaid), a happily married man with two daughters, is demoted from his job as a magazine ad sales director when his publication is purchased by a larger company. Serving as his new boss is Carter Duryea (Topher Grace), an upstart 26 year-old with little practical experience in ad sales. Making matters more complicated, Foreman's daughter, Alex (Scarlett Johansson) wants to transfer to NYU (a much more expensive school than SUNY, where she was previously taking classes), and he's just found out that he has another child on the way. Duryea's own life is no less complicated. His wife has just left him, and he knows that he's not quite qualified for his new job. When Careter meets Alex, he almost immediately falls for her, and the two must keep the relationship secret from her father. What results is a wrenchingly true portrait of human relationships.<br /><br />I thought this was a great film. What can I say about Dennis Quaid? First of all, he still looks great. And throughout his career, the guy has kept working. He turns in a great performance in this movie. His character deals with alot of difficult situations, and Quaid allows the viewer to see how Foreman struggles with many of his decisions. But Foreman always acts with the kind of touching, good-guy grace that endears you to him. I thought that overall, this was Quaid's film. He really shines in it, displaying all of the acting chops he's gained in a long career of experience. Topher Grace is wonderful as well as the smooth-talking, ambitious Carter Duryea, who suffers from loneliness and an aimlessness that he can't, at first, comprehend. Scarlett Johansson, as Alex, also offers a subtle performance. Some of her work near the end of the film is really exceptional.<br /><br />This is not necessarily an uplifting movie. The characters are, by turns, depressed, hopeless, scared, annoyed. But life is messy. And this movie portrays real life, with all of its uncomfortable realities. While the film does not end on a depressing note, all of the character's struggles are not wrapped up in a neat little bow. Some ambiguity is evident in the ending.<br /><br />This would be a good film for teens, as there is no nudity and little language. There are also no graphic love scenes.</p></br><a href="../users/A3RTMB76CJWY9U.html">A3RTMB76CJWY9U</a><br/><p>In Good Company is a fine movie that delivers just about what it needs to deliver to keep us all entertained, though it is unlikely that, once seen, you'll feel any compelling need to see it again. Unlike other recent films/shows that poke fun at corporate life such as Office Space or The Office, In Good Company never really seems willing to take off the gloves or throw its haymaker. Yes--there is a little ribbing on use of buzz words and concepts, such as "synergy," and the one corporate kiss-up who gets his just desserts in the end, but In Good Company is too interested in its human tale to ever really stick it to the suits like we all know they deserve.<br /><br />And then, in the romantic angle, again In Good Company feels a little milquetoast, strange to say. The romance which drives the plot from mid-way to the end doesn't ever feel compelling; it tugs no heartstrings, and the ending is weak and unsatisfying on this score, too.<br /><br />The best thing about the film has to be how it presents both Dennis Quaid's and Topher Grace's characters sympathetically and as real people. We understand them both, and their conflicts, and root for them both throughout. There are a lot of movies that unfairly only show one side of a conflict, and In Good Company keeps clear of that failing.<br /><br />In the end, an enjoyable movie to watch, and good for a date in an established, comfortable relationship (find something more romantic for the first or second dates, if possible). We won't be quoting it in two years time, watching it in five or remembering it in ten, but for today, it's decent fare.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MUD2VY9HWFXQ.html">A2MUD2VY9HWFXQ</a><br/><p>Every now and again, Hollywood churns out the kind of respectable movie that has it all...good acting, well written dialogue, fine direction, and some honest comedy and drama. These are the elements that make up "In Good Company"; a very bright film that explores coming of age on both sides of the fence.<br /><br />Dan Foreman (Dennis Quaid) is a 51 year old who has made a career by selling ad space for "Sports America". He has a well established team of employees beneath him and is very much respected by his peers.<br /><br />Sports America has been bought out by "Globecom", and with the "take over" comes some restructuring and some "cleaning out".<br /><br />Enter 26 year old Carter Duryea (Toper Grace), a Globecom employee given the opportunity of a lifetime to work at "Sports America"; cut their costs and increase their revenue.<br /><br />As Carter begins demoting and firing people, he leans to Dan for support because he is young and really has no idea what the hell he is going to do. Dan isn't impressed by the young Carter, and never fails to point out Carter's obvious flaws and lack of experience.<br /><br />Carter IS trying, he just has no direction. When his marriage fails and his wife bails out because she is apparently not getting any attention, Carter begins to get quite lonely; despite his financial success. He works his new team on weekends, and is pretty desperate for attention.<br /><br />Carter happens to weasel his way over to Dan's house one weekend evening for dinner, much to Dan's regret. During the visit, he gets a chance to talk with Dan's daughter Alex (Scarlett Johansson), who is about to start college at NYU. A future encounter on a city street starts a secret relationship ship between Carter and Alex.<br /><br />During this time, Carter is firing people left and right at the ordering of his Globecom superiors. Poor Dan is losing his whole team, not to mention his faith in his career. He puts up with Carter, but doesn't really extend his friendship beyond work.<br /><br />"In Good Company" works on so many levels. Dennis Quaid is awesome as the fatherly and wise Dan Foreman. Toper Grace is establishing himself quite admirably as a fine young actor. He plays Carter with much more honesty than arrogance. Sure Carter is a young, inexperienced hot shot; but Grace pulls off the character so that you really do sympathize with him and his dilemma.<br /><br />The chemistry between Quaid and Grace is completely believable, relatable, and intriguing to watch. The supporting cast of characters are all fine actors-but the two male leads really nail their characters to perfection.<br /><br />For this reviewer, "In Good Company" refelected what I thought of as a metaphor in the lives of older vs. younger in Hollywood as well as in corporate America. It's as if you have your more mature & well established actor (Quaid), passing the torch of experience to his younger nemesis turned ally (Grace). That's just my opinion of how well these two actors played off each other. After all, Hollywood is a corporation in itself.<br /><br />I also thought the movie had a fine & honest ending that leaves the viewer very satisfied.  It doesn't try to end on a phony, syrupy, & sappy note; like so much other Hollywood tripe these days.<br /><br />Just a  fantastic film..........all the way around.</p></br><a href="../users/A2QHM5HBSIXRL4.html">A2QHM5HBSIXRL4</a><br/><p>I'm not sure how much attention we can pay to the 'official' amazon review pasted above here, given that Dennis Quaid's character is referred to as 'Dave Foreman.'  In this character-driven, conversational movie, Quaid's Dan Foreman is addressed as Dan no fewer than 50 times.<br /><br />That aside, this is good film, certainly one of the better ones that 'gets' the work environment, circa 2005.  Weitz focuses on the human side of the crazed pace of mergers and acquisitions.  There's a cost involved, and often it's not pretty.  That's embodied here in some good performances, most notably by the always outstanding David Paymer...a good man caught in a numbers game.  Topher Grace is also outstanding...his caffeine-fueled rant about "Synergy" (the film's original working title) starts in a halting, nervous fashion and escalates into highfalutin grabs at the opportunities of marrying the Sports America and Krispity Krunch brands.  He's almost convinced himself by the end of it.<br /><br />This speech is echoed later in an uncredited performance by Malcolm McDowell as the rapacious Teddy K (who I'll say looks to be a cross between Teddy Forstman and Rupert Murdoch, even though the story line itself closely resembles the events of 'new media' giant AOL's takeover of Time Warner).<br /><br />In both cases, it's Quaid/Foreman who calls the bluff on synergy.  Quaid's character does business the old-fasioned way: based on relationships.  As a filmmaker, Weitz takes the time to show you the bonds he tries to build with auto-parts entrepreneur Phillip Baker Hall.<br /><br />Weitz's winning streak continues here.  Everyone (especially obsessive Nick Hornby fans like myself) doubted he could break free from his 'American Pie' roots to adapt Hornby's 'About A Boy' for the big screen.  Not only did he succeed, it was *better* than the book...which is really saying something.</p></br><a href="../users/A25HYPL2XKQPZB.html">A25HYPL2XKQPZB</a><br/><p>In Good Company features Dennis Quaid, Topher Grace and Scarlett Johannsen as Dan, Carter and Dan's daughter Alex.  When Dan's company is sold to a conglomerate, Carter is sent in by headquarters to run the company and becomes his new boss.<br /><br />Carter is Dan's boss despite the fact he is just a kid at 26 and Dan is 51 and has just found out his wife is having another baby.  Carter is a workaholic whose work habits just cost him his marriage.  Carter soon clings to dad and views him like the father he never had.  Dan meanwhile struggles to maintain his dignity after being demoted and to pay for his upcoming baby and his daughter's college bills.<br /><br />I expected In Good Company to be a romantic comedy of some sort.  Scarlett Johannsen as Alex seduces Carter for no reason and their romance blossoms despite the fact we are given no reason for them to like each other.  The romance exists only to provide conflict between Dan and Carter.<br /><br />In Good Company is about Dan and Carter.  Alex is there just to pad the movie and to provide motivation for Dan and Carter to act upon.<br /><br />I enjoyed this movie.  Dan's speech about corporations not caring for the little guy didn't really bother me because in the end, Dan gladly decides to work for whatever big corporation owns his company.<br /><br />This is a fun, quick movie that most people should enjoy, just don't expect any romance.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ.html">A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ</a><br/><p>In Good Company is a well-made, entertaining film that reveals the soullessness of our modern "Who Moved My Cheese?" society.  Companies are bought and sold like common chattel, dedicated workers are sacrificed to the cash cow of corporatism, business leaders make hundreds of millions of dollars by uttering meaningless catch phrases and big words while proving themselves quite oblivious to the concept of actually serving their customers (or their employees), and the depersonalization of the business world leads to corporate scandals and broken lives.  In this film, the old school meets the new school; it's not always pretty, but it is entertaining - and educational.<br /><br />Dan Foreman (Dennis Quaid) has it pretty good; he's got a great wife and two teenaged daughters, he makes a good living doing something he enjoys - overseeing the ad sales for Sports America magazine, and he's happy in his quiet, stable life.  Then, change crashes down upon him in wave upon wave.  He learns that his wife is pregnant (which is the last thing he expected at their age), Sports America is sold to a big conglomerate, he's replaced by some college kid know-it-all, and his eldest daughter wants to transfer to NYU (second mortgage, here we come).  At least he does get to keep his job - he's just reporting to young Carter Duryea (Topher Grace), who has zero years experience compared to his twenty-three years in the position he just lost.  As he watches long-time clients disappear and good employees that he hired lose their jobs, he thinks things can't get much worse - and then he finds out that his daughter is sleeping with his young boss.  One can understand why he gets a little grumpy at times.<br /><br />Carter is an interesting character, and I must say Topher Grace acquits himself quite well in the role.  Initially, he is just annoyingly gung ho about business and his bright and shiny future - in a word, he is one of the mindless zombies inspired by business moguls such as Teddy K (Malcolm McDowell).  It's synergy this, synergy that, teamwork, blah blah blah - we've all heard that new brand of corporate nonsense.  It would be easy to dislike such a character (and Dan certainly does dislike him - at first).  We examine Carter's life in juxtaposition to that of Dan, though, and we see the human being behind the suit.  His wife has left him after seven months, and he's so lonely that he boondoggles Dan into inviting him home for dinner.  There he renews an earlier brief acquaintance with Dan's daughter Alex (Scarlett Johansson), and that lays the foundation for their blooming relationship - which is kept hush hush from Dan, of course.  Dads have a way of finding out their daughters' little secrets, though.<br /><br />It is most interesting to watch the relationship between Dan and Carter develop as the film proceeds.  You may not be able to teach an old dog new tricks, but that doesn't mean that old dog doesn't have a few things to teach the pups, and Carter begins to understand that - just as he begins to see his fellow suits in a new light after Teddy K himself pays the company a visit.  As for Dan, he comes to see the deficiencies in Carter's life, and a weird kind of father-son relationship eventually emerges as Carter begins to change.  The ending is somewhat ambiguous, but so is life itself.<br /><br />This is a very human film on all counts.  It has its funny moments, but I would not really consider this a comedy in the traditional sense.  It's a story about life, an intelligent film that proceeds with a sense of honesty and believability that is rare in movies these days.  It does tend to skewer modern business practices (and rightly so), reinforcing the traditional values that built the great economic engine that today's business fatcats are exploiting for their own personal gain.  I would hope that some of the real-life equivalents of Teddy K would watch this film, but they are all too blinded by their egos to learn anything from it, anyway.</p></br><a href="../users/A3JPFWKS83R49V.html">A3JPFWKS83R49V</a><br/><p>Dennis Quaid is one of the all- time Hollywood champions of "B" movies. He does a decent acting job in most of his films, but the movies he has starred in over the years have mostly been mediocre. It seems to be a curse that Mr. Quaid cannot escape. And "In Good Company" is no exception. It's a very average film in terms of the storyline and the direction, with some decent performances by the leads.<br /><br />The story of this film centers around Quaid's character Dan Forman and his new boss, Carter Duryea, who is played by relative newcomer Topher Grace. This new kid on the block is much younger than Dan Forman and there is tension in the air from the beginning. To add to the trauma, Carter slowly develops a love interest for Forman's daughter Alex, who is played by Scarlett Johansson. This forms the basic plot of the movie.<br /><br />There are a few morals to this story, but they are things that we have seen and heard many times before in other movies. At one point, for example, Carter realizes that playing the role of corporate executive isn't quite the fun ride he envisioned. And Quaid's character has a crisis of sorts with accepting change- both with his daughter and with his career. This forms the basis of the movie's conflicts, and it isn't very original.<br /><br />Another problem I had with this movie is that there just isn't anything very memorable about it. There are no incredibly funny moments or classic lines from the characters. It's just an ordinary film about an ordinary guy who has to learn how to cope with change.<br /><br />In Good Company is an ok film, and it makes for a pleasant enough way to spend a rainy evening at home. I didn't find anything particularly great about this film. But I cannot say that it's bad, either. It ranks right up there with most of Dennis Quaid's films: Ok, but something you will forget you ever saw in a matter of days.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TK6R2JSC97HL.html">A1TK6R2JSC97HL</a><br/><p>Dennis Quaid is Dan Foreman, an ad-exec who did pretty well.  Living the life that most of us can only wish for, Foreman sells ad space for a sports magazine, has a great family and the kind of work-place camaraderie you only see in sit-coms.  That is, until his mag is acquired by a power-mad Australian tycoon known only as "Teddy K" (though immediately recognizable as Malcom Macdowell).  In the evitable shake-up, Foreman is demoted and must now serve one of Teddy K's instant-MBA monsters, a man who looks more like an intern than an exec.  Carter Duryea (Topher Grace), a man whose blood supply is polluted by large concentrations of caffeine, is liitle older than half Foreman's age when he becomes Foreman's boss.  (A birthday in the middle of the movie puts Foreman well over the milestone of serving a man half as old as he is.)  Full of corporate oomph while a compulsively nice guy, Duryea is emotionally hollow and compulsively self-centered.  Forced to downsize Dan's department, Duryea tries to buddy up to ad execs who know to expect an axing.  Because he needs Dan, Duryea latches onto his new "wingman" in a big way, inviting himself over to Dan's house for a sunday dinner, and unwittingly falling for Foreman's college-age daughter.  Knowing that Dan's sensitive enough about his precarious job situation, Duryea wisley keeps the romance secret, but Foreman's too smart to remain in the dark for long.<br /><br />This was more of a promising idea than a great movie.  The dialog is pretty thin, the characterizations quite shallow<br /><br />and the dilemmas never explored.  Though Dan's big worry is of becoming a dinosaur made extinct by a newer (and younger) breed of exec like Duryea, the story never realizes that fear.  Job security aside, Teddy K's sycophantic minions never put Dan's skills at risk - we never have any reason to believe that Carter's breed will actually outlast Dan's more experienced ways, and certainly not with Teddy K's rantings of "synergy".  (The concept is meant to make individual components of larger companies stronger by allowing them to work in concert; in practice, and in this story, they prove more hazard than help since, as Dan finds, former clients are now competitors of Teddy K's other acquisitions) Then there's Carter's secret romance with Alex (Scarlet Johanson), Dan's pride and joy.  Improbably they connect, though the script glosses over the attraction (we see them walking and talking, and guess they're sleeping around).  Pretty soon, we begin to wonder whether she's got as much interest in a future with Duryea as she has in her past with her father, and whether she'll discard him as his wife did in the beginning of the movie.<br /><br />WHY YOU SHOULD SEE THIS MOVIE:  "Company" offers some fine performances by Dennis Quaid (the dinosaur most of us wish we could morph into shortly before extinction), and Topher Grace as Duryea, who seems oblivious to the humiliation his age inflicts on Dan; There's also David Paymer as a less fortunate colleague of Dan's, and a string of smaller palyers who somehow come alive despite the deadening script.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B3Z2QHW3V35S.html">A2B3Z2QHW3V35S</a><br/><p>When I first watched this movie I was bored out of my mind. I gave it a second chance to night. It wasn't as bad as I remembered it. I wouldn't say it is a movie for everyone.</p></br><a href="../users/A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ.html">A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ</a><br/><p>Today's Hollywood produces movie after movie about humanity's negativity and our inevitable dystopian future.  If not that, then the movie is an obvious homage to something so outlandish that it's not to be taken realistically.  In Good Company, however, takes the opposite approach, showing genuine familial, work, and romantic relationships.  With nearly no twists or surprises, almost no exaggeration whatsoever, this movie delivers as intended.<br /><br />Dan Foreman (Dennis Quaid) is the director of marketing for a company being purchased by a multination conglomerate.  Corporate restructuring brings about the obvious changes.  As a result, most of Dan's team is fired, and his position is usurped by Carter Duryea (Topher Grace) - as the young, brash, conceited yet overmatched, buzz-word spouting whiz-kid - making Dan the second fiddle.  Just like a formulaic black-white movie, where the white character inevitably learns to dance from the black character, Carter soon learns from the wiser, experienced, and worldly sage of marketing.  Just think of Dan as Miyagi and Carter as Daniel-San; it only takes one good butt-kicking, literally in this movie, to realize how incompetent and unprepared you are when faced with an experienced adversary.<br /><br />When Carter meets Dan's georgous, college-bound daughter Alex (Scarlett Johansson), sparks fly, adding yet another juxtaposed subplot amidst the struggles of life, love, and corporate advancement.<br /><br />Overall it's a decent, albeit predictable, somewhat bland movie that if nothing more, provides a reason to ogle Johansson and see Quaid turn in a great performance.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>I looked but I just couldn't find anything here I didn't like.  When I originally saw this movie in the theater I was the only one who really just adored it and so I thought that maybe I was just overreacting, that there was bound to be something I overlooked that brings this movie down a notch.  I've seen `In Good Company' about ten times not and I still have yet to find anything wrong with it.<br /><br />`In Good Company' is a smart comedy about reaching a crossroads in life, whether you're middle-aged or merely reaching an early peek.  Dan Foreman is 51.  He has a steady job, a good marriage and two beautiful daughters.  Then the company Dan works for gets bought out and he finds himself not only demoted, which can strike a mans masculinity in its own, but he finds himself now taking orders from a kid half his age with no experience whatsoever.  That `kid' is hotshot Carter Duryea, a 26-year-old newlywed whose life is a complete contrast to that of Dan.  Carter and his wife Kimberly are already having problems because Carter doesn't seem to know how to separate work from his personal life (personally I just love Kimberly's line "don't try to sell me" because it really explains the emotional level that Carter is at).  Carter has potential and he has spirit and he has drive but he lacks the maturity that Dan possesses.  Ironically (or maybe not so much) Dan lacks some of Carter's qualities and thus you have the foundation for a superb father/son/daughter/boss film about emotional growth, understanding and acceptance.<br /><br />Carter meets and falls for Dan's eldest daughter Alex who is just moving from home to attend college and branching off to start her own life.  The very idea of Alex moving out on her own scares Dan and so to spare her father any more anxiety she keeps her relationship with Carter a secret, but of course we know that that secret can't stay hidden forever.<br /><br />What helps elevate `In Good Company' are the beautifully fleshed out performances, especially from the two leads, Quaid and Grace.  Dennis Quaid is an extremely polished actor who I feel delivers knock out performance after knock out performance.  I have always enjoyed watching him act, and here he really grasps who Dan is.  What I appreciate about Dan is that he is not an overly complicated man.  He works hard, he loves his wife, he loves his children; he faces bouts of insecurity and bouts of jealousy.  He is normal, just like you and me.  Quaid understands this and plays him such.  Topher Grace is equally impressive.  I have always said that Grace was the greatest of the `That 70s Show' alumni.  Sure, Kutcher is funny but Grace is an actor, a real actor.  He can bring the funny but he can also bring heart.  As Carter he brings an air of honesty to his character.  Sure, he's quick witted and funny but he's relatable and understandable and sympathetic.  I love the scene between Carter and Alex when he's trying to convince her that they should be together and you catch him `selling' her.  It was then that I really saw Grace understood his character.<br /><br />The rest of the cast is just as impressive, they just don't get as much focus.  Scarlett Johansson is great as usual (seriously, I see many awards in her near future) as Alex, Carter's love interest and Dan's pride and joy.  She has so much beautiful chemistry with her co-stars.  You can see the doting daughter in her when she looks into Quaid's eyes versus the curious infatuation she has when she's talking to Grace.  She is truly a knockout actress who has everything going for her; striking beauty and immense talent.  Marg Helgenberger doesn't have much to do, but she does what she does very well, and Selma Blair is effectively detached as Kimberly.  Clark Gregg is a flawless jerk and David Paymer is sympathetic as Morty.  Philip Baker Hall also has a nice cameo (this guy really knows how to command attention).<br /><br />`In Good Company' is blessed to have a very good script baking up its concept and actors.  The script nicely fleshes out the relationships, both Carter and Alex's, Alex's and Dan's as well as Dan's and Carter's; each relationship adding beautiful layers to the films end result.  This film was sorely overlooked come awards time.  It has everything going for it so its snub is surprising to me.  Quaid and Grace (as well as Johansson) turn in beautifully restrained performances that exhibit an honesty rarely seen in films today.  Like I said, I can't think of a single reason to not love this movie; not one.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>Though director Paul Weitz is best known for teen comedy `American Pie' (with his brother uncredited Chris) `In Good Company' proves that his (their) main interest lies in more sophisticated comedy than `Pies' suggest. Actually, `In Good Company' is less likely to entertain you as comedy (though it is); its charms are more like that of satire based on well-acted character-driven drama.<br /><br />In short, it is about Dan Foreman (Dennis Quaid) 51 years-old working for a sports magazine for more than 20 years. After his company has been taken over by one mysterious "Teddy K" (uncredited Malcom McDowell), Dan is demoted from the job. His new boss is Carter Duryea (Topher Grace), hotshot manager who is half his age.<br /><br />In the corporate world this is nothing special, but what is special about the relation between them is that Carter falls in love with a nice college student Alex (Scarlett Johansson), who happens to be Dan's daughter. Interestingly, in spite of the demotion, Dan finds Carter likable and honest in his own way. But their unlikely and uneasy friendship is tested when Dan comes to know Carter is darting with his daughter.<br /><br />`In Good Company' is supposed to be about the corporate world where sheer nonsense can pass for wisdom, and quasi-religious faith often covers up the unreasonableness of business, but the satire of the film is not fully explored. There is nothing unique or original about what Paul Weitz says about the corporate world, and the office workers (including David Paymer) always look like caricatures, only found in the soundstage of Hollywood. Though the central three characters are interesting, the film is not totally clich&eacute;-free. The bored wife of Carter (Selma Blair, wasted) is a very thankless role, virtually pointless, and so is Philip Baker Hall, whose role is too weak to conclude the film with a satisfactory resonance at the end of the story. Even the role of Marg Helgenberger as Dan's wife lacks substantial weight, appearing intermittently to show you the image of perfect family.<br /><br />[GOOD ACTING FROM] However, the three principal actors -- Quaid, Grace, and Johansson - are so good that you almost forget these flaws of the film. Actually, for whatever reasons the film is praised so far, they cannot be without their good acting. There is considerable chemistry between Topher Grace and Dennis Quaid/Scarlett Johansson (though her role is smaller than the others), and thanks to them the characters are all believable.<br /><br />The best way to describe `In Good Company' is, to me, "a surprising good off-beat comedy." The characters sometimes look paper-thin, and there is no denying that Malcom McDowell as Teddy K is a very strange decision, but for all its lack of edge, `In Good Company' has sophisticated taste and humor to amuse us.</p></br><a href="../users/A13DQTXG02HZC1.html">A13DQTXG02HZC1</a><br/><p>This is a personal movie that's produced, written, and directed by Weitz who also got himself involved in "About A Boy" and "American Pie".  Referring to the extra features, some parts of Dennis Quaid's character was based on his own deceased father and he mentioned it that at times, it's hard not be emotional about scenes that he needed to edit out to prevent it to be running close to three hours long.  This is a movie that questions about the ethics of corporate raiding in modern American society where many ordinary people's lives are destroyed.  The closure of ENRON made this movie even more pertinent.  The new generation that embraces this new idea of getting successful in a very short period of time comes in the form of Topher Grace (from The 70's Show) whilst Dennis Quaid's character is the last remaining middle manager who is facing the threat of being made redundant to reduce costs.  Both of them have different values and undoubtedly, coming into conflicts.  Situation worsened when Topher got himself involved with Quaid's daughter, the illuminating Scarlett Johanssen.  Once again, she shows her versatility in portraying the daddy's girl and also, a girl that's transforming into a matured lady that gets to choose what she needs and wants to do in life.  Somehow, all comes out right in the end.  This movie reflects life as it is.  There are unexpected bumps and surprises along the way, but they seem to sort themselves out.  The movie ends in an open-ended manner but in a positive tone, suggesting of a future that's filled with hope.  A light-hearted movie that is honest and down to earth.  It's surprisingly good, akin to a chill creme brulee on a hot summer day.  Commendable watching.  Behind the scenes and commentaries shall give audience an insightful knowledge about the movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>Written and directed by Paul Weitz, "In Good Company" is a mild little social comedy about a 51-year-old ad executive who suddenly finds himself working for a hotshot 26-year-old neophyte who knows next to nothing about the advertising business.  To add insult to injury, Dan, the exec, is shocked to discover that Carter, the boss, has fallen in love with his beloved college-aged daughter, fetchingly played by Scarlett Johansson.<br /><br />"In Good Company" has a few pertinent things to say about how the callous corporate world, concerned primarily with profits and the bottom-line, often mistreats its workers, but the film suffers from heavy-handed plot mechanics, facile ironies, and so many musical montage sequences that the film begins to resemble a cut-rate version of "The Graduate" at times. (David Byrne and Peter Gabriel have provided the Simon and Garfunkel-ish score).<br /><br />Still, there are a number of positive elements to be found in the film.  Dennis Quaid brings a quiet dignity to the role of a middle-aged man who is slowly but surely being put out to pasture to make way for a generation that values youth, energy and loyalty to the CEO above all else.  As the 20-something boss, Topher Grace, in many ways, has the more challenging part, making Carter into a sympathetic figure where other actors might have played him as a hard-nosed villain.  Weitz is careful to show that Carter is really a decent kind of fellow under all the bluster and ambition - deferential, insecure, and eager to find some meaning in life beyond career and work.<br /><br />The performances and a few genuinely insightful, touching moments help to make up for the shaky plotting and the fact that the humor is so low-keyed that it is practically nonexistent.  The movie also earns points for its somewhat unconventional ending.  "In Good Company" doesn't amount to much when all is said and done, but it has enough modest virtues to make it worth watching after a tough day at the office.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IOJE0W1NXOSE.html">A1IOJE0W1NXOSE</a><br/><p>Dennis Quaid plays an ad executive who is demoted in his job just as his daughter begins attending an expensive college and his wife discovers that she is pregnant.  His position is taken over by a young man about half his age, played by Topher Grace.  At first the men clash, but eventually they see that they have something to learn from each other.  This is billed as a comedy, but it has some touching moments of interaction between Quaid and his daughter, and the two men.  This movie is definitely a cut above the usual Hollywood stuff and is well worth viewing.</p></br><a href="../users/A3W1JJGJHRPH4Y.html">A3W1JJGJHRPH4Y</a><br/><p>The movie works. All the actors turn in very good performances. Quaid and Grace are perfectly cast and the relationship works. Quaid lends the right comfortableness in his own skin that's right for the role.<br /><br />The movie develops its minor characters even in its funniest scenes. The movie does not waste scenes. The movie develops its story very efficiently. The movie is compact and entertaining.<br /><br />My biggest problem with the movie is a small one. I've been through downsizing. I survived multiple lay offs and been a victim of having a boss complaining about me being overpaid before he "let me go." The movie does a great job with the corporate culture, but the ending is too upbeat and too pat. It could have been better. However, the movie's ending is not totally bad, it has its moments. The movie is definitely worth renting, if not buying.</p></br><a href="../users/A1N0LCPR7O7OLL.html">A1N0LCPR7O7OLL</a><br/><p>Not three stars...Three and a half out of five.<br /><br />The Weitz brothers starred in one of my favorite indie flicks "Chuck and Buck" and in that movie they delivered outstanding performances.  But the films they have directed I haven't liked one bit.  This is the first film that they have directed that I really think is worth seeing.  Its only fatal flaw in my mind is Scarlett Johansson.  She is an incredibly overrated actress in my humble opinion and she really sinks the pic.  Had a better actress been cast in her role I think the film would have worked so much better.  Its sad too because Dennis Quaid gives an admirable performance, truly brilliant at times as does Topher Grace who seems to get better and better with every film I see him in.  Marg Helgenberger from CSI is also quite good in this film.  David Paymer is great as well as Frankie Faison in their respective supporting roles.  The story is quite interesting as well...I just thought that Johannson really hurt the film in a crucial role.  SPOILER AHEAD There is an important scene in the film towards the end in a restaraunt where Quaid discovers that Johansson his daughter has been sleeping with his boss played by Grace and the scene winds up not really carrying of the dramatic weight it could have because of her lack of range and emotionaly sincerity.  Quaid is giving his all in the scene and acting wise she's just whatever about the whole thing.  An unfortunate let down that kept me from really loving the film.  But that said its worth seeing just for the story, Dennis Quaid and his fascinating interactions with Topher Grace who is completely on his game throughout.  Why did they have to cast Johansson in that role though?  Big mistake.</p></br><a href="../users/A31D8QKJXU93BT.html">A31D8QKJXU93BT</a><br/><p>How do actors age gracefully? Watch Dennis Quaid in his recent performances, especially here opposite Topher Grace. The former leading man is now a handsome character actor, and a very good one. He's old enough to be Grace's father; indeed, that's the gimmick of this ungimmicky film, which is also very good. In a corporate takeover, Grace becomes his boss and falls for his daughter. Grace is endearing as a clueless ladder-climbing lad, but the older actor is indelible as the resilient dad. Quaid's new career in films has Academy Award written all over it.<br /><br />There is much to admire in this unblinking look at corporate survival. As a sort of executive suite swami, who settles everyone's hash at the end, Malcolm McDowell (another leading man who has aged well) relishes his incisive cameo. However, this is not what the movie is about. It's really interested in how people relate to one another, in the cliche of office jargon, "up close and personal." Not another corporate satire? Not another hug everybody movie? Sometimes the old formulas are transformed when directors know how to refresh them.<br /><br />Writer-director Paul Weitz, his editor and cinematographer, know how. The easy-flowing scenes between the father and his daughter (a reserved Scarlett Johannson), his pregnant wife, his new young boss and his office colleagues seem unforced and unrehearsed, as though they were just now happening. The ending, as the characters try to reorder their lives, is not a routine one, but it feels right. In fact, everything about "In Good Company" feels right. The movie may not win Quaid an Oscar (it's not showy enough) but he's clearly on the fast track for one.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZE73RFY0GD3K.html">A2ZE73RFY0GD3K</a><br/><p>Once again, Hollywood advertising attempted to lure masses of viewers to theaters by billing a film as an uproarious, chick-flick romantic comedy -- when actually it was a mildly amusing melodrama.  Those expectations resulted in the somewhat bland reviews we see below, which are reactions not to the film, but what we believed we'd be seeing.<br /><br />The story is actually fairly reasonable, a young corporate firecracker being put in charge of a department containing much older employees.  His rhetoric in front of his staff ("synergy!" and so forth) accurately reflected the babbling nonsense most of these corporate-manager types spew... and that theme was re-emphasized, when big-wig Malcolm McDowell appeared at the end, and delivered a typical executive's meaningless buzzword monologue.<br /><br />The characters' reactions to the developments seemed accurate, appropriately funny or not funny according to the situations.  Another reason for viewer blandness is the movie's ending -- it did not yield the formula chick-flick wrap-up... it actually ended reasonably realistically.  This film is good to see once; it's certainly not one you will cherish for your DVD library.</p></br><a href="../users/A152C8GYY25HAH.html">A152C8GYY25HAH</a><br/><p>"In Good Company" is a lovely movie - part romance, part drama, part satire. It strays occasionally into the obvious, but, overall, it's enormously entertaining. While the satire and drama elements are marred by pat endings, the romance part is given a blissfully hopeful, rather than a happy, ending.<br /><br />Dan [Dennis Quaid] is a high powered advertising executive at a big sports magazine. At age 52, he's at the top of his game. Out of nowhere, his company is bought by a media conglomerate headed by a billionaire megalomaniac. To Dan's horror, his new boss is a 26-year old kid named Carter [Topher Grace]. In typical early 21st Century fashion, Carter has arrived through sheer ambition and charm. He has zero experience in advertising. Carter does, however, have some experience in romance. He meets and falls deeply in love with Alex [Scarlett Johansson]. As fate would have it. Alex is Dan's daughter.<br /><br />The acting here is superior. Quaid was nominated for a Best Actor Oscar. Johansson is one of the best young actresses working today. The revelation is Grace, prior to this best known for his role in a hit sitcom. Here he creates one of the more memorable movie characters in recent movies.</p></br><a href="../users/AMIGVTZZIWS6I.html">AMIGVTZZIWS6I</a><br/><p>I put this movie in not expecting it to be much and came away feeling I'd seen a great little movie with a lot of emotion and humor packed in.  This film covers several different plot points: the importance of money and status versus love and family; the importance of employer/employee/customer versus corporate synergy; the importance of living for the little things in life.  I especially liked Dennis Quaid.  Quaid doesn't always get the chance to show he can actually act and this film really allowed him to shine.  A major suprise in this film was Topher Grace -- he actually can act without being the fool like he is "That 70s Show." Now that Grace has left that show, "In Good Company" may prove to be a great stepping stone.</p></br><a href="../users/A3F3B6HY9RJI04.html">A3F3B6HY9RJI04</a><br/><p>I like a good drama with some comedy and that seems quite true to life and comes with excellent acting.  This movie nails that expectation right on the head.<br /><br />This is the story of Dave Foreman (Dennis Quaid) who is the manager of the sales team at the number one sports magazine in the nation.  When the magazine gets sold, David is replaced by a young hot-shot who is half his age named Carter Duryea (Topher Grace).  But wait, there is more!!!<br /><br />But I would recommend catching movie and following the story on your own.  All I can promise is that the story is fantastic and totally keeps you involved.<br /><br />The best part of this movie is the acting.  Every character is done perfectly.  I could not expect a better performance by anybody in this movie.  I have only known Topher Grace from the few episodes I've seen of "That 70's Show".  I was totally impressed and could not believe that it was him I was watching.  You see his highs (like finding out he is being courted or picking out his brand new car) and his lows (as he gets divorced, gets dumped, gets punched in the face, has to fire people twice his age, and wrecks said sports car).  I expect great things to come from him in the future.<br /><br />Dennis Quaid is fantastic as always. He also carried a wide emotional range as he faces being replaced by a young kid, finding out his wife is pregnant, dealing with issues with his daughters, and having to fire two of his friends.<br /><br />Also what makes this movie great is that it doesn't have a completely happy ending.  You see the potential in the future of everybody's lives involved, but that is left to your imagination.  And that makes this movie, to me, real.  Life is like that.  Heck, who does live happily ever after with no more problems in life?  My wife was a bit disappointed by the ending, I loved it!<br /><br />If you like movies described as I did in the first paragraph, check this movie out.  I don't think you'll be disappointed.</p></br></body></html>

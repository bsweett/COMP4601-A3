Let's look at some aspects.<p>Acting: no really worth mentioning, except maybe Nick Nolte.<br />SFXs: The Hulk is of course a fantastic piece of special effects. It's hard to believe it's entirely CGI.<br />Dialogue: Even Star Wars is better<br />Believability: Jumping for miles? going into space? no seriously, the old hulk was in some strange way believable.<p>Not a good movie, think I'm gonna watch Lee's 'Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon' again. That movie still blows me away. The Hulk certainly did not.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZO30Z16MQ7Y7.html">A1ZO30Z16MQ7Y7</a><br/><p>There are a lot of things to like and a lot of things to hate so I put them in two different categories.<p>Good: The special effects are okay but of course, they don't make up for dumping Lou Ferrigno. The casting was good even if the TV series casting was better. Some good old memories are brought back when some guy comes out of no where and beat up Bruce Banner. Bad: Ending and Dog scene was bad (why was the Hulk fighting a poodle?). Breaking up the screen with several views was annoying<p>Overall this movie makes up for bad Cartoons, but the TV series is much better.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TZKXU6Q0EDNP.html">A2TZKXU6Q0EDNP</a><br/><p>Ok, who's left out from Marvel comics that hasnt been filmed yet?<br />Well, of all the lines of "super heroes" that have paraded through the screens the last decade this has got to be the most entertaining adapration I've seen even if it's riddled with flaws from beginning to end.<br />  Explanation needed here, and I'll start out with the flaws:<br />The movie commences in an admittingly very slow pace because those not familiar with the Hulk story need to be introduced to it. Fair enough and it's not that dramatic really as this actually results in the whole film being more compact. It could have been much more pacey and faster when it comes to the first 45 minutes or so.<br />  Then as the Hulk finally makes his appearance (and whoa that is some appearance!) other needless mistakes appear as well such as the Hulk being able to make tremendous mile-long leaps as he literraly bounces off mountain tops. The filming however, is so good that even that doesn't annoy as much as it could have.<br />  Being that the Hulk is portrayed as having such abilities he should be practically untrappable but yet he gets trapped on several occasions all for the need to set up mammoth fight sequences and showdowns.<br />  Then you have the army general responsible for containing da Hulk in his army bases who seems unable to learn any lesson even that involves whole neighborhoods being destroyed or half his personell and equipment being squashed as he gets constantly convinced by his daughter (and simoultaneously Hulk's amore) to "give him one more chance". One more chance at what exactly? Well, the Greenman is beyond such niceties as every time he's loose the earth trembles but no, the general is there again always prepared to go soft and let this indestructible creature wreak havoc extraordinaire.<br /><br />  But then the positives are actually overwhlemingly dominating the negative aspects of the film.<br />  First of all Lee's (the director) excellent editing with multiple frames and freeze frames that pay hommage to the authentic design by the comic makers.<br />  Then of course the action scenes themselves. Once the film kicks in and the Hulk appears you wish it'd go on for another 3 hours. We're talking about some of the most entertaining, funny, and at the same time 100% convincing action scenes seen on celluloid. Now, that is bizzare in itself because it envolves scenes where the Hulk dismantles tanks and throws them 100s of meters away, chews at missiles and spits them back, or holds  onto fighter jets to be almost launched into space, and finally, takes on a squadron of fighter hellicopters and blasts them as if they were annoying lil mosquitoes. Huh? Yes, all this does actually seem incredibly believable and filmed in such frenetic pace (in pure contrast with the film's beggining) that it guarantees some serious jaw-dropping.<br /><br />  But there's actually more than just the mindless brute force of the Hulkman that makes this film work. Subtle but hardly unnoticeable political touches are there as well as the Hulk's father (Nick Nolte) tries to instill in him some political conscience with anarchistic overviews. "What about those in uniform and the crimes they've done??" he screams at Hulk in one sequence. "What about the poison of religions" he continues and urges his green creation to keep on the struggle. Nolte incidentally is a very good cast here as he's a glove-fit for this role.<br />  The only character that comes across as being particularly poor is the army general but then again why would anyone with a functioning brain mind that? It is after all an army general and as any person dedicated to destruction and catastrophic "secrets" isn't ferociously smart to begin with the general's IQ makes actually sense. Neither is the Hulk for that matter but this is a different proposition.<br />  He comes across, as, yes, a mindless organic machine set on totally pulverising anything that angers him/it but you can always feel an "agenda" beneath his green skin that you can identify with.<br />  Tremendous action film and adaptation, incredible filming, great camera work, stunning effects are the specialty of the day here.<br />  Makes the Spidermen and Batmen of this world look like kindergarten boys with issues and sets new standards.<br />  The laugh factor in the film is incidentally extremely high even though there aren't more than 1-2 actual funny lines to be heard. That's primarily due to the fact that the Hulk's anger reaches at time hilarious peaks and you cant help it but laugh. Once you see the sequence with the tanks you'll know exactly what I mean...<br />  By all means, DO see this.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>Maybe I should have known better than to have high expectations I did for The Hulk, but considering the cast involved and who's sitting in the director's chair perhaps my expectations were justified.  But despite all the hype and the big names, this big screen mega budget adaptation of The Hulk is ultimately disappointing.  Eric Bana, who gave us such memorable lead characterizations in Chopper and Black Hawk Down, just seems a bit out of place as Bruce Banner: the man struggling to supress the beast within.  Jennifer Connelly, who gets more and more beautiful the older she gets, is a fine choice as Betty Ross, while Sam Elliot (who plays her father General Ross) overacts quite a bit and seems a bit out of place as well.  Nick Nolte however, gives the best performance in the film as Bruce's psychotic father.  Director Ang Lee's use of using split frame shots (like in comic books to fully illustrate scenes) is a nice idea, but it does get quite annoying.  Everyone seems to automatically nitpick the special effects and the CGI creation of the Hulk, but the big green machine himself is superbly animated and designed; and in a few shots actually looks real.  The action scenes themselves are superbly put together as well throughout the first three quarters of the film; up until the climax and finale of the film where the movie turns into an incoherent cartoon.  For me, that is where the film really fell apart, with the final fight scene and climax plus predictable ending which naturally sets the stage for the Hulk to smash and bash his way towards a sequel.  All in all, The Hulk is an ultimately disappointing mega budget miss that aimed high, but fell well below radar.  Go watch X2: X-Men United again.</p></br><a href="../users/A2DAHERP7HYJGO.html">A2DAHERP7HYJGO</a><br/><p>Yes, the Incredible Hulk, that monstrous, green apparition that became the rage in comics in the early sixties and television icon in the seventies is back on screen. And although a normal man still grows in size enough to split his shoes and shirt, his pants remain made of some elasticized material that never breaks. Those of us on the heavier side are still seeking out this material as I write.<br /><br />HULK made its way to the big screen in the biggest way possible. It was being touted as the next best thing since sliced bread before it even arrived. Directed by Ang Lee who was coming off of his art house AND theatrical hit CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON, many were making predictions that this film would combine the pop culture found in comics with the artistic integrity found in this director. Face it, it was a no win situation for critics everywhere.<br /><br />But for audiences it was different. The hype surrounding the movie was as enormous as the Hulk himself. Anyone who blindly accepted that this movie would be the best movie ever made had no choice but to walk away disappointed. But those who went in looking for nothing more than a good movie, a movie that would capture the essence and imagination found in the pages of those brightly inked comics of the past were delighted.<br /><br />Story time. The story begins in the past when David Banner is researching DNA and trying his best to make a human that will renew its own body cells when harmed or injured. When the military doesn't allow him to try this on humans instead of animals, he infects himself. Not long after, he and his wife have a child. Recognizing that his son's DNA contains cells that were affected, he begins to search for a solution to change him back. Stopped by the military when they discover what he has been up to, he blows up the base and heads home. This portion of the film takes up the first minutes and is told in quick fashion, ending with David's son Bruce not recalling all that happened and waking from this nightmare.<br /><br />Moving forward, Bruce (Eric Bana) has grown into a young scientist himself, researching much of the same ideas his birth father had. At his side in this research is Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly), his now ex-girlfriend. All of their attempts to replicate the adaptive powers of amphibians, their ability to renew cells when damaged, have ended in short term success and long term failure. The frogs blow up. An accident in the lab exposes Bruce to the same nanomites and gamma radiation the frogs were hit with. But instead of blowing up, he changes. The experiment works on him, recharging his body.<br /><br />The down side is revealed that night when Bruce's nightmares awake an anger, a rage, within. That rage changes him as well. The passive Bruce Banner finds his body physically altering until he becomes the primal essence of man, of himself. He turns into the overpowering Hulk.<br /><br />Green skinned, standing well over 9 feet tall, body formed of hyper increased muscles, Hulk leaves the hospital bed Banner was sleeping in. And as he makes his way into the world, everyone is well aware that the military will take notice and track him down.<br /><br />Part of what change Bruce while in that bed was a visit by the night janitor. It turns out that he is very familiar with Bruce since he is in fact his father David (Nick Nolte). Revealing himself and portions of what happened in Bruce's past (since Bruce was raised by adoptive parents and never told the truth), he is the catalyst that invokes the rage inside if Bruce.<br /><br />A multiple cat and mouse game follows with Betty trying to help Bruce, her ex-beau Talbot (Josh Lucas) trying to steal the program they were working on and eliminate Bruce as a competitor for Betty's affections. Betty's father, General Ross (Sam Elliott) tries to save his daughter from a man he fears (knowing all about Bruce's past) and sets out to gather the results of this experiment for military purposes at the same time. Bruce's father David attempts to harness the power and change from Bruce by using DNA samples found in hair left behind and applying them to his dogs and later on to himself. And through it all, Bruce is left to sort out each event on his own, with no help from anyone save Betty who realizes just how much he truly means to her.<br /><br />This story could be called a simple retelling of Beauty and the Beast. But it goes beyond that. It talks about the rage that we all keep in check, never saying the things that we would love to say from complaining about low wages to flipping off the bad driver on the highway. It talks about the inner beauty of a person overcoming the surface that is visible. And it talks about the abuse of power, of scientist willing to risk their souls because perhaps they don't believe in them anymore. But most of all, this movie brings alive the pages that we once read so long ago and makes them real.<br /><br />The standout in this movie, the make or break necessary to pull it off, is of course the visualization of the Hulk himself. Lee decided not to follow in the footsteps of the television series and instead opt for complete CGI (computer generated image). And the folks behind the special effects here have made the Hulk seem more real than any CGI images we have seen before. The rampaging Hulk would have been the easiest thing to do, with quick cuts and motion galore. But the passive Hulk, the one with facial expressions and emotion, that is where they truly shine. And the fact that he actually DOES resemble Bana is remarkable.<br /><br />No easy sell as was SPIDER-MAN, this movie is entertaining throughout. Don't go in looking for the television series. You won't find it. Instead, go in looking for a return to the original story. Go in looking for a visual feast in special effects. Go in without unreasonable expectations. If you do so, you will find that this movie delivers on all counts.<br /><br />For die hard fans, the DVD comes with a glut of extras, everything from a look at how the Hulk was made on film to interpretations of various scenes if they were drawn by some of the top artists working in comics today. All of the extras make this DVD one worth owning.</p></br><a href="../users/A2G8IR6ENZSQHF.html">A2G8IR6ENZSQHF</a><br/><p>I had mixed expectations when I rented &quot;The Hulk&quot;.  It had been Marvel Comics' first post-&quot;X-Men&quot; film that flopped at the box office, and many critics had said it was overlong and far too slow.  And so I was very impressed with how much I enjoyed &quot;The Hulk&quot;.<p>I have to assume that when everyone said the film was too slow, they were referring to its first 45 minutes.  It is true that viewing the first part takes a little patience, especially getting used to Ang Lee's sometimes bizarre camera tricks.  However, these beginning scenes are important buildup, and- unlike for &quot;Matrix Reloaded&quot;- I never thought that I was being had with unecessary scenes that were there only to drag out the running time.  &quot;The Hulk&quot; has much higher goals in mind than other comic book films out there, so all of these beginning scenes of character development and talking actually increase the overall quality of the film.  It is true that it's a while before we finally get to see the Hulk, but in a way keeping him off the screen for that long makes his inevitable appearance that much more dramatic and thrilling.<p>Once the action does kick into gear, it hardly ever lets up.  Contrary to what other reviewers have said, the CGI-ed Hulk is quite impressive looking, and the scene where he throws the army tanks and planes around like toys is one of the most memorable I've seen this year.<p>Almost all of the major characters are complex and conflicted, so we feel for them and care what happens to them.  For example, two characters who are technically villains- General Ross and David Banner- both show moments of sympathy.  The guy who plays Bruce Banner (Eric Bana) is adequate, though this wasn't an Oscar performance.  Jennifer Connelly is good as his girlfriend, who is also the only person that can calm the Hulk down.  I thought that Nick Nolte gave the most interesting performace- David Banner is completely insane, both sympathetic and dispicable.<p>If the film does have a weak spot, it's the ending.  I'm still trying to figure out exactly what happened in the final battle between Bruce and David Banner.  I understand the outcome, but I'm not sure how or why.  Director Ang Lee probably could have made this whole scene clearer.  Also, the movie is a little on the long side, though as I said earlier not a whole lot obviously needed to be cut.<p>So overall, I found this to be an enjoyable and interesting movie, up there with &quot;X2&quot; and &quot;Spider-Man&quot; as one of the best comic book adaptations of the current decade.  In some ways, it was even superior to those films.  For those of you out there that haven't seen it, I would recommend it.  For those who don't like it, I won't try to change your mind, but there's no way that &quot;The Hulk&quot; was a complete disaster.  I for one will be sad that it did so poorly at the box office, because now there won't be a sequel.</p></br><a href="../users/A25AXWGBGJ5KBS.html">A25AXWGBGJ5KBS</a><br/><p>Boy did THIS film get the short end of the stick by critics.<br />This is a great film. It's NOT really a comic book film, although the delightful editing techniques certainly refer to the source material's heritage.<br />This is a horror movie more than anything else. It's like Frankenstein meets Dr. Jekyll &amp; Mr. Hyde, albeit with a dollop of serious familial psychodrama mixed in for some texture.<br />It's always visually and aurally interesting, and the special effects are astonishing.  (Reference made only for comic geeks)<br />The Hulk character looks terrific, I thought. While it's not the character that Gollum was, remember, he has no lines. He roars and tosses tanks like a Olympian hammer throw athlete. There are plenty of glorious action scenes for those of you who care, yet there most definitely is a dense and detailed plot to back it up. After all, this IS Ang Lee we're talking about.<br />I loved the sly references to classic horror films, like King Kong and Frankenstein.<br />The cast is uniformly impressive; again, this IS Ang Lee. Bana, Connelly, Elliott, Nolte...yeah sure sometime they go a little &quot;over the top&quot;, but it all services the story.<br />The visual &quot;look&quot; to the film is highly original as well. Maybe not &quot;original&quot; in that dictionary sense...it borrows a lot from comic book story-telling techniques...but I don't think you will have seen a film that LOOKS like this one does. Inventive color schemes, camera angles, music cue choices and the marvelous editing design all combine most effectively.<br />I found myself more impressed with the film after I viewed the supplementary material. I found I wanted to tell people about this film...to give it a chance. Non-&quot;comic&quot; people may actually get more out of the film than we comic fans, but only the latter group will smile when he whips that tank over his head.<br />That looked perfect, didn't it?</p></br><a href="../users/A1NLZVP501JM5Z.html">A1NLZVP501JM5Z</a><br/><p>After reading some of the reviews for the Hulk I thought it was going to be horrible.  I was surprised to find out it wasn't that bad.  Yes, there are boring parts and yes, there is some bad acting and yes, the Hulk does resemble a certain green ogre, but after watching the Hulk take down some tanks and helicopters and kicking Nick Nolte's [...] I realized this movie, was not that bad.</p></br><a href="../users/A1A69DJ2KPU4CH.html">A1A69DJ2KPU4CH</a><br/><p>Since this movie is seven years old and already has plenty of reviews written, meaning it's doubtful this one will ever be seen, I'm going to keep it short. This movie was simply too smart for many of today's movie going audience. If stuff isn't blowing up every five minutes they lose interest, fast. It is no wonder to me the new Hulk was so well received compared to this one, because stuff was blowing up all the time.<br /><br />Since I don't have a short attention span and I appreciate stuff like character development, a well written script, and an emotional core to my movies, this version of the Hulk delivered in spades. The effects were also fantastic, and I thought the CGI was very convincing, better than the new Hulk with it's synthetic looking CGI, which is impressive considering the new version had six years of technology advances over this version and in my opinion had nothing to show for it. Lastly, as someone who has emotional scars from my own father, and the very troubled upbringing I had with him, this Hulk was a much more emotional experience for me than I am used to in an action/sci fi movie. I applaud what Ang Lee attempted with this version of Hulk, and how he was more interested with using the character as a catalyst for a much fuller, cerebral movie experience. Sadly since much of today's movie audience doesn't want to think during a movie, it was lost on many a viewer. If you value the same things I do in a film however, and you haven't seen this version due to the bad reviews, you owe it to yourself to give it a shot.<br /><br />[ADDITIONAL THOUGHTS]Since posting this review I have read comments regarding the review, both negative and positive. I have removed a bunch of the superfluous stuff from the original review. It was/is not my intention to come off as a pretentious, pompous, blow-hard, thus if the new Hulk works for you, than more power to you! I have to call it like I see it however, and while the new Hulk was a good action movie, that's all it was (for me). Ang Lee's Hulk offered more than that (for me) and I appreciate what he attempted with it. It's easy to create a strict action movie, it's far more difficult to create an action movie that offers a cerebral core to its plot. Movies like Batman Begins, The Dark Knight, the Sam Raimi Spiderman trilogy, and Ang Lee's Hulk all offered deep/dark psychological plot lines, that again, provided for a much fuller movie experience. There is nothing wrong with superhero movies like the X-Men trilogy, the new Hulk, the Iron Man movies  (Iron Man 1 was significantly better than 2 IMO), Thor, the Fantastic Four movies (I did not care for either of the two, I hope FF are rebooted with a far more competent director), or the Avengers, but all they were was action movies, nothing more, nothing less. Again, if that's what you prefer there is nothing wrong with that, but it's apparent from the comments to my original review, lots of movie goers appreciate a bit more to their superhero/action movies.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UL0A8GJB4318.html">A2UL0A8GJB4318</a><br/><p>The &quot;Hulk&quot; is a good movie, often times great.  The first half of the movie is a long, methodical character study of people under immense emotional torture, especially Bruce Banner (a pitch-perfect Eric Bana) and Betty Ross (Jennifer Connely).  It is hinted that they share a dark past filled with absentee fathers and a secret military project that they might now be working on again, 30 years later.  This first half or so is the reason why the &quot;Hulk&quot; was not well recieved among viewers and critics.  People were expecting either another &quot;Spiderman&quot; or another &quot;X-Men&quot; or its sequel, filled with those films'  brimming everyman qualities and light-pacing throughout, or the Hulk of the 70s t.v. show, who aided people when he had and anger spell.  But director Ang Lee opted for a more tragic approach, with plenty of Freudinized angst, along the lines of repressed memories manifesting themselves in dreams.  And while Lee sometimes overdoes it, his decision ultimately makes &quot;Hulk&quot; far more interesting than the t.v. show whose premise wore thin after a few episodes and a little more intriguing than Marvels past comic-book adaptations .  However, action junkies need not fear.  Things kick into high gear in the film's fast-paced and action-packed final act as Banner escapes from a military compound where they were hoping to harvest him for their own purposes.  He then proceeds to tear up the california desert in a wondrously shot sequence that shows off the ILM's incredibly life-like and belivable Hulk creation and the films' unique style of editing that makes the film feel like a comic-book with skillfully juxtaposed images from various camera shots that describe various scenes that occur simaltaneously in the film.<p>It should be said, though, that &quot;Hulk&quot; is not  as artistically accomplished as Director Lee's &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; or perhaps other acclaimed films in his catalog.  &quot;Hulk&quot; at times suffers from uneven pacing, some mind-numbing psycological probing and timid acting.  But overall, &quot;Hulk&quot; stands on its own as a dark, brooding and  spectacular comic-book adaption that had the balls to take the &quot;Hulk&quot; to places no one ever expected something like the &quot;Hulk&quot; to go.  And while having the guts to do something daring is instantly laudable, &quot;Hulk,&quot; even with its flaws, still succeeds surprisingsly well.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HII4U9WQ0XUV.html">A2HII4U9WQ0XUV</a><br/><p>I'll just ask you this: isn't it better to have a trippy, funky, eccentric flick like Ang Lee's "Hulk" than no Hulk movie at all?<br /><br />Look, let's boil Ang Lee's rippingly fun new movie 'Hulk' down to its core components: it's about brilliant nanotechnological research scientist Bruce Banner who one day, while working in his lab, gets 'belted' by Gamma rays. What should have been a fatal exposure combines with certain---erm, genetic irregularities---to create some major anger management problems for Dr. Banner.<br /><br />You see, every time he gets angry---really angry---he turns into a big green man. A big green man with expandable purple stretch pants that assist with his modesty during his transformations from Eric Bana into a completely CGI-generated bright green monster.<br /><br />A big green man that hurls tanks and helicopters about like they were toys. A big green man whose erstwhile captor, General Ross (played competently but shallowly by Sam Elliot), decides to let escape from an underground Area 51-esque base, the better to 'fight him outside.'<br /><br />Umm, OK. The truth is that Ang Lee brings his stellar cinematic sensibilities (from movies like "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" and "Sense and Sensibility") to Marvel's storied Incredible Hulk: like the little nanites that flow through Bruce's body and the gamma rays, the marriage of Lee to the comic book material results in a whole that is greater---and greener---than the sum of its parts.<br /><br />'Hulk' is solidly entertaining, visually gorgeous, and---especially for a summer blockbuster---an unusually experimental film that manages to entertain and startle simultaneously.<br /><br />Those who go to "Hulk" looking for stellar special effects will leave highly satisfied. SEE:<br /><br />*green gamma-ray mushroom clouds!<br /><br />*nasty insane killer giant poodles!<br /><br />*Banner's mad scientist father David, who undergoes some startling transformations of his own (seriously: Nolte doesn't just *chew* scenery in this movie, he absorbs it!)!<br /><br />*the incredible battle sequences between the Hulk and his tormentors---be they the hideous hulk-Dogs or our brave boys in the US Army---the latter pitted against the real "Army of One"!<br /><br />The special effects centerpiece award of "Hulk" goes, of course, to the eponymous hero: the Hulk himself is completely computer generated. Does it work?<br /><br />Actually, the Hulk is one of the superhero pandemic's most sympathetic characters, and displays far more humanity than his alter ego, played with considerable reticence by Eric Bana. The last superhero we saw who was this withdrawn was Michael Keaton's Bruce Wayne.<br /><br />The acting here is all top-notch, and there aren't any uneven performances: Bana doesn't exactly reprise his "Chopper" performance---he's way too restrained---but then again, he's a nice counterpoint to his lab-destroying Green Inner Child. Jennifer Connelly re-affirms her position as Hollywood's most gorgeous underrated actress. Nick Nolte plays his leering, rasping role to the hilt, and ultimately steals the show.<br /><br />There are times where the movie gets a little too awkward and goofy for its own good: I'd still love to know where the Hulk gets his one-size-fits-all purple stretch pants. There's Josh Lucas's death scene, in which they freeze frame the horrified Lucas in front of an explosion---highly goofy, but very comic booky, and it works; I laughed, anyway.<br /><br />The Hulk's surrender scene in downtown San Francisco also makes little sense; after all, if the Big Green Guy is so fond of leaping, why doesn't he just leap out of the way of all those army men and hop over to Oakland?<br /><br />And speaking of that, what was General Ross thinking when he figures that it's a good idea to let the leap-loving Hulk escape the underground base, reasoning that it will be easier to fight the Big Guy on the surface? Time for a court-martial, Soldier.<br /><br />But even though the buildup and exposition of "Hulk" makes the movie run a tad long, the film ultimately comes together, a testament to the solidity of its actors, the seamlessness of its CGI, and the talents of both Ang Lee and Director of Photography Fred Elmes, who worked with Lee on "Ice Storm" and has been a long-time DP for David Lynch (his credits include "Eraserhead", "Wild at Heart", and "Blue Velvet")---so it's no wonder that such lurid, dark emotions can be shot on such a visually brilliant palette.<br /><br />Yes, "Hulk" is a Evil Dad vs. Good Son movie---and like so many other films that used the same device to telling effect (think Star Wars, or even, in a lopsided way, Spider-Man), "Hulk" succeeds at a very primal level.<br /><br />"Hulk", after all, is about secrets repressed under a banal, nondescript surface, about the rage that lurks within all of us. Ang Lee's "Hulk" says that if it isn't easy being Green, at least it looks good. Just don't make him angry---you wouldn't like him when he's angry.<br /><br />JSG</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>Boy what a conundrum!  To like or not to like this film seems to set a precedence with the reviewer as either a bonafide moron or a person who enjoys something that might be a breakthrough in the comic-book to movie industry.  <p>Well, I liked it . . . a lot.  Why?<p>This is a film made for the comic book fan (I loved the original comic books with their great artwork).  Ang Lee (the director) even pulls up images on the screen (occasionally) that are block-like, giving you the feeling that you're watching a type of moving comic book, but with real characters.<p>The cast of characters in this film is impressive, too: Eric Bana, Jennifer Connelly, Nick Nolte and Sam Elliot.  It's just a shame that a bit more time wasn't taken to go over the script and fix a few dialogue problems.  Some of it seems forced, just a patch-work to help the plot move along.  But...<p>This still didn't detract from the overall enjoyment of the film for me.  New ideas were incorporated (something that some 'Hulk Purists' might find offensive), and I found them refreshing.  Let's not forget that the Hulk comic strip never stayed static, either folks.  In this film, nano-technology was introduced.  But it never became over-burdensome with techno-babble.  The action of the film and its characters stayed in the forefront of the film.  <p>The movie follows pretty closely the development of Bruce Banner into the Hulk.  Except here, there's a genetic component along with the nano-machines and Gamma radiation accident.  Ang Lee also incorporated some great family dynamics that come back to bite the audience on the nose.  <p>It was a good film.  I really enjoyed watching it.  I might even watch it again.  Enjoy.<p>A- rating</p></br><a href="../users/A3K8TYU7UOUTR0.html">A3K8TYU7UOUTR0</a><br/><p>This is a much better movie than I feared it might be. I'll keep this brief. When Bruce Banner gets mad, the movie easily fulfils all hopes. So often computer graphics disappoint in that there is no sense of "reality." The action has no weight, and there is no sense of real power. That is not the case here. The special effects folks did an amazing job in conveying the Hulk's sheer size and terrifying strength. When the green giant tangles with the tanks, It really seems like steel is being torn.  And, suffice to say, the &quot;dog fight&quot; scene is literally worth the purchase price (as was Nick Nolte's final raving scene). <p>The Hulk was (and still is) my favorite comic, and I do not feel cheated by this version. But, it must be said, I think Mr. Lee missed something essential in the Hulk myth. What drove the Hulk/Banner character throughout the comic book was an extreme sense of isolation, of being an outsider from the rest of humanity. Bruce Banner was always a man on the outside because of this terrible beast within him, a terrible dark side that could tear loose at any second.  He could never have normal attachments, and he could never lead a normal life. He was just a drifter. Lost. Director Lee went instead with a very modern &quot;dysfunctional family&quot; theme as the source of the Hulk's rage. While it was an interesting take on it, I prefer the more traditional take on the Hulk; i.e. Bruce Banner drifting from town to town with his terrible secret haunting him at every step. This was the aspect that the television series, and original TV movie with Bill Bixby, captured so well. Perhaps we will see more of this in the sequel, as, admittedly, this was kind of an "origin" movie. <p>Still, there is more to admire in this version than curse. I will buy the DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/A82LIVYSX6WZ9.html">A82LIVYSX6WZ9</a><br/><p>last years spider-man didnt really grip me. though x-men 2, daredevil and this one right here did. Eric Bana(Black Hawk Down and Chopper) is great as the green man. Connelley is sexy as always and Nolte is well, he needs a new hairduo is all im saying. but I really liked this movie and I ignored my friends opinions on it as well. great visuals by Ang Lee and also great direction as well. sorta played like a comic book splitting the scenes in half and all and the hulk visuals are spectacular. one more note. They coulda done without those damn mutated dogs, what the (beep) was that all about. Inject Fluffy with the crap and Fluffy turns to Spike, anyway.</p></br><a href="../users/A3TUZOJZM9008Y.html">A3TUZOJZM9008Y</a><br/><p>Ang Lee is a brilliant director. That being said, I don't think Universal should have handed this movie to him. Comic book movies need to remember from whence they came. They need to remember who their core audience is. This movie does neither. It is an excellent movie. It's just not the movie that it should have been.<p>The movie looks great. Eric Bana seems to be sleepwalking through the better part of the film. Jennifer Connelly does her usual great job. Nick Nolte should join Over-Actors Anonymous. The effects are top-notch. And still, this isn't the Hulk that I wanted to see on the big screen.<p>The old CBS series, much of which is now available on DVD, came closer to the tone that should have been here. A man who is tortured by what he's become on a search to find the cure. This movie makes the same mistake that the "Lost in Space" movie made. It all boils down to "Everything will be alright if only my Dad would love me."<p>The franchise that could have been "The Hulk" now gives way to this solo movie. Enjoy it for what it is, or for what it could have been.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>I watched "Hulk" simply because it's a film directed by Ang Lee, whose previous works include "Sense and Sensibility" and "Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon."  I thought he was not going to do anything wrong.  And I am sorry, but I was terribly mistaken.  Mr. Lee says here and there in the interviews to the effect that he saw something like Greek tragedy in "Hulk."  Excuse me, but Hulk is NOT a human being; it's a cultural icon.  You cannot change it like that.<p>The story is long, too long, showing how Bruce Banner aka Hulk finds his power and secret in the past, after being exposed to the deadly gamma radiation.  The first unwise decision is, the film goes all the way back to the time of his father (hence, Greek tragedy) David Banner, who must have done something to his son.  And his son comes to realize his tragic history ... wait, but the film is supposed to be about "Hulk," that "Incredible" Hulk?  So why take so much time to see HIM?<p>Anyway, Bruce Banner knows his physical change, so the military people (again) take advantage of his power, led by unashamedly banal characters such as Josh Lucas's selfish tycoon Talbot taking over the institute, where Bruce Banner is working with his love Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly).  Of course, after being bullyed, Bruce gets very angry ... finally.  It looks like years to reach there.<p>The rest of the story involves Hulk's fight against the army and the father, the latter played by hammy Nick Nolte.  The story is too predictable, even considering its comic book origin, and to make matters worse, the CGIs used to express the movements of Hulk need much improvement.  Actually, some of them are fantastic, when Hulk attacks the tanks and tears them apart.  But some of them are just awful, showing Hulk like a big green rubber ball bouncing up and down.  If that is intentional, I call it a misguided idea.<p>Australian Eric Bana does a fine work as Bruce Banner, convincing as a scientist tormented by his childhood memory, but to be frank, the rest of the cast is huge disappointment.  Ms. Connelly does nothing but worrying and crying, and that worrying is not particularly good.  Worse is her father Sam Elliott, whose "General" is nothing but a cardboard character.  Maybe that's also intended so.  But as to Nick Nolte ... well, his overacting just reminded me of the time when he was really cool.<p>In short, Ang Lee thinks too much.  Sorry to say this, but looking at the endless multi-screen shots that are made to resemble the pictures of the comic book, I have to say so.  Do we need that labored job that much?  Why cost so much pain there?  And misguided ideas like an exploding frog, which may make some of the viewers sick (I was).  Do we need that?  ANd that's when we want Hulk, incredibly angry Hulk?  Imagine this "hulk" was directed by some newcomer with MTV background.  The critics, who are inexplicably kind to this film, would hurl harsh reviews upon it.  And I think it deserves them.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NBOL825B93OM.html">A2NBOL825B93OM</a><br/><p>&#65533;Hulk&#65533; is an average movie, a very average movie in praticaly all aspects. The plot is only adequate, full of cliches, like the american military in search of the perfect soldier, a very thin love-story, very bad people against very good people, etc., and with the final 15 minutes completely crazy and far-fetched. The characters are well-developed, but this characterization is done almost to the point of being a boring feature of the movie. The special effects overall are quite good. But the funny thing is that the special effects concerning the rendering of the green monster itself are below average. It surely is a drawback in a huge production like this, where a great part of the film is based on a series of images created by computer. I really think that this is not the special-effects crew&#65533;s fault, because I thikn what they intended to create isn&#65533;t possible with the technology they have right now. <p>So, &#65533;Hulk&#65533; should deserve 3 stars at the most. But there are two very interesting things that elevate its rating to four stars. The first thing is director Ang Lee. This taiwanese gentleman surely has the sense and sensibility to manipulate all kinds of images the very ways he wants to. In &#65533;Hulk&#65533;, his direction is very fast-paced, the cinematography is excellent (subtle, not obvious, using of the green colour), and he shot bull&#65533;s eye in using DePalma-esque resources like spliting the screen to re-create a comic-book-like atmosphere. Ang Lee is a master when it comes to create the right atmospheres to his movies. He did so in &#65533;Ice storm&#65533;, &#65533;Sense and sensibility&#65533; and, most of all, in &#65533;Crouching tiger, hidden dragon&#65533;. <p>The second thing is Jennifer Connelly. This stunningly beautiful woman is also a very atalented actress, and Ang Lee could get from her always the right face expressions, the right tons of voice, the right smoothness in acting, creating an almost perfect character in Betty Ross. Sometimes the expression of her eyes alone were enough to carry the whole movie on its back. In fact I was very angry (get it?) when she was not on screen. <p>Also worth of mentioning is Nick Nolte&#65533;s crazy David Banner, but surely the best things about &#65533;Hulk&#65533; are Ang Lee and Jennifer Connelly. So, don&#65533;t expect much, and enjoy the right beauties existent in &#65533;Hulk&#65533;. <p>Grade 8.0/10</p></br><a href="../users/A1COW0UIB5HA9J.html">A1COW0UIB5HA9J</a><br/><p>Dr. Bruce Banner (Eric Bana) has been conducting experiments with gamma radioation until one night he tries to save a friend's life in the lab and gets blasted with a dose of radioation.

General Ross (Sam Elliot) and Glen Talbot (Josh Lucas) suspects something is going wrong, Bruce's love interest Betty (Jennifer Connely) must try to help with Banner's problems and that's the same for Banner's long lost father David (Nick Nolte) who enhances himself as well to become an absorbing monster.<br /><br />Quite different Sci-fi thriller based on Marvel's comic hero created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby is directed by Ang Lee. This one maybe a bit slow for some folks and didn't too well with audiences and some critics even critized for not having much Hulk action, Lee wanted to do an artsy take on the beloved Marvel character for i thought this was a very interesting movie. The casting was quite good even to Connelly who is just as sexy as ever, the special effects by ILM is flawed on the Hulk but in the second movie he looked better. Ang Lee did tried to get a major audience but at least he tried, the new Hulk movie was a vast improvement but this is still worth a watch.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray offers a kickass high defination transfer and terrific sound with good extras like audio commentary, deleted scenes, and featurettes plus picture-in-picture click access for interviews and behind the scenes footage as you watch the movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>Once the action kicks in, this is entertaining story and the Blu-Ray transfer here is one of the best I've seen: very, very sharp. That alone made me elevate the rating.<br /><br />I mention the above because, boy, this film got panned by a lot of people when it came out. Much of the criticism was probably warranted, but it wasn't all that bad a film.It had its entertaining segments. For instance, the second scene with "The Hulk" fighting three dogs was very intense.<br /><br />One of the problems was that it took 41 minutes for our hero, "The Hulk," to show up! For a "superhero movie," that's too long for the audience to wait. Don't get me wrong: I don't want one of these brainless nonstop action movies, but this was a tad too much in other direction. It needed just a little more spark to keep the audience involved.<br /><br />It was good  to see they gave Lou Ferrigno a guest shot. That was a nice touch. Lou played the "monster" on the successful TV series.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NZAGMAS7N5ZP.html">A2NZAGMAS7N5ZP</a><br/><p>Come on people it's a huge green dude...What were you expecting? Spidey? Didn't think so. Hulk is that character in comics that was never truly identified to be either a hero or a villain. He is both in my opinion. He is his own enemy, Banner has to fight with his inner self (literally) the struggles between Hulk and Bruce Banner are as plausible as that of Kent and Superman, or Wayne and Batman. The only problem is how the story is adapted.<br /><br />In this first adaptation, which in fact isn't that loyal to the comic book origins; begins the story of tormented scientist Bruce Banner and his search for a new means to heal and cure people in a way never imagined. His attempts fail after he is exposed to gamma rays. This of course unleashes what is already inside of Banner. Now there are many details in the movie that I'm not gona ruin, for that you would have to see the movie. The issue with why people dislike the movie is because it takes almost 45 min of the movie to finally see Hulk.<br /><br />The movie dwells to long in the past of Banner, now I agree origin is good but in a balanced manner. The effects are amazing with out a doubt...But the storyline a times drags to long. Not to mention the final fight scene this is too dark and poorly conceived. Conclusion, rent it before you buy it. Only buy it if you are a fan of Hulk or comics.<br /><br />MY PERSONAL RATING: 3 ? OUT OF 5</p></br><a href="../users/A1435P5AMCPB3X.html">A1435P5AMCPB3X</a><br/><p>I saw this movie in the theaters, and just purchased it on HD prior to buying my copy of Incredible Hulk on Blu Ray.  I wish they had made this one the beginning of the tie in to the Avengers Series, because this movie had better actors, and a better storyline.  This movie has Bruce Banner played by Eric Bana, and Betty played by Jennifer Connelly.  Both are way better at there roles than Ed Norton and Liv Tyler.  The story flows around how 2 true scientist try to keep the power of the Hulk from falling into military hands.  Banner accidently gets the power unlocked in a lab accident protecting a fellow scientist.  The power was given to him by his father David (played by Nick Nolte), who shows back up to create problems for all.  On top of this, Betty's dad "The General" (played by Sam Elliot) is trying to get Banner.<br />The Hulk here I feel is better animated, more like the comic books I grew up on, the screenshots are cool with the multiple box approach, and the casting/acting are way better than "Incredible Hulk" . The chemistry was just better between these actors than the new movie.  Worth buying and watching many times.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KP0IVWU0RQ0A.html">A1KP0IVWU0RQ0A</a><br/><p>OK, i know most origin stories for comic book movies tend to be weak sometimes, but this film takes FOREVER to get us to the Hulk(and lets face it that IS what we want to see)! Once he comes on screen the movies soars and is very good (I loved the series but the cgi hulk is better than a man in green makeup). The cast is good as is the direction but the movie feels limp for long stretches and is really a mixed-bag.</p></br><a href="../users/A2T7TZBOTP68C7.html">A2T7TZBOTP68C7</a><br/><p>. . . Lots of muscles<br /><br />  And skin that's green<br /><br />  You can make him with Play-Dough!!!<br /><br />The Incredible Hulk is an incredible butt-cramper of a movie.  You kind of wish you had him around to work out the kinks in your back from sitting so long.<br /><br />The movie took itself WAY too seriously for a comic-book film.  The special effects Hulk looks amusing rather than scary.  His powers are preposterous.  He leaps and flies through the Grand Canyon like an eagle, even though he weighs about a ton.  He battles the military in the air and sky, under tremendous stress, but never eating a bite of food for fuel.  He splits his shirt, but his purple shorts miraculously contract and expand with him.  It was all I could do not to bust out laughing.<br /><br />Nick Nolte is very good as Bruce Banner's megalomaniac father who wants his son's powers for himself.  He alone makes this movie good for a one-time rental ONLY.</p></br><a href="../users/AYQF4Z1EQDACU.html">AYQF4Z1EQDACU</a><br/><p>Marvel Comics most legendary superhero after Spider-Man.

I don't care if people didn't like it, this one was made for Marvel comic fans, Spider-Man 1&amp;2 was made for everybody. I'm a Marvel Comic fan. Oscar winner Jennifer Connoly stars as Betty Ross, the only person who knows that the Hulk isn't dangerous.

See this Action-Packed rip roaring monster slam, it will have you raging and after you see it you know what it's like be the green one,. Raaaaarh!</p></br><a href="../users/A2BZWG2LTJZGBQ.html">A2BZWG2LTJZGBQ</a><br/><p>The Hulk is a bad movie.  It has all the necessary elements to be good, but instead it goes awry in a number of ways.  The special effects are good, but overused, the cast is effective, but campy.  The story follows the original in a way, but doesn't realize that the material needs to be lighter in nature.  In short, this is a misfire that results from everything being just a little off.<p>David Banner (Nick Nolte) has a son, Bruce whom he injects with a chemical he is working on that is supposed to allow him to fix himself when hurt or regenerate limbs he loses.  Later, he is fired from his job in the military, and sets off a nuclear explosion.  His son is home and survives the blast.  Later he is exposed to a large amount of gamma radiation and develops the ability to turn into the hulk when provoked to great anger.<p>There's much to get upset about.  His ex girlfriend (Jennifer Connoley) still works with him in the lab (he does the same thing his father used to do)  Her father (Sam Elliott) was the man who fired David all those years ago.  Now he wants to use the Hulk as a military weapon.  Throw in Josh Lucas as a two fold jerk.  He not only wants to date Connoley, but he wants to use the DNA of the Hulk to develop his own creature for his company.<p>The CGI version of the Hulk is almost humorously campy.  He leaps all over the place and destroys buildings like they're not even there.  This would not be so bad if it were not so obvious that it is fake.  I will give the creature this.  It looks more like a mutant than the original series, which simply featured Lou Ferrigno with green paint.  The problem comes from the fake look of the action.  Also, director Ang Lee looks at this material all wrong.  Instead of it being a fun, entertaining look at a fantasy hero, this film is sullen and serious.  Nick Nolte's speech at the end is so over the top it's amazing.  Lee's previous &quot;Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon&quot; could have been more serious, but ended up being light and amusing.  This is awful.  Compare it to SpiderMan and you'll see what I mean.<p>Finally, the movie is way too long.  This should have been 100 minutes tops, not 140.  It takes us 45 minutes to meet the Hulk.  Why show us a helicopter flying Bruce to the lab for 3-4 minutes?  I'm serious.  The helicopter just flies along.  Why?  At 100 minutes this would have been tight and watchable.  As it is, you'll barely make it to the finish.  The Hulk could have been really good.  Hopefully the sequel (I'm sure there will be one) will understand the shortcomings of the original and get it right.</p></br><a href="../users/A3L2U581LL17EB.html">A3L2U581LL17EB</a><br/><p>Pirates of the Caribbean was the most disappointing film of summer 2003 because it promised more fun than it actually delivered. The Hulk comes in a close second because its pedigree (from the cast to director Ang Lee) would seemingly indicate we'd get a film that's far superior to the final cut of this horribly overlong clunker.<p>Maybe the Hulk was never suited for big screen material, but it's more likely Ang Lee just mucked up the execution. He clearly wants to inject his films with the deeper meaning, to question and explore the very psyche of the film's protagonist, Bruce Banner (Eric Bana). Truth be told, I'm not partial to this approach, but I could grudgingly accept it if delivered and executed competently. It's not.<p>From the dull performances to the pretentious tone, Hulk consistently does little more than make the viewer every bit as angry as the green beast himself, only because one was foolish enough to actually fork over some hard-earned cash to see the film.<p>Don't get me wrong, I appreciate the fact that Lee wants to put characters over action, an approach that has constantly appealed to me, but there's a catch here; not one single character is likeable and/or sympathetic. Bana is a decent actor, but he radiates zero screen presence or charisma as Banner, I neither felt nor cared for his supposed mental and physical anguish.<p>As his ex-girlfriend, Jennifer Connelly is even less convincing, resorting to little more than shedding tears when the situation goes awry. Connelly is one of those actresses whose marked improvements over the years (she was an awful actress from the mid-80's to early 90's) has impressed me, but this is her worst performance in years. In other supporting roles, Josh Lucas is okay but perfunctorily one-dimensional as the villain, and Sam Elliot does his gruff thing yet again, and it's not nearly as amusing here as it was in We Were Soldiers (where much of it was played for laughs; he's deadly serious here). Nick Nolte is hilariously over-the-top as mad scientist Bruce Banner, it'd be amusing if it wasn't so earnest.<p>The movie as a whole is about anger, that seething, boiling rage lurking under the surface just waiting for the catalyst that'll unleash its ugly face. There is, unfortunately, only so much a film of this sort can do to deal with such a topic, and it doesn't even maximize such potential during the action sequences.<p>The Hulk (the big man himself) is a passable special effect, better than you'd expect, but not as good as you'd hope for, and while the green lug does get in a few pretty cool moments (leaping around the desert, for instance), he's utterly wasted in this movie's few paltry action sequences. There's a general rule of thumb of mine that any superhero action movie should pit our hero against stronger villains (a rule the recent X2 also broke). Not the case here, where most of Hulk's fighting is against the U.S. military. This is without mentioning that the Hulk not only has super strength and super agility, he's also practically invulnerable to harm because of a quick healing factor; a hero who virtually can't die? Bye-bye, suspense.<p>The one scene where the Hulk does fight someone with superior powers to his own is set in the dark, and I could barely make anything out during this battle, which hardly lasts past a minute and is wholly anti-climactic compared to the slightly more engaging Hulk vs. the military confrontation.<p>Danny Elfman's horrible score rounds out the rest of this lackluster picture. It's a rip-off of his own work in Spider-Man, which itself was a rip-off of his superior work in Batman. Lesson to Elfman: a score of this style won't work for every superhero.<p>Ang Lee crafts the film with a &quot;wink-wink&quot;-style camerawork, splicing in lots of comic-book style scene transitions, reminding viewers they are indeed watching an adaptation of a popular comic book. Not only are the transitions themselves annoying, but they're a persistent reminder of how much more fun it would be to actually skim through an issue of the Hulk than to actually watch this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3A48XEYWLWH7T.html">A3A48XEYWLWH7T</a><br/><p>Wednesday, March 31, 2004 / 4 of 5 / An above average comic book to movie translation.  I found Ang Lee's treatment of the Hulk mythos to be interesting and compelling.  While some liberties were taken with the back story and creation of the Hulk, I think it worked out pretty well.  The pure CG Hulk himself doesn't detract but does serve to stand out against humankind and nature.  Banner's dad as the Absorbing Man was a bit of a stretch, couldn't they have waited for a Thor film for that?  Still, the effects for the Absorbing Man were good while he was on film.  Oh Jennifer Connely, where are those fit and full days of the HotSpot and Rocketeer?  You're too thin and look sickly now, it saddens me to have to say.  Overall the cast does a bang-up job especially Sam Elliot as Thunderbolt Ross.  Bruce Banner is adeptly played w/ wide range by Eric Bana.  There are some Crouching Tiger angles and sensibilities sprinkled about if you watch for them.  Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A3V5DUZ5KXPGQA.html">A3V5DUZ5KXPGQA</a><br/><p>While I do think Ang Lee's &quot;HULK&quot; does fall short in a lot of areas, I don't think it deserves most of the criticism it gets.<p>THE CG HULK<br />  Despite their best efforts, this Hulk looks computer generated and fake. Still, it does work when you see the creature close up. Also, people complained that they wanted a real actor to do the Hulk but I take a bit of an exception to that. If you are going to have the comic book Hulk, then NO ACTOR could do that! Not even Lou Ferrigno in his prime could've done the things that the comic book Hulk does and make it look believable! I will give Ang points for having the guts to go the CG route.<p>THE CAST<br />  Eric Bana is an okay Bruce Banner (though the best will always be the late Bill Bixby on the TV series). Jennifer Connelly is great as Betty Ross while Sam Elliot and Nick Nolte are awesome as General Ross and David Banner respectively! <p>THE STORY<br />  Okay but average. Could've been shorten in some spots but go longer in others. Best scene is near the end when David and Bruce square off at the army base. <p>OVERALL VIEW<br />  I think this film could've been better but it gets slammed more than it deserves. It wasn't THAT bad. Also, its a victim of the Spider-Man craze! While I loved Spider-Man, many people have this stigma that every Marvel based film should be like Spider-Man (though the X-Men films doesn't seem to suffer from this stigma). I think that's so bull! Hulk ISN'T MEANT TO BE SPIDER-MAN! They are two totally different characters in totally different worlds and any comparison as far as characters and their worlds is ridiculous! As far as story development and pacing, Spider-Man is a far better story without a doubt but Hulk is meant to be a psychological story so it is going to be slow in some spots (I just feel that they dragged too long in some spots, even for a psychological story). It isn't just about a man who changes into a monster. Its about a man dealing with his inner rage and psychological trama and his search for peace. This theme is in all the versions of the Hulk, including the TV series.<br />  Anyway, see the film and decide for yourself.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZTSOBAPOWT3.html">A1ZTSOBAPOWT3</a><br/><p>Jennifer Connelly is the most beautiful woman ever!

It just isn't, I can't put it any more simply then that.  If that's what you are expecting (or had expected) I can almost guarantee you'd come away disappointed.<p>Ang Lee is an art-house director ('Ice Storm' 'Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon) and that influence very clearly shows here.  'Hulk' is much more a character study of Bruce Banner then it is an action movie.  The Hulk as a comic book character was always, quietly, one of the more complex characters in the Marvel universe, as opposed to the rampaging maniac that most people unfamiliar with the comic seem to think he is.  Lee's choice to explore the former when most people were actually expecting the latter wound up alienating a great deal of the target audience.  <p>That's really a shame too because it's really a terrific movie.  The story and plot were really well thought out.  The changes that were made to the Hulk's origin made a lot of sense.  The performances were all great (Nick Nolte and Sam Elliot really stole the movie).  It's just too bad that so many people were (I feel) misled to expect something that they, ultimately, weren't going to get.</p></br><a href="../users/A28ILXH590CMRJ.html">A28ILXH590CMRJ</a><br/><p>Bruce Banner (Eric Bana) is a man with secrets.  Dealing with extreme repressed memories as the result of a tragedy that resulted in the death of his mother and the arrest of his father, Banner has become so withdrawn that it causes his break-up with fellow scientist Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly).  During the course of researching cell-regeneration, Banner must save a fellow worker from a potentially lethal overdose of gamma radiation.  Now, whenever he's angry, Banner morphs in the raging green powerhouse known only as the Hulk.  <p>After the great success of X-MEN, DAREDEVIL and SPIDER-MAN, it was inevitable that Marvel's Jekyll &amp; Hyde character, the Hulk would get his shot at cinematic glory.  After all, in the 40 years since he first popped out of the comic pages, this rampaging monster had thrilled many a reader as well inspiring a classic TV series.  When director Ang Lee (CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON) was tapped for the project, the expectations were very high indeed.  While the final result is definitely impressive, it is not completely successful.  <p>Part of this stems from the fact that Lee plays the story completely straight, with hardly any traces of the humor that marks previous Marvel adaptations.  While it makes sense with his overall vision, it makes the first 40 minutes of the film a bit of a drag.  Indeed things finally start to pick up when Banner finally makes his big change to the Hulk at that point.  As repressed Banner, Bana definitely nails the character.  However, the character's very nature makes it very hard to sympathize with him.  In contrast, Jennifer Connelly fares better as his concerned girlfriend.  Surprisingly, the most effective performance comes from Sam Elliott's portrayal as General "Thunderbolt" Ross.  While he comes across as a typical hard-nosed soldier, one can sense the conflicted depths of the man.  The CGI created Hulk is also effective in providing the emotion that Bana seemingly lacks.  Nick Nolte turns in a rather bizarre performance as Banner's long-lost father that strangely fits into Lee's directorial vision.<p>Like the other Marvel movies, the action scenes in this flick are top notch.  You only wish there were more of them and less angst in the picture.<p>Overall, HULK is definitely a noble effort by Ang Lee to produce a serious look at the super-hero genre. It might not please everyone, but it is a unique entry in the super-hero film field.  As a result, it is definitely worth your time and my recommendation.</p></br><a href="../users/A2A6NH6DPE0VXR.html">A2A6NH6DPE0VXR</a><br/><p>Although the Hulk isn't your typical comic book movie that you could watch over and over again like Spiderman it's still good. It's slow and  doesn't have as much action as you'd expect. It does have a nice science fiction tone to it though. It reminded me of some of those science fiction movies from the 80's. Sorta like Altered States with William Hurt or even Darkman. It's more like those movies than it is like the old tv show. I mean it has that plot where a scientist transformed from science and his g/f is trying to save him. <p>  When he does transform it gets silly once he starts jumping from mountain to mountain. I don't know if he had a super jumping ability in the tv show or the comic but it's pretty silly. The movie had too many scenes with him just jumping around too. It may of worked for Ang Lee to have people jumping and flying in Crouching Tigar, Hidden Dragon but it doesn't work in the Hulk. Also when a helacopters are chasing him around, it reminded me too much of that bad 1998 Godzilla movie. The Hulk looks too cartoonish too. They should have just colored the WWE's Brock Lesner green lol. <p>  I still liked it though, some of the action was fun such as the Hulk vs super genetic dogs. The performances by Eric Bana "Black Hawke Down", Nick Nolte, Jennifer Connely and Sam Elliot are all strong. I hope that the sequel is more focused and has more action though. Hey X-Men 2 was better than the first one so maybe Hulk 2 will be better as well.</p></br><a href="../users/ALR35EFI69S5R.html">ALR35EFI69S5R</a><br/><p>For any of us brought up with regular overdoses of big, big Lou Ferrigno as the Incredible Hulk on TV, the leap into the computer-created Hulk on the silver screen is a mind-boggling jump indeed. This is a very entertaining movie, and while it may not always make a lot of sense, it brings out the wide-eyed kid in all of us as the far-fetched idea of a secretly genetically-enhanced body of young scientist Bruce Banner get a mighty dollop of gamma-ray contamination, and this sends his biochemistry into serious overdrive. By the time the plot finally winds around to a situation when Bruce gets cornered and suddenly becomes enraged, I found the audience around me cheering for the appearance of the unbelievably big and powerful green monstrosity at last. <p>The movie is very well made technically, although the same cannot be said for the drama of the piece. So as the Hulk begins his involuntary rampages, we are awed by the pyrotechnics and sheer overkill innate in a creature of such stunning size and power. Indeed, he is a radical bodybuilder's dream, with an upper body to die for, a veritable nightmare of deltoids, pecs, lats, and incredible traps, a guy with biceps so big he could squash a Studebaker with them. Bu this is guy isn't a circus clown intent on entertaining the public for pocket change. This is a tortured soul with plenty of attitude. And the authorities accommodate that attitude by compounding his pain with angst and anger. So the rampage goes on.<p>Of course, this is all punctuated with the subplots anyone familiar with the comic book series is aware of, and a few new to the twisting and turning plotline. The love interest and humanizing factor in the Hulk's rage is his dimwitted recollection of Banner's erstwhile intellectual foil and main squeeze wanna-be, the lovely Jennifer Connelly, who must be dumbfounded indeed to go from playing the wife of someone with a brilliant mind in her last Oscar winning performance to now being the plaything of a big, brawny green monstrosity here. But she plays it straight, and gives a good performance in a movie that really is a set piece for the big green guy. <p>Another cast members perform equally as well, and one is impressed by the quality of the cast, which includes people like Sam Elliott, Nick Nolte, and of course, Eric Bana as Bruce Banner, the Hulk's calmer alter-ego. Ther is also a nice cameo by Lou Ferrigno as a Security Chief that provides a nice  tribute to his former incarnation as the big green guy himself. I recommend this movie, which I view as a great continuation of the old classic monster movies of the 1940s and 195os. I think we can all rest assured that the Hulk will return for any number of sequels, and long may he rage against the machine! Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/AL277B4AQCWBG.html">AL277B4AQCWBG</a><br/><p>There are only a few moments when the Hulk actually looks real, but it matters little. Unlike so many comic-book adaptations, Ang Lee's "Hulk" aims for - and brilliantly achieves - another kind of realism: the emotional kind. James Schamus (surely the most under-appreciated champion of quality American films) has penned a superb story which ensures this isn't just another disposable summer film doing the groundwork for a franchise. It's actually ABOUT something: fatherhood, and the legacy we leave our children. Embracing both the Oedipal subtext and the need for thrilling action, Ang Lee, with typical confidence and subtlety, has delivered a film which is both stunningly entertaining and more than a little moving. The trailers hyped the digital effects, but there's so much more here to be enjoyed. Indeed, the trailers gave away absolutely nothing of Act 3 which includes a climactic performance from Nick Nolte which is nothing short of Oscar-worthy. Innovative cinematography and editing are intelligently applied and, as always, Danny Elfman's thrilling score is a perfect match. "Hulk" is a film that can and should be enjoyed again and again - it's subtle, intelligent and above all interesting. What a refreshing change for Hollywood. Teen boys disappointed their expectations weren't met should take a second look at this in twenty years' time - when they're fathers.</p></br><a href="../users/A2JDYUSI2RILEB.html">A2JDYUSI2RILEB</a><br/><p>It's hard to imagine that there has been or ever will be a super-hero movie that divides as many viewers as Ang Lee's ambitious 2003 filming of THE HULK.<br /><br />From the pre-release buzz about how Lee had taken a revisionist tact with the origin of the Stan Lee-Jack Kirby Marvel comic book hero, to the first, fleeting -- and unfinished -- glimpses of the all-CGI green one during the Super Bowl, the comics-to- movie community had been eagerly awaiting, and debating, the big-budget film. Early reactions ranged from utter disgust to complete and total admiration, which brings me to my thoughts on the film -- one which ended up being sent to the Marvel scrap heap in lieu of a 2008 movie that pretended (basically) this film never happened.<br /><br />Before I dive into specifics, I can say that I was first appalled when I heard about the concept of Lee and James Schamus' version. Having grown up on the old Bill Bixby-Lou Ferrigno show, plus the various cartoon incarnations, the idea that Bruce Banner became the Hulk courtesy of his father's attempts to play God, to the mystery surrounding his mother's death, to the Hulk being able to leap tall buildings with a single bound -- all of them were pretty hard to swallow considering my youthful memories of the Incredible Hulk.<br /><br />While what Lee and Schamus (along with credited co-writers Michael France and John Turman) have come up with is at times too dark for its own good, and is overly bogged down in psychological aspects that don't quite come off, THE HULK is still an ambitious, flawed, but always watchable combination of silly, colorful Marvel Comics action and a study of parents and children and what makes us all tick.<br /><br />Sound like a jumbled mess? Well, it works better than you might have heard. Eric Bana essays Bruce Banner, a California research scientist who works alongside former lover Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly) in a lab for their betterment of mankind. Their work, though, spurs interest from Josh Lucas, who represents an "evil corporation" that's also associated with Betty's military dad (Sam Elliott). Enter Bruce's long-lost father (Nick Nolte, appropriately disheveled in one of his best performances in years), who has tracked down his son and wants to make good on the experiments he believes are trapped in his son's DNA. Obviously, it's just a matter of time before Bruce is ticked off and his transformation into the Hulk occurs.<br /><br />When it does, it's a triumph of CGI animation on the part of Industrial Light & Magic, who have fully captured the look and movement of a comic book character on-screen. Unlike the tempering of the X-Men's physical characteristics (i.e. their subdued uniforms), ILM's Hulk isn't a compromise -- it's the animated character captured in its full, colorful glory, and while some may carp that the Hulk doesn't look "real" (as if a 20- foot green creature ever could), I found ILM's work to be tremendous here. The Hulk's facial animation is nothing short of outstanding (he's certainly more emotive than Bana's bland Banner), like a combination of Frankenstein's monster and Ferrigno's old muscular creation, and the level of detail in the creature is astounding.<br /><br />That aspect of the movie brings with it some completely absurd sequences -- like the Hulk's battle with gamma-radiated dogs -- but they're completely in tune with the kind of action that anyone who grew up reading Marvel Comics will appreciate seeing on-screen. This Hulk does have the ability to leap into the sky, bound off cliffs and ledges, and dismantle anything that comes in his way, but the FX are great and Lee builds the dramatic conflict between father and son up enough that the movie works if you're willing to meet it halfway -- especially in its almost-indescribable, completely "comic book" final confrontation between the two.<br /><br />Getting to that point does require some patience, as Lee spends a great deal of time establishing the relationships between nutty old man Banner and his bottled up son, not to mention Betty Ross and her military father. It's a little heavy-handed and slow-going at times, but you have to applaud the filmmakers for trying to establish characters and drama in a movie that ultimately turns more outlandish than any comic book film in recent memory.<br /><br />Nolte's ultimately over-the-top performance goes for broke and fits the movie perfectly, as does Elliott's excellent work as Ross' father. Bana and Connelly are OK but don't have much chemistry with one another, and the former is completely overshadowed by the Hulk once the muscular one takes over. One failing of the film is its notable lack of humor -- there should have been an additional supporting player on-hand for the audience to identify with, since every character is overly brooding and wrapped up in the story.<br /><br />Visually, THE HULK benefits from Frederick Elmes' fine cinematography and the use of comic book-styled "panels" that keep reminding the viewer that you're watching a comic book movie -- even if the Shakespearian aspects of the script sometimes clash with its pulpy pedigree.<br /><br />Danny Elfman's music, meanwhile, is always serviceable but comes off as uninspired for the composer, sounding like a compromise between what Lee reportedly wanted (is there some point to the female vocalist who wails away on the soundtrack?) and a by-the- numbers Elfman score that has "auto-pilot" written all over it (the furious "lab montage" motifs reminiscent of "Darkman," the dark and brooding "Batman"-like aspects, the "Planet of the Apes" percussion, etc). While I wasn't a huge fan of Elfman's solid but unremarkable work on "Spider-Man", THE HULK unquestionably sounds like the result of one too many trips to the same well for the composer.<br /><br />THE HULK is decidedly uneven but constantly surprising and, in the end, highly satisfying from a number of angles. It's a movie that takes a lot of risks and encompasses a wide range of emotions, and while some are more successful than others, it's certainly one of the most audacious attempts at creating a live-action comic-book that can sustain the interest of both adults and kids. Even with its shortcomings, it's a strongly recommended view.</p></br><a href="../users/A35L2E8M7S59MQ.html">A35L2E8M7S59MQ</a><br/><p>4.5/5 stars<br /><br />"Hulk" 2003 is very different from what you would expect from a typical summer popcorn creature-feature.  From the advertising campaign it appeared to be a mindless special effects extravaganza with little to no plot whatsoever; AKA Summer Fun.  For those who went to see it with that mindset it was undoubtedly a not so pleasant surprise.  Most of whom who saw this on its initial theatrical release obviously had not foreseen Ang Lee's philosophical drama, and they instantly retaliated causing Hulk to fail in most ways.<br /><br />I was surprised, but not in the way these common viewers were, because I loved Hulk.  It is a superhero movie unlike any other comic based film in the last twenty-five years.  This is a film that is filled with heart and emotion and delivers it fully in ways no other film of this genre has done before it.  The art direction and special effects are astounding, and helps bring this comic character to life and oh so much more.<br /><br />The plot starts off rather simply with David Banner, a geneticist who has been studying regeneration, experimenting on various animals and finally ends up injecting himself.  Eventually the mustached scientist has a son - Bruce Banner - who has apparently inherited his father's lab created gene.<br /><br />We now skip forward several years as Bruce begins studying exactly what his father had all those years before: regeneration.  This only ends in what can only be described as disaster as an exposure of "Gamma Rays" causes his inherited gene to emerge transforming him into the not so jolly, green behemoth known as the Hulk.  From there we are thrown into several well done action sequences as the military under the command of Gen. Thaddeus 'Thunderbolt' Ross (a very human and well-crafted performance by Sam Elliot) begins an attempt to capture Bruce/Hulk to obtain this gene.  Only complicating Bruce's hectic life is the reappearance of his crazed father who also cares more about the studies of his past opposed to his son's well-being which goes beyond abuse before finally leading up to an enormous CGI confrontation between mutated father and son.<br /><br />The Hulk does lack in the category of CGI at times with quality going up and down during a few cuts, and an adrenaline junkie will not enjoy the level of dialogue and drama that fills this plot that must have been a cinematic fusion between King Kong, Frankenstein and Marvel Comics.  Ang Lee perfectly utilizes the split frame, thus turning this film into a living comic book and the entire cast does their part in moving the plot along.  This isn't so much a superhero film as it is a doorway looking into the delicacy of humanity.  You know and care about the characters, and you can certainly care about the man beneath the giant green muscled frame of the Hulk.  That is what the movie is about, not a giant green man smashing things up for ninety minutes like so many 2003 movie goers were expecting.<br /><br />Sadly this film didn't hit the audience it should've due to Universal's careless advertising that passed this off as a popcorn film.  If you're someone who likes emotionally compelling and ambitious tales Hulk (2003) may be the superhero film for you.  If you liked Frankenstein or any of the King Kong adaptations Hulk will probably be a movie for you, just don't go in unprepared to think about the material you're viewing.  This is one that one should defiantly pay attention to because it is probably the most underrated film of the 20th century.</p></br><a href="../users/APM06HT7JIPZ5.html">APM06HT7JIPZ5</a><br/><p>I wanted desperately to see this movie, and even wrote a review on amazon.com stating my enthusiasm.  Well, I must admit, it was worth the wait and hype . . . . . . sort of.<p>HULK is a difficult movie to review.  It has so many ups and downs that it comes off as one of those films you simply can't place your finger (or opinion) on.  I'll just make it easier and take it in random sections.<p>The acting was great.  Eric Bana perfectly embodied the emotionally bottled-up Bruce Banner, and he is quite powerful and moving at times.  Jennifer Connelly is an Academy Award winner, and that sort of speaks for itself.  It's awesome to see Sam Elliot back on the screen again; he is, needless to say, perfect, especially for the role of a military general.  And Nick Nolte is . . . . . well, Nick Nolte.  His role in this film was a very strange and unsettling one, a role that when placed in the hands of almost any other actor would've destroyed the entire movie.  But Mr. Nolte does one helluva job at it, and he's a thrill to watch.<p>The action was absolutely riveting!!  I feel somewhat strange saying this, considering the fact that this is obviously meant to be a character study above anything else, but the action scenes were the highlight(s) of the film.  Oh, and I've heard countless people complain about the special effects.  I can only guess they were basing their opinions on the Superbowl trailer, because the stuff I saw on the big screen was spectacular.  True, at times it really does show, but for the most part it's some of the best stuff I've ever seen.  And for all you dorks who ranted on about how stupid it was to do the Hulk in CGI, well you've been watching that old TV show too much and not reading enough of the comics.  HEEELLOOOOOOOOOOO???!!??!  The Hulk IS fifteen feet tall, and he CAN leap that far, and I'd be impressed beyond belief if they could pull that off by just painting some beefed up guy green!  (Note: Do not conclude from all this that I do not enjoy the old TV show; it was, in fact, a very well-done series, and watching that old painted Hulk ( I forgot his name) was always very entertaining.)<p>It's kind of like the FX work in SPIDER-MAN, as in the CGI is realistic enough (more so in HULK) to convince, yet at the same time it perfectly captures the sense of a comic book to satisfy comic fans.  All this is put into action even more efficiently in HULK, because of the use of pannels on screen (exactly like you would find in a comic book).  However, the filmmakers far too often overuse this technique.  Seeing the Hulk leaping onto a helicopter from three different angles is really cool, but watching a man walking down a hallway from three different angles is just plain pointless.  The trick does, overall, prove to enhance the viewing experience, mainly the action scenes.<p>Now for some more cons.  I'm dismayed even more with the music by Danny Elfman, whose score for HULK was equally as bland and uninvolving as his work in SPIDER-MAN.  This troubles me, considering the fact that Elfman is (or used to be) one of the greatest in the field of film music!  I can only hope he improves in the future.<p>Now I come to the worst part of the film: the ending.  It just totally fell apart!  It was both confusing and disturbing, with Nick Nolte going more than a little psycho.  And the final image I found to be just plain stupid; it's whole purpose was to tell us that a sequal was on the way, and it was very choppily done.  On the other hand, it is very nice to know that there is at least one sequal on the way, as there are so many elements of the film left unexplained.  But I guess I shouldn't be all that surprised; disappointed to be sure, but how else could a project like HULK end?  It's so huge and massive that it could not help but topple over in the end, and completely collapse under its own weight.<p>So, there you have it.  Totally mind-blowing action, some very dramatic moments, great acting, and spectacular special effects.  On the other hand, a bland score, far too much hinting on what is hidden inside Banner during the beginning of the film, and a trashy ending.<p>Overall, definitely worth seeing in theaters (it would be a crime not to), but don't go in expecting the bravura that was SUPERMAN, or anything.</p></br><a href="../users/A169I83JL8QJGN.html">A169I83JL8QJGN</a><br/><p>The Hulk isn't one of my personal favorites. I'm one of the few people in this world who feel that the only thing good to come out of the Hulk was Wolverine (Issue #180-181 of the Hulk was Wolverine's first appearance.) Then again I did grow up on re-runs of the Hulk TV series as well, so I did have some level of high expectations for the film. Despite my belief that the plot of the Hulk (until recently) has been relatively thin, and more about Hulk tearing things apart than anything deeper I had hoped that the movie would opt to explore the more recent Jeckyl and Hyde approach of the newer comics, which have been incredible (pun intended.) Hulk should be a horror story, not an action movie. I think the biggest flaw of this film is that despite its attempt to remind audiences that its based on a comic book (wipes and fades that look like a page turning, comic like "cells" that also resemble TV's 24, etc.) this is Ang Lee's Hulk... not Stan Lee's. I appreciate the nod to the TV series, like the cameo by Mr. Ferigno, and "David" Banner... I don't appreciate the changes to the character's origin, which were done poorly.<br /> Stan Lee had this thing about making super heroes out of radiation, these days we know a lot more about radiation than we did then, so we replace radiation with genetic engineering. In my opinion if the origin of the Hulk was to be changed it should have followed the new origin presented in Marvel's "Ultimate" continuity. Even though I'm not that big of a Hulk fan I feel very betrayed by this film. That was not the Bruce Banner I remember, or David Banner (from the TV series), and in all honesty what they did with his father was just plane bad. The story seemed incoherent, and Hulk looked fake. I'm sorry but that's all there is too it. I would have liked it more had it not dealt with the father subplot. Exploring Banner himself, repressing his rage over a bad break up perhaps? Dealing with everything going wrong in his life at the moment and then BOOM his hit with the Gamma rays, or if I had my way the Super Soldier Serum, which would also open doors for a movie based on the Ultimates.<br /> It's really a shame to see Fox with the rights to X-Men and universal with the rights to Hulk... I'll never get to see the live action epic battle between Wolverine and the Hulk, and maybe Wolvie's making an appearance here could have saved this movie, since nothing else could. Who knows, the movie did have a lot of good ideas, they were just poorly executed. Perhaps the sequel will be better.</p></br><a href="../users/AR37967IAR6ZT.html">AR37967IAR6ZT</a><br/><p>HULK was joyless and odd, and the camerawork, with the split screens, at first seemed inventive but just eventually became distracting. (For instance, the death scene of Josh Lucas was just silly.) The daddy stuff was irritating, and the whole "What happened behind the door?" thing was painfully obvious. <p>And shouldn't the gamma accident that unleashed the Hulk pack more of an impact than it did? It seemed largely behind the point. When I think about the Green Goblin creation scene in SPIDER-MAN last year, it was much better done.<p>The worst scene was when David and Bruce Banner were both sent to that platform and spotlighted heavily ... and someone encouraged Nick Nolte to go all Brando, which made no sense. (In that scene, Nick Nolte just looked like he was giving an example of an "angry monologue" on INSIDE THE ACTOR'S STUDIO.) <p>Why on Earth was it so long? Why do you cast such charismatic actors as Nolte, Jennifer Connelly (who's capable of tremendous versatility), the hammy, funny Sam Elliott and Eric Bana (who's a known comedian in Australia) in a film so devoid of charm or humor? It makes no sense.<p>And Ang Lee's made some terrific comedies and heartfelt dramas. Though ambitious in what it tried to do about these characters' emotions, HULK failed to be compelling and was just terrible.</p></br><a href="../users/A13KXWTN0DT878.html">A13KXWTN0DT878</a><br/><p>Predictable. Longer than it should have been. Occasionally bogus CGI. And that's all that I found wrong with Ang Lee's Hulk. The story, the nonbogus CGI, and the action sequences were greatly cinematic.<p> I found it predictable because there was nothing new to be seen. I even thought of certain plot points a few seconds before they happened. To defend the movie, this only happened a few times. The remainder of the story carried the movie along well, and was great. I highly enjoyed the fact that there was a lot of drama and more of a psychological bend to the story. The CGI, and there was a ton of it, occasionally came off as bogus, but it was minimal. The first time the Hulk appeared is when it struck me as bogus, but as the movie went on, the Hulk began to look more and more real. Especially the water scenes and when he was running. I occasionally found the running time exasperating. I asked myself once "There's more?" only because although I expected there to be a closure with .. father, I didn't expect the ending that I got. The ending was quite out there too. <p> What really brought me along the movie was the acting. Eric Bana was excellent for the part. Prior to Hulk, I'd actually never heard of him. As Bruce, he hit every emotional note and carried the character well. Jennifer Connelly was beautiful here. Her acting - as always - was right on. The shots where she stared intensely at Bruce, and the camera lingered on her were incredible. Nick Nolte pulled off homicidal very well. He's ... always scared me personally. And Sam Ross's chemistry with Connelly made him a bit more of a character than he could have been. Meaning, seeing how he portrayed the love for his daughter, it made me like him a bit even though he knew he was doing what was best. Ang Lee did an amazing job with an amazing cast. <p> Since Hulk resides in the comic-to-film genre, I can say that even though it's not better than the X-Men series, it was a few steps up from Spiderman. I'd place it between Daredevil and Spiderman.</p></br><a href="../users/A27FR2C67JPDRS.html">A27FR2C67JPDRS</a><br/><p>I've heard a number of mediocre reviews of this film and even several friends commented on the fact that the Hulk doesn't look "real" enough...so I went into the film with low expectations.  After seeing the film, I don't think "Hulk" is a bad film.  All the principle characters do well in there roles and I think Eric Bana does a decent job as the normally low-keyed Bruce Banner, a scientist, who has a monstrous rage lurking deep inside himself.  There were some moments when the story dragged a little and it is quite a while before you see the big green guy, but its an interesting look at a comic book character that isn't necessarily a hero...though he may do some good for people sometimes.  The CGI Hulk looked fine to me, more like the character from the pages of the Stan Lee comic and I thought it was pretty cool seeing him change from Bruce and back again.  My main problem with the film is the use of split screens, which after a while, became incredibly annoying.  I think director Ang Lee may have been trying to give us the feel of an actual comic book but in the end it was distracting.  Jennifer Connelly did good in her role, though there wasn't a good deal for her to do---I think she would make a terric Wonder Woman in the long postponed Warner Bros film that still has yet to be made.  I think next time a round it will be easier for the director to get right into the story now that he's established the Hulk's origin.  Nick Nolte was a little over the top for me but still did well as Banner's grungy and insane scientist father.  Josh Lucas (of Sweet Home Alabama) does a mean turn as another villain in the story.  Is it worth seeing...sure, its a summer blockbuster...a popcorn movie.  But lets hope next time around the Hulk is a bigger, badder misunderstood monster, with NO split screens!</p></br><a href="../users/A329U9CDUPKXAC.html">A329U9CDUPKXAC</a><br/><p>I was looking forward to this movie for a long time. I've been a fan of the Hulk ever since I was a little kid. I watched the cartoons, collected the toys and went as the Hulk for Halloween. So to see this super hero come to life is a dream come true. At least, it was until I saw it. The first half of the movie is incredibly boring. I actually felt like walking out. I REALLY did not like the display of animal cruelty. That was inexcusable. Another thing I hated was the way they used frames on the screen to make it look like a comic book. That was distracting and annoying. The acting in the movie was very bad. Nobody seemed shocked when they saw the Hulk. When Betty first sees him she's like "Oh, hi there!" And when Hulk is fighting the hulk doggies she's like "Oh, this is interesting..." Another thing, why is the army keeps shooting Hulk when they know it doesn't hurt him? Why don't they leave him alone until he calms down? Another thing, why did the local police get called on? Do they think their tiny guns can stop him? I really didn't care about Betty and her relationship with her father. I didn't care about Bruce and his relationship with his father. I didn't care about Bruce and Betty's fathers relationships with each other. I didn't care about the guy who wanted to make money off of the Hulk. I just really didn't like this movie. What a let down.</p></br><a href="../users/A356HRZZFCEGL1.html">A356HRZZFCEGL1</a><br/><p>Ludicrous as it may seem to some, reviewing "(The Incredible) Hulk" (movie, comic, or otherwise) is like sampling every course in a smorgasbord. It abounds with numerous substantial themes, some classical, some Shakespearean, others mythological.  "Hulk" also dives into psychological trauma from Oedipal and paternal conflict,  emotional and psychological abuse and repression. It even explores the essence of true identity  - is "Bruce Banner" merely the facade, and "Hulk" the real personality, as his own megalomaniacal father Dr. David Banner (Nick Nolte) mentions late in the film- and the intoxicating freedom of self-discovery. The movie is a skillfully constructed blend of other literary and cinematic works, from the obvious ("Frankenstein", "Beauty and the Beast", "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde") to the more arcane, bizarre, and obscure ("Altered States," "The Island of Dr. Moreau," "Swamp Thing!", and yes, I do dare declare it, "Superman: the Movie"). Ang Lee has attempted to create an epic drama from a deceptively simplistic and superficial "creature" and has succeeded admirably. All the characters reveal vulnerability, dimension, and soul. I was transfixed watching this spectacle, and the Hulk, come to triumphant life.<br /><br />Anyone, I believe, caring to invest a bit of thought and interest in the movie's unfolding should not have had any reason to be bored. In this buffet of a movie, the first 45 minutes of exposition were not merely filler, but the essential meat fleshing out the enigma that the reserved, diffident, frustrated, and emotionally constipated Bruce Banner is. Eric Bana managed to convey this emotional repression and yet still evoke my sympathy, just as David Jansen did as Richard Kimble in "The Fugitive", yet another inspiration. His interaction with Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly) was fascinating and seminal because although she claimed to be disillusioned with Bruce's impassivity, inevitably she could never cut herself away from him because, as the backdrop of her life demonstrated, she, too, is Bruce's alter ego and soulmate, destined to help in his healing and salvation.<br /><br />Despite the various themes swirling around, I feel "Hulk" is ultimately a movie dealing with the triumph of self-discovery, catharsis, and redemption. Bruce was doomed to an eternal prison of self-ignorance and loneliness inflicted by his wildly iconoclastic, obsessed father. Ironically, the gamma radiation gives him the key, because, like the potion in "Swamp Thing", the rays did not transform him so much as made him more of what he truly is. It is as the Hulk that Bruce salvages lost memories of his traumatic childhood. It is as the Hulk that Bruce retaliates against specific tormentors, rather than indiscrimately attack everyone in sight (as a truly mindless monster will). It is as the Hulk that Bruce embraces the heady feeling of power and freedom and begins to examine himself at the same time. Hulk is often described as a "tragic figure" and ample evidence exists of that in the movie, with his anguished roars of wrath and pain, his innocent, soulful stares when he is relatively calm, and, yes, his attempts to put his power to good use (e.g., saving Betty from the freakish Hulk dogs and trying to save the jet from crashing into the Golden Gate Bridge. I think Ang Lee was trying to chronicle the birth of a new "Superman", crude, terrifying, and unrelenting at first, but striving to become a true, caring, FORGIVING, superhero (as he demonstrates when he shakes the soldiers out of the tank turret before destroying it and during his climactic battle with his berserk, "Absorbing Man" father). Ultimately, Ang Lee transcends the tragedy of the Hulk's origin to suggest that, with luck, Bruce/Hulk will overcome their horrific legacy and the uncomprehending hostility of mankind to become a fully contributory and valuable member (not just a scientific genius) of the world.<br /><br />As you can see, I could turn the "Hulk" into a Ph.d dissertation. I am sure some graduate student already has. Yet, lest you think I am some verbose intellectual snob, let me assure you I also enjoyed the Hulk's visceral as well as cerebral pleasure. The entire desert/San Francisco battle sequence was taut, exciting, and exhilarating. The CGI behemoth, I felt, was utterly convincing and compelling, both in close-up and during his prodigious, soaring leaps. Hulk's phenomenal powers themselves are not a curse, as Roger Ebert mentioned in his review, but a blessing in an "inhuman disguise". Hulk revels in his power; during one of his stratospheric leaps, he actually reminded me of Superman in the 1978 movie just soaring through the air for the sheer joy of it.<br /><br />In conclusion, I believe Ang Lee successfully delivered both an intellectual and emotionally stimulating and evocative movie and created a respectful homage to Stan Lee and Jack Kirby's classically archetypal character. And yes, I own the DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/A13DQTXG02HZC1.html">A13DQTXG02HZC1</a><br/><p>I am more interested in the making of this movie more than the movie itself.  When it was revealed that Ang Lee was to direct this blockbuster, few eye-brows were raised of the choice.  If we sit through the making of the film, it was explained that he's needed to bring sense and sensibility to one of Marvel Comic's most successful franchise.  In the end, we end up with a movie that is neither nor.  It's just the way it is and expectedly, fingers are pointed.  Rumours started to spread about cast and production crews were tense working under a Director who was tunnel-visioned in actualising his vision (nothing wrong with that).  The making of the movie also divulged to us Ang Lee's donning of rubbery suits with sensors on them to feed datas to ILM's software to create the Hulk that he envisioned, & his involvements in the music creation (Ang Lee kept reminding Danny Elfman that his music score should be less Danny Elfman's).  For Ang Lee, the making of this movie is a challenge, to tackle something that he hasn't tackled before. For him, that means trying to merge the art of comics with the art of films and trying to portray the characters here in a three dimensional manner rather than cutboard characters from comics.  Ang Lee endeavoured to give us an insight into Banner and his alter-ago, his tulmutous relationship with his father (played brilliantly by Nick Nolte) who was really a mad scientist who played God, the forbidden love between Banner and Ross (Jennifer Connelly's character).  Sam Elliot was brilliant as a General who was dead-heat in pursuing and terminating Hulk.  He's not a Captain Ahab of Moby Dick's fame but rather, a humane General who was simply doing his job, to the resentment of his daughter, Ross who wanted to reconcile the relationship between the daughter and the father.  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  I respect the fact that a lot of thoughts and efforts have gone into making this a commendable adult comic movie.  I guess as a result, it becomes the victim of its own success.  People commented about the incredulity of Hulk flying on the air, of him jumping for joy in the Grand Canyon, not being faithful to the comics offering, of the unrealistic projection of the CGI Hulk.  However, if people can see beyond the fact that the CGI is simply a part of the total sum, then, people would start to appreciate how tragic this movie actually is.  This is a undeniably an ambitious movie.  I think Ang Lee has achieved his brief of making an adult movie out of a comic strips but majority of the audience actually wants a candy pop no brainer action movie.  All I can say is that the studio has misread the sentiment of the public and the fault is not with Ang for he did his bit brilliantly, perhaps, too brilliantly.  Commendable effort.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ROE64EVHDTTV.html">A3ROE64EVHDTTV</a><br/><p>The Good Things<br />*A few good special effects and action scenes.<br />*Some pieces of strong, interesting imagery.<br />*Despite being convoluted and slow, some of the drama and dialogue is interesting and thought-provoking.  The characters are deep, when you stop and really look at them.<br />*The style (even though very heavily saturated with strange transitions) does a good job at giving the film a comic-book look.<br />*The actors are not bad.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*The film's style, despite being somewhat nifty, is also a little too bizzare to watch.<br />*The storyline is slow, melodramatic, and hard to figure out in some places.<br />*Some scenes look too dark.<br /><br />This is a case where an artistic style has gotten in the way of what should be an exciting, brawling action movie.  What action we see is pretty cool, but we need to wade through a mile of confusing slow-paced drama and weird film effects before we get there.  I think it's not a bad start, but the sequel "The Incredible Hulk" is truly way better.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EZMV5DSWU8TU.html">A1EZMV5DSWU8TU</a><br/><p>That quote could very well be The Hulk's motto, for no matter what is levelled against him, he grows stronger with increasing rage. The Hulk is another Marvel character I have enjoyed since peering into the pages of comic book legendry and watching the series with Lou Ferrigno {who also briefly appears herein}, and I must say that this film does him justice. in My opinion. Ironically, Dr. Bruce Banner just wants to be left alone, yet antagonists repeatedly attempt to get a rise out of him, to their horror.<br /><br />The Hulk/Bruce Banner dichotomy definitely exemplifies the were-creature of The Id, at odds with himself, instead of accepting and controlling his own darkside, which in the comics, he eventually does accomplish. We also see this symbology in the characters of Dr. Jeckyl & Mr. Hyde, and of course, The Werewolf. If these emotions are seen as natural proclivities, balance is attained, thus expressing them in constructive ways.<br /><br />The CGI kinematics are very well done, flowing gracefully and believably - yet the question remains, how does The Hulk acquire those purple pants? At no time does Banner wear purple pants, yet they appear mysteriously every time. But I digress. The Hulk presented here is an absolutely inhumanly large creature, sometimes growing to about 12" tall, his massive frame supplemented as his adrenaline increases.<br /><br />I thought one of the most impressive scenes was during the mutant dog battle, as he heroically saves his love interest Betty from their fearsome jaws, and the desert sequences when he jumps miles across land, and in San Francisco - the savage beast is quelled by the gentle hands of the lovely girl, whose father is a general persuing him relentlessly through desert and urban environments, using everything from tanks to fighter planes, which The Hulk tosses about like toys.<br /><br />Banner's father appears as an unassuming janitor working at the lab, released after years of government captivity, with a chip on his shoulder, and is intent on gaining revenge for his incarceration. His opportunity arrives when he uses the solution combined with Gamma Radiation to acquire his own powers of melding with whatever object he touches, and absorbing energy, which proves to be just too much for him when he and The Hulk lock together during the final battle scene.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Banner must seclude himself from his beloved Betty for her safety, and dissappears into the world, but a force such as this cannot be contained forever, manifesting when angered again.</p></br><a href="../users/A391YPR0NFTCLK.html">A391YPR0NFTCLK</a><br/><p>It has its moments and it can be flashy fun at times and very serious at others.

While recovering in the hospital, he realizes that he's not in pain and feels much better than he ever did.  The downside to the accident is that it gives him the power to turn into a bulging green giant whenever his angry feelings no longer remain supressed.  For someone not knowing anything about the Hulk, I was quite surprised to find myself enjoying this movie. The only bad thing I have to say about this film with the CGI in this film.  It was awful.</p></br><a href="../users/AS28WVBBZ3G99.html">AS28WVBBZ3G99</a><br/><p>This movie is just awful. The bleakness of the story line is  only slightly worse than the emptiness and vapidity of the acting. The love story between Banner and his girl-friend (Connelly) lacks any warmth or interest. And what should have been a powerful relationship between Banner and his father ends up ragged, confused, and senseless.<p>For those old enough to have enjoyed either the Stan Lee comics or the TV show, ignore this movie. It is but a poor reflection of a creative and engaging sotry. This weak rendition will leave you empty and disappointed.</p></br><a href="../users/A3O2RCKAMSE9X7.html">A3O2RCKAMSE9X7</a><br/><p>Whenever Hollywood tries to film a successful comic book hero concept, the director's most pressing problem is deciding how to integrate the character's distinct persona into a medium for which it was not originally designed.  The temptation to focus on special effects over characterization is usually too great to resist.  With HULK, director Ang Lee completely disregarded the tension that resided in the comic version of Bruce Banner's split personality.  On the inked page, artist/lettermen Stan Lee and Steve Ditko presented a dichotomous soul that drew in the reader, always making him wonder how the kind but ineffectual Bruce Banner could survive his transformations into the green Hulk without losing his inner self in the process.  On the celluloid screen, what the viewer sees is a mess that includes (in no particular order) a troubled youth's attempt to bury horrific memories, a warped father/son relation that results in two, rather than one, monsters, a love interest that fizzles for lack of chemistry, a raging green golem that offers no rationale for that rage, and a series of special effects that are so patently computer enhanced that the viewer cannot submit to that essential willing suspension of disbelief that is always needed to make any far-fetched plot work.  Eric Bana, who plays Bruce Banner, bears a stunning resemblance to what Toby McGuire of SPIDERMAN might look like in the next decade.  Bill Bixby, who was the original television Hulk, managed to invest his role with the needed mixture of pathos, tension, and repressed rage.  Bana simply sleepwalks through his rages which lasted only for as long as it took for the computer Hulk to make an appearance.  Jennifer Connoly, as the love interest, shows none of the zip and zowie that she showed previously in A BEAUTIFUL MIND.  Sam Elliot, who plays her four star general father, is your typically one-dimensional military man who can see the creature but not how to make that creature worthy of a hunt.  As a hunter of escaped fugitives, Elliot could take a few lessons from Barry Morse, who, in his FUGITIVE days, knew how to invest his hunter's persona with bedrock personality.  It came as no surprise to me that HULK tanked at the box office in only its second week.  For a comic book hero to make the successful leap from the printed page to the celluloid screen, that hero ought to do more than merely leap mindnumbing distances.  This mindnumbing, in HULK'S case, rubbed off on the film as well.</p></br><a href="../users/ATS7LYGLUX34L.html">ATS7LYGLUX34L</a><br/><p>Ang Lee's Hulk seems like a love-it-or-hate-it type of movie, and I'm sure that in the weeks ahead it'll become quite fashionable to take potshots at the film, so I'll going to try to keep my review fair. I've been a fan of The Hulk since I was two years old; The comics, the cartoons, the TV show, toys, everything. I tried to keep my pre-conceived notions to a minimum, and I was actually impressed by how well the screenplay did with integrating various important characters from the Hulk mythos, as well as the way it managed to stress the psychological underpinnings of the character in addition to the scientific aspects. But in the end, the movie will stand or fall depending on one thing: The filmmaker's ability to convince the audience the The Hulk is real. That's where I had a problem...<p>  Eric Bana plays Bruce Krenzler, a mild-mannered civillian scientist working on a top-secret Military project; Jennifer Connolly is Betty Ross, his co-worker/former lover. Krenzler is haunted by snatches of repressed memories from his childhood, and when a seedy-looking Janitor named David Banner (Nick Nolte) starts working nights cleaning the labs, Bruce's problems REALLY start. Seems Bruce is really Bruce BANNER, the crazy janitor is really his Dad, and Dad's not looking for a family reunion, either- He wants to see what effect his self-experimentation had on his offspring in the thirty years since they last saw each other. Bruce is accidentally dosed with radiation and nanobots in a freak lab mishap, and before you know it, his carefully controlled temper is taking on a life of it's own......A big, green life.<p>  I didn't hate the film, but I didn't really like it either. It just kind of....was there, I guess. Bana really isn't given much to do except be victimized, and that's a shame since he's a very talented actor, as he showed in Chopper. Connolly looks pretty and dazed, Nolte looks and acts crazy, Josh Lucas plays the pre-requisite Army creep...Only Sam Elliott really stands out as Betty's father, General "Thunderbolt" Ross. At times it seemed like he had wandered in from a different movie; His performance was THAT much better than the others. Or at least more lively; The rest of the cast seems like they just woke up. The film seemed overlong, and really dragged in spots. Director Ang Lee uses split-screen/picture-in-picture techniques to simulate the feel of a comic-book brought to life, and it works, to an extent, but to me split-screen in a movie has always seemed cheap-looking and pretentious, and after a while it really got annoying. I was stuck on one plot point, too- If Nolte's character is so dangerous, how about keeping tabs on him after he got released from prison? How did he get a job cleaning a top-secret facility? How can he get into seemingly restricted areas at will? Why doesn't Betty tell her Father where Nolte lives as soon as she realizes what he's doing? But as I said, my real problem was The Hulk himself: I just didn't believe him for a minute. The effects just looked cheesy, and I can't put my finger on any one reason. First off, he was WAAAY too tall; At times he looked to be about 15 feet tall, and seeing people running around at knee level just reminded me of a Godzilla movie. Wasn't the 8-10 feet range presented in the comics tall enough...? The height of The Hulk in the movie made all of the action sequences look oddly off somehow. Regardless, after the seamless integration of the CGI Gollum with live-action actors in The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, the bar was raised, and Hulk doesn't stack up. Gollum seemed totally real; Hulk seems like a cartoon brought into the real world, making his interaction with the "real" actors look like a Roger Rabbit-esque blend of live-action and Disney-style animation. I just could NOT suspend my disbelief enough, no matter how hard I tried. A few members of the audience I saw it with were laughing derisively throughout the film, which is never a good sign. And did we really need that French-Poodle...? The sequence in the desert wher The Hulk battles an armored column of Tanks was good, and the effects seemed more streamlined there, maybe because of the color scheme; I was surprised at the inclusion of a plot twist at the end that leads up to the big action finale, and comic fans will get a smile out of seeing a classic Hulk villain kinda-sorta brought to the big-screen, but overall I found The Hulk to be a joyless, overlong film that was more disappointing because I wanted to love it, but just couldn't. Maybe the sequel will be more my cup of tea.....</p></br><a href="../users/A20EEWWSFMZ1PN.html">A20EEWWSFMZ1PN</a><br/><p>We all know it is a no-no to do genetic experiments on people. And once again a scientist David Banner has to do it to himself. Now to compound the problem he passes a trait onto his offspring Bruce Banner (Eric Bana). Add a little lab accident and et voila instant hulk.<br /><br />This is not the best integration of real, animation and CGI. Blu-ray can not mask the fact that this is mostly cartoon. Yet the story is told and you have fun watching. There is a father / son conflict and a misunderstood Hulk dismantles a lot of military equipment with extreme prejudice. This film does not try to follow the TV series and is not so dated. The only real drawback is that Jennifer Connelly is just too cute and you forget to keep track of the story line.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AWYOGE">Dark Water (Unrated Widescreen Edition)</a></p></br><a href="../users/A1O60Q7LBN4MQ.html">A1O60Q7LBN4MQ</a><br/><p>This have been a better movie if they kept the demographic audience in mind.

Not more then 2 days later there was a thing on TV about the making of this movie, and sure enough, theres the guy raving on about how realistic this charactor of the Hulk looks. How wrong they are.<p>If it wasnt for my old man buying it ex-rental after I told him 100 times not to buy it, he bought it, and I suffered through watching it, just incase I was wrong and it was an ok movie? But my hunch was right, i should not have watched it... If your a fan, or remember the original TV series of the Hulk, then dont expect this movie to have anything to do with that, it's like how they took Godzilla and changed that in the latest one they made. The Hulk stars Aussie EX-comedian Eric Bana, who at one point was one of the funniest people on Australian T.V with his performances in stand up and sketch comedy which are the way I wish to remember him. This movie, however, was completly boring, had plots just going no-where, the most boring dialog, and as i said, the worst CGI effects of the year!<p>Dont just take my word for it, just look at how many second hand copys there are currently selling right now? and how much for?!<p>I wouldnt recomend you even watch this movie for free.

Make that a movie, that would be somthing intresting, instead, here is your classic exsample of Hollyweed completly dry out of ideas, and recycling old ideas, old shows, old movies, and putting CGI to them expecting it to be a hit.... well, it didnt work for me, they need to learn to stop worrying so much about CGI effects and think about how to give a storyline a great plot.<p>I'd tell you about the extra features, and if there's any egg's...but I hated the movie so much, i didnt even bother to stick the second disc in to look at it!</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>I wanted to love this movie, but ended up just a little disappointed. The story is interesting, but the films pacing is uneven. It does capure some of the feel of the comic book and I thought the CGI Hulk looked good most of the time. I didn't mind the Hulk being CGI, but why did they changed the original story so much?<br /><br />Changing Dr. Banner from a meek book worm into a typical leading man was not the wisest decision. There was no contrast between the two alter egos and this could have been used to there advantage throughout the film. I also felt the story was a bit long sometime tedious. I also thought making the hulk grow to 15 feet was a little too big, it made it even harder to believe those purple pants could stretch that much. When the Hulk was on screen, this film is full of great Hulk action, I loved the desert scene when The Hulk is running towards the tank!<br /><br />In the end, while I liked this film, it ;eft a lot of room for improvement. There was enough going for it, to overlook some of the flaws, but this could have been a really good movie with a few tweaks here and there.<br /><br />I had invisioned a movie like the original Frankenstein or King Kong with a misunderstood monster that just wanted to be left alone......Too Bad.

I put off viewing the film for a long time because I believed that it was a poor film. WRONG! The special effect of the Hulk is terrific. The storyline is excellent.

Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>HULK is one of those movies that I found myself ambivalent about.  While director Ang Lee has a certain undeniable flair, the movie itself is not what one would expect, in terms of action.  Credible CGI effects are brilliant, and Eric Bana and Jennifer Connolly do a commendable job in filling out underdeveloped roles.  I must also admit that as I did in the t.v. version of the HULK, I wondered why Banner busts out of all of his clothes, but always seems to have his pants intact.  Seeing this behemoth bounce, jump and create pandemonium of course is the high point of the movie, but trying to legitimize the storyline as pathos only hinders the pacing.  Nick Nolte is effective as Banner's demented Dad and Sam Elliott is his usual cowboy self as Connolly's general father.  Josh Lucas in an uncharacteristically villainous role doesn't have enough screen time or motivation to flesh out his character.  While I found myself entertained for most of the movie, its nebulous ending and psychobabble finish weren't really what I wanted.  HULK pales terribly to the far superior X MEN and SPIDERMAN movies, but it's not the horrible disaster many critics claim.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GPN2VKS8E77C.html">A2GPN2VKS8E77C</a><br/><p>Director Ang Lee ("Sense And Sensibility," [see my review on that film], "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon") takes on one of Marvel Comics' most loved superheroes, the Incredible Hulk. Based on the enormously popular 60's TV show starring Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno, the film, produced by Stan Lee and Avi Arad, deviates from the cliched, but excellent storyline of the original series. Eric Bana ("Troy"; see my review) steps into Mr. Bixby/Ferrigno's iconic role...to middling success. His portrayal of Bruce Banner (David in the original) was well done. Oscar winner Jennifer Connelly ("The Rocketeer," "A Beautiful Mind") does even better as Betty Ross (I hope there was no pun intended on the woman who designed the first American flag), Bruce's long-suffering, ex-girlfriend (a slight extension on her character in "A Beautiful Mind," if you will). I liked HER portrayal THE BEST. If she'd gotten naked, I wouldn't complain (but I guess Universal didn't want to make this into an R-rated picture; our loss). Sam Elliot is equally brilliant as General Ross. Josh Lucas (who's he?) was deliciously venomous as Talbot, a corporate s.o.b who's hell-bent on destroying the Hulk "By any means neccessary." Oscar winner Nick Nolte turns in an ambiguous performance as Bruce's father, who's hiding a deadly secret. The famous line "Don't make me angry; you wouldn't like me when I'm angry," IS in the film; close your ears and you'll miss it.<br /><br />Had I directed this movie, it probably would've been rated R. The ending left me wanting a bit of closure, but it leaves it open for another movie. PLEASE DO A SEQUEL!! Rated PG for some violence.</p></br><a href="../users/ACO20QL72D1E6.html">ACO20QL72D1E6</a><br/><p>This is a mindblower.... some external reviwers have panned that the Hulk got a serious treatment, but to my mind - it`s all for the better:-))) The only letdown is that I do miss TV`s Lou Ferrigno in the titlerole(although he is a trifle old to have played the role, though he DOES make a walk-on in the film as a securuty-guard early on in the film)..<br /><br />The Hulk is unfortunately a bit too unreal, you don`t achieve the sympathy for the character,  Lou`s Hulk received...<br /><br />But all in all; a GREAT movie and a great experience.</p></br><a href="../users/AGI3VJ0I04QO7.html">AGI3VJ0I04QO7</a><br/><p>Few superhero films are done seriously, Unbreakable was, parts<br />(the better parts) of the first X Men film was. But mostly we are served up garbage like Spiderman and Daredevil (shudders). The Hulk of course is a full blown classic comic book hero, done very seriously in a real world setting (like they tried to do with X Men with mixed results). It really works here too. Of cuorse its quite a slow movie but I dont have A.D.D so I can sit through and enjoy the beautiful cinematography as the story slowly unfolds. Needless to say there is a huge payoff at the end with the most amazing CG character I have seen since the first Jurassic Park (and I hate CGI usually) battling it out with the United States Army. I was however a little dissapointed with Eric Bana who has been great in some other movies, but I felt he was a little wooden in this film. Also the final confrontation between Bana and Nolte turned intoa SFX nightmare. The rest of the films look, music and atmosphere were amazing.</p></br><a href="../users/A16KRCLLTHSB5F.html">A16KRCLLTHSB5F</a><br/><p>I wouldn't have seen this movie had it not been playing on a long bus ride back from New York. I had blocked out the movie on the inbound trip with music, but I settled back to watch this, thinking it would provide some solid, if cheap, entertainment.<p>It did, and it didn't.<p>The superhero drama has always been associated (in my mind, and I think in general) with an upbeat, wholesome sort of ethos; everything is reduced to a black-and-white struggle between good and evil, and good almost always triumphs. The 'Spiderman' movie is the perfect example of this. I guess I should have kept in mind that the Hulk has always deviated somewhat from the formula, and this director takes that deviation to the extreme.<p>The plot of the movie is governed by Bruce Banner's father, a psychotic and manipulative scientist who completely surpasses the bounds of 'acceptable' mad science (not the elegant, plot-to-destroy-the-world type, but a total nut job). Banner suffers from a repressed childhood memory involving his father and mother, and its nature, when revealed, is about as unpleasant as you would have imagined. I'm not one to fault a movie for being distrubing - generally, I would enjoy it - but it seems so out of place here, in a movie where the other main atraction is a series of mindless fight scenes in which a giant green CGI-generated man does battle with the US Army. Another fight scene, more on the disturbing side, involves three truly grotesque genetically modified dogs, and it takes the Hulk _forever_ to pummel and beat them into submission. I don't know why I found this so disturbing, but I did. Aside from that incongruity, which I would consider a weakness, there are no really solid performances, and bits of cinemetogrpahic flair like overly-elaborate scene transistions seem completley unnecesary. I can't reccomend it very highly, but it does at least deserve credit for its unexpected angle.</p></br><a href="../users/AK81WLVD5KGUX.html">AK81WLVD5KGUX</a><br/><p>I'm not sure why this movie has taken such a pasting. I think it's a fine screen adaptation of the Stan Lee/Jack Kirby Marvel comic. (But it's not very much like the TV series with Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno, so maybe that's why it's getting such negative reactions.)<p>For comic-book geeks like me who were born in the early 1960s and grew up reading Marvel Comics (waaaaay cooler than DC), the last decade or so has been like a wet dream come true. Finally, the geeks have grown up and figured out ways to make possible _on the screen_ what those writers and artists used to do _on the page_. And filmmakers have already driven the Superman and Batman franchises into the ground, so they're finally getting around to the _good_ comics.<p>Well, it's going to take some doing to beat the X-Men and Spider-Man films, and I don't think this one is _quite_ up to that level. But I can't imagine why any reader of the Hulk comics would find it disappointing.<p>Stan Lee _always_ envisioned the Hulk as a combination of Jekyll/Hyde and Frankenstein. _Both_ of those stories are dark tales of scientific hubris and the horror it can wreak.<p>This screenplay and Ang Lee's direction take this film in precisely that direction (with some nanotech updates), and _of course_ the introductory exposition and development take some time. I don't think it's overlong; I think it's just right. (Granted, if you popped in the DVD just to watch an angry guy turn green, you may be a little impatient. But I don't see that as Ang Lee's fault.) The misuse-of-science theme is nicely sustained throughout the film (Glenn Talbot works for 'Atheon'; hee hee) and there's some genuine suspense as we s-l-o-w-l-y learn what was really happening in all those flashbacks.<p>Eric Bana is right on the money as the tortured and repressed Dr. Bruce Banner; Nick Nolte is pitch-perfect as his brilliant but deranged father David Banner; Jennifer Connelly is Jennifer Connelly; and the rest of the cast are in good form as well.<p>The CGI Hulk is -- no pun intended -- groundbreaking. I suppose if I really wanted to pick nits I could do it, but come on; this is pioneering motion-picture technology, and it's amazingly well done. (Ten years ago this stuff couldn't be done at all, and now we're complaining because some of us can _tell_ it's CGI? As opposed to what? A fifteen-foot-tall green actor?)<p>And real comics fans can have fun spotting the little references to the Marvel series. (Bruce _and_ David Banner? Bruce _Krenzler_? This stuff is nicely handled, if not exactly retconned, in the screenplay.)<p>I'd probably subtract half a star for a couple of slow spots, a little overuse of that comic-bookish splitscreen stuff, and some confusing action at the end. All in all, this film isn't quite as crisp and clear as the excellent X-Men films. But it most definitely partakes of That Ol' Marvel Spirit, and in particular it exemplifies Marvel's trademark ability (also exemplified in the X-Men films) to make the viewer empathize with the 'outcast' under attack from the 'real humans'.<p>If you want Bill Bixby, go watch an old episode of _The Courtship of Eddie's Father_. This is a terrific movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2VUP5US1F5HG5.html">A2VUP5US1F5HG5</a><br/><p>I wanted so bad to like this movie, and in fact was pretty sure I would.  The previews certainly looked good, and with Ang Lee at the helm of a big budget production featuring eye-popping CGI with all the resources of one of Marvel Comics' best series' to draw upon, what could go wrong?<p>Sadly, just about everything.<p>The origin sequence, which appears to be based more on Frankenstein than the Hulk comic book, is convoluted and disorienting.  There are too many flashbacks and throwing Bruce Banner's demented father into the mix was a terrible miscue. The basic gamma bomb origin from the comic is given a conspiracy theory angle that might have worked on the X-Files but flags miserably here and the film never recovers.  <p>The bulk of the film is uneven, slow, and pretentious.  There are too many badly developed but lengthy plot threads all playing out simultaneously--the gamma bomb, the military conspiracy, Bruce's relationship with Betty, Bruce's relationship with his father, Betty's relationship with HER father, the transformation of David Banner into the Absorbing Man--and everything just slowly unravels for an agonizing 138 minutes that actually seems like a lot more. <p>One would expect the action sequences to steal the show and atone for many sins, but in reality there aren't that many action scenes and the ones that we do see aren't always handled well.  A case in point is the Hulk's battle with the mutant dogs.  It's too dark to make out clearly and rather pointless anyway.  The Hulk's run-ins with the Army are much better but are a long time in coming, and the climactic showdown between Hulk and the Absorbing Man is for all its technical pyrotechnics highly unconvincing, with a resolution that is perhaps supposed to be mystical but is instead hopelessly absurd and totally unmoving.  <p>The cast clearly tries hard but has little to work with and the results are decidedly mixed.  Jennifer Connelly is an empathetic and engaging Betty Ross and makes a great damsel in distress, while Sam Elliott nails General Thunderbolt Ross dead-on.  On the other hand, Eric Bana, perhaps because he is shackled by such a disparate script, portrays a rather lifeless and unconvincing Bruce Banner.  Nick Nolte, definitely a talented actor by any measure, mumbles and stumbles his way through the movie as Bruce's maniacal father, David.  The role is an inherently bad one that should have been left out--it wasn't, and Nolte struggles in vain to do anything of value with it.<p>The FX and CGI on the other hand are quite good, and the unaccountably spartan action scenes are if nothing else spectacular, even if they often misfire.  The Hulk himself is a bit of an enigma, which is perhaps as it should be.  Though not especially realistic he is somehow lifelike, and is generally much more sympathetic than Bruce Banner himself.  There is a certain pathos in Hulk's animated features that most of the human actors never match.<p>The biggest problems with this movie are script and direction.  The storytellers tried to do too much and fell short.  The fact that alterations to the details of the comic book were made is not so much the problem as is the overall direction the movie tries to go in.  The decision to make a dark movie was not necessarily a bad one, but the execution is sorely lacking.  Tim Burton's Batman is a dark comic book adaptation as well, but it retains the wonder and fun of its source material.  Ang Lee's Hulk is just downright depressing. A less heavy-handed approach would have worked better.<p>For all that I don't like about this movie, I am glad the end leaves room for a possible sequel.  There is enough good in this effort to potentially build on, so perhaps the creators will learn from their mistakes and give the Hulk the movie he deserves.  Maybe we'll even get to see a CGI Abomination go toe to toe with a revitalized Hulk--what a battle that could be!  Until then, you might want to check out some of the old Bill Bixby and Lou Ferreigno episodes from the classic TV show.  They may look tame compared to the movie, but at least they make sense.</p></br><a href="../users/A1HS9F7J51E9CB.html">A1HS9F7J51E9CB</a><br/><p>Ang Lee's visual pyrotechnics were stupendous.  They would have made a movie on their own.  But the TV/comic strip Hulk was a fairly modest creation.  An ordinary guy grows into a green muscle man when angered. A smaller effort might have been a more intimate, lovable film.  But as it is, this Hulk has an embarrassing amount of baggage.<p>Bruce's (Eric Bana) brilliant scientist father who worked for the military pushed the boundaries of genetics and was banned from his laboratory. A huge explosion occurs and Bruce is left a 4-year-old orphan. Fast forward to Bruce 34, a brilliant scientist, a loner with a beautiful scientist ex-girl friend Betty Ross (Jennifer Connolly--truly lovely).  He has a history of terrible headaches and nightmares.  Coincidence: Betty and her father, 4-star general Ross (Sam Elliott who could have played this role in his sleep) were at the same army base as Bruce when the terrible explosion occurred. Bruce's experiments are being taken over by corporate interests in the slick persona of Talbot (charming villain Josh Lucas). Coincidence #2:  a new janitor arrives at the lab (Nick Nolte who looks and acts positively feral) who is really Bruce's long, lost father. Bruce is taken off his project.  Bruce gets very angry.  Gets large and green.  Destroys lab, and we are off on a worldwide manhunt. <p>The Hulk in all his green glory is too long acoming.  It seems like half the movie is over before he even shows himself. (Unfortunately, this is not true.)  It is a private irritation with me why it seems to be a rule that all these comic book heroes (exception Batman) must be played by bland, banal types with totally unlived in faces?  I think their stressful childhoods or their awesome powers should entitle them to a few character lines or some manly ruggedness.  But no.  They look like uninteresting, passive choirboys.  The movie has many split screens, framing and curious dissolves that I found irritating and distracting.  Also we were treated to both medium and extra-large Hulks which confused me.  Why in one scene was Hulk barely able to restrain three vicious dogs and in another quell an entire army while destroying mountains?  Answer: the madder he got, the bigger and stronger he got.  <p>I thought the best visual trick was making him back into an ordinary mortal before your eyes.  Also, would like to go on record that I liked the ending. It was funny and clever.  Overall, I would recommend seeing this on the big screen if you intend to see it at all.  When Ang Lee is given full rein with his imagery, it is magic.<br />-sweetmolly-Amazon Reviewer</p></br><a href="../users/A1FZA9C5MVIWHE.html">A1FZA9C5MVIWHE</a><br/><p>this movie brung in a lot of green, I bet y'all anything. this is the best movie I bought. no cussing in it and no stupid pop stars in it. Eric Bana plays Bruce Banner, a scientist who becomes the Hulk after a lab accident. he was injected with nanomeds as a young child and then saves the life of a labmate by absorbing gamma radiation himself. Nick Nolte plays David Banner. David becomes a different creature by breathing in the chemicals and then exposing himself to the same gamma rays. later on, he gets electrified and therefore able to mesh with the environment. this is a good movie. why was it not called "The Incredible Hulk" like the TV series of the seventies?</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJPMB7N776WS.html">A1TJPMB7N776WS</a><br/><p>Ang Lee is a superlative filmmaker, responsible for some of the most unforgettable moments, scenes and films of recent memory: "The Ice Storm, "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,"  "Eat Drink Man Woman" and the tender and loving "Sense and Sensibility." All of these films deal with the ultra personal aspects of its characters interior lives and Lee views these things from an emotionally available perspective. He is a humanist and a respectful observer of life.<br />So it was with some surprise when I read that Lee was to direct "The Hulk," yet I knew that his approach to this genre film would be like no other and that his take on the material, though unavoidably cut from the same cloth as "Godzilla" and "Superman," would be unusual. I was not wrong.<br />Lee's humanity suffuses "The Hulk" as the basic storyline deals with the father/child relationship: Bruce Banner (a stalwart Eric Bana), his father David (A wild Nick Nolte) and Betty Ross (an otherworldly, beautiful Jennifer Connolly) and her father Ross (Sam Elliott). Ideally, parents mold and form a child through instruction and example and David literally alters Bruce's life, in a morally suspect scene, by injecting him with toxins thereby setting the course of Bruce's life and the course of the film. David, like Dr. Frankenstein wants to create a super human and thereby control a world that he feels has cast him aside...that won't recognize his genius.<br />"The Hulk" is a physically beautiful film and Lee's mise en scene cannot be faulted even when he uses the split screen to emulate the comic book genesis of the Hulk character. But ultimately "The Hulk" is not a total triumph as the two factions of the film do not quite mesh: Lee's sensibilities and the action necessary to present the physical needs of the Hulk character and the telling of his story even though there are so many gorgeous things here on which to feast the eyes: the scenes of the digital Hulk jumping about the universe that make us forget about his computer origins, the scene with the immense Hulk carrying Betty to safety that recalls King Kong and Fay Wray and Nolte's final scene in which he rages at a cruel, unfair world that brings to mind Lear raging at the sky (I Kid you not...but that's the kind of film this is).<br />"The Hulk" is a strange hybrid: a rapturously personal, monster movie. And Like Frankenstein, Dracula and even Godzilla, one that we will fondly recall in our mind's eye and in the most hidden parts of our heart for the rest of our lives.</p></br><a href="../users/A3CN9CCJUNIPKT.html">A3CN9CCJUNIPKT</a><br/><p>I grew up reading all of the major (and most of the minor) Marvel comics titles of the 1960s and '70s... In the '80s, I drifted away, at first because the various titles had become so static and shoddy, and then later because the artwork had become so stylized and fetishistic.  By the 1990s, Marvel began to radically overhaul all its main titles, and the Hulk was one of the characters that they messed with the most. Because I never liked the hyper-realistic, overly muscular, overly defined artwork that came into vogue around this time, I was driven away from many titles. "The Hulk" in particular, started to have about a zillion rippling muscles that just don't exist outside of a bodybuilder's wet dream.  Still, every few months or so I would pick one up and see what was happening, and for a while I was able to keep up... I gather that around this time was when they introduced the goofy psychoanalitic aspects that define the screenplay of this film: all Hulk's problems stem from a bad relationship to his Daddy. (In the comic, the theme of domestic violence was much stronger and heavy-handed than in this film...)<p>Anyway, as a Marvel loyalist, I've always checked out the various film adaptations, and while Hollywood invariably fouls things up somehow, I have to say, I was more impressed by this film than I thought I would be.  The special effects are fabulous -- I actually watched several of the action scenes over before returning the rental, and if I were still nine years old, I probably would have gone to see this movie in the theatres at least a dozen times. Why they have to muck with the original premises of these stories, I really dunno (the Hulk is no longer the product of an atomic bomb, but rather some sort of genetic testing...) but in general, as these things go, this flick was pretty good.  Mostly I am cheered by seeing such good, exciting special effects, onscreen action that finally matches the sense of wonder that the old Stan Lee-Jack Kirby comics could instill. My hope is that Hollywood will one day start cranking these things out with almost as much regularity as the comicbook industry itself, and as the making of these fantasy films becomes more commonplace, producers will eventually stop feeling the need to "legitimize" then by making the plots so overly complex and drearily serious. Once they find the easygoing rhythm of the original 'Sixties issues, THEN the fun will really start!!</p></br><a href="../users/A1V3IO23FZFF9L.html">A1V3IO23FZFF9L</a><br/><p>The CGI is good, better than how it looks on a TV. The movie is just too serious for a comic book. It seems to lag in some parts and could have been shorter then 2 hours plus. For such a hyped film, it wasnt that good.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IO3LVYV5ZMK8.html">A1IO3LVYV5ZMK8</a><br/><p>When an arthouse director like Ang Lee takes the helm of comic pulp fantasy Hulk popularized by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, you are almost sure of a heavy Freudian psychodrama with sense and sensiblity. One can't help also but to admire Lee's vivid use of split screens and panels, textures and colors to furnish a graphic novel. The gargantuan green creature of angst and amazing flying power is magnificently expressive and menacing as he storms through deserts, wrecking helicopters and fighting mutated beasts. Banner (Eric Bana) undergoes mutation agitated by a gamma-ray explosion with earlier experimenting done by his deranged geneticist of a father (Nick Nolte). Jennifer Connelly is his love-interest who helps to cure Banner of his trauma while her father (Sam Elliot) is the general assigned to destroy Banner. It is a moving essay on the dynamics of father-and-child with charged symmetry from Banner and Betty with their parents. The pace of the thrills also get unnecessarily bogged down in the first hour with its emotional cloud. Hulk fortunately regains its momentum with a special-effects extravaganza and draws exceptional performances from Nolte and Connelly that provides Hulk the movie substance and bulk.</p></br><a href="../users/A38UHOCEKSUOSP.html">A38UHOCEKSUOSP</a><br/><p>It is unfortunate, but Hulk is so far my least favorite of all the comic book movies that have been created.  One would think the Hulk could easily make the list as one of the better comic films, being the popular and dominating comic book creation he is, but director Ang Lee and a lackluster story keep this movie from being incredible, though effects still keep it somewhat enjoyable.<br /><br />I'll be honest, it took a few seperated viewings for me to get through this film, as it is so slow and boring throughout.  There is too much dialouge (and uninteresting speeches) to occupy a film featuring such a massive creature as the Hulk.  Eric Bana, though a wonderful actor, does little with his character of Bruce Banner, making it difficult to understand the true emotions within this man.  When he turns into the Hulk, its really the only part that becomes exciting (and very well should), but at that point we have a CGI creature that doesn't talk, just runs around and wrecks everything (which admittadly, is fun to watch as the visuals effects let loose and show off).  Betty Ross is handled fairly well by Jennifer Connely, but the relation between Bruce and Betty isn't nearly as emotional or exciting as it could be.  Again, most of the interaction was slow and boring, and though I could feel there were some emotional struggles between the two characters, I felt like I had to think about it too much to realise it.  The rest of the cast wasn't anything special either, and overall, acting on everyone's part was below par as far as comic book movies go.<br /><br />The directing is my next issue.  I give credit to Ang Lee for his comic book style of split-screens, picture in picture and so forth.  But the truth is the multiple angles for many of these scenes grow tiresome and distracting from the real action.  Fortunately during the Hulk action scenes in the film, little of this style is used, or esle it would have been impossible to enjoy.<br /><br />So where is the excitment in this film?  It is when Bruce becomes the Hulk.  The creature is massive and an impressive CGI, but to be picky, the closeups of Hulk make him look too smooth and not as rugged and detailed as he could be.  He destroys practically everything he comes incontact with, and can toss military tanks with ease - a truly enjoyable sight to watch.  Also enjoyable are the scenes when Hulk is jumping among the mountains throughout canyons, but at some point you stop and ask yourself "is he jumping or flying".  It becomes a little overdone, but nevertheless, if you have a big screen television it is a sight to enjoy.<br /><br />Overall, this movie is just bad.  I find it very hard to sit through the entire 2 hour 18 minute run.  The 15-20 minutes of non-stop action about 1:30 in the film is all that will keep you awake.  Hulk could have been an impressive film, but so much went wrong as mentioned above.  Thankfully, this summer of '08, a new Hulk film will be released and chances are the same mistakes will not be repeated, thanks to an entirely new crew and cast.  Watch this first Hulk film while you can (if you dare) because chances are it is about to become forgotten for good.<br /><br />Acting - 2.5<br />Action - 4<br />Characters - 1.5<br />Story - 1.5<br />Overall - 2</p></br><a href="../users/A2TLLX0ZBMZTK7.html">A2TLLX0ZBMZTK7</a><br/><p>This movie is a complete waste of time!

Too many recent superhero fantasies have involved by-the-numbers stories dappled with computer-generated graphics.<p> But, man, Ang Lee's &quot;The Hulk&quot; requires way too much heavy lifting for your basic monster movie.<p> In telling the story of Bruce Banner (Eric Bana), a scientist transformed by his experiments into a big green behemoth, Lee gets a lot right. The colors and camera angles and production design neatly evoke the Marvel Comics renderings of Jack Kirby; the blunt, stark dialogue all but floats over the characters' heads in "word balloons"; and an array of split-screens, wipes and dissolves replicate the panels of a comic book, even if they are overused and distracting.<p> The crucial element that's missing, however, is fun. There's not a drop of fun in this long, low movie. There's no sense of adventure or wonder, which is the core of any fantasy. Instead, by filling the plot with lots of half-baked psychology about Bruce's evil dad David (Nick Nolte), Lee and screenwriter James Schamus have transformed "The Hulk" into a bland allegory about bad family ties. If they had injected just a little hope and humor into the story, it might not have mattered that the title character is obviously a digital effect. But they didn't, and "The Hulk" is clearly just an artificial creature.</p></br><a href="../users/AHABFECTNE15I.html">AHABFECTNE15I</a><br/><p>Version: U.S.A / Region A, B, C<br />Format: Blu-ray<br />Aspect ratio: 1.85:1<br />VC-1 BD-50<br />Running time: 2:18:13<br />Movie size: 39,01 GB<br />Disc size: 43,35 GB<br />Average video bit rate: 24.00 Mbps<br /><br />Main Video: VC-1 / 24 Mbps  1080p / 23.976fps / Advanced Profile 3<br />PiP Stream: VC-1 / 617 kbps 480p / 23.976fps /  Advanced Profile 2<br /><br />DTS-HD Master Audio  English  4108 kbps  5.1 / 48kHz / 24-bit / 4108kbps (DTS Core: 5.1 / 48kHz / 24-bit / 1536kbps)<br />DTS Audio  French  768 kbps  5.1 / 48kHz / 24-bit / 768kbps<br />DTS Audio  French  768 kbps  5.1 / 48kHz / 24-bit / 768kbps<br />DTS Audio  German  768 kbps  5.1 / 48kHz / 24-bit / 768kbps<br />DTS Audio  Italian  768 kbps  5.1 / 48kHz / 24-bit / 768kbps<br />DTS Audio  Japanese  768 kbps  5.1 / 48kHz / 24-bit / 768kbps<br />DTS Audio  Spanish  768 kbps  5.1 / 48kHz / 24-bit / 768kbps<br />DTS Audio  Spanish  768 kbps  5.1 / 48kHz / 24-bit / 768kbps<br />Dolby Digital Audio  English  192 kbps  2.0 / 48kHz / 192kbps<br />DTS  English  192 kbps  2.0 / 48kHz / 192kbps<br /><br />Subtitles: English SDH / Chinese / Danish / Dutch / Finnish / German / French / Japanese / Italian / Korean / Norwegian / Portuguese / Spanish / Swedish<br /><br />Number of chapters: 32<br /><br />#U-Control features Picture-in-Picture<br />#Audio commentary with director Ang Lee<br />#Featurette: Evolution of the Hulk<br />#Featurette: The Incredible Ang Lee<br />#The Dog Fight Scene<br />#Deleted Scenes<br />#The Making of The Hulk (16:17)<br />#The Unique Style of Editing the Hulk<br /><br />Format: HD DVD<br />VC-1 HD-30<br />Running time: 2:18:03<br />Movie size: 24,27 GB<br />Disc size: 29,72 GB<br />Average video bit rate: 19.53 Mbps<br />DDPlus 5.1 1536Kbps</p></br><a href="../users/A1HO9J4DCQDGP9.html">A1HO9J4DCQDGP9</a><br/><p>I liked this movie.  I wasn't expecting too, to be honest; it had so much negative criticism that when I watched it on SKY last night I was not expecting anything but a pile of pants.<br /><br />It actually turned out to be quite good, very intelligent for a "super hero" movie and very well acted by all concerned.<br /><br />Okay so it didn't follow the Hulk comic book we all know and love but who cares?  It was a GOOD movie, fun, moving, humorous with spectacular special effects.  I even liked the way Ang Lee sectioned the screens off into blocks so that we could see several perspectives, I thought that was neat and quite clever.<br /><br />The plot was marginally more complex than most but then THIS is an Ang Lee film so with action you get intelligence which is a rare commodity these days and should be savoured like a good quality port if you get my drift?<br /><br />Eric Bana as the scientist Bruce Banner was a good choice of actor, and Nick Nolte was brilliant as the deranged scientist whose mutated genes he passed on to his unsuspecting son during conception.<br /><br />We have the delectable Sam Elliot (even with grey hair!) as the ruthless military man Ross trying to kill the Hulk, his estranged daughter Betty, played by the versatile actress Jennifer Connolly (who is in love with the Hulk's human persona, Eric and of course a baddie in the form of Talbot played by the unknown actor Josh Lucas a somewhat supercilious but ambitious young man who gets bounced around like a rubber ball by a very, very cross Hulk and meats a sticky end in the best comic book tradition.<br /><br />This is a fairly action packed film, with lots of great and fun special effects, the mutated dog fight with the Hulk is great, and a frothing mouthed enraged poodle trying to get at Betty in her car is totally tongue in cheek but very well done.  I also liked the San Francisco scene with the Hulk ripping up the road as he runs UNDER it and the domino effect of the cars he sends hurtling down San Francisco's steep streets, a sweet moment in the film I have to say!<br /><br />And as for all those critics who have complained about how unrealistic this film is, erm, excuse me, this is just a fantasy film and when you are making fantasy come to life on celluloid you can over step the boundaries of physics, just simply because you can!<br /><br />We also get a cameo by the original Hulk Lou Ferrigno who has a walk on part as a security guard; I like the fact that Ang Lee acknowledged the past as well as the future because I remember and still love the original Hulk series, as cheesy and as dated as it is now!<br /><br />All in all Ang Lee did a great job with this film and I don't care what anyone else says, it's worth watching and its worth getting on DVD because the first time around you don't get to see every little gem he has put into this movie.<br /><br />Some movies you have to think about when you watch them others you can watch and forget, with this version of The Hulk you have to think so using your brain cells is a must which I know is REALLY hard for some members of the moving going general public, must be all the "E's" in the butter popcorn they are eating is all I can say.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RKI7RPP5CJMG.html">A2RKI7RPP5CJMG</a><br/><p>&quot;Hulk&quot; was a disappointment.  I hate to say it, but it's true.  This movie had so much potential, but it fell flat from the word go.  The story dragged on for what seemed like a lifetime, and Ang Lee's comic-style editing became annoying after the first few minutes.  The highpoint of the movie is, of course, the Hulk.  If you are blessed with a DVD player, simply skip over the parts that don't include a CGI graphic, and you'll have a good time.  Eric Bana didn't win me over as Bruce Banner, and as much as I enjoy Jennifer Connelly, her Betsy character has the emotion of a stone.  Nick Nolte was also a let-down in this feature.  Sam Elliot was okay, but if you took off his military wear and slapped a cowboy hat on him, you'd think you were watching one of his westerns, which he is so much better in than this creation.<p>The &quot;Hulk&quot; creature was fairly good.  Throughout most of the film, he seems reasonably real-life.  If Ang would've given the CGI monster more screen time, this movie would have been a lot better.  Granted, all he does is smash up things and save a few innocents along the way, but that is so much more interesting than the rest of this story.<p>I'm a big fan of comic book movies, and this is one of my least favorite adaptations.  If Ang Lee would have left out a little more of the &quot;why&quot; Banner ended up as a green crushing machine, and got to the substance of this story, perhaps it would have been a lot better.  Besides, when I think of the Hulk, I think about things getting ripped up and trashed.  This movie, however, spends more time on the woes of child abuse, domestic violence, and genetic testing than our green hero.<p>If you can stay awake through the agonizing dialogue and ever-so-slow pace and actually see CGI Hulk, you may like this movie.  If you're a die-hard Hulk fan, you may like this movie.  But if you don't meet this criteria, please just consider this a rental.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>A B-movie monster flick with an A-movie budget, "Hulk" is the latest epic based on a Marvel Comics superhero to hit the big screen.  Director Ang Lee has constructed the film like a giant jigsaw puzzle, with images and events that often don't make a lot of sense when seen in isolation but which, when pieced together, form an interesting pattern once the overall picture is revealed.<p>Lee and his bevy of screenwriters have opted for a darker approach to their comic book material than, say, the one used for last year's "Spiderman."  The "hero" in this case is Bruce Banner, the conventional "mild-mannered" scientist who doesn't realize that he has been the victim of a genetic experiment that makes him (and his underpants) grow to enormous size whenever he is angered.  Unlike Spiderman, Hulk doesn't go out looking to right wrongs, protect the innocent or bring arch-criminals to justice; he basically spends most of his time trying to escape from the army men out to destroy him before he can wreak too much havoc on the unsuspecting citizenry of the country.<p>Although "Hulk" is long, talky and slow-moving at times, it still boasts a few elements that elevate it above the bland innocuousness of the lighter-than-air "Spiderman."  One of those elements is the relationship between Bruce and his girlfriend, Betty, who seems genuinely conflicted about just how to deal with this suddenly gargantuan beau she has on her hands.  Eric Bana and Jennifer Connelly establish an impressive on-screen rapport that gives the film more depth than it would otherwise have had.  Sam Elliott and Nick Nolte ham it up effectively as the youngsters' fathers, the first as a top military leader bent on containing Hulk's deadly and destructive fits of explosive pique, and the second as Bruce's mad-scientist father whose penchant for playing God 35 years ago served as the catalyst for the unique problems besetting the young Bruce today.<p>As to the film's expensive special effects, they are a decidedly mixed bag, to say the least.  Hulk looks pretty impressive in the facial close-ups, but he often appears ludicrous in long shot, particularly when he is bouncing around from boulder to boulder out in the desert.  It is enough to make one thankful that Steven Spielberg made "E.T." twenty some years ago, long before CGI effects ruled the land.  Otherwise, we might have ended up with an alien far less cuddly, believable and real than the one we fell in love with.  Sometimes "progress" is not always synonymous with "improvement."<p>Lee also relies heavily on the use of split-screen images, a visual style that is sometimes effective in capturing the fragmentation of Bruce's mind, personality and world, and sometimes just plain irritating in its pretentiousness and artifice.  Like virtually everything about "Hulk," the look of the film seems both daring and dorkey at the same time.</p></br><a href="../users/A3O536E2YOKK4Y.html">A3O536E2YOKK4Y</a><br/><p>Director Ang Lee's 2003 "Hulk" is a worthwhile rendition of Marvel's Hulk. Like the '08 version, it has its strengths and weaknesses. Let's look at what works and what doesn't work:<br /><br />WHAT WORKS:<br /><br />- What I'm most impressed with is the serious, intelligent, respectable manner in which the story is presented. There are no goofy, campy elements to be found.<br /><br />- Most of the casting is good: Sam Elliott as General "Thunderbolt" Ross, Jennifer Connelly as Betty Ross and Josh Lucas as Glen Talbot.<br /><br />- Ang Lee shows off his filmmaking skill with various creative editing/framing techniques (supposedly giving the feel of a comic book). I've never seen this type of work in any other film, particularly not to this degree of innovation. It works for me.<br /><br />- I think they did an excellent job with the appearance of the Hulk. Since they were endeavoring to show the REAL Hulk, the one that throws tanks around and jumps across the landscape, they had no choice but to go the CGI route. They did the best they could with the technology available at the time and it holds up a decade later. Hey, it's better than a big body-builder painted green!<br /><br />- Without doubt, the best part of the film is the 22-minute rampage of the Hulk that starts at the 92-minute mark. This IS the Hulk! The enthralling sequence realistically shows the Hulk taking on the military as was often portrayed in the comics. This is definitely one of the best action sequences ever put to film. Make no mistake, the DVD is worth owning for this 22-minute episode alone!<br /><br />WHAT DOESN'T WORK:<br /><br />- The drama is presented in a lazy, convoluted way that somehow detaches the viewer from the film, but I'm okay with it as long as I put on a pot of coffee, lol. This will naturally turn-off Hulk fans who were expecting a fast-paced, simplistic "Hulk will SMASH" story.<br /><br />- Some of the casting is questionable, like Eric Bana as Bruce Banner. Some criticize him as "wooden" but this isn't what I object to as it's the point of the character. Although Bana is certainly likable in the role, and I've gotten used to him, he just doesn't exude Bruce Banner as depicted in the comics or the TV series; he's too much of a handsome muscleman who looks like he could kick some serious arse without turning into the Hulk, which takes away from the whole concept. By contrast, both Bill Bixby and Edward Norton fit the character. Then there's Nick Nolte as Bruce's father, David Banner, the "Absorbing Man." It took me quite a while to get used to his role in this film, but I'm okay with it now.<br /><br />- Some may object to the deviations made to the origin of the hulk and that these changes slow the story down and needlessly complicate it. In the comic Bruce Banner became the Hulk after accidentally being exposed to gamma rays from a huge government test-bomb in the desert. In the film the Hulk's origin is complicated by being tied to Bruce's mad scientist father who experimented on him when he was a little boy. Although one has to allow some latitude in comic-to-film translation these changes definitely slow the story down and make the origin less immediately gratifying. BUT it does offer a father/son conflict to the table.<br /><br />CONCLUSION: The positive aspects noted above make "Hulk" at least a 3/5 Star film. What I like best is the highly mature tone (Roger Ebert called it "a thinking man's superhero film") and the enthralling 22-minute rampage, which is worth the price of admission. But the changes in the origin story slow the film down and are presented in a generally convoluted way that lacks drive. Yet, at the same time, I appreciate the yin/yang extremes of the plot; it makes for a unique viewing experience.<br /><br />In any case, the 22-minute rampage that starts at the 92-minute mark is the Hulk to a 'T' and one of the most entertaining comic-action sequences in the history of film.<br /><br />Despite being based on a comic book (and TV show), "Hulk" is not a fast-food comic flick like, say, the 90's Batman films. This is an intelligent, well-crafted piece of cinematic art that just so happens to involve a rampaging green behemoth. At 138 minutes the film's a bit overlong, but that's okay. Just put on a pot of coffee (you're gonna need it, lol), kick back and enjoy the movie magic. This is what I just did and the film gave me a great time.<br /><br />I value the '03 and '08 versions equally, but I prefer the way the Hulk looks in this version; he's more realistic whereas the Hulk in the '08 version comes off overly cartooney, albeit grittier.<br /><br />GRADE: B+</p></br><a href="../users/A1M9DQDGE07Q0U.html">A1M9DQDGE07Q0U</a><br/><p>&quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; is the big budget, CGI, wasteful remake of the television show starring Lou Ferrigno that, of course, was based on the huge green guy in DC comics.  Here we get none of the television series depth of character development or interesting narrative.  Instead its a CGI festival, practically from the word GO and its dismal, dismal dismal.  One has the experience of being hurled into a none-too-friendly arcade game and with just about as much detachment as watching a box of cornflakes grow mold. Oh well, at least they're both green!<br />TRANSFER: Fairly decent, though the CGI effects look even more artifical than they did on the big screen.  The desaturated color scheme is nicely balanced.  Texture on Mr. Green is accurate in close ups but tends to get a bit soft around the edges as the hulk goes into tearing up things. Blacks are black. Contrast and shadow delineation is effectively rendered. The audio is 5.1 and explosive - did you expect anything less?<br />EXTRAS: They're there but I have to fess up - after a film as bad as this, I just didn't care!<br />BOTTOM LINE: The hulk should have been cast from the ever growing aray of steroid-abusing bodybuilders that tend to resemble him more and more.  Venice Beach is where the producers should start looking for their follow up sequel, not behind the keyboard of a computer geek with dreams of tossing his computer out the window!</p></br><a href="../users/APRZ2IVM8JTLV.html">APRZ2IVM8JTLV</a><br/><p>THE HULK(2003) Directed by Ang Lee. A Universal Picture!!<br /><br /> Starring Eric Bana, Jennifer Connelly, Nick Nolte, Stan Lee, Lou Ferrigno and Sam Elliott.<br /><br /> Through an incredibly complex and lengthy series of events spanning decades, genetic biologist Bruce Banner begins turning into a large green monster at inopportune moments which soon involves his mad scientist mass murdering father, the US Govt., the military and a "evil" corporation which secretly controls the country. Soon much Freudianism, proterrorist and anti-American propaganda, the occasional CGI sequence and a certain degree of smashing ensue.<br /><br /> This is a film that, though very well, if rather desperately and frantically so, directed with several very pleasing moments of excellent comic book style action--particularly during the picture's fourth 30 minute act never truly succeeds due to several serious conceptual flaws and primarily because its director Lee was a bad choice from the outset. It seems fairly clear that Lee was using the film has a trial run for his later grab at Oscar and Politically Correct Hollywood acceptance BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN. The basic concept of both films is that things were great and nifty in the 60s under a Democratic President where evil mad scientist terrorists are easily contained through legal means and sheepherders can rump roast each other with carefree abandon but once a Republican gets in office--in the later film Reagan in this film Bush--things just go to hell. Gays get murdered by evil Americans. Terrorist mad scientists, who now resemble Osama Bin Laden, are released. The Govt. is controlled by evil corporations. Persons are detained indefinitely and can be made to disappear and prisoners are tortured. Both Bush and Condelliza Rice appear as characters apparently complicit in the liberal paranoia. There is a Haliburton style corporation. And the main corporate villain left the military to make money in business--which might sound familiar to Julius Streicher readers--and has a suspiciously large nose. How Lee restrained himself from having said character wear a yarmulke one cannot imagine. Those darn "neocons" are everywhere!! Oh and innocent people turn into large green monsters.<br /><br /> On the face of it, one is surprised that the film was not forced into being a major critical success ala BBM until one realizes that Lee made three fundamental errors. In spite of an unrelenting strictly by the Party line talking point attack on the Bush administration, Lee 1) presents the US military is a fairly positive light valiantly striving to protect the American citizen from death and destruction as well as being reasonably efficient and effective--which, of course, is anathema to the groups Lee was trying to court and 2) placing an a verbal attack on same and the country that could have been delivered with little alteration by anyone from Cindy Sheehan to Ted Kennedy in the mouth of the film's villain--thus rendering it ineffective from a propaganda point of view and finally 3) putting all of the above in a film about a large green monster---which is not really the type of vehicle such forces like to work in. Gay sheepherders are far more appealing to the pseudo sophisticates.<br /><br /> Plus the film just simply has far too much baggage designed to make it acceptable to the parlor pinks. There is all this rubbish going on about the relationship between Banner and his father, Betty Ross and her father General Ross, Bruce and Betty, suppressed emotions and memories and some new age gobbledeegook about reaching one's inner potential. There is nearly an hour of rushed jumping through the hoops exposition before the Hulk (only called by that name once in the film and almost as an afterthought) finally makes his first appearance. The film tends to be a talk fest with the occasional token Hulk appearances to justify the title and presumably keep the great unwashed in their seats for the primary indoctrination sessions. The film runs nearly two hours and thirty minutes when easily an hour could have been snipped.<br /><br /> To be sure, the film does have elements from the book so presumably someone had some familiarity with the character. The aforementioned long fight between the Hulk and the military is spectacular and worth the effort of viewing the film. The sequence set in 1966 is, though a perversion, is from the last page of the original HULK story. Though here instead of a repentant communist destroying a Soviet base with a nuclear explosion, it is an irate American destroying an American one. The Nick Nolte character eventually turns into a, if a rather snobby, version of The Absorbing Man. And the film does use the correct names.<br /><br /> But they are the names only. Bruce Banner--played by the incredibly dull Bana--Betty Ross--played well by Connelly though as the de riquer STRONG INDEPENDENT PERFECT FEMALE--and Glenn Talbot are unrecognizable and might as well be called Bob, Mary and Ted. Nick Nolte's mad scientist character is incoherent. One rarely understands either his motivations or, frequently, just what the heck he is saying. The film also favors and takes elements and lines from the failed HULK TV program of the 70s. So one has a failure imitating a failure. Sam Elliott, though perhaps a tad too calm as General Ross--gives the best performance leading a gravitas to the proceedings whenever he is on screen. The film never has the Hulk speak thus depriving the viewer of the character's great iconic dialogue. The Hulk is also far too large in the film being somewhere around 30 feet tall when the character was usually around 8 to 10 feet in the book. Thus the film comes across as being the first American Japanese giant monster film rather than about the Hulk. There is also the very silly idea that the Hulk, instead of getting stronger as his anger increases, expanding in size like a large green balloon in one case breaking an opponent's jaw by suddenly expanding his shoulder size like sometype of inflatable shoulder pad. Oh and is it really necessary to point out that anyone who detonates a nuclear device on US soil killing Lord knows how many people is NEVER going to be released from jail..even with a Republican in office!!!<br /><br /> This is a film as a primary example of the dangers of letting a so called genius near anything even remotely entertaining. One wishes a "mere" hack had been given the film instead so Lee could go somewhere else to suck up to the Gay Agenda crowd and get his Oscar. The sequel was a far superior effort because it remembered something that Lee forgot a superhero film should be.<br /><br /> Fun.<br /><br /> Truly complexity is the first refuge of scoundrels.<br /><br /> And it could have been all so easy.<br /><br /> Bruce Banner exposed to a Gamma Bomb explosion.<br /><br /> Whenever he is angry or afraid turns into the Incredible Hulk.<br /><br /> And then Hulk smashes.<br /><br /> Hulk is the strongest one there is.<br /><br /> Hulk likes beans.<br /><br /> Very simple.<br /><br /> Instead all we get are the beans.<br /><br /> See it when one has some time to kill.</p></br><a href="../users/AX9J0U8J6XTCY.html">AX9J0U8J6XTCY</a><br/><p>being handicapped, and no longer able to go to the theatre, i purchased this dvd yesterday. based solely on the reputation of director ang lee, i never expected such a brilliant film, with such emotion, deep feelings, a great study in science and biology! i was astounded by the acting, the split camera work to let us see everyone's reactions as to what is taking place around them! the darn desert scene alone was worth more than the price of the dvd by it self! incredible work that has taken a beating by both most critics and theatregoers (here) alike! i blame universal's marketing strategy! this should have been a winter release where a more sophisticated audience would have really gotten into it! i feel, in years to come, ang lee's masterpiece will be a benchmark on how to really make an epic--with brains!  if you have not yet seen it-run out and get it! if you have, watch it again-the 2nd time is even better.</p></br><a href="../users/A13IKSGDYNBNQS.html">A13IKSGDYNBNQS</a><br/><p>I saw this at the cinema when it came out and wasn't particularly impressed. However having picked the DVD cheap, and rewatched the film I have revised my opinion somewhat. This is actually rather clever, and mostly very entertaining, and would have got 3 and 1/2 stars if that was possible.<br /><br />The good things about it are the split screen effects, which recreate the comic book style well, and the story which has a little more depth to it than some comic book films. As for the Hulk himself he is a marvellous creation. For one thing he's much bigger than in the original comics, where he was maybe 7ft tall, in this I'd guess he's more like 20ft tall. Of course this doesn't help with the problem of how his trousers stay on!<br />Strangely for me the CGI effects seem to work better at home than when I saw it in the cinema. Maybe I was just expecting too much at the cinema.<br /><br />On the down side I really only have one criticsm and that is that at 2 hours and 10 mins its a little too long.<br /><br />The extras are pretty good with the Hulk Cam certainly being worth watching, as it gives you an entertaining insight into how the film was made and some of the problems of filming around a main character who doesn't exist.<br /><br />So overall at the right price this is well worth getting.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MNMZMM6BGLTA.html">A2MNMZMM6BGLTA</a><br/><p>I am a Marvel Comics fan. So in some ways I can be too critical of some of their movies but in other ways I think I give them a lot of latitude cause I want to like them. I think Eric Bana is a very good actor and did a good job but I am not sure he was really right for the part of Bruce Banner. Jennifer Conley and Sam Elliot were excellent in their characterizations of Betty and Thunderbolt Ross. Nick Nolte? I didn't like the character of Banners dad, that part of the storyline or Nick Noltes acting in the role.<br /><br />Now to the star of the movie, THE HULK. I thought the CGI was fine. I have heard people say they didn't like it and say The Hulk looked like Shrek. I didn't see it that way. The best part of the movie were the scenes with The Hulk. He was done very well. The scene where he fights the irradiated dogs was both good for action and somewhat funny. I also liked when The Hulk went up against the jets, helicopters and tanks.<br /><br />I also heard people say they thought it took to long to get to The Hulk. I didn't mind cause it built the suspense and told the back story but it was a bit long in getting to the good stuff.</p></br><a href="../users/A3SJSNS9LW981O.html">A3SJSNS9LW981O</a><br/><p>Ang Lee directed this film as if he was impressed with himself, impressed with his split screens and editing, impressed with his "artistry." In this blender of pretention, the Hulk I grew up on manages to peak through.<br /><br />Okay, we do have to creep through scenes of heavy handed angst and repression.<br /><br />Still, once the Hulk breaks out of his clothes, the fun begins!<br /><br />The CGI Hulk is at times totally convincing, at other times plastic looking. Too bad the effects wizards weren't more consistent.<br /><br />There are still plenty of great effects, many "Hulk Smash" scenes, and the soundtrack is incredible!!<br /><br />The concluding battle is too brief,  but at least this movie has more "jaw dropping" moments than the average super-hero film.<br /><br />Jeff Messenger, the author of "the Shroud of Torrington."</p></br><a href="../users/A1Q15TP2FXYYMF.html">A1Q15TP2FXYYMF</a><br/><p>I admit this movie was very dissapointing because in alot of eyes it turned out to be a let down and in some ways it was.<br /><br />My thoughts are it was an excellent film that described the life of Bruce Banner and how he came to hold the gene that would turn him into the Hulk.<br /><br />There was over the course of the movie too much going on at any one time that would distract you from what you were ment to focus on and after that scene would end you would have to repeat the scene because you missed something and in my eyes that isn't good.<br /><br />The only really positive parts of the movie where the special effects & the action scenes. Eric Bana's performance was mediocre at best and in parts of the movie it was very hard to take him as the character seriously.<br /><br />Apparently they are in the process of making a sequel and Eric Bana is even considering taking the part again, they aren't using the same director and to me that's a good thing because the movie had the potential to be the best ever and it wasn't so let's hope the new Hulk movie is better than the first which in my opinion was great anyway.</p></br><a href="../users/A3S98L5B1SR9P1.html">A3S98L5B1SR9P1</a><br/><p>This movie may have had critics raving over it but to me, this movie was horrible. Firstly, a CGI computer animated Hulk who can leap like there is no gravity? What the? Secondly, Eric Bana (the actor who plays Bruce Banner) is looking like a tired kid who's had enough play and is saying "Let me out! I've had enough!" And the truth is, in an Australian interview with the Aussie star, he did claim to dislike working on the Hulk. It's a terrible movie in my opinion. Everything looks so fake due to so much CGI and Eric Bana is in it only because he gets paid so much money.</p></br><a href="../users/A31RM5QU797HPJ.html">A31RM5QU797HPJ</a><br/><p>This movie proves that not all superhero movies are good movies.  Other superhero movies usually something in common with the comic book they were in.  The Hulk does not do this.  Bruce Banner isn't the Hulk because his father did weird stuff to his mother.  And CGI Hulk was questionable.  They just couldn't make a suit that looked a hundred times better than CGI (see "The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen" ).<br /><br />  This is perhaps the worst superhero movie of all time.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NM0RAYSL6PA8.html">A3NM0RAYSL6PA8</a><br/><p>There is something special about Ang Lee's Hulk.  Much of it has to do with his style.  Lee has an almost magical sense of story, wading deeply into the backwaters of the subconscious, drawing out performances that ripple on the surface just enough to reveal the deep storms shifting within.  He is Jungian and Zen at the same time, understanding that placid water often disguises complex harmonies, subcutaneous rhythms.  Lee is, in short, the perfect storyteller for this tale of modern man, of alienation, of repressed anger, of denial of our true natures as mystical, animal creatures and, at the same, time rational beings that are trapped in a world in which neat rules are nothing more than a veneer.  There is a scene at the very end of Hulk in which David Banner tells his son, David, that his essence lies not in the thin shell of humanity, but in the torrential subconscious beneath--the place from which all strength, all righteousness, and all virtue springs.  It is from that powerful place beneath the protective skin of rational thought that one man might find away to save humanity from itself, or destroy everything in trying.<p>One might begin this review by acknowledging that the first half of Hulk might seem a bit slow, the way ordinary life seems slow, turgid, and familiar.  We are drawn into the lives of the characters in a way that current cinematic trends abhor.  Hulk does not begin with action and end with action.  It begins with veiled childhood memories, a story of dysfunctionality told through the eyes of a mysterious man who is both father and reckless scientist.  He is a man who, we learn later, is driven by that greatest of human qualities, and the wellspring of great peril: curiousity.  He is challenging the Heavens, we learn, by trying to improve upon man by unleashing man's essence.  And so, he turns the experiment upon himself, and then passes along the mutated genetics to a child who soon reveals himself as different, almost autistic in his connections to the world, and harboring the first generation of an almost alchemical secret, one which turns human flesh into a power that is almost God-like in its scope.<p>From the mysterious events of his childhood, David Banner, like all of us, lives out the psychic wounds in a failed relationship, in an inability to emote, in a laser-beam like focus on his "work."  He is a modern day "every man" for whom denial and obsession with work mask deep-seated alienation, rage, and denial.  All it takes is a blast of gamma radiation to set the stage for a torrential emotional outburst.  Like the protagonist in Fight Club, this is a man getting in touch with his feral, emotional roots.  And, as might be expected, he likes it.<p>The second half of Hulk is a stunningly efficient, and eminently satisfying, escapist adventure that amply fulfills the promise of the first, introspective hour.  The same kids who sat quietly through the first half will cheer at the amazing feats of strength, daring, courage, and, in two key sequences, compassion and heroism.  This is a real superhero whose strength is a rejection of the venal, and who finds in his rage a deeper humanity and humanism as well.<p>I loved Ang Lee's Hulk.  I plan on seeing it more than once.  It is an engrossing story that actually assumes its audience has a mind as well as a heart, and that puts it leagues ahead of the clodding action movies that have so far led the summer box office.</p></br><a href="../users/AD0J5KK4WQXNS.html">AD0J5KK4WQXNS</a><br/><p>Apart from when the Hulk is on the screen, this film suffers from Eric Banality! and Ang Lee hits a career low in total misdirection. Okay, don't get me wrong, Ang Lee probably said to himself "Okay, this movie is about the Hulk but it is also about family relationships, genetics and all these other things that should make this action film a little better" which is good, but then he goes and directs a version of the Hulk that is anything but action packed at all and it ends up being a really sloppy soap-opera with zero drama or suspense.<p>Eric Bana is usually great but here he delivers a totally flat performance. The story is extremely convoluted and while it tries so hard to be MARVEL, Lee just can not stop himself from playing with the AVID and while he toys with his new montage to make the film look like a comic (great idea but overused!), he forgets to EDIT the film at all. It does not even register as a Superhero movie and starts to move into "Disaster Flick" territory only to be completely confused about itself. At the same time Lee is trying to make the film more adult but misses the connection there and kids will be bored to death with what little he has provided for them in terms of the hulk smashing things up which is what they want to see.<p>Its a film that does not know what it wants to be. In short, another director may have been a better choice and the film screams Edit me! Maybe this is one of the first movies that should receive a new directors cut where the film is actually 30 minutes shorter. Having said that the special effects are very good but there is not enough action sequences to actually make it worth your while.<p>Its no Spiderman by a long shot.</p></br><a href="../users/AWG2O9C42XW5G.html">AWG2O9C42XW5G</a><br/><p>This movie is awesome i just wish the director and writer stuck with the original origins of the hulk.

It just isn't, I can't put it any more simply then that. If that's what you are expecting (or had expected) I can almost guarantee you'd come away disappointed.<br /><br />Ang Lee is an art-house director ('Ice Storm' 'Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon') and that influence very clearly shows here. 'Hulk' is much more a character study of Bruce Banner then it is an action movie. The Hulk as a comic book character was always, quietly, one of the more complex characters in the Marvel universe, as opposed to the rampaging maniac that most people unfamiliar with the comic seem to think he is. Lee's choice to explore the former when most people were actually expecting the latter wound up alienating a great deal of the target audience.<br /><br />That's really a shame too because, although I wasn't a fan of the ending, it's really a terrific movie. The story and plot were really well thought out. The changes that were made to the Hulk's origin made a lot of sense. The performances were all great (Nick Nolte and Sam Elliot really stole the movie). It's just too bad that so many people were, I feel, led to expect something that they, ultimately, weren't going to get.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y.html">A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y</a><br/><p>Eric Bana in The Hulk was pretty good, Of course the cgi and some details were cheesy, I think it was a Good Hulk movie, of course compared to Edward Norton in The Newer Hulk.

I prefer the Newer Hulk Movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GKMQFL05Z79K.html">A3GKMQFL05Z79K</a><br/><p>Despite everyone else not liking Ang Lee's version of The Hulk, I-for one- loved his take on the Green Goliath. Sure, the movie has it's flaws but I've got to give him props for giving us something different than we were expecting. True, he took some liberties with the source material but, overall, it was true to the comic book. Anyone who's read the Hulk comic book will know that General Ross spent alot of his time going after the character in the comic book. Ang was dead-on in picking Eric Bana for the role of Bruce Banner, in my opinion, as he's a dead-on ringer for the comic book Bruce Banner(minus glasses, of course). I give him credit for fleshing out characters and developing the story so we'd understand things alot more as to why Hulk is on the run all the time. This is a comic-book movie in the truest sense of it. If I had any gripes, whatsoever, it would be that there wasn't as much action in the movie as I'd like it to have. Action as in Hulk battling  and generally wreaking havoc. His battle with his father towards the end wasn't much of a battle at all. Other than that, I thought Hulk was a pretty decent movie. People need to quit ragging on this movie so much. It wasn't THAT bad.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZB8B7VQONZA6.html">A2ZB8B7VQONZA6</a><br/><p>HULK<br /><br />People hate this film and honestly I don't know why, seriously I have no clue what the problem is. I will agree that this movie is not a classic but I really feel like every time I see it I have watched a truly entertaining film. I think this film is a lot like the comics or at least a lot like some versions of the comics, and it is really a great story. I think that this film has a lot of heart which is unusual for this type of film, most comic adaptations are action based as were this one seems more character driven. This film was not given the credit it deserved and neither did the cast or crew.<br /><br />Bruce Banner is a young researcher that is not only in love with his fellow co worker but is also drawn to studying gamma radiation. Of course every one knows that an accident happens at the lab that exposes him to those rays and when those rays mesh with the present inside his body that his long lost father left him, well he turns green. From here we have a whole story that involves love, a father who only wants to use his "experiment" I mean son, and the military. All of this put together makes for one interesting film, a lot better then I thought it would be. Plus the battle at the end is cool and that is always a plus.<br /><br />Director Ang Lee who is a wonderful filmmaker did a marvelous job with this film, he turned what could have been just your basic comic movie into a more dramatic tale of tragedy. His direction in this film can be felt all through out the finished product and I really think that he was the perfect choice for this film. Credit of course should also go to writers James Schamus, John Turman, and Michael France who really did something unexpected with this film. This movie is a real emotional based story that relies more on the characters then the action, those three should be complimented for penning this. Frederick Elmes shot this film masterfully and Tim Squyres's editing is flawless, every one should be commended. Eric Bana is completely believable as Bruce Banner and does a real good job with this part, lot of people said this part should have went to some one else. Jennifer Connelly portrays Betty Ross extremely well and I don't think any one would disagree with me on that. Sam Elliott, Josh Lucas, and Cara Buono all are good in this film as well and each of them really make this film all the more entertaining. But it is Nick Nolte in my opinion who really steals the show on this one as Bruce's long lost father who is extremely obsessed with continuing his work. So much so that he doesn't even care about his own son although it seems that he does for a while. In fact it is the dynamic between him and Eric Bana that really make this film, very emotional between these two.<br /><br />Of course not every thing about this film is great, there are a few things that keep this from being a classic. I think the main thing that brings this film down a little in many peoples minds is the length. This is actually a fairly long film that at times feels like it is dragging, so I can understand that. I think because this was more character driven and played on the emotion of the characters a lot it tended to let everything play out a bit slowly. Another thing is that the CGI in this film is not exactly the greatest ever, in fact the Hulk looks more cartoonish at times then intimidating.<br /><br />Still even with those flaws I still think that this was a good movie, much better then most people give it credit for. Who knows maybe because so many others hated it I liked it, but I did.<br /><br />Also this film has some great special features including a nice commentary by Ang Lee</p></br><a href="../users/A3PCTD8QM1BIXI.html">A3PCTD8QM1BIXI</a><br/><p>A lot of the ealry reviews had been complaining about the CGI work in The Hulk and now that movie has come out more people are complaining about how boring the movie is. I'll admit when I first find out they were making a Hulk movie I had my resverastions as soon as I found out there would no classic Marvel villain other than General Ross in the film, I would have loved to see Charles Dance or Alan Ruck play The Leader. So on opening day I mainly went to see the movie to see what Mr. Ang Lee could do with the direction and I was impressed. Lee's editing and split screen transations and wipes give the film a real comic book affect which is why the film impressed me so much. Eric Bana whose carrer I haven't really followed does well as Bruce Banner as do the always good Jennifer Connely and Sam Eillot. I think in the acting department though the film belongs to Nick Nolte as Bruce's father. I don't really see the film as a comic book movie for the fan boy but more of a thinking person's action movie which is a rarity this summer. I give the film *** stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A5TZXWU8AALIC.html">A5TZXWU8AALIC</a><br/><p>I remember when I went to see the American version of GODZILLA back in the 90's.  The one with Matthew Broderick.  What a mess.  I asked my friends, "How on earth can you screw up making a Godzilla movie?"<br /><br />But they did.<br /><br />I was asking the same question when I saw THE HULK.  But the answer came a little easier: the filmmakers wanted to make MORE of the story than there was.  Get into the Hulk's inner child and psychology.  Blah, blah, psycho-blah.<br /><br />We want to see the Hulk throw more tanks.<br /><br />We want to see him foil villians who try to use him for their own nefarious purposes.<br /><br />You've got hundreds of comic books and dozens of TV shows to cobble a cool plot from.<br /><br />You blew it.<br /><br />And...that...just...makes me...ANGRY!<br /><br />You killed a movie franchise faster than Joel Schummacher.</p></br></body></html>

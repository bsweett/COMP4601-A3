An Ebola-like outbreak erupted in a small rural town which resulted in transforming the infected persons into a vicious belligerent killers.  The rumors quickly spread that hunters located  a sunken airplane where the source of the infection seems to have spread. The signs of the disease spread quickly, got the attention of the local Sheriff with the sudden increase in criminal activities of unexpected transformation of individuals.<br /><br />On the other side of society, the government had already determined to exterminate the whole infected population in order to spare the rest from the spread of the deadly virus. Unbeknown to the local Sheriff, who was occupied by deciphering the local crimes, the National Guard was dispatched to seal the town, quarantine the infected population, and destroy all moving escapees. Within the quarantined population, the infected ones turned against the living individuals and reeked havoc, death, and terror within the isolated and sealed zone.<br /><br />The vast might of the state enabled it to track all moving escapees by airborne robotics and tightly control the spread of individuals. The whole town must die, either from the leaked deadly virus or the inflicted victims whose belligerence was caused by the infection.<br /><br />The movie embodies the fears of many people of the uncontrolled and poorly scrutinized government biological research. As some who believe that AIDS was an experimental virus that was designed to eradicate homosexuals and blacks, the movie displays the struggle between the mighty and the almighty.  The Sheriff of the town, whose wife was a doctor, was the last to know about his government's plot to exterminate his own town, including him and his family.<br /><br />The First Amendment of the Constitution that secures the peoples' right to carry arms was defeated by the overwhelming might of the state compared to the small, isolated fire arms that lacks the organization and vast resources of the state. Or, one might wish to believe that the escape of the Sheriff and his wife was made possible by their access to fire arms.<br /><br />Like many science fiction movies that succeeded in predicting the future course of society, The Crazies contributes to the pools of thoughts on that trend. It was bloody, frightening, and gloomy, from start to end.  In the real word, the Anthrax deliberate leak from the governmental laboratories followed the same train of thoughts of this movie, despite of being an isolated act of a deranged man.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>I never saw George A. Romero's original film, but from the reviews I've read, this remake is even better in the eyes of many.<br /><br />Basically, half the inhabitants of a small town, with a population of 1,260, start killing off family members and neighbors. It's hard to describe what happens next without giving anything away, so I'll just comment on the other aspects. It reminded me a little of 28 Days Later, mainly in the fact that the people are not zombies. They are infected by a kind of virus and have turned murderous because of it. There are quite a few scenes that are genuinely creepy and more than a few of those cheesy jump scares, but thankfully The Crazies stays grounded in reality, making the impact of what's going on that much more intense. There are a couple of instances where I was thinking that some of the people were idiots for doing things I wouldn't dream of in such a situation, but hey, it's a horror movie. The pacing drags slightly at times, but they were sure to put just enough surprises around the corner to keep your interest. The acting is what you would expect. Not grand, but not weak by any means. Timothy Olyphant and Radha Mitchell carry most of the burden and do enough to make you care what happens to them by the end. The gore level is strong, just not the splatterfest level that you might expect.<br /><br />The Crazies is not one you have to rush out and see, but it's well worth your time when it hits DVD. I happen to agree with most critics in this case, because it's definitely one of the smarter horror remakes I've seen.<br /><br />3 and 1/2 out of 5 stars</p></br><a href="../users/A3APW42N5MRVWT.html">A3APW42N5MRVWT</a><br/><p>A well made but rather routine paranoid horror movie. Nothing new to see here, but a very good paint-by-numbers product.</p></br><a href="../users/A1I7QGUDP043DG.html">A1I7QGUDP043DG</a><br/><p>I prefer more suspense than blood so I enjoyed this horror/thriller. The plot is believable and has a deeper layer than just a zombie style movie. After a military plane crashes into an isolated lake, a toxin developed by the government finds its way into the water system of a peaceful little town. Once the residents of Ogden Marsh start going 'crazy', it is difficult to know who is friend or foe. Sheriff Dutton (Timothy Olyphant of 'Deadwood'), must find a way out of the town with his pregnant wife before the government decides to clean up their problem the quickest way possible, through deadly force. A fast paced story with a lot of 'nail biting' moments.</p></br><a href="../users/A3TYC8T6W81DDB.html">A3TYC8T6W81DDB</a><br/><p>When I first saw the original George Romero  film The Crazies a few years ago, my first thought after it was over was that it was a pretty great concept that wasn't executed the right way. That's actually my only memory regarding the original film since it wasn't very memorable and not even up to par with Romero's mediocre  films. Before news hit that the film was being remade, the thought crossed my mind that a remake could certainly benefit this film. Lo and behold, the film has been remade and is in theaters now.<br /><br />The 2010 remake of The Crazies can be considered an upgrade from the original film. Is it an original concept? No, not really. But when dealing with a remake, aiming for an original concept is kind of silly since it was already done at least once in the original film it's based off of. The Crazies actually felt a lot like if 28 Weeks Later and The Hills Have Eyes (2006) were blended together to make one film. The military being heavily involved and trying to contain the outbreak is what made me think of 28 Weeks Later. The "crazies" themselves and the ending were reminiscent to the last scene at the end of The Hills Have Eyes. Actually, Neil Marshall's Doomsday comes to mind as well. The car wash scene instantly made me think of last year's The Final Destination, which I absolutely hated. Luckily, this car wash was a bit more exciting and the payoff was more satisfying. I hate doing comparisons to other films while thinking of this one, but that was one of the things that irked me about the film. It seemed like most things that occurred throughout the duration of the film were reminiscent of others. Most films do that, but usually have a few distinguishing scenes of their own. A remake, if done properly, should remind you of the original film while introducing a few new elements that stand alone. Originality goes a long way in this medium these days.<br /><br />The pitchfork scene is the main reason to see this film. I've always wondered why pitchforks haven't been used more often in horror films. The movie poster is a huge tease to that scene and it is easily the highlight. Timothy Olyphant in the lead role is another good reason to see this. Olyphant seems to be the type of actor that is skilled enough to get bigger roles, but either picks the wrong parts or is looked over by the studios. He at least had the opportunity to shine in last year's A Perfect Getaway and again here.<br /><br />While The Crazies is an improvement over the original film, it still seems to be lacking something to make it more memorable and is a bit too predictable. There are quite a few interesting kills (the way the lighter comes into play isn't too shabby) and the make-up and CG effects are more than satisfactory, but it often felt like the film burrowed ideas from other horrors and thrillers from the past few years rather than providing something a bit more creative. The Crazies falls a bit flat overall, but is still worth checking out if you're a die hard horror fan.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>The Crazies (Breck Eisner, 2010)<br /><br />I am starting to wonder whether it is possible to effectively remake a seventies horror movie today. The problem I'm having with the idea turns on the cultural mindset of America. While I would hesitate to call what we have now "conservative"--let's call it "neocon" instead--there's no denying that the cultural mindset of the seventies was (well, let's not go with "liberal", but say instead "progressive") vastly different than what we have now. That cultural mindset deeply informed such films as The Last House on the Left, The Hills Have Eyes, and The Crazies. We have had remakes of all three recently, and they have varied in their effectiveness, but when you compare the remakes to the originals, there is always a fundamental shift in tone. It is most prominent in The Hills Have Eyes, where the main character has been turned from a geeky wimp with a Sonny Bono mustache whom no one had ever heard of  (Martin Speer, a very good TV actor in one of his few big screen roles; he dropped out of sight entirely in the early nineties) to Aaron Stanford, a guy who's geeky wimpiness at the beginning of the movie is only conveyed to us by his father-in-law calling him (with undisguised contempt) a democrat. When the fur hits the pavement, though, he turns into your typical "rah rah NRA" kinda guy without much trouble. What I'm getting at is that the horror films of the seventies, and these three in particular, may not have taken incisive looks at questions of greater significance, but at least they knew to pose those questions and chew 'em around a little. (One could, of course, tack almost any seventies horror movie with a recent remake onto this, from The Texas Chain Saw Massacre to Dawn of the Dead.) The recent remakes, on the other hand, are content not to question, but simply to reflect. And so we come to the case of The Crazies, the movie whose sole purpose is to resuscitate Breck Eisner's reputation after the horrorshow that was Sahara, one of Hollywood's all-time greatest flops.<br /><br />The movie concerns a small Iowa town where something gets into the water supply and turns the inhabitants into a bunch of, well, crazies. (While they're not zombies, you know Eisner has seen every recent fast-zombie movie, and plays them all to effect here; be warned.) Standing against the not-zombie invasion are the town sheriff (Deadwood's Timothy Olyphant); his wife, the town doctor (Pitch Black's Radha Mitchell); his deputy (Love Happens' Joe Anderson); and her secretary/assistant/something we never really understand (Danielle Panabaker of the recent Friday the 13th remake). They're not exactly handling it well. Enter the military, and if you thought everything was going wrong before...<br /><br />While the military angle existed in the original Romero film, it is an entirely different beast here than it was there. The military are depicted as nothing more than goons, monolithic, indestructible, and for the most part faceless. (We see only two military folks' faces in the film. One is a drone, and the other some sort of high-level functionary, or possibly consultant.) While I'm not entirely sure that sort of thing plays in a time when The Hurt Locker takes Best Picture (which happened about nine hours after I saw this movie), Scott Kosar and Ray Wright, who loosely adapted Romero's 1973 script, are at least willing to give you enough ambiguity in one major scene to leave themselves an out. In any case, it's all very black-and-white; you've got the evil military and you've got the good guys, the local forces. Okay, I take back what I said before; that really is conservative, as opposed to neocon (where the military would have been flag-waving victors who were there to actually help). It's all also very cookie-cutter; you should see the ending coming a mile off if you've seen two or three flicks like this, or read a handful of zombie novels. Or, for that matter, Romero's zombie movies, though he's never been nearly that explicit about it.<br /><br />As for the acting, well. Timothy Olyphant is a very, very good actor who makes very, very bad casting choices; in the past ten years, he's been involved in such ridiculous movies as Stop-Loss, Hitman, Live Free or Die Hard, The Girl Next Door (the Playboy Bunny flick, not the Sylvia Likens movie), Dreamcatcher, A Man Apart, and the Gone in Sixty Seconds remake. This is a better movie than any of those, but he still seems to do better on the small screen than the big (Deadwood and Damages have both been multiple Emmy winners over their runs). Mitchell, on the other hand, is a very, very good actress who makes excellent casting choices and then has the public ignore her movies. Even her foray into the world of Woody Allen, Melinda and Melinda, is probably Allen's least-known venture of the past decade. While she's gotten small roles in movies that got some notice (Finding Neverland, Phone Booth), when she's the marquee name, no one notices (both Pitch Black and Silent Hill were far better films than their gross would suggest, and has anyone in America but me actually seen Visitors, a phenomenal little thriller?). This could be the movie that changes that, since its critical reception has been generally positive. Anderson and Panabaker are not as experienced as the top-billed actors, and it shows. But their characters are both well-acted and likeable, if somewhat overwrought now and again.<br /><br />The hinge for my rating, though, is that The Crazies, which was the tail end of Romero's trilogy of "worst films ever" (the other two, Jack's Wife and There's Always Vanilla, have faded into blessed obscurity in the forty years since their release; they're not at all worth hunting down, no matter how big a Romero fan you are), is kind of like an unmolded lump of modeling clay. It's got a few memorable scenes, but overall, if you were to put together a list of the five worst movies George Romero had ever directed, The Crazies would be on it. (Granted, it would be #5.) It's not classic Romero by any means. Had Eisner tried to remake a Romero movie that was actually good, he probably would have faced the same ire Tom Savini did in 1990, Zack Snyder did in 2004, and Steve Miner did in 2008 (the three directors who remade the original Dead trilogy). Instead, he adapted a minor work, he sharpened it up a bit, and he got a solid stable of actors. This is still a minor film, but it's a pretty good one. Eisner's reputation should lose some of the post-Sahara tarnish. ***</p></br><a href="../users/A2UQIIJ2CD8REE.html">A2UQIIJ2CD8REE</a><br/><p>When seemingly random citizens of an Iowa farming community begin to go violently insane, the local sheriff, his wife, deputy, and a teenage friend attempt to escape the ensuing highly suspicious government quarantine. However, they soon find the disease is as hard to outrun as the soldiers, not to mention the murderous "crazies" that are around every corner.<br /><br />Breck Eisner's 2010 remake of George A. Romero's 1973 cult classic, also entitled "The Crazies", is a great example of how not all remakes are a bad thing. While there still is something I find a bit creepier about the insanity Romero's characters depict, Eisner's more sick-looking, yet generally more dangerous crazies are much more threatening. Granted, they take some edge off the military as the villainous focus in this newer version, but not completely. The "powers that be" are still the most dangerous heavy in the long run, and their presence and threat is constantly felt right up to the end. It's a highly exciting, suspenseful survival/action/horror flick, and for the most part a vast improvement on the original film. Starring Timothy Olyphant, Radha Mitchell, Joe Anderson, and the goddess Danielle Panabaker (I practically worship both her and her sister), "The Crazies" is a fantastic ride that maintains the bleak themes of Romero's original, but with a more engrossing narrative and fantastic visuals. Definitely one to own if you appreciate the genre or themes portrayed.<br /><br />The DVD is loaded with bonus features too. There is a director commentary that is highly informative, though perhaps too focused on the technical stuff (would have liked to hear the "how we did it" on the knife/hand scene though), some behind the scenes featurettes (including one on Romero's legacy of political statement horror, but sadly only using clips from the public domain "Night of the Living Dead"), a still gallery, trailers, and even two motion comics that give the untold infection stories of two crazies from the film. It lacks deleted scenes, but I'll still give a solid "A" for this nicely stocked DVD release of an excellent new entry into the horror-remake subgenre.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZB8B7VQONZA6.html">A2ZB8B7VQONZA6</a><br/><p>THE CRAZIES<br /><br />George Romero is by far a legend in the film industry and has crafted some of the best movies of all time, there is no doubting that. While he is still a very active filmmaker his past films have been being remade with more to come I am sure. One of those films is "The Crazies" a remake that he actually supported and came on board as an executive producer. I always have hope for a remake when the original creator is involved or signs off on it, from the films of his that have been remade this ranks as one of the best. Still the film is not perfect and falls short of classic status, not to say it is not a good movie, it is.<br /><br />We find ourselves in a small American town in Iowa I believe following the life of the town sheriff David Dutten and our day is starting off wrong. During a baseball game that the whole town seems to be at a man looking he is drunk, but something is off, not to mention he I wielding a shotgun. When Sheriff Dutten confronts him the man raises the gun and forces the Sheriff to shoot  him, killing him in the process. This is just the first of many strange things happening in the town, things like the town drunk. People start to act really weird with homicidal tendencies and such, like a farmer wanting to bun his family alive. Just when things seem like the can't be any worse then your neighbors wanting to kill you the government steps in to quarantine the town. Just like them to make your day worse or at least in the film, if it was me I am not sure, I guess they were doing the right thing for the rest of the world.<br /><br />Director Breck Eisner does a good job of moving things along and really does not make more out of what the film is, a good survival flick. The film follows the Sheriff, his wife, his deputy, and a few others, basically your core group of bodies to kill off one by one. But even your simple group of people need to make it here by this time to survive film can be fun with good acting. This is were the film is strongest for the most part, our lead in Sheriff Dutten is played by Timothy Olyphant. He does a good job in this film making it very believable as does Radha Mitchell playing his wife. Now to make it short I will say every one in this film did a good job and was very believable, but it was Joe Anderson that was the show stealer. Joe played the deputy in this film and in my opinion gave the best performance, and the most fun.<br /><br />Speaking of fun you know I love the gore and such in this film, always fun to see blood pouring out every where in a good flick. Also I must say that if you are expecting a zombie movie you will be disappointed. Although these people are similar to the undead they are still very much alive, they are just infected. It seems something leaked into the water and is causing people to resort to animal like behavior, wanting to eat and kill. So just know from the jump these people are infected and undead, zombie like but not a zombie night.<br /><br />The great DVD release features some fun behind the scenes and making of features, including a look at Mr. Romero, also there is a great audio commentary.</p></br><a href="../users/A20DZX38KRBIT8.html">A20DZX38KRBIT8</a><br/><p>Not as good or as powerful as Romero's classic but still delivers a scary thrill ride.  The story develops nicly, most hardcore Romero's fans like myself already know the plot but it did play out well.  The violent scenes are dont well, the acting was great, the scenery is great which I belive always plays a great role in developing atmosphere in these types of films.  Overall I liked this film alot, but as always it could have been alot better if they had gotten the army more involved like in the origional.  Great flick overall in it's own right.</p></br><a href="../users/A3CL82UITQJLWS.html">A3CL82UITQJLWS</a><br/><p>Eh, it was ok.

Breck Eisner's remake of George Romero's 1973 gem The Crazies is just that, which trades Romero's brand of chaotic paranoia for some honest-to-God thrills.  Timothy Olyphant stars as the local sheriff, who along with his doctor wife (Radha Mitchell) try to survive when the citizens of their small town become homicidal maniacs, as well as the subsequent quarantine by the military.  The Crazies doesn't feature anything that any horror fan hasn't seen plenty of times before, but it features some genuine thrills and chills, solid performances from Olyphant and Mitchell, and a decent amount of political commentary to get its point across.  It doesn't have the same kind of effect of leaving the viewer with a great deal of unease like Romero's original film did, but for what it's worth, this remake of The Crazies is a surprisingly worthwhile endeavor regardless.</p></br><a href="../users/A21B2TJBWCSK1R.html">A21B2TJBWCSK1R</a><br/><p>There is an audio commentary by director Breck Eisner who, rather appropriately, starts off talking about how he got involved in the project. He wanted the film's focus to be on the townsfolk, specifically David and Judy Dutton. He admits that initially he did not want to remake a Romero film but after watching the original again felt that he could increase the scale of it and update the premise to reflect contemporary issues. Eisner touches upon various aspects, including casting and locations, while also eloquently analyzing the film's themes.<br /><br />"Behind the Scenes with Breck Eisner" is a pretty standard if not well-made making of featurette that mixes interview soundbites with clips from the film. Eisner points out that an early version of the script he read had more of a balance between depicting the townsfolk and the military but he wanted to focus more on the town with an emphasis on horror rather than action.<br /><br />"Paranormal Pandemics" takes a look at how the filmmaker designed the infected. The original design looked too much like zombies and so they went for a more vein-y look. We see actors getting fantastic-looking makeup applied. Eisner explains the three stages of infection and expanded on Romero's original concept. They based the makeup on actual infections to give an added realism to the film.<br /><br />"The George A. Romero Template" features filmmakers like Phantasm auteur Don Coscarelli and pundits from various horror film websites singing the praises of Romero's films and how influential they are. Naturally, they talk about the original <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008WJDA">The Crazies</a> film and its relevance now.<br /><br />"Make-Up Mastermind: Rob Hall in Action" goes into more detail about how they created the infected makeup. It's pretty cool to see how they do it and how realistic it looks.<br /><br />"The Crazies Motion Comic Episodes 1 & 2" features simplistic animated comic book art providing the backstory to the events depicted in the film.<br /><br />"Visual Effects in Motion" takes a look at a few sequences before CGI was added and how, by stages, they achieved the end result. It is interesting to see how much a given sequence is enhanced by CGI.<br /><br />Also included are a teaser and two theatrical trailers.<br /><br />Finally, there is a "Behind the Scenes Photo Gallery" featuring shots of the cast and crew at work.</p></br><a href="../users/A3QNQQKJTL76H0.html">A3QNQQKJTL76H0</a><br/><p>Not having seen the 1973 original, I can only comment on this remake in relation to other recent works in the survival horror genre. To give credit where credit is due, George A. Romero is widely regarded as the father of the zombie genre and the original (and little-known) Crazies was probably fresh for its time. This version of The Crazies comes nearly 40 years later and definitely doesn't bring anything new to the now-crowded zombie buffet table. It is sticks to an old formula and delivers some solid thrills, without any surprises or deviations from the well-worn path set by other zombie movies. If you've seen the Resident Evil films, 28 Days Later, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AR0D4A">The Mist (Two-Disc Collector's Edition) [Blu-ray</a>] or played any of the games in the Resident Evil series or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F3AADE">Dead Rising</a> (inspired by Romero), you'll already be familiar with this film's premise: unnatural disaster strikes small-town America. A plane carrying a deadly cargo crashes in the woods, releasing toxins into the water supply of a small Iowa town. Instead of Raccoon City with the T-virus, it's Ogden Marsh with another virus. Different names, same results. People get infected and the military comes in to contain the infection.<br /><br />What follows is a relatively straight-forward zombie survival flick as the three main characters try to flee the town while evading the military. The survivors are Sheriff David Dutton, his deputy Russell, and David's wife Judy. Structurally, the film is very similar to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JPUN">The Invasion</a>, another remake, and a bit like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001DZOC3W">The Happening</a>. People start off exhibiting emotionless vacant stares then become crazy and go about killing others. There is a lot of graphic violence, blood, and gore in this film, including trucks, morgues, and meat lockers full of corpses, but viewers used to zombie video games or the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006SSOHC">Saw</a> series will be in familiar territory.<br /><br />All the townsfolk are pretty much disposable, without much character development. We don't get any depth to them, so it's easy to see them zombified and dispatched. The military, likewise, is also a nameless, faceless group that's just another enemy in the film to run away from. The origin and purpose of the government virus remains a mystery, and the ending quite obviously points to a sequel.<br /><br />At 90 minutes, it is short, inconsequential, throw-away entertainment that doesn't ask too much of audiences. While Timothy Olyphant turns in a good performance as the sheriff, I didn't feel like I gained or lost anything from watching this film. There are a few cheap tricks like sudden loud music and pop-outs, but for the most part, the scares are honest. Overall, a solid zombie movie that will entertain if this is how you're looking to spend movie night.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KIQ4P4ZW3ALF.html">A1KIQ4P4ZW3ALF</a><br/><p>Positive: It did have a nice flow to it with good control over the increasing tension as the virus type organism went through it's infectious protocol however predictable it was going to be.<br />Negatives:<br />(1.) The horror consisted of the usual sharp object though body; usual closeup gun shot appliances; typical "buy at any costume & display" Halloween supply store type appliances for zombie style facial changes.<br />(2.) Louisiana bayou swamps don't belong in Iowa. Fire pots in the streets, broken glass and a few turned-over cars with trunk/hood lids up to represent looting and chaos is cheap and really really old. Tall chain link fences used by the military to control a hundred people in a confined area just doesn't work anymore and wouldn't work anyway (my rabbit could push it over). Another cutesy ambiguous ending following the usual atomic bomb dropped on city visual.<br />(3.) Overall not very creative especially when relying on a medical text for concepts and visuals of infectious diseases.<br />(4.)

Even the movies he's made that I'm not particularly fond of I've enjoyed for the originality if nothing else. Add to that the fact that this man has made movies outside of the mainstream of mass manufactured Hollywood and how can you not like him? So I was kind of worried when I heard they were going to remake his 1973 film THE CRAZIES. The fear was unwarranted.<br /><br />The movie takes place in a small Midwestern town in Iowa where life is like a Norman Rockwell painting. People know one another, festivals are planned and everyone in town is gathered at the baseball diamond for the local high school match, including Sheriff David Dutton (Timothy Olyphant). So what's the town to think when a local man wanders out onto the field carrying a shotgun and refusing to step down when the Sheriff orders him to drop his weapon? After leveling the gun at the crowd, he has no option left but to shoot the man.<br /><br />This leaves Dutton wondering what ever possessed this man to act the way he did. But it doesn't stop there. That night another regular town's person terrorizes his family. Locking them inside a closet, he pours gasoline all over and lights the place ablaze. Taken in to custody, the questions keep coming...what's wrong with these people?<br /><br />A little investigating on the part of Dutton and his deputy leads them to a swamp where a few poachers came across a body in a parachute hanging from a tree. Looking further into the swamp, Dutton and his group come across a large airplane sunk beneath the surface of the water and no clue as to where it came from or how it got here.<br /><br />Things go from bad to worse as more outbreaks of strange, violent behavior happen. Cars are wrecked up and down the street and folks are killing one another for no apparent reason. Dutton, his wife and the town doctor Judy (Radha Mitchell), Deputy Russell (Joe Anderson) and nurse Becca (Danielle Panabaker) attempt to leave town only to be apprehended by the military.<br /><br />It turns out that on board the plane was a toxic agent, code name Trixie (a reference to the original film), that would create mass madness if released. The contagion seeped into the town's water supply and everyone who had something to drink was infected. Now the military is sorting out who is and who isn't infected with nothing else to do but kill those who are.<br /><br />An escape ensues and the foursome head out to escape not just the military but the by now infected zombie like people they once knew as friends. But the military doesn't want to risk the chance of the outbreak spreading and a hunt for the fugitives follows.<br /><br />This movie offers a few scares that few seem to do these days. It doesn't really on gross out gore, though it features some, but more on the whole "what if..." scenario posed by the main idea. What would you do if your neighbors, people you had been friends with for years or even family members suddenly decided you'd be better off dead? How would you react to these attacks? And what would you do if the government was involved in not solving the problem without resorting to incredible violence?<br /><br />The horror in this story involves people and humanity.  Knowing that people you care for are now something they weren't and yet still having deep rooted emotions for them makes for some powerful thoughts when it comes to deciding what to do.<br /><br />The film offers some well done special effects that don't always go over the top but that should be enough to keep gore hounds happy and average viewers revolted but not too turned off to the story. The acting is top of the line and Olyphant is fast becoming an actor that we're bound to see more of.<br /><br />One of the good things about a remake that works is that it makes viewers who might not been aware of the original source material seek it out. In this case both movies would offer an evenings entertainment for whatever price paid. This movie is one of those rare films, a remake that not only pays homage to its source material, but an enjoyable movie in its own right.</p></br><a href="../users/A3CN9CCJUNIPKT.html">A3CN9CCJUNIPKT</a><br/><p>"The Crazies" (Overture, 2010)<br />-------------------------------<br />NOTE: Spoilers below<br />-------------------------------<br />While it might seem like "just another" zombie/pandemic horror film, this 2010 thriller is actually a remake of George Romero's 1973 film, "Crazies," which was -- like his classic "Night Of The Living Dead" -- a trailblazer in the genre.  Here's what happens: a small town in rural Pennsylvania is beset by a mysterious illness that transforms good, normal cornfed Americans into mindless psychotic killers. Turns out it's a side effect of a secret government project gone wrong, and the Army is of course called in to clean up the mess. So this is in effect a three-sided horror film: the uninfected survivors have to contend with both their crazy-killer former neighbors and with a ruthless military operation which has issued kill-on-sight orders for all humans inside the quarantine area. Of course, this doesn't sit too well with the local sheriff (played by the charismatic Timothy Olyphant) or his loyal, capable deputy, who try to escape the worst of all possible situations.<br /><br />In some ways this stylish, methodical modern film can be seen as an adjunct to the original, and not simply a remake: the action is less concerned with the government's point of view -- less of the crazies attacking the soldiers, and more about the soldiers exterminating the locals. Olyphant is good, but mostly its the narrative that keeps this movie moving along at a fast clip. If you go for this sort of film, this is definitely worth checking out.

Romero's semi-classic "The Crazies."  Kosar and Wright updated the screenplay, moved it to a new location (Ogden Marsh, Iowa) and generally maintained the essence of the original film.  Director Eisner keeps the film interesting by mixing equal parts of suspense and action with brief quiet moments between the primary characters.<br /><br />The film starts at a baseball game in the heartland of America.  During the game, Sheriff Dutton (Timothy Olyphant) has a tense encounter with a local named Rory Hamill, who pulls a gun on Dutton and the sheriff is forced to shoot him.<br /><br />While at home with his pregnant wife, Judy (Radha Mitchell), Dutton considers the shooting death of Hamill.  Judy consoles him and he eventually goes to bed.  He's awakened early the next day by the fire department when they tell him another resident has set his own home on fire with his family in it.  More bizarre events begin to occur as the day wears on.  Some citizens begin to "zone out" while others begin to act out violently.<br /><br />After a bit of investigating, the sheriff demands that the towns water supply be shut off.  Then the military shows up and begins to lock down the entire area.  Citizens are divided into two classes:  those who show signs of the virus driving people insane and those who appear to be fine.  The townspeople turn on the military and each other, and soon it's every man for himself.  Dutton, his loyal deputy, Russell Clank (Joe Anderson), Judy, and her medical assistant, Becca (Danielle Panabaker), try to evade the military and the violent townsfolk in order to escape the chaos, but they soon find the odds stacked against them and their chances of survival quickly dwindle.<br /><br />While many people want to classify this film as a zombie flick, I have to say that the "villains" in this film are a much more lively, much more terrifying bunch.  The virus that affects the residents of Ogden Marsh makes them bloodthirsty and violent, but they manage to keep enough of their wits about them to become real threats to those who aren't affected.  The infected don't lumber around in mass groups.  Instead, they gang up and hunt those who haven't succumbed to the virus, often with revenge in mind.  Others continue to do their normal daily routines and hobbies, but with deadly consequences for those who get in their way.<br /><br />What I enjoyed most about this film is that Dutton and Clank aren't portrayed as stereotypically dumb lawmen.  Instead, they almost immediately realize what the cause is for their neighbors and friends' bizarre behavior and attempt to save as many people as they can before the military quarantines the area.<br /><br />Olyphant and Anderson shine as the lawmen in this film.  Mitchell is sufficient, as is Panabaker in a somewhat small role.  Supporting players such as Larry Cedar as the Principal Sandborn and Christie Lynn Smith as Deardra Farnum give solid, albeit brief, performances.<br /><br />When you boil down to it, "The Crazies" is just one more "infection" flick along the lines of "28 Days Later."  However, it stands above most of the other films in this genre due to smart characters, above average acting, solid direction, and a decent script.  Recommended to fans of modern thrillers and anyone who's tired of generic zombie fodder.</p></br><a href="../users/A35R8PJSEURHHF.html">A35R8PJSEURHHF</a><br/><p>Basically, just another Zombie flick.  The message they were trying to get across was how the government can just do whatever it wants; however, they really didn't push that issue to make it anything really significant.<br /><br />They made the actors stupid in this movie.  They would repeatedly split up causing one or the other to be attacked, and then saved, only to go to the next location and split up again.  The woman even sits down in front of a huge restaurant window, enjoying a glass of water (bottle not good enough when you're running for your life), knowing that the crazies and military were looking for them.

Not only that, the infected populace are acting like killer mutant zombies.

At least with Romero and his work, I have never seen it get so bleak and down-right depressing that the film is just out of the  realms of entertainment. One thing is very clear Only Romero can do Romero. Somewhere along the line this film lost entertainment value ( In my opinion) and lost a connection with the audience ( I would suspect). I have seen few films that are as utterly bleak as this one, with little or no redeeming qualities, and I am now including it on my list of films that I will not recommend under any circumstances. If you want a film that has a 80s feel ( or at least claims that) and has the brutality of what the CRAZIES aims for ( but fails) , but also has a entertaining and supernatural subplot, then definitely go for MIDNIGHT MEAT TRAIN ( unrated), since THE CRAZIES has no class, no fun, and no entertainment value.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R1HAXRNU0QX7.html">A2R1HAXRNU0QX7</a><br/><p>THE CRAZIES is not a great film, nor will it likely even enter the "Hall Of Fame" of zombie-type movies.  However, it is a tight, well-constructed and reasonably well-acted thriller that is more than worthy of a look.<br /><br />In the small mid-western town of Ogden's Marsh, high school baseball season is just getting started.  Everyone in town is there to size up the quality of this year's team...and frankly, life just couldn't get any finer.  In less than 2 minutes, we get learn all we need to know about this little town...we see that it's a town where everyone knows everyone.  Everyone has a place and is contented.  Life is simple but satisfying.  But when a glassy-eyed farmer with a shotgun wanders onto the field of play (actually, he has what might be described as a zombie-like stare), the sheriff (played at a perfect pitch by Timothy Olyphant) tried to talk him out of his weapon.  Their brief, tense confrontation ends in the death of the farmer...and the town is rattled.  Things quickly escalate as more and more citizens begin acting weird, violent and yes, CRAZY.<br /><br />It isn't quite a zombie movie...no dead person is coming back to life.  In fact, it's more a cousin to 28 DAYS LATER, where the zombies were really just people infected with rage.  But whatever the case, we essentially see the very quick collapse of this little society...especially when the government quarantines them and begins to separate the sick from the well.<br /><br />The movie takes a fairly predictable path from here...there's not really much we haven't seen before (although the film does feature the scariest journey through an automatic carwash that we've ever seen).  But there is seldom much in the way of the truly new in this genre...it's all in the execution.  If the film is constructed well enough, we don't pay quite so much attention to some of the plot holes (or if not holes, at least areas the stretch credibility, even if we accept the initial premise).  THE CRAZIES is well-constructed, and uses its modest budget well.  It doesn't attempt anything it can't pull off well, so there aren't lots of cheesy effects.  It assembles a small core of characters, and makes us care about them just enough to draw our sympathy at their plight.<br /><br />The central relationship is between sheriff Olyphant and his wife, the town doctor, played by Radha Mitchell.  They are a couple that has clearly been together for awhile, and there are no big histrionics between them.  They feel like a couple that has a natural ease between each other, and even when pushed to extremes, there's never any doubt that they're comfortable.  This reflects the overall ease of the movie...it doesn't push too hard.  Olyphant and Mitchell feel more like a married couple that is comfortably at ease with each other...not the typical movie couple who always have to find a way to tear each other's clothes off and fool around, even as the world collapses around them.  I liked that...and it made me really root for them.<br /><br />In many ways, the most interesting relationship is between Olyphant and his deputy, played by Joe Anderson (ACROSS THE UNIVERSE).  Their interplay, the casual deference of the deputy for his boss, their unshakeable sense of duty all feel natural.  These are good guys...but in quiet, unassuming ways.  They just do what they feel is right, even if they're really scared.  The movie is not showy about them...it's not like their Mel Gibson & Danny Glover in LETHAL WEAPON...they're just a couple of small town law enforcement officers who wear their badges not only with pride but with an instinctive understanding that they have RESPONSIBILITY as well.<br /><br />The movie has scares aplenty, and lots of tense scenes.  There's a great scene in the latter half when the couple is confronted by a couple of crazies in their own bedroom...we've got four people basically clawing and scratching at each other in a tiny room, and it's maddening to watch.<br /><br />It's nice to see a good, honest little film that knows its business, but takes the time to get enough little details right to make it just a bit more than ordinary.  If you're in the mood for a few jump-in-your-seat moments, you could do far, far worse than THE CRAZIES.</p></br><a href="../users/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD.html">A3PPXVR5J6U2JD</a><br/><p>I knew nothing about The Crazies going into the theater.  I didn't know it was originally produced by the father of the zombie genre, George Romero.  And I didn't expect to see a movie about a sheriff (Timothy Olyphant) and his pregnant wife (Radha Mitchell) with my own wife six months pregnant. Please note: this review contains spoilers.<br /><br />The movie starts out slowly.  In these stressful times, we're all too familiar with scenes of sudden gun violence in an idyllic setting.  After sheriff Dutton is forced to gun down a former town drunk on a little league field, the town of Ogden Marsh begins to unravel.  Everybody knows everybody else in this small town and a murder leaves emotional aftershocks that traumatize its citizens. This includes Dutton's wife, who happens to be the town doctor.<br /><br />The tension slowly notches up from there. These early moments are critical in establishing The Crazies as a superior horror film. The petty rivalries, the secret and not-so-secret grudges, the sadistic bullies - all of the townsfolk's deepest impulses are let loose through the TRIXIE virus, a military bioweapon that has accidentally (?) contaminated the town.<br /><br />Unlike so many other horror movies, Dutton and his deputy Clank (Joe Anderson) are precisely the people who should be dealing with an outbreak.  The problem is that they are little fish in a very big pond.  The movie quickly morphs from a slasher flick to survival horror when the military gets called in, loses control, and pulls out.<br /><br />What makes The Crazies so refreshing is that it plays on horror tropes, using it to narrative advantage.  We find out that the soldiers who are executing townsfolk aren't faceless, that the TRIXIE virus may or may not be transmitted through the water supply, and that taking one's temperature isn't a guaranteed means of identifying who's infected. The Crazies makes no promises but always delivers.<br /><br />This ambiguity may frustrate some people who expect everything to be wrapped in a neat bow, but director Breck Eisner knows that there is horror in uncertainty.  It's precisely this lack of clarity that makes the movie so good - the villains aren't unilaterally evil, the victims aren't always helpless, and the solutions aren't always moral.  The Crazies wallows in the gray area of harsh decisions, treating an outbreak with all the ethical gravity of a war.<br /><br />Let there be no doubt, this is as much a war movie as it is a horror movie. The real crazies, Eisner seems to say, is anyone who would trust authority. These days, that may not be such bad advice.<br /><br />P.S. Stay through the credits!</p></br><a href="../users/AUUH6Z8MSGGF.html">AUUH6Z8MSGGF</a><br/><p><span class="tiny"> Length:: 3:59 Mins<br /><br /></span>Gina from Haunted Flower reviews "The Crazies" directed by Breck Eisner and produced by George A. Romero based on his 1973 version. It stars Timothy Olyphant, Radha Mitchell, and Joe Anderson. A contagious mental illness takes over the inhabitants of a small town in Iowa.<br /><br />[...]</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>I have never seen the original "Crazies" film so I can not comment on which version is better. The Crazies(remake)takes an overplayed zombie genre idea and tries to make it more realistic. The story is told simply with a plausible background story. Instead of hordes of zombies running around like supercharged baboons or sloth-like undead roaming aimlessly, these "zombies" are alive and act fairly human(at least from a distance), but have a pretty mean disposition. Depending on how far gone they are, they can almost seem normal...I said almost. What makes it seem much more real is that they still seem to have a little memory of the former selves and react to people they know. The special effects and gore are played down a notch, but it doesn't make the film any less frightening. This is largely because the "zombies" are the least of your worries! I'm a fan of some of the classic zombie films and there have been a number of good ones in recent years, but The Crazies is one of the few that made me think could this happen? ...and that's pretty scary in itself!</p></br><a href="../users/A1KZQ5DIX0YUE1.html">A1KZQ5DIX0YUE1</a><br/><p>Even the critics liked this one better. The original film (of the same name, written and directed by the grandfather of survival horror, George A. Romero) and the remake share some similarities in plot, but the characterizations are completely different. But Romero did co-write this one; I guess some hindsight helped this version. Here we have local law enforcement struggling to figure things out instead of former military folk trying to do the same. With Olyphant and company, the film seems a bit more grounded as (at least for me) we actually care about these characters more than their 1973 counterparts.<br /><br />Either way, we are given a good turn of survival horror as a small town becomes infected by a military bioweapon. The story rides upon the edge of a knife with one slip putting the characters against the infected and the other means getting caught by the military. It is a good look at 'creepy' instead of standard and expected scares, though there is more than enough of the later. There is a great climatic final bout before the credits roll and in the end, I might even watch a sequel if it still had the same characters.<br /><br />The BD features a bit more than standard fair in the way of special features: a good commentary track with the director, a handful of behind-the-scenes and even a pair of motion comics. All of the features are put together well, no tedium or monotony in the lot. As for presentation, the picture is crisp and clear and the 5.1 track does add to the tension. I'd rather heard a 7.1 track, but I guess I'm still waiting for soundtracks to catch up.<br /><br />It is rare nowadays to see a real and honest horror movie. Most times we are spoon-fed psycho teen popcorn flicks or gorefests with no plot. While both can be mildly entertaining it is nice to find one that is worthwhile.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PNTEDGMOLMOY.html">A2PNTEDGMOLMOY</a><br/><p>Breck Eisner's "The Crazies" provides a lesson for our times - the mess may be bad, but the cure sure looks a lot worse.<br /><br />Based on a George Romero flick, "Crazies" does not break much new ground in horror movies, but it does have something to say about the nature of evil.  An idyllic Mid-west small town seems just like any other idyllic Mid-west small town until the town drunk stalks into the middle of a youth league baseball game with his shotgun.  David (Tim Olyphant, "Deadwood," "Justified"), the town lawman, tries his best but when you're confronted with a shotgun toting drunk, odds are you're going to need to use your gun.<br /><br />This tragedy might go unnoticed as a once-in-a-generation tall tale that you so often hear of small towns ("Remember the time when the cops gunned down that guy at the ballgame?") if it weren't for the fact that across town a farmer burns his family home to the ground after locking his wife and son inside.<br /><br />Something is wrong in Pleasantville.<br /><br />Eventually David and his wife Judy (Radha Mitchell, "Man on Fire"), who just happens to be the town doctor, begin the fight to save their town, only to have that fight circumvented by the arrival of The Government.  Unfortunately for David, Judy, and their neighbors, The Government appears much more interested in making this problem go away - by any means necessary - than with saving the town.  As far as The Government is concerned, the only thing worse than destroying a small American town with a Government-engineered biological weapon is to have the story break on the national news.<br /><br />David, Judy, and their friends must not only survive the Crazies - who are only too happy to kill you in the most violent manner possible - they must avoid falling into the helpful, welcoming arms of Big Brother.  This poses an interesting question - where do you turn for help when the people who are in charge of helping you want you to disappear?<br /><br />Olyphant has become one of our most reliable actors.  With a glare or a quick one-liner, Olyphant conveys a depth of character - and often menace - that draws you in.  When David makes an unimaginable offer to Judy, you believe him, just because Olyphant is that good.<br /><br />"The Crazies" is a violent movie, although not nearly as bloody as the plethora of other zombie films we've seen in recent years.  Tension rather than terror rules the day here, and that's a good thing.</p></br><a href="../users/A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ.html">A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ</a><br/><p>Director Breck Eisner has taken the concept of George A. Romero's original movie, and produced a contemporary version of The Crazies that feels like the worst parts of Outbreak and 28 Days Later combined.  Better in every single way, terrifying at every turn, this is a nail-biter, an updated horror film that does not disappoint.<br /><br />When a quiet, elder gentleman interrupts a high school baseball game by walking into centerfield toting a shotgun, the town of Ogden Marsh, Iowa is irrevocably changed.  With residents suddenly plagued by a mysterious sickness that turns them into psychopaths, the military springs into action, quarantining the entire town and attempting to stifle the outbreak by removing and immobilizing the sick.  Meanwhile, sheriff David Dutton (Olyphant), his wife (Mitchell), the town deputy, and one other fight for survival<br /><br />Despite the fact that nothing is terribly original, the movie avoids being too predictable.  Scares jump off the screen from beginning to end, and the tone of the movie is believable enough to be ominous throughout.  Some of the scenarios in which the sick bound out after our heroes are completely unexpected.  The special effects are creative enough to add well to the thrust of the film without being Michael Bay level ostentatious.  The makeup and gore are top-notch as well, with blood, brain, and viscera splattering multiple times, accompanied by my approving applause.<br /><br />Horror fans will love this movie, and I view it as redemption for an underwhelming predecessor.  I loved it from setup to explosive ending.  Be on the lookout for the pitchfork scene!  YIKES!<br /><br />Jason Elin</p></br><a href="../users/AHBNPMHDWZ7SB.html">AHBNPMHDWZ7SB</a><br/><p>The Crazies was a pleasant surprise. After how good Dawn of the Dead was, I was looking forward to another remake of a George Romero zombie, or zombie-esque film. It did not disappoint, but it kind of aggrivates me to say that I do not see a movie of this nature ever being more than what we have seen already in this one, Dawn of the Dead, I Am Legend, or 28 Days Later. I would love to watch a zombie movie that elevates the genre, but it seems to be stuck in a stagnant cycle. But getting past that, I can see the production value in this one. The colors are vivid and help set the shifting tones perfectly. Throughout the course of the film we witnessed a few great scenes in the night time (which most zombie movies tend to fixate on), but also just as many duriing the day. And none were more exciting than the last. I actually bought the explanation of the virus, and began to genuinely hate the government for what it did. That rarely happens to me when I watch these kinds of movies. The actors were great too. All were believable, and I fealt sorry for them. I even fealt sorry for the townsfolk that had been infected.<br /><br />Timothy Olyphant was a great choice to lead the cast as the town sheriff, David. Radha Mitchell played his wife Judy, and she was just as great. I enjoyed seeing the depth in their relationship, and how much they went through for each other. My favorite performance was Joe Anderson as the deputy, Russell. He provided, not only comic relief at times, but also a depth equal to the main characters, and a final resolution that is quite commendable and may bring a tear to someone's eye depending on how invested in this story they are. The transfer is superb, and the extras are surprisingly thorough. So overall, I would recommend The Crazies to everyone who enjoys these kinds of films. It's not too gorey like most movies in its subgenre, there isn't an abundance of profanity, and there's no sexual content at all. So in my opinion, it's pretty family friendly for what it is (to an extent of course).</p></br><a href="../users/A2D0PJFW2VY8G.html">A2D0PJFW2VY8G</a><br/><p>A common theme in recent horror films is the locals of a small town or village turning into zombies as a result of a virus. Breck Eisner's The Crazies, a remake of George Romero's 1973 film, addresses a similar issue when a peaceful town descends into chaos as the result of an unknown virus that turns people into the murderous crazies of the title. With so many horror films following this formula does The Crazies have anything unique to offer?<br /><br />The film begins in the town of Ogden Marsh in Iowa. We witness the town in flames before the story switches back two days to explain how the destruction began. Sinisterly we see satellite footage of the town and the words "initiate containment protocol" appear early in the film. Things begin normally at a baseball game but local sheriff David (Timothy Olyphant) and his deputy Russell (Joe Anderson) confront local resident Rory Hamill (Mike Hickman) who walks onto the field armed with a gun. When David moves in close he finds Rory unresponsive and when he raises his gun the sheriff has no choice but to kill Rory. This becomes the first of some bizarre incidents in the town and culminates in the discovery of a crashed plane in the nearby swampland. All too soon the military descend on the town, checking the temperature of all the locals and separating those with high temperatures as infected by an unknown virus. When David is separated from his wife Judy (Radha Mitchell) he must find a way to rescue and escape the town where the infected locals and the military have no hesitation in murdering anyone in their way.<br /><br />The opening reels of The Crazies are very intriguing with the shooting at the baseball game followed by a local farmer trapping his wife and child and burning their property to the ground. When the emergency services arrive he is outside and seemingly doesn't have a care in the world. The satellite view of the town and the military's sudden appearance cannot disguise who is responsible for the outbreak of the virus and that it is linked to the crashed plane that is found at the start of the film. When the army arrives they separate the locals with Judy being told she is infected because of a high temperature though she insists this is down to her being pregnant. David is powerless to stop her being taken away but when the locals are fenced off and told to await evacuation they find salvation in another local who drives through the perimeter and signals everyone to flee for their lives. David hooks up with his deputy Russell and they rescue Judy and another girl Becca (Danielle Panabaker) who have been strapped to beds in another part of the military facility. The quartet then begins their long journey away from the town and to safety.<br /><br />The Crazies certainly has some chilling moments, especially when more of the locals become infected. In one unnerving scene Judy, Becca and other locals who are presumed infected lie defenceless, strapped to their beds while carnage erupts outside as the perimeter fences are breached and the townspeople begin to escape. Suddenly a man enters the facility scraping a pitchfork along the ground and approaching those strapped to the beds. When they begin to weep he raises his pitchfork and proceeds to stab the locals in their beds! When the infected man is about to kill Becca, Judy cries out and he turns his attention to her! A further twist in the film comes in the form of David's deputy Russell who shows many susceptibilities to violence when the group make their escape from town and it is quite clear that he is infected as well.<br /><br />When I first saw the trailer for The Crazies I was drawn to it and believed it would be one of the better horror films of recent years. By the end I had enjoyed it but not as much as I had hoped I would. It's hard to say clearly what irked me about the film. It starts really well, building up the tension well as the virus spreads and the military come charging in but in the latter stages becomes very predictable. We learn during the film that the virus infects only certain people and if you have no symptoms after 48 hours then you're fine. With Judy being pregnant it's pretty obvious that she'll get through it and go on to have a child that will signal a new start. The deterioration of Russell as the virus takes hold could have been a lot better. His changing mood and increasing threats were good but once he realises what he's becoming the film descends into melodrama which doesn't work considering the farmer that killed his wife and child without a care in the world. The good thing is the film has one of those endings that will make you smile and could leave this open for a sequel.<br /><br />The Crazies is one of the better horror films of recent years though it does carry some flaws. There are some great scenes with the infected locals lashing out at friends and family without hesitation and the entrance of the military and their approach to dealing with the crisis are sinister and chilling moments indeed. This isn't as good as I had hoped but is still worth a look.</p></br><a href="../users/A3OXHLG6DIBRW8.html">A3OXHLG6DIBRW8</a><br/><p>This remake of the original <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008WJDA">The Crazies</a> does a great job setting the mood right from the beginning and was able to sustain the level of suspense fairly successfully all the way through to the end. I like zombie themed movies and also enjoy escape movies, so this was a good fit for me, despite the occasional "slasher" elements.<br /><br />No plote spoilers from me: The story unfolds in an idealistic farming community where life is predictable and everyone knows everyone, in short a place I would like live. When a seemingly random divergence from the norm occurs, quickly followed by odd (and deranged) behavior by normally upstanding citizens, the small town sheriff (well acted by Olyphant) and his deputy (Anderson) begin to investigate the connections between the events. Add to this a very wholesome and loving relationship between the sheriff and his doctor wife (Mitchell), and you start to care about the three main characters. The pace of the movie changes quickly when the military arrives to contain the situation and it did keep me in an uneasy state (which is good for a horror movie).<br /><br />I have watched this three or four times now and still find it enjoyable.<br /><br />Recommended!<br /><br />CFH</p></br><a href="../users/A2AK7ZFKW08HID.html">A2AK7ZFKW08HID</a><br/><p>This movie was downright creepy from the very start and never gives up. The baseball scene was just scary as hell cause its sad to say but you can almost picture some nut job doing that these days. It seems your kids are not safe anywhere. It has that kind of Romero feel to the story, like what Romero did with The dead series. He put alot of what was wrong with the world then into his movies, and the writers did the same with.this movie. It just creeps you out knowing this could come true in this day and age.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HVL790PBWYTU.html">A2HVL790PBWYTU</a><br/><p>Today's horror filmmakers (or, rather, film re-makers) keep on lifting from past horror flicks. This time, the source is George Romero's dubious 1973 cult classic. Director Breck Eisner modernizes the story and tries to switch things up a bit by focusing more on the tiny pack of survivors, and less from the military's perspective. THE CRAZIES is a mean and vicious B-horror survival flick, and I do think it superior to the original.<br /><br />There's always a more gothic feel when the venue veers away from the city and into the countryside, right? THE CRAZIES tells of an apocalypse in the Heartland, in the small midwestern town of Ogden Marsh, Iowa (population: 1,200 or thereabouts, but soon dropping at an alarming rate). The story opens with Johnny Cash somberly serenading you and me to "We'll Meet Again," and I couldn't help but note how ideal to horror cinema is Johnny Cash's ominous gravel voice. He establishes a disquieting mood, gets you all fretting.<br /><br />This movie is a germophobe's pick of the week. A government plane, conveying an experimental bio-toxin, goes down in the woods and infects the water supply. The inhabitants of Ogden Marsh are soon succumbing to weird stupors and then behaving irrationally, and then murderously. Our point-of-view characters are Sheriff Dave Dutton (Timothy Olyphant) and his pregnant physician wife Judy (Radha Mitchell) and we track them in the course of 24 hours as they're caught in the middle of a harrowing outbreak.<br /><br />This remake tones down the political allegory so rife in Romero's original version. But there's enough going on in the world currently that Breck Eisner does inject certain themes. The film taps into your deepest sense of paranoia, not of ghosts or zombies, but of more topical concerns - one's fear of disease and infection, one's suspicion of our neighbors, and disillisionment with the government. The military - its grunts gigged out in uniform gas masks - is so concerned with covering its tracks and containing the leaked toxin that it promptly quarantines the town and begins to herd and corral the locals. Except that these viruses are always crazy virulent, aren't they? Things quickly get out of hand. Wash, rinse, repeat.<br /><br />Communications are cut off in Ogden Marsh, signals to all cell phones and to the Internet abruptly killed. And with the town isolated and mass psychosis at hand, society rapidly breaks down. Darwinism kicks in, anarchy descending like a swift mother. In an apocalypse, ain't that the way the cookie crumbles? Can the Sheriff guide his tiny band of gibbering townspeople out of the quarantined zone?<br /><br />Oh, to be unhinged and creepy. THE CRAZIES accomplishes what it sets out to do. It serves up chills to ripple up and down your spine. That dish of bleakness comes as dessert. Director Breck Eisner demonstrates restraint. He underplays things and takes time to establish plot and character. He stages long moments in which he lets the nervous tension build up. And when the terrifying set-pieces finally come around, he unleashes his inner gorehound.<br /><br />These demented infecteds aren't shambling zombies; they aren't zombies at all. To paraphrase someone from the DVD's extra features, these infected are actually bursting with too much life, the virus in them raring to manifest thru their skin. This results in the crazies sporting wicked blood blisters, taut veins, and popping tendons. Somewhere, a dermatologist is tossing and turning. But these make-up visuals prove really effective. The film gratifies the hard-core horror fan, gives the people what they want, to the tune of a series of bloody (and blood-curdling) sequences: a madman puncturing victims with a pitchfork in a medical triage, the Sheriff's encounter with a berserk doctor's bone saw, a pair of locos operating a truck stop service... But the most memorable scene features the Sheriff's nasty, grimace-inducing method of dispensing with one insane woman. This movie is enough to make me swear off water for life. Or at least give up tap water.<br /><br />Kudos to Joe Anderson, by the way, for making the most out of his Deputy role.

This highly entertaining remake of George Romero's classic is best suited for today's horror/sci-fi fans.  I gave it 4 stars because it hits on all but one cylinder...Romero's unique style that really doesn't need the Hollywood touch.  The acting was okay.  Timothy Olyphant as the sheriff and Radha Mitchell as his wife were credible, but the true acting performance was turned in by Joe Anderson as the deputy...very convincing.  There are creepy moments, lots of chills and tamed down gore.  The "crazies" are made even more scary via excellent makeup and effects.  Kudos there.  The story tries to branch off where no film has ever gone, but how many flicks are out there about the government covering up a catastrophic mistake they made?  Worth a watch...but not a second time.  The extras are great, especially two episodes of The Crazies motion comics.</p></br><a href="../users/A2XRZV63X79YSJ.html">A2XRZV63X79YSJ</a><br/><p>Two reasons I wanted to see this film.  I like the films of George A Romero who made the original version of this film.

There are two real problems with the film, first is they spend no time establishing the characters.  They give you just introduce the supporting characters before their crazy scene.  Second, plot twist are derived only to create the next crazy attack.<br /><br />Now with that said, it is an average fun horror film.

Of course whoever made it had more than $45 for a budget but regardless, the new version is far superior than Mr. Romeros original.</p></br><a href="../users/AWPODHOB4GFWL.html">AWPODHOB4GFWL</a><br/><p>If you don't like zombie films, you'll find yourself sitting through this one, albeit sometimes reluctantly.  It has all the modern setups of a classic zombie film, but includes enough plot and character development that you start to flip out any time someone is threatening the heroes - ANYONE.  Those heroes would be the Sheriff and his doctor wife.<br /><br />A flashback starts the film with the town being a burned out mess.  It looks like Armageddon, so you know what to expect.  The story then begins when things were normal.  I won't spoil the rich plot, but it includes a scary beginning where the sheriff has to shoot someone at a public town game when he approaches everyone with a rifle.  He is the first `crazie'.  People start showing up at the doctor's office one after another, `not being themselves'.  The weirdness escalates with other bizarre behavior; a man trying to burn down a house with his wife and child inside, hunters finding a government plane in the local pond, a theory of water contamination and hoards of more scary, grisly killings.<br /><br />The military shows up and starts rounding up the crazies with the non-crazies, which is a real treat for these who are still sane.  Some of the healthy are strapped down in gurneys as crazies approach, and well.  It's pretty gory.  Finally the crazies get out of control and the military screws up and everyone gets loose.  It's a wild ride.  There are some great scenes including some non-crazies being trapped in a car going through car wash (very clever) and a nifty car and helicopter chase scene to mix in with all the bloodshed.  It does get to you after a while with the relentless carnage.<br /><br />Of course, in all these disaster movies, the big question is who will survive?  It must be the good sheriff and his doctor wife. Right?  Well, some survive and others don't, like any good zombie movie - you just never know.  The ending is classic as well.  Like a clock, it literally ticks down to the last scene - and then some later on, if you can believe that.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FPDWTD9AENVK.html">A2FPDWTD9AENVK</a><br/><p>A small Mid-Western town is struck by an infectious virus that causes its inhabitants to lose their minds and begin ruthlessly slaughtering their neighbors until the military is able to intervene and "eliminate" the problem. What made Romero's 1973 version of the film so successful is the context in which it was made, in a frightful era following Vietnam where the threat of global terror and biological warfare loomed overhead. Romero was one of the first to tackle these fears through the safety net of the genre, whereas Eisner's update comes decades later when the threats have all but been eliminated and the theme has been retold countless times. Although each of the cast members provide serviceable performances, the poor attempts at humor, inane dialog, and empty plotting make this a chore to watch. What's worse, the lapses in logic and unlikely timing of events also make the film feel rushed and disorganized. Throwing in some mild gore simply isn't enough to cover these repeated flaws. THE CRAZIES remake is far too generic, too tame, and too shallow to leave any lasting effect on the genre.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies</p></br><a href="../users/A1COW0UIB5HA9J.html">A1COW0UIB5HA9J</a><br/><p>In the small town of Ogden Marsh in a nearby swamp, there was an airplane that crash lands in it contaminating the town's water supply with chemicals. The people who drink from the water turn into homicidal maniacs who look like zombies as it seems some government contamination unites are blocking the town, Sheriff Dutton (Timothy Olyphant) with pregnant wife Judy (Radha Mitchell) including Deputy Russell (Joe Anderson) and Becca (Danielle Panabaker) are escaping the town to get to the major city for a new home unless they can get out alive.<br /><br />Terrifying and brilliant remake of the obscure George Romero cult fave, this Sci-fi horror thriller is better than one of Romero's weaker efforts (Dawn of the Dead with Night and Day were better including martin). This is a fantastic reimagining that will rank with "The Thing", "The Fly", "Dawn of the Dead", "The Blob", "King Kong" etc in terms of great genre remakes. The acting is just superb and the action is plentiful, George A. Romero executive produced this one here which makes it an A on my list.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray gives the viewer that theatrical experience through flawless picture and sound that skyrockets to the roof. The extras are terrific such as audio commentary, featurettes, storyboards, 2 motion comics, photo gallery and teasers to trailers.<br /><br />A must have for Sci-fi/horror fanatics.</p></br><a href="../users/AQUVTQFFXP4AC.html">AQUVTQFFXP4AC</a><br/><p>On its own as a horror thriller thing, this movie has appropriate atmosphere to be compelling enough to watch.  But as it moves further and further along, it becomes rather clear that the whole reasoning behind why the events in the plot happened, as well as the responses of people involved, are directly the result of stupidity.<br /><br />Unlike the sort of "on the fly" stupidity in movies like "House of Wax" (2005) where you could possibly justify their stupidity in that they were in the heat of the moment, the biggest bouts of stupidity come from situations that had more than enough time for forethought longer than six minutes planning.<br /><br />For example: the plane.  For the sake of avoiding spoiler (though it's not even that important a spoiler), I'll just say that a very important military airplane crashes in a location... and they don't even reach the area until some two or three days later.  It's a tenuous stretch, but it causes even more stupid decisions...<br /><br />Like, the military suddenly swarming into town, busting into houses Iraq-style, and arresting EVERYONE and taking them to detention camps where parents are separated from children, and people are scanned.  People asking questions are told to shut up, and are occasionally beaten up with assault rifle butts.<br /><br />Considering that they RELEASE the people they scan that are clean, it was completely not surprising that a bunch of rednecks in a truck SMASH into the compound, SMASH APART the ULTRA military defensive chainlink fence, and get slaughtered in the firefight... while also letting out ALL the people taken in the camp, infected and not infected.<br /><br />So because the military didn't bother setting up patrols, or defensive borders, or even TELLING people WHY they are being rounded up like criminals or terrorists, even with a token lie in order to prevent panic, their entire endeavor collapses and tons of people have to die.<br /><br />And EVEN WORSE than that, the thing they were scanning people for to tell if they were infected... elevated temperature.<br /><br />And given that a pregnant woman in average health was detected for elevated temperature, I think it'd be safe to say this would be like testing people by spraying them in the face with dust and considering anyone who sneezes to be infected.  They don't even bother to realize that MAYBE she has high temperature because she's pregnant or sick or both or has a mild fever or maybe THEY'RE JUST A LITTLE HOT FROM BEING AMBUSHED LIKE CRIMINALS, RIPPED OUT OF THEIR HOMES, AND PUT IN A CAMP WITH A THOUSAND OTHER PEOPLE IN CLOSE QUARTERS.<br /><br />So because of that level of sheer stupidity, along with their handling of people like terrorists, it's supposed to be a SHOCK when the people react violently, and then the infected escape and spread and they have to nuke the town.  Yes really.  They nuke the whole town.  Because they were too damn stupid to put more than six minutes of thought into a containment plan that would NOT cause wild panic and terror.</p></br><a href="../users/A29TKSIWA3JKF3.html">A29TKSIWA3JKF3</a><br/><p>I am not a fan of the overused "false-start" and having seen and not liking the original; I came at this movie with very low expectations and was, however, pleasantly surprised.  This is actually a pretty decent horror film.  Flawed, to be sure, but I still liked it and could overlook its shortcomings....<br />The beginning was rough; it felt like a movie of the week melodrama.  The town drunk shows up at a ballgame loaded for bear: to shoot or not to shoot?  His widow giving the sheriff a halfhearted slap didn't help the pervasive sense of hesitancy on the part of the director.  Pick a genre, it's not that difficult: horror or something limp and whiny.  Eventually, they found the right tone and things began to percolate.  It also helped that there were three solid leads playing the most important characters: Radha Mitchell, Timothy Olyphant, and especially Joe Anderson as the loyal deputy.  It was caring about these people that made this movie work (an element sorely missing in the original movie).  The stand out scenes were: sewing in the morgue, the bedroom battle where the sheriff gets a good grip on a knife, the carwash, and the truck stop.<br />Not as appreciated were the endless walking scenes, the throwaway piece with the major, the BOO type scares, and some of the connecting scenes that made little sense time-wise.  Also, if you're on the run from someone, don't go walking down the middle of the highway in broad daylight!<br />I do think they could have done more with the herding of the townspeople into trucks and hauling them away, but that's a minor point.  I'm just glad they finally picked a direction and went for it.<br />It's a keeper (the original was not).</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>Some may say "The Crazies" (remake of a 1973 George A. Romero film) is a zombie film without zombies. The genre's basic rules are there, with slight differences as to the details of the story. If you have seen such films as "28 Days Later..." and its sequel (and of course Romero's masterpieces), you know what is going to happen in this entertaining but routine film from Breck Eisner, director of the 2005 adventure action "Sahara."<br /><br />David Dutten (Timothy Olyphant) is a happily married sheriff of the fictional town of Ogden March, Iowa. After a disturbing incident at the baseball ground that shocks the townspeople, David realizes that something strange and sinister is going on in this sleepy town, slowly turning the residents into "The Crazies."<br /><br />As in his previous film "Sahara," Breck Eisner has created effective set-pieces without relying on graphic violence, even though his techniques employed here are mostly familiar, even clich&eacute;d ones with hackneyed jump scares you have seen countless times elsewhere (like peeping through a keyhole). Characters are rather stock types, but acting from the leads including Timothy Olyphant, Radha Mitchell and Joe Anderson make up for that.<br /><br />"The Crazies" is a good example of successful modern-day remake: slick narrative, bigger budget (though still modest by the standard of Hollywood), and less social commentaries. Nothing new exactly, but still it works.</p></br><a href="../users/A3QH6BEY6RYQR0.html">A3QH6BEY6RYQR0</a><br/><p>A small town in Iowa sees some of its residents acting strange and committing violent acts. The local sheriff discovers a downed plane in a nearby river, and suspects that the town's water supply may have been contaminated, but by what? The terror spreads, and the remaining sane inhabitants are left to fend for themselves against not only the sickened residents, but the military personnel who are in town to "clean things up." The film has a lot of good scares, and is violent, but not unnecessarily so. The tension throughout keeps the viewer engrossed, and at times, unsure of whom is "sick", and who is not. The Crazies contains some good scares and is a lot of fun.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GD1G8XXPRYQ8.html">A1GD1G8XXPRYQ8</a><br/><p>I've been waiting for this movie for so long! It seemed a little short to me. I wish it was at least a half an hour longer. It seemed that at the end the military got rid of the little town a little too fast. I really liked the idea of poison that turns men into a killing machines without a mind or any feelings. I wouldn't however call it a zombie movie. It was more like something else than a living undead, eating brains and meat of everything that is alive and has a flesh. Here people go crazy and kill each other like humans not like zombies. I would give it 5 stars if the ending was different and the whole movie was a little different. To me, military in here spoiled everything. Why couldn't there be military men, which couldn't survive? Or why were they not in a true hell? It seemed even that it was a little too easy role:be a military man, with a gun and unless director says you're dead, you're together with squads of other soldiers almost invincible. Eh,sigh. I wish there was some kind of twist where everything would just fall apart and crazies would not be that easily destroyed.</p></br><a href="../users/A2582KMXLK2P06.html">A2582KMXLK2P06</a><br/><p>The Crazies is just a really wonderfully created suspenseful flick dealing with a cop and his pregnant wife running around town avoiding a mysterious disease that turns people into mindless lunatics.<br /><br />Now I was never quite sure whether these diseased people were supposed to be zombies or just a horrible illness that turned regular people into psychotic killers.  I'm leaning towards zombies simply because I remember a few scenes that showed a certain strange look (a vicious green glow) deep inside their infected eyeballs.<br /><br />Anyway the Crazies really does a *tremendous* job building into a solid, storyline-focused film.  I'd even go so far as to put it on the same level of quality as 28 Days Later.  Watching a select few lucky people barely escaping with their lives time and time again manages to keep your attention VERY well.<br /><br />One thing I found a bit odd is that, when we reach the part when the military comes into the picture, they seemed completely heartless and didn't even care if they eliminated innocent diseased-free people.  Many times there wasn't even a DESIRE to see if the people were diseased or not- they just shot and fired and killed them.  To me that was just... really unnecessary and downright harsh.<br /><br />I assume the reason for this was because the miltary (and perhaps, the government) *could*.  After all, we're talking about a disease outbreak in a small, mid-western town apparently in the middle of nowhere.  "If you kill ALL the people, nobody will realize it -or rather, nobody will *care*- anyway).  Still, a LITTLE bit of compassion would have been nice.<br /><br />The violence is appealing, the suspense is seriously all OVER the place, the storytelling is memorable because it improves as it goes along, and... the Crazies is just a splendid film.</p></br><a href="../users/A120GIT50UISJP.html">A120GIT50UISJP</a><br/><p>A biological weapon that turns people into homicidal maniacs before it kills them is accidentally released in the small town of Ogden Marsh, Iowa. A small group of survivors manages to elude soldiers and the infected long enough to make it to the edge of town, but they're a long way from safety. The Crazies follows the themes of Carriers and 28 Days Later, examining how people and politics cope with apocalyptic situations; too closely, really, to add anything new to this fascinating theme.</p></br><a href="../users/AZSN1TO0JI87B.html">AZSN1TO0JI87B</a><br/><p>If the 2010 remake of George A. Romero's "The Crazies" seems familiar, well, don't be surprised. The film concerns a small town that goes cuckoo for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ5E6E">Cocoa Puffs</a> after their water supply is tainted. The seemingly docile and irregular townsfolk suddently have a thirst for blood and nothing can convince them otherwise, save for a blow from a shotgun. Things go from bad to worse when the military steps in, while a band of survivors and their troubled sheriff (Timothy Olyphany) try their very hardest to get out of dodge.<br /><br />"The Crazies" smells of much of the post-apocalyptic fare we've been treated to over the past decade or so and unfortunately does very little to steer itself away from the genre's cliches. To say you'll see every jump scare and grisly death coming is an understatement; unless you're new to the genre, nothing in this film will take you by surprise. Having said that, though, the film does a good job of keeping a feverish pace from the get-go. Director Breck Eisner doesn't waste any time and the result is a film that is lean, mean and efficient in its purpose. The cast also helps amp up the energy as well, with the ever-reliable Timothy Olyphant stepping up to the plate with a performance that overcomes many of the script's flaws (flaws which concern crucial character development). Not only is the experience of following the sheriff and his crew on their mission a thrill, it's also driven home with a realistic human element which, in the end, saves the film from itself<br /><br />All in all, while "The Crazies" doesn't bring anything new to the genre, it at least serves as an efficient roller-coaster ride of a horror-flick. The direction and the cinematography is top-notch with performances from Olyphant and company making the trip worthwhile. True, horror fans will find its script a bit stale and bland while fans of the Romero <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008WJDA">original</a> will be left wondering why more wasn't done with this update. As it stands, "The Crazies" isn't the best remake to come along in recent memory, but it's certainly not the worst.</p></br><a href="../users/AIMR915K4YCN.html">AIMR915K4YCN</a><br/><p>THE CRAZIES takes place in Ogden Marsh, Iowa.

This is a fantastic remake / update of the original 1973 George Romero classic. While I love Romero's version, I enjoyed this one even more, due to it's high suspense / terror factor. THE CRAZIES is right up there w/ the DAWN OF THE DEAD, THE HILLS HAVE EYES, and LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT remakes!

It's very bad due to bad acting, childish special effects and tiny budget. When I heard about this remake, I was skeptical because most of the time, remakes were a waste of money. After watching  this one at  the theatre, I had to admit I was completely wrong.<br /><br />There were a lot of scary, gory and suspenseful scenes. However, the last 10 minutes were predictable as other films. The action scenes were swift. There's nothing new in the plot. So far, it's the scariest movies I've watched in 2010. It's a must watch for horror fans</p></br><a href="../users/A96JD9312DHWC.html">A96JD9312DHWC</a><br/><p>When kickin' it in a small town, you expect small town things to happen. you see the same things in the background, notice the same people and the same schedules, and you grow to know how to relate to the same people. What you don't expect is for the world to turn an emotive 180 and for people to start going a little mad, taking to household and street alike with something horrible infecting them.<br /><br />When The Crazies came out, I was thrilled to see it. I wanted my sheriff to go and lay down the law on a lot of nuts, and he did get that chance. The key is to remember that they are infected with something, too, and that they aren't going around and getting out coffins or anything like that. He and a few other people do their best to hold on and remain "sane" as things get progressively bad too, and they battle a lot of rage-filled people. These fights take place as our leads try to tend to wounds, try to save families, try to save other people, and try to save themselves. And, well, they dwindle like any bipedal river would when you start picking off piece of it.<br /><br />Expectations were high for this movie in some circles - you to see the hype that went on as the movie got closer to the relse - and i think that hurt it a little. From the onset you knew what the movie was about, so plot is down to twists and then you have gore and those lovely little moments when you move from your chair to the skyline. I personally thought the movie was really good in a lot of ways, too, and moreso since I didn't really expect a remake horror film to do well at all.<br />I know it is a remake of obscurity and the 70s when I write this as well, but remakes haven't been the greatest when it comes to track records. Still, this seemed nice and fun to me.<br /><br />One thing it relies on is the fact that you do not know who is infected and you don't know behavior from stress relations or from viral relations. That basically means you could be sitting next to the person that might well want you dead, or it could mean you are over-reacting. In the movie it even seems to imply that the infected don't really notice how gone they are except for some brief moments of clarity, so that comes into play as well.<br /><br />Regardless of what has been said, I thought the movie was good and I enjoyed it. As i noted before, you know what to expect and you have a lot of moments you can almost ocunt on. If, for instanc,e people go into some place with doors, something is bound to be there. You simply get stuck with the brain power of your people here - and whether or not they can think themselve sout of a town that is killing everything, troopers included. Add that to an ending that isn't very nice and you have a movie i liked enough to rate around a 4.5 or so, rounding it to a 5.</p></br><a href="../users/AV6QDP8Q0ONK4.html">AV6QDP8Q0ONK4</a><br/><p>The movie starts out showing a town in flames, then quickly jumps to "two days" earlier. The action starts rather fast. Character is built during the action scenes. A man with a shotgun walks out into center field during a baseball game. After a brief confrontation, the sheriff has to shoot him. Soon another man goes crazy and burns his family to death. The sheriff quickly figures what has happened as they find a downed plane in the marsh which supplies the drinking water to the town. At this point the movie had the feel of "Impulse" (1984). When they go back to town the cell phone doesn't work, nor can they get on-line. The sheriff recognizes something is wrong and ventures out into the street of the deserted town of Ogden Marsh, Iowa. The military comes in and rounds up people into camps/ separating out infected and non-infected with an ear thermometer. The sheriff and his wife lead a small group of people out of the area, believing that if they could just make it to Cedar Rapids, they would be fine.(Death or Cedar Rapids is coin toss for most folks.) Meanwhile they have to battle crazies, hide from the military, and watch each other for signs of being crazy. Radha Mitchell is this generation's Lynda Day George. The acting was above par for B horror. There are some different killing scenes then the normal slasher films. My favorite was the guy dragging the pitch fork (cover) into a hospital room where the patients are strapped into beds. The pitch fork grates along the floor like chalk on a blackboard. No nudity or sex. The f-bomb gets dropped once that I recall.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>Oh where oh where have 5-star movies gone? Oh where oh where can they be?<br /><br />Okay, so I didn't go into The Crazies thinking that I'd find a 5-star movie here, but, man, have movies been mostly subpar for the last year (several years?) or what? I mean I think that I gave <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00275EGX8">The Hurt Locker</a> 5 stars, but prior to that I honestly can't remember the last movie that I rated 5 stars. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AVCFK6">Star Trek</a> maybe? And even 5 stars for those were generous. Anyway, I digress....<br /><br />So with The Crazies you have a remake of an apparent George A. Romero original that surprisingly I'd never seen or even heard of. Not surprisingly The Crazies has a government conspiracy gone awry that turns ordinary people into crazed loonies (like zombies). Surprisingly they got a great talent like Timothy Olyphant to sign on for the lead in the film and he is a stand out. Not surprisingly one man does not a great movie make, and The Crazies falls apart by its finish with the notion that the government will not only commit mass atrocities of epic proportions on its own soil but would be able to keep it all on the down-low from us silly citizens.<br /><br />The Crazies does have its creepy moments though. I admit that I was entertained. And Olyphant and even costar Radha Mitchell turned in excellent performances; they saved the movie from being utterly unbelievable and silly. And hey, I can do silly. But you don't want the silly label unless you're trying to be silly, right? Like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002KQNL8">Return of the Living Dead Part II</a> (Remember? Brains! Brainnnns!) was trying to be silly so it worked. Good silly. You don't want bad silly. Olyphant and Mitchell saved The Crazies from bad silly.<br /><br />Check out The Crazies if you're into the genre and you've got nothing better in your queue, but just don't expect <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VDDWEC">28 Days Later</a>. If you must have a Romero remake that's excellent, I'd recommend Tom Savini's 1991 version of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000K3TO">Night of the Living Dead</a>.</p></br><a href="../users/AGVWTYW0ULXHT.html">AGVWTYW0ULXHT</a><br/><p>This relatively small-scale remake of George Romero's low-budget thriller manages to deliver a few thrills, here and there, but never manages to do much that is truly inventive or original, and certainly never manages to convince me that a remake of the ultra low-budget original was necessary.  When the local drunk goes crazy with a gun at the local ballpark, and an ordinary man goes bonkers and burns his house down with the family locked inside, the local sheriff begins to suspect a pattern.  When a downed airplane is discovered in the local water supply, he figures out, connecting the dots perhaps too quickly to leave us in suspense, there must have been some kind of contaminant aboard.  Of course we know already the military's involved because from the first scene we have been shown that every significant "crazy" event has been monitored by satellite and other military surveillance.  The first thing that bugged me about the remake is that what's happening is so easily explained, early on, as the result of a military experiment gone awry.  Of course we don't yet know the details, but the thrill of discovery is denied us.  (I don't consider that a spoiler, since the premise of the film is familiar, and I'm only saying that the film gives away too much too soon - in a way, I'm saying the film itself spoiled a lot of what could have been interesting about it, too early on.)<br /><br />For example, one intriguing element the film touches upon but never develops, is that the "craziness" alluded to in the title might in some instances just be an extreme version of the (perhaps) ordinarily bizarre and slightly psychopathic behavior of small-town disorderliness, the kind of minor illegality and extremism that a sane sheriff would know well enough to overlook for the most part.  (For a more original film that explores the possibility that small town extremism and psychopathia might border upon each other, see the very cool Canadian zombie flick <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002TZS5G0">Pontypool</a>).  Drunken disorderliness turned vicious, for example, or the local poachers, who take advantage of the chaos to hunt some unconventional "game."  The cool thing about the premise is that these aren't zombies - they're not dead and they're not mindless - but the virus turns them into psychopathic versions of themselves, themselves without a conscience and with an impulse to hurt.  This version didn't explore or exploit that dimension as much as it could have.  I think it would have been much more effective to keep things unexplained and play up this element a bit longer, so that for a day or two you let Tim Olyphant as sheriff actually try to figure this out and let Radha Mitchell as his wife and local doctor come up with theories until they're over their heads and the escalation of ordinary people's everyday quirks into violence can no longer be explained away.  Only then would reinforcements come and only then would it become clear what they're dealing with and only then would it become clear that the military was aware.  I liked <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010X745K">The Mist</a> better, where the local craziness was the focus at first and only late in the game did the larger stakes become clear.<br /><br />The performances were satisfactory, but the lines they spoke tended to be the product of mostly uninspired writing.  They said the obvious things, or voiced the emotional content of scenes that should have (and usually were) already been carried by the acting and the editing.  The one character who really stood out for me was that of Joe Anderson, the Deputy who easily upstaged Tim Olyphant in every scene they shared, especially as the situation went from bad to much worse.  I'd never seen him in anything before, but after this I'm convinced he could easily carry a film and will look for his future work.  The editing and look was fine, and the filmmakers had obviously seen a lot of horror films and borrowed liberally from the most intense moments (e.g. a guy drags a pitchfork that you know he's going to use to inflict violence, and the sound itself is both grating and horrifying - and which is, depending on how you look at it, a pretty direct steal from or homage to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001B1UO7G">Blood Simple</a>). On the other hand, there are a few fresh images here that had my heart pumping and my eyes intrigued - a scene in a car wash comes to mind, that was richly executed.  The ending was utterly predictable.  My wife predicted it about ten minutes into the film.  Still, it's not bad and could have been much worse.  Not bad, but not likely to attain classic status.</p></br><a href="../users/A17LEYMZI8OYOQ.html">A17LEYMZI8OYOQ</a><br/><p>As somebody who is not a fan of zombie movies or, for that matter, horror films in general, I must admit that I did enjoy this remake of the 1973 George A. Romero "classic," which I have never seen.<br /><br />Director Breck Eisner and screenwriters Scott Kosar and Ray Wright have created an atmospheric, fast-paced, rather intelligent thriller with three-dimensional characters that evokes more memories of Holocaust movies rather than the films of George A. Romero.<br /><br />The most frightening aspect of this movie is the military, and the way that they treat the people of the affected town.  Had it not been for the uniforms, at times I would have thought that I was watching scenes from SCHINDLER'S LIST.<br /><br />Yes, there are zombies, but they are not the mindless kind that you find in Romero's NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD.  Nor, are they part of a flesh eating "army".<br /><br />These creatures are your friends and neighbors, your husbands and wives, whose exposure to this strange toxin has turned them into killers.  That makes them all the more terrifying.<br /><br />One man, for example, locks his wife and young son in an upstairs closet, and then sets the house afire.<br /><br />The action sequences are very well executed and, I must admit that during the movie, I did jump in my seat more than once.<br /><br />?

Romero<br /><br />DIRECTED BY: Breck Eisner<br /><br />Rated: R<br />Genre: Horror<br />Release Date: 26 February 2010<br />Review Date: 22 March 2010<br /><br />I never thought I would say this about a horror film, but here I think I have to; they may have made the characters too interesting! I'm serious. I really enjoyed all of the characters a great deal. They were all well acted, well cast and had a ton of depth and believability to them. So my only question is - why didn't the zombies?<br /><br />Typically in these types of films (which I usually love), the characters are two dimensional and the film relies on the blood and gore to keep its heart pumping. Sadly, I would have preferred that in this case, because these zombies were crap!<br /><br />The only reason that I even understand that they were supposed to be zombies, is because that's what everyone else has been referring to them as, and their make-up looks like what we'd find in any zombie flick. They were not at all the traditional living dead that I'm familiar with. They were not scary; they were just lame and annoying. I can appreciate that the filmmakers where obviously trying something different here with these zombies, and I have yet to see the original film, so maybe this is what people will expect and or appreciate. It just wasn't for me.<br /><br />Our two main characters are played to a strong capital T, by two of the most underrated actors in Hollywood. Timothy Olyphant plays Sherriff David Dutton, and Radha Mitchell plays his wife Judy. They live in a small town in Iowa, where everyone seems to know everyone, and understandably so.<br /><br />While in the middle of a baseball game, David has a standoff with a local who has a history of being drunk, as he stumbles onto the filed with a shotgun. After David has to kill the man to defend himself, we realize something is wrong and so does David. This guy was a little crazy, you see. Soon others around town start acting a little crazy too, and before we know it, the Military shows up to put everyone under quarantine.<br /><br />Even after having watched the film, I still am unclear as to how exactly it is that you become infected with this virus that turns you into one of these so-called zombies. The film mentions that it stems from drinking contaminated water, which I got, as this is obviously explained to us. But how come one of the main characters goes `beep' when the military scans her with their `zombie detector' and she never turns? How come one of the other main characters starts to show some symptoms of being `crazy', but we never knew (at least to my recollection) that he drank from the water? And why has it taken him so much longer to develop symptoms than the others? I may be overanalyzing a film that's not worthy of it, but I'm only doing so because this film had the potential to be a lot more.<br /><br />It certainly has its moments. The scene that took place in David and Judy's upstairs room was classic horror; I loved the bit with the knife. The scene in the carwash was gore-tastic and thrilling and the sequence with the run-away electric meat slicer put a smile on my face as well. But the zombies man! Come on, does no-one else agree with me that they were just plain boring? They didn't even make sense!<br /><br />They were all different levels of crazy and sometimes killed people, started fires and even went so far as to tie people up while taking them hostage. Seriously? Zombies tying people up? WOW. Why stop there? Why not show the zombies having a picnic by a lake, or why not have them waiting in line at the town's movie theater to go see Dawn of the Dead? Either of these ridiculous ideas would have fit right in.<br /><br />It's also one of those horror movies where even though you love the characters, you want to slap them for doing stupid things. How many more times could David have possibly left his wife alone somewhere with zombies running around? And why did they agree to let their friend walk behind them, at his request I might add, when he began to turn into one of the undead? At the very least they could have allowed him to walk ahead of them couldn't they?<br /><br />Its movies like this that make you feel for actors who hopefully were directed to do these idiotic things. Even if they weren't, it's not their fault it's in the final version of the film.</p></br><a href="../users/A18G7GG53G2X8A.html">A18G7GG53G2X8A</a><br/><p>I suppose I can't fault "The Crazies" for delivering exactly what it promised: Screaming victims, bloody deaths, scary things hiding in the dark, and, of course, crazy people. But there really isn't anything new here. It's a remake of the 1973 film directed by George A. Romero, which itself has similarities to his own "Night of the Living Dead" and would go on to inspire its apocalyptic sequels, also directed by Romero (some of which have already been remade, and you'll forgive me if I'm belaboring the point). It's a typical zombie story set in a typical Middle American farming community inhabited by typical white-bred people, some of whom are given that distinctive Southern drawl for maximum effect. This definitely includes the trigger-happy rednecks that shoot at zombies for no reason other than the sheer joy of it.<br /><br />The town is Ogden Marsh, Iowa. Population: 1,260. It's one of those places where the people earn a living and life is simple. In due time, things start to go wrong. Some of the residents act ... funny. At first, it doesn't seem so bad; they space out pretty easily, and maybe they'll repeat something they just said a second earlier. But then, for no apparent reason, they begin to bleed all over, and what's worse, they become homicidal maniacs. What's causing this epidemic of insanity? The local sheriff, David Dutton (Timothy Olyphant) and his deputy, Russell Clank (Joe Anderson), have reason to believe that the local water supply is to blame. Maybe it has been contaminated with an unknown toxin.<br /><br />Before long, the military gets involved. Well armed and merciless, the soldiers are not too far off from the zombies they're trying to quarantine - they're violent, single-minded, and anonymous, their faces obscured by dark gas masks while they relentlessly follow someone else's orders via walkie-talkies. The remaining residents of Ogden Marsh are rounded up and taken to a makeshift medical ward, where people are forcefully separated on the basis of whether or not someone has an elevated temperature. Sheriff Dutton's wife, Judy (Radha Mitchell), falls into the second category, and she's taken away despite Dutton's assertion that she's pregnant and prone to slight fevers. She soon finds herself strapped to a stretcher in an area designated for the already infected. Unfortunately, an attempted jailbreak results in some of the crazies escaping, and one of them is headed straight for Judy, a bloody pitchfork dragging behind him.<br /><br />It soon becomes a matter of survival, David, Judy, Russell, and a teenager named Becca (Danielle Panabaker) pitted against an illness and a brutal military presence. Can they escape Ogden Marsh? Will they become infected? Will they be shot dead before they have the chance to become infected? And what is the secret of this plague? Where did it come from? How did it come to be there? The answers to all of the above are given, but I seriously doubt you'll find any of them surprising.<br /><br />Still, if you haven't yet grown tired of the zombie genre, then chances are "The Crazies" will not disappoint you. Indeed, it's a striking visual achievement, some of the most frightening scenes taking place in cramped, shadowy spaces. I also give the filmmakers credit for creating gore effects that aren't relentlessly campy. There's a sequence, for example, in which a crazed mortician starts wielding a working bone saw; I expected a retread of the morgue sequence from "Re-Animator," but instead, I got a dark and fairly unnerving moment of bloody violence. Another sequence, this one involving a crazy and a can of gasoline, is surprisingly chilling and not at all a cheap gimmick that plays for laughs.<br /><br />It's simply a matter of having seen so many movies like this before. Everything from Romero's films to "28 Days Later" to "Doomsday" to "Quarantine" to the "Resident Evil" trilogy have told more or less the exact same story to varying degrees of success. Quite frankly, it's starting to get old.<br /><br />The final thirty minutes of "The Crazies" are problematic in that every scene feels like the finale; a resolution is overshadowed by another crisis, which is then resolved before leading to another crisis, etc., etc. More than once I was ready to get out of my seat and leave the theater, and more than once I was hit with a new turn of events. How many twists does one movie need? And why should they be allowed to spill over into the end credits, at which point it becomes overkill? I guess horror audiences have come to expect nothing less. I can't say that I hated or even disliked "The Crazies," for it succeeds at being exactly what it wanted to be. Maybe, somewhere deep down, I was hoping it would surpass my expectations. There are few things more satisfying than a film that delivers more than it promises.</p></br><a href="../users/A9NCQGVV5W8N0.html">A9NCQGVV5W8N0</a><br/><p>America, The Present: Sheriff David Dutton (Timothy Olyphant) lives an idyllic existence in the small heartland town of Ogden Marsh with his wife (and town physician) Judy (Radha Mitchell); Ogden Marsh is one of those kinds of small-towns that only seems to exist in horror movies these days, if it had a soundtrack it would be "Fanfare For The Common Man"; if it was a book, it would be written by Garrison Keillor. Whilst attending the first day of the spring baseball season, Sheriff Dutton is confronted by an apparently disoriented local man who wanders out onto the Diamond wielding a shotgun.  The Sheriff is unfortunately obligated to use what police forces all over the world choose to refer to as "lethal force" in order to stop the man. But this is just the first in a series of incidents in which apparently otherwise sane members of the town's citizenry succumb to bizarre fits of mania and, before long, the Duttons find themselves caught in the middle of an escalating epidemic of insanity...<br /><br />Horror film remakes are always a dubious quantity. In my experience, the better ones generally tend to mine the concept and the strengths of the original and rework them in a way that puts a new spin on an old standard (Zack Snyder's excellent remake of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002ABURA">Dawn of the Dead (Widescreen Unrated Director's Cut)</a> is an excellent example of this). Rather mystifyingly, the remake of "The Crazies" does rework the concept of George A. Romero's original film but chooses not to play to the original's strength (which was to devote just as much screen-time to the architects of the mania that have consumed the small town as to it's victims). The net effect of this reworking is that the eerie, verit&eacute; style, amateurish plausibility of the original is eschewed in favour of a series of rather boring sub-standard horror film clich&eacute;s and histrionics which will be familiar to anyone who has seen a horror film of this variety in the last forty years.<br /><br />Then there's "The Crazies" themselves: in my opinion, frankly, they're just not crazy enough.<br /><br />Maybe I've been spoiled by the likes of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TJBN8K">28 Weeks Later / 28 Days Later (2 pack)</a> and Garth Ennis' <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1592910904">Crossed Volume 1</a>, but I am firmly of the opinion that, if you're going to make a film about people becoming psychotic, homicidal maniacs, then the psychopathology and homicide with which you're concerned should actually be up there onscreen and in spades. The first ten minutes of "28 Weeks Later" had me on the edge of my seat (and I remained perched there for more or less the entire running time of that film) but I found myself suppressing yawns of boredom at the tedious antics of the so-called slavering maniacs in this film.<br /><br />Performances are negligible. Timothy Olyphant recycles his stiff-legged Seth Bullock walk from "Deadwood"; Radha Mitchell does her usual sweaty, screaming blonde bit; a chap called Jeff Anderson outshines them both in his role as a goateed Sheriff's Deputy, but no one else really stands out in any way shape or form.<br /><br />"The Crazies" is a missed opportunity. The kind of film you're likely to fall asleep during if you decide to watch it on TV late at night. About the only thing that raises it above a one-star review are some decent production values and a superbly eerie score by "Hitcher" composer Mark Isham.<br /><br />If you're a connoisseur of this kind of film, my advice is to give this one a miss...</p></br><a href="../users/AER15RIMV8E6D.html">AER15RIMV8E6D</a><br/><p>I thought this movie was a lot better than the 1973 original. I don't hate the original, but I found it really boring. This movie was more suspenseful and creepy. A toxin by the name of Trixie contaminates the water of Ogden Marsh, a small farming town in Iowa. Soon, everybody starts becoming crazy and killing each other. Some are not infected, such as David and Judy Dutton. The Government comes and quarantines almost everybody to stop the disease from spreading. Throughout the film, David and Judy try to avoid the Government and kill any crazy people that get in their way. If you wanna get down with the sickness, you may enjoy THE CRAZIES!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A6DOCZ10B7JAJ.html">A6DOCZ10B7JAJ</a><br/><p>t took nearly four decades, but finally Hollywood threw The Crazies a bone.  With a budget of 20 million (compared to the meager $275,000 in the original), this remake gnaws on some more fleshed-out ideas than the early 70's gem could offer.  It injects a very believable threat while exposing a provocative element of fear.  Although far from perfect, this doomsday thriller is nicely shot and unleashes some horrific moments upon the audience.<br /><br />Although the virus outbreak dilemma has spread through countless movies over the years, few have the same sort of tense, spine-shattering images and predicaments.  Like American soldiers blindly obeying orders to kill.  Crowds being quarantined and transported like cattle.  Suspicions arising and distrust rampant amongst the entire town.  Just mass chaos as all lingering hope is brutally crushed.  This has some great kill scenes, like impalement by pitchfork, flesh-burning by blowtorch, and the threat of a circular saw.  Probably not for the squeamish.<br /><br />Unfortunately this movie eventually suffers from the typical Hollywood infection.  Hard to ward that off in a big budget release.  Nothing too preposterous I guess, just the normal last-second bravado that seems highly unlikely.  There are some other minor plot holes littered here and there.  Slightly irritating, but not too bad.<br /><br />Highly recommended to the casual horror fan.  Plus you Crazies will probably enjoy it.</p></br></body></html>

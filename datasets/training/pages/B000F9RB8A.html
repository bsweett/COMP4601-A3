It is a good mix of action-fantasy, comedy, mysticism and crime caper. I have seen a lot of foreign films from asia and I have to say this film is among my favorites.<br />The movie is not just a action wacky comedy, at times it shows its soul, and delivers a good message to audiences: Everyone deserves a second chance, and do not underestimate your own true potential. Stephen Chow really does have a profound respect for KUNG-FU. It has the humor of looney tunes and the dark humor of Quintin Tarantino films. The movie reveals the hidden mysticism of Kung-Fu, I for one do not like movies with too much wire work, with exaggerated fight scenes but this was done decently, YUEN WOO-PING(KILL BILL, THE MATRIX, HERO) is an excellent fight choreographer. Those fighting styles really does exist in Martial arts, however a bit exaggerated. I've seen SHAOLIN MONKS do perform the Buddhist Palm, the toad technique, the five shaolin kicks etc. The movie does praise the Chinese Martial Arts at the same time adapted it to a very entertaining screenplay.<br />The story is about people who live in the poorest part of the city, who unintentionally gets mixed up with the foremost crime gang at the time, the Axe gang. The criminals got more than they bargained for when they had to deal with 5 Masters who only wanted to live in peace. There is also death and despair but I don't want to spoil it for anyone else. To sum it up, near the end, a true KUNG-FU master was revealed.<br />The fight scenes were humorously great and the last battle with the ultimate killer was short but awesome. Yeh-Baby!! The CGI effects was also pretty good and fits the atmosphere of the movie.<br />The bottom line is: ENJOY THE MOVIE, you are in for quite a RIDE. This is not a movie for people who think they can only appreciate intelligent movies. I saw it 5 times and I haven't gotten tired of it.<br />The dvd quality is great. It contains bothe subtitled and Dubbed versions. However, I prefer the movie with subtitles. The script is much more effective than the Dubbed version. Picture and sound quality are outstanding!!</p></br><a href="../users/A2J57EQ9KPGXR9.html">A2J57EQ9KPGXR9</a><br/><p>This film is a rare bird indeed, worthy of all the hype. Fantastic fight scenes and legitimately funny moments are combined in this film to create an incredibly entertaining film. The "hair fire" scene alone is worth the price of the DVD.<br /><br /> There are alot of bad films out there, Kung Fu Hustle is not one of them.</p></br><a href="../users/A109LWN9DUGPDP.html">A109LWN9DUGPDP</a><br/><p>This was is a terrific movie very original as the front of the dvd says "Kill Bill meets Looney Toones" I would say thats accurate I knew this film would be good but didnt really expect to get cought up in it like a did.Besides for the the great fight scenes the cgi great but the characters are teffiffic.I've seen the dvd version already and its great the picture and sound are really good and also the special features include a 30 min. interview with director Stephen Chow for american audiences plus a 45 min making of documentary,Really good stuff Buy IT.</p></br><a href="../users/A39W3263A9HCMN.html">A39W3263A9HCMN</a><br/><p>I saw this movie and it was the best foreign movie I've ever seen! It's in Chinese with eng. subbies and It was hilarious!!! It stars Stephen Chow (who was in Shaolin Soccer) and it has a great cast!!!!! It has choppy (but amusing) s/fx, and the humor and action is the TOPS. But Storyline?? I really can't review that cuz I really didn't find it that amusing. But this was a great show.<br /><br />P.S. As cses44 said, Why is it rated R? I don't get that. But overall, It was a great movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1SPB225CVTRUU.html">A1SPB225CVTRUU</a><br/><p>Having seen Stephen Chow gone from goofy TV star in the late '80s, to becoming the king of comedy of Hong Kong with a long list of box office hits since the early '90s, it's great to see him combining jokes, outlandish special effects, and Kung Fu in this film that is by far his most entertaining work, even better than Shaolin Soccer. This is no doubt Granddaddy Sing's(his nickname) most ambitious movie, since it had already conquered the box office in all Chinese cinemas as well in most Asian countries. Finally, his movie is getting to be launched in North America in wide release. Let's see if it'll kick ass like Hero and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.<br /><br />Since I have already acquired Sing(Stephen Chow's) style of comedy and action for film, I know it's not going to be a Jackie Chan or Jet Li kind of action/comedy. He's very much on a league of his own, so he's got something different to offer the foreign audiences. Fans of Jim Carrey will very likely dig Sing's movie, because the two actors have been compared a lot.<br /><br />The movie is about the war between The Axe Gang and The Pig Sty Alley, and Sing is pretending to be an amateur while seeking<br /> to become a member of the Axe Gang. There are some very powerful retired masters of Kung Fu Warriors living as normal residents in The Pig Sty Alley. The Tailor, The Coolie(handyman), and The Baker all have great power and skills, but have not use them until the intrusion of The Axe Gang. They defeated the gang effortlessly. The Axe Gang then hired The # 1 Killers(two men who use musical instrument to produce deadly melodies as their weapon) to fight against the Alley. Just when they had defeated the three defendents of the Valley, The Landlord and his wife The LandLady came out to show them some serious kung fu. The Landlord's special power is his body movement that can be bent like elastic, so his opponent cannot hit him easily. As for The Landlady, she can ran like a motorcycle, and her ultimate power is her voice(a skill known as The Lion's Roar). Sing was hired by the Gang to go help The Beast escape the mental Assylum, so that he can fight against The Alley. The Beast was known to be the best of the best in the world of kung fu, and he was in the Assylum because he had defeated everyone already. The Landlady and The Landlord were caught off guard when The Beast appeared. They thought they were the best in kung fu, and now they have to face the enemy of a life time. Who will save them if they failed?<br /><br />Wah Yuen(Landlord) and Qiu Yuen(Landlady) are very good together, and they delivered the laughs and great battle scenes. Qiu Yuen is actually very striking, espeically when she had the funniest lines and a outrageous personality. Other supporting players including the goofy Gang Leader(Danny Chan), and Tailor provided with some funny moments. The scene when Tailor was prancing around wearing a pair of red underwear seen through in a pair transparent pants, and got mocked by Landlady was a comic relief. The Lollipop Girl was unerexposed here, and I was expecting to see her practicing some special candy power, but she's just Sing's love interest. The action direction from renowned martial arts veteran Yuen Woo Ping certainly made the fight scenes over-the-top here. Along with a ton of special effects, it's very captivating, even if it looked kind of cartoonish at times.<br /><br />Stephen Chow didn't totally dominate the movie like his other films, and he allowed the supporting cast enough screentime, so that the group scenes are worthwhile. In fact, I didn't find him to be as funny as his previous films. He's more serious, and his fight scenes have improved a great deal, considered that he's not an action star.</p></br><a href="../users/AUHG8KSHI529U.html">AUHG8KSHI529U</a><br/><p>This is one fun and strange flick.  I think it is best described as Kung Fu meets the Road Runner and The Matrix.  It has some wonderful visual effects, a fun story that keeps you guessing, and some downright silly fun along with a kind of violence that is so stylized that you don't really get all that upset.<br /><br />One example of a great visual is when one of our heroes is walking down a dark alley and we see a cat up on a wall.  As he walks by we see the cat jump out of frame, but if you watch its shadow on the wall you see it fall into two halves (and understand what that means) as a flying sword comes into frame.<br /><br />So much is not what it seems in this movie with so many inversions of roles that I found myself just sitting back and wondering what could be thrown at me next.<br /><br />Now, the movie is in Chinese with English subtitles.  I don't mind them at all.  But if you speak Chinese you won't need them.  But if you don't understand Chinese and hate subtitles you will be cheated if you miss this movie because of them.  Really, after a few minutes, you simply won't care.</p></br><a href="../users/A268EEWUXYCA8Q.html">A268EEWUXYCA8Q</a><br/><p>I think Roger Ebert said it best by stating that Kung Fu Hustle (the latest from actor/director/screenwriter Stephen Chow) is a mix of Jackie Chan, Buster Keaton, Quentin Tarantino and Bugs Bunny.  If that combination makes you laugh then you will undoubtably love this movie.<br /><br />The beginning brilliantly sets up the antagonists by showing how ruthless and bloodthirsty they are before going to the beginning credits and having the Axe Gang then dance to the music.  It's a wonderful beginning, showing the dichotomy of a ruthless gang that dances like they belong in a musical.  Very funny.<br /><br />When the movie begins in earnest, we are introduced to Pig Sty Alley where poor people are scrambling to live day by day.  Stephen Chow populates his area with wonderful characters who are hillariously funny and different from each other.  They all have motives, sometimes hidden, and it makes watching them quite humorous.<br /><br />But what Kung Fu Hustle does best is play with the martial arts conventions.  Like Wuxia films, the characters possess supernatural abilities to send swords flying by playing instruments and other plot spoiling devices.  But unlike some Wuxia films like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, they are taken to the extreme as a sort of satire of the genre while at the same time embracing everything wonderful about those films.  The martial arts are spot on, having been done by the wonderful choreographer of The Matrix and Kill Bill Woo-ping Yuen.  Yet unlike those films and again in touch with the style of the movie, the action is playful.<br /><br />The violence is over the top, stylized with sequenes that remind us of the Looney Tunes cartoons.  In fact, Stephen Chow incorporates a lot of homages to American Cinema with quotes in line with Spider Man and the Matrix and even a sound sampling from the Matrix in a couple scenes.  It's funny to catch.<br /><br />Overall a terrific film that incorporates Oriental cinema with Western cinema.  Brilliantly shot, written and acted, it successfully merges many totally disparate genres into a movie that satirizes, makes homages to, and transcends the martial arts genres.  Absolutely wonderful a must see for all fans.</p></br><a href="../users/AD7IBJCYSJ9EE.html">AD7IBJCYSJ9EE</a><br/><p>Ha, ha! I just seen this yesterday. It was HALARIOUS!<br /><br /> Basically, the plot is simple: Man wants to be cool, joins gang, you know! But although lacking plot, it will bust your gut! It's a kung-fu comedy!<br /><br /> It's foreign with subtitles, so if you don't like reading, don't watch it!<br /><br /> It tickles as many ribs as it breaks! So "Hustle" to your nearest theatre and see this!<br /><br /> PS: Why is it rated R? The action is just slapstick.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VABWDOUQLULZ.html">A1VABWDOUQLULZ</a><br/><p>The best Chinese spaghetti western ever!  It's way offbeat, but it was really funny.  I never cease to be amazed at how the Chinese film industry balks at showing any kind of sexual interaction but doesn't flinch at showing a person taking a dump on the stoop of their flat.  Ah well.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NIQK6ZLYEP1L.html">A3NIQK6ZLYEP1L</a><br/><p>Kung Fu Hustle has the humor, plot and characters of a silly manga.  Kung Fu fighting, dancing mobsters, silly cartoon style chase scenes and slum lords.  What more could you want?  How about commentary by the director and some of the cast, a behind-the-scenes feature, outtakes and bloopers along with some deleted scenes?  If that isn't enough we get an interview with Stephen Chow himself.  Remember, it is not for kids and the English dubbing sucks, so watch the subtitles.<br /><br />Get it used or new, but do get it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2A6NH6DPE0VXR.html">A2A6NH6DPE0VXR</a><br/><p>Kun-fu Hustle is a fun martial arts comedy. With how cartoonish it can be, I guess you can call it a fantasy as well. Even if you are tired of Kun-fu movies you should be entertained by this movie. It has the style of an old black and white movie in some ways. It sort of reminded me of a Buster Keaton movie is some ways. I mean by the comedy, not the martial arts of course.<br /><br />  You have a lady with curlers in her hair that can run as fast  as  the road runner and who's main power is her screaming. Also scrawny looking guys who are really great warriors. One of the funniset scenes takes place when  Stephen Chow challenges some town people to a fight. He wants to prove himself worthy to a badass gang. Anyway each person he chooses that look wimpy turn out to be covered in muscles. Even a little kid that he challenges, is ripped. The movie is great fun and good for a laugh even if the final battle is overly silly and not as funny as it could've been.</p></br><a href="../users/A370Z6I5GBWU44.html">A370Z6I5GBWU44</a><br/><p>This is not a 'serious' kung fu film such as 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon', but it is awesome. There's great kung fu scenes in here and funny dialogue, and a great cast of characters with some cool lines and actions. I have to say that my favorite character in the entire movie is the landlady.<br /><br />I only have one quibble - I would have loved to see the cute deaf girl deliver some kung-fu action at the ending, since I felt that her forgiveness was too easy. It would have been cool to see her deliver some cool moves and kick him around before she took his hand. The 'Palm of Buddha' was an awesome move, and if it were real, wow! Overall a great and funny movie with the right mix of comedy and action.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GMUNBN9HKRZS.html">A2GMUNBN9HKRZS</a><br/><p>For me this is one of the most clever and funny films I'v seen in many years. For all it's cartoonist qualities there are still many touching scenes with emotional depth. I'v shown this film to many friends, and during viewing once they "get it" where this film is coming from it's fun to watch them giggle, guffaw and bust out in laughter. It's very "Chinese" and universal at the same time. Watch it!</p></br><a href="../users/A2UUP58XPQW3GF.html">A2UUP58XPQW3GF</a><br/><p>Kung Fu Hustle is among my favorite films, not because I am a die-hard fan of Stephen Chow, but because I really liked the wild mix of comedy, adventure, crime caper and martial arts action. Most notably the excellent fight choreography by legendary Yuen Woo-Ping(who is also responsible for the fight scenes of  Kill Bill vol. 1, Fearless, The Matrix, Hero). As I said, I love KUNG FU HUSTLE and am very much looking forward for its sequel in 2008, so forgive me if I am a bit biased. (I will try my best not to lose my objectivity)<br /><br />The New "AXE KICKING EDITION" soon to be released by Sony is actually the REGION-3 Hong Kong release which I have. (I am certain)The Hong Kong release is still the one to go for if you have a multi-region dvd player. Since I almost know for certain that only fans of the film will be interested in this new edition, I will skip the plot summary. ( for those of you who haven't seen it, you may look up my review under the original U.S. DVD.)<br /><br />I will go straight to the differences between the previous dvd release and this new "Axe-kicking edition"(original Hong Kong release):<br />Mild spoilers ahead---<br /> Scene 1; The landlady throws her husband out of a window and drops a flower pot that ended up on the back of his head. The original cut showed a small pool of blood coming from his face, but the U.S. version digitally omitted it. The blood now appears as part of the film.<br />Scene 2; Sing heckles/insults the residents of Pig Sty Alley and gets hit in the tummy by a woman. The original cut showed Sing spitting up blood which landed on the woman's face, but the earlier U.S. version digitally removed the blood (though some still appeared around Sing's mouth). The blood now appears in this release.<br />Scene 3; This may be more offensive to others; it takes place on the eve of the big attack on Pig Sty Alley. The Hong Kong cut showed a man taking a d--p onto a piece of paper as the camera panned by, but the American version digitally removed the offensive feces. Now the paper is no longer blank. "Mr. Poo" makes an appearance!<br />Scene 4; Sing confronts "The Beast" in the casino, he gets hit hard on the chest twice. After the 2nd hit, blood sprays on The Beast's face and Sing is shown reeling backwards from the force of the punch with blood spurting from his mouth. The U.S. version PREVIOUSLY removed both of these sequential shots.<br />Scene 5; Also in the casino, Sing's head is hit on his face, hammered into the ground by The Beast. After the first hit, The Beast's bloody fist is shown emerging from the floor in slow motion...but the U.S. version removed this shot entirely.<br />Now for the DVD Picture and Sound quality--<br />2.35 Anamorphic Widescreen. The Picture is extremely sharp with solid Black levels. Colors are natural and enhancements are not noticeable. CGI effects suffer a bit of softness. But the transfer is clean and nice. It is the Hong Kong transfer from what I can tell.<br />Sound is in 5.1 Dolby/2.0 surround in English, French & Cantonese. I am a bit disappointed why Sony still didn't include the Cantonese 5.1 DTS track as in the original Hong Kong release. Why?!<br />EXTRAS: Stephen Chow interview--Bloopers/outtakes--Featurettes: w/ Yuen Woo-Ping, Oliver Wong(Production designer), Shirley Wong(Costumes)<br />Storyboard comparison--trailers--audio commentary<br />CLOSING: Kung Fu Hustle is one of the more entertaining (if not the most fun in 2004) imports. It mixes pop culture blends, over-the-top comedy, hard-hitting action while maintaining a profound respect for the spirit of Kung Fu. This new region 1 release is a bit confusing, while it contains the original cut of the film, it misses the original special features and the powerful DTS Cantonese Language track. I wouldn't advise a "double dip" for fans who own the first REGION 1 dvd, but for fans who doesn't own the movie, pick this new version up. However, the lack of DTS sound is a huge minus for this version. I STILL prefer the ORIGINAL Hong Kong region-3 release!<br />RECOMMENDED!! (Timidly)</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>Stephen Chow's follow-up to 'Shaolin Soccer' (which was virtually killed in US market) is totally different from 'Shaolin.'  'Kung-hu' is a comedy, sure it is, but the star/director Chow takes this martial arts very seriously, and the film itself gives more emphasis upon martial arts actions (including silly ones) than the parodies or sight gags.  And look, the film is credited with TWO choreographers -- Sammo Hung and Yuen Wo Ping!<br /><br />[THE STORY] is set in pre-Revolutiona China.  The city is ruled by ruthless mobsters 'Axe Gang,' and now remember, they are really ruthless.  Even though they dance like 'Cotton Club'-Meets-'Gangs of New York' style.  And of course, they wield axes while dancing in the street.<br /><br />Then our hero Sing (Chow) enters.  He wants to join in the 'Axe Gangs,' and to prove his 'ability' as gangster (whatever it is), he tries to extort money from the locals living in the 'Pig Sty Alley.'  What he didn't know was, the people are much, much more strong and resourceful than he expected.<br /><br />The plot may sound rather pointless, and in fact it is.  In short, it is about two wannabe gangsters, and the fights between gangsters and the residents of the 'Alley.'  You see several references to other films, but the film's greatest merit is not them.  It is kung-hu action.<br /><br />[ACTIONS] For Stephen Chow shows unexpectedly exciting fight sequences between the unique characters -- assassins who use musical instruments like invisible swords (and this scene is very violent), the tailor and cook who fight like devil, the Landlord and Landlady, and The Beast ... yes, he fight like a beast, or a toad (literally).<br /><br />[THE STAR] Stephen Chow as hero Sing displays considerable martial arts skills, especially in the finaly act which goes like the climax of 'Matrix Revolutions' -- and Chow is better than Keanu! -- but it is the extraordinary supporting actors that really are rivetting.  The hen-pecked landlord by Yuen Wah (known as 'magnificient villain' in Hong Kong films) and his chain-smoking wife landlady by Yuen Qiu (coming back to screen after almost 30 years) are real scene stealer, always surprising us with their outrageous personalities.  And wait for 'The Beast' by Leung Siu Lung (himself a major Kung-hu star during the 70s, and comes back to movie after 15 year hietus) whose initial appearance as a bald and plump middle-aged is very deceptive.  And look for Yeun Cheung-Yan (as a suspicious-looking seller of 'kung-hu manuals'), brother to Yuen Woo Ping and action choreographer of 'Charlie's Angles.'<br /><br />The film may not as funny (and silly) as 'Shaolin Soccer' and if so, that's because Stephen Chow really respects the art of kung-hu and its masters.  It is still a comedy, and it is often funny, but perhaps you should see it as an action film -- with ridiculously exaggerated fight styles based on the traditional kung-hu.  So, my advice: Don't think, just feel, and enjoy yourself.</p></br><a href="../users/A21B2TJBWCSK1R.html">A21B2TJBWCSK1R</a><br/><p>Fresh from the worldwide triumph of Shaolin Soccer, Stephen Chow surpassed its critical and commercial success with Kung Fu Hustle. He took the winning formula he perfected with his previous film and elevated it to a more ambitious scale. He also wisely decided to have Sony distribute his movie in North America instead of Miramax who notoriously bungled the release of Soccer. The results were a modest success because, unlike Miramax, Sony knew how to market Chow's movie.<br /><br />As he did with Shaolin Soccer, Chow uses CGI in very clever ways to express his ideas visually. The action sequences play out like live action Looney Tunes cartoons as he playfully pokes fun at over-the-top, pretentious action spectacles like The Matrix: Reloaded. Kung Fu Hustle is bursting at the seams with one hilarious visual gag after another. In one scene, Sing is chased by a grumpy, bossy peasant woman and they chase each other through the countryside like Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner. Chow understands that the enjoyment in watching his movies is reveling in the visual spectacle of them. His movie has the visual inventiveness of ten movies.<br /><br />Kung Fu Hustle is a movie about other movies. It playfully quotes from such diverse movies as Spider-Man and The Untouchables. One of the pleasures of watching this movie is to see what film it references next. Meanwhile, Kung Fu Hustle continues to top itself with one breathtaking action sequence after another, each one building up to the penultimate showdown. Chow's movie is so eager to please, such an unabashed celebration of movies that it makes the ones that come out of Hollywood every year look boring and outdated in comparison.<br /><br />There is an audio commentary by Stephen Chow, actor Lam Tze Chung, Axe Gang advisor Tin Kai Man and actor Chan Kwok Kwan. If you're reading the subtitles of this track it is near impossible to figure out who's talking and so you just have to go along with it in the hopes that some relevant information will appear on screen. They go into detail about the filmmaking process in this informative and engaging track.<br /><br />"TV Special - Behind the Scene of Kung Fu Hustle" is a 42 minute look at how this movie came together hosted by two of the film's stars. This is an entertaining and well-made featurette that is a step up from the usual fare that populates DVDs.<br /><br />There are two deleted scenes that feature the residents of Pig Sty Alley trying to convince the two kung fu masters to save them and more footage of Sing's initiation into the Axe Gang.<br /><br />"Ric Meyers Interview with Stephen Chow" is a nice conversation between the two men. He talks about some of the cinematic influences on this movie as he comes across as a very smart and articulate fellow.<br /><br />Also included is an "Outtakes and Bloopers" reel that is a very funny collection of blown lines.<br /><br />There is also an impressive collection of 15 TV spots!<br /><br />Finally, there is an "International Poster Exploration Gallery" that features all sorts of different designs adopting various styles and colour schemes.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PNTEDGMOLMOY.html">A2PNTEDGMOLMOY</a><br/><p>On the recommendation of a friend, I picked up Stephen Chow's "Kung-Fu Hustle" -- "It's a martial arts comedy," he said.  He may have committed the worst case of under-selling a product I've ever come across.<br /><br />"Kung-Fu Hustle" contains the most surprising, you'll-never-see-this-coming humor I've seen in a movie since I saw Steve Buscemi's leg (with sock) meeting its destiny in a woodchipper in the Coen brothers' "Fargo."  I will be brief, so as not to spoil any of the surprises for you, but without giving too much away, you will see subtle and not-so-subtle references to such moments as Sean Connery's death scene in "The Untouchables," the "hallway of blood" from "The Shining," the fight scenes from "The Matrix," and the Roadrunner versus Wile E. Coyote.<br /><br />Some movies, such as Stanley Tucci's "Big Night," just make you smile with their tone and general warmth.  I never thought I'd say that about a martial arts film, but from the moment the Axe Gang shows up in "Reservoir Dogs" apparel, kills a few gangsters, and then dances some fantastic mish-mash step/line dancing, I was enthralled with "Kung Fu Hustle."  Also, who can't love a movie mainly set in "Pig Sty Alley," ruled by the Landlady, a witty spoof of all "dragon lady" stereotypes.<br /><br />Avoid all reviews and spoilers for this movie -- while I expect "Kung Fu Hustle" will hold up on repeated viewings, I will never again be as surprised or thrilled as I was the first time I saw it.  A wonderful addition to the film library.</p></br><a href="../users/A16QODENBJVUI1.html">A16QODENBJVUI1</a><br/><p>Let's face it:  there is an irreducible silly element to many kung fu movies.  What Stephen Chow has managed to do in both SHAOLIN SOCCER and KUNG FU HUSTLE is take the silliness and raise it to the nth degree, creating some of the most marvelous parodies that I have ever seen.  What is amazing is that while he expertly picks out the more absurd elements of those films, his own films, though comedies are in fact far less silly than those films that intend to be far more serious.  A fruitful comparison is some American comedic parodies, such as JANE AUSTEN'S MAFIA, which never rises above silliness.  The comedy here in KUNG FU HUSTLE is broad, but it is never simply dumb.<br /><br />The story concerns the conflict between the Axe Gang in Shanghai and the residents of Pig Sty Alley.  The time is supposedly the forties before the Revolution, but it seems oddly ahistorical, a Shanghai that never really existed.  World War II seems never to have occurred or left a mark on the place and there is no hint of the Communist uprising that had been taking place since the thirties.  Still, the film has a believable period feel despite this.  A petty thief named Sing (played by the film's writer and director Stephen Chow) pretends to be a member of the Axe Gang and attempts to bully some residents of the slum.  This inadvertently pulls in the real Axe Gang, which descends on the community only to be turned back by three of the residents who turn out to be kung fun masters incognito.  The rest of the film consists of escalations in kung fun mastery as the Axe Gang brings in their own kung fu masters, until the end when one individual proves to be the greatest kung fun master of all.  This would all be insufferably dull except that every twist and turn is handled expertly by Chow.<br /><br />It should be noted that the two most elaborate fight scenes were directed by the great Sammo Hung, the legendary Hong Kong star and director perhaps best known in the United States for his highly underrated television series MARTIAL LAW.<br /><br />I think this film will appeal both to fans of Hong Kong cinema and to fans of the more surreal shaolin films.  Whether it will appeal to a wider audience I am unable to say, but I would urge those with even slightly open minds to give this a try.  If you enjoyed CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON or HERO, you would probably enjoy this highly accomplished parody.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>Shanghai, China, the 1930s.  The Axe Gang is taking over the town but is not interested in the poor slums. This leaves the residents of Pig Sty Alley to deal with their overbearing Landlady. One day, Sing (Stephen Chow) and his sidekick,  walk into the Alley and attempt to blackmail people there. When the residents of the tenement stand up to fight him, he reveals that he is part of the Axe Gang and signals for help. Gang members show up and the landlady and the tenement residents fight them off. The Axe Gang realizes that they have been called to help someone who is not a part of the gang, but Sing is desperate to become a member. Now that the gang and the residents of Pig Sty Alley have met, they can't back down from each other, fighting until one group is victorious. The leader of the Axe Gang realizes that he will not be able to fight them alone and brings in The Beast.<br /><br />"Kung Fu Hustle", written and directed by the star, Stephen Chow, is a fun, exhilarating, fast-paced film, borrowing elements from and paying homage to many other genres. Chow is clearly a filmmaker who loves films; he seems like a kid in a candy store. Now that he can make a film, how many different types of things can he get into the story? "Hustle" combines all of these elements in a way that is fresh and exciting.<br /><br />The opening sequence is a homage to police interrogation films and westerns. When the opposing sides face off on a dusty road, we are transported from Shanghai to the Wild West. The sky turns magenta and everybody faces off, preparing for a classic gun fight. This scene is very theatrical, comical and sets the tone for the remainder of the film. Of course, we aren't in the Old West and the leader of the Axe Gang uses an axe to prove his point and keep us firmly rooted in the world of kung-fu.<br /><br />The story is a framework for Chow to throw each and every trick in the book at the audience. After he introduces the Axe Gang, we then meet the residents of Pig Sty Alley. Landlord walks through the shops, receiving tributes and terrorizing everyone in a jovial way. Until he meets up with his wife, Landlady, who terrorizes her husband. Everyone in the Alley appears perfectly normal until Sing shows up.<br /><br />When the two groups meet, we learn that people have special skills that they hesitate to use, unless absolutely necessary. They will do anything to protect their lives and friends. This leads to a series of amusing, entertaining fights, in which their skills are comically enhanced by special effects. Chow deftly blends all of these elements together making them appear somehow natural. Amazing considering all of the special effects, cartoon style action and over the top acting. Once we have accepted that these things can happen in this universe, we can accept the behavior as it becomes more cartoonish and more outlandish.<br /><br />The story, while slight, is effective at creating a character that we can root for. Chow's Sing is just a guy looking to join the Axe Gang, but as he witnesses their brutality, he seems more drawn to the people of Pig Sty Alley. He realizes that their efforts to use their powers, only when absolutely necessary, to defend themselves, is the more responsible course of action. Throughout the film, we see glimpses of a pivotal moment in his childhood; he saves a deaf mute girl from a bunch of bullies and buys a book about kung-fu from a street beggar. Later, we learn that Sing may be the Chosen One. To live up to this prophecy, he has to make some changes in his life.<br /><br />All of these over-the-top, disparate elements combined together would normally create a mess of a film. In "Hustle", they come together to create a fun, enjoyable film that will hopefully spur filmmakers to come up with more creative ways to tell a story.</p></br><a href="../users/A5X1B2HBQUR3P.html">A5X1B2HBQUR3P</a><br/><p>(1) This one is a martial arts parody film co-written, co-produced, directed by and starring Stephen Chow.<br /><br />(2) The plot centers around a poor Hong_kong semi-slum locality which defies surrendering to the opressive axe gang who are known for their looting and oppression.<br /><br />(3) The Land Lord and land lady of this locality are superior kung-fu fighters which we come to know later on in the film<br /><br />(4) Stephen Chow plays an axe-member wannabe. He wants to be part of the axe gang.<br /><br />(5) There are 3 mind blowing action sequences in the film<br /><br />(6) Setpiece 1: The axe gang come to intimidate and get the slum locality to bow down to them; Three of the dwellers in the locality happen to be super kung fu gurus; The three of them send the axe gang packing<br /><br />(7) Setpiece2: Axe gang sends the world's 2nd best assasin team; 2 guys who by playing notes on a stringy-madarin kind of intrument,can summon and create swishing swords, arrows, axes all from thin air from the vibration of the musical notes and these weapon are flung onto the the 3 saviors of the slum locality. The assasins kill all three of the saviors.<br /><br />(8) This brings the landlord and landlandy into the foray; The landlord can do superior kungfu and the landy apart from kung fu has a scream that shatters glass, stone, anything.<br /><br />(9) The landlord/landlady team team up against the No 1 killer of all. He had been locked up in a cell, but is freed by the axe gang to kill the landlord/landady team after the musical killer assasin team fails to kill LL/LL team. This killer is No 1 because apart from being a kung fu master as everyone in this movie obviously is, he has the speciality of being so fast as to even catch a bullet with his fingers.<br /><br />(10) Major setpiece 3: The LL/LL team fight their hearts out, and finally we get the stephen chow's matrix parody "the one" experience. There is  the famous paraody of the matrix reloaded sequence where Keannu fights 100's of agent miths. Here we have 100 of axe gang members against stephen Chow who has had a change of heart and has turned against the axe gang.<br /><br />(11) In this action setpiece we see the "crouching tiger, hidden dragon" physics defying fly-kicking spiderman gravity defying kungfu. We see the all new toad style, where the villain very much becomes a toad. We also see the farthest a human being travels (upto the stratosphere actually) when getting head butted via someone conversant with the toad style of kung fu. Incidentally Stephen chow goes so high up, he puts his feet on an eagle and becomes as light as the bird and floats around before zooming back in with friction burn like one of them spiralling down satellites before he just uses his palm of "the one" and makes a devastating handprint on the earth big enough to cover 5 men.<br /><br />A novel and insane comic caper with great special effects. A movie which makes fun of the kungfu genre and at the same time hieghtens this surreal kung fu experience.<br /><br />regards, VIkram</p></br><a href="../users/AE9GUE3HHOX3U.html">AE9GUE3HHOX3U</a><br/><p>It would be going out on a limb saying this one of the best movies ever made? Or at least the most unusual, mystical movies ever made.  It has everything, action, comedy, drama, dance musical.  It takes you into this bizarre world that is so surreal, sometimes dream sometimes nightmare.  It climaxes into this unbelievable frenzy that leaves you bewildered and almost powerless to it's grip.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D3XQC2DIT.html">A1D3XQC2DIT</a><br/><p>The Axe Gang goes where it wants, does what it wants, and harrasses and oppresses whoever it wants. One day the gang shows up in a small town -- a town which tried to stay out of trouble -- to see about a small disturbance. Instead of imposing its will, the Axe Gang discovers the town's secret: Three Kung Fu masters have taken refuge there, unbeknownst even to each other. With damaged pride and reckless determination, the Axe Gang sets out to eliminate the three masters and take over the town. While the war wages, one enterprising young man tries to gain membership with the Axe Gang.<br /><br />The movie was made in an entertaining style that is satirical of decades of martial-arts movies. Consider it Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon with a sense of humor (I hate to use CTHD as an example, but it seems to be the most well-known movie to use the exagerated fight scenes).<br /><br />This was so close to being a great movie to me. I really liked it and only have one complaint, and it is minor. One of my favorite elements to the movie was the dancing. It was a perfect element to a martial arts movie. Here was another choregraphed scene, dancing not fighting. And can't we get philosophical and say that in many ways fighting could be viewed as a crude form of dance? (Maybe I'm reaching a little bit there.) But the dancing occurs only when the Axe Gang has its confidence and as soon as it sees there is a legitimate challenger to its power, the dancing stops. And that disappointed me, but like I said before, it is only minor.<br /><br />The plot is completely outrageous. If you do not like live-action movies with ridiculous story lines, Kung Fu Hustle is not a movie for you. If you want an atypical martial-arts movie that might make you laugh, check it out. I really liked Kung Fu Hustle.</p></br><a href="../users/A36NUDST4Y5JBA.html">A36NUDST4Y5JBA</a><br/><p>A fun movie, good special effects.

The fictional story is set in China probably before the Japanese invasion in the city of Shanghai.  A ruthless black-suited gang, known as the Axe Gang, controls the police and spreads terror where ever it is in control.  It also thrives financially on casinos. However, the Axe Gang (and other less influential gangs) tend to ignore the poorest areas, including a little-known set of dilapidated apartments and shops known as Pig Sty Town.  Its landlord (Wah Yuen) and extremely loud landlady (Qiu Yuen) often fight with each other and make frequent calls and demands upon their poor renters.  One day, two men claiming to be part of the Axe Gang pass through Pig Sty Town.  The two men, Sing (Stephen Chow) and his sidekick (Chi Chung Lam) try to bully themselves with the poor Pig Sty Town residents, but are quickly thwarted by the noisy landlady.  In at attempt to call for help, Sing shoots a firework beyond the walls of Pig Sty Town and it happens to land upon the head of a real Axe Gang boss, who is traveling with a dozen or more black-suited gang members and immediately demand to know who attacked them.  Amazingly, three of Pig Sty Town's poor residents attack the gang with heroic kung fu fighting.  Angered, The Axe Gang leader, Brother Sum (Kwok Kuen Chan), hires two kung fu masters to attack Pig Sty Town.  He also makes Sing an offer: if he can prove himself by killing someone, he can join the Axe Gang; but Sing and his sidekick can't quite be as evil as they would like, especially when they encounter a mute young woman (Si Lu Ren?) and her ice cream stand.  Using an unusual stringed instrument filled with weapons, the two kung fu masters (Kang Xi Jia and Hak On Fung) attack the three poor Pig Sty Town residents that have superb martial arts skills, while the landlady screams at them from above to keep quiet.  The two kung fu masters are very good until they the landlord and landlady come out to confront them.  The Axe Gang then decides to recruit a very powerful kung fu master known only as The Beast (Hsiao Liang), who is located in a mental health asylum.  The Beast brings out the truth about who the landlord and landlady are, but Sing may discover things about himself as well.<br /><br />With interesting kung fu choreography enhanced with computer-generated special effects and humor, "Kung Fu Hustle" is entertaining, but some people may find some parts of it a bit too violent.  If you enjoy kung fu films, then you will probably enjoy this entertaining kung fu fantasy by Stephen Chow.  Overall, I rate the film with 4 out of 5 stars.  Other interesting characters include Rabbit-Tooth Jane (Kai Shi Chen), Donut (Zhi Hua Dong), Coolie (Yu Xing), the Axe Gang Advisor (Kai Man Tin), the Tailor (Chi Ling Chiu), the Axe Gang Vice General (Suet Lam) and the Crocodile Gang Boss (Xiaogang Feng).</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>While I was watching and thoroughly enjoying Stephen Chow's film "Gong fu" ("Kung Fu Hustle"), I was also trying to think of the best cinematic reference point that would succinctly explain what is really going on beyond what we see on screen. That would be Pig Sty Alley, a slum in Shanghai that is run by a landlady (Qiu Yuenm who I defy any viewer to recognize from "The Man With the Golden Gun") who does absolutely everything with a cigarette dangling from her lips. There are gang wars going on all around them, but the Axe Gang, the biggest and baddest bunch around, ignore Pig Sty Alley because there is no money to be made there. This is just as well because if anybody causes trouble in that neighborhood it turns out that there are not one, or two, or even three, but four kung fun masters. This is discovered by Sing (Chow), a would-be gangster who figures he can impress the Axe Gang by what he does in Pig Sty Alley. But things go very poorly for him and his would be employers visit to clean up his mess. This precipitates a great deal of martial arts action.<br /><br />At the height of the action in this 2004 film it suddenly hit me that the movie it most reminded me of was "The Princess Bride." The key commonality between the two is the inherent sense of joy that infuses both films. This is not a spoof in the "Airplane!" tradition, but more of a humorous homage along the lines of "A Mighty Wind," where you have to get it right at the same time you are making your comic points. You might be able to reduce "Gong fu" down to a combination of karate and slapstick, but you have to grant that Chow has to get both parts right, which is why this works. The comedy is integrated as well as the wirework, which is why I found this film so utterly enjoyable. The goal is to have fun and it is well met here.<br /><br />The more you know the conventions of the genre the more you can appreciate how Chow's film plays with them, especially with the revenge of the supporting characters mentality that is at play. One of the reasons I thought "Spider-man 2" was the best comic book superhero movie made to date was because of the match up between Spider-man and Doctor Octopus allowed the fights to exist in three dimensions; fighting on the side of a building or a subway is not a problem for those two. I think "Gong fu" has a similar advantage and perhaps the simple idea that the action here is three-dimensional explains why the look of films like "The Matrix" and "Wo hu cang long" have become a cinematic rage in terms of special effects. Here we are in the early days of the 21st century and perhaps it is because of the advances in CGI that wirework comes across as still being quite impressive, even the two of them are mixed the way they are here.<br /><br />If anything, Chow's film is a Kung Fu fantasy. Reality starts to be displaced when wirework is involved, and here the judgment as to what action choreographers Sammo Hung Kam-Bo and Woo-ping Yuen can come up with that looks good on camera. If it looks good, then do it. Without conventional restraints Chow can make things bigger, culminating not only in the Lion's Roar through a speaker but the really big imprint of the hand of power. The paradigmatic scene for me in "Gong fu" is when all of the kung fu masters emerge to take on the two harpists, named Harpist No. 1 (Kang Xi Jia) and Harpist No. 2 (Hak On Fung), who pluck strings on their large instrument to send swords (and worst) hurtling towards our heroes. I would give credit to the kung fu masters, but part of the fun here is finding out who they are. This might not be a great film, but it is certainly great fun, so much so that the best thing I can say about it is that people who do not like kung fu movies should enjoy and be impressed by this one.</p></br><a href="../users/A18BD98SU49UB7.html">A18BD98SU49UB7</a><br/><p>A nice mix of Kill Bill and Hotshots.<br /><br />I have watched thousands of movies, reviewed hundreds on amazon or otherwise, and can honestly say that Kung fu Hustle made me laugh like no other.<br /><br />Seriously, I could go into the plot, which is more or less an excuse for more awesome acrobatic achievements of excellence, but Kung fu hustle is about the prat-falls. It's Flat out hilarious. Never have I laughed for the duration of an entire film.<br /><br />It seems that Bruce Lee and the Wachowski's have finally met the Anamaniacs.

The final fight is a special effects masterpiece, but nothing more.  I thought it was nice bringing old school high kicker Bruce LIang out of retirement to play the beast.  Overall I thought it was one of Stephen Chow's weaker efforts.  I highly recommend Shaolin Soccer over this.<br /><br />The dvd is a really good release and has a commentary with the cast  on it.

Rather, I think about a feeling I get when I'm sitting there and watching outrageous actions on the screen and I'm constantly giggling.  Such is the delight of Kung Fu Hustle, a brainchild of Stephen Chow from Hong Kong who wrote, directed and stars in this rather outrageous spoof of martial arts movie.  He's also captured the spirit of American cartoon characters, the ones that get hit on the head with a hammer and come up smiling, or whose legs turn into a roadrunner in order to flee disaster.  This is the stuff that this 2004 film is made of - a rare piece of clever entertainment.<br /><br />The plot revolves around a group of poor but hardworking people who live in Pigsty Alley.  However there just happen to be three accomplished martial artists in their midst.  One is a tailor.  One is a hen-pecked husband.  And one is a matronly woman in a shapeless housedress and curlers who always has a cigarette dangling from her mouth.  Into this neighborhood comes our star, Stephen Chow and his chubby sidekick.  They pretend they belong to the Axe Gang so that they can shakedown the people for a little money.  They're stopped cold in their tracks though.  And soon there is more than only the three unlikely martial artists of Pig Sty Alley they have to contend with.  There's the real Axe gang itself.<br /><br />The action never stops and the story plays out with outrageous martial arts scenes enhanced by the use of modern technology, concealed wires, and special effects.<br /><br />On the negative side, the film did drag a bit though, especially near the end when the jokes had already worn thin.  But I think just a few more feet on the cutting room floor would be all it needs.<br /><br />Kung Fu Hustle is a rare treat.  I definitely recommend it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ATTCCO32ZXET.html">A3ATTCCO32ZXET</a><br/><p>Imagine a movie with the over the top action stylings of a Jackie Chan film but a funnier script.  No, scratch that; how about a clever martial arts cartoon fleshed out with live action and a little CGI?  As soon as I saw this I realized that I've been unconsciously yearning for this weird combination of the ridiculous and the impressive. Kung Fu Hustle is long overdue.<br /><br />Kung Fu Hustle is a bona fide comedy.  It has an original plot, action, and jokes that don't reference any other particular movie.  What's more, it would seem that filmmakers have finally discovered how to use CGI to simulate cartoon action in a live action movie (who even knew that would ever  be called for? And yet...).  This is an entirely new category of martial arts film, deserving of its own evaluation apart from spoofs like Kung Pow.<br /><br />The story is basically the universal archetype of poor people being oppressed by a powerful but corrupt man, and an unlikely hero emerging out of nowhere to save the day.  That much is old hat, I will admit.  And I'm not sure that I'd go so far as to say that the entire film is good, because it does drag on in spots.  On the whole, though, I found myself enjoying it and being continually surprised by the irreverent tone, the sometimes silly humor and the very entertaining fight scenes.<br /><br />If you like your kung fu movies straight and serious, this one might seem silly.  But I think that's its odd charm, so I will give it a solid four stars and call it a good pick for a contrarian in a lighter mood.  If that's you, then you're probably a Warner Bros. fan, too and you will be able to appreciate Kung Fu Hustle.<br /><br />-Andrea, aka merribelle</p></br><a href="../users/A1ADG449ZNEO6Y.html">A1ADG449ZNEO6Y</a><br/><p>Kung Fu Hustle is a good movie.It's very creative and comparable to a superhero movie.Some actors in the movie hold powerful martial art skills.It adds great comedy that's very orignal and even includes dances on a couple scenes.All I have to say is I liked it , good effects "for the most part" and entertaining to watch.<br />If you like Kung Fu movies then pick up or rent Ong-Bak :The Thai Warrior".</p></br><a href="../users/A2C7BOQVFH1HLE.html">A2C7BOQVFH1HLE</a><br/><p>I've always been a fan of Stephen Chow and his uniquely quirky sense of humour and I had watched his earlier films like the "God of Cookery" for example and his secret agent spoof but his films always seemed to start and develop well but to always have lame endings in addition to being rather shallow and one-dimensional at times.  That is until this great film which balances the same comedy with a very good story of redemption and of how two "losers" finally make it good.<br /><br />In "Kung Fu Hustle" we finally get a very good Stephen Chow ending which never fails to bring a tear to my eye each time I watch it.  This is why this film has now become my favourite movie of his and this Blu-ray release doesn't disappoint.  The picture and sound quality is very good and has to be watched in the original Cantonese with English subtitles if necessary to truly appreciate this.  The special features are really nothing to crow about if you are into these extras but for me I'm not too fussed about these and the interview for instance was quite pathetic here with the condescending tone and stupid questions of the interviewer clearly frustrating Stephen Chow who looks like he'd rather be having a root canal than to have to endure it.<br /><br />As for the movie itself it was the usual brand of Stephen Chow comedy where he intersperses spoofs of various western movies with madcap/slapstick comedy and we clearly get allusions to "The Matrix" even to the point of him being called "the One" like Neo at the end when he finally achieves his full potential.  We even get a spoof of Kubrick's "The Shining" in one scene when he helps the Beast to escape not to mention the reference to the Roadrunner cartoons when he is running away from the landlady etc.  What makes this rise above the usual Stephen Chow outing is the great other story within the story with the flashbacks explaining why the Chow character behaves the way he does as an adult and how he finally finds redemption.<br /><br />This is an excellent Stephen Chow film and it is in my opinion his best to date and this blu-ray version is a real treat with its excellent picture and sound quality when viewed in the original language.<br /><br />Highly recommended!</p></br><a href="../users/A29Y34ALWJUGB5.html">A29Y34ALWJUGB5</a><br/><p>This movie starts out on a serious note but quickly fades into one of simple hilarity, and keeps that tone for the remainder of the movie.

Stephen Chow is the new Jackie Chan.

This is not to say that director Stephen Chow's film is a collage of other styles because he adds some of his own original fluorishes to make this a highly original work.  The title of the film is kind of a paradox because it renders in your mind a polination of seventies Kung Fu and black exploitation films which may have partially influenced Chow but not wholly.  It would also be easy to characterize this film as a parody or a satire of martial arts films but Chow has such an affinity for those films that it holds it's own with them.  Chow hits a homerun here wearing the multiple hats of actor, director, and writer.  His script is rich with characterization and the story takes enough nifty twists that it would be a disservice to reveal them here.  Where he really excels is as a visualist in both action and art direction.  Before you can say, "What was that?", another imaginative sight penetrates the screen.

They attack the old order, en masse, with hatchets, tommy guns, tuxedos, and top hats. Once they control everything worth having, they move into the poor section, called the Pig Sty. People here make humble livings when they can, as a noodle chef, coolie, or foppish tailor raising the hem just a bit for Bucktooth Jane's attempts at selling herself (or offering short-term rentals).<br /><br />They picked the wrong chef, laborer and - in their words - fairy. These men (more or less men, anyway) have mastered mysterious martial arts, and promptly kick the goobers out of a half-hundred or so bad guys. The first round of heroes falls, but more and stronger take their places. Watch The Landlady - watch her landing, especially, after she evades a truck in that road chase. Then watch her loud Capri pants in the penultimate fight against The Beast. The ultimate battle comes after that, but I'll leave it for you to discover.<br /><br />I can't think when I last laughed that hard at a movie. It's a self-concious send-up of so many stereotypes I lost count of them all. Heck, I probably didn't even know what half of them were, in the Chinese idiom, but the satire was broad enough to enjoy anyway.<br /><br />This is insanely funny. Just take it as it comes, and try not to hurt yourself laughing.<br /><br />//wiredweird</p></br><a href="../users/A3QNQQKJTL76H0.html">A3QNQQKJTL76H0</a><br/><p>This is an excellent film that crosses a few boundaries. It's first and foremost a kung-fu action movie, fused with numerous comedic moments and slapstick, as well as some heartwarming (and heartbreaking) scenes. The Chinese name for this film is simply "Kung-Fu", but "Hustle" was added to the English name to set it apart for western audiences. Fans of Stephen Chow will recognize many familiar faces and long-running gags. If you're a fan of kung fu movies (and Chinese cinema in general) and haven't seen this yet, you owe it to yourself to buy this disc.<br /><br />I would say this is Chow's most universally accessible film. But like all foreign movies, some things just don't translate and there will be jokes you won't get. Some of the references and imagery are distinctly Chinese and only funny or understandable to Chinese viewers. The abundant insults and cursing (especially by the landlady) are hilarious if you understand Cantonese.<br /><br />Visually, this film is stunning for its representation of 1940's Shanghai, and the transfer to BD does a very good job. Lots of wonderful and clever fight sequences by famed fight choreographer Yuen Wo Ping, as well as some great use of CG to exaggerate the action which draws inevitable comparisons to the Matrix (which used a lot CG and also involved Yuen).<br /><br />Features-wise, there's a fair amount of extra stuff in here for a Blu-ray disc, including a 42 minute featurette (all Chinese with subtitles), a 30 minute interview with Chow (all English), bloopers, and deleted scenes. The featurette is for Chinese audiences and looks like something taken from HK television. The interview, on the other hand, is aimed at western audiences who are completely new to Chow's work and HK cinema. It seeks to explain a lot of the influences, gestures, and symbolism in the movie for the benefit of American audiences.<br /><br />Avoid the English audio track at all costs. My player defaulted to English and I had to laugh at the really bad voiceovers before switching back to the original Cantonese. The English dub actors all attempt really bad Chinese accents. It's embarrassing and distracting.<br /><br />The other complaint is that the commentary track is several seconds out of sync with the film in certain places. This is quite distracting when they talk about some very specific things like how they accomplished an effect or point out a small detail in the frame that audiences might miss.<br /><br />All in all, this is a great BD to have in your collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>KUNG FU HUSTLE is clearly one of the silliest, funny, genuinely well-produced comedies to come around for a long time.  It is so very refreshing to lose yourself in this farce knowing that the entire purpose of the film is to entertain.  But as in all good comedy there is also a message.<br /><br />Talented director/writer (with Tsang Kan Cheong)/star Stephen Chow has the whole concept of Kung Fu as entertainment down pat.  With the brilliant choreography of Yuen Wo Ping as partner, Chow tells a skeletal tale of two wannabe criminals (Chow himself and his obese sidekick Chi Chung Lam) who will stop at nothing to become members of the Canton mafia Axe Gang. They blunder into a hick town run by a smarmy landlord and his bellicose wife  to find someone to kill, as that is the only way they can join the Axe Gang. But this sleepy little town is unafraid of gangs, why? - because they happen to be the home of some expert Kung Fu practitioners.  After some absurd events the Axe Gang happens into the town only to come up against impossible odds and a lot of hilarious surprises.<br /><br />The choreography and setting parodies everything in the Hollywood repertoire: the spaghetti westerns of Sergio Leone, High Noon antics, Busby Berkeley type staging, Keystone Cops zany shenanigans, Marital Arts films - name it, the film takes a shot and the shot outdoes the original!  The color and cinematography are terrific, the musical score (to which Chow also contributed!) is a little masterwork of ancient Chinese instruments garnished with contemporary sounds, and the actors, when not engaged in the nonstop fighting sequences, just seem to be having the best time being silly.  For pure diversion and giggling entertainment, spend an evening in the  company of Stephen Chow and crew.  Recommended, even for serious movie aficionados!

I have to say that though a lot of the inspirations for this film are derived from inside jokes (mostly easily comprehendable to fans of the genre), they still succeeded in making me laugh (or at least smile), plus computer generated special effects and broad, self effacing humor and you will definitely see why "Kung Fu Hustle" stands out from the other films of its kind.<br /><br />Sing (Stephen Chow) is an aspiring--if clumsy--kung fun master who was told by a begger/con artist as a child that he was the chosen kung fu master and would unlock his potential if he purchased a special book for only $10 (his life savings).  Though, Sing hasn't been able to successfully execute a single kung fu move in all the years that followed that chance encounter, his one true wish it become a part of the very violent "Axe Gang" that terrorizes the---seemingly--humble residents of Pig Pen Alley in 1940s Hong Kong.  What Sing doesn't realize is that the residents have some martial arts moves of their own (particularly the landlady who has NEVER lost a yelling contest, the tailor, and virtually everyone down to the little boys).<br /><br />Honestly, I can't begin to articulate in this review just what style--visually--this film would fit into.  This, like other films of its kind, has plenty of action packed sequences, gravity defying fights and eye popping depictions of stylized violence (or should I say injury?  you literally see someone's teeth popping out of their head!).<br /><br />This is the biggest blockbuster in Hong Kong history, for good reason.  You will definitely be entertained.  A note:  This is not suitable for young children or young teens.  This is an R-rated film for good reason.  The title speaks for itself.....</p></br><a href="../users/A126KX6FVI4T66.html">A126KX6FVI4T66</a><br/><p>The bad guys are really bad, and the good guys are<br />funny old guys?

Lots of stupid stuff, and  not good enough acting. Also not very funny humor. However, there was one good thing about the first half-the battle scenes. They were great, but it only heightened my liking a small amount. Then there was the second half. More fighting, less dumb humor, and a lot more coolness, especially in the final fight. It was awesome. And I loved the ending, where the protagonist and the girl he knew for trying to save got together again, and married each other. I do think they'll be a grand couple. Though it was a good second half, there was just to much loser stuff and stupidity at the start for it to be one of my top movies. But, it  was OK overall, and I thought I'd hate it. Good thing I gave it a  chance to finish. This is the kind of movie you should see if you have nothing else to do(at least in my opinion).</p></br><a href="../users/AW99SBGWEXP0J.html">AW99SBGWEXP0J</a><br/><p>Kung Fu Hustle **1/2<br /><br />Cast: Stephen Chow, Yuen Wah, Yuen Qui, Leung Siu Lung, Shengyi Huang<br /><br />Director: Stephen Chow<br /><br />Running Length: 1:35<br /><br />MPAA Classification: PG-13<br /><br />In Shanghai, in the 1930s, everything is controlled by the Axe Gang.  Well, everything except the slums.  There is no profit in the slums.  Sing (Chow) wants to take advantage of this, and when he arrives at Pigsty Alley playing the role of an Axe Gang member, his performance is so bad that nobody believes him.  Then some real members of the gang arrive, and Sing is in trouble.  To add to that, there are some kung fu masters hiding in Pigsty Alley, and they are not too thrilled with the gang making an appearance in their little town.<br /><br />I can honsetly say I have never seen a movie quite like "Kung Fu Hustle".  It is a strange hybrid of a kung fu movie, a slapstick comedy, and even a little Road Runner/Looney Toones.  It is really funny at times, but the humor is a bit uneven.  The biggest drawback to this film is the subtitles.  I prefer this to dubbing, but I think that some of the humor is lost, having to read them.<br /><br />Apparently Stephen Chow is second in popularity in China only to Jackie Chan.  He has yet to really make a name for himself here in America, but there definately is potential.  He writes, directs, stars, and produces this movie, so this movie is definately his.  If you are looking for something a little different to see, "Kung Fu Hustle" just may be the movie for you.</p></br><a href="../users/AWG2O9C42XW5G.html">AWG2O9C42XW5G</a><br/><p>This movie is hilarious. i love japansse comedies and this one takes the cake.

I started using the fast-forward button as I got to the end.</p></br><a href="../users/A3E5OY3YLZMOA9.html">A3E5OY3YLZMOA9</a><br/><p>Kung Fu Hustle is supposed to be a comedy but it's so much more than that. The story begins with a rather serious scene when the entire Crocodile gang is taken out by the dancing, powerful, and notorious Axe Gang. After getting to know their power you are then introduced to the stupidity of Sing and his sidekick.<br /><br />The two want to be members of the Axe Gang but they can't fight and they are too wimpy to pull off any crimes. Sing tries to fool a barber in Pig Sty alley, which is a district that had no trouble because of poverty. Sing starts something he can't finish when he sends a fake distress call used by gangs when in the need of help. The Axe gang isn't pleased when they find a district of broke people picking on two fake members of their gang but somehow they didn't notice they had nothing to do with their gang.<br /><br />Not only does Sing get the district in trouble he unknowingly gets the Axe Gang in trouble. There are heroes within the district but you would never think these guys  were anyones hero, one is a tailor, the other a cook, and the last is just a hard labor worker. None of them look like heroes but they are and man can they fight. I know Kung Fu Hustle is supposed to be funny but to me it was just a perfectly blended masterpiece. The fight sequences were amazing and like nothing you've ever seen before and the story is gripping. There's one scene where these two assassins use sound waves as a weapon so maybe that helps to show how unique this is.<br /><br />My only problem was some things were a little too fake or digitalized and this made some of the fights not as good as others. I recommend watching this film in subtitles and not in the English dialogue. Seeing it in English just takes away from the film because you miss most of what is really being said. The music is great because it adds extra edge and suspense to the film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>Being a chow fan myself, I must say this is by far the best work he's done. I was absolutely captivated and immediately at home in this very foreign place. This film is so strangely retro and yet tangible.  Stephen Chow's name has been around the Chinese cinema for more than twenty years. His special style of dry humor is not only known but also recognized by Chinese viewers as his trademark and uniqueness. It's only until recently with the release of Shaolin soccer did people around the world started to take notice of this Asian pop icon. But when we thought it couldn't get any better, he surprised us with this masterpiece, Kung Fu Hustle.  I have never laughed so hard, yet come away feeling as if I had been uplifted.<br /><br />The effects are fierce, and yet organic. The characters are strong, vivid and effective. The imagery and magic of the story and scenery and amazing overwhelmingly inspired soundtrack blend. It's like this film picks you up and never puts you down, doesn't miss a beat, and never spends a fraction of a second too long in any one spot.<br /><br />Viewers will find themselves drawn into the fantasy world of Kung Fu with funny, fascinating characters that blow people's mind away. References to Forrest Gump, The Matrix, Silence of the Lambs, traditional Chinese Woosha novels can be found in many scenes. I also find myself laughing so hard in several parts. Most of the jokes are easy to understand for they are usually short phrases or body movements. This allows general audiences around the world to get pass the cultural or language barrier and enjoy the atmosphere it's creating. The action scenes are also visually stunning according to the design by famous action designer Yuen Ho Ping (Responsible for Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon and The Matrix trilogy). But being a Kung Fu watcher, I personally thought it would've been even more superior with less CGI.<br /><br />Overall I give it 5 stars. It's probably the most entertaining Chinese film to date. This one will sure save a spot for Steven Chow in the history of Asian cinema.</p></br><a href="../users/A25ZVI6RH1KA5L.html">A25ZVI6RH1KA5L</a><br/><p>My first experience with Hong Kong producer/director/writer/actor Stephen Chow came when a good friend recommended Shaolin Soccer (2001), a film which I enjoyed a lot primarily due to its kinetic energy and off the wall, mind bending special effects, so when I heard Chow was coming out with another feature, titled Kung Fu Hustle (2004), I was very interested...sadly, I missed the theatrical release, but I was able to catch it on video and I wasn't disappointed.  Co-written and directed by Stephen Chow (God of Cookery, Shaolin Soccer), who also shares credits in producing, writing, and original music, the film features Chow, along with Qiu Yuen (Kung Fu Mahjong), Wah Yuen (Kung Fu Mahjong), Zhi Hua Dong, Kwok-Kwan Chan (Shaolin Soccer), Chi Chung Lam (Kung Fu Mahjong), and Siu-Lung Leung (Kung Fu 12 Kicks).<br /><br />As the film, set in the 1930s, begins we learn a ruthless group known as the Axe Gang pretty much control everything through intimidation (and axes), except for an area known as Pig Sty Alley, a poor, residential block not worth bothering with as those who live there have very little, if anything, to offer up.  As a result the residents of Pig Sty Alley live a relatively peaceful life under the thumb of their chain-smoking, hag-like landlord who's always dressed in a natty nightgown, rollers in her hair, and funky flip flops.  One day a pair of hapless buffoons show up, one of them named Sing (Chow), pretending to be Axe Gang members, and start pushing people around (in a really funny sequence), resulting in the appearance of the real Axe Gang.  Well, turns out three residents of Pig Sty Alley are actually powerful, semi-retired warriors, and a crazy battle ensues as the trio single-handedly beat the crud out of the gang.  The gang retreats to lick their wounds and ends up hiring a pair of musicians who moonlight as professional killers and another fantastic fight sequence ensues.  Meanwhile, Sing and his fat friend, eager to join the Axe Gang, are tasked to perform some evilness, in which they fail miserably.  Things get a bit murky around this point, but the gang ends up having to hire the number one killer, someone known as The Beast, played by Siu-Lung Leung, who's currently locked away in a mental institution due to the fact he studied kung fu so intensely it caused him to go crazy (I guess).  Anyway, turns out Sing, the bumbling would be criminal, has within him a power even he's not aware of, one rivals even The Beast himself.<br /><br />While I'm not an expert on Asian cinema, I have seen enough of it to know at least one thing...a good deal of it doesn't often make a lot of sense, to me at least (but then again I'm an idiot).  Maybe this is due to translation issues tied to my own Westernized sensibilities, I don't know, but I've come to expect, and even rely on, the fact that whenever I watch an Asian import, specifically within the martial arts genre, there's going to be aspects I won't understand, and that's certainly true of Kung Fu Hustle.  I don't see this as a negative aspect as generally I can get the gist of the story (the student avenging the death of an authority figure theme is pretty common) even if some of the finer points are lost.  Here the main theme seems to be protectors coming forth to stand up for the little guy against seemingly insurmountable odds.  I went with that, letting the rest (the parts that didn't make sense) slide, managing to get through the film quite easily, helped immeasurably along by the virtual non-stop, high flying, kinetic, highly comedic action and crazy go nuts special effects work.  At times the film seemed like a live action Looney Tunes cartoon given the balls out silliness involved (there's a foot chase sequence that's right out of a Road Runner/Wile E. Coyote cartoon).  One of my favorite parts of the film occurs near the beginning when Sing and his fat friend venture into Pig Sty Alley.  Sing, trying to appear tougher than he actually is, starts antagonizing a gathered crowd of residents, challenging individuals to a one on one fight.  In doing so he tries to pick out those who would seem easy to beat, the first being a man in the crowd who actually turns out to be a giant (seems when the man was in the crowd he was sitting down, so Sing, only seeing the man's head, assumed the man was a relatively small guy).  Once Sing sees how tall the guy actually is he decides to choose another, resulting in similar scenarios.  Obviously this is a visual gag, so much will be lost reading about it here.  There's so much overall nuttiness going on in this film it's hard to describe it, but if you dig on zany Three Stooges antics, you'll probably enjoy this feature.  Hardcore film fans may also get a kick out of the film as there's plenty of references to other films, in particular The Shining (1980), The Blues Brothers (1980), and Spider-Man (2002), to name a few.  One thing to keep in mind is this is the American theatrical release of the film, so some aspects have been toned down (apparently some of the bloody bits have been removed from the fight sequences).  As far as the computer generated effects (CGI), they look as sharp here as in a film like The Matrix (1999), and there's a lot of it, so if you're not a big fan of that type of effects work, you probably won't enjoy the film.  I can accept a lot of it, if it looks good and ties within the story (which felt like the case here), but I dislike its extensive usage meant to fill gaps in a production, the intent being to draw focus away from said gaps, as is generally the case with films from someone like Roland Emmerich, responsible for such features as Godzilla (1998) and The Day After Tomorrow (2004).  All in all I thought this film a blast, one worth multiple viewings.<br /><br />The picture, presented in anamorphic widescreen (2.35:1), looks exceptionally sharp, and the audio, available in original Cantonese Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound, dubbed English Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound track, and dubbed French Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround comes across beautifully.  As far as extras there's a commentary track with Chow and a few performers (with English subtitles), a forty minute featurette titled Behind the Scenes of Kung Fu Hustle, two deleted scenes, an interview piece with Stephen Chow, an outtakes and bloopers reel, a poster gallery for the film, a whole slew of previews for other Sony releases, and subtitles available in English and French.  All in all a great package for a highly entertaining film, one I'm probably going to watch more than once.<br /><br />Cookieman108<br /><br />Keep in mind the film is rated `R', as the zany antics I alluded to earlier come off fairly violent played out in live action form, so I wouldn't recommend this film for younger children unless their minds are already warped, then I suppose it probably won't matter...</p></br><a href="../users/AILBDL6ATVDCJ.html">AILBDL6ATVDCJ</a><br/><p>Stephen Chow wrote, directed, and starred in this entertaining adventure, a cinematic ensemble of interesting and unique characters.  I haven't seen a martial arts film this good in a long time.  In my opinion, this was like the movie Grease without the singing and dancing, although there was some dancing.  I picture wedding parties doing the axe-gang dance all over the world.  In fact, I think an axe-gang dance video would be a big seller!  Workout tapes could follow.<br /><br />  From the opening scenes of the movie, where a gang leader takes out his anger and frustration on the local police department, to the rolling of the credits, Stephen Chow and his cast of dedicated actors have put together one of the best comedies ever.<br /><br />  But Kung Fu Hustle is not just a comedy.  It's a story with a message, a message about doing what's right, even if that means you are going to take a few lumps, serious lumps!  And what makes the movie so much fun is that director Stephen Chow knows when to jump back and forth between the serious and the not-so-serious scenes in this movie.<br /><br />  Chow's character, Sing, is best described as a gangster wanna-be who has a long series of failures in this film.  But we never stop wondering exactly what he will screw up next, and when he becomes entangled in a bit of gang warfare, his ridiculous antics rise in their comedic value.  There is a scene where Sing demonstrates his knife throwing ability that had me literally crying I was laughing so hard.  Stephen Chow is a natural on the movie screen.<br /><br />  Some of the clashes between the people of the besieged slum and their attackers are so visually stimulating that I shall never forget them.  When the two harpists come to kill the defenders of the slum, we are witnesses to some amazing cinematic treasures, as the special effects are top-notch.  Famed action choreographer Yuen Wo Ping goes beyond the call of duty in Kung Fu Hustle, working both the realistic approach to fight scene creation and the "hey, nobody-could-ever-do-that" sequences.  That unique tactic made the film stand apart from almost anything I have ever seen before.<br /><br />  I think Stephen Chow is a genius, and I am going to go rent Shaolin Soccer as soon as possible!  I highly recommend Kung Fu Hustle.  It is a great movie!<br /><br />See ya next review!</p></br><a href="../users/A6ADO7B6FUVN.html">A6ADO7B6FUVN</a><br/><p>Frequently the cinema world frowns upon slapstick, as it is a simple and unintelligent form of comedy.  However, Stephen Chow utilizes this variety of comic approach in his Kung Fu Hustle (known as Gong Fu in Asia) to perfection.  Slapstick finally finds its true purpose besides smashing pots and pans on top of people's heads, or pulling away chairs from seating people.  Chow takes it one-step further by inventing the new Shaolin Kung Fu style Slapstick, which willfully and intentionally beats up the audience with bellyaching laughter.<br /><br />"In a time of social unrest and disorder the gangs run amuck", is the opening description in regards to when the film takes place.  However, it is never clear exactly when, as periodically it feels mostly like the 1930s with moments from other time periods that are cleverly incorporated into the film.  The magic of cinema will remove the obstacle of time through Chow's creative fantasy approach and deliver a timeless journey into the small Pig Sty Alley where the story's heroes and crooks will converge in an epic comic battle of the kung fu fists and kicks.<br /><br />The Ax Gang rules the city while the police eagerly count their bribes.  The only ones that are an exception to corruption are the most unfortunate who reside in the poverty-stricken areas.  One of these areas is the Pig Sty Alley where this story unfolds when Sing (Stephen Chow) and his cheerful follower Bone (Lam Tze Chung) deceptively enters under the fake identity as Ax Gang members.  Sing's fraudulent plan backfires when the inhabitants of the Pig Sty Alley decide to oppose them, which pulls the real Ax Gang into the poor neighborhood as well.  Fortunately for the inhabitants of the Pig Sty Alley some very skilled kung fu masters have withdrawn from public attention into this poor neighborhood.  Thus, when the Ax Gang arrives, they are in for a surprise that will rock the corrupt society.<br /><br />The action is plentiful in Kung Fu Hustle to which some film critics has uttered dislike, but it is in the large amount of kung fu where the audience will discover an unpolished gem.  With the help of wire-fu, special effects and hilarious dialogues laughter will go through all its different gradients from muffled chuckles to full out laughing explosions.  It is within these fight scenes where the audience will uncover the crude jewel that ultimately will deliver a true cinematic gem through the admirable story line.<br /><br />Stephen Chow's story resembles a lot with Ren&eacute; Goscinny's and Albert Uderzo's comic book Ast&eacute;rix where one small village resists the whole Roman Empire.  The difference in Chow's film is mostly cultural, but it also has his own comic martial art touch to it.  There are also many spoofs on scenes from other films such as Matrix and some Spaghetti Westerns.  On top of the parody, Chow gives a full out slapstick assault to the kung fu genre that had its profound emergence in the 1970s.  Regardless of Kung Fu Hustle's similarities to other stories, Chow achieves an extraordinary film that delivers valuable messages such as forgiveness, honor, and love in the backdrop of a heavy dose of humor.</p></br><a href="../users/AHABFECTNE15I.html">AHABFECTNE15I</a><br/><p>Version: U.S.A / Region A, B, C<br />MPEG-2 BD-25<br />Aspect ratio: 2.40:1<br />Average video bit rate: 16.22 Mbps<br />Running time: 1:38:55 (cut)<br />Running time: 1:39:25 (uncut version - overseas)<br />Movie size: 17,62 GB<br />Disc size: 23,16 GB<br />LPCM 5.1 4608Kbps Chinese<br />DD 5.1 640Kbps English / French<br /><br />Subtitles: English / English SDH / Latin / French / Chinese / Korean / Thai / Portuguese<br /><br />#Audio commentary (in Cantonese with English subtitles)<br />#Behind the Scenes (41m:55s)<br />#3 Deleted Scenes<br />#Ric Meyers Interview with Stephen Chow (27m:55s)<br />#Outtakes and Bloopers (4m:46s)<br />#HD trailers</p></br><a href="../users/A22VNXHU6IZ5MT.html">A22VNXHU6IZ5MT</a><br/><p>What a great film,this was one of the suprise imports in the movie theaters,very funny stuff indeed,a very funny kung fu flick with a great story line too,The evil cigarette smoking landlady is very funny and memorable,as well as all the other great elements of this ultra cool film!!!

I agree, this is Kill Bill meets Looney Tunes. Stephen Chow wrote and directed this film and I have to say that this is awesome! He is sure to be the next big martial arts star of Hollywood. The script is your typical Kung Fu story, but the fight scenes are excellent and I can't say enough and the fantastic special effects. The Lion Scream, The Buddhist Palm, I could just go on and on, this film is amazing.<br /><br />My personal favorite scene of the movie is when the kung fu masters fight the two assassins that play their instruments while tossing swords at their opponents. I have never seen anything like that in my life on a movie; the best part! Worth seeing the movie just for that battle sequence alone! If you love martial arts/kung fu movies this is for you!!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A33XHXRTRZOQ12.html">A33XHXRTRZOQ12</a><br/><p>This movie is a work of pure comic genius, from an unexpected source! Who would have expected a Chinese director to come up with a Warner Bros.-style, Kung Fu, live action cartoon? Not me! Stephen Chow has OBVIOUSLY spent some time either in Hollywood, or in a history of film class drinking in the work of Tex Avery and Robert Clampett! This movie is a HOWL! Imagine if you will, (submitted for your approval,) The Zucker Bros. or pre-"High Anxiety" Mel Brooks getting a hold of a troupe of Chinese kung fu actors and using every "Looney Tunes" gag they can think of to milk the laughs for everything they're worth!<br /><br />Stephen Chow has all the earmarks of a master of kung fu slapstick, something this country hasn't really ever seen before. Aside from the great sight gags, he has also assembled a real soupcon of characters, from Rabbit-Tooth Jane, an unusual girl to say the least, (she acts VERY effeminate and has a look I really haven't seen in oriental women before,) to the bossy, battle-axe landlady, who also happens to be a dormant kung-fu doyenne, to her husband, a fellow, middle aged kung fu master, to a sweet, mute, Japanese-looking girl who sells ice cream. There are others, too numerous to mention here, without tiring you out!<br /><br />The director himself is the hero of the film, and he goes from being a sleazy, gangster wannabe to being a deadpan kung fu messiah during the course of the movie. One hilarious scene, while he is still a sleazebag, is when he tries terrorizing a poor community that has managed to avoid the wrath of an evil cabal called the "Axe Gang", in order to IMPRESS said gang. He calls for a challenger to step forward and to take him on, and he warns them "No cheating!" He calls on a humble lady farmer and dares her to hit him in the stomach, which she does, doubling him over immediately. Recovering from that, he starts picking at random...first a fella he refers to as "Shorty", who turns out to be about 7 feet tall when he stands up from his sitting position. After reminding the crowd "No cheating!", he then calls out a mousy looking guy with glasses, asking him to step forward. He does so, exposing a physique all out of character to his nerdy face. He then scans to what looks like a seven year old boy, who steps out, ALSO revealing a Charles Atlas-like upper torso! Fed up, (and completely cowardly,) he moves on.<br /><br />There is one very poetically done scene involving two hitmen who don't work in the ordinary way...and this is where a major fantasy element joins the cartoon zaniness: In the still of a nearly cloudless night, two assassins hired by the Axe Gang seek to take out the brave inhabitants of Pig Sty Village, who have stood up to their terror. These assassins use a long, autoharp-type instrument to strum out very sino-fiendly chords that somehow manage to produce lethal weapons and figures out of thin air. They set these against the tailor, the baker and the landlady, the tailor and the baker having surprised you earlier with their kung fu expertise...with images of flying sabers, armored zombies and spears. The landlady manages to take them out with her patented "Lion's Roar", sending them whee-wee-wee, all the way home!<br /><br />If you buy but ONE kung fu movie in your life, make it this one! This is, hands down, the funniest, most enjoyable martial arts movie I've seen so far, and I've seen all of Bruce Lee's major releases!</p></br><a href="../users/A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ.html">A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ</a><br/><p>For the most part, I like my martial arts films to be as realistic as possible, but I have no problem taking a walk on the cinematic wild side, especially when the special effects are as impressive as those in this film.  Kung Fu Hustle can't be compared to any other single movie or genre.  Regardless of its excesses, the martial arts action in the film is something to behold.  Underneath all of the comedy and over-the-top visual delights (and it can be almost cartoonish at times), there's also a seriousness to the film.  It's all about good vs. evil, self-realization, and stepping up to meet your destiny.  And, as much as I hate to say it, I thought the ending was quite sweet.  The extraordinary special effects dominate the film and any viewer's discussion of it, but don't let that fool you into thinking there isn't a substantive story behind all of the flash.<br /><br />The toughest hombres around are the members of the Two Axe Gang; put a Japanese face on John Dillinger, give him a pair of axes, and you've the old-time mobster look and feel of these guys down.  They usually leave the slum areas alone, but Pig Sty Alley, run by a seemingly wimpy landlord and the toughest landlady you'd ever want to meet, ends up in the gang's crosshairs thanks to a couple of bad guy wannabes (and perpetual screwups) trying to insinuate themselves into the gang.  Sing (Stephen Chow) desperately wants to be a bad guy, having paid a price as a child for trying to live up to his destiny (a rather questionable one, at that) of bringing peace to the world.  The landlady's mean attitude isn't enough to hold off untold dozens of axe-wielding gangsters, but the town is saved by three kung fu masters who had moved there in search of a peaceful life.  Rest assured there are repercussions, as the Two Axe Gang brings in some of the world's most deadly killers to exact revenge - starting with a pair of musicians with a unique, decidedly deadly playing style.  Later, they have Sing engineer a breakout of the Beast, the deadliest killer of them all.  He doesn't look like much, but the Beast is an almost unstoppable force.  The only person who can possibly take him on with any chance of success is a natural-born, kung fu genius - and those are pretty darn rare.<br /><br />The special effects of the many fight scenes go way beyond the kind of wire work seen in, say, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, and also out-Matrix The Matrix; on occasion, you'll see stuff right out of Hanna-Barbera cartoons.  Does this make the movie too goofy for its own good?  Somehow, it really doesn't.  If you're going to go to the extreme with your action, you might as well go all the way - and that is most certainly what Kung Fu Hustle does.  From a chase right out of Road Runner cartoons to the perfectly ridiculous Toad Style of fighting perfected by the Beast, you'll laugh - but you'll also be in awe at how well the scenes play.<br /><br />Basically, Kung Fu Hustle is just a complete hoot of a movie.  As writer, director, and star, Stephen Chow has produced a pure winner capable of entertaining fans across a range of genres.  Even he cannot steal the limelight from Leung Siu Lung, however, as this landlady, with a cigarette perpetually hanging out of her mouth, truly roars - both literally and figuratively.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>Shanghai, China, the 1930s.  The Axe Gang is taking over the town but is not interested in the poor slums. This leaves the residents of Pig Sty Alley to deal with their overbearing Landlady. One day, Sing (Stephen Chow) and his sidekick,  walk into the Alley and attempt to blackmail people there. When the residents of the tenement stand up to fight him, he reveals that he is part of the Axe Gang and signals for help. Gang members show up and the landlady and the tenement residents fight them off. The Axe Gang realizes that they have been called to help someone who is not a part of the gang, but Sing is desperate to become a member. Now that the gang and the residents of Pig Sty Alley have met, they can't back down from each other, fighting until one group is victorious. The leader of the Axe Gang realizes that he will not be able to fight them alone and brings in The Beast.<br /><br />"Kung Fu Hustle", written and directed by the star, Stephen Chow, is a fun, exhilarating, fast-paced film, borrowing elements from and paying homage to many other genres. Chow is clearly a filmmaker who loves films; he seems like a kid in a candy store. Now that he can make a film, how many different types of things can he get into the story? "Hustle" combines all of these elements in a way that is fresh and exciting.<br /><br />The opening sequence is a homage to police interrogation films and westerns. When the opposing sides face off on a dusty road, we are transported from Shanghai to the Wild West. The sky turns magenta and everybody faces off, preparing for a classic gun fight. This scene is very theatrical, comical and sets the tone for the remainder of the film. Of course, we aren't in the Old West and the leader of the Axe Gang uses an axe to prove his point and keep us firmly rooted in the world of kung-fu.<br /><br />The story is a framework for Chow to throw each and every trick in the book at the audience. After he introduces the Axe Gang, we then meet the residents of Pig Sty Alley. Landlord walks through the shops, receiving tributes and terrorizing everyone in a jovial way. Until he meets up with his wife, Landlady, who terrorizes her husband. Everyone in the Alley appears perfectly normal until Sing shows up.<br /><br />When the two groups meet, we learn that people have special skills that they hesitate to use, unless absolutely necessary. They will do anything to protect their lives and friends. This leads to a series of amusing, entertaining fights, in which their skills are comically enhanced by special effects. Chow deftly blends all of these elements together making them appear somehow natural. Amazing considering all of the special effects, cartoon style action and over the top acting. Once we have accepted that these things can happen in this universe, we can accept the behavior as it becomes more cartoonish and more outlandish.<br /><br />The story, while slight, is effective at creating a character that we can root for. Chow's Sing is just a guy looking to join the Axe Gang, but as he witnesses their brutality, he seems more drawn to the people of Pig Sty Alley. He realizes that their efforts to use their powers, only when absolutely necessary, to defend themselves, is the more responsible course of action. Throughout the film, we see glimpses of a pivotal moment in his childhood; he saves a deaf mute girl from a bunch of bullies and buys a book about kung-fu from a street beggar. Later, we learn that Sing may be the Chosen One. To live up to this prophecy, he has to make some changes in his life.<br /><br />All of these over-the-top, disparate elements combined together would normally create a mess of a film. In "Hustle", they come together to create a fun, enjoyable film that will hopefully spur filmmakers to come up with more creative ways to tell a story.</p></br><a href="../users/AMNNPDX9MFEUD.html">AMNNPDX9MFEUD</a><br/><p>Kung Fu (or Kung Fu Hustle as I understand the title is open to debate) is a terrifically fun movie to watch. The comedy is not quite so prevalent as in Shaolin Soccer and there is a darker side to this movie with more violence, but it is so thoroughly engaging and entertaining that I could watch it over and over and over.<br />Stephen Chow brings the goods; the insane kung fu, the Looney Tunes moments, the hilarious characters, and the warm back story of Chow's character and his childhood introduction to a deaf mute girl, and wraps it up in this non-stop action packed darkly comedic delight.<br />How movies like this go unnoticed while tripe like Rush Hour gets made ad nauseum is a mystery to me, but if you enjoy this genre, you will love this movie. Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>The stylish and stylized "Kung Fu Hustle" is, as its name implies, a goofy martial arts parody done with rare good humor and a keen sense of the absurd.  It is a tale of gangsters and wannabe gangsters going up against a half dozen or so of the finest fighters in the lower class part of town.  However, the plot is merely a framing device for a series of amazing fight sequences that showcase not only the performers' incredible skills as stunt men (and women) but the filmmaking prowess of those behind the camera as well.  Writer/director Stephen Chow (who also plays the main role) turns his flesh-and-blood actors into the equivalent of cartoon characters, unaffected by the laws of gravity and physics, as they are stabbed repeatedly, fall from impossible heights, and suffer incredible bodily abuse, only to pick themselves up, dust themselves off, and continue on fighting as if nothing out of the ordinary had happened.  The razor sharp editing and multi-speed camerawork - ranging from fast-motion to freeze framing - also contribute immeasurably to the surrealistic tone of the film.<br /><br />It's true that "Kung Fu Hustle" is definitely an acquired taste, and to those who are not aficionados of the art form, much of the movie can seem repetitive and silly.  And even for the most passionate of devotees, it can still be too much of a good thing.  The plot is frequently incoherent and the characters wafer-thin, but the stunning look and extraordinary energy level of the film make it a must-see for diehard fans of the martial arts.</p></br></body></html>

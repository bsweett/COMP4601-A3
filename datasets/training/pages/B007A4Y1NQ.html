The cameo by Charlie Sheen is the funniest part of the  film. I think Catherine Keener gives an amazing performance as a  self-centered coworker. She makes the character strangely attractive even I  wanted her. Enough about the film, what about the DVD? The standard theater  trailer and four 30 second TV spots are included. A documentary on  puppeteering is included which is sort of interesting. A 3-minute interview  with the director as he's driving is funny. It's like a motorcycle gang is  chasing him. I guess that's what working for a studio is like. Finally the  best part is a 6-minute interview/rant with a background driver for the NJ  turnpike scenes. That has to be the funniest thing. You just want to  sit-down, have a beer and let this person entertain you for hours. A DVD  that I wouldn't pay full price for I think I'd look for it on a discount or  previously-viewed  rack for the scenes I liked and the extras.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L8HRCM60W0W7.html">A1L8HRCM60W0W7</a><br/><p>Let's get the praise over with first. <p>This unconventional movie starts with a very intriguing notion, brilliantly surreal and off-centre, basically something very different from mainstream cinema but still playful and fun. It rakes up some thoughtful issues -- <p>(1) The real sexual desires buried deep in human minds;<br />(2) The need of ordinary folk to want to be someone else, someone more *seemingly* glamorous than themselves;<br />(3) The expressiveness of the puppeting medium; some of the puppeteer sequences are simply breathtaking;<br />(4) The swiftness with which people would pounce on the weakness of other humans to start making money;<br />(5) In parts, the jerk-a-tear statement about animal bondage;<br />(6) And tying in all these loose sub-ends, the ultimate notion of freedom and love of self, etc etc. <p>All that is well and dandy, and this is easily one of the most creative movies out of Hollywood in recent times. <p>However, having just watched it a second time I must say it's a bit of an empty shell once you get beyond the surprise factor. I didn't laugh, I smirked the odd time, and certainly my heart wasn't warmed - it's a very cold movie really, nothing wrong with that, but it's hardly one that will merit lasting affection.<p>It's a strange mixture really, because there is some sort of pretension to art at times, yet at others the characters and the emotions are paper-thin. Yet we're supposed somehow to be affected by these characters despite the fact that the film mocks and satirises them at every opportunity - the difference between this and the Coens is that they love even their most repellent characters and it rubs off on you!<p>In the end my reaction to this is the same as to the Naked Gun or one of those broad hit-and-miss comedies - it's the same schtick. Towards the fourth quarter of the movie, I was just hoping it could all be put to an end soon. <p>The director's interview on the DVD is funnier in two minutes than the rest of the film put together.</p></br><a href="../users/A3QZCA4LTTVGAD.html">A3QZCA4LTTVGAD</a><br/><p>&quot;Being John Malkovich,&quot; directed by Spike Jonze from a screenplay by Charlie Kaufman, was in my opinion one of the most brilliant films of the late 20th century. The film tells the story of an out-of-work puppeteer (an excellent John Cusack) who discovers a portal into the mind of actor John Malkovich (played, curiously enough, by John Malkovich!).<p>BJM is a claustrophobic workplace satire, a surreal sex comedy, a gender-bending love story, and an innovative blending of science fiction and fantasy. Furthermore, the film is a reflection on interspecies communication and the nature of language, a metaphysical exploration of the nature of life and identity, and a somber meditation on the role of the artist in a consumeristic society.<p>Cusack and Malkovich are joined by a superb ensemble cast that brings complete conviction to this bizarre material. Orson Bean is particularly hilarious as Cusack's daffy, horny boss; he delivers his frequently outrageous dialogue brilliantly.<p>BJM is as notable for its stunning visual effects as it is for its amazing dialogue. Such sights as a giant Emily Dickinson puppet give the film a weird, Willie Wonka-ish flavor. Also marvelous are the parodic &quot;films within a film&quot; that spice up the whole. And the film is nicely enhanced by Carter Burwell's fine musical score.<p>BJM is imaginative and truly original; the film's concept is realized brilliantly by a talented cast and crew. I give it my highest recommendation.</p></br><a href="../users/A319YRDK8Y39N.html">A319YRDK8Y39N</a><br/><p>How Being John Malkovitch was ever made I'll never understand. It is so bizarre, different, clever and out-there that no production company should have ever approved it. Yet they did, and for that I am ever so grateful.<p>Just the story synopsis sounds so crazy. A puppeteer working on the 7 1/2 floor (originally built for midgets) finds a portal leading to the head of real life actor John Malkovitch, allowing annoying entering it to be Malkovitch for 15 minutes before being spit out on the side of the New Jersey Turnpike. Wow. And the movie is so much more weird then that. The first time I saw it, my mouth was wide open in shock. How did this movie get made? It's so crazy it's wonderful.<p>With such a the head-trip of a story, it's easy to skip over the wonderful performances by the cast. John Cusack and Cameron Diaz look and act positively convincing as a poor, ugly and strange couple in New York. Catherine Keener is superb as a power-hungry, greedy woman who Cusack and Diaz both fall for, and of course Malkovitch as himself is both strange and intoxicating. Is it how he really acts? You never really know. And that's part of the charm of this wonderful film. The line of reality and fiction at times becomes fuzzy. A characteristic that writer Charlie Kaufman and director Spike Jonze play even more with in their follow-up Adaptation.<p>Of course, all this weirdness means this film isn't for everyone. Some will scoff at it's "too cleverness" or walk out thoroughly confused. But for those who love the theater of the absurd, this will be pure paradise. One of the most unique and memorable films to come out under the Hollywood radar in a long time. This gets my high recommendation.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>I have a theory: audiences are getting smarter. Whereas before a big Hollywood movie with a massive marketing push would've been all the rage, now people are starting to know better. They're realizing that a terrible movie's a terrible movie no matter how often we can see Julia Roberts deal with more romantic comedic mishaps or much stuff Michael Bay can destroy. So when a movie comes along like Being John Malkovich, or Memento or even visually impressive like the Matrix, we stand up and take notice. Building a career largely from inventive music videos, first time director Spike Jonze comes out of the gate with probably the most unconventional comedy you'll see.<br /><br />Loserly Craig Schwartz (John Cusack, always good) is an aspiring puppeteer who can't get any work. Then he has his dishevelled looking wife Lotte (Cameron Diaz) leaving in their small New York apartment with pets everywhere since Lotte's a pet store worker. Craig, due to his puppeteering skills gets accepted at a company located, amusingly, on the 7 1/2 floor, complete with cramped ceilings. He also has a strong attraction to one of his co-workers, feisty Maxine (Catherine Keener). One day while working, he discovers a small day and going inside he finds out he can see the world through John Malkovich's eyes for 15 minutes with an unceromonious dump on the New Jersey turnpike ditch.<br /><br />Craig and Maxine get an idea: charge 200$ for people to experience being John Malkovich which is a novel idea until Lotte goes through and feels a deeper connection, especially around the idea of Maxine. Then we have a bizarre love square or star or something since Craig loves Maxine who loves Lotte but only when Lotte is inside John Malkovich...'s head. Try not to wrap your head around it since it's better explained in the movie and after awhile you don't even worry about stuff like vessels or portals, you just go with it.<br /><br />Casting is of course important and no one seems wasted, even Diaz, who I normally can't stand. The real treat though is of course Malkovich since at times you almost can't tell if he's acting or if he's really that quirky. Then there's the comedy which is subtle to the first-was-funny-but-now-it-ain't like the 7 1/2 floor and the small ceilings but then the film shows you what happens when Malkovich steps through his own portal and it becomes not only a technical marvel but one of the flat-out funniest things I've seen lately. Only problem with the story is that at a certain point it shifts gears and the film almost speed walks to its climax rather than lurching forward, like it was shot in the foot.<br /><br />Like the Amazon review says, I don't know if the film can warrant repeat viewings and you can get more out of it every time you see it but that first viewing is quite something.</p></br><a href="../users/A2A6NH6DPE0VXR.html">A2A6NH6DPE0VXR</a><br/><p>I really<br />  like unusual films that you can't make much sense of them like Brazil<br />  or Fight Club and Being John Malkovich is right up there, it's about<br />  a puppeteer named Craig (John Cusack) and his obsession for his partner<br />  Maxine (Cathrine Keener) who doesn't really like him much, her ways<br />  of making him feel like 2 cents are hilarious. Well it's not all about<br />  that, did I mention Craig finds a doorway to John Malkovich's head<br />  that allows you to be John Malkovich and that him and Maxine start<br />  charging people that wanna try it. Oh yeah and Maxine is in love with<br />  Craig's wife, well when she's in Malkovich. The result is a wacky, funny and very original<br />  film with unusual charactors. A really good start for Spike Jonze,<br />  he should have a great career behind him if he makes more films as<br />  original as this.</p></br><a href="../users/A17N23WXA7EAF.html">A17N23WXA7EAF</a><br/><p>I think almost every reviewer will agree that this is one of the most original American films in years. &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot; is wild, outragious and bizarre on many levels. But it is also lyrical and superbly witty. Every time I saw this film I felt like one of my surreal classmates from second grade had grown up and made a movie. But somewhere along the way it seemed that that kid had developed a tremendous understanding of life, of literature and of the audience. <p>One of the refreshing things about &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot; is that it manages to be wild and unique without trying too hard. It balances an outlandish plot with a subtle and intelligent wit that permeates the entire film.<p>Even the best American films tend to be a little too full of themselves at times. The great thing about this one is that it threw out all assumptions about film making and pushed everything to the envelope WITHOUT any visible trace of effort.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FRKEXDXDN1KI.html">A2FRKEXDXDN1KI</a><br/><p>Spike Jonze was best known in the early '90s for his music videos.  From Beastie Boys "Sabotage", R.E.M.'s "Parallel" to Bjork's "Volumen", Jonze would get the opportunity to direct his first major film titled "Being John Malkovich", written by Charlie Kaufman ("Eternal Sunshin of the Spotless Mind", "Adaptation", "Syndecdoche, New York").<br /><br />The film resonated strongly with younger viewers and also receive rave reviews from film critics, "Being John Malkovich" would win over 45 awards and receive over 45 nominations including Academy Award nominations for "Best Director", "Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly For the Screen" and "Best Actress in a Supporting Role" (Catherine Keener).<br /><br />Championed for its originality, "Being John Malkovich" will now be released on Blu-ray and DVD courtesy of the Criterion Collection in May 2012.<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />"Being John Malkovich" is presented in widescreen 1:85:1 and is a new digital transfer.  According to Spike Jonze, this Criterion Collection release "matches what our original print looked like and how we were never able to get that when we put out the DVD before".<br /><br />With that being said, its important to note that if you want the best video and audio quality of "Being John Malkovich", it's recommended that one purchases the Blu-ray release.  Having owned the original DVD release of "Being John Malkovich", the quality of the film is definitely an upgrade for this Criterion Collection DVD.  There is a bit more clarity and detail but I'm confident that the Blu-ray version will probably feature even better detail and clarity.<br /><br />As for the picture quality, according to the Criterion Collection, "Being John Malkovich" was supervised by director Spike Jone and cinematographer Lance Acord.  The new digital transfer was created in 4K resolution on a DFT SCANITY film scanner from the original 35mm camera negative.  The datea was then color corrected on a DaVinci Resolve at Company 3, with colorist Stefan Sonnenfeld.  Thousands of instances of dirt, debris, scratches, splices and warps were manually removed using MTI's DRS, while Image Systems' Phoenix was used for small, dirt, grain, jitter, flicker and noise reduction.<br /><br />As for the audio, the audio is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1. Dialogue is crystal clear and I heard no hiss or any audio problems during my viewing.  While the film is primarily dialogue, there is good use of surround channels during the entry to John Malkovich's head.  Once again, for better audio quality, I recommend going for the Blu-ray version for even better audio clarity and dynamic range on its lossless audio track.  Otherwise, the DVD sounds very good..<br /><br />According to the Criterion Collection, the 5.1 surround soundtrack was created from the original 6-track magnetic master.  Clicks, pops, etc. were removed using ProTools HD and then translated into foreign languages and redubbed to our original soundtrack master.  Crackle was attenuated using AudioCube's integrated workstation.<br /><br />English subtitles are presented in English SDH.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />"Being John Malkovich - The Criterion Collection #611" comes with the following special features:<br /><br />  All Noncombatants Please Clear the Set - (33:18) Filmmaker Lance Bangs documented the entire shoot of "Being John Malkovich" back in 1998 and trimmed it down to a half-hour portrait of the atmosphere on the set.<br />  John Malkovich and John Hodgman - (27:49) John Hodgman interviews John Malkovich about the film.<br />  Spike's Photos - (15:28) Made by filmmaker Lance Bangs, Spike Jonze showcases photos he took on the set of "Being John Malkovich".<br />  7 1/2 Floor Orientation - (2:12) The orientation video that Craig Schwartz watched before starting his new job.<br />  "American Arts & Culture" Presents John Horatio Malkovich: "Dance of Despair and Disillusionment" - (4:17) The episode of "American Arts & Culture Presents John Malkovich" that was seen in the film.<br />  An Intimate Portrait of the Art of Puppeteering - (7:20) A featurette by filmmaker Lance Bangs about puppeteering and how it was used in the film.<br />  TV Spots - Featuring four TV spots for "Being John Malkovich: JM Inc., Tunnel, Spithead and Vesselis humanus.<br />  Trailer - (1:55) The original theatrical trailer for "Being John Malkovich".<br /><br />EXTRAS:<br /><br />  16-Page booklet - "Being John Malkovich" comes with a 16-page booklet with the following essay: "The Original Piece of Wood I Left In Your Head: Spike Jonze in Conversation with Perkus Tooth".<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />Original and captivating, Spike Jonze and Charlie Kaufman's "Being John Malkovich" was a film that no one would ever expect to be made into a film, but because of its originality, it has become one of the most groundbreaking films to be released in America within the last 15 years.<br /><br />Back in May  2000, during my original DVD review of "Being John Malkovich", I often wrote about how original the film was and how Spike Jonze was going to be the next big director in the U.S. because of this film.  There was no doubt that "Being John Malkovich" was a film that would resonate strongly with independent filmmakers, younger audiences and the film critics, but watch the film again in 2012, you also realize how this film was ahead of its time.<br /><br />In the beginning, "Being John Malkovich" had a banal style of a man who lives a life that is not going all that great, his love for puppeteering is not as welcomed in today's society nor is it a way for him to make a living and there is a sense of disconnection with his wife, who shows more love to her animals (which he could care less of).  And the main character, Craig Schwartz starts to have a sexual attraction to his co-worker.  Once again, seems banal but that's where things take a twist.<br /><br />Who would ever think of a film where people can enter a tunnel and enter the mind of actor John Malkovich.  And those who experience it literally go through a life-changing experience.<br /><br />On paper, the explanation of "Being John Malkovich" seems as if it is being penned by someone trippin' on acid, but what he have is a writer striving for originality and a young director at the time who was creative and did thing his way.<br /><br />Charlie Kaufman is a writer who loves creating original stories and since "Being John Malkovich", he has continued this audacious style through films such as "Synecdoche, New York", "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind", "Confessions of a dangerous Mind" and "Adaptation".  And Spike Jonze is a director that knows how to interpret Kaufman's originality with his own.  Jonze is not a product of traditional Hollywood.  He has come from a music video background and is known for his fascinating and cool videos for The Beastie Boys, Bjork, R.E.M., The Chemical Brothers, Weezer and many others.<br /><br />He is a product of a young, talented filmmakers that are known for creativity and he has shown that in his films such as "Adaptation", "Where the Wild Things Are" but creativity that also goes even farther when he and a group of friends created Dirt Magazine, he owns the Girl skateboard company and the collaboration between Jonez and Kaufman have been successful.<br /><br />Back to "Being John Malkovich", part of the allure of the film is how people want to experience the life of a celebrity.  And they can see it up front.  It's an invasion of privacy but yet people revel in it.  I don't think Kaufman or Jonze would know how life would change for celebrities with social media, Facebook, Twitter and how information is so readily out there for outlets like TMZ.com and regular people to know what celebrities are thinking and where they are at, almost real time.<br /><br />There are so many things that made me laugh while watching this film.  From the 7 1/2 floor where Craig works and seeing the ceilings so low, with a crazy orientation video, add in a woman who misunderstands everything that is being said, a crazy boss, a sexy (golddigging) co-worker and a puppeteer who seems normal but yet has some creepy qualities.<br /><br />And that led to the unexpected nature of how this film was going to play out.  I remember watching this film and thinking of how original this film was but also how exciting it was because it didn't follow banal traditions or storytelling.  And watching it again over a decade later, "Being John Malkovich" is still a wonderful film!<br /><br />John Cusack did a wonderful job of playing the creep Craig Schwarz and this is probably one of the few films starring Cameron Diaz (and Charlie Sheen) which I actually do like.  But both Catherine Keener and even John Malkovich himself were great in the film and how cool Malkovich was of the film's humor and the use of his persona.  For Keener, her appearance on "Being John Malkovich" would eventually lead the actress to appear in more films by Jonze and Kaufman and for Malkovich, if "Dangerous Liasons" or "Con Air" didn't make audiences know much about the actor, this film surely generated interest in him.<br /><br />And it was also great to see Octavia Spencer in an earlier, shorter role a decade before she would win awards for her role on "The Help".<br /><br />As for this new release from the Criterion Collection, eventually the new digital transfer is enticing since the film is on Blu-ray but for the DVD version which I am reviewing, the DVD looks and sounds good and as Jonz said, with the previous DVD's, he wasn't able to get the color to match to the original print, until now.  So, while the Blu-ray release is surely the definitive version to own, those who don't own a Blu-ray player and are fine with DVD, will still enjoy this release from the Criterion Collection.<br /><br />For those who owned the older DVD, while the majority of the special features are on this new Criterion Collection release, one thing that is new is the conversation between John Malkovich and actor John Hodgman (better known to many as the PC guy in the older Apple Mac commercials).  This interview was much more informative and enjoyable to watch than the older "An Interview with Spike Jonze"  which was not good at all.<br /><br />But what it comes down to is the new digital transfer and the Criterion Collection giving it a 4K digital transfer is a big deal because this film looks great on DVD and magnificent on Blu-ray.<br /><br />Overall, if you are a big fan of "Being John Malkovich" or a person who is curious about this film (or Criterion Collector who will buy the film no matter what), this film is a worthy addition to the Criterion Collection and is definitely recommended!</p></br><a href="../users/A20TJ5P97W5MS1.html">A20TJ5P97W5MS1</a><br/><p>Have you ever wanted to feel what its really like in a another persons body? How about a famous person? How about John Malkovich? Well this is a complete & thorough study of what that might be like and what could go wrong if that experience was available to pretty much anyone willing to pay a small price. This is actually a very interesting movie that came out in the very interesting year of 1999. It stars John Malkovich, John Cusack (one of the greatest hopeless romantics of all time, this guy never wins), Cameron Diaz, and Cathrine Keener all in arguably career defining roles. This film is a tour de force in strange and abstract film making. It is experimental cinema at its finest. The concept of entering the mind of John Malcovich is stretched in many different ways. The meaning behind Being John Malkovich could be interpreted exponentially. It is a success because it ultimately comes down to what is going on inside your head while you are watching this strange and bizarre gem.<br /><br />John Malcovich: I got to know the truth!<br /><br />Charlies Sheen: Truth is for suckers, Johnny Boy.</p></br><a href="../users/A2T7TZBOTP68C7.html">A2T7TZBOTP68C7</a><br/><p>This movie is different from any other movie ever made.  It is a fun trip that raises many thoughtful questions.  WARNING:  DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE IF YOU SUFFER FROM PARANOID DELUSIONS OR SUBSCRIBE TO MATRIX-TYPE CONSPIRACY THEORIES.  It will send you over the edge.  The basic story is that down-on-his-luck wanna be puppeteer John Cusack reluctantly gets a day job at the gentle urging of his frumpy wife (yes they make her a frump) Cameron Diaz.  This day job changes both their lives as Cusack discovers a portal that leads to John Malkovich's head.  Nothing and no one is what they seem, and it is very hard to see who is controlling who, even at the very end.  <p>I can't imagine John Malkovich's face when he was approached with this screenplay.  I can't believe anyone in his right mind wouldn't run the other way when presented with even the most basic premise for this film.  But then again, at least in the movie, Malkovich is anything but in his right mind.  Heck, for most of the film, he isn't even IN his mind.  Creepy, huh?  Creepy doesn't even begin to cover it.  But I highly recommend it.  Just be warned not to drive or operate heavy machinery after seeing it. <p>This movie is best watched late at night.  Most of the scenes are in fact shot at nighttime, adding positively to the surreal effect of the story.  Cusack, Diaz, and Malkovich turn in wonderful performances.  Catherine Keener is suitably hateable as the selfish Maxine. <p>This movie encourages you to look deep beneath the surface of a person.  It is also good for some serious out-loud laughs.</p></br><a href="../users/A27RJ30RN5K9MX.html">A27RJ30RN5K9MX</a><br/><p>Craig Schwartz ( John Cusack)dreams of being a successful puppeteer, but is struggling to make ends meet. To make some extra money, he takes a job as a filing clerk. One day at work, he accidentally stumbles onto a door, that is really a portal into the brain of John Malkovich. For fifteen minutes, he sees, hears, and experiences everything that Malkovich does. Then he is dumped onto the New Jersey turnpike. Together with his beautiful co-worker Maxine ( Catherine Keener), and pet-obsessed wife Lotte (Cameron Diaz), they come up with a way to make &quot;Being John Malovich&quot; a profitable one, by charging 200 bucks a trip. The only problem, is that Malkovich starts to learn about what's going on... <p>&quot;Being John Malkovich&quot; is one of the funniest and most original films I have ever seen in my life. The script is amazing with its combination of puppetry, infidelity, and out of body experiences. The love triangle between Keener, Diaz, and Cusak is extremely well done, and fun to watch. It is also extremely funny, because they are only attracted to each other when they are inside Malkovich. The three really offer top notch performances. However, the best performance of all was given by the man himself John Malkovich. John is extremely funny in the role, and gives an accurate portrayal of what one would go through in his situation. Watching him as a puppeteer,will have you in tears from laughing so hard. The camera work on this film is outstanding. The film is actually shot at times, from the inside of John's head, looking out. <p>This extremely funny, and bizare film is truly one of the best films that I have seen in the last couple of years. The plot is extremely interesting and creative, the acting is perfect all the way around, and the camera work is amazing. The DVD is outstanding and offers an interview with director Spike Jonze, a look at the art of puppeteering, and a lot more. Definately a must own for anyone's DVD collection.</p></br><a href="../users/AL277B4AQCWBG.html">AL277B4AQCWBG</a><br/><p>This is the kind of film that can restore your faith in American cinema. That it was even produced is a miracle, let alone received Oscar nominations. Unjustly deprived of the award for Best Original Screenplay (losing to "American Beauty"), Charlie Kaufman's magnificently absurd story works on so many levels: as surrealist fantasy, as a critique of our fascination with fame, as an acid inquiry into gender, power games and sexual manipulation, and, more simply, as just one hell of a funny trip. What's particularly impressive is that despite his story being relentlessly and increasingly ludicrous, Kaufman manages to tie-up all the loose ends and deliver an ending which is as heartbreaking as it is hilarious. He also gives us some of the funniest lines ever spoken on screen, to wit: 'Behind the stubble, the too prominent brow, and male pattern baldness, I sensed you feminine longing.' Spike Jonze extracts near-perfect performances from his high-calibre cast, with Cameron Diaz and Catherine Keener cleverly playing against type, and John Cusack showing his incredible versatility. Three cheers for originality and having the courage to follow it through.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CZICCYP2M5PX.html">A1CZICCYP2M5PX</a><br/><p>A mopey Puppeter (John Cusack) working as a file clerk on the 7?

It looked just plain silly to me.  And yet, it's received accolades from critics everywhere.  And so I decided to catch up on what everyone was making such a fuss about and see the DVD.  Oh my!  What a film!  I've never seen anything so innovative and creative in my life!<p>John Cusak stars as an out-of-work puppeteer.  Cameron Diaz is his wife.  Catherine Keener is the sassy woman they both find attractive.  And John Malkovich plays a version of himself.  All are excellent actors.  And all are exceptional.  How the writer, Charlie Kaufman, ever thought up the premise is amazing.  And the director, Spike Jonze, certainly knew how to make it all fit together.<p>This is a comedy with depth.  And the laughs and insights keep getting better.  There's an office building with a floor numbered 7-1/2.  It's only 4 feet high and everyone who works there has to walk around half stooped over.  Then there's a secret doorway behind a file cabinet.  When a person crawls in, he or she falls down a tunnel and finds himself or herself inside the brain of the actor John Malkovich for a mere 15 minutes.  Soon, Catherine Keener and John Cusak are selling tickets to people who want to experience this.  Soon, too, Cameron Diaz gets hooked  - so much so that, with an interesting gender-bender twist of the plot, she finds herself being John Malkovich while making love to Catherine Keener.  And that's just one of the many sub-plots.<p>Sound confusing?  Well it's not.  It might sound silly, but as a viewer I was completely there with the story all the way, letting myself enjoy the twists and turns of the plot that just kept getting better as this intriguing tale moved along.  It's all very surreal.  And it's absolutely brilliant.<p>Later, I thought about all the themes it touched on.  The puppeteer theme had to do with manipulation, both with puppets and with real people.  Everyone was manipulated in this film, and different people pulled the strings at different times.  It also had to do with what it means to be a celebrity.  And what, actually, is identity? <p>I loved this film and hoped the DVD would have some good special features.  I yearned for insight into the making of the film and I wished there were interviews with the actors.  Instead, there's scene with an &quot;extra&quot; who had the job of driving a car back and forth all night so that the headlights would give the appropriate background for one of the shots.  And a scene where the director feels sick and throws up.  However, when I think about it, what can I expect from such off-beat filmmakers?<p>This is the most refreshing film to come out of Hollywood that I've ever seen.  It might not be for everyone but I thought it was great!  It therefore gets one of my highest recommendations.</p></br><a href="../users/A3IKBHODOTYYHM.html">A3IKBHODOTYYHM</a><br/><p>Certainly Being John Malkovich's concept is incomparable to most, if not, all films. It explores the themes of identity--and lack thereof--in every day people, and their inner desires. While the film's concept is highly unique and novel, it isn't enough to make up for the direction the film takes after its initial surprise. The film's second half, in particular, steers away from its own creativity and into mediocrity, with unmemorable characters and a simplistically cynical plot. In the end, this is a film that is watchable at times, but also unappealing and unlikable.<br /><br />It wasn't the nonsensical aspect of this film that put me off; it was the direction it takes after about thirty minutes or so. Clearly, there is inventiveness at the beginning. John Cusack plays Craig Schwartz, a puppeteer, aimless in life with an unfulfilling marriage and an inability to find a puppeteering job (imagine that). Taking a job at an office, he apparently has found a dimension into the mind of John Malkovich, a portal where a person can go and literally experience John Malkovich's life for fifteen minutes. He and his female coworker concoct a scheme to charge to go into the portal. Craig tells his wife, Lotte, also of this portal, and she experiences a strange euphoric feeling after going through once. John Malkovich gets wind of the portal, and goes to experience it. At times this film has some fun moments: the scene where John Malkovich goes into his "own" portal to see what it is like is rather amusing. He sees a line up of eagerly waiting customers. Craig's first entrance into the portal as John Malkovich is comical. However, rather than continuing on with the eccentric concept of "being John Malkovich", the film's takes a different direction, as the plot's second half veers off into pettiness, with the main characters, in particular Craig's wife, going into the portal with the purpose of fulfilling their sexual desires. Some call this original; I call it selling out.<br /><br />I know that likable characters don't completely make a movie, but the fact that every character is basically unlikable doesn't help much, either.  John Cusack's character is so weak, and seeing him falling all over himself for some office worker gets old. One watches him and wonders what motivations he possibly has. Cameron Diaz' character is also self-centered, caring only for herself and her desires to be with the other female. The female coworker is also cold and grates on your nerves as the film progresses. The only redeeming character is probably John Malkovich himself, who is at least able to be a good sport about making himself the center of the joke.<br /><br />I guess it is quirky and different, in a cold, spiritless kind of way. I'd have to say that this film is vastly overrated, and not one I'd want to watch again.</p></br><a href="../users/AWEOR1WZSMBEZ.html">AWEOR1WZSMBEZ</a><br/><p>I heard one newscaster (maybe from CNN) mention BJM but I did not know who the actors were (not even sure if John was included) nor have I seen the trailer.  So when I viewed the movie, together with my husband, it was really a pleasant surprise!<p>We all know how unique the screenplay was, no need to go into details.  &amp; all throughout the movie, I did not recognize Cusack nor Diaz, just Malkovich.  Just imagine how you can enjoy watching a movie when most of the characters seemed alien to you--- &amp; you did actually enjoy it!<p>It's funny, at the same time sad, to realize how people are so dissatisfied with their own lives &amp; would even pay to be someone else, even for a very short time.  &amp; to think that the people we admire are happy &amp; content in their shell is a big misnomer as well! Is life really that cruel that noone can find contentment in themselves?<p>Another idea conveyed in the movie is man's fear of death.  We saw how the 'old folks' evaded death &amp; their continuos search for immortality by entering &amp; hiding in another person's brain/portal, or whatever you may call it.<p>Yes, the movie is really unique.  At a glance, it is funny because the characters acted weird &amp; comic.

Overflowing with imagination and creativity, it manages to breathe new life into that  trickiest of cinematic genres - the surrealist satire. Like all films that  dare to take risks, `Being John Malkovich' sometimes stumbles in the paths  it chooses to take, but at least its course is always an innovative and  fascinating one.<p>John Cusack stars as Craig Schwartz, a soft-spoken  nebbish leading a life less of quiet desperation than of overwhelming  blandness. Unable to support himself as a puppeteer, he finally succumbs to  his wife's pressure to seek out a job, landing a position as file clerk in  a bizarre company located on the 7 ? th floor of a Manhattan office  building. One of the triumphs of the film is that it portrays the surreal  in such an understated and quiet way. This floor has ceilings so low that  the people who work on it must continually crouch as they move about their  business, yet they all accept that fact with an uncomplaining and  unquestioning good humor. Even when Schwartz discovers a strange portal  hidden behind some cabinets leading directly into John Malkovich's brain,  all those to whom Craig reveals his secret take very little convincing both  to believe him and to experiment with it themselves. Thus, by creating a  world that already appears slightly askew in its reality - Craig's wife, in  addition, runs a pet shop and therefore fills their house with a menagerie  of exotic animals -the film makes it possible for us to go along with the  characters' otherwise inexplicably blas&eacute; reactions.<p>Writer Charlie  Kaufman and director Spike Jonze hit upon a number of fascinating themes in  the course of their bizarre musings. Craig, for instance, learns that there  exists a certain safety in the tediousness of everyday life, for the moment  he allows the extraordinary to enter his ordered world he unleashes  passions - that have been long dormant both in himself and his wife - which  he finds himself unable to control. His wife, in particular, whom he has  mistakenly pigeonholed as a woman concerned only with the humdrum  domesticities associated with married life, provides him with a rude  awakening as she begins to surpass him in her burgeoning obsession with  experiencing the excitements of sexual liberation. Craig also discovers the  terrifying truth about himself, that, beneath the fa?ade of a meek,  mild-mannered artist there lurks the soul of a repressed despot, as he  comes more and more to relish the ability to move into Malkovich's mind and  control his thoughts and actions - much as with his beloved puppets, but  now on a much more grand, much more malevolent scale. The film generates  much of its comic tension through the complex sexual interplay that  develops among Craig, his wife, Lotte, and his alluring but enigmatic  co-worker, Maxine, in whom both husband and wife develop a more than  passing sexual interest. With tinges of `No Exit,' the three characters  find themselves caught in a frustrating world of overlapping and therefore  clashing sexual desires and passions.<p>The film demonstrates a real stroke  of genius in its casting. John Cusack, with his look of understated  bewilderment, perfectly conveys the soul of a man too long accustomed to  expecting little in the way of surprise out of life. Catherine Keener  brilliantly captures the detached cynicism and taunting coolness that makes  her such an enthralling sexual temptation to both Craig and Lotte. And  whose audacious decision was it to cast Cameron Diaz as the near-dowdy  second fiddle to Kenner, to make her the NON-sex object in the film? As for  Mr. Malkovich himself, he seems to be having the self-deprecating time of  his life as he allows himself and even his lack of general public name  recognition to become targets for gentle ribbing.<p>`Being John Malkovich'  is not a perfect movie. It occasionally sags in places and suffers from  some repetition and, like many utterly original and audacious works, it  sometimes alienates its audience through its quality of often-cold  calculation. At moments in which the iconoclasm seems to become an end in  itself, one may be tempted to see the film in emperor's-new-clothes terms,  wondering if what one is seeing is really as brilliant as it appears or  just an intellectual scam being played on a self-congratulatory elite  audience. For the most part, however, `Being John Malkovich' is fertile  enough in its invention and varied enough in its imaginativeness to rate as  a film well worth seeing and cherishing. There should definitely be more  like it!</p></br><a href="../users/A91LE0MPYE8GJ.html">A91LE0MPYE8GJ</a><br/><p>Well, this was ok, well very weird well, the actors did very well this was good, but alittle weird...</p></br><a href="../users/A3N3SN2DDD4HCJ.html">A3N3SN2DDD4HCJ</a><br/><p>&quot;Being John Malkovich&quot; is some sort of weird movie experience. You look in awe at the ideas the film has and how it executes them. I admired it more than I liked it for it's skillfull blend of dark humor,  originality and sweetness. It's daredevil fun, but it has the potential for  more. Though I enjoyed and do recommend it, I sort of expected more from a  movie about going into someone else's head. A tour of Malkovich's mind  would have been more entertaining than just looking out through his eyes  sockets. Still, it's a fun movie and sometimes thrilling in it's own  special way. &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot; is in a sense, some sort of  achievement. None of it seems barrowed, it all seems fresh and new. All the  actors are great.

I thought, and think, that that movie is brilliant, but I was a little disappointed in "Being John Malkovich" the first time I saw it.  It was very good, yes, but I was hoping for a bit more, since most reviewers seem to think it as good or better than that later film.  Well, yesterday I got through watching "Being John Malkovich" for the third time, about 2 years after I first saw it, and it's grown on me quite a bit.  I still don't think it's quite as good as "Adaptation", but it's pretty close.<br /><br />"Being John Malkovich" is one of those movies that seems to take place in the real world, except that there are a bunch of odd details that aren't right.  Ex: Puppeteering is a major artform; everyone in the world is a total oddball; there's a building with a 7 1/2 floor which contains a portal into John  Malkovich's brain.  This movie is so massively yet still so unobtrusively weird that I'm sure it requires a very specific taste to fully get into it.  You definitely need a taste for the odd.<br /><br />The story centers around Craig Schwartz, (John Cusack) a failed street-puppeteer who lives in depression with his strange but good-natured wife Lotte (Cameron Diaz) and their 100 or so pets.  Lotte suggests that Craig get a job, a real job, and he does so, becoming a filing clerk at a small business on the 7 1/2 floor of a large office building. (The ceiling is all of 4 1/2 feet high, and they have to emergency-stop the elevator to get to the floor.)  Craig is immediately smitten with fellow 7 1/2 floor-dweller Maxine (Catherine Keener).  Maxine is a cruel and cold-hearted individual, but Craig can't help himself and continues to pursue her in spite of her utter contempt for him.  His efforts appear to be going nowhere until one day when he finds a small door hidden behind a filing cabinet.  He crawls in it to discover that this is a portal into John Malkovich's brain, where you watch what Malkovich sees for 15 minutes, after which you are dumped in a ditch by the road  And then things really get weird, as Craig uses this portal as a way to connect with Maxine, but Lotte and others get drawn in and Malkovich finds out what's going on and we learn of the real purpose of the portal and on and on.  I don't want to go on, cause the inexplicable, labyrinthine plot is much of the appeal of the film.  (Though it isn't just crazy for crazy's sake, and actually comes together well.)  Beyond this, Kaufman has tons of clever, intelligent dialogue to support the wacky plot.<br /><br />This movie is damn hard to review, cause it's so strange, and yet much of the appeal and humor is character-driven.  The unbelievable, oddball characters are all interesting, usually funny and often endearing.  Cusack is our main character and sort of the straight man of the film.  Still, he's not quite normal-- He does, after all, want to be a famous puppeteer.  He's a typical "tortured artist" with a scruffy beard and a ponytail, but you can't help but like him.  He's just so hapless, and John Cusack always does the average man thing well.  Orson Bean is great as Dr. Lester, Craig's boss and a 125 year old lech.  (As Craig says, "It's pretty funny once you get past how disgusting it is.)  Catherine Keener is fantastic as Maxine, one of the most black-hearted  characters I've ever seen.  Yeah, she doesn't physically hurt anyway, but her relentless verbal abuse is unbelievable, as she responds to anything Craig says to her with a vicious, personal barb.  Finally, John Malkovich is wonderful as himself (sort of), and he hits a great range of notes and isn't afraid to make himself look bad.  (No one with half a brain would think this really has anything to do with who Malkovich really is, but lotsa people don't have half a brain...)<br /><br />Though "Being John Malkovich" is a comedy, it's a rather thoughtful and ultimately very sad one.  It touches on themes of isolation, the desire to be someone else and the ultimate absurdity and uncontrollability of human life.  This absurdity is encapsulated in the central conflict, in Craig's unrequited love for Maxine; there's no reason why he should love her, she is, as Craig himself says, evil, but he can't help himself;  Man is capable of reason, but emotion rules us and emotion only sporadically makes sense. (And applying reason to emotion never helps, not in my experience, anyway.)<br /><br />Though I can't help but see Kaufman as the primary author of the film, Jonze deserves a ton of credit for bringing the vision to fruition.  Making a film this wacky seem real must be damn near impossible, but Jonze pulls it off with aplomb and spectacular technical proficiency.  The film moves from near conventional scenes to first-person perspective, to dream sequences and flat out surrealism.  Yet, for all the technique displayed in the film, it rarely seems extraneous.  Jonze doesn't seem to be showing off, the flash is all just necessary to navigate the inexplicable plot.  The score is also fantastic, truly beautiful and often-moving, and it allows for a lot of the emotional impact in the film, particularly in the brilliantly conceived and heartbreaking final scene.<br /><br />Man, this review is no good, but you can't do justice to a movie this good and this odd in a review.  You'll just have to watch it.<br /><br />Grade: A</p></br><a href="../users/A1K94LXX833JTT.html">A1K94LXX833JTT</a><br/><p>It would be easy to analyze this film as a puppet show within a puppet show, as a puppeteer ultimately caught in his own strings, and so on, but none of that gets at what is most striking about it.  The film creates a world with its own logic, to which it stays true enough.  The characters act as we would expect them to, once we know who they really are.  What stands out in the film is the masterly, fresh comedy, from hilarious quirks to perfect deadpan send-ups of artistic and other high pretensions.  (And there's some excellent puppet work that the film doesn't invite us to fully appreciate.)  But all of that will be undermined for some by the emotional ambiguity of the film.<br /><br />It begins the way many quirky comedies do, with what appears to be a basically decent person with sensibilities normal enough that we can identify with them, surrounded by other characters who are more cartoonish and off-kilter.  The contrast and tension between the normal and strange heightens the comic effect.  We are drawn in a little, enough to sympathize, but by the end of the film no character has developed into anyone we really care much about, and to the extent we do still care, our sentiments are rewarded with what ought to be chilling results, though they're played more for their dark humor.  No one turns out to have the capacity for any but the most superficial human warmth and love, obsession and casual sex taking their place.  Arguably the adults in the film deserve their fates, or, in the case of Malkovich, deserve only limited sympathy.<br /><br />But what of the fate of the young girl at the end, whose psyche is already violated?  Well, either we can laugh it off and treat the film as a superficial comedy in which such things shouldn't be dwelt on, or we can identify with her as real and feel bad for her, in which frame of mind this becomes a more disturbing film all around than is generally acknowledged.<br /><br />This sour note isn't so much the fatal flaw of this film as it is the clearest indication of it.  The emotional balance of the film is unsettled.  At times we seem to be dealing with people like us, with whom we should identify; at other times we see them as lacking real souls.  This may be regarded as part of the conceit of the film, that the rules of this alternate universe include that humans aren't fully human, or are only ambiguously so (which, of course, can be seen in context of the puppet theme).  That makes the film consistent in its way, but it's an ambiguity that leaves us unable to fully respond to the characters and what happens to them.  Comedy mistreats its characters, but if we're induced to care about them at first, it's more than comedy when they're truly hurt, or when we no longer care if they're hurt.<br /><br />That will bother some people more than others, and, judging from the reviews, most people not at all.  If you like Fargo and Rushmore, you'll probably love this.  Just don't get too attached to the characters or anything else that seems genuine at first if you want to enjoy it as comedy.  And if you want to see it as tragic and disturbing, the overall comic approach may be more bothersome than helpful.</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>The amazing introduction in which we watch two puppets conducted by versatile hands works out into perfection because the best is yet to come.<br /><br />This is one of those few films you love from the first five minutes running time. This a genial cross between Terry Gilliam, Luis Bu&ntilde;uel and Woody Allen. Surreal and irreverent; caustic and astonishing; unexpected and provocative.<br /><br />In the seven and a half floor of a building ( a hidden homage to the desperation and troubles of Marcello in 8 ? perhaps?), the people is obligated to walk like a hunchback and this several deviation leads to unexplored realities. This bizarre office encloses a secret; a portal - an illegal but unexpected device - who lands in the intimate territory of John Malkovich 's mind. During fifteen minutes. Interesting cipher: Do you remember my kind reader about the famous fifteen glory minutes of every human being must live according Andy Warhol?<br /><br />Three different attitudes will turn around that surprising discovery : admiration in first instance and then a clever vehicle to get his unstoppable desire by John Cussack, a gold mine to make easy money by his job partner and the unexpected reaction of his beloved wife who discovers - a Woody Allen typical lure - behind her exaggerated devotion for the animals (their home is almost a zoo) the true sexual vocation.<br /><br />As  you may expect the existential anguish, delirious obsession, greed and the cruel torture that means for Malkovich when he feels invaded his intimacy for outer Peeping Toms will make o you to break the logic links and enjoy and plunge in those weird but not least funny and hyper original script.<br /><br />Two previous movies come to my mind that may be close in this sense: All of me and Zelig, both films deconstruct the ego and rebuild them, but demanding its prize (nothing is free).<br /><br />John Cussack is terrific in his role. He is nowadays, one of the most versatile and talented actors of the American Cinema.

He lets other people try it for $200 and he begins a little something called "J.M.INC". Mr. Malkovich finds out about it and he wants to find out what's going on.

One day, Cusack takes a job as a filer in a bazaar firm that is on only half of a floor, and he discovers a portal into actor, John Malcovich's, brain.  All the while, Cusack has been obsessed with Catherine Keener's character, Maxine, and so has Cusack's wife, Diaz.  Things get confusing for everyone, Diaz thinks she's a transexual after being in Malcovich's head, Maxine is only inlove with Diaz while she is in Malcovich, and Cusack will do anything to win over Maxine including tying up his wife and leaving her in a monkey's cage.  Very weird idea for a film, definately not mainstream, but I really enjoyed it.  It's genius.</p></br><a href="../users/A152C8GYY25HAH.html">A152C8GYY25HAH</a><br/><p>In the annuals of movie comedy history, there has never been anything quite like Being John Malkovich. I hope there never is again, not for negative reasons, but because it should float out there forever like some special little planet. Then, decades from now, people can look back and see a unique sample of where originality was at the end of the Twentieth Century. The following plot information should be enough to say whether or not it belongs in your universe. Obviously, it fits in fine in mine.<p>Craig Schwartz is a gifted and frustrated puppeteer. I think all puppeteers are frustrated, but manual dexterity is not a talent of mine. I don't hold a ball-point pen. I have to clutch it, or else I flip it across the room. Craig lives in New York with his wife Lotte [Cameron Diaz], who runs a pet shop. She has a bad habit of bringing injured or frustrated animals home. The house is a menagerie. We quickly see that both of these people are highly manipulative. When Lotte suggests that Craig find a normal job [just until his puppeteer career takes off, of course], he grudgingly starts looking for one. He spies an ad from The Lester Corp. that seeks a short person who can file quickly. When he arrives at the building listed, he looks at the directory, only to find that Lester is supposedly on floor 7 1/2. Indeed, it really is. The floor is two-thirds the height of a normal one. Propelled by curiosity and a sense of the ridiculous, Craig goes ahead and gets the job.<p>Working at Lester Corp. is a challenge that goes far beyond having to walk around all day stooped over. The Executive Secretary literally does not hear what anyone says to her. She isn't deaf. It's worse than that. Everything said to her is translated into something else. She's straight out of Alice in Wonderland. Dr. Lester [Orson Beane] thinks about nothing else but chasing women. He's 105 years old. And as for coworker Maxine [Catherine Keener], she is nothing short of insane - not homicidal, but simply mad as a hatter. Yet for a puppeteer, who dreams of performing at Lincoln Center, and for his wife, who lives in her own furry critter world, the situation is not that far removed from their own reality. <p>One afternoon Craig accidentally knocks some papers off a file cabinet. He has to move the cabinet to retrieve them and discovers a little door. He opens it and finds a cave-like passage, just big enough for him to crawl into, which, like any sane man, he promptly does. Suddenly, the door slams shut behind him, and a sudden great wind propels him down a long tunnel. He finds himself peering at the world through someone else's eyes. That someone looks in a mirror, and Craig realizes he is inside the real John Malkovich's head. He is fascinated by this phenomenon, but soon enough he goes flying out and crashes onto the side of the New Jersey Turnpike. <p>There is much more to the story, but this is more than enough to tell you if you find it very original or unimaginably stupid. If the story is to your taste, there is more good news. First-time director Spike Jonze, who made a name for himself doing music videos and commercials, is an astounding talent. He has learned a lot in his twenty-nine years. I don't know if he cast the movie, but the choices are shrewd because Cusack, Diaz, Keener and Mary Kay Place all have played in a number of original, off the wall or screwball comedies. Here are a few of the titles: The Player [1992], Grosse Pointe Blank ['97], My Best Friend ['98], There's Something About Mary ['98] and Pecker ['98]. I recommend all of these. These actors are obviously at home in this kind of movie. As a film buff, the icing of the cake is John Malkovich. This is the first film comedy of his long career, but here he is, not only surviving in style in this madhouse, but also playing himself.</p></br><a href="../users/A27PSZX2SE0B51.html">A27PSZX2SE0B51</a><br/><p>I remember first hearing about "Being John Malkovich" more than a year before it was released to theatres.  At that time it was just a title, a concept, and a guarantee that Malk (and Cusack) would be involved.  Stunned at the bravado and imagination, I couldn't wait to buy tickets.  Sadly, sometimes anticipation ruins the result, and I left the theatre disappointed, if not a little bored.<p>Having recently seen the movie again, I found myself enjoying it immensely, buying in to its eclectic concept and execution wholeheartedly, while holding a silly smile on my face the whole time.  This second experience leads me to a conclusion that dovetails nicely with one of the film's major themes: I'm not the same person now as I was then.<p>Director Spike Jonze and screenwriter Charlie Kaufman realize their vision with exuberance and melancholy, which, although paradoxical emotions, make an easy fit together.  Kaufman's script cares not for the rules of the physical world or sane human behaviour.  This apathy allows him to go down roads other screenwriter's have not the talent or the courage to travel.  Jonze, he who cut his teeth on Beastie Boy, Weezer, and Fatboy Slim videos and who's iconoclastic vision reminds one favourably of his musical namesake, achieves Kaufman's vision so sublimely you'd think the two men sprung from the same artistically fertile womb.  They could have made a perfectly banal movie, and only included the marionette sequences, and it still would have been fascinating.  Throw in the 7 1/2-floor orientation video, Dr. Lester and his deaf receptionist, the ingenious celebrity cameos, and the 'Dance of Despair and Disillusionment', and you've got yourself a unique and fascinating vision.  Top it all off with the stunning "What happens when a man goes through his own portal" scene (where the word 'Malkovich' loses all meaning), and I can't think of a way they could have improved this movie.<p>(Re-reading the above paragraph, it's amazing to think that not two hours ago I would have called anyone who'd written such rubbish a frantic imbecile; ah, how quickly the tune can change when the orchestra is given time to practice&#8230;)<p>John Cusack is miles away from Lloyd Dobler country, and yet he still manages to hit the role on the sweet spot.  His Craig is an open wound, festering from lack of love and attention.  Cusack makes him uncomfortable to watch, which is a neat trick because Johnny boy's roles usually go down smoothly.  Like the rest of the actors here, he subverts his own persona (and others'; he's a puppeteer, natch), in a movie about subverting personae.<p>Others themes to watch for (and this is by no means an exhaustive list), include the meaning of the individual and the self, loneliness, obsession, genius, unrequited love, existentialism, capitalism, ethics, morality, celebrity, theology, immortality, passion, art, the tortured artist, vanity, inspiration, and of course, fractional numbers.  It tackles all the big themes, and it tackles them hard.<p>Why is Cameron Diaz in this movie? I asked myself upon first viewing.  Why bring her aboard, and then waste the one reason why you would cast Cameron Diaz, i.e., because she looks like Cameron Diaz!  Putting her in a fright wig, and never letting her near the shower just seemed counterproductive.  Well, on further review, she actually does a fine job in both creating her character and subverting her glamorous Cameron Diaz persona.  She shows longing and frustration, and then ecstasy with ease, and is able to pull off some of the deadpan absurdity that Lotte's dialogue requires.<p>Catherine Keener proves that if you need someone to play a sexy ice queen, then she's your girl.  Ratcheting up a notch her work as a similar character in "Your Friends and Neighbors", Keener is a vital life force, giving energy and vitality to a film peopled with losers and freaks (that's the film's message, not just my opinion).  Whenever she's onscreen, you fear for your life in the audience, for she just might lash out through the screen and slap you where you sit without blinking an eye.  But, she's also able to sincerely play the more emotional moments, without believability and vulnerability.  I love watching this classy lady on film.  More Keener please!<p>Malkovich himself pulls off the film's best acting, especially when he has to portray what happens while Craig is inside his skull.  It's a trick that Cage/Travolta tried to pull off, without success, in "Face/Off".  Here, Malk and Cusack form a superior tandem (having worked together previously in "Con Air"; that's not the jewel thief movie everyone is talking about, is it?).  Malk details Cusack's mannerisms with spot-on accuracy.  But there are other moments where Malk mocks himself, his celebrity, and his supposed lifestyle.  Scenes showing him earnestly rehearsing "The Cherry Orchard" and "Richard III", greeting obtuse fans who praise him for his sensitivity in playing "retards", or passionately ordering bathroom towels from a mail order catalog not only subvert his persona, but deconstruct it, and then deconstruct it again.  This movie wouldn't have worked if Malkovich had no sense of humour about himself (His advice to Spike Jonze upon taking the role: 'The crueler the better'; "Being Tom Cruise", while probably a bigger ticket, wouldn't have packed the same punch).  Kudos to him for getting, and running with, the joke.<p>[The DVD is loaded with quirky video pieces, such as the entire orientation video and Malkovich-as-puppeteer documentary, both featured in the movie; plus, it has an odd behind the scenes look at one of the extras driving along the Jersey Turnpike, and a mock interview with Spike Jonze that's a dirty gag in more ways than one]</p></br><a href="../users/A39IY0JU5JI69G.html">A39IY0JU5JI69G</a><br/><p>YES!  This film is unusual--it breaks out of conventional time and space reality--maybe that's its main gift.  The idea is terrific---what it's like to spend 15 minutes being someone else---in this case a famous and succesful movie actor.  The choice of actor fits in with the general motif---John Malkovich---who is, I think most people would agree--a little off-center, himself.  They didn't chose Tom Cruise (now that would be interesting) or Robert Redford or Brad Pitt....but John Malkovich..??!<br /><br /> It could have developed into something really illuminating.  (like The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind)  But it dropped the ball somewhere and ended up being just a mess. The idea of the old people needing Malkovich's body was grotesque...and then the idea of using the child's body was even worse.  (shades of Rosemary's Baby)<br /><br />It's essentially a heartless movie...no one really cares about anyone besides himself, with the possible exception of the Cameron Diaz character who, at least, cares about her animals.  The John Cuzak character, our "hero" is likable at first, as the hapless puppeteer, but he doesn't lose a moment to go after the snazzy new lady at work (Catherine Keener).  No one grew, no one learned anything, and, at the end I really didn't care about any of them, least of all, John Malkovich.<br /><br />If you're really impressed by the fact that this is unconventional, and a lot of reviewers here are....then you may love this.  Love?  A funny word for such a loveless story.<br /><br />My DVD gave me the treat of an interview with Spike Jonze, who pulls over the car to vomit.  I guess this is supposed to be really really funny...<br /><br />The reason I gave it any stars at all was for the originality of the concept, and the excellent cast.  It was great to see Mary Kay Place again (and Orson Bean!!)  Cameron Diaz was very good and Catherine Keener was terrific.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TEMNM9ZEOLJ6.html">A1TEMNM9ZEOLJ6</a><br/><p>At a time when many movies are utter crap, this one stood out for its originality. A hapless puppeteer discovers a 'portal' into the brain of John Malkovich and this device becomes the pivot for weird takes on couplehood, not to mention celebrity.<br />This is a small movie. No one gets shot. No blood. No car crashes. No nudity. In other words, it's a miracle this thing was sort of a minor hit. Great rental movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A82LIVYSX6WZ9.html">A82LIVYSX6WZ9</a><br/><p>I want to be John Malkovich and this movie is killer fun. Spike Jonze is the man and by far a great up and coming director/actor(he was in Three Kings with George Clooney and later in 2002 he made Adaptation with Nicolas Cage). Cusack is great as Schwartz, the man who finds out theres a door leading into Malkovich's brain. Diaz is crazy as Cusack's pet obsessed wife who wants Malkovich's body to have sex with Catherine Keener's charcter. There's a lot of great moments including when John Malkovich goes inside his owen brain. loved it a lot</p></br><a href="../users/A2KB14WCZ1DVE3.html">A2KB14WCZ1DVE3</a><br/><p>You have to wonder how this one got by an industry that seems to release movies based on marketing surveys and the whatever the current political climate is.  For this is a movie unlike any other.  It takes big chances, and hits a home run, which gets it the five stars. <p>How to describe this movie without giving away too much plot is tough here.  Take a look at the box, and see the larger picture.  You see a big head with a door leading into it. First, guess who's head it is.  Next, notice that there are three people inside of it.  That should give you enough clues to pique your interest, without giving away too many details.  <p>But &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot; is not the only weird thing going on here.  John Cusack plays an unemployed puppeteer (yes, he plays with puppets) who is more or less pushed into an office job by his roommate Cameron Diaz in order to contribute just a wee bit to the finances of the relationship.  Once again I'll try not to give away too much, but a day's work here involves using an elevator in a very special way, walking funny all day, and being prepared to have your co-workers seen to not here a word you say are all part of it.  <p>It is in this environment that the title action takes place.  Then, believe it or not, it gets weirder.  We see the adventures of the three that take on the title action, in different combinations.  We then get a special treat at the title character also takes place, and how it's handled is very creative.  <p>Strangely enough, everything is explained, believe it or not very clearly, although just as wierd.  The last scenes are a bit confusing, but are open to a lot of creative interpretation.  Which is only fitting, as this is one very creative, very strange, very entertaining movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A36EW68H08UOCS.html">A36EW68H08UOCS</a><br/><p>Charlie Kaufman has the distinction of writing the two most deranged screenplays I know of with "Adaptation" and it's predecessor, "Being John Malkovich". Here it became clear that a mind of unsurpassed creativeness had been loosed among the movie-making crowd.<br /><br />Four fantastic performances are given by John Cusack, Cameron Diaz, Catherine Keener and Malkovich himself, and they are guided by Spike Jonze' direction and Mr. Kaufman's screenplay.<br /><br />Cusack is a gifted, tortured, starving artist, and not just any artist, but a puppeteer - working with marionettes.  The film opens with a marionette performance so poignant it seems nearly human - the performance reminds me of the opening of "White Nights" in which Baryshnikov dances "Le Jeune Homme Et La Mort".  In White Nights it takes a moment before you recognize that you are watching a performance of a ballet, and in this film the marionette is so life-like it doesn't require much suspension of disbelief to think the puppet alive.  In another similarity between the two films later on a human-sized marionette is made to "dance" the lead role in "Swan Lake" surrounded by human ballerinas.  The rest of this film is SO startlingly original that it's easy to overlook the fact that the movie has some REALLY skilled puppeteering in it.<br /><br />But I digress.  Puppeteering doesn't pay Cusack well, so there are money arguments between John and wife Cameron Diaz, who looks like a cross between a street person and a washer-woman here.  She works in a pet store and keeps a collection of animals including a dog, ferret, bird and chimpanzee - all apparently with some form of veterinary post-traumatic stress disorder.  Diaz' Lotte is the kind of person who forms close emotional ties with animals but has more difficulty being intimate with other humans.<br /><br />Desperate for a paying job, Cusack thinks his nimble puppeteering fingers make him ideal for a company that specializes in filing, so he gets a job in an old New York building on the 7 1/2th floor - the kind of quirky little thing added in just for "flavor" in this film.<br /><br />At his new job Cusack discovers Maxine - an attractive but sarcastic New York woman who has had it with most men, and Cusack's Craig Schwartz certainly seems like most men to her.<br /><br />Craig also discovers something he wasn't expecting behind a filing cabinet: a portal that leads to 15 minutes inside the head of John Malkovich before dumping you on the side of a New Jersey highway.<br /><br />If it seems like I've given away the whole story - I haven't.  These are all plot setups that lead to the development of a narrative that doesn't just have a "twist".  THIS story "twists" every five minutes.<br /><br />On my second viewing of the movie my greatest regard is for John Malkovich himself, who not only allows himself to be spoofed, but participates in the spoofing with great gusto.  On the first trip "into Malkovich" we track him as he's getting ready to go out.  He goes down to the street where a cab is hailed for him.  The driver looks back and instantly recognizes him.<br /><br />"Hey.... you're that actor, aren't you?"<br />"Yes", Malkovich replies.<br />"I loved you in that movie where you played the jewel thief".<br />"I never played a jewel thief". (Although a few years later John Malkovich actually does play a jewel thief in Johnny English.)<br /><br />A few other times other characters bring up his performance in the jewel thief movie - a great running gag demonstrating how easy human nature makes it to spread urban legends and other incorrect information.<br /><br />John Malkovich has been in a large number of my very favorite films: The Killing Fields, Dangerous Liaisons, Places in the Heart, Shadow of the Vampire, In the Line of Fire and Of Mice and Men. (Fans of "Sex and the City" will enjoy the moment when Willie Garson walks by Malkovich in a restaurant and compliments him on his performance in the movie where he played "that retard".) Now one of my favorite John Malkovich movies is the one that bears his name.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HII4U9WQ0XUV.html">A2HII4U9WQ0XUV</a><br/><p>Stop laughing and step back a minute---"Being John Malkovich" isn't funny, it's a horror movie. Alright---it's funny, *and* it's a horror movie.<br /><br />Somewhere, somehow, sometime, someplace (possibly Providence, Rhode Island) Edgar Allan Poe and H.P. Lovecraft got together. Genes were spliced. The warped and twisted biological result was Spike Jonze, one of modern cinema's most insidious, surreptious, diabolically gifted and wickedly talented filmmakers and the most Terrible of the Enfants Terribles stalking the American academy of Arts and Letters today.<br /><br />Having helmed the infamous Beastie Boys "Sabotage" video, Jonze and partner-in-crime Charlie Kaufman were ready to cobble together a Trojan Horse and aim it at the dark heart of Fortress Hollywood.<br /><br />They succeeded massively with the darkly subversive "Being John Malkovich", the story of a disaffected puppeteer (played by John Cusack) who discovers a secret aperture into the mind of actor John Malkovich.<br /><br />Some wrong-headedly think this is a surreal comedy. Poor, naive, childish innocents, I say! I'm here to contend that for all its comedic trappings, "Being John Malkovich" is a horror movie that H.P. Lovecraft himself would appreciate.<br /><br />Yes, I know, the title itself is risible, the notion of a portal into John Malkovich's consciousness makes one giddy, and you can't possibly have a proper cosmos-ripping horror movie with Cameron Diaz, John Cusack, John Malkovich, and Charlie Sheen. I know all the standard objections.<br /><br />But first: if you haven't seen "Being John Malkovich", stop reading this silly review and go buy the thing. You'll be utterly delighted and glad you listened to my advice.<br /><br />Alright, for those of you who have seen this wicked little gem of sheer cinematic subversion---listen up: "Being John Malkovich" is a horror movie, not a comedy, a long-toothed snarling wolf dolled up in comedic sheep's clothing. Think not? Fine: let's leave the idea of John Malkovich having his body snatched out of it. If the idea of a blameless, innocent, blithe little girl being invaded by a small platoon of slobbering geriatrics isn't horror, then nothing is horrible.<br /><br />Still skeptical? That's fine, but be warned: everything in in Jonze and Kaufman's little tour de force here is expertly stage-managed and distilled to a single purpose, and that is fooling the innocent, naive viewer to the movie's singularly malign purpose: body-snatching is front and center here. If you think this is a comedy, dear friend, then you're being duped with fine food and good wine, just the tools the wicked immortal Dr. Lester (a fine turn by the great Orson Bean, with nods to Lovecraft's "Terrible Old Man") used, as the evil Captain Merten had used before him.<br /><br />Think about it this way: what happened to Malkovich once Craig and Maxine's little entrepreneurial scheme took on a life of its own? Still feel like a good horse laugh? I'm thinking a stiff Scotch is more in order.<br /><br />The direction and cinematography here are spot on, and every scene tells. The acting is also superb, from Cusack's dangerously desperate puppeteer, to veteran actors Bean and the late Byrne Piven (Captain Merten, who pities dwarves), to Catherine Keener, who plays the wicked, devious, Machiavellian shrew Maxine. I despised her every second she was on screen---good job, Miss Keener!<br /><br />The real plaudits go to Cameron Diaz. I had never really considered Diaz an actress of substance, but her wildly schizophrenic romp as the crazed animal-lover Lotte showed the woman has some finely honed acting chops. Charlie Sheen sinks his fangs into his tiny but tasty role, and Malkovich purrs through the movie like a kitten.<br /><br />Surreal, quirky, brilliantly paced, constantly resourceful, occasionally creepy, with a haunting, pining score by Carter Burwell and Bjork that calls to mind Philip Glass's composition for "Mishimia", "Being John Malkovich" is a clever, wicked, blackly funny work of genius, but it is very much a horror film. Having returned from a jaunt through his own tortured subconscious, Malkovich roars "I have seen things no man should have to see." Truer words couldn't have frothed from the lips of one of Lovecraft's tentacle-tormented heroes.<br /><br />Still not convinced? Look at "Malkovich's" ample horror trappings: a skewed, twisted crawlspace of an office, forcing its denizens to walk in a crouch and situated between the floors of the building; a Terrible Old Man, confounded by an illusory speech impediment, who has chronicled the life of his unwitting host in a back-room; Dwarf Love;---and of course, bodysnatching.<br /><br />To say nothing of this prospect: imagine the sensation of a horde of hungry, greedy, ancient eyes crawling across your body, a mulifaceted invasion force perched just behind the two innocuous irises of your dinner-mate.<br /><br />Does that give you the giggles? It gives me the crawls.<br /><br />Still laughing?<br /><br />JSG</p></br><a href="../users/AHL35XZ3OND2Z.html">AHL35XZ3OND2Z</a><br/><p>1999 was a really great year for movies and I didn't get to see all the ones I wanted in the theater.  So when this one came out on DVD I bought it from trust in the reviews that it was something great.  Unfortunately there  wasn't much to be seen.  I was completely annoyed with John Cusack's  preformance and I was never taken in by any of the story's quirkiness.  Some genuinely funny moments aside, I am at a loss of words to explain why  this movie was not only on ten best lists, but at the top of them as well.  I agree with another reviewer here with the phrase &quot;different doesn't  mean brilliant&quot;.  Too often these days leading critics are confusing  those two words. While very different, BEING JOHN MALKOVICH was far from  brilliant.</p></br><a href="../users/A345WVAVMMO6F0.html">A345WVAVMMO6F0</a><br/><p>im not sure why i gave this a second star; maybe its because i feel guilty for always loathing everything john malkovich is associated with? directed and written by spike jonze and charlie kaufman (the same duo who gave us the equally pretentious "adaptation"), this one centers around an unsuccessful puppeteer (john cusack) who figures out how to enter into the body of actor john malkovich for 15 minutes at a time and manages to turn that talent into riches and fame but oh my he still isnt happy even tho he gets to hang out with cameron diaz.</p></br><a href="../users/A3SS6VRWCTB7V.html">A3SS6VRWCTB7V</a><br/><p>Love this film. Great story captured well on film. Acting is good, dialogue crisp and often funny. Highly recommend for any adult viewer.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>The film is deeply funny because of the grossness of the concrete realization of the argument of the plot. It is muddy, dirty, crawling in a corridor, perverting in the most grotesque way Alice in Wonderland looking through the looking glass and sharing an apartment with an ill-mouthed parrot and a chimpanzee. The hole in the hedge is a rat hole in the wall and the only attractive thing in it is the glass doorknob. Then the plot is absolutely funny. It is based on one person being able to crawl inside another person and impose his or her personality onto that other person. That's strange but very fast it becomes ah ah because of the identity of the person inside and the identity of the person with whom the inhabited one is having relationships, discussions, rapports, even intercourse of course. In a way it is perverted since a woman can live her love for another woman by accepting her to be in the man that is the vessel of that intruder or invader. If the man is invaded by a woman and has a personal relationship with another woman, the two women are making love, to the point of procreating a girl, their daughter. That's definitely ah ah. Then the film deals with phantasms in the heads of Western men and women. Everyone wants to be able to make their desires and emotions towards anyone whatsoever real. But after all you have to keep some appearances, as a British TV series about a certain Mrs Bouquet used to say, and that's how the inhabited human vessel can enable so many possible connections to take place. Then it shows that success in our society does not depend on the value you have but on the value the public persona you are living in has. If you live in the body of a great person anything you will do will be successful and seen at once as great. Finally, and that's the punch scene at the end of the film, this possibility to transit from one person to another will enable some old people to get into younger bodies and live forever. The very fundamental myth of the Western world, but a myth they have never dared to realize in a religious belief or philosophical theory. The Buddhist did it but not the Christians, nor the Moslems, nor the Jews, the three Semitic religions. So Hollywood is playing the role of the provider of eternity to the few who will believe it because they have always dreamed of it. Blessed be the gullible, ... So all in all a funny film that makes you feel at times kind of ill at ease.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines</p></br><a href="../users/A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX.html">A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX</a><br/><p>I just had a few miscellaneous comments on this very unusual film. I'm usually easily entertained when it comes to movies, because I don't usually expect very much of them (at least the stuff that normally comes out of Hollywood as compared to various independent directors). It's rare that I really rave about a film, but I have to admit I was impressed with how original and unusual this film was. A lot of films are pretty predictable, but this one isn't, and the film had me wondering what kind of wacky and funny hijinx or scene would come up next. But they did just that for the next two hours. The film also playfully explores some pretty profound questions relating to identity, consciousness, the afterlife, and so on. And on top of that there's a kinky scene or two that are pretty over the top just by themselves.<br /><br />Given all the above, I would have to count this as one of the more intelligent, unusual, and funny movies to come out in recent memory. I was a little surprised it had even been produced and come out of Hollywood rather than by an independent director, but shortly after I'd seen the film I heard a brief interview on PBS with the scriptwriter and he said the same thing, that he was surprised when the script was picked up and the studio actually decided to make the film.<br /><br />Also, it's great to see Orson Bean is still working, and actually, I thought he looked pretty good for his age in the movie. I remember from the old days when he appeared on the Johnny Carson show and he called himself a "humorist" rather than a comedian. Well, I'm not sure really what the difference is between humor and comedy, but this movie certainly has them both in spades and it was very obvious he had a lot of fun making the movie too.<br /><br />I very rarely rent movies that I've seen in the theater and see them twice, but I plan on renting this one and watching it again soon, since I haven't seen it since it first came out five years ago. Overall, a very unusual, outrageous, and entertaining film that I suspect will become a cult classic.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FG91CM8221X1.html">A1FG91CM8221X1</a><br/><p>Being John Malkovich casts a spell of enchantment over its viewers by creating its own wacky world, with its completely strange characters and out-of-kilter rules, and then remaining absolutely true to that world. You  get a big, wonderful surprise every five minutes; the &quot;Malkovich  Malkovich Malkovich&quot; scene alone is worth the price of a rental! John  Malkovich himself was robbed when he didn't get a Best Actor or Supporting  Actor nomination, but considering the sheer glorious weirdness of this  movie, I must bow to the Academy for breaking its usual bonds and actually  giving this film nominations for Best Director, Screenplay and Supporting  Actress. If you're adventurous at all in your moviegoing tastes, this movie  is for you.</p></br><a href="../users/A319SKSB556033.html">A319SKSB556033</a><br/><p>...but certainly not great. For a film that is as much arthouse as it is mainstream it makes no point at all whatsoever and it comes nowhere near taking advantage of it's wondeerful premise. All we get is a shaggy John  Cusack and a bushy Cameron Diaz going head to head over Catherine Keener  through John Malkovich. It does has the occasional weird charm but I feel  like it could have been so much more. Only a few scenes raised a smile in  me. <p>Don't get me wrong. I've never seen a movie that had so much  originality to it but I have also never seen a movie that did so little  with its ingenius idea. It becomes quite boring and saggy in places.  Whenever this happened I just wanted it to go to another scene where they  go inside John Malkovich.<p>Also...the ending makes no sense whatsoever.  And the writer doesn't even give an explanation for the portal or how it is  possible. This may have worked for Groundhog Day but just seems lazy here.  As you may have guessed the ending annoyed me very much. <p>I do reccomend  you buy this DVD but it should go in your Obscure/Hit-Miss section. The  film doesn't have much of anything to classify it as belonging to a certain  genre.<p>The DVD is in Dolby 5.1 and is anamorphically enhanced at 1.85:1.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>I don't think I've ever seen a film get so MPD a reaction from those in the theater. Not that some loved it and some hated it... but the same person would come out with both reactions in the space of a sentence. That's phenomenal power, people. That's what filmmaking at its best is all  about-- the ability to elucidate and confuse at the same time. And the best  part, the true knock on Hollywood? That an indie film company stocked  with rock and roll stars made this sucker on a shoestring with the kinds of  starpower normally reserved for Hollywood's biggest nine-figure  blockbusters and it's still been one of the nation's top ten films every  week since the listening public discovered it. I know people who've seen  this as many times as they've seen Rocky Horror. I figured it was time.  (And I had free passes and couldn't use them to see Toy Story 2.)  <p><p>It's hard to say word one about this movie without giving away major  pleasant surprises. Everyone knows, of course, that Malkovich plays himself  (and hams it up tremedously), and most people are aware that the male lead  is John Cusack. The rest of the film's cast is a mystery, I think. It was  to me, anyway. And when they popped the name of the female lead up on the  screen, not only had I not recognized her throughout the movie, but I tried  to figure out who she played... and I got it wrong. Wow. Suffice to say the  casting is stellar, you know almost everyone, and they had to have worked  for scale. And they're all brilliant. <p><p>One extra little sidelight--  the puppeteering in this movie is tremendous. If you go in for avant-garde  productions and all that sort of stuff, the incredible complexity of the  marionette shows at various times during this film will astound you. The  puppeteer's name was flashed at the end, but I missed it. Remember this  guy, if and when you see this movie, 'cause if anyone ever makes it big in  marionettes, it'll be him. <p><p>The plot is, um, simple-- an out-of-work  puppeteer (Cusack) gets a job as a filing clerk, falls in love with a  co-worker (he's married and they're on the verge of on-the-rocks) who snubs  him repeatedly, and discovers in his office a door that opens into a portal  which allows the person entering it to get inside the head of John  Malkovich (portrayed by himself) for fifteen minutes. After being voided  from Malkovich, one is unceremoniously dumped into a ditch on the New  Jersey Turnpike-- a beautiful metaphor if I've ever seen one. The plot  can't get any more twisted? Hold your tongue! Of course, I can't _tell_ you  more about it without giving it away... you just gotta go. <p><p>The film  was produced by R. E. M. vocalist Michael Stipe and is the full-length  directorial debut of music video guru Spike Jonze, perhaps best known for  his longtime association with the Beastie Boys. Whatever you may think of  their music, you have to admit, their videos are always something new and  unexpected. As is this film. It's twisted, it's mean, it's ugly, at times  it's funny as hell. It's two hours of sheer, utter, complete enjoyment...  but you walk out feeling guilty for having enjoyed it as much as you did.  Go. See it now. Laugh. Everyone else will feel more guilty about it than  you will.</p></br><a href="../users/AD0J5KK4WQXNS.html">AD0J5KK4WQXNS</a><br/><p>Not good at all<p>I was expecting "Being John Malkovich" to be a sort of trippy ride like "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"  but I must say that I much prefer the later in terms of screen madness and insanity. BJM does stall a lot of the time and there are many dull moments in-between the bouts of lunacy. I certainly prefer the director's latest work "Adaptation" to this vehicle.<p>This film revolves around a puppeteer who manages to find a portal through a door in an office into John Malkovich's head. What a great premise! This boasts of originality through and through. Sounds just like what we need. I was really looking forward to this one. I like little cult items that do things differently.<p>However this is really a very mixed bag. You can tell that a lot of people in this movie are here to help out a friend. Some actors take their role a way more seriously than others. There is a lot of diversity in the quality there. I guess the reason why people went to see this film was to see Hollywood go wacky. It does just that, but is a tad bit embarrassingly executed as if you are watching the actors pour out their hearts on the Jerry Springer show. That is certainly not my kettle of fish. Maybe you will like this and I am sure that there are many people who simply adore this film but that was strike one for me. I do not like that sort of thing because it makes me feel uncomfortable to be honest and I found it hard to enjoy anything after that. I have read other reviewers here who did not like the film because of this either.<p>Strike two for me was the fact that the film's premise is limited to this "nutty" concept. It does not go outside of it much and when it does it can get extremely boring. The relationships in this movie are not fleshed out. When the divergence in acting quality meets up outside of its core theme the movie does falter into the realm of amateur film making. This can be forgiven for the director's newness but it is, frankly, boring.<p>The third Strike came in the form of a dud presentation. This is just NOT THAT WACKY. It does not get much crazy outside of the theme of going into Malkovich's head. A lot of it is simply executed in some way or another to look strange, but it just LOOKS strange and is not that cerebral at all. I expected this film to mess with your mind a bit more but it does not really do that. It just looks wacky but does not execute much intelligence along the way. Ultimately this is a bore.<p>However I will give it Charlie Sheen who saves this movie from one star purgatory. This vehicle is worth seeing for his performance alone. Overall this is "designer mainstream Hollywood wackiness" that can play to all audiences but is certainly devoid of making that extra leap of the consciousness that it pretends to expound on. This is no 2001 or Jacobs Ladder or Lost Highway. This is more akin to a dark version of a Police Squad movie. Not my idea of a wacky film, but a lot of people might like it and this review should not put you off trying it. I just did not like it at all and felt letdown by it all. It certainly does not live up to the hype for me for the reasons I have stated above. IMO, watch &quot;Adaptation&quot; instead.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />Praised by critics, who (rightfully, to a degree) salute anything different--and boy is this movie different--Being John Malkovich is largely different for its own sake, eschewing any factors that would make the movie likable in favor of being off the wall.</p></br><a href="../users/A38QJ7JUUTVLKX.html">A38QJ7JUUTVLKX</a><br/><p>It was good for the first 30 minutes, but the rest was just stupid. I've never seen a movie take a nose dive like that. I mean once that girl says she wants to have a sex change it is down hill. While too many movies suffer the fate of creative bankruptcy, Being John Malkovich is a refreshing study in contrast, so bracingly original that you'll want to send director Spike Jonze and screenwriter Charlie Kaufman a thank-you note for restoring your faith in the enchantment of film. Even if it ultimately serves little purpose beyond the thrill of comedic invention, this demented romance is gloriously entertaining, spilling over with ideas that tickle the brain and even touch the heart. This had an interesting concept that could of worked, but it looks like there were to different writers. One wanted to right a comedy, and the other wanted to write an episode for tales from the crypt, then both ideas were smashed together and were totally ruined. This is the only John Cusack film I didn't like. Anyway, puppeteer's working as a file clerk on the seventh-and-a-half floor of a Manhattan office building; this idea alone might serve as the comedic basis for an entire film, but Jonze and Kaufman are just getting started. They then totally turn the whole thing around into some and stupid film full of mindless sex scenes and then it finally ceases to be funny and just becomes stupid, so I recommend seeing something else like Say Anything or Better Off Dead, those are actually funny through out the duration of the film!</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>Charlie Kaufman may be the greatest screenwriter of our generation.  He's written three of the greatest screenplays in recent memory (`Being John Malkovich', `Adaptation' and `Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind') and those are just the three I've seen (to be honest, I was not entirely impressed with `Confessions of a Dangerous Mind' and I never saw `Human Nature').  He has a knack for creating scenarios that are entirely improbable yet tap into the very soul of a human.  His films are not merely comedic entertainment but are important and philosophical in their relation to human nature and innate desire.<br /><br />`Being John Malkovich' is not your typical comedy.<br /><br />The film tells the story of puppeteer Craig Schwartz who is growing tired of not having an audience for his work.  After he is persuaded by his wife to get a job he finds that his new working environment is opening portals (quite literally) to an entirely new existence.  Hidden away in his very workroom is a portal into the mind of John Malkovich, the actor.  Yes, by crawling through a long cramped tunnel one can be John Malkovich for fifteen minutes before being spit out over the Jersey turnpike.  Craig, having fallen for his intriguing coworker Maxine, devises a plan with her to charge admission into the mind of Malkovich, but entering that portal changes their lives in many other ways.<br /><br />There are so many ways to interpret this movie that I feel as if touching upon them all would be too difficult a task at this point.  I will admit that watching this film, and even more so just contemplating its meanings afterward, changed me in a way.<br /><br />To be completely honest, I woke up wanting to be John Malkovich.<br /><br />The film exposes some very human truths, in regards to the desire to be someone we're not and the desire to see ourselves through someone else's eyes.  It also, in a somewhat humorous way, exposes the worthlessness of celebrity in itself, the almost faux notion that making a name for ones self really makes a difference.  First we have Craig who just wants to practice his work, but he hasn't the name to do so.  In Malkovich he finds a way to expound upon his love of puppeteering.  Then you have his wife Lotte who is unsatisfied with her existence in finds in Malkovich something that feels right.  Then you have Maxine who desires to be desired, and while she is desired by many she is not desired for the right reasons, until she stares into Malkovich's eyes and sees Lotte starring back at her.<br /><br />And then we have Malkovich.  What I thought was so great about the script was that it in a humorous and sub-plotted kind of way approached that fact that celebrity is not as glamorous as one expects.  Malkovich is regarded as a respected and loved actor yet no one that talks to him really knows what movies he has made or what roles have made him so `respected'.<br /><br />"Who's John Malkovich?"<br /><br />The films brilliant prose is bolstered by the fantastic, and I mean FANTASTIC, performances by the entire cast.  John Cusack is awkward, goofy and tired, which masterfully captures his characters unhappiness with his lot in life.  Cameron Diaz is brilliantly sporadic with her actions and feelings, adding layers to her characters inborn struggle to be herself.  Catherine Keener is flawless as Maxine.  She demands our attention with her marvelous manipulation of our emotions.  We want her to get what she wants even if it destroys us.  This movie though, is called `Being John Malkovich', and honestly, it is John Malkovich himself that drives it all home.  His brilliant portrayal of himself is utterly flawless.  I have liked him in the past and found him stale in the past, but this performance is astonishing in every sense of the word; especially as it draws to a climax and he starts to unravel.<br /><br />`Being John Malkovich' is funny, sure, but like Kaufman's other work, `Being John Malkovich' is so much more than a typical comedy.  It answers questions (or at least asks very many) about life, human interaction and the very root of who we are and who we want to be.<br /><br />Have you ever wanted to be someone else?  Of course you have.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PBV1899CX3TE.html">A2PBV1899CX3TE</a><br/><p>[first lines]<br />Lotte Schwartz: Craig, honey, it's time for bed.<br />[fade out and in]<br />Orrin Hatch the bird: Craig, honey, time to get up, Craig, honey, time to get up, Craig, honey, time to get up, Craig, honey, time to get up,<br />Craig Schwartz: Lotte...<br />Lotte Schwartz: I'm sorry.

But seriously, that'll all be covered in the orientation.<br /><br />The play that Craig was performing with his puppets (when he gets smacked by an angry parent) is based on the letters of Abelard and Heloise, written between 1115 and 1117 AD, which were found, copied and abridged by Johannes de Vepria, a 15th century Cistercian monk, into "Ex Epistolis duorum amantium" ("From the Letters of Two Lovers"). This became a classic document of early romantic (tragic) love used by many artists in their work including William Shakespeare in Romeo and Juliet. In addition, screenwriter Charlie Kaufman's later project Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004) took its title, and no small amount of inspiration, from Alexander Pope's "Eloisa to Abelard."<br /><br />Dr. Lester: I've been very lonely in my isolated tower of indecipherable speech.<br /><br />The 1990 Steppenwolf Theatre building in Chicago (Malkovich was one of the first members of Steppenwolf, and remains one today) includes a half-floor used for storage.<br /><br />The original script has Kevin Bacon in place of 'Charlie Sheen' , as Malkovich's actor friend.<br /><br />John Malkovich: Ma-Sheen!<br />Charlie Sheen: Malcatraz!<br /><br />The play that John Malkovich is rehearsing on stage is Shakespeare's "Richard III." The lines "Was ever a woman in this humour woo'd? / Was ever a woman in this humour won?" are I.ii.239-240, where Richard is gloating over his use of power, lies and crime to obtain the woman he desires, Lady Anne.

Those viewers who have been conditioned to accept only standard narrative fare will find their minds joyfully liberated upon seeing this film.  Sometimes experimentation in cinema does indeed work.  <p>Craig Schwartz (John Cusack) is a puppeteer who creates unappealing puppets that turn off the public.  His career as a puppeteer is going nowhere so he seeks other employment and soon finds himself working in an office building that has a floor lodged between the seventh and eight floors.  Craig then becomes smitten with co-worker Maxine (Catherine Keener), but even more attention-grabbing is a doorway he finds behind a file cabinet that leads into the brain of John Malkovich (John Malkovich playing himself).  Craig uses the doorway for his own selfish pursuits but eventually his wife, Lotte (Cameron Diaz), Maxine, and Malkovich himself learn of his exploits.  A metaphysical battle like you have never seen before then ensues in which the fate of John Malkovich's sanity hangs in the balance.  <p>"Being John Malkovich" defies description.  This is a film that people just have to see for themselves.  A second-hand account of it will not do justice to its eccentric and creative nature.  Simply put, "Being John Malkovich" could easily have become a freak-film if it was made by a less-able director, but Jonze manages to keep the entire production afloat from start to finish.  Credit must also be given to Cusack, Diaz, Keener, and Malkovich who are all great in their roles.  Each of them ably captures the peculiar tone that the premise of the film demands of them.  Malkovich is particularly hilarious in a sequence where he discusses his new career as a puppeteer.  Now, it must be said that "Being John Malkovich" is not for everyone.  One must have a somewhat skewed outlook on the world to appreciate the ideas put forth in this film.  If you're willing to check all rational thought at the door and keep an open mind then you will be rewarded with a fascinating and unique viewing experience.  One thing is for sure - after watching "Being John Malkovich," you'll never look at a small door behind a file cabinet the same way again.</p></br><a href="../users/ABN5K7K1TM1QA.html">ABN5K7K1TM1QA</a><br/><p>This is a strikingly original film that is part science fiction, part love triangle romance, and part comedy with an undercurrent of psychological insight into human relationships, marred slightly by some familiar elements in the resolution.  Charlie Kaufman, who wrote the script, and Spike Jonze who directed, are to be commended for being so daring and free with the usual notions of reality while callously demonstrating just how selfish human relationships can be.  To analyze this film is very much beside the point, but I'm going to do a little bit of that anyway.<p>John Cusack stars as an out of work puppeteer with a cheating heart.  Cameron Diaz is his hard-working mousey little wife who supports him and a menagerie of animals including a chimpanzee ensconced in their New York apartment.  An early scene shows her going off to work while Cusack rolls over and goes back to sleep.  Catherine Keener enters the scene with her big smile and long legs as a supremely confident amoral user of people and quickly becomes the focus of the triangle as both Cusack and Diaz fall in madly in love with her.  She, however, is not so enamored.  She is not attracted to Cusack at all and tells him so, and finds Diaz interesting but only after seeing her adoring eyes inside the eyes of John Malkovich, who plays himself.<p>Offbeat enough?  Not yet.  Cusack has met Keener through his new job as a fast-fingered file clerk at a data storage firm with offices on the seventh and a half floor in a New York high rise.  The floor is just about four and a half feet high (low overhead!) so that everybody has to bend over whenever they stand up.  Orson Bean plays the head of the firm who is 110 years old or so with Mary Kay Place as his annoying secretary.  While filing Cusack drops a folder behind a filing cabinet.  He pulls out the cabinet and lo and behold discovers a little Alice in Wonderland door.  He opens it and crawls forward in the dark and swoosh! is drawn into the person of actor John Malkovich, who is going about his daily life.  Cusack looks out and sees what John is seeing, hears what John is hearing, experiences what John is experiencing.  He is BEING John Malkovich!<p>Okay, we have our strikingly original premise.  Where the film goes from here is the tough part.  It includes some funny shtick and some intriguing ideas about identity, a prospect for immortality, Malkovich being turned into a puppet, some unusual sex games, a couple of appearances by Charlie Sheen as his contemporary self and later as a balding middle aged man, ending with the resolution of the triangle and a hint of a possible sequel.  I was entertained mainly because of the strong performances by Keener, Cusack, Malkovich and Diaz.  I was somewhat disappointed that the last part of the film did not live up to the beginning in terms of originality.  The old people waiting for rebirth reminded me of something out of Cocoons (1985).  But Cusack's prospective life as a little girl was a chuckle to contemplate, and I couldn't help but applaud Keener's sly triumph.  But enough of these beguiling hints about what happens.  See it for yourself.</p></br><a href="../users/AR37967IAR6ZT.html">AR37967IAR6ZT</a><br/><p>This movie, as you've read, is off-the-wall, yet it manages to ask key questions about the nature of identity. It's funny, constantly manic yet always interesting. <p>Catherine Keener deserved her Oscar nomination, playing Maxine as this vicious shrew who managed to find and find herself deserving of love. Nearly unrecognizable under a giant, frizzy wig, ministering to animals while trying to come to terms with realizing she's a man in a woman's body, Cameron Diaz gives the best performance of her career. And the switch given to John Cusack's character, from sad-sack hero to villain, proves his range. And Malkovich as Malkovich is superb.<p>Visually, it's stunning, as well. The puppet show scenes, occasionally hysterical, are just plain neat. And the scene where Malkovich enters his own portal is a particular highlight.<p>This was the best film of 1999.</p></br><a href="../users/A2QH5NMHW1KTJ1.html">A2QH5NMHW1KTJ1</a><br/><p>Warning:before watching this film you should realize that this could be one of the weirdest, craziest film of all time. It kept me scratching my head. <p>Craig Schwartz (John Cusack) is a puppeteer who is struggling for stardom in fame. In order to put food on the table, Craig decides to get a job. He finds himself as filing clerk. He then discovers a portal to the mind of John Malkovich. The portal allows you to be John Malkavich for 15. Your John Malkovich for fifteen minutes and then dumped in the turnpike of New Jersey. Then he falls in love with his co-worker Maxine (Catherine Keener)Craig, Maxine, and Craigs current wife Lotte (Cameron Diaz) charge $200 to let people be John Malkavich. But then as Lotte continues to go to the portal and then falls in love with Maxine, as Lotte continues going to the portal and being John Malkavich. It is then a war between Craig and Lotte of who's getting Maxine. It is a crazed script.<p>Personally out of this film I was just stunned. Watching this film once isn't really enough. It can be kind of disturbing in ways. Personally I thought the movie was a great success. But that's me, other people think it is a stupid film out of the story. But it is not, you will like it. Really before watching this I didn't even know who John Malkovich was, and still technically don't. And its weird to see someone play themselves.

And when he has to take a temporary job to  support his wife, Lotte (Diaz), it's the beginning of a bizarre interlude  that will ultimately take him, and a few others as well, into a realm  beyond the known.  Soon the question is, who is really pulling and  controlling the strings of whom?  Jonze has taken Kaufman's unique  screenplay, which is witty, humorous and totally engrossing, and made an  ingenious movie; in fact, there's never been anything quite like it.  It is  distinct and filled with nuance and subtle shades of humor, sometimes dark,  sometimes hilarious, but riveting throughout.  And the performances are  absolutely first rate all around.  Keener deservedly got the Oscar nod for  Best Supporting Actress, but Cusack, Diaz and Malkovich are also exemplary  here.  Cusack comes through with one of the best characters he's ever done;  there's an edgy, quiet intelligence to Craig, a Bohemian at heart, who is  reserved, generally takes things as they come, and exudes a certain boyish  charm.  He also has an apartment full of pets (snakes, birds and a chimp).  Diaz, taking on a decidedly unglamorous role, is terrific as Lotte, who is  somewhat unremarkable and works as a pet shop clerk.  It's a great  character part, and Diaz plays it for all it's worth, connecting with the  audience while ably conveying Lotte's sense of confusion and repressed  yearnings.  Malkovich (as himself) is the icing on the cake; he plays it  straight, with a finesse and distinction that makes the unbelievable  somehow credible, while lending an easy, natural flow to the innate humor  of the story.  The "Malkovich, Malkovich," sequence, and his rendition of  the "puppet's dance" are unforgettable scenes.  But character actor Orson  Bean (with his creation of the wry Dr. Lester), nearly steals the show with  a truly memorable performance; the scene in which he interviews  job-applicant Craig is classic.  The supporting cast includes Mary  Kay Place (absolutely hysterical as Floris), Charlie Sheen (Charlie),  Carlos Jacott (Larry), Willie Garson (Guy in restaurant) and Byrne Piven  (Captain Mertin).  "Being John Malkovich" is a movie that is an experience  in itself, and Jonze and his entire cast should be given a standing ovation  for bringing this one to life, for making it breathe.  It's the kind of  film you wait for to come along, but rarely does, and it demands to be seen  more than once; for when you've tasted such nectar as this, you simply have  to go back for more.</p></br><a href="../users/A3PQ3K5RKNJYA1.html">A3PQ3K5RKNJYA1</a><br/><p>What a gem of a movie. Imaginative writing that was so hilarious, I couldn't wait for the next scene, to see if it was going to be funnier that the previous one. Orson Bean (Doctor Lester) was an unbelievable filthy, dirty, sex-starved old coot - "Insane, old lech" is how John Cusak's character; Craig Schwartz put it. The interplay between Cusak and Kathryn Keener (Maxine) was "way out there." Excellent direction from Spike Jonze.<br /><br />I don't know what else to add but that this was the weirdest, most enjoyable movie I've seen in years. We should all be so lucky as to be in John Malkovich's eyes and then spit out 15 minutes later.<br /><br />"I was John fu**ing Malkovich!" - exclaimed Cameron Diaz (Lotte Schwartz).  A total crackup. "Malkovich!"  "Malkovich!"  "Malkovich!"  "Malkovich!"  You'll love "Craig's Dance Of Despair And Disillusionment"</p></br></body></html>

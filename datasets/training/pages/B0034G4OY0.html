The film focuses on the lives of three people and how they eventually intersect. Mat Damon plays a Clairvoyant who has been trying to leave that side of his life behind him, and there is a television journalist (Cecile de France) who has a near death experience, and then there is a young boy whose brother's death has left him feeling alone. This movie is less about what possibly happens after death than how people with a common interest and need come together to share their special bond. The main characters in this film seem isolated, and lonely, and alienated from those around them because of their particular unique experiences. In this way the film is really about how people connect in this life and bridge the gap between their various islands of experience.<br /><br />This film looks exceptionally good on blu-ray, and included with the special features is an 89 minute long documentary about Clint Eastwood and his career.</p></br><a href="../users/AWG2O9C42XW5G.html">AWG2O9C42XW5G</a><br/><p>this is a great movie. i really thought it was goinig to be boring, but to my suprise it was really good. the performance of the actors were great. and the story was great to. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do</p></br><a href="../users/A2H44WVZS59KKT.html">A2H44WVZS59KKT</a><br/><p>Not what I was expecting - too bad.  The first part of the movie and large portions after that were in French.  I really didn't expect a subtitled movie (even though I use closed captioning).  A very "artsy" movie,not at all what I expected from a Clint Eastwood directed movie.  There was a foreign flavor to the whole thing.<br /><br />I guess I expected more of Matt Damon's character as the psychic, rather than little flowery vignettes randomly scattered over more than two hours.  The first part of the movie I enjoyed and I got my hopes up but then sheer ennui.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>This film could not arrive on the shelves at a more appropriate time: natural disasters such as hurricanes/tornadoes/earthquakes/tsunamis/winter blizzards cover that part of the news that is not flooded with stories of man's inhumanity to man, lending a yearning for discovering some meaning to all of this.  If that meaning comes at the point of death then that is at least something to comfort us.  HEREAFTER is a thinking man's film from Clint Eastwood, a film that carries his trademark concern for human communication to a new level,  And it works.<br /><br />George Lonegan (Matt Damon) had an experience as a child with encephalomyelitis that left him with the ability to communicate with the dead -a psychic.  After some years of using this as a profession (with the aid of his brother Billy - Jay Mohr) he has given up this disturbing 'curse' and become a construction worker. Billy pleads with him to continue as a psychic but George is too disturbed by his talent and seeks peace.  Simultaneously we are introduced to a French TV journalist Marie Lelay (C&eacute;cile De France) and her boyfriend Didier (Thierry Neuvic) as the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami destroys their vacation and Marie is drowned for a while - but revives: the experience  changes her outlook and she takes a break form her Parisian YTV job to write  a book about her hereafter experience. And simultaneously the brothers Marcus and Jason (Frankie and George McLaren) try to keep their drug addicted mother whole and Jason is accidentally killed: Marcus is devastated by the loss of his brother and by the fact that he is to be placed in a foster home. These three people's lives intersect in a course of events that lands them each in London and their shared belief in the hereafter is what manages to bring them a semblance of sanity, despite the world's negative opinion of their beliefs.<br /><br />Peter Morgan  ('The Queen', 'Longford', 'Frost/Nixon', 'The Other Boleyn Girl', etc) wrote this absorbing tale and Clint Eastwood directs with a true flair for the subject matter.  The special effects are extraordinarily well done, especially the underwater sequences.  Damon and the beautiful and talented C&eacute;cile De France are excellent in their roles as are the boys who play the brothers  and the cameos by such luminaries as Derek Jacoby, Marthe Keller, Steve Schirripa, and Bryce Dallas Howard.  Though the music score is attributed to Clint Eastwood, for the most part the music is provided by excerpts form Rachmaninov's 2nd Piano Concerto!  The film goes on a bit long (over 2 hours) but the twists and turns of the action keep it well worth watching.

On one hand, Hereafter is a thought-provoking study on how different people handle their lives and life after death. On the other hand, it's a bitter disappointment when you consider the talent involved. However you feel in the end, Hereafter certainly does warrant at least one watch, if anything to see why there is such a division amongst viewers. The score is a depressing one. It sounds a lot like Unforgiven's in ways, and all of the actors are as depressing as the subject matter. They do a pretty good job at portraying the pain, grief, and all around hollowness caused by the death of a loved one. It's definitely well-acted, and the cinematography is pretty good as well. Dark and ominous are the best words to describe this one. It's a somber affair. That's obvious when considering the subject matter of the focal point of the three stories that the film revolves around. If you know me and my reviewing style, you know I hate to summarize plot, but I'll say that the three stories build up to an intersection that does absolutely nothing for the audience, or at least it did nothing for me.<br /><br />You feel for the characters throughout the story, but when they cross paths (after about two slow hours), you are left with a longing. I felt like Eastwood just ran out of story, so he wrapped it up abruptly. *Spoiler* And for a film that is so sad and depressing, the generic Hollywood happy ending pissed me off. Also, the opening sequence looked like something from 2012. Cars flipping down the street, trees falling, explosions in the background, and chaos. Don't get me wrong, it is a good sequence, but it just reminded me of 2012. My major complaint about this movie is that it really just left me feeling unfulfilled. I didn't take anything away from this, not a positive way to sum it up. I can't even explain why they took a supernatural route with it. The "Herafter" parts were pretty hokey. I didn't like The Lovely Bones either, but I'd consider watching that one again before this. I'm truly disappointed, but see it if you like Clint Eastwood. Just don't expect too much.</p></br><a href="../users/A1P98DMX8YUSNW.html">A1P98DMX8YUSNW</a><br/><p>Clint Eastwood is in his directing prime, and he keeps cranking out mega hits, including this one. They keep the religious overtones on the down-low. They ask why we wonder what happens when we die. It's a million-year-old question that started with the Egyptians, or probably before. There are no answers. The film takes its time to build. Some may say it's slow. I think it's paced just right. There's a great opening sequence that shows the Indonesian tsunami in frightening realism. Great CGI work there. I was worried we were in for some gory deaths early on, but that's not the case. Worth watching.</p></br><a href="../users/A13D1WTFEMS9VH.html">A13D1WTFEMS9VH</a><br/><p>Any film that attempts to deal with the "Hereafter" is treading on some very tricky ground. The filmmaker knows that some -- perhaps many -- will reject it out of hand, for various reasons, e.g., such a subject is not "scientific", or, conversely, how it is presented does not comport with one's deeply held religious beliefs. Mr. Eastwood deftly navigates these waters to deliver a very satisfying and thought provoking story. By raising the possibility of an afterlife through the experiences of otherwise intelligent, clear-headed people, we are confronted with a dilemma: Are these people all delusional? Or is what they have experienced real and therefore worthy of our attention? We are never clubbed over the head with any particular belief system; rather, we are instead left to ponder the question and the profound implications. Of course, Mr. Eastwood also shows us that money-grubbing charlatans, who use the desperate need of the grieving to connect with lost loved ones, abound. But the character played by Matt Damon (a reluctant "channeler" of the spirits of the dead) is the counterbalance to them. Having Mr. Damon struggle with his gift/curse is an interesting story in itself, and how this struggle plays out in the lives of the other characters is very moving. All in all, this is a unique and fascinating film.</p></br><a href="../users/A8G9GETA2OLMZ.html">A8G9GETA2OLMZ</a><br/><p>This is a movie about people whose experience with death (their own or others') transforms them.<br /><br />So in a sense it's a story about rebirth--but the rebirths are not at all what anyone expects.<br /><br />There are three stories, in three locations, and they eventually converge.<br /><br />In Paris, Marie LeLay has her world exploded by her drowning and resuscitation in a tsunami.  She can't stop thinking about her time in death, and it affects, and eventually destroys, her work, and her (apparently rich) life as a news interviewer and correspondent.<br /><br />In London, one of an indissoluble set of twins is killed, leaving the remaining brother hopeless and familyless (his mother leaves at the same time).<br /><br />In San Francisco, George Lonegan (Matt Damon), tries to begin a new life after years of heartbreaking work as a psychic connecting others to their dead loved ones.  (Lonegan himself got his "gift"--which he regards as a curse--after dying several times on the operating table as a child.)  But this life, too, shatters, when he reluctantly performs one last reading for a woman he meets in his Italian cooking class (Bryce Dallas Howard).  She is unnerved by his ability to see her childhood abuse, and she flees, and shortly after George is let go from his escapist factory job.<br /><br />With his severance money--job, hobby, and potential girlfriend gone--George decides to follow his love of Dickens to London.  (I knew I would love this movie when I heard George listening to a recording of David Copperfield--one mention of Peggoty, and I was hooked.)  Naturally, he runs into the bereaved twin boy, and also the French correspondent, who has written a book called "Hereafter" about her death-experience, and is at a London book fair.<br /><br />In some ways, the movie is like a Dickens novel--preposterous coincidences and shameless tugs on the heart.<br /><br />But that is all to the good, because it is genuinely moving and thought-provoking.<br /><br />All the characters develop, but not at all in ways that they, or we, can predict.</p></br><a href="../users/AT6CZDCP4TRGA.html">AT6CZDCP4TRGA</a><br/><p>...a Clint Eastwood movie.  This film is visually beautiful, with a more or less engrossing storyline and characters that I did come to care about...but overall is a very superficial glossing-over of an otherwise fascinating subject.  The opening scene with the tsunami is quite impressive; unfortunately, the rest of the movie doesn't quite live up to it.  The ending is predictably Hollywood as far as much-too-neatly tying up all the loose ends with a happy and fortuitous twist, but again fails to present or support any coherent theme or thrust behind the story.  There is simply no subtext at all---it's very much a straightforward, what-you-see-is-what-you-get kind of light drama, kind of a Public Service Announcement to raise awareness that hey, people who almost die usually report the same visions and there just might be a couple of genuine psychics out there amid all the fakes...not exactly breathtaking new information.<br /><br />Cecile De France is a gorgeous woman and feast for the eyes, but aside from that this is far from Eastwood's best work.  All the same, I do not regret renting it from Blockbuster.  I definitely would have regretted purchasing it, however!<br /><br />3 and 1/2 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KEZLJ59C1JVH.html">A3KEZLJ59C1JVH</a><br/><p>"Hereafter" is an amazing movie. I can't understand why it's generated such mixed reviews. The only thing I can think of is that the film was a lot different than I thought it would be based on the movie trailer, which made it out to be a scary thriller. It's not that at all. The movie revolves around three people living in three different countries who all are affected by death in some way. One man is a medium of sorts and has the ability to communicate with the dead. A woman survives a near-death experience that changes her life. And a young boy is lost after the death of his brother and is desperately searching for answers and reassurances.<br /><br />I thought the movie was great. It tackled this sensitive subject matter from multiple perspectives and was incredibly moving at times (I teared up during some of the Marcus/Jason scenes). Clint Eastwood is amazing, and "Hereafter" is just one more of his brilliant films.</p></br><a href="../users/AW3VZ5O895LRK.html">AW3VZ5O895LRK</a><br/><p>Bravo, Clint Eastwood, you really outdid yourself on making this movie.  Also, bravo to Matt Damon for not pigeonholing himself into roles but instead flexing his acting versatility every chance he gets.  I just got done watching him as Tina Fey's pilot boyfriend on 30 ROCK and the Texas Ranger in TRUE GRIT.  You would be hard pressed to tell any of these roles were the same actor!<br /><br />This film has an incredible opening, one I can see again and again.  A French female tv broadcaster is on vacation at a beach paradise on the Indian Ocean.  While she is shopping at the stalls, the tsunami which erupted from that ocean in 2004 crashes towards her.  She struggles for her life in the water but a car hits in the water and she dies and starts to cross over.  This, however, is one of those deaths where she is subsequently brought back with life guard techniques.  Yet she now is forever drawn back to that transition point.  Hers is just one of three stories but what a bang up opening to this film.<br /><br />There are two other stories.  Matt Damon is a reluctant psychic located in San Francisco.  He is the real deal unlike just about everyone else in the field.  The reason he doesn't want to do it is that it is absolutely ruinous to one's personal life as it obliterates the distance needed to carry on personal relationships.  It is hard to romance someone when you can see her entire life with just one touch. He has such an encounter with a would-be girlfriend played by Bryce Dallas Howard.<br /><br />Finally, there is a boy who loses his twin brother in a fatal collision.  He desperately wants to get in touch with his brother.  His life is a mess because after his brother's death he is removed from his mother and put into foster care. (Although, one evidently can get far better foster care families in the UK than here in the US.) It was interesting for me to see that the boy uses a computer with internet connection as his lifeline in almost every situation.  The other characters are too old for them to have been raised with a connected computer since earliest childhood.  However, with the newest generation coming up, it as natural as breathing to use it everyday for everything.<br /><br />All three of these people will ultimately come together in London.  This too works very well.  It is just an astonishing piece of filmmaking and I consider it at the very top of Eastwood's directing efforts.</p></br><a href="../users/A5A2QE6NECFR5.html">A5A2QE6NECFR5</a><br/><p>I have liked almost every film Clint Eastwood has directed, but with this story, he made lots of choices that just did not work for me. First, a word about the successful parts: I sympathized with the main character played by Matt Damon, a reluctant psychic who would like to "retire" from the practice of giving readings but who keeps encountering people who need the hope that such contacts bring. I used to give readings myself. I was trained in my mid-20's in a small church of the American Spiritualist Association, in Albuquerque. I did mediumistic readings frequently for two years, never for money, and only part-time. Many people claimed that what came through me, but not supposedly from me, was helpful. However, I grew uneasy with the practice over time, and gave fewer and fewer until doing my final one in 1984, eleven years after first learning how. I met people who only wanted their pre-determined beliefs confirmed, and people who wanted "guidance" way too frequently, and people who "channel-shopped" until they got "spiritual permission" to do what they wished to do anyway. So Matt Damon's dilemma in this film resonated with me.<br /><br />Ah, but Mr. Eastwood, you mucked up this tale of moral conflict mightily. The first two-thirds of your movie is so terribly slow, and sad, and much of it is in French, and I almost gave up on your film. Not everyone in grief is so paralyzed that he or she talks in whispers without need, or makes every physical motion take twice as long as it should. There was no real cause to make one character French and spend so much time in the details of her news anchor job. No real cause, either, to make another character British, and spend so much time showing his mom's drug abuse. All these atmospherics and opportunities to show the skylines of Paris and London do not add enough to your story line to justify the time you took doing them. I found neither the French woman nor the English boy sympathetic enough to make me root for them overmuch. The last 40 minutes were pretty good, but a film with such a title and theme should have expended more screen time showing and explaining the hereafter and less on the unpleasant details of the earthly lives of your characters.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AFXJ8U72MD6L.html">A1AFXJ8U72MD6L</a><br/><p>A tale that focuses on life and death with no fulfilling answers as the end but I think that was intentional.  Overall, this film was introspective but it dragged too much.  I was able to handle about 40 minutes before turning it off.  WHEN WATCHED: mid April 2011; MY GRADE: C to C plus.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>The age old question of what happens when we die is explored in director Clint Eastwood's elegant but slow HEREAFTER.<br />Three separate stories inevitably converge to a union of its three chief protagonists which seemed a little contrived to me, but effective nonetheless.<br />An Oscar-nominated tsunami opens the film nicely and segues into the more conventional storyline.  Eastwood's direction is understated and unobtrusive, allowing the strong performances to drive the film.  Matt Damon is excellent and generous, not succumbing to his star power nor trying to dominate the movie.  Cecile de France brings a haunting strength and eloquence to her role and the McLaren twins are heartbreakingly convincing.<br />I wasn't totally impressed because it seemed dull at times and almost too restrained as if Clint was trying to overly arthouse his direction.  I also didn't care for Bryce Howards or Jay Mohr's performances.<br />Overall, the movie offers poignant reactions to death and life without offering definitive answers.  The talent is obvious--it just didn't overwhelm me.</p></br><a href="../users/A387BD735MI50R.html">A387BD735MI50R</a><br/><p>We have three separate human interest stories taking place in three distant locations here. I thought the stories were going to prove to have some sort of clever, complex connection, a la the disparate stories in "Crash." But the "Hereafter" is a let-down on that score. Characters from the three different subplots do end up crossing paths, but their final encounter turns out to be more a matter of geographical coincidence than anything integral to their back stories.<br /><br />The common thread of these stories is supposed to be a quest into the nature of the afterlife. But the consequences of each character's questioning turns out to be - inconsequential.<br /><br />Matt Damon plays a true psychic who rather vehemently and inexplicably refuses to give readings anymore, even to the point of slamming the door on a bereaved mother who desperately wants to make contact with her recently deceased child. Damon doesn't give any sufficient reason for giving up his work as a psychic and becoming a construction worker instead. He mumbles something about not wanting to live with death all the time. But this denial of his "gift" seems essentially inexplicable and perverse. His budding romance with a young woman who might have made some sense of it all evaporates into thin air. Her sudden defection from the San Francisco cooking class where they met is not sufficiently explained. She's just in the picture one minute - and gone the next.<br /><br />Then when the Damon character does relent and gives a psychic reading, the kinds of communications he extracts from the beyond are inane. "She wants you to be happy and remarry." "He says this weightless thing is really cool." Why would the departed wrench themselves from the spirit world simply to convey such banalities? And why would the living find such comfort in these pronouncements, other than seeing in them a reassurance that their loved one still does exist somewhere, in however tedious a frame of mind?<br /><br />The theme of the Hereafter rests on one further bit of illogic. When the French investigative reporter whose life is featured in the first vignette nearly dies in the tsunami that hit Thailand - we see her near-death experience as consisting only of the sighting of vague, filmy characters lined up like stelae, reaching out to her from some cloudy afterworld. However when she revives, she says the experience changed her life. Why would it?<br /><br />Each of the three vignettes is very well-acted, and would actually have stood on its own terms as an absorbing, low-key insight into the everyday life of a distinctive personality. There's the French news anchor living a very Parisienne life. There are identical twin brothers living with a heart-warmingly dysfunctional/functional mother in England. Then there's Damon's psychic character turning his back on his visions. We see details of each life and each setting that draw us into personal knowledge of the individuals, like well-written essays draw us into a feeling of personal acquaintanceship with the authors.<br /><br />But the attempt to unite these separate lives with the overarching theme of life-after-death proves to be a bit too forced. The keystone of the Hereafter is just too weak to brace this film into anything substantial and long-standing.</p></br><a href="../users/AUUH6Z8MSGGF.html">AUUH6Z8MSGGF</a><br/><p>"Hereafter" was directed by Clint Eastwood and stars Matt Damon, C&eacute;cile De France, and Frankie and George McLaren. George Lonegan (Damon) is a psychic who views himself cursed with this "gift" of visions and the ability to talk to those in the afterlife. Marie LeLay was a respected television journalist until a brush with death in the form of a giant tidal wave inspires her to write a novel called "Hereafter". Frankie and George McLaren play the twins Marcus and Jason. Marcus is on a search for answers after his brother dies suddenly and he didn't get to say goodbye. Eventually all three cross paths in the most random of ways that will make you raise an eyebrow.<br /><br />This film tried to bill itself several different ways as if it was similar to "The Sixth Sense" (it isn't) or perhaps is a big budget thriller since it has that giant wave and another accident scene later (two scenes does not an action movie make). This is a quiet, slow-paced drama watching these people attempt to continue their lives though one feels cursed and his relationships always fall apart, one is being abandoned by those close to her that feel she is losing it, and the brother that feels like half of a whole. The whole film is just ok for me. I felt it easier to relate to the woman and the twin than the psychic's dilemma. Jay Mohr is a great casting choice for George Lonegan's brother who wants him to start making money off his talent again (with the brother as manager, of course). While Cecile and Marcus are both on a determined path looking for answers, I felt like George was wandering aimlessly just hoping to dissolve into the background, giving up on happiness all because as soon as someone finds out he is psychic, they demand a reading and don't like what they hear. The tidal wave was VERY impressive shaking my entire living room with the sound, but seeing it this week for the first time seemed far too much like the current events in Japan (which I hear this film title was pulled from the Japan market by request).<br /><br />Even if the afterlife, heaven/hell/whatever is a fascinating subject for you, the film really doesn't go very deeply into it. All the characters have very mild experiences and most of their journey takes place trying to get others in the tangible world to understand them. *Shrug* Oh and the ending made me roll my eyes so that didn't help either.<br /><br />Bonus Features:<br /><br />The movie can be played with focus points or you can watch them separately. You can learn all the different aspects that went into filming the tsunami tidal wave. Exploring the possibility of life after death just asks actors, filmmakers, and producers what their opinions are on the subject. Clint Eastwood talks about the casting of the film, who auditioned and who was given their roles on the spot, and the casting of locations, and as always the actors talk about Eastwood as a director. They interview some mediums who talk about "head-tapping" to profile violent criminals and make predictions. They also explore the bonds between twins from experience and also the filmmaker's knowledge of the "white light" experience many have when near death.<br /><br />"The Eastwood Factor" is a feature-length profile of the Actor/Director's career, in his own words, covering his over 35 years with Warner Bros. Obviously this documentary was originally made for "Invictus" because of the introduction and Morgan Freeman narrating. There are clips from tons of his movies exploring his favorite characters and aspects of his career. It's a great introduction to Eastwood for newcomers and a good refresher course for avid fans complete with a tour of his own costume library.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FWEZ0QS8N7A7.html">A2FWEZ0QS8N7A7</a><br/><p>You're 80 years old. You've won every honor available in your chosen profession. On the side you are a talented and knowledgeable composer and musician.  You always have something interesting to say through your work.  So I'm going to cut Clint Eastwood some slack, a whole lot of slack.  If he wants to ponder what comes next for him and for all of us, that's just fine with me and I'm going to watch while he does it.  It turns out I did it for Hereafter on the day of my mother's expected death at a few years older than Clint.  So I was an easy mark for the emotions of Hereafter, which are -- to be honest -- kind of predictable and manipulative, but also very entertaining.  The opening scene, by now famous, is awesome (and not in the overused slangy sense) and I'm glad to see Matt Damon and Eastwood working together again.  Neither Hereafter nor Invictus is superb, but if they continue collaborating something one day will be.  A bit of droll humor runs in the necessary subplot of Marie LeLay's (Cecile de France) proposed book about the foibles of Francois Mitterrand, which turns into something else entirely, much to the chagrin of her planned publisher.<br /><br />Hereafter is not A Perfect World, The Unforgiven, Mystic River or even Gran Torino.  In other words, it is not Eastwood at his finest.  Nonetheless, it is, as most everything he does, well worth whatever you spend to watch it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R1HAXRNU0QX7.html">A2R1HAXRNU0QX7</a><br/><p>HEREAFTER is an engrossing but frustrating film.  My interest was held throughout, yet when it was all over, I was extremely disappointed in how little my interest added up to.<br /><br />Directed by Clint Eastwood, HEREAFTER would appear to be exploring the old question "what happens to us after we die," but really it is a character study of a couple of folks who have very atypical experiences with death.  Ultimately, it isn't terribly meaningful because it is NOT universal.<br /><br />The film starts out with a bang.  We meet Marie (Cecile de France), a TV journalist on vacation in Thailand with her producer boyfriend.  She heads out of the hotel to do some last minute shopping, and in minutes, finds herself facing the tsunami that so famously devastated that region of the world some years ago.  Eastwood is not known for spending big bucks on special effects, but these scenes are fairly effective in their depiction of the awesome destructive force of the killer wave (when we see the wave gathering strength by sucking in all the water from the beach...that is pretty scary).  Marie drowns in the water, and feels herself headed towards a light where shadowy figures beckon to her.  She is brought back to our world, though...but she has been deeply changed by her experience.<br /><br />We then meet George (Matt Damon), a very shy man living along and working on a loading dock.  He seems unusually withdrawn from the world.  We discover early on that he is a psychic (apparently the real deal) with an ability to see beyond the grave and communicate with the dearly departed to send messages to their loved ones.  His ability is a compelling temptation for all who encounter him ("read me!!"), but the intimate knowledge he gathers from virtual strangers also alienates him from those folks.  His slimy brother (Jay Mohr) essentially tells him to capitalize on his abilities ("with great power comes great responsibility") but for George, he is cursed, not gifted.<br /><br />The third leg of the story is about young British twins Marcus & Jason (played by twins Frankie & George McLaren).  Jason, the stronger and more outgoing brother, is killed, and poor Marcus is sent to a foster home to stew not only about the separation from his drug-addicted mother but about his loss.  The 12-year-old is adrift...compelled to find some way to reach out to his brother again.<br /><br />All three of these characters carry a sadness with them.  Marcus is obviously saddled with grief, and Damon with loneliness...but it is Marie who is perhaps the most tormented.  She was on top of the world...a celebrity journalist who was also a model.  The world at her feet.  Yet her near-death experience leaves her feeling separate from everyone.  She wants to research her experiences and write about them. Everyone else just urges her to be quiet about it and take some time off from work.  As her career passes her by, she becomes more convinced that her experience was a revelation.<br /><br />It seems unlikely that these 3 characters would ever meet...but the plot has other contrivances in mind.  I didn't mind...I expected the ultimate meeting of these three to come and for something of import or relevance to happen.  I was left disappointed.<br /><br />But the film is interesting in large part because the three leads give outstanding performances that are well worth checking out.  McLaren does a nice job of showing the particular kind of grief a child feels.  DeFrance (previously only known to me from her fierce performance in HIGH TENSION) is a striking performer, and makes her character tough but damaged.  And Damon gives another nice performance, underplaying admirably (although occasionally coming across just a little like his character in GOOD WILL HUNTING).  Here is another actor who seems to give nuanced work under the direction of Eastwood.<br /><br />Another thing that bothered me was the feeling that the entire Tsunami scene existed only to create some really cool previews, so that folks would be more likely to come to the movie.  There is no real reason that Marie needed to have her experience in that famous, true-life tragedy.  She could have drowned in a swimming pool in Milwaukee and had the same shattering, personal experience.  Certainly the scenes are dramatically staged...but they are utterly out of character with the rest of the movie.<br /><br />HEREAFTER promises much but delivers little, beyond some really nice performances.  For me, that is just enough to recommend it to audiences who understand they are about to see a quiet, slow-paced movie; not some kind of supernatural thriller as the previews hint at.  I just wished that all the hard work had added up to more.</p></br><a href="../users/AP3B615GM191G.html">AP3B615GM191G</a><br/><p>By no means is Clint Eastwood a flashy director.  As evidenced by films like "Gran Torino" & "Million Dollar Baby", Eastwood prefers gritty, emotional human drama over contrived drama any day of week. However, with "Hereafter", Eastwood fails to instill even the most basic amount of drama to make us care about the storyline and main characters in any meaningful way.<br /><br />For a basic plot summary, "Hereafter" splits its focus on three different, seemingly unrelated events involving a retired psychic (Matt Damon), a French journalist puzzling over a near-death experience (Cecile de France), and a young child desperate to speak to the "great beyond" (Frankie McLaren).  Of course, those events turn out to be not quite as unrelated as they seem.<br /><br />While not a glaringly bad film by any means (Eastwood would never quite sink that low), this film fails to impress for two reasons:<br /><br />First, it doesn't develop the characters enough to make the audience truly care about them in the film's climax.  Yes, we know things about their recent past and why they act like they do, but it just never feels as if the characters in this film are anything more than pawns in a bigger scheme.  As such, it is tough to really "get into it" in the end.<br /><br />Also, when the film does discuss issues of the afterlife, it is far too brief and flirting to ever truly be meaningful.  I am a bit disappointed by Eastwood in this regard, as he usually attacks such high-profile issues instead of shrinking from them.<br /><br />Unfortunately, then, "Hereafter" fails to captivate on any high level.  It's nowhere in the league of "Baby" or "Torino", and doesn't even live up to its predecessor "Invictus".</p></br><a href="../users/AAECAHBNP1VD2.html">AAECAHBNP1VD2</a><br/><p>Just kind of there. That Eastwood would tackle a subject like this is ambitious and challenging, but trying to keep it intelligent and interesting seemed to be a bit of a problem, The characters -- at least the main characters -- are well fleshed-out, and their experiences were, I thought, well done. Howard's character may have been necessary for George's character development, but was ultimately annoying and overreactive; perhaps a more of a serious persona would've worked better. It also would have been nice to see a bit more resolution at the end. This isn't the type of film that can end all tied up in ribbon, but again, a little more resolution would've done a lot toward making it a better overall story.</p></br><a href="../users/A18758S1PUYIDT.html">A18758S1PUYIDT</a><br/><p>Not that there has to be a clear-cut resolution for everything, but I would have liked a bit more of the story told explicitly, especially since there are high emotional stakes for the three main characters:  Matt Damon, the reluctant psychic who can communicate with the dead; a young English boy who wants to talk to his dead twin brother; and a French woman who survives a tsunami while on vacation.<br /><br />All three come together towards the end in England, yet there does not seem to be any kind of payoff overall.<br /><br />Good performances, however, make it good enough to watch.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>"Hereafter", the new film directed by Clint Eastwood and written by Peter Mprgan ("The Queen", "The Last King of Scotland", "Frost/ Nixon") is as disappointing as a s&eacute;ance with a fake medium.<br /><br />George (Matt Damon) is the type of factory worker who makes "two grand a month" yet lives in a nice apartment in San Francisco, one of the most expensive cities in the world. George has a secret; he was once a psychic very much in demand. He did readings for many people, he had a website, he helped people talk to the dearly departed and he was qite sought after. In fact, he still is when people remember who he is. But George has always viewed this ability as a curse. He doesn't practice any more, except when pressured by his brother (Jay Mohr), and prefers to just work in his meaningless job. Because the slightest human contact can cause him to see things, he has also shied away from meaningful relationships. Meanwhile, a French television journalist, Marie (Cecile de France) and her show's producer and boyfriend vacation in a tropical paradise. On their last day, Marie wakes up early to shop for souvenirs when a tsunami hits. While under water, she has visions that haunt her far after their return to Paris. She takes time off from the show to write a book about the repression of the psychic world. In London, twin brothers, Marcus and Jason (Frankie and George McLaren) struggle trying to maintain a normal life with their drug-addict mom (Lyndsey Marshall, BBC's "Being Human"). When Jason dies, Marcus feels guilty and tries to find someway to contact him, visiting a number of people who profess to use different methods of contacting the dearly departed. Eventually, the three people will meet and help each other.<br /><br />I am a huge fan of Eastwood's films and have had many long and passionate debates about "Unforgiven" with one of my best friends. She doesn't like the film. I have spent many hours trying to convince her this is the great film many recognize. However, she obstinantly refuses to see she is wrong. But we agree about "Hereafter", although her reaction was a little stronger than mine. She said it was the first film in a long time in which she has actually wanted her money back, she felt robbed. I wouldn't go that far. But there are a lot of problems with "Hereafter", so many that thornhill can't recommend it.<br /><br />Let's start with the ending. After watching two hours of somber, maybe even somnambulistic storytelling, Eastwood and Morgan have designed an ending that is just so out of place it rings completely false. Worse, for two men who have created some of the most memorable films in recent memory, it rings like an ending more suited for a television show. Obviously, I can't reveal what happens, but it leaves a bad taste in the mouth. And as this is the last moment we spend in this universe, a bad last image is not a good thing.<br /><br />Next, we have Matt Damon. I get why he walks through the story as though he is sleepwalking, but it doesn't make his character very engaging. George is trying to stave off the nightmares, he gets nightmares when he has the visions, he has visions when he touches people, and he touches people when he meets them. To prevent all of this from happening, George is simply lonely, preferring to spend many hours in his apartment alone. He spends much of his time working in a factory, driving a forklift. Throughout, George walks through the film as though he wishes he were dead. And to portray this, Damon simply keeps his face blank or impassive throughout. It isn't real engaging to watch one of the more engaging actors of our generation walk somberly through the storty.<br /><br />The best part of the film, involves a cooking class George decides to take at an Extension program. There, the chef (Steve Schirippa) teams him up with Melanie (Bryce Dallas Howard). Over the course of their relationship, we see illustrations of everything we are supposed to know about George. These moments gives us a better idea of who and what George is supposed to be in twenty minutes.<br /><br /> I wish there had been more of these moments and fewer moments of George walking around with a dour, pained expression on his face. This would have increased the pacing of the film and helped to move the story along, making the overall film better.<br /><br />Cecile de France (come on, is that her real name?) plays Marie, the rancorous journalist who is famous for raking her interview subjects over the coals. After she begins to have her visions, she decides  to investigate and finds the study of the after life, of the hereafter, has never been taken seriously. She decides to write a book about it and shelves the other book her publisher has paid her for. Naturally, he is reticent to publish something "more suitable for the Americans". This is an interesting idea, but the storyline eventually plays out as something barely plausible. Because the study is not taken seriously, she investigates and has long conversations with her boyfriend, with a doctor, with other people. In an effort to make this part of the story work, these long conversations and investigations have the opposite effect. Instead, Marie's journey becomes an illustration of an old stereotype of French culture. People sit in groups and endlessly discuss.<br /><br />It isn't a great idea to include tons of interviews and discussions in a fiction film. Film is a visual medium and should illustrate a story with images, with action, with movement.<br /><br />Also, we don't really know what Marie was like before. Before the tsunami. Before the visions. All we know is that she is famous. What would have really helped this story is to show us an example of how Marie used to be, perhaps grilling some company executive on her television show. This would provide a nice counterpoint to the interview she conducts after returning from vacation. Her producer tells her to rip into the subject. But she can't concentrate and lets him off easy.<br /><br />The story of Marcus and Jason is the most interesting and the most believable. The McLaren brothers, who play the twins, are very naturalistic giving us a look at how two real brothers might deal with the situation. As Marcus deals with the Foster system in London and his attempts to contact Jason, everyone around him seems very natural as well, as though we might be eavesdropping on a conversation.<br /><br />You may not be aware of this, but Eastwood has been very involved in the music of his films for decades. This passion led him to direct "Bird" and he has scored and or composed the music for many of his films. Lately, he was also started to play the music, plucking out chords on a guitar in the background. This worked during "Gran Torino" (and Eastwood even sings during the closing credits) but in "Hereafter", this same guitar playing, selectively used throughout, only serves to make the pace of the film seem even more somnambulistic.<br /><br />Essentially, the "Hereafter" is not a place I want to visit again and that isn't something I have said about a lot of Eastwood's films.</p></br><a href="../users/A3APW42N5MRVWT.html">A3APW42N5MRVWT</a><br/><p>Well made and deliberately unspectacular (well, at least after the opening sequence).

Had I not known this was a Clint Eastwood joint beforehand, I never would've guessed (although the spare guitar recalls the theme from "Unforgiven"). It can't be a coincidence that he took this subject for what has to be one of his final films.<br /><br />Cecile de France, as one of the leads, is gorgeous to the point of special effects, and the opening scene -- an astonishing depiction of a tsunami that struck Indonesia in 2004 -- is one of the most moving, most harrowing sequences of the past year, amazingly executed.</p></br><a href="../users/A1XT8AJB7S9JJG.html">A1XT8AJB7S9JJG</a><br/><p>If you had a gift that ruined your life but helped others...would you use it?

French journalist Marie (De France) goes through an expierence that leaves her with the same condition.  Finally Marcus, a boy, loses his brother and wants to try and talk to him again.  All three of these stories intertwine and we watch as each person tries to handle what life has thrown at them.  This movie was really good, but also very slow moving.  It reminded me alot of "Babel".  It switches pretty often between the three stories and you start to really feel for all three main stars and identify with thier problems.  With the events that just occured in Japan the opening takes on a whole new feel...good or bad it will effect you in a way the film makers probebly never intended.

It is explained that because of a near death operation that he now has the ability to communicate with the dead. While this appears to be a plausible explanation, it should be noted that this is only fiction. According to Christian beliefs, the souls of the dead do not just drift about waiting to talk to their relatives through `mediums'.<br /><br />The Plot<br /><br />The plot starts out on three fronts:<br /><br />[1] - a French reporter who turns writer, her life is changed by a tsunami;<br />[2] - 2 brothers (twins) one is killed and the other desperately misses him; and<br />[3] - a necromancer who is trying desperately to live a normal life.<br /><br />In the end, the lines are all neatly tied up.

It is not hard to see executive producer Spielberg's schmaltzy wishful thinking pervading this childish excursion into the phenomenon of psychic silliness.  There is an audience pleasing tsunami sequence at the outset; but all hope of ongoing insights are flushed away just like the tropical tourist trap.  It might work as a fantasy for adolescents, although they are unlikely to tolerate anything this slow, let alone subtitled sequences.  Uh oh, gotta go, Mommy is yelling at me from heaven for giving this a bad review!</p></br><a href="../users/A18G7GG53G2X8A.html">A18G7GG53G2X8A</a><br/><p>Many of us have a terrible tendency to pigeonhole filmmakers into the genres we think they're best suited for. When I first saw the trailer for "Hereafter," I, like much of the moviegoing public, was unpleasantly surprised at the thought of Clint Eastwood having directed a supernatural drama. Given his recent triumphs with films like "Mystic River," "Million Dollar Baby," "Changeling," "Gran Torino," and "Invictus," it just didn't seem like something he would have or should have done. As usual, I was reacting impulsively; "Hereafter" is an incredibly strong film, in large part because Eastwood resisted the temptation to treat it as a thriller. It certainly has mysterious elements, but for the most part, it's a poignant, thought-provoking story of how different people react to traumatic circumstances.<br /><br />The common thread of the story is death - or, more accurately, what awaits us after we die. Although glimpses of a spiritual void are revealed, neither Eastwood nor writer Peter Morgan makes any grand claims as to what it is or how it works. In other words, the film assumes the reality of life after death, but it doesn't linger on details such as heaven, hell, purgatory, or anything else resembling eternal punishment or eternal reward. There isn't even a discussion about the existence of God. This isn't a criticism. We've seen far too many movies in which deathly states are both explicitly examined and regarded with either extreme sentimentality or extreme terror; "Hereafter" wisely avoids these clich&eacute;s, in effect keeping the true nature of death a mystery.<br /><br />The film is initially structured as three separate storylines, all of which theatrically but cleverly converge during the final act. In the first storyline, we follow Marie Lelay (C&eacute;cile de France), a French television journalist for a left-wing political program. While on vacation, a tsunami tears through the resort and sweeps her away, causing a near death experience. (While never directly stated, I'm forced to assume that Eastwood was depicting the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami that destroyed coastal cities in Indonesia, India, Thailand, and Sri Lanka.) Miraculously, she's revived. However, upon returning to France, she finds the experience has had more of an effect than she ever thought possible. She can no longer concentrate on her work, damaging her celebrity status. She's consumed with thoughts of life after death, a possibility that neither her atheist lover (Thierry Neuvic) nor her secular coworkers are willing to consider.<br /><br />The second story focuses on George Lonegan (Matt Damon) a San Francisco factory worker who, after a childhood illness, gained psychic powers, specifically the ability to talk to the dead. He doesn't consider it a blessing, and he flatly refuses to step back into the spotlight as a celebrity psychic. In an Italian cooking class, he strikes up a friendship with a female student named Melanie (Bryce Dallas Howard), which seems like the beginnings of a contrived Hollywood romance until he takes her to his apartment; at that point, a simple but disturbing scene makes his reasons for trying to keep his ability abundantly clear. His brother (Jay Mohr) simply doesn't understand where he's coming from; the way he sees it, George is missing out on a tremendous financial opportunity.<br /><br />The third story centers on a British boy named Marcus (Frankie McLaren), whose identical twin brother, Jason (George McLaren), is struck and killed after running in the middle of the street. This tragedy is made worse due to the fact that his mother, Jackie (Lyndsey Marshal), is a both drug addict and an alcoholic, forcing her into rehab; Marcus, now alone and in foster care, becomes withdrawn and moody, looking uncannily like the proverbial creepy child from a horror movie - pale skin, sunken eyes, and never a smile on his face. He gets obsessed with finding some way to reconnect with Jason's spirit, thus beginning his citywide search for a medium, someone who isn't merely selling crackpot ideas but can actually speak with the dead.<br /><br />This particular plotline includes one of the film's best scenes, in which Jackie tearfully but bravely says goodbye to Marcus in the Social Services office. The reason it works so well is because it develops Jackie against our expectations. We've been conditioned by other films to see characters like her as hopeless and uncaring; I was prepared for scenes of emotional breakdowns and irrational behavior, such as her being completely unable to cope with Jason's death and somehow finding a way to blame it on Marcus. But nothing that conventional ever happens - even before her son dies, we see that she's finally coming to terms with her addiction problems, and her resolve only seems to strengthen after Jason's funeral. So too does her love for Marcus.<br /><br />The ending is perhaps too conventional, although it appropriately challenges George's assertion that absolutely nothing good can come from his psychic abilities. It also nicely plays into the film's message, namely that, regardless of whether or not there is life after death, we must make the most of the time we're given here on Earth. Inevitably, this will involve the difficult but necessary task of moving on after a period of grieving; life is not about staying in the past, but going ahead. There may be certain atmospheric elements of "Hereafter" that seem atypical for Clint Eastwood, but in no way do they affect his affinity for strength of character and engaging stories. Don't dismiss this movie simply because of its supernatural overtones. There's so much more to it than that.</p></br><a href="../users/A18SDN3HYFVH2L.html">A18SDN3HYFVH2L</a><br/><p>A tsunami rushes in on an island resort where Marie (C&eacute;cile De France) and Didier (Thierry Neuvic) are staying.  Both survive, but Marie almost drowns and has a near-death experience, with ghostly light and indistinct figures...George Lonergan (Matt Damon), an apparently psychic American in San Francisco, is pushed into giving a reading for Christos (Richard Kind), a business associate of his brother Billy (Jay Mohr); George resents doing it, claiming that his "gift" is really a curse...in London, twin brothers Marcus and Jason (Frankie and George McLaren) struggle to help their drug-addict mother (Lyndsey Marshal) keep it together enough so that they don't get taken away by the social services - but fate has tragedy in store for them.  Three stories, linked by death, gradually coming together, gradually influencing each other.<br /><br />The bulk of HEREAFTER is about coping; George copes with his unwanted abilities, feeling isolated from his brother and even from the attractive and interested young woman (Bryce Dallas Howard) that he meets at a cooking class.  When she thrusts herself on him and pushes him into making dinner at his place with her, she finds out a bit of his guarded past, and the results aren't what either of them desire.  Marie finds both her relationship with Didier and her job as a television journalist faltering, as she decides to write her dream book about a late French politician but can't forget her near-death experiences; and Marcus struggles with loss and even comprehension as a child who feels his life cut in two.  Very gradually, all of them are drawn in similar directions, emotionally and eventually physically.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood's 31st film as director is, like a large percentage of his work, concerned with death.  Strangely enough though this film marks an inversion or reworking of many of his previous concerns, in that death begins the film, is at the very heart of the lives of most of the main characters - and yet, ultimately, is less oppressive and less a tragedy or even endpoint than it is in most of his previous films.  In almost every way, the film starts out in major keys and works its way towards the minor chords, from loudness to quiet, from tragedy to possibility.  It's a film very much imbued with the literary and musical worlds - strands of opera impinge periodically on Eastwood's fine low-key score, and De France's character is a writer and journalist while Damon's is obsessed with Charles Dickens.  Cinematically, it works out as a very un-dramatic drama, and even the coming together of the three plot strands seems inevitable and preordained as a literary device rather than the movie-thriller that the misleading advertising promises.<br /><br />The film is going to irk a lot of people because of its slow pacing, and its refusal to come to anything definite in regards to the questions posed throughout.  And there are going to be people who are serious skeptics and cynics who won't like the hints of the extraordinary throughout the film - which remain, for the most part, just hints.  But this is not a film trying to come up with any answers to life's ultimate questions - Eastwood and screenwriter Peter Morgan aren't interested in such simple pieties, and they are wise enough to know offering such bones for the audience wouldn't let their characters off the hook.  These are people that have to live with the facts of death and what it means to those who survive - even knowing what comes afterward, if anything, wouldn't necessarily make the daily business of getting on with things any better.  And all of them begin to realize this over the course of the film; if there's a definite message here, it's that while the conversation about death and it's meaning is a worthwhile one, it's this business of living and overcoming our dark obsessions with the afterlife that is important, and that makes our lives in the here and now worth anything.<br /><br />HEREAFTER is put together with Eastwood's habitual economy and grace; as has been said many times about his work, it's a film with nearly invisible direction.  This might not always be a compliment, but in this case it very much is; apart from the big CGI tsunami at the beginning and a couple of other important scenes that I don't want to spoil, the camerawork is never ostentatious, never gets in the way of the characters or feelings, which are just about all the film is concerned with.  The focus then is on the actors, and they do not disappoint.  This is the best piece of large-ensemble acting that I've seen in a while and it may be the best cast Clint has ever put together.  Bryce Dallas Howard is extraordinarily charming and winsome in an ultimately unfulfilled role; C&eacute;cile de France is luminous and conveys a careworn look that seems to age her a decade from her first scene to the rest of the film; the British cast members are all terrific and I'd especially like to cite Lyndsey Marshal for a small but powerfully moving portrayal of a woman on the brink.  Matt Damon, though, is working on a level that echoes his director's work, disappearing into his role so completely that he had me completely feeling for him from the beginning.  He is ultimately the engine that drives the resolution of the plot, and yet as a very passive and introverted character it's a challenge to make it believable that he would be able to push himself as he does in the last scenes in the film; somehow Damon conveys that inner power and specialness with an ordinary - deliberately ordinary - exterior in a way that is riveting.  I've rarely seen an "average Joe" who is so compelling.<br /><br />And it's the reality imbued in these special-yet-ordinary characters that makes the last few scenes, aiming for a magic and transcendence that I'm not sure I've ever seen Clint Eastwood attempt - and that few directors in Hollywood today are capable of or interested in attemptin - work.  If you weren't pulled in, put on the edge of your seat by this slow, somber but intense film, you'll probably find the ending stupid.  If like me you really feel like all this contemplation of death, and the futility of really understanding it, has made the small fantasies and artifices in the film fade away and left you with some kind of higher truth - however indistinct, like C&eacute;cile's blurry deathly visions - you may well be enraptured, as I was.<br /><br />It's unfortunate that the trailer for this film seems to promise something like this summer's hit INCEPTION; and given that more people know Matt Damon for the "Bourne" films than anything else, a lot of people will be expecting a thriller, something with sci-fi or fantasy overtones, excitement, effects... They're not going to get it.  If there's a model to compare HEREAFTER to, I'd suggest the last few films from the great Japanese director Akira Kurosawa, who like Clint Eastwood made his name with films dealing in violence and action, but ended his career on a quiet, reflective and humanistic note.  It's a tribute to how great a filmmaker Eastwood has become that he can stand in such company.<br /><br />One of Eastwood's best films, and my favorite film of 2010 so far.</p></br><a href="../users/A36EW68H08UOCS.html">A36EW68H08UOCS</a><br/><p>Eastwood the Director may wind up in history more well-known than Eastwood the Actor, and for the man who played Dirty Harry and The Man With No Name, in addition to brilliant starring roles in his own films such as Unforgiven and Million Dollar Baby - that is saying something.<br /><br />Hereafter is a film with three different plots headed toward a common destination.  In one strand Cecile De France plays Marie, a Parisian Journalist who is saved from drowning in a tsunami and finds that she can't extricate her private and professional lives from the experience.  Frankie and George McLaren play twin brothers Marcus and Jason.  The brothers have a drug-addicted single mother and share the task of shielding her and themselves from the authorities before tragedy strikes.  In the final thread Matt Damon plays George Lonegan, the character you know the other characters are moving toward.<br /><br />George has the ability to talk to the dead through contact with people who have connections to the deceased.  He explains halfway through the film that he developed this ability after a near-death experience, and although his brother (played by Jay Mohr) thinks "the gift" is a gold-mine that should be exploited, George tries explaining repeatedly that it is a curse rather than a blessing.  (Any person George touches floods him with images of the dearly departed.)<br /><br />The film moves slowly.  After the opening Marie doesn't want to be a journalist so much as explore the world of near-death experiences.  We see young Marcus visiting sham psychics.  In a series of scenes we see Damon's George reluctantly give "readings".  One of the strengths of the film is that it contrasts the work of the fake psychics, who use clues obtained reading body language and facial expressions, with the dilemma of a person like George, who can't turn his power off, which invariably makes it impossible for him to develop actual relationships. How can you be "normal" if every time you touch a fellow human - you see dead people? Bryce Dallas Howard plays a pleasant woman George meets in cooking class.  George attempts to hide his psychic ability from her, but when she finds out, she pressures him into a reading.  What begins looking like a simple parlor trick instead rips open decades-old wounds.<br /><br />For action addicts the film moves glacially after the tsunami scene, but the emotional payoff at the end is worth the trip.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DDPQ9342UNMY.html">A3DDPQ9342UNMY</a><br/><p>HEREAFTER deserves a very mixed review because it deals only superficially with the supernatural and offers no real answers despite the fact that its craftsmanship is undeniable.<br /><br />After a brilliant start with the tsunami wreaking havoc as giant waves sweep over an entire village beach front, I expected HEREAFTER was about to delve into and explore the possibilities of an afterlife.<br /><br />Instead, we examine the lives of three separate individuals whose lives are about to converge rather unconvincingly at the finale. Meantime, we have no idea where the story is going until the final scene. There's an uneven quality to the thread of the story with many scenes played too long before getting near the payoff.<br /><br />But overall, the acting is excellent, particularly that of the little boys, FRANKIE and GEORGE McLAREN, who play the twin brothers effectively, CECILE DeFRANCE, the French woman who almost drowns during the tsunami and her lover (THIERRY NEUVIC), who makes the deepest impression as far as acting and charisma goes. MATT DAMON is effective as the psychic who wants nothing more to do with his "gift." But at all times, the script gives nothing more than a surface treatment of the hereafter and avoids delving into a deeper look at the supernatural implied by the film's title.<br /><br />HEREAFTER could have been a great film. As it is, it's uneven, slowly paced, and avoids the paranormal aspects that its title implies will be touched, especially since its main character is a psychic. But on the credit side, the opening sequence is amazing for its special effects. Unfortunately, what follows is not as absorbing, challenging or thought-provoking as it ought to be.<br /><br />The cooking class scenes between BRYCE DALLAS HOWARD and MATT DAMON were dragged out and less than satisfying, due to her irritating habit of delivering giggles with each line to suggest the airiness of her character. Furthermore, their relationship is never fully explored once he agrees to do a psychic reading. She just disappears from the plot line after foolishly begging Damon to practice his skill. The script might have taken a better turn if it resolved their relationship in a meaningful way for the conclusion. Likewise, there are other scenes that are totally irrelevant and give the story a lack of focus.<br /><br />An attempt to end the story of our three main characters on a bright note is only so-so in effect. I'd have preferred a deeper look at the supernatural than this hints at being and the ending just seemed downbeat and contrived.<br /><br />The acting throughout is uniformly fine and special praise is due MATT DAMON, THIERRY NEUVIC and the McLAREN brothers, all giving top-rated performances. Clint Eastwood's direction is fine but the script presented too many obstacles for any director to overcome.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>In "Hereafter" are told three seemingly unrelated stories, about French news reporter Marie Lelay (C&eacute;cile De France), who survives the horrifying tsunami while on vacation; a San Francisco factory worker and retired psychic George Lonegan (Matt Damon), who considers his unusual abilities as a curse; and London twins Marcus and Jason (Frankie and George McLaren) living with their substance-addicted mother.<br /><br />I am not going to repeat what other reviewers have rightly said about Clint Eastwood's latest film. It is quiet and thoughtful (with the effectively moody cinematography from Tom Stern). This is not a supernatural thriller, but a drama about those who are trying to cope with the inevitable or, perhaps more precisely, its consequence. The theme is immediate and the film is well-intentioned, I know that for sure.<br /><br />With all respect to veteran director Clint Eastwood and the serious subject matter that is dealt here, however, narrative of "Hereafter" is disappointingly flat. It is not boring. It is, for lack of better word, predictable. About one hour in, you get where three stores are leading us, and the way the film is trying to reach there is not very compelling, but just contrived.<br /><br />Peter Morgan, screenwriter of "Frost/Nixon" fame, fails to invest his characters with enough personality to further each story. Many say the opening tsunami sequence looks hauntingly real. I agree. But I just don't see how Marie's near-death experience influenced her life after the shocking event. What these characters experience has profound dimensions, loss and sadness resonant to us all. Sadly, what they are (and do after their life-changing experiences) does not generate emotional resonance.</p></br><a href="../users/AXSH6O4OP5L4M.html">AXSH6O4OP5L4M</a><br/><p>I was a little disappointed in the film.  I'm not certain what I expected, but this seemed a little flat.  I suppose when you start out with a tsunami and drop down to private experiences with death, you go from shock to flat.  The only real highlight in the midst of it was the near miss with death of the surviving twin, Marcus.<br /><br />The acting was quite good.  I was especially impressed with Marcus, whose twin was killed in an accident, and his mother, whose personal problems had reduced the family to a shambles.  The acting here was intense and very real.<br /><br />In all, the film had the feeling of an assembly line process.  Everyone did their bit on their own home turf according to availability, and the featured actors met on common ground for the d&eacute;nouement.  No fuss, no muss, no bother.  Sometimes that works really well.  Richard Curtis, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JMFQ">Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)</a>, has used a similar format with great success. Given the renown and ability of the director and producer here (Eastwood and Spielburg), I expected more.  It just didn't work for me this time.</p></br><a href="../users/A1845IJB63D5H7.html">A1845IJB63D5H7</a><br/><p>Captivating start in a Tsunami scene in South East Asia that ended up in a life changing trauma. Had that story unfolded throughout the movie, it might have made a great film. Here, the French media icon suddenly lost her most precious gift of staying focused after concussion in a drowning accident. Surrounded by wolves and cold blooded business folks, she was given no chance to regain herself. Her sexuality and outlook got her to the top, but her brief and tragic suffering caused her to be dumped by her very abusers. One of those suggested that the English folks would be more perceptive to the delusion of after death, and he would soon be proven correct.<br /><br />The second story that would converge on the other two, took place in San Francisco. As the French businessman conjectured,the America Psychic who was a schizophrenic patient would miraculously climb the wall, from a forklift driver, to a fan of Charles Dickens, to the future lover of the French icon. That one was a truly kooky fabrication and inexplicable twist. The medicated schizophrenic was able to connect with the dead in such reliable and verifiable manner that made the movie discomforting.<br /><br />The second best story, or the first best, was the British twin boys who struggled with an impoverished and alcoholic, but loving single mom. The acting and emotions of the kids and their associates were remarkable.<br /><br />Returning to the French media icon, it sounded too simplistic for a well educated professional to ask the dumbest questions about a vision she had. As if such media icon who was able to face the whole world with critique and analysis, could not figure out her state of traumatized mind after the trauma of approaching death.  Ending up with an American schizophrenic lover was an outstretch of imagination.</p></br><a href="../users/A39W3263A9HCMN.html">A39W3263A9HCMN</a><br/><p>First off, you have that totally useless subplot with Cecile De France (that CAN'T be her real name...?). You could cut the entire subplot out and not lose a thing. Her character is totally lame and unlikable (and so is that douche she's dating in the film) and worst of all, the subplot is boring as hell. She just spends time thinking about her magical escape from death in the opening tsunami scene, which should have been looped continuously for two hours, as it would have been better than the B/S we got.<br /><br />Then you have Matt Damon's subplot, which plays like a really bad episode of Ghost Whisperer. Seriously he should have won a razzie, his performance here is so bad it's beyond surrealism. He is basically this psychic who can talk to dead people, and he meets this messed up hot chick in an Italian Cooking school, a subplot within a subplot that is soon left to die. I really can't remember what happened in this subplot, it was so damned uninteresting.<br /><br />The ONLY interesting story was the British kid. I'll admit this movie was a bit of a nostalgic rush for me (which may be why it gets one star as opposed to 0) because a week before I watched this movie, I was in London and Paris for vacation. But this was an interesting substory, as he loses his twin brother, lives with a drug-addled mother, and has trouble adjusting to life with a new family. I'll admit there were a few humorous scenes and his search to talk to his brother was interesting and had me wanting to know more. Actually the movie could have been this and it would have worked a solid 3/5 off the bat.<br /><br />And then the ending where it all comes together is just LAME!!!! If I am going to sit through a movie with 3 subplots with only one being even remotely interesting, I want a satisfactory conclusion. And don't get me started on the Romatic Comedy puke-fest of an ending. It brought back painful memories of "The Tourist".<br /><br />I really love Clint, but this film was just an embarassment on every level. This came from the same Clint Eastwood who gave us the amazing "Gran Torino", bear in mind. I don't even think replacing Matt Damon with Jennifer Love Hewitt would have saved the film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KIQ4P4ZW3ALF.html">A1KIQ4P4ZW3ALF</a><br/><p>Credibility:<br />The movie was in immediate "credibility" trouble when one of our stars is hanging onto a tree in the midst of a raging mountainous raging river of a tsunami and<br />(a.) as someone who has rafted the Snake River in Hell's Canyon I'll tell you right now that was not possible; she would have sucked in water and been dragged under.<br />(b.) while clinging to the tree she is hit by a car floating at a high rate down stream and ends up with a bruise -  should have been crushed.<br />(c.) the amount of time she's under with no control - she should have drowned.<br />(d.) but, somehow she's suddenly appears on a roof top being resuscitated.<br />I know, picky but that sets the tone for how the movie is being produced. One hour and fifteen minutes of  tedium as to knowing obviously where the movie is heading, i.e. that the three character subplots who are in three different countries will magically come together at the end and live happily ever after. End of story - except, of course, the hereafter.<br /><br />Incorrect portrayals:<br />(a.) Portraying science quotes:  "scientists minds are closed to such things as hereafter myths"; "evidence is irrefutable"; "others that disagree are enemies". First, scientists welcome all possibilities -  witness quantum, chaos, singularities and GUTs. Second, nothing is irrefutable in scientific process - everything is refutable. Third, disagreement is welcome. That is part of the process of how science advances. No one has an investment in being right, just in advancing the discussion.<br />(b.) The hereafter is shown as little statue people surrounded by a light is portrayed as real because "when unconscious no fresh images can be produced"; "there is no sense of time/space and you feel weightless". All are offered as proof of a hereafter. WRONG! Whether dead or unconscious the brain continues to function with cellular stores of oxygen and glucose for minute(s) and as they are depleted the normal white light effect becomes tunneled. Not surprisingly the one image you want to create when dying is someone important to you. The other evidences are normal for anyone who has ever had night time dreams.<br /><br />Producer bias:<br />It is not coincidental that Eastwood would make such a movie because there is nothing more desirable for a person approaching the end to not want it to end. Even more so if your life has been an accumulation of idolatry and materialism. The more you have the harder it is to lose it.  Preserving and passing on wealth to your descendants has been common fare for thousands of years - Egyptians!. It's just an additional pathway to immortality.  Sorry Clint - it just ends.</p></br><a href="../users/A2WZ1B92F81LJJ.html">A2WZ1B92F81LJJ</a><br/><p>Truly great cinema is a form of emotional conjuring trick: a way of presenting sounds and images - which, by their nature, we know have been contrived to induce a certain emotional and intellectual reaction - in a way which nonetheless genuinely induces that reaction.<br /><br />It's a trick that Clint Eastwood, against the odds, has become rather good at. So much so that, by his reputation alone, part of his work is done before we even take our seats: we like Clint Eastwood: we like his films. We will him to present a film what will enthral us. Our suspension of disbelief is fully willing. We happily disregard occasional dissonances. Clint Eastwood has earned the benefit of our doubt.<br /><br />And so, Hereafter opens promisingly: A black screen, backed by gentle augmented trills on a Spanish guitar, builds into a wide shot of a languid Pacific paradise. We know from its title this is a film about loss, so we look for a sign of lurking menace. And there it is: the gently breaking surf. Behind it, the sleeping heft of the azure ocean. We track a handsome French couple around their hotel room. There, reflected in every window, lying in wait behind every vista: that casual, loitering threat.<br /><br />So far, so very, very good.<br /><br />We are aided by the introduction of C&eacute;cile de France, a Class A smouldering French beauty. She magnetises our attention in a way that only Class A smouldering French beauties can. As the monstrous ocean broods, she flounces grumpily out of the love nest, leaving her layabout boyfriend to lie in while she arranges checkout, orders him breakfast, and goes out to buy gifts for his kids. His kids.<br /><br />Our internal voice says, "a lazy, married, bounder of a paramour? He'll be a villain then."<br /><br />But wait a minute: Isn't that a bit obvious? Did we just see a magician's wire?<br /><br />We park the dissonance: Clint Eastwood has earned that. There follows shortly a set piece involving a natural catastrophe: I won't spoil what it is, but it drives much of the drama that subsequently unfolds. Now: if you were a director of this sort of film, how would you present such a plot driver: by subtle touch - implying the horror; leaving the carnage to the reader's imagination? Or would you cart in Industrial Light & Magic and give it the whole Bruckheimer treatment?<br /><br />Another odd dissonance. Still, we park it. The scene isn't all ham-fisted, by any stretch: Along the way Eastwood throws in some thoughtful tableaux: It is a film about death, but who is dying? What is the afterlife we glimpse? Is it really anything of the sort? Carefully, Eastwood refrains from answering (though there will be those viewers who will miss the subtle equivocation and assume he does).<br /><br />The narrative driver triggered, Hereafter settles down to exposition. We are introduced to three unrelated, geographically dislocated stories, so there is a lot of it. It's a magic trick, remember, so we know there will be some pay-off by which all this narrative will come together, but as the film progresses it is hard to imagine how this could possibly happen. We think: it will take a skilled conjurer indeed to pull this one off.<br /><br />And, as these strands slowly unfurl themselves, the odd dissonances keep ringing.<br /><br />We meet twin 12-year-old brothers, each astonishingly self-motivated, diligently doing their homework in their council estate flat and organising their own photographic portraits while their heroin addict mother (it is implied) turns tricks and comes home blitzed out of her brains. When Social Services come knocking, the boys resourcefully hold them off, covering for and reconditioning their mother. They singlehandedly hold together their household. Again, a dissonance: implausibility. We think: really?<br /><br />As we alternate between the stories, we're given rather clanging signposts to show us which one we're in: A wide shot of the Eiffel Tower for France: Tower Bridge for London.<br /><br />We meet Matt Damon - excellent, as ever, and unquestionably the beating heart of the film. He's in San Francisco, a retired psychic called George Lonegan. Eastwood equivocates ever-so subtly about Lonegan's "gift", and the extent of it (again, credulous viewers will miss this). But, Eastwood defuses this tension: However real Lonegan's powers may be, he is no charlatan. He's saddled, not blessed, with the gift. He refuses to profit from it, or even use it. When he is obliged into exercising it (rather easily, it must be said: the lady doth protest too much, methinks), he does it decently. He doesn't manipulate: he isn't cruel. Somewhat needlessly, we're invited to further admire Lonegan for his passion for Charles Dickens. (In a visit to Dickens' house, Lonegan thrills an entire tour party by correctly identifying a picture of the author asleep while all his characters float around him as "Dickens' Dream". I mean, the acumen!)<br /><br />Still dissonances continue to ring. Eastwood's emotional manipulation begins to reveal itself. Particularly with the London Twins, who have been written so sympathetically that no acting or film-making talent is required to ensure we are emotionally invested in them: Who wouldn't be? But then it slowly occurs that very little film-making or acting talent is on display anyway. Again, we wonder, is that a magician's wire we can see?<br /><br />Finally, the spell is broken: our French Bombshell, Marie Le Lay (a comedy name almost as good as the actress' real one) visits a Swiss mountain-top clinic specialising in knowledge about the afterlife (I couldn't tell whether it was a cancer hospice, a suicide clinic, or both) to be lectured on plot signposting so she could bring the picture home. It is a clumsy scene: clumsily conceived, clumsily scripted and clumsily acted.<br /><br />It was then it hit me that Clint Eastwood had totally, completely, lost my complicity in his enterprise: his conjuring trick had failed. Hereafter was suddenly preposterous, manipulative and, frankly, daft.<br /><br />I looked at my watch. We were a good hour and a half into the movie, and there was scant evidence of a means to drive the characters together.<br /><br />And then suddenly, in a tsunami of implausibility, there they all were: a redundant factory worker from San Francisco, a ten year old boy from South London and a French television Journalist, all wandering around Alexandra Palace in North London. Again, you think: *really*?<br /><br />As the credits rolled, I was left wondering what Eastwood had said, artistically, while presenting his illusion. I concluded: not really anything. The film is no more or less equivocal about the afterlife than it was at the beginning, and in any case has very little to say about it anyway. If it was a metaphor for something else, it was difficult to comprehend what.<br /><br />We will see more of C&eacute;cile de France in the coming months and years, I dare say, but how well this film does in the hereafter is harder to predict.<br /><br />Olly Buxton</p></br><a href="../users/A2RHQMV5GD18Z8.html">A2RHQMV5GD18Z8</a><br/><p>Hereafter<br />Directed by Clint Eastwood<br />Starring Matt Damon, C&eacute;cile De France, Bryce Dallas Howard and Jay Mohr<br /><br />Warner Bros. | 2010 | 129 min | Rated PG-13 | Released Mar 15, 2011<br /><br />Video:<br />Video codec: MPEG-4 AVC<br />Video resolution: 1080p<br />Aspect ratio: 2.40:1<br /><br />Audio:<br />English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1<br />French: Dolby Digital 5.1<br /><br />Subtitles:<br />English SDH, French, Spanish<br /><br />Discs:<br />50GB Blu-ray Disc<br />Digital copy<br />DVD copy<br /><br />I'm a fan of Clint Eastwood, whether he's acting or directing. Hereafter almost tempted me to see it in the theater, but generally negative reviews made me wait for the Blu-ray release. After finally seeing it, I think I know what caused the negativity. That said, it worked on a number of levels for me and met the expectations I had when it was originally announced.<br /><br />So why do some people dislike it?<br /><br />The first reason is the trailer. The use of the tsunami scene and the train accident suggest that the movie will contain plenty of action. It also hints at a fantasy aspect and that viewers will see the afterlife depicted. In reality, these incidents merely set the scene for what the characters are dealing with.<br /><br />Another potential problem is the story structure. Similar to movies such as Babel and Magnolia, Peter Morgan's screenplay introduces strands of a plot which eventually meet. One of these threads frequently uses subtitles as the people involved are French. The pacing is fairly slow and we are allowed to see things gradually develop.<br /><br />The final reason is the resolution of the individual stories. Eastwood allows room for us to speculate what will happen to the characters as they move on with their lives. It's not a traditional Hollywood ending where every loose end is neatly tied up.<br /><br />There are three main stories:<br /><br />Marie (De France), a French news anchor, has a near-death experience in the first six minutes of the movie, but ultimately survives a tsunami. It changes the way she thinks about her life and she can't focus on her job and normal activities. She wants to write a book about the experience.<br /><br />George (Damon), who lives in San Francisco, has psychic ability and used to perform readings. He wants to forget that part of his life and have a normal job. Unfortunately, that's not easy to accomplish. His ability hinders his chances at normal relationships and his brother, Billy (Mohr), encourages him to reconsider his decision to stop giving readings.<br /><br />Marcus and Jason are identical twins who live with their alcoholic mother in London. When Jason is killed after being struck by a car, Marcus has to deal with the loss. His world is crumbling around him and he looks to various psychics to help, but all are shown to be fakes.<br /><br />As the story progresses, it switches more and more rapidly between the three threads. We suspect that the three main characters will eventually meet and interact, but it's not clear how and to what degree. I won't ruin that for you.<br /><br />Death is a complex and thought-provoking subject. What happens when we die? Is there something more? What would you say if you could talk to loved ones you have lost? How much stronger might the feeling of loss be for someone losing an identical twin?<br /><br />Eastwood makes some good choices in this movie. After the opening tsunami sequence, the story is the focus rather than special effects. The casting worked well and the main actors did a terrific job. Damon seemed completely natural in his role and De France also gave a strong performance.<br /><br />Rather than trying to show viewers what the afterlife might look like, Eastwood shows us very little. It's left to our imagination. All that is made clear is that George is having psychic visions and those are handled in brief flashes similar to Christopher Walken's character in The Dead Zone. The story explains what happens to the three characters at a point in their lives and nothing more. Again, the right choice. Any resolution to the three story threads would have felt tacked on and superfluous.<br /><br />Video Quality 4.5/5<br />While the tsunami sequence doesn't look totally convincing - despite the film receiving an Oscar nomination for visual effects - it isn't a fault in the transfer. Some of the cinematography is beautiful and colors appear bright and natural. Detail is strong and this is one of Warner's stronger transfers.<br /><br />Audio Quality 4.5/5<br />The lossless DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 mix doesn't disappoint either. It's at its loudest during the opening tsunami, but background effects all come through clearly and dialogue is perfect. I had to turn the volume up a few decibels more than for most films, but the presentation is even throughout once the appropriate level is selected.<br /><br />Special Features 4/5<br /><br />Step Into the Hereafter: Focus Points (42 minutes, 1080p) - Eastwood and Damon go into more depth about some of the choices made for the film.<br /><br />The Eastwood Factor - Extended Version (128 minutes, 1080p) - A look at Eastwood's career, available in HD for the first time.<br /><br />I completely understand why some reviews were negative. If you're the type of person who enjoys art house films and contemplating your existence, there's a chance you will get something from Hereafter. If you have a problem with slow-pacing, subtitles and unresolved plot threads, pass on this title.<br /><br />It was a pleasant surprise for me and something that I will definitely revisit before too long.<br /><br />Overall score 4.5/5</p></br><a href="../users/A2II09GQGWOMTQ.html">A2II09GQGWOMTQ</a><br/><p>I saw the preview for this when I was watching another movie, I honestly don't remember which but this one looked interesting enough to warrant a rental.<br />The first thing that shocked me was that it was an Eastwood movie.<br />I didn't think this was his sort of thing but he did an excellent job here.<br /><br />Here is what I liked...<br />Excellent performances from the entire cast especially Damon.<br />Beautiful direction.<br />An interesting story.<br />You really have to be interested in the subject of the paranormal to enjoy this movie.<br />Most movies usually make this subject out to be some sort of joke but that is thankfully not the case here.<br />We get three stories that are interwoven and everything wraps up into a neat little package at the end.<br />I have heard other people say this movie was boring and nothing happens.<br />I disagree....nothing happens, everything sort of unfolds...<br />A patient viewer will be rewarded by this movie.<br />If you're expecting a "Bourne" flick, go elsewhere.<br />This is a VERY slowly paced movie, there's not a whole lot of action, just a whole lot of emotion and story which for once is a breath of fresh air.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't like was the ending.<br />I DID NOT want the movie to end that way, I won't give it away but I found the ending to be rather annoying.<br />For a movie with so many loose ends for it to wrap so nicely seemed to contradict the entire movie itself.<br />That minor gripe aside, I found it to be a beautiful movie on a an interesting subject.<br />Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A2KWQ64TRHB3YH.html">A2KWQ64TRHB3YH</a><br/><p>There are essentially three very moving tales in this excellent film. Viewers hoping to learn about what happens to people after death, whether there is something or nothing, will be disappointed, because this is not the film's purpose. The hereafter is a backdrop to the three tales that Clint Eastwood directs and Matt Damon acts in very well.<br /><br />One story is about the character played by Damon. He discovers that he has the ability to see and hear a dead relative of a person who he touches. But he has no idea where the dead person is or what life is like after death. He is traumatized by this ability. He feels that it is a curse rather than a blessing. He realizes that his ability helps others and makes them feel good, but he feels that it ruins his own life. He wants to live like other people. He doesn't even want others to know about his ability. We see an episode where he is virtually compelled to use his ability and the effect that it has on him. He is searching for a normal life and we watch to see if it is attainable.<br /><br />The second story, which, as the third, ultimately entwines in Damon's story, is about a highly successful French female reporter who is pronounced dead after being drowned in a tsunami. She experiences the well-known phenomenon of a person seeing a white light and moving towards the light. However, she recovers. She has difficulty getting over what she has seen and it affects her life.<br /><br />The third tale is about two male pre-teen young twins. They are unusually close; very loving toward each other. This is especially so because their mother, who they love dearly is an alcoholic and uses drugs. One of the twins is killed when a truck hits him, and the other mourns him greatly. He searches for someone to help him communicate with his brother.</p></br><a href="../users/AUM3YMZ0YRJE0.html">AUM3YMZ0YRJE0</a><br/><p>I am not usually one for fantasy films about psychics and the afterlife, but this one has such depth  that I could suspend my disbelief and feel completely engrossed in the emotions of the characters.  I have never seen acting so fine and vivid in this genre.  It is moving, beautiful, mysterious, and psychologically real.  I think it is a masterpiece.<br /><br />The film starts with the 2004 tsunami that devastated Indonesia.  A French woman is swept up in the wave, receiving a terrible blow in the head that brings her near death while submerged.  What she sees changes her life, alienating her from her past and its certainties.  She loses everything.  Meanwhile, we learn about a young man from San Francisco, a psychic who is searching desperately for a way to live and love with his "ability".  Every time he sees a potential relationship, it seems, his ability destroys his chances.  He is not helped by his brother, who is pushing to exploit his ability as a business concern.  The third character is a boy, whose mother is a junkie and who loses someone near to him.  He is pitifully depressed and seeking answers while in fostercare.<br /><br />How their lives intersect is the plot of the story.  However, the theme - of being able to move on with one's life - is wonderfully evoked by Eastwood, who is one of the greatest filmmakers alive.  Every gesture and expression of the 3 characters moved me, their struggle and melancholy totally believable, at least to me, as they search for resolution and a way forward.  It brought tears to my eyes, perhaps because I lost my father not too long ago.  The film actually helped me to mourn.<br /><br />Warmly recommended.  I know it isn't for everyone, but it sure worked for me.</p></br><a href="../users/A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z.html">A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z</a><br/><p>Any Clint Eastwood film is going to be masterfully crafted.So, the content is what one may like or dislike, but rarely is the film a bad product. And this film has a great story, and a superb craftsmanship. With, to my surprise, the main music being done by Clint, and in the extras, you can see some of the theme music being played by clint.<br />  Given its unique material, the first film I thought was similar to it was AFTERLIFE; with the caveat that AFTERLIFE is a first film, and so is not as refined as the material, and the execution of this film. HEREAFTER delivers a quality supernatural undertone without this wonderfully chilling element subsuming the character driven content of Clint's film. The way the story weaves together three people's lives and eventually brings the two leads together, is both brilliant on the film level, and emotionally fulfilling on the personal level. The dramatic tones are a superb experience on the heavier side ( the supernatural elements) as well as the themes of loss relating to the young British actor, and the French actress who visits a character who is remarkably like Dr Elizabeth Kubler-Ross ( in some respects, not all). For AFTERLIFE, and HEREAFTER, my comment for the AFTERLIFE review was that the coment "get a life" applies; well, Afterlife achieves this in a heavy handed way, and HEREAFTER achieves this in a dramatically fulfilling way, with a style few people can manage. Also, the extras on the DVD are great, they shows elements that I would suggest you don't watch until after seeing the film, since the they show how the strong and very realistic images are achieved.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood has done another great piece, very strong on many levels, and whilst it achieves the surreal elements I prefer, it also gives the heart ache of the personal experience in its sadest times.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>Clint Eastwood is always throwing his films in the crowd of onlookers as if it were a bomb or a good uppercut or some kind of blackmailing session of arm twisting. And this Hereafter trip into dead territory and death's kingdom is one more provocation right in our faces.<br /><br />What is there beyond death? A beyond or hereafter that no one knows except a few who have been able to come back but who are regarded by people as some kind of zombies or crazy ranting and raving extra-terrestrials. He takes a little of Dead Zone by Stephen King and he turns his film into a journey across the world from San Francisco to London and Paris where we meet three exceptional beings. A twin brother who has lost his twin in some ugly road accident. A TV anchorwoman who has died in a tsunami and managed to come back. And a medium who suffered some health problem in his youth and died a couple of times or more on the operating table.<br /><br />The whole film will aim at bringing the three together one way or another and make them discover there is something, even some life beyond those deadly and fatal events. At the same time he settles some long deserved accounts with a few people, among others French publishers who are as frigid as for publishing kinky things as old spinsters who have dedicated their whole lives to looking at the tip of their shoes. Jean Yves Berteloot in that role is cruel and so realistic that he is truer than truth itself. And we can think of absolutely all French publishers as being some rancid loveless and heartless old crumbs lost under a pile of rotting wood.<br /><br />But the film is also a good fist blow right into the noses of the audience. Terrifying pictures of a tsunami, we used to say tidal wave in the old days, all the more frightening because of the recent Japanese tsunami. Horrifying pictures of death: death in the hands of that natural cataclysm; death in the hands of an underground catastrophe in London; death in the hands of some bullies against a younger child causing his deadly fate in the middle of the street; death in the hands of heroin, the famous horse that stampedes and gallops more often and longer than we can imagine.<br /><br />And yet Clint Eastwood wants us to believe there is some bright side in that story. The medium who cannot have a normal life since he can't touch anyone without being transported into their hereafter and there-before, will be saved by love. The forlorn twin will find solace in his own dead brother who will know more about life than the living now he is dead. The TV anchorwoman who will find love and hope in someone who can see beyond the surface. Even the horrid horse will find its master in the hands of some good doctors.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood's realism is the main power and force in this film. He whips you around with pictures so true that they become divine with truth and life together. And you better say thank you to the old man who is there to show the future in the past and the present in the visionary ranting and raving of the insane, and we are all insane somewhere, so we are all aware of the present, the past and the future, but 99.99% of these people are 200% sure death is the final end of life. Well, I am ready to bet it is not, though when I know I won't be able to cash my bet.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU</p></br><a href="../users/A3NH7PYU4AD5GA.html">A3NH7PYU4AD5GA</a><br/><p>I am normally not interested in stories about spirits and the departed, nor can I find the conviction to attach importance to the reports that we receive sometimes about 'near death' experiences, which are often claimed to have been post-death experiences, by people who came back to life.<br />I gave this film a chance, because it is 'made' by Eastwood and it stars Matt Damon. That, I thought, would at least guarantee that it is not outright stupid. It isn't.<br />Actually, once you start with the beginning and the South East Asian tsunami pulls you in, and the heartbreaking story of the London twin boys with their addict single mother, it is hard to walk out, though Damon's part (the psychic)tries hard to demotivate me.<br />We have three threads in Paris, London, and San Francisco leading to a unified ending via a London book fair. Whatever the realities behind the ghost world, Clint tells the story well. The hereafter might very well be a genuine concern of his, as it probably is for many of us. I can't quite manage to be convinced that the so-called near-death experience is what it is claimed to be.</p></br><a href="../users/AJRFZ0VZ0LD26.html">AJRFZ0VZ0LD26</a><br/><p>When certain generations think of Clint Eastwood, they think of his acting career.  But this remarkable man has earned his best credentials later on in his live, once he assumed his place behind the camera.  Many actors turn to creating their own production companies and directing movies, but none has done it with so much success as Clint Eastwood (and occasionally, Robert Redford). Every single movie that was directed by Clint Eastwood created some form of stir.  Here comes a man who is not afraid to ask difficult questions about difficult (and different) experiences in ordinary people's lives.  He is not afraid to challange his viewers and does not back down from his ideas, not matter how difficult they may be on the audiences.<br /><br />In this film there are three parallel stories: one is a sotry about successfull Parisian journalist who escapes death, another one is about a young London boy who looses his twin brother to death while his mother ends up in the rehabilitation center, he is sent off to the foster care.  And there is a blue collar worker in NYC who has psychic ability to speak with dead that haunts his personal and professional life.  Each one of them is struggling with their experiences that other people do not seem to understand. They are outcasts in a society that is so quick in labeling people.  Until one brief moment, when lives of these three people intersect and change their destinies from that moment on to hereafter.<br /><br />Although propbably not as powerful as some of his earlier films, this is still a wonderful story and a great message from Clint Eastwood to his audiences that keeps growing and growing with every story he has to tell...</p></br><a href="../users/A14Q6R4481YFFG.html">A14Q6R4481YFFG</a><br/><p>Hollywood may be irreligious and non-religious, but irreligious and non-religious people think about death too, and it's interesting to see their take on it.  I can't think of a single film that been a failure in exploring the undiscovered country.  "Ghost" was incredibly good, and even a movie like "Flatliners" was worth the price of admission.  I would put this one somewhere in between those two.  As far as the movie itself, it was well written and well directed, believably acted and of solid quality.<br /><br />I do wish that we had a chance to listen to George's letter to Marie at the end of the movie.  My viewing companion and I agree that it included something along the lines of: SPOILER ALERT "The girl you tried to hold on to and save wanted to say thank you."  But that is something only Peter Morgan would be able to confirm.</p></br><a href="../users/A24IJY3V0804WJ.html">A24IJY3V0804WJ</a><br/><p>Clint Eastwood is certainly one of the most iconic people on this planet. As a actor he has has had some memorable roles and lines, as an director he is in a class by himself. Most of his films that he has directed have repeat viewing value and some have become classics. At an age where most people could barely walk, to have such a prolific directorial flourish is simply amazing. His latest work ` Hereafter' is abut death, tragedy, the effect it has some people and their attempts to cope with it, thus continuing his obsession with death. Three divergent story lines across three different continents are merged together in a ending.<br />Marie ( Cecile De France) survives a tsunami but finds that he life is falling around her. She is unable to cope with her relationships, her work and life when she returns home after this tragedy. George Lonegan ( Matt Damon) is a psychic who forsakes fame and riches he could have had as a psychic when he realizes that his gift is more like a curse and prefers to lives in near obscurity. Finally there are Marcus and Jason who are struggling with their mother's alcoholism and are struck with a life altering event.<br />The segment of Marcus and Jason was the most touching, and warms your heart to feel this brotherly love. The other segments are fine and well acted. The Tsunami scene is the great and probably the most fast paced in the entire movie. A common grouse amongst the viewers of this movie is the slow pacing but I felt that was necessary and keeping up with the theme of the movie. The tone of the photography is extremely muted and brightens up only towards the end. The actors are great and Matt Damon slips effortlessly in to his role as a psychic, the kids Marcus and Jason are incredible as well. This may not be Eastwood's most accomplished work but also not his weakest either. Four stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HW33PQSRHLNO.html">A2HW33PQSRHLNO</a><br/><p>While one can't help but be surprised--even now--that Clint Eastwood had anything to do with this particular film (Harry Callahan is most definitely a thing of the past), he does an excellent job teaming up with Peter Morgan for this pleasant oddity which manages to transform Bahhhstan actor Matt Damon <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305216088">Good Will Hunting (Miramax Collector's Series)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M341QE">The Departed (Widescreen Edition)</a> into a reclusive psychic (a real one) and a lover of Charles Dickens.<br /><br />Damon's character George Lonegan, a man who works on the docks of a shipping yard while possessing the ability to contact the dead, is a strange guy who no longer wants anything to do with the John Edwards' or Uri Gellers' of the world.  Once a professional psychic making tons of money, he now wants only to live a quiet life apart from the hereafter and in the now. The problem is that every time he touches someone, their past is revealed in a kind of watery cinematography that Eastwood clearly favors over the stereotypical "flashback telepathic vision" scenario.<br /><br />His brother Billy (Jay Mohr) is a man who rightly or wrongly feels differently and wants George to return to the I See Dead People Business.  Not only, he reasons, might this garner some cash--his brother is the real deal and in one of the most affecting scenes in the film, Lonegan gives a private reading to his a co-worker of his brothers' coming directly from his deceased wife.<br /><br />Cecile De France plays Marie LeLay, a famous French newscaster who is happy, famous, beautiful and all until she has a sudden vision of a tsunami while on vacation with her agent.  What exactly she sees may be open to the interpretation of the viewer: her own death?  The apocalypse?<br /><br />Because of two chance encouters--what makes this film touching and believable is that it adds an all too human dimension to the otherworldly subject by portraying quite worldly concerns, perhaps the most memorable of which concerns two small London boys with a heroin addicted mother--LeLay and Lonegan are brought together.  What happens at the end is certainly left open to the viewer's interpretation, though something big is definitely about to occur both in the metaphysical and worldly sense for the two protagonists.<br /><br />This is a film which stands on it's own merits stylistically but also delivers a message that needs to be sent: that those who quest for the afterlife, for the ultimate, are not to be laughed or sneered at.  Have we come so far that we can no longer believe in anything but the material world?  Why, then, do we watch people running around on television with glow lights and EVP monitors?  A brilliant movie and a must see.</p></br><a href="../users/A18HHKM6WGEF9D.html">A18HHKM6WGEF9D</a><br/><p>I have been trying to figure out why this film got so many bad reviews, and I think it really just comes down to subject matter. One of the characters in the movie is a journalist who has a near-death experience in the Indonesian tsunami, and then starts to probe research on near-death experiences, and comes to believe there is a conspiracy against the material getting out. I don't know if there's a conspiracy, but certainly very few people really want to contemplate death in the way this film does. It is not light and fluffy. And although it does posit the idea that there is something more for us after death, it doesn't offer an idea of what that might be. In other words, it refuses to give us a superficial, heart-warming, or comforting dogma to take home with us. It probes people's experiences with death and the other side, including in the form of a reluctant psychic played by Matt Damon, and it probes human suffering, but it doesn't necessarily give us a dimestore happy ending.<br /><br />I have to admit, after the first 20 minutes or so of the film, I wasn't sure I wanted to go on. It is sad, the characters suffer, and they are sad. But I'm so glad I continued to watch, because there is a richness and truth to what they go through, and the individual seeking they each embark upon, which brings them all together in a beautiful way in the end. I also felt the performances and special effects were all excellent.<br /><br />So no, it is not your typical feel-good movie, nor even your typical paranormal sci-fi type movie. It is a spiritual human drama, and if you are willing to stick with it, I think it is well worth the journey it takes you on.</p></br><a href="../users/A12IRGQLFE4EBA.html">A12IRGQLFE4EBA</a><br/><p>I really enjoyed this film.  Another fine directing job by Clint Eastwood and executively produced by Stephen Spielberg... these guys do not make junk (lol).  I gave "Hereafter" 4 stars instead of 5 because I would have appreciated a bit more weight to the film, but overall it was well acted, interesting and beautifully done.  A gentle view of what might be.<br /><br />4.5 stars!</p></br><a href="../users/A2OFSDJB3MVQ16.html">A2OFSDJB3MVQ16</a><br/><p>I guess many people were bewildered and perplexed when this film came out because I think they were expecting an action film or suspense since Eastwood is the director.  But one thing one can expect from this renowned director is the unexpected!!  I've seen this film twice in a theater and plan to view again on Blu-ray, it's a thought provoking drama of a dimension we rarely experience but does exist--the afterlife!!  Matt Damon and Cecile DeFrance are excellent in their roles as a psychic and a survivor who experiences the after-life.  Along with "Inception", this is one of the most original films from a well respected director--and it accomplishes what it set out to do--and this is to make us think!!  Perhaps years from now it will be held in higher regard as witness Hitchcock's "Vertigo" and "Marnie".  Kudos to Clint for bringing this subject to the screen.</p></br><a href="../users/ALLIGF5OZM1I6.html">ALLIGF5OZM1I6</a><br/><p>HEREAFTER<br /><br />STARRING: Matt Damon, Cecile De France, Frankie McLaren, George McLaren, Jay Mohr, Bryce Dallas Howard and Richard Kind<br /><br />WRITTEN BY: Peter Morgan<br /><br />DIRECTED BY: Clint Eastwood<br /><br />Rated: PG - 13<br />Genre: Drama<br />Release Date: 22 October 2010<br />Review Date: 09 November 2010<br /><br />It's amazing how much Matt Damon and Clint Eastwood give us out of so little, in Hereafter. Eastwood directs Damon for the second time, this time as a psychic named George who can communicate with the loved ones you've lost, just by touching you. The reason I say they give us so much out of so little, is because we never see anything other than Damon's flawless acting.<br /><br />George touches your hands and can instantly sense who has passed in your life and can relay their message to you. What makes Hereafter so likeable is that we believe George can do this, from Damon's performance alone. He's not a quack, he doesn't have an ego about his gift and he's just so terribly convincing that even if we didn't know his as Matt Damon, we'd still find him convincing.<br /><br />And saying he doesn't have an ego about it is an understatement by the way. George hates his so called gift and would sooner refer to it as a curse. His talent has left him in a world of bitter and cold isolation and he's fed up with it. We learn that he once made quite a name for himself and a respectable living but has long since given up on all that and taken a mediocre paying job just to get by.<br /><br />The story isn't only about Damon's character George, but it largely is, and it's the one I found the most enjoyable out of the three that are shown to us.<br /><br />We also meet a lovely French woman named Marie, played by Cecile De France, who has had a near death experience and witnessed a small taste of an afterlife. It should be noted that we will be seeing more of this gifted actress in films to come.<br /><br />The third story is of a set of young twins who do anything and everything together and for one another, until a brutal accident changes their lives forever.<br /><br />We cut back and forth between the three stories, realizing that eventually they will come to a head. They do, and it's marvelously done.<br /><br />But let's go back to the George story. Jay Mohr plays George's brother and is so adamant that George should give his talent a second chance in order to help others - that George just might. In the meantime, he has been taking a cooking class at night and has met the woman of his dreams there: Melanie, played by Bryce Dallas Howard - who by the way had better be the next MJ, in the upcoming Spider-Man reboot. She's perfect for it.<br /><br />These two, meaning Damon and Howard, together in a scene, was simply electrifying. They acted and Eastwood directed them, in some of the best romantic scenes that I have ever seen in a film. It was brilliant because they are both experienced adults, but George has been out of the game for so long that it's almost like high school again for him, and for us watching them. They both want each other, but don't seem too keen at first, as to if the feeling is a mutual one.<br /><br />The scene with the blindfold is a pristine blend of eroticism, romance and temptation, and is directed beautifully by Clint Eastwood. In addition to the acting and the directing, I just really liked the idea of two people falling for one another as partners in a nightly cooking class. Because I was so invested in these moments, I was absolutely riveted with anger at what happens between the two of them, that it nearly split me in two; even though I saw it coming from a mile away.<br /><br />But the movie goes on, and it remains good and ends as originally as it opened. It makes us think, it stimulates us and it entertains us. You should know that it is very slow however, and you need to be ready for that when you sit down to watch it. But if you invest the time and the proper amount of attention, you will not be disappointed. And this is important subject matter folks. If you haven't given thought to what your hereafter holds in store for you -perhaps you should.</p></br><a href="../users/A356RFKNIG043B.html">A356RFKNIG043B</a><br/><p>Despite a great cast, intelligent script and interesting concept.<br />Despite a master of concision at the helm (after seeing this and J. Edgar, perhaps former master).<br />Despite a subject I'm fascinated with.<br />Despite these and many other potential positives, Hereafter is just toooooo daaaarrrnnnn slooooowwwww. I could barely stay awake, and it was the afternoon.<br />Thought it was my fault. Rented it months later. Identical response.<br />Looks good, feels pretty real, everybody clearly put their heart into it, but it just didn't click for me.<br />More than once I wondered if this is what limbo feels like.<br />Perhaps that's the point. But that's not a feeling I usually seek when watching movies, and when it is Ingmar awaits.<br />If you love Clint and Matt and the subject, this might do it for you.<br />But I love all three, and no go.<br />Well made nonetheless, perhaps Hereafter was just made for a different mind than mine.</p></br><a href="../users/A34GZPHWYPSY2T.html">A34GZPHWYPSY2T</a><br/><p>HEREAFTER (dir. Clint Eastwood, prod. Steven Spielberg, 2010, in English and French) is a riveting yet meditative, profound crossroads of several stories. A retired San Franciscan psychic who's fed up communicating with the dead (Matt Damon) needs time for himself. A struggling young English single mother and her twin boys (Lyndsey Marshal, Frankie and George McLaren) enter a new realm of suffering. A traumatized French anchorwoman (the stunning C&eacute;cile De France) needs to get her newly learned message to the world, and in the process loses her boyfriend (an equally gorgeous Thierry Neuvic).<br /><br />To begin, I have to hand it Eastwood, I really do. I consider myself not only a connoisseur of his work from The Man With No Name to Dirty Harry; I'm also one of his biggest admirers when he wears his director's hat. This film made me weep, several times. It made me gasp and scream in dismay, it made me feel deeply. Not an easy task with a PG-13 rating, no swearing, no real violence and nothing creepy in spite of the life-after-death motif.<br /><br />Eastwood presents a true director's masterpiece, relying on CGI only because he couldn't otherwise get what he needed in a major scene (being in the middle of a tsunami wave, an integral part of the story, will leave you and countless generations hereafter breathless). Otherwise, this film is in the quiet, grand style, the Old School, of fine filmmaking.<br /><br />Each character's woes and tribulations will culminate in a meeting at the London Book Fair - and need I say this has a bittersweet, totally satisfying ending? Typical Eastwood, who gives us cinematic banquets. He's best at first courses and desserts! - I think any film connoisseur will tell you, that is all you need for a great story. Even the hilarious dalliance into the world of fraudulent mediums (aren't they all?) is a treat.<br /><br />If I may criticize only two typical Eastwood elements here: the excessively slow pace and the music. Such a film needs no great pace, but at two hours it can make one a bit sleepy. The music, well, jazz acoustic guitar has a time/place - Eastwood doesn't seem to understand that very well. But Eastwood is in no hurry with this, he directs his stars to perfection and he absolutely loves the details. He wants us to love them, too, which we cannot help but to love along with him.<br /><br />The film is sweetened with little cameos by Derek Jacobi, Steve Schirripa and Bryce Dallas Howard; it is also beautifully spiced with locations at San Francisco, London and Paris. I might even say Google makes a rather prominent appearance and is integral to the slowly merging story lines. Setting aside my banquet analogy, Eastwood simultaneously makes his films the way top of the line perfumes are constructed.<br /><br />I know Eastwood wanted this to be along the lines of similar French films, but he need not have turned to that influence at all. At present I'd say films everywhere are being influenced by Eastwood's directing.<br /><br />You cannot miss this film, one of Eastwood's sleeper-classics. It scored no huge points, was paid little attention, and I wonder who else has really reviewed it. All I can conclude is to advise you not to miss it - it's well worth the investment of emotions, even if you don't believe in or care a fig about any HEREAFTER.<br /><br />Eastwood's HEREAFTER is all you'll ever need.</p></br></body></html>

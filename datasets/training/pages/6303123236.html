The animation here is simply beautiful, even by today's standards, and this is all the more impressive when you take into account the year this was made, 1937. Even better, it is now digitally restored for it's latest release. This is a wonderful fairytale that is full of charm, none of which has diminished over time. This has the delightful dwarf characters and each one adds something unique to the film, of course Dopey is the most hilarious and the one that had me laughing out loud regularly. These dwarfs have now become representative of Disney's early art and are still seen around the parks and on advertising even today. This film has a dark edge to the story that is lacking from the saccharine modern Disney films and this darkness compliments and highlights the light in the rest of the film and in my opinion it is all the better for it. There are nice animated touches throughout, like the detailed carvings in the dwarf house and the forest animals expressions and actions and show the attention to detail Disney brought to his films. This package includes various extras and games, most of which are aimed at kids, but there is a commentary by Walt Disney that is fascinating and of interest to an adult audience. All in all this is classic and beautiful film and well worth adding to your Disney collection.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></br><a href="../users/ADLVFFE4VBT8.html">ADLVFFE4VBT8</a><br/><p>The Blu-ray release of the Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is one of the slickest releases in Blu-ray history so far. It excels on every count: packaging, visual and audio presentation, the amount and depth of extra features and and all of the above at a retail price below most much less ambitious Blu-ray titles.<br /><br />I will briefly justify why I believe that this is a 'must have' 5-star for anyone who who watches or has kids who watch Disney animations.<br /><br />PACKAGING<br /><br />Once you remove the 3-D sleeve, the solid plastic (unlike the more recent 'cheap' Blu releases, this case does not have holes punched in it to save a penny or 2) you will find a Blu-ray guide attached to the inside front cover. The 'navigational overview' tree of the 2 Blu-ray disks is actually needed do to the almost baroque layout of features with some, such as the Hyperion Studios extra found on the Bonus disk with dozens of subfeatures within the feature. The inside cover itself lists the 27 movie 'scenes'.<br /><br />There are 3 disks:<br /><br />- The Feature Disk has the 84-minute movie plus a host of extra features.<br />- The Bonus Disk has even more extras including the already mentioned 'Hyperion Studios'.<br />- The DVD Feature Disk has the full movie once again.<br /><br />VISUAL AND AUDIO PRESENTATION<br /><br />Obviously, the original is greatly cleaned and enhanced to take advantage of Blu's 1080p superior resolution but that's not all.<br /><br />The optional DisneyView mode would make watching more enjoyable by filling the right and left side bars (the original is in a 3x4 format) with a static filler that changes with each scene matching the scene's own background, creating the impression that one is watching a 'wide screen' movie.<br /><br />Most of the extras are shot in uncompromising 1080p resolution.<br /><br />The highest audio resolution is 7.1 DTS HD Master Audio with 5.1 surround available for French and Spanish. The original soundtrack is also included for reference.<br /><br />An audio commentary track is available on the Feature Disk.<br /><br />EXTRA FEATURES<br /><br />They run the whole gamut. The Feature Disk has the expected and inevitable - but in this case with a twist - 'deleted scenes', several 'remote control games', a music video of 'Some Day My Prince Will Come' and a 'Princess and the Frog' sneak peak.<br /><br />The Bonus Disk has two main section.<br /><br />There's the 'Classic bonus features' that has content we would normally expect on a bonus disk - Heigh-Ho Karaoke sing-along, Dopey's Wild Mine Ride, Disney Through the Decades, Animation Voice Talent.<br /><br />And then there's the absolutely amazing Hyperion Studios feature. It must be the most innovative 'bonus' making this purchase worth it for anyone who may already have the movie on DVD. Architected more or less like a hypertext document, it allows the viewer to freely jump in and out featurettes dealing with the history of Disney, the animators, the making of various aspects of the movie, the cultural impact of Snow White and of Disney. And the above are put together with historians and some of the original animators talking, original story boards, full-length, uncut Disney 'shorts', reconstructed and re-enacted Walt Disney and animators commentary to specific scenes and their thoughts and views as the scenes were developed... like I said, simply amazing if you add the never-before-used interface and you consider the extra-crisp quality of the entire presentation.<br /><br />MY CONCLUSION<br /><br />I already stated it in the second paragraph of this review: if you are into animation and Disney, get it without hesitation. It's a steal.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RHV42BTJSVON.html">A2RHV42BTJSVON</a><br/><p>Although "Snow white" has never been a personal favorite of mine, I cannot deny its charm or its influence on animated films in general.  The last time I watched "Snow White" it was when I was about 15yrs on my mom's old VHS copy, that was 9yrs ago, and I fell asleep half-way through it. However, considering "Snow White's" universal praise, I figured there must be something wrong with me, so I decided to watching it once again and see if it held my interest or not.<br /><br />  For me, this movie still remains an oddity, for me it is dated in its feel a lot more than any other major Disney Film, and yet it still holds great treasures and beauty in it.  The animation at first look seems to be extremely dates and grainy, but when taking a closer look, I realized the grainy aged look of the backgrounds were intentional.  Much like the artwork in "Sleeping Beauty" is fashioned after renaissance paintings, so "Snow White" is fashioned after paintings, in this case water color paintings.  The back drops have the distinct grainy look of water colors on water colors paper.  When I realized this, I began to appreciate this movie a great deal more because I now could see how much work really went in to the animation.  The rest of the animation for the most part looks like standard 1930's animation in its style, and especially in the movement of the animals resembles many cartoons of the times, but it rises far above those cartoons to become a cultural icon.<br /><br />  As for the story, it is very simple and follows for the most part, the traditional folk tale of Snow White (with some obvious changes).  Instead of trying to expand too much on the story and create a heavy drama, rather a sweet story of first love reminiscent of many other movies of the era is penned.  The pacing is quite slow even though the movie itself is only 78minutes and I am sure this is what made me fall asleep before and why it still at times fails to hold my attention; it is due to the slower pacing on of the 1930's and is not s fault of the writers I feel, if anything its a testament to the short attention spans of today.  The characters are little more than stock characters, but they are created in such a fun way that it almost feels like they originated from this movie.<br /><br />  The music and singing in the movie is very much a product of its time, but this adds to the charm of the film.  Every time I hear Snow White sing I am reminded of many other 1930's films and shows I've watched, and how the art of true singing has died away and given way to the popular belting/yelling technique.  The singing here is georgeous and the music is catchy and delightful!  Making things that could be mundane such as cleaning, washing faces, and working in to fun and memorable musical sequences!<br /><br />  The story, animation, and music work together to create a movie that will no doubt be loved until the end of the world, and this transfer does it great justice.  I did not have the opportunity to purchase the previous Platinum edition on DVD, and had only seen it ever on VHS, so this transfer on Blu-ray really allowed me to see its true quality as an animated movie.  The more I watch it the better and richer it gets, its astonishing and the clarity of the transfer and touch-ups is perfect!<br /><br />  I am not really one for extras on DVD and Blu-Ray, I generally just watch the movie, but there are some fun extras on here such as a fun gem game, deleted scenes that include the cut "Soup" scene, what was the possible sequel to "Snow White" and a lot more I haven't even gotten to yet.<br /><br />  If you're wondering if this is worth the money, I give it a resounding YES!  Take it from the girl who went went from Sleepy to Happy when it comes to how they feel about Snow White.<br /><br />  God Bless ~Amy</p></br><a href="../users/A28OB1QLXN5BM6.html">A28OB1QLXN5BM6</a><br/><p>A few evenings ago, I had the great pleasure of introducing my four year old daughter to Walt Disney's SNOW WHITE.  Let me tell you, SNOW WHITE is still a true classic - beautiful, charming, and quite amazing even all these years later.  And the joy of sharing it with my wee one made it even more special.<br /><br />I don't think that I have seen SNOW WHITE in probably close to 40 years.  While I remember the basic story - who doesn't? - there are many snippets and scenes that I had forgotten.  Watching this latest, lovely version with my daughter snuggled in my lap, the forgotten scenes and songs came flooding back, and my daughter and I found ourselves singing along together.  The music of SNOW WHITE clearly crosses the generations with ease.  Old favorites, such "Some Day My Prince Will Come" and "Heigh Ho," sail across the years and are as fun and memorable as ever.  My little princess was entranced by this film, and, I have to admit, so was I.<br /><br />It is astonishing to realize that SNOW WHITE was released in 1937, and that it was Disney's first full length animated feature film.  The story, the art, the animation, and the music have all stood the test of time, and still rank near the top with the best of the Disney films.  This latest version is bright and sharp; quite simply, it is exquisite.<br /><br />Everyone born after 1937 was basically raised on SNOW WHITE.  I am so glad that Disney has rereleased it for yet another generation.  I can just picture great-grandmothers, grandmothers, mothers, aunts, daughters, and sisters all sitting down together to watch this movie, introducing it to the latest little princess in the family.  And that, most certainly, is the true definition of a classic family film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1534MBU6VJXYN.html">A1534MBU6VJXYN</a><br/><p>The most important movie in Disney history, this 1937 gem has gotten a superb dvd treatment. Words cannot describe how flawless this dvd is. It is the best treatment I have ever seen on any dvd. I will not bore you with plot details, as everybody knows what this film is all about. I will say, however, that the film looks and sounds great. They also loaded it with extras. Dozens of documentaries, interviews and much more are littered throughout this magical I wish I could say more, but my praise for this dvd cannot be expressed in mere words. In order to see what I mean, you have to buy the dvd for yourself and see how great it is. And of course, watch the film, too. It remains a classic.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TOH8S8I1VT9R.html">A1TOH8S8I1VT9R</a><br/><p>I just bought this film.  It is becoming increasingly difficult to find (check out my review date).  For anyone collecting Disney animated features; GRAB IT NOW!!<br />  What can I say about the film that hasn't been said.  Despite its' age (The first successful animated feature)it has some of my favorite Disney animated moments.  This film carries with it a sense of real innocence and purity of story that has not been acheived since.  Here is a list of what I liked about this DVD and Film;<br /><br />THE FILM<br /><br />-Again, purity and innocence of story.<br />-Dance sequence in dwarfs cottage, one of the most joyful in film history.<br />-Dwarfs mourning over the Princess, one of the most heart-wrenching in film history.<br />-As benign as the Princess is, she has moments of incredible charm and like-ability; "YOU must be GRUMPY" hits the nail on the head!!<br />-Wicked Queen starts the Disney tradition of villains with a bang.  She's so mean and crazy she taunts skeletons in her dungeon; "..WANT A DRINK!?".<br /><br />-Artwork is dated... ...and icredibly charming. The colors used are breathtaking.<br />-Songs are timeless.<br /><br />THE DVD<br />-Quality of picture and sound as good as can be expected for the time of original production.  You really must nit-pick to find a flaw.<br />-Extras are overwhelming!!<br />-Dopey's mine ride is a cute little game.<br />-Deleted scenes a real treat.  One of them actually fully colored with backgrounds.  "Musical Soup" is hillarious!<br />-"The Goddess of Spring" short film is very interesting.  It's use as a "test" for the Snow White concept is obvious.  Some good chuckles for it's crude execution.<br />-The worst thing with this DVD is how difficult it is removing the disks from their hubs.<br />-I wish Wide Screen existed when Disney made this film, just imagine....<br /><br />Why the first Successful animated feature?  There were other(s?) made before Snow White, including Max Fliechers "Gullivers Travels" which rushed production to get to theaters ahead of Disney.  However, no previous attempt captivated audiences minds, hearts and money like "Snow White".  "Snow White" validated the financial side of making an animated feature.<br /><br />Regrettably, I've owned this DVD for 24 hours so I have not had the time to view all of it.  However, it's safe to say that I love it so far!  I'm not an "easy" critic for what that's worth. I know this is a pricey DVD even by Disney standards.  But consider that my collection of 200 DVDs has an average price of $11 and I do not regret this purchase for one minute!!!  A MUST HAVE!!!<br /><br />Addition 1-29-2008<br /><br />This is tentatively schedule for re-release in October of 2009.</p></br><a href="../users/AD9WTAOAFUZA4.html">AD9WTAOAFUZA4</a><br/><p>As wonderful as &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; still is - decades after its theatrical release, younger audiences may find its animation flat and uninspired.  Blame DISNEY itself for that, since in the past 20 years, the studio has released equally timeless tales that far exceed this film's technical qualities.  Nowhere here will you find the depth and 3-dimensional elements of &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; or the sheer grandeur of &quot;The Lion King.&quot;  And, SNow White's operatic vocal inflections can be grating at times, I admit.  Still - this is pure Disney magic, sure to be enjoyed for decades to come!</p></br><a href="../users/ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV.html">ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV</a><br/><p>DVD extras are all very well, but they are meaningless without the movie itself--and here Disney's remastered, restored, and digitalized SNOW WHITE lives up to every bit of the press it has received.  Even now, some seventy years after it was first seen, this simple version of the famous Grimm fairy-tale can still cast a spell through storytelling pure and simple.  And the DVD formatted film is astonishingly beautiful--brilliantly colored--incredibly clear--so beautiful that no matter how often you may have seen the film in the past you will feel that you now see it for the first time.<p>The extras are enough to fill out a second disk and include everything from background art to timelines to trivia games.  Some of it is very interesting indeed; some of it I found rather tedious.  But... so what?  The important thing, the thing you're actually buying the DVD for, is SNOW WHITE, right? And with this DVD release, she remains the fairest in the land.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>It's so wonderful to live in a time when Disney's strange behavior of taking their classics off the market can be circumvented by great Internet marketers like Amazon. I was able to buy this 5 Star Disney Princess classic recently for my young princess through one of Amazon's third-party sellers. And without that opportunity, my little princess may have outgrown Snow White by the time Disney released it again.<br /><br />Let me just say that my little one was absolutely captivated by Snow White, and to think that she would be deprived by Disney itself from seeing it at her perfect age is criminal.<br /><br />The story is familiar enough to any parent, so I won't go on about that other than to say that of all the Disney Princess classics, Snow White and Sleeping Beauty have some scenes that might scare a young princess under the age of 5.<br /><br />But you should take advantage of purchasing Snow White or any of the other "off-the-market" Disney princess classics like Beauty and the Beast now via one of this site's resellers if you have a little princess of your own that might not appreciate it as much when Disney decides that it's time.<br /><br />And indeed, you will enjoy Snow White or any of the other Princess classics as thoroughly as your young one.<br /><br />Side Note on Resellers: Beware of exorbitant reseller prices; renting may be a better option if available. Also beware of REGION 2 resales; Region 2 DVDs will not play in most US DVD players. Look for Region 1 US Amazon resellers.</p></br><a href="../users/A2F8R40Z2OMIJM.html">A2F8R40Z2OMIJM</a><br/><p>I was extremely excited to receive this DVD....  Upon opening it, one gets the feeling that it is truly a special edition.  The packaging is very nice: the DVD box is sturdy with two openings for each disk.  The pamphlet inside the DVD is gorgeously produced and very helpful.<p>My first impression is that Disney has spent much time making this DVD user-friendly.  There is an abundance of directions and drawings showing you what is on the disk and how to get there.  Since there are two disks and a KINGDOM of information to pour through, these directions are very welcome (even to this seasoned DVD-viewer!)<p>Disney pulls out some familiar faces to make the experience as warm as possible:  Disney himself appears in various footage; Angela Lansbury narrates the documentary and provides a &quot;tour&quot; of the disks; Michael Eisner shows up; and Barbra Streisand sings a specially recorded version of &quot;Some Day My Prince Will Come&quot;.<p>SNOW WHITE, the movie, looks gorgeous and, although old fashioned, is quite wonderful.  SNOW WHITE, the double-disk, is a lot of information to wade through.  I am amazed at the amount of behind-the-scenes film that exists!  Disney must have suspected that he was creating a classic - he filmed every aspect of it!  I especially enjoy the HALL OF ART section.  There are 3 halls of various story art (i.e. &quot;The cottage&quot;; &quot;The castle&quot;; &quot;the Forest&quot;; etc.)  Although initially I found it hard to move from hall to hall, I eventually figured it out.  The animated HALLS are extraordinary and the art that &quot;hangs&quot; there is incredible -- various renderings and attempts at bringing the story and locales of SNOW WHITE alive.  It's even more incredible that Disney Co. held on to these papers for all these years.<p>Well, in case you can't tell, I highly recommend the special SNOW WHITE disks.  You will spend days looking at everything that is included -- or you can opt to spend an hour and a half viewing the original,gorgeous film that started the Disney empire....</p></br><a href="../users/A2FRKEXDXDN1KI.html">A2FRKEXDXDN1KI</a><br/><p>The Blu-ray looks fantastic.  For this classic film from 1937 to look so vibrant, so spectacular, so beautiful 72 years later is a testament towards Disney's restoration and remastering.  The picture quality is absolutely pristine.  The new lossless  7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio is magnificent.  "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs: Diamond Edition" is highly recommended!<br /><br />For Walt Disney, seeing a play back in 1916 of "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" based on the fairty tale by the Brothers Grimm definitely made the producer to attempt something that has never been done before and that is to create a full-length color animated film.<br /><br />Known for their "Silly Symphony" animated shorts, the 1937 animated film definitely silenced anyone who thought that Disney was not able to pull off a full-length animated feature.  Even Walt Disney's wife thought that no one would want to watch a film that starred dwarfs but needless to say, the film that was called "Disney's Folly" by naysayers would receive critical praise and even demand by fans for a sequel.  The film would be not only be a classic animated film which was honored by the American Film Institute as the "Greatest Animation of All Time".  Even today, adjusted by inflation, the film is considered one of the top 10 money making films in America of all time.<br /><br />In 2001, when the "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" was released on DVD, the DVD was one of the films that were known for its innovation, winning a "Video Premiere Award" for "Best Overall New Extra Features" and nominated for "Best DVD Menu Design" and "Best New, Enhanced or Reconstructed Movie Scenes".<br /><br />But now in 2009, the film makes its High Definition entry on Blu-ray with 1080p High Definition picture quality and 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio sound.  Also, a Disney Blu-ray + DVD Combo Pack (two Blu-ray discs and a DVD version of the film) which comes out on October 6,  seven weeks before its Deluxe Two-Disc Classic standard definition DVD which will be released on Nov. 24th.  It's also important to note that a limited edition collector's set will also be available<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" gets its 1080p High Definition transfer and its absolutely beautiful.  Viewers can choose to watch the film in its original 4:3 (1:33:1)  format and watch it  with DisneyView featuring Tony Bluth's artwork on the side (for those who have widescreen televisions).  According to the guide included with this release, restoration experts took full advantage of the newest breakthroughs of digital imaging technologies to produce this classic.  The process took nearly a year of cleanup and scanning over 350,000 frames of the original 75-year-old negative.  And the digital artists then removed dust and scratches from the cels.<br /><br />The picture quality is absolutely beautiful for a film that is 72-years old.  The restoration and remastering has removed all dust and scratches.  I don't think I've seen any blemishes on video.  The picture quality is absolutely beautiful as art backgrounds just look absolutely divine. I don't think I have realized how exquisite the backgrounds were, especially the amount of emotion that went into the animation.  Picture quality for "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs: Diamond Edition" is definitely magnificent and I look forward to seeing Disney continue this trend of remastering their classic animated films.  As for DisneyView, similar to "Pinocchio", Toby Bluth's painted borders that are on the sides of the animation matches the animation quite fine and was definitely my preference over standard black bars.<br /><br />As for the accompanying DVD, the DVD is featured in an aspect ratio of 1:33:1.<br /><br />Audio is presented in English 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio (48 kHz/24-bit), the original mono presentation and also French and Spanish 5.1 DEHT restored original theatrical soundtrack.  The film is dialogue and music driven with the soundtrack being front and center channel driven.  Music is also featured during the surround and rear surround channels as well.  Dialogue and music is crystal clear and understandable.  During the more emotional sequences, such as Snow White running away from home in the forest, definitely makes the room quite immersive, albeit a short while but overall, a good use of utilizing the music of Snow White through all channels.  There are other parts that really come through on all channels such as a shriek by Snow White coming clear from the rear surrounds which was quite nice (and surprising).  Overall, a solid lossless audio soundtrack for a 72-year old animated film.<br /><br />As for the audio of the accompanying DVD, the DVD comes with an English, French and Spanish 5.1 DEHT soundtrack.<br /><br />Subtitles are provided in English SDH, French and Spanish.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES<br /><br />"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs: Diamond Edition" is absolutely loaded with special features.  In fact, I think this is the most special features I have ever seen for any video release of a film ever.  Special features range from 1080p High Definition and 480i Standard Definition.  Soundtrack is in English, French and Spanish 2.0.  Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.  Also is a booklet including a navigational overview of the special features included on both Blu-ray discs.<br /><br />Special features included are:<br /><br />DISC 1:<br /><br />  * Magic Mirror - Using the latest in Blu-ray technology, the iconic magic Mirror guides the audience through the Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs: Diamond Edition features with ease, serving as the host for an incredibly immersive experience.

Needless to say, the DVD won several awards for its technology and so, when the announcement came that "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" will receive a Diamond Edition Blu-ray disc release, I was curious to see how Disney could top themselves because that release was already phenomenal.<br /><br />I have since gone through the Blu-ray release and all I can say is...Wow!<br /><br />Disney has not only topped the Platinum Edition release, they have set the bar once again for a Blu-ray release and the amount of content that can be included on a Blu-ray and let alone, how awesome they were able to digitally restore the classic 1937 film.<br /><br />There was no doubt in my mind that Disney would give their first animated feature on Blu-ray the best treatment as possible and as this release is a celebration of "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs", it's also a celebration of the talent behind the film.  Those who were involved with Hyperion Studios that created the "Silly Symphonies" animated shorts back in the early 1930's and using the technology at that time and building it, in order to create their first full feature animated masterpiece.<br /><br />In fact, not only do we get audio of those who worked on the film but we also are treated with those classic animated shorts such as "Babes in the Woods", "The Skeleton Dance", "Music Land", "Goddess of Spring", "Playful Pluto", "The Old Mill", "Steamboat Willie" and more.  And to make things even more impressive, these shorts are featured in HD (not cleaned up but still much better than their DVD counterparts). This Blu-ray release manages to capture the various process of the film from creating the story, the music, the art, the backgrounds, the layout, the animation, the live action references, decisions at the sweatbox meetings, ink and paint and how women were involved in the animated process at the time, the camera department, soundstage, etc.<br /><br />So much is included on both Blu-ray discs in terms of special features, so much went into restoring this film, that this release is one, if not the top video releases of all time.  I have no doubt in my mind that probably ten years from now, this Blu-ray will be highly revered for its content.<br /><br />I know that many people own the 2001 Platinum DVD Edition of "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" and are wondering if it's worth the double dip and the answer is YES!  There is just so much included on the Diamond Edition, way more than the 2001 Platinum Edition.  Also, if you are now wanting these classic Disney films in High Definition, its definitely worth the move to see this classic film in High Definiton.  But I must say that you should not toss away your 2001 DVD edition because there are video clips such as the "Excerpt from The Story of Silly Symphony", "Excerpt from Tricks of Our Trade", "Camera Tests", "Abandoned Concepts", vintage audio (radio shows and spots are not included) and several songs and deleted scenes which are not included on this Diamond Edition release.<br /><br />So, overall it's a no-brainer that "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs: Diamond Edition" is definitely worth it.  For High Definition fans, the film looks and sounds absolutely gorgeous on Blu-ray.  And as mentioned, the sheer amount of content included in this release is absolutely incredible.<br /><br />I really don't have any negatives but me being nitpicky that it would have been nice to have certain special features such as the vintage radio/audio content , a few deleted scenes, songs and video clip excerpts from the 2001 Platinum Edition DVD included on the Diamond Edition.  And personally, for me that is the only thing that prevents me from calling this release absolute perfection.  There was one other thing and that is my Blu-ray discs came in a black DVD case, not the standard blue casing.  I was told that there will be two releases (in different casing, not inc. the limited edition) with one in a blue Blu-ray case and another using black DVD casing in order to educate those new to Blu-ray.<br /><br />I do think that Diamond Edition and the Platinum Edition are quite different in terms of presentation of special features and the goals were quite different of what kind of special features would be presented.  With the Platinum Edition, its solely focused on "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" and in the Diamond Edition, there is more focus on giving the viewer the history of Walt Disney and the animators of how they got from Silly Symphonies to using their skills and technology in creating the first animated feature film.  So, as I have said earlier in my review, this release is more or less, a celebration of those who worked on the film and giving recognition to those animators and staff members who took part in that film and the work that they did earlier, that became instrumental in creating Snow White.<br /><br />So, overall...the Diamond Edition is just incredible when it comes to the actual digital restoration of this classic film and a release that is absolutely packed with special features.  "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs: Diamond Edition" is a solid release that raises the bar of what Disney is capable of in terms of content in a home video release.  This is truly a magnificent release and is highly recommended!</p></br><a href="../users/AO461REE0KA4J.html">AO461REE0KA4J</a><br/><p>Disney's first &quot;Platinum Edition&quot; DVD is a terrific 2-disc set that every DVD fan should keep for all eternity.  (I received an early, free copy from Amazon which allowed me to review it before the Oct 9th release date.  This is a promotion by both Amazon and Buena Vista.)  The THX-certified video transfer of the movie is blemish-free, almost always sharp, and has only an occasional softness perhaps due to age.  Colors look splendid.  The sound is clean and without a scratch, although some dialogs lack detail.  The 5.1 audio remix provides mildly effective separation and bass for the background music.  Otherwise, it is neither better nor worse than the included original mono soundtrack.<p>The supplements on the first disc includes a 40-minute retrospective documentary that actually serves as a nice introduction of the supplements on the second disc.  For nearly every aspect mentioned in the documentary, the extras on the second disc cover at length.  There is an audio commentary track by historian John Canemaker that includes contemporary recordings of Walt reminiscing about the difficulties and fortunes during the making of the film.  The commentary reveals that Deanna Durbin was once considered for the voice of Snow White, but she was deemed &quot;too old&quot;.  Canemaker, besides introducing each of Walt's recordings, also provides excellent scene-by-scene analyses.  After the movie is over, Michael Eisner introduces Barbara Streisand's decidedly more mature rendition of &quot;Somewhere My Prince Will Come&quot;.  The first disc also includes four games -- two for set-top players, two as DVD-ROM content.<p>The second disc contains a large amount of archival material of the movie.  There are over 400 stills (all high-quality scans) of pencil tests, backgrounds, layouts, character designs, photos of the voice talents, photos of the production, the premiere, the 1937 pressbook, merchandise, and posters.  There are quite a bit of video content as well.  Notable is a new, nicely conceived, 40-minute segment called &quot;Disney Through the Years&quot;; it chronicles SNOW WHITE's theatrical releases in every decade (all trailers are shown) as well as Disney's accomplishments through the years.  There are the original credit sequences with the RKO logo.  There are deleted scenes that were fully animated and dubbed, one of which is a spectacular soup-eating scene.  There are scenes that were conceptualized but were abandoned before animation, such as a dream sequence for one of Snow White's songs.  There is a segment about the film's restorations in 1987, '93, and 2001.  There are also vintage video of voice actors, models for live action references, techniques used in animation (two excerpts of Disney's &quot;Tricks of our Trade&quot; TV show are included).<p>And there is more!  There is a half-hour live radio broadcast of the film's premiere in which many celebrities are interviewed.  There is another half-hour radio program in 1938 in which several songs from the movie are performed.  There are two 4-minute radio interviews of Walt Disney by Cecil B. DeMille, one of which was recorded on the eve of the premiere.  There are eight radio commercials from the 50s and 60s.  There are recordings of two deleted songs, one of which, we are told, were only recently discovered in Disney's archives.  There are also text screens about the film's production and Walt's life and career.  A nice inclusion is the English translation of the Grimms Brothers' &quot;Snow White.&quot;<p>Future Platinum Edition DVDs will include BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, ALADDIN, THE LION KING, BAMBI, THE JUNGLE BOOK, CINDERELLA, THE LITTLE MERMAID, LADY AND THE TRAMP and 101 DALMATIANS.  It disappoints me that DUMBO will not be a Platinum Edition (it will come out Oct 21st as a &quot;Gold Edition&quot; DVD).  It irks me even more that only one Platinum Edition DVD will be sold each year for only a limited time; thereafter it will be put on a TEN-YEAR moratorium.  This will no doubt lead to buying frenzies, so run, don't walk, to your nearest personal computer and order this SNOW WHITE DVD right away.  I do not oppose releasing one Platinum DVD per year, since I understand it takes time and care to produce these great discs.  But I do oppose Disney's long-standing policy of putting their video releases on moratorium for long, long periods.  Their rationale has been that if people own the movie on video, they may not want to see it in theaters.  Not true.  Seeing this spectacular SNOW WHITE DVD has actually increased my desire to see the film in a theater.</p></br><a href="../users/A2I6MHMAZZDCRX.html">A2I6MHMAZZDCRX</a><br/><p>The Disney Company has over used the term Masterpiece when referring to its own movies. But this one truly deserves that title. While its animation betray its age, the story and characters are still fun, and its place in history also makes it a must.<p>The story is simple and familiar. Snow White's wicket stepmother wants her killed because Snow White is "the fairest of them all." She is saved from this fate, and hides out with seven dwarfs. But will the queen find her and try to kill her?<p>Walt's genius here was in creating the characters. The dwarfs have very distinctive personalities, and some of the best scenes in the movie revolve around them. (The scene where they first come home is a classic.) The animals add some humor as well, especially when cleaning the cottage.<p>The plot moves along well, and when I first saw it in college, I was drawn into the story even though I knew the ending. I actually felt tears when the dwarfs were mourning Snow White.<br /><br />By today's standards, the animation is flawed, especially for the prince. However, there are some truly beautiful scenes as well, particularly the sun set when the dwarfs are coming home. Fans of Disney in the 30's will recognize the feel of some of the silly symphony cartoons. The important thing to remember when watching this movie is its place in history. This is the first animated movie ever, produced when everyone thought no one would ever see it. The fact that we're still watching it is a testimony to Walt as a filmmaker and pioneer. <p>This DVD set is the perfect way to enjoy this movie.  The picture and soundtrack have been lovingly restored, and look and sound incredible.  The sound is presented in Dolby 5.1 and its original mono.  I didn't notice that much difference between the two modes, but it's nice to have the option.  The first disc also contains a wonderful audio commentary.  Recorded interviews with Walt Disney are interspersed with comments from John Canemaker.  I learned quite a bit about the film from this commentary.  The second disc contains all you would ever want to know about the history of the film.  They've got character design changes, completely abandoned concepts, deleted scenes, and information on the releases over the years to name a few things.  I spent hours soaking up the information and enjoying every moment of it.<p>This is truly a classic movie that belongs in any film fan's library.  Hurry and get this wonderful set before it disappears.</p></br><a href="../users/A2C27IQUH9N1Z.html">A2C27IQUH9N1Z</a><br/><p>You could never accuse the guys at Disney of being on the cutting edge of progressive social thought, but they sure knew about fun -- and the current crew augments that same idea of fun with the latest technology by coming up with the best bells and whistles I've seen on a DVD.  There are two discs to hold it all -- pretty remarkable when you condsider that the movie itself is only 84 minutes long.<p>The movie looks and sounds great .... a beautiful restoration.  Images are sharp, sound is clear.  You can listen to the original mono soundtrack, or an improved digital track in English or French.  If you choose French, even the opening sequence of a printed fairy tale book appears in French.  Pretty cool.<p>The extras include Streisand singing 'Some Day My Prince Will Come'; a karaoke edition of 'Heigh Ho'; a 39-minute documentary about the making of the film narrated by Angela Lansbury; audio commentary by Walt Disney himself, pieced together from archived materials; an animated short used to test some of the animation; and Dopey's Wild Mine Ride -- a great little trivia/puzzle game -- and that's just the first disk!<p>The second disk is spectacular -- there are dozens of elements here, but I will mention (what I consider to be) the best: storyboard/film comparison; scenes deleted from the film (including a great scene of the dwarves making Snow White a bed, with comments penciled in by an animator); camera tests; featurettes about the voices, audio sessions, restoration of the film, and artistic concepts -- layouts, backgrounds, character sketches and development; publicity materials (posters, photos, trailers, radio commercials); and a timeline of the history of the film *and* Disney studios.<p>The amount (and quality) of extras is truly incredible; and there is a well-designed print brochure, as well as on-disk tours of the material, to help you find your way around.<p>This is a great version of a wonderful film -- and an exemplary use of the DVD format.<p>Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A2INL3AYAT6325.html">A2INL3AYAT6325</a><br/><p>This is the one that started it all &amp; it still stands up.

Besides the high-def version of the video and 7.1 sound, there are not one but two blu-ray discs loaded with extras to wet the most demanding appetite for details about Disney's first movie: three games, four backstage documentaries along with the classic bonus features complement the feature.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I can't make an informed comment about the quality of any of the Blue-Ray portions since I still only have a regular DVD player. As for the DVD disc included, it consists of the classic movie with restored picture and sound, a few trailers, a music video with Tiffany Thornton singing "Some Day My Prince Will Come" and a pretty nice sneak peek into The Princes and The Frog.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VI2VETB90ZG5.html">A3VI2VETB90ZG5</a><br/><p>I didn't think animated features would benefit from a high definition transfer, but it turns out they do.<br /><br />This Blu-ray Diamond Edition of Snow White and the Seven Dwarves adds enough resolution to the film to make it seem as though we're leering just over the actual sequence of cels, allowing us to see the quality of the hand drawn images as if we're looking right at them. Small details aren't muttled into an averaged pixel representation - you see all the small details in their original glory.<br /><br />The audio quality is truly superb. Disney must have kept their original audio masters in outstanding condition. The clarity and fidelity of the sound completely masks the age of the film. It sounds like a recent release (unlike another clean, but distant-sounding 70th anniversary product that just released with a watch) - they've done a fantastic job with the multi-track audio.<br /><br />Are the visual and audio improvements astonishing? Let me say it's enough to add a certain charm to the film that had not been apparent in previous home-viewing formats. It's very captivating to watch this presentation in its storybook form, from start to finish, it's just magic. There is no jaw-dropping difference to where you might be majorly missing out on anything, but this is the best presentation available and it is worth its price for this historically significant gem of a film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1G0VFQ9198IUF.html">A1G0VFQ9198IUF</a><br/><p>this is like Disney's first full length animated movie.  one sad thing about snow white her step mom want her dead.  i love the dwarfs they are so funny.  i grew up with Disney may not be as old as them.</p></br><a href="../users/A132ETQPMHQ585.html">A132ETQPMHQ585</a><br/><p>My daughter still loves this....Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.....nice movie and still a favorite.....for years later!~ Arrived quickly and a very good price Amazon almost always has the best price  on DVD'S!~</p></br><a href="../users/A370Z6I5GBWU44.html">A370Z6I5GBWU44</a><br/><p>Mind you, this is by no means the first animated project Disney did - there were all the black-and-white shorts as well as some color shorts, but Snow White was the first full-length animated movie that Disney produced.<br /><br />Like other fairy tales, Disney took liberties with Snow White. We see NOTHING of her father, so we assume that he is already dead. It's unclear what Snow White is Princess of, so the background could use more work. Still, the evil Queen was nicely done, and this movie features stuff that would become typical Disney fare - animal buddies, musical numbers, a happy ending, what have you. I do wish that the movie had been more faithful to the tale in the part where the Queen disguises herself. In the movie, she only presents a poisoned apple, but in the story, she first offered a comb (poisoned, of course) and a girdle/corset/belt (depends on what version of the story you're reading) that made Snow White unable to breathe. I'd have liked to see the comb and belt in the movie.<br /><br />The dwarves are very likeable, and it's great to see the relationship between Snow White and them develop.<br /><br />I'm not really crazy about Snow White's costume design, the dress could have been done better, but her face is just darling.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TAPL67U2A5HM.html">A2TAPL67U2A5HM</a><br/><p>Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (Disney Special Platinum Edition) is a cartoon that was first shown in the cinemas 1937 and still it is an amazing cartoon. The charchters are still as alive and vivid now as then. The music and songs are amazing and the story which is adapted by the Grimm Brothers is timeless. I love the scenes with the small animals and the scene with the lost small bird is so cute. This is certainly one of Walt Disneys best movies and certainly a nugget in the Disney cartoon vault.

That was 72+ years ago!<br /><br />I really enjoyed watching them all dance with Snow White. It was cute.<br /><br />All in all, a good movie for kids and some adults to enjoy.

Happily, the DVD edition does justice to one of the all-time great films, featuring a pristine transfer and a wealth of archival material. With the exception of "Fantasia" (1940), Disney never surpassed this remarkable achievement in animation.</p></br><a href="../users/A16QODENBJVUI1.html">A16QODENBJVUI1</a><br/><p>I was absolutely ecstatic to receive a preview copy of the Blu-ray edition of SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARVES.  This is one of those films whose importance in the history of the movies is simply impossible to over emphasize.  While Disney had been one of the most important animators of the thirties, but by no means the only one.  The Fleischers were doing a string of utterly delightful short films as good or better than what was happening at Disney, not merely with Betty Boop and Popeye but a number of superb cartoon fantasies.  What separated Walt Disney from his fellow animators was producing a feature length animated film.  As has been recounted in a number of works on SNOW WHITE, many thought this was an incredibly Quixote film to make.  Most felt that it was going to be a failure, that most people would not be willing to sit through a long color.  Some of the reasons strike us as silly, e.g. that the bright colors would hurt the viewers eyes after a while and they would leave to rest their eyes.  (This may sound silly, but remember that in the years that this was being made, from around 1933 through 1937, most studios had only one or two color cameras - e.g., when Orson Welles was making CITIZEN KANE, RKO offered him one of their few color cameras, but he turned it down, preferring to do the film, but the offer showed how important the film was to RKO.)<br /><br />Luckily, SNOW WHITE was a huge hit (unlike the next few Disney feature length films, which turned a profit, but only a minor one).  And it is easy to see shy.  The film is a technical marvel.  Although it has been superseded by all of the films that have come after it.  What is astonishing is how close to perfect the film is in every aspect.<br /><br />The film looks absolutely spectacular on Blu-ray.  The colors have never looked better, but the real improvement is in the sound, which is crisper and fuller than ever before.  It has been reedited for compatibility with surround sound.  I've always loved SNOW WHITE, but I don't know that I've ever been as delighted watching it.  I'd seen it a couple of times in theaters as well as on VHS, but those prints were usually somewhat worn.  (Several fellow students and I went and saw this at a college film society; one of the students was the daughter of a major member of the Disney studios, a man who wrote screenplays for several of the major studios, designed some of Disney's major characters, and directed several films.)  The print here is not only perfect, a high def TV with a Blu-player and surround sound makes possible a viewing experience never before possible.<br /><br />SNOW WHITE features one of my favorite sequences in any Disney film.  The Huntsman has been ordered to kill Snow White and to that end he approaches her in the woods.  At the last second he is unable to carry his task out.  Instead, he warns her that her life is in danger and that she must flee to save her life.  So she runs immediately into the forest, where her terror turns everything she sees into a threat.  Logs in a pond appear to her as alligators.  Tree limbs are the arms of monsters who are trying to snag her.  Tree trunks appear to be ghouls.  Finally, in exhaustion she collapses in a small clearing, where menacing eyes look out upon her.  As she calms down the eyes are revealed to belong to bunnies.  And deer.  And chipmunks.  Quail.  Sparrows.  Bluebirds.  It is a wonderful sequence, as Snow White's imagination transforms the world into a savage and menacing place.<br /><br />One interesting feature of the disc is the so-called Disney View option in watching the movie.  You can either watch it in the original 4:3 ratio with black on each side or you can use the Disney View option, in which animator Toby Bluth (brother of Don Bluth) provides frames on each side of the image.  I was a bit dubious about this before trying it, but I have to confess that I like it a great deal.  I like that this is entirely optional.  I liked the results quite a bit, but I could understand if someone else did not.  The effect is very much like in older theaters where large curtains were opened just far enough to reveal the screen.  If you don't like it (my daughter and I both loved it), just opt for the 4:3 version.<br /><br />This Diamond edition does contain three discs.  The first is a DVD copy of the film.  The second is a Blu-ray copy.  The third is a Blu-ray bonus disc with both extras produced exclusively for this Diamond Edition and features that were produced for the previous DVD version of the film.  There are so many extras that it is difficult to list them all.  There are a great number that are intended for small kids and I'm going to pass on these.  I have close to no interest in those so I'll focus on the ones that I find especially interesting.  One especially interesting feature deals with what was intended as a sequel to the feature film, a short that was worked on but not completed, a project entitled SNOW WHITE RETURNS, in which the Seven Dwarves make a new large bed for Snow White.  I loved the feature on Hyperion Studios, where you got to go on something of a virtual tour of the site where SNOW WHITE was produced.  You see period photos of the various parts of the studio with interview clips from some of the people who worked there.<br /><br />Given the excellence of the film, the double versions, the large number of special features, and the historical importance of the film, this Blu-ray/DVD set is very nearly a perfect release.  Some Disney films (like the recently released PETE'S DRAGON) I can only recommend for small children.  But this is a film just about everyone should own.  If you have small children, you need it for them.  If you are a student of the history of film, you need it for the important role it played in the development of the medium.  And if you are a fan of great animation, you need it because this is the film that gave birth to the animated feature film.  And on top of this it comes at a really decent price.  This disc definitely falls into the "Must Own" category.<br /><br />By the way, not only did the film through its huge success make possible all future feature length animated films (though it is fascinating that other studios didn't immediately attempt to emulate Disney - both MGM and Warner Brothers had great animated departments that combined with the resources of the main studio might have been capable of making a feature length film), it inspired one live action film.  Howard Hawks directed BALL OF FIRE, based on a Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett screenplay.  In that film seven stuffy scholars engaged in writing an encyclopedia and living together in a Manhattan mansion provide temporary sanctuary to a gangster's moll on the run (played wonderfully by Barbara Stanwyck).  The film has also entered our consciousness in ways that make possible other narratives.  For instance, Snow White's singing to birds has been parodied in a variety of films, most memorably in SHREK (where Princess Fiona's warbling causes a bird to explode) and in Disney's own brilliant live action film ENCHANTED.  And it has become customary to refer to various people by the names of one or another of the Seven Dwarves.</p></br><a href="../users/A319SKSB556033.html">A319SKSB556033</a><br/><p>I can't believe the clarity of this DVD. You could swear that this movie was made yesterday by the eye popping color. I've seen some great restorations but this is by far the best, even moreso considering that this film is now 64 years old. Disney have outdone themselves.<p>The movie itself is entertaining although it does seem a bit European at times. It does not take place in any particular country but some of the dwarves sound like they are from Kentucky. The abundance of cute animals and a surprisingly cruel villain keep this story watchable. I mean we have heard it a million times before but the dwarves have more character than Snow White who does nothing but look pretty. And who doesn't want the Evil Queen to get what's coming to her.<p>The supplements on the DVD are MASSIVE and too many to even mention. Let me just say that if you are a fan of the film you certainly WON'T be dissapointed. This baby is loaded and bursting at the seams. <p>The DVD is in 1.33:1 full frame and is in Dolby 5.1.<p>Thanx Amazon. :)</p></br><a href="../users/A2NX99GVAX4TRP.html">A2NX99GVAX4TRP</a><br/><p>Snow White was the first American full-length animated feature.  Many consider it Walt Disney's masterpiece.  As it was being made from at least 1934 through 1937 many industry movers and shakers thought Wal t Disney had lost his mind, spending so much time, energy and effort on producing something as utterly ridiculous as a feature length cartoon feature.  Disney was crazy as a fox.  He established the foundation of the Disney formula and established his studio as the one to reckon with when it came to animated features. <p>Keeping things simple and glossing over the most gruesome aspects of the Brothers Grimm classic fairy tale, Walt Disney and company created a squeaky clean protagonist, a hiss-able antagonist and several love-able and humorous characters with names that are still the subject of formal and informal trivia contests around the world.  The film offers several memorable and now classic sequences such as when Snow White flees into the forest or  the Queen transformation scenes.  There are also those memorable songs: "Heigh Ho", "Whistle While You Work" and the operetta styled "Some Day My Prince Will Come".<p>Technically Snow White represented a huge achievement for Walt Disney in several ways.  The detailed character animation complete with very good lip synching, and beautifully drawn background settings including shadows and water reflections were the finest American audiences had ever seen on the screen.<p>Regardless of whether this is your all-time favorite Disney feature or not--the DVD is nothing short of a stunning package that should be considered by anyone and everyone who has any interest in this film whatsoever.<p>The quality of the image and sound is superb.  There's some artifacting present in the very beginning of the film (during it's story-book opening) but then finding any flaws in the presentation becomes quite a challenge.  A few sequences are a bit too dark perhaps.  The best quality prints were obtained, assembled and then given a full spare no expense clean up before being almost flawlessly digitally transferred to disc.  The sound was reproduced and then digitally enhanced and re-mixed.  It is remarkable what has been done with what was one a mono audio track and now takes full advantage of  the capabilities of a multi-speaker home theater system.  Much of the original audio track was recorded in 1935 !  And sure you can hear some crackles and hisses and pops, but the clarity and fullness that has been achieved will knock your socks off.<p>The supplemental material presented on this 2 DVD set is everything you could have ever hoped for.  From a lengthy newly created making of documentary hosted by Angela Landsbury  to some truly stunning archival footage that includes deleted scenes, incomplete and abandoned sequences and more.  Publicity material, footage from the premiere, and even a silly DVD game is included in the package. <p>You also get, now get this, what amounts to audio commentary from Walt Disney himself integrated into the feature length commentary of the film.  <p>Is it really worth buying this DVD?  If you have any interest in the film at all, this is a DVD that you must have in your collection.  Disney is hyping this one pretty heavily and declaring it the finest DVD ever produced.  They are probably absolutely correct.  This DVD package has so much packed it into, you might say that even the bells and whistles have bells and whistles.  Not all the supplemental material is priceless or essential to be sure, but a lot of it is and the additional stuff isn't here at the expense of including something else.  They have opened up the archives, dug deep into the vaults and created a package to satisfy the most insatiable Snow White buff amongst us.  You better believe there's a little to much of the sugar-coated Disney Studios as the KING OF THE ANIMATION WORLD type stuff--but you've been living in a cave for the last 20 years if you didn't expect it.<br /><br />Bottom line: Technically this DVD is a beauty and there are hours of supplemental material to please film, animation, and Disney buffs.  Some of the supplemental material will also drive animation afficianados crazy--but you already knew it would.<p>Christopher Jarmick,is the author of The Glass Cocoon with Serena F.

They also expand upon the original (in this case a story from Grimms' fairy tales) to make the story more compehensible and the characters people we can better relate to.  Snow White (voiced by Adriana Caselotti, the 21-year-old daughter of an operatic family) is a young princess forced by her vain stepmother the Queen (Lucille La Verne) to dress in rags and work as a scullery maid (presumably her father is dead, though we're never definitely told, and the Queen simply seized the throne as Regent and hung onto it).  When the Queen's Magic Mirror informs her that Snow White can now be reckoned "fairest of them all," she plots to have the girl murdered, but her huntsman (Stuart Buchanan) can't go through with the deed and urges her to run away and hide in the forest.  With the help of the small animals she befriends, she finds the house of the Seven Dwarfs, wins their hearts, and is then found and pursued by the Queen in the guise of a "harmless old beggar woman," with poison apple at hand.<br /><br />In today's liberated climate, some viewers may censure Snow for her panicked flight into the deep woods, but it's worth asking yourself if *you* wouldn't panic too if someone had just come after you with a Bowie knife!  And although Snow dreams of the day "my prince will come" and take her away, she's still a hard, uncomplaining worker who cheerfully resigns herself to the Queen's tyrannies and makes the most of her situation--which, of course, enables her to make a place for herself in the Dwarves' home.  But the best parts of the movie aren't even about her: they focus on things like the friendly animals (watch for the raccoons helping to do the Dwarves' laundry, or the buck who helps pull an ore-cart at their diamond mine), the magic, and the music (anyone who doesn't want to get up and dance during the Dwarves' Yodel Song is seriously in need of an attitude adjustment!).  And, of course, the Dwarves themselves, each a distinct individual (I suspect that a great many of us like Grumpy the best!).  This is a DVD that no family library should lack.</p></br><a href="../users/AY6A8KPYCE6B0.html">AY6A8KPYCE6B0</a><br/><p>Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is a classic for so many reasons.  Other than being the first feature-length animation ever, it's also one of the most humorous, charming, memorable movies ever made.<br /><br />But of course, you've already seen the movie (probably a 100 or more times) and really you want to know if this Blu Ray transfer is worth replacing your other copy.  The simple answer:  YES.<br /><br />The standards set by this Diamond release has really got me excited about future releases from the series, because I assure you it is jam packed with goodies, and even more importantly, the digital restoration is absolutely stunning.  For a 73 year old movie, it looks so good it might has well been made last year.  It's presented in its original ratio of 1:33:1 which is essentially a square. While if you have a wide screen TV there will be those kind of unpleasant looking black bars on the side.  No fear, however, as Disney has ever so creatively found a way to make even those look beautiful.  If you select to watch the "DisneyView" experience, they insert beautiful artwork in the sections where the black bars would be.  The art is usually a red velvet curtain, or marble  lining, or something to give the picture a look of stunning presentation.  The color palette of the artwork always matches the scene of the movie so you almost don't even realize it's not part of the film.  An amazing feature!<br /><br />Other special goodies included are deleted scenes, which are quite cute, information on "Snow White Returns" which was a recently discovered storyline for a animation short where Snow White comes to visit the dwarfs and they decide to make her a bed as a present.  There's also some segments on the theatrical debut of Snow White which is of course very exciting.  Walt was such a showman! I had no idea that he presented the film in a DisneyLand like setting.<br /><br />Even as animation takes a drastic 3D turnaround, early Disney 2D movies will be forever remembered and no collection of them would be complete without the gracious (and a little air heady) Snow White, her animal entourage, and her seven short friends.  With this new Blu Ray release you can be sure that you are getting the absolute best copy of the film to date, and it will make the movie only that much more magical for you.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EISFBTLEQC69.html">A3EISFBTLEQC69</a><br/><p>This is the prettiest animation, the old fashion kind.  It is mesmerizing to see how much detail is all drawn in.  The music is beautiful to listen to and sing!  The witch is a bit scary though for very young children.</p></br><a href="../users/ARA48345JZPZR.html">ARA48345JZPZR</a><br/><p>Nearly 2/3's of a century later, Snow White &amp; the Seven Dwarfs still has the power to enchant and amuse and beguile.  The restoration is fabulous, with clean, crisp &amp; clear picture and beautiful digitized sound.  It looks and sounds as it must have been intended, if not better, and this first full-length animated story still delivers.  Your children and grandchildren should love it.<p>There are two Discs just chock-a-block with goodies.  There are documentaries, background stories, features on animation, games for the kids, galleries of original drawings, deleted sequences and so on.  As much or more than you ever wanted to know about the making of this landmark film.  There is so much to see that more than one viewing is essential.  <p>I found the influences of European artists Disney brought in to create the overall look of the film, evoking German fairy tales, interesting.  Of course there is the inevitable Disney Co. commercial inherent in some of the presentation (they are a Marketing juggernaut in case you didn't notice), but that is to be expected and is minor.  The different Special Features are beautifully presented with new animation and different human guides.<p>If you are interested in what went into making a landmark of animation, you will certainly find something of interest here.  If not, you still have the marvelously presented feature itself. <p>After viewing most of all of the 2 discs, what struck me most was a renewed respect for Walt Disney's courage and vision.  He continually bet the farm (with brother Roy backing him) on his own gut instincts &amp; intuition.  That, and his absolute demand for craft and creativity and excellence.  I grew up with Uncle Walt, on TV and successful,  and it is good to remember that he had no safety net or guarantees when he layed it all on the line for what he wanted to do.  He was a true American genius, a crazy combination of savvy entrepeneur, craftsman, artist, visionary, gambler, and Marketing whiz.  He was one in a million.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>It is clear from the DVD edition that Disney has put together for &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,&quot; the beloved film enshrined in cinema history as the first full-length animated film, that this is the standard by which all future Disney releases will be judged.  Your kids or grandchildren might find the animation to be somewhat quaint, but they will certainly be impressed by this &quot;Immersive 2-Disc DVD Experience.&quot;  There is so much to do with the extras that they might even forget to actually watch the movie, which has been digitally restored.  However, this would be a big mistake as you are not going to be able to solve the puzzles and win &quot;Dopey's Wild Mine Ride&quot; game if you have not seen the film.<p>Everything is hosted by either Roy Disney or the Magic Mirror on the Wall (you have to love that that dry sense of humor), and what they have on the first disc along with the movie is enough to thrill any fan of Snow White.  You can listen to Barbra Streisand sing &quot;Some Day My Prince Will Come&quot; or you can all sing the Karaoke version of &quot;Heigh-Ho.&quot;  Then there is &quot;The Making of 'Snow White'&quot; documentary, the aduio commentary and even the Silly Symphony cartoon &quot;Goddess of Spring.&quot;  And all of this is before you even get to the second disc where you are simply going to find what must be EVERYTHING Disney has relating to this film as we explore &quot;The Legacy of 'Snow White.'&quot;  There are not just deleted scenes and a deleted song (&quot;You're Never Too Old To Be Young&quot;), there are abandoned concepts for several scenes, such as a &quot;fantasy version&quot; of &quot;Some Day My Prince Will Come.&quot;  Just look at the Edition Details for this DVD: have you ever seen a list that long?  It took me the entire weekend just to get through MOST of what is on this DVD.  <p>Yes, you bought the Disney animated films on videotape and then you went out and got them on DVD.  But the extras alone are worth the price of this first &quot;Platinum Edition.&quot;  Most importantly, Disney has clearly made a covenant with its audience that this is indeed the level of excellence they will do with their entire collection of classic films and I only hope they do this not just for &quot;Pinocchio&quot; but also for &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; as well.  This is what happens when a studio cherishes its classic films as much as we do.</p></br><a href="../users/AXFI7TAWD6H6X.html">AXFI7TAWD6H6X</a><br/><p>Disney once again reaches into its vaults and dust off one of its classic films to give it a proper remastering treatment. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is Disney's latest film to have received a remastering treatment and is being released as a diamond edition. I could not imagine anything less for Disney's first feature length animated film. I have the 3 disc combo pack which includes the dvd of the film (for those who do not have a blu ray player  like me), disc 2 is the blu-ray version, and disc three is chock full of bonus footage which will really please the younger viewers.<br /><br />I admit I have forgotten when the last time I actually had watched Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. I am more the positive that the last time I saw it was when I was still a little girl. The story of Snow White hiding from her wicked stepmother and living among seven dwarfs is timeless. Even at 35, I am still entertained by the story. The animation is beautiful and vibrant, especially the apple. The sound quality is just as good. I definitely recommend buying the diamond edition of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. I don't think you are too old to watch this timeless classic.</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>This was Walt Disney's first animated full-length movie. I've read where it took somewhere between two to five years to make, and the artwork still stands up to today's standards.<br /><br />t was good to see Disney releasing a nice Blu-Ray of this. It's pretty sharp and up to the Disney Blu-Ray standards. It makes a great movie all the more great. Not only is the picture improved, but so is the sound, and so is the regular DVD.....so you get a lot of bang for your buck here.<br /><br />The story is "cute" because of the seven dwarfs. The evil character - the queen - doesn't have that big a role so most of the time it's just a sweet, enjoyable film with nice characters. It's one of the those movies that makes you feel good as you are watching it.</p></br><a href="../users/A11C43I615R52G.html">A11C43I615R52G</a><br/><p>Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is a classic film that is one of my all time favorites. Walt Disney's first full animated feature film its an artistic masterful achievement. The film was a great triumph in 1937 and is still a great triumph today, nearly 73 years after. Aside from being the first animated film and the one that paved the way to the creation of the Disney empire as we know it today with dozens of many animated films in its catalogue most of them redeemed as classics today, Snow White happens to be a fantastic film. It has a great plot, a great story with great characters, music and heart. This makes this film as fresh as it was in its original theatrical release so many years ago. Disney has always treated this masterpiece as such and in 2001 it was release as a 2-Disc Platinum edition DVD. This DVD was the best of the Platinum line and one of the best DVDs ever produced. Disney again does the film justice releasing it now as part of the Diamond line in Bluray and the results are better than ever.<br /><br />Snow white looks fantastic in hi def with vivid colors, sharpness and a clean transfer. The Platinum looked terrific but Disney topped themselves with this new transfer. Absolutely marvelous. The DTS MA 7.1 is also very crisp and clear but don't expect it to rock your house. Nonetheless, is a great audio. Purists will be glad that the original mono track has been also restored and included here.<br /><br />The Platinum Edition was a pioneer for the vast content that had about the movie., This Diamond edition does the same in a more interactive way that inmerse you much more in the world of Snow White. The Hyperion Studios feature is fantastic.<br /><br />The only negative thing I can count is that not everything from the Platinum Edition has been carried over to the Diamond. If you(like me) are an avid fan of Snow White, you should hold onto both because together they make the ultimate deluxe edition of this film. The DVD that is included here also looks fantastic and better than the Platinum. A 5.1 DEHTM is also included.<br /><br />As you can see, this diamond edition of Snow White is deluxe treatment for a deluxe film. While is unfortunate that not everything from the Platinum got place here, this new edition is oustanding nonetheless. Just Buy it. Completely Recommended.<br /><br />Note: This film is presented in its original aspect ratio of 1.33:1 fullscreen which is the right aspect ratio of the film. Viewers who want a widescreen experience can watch the film with Disneyview that fills the black bars with backgrounds similar to the ones in the film.</p></br><a href="../users/AW003H7Z3OCHA.html">AW003H7Z3OCHA</a><br/><p>The American Film Institute voted 2 of Walt Disney Films into the top 100 films in the last 100 years.

For reasons known only to Amazon, reviews of earlier versions - those that are of significantly inferior quality in terms of production values - are recycled for inclusion with reviews of the latest version. Note that two of the first three reviews now featured were posted in 2001.<br /><br />*  *  *<br /><br />I first saw this film in the Shore Theater in the Windsor Park area of South Chicago and have since seen it several dozen times in the VHS and subsequent DVD format. Snow White and Pinocchio are my favorite Disney feature animated films. I was delighted that Disney released the Two-Disc 70th Anniversary Platinum Edition of Pinocchio earlier this year and now we have the Diamond Edition of Snow White that includes DVD and Blue-Ray in a "Combo Pack," accompanied by a wealth of special features that really are special. As a result of all-new state-of-the-art digital restoration and Disney Enhanced High Definition sound, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs once again possesses all of the magic that previous versions of Disney's first animated feature film do not.<br /><br />In an article about the Walt Disney Family Museum that appeared in The New York Times (October 1, 2009), Edward Rothstein observes: "By the time [Disney] created his first feature-length work, `Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,' he had transformed the very notion of animation. Disney insisted that cartoons literally animate their world, bring it so thoroughly to life that even inanimate objects would react to events. He pushed his staff to strain for realism (and sponsored drawing classes in his studios). But he was interested in something more than reality; even tables and trees would display character." I include Rothstein's insightful comments because the animation of otherwise inanimate objects is brilliantly enhanced by all-new state-of-the-art digital restoration. In the Blu-Ray format, the images in Snow White seem even more vivid than I what I recall seeing in a theater and the songs are much more enjoyable because of their presentation in Disney Enhanced High Definition sound.<br /><br />The plot is based on one of the fairy tales of the Brothers Grimm, Wilhelm and Jacob, and the songs were composed by Frank Churchill (who also wrote the music for "Dumbo" and "Bambi") and Larry Morey (who also wrote the lyrics for "Bambi.") Together they wrote over 25 songs for Snow White but (ironically) only seven were used. After the success of that film, Churchill was promoted to Supervisor of Music at the Disney Studios. There are several of Disney's core themes developed, notably the constant threat of evil and efforts to flee from it as well as the importance of trust and the power of faith. Moreover, whereas a castle or cottage is merely a residence, wherever one is able to be with loved ones is "home." Even the forest animals who live nearby become involved with household chores, soon after Snow White arrives at the dusty, disorganized sylvan "pad" shared by seven bachelors.  Given the fact that they haul diamonds from the mine each day, you'd think they could afford a cook and maid. Apparently not.<br /><br />Disney will offer this "Combo Pack" for a limited time only and it really does offer significant value-added benefits that include an all new music video performed by Sonny with a Chance's Tiffany Thornton, an exclusive sneak preview of The Princess and the Frog, "What Do You See?" and "Jewel Jumble" game exercises, newly discovered storyboards for "Snow White Returns," a tour of Walt Disney's original Hyperion studios, and "Dopey's Wild Mine Ride" game. Even without any supplementary features such as these, however, this version (in either the DVD or Blu-Ray format) is, in my opinion, the most complete masterpiece of all the great feature-length animated films. None other combines as effectively his one does both drama and delight in terms of plot, character development, and music.<br /><br />In a review of Snow White for The New York Times in 1938, Frank Nugent wrote, "Wars are being fought as the picture unreels; crimes are being committed; hatreds are being whetted; riots are being brewed. But the world fades away when M. Disney begins weaving his spell and enchantment takes hold." In his biography of Disney, published in 2006, Neal Gabler observes that other critics "cited the awesome power of the sheer technical achievement: the collaboration of the nearly six hundred employees who drew, inked, and painted the quarter-million drawings in what totaled two hundred years' worth of man-hours. While no animated cartoon had ever looked like Snow White, and certainly none had packed its emotional wallop, it was also true that in none would the investment of time, energy, and devotion be so palpable. In some respects it was the cinematic equivalent of a Gothic cathedral - only in this case all the man-hours were expended in service to one man's vision rather than God's glory."<br /><br />Most of those who see this film could not care less about its cultural significance, nor about its seamless integration of theme with technology, of inspiration with execution. They will almost immediately be delighted by the lead characters and enchanted by the life they share. Now restored and enhanced, Snow White once again has the technical brilliance and emotional power that were premiered at the Cathay Circle Theater on the evening of December 21, 1937. According to one observer, Bill Peet, "everyone in that first Snow White audience could have predicted the enormous success of the film. They were carried away by the picture from the very beginning, and as it went along everyone was bubbling over with enthusiasm and frequently bursting into spontaneous applause." To the best of my knowledge, no other film made more than 70 years ago continues to have the same impact that it did when first released. If that isn't "magic," I really don't know what is.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DDPQ9342UNMY.html">A3DDPQ9342UNMY</a><br/><p>My mother kept an old clipping for years describing SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS when it opened at the huge and prestigious Radio City Music Hall in New York City and received a rave review from newspaper columnist Westbrook Pegler.<br /><br />He usually wrote about politics but on this occasion he took time to devote an entire review to Disney's new film. He called it a "masterpiece" and said that when the projectionist slipped those reels of film on the projector, the audience at the Music Hall witnessed one of the greatest motion pictures ever made.<br /><br />Coming from him, that was high praise indeed. And seeing the film now, restored for its video bow, we can appreciate his words. There are faults, to be sure, but basically it has to be admired for the innovative techniques it used in the art of animation. There are memorable sequences thanks to daring use of the multiplane camera: Snow White's flight through the woods, the Queen and her Magic Mirror, the Queen in the thunderous transformation scene as the camera seems to whirl around her, the Dwarfs in the mine and their march over the bridge as they sing "Heigh-Ho", the dwarfs chasing the witch in the thunderstorm. Even the rippling effects of the water in the wishing well scene.<br /><br />And, of course, there are the genuinely comic moments that made even the great Charlie Chaplin applaud in admiration. Dopey's antics are always a delight, as are Doc's and Grumpy's. All of the dwarfs are given inventive and funny things to do. The animation for the heroine herself is so gracefully done, particularly in the "Yodel Song" sequence where she dances with the dwarfs, that it's almost like watching a real "Snow White" go through the paces. That scene remains one of the most charming moments from the entire film with the dwarfs all displaying their own distinctive traits.<br /><br />The music is a standout: Someday My Prince Will Come, Heigh-Ho, I'm Wishing, The Yodel Song, etc. The young in heart will always love this classic. The art work is so rich in detail that the cottage scenes take on a life of their own, as do the images of the Wicked Queen at her castle.<br /><br />It belongs in the top tier of Disney's crown jewels, along with Pinocchio, Bambi, Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella.<br /><br />Summing up: an inspired work of art on every level that will remain a timeless classic.<br /><br />Note: This review is based on the VHS and theatrical version of the film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CQON0P01BITL.html">A1CQON0P01BITL</a><br/><p>This is an absolute wonderful classic.

Its theme has since passed the test of time.  The unforgettable charming plot remains frequently viewed by many audiences today.  It takes audiences through a tale of Snow White struggling to find Prince Charming.  Through life obstacles, namely the Wicked Witch, she finds seven dwarves whom she helps and help her.  This series of events, with others, keeps audiences interested in every scene.  The individual character personalities give this fairy tale a great name.  Through these events, the songs blend wonderfully with the individual scenes.  They offer the added entertainment pleasure that spices up the film events.  The voices add such delight to this film through the script and the singing.  The sounds add a beautiful element to the charming theme.  "Snow White And the Seven Dwarves" proves why it's become a classic film.  This is great for all ages to enjoy.</p></br><a href="../users/A146D2LYLICNLS.html">A146D2LYLICNLS</a><br/><p>Disney's &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; is one of those classic films that truly deserve the title of &quot;classic.&quot; This is a true marvel of film-making, considering how long ago it was made, a time when animated technology was obviously still in its primitive stages. This is simply an astronomical accomplishment.<p>This Platinum Edition 2-disc DVD is what each and every fan of this movie has been dreaming about. Presentation is superb, both in terms of quality as well as bonus content. Sound and image have both been remastered and restored for an excellent viewing experience. And of course, the bonus features...so much of them that it can get overwhelming (not that I'm complaining!). I share the sentiments of some reviewers here who are upset about Disney discontinuing this title, but what's one to do. eBay is still the best place to buy a copy, if you don't mind paying quite a bit for it. I didn't buy myself a copy before it got discontinued but I found a brand new copy at a CVS/Pharmacy store (I kid you not) of all places. Yes, it is true. And what's even more unbelievable, I saw a copy for sale at another CVS store as well. And no, these are not pirated copies. I highly doubt every CVS will have one, but next time you're in there pay attention to their DVD stock. You might find yourself quite happy.</p></br><a href="../users/A3RNC9BGR4J1ZF.html">A3RNC9BGR4J1ZF</a><br/><p>This is one of my favorite Walt Disney classics I really did enjoy this it was so cute and entertaing especially the parts when her and the dwarfs sings and dance it is so nice I especially love the part when the prince kisses her and then she awakes and then the two of them ride off int he sunset!!!!<p>I thought it was terrible how the witch was able to give her the apple and then she  had went into a deep sleep!!!</p></br><a href="../users/AOVJYIUATQKR5.html">AOVJYIUATQKR5</a><br/><p>After much discussion our family ranked this Disney classic as their 6th favorite out of the 41 cartoon based movies we own.  Of all the old classic cartoons, SWAT7D probably contributed for to the Walt Disney World theme park than any other movie.  Snow White herself, the most evil bad guy, the step mother witch, the 7 dwarfs, the diamond mine, the poison apple and the mirror on the wall are all familiar pictures in the culture even today.<br />Some had said this is their favorite family movie and I can't blame them.  We only gave 7 of the 41 a 5 star rating, what we called the magnificent 7.  But, Mirror mirror on the wall, which is the best Disney movie of all?  The debate was fun.<p>We had a lot of fun by gathering the family together to rank the 41 Disney movies we have that include some cartoon work. All the kids, ages 6 to 27, participated along with mother and dad. Peter Pan is no Codfish, we rank it #2. Lion King was selected number 1 of the 41 as the family favorite, but narrowly. Peter Pan was 2. Pete's Dragon 3, Beauty &amp; the beast 4 and Sleeping Beauty 5.</p></br><a href="../users/A1C9GCHR99WX3F.html">A1C9GCHR99WX3F</a><br/><p>If you are confused by the title, it is supposed to be The one that started it all and still the fairest in the land. This was the first animated movie ever, and who knows if animation would ever be around if Mr. Walt Disney hadn't. And the has been a lot of animated movies that came out since, (too many to count) and Mr. Disney was around for most of them until his death in 1966. As the movie opens, a book opens and tells what happens to Snow White before the book is not seen. Every day Snow White's (Adriana Caselotti) stepmother the queen (Lucille La Verne) askes her magic mirror (Moroni Olsen) who the fairest in the land and the answer is the same every day, it is the queen, until one day when the Queen asks the same question again. But this time the mirror gives clues to Snow White. The Queen is so mad that she sents her huntsman to kill Snow White. But the Huntsman can't do it, so he tells Snow White to run away and never come back. (That part so like 1994's The Lion King). There was only one animated movie that was nomianted for best pitcure and that was Beauty and the Beast.</p></br><a href="../users/A2W00XKTTF1G0Z.html">A2W00XKTTF1G0Z</a><br/><p>All I can say is Bravo Disney!<br />The interactifve menus alone are worth this DVD.<br />Very visual, very creative.

But the bottom line is that the FILM is what makes this DVD great.</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>Remastered and remarketed as the movie that started it all, SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS remains a triumph of animation.  Using the Brothers Grimm tale about the princess with the skin as fair as snow who is taken in by a group of seven dwarfs, Walt Disney fleshed out the characterization of most of the main players while also watering down some of the more graphic and disturbing elements of the story.  The movie had been in production for years and Disney gambled his entire future on the project.  However, the development took so long and the picture cost so much money that before its release it was known around Hollywood as "Disney's Folly".  But, Disney put the critics to rest and the film would become not only one of the most beloved animated films, but one of the most popular films of all time.  The success of the picture paved the way for Disney to expand his company from a small in-house production company that created mostly shorts to a major Hollywood studio.<br /><br />The plot of the movie is rather straight-forward.  Princess Snow White's stepmother is a wicked and evil queen and the most beautiful woman in her kingdom.  She knows because she asks her Magic Mirror every day.  Then one day the Mirror reveals that her stepdaughter, Snow White is more beautiful than she.  The Queen is furious and orders a woodsman to take the girl into the woods to kill her.  He takes her into the woods, but cannot deliver the blow and tells Snow White to run. Snow White runs away and stumbles upon the cottage of seven dwarfs.  She becomes a kind of adopted mother for the little men and they shower their affection upon her. However, the Queen learns what has happened and sets out to put Snow White into a deathly sleep that only can be broken by true love's first kiss.<br /><br />Even though the movie is over 70 years-old, it's still gorgeous.  Audiences nowadays have become accustomed to the slick, chic, and sleek animation of CGI.  Those style of films are enjoyable to watch, but there is an eloquence and a personality of the old hand-style of animation that is lost when a film is done through CGI.  Since it was the first of its kind, SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS is one of the best examples of classic animation to watch.  For example, watch the scene where Snow White is getting water from a well and the camera shows us what it looks like from viewing up the well, through the water, ripples and all. It's a difficult scene that looks gorgeous and it was all drawn by hand. Simply magnificent.<br /><br />The Diamond Edition of SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS is basically the Blu-Ray edition of the movie with a DVD thrown in to try to lure people who don't really want Blu-Ray into getting Blu-Ray. The DVD only features an audio commentary, a music video with Tiffany Thornton, a sneak peak at the upcoming THE PRINCESS AND THE FROG, and a series of trailers for Disney DVDs.  Meanwhile the Blu-Ray discs are loaded with all kinds of features, but since I'm still not going to jump on the Blu-Ray wagon, I can't watch any of those.<br /><br />Overall, SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS is a must own movie for any Disney fan, film student, or person who enjoys animated movies. If you don't already own the movie on DVD, the Diamond Edition of the movie is worth getting because Disney will be putting the movie back into the vault and it won't be available again for years.</p></br><a href="../users/A3U56M0Y8LYO6J.html">A3U56M0Y8LYO6J</a><br/><p>"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" already owns a cherished place in cinematic history.  As the first feature length animated film made, it will forever be credited with expanding the possibilities of the medium.  Understandably, as a first effort, "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" comes across as simple, underdeveloped, and devoid of self-awareness compared to modern animated fare.  Yet this is precisely why it has maintained its charm throughout the years.  This film harks back to a simpler era when motion pictures were more concerned with creating magic on screen and less concerned with being relevant.  It is a work filled with passion and assembled with tender, loving care.  It is a work that has stood the test of time and which continues to endure.<p>Surely everyone is familiar with the Snow White story by now.  Snow White (Adriana Caselotti) is a young and beautiful princess who must escape to the woods to avoid being harmed by her wicked stepmother, the Queen (Lucille La Verne).  She takes refuge with seven dwarfs who each possess an apt unique name but a poison apple puts her under a harmful spell.  Thankfully Prince Charming (Harry Stockwell) arrives and, with a single kiss, thwarts the Queen's evil scheme and provides the requisite fairy tale ending.<p>Even though this film was released in 1937, the animation still looks magnificent today.  All of the character move fluidly and the attention to detail in the backgrounds are amazing.  The voice talent all distinguish themselves even though Snow White's voice sometimes gets on your nerves.  Yet, that aspect of the film is more than balanced out by the wonderful singing scenes with the dwarfs and the strong characterization of the evil Queen.  While later Disney films have surpassed "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" in technical and narrative terms, their first animated venture still remains a jewel in the Disney crown.</p></br><a href="../users/A2198FZZMTJ38H.html">A2198FZZMTJ38H</a><br/><p>Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of Walt Disney's first animated motion picture, &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,&quot; is the bizarre mix of images that strike the mind in various ways. It's rare in any day to find such a film that delights one with humor and enchanting music, and at the same time gets under the skin with a dark sense of dread and urgency underneath its conflict. &quot;Snow White&quot; is not only a technical masterpiece, but a true work of art that stands out among the very best in any time period of cinema. <p>For film historians, it stands out as a marvel of the achievement of technology. Being the first full-length animated feature of its kind, &quot;Snow White&quot; is seamless in its integration of detailed characters into articulately-drawn settings, with extreme attention of such details as water reflection, shadow movement, and even lip movement of the characters, an especially difficult task given the amount of song and dialogue. For this, it receives high marks all around, and earns itself a place in movie history. <p>It's the ultimate battle of good and evil, in which young Snow White finds herself the target of the Queen's growing jealousy. She flees into the woods, where she comes to the cottage of the Seven Dwarfs, who gladly welcome the new arrival. Just as their friendship together becomes increasingly joyful, the movie darkens the tone with the Queen's transformation into an old peddler woman, hoping to rid herself of Snow White's threat to her being fairest in the land once again. <p>&quot;Snow White&quot; is a special sort of film, one that is ceaseless in its ability to entertain the young and old. Watching it as a child is the ultimate experience, while watching it in later years will no doubt provide many with cherished memories of their first time seeing the film. It's the type of movie you find yourself looking back on with happiness and satisfaction, the mark of a truly great film.<p>Perhaps the movie's most memorable aspect is its contrast of light and dark imagery, a neverending foray for some of the most memorable scenes and images ever put forth onto the screen. Snow White's happy existence among the Dwarfs is full of glee and humor, and provides delight at every turn of the story. In complete contrast, Snow White's escape into the forest takes us on a terrifying journey through our own worst fears; the scene is charged with suspense and an intensity unmatched by any modern movie. The Queen's transformation scene is an absinthe-induced hallucination of dizzying images, and the final confrontation between the Dwarfs and the Queen is a suspense-laden race against time. <p>The film's most memorable trait is its musical score, filled with cheery melodies and upbeat tunes, from the infamous &quot;Heigh Ho&quot; and &quot;Whistle While You Work,&quot; to the operatic &quot;Some Day My Prince Will Come.&quot; Just as this music is full of joy, there are chords of music that are extremely unsettling, such as that of the opening shot, in which we see the castle looming over the river, set to high-pitched strings that set a foreboding tone. The music works with the movie to bring out the emotions it wants us to feel, whether it be overjoyed exuberance or nervous anticipation. <p>It's everything a perfect fairy tale should be, and the film captures not only the Grimm's tale magnificently, but also realizes the many ways in which fairy tales manage to work our minds. It takes us to a place in our fancy, the places we cherish and adore, and the places we would rather leave behind. At its center is a story full of moral truth and virtue, and every nuance is brought to stunning life with love and care put forth. &quot;Snow White&quot; is the ultimate masterpiece, a cherished piece of movie history that remains with you long after it has finished, and one that will be forever remembered.</p></br><a href="../users/A1WUMTJOASEL5F.html">A1WUMTJOASEL5F</a><br/><p>I am looking forward to the 2009 dvd edition because I have seen countless times my vhs masterpiece copy which still plays like a dream. True, I have quite a few dvd sets, but I am a diehard vhs fan with many still in current library and thanks to JVC for great dual systems to play alternate formats on one unit.<br />What I like about the discs are the compactability for on the go units such as laptop video units which I also have two of, and play very well, both Sylvannia & Go Video, so the convenience of watching my favorite movies or tv shows on discs is great. I also like the internet movies, but the discs I can view anytime and anywhere, and being my laptop videos are also battary operated is an added plus.<br />The features to these disc sets are also great, although I do find I dont have much time to look at everything, but I get them just in case the day comes I need extras to watch instead of the same film fare.<br />The recent Pinocchio platinum release just goes to show Disney movies just seem to get better with the revolution of video formats because the studios do extra enhancements to the film footage which make the color and sound vibrant with clarity.<br />The only complaint I have ever had with vhs format was the lack of freedom to skip randomly, and the need to "rewind" after each viewing whether the film has been entirely viewed or not.<br />So I look forward to another disney classic in my firm grasp such as this Snow White feature. It was a techno animated pioneer of its day when it introduced the first long length cartoon film which recieved many awards from the Academy. The animation still looks splendid with the effect of water color in landscapes. The songs are historical with Hi-Ho, and I cant count how many references Ive seen from many other non disney movies in regard to Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs lingo.<br />The intro scene of the queen consulting her magic mirror is the staple to disney villains. Snow White's eerie tree sequence as she escapes from henchman is still compelling and transfers well to the honored ride in Disneyland itself.<br />There are many historical facts to the making of Snow White as the frame by frame coloring of Snow White's rosey cheeks which was painstakingly done by disney artists. It's also a hoot to watch the live footage of men dressed as dwarfs which helped animators with the dance sequence. The queen transformation to the evil witch hag is one of the best fright night bits in movie history as her witch makes the biggest impression alongside the Wicked Witch of the Witch in Wizard Of Oz.<br />The final scenes of the dwarfs dealing with the poisoning of their princess is very well done and incredibly animated with reverence.<br />Snow White's prince, however, makes a very slight appearance throughout the movie and barely becomes much of a standout character because he is not given much to do other than become the apple of Snow White's eye (couldn't resist).<br />Needless to say, the seven dwarfs are the real stars because they are personality plus, and the cute animals all around are the charming backdrop to the whole feature.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>Nobody did animated features back in the 20's and 30's. The only one doing animation was some small companies and Disney, who were mainly making shorts. Walt had the idea of creating a full length feature. And while I do have some issues with the film, it's definately worth your time.<br /><br />The Queen is a very vain woman who can't stand anyone being more beautiful than her. There is one rival though: Snow White. The Queen sends a hunter to kill her but he spares her life and she runs off. She ends up finding an old empty cottage and cleans it and passes out. Meanwhile, 7 dwarves with distinctive personalities come home and find their house clean. Eventually, they become a big family and have fun but the Queen finds out she lives and so she poisons an apple that puts all who take a bite into a coma. The dwarves have to come and save the day.<br /><br />It's a great film full of memorable images, characters and music. However I thought it felt kinda long. When the dwarves come home, they took quite awhile before they actually find Snow White. I guess it's kind of the rookie feeling I have with the film. Disney hadn't really mastered having a long running time yet which they would greatly improve on. There is a wealth of extras also and they did a superb job restoring the film has there was a bit of color fading and scratches in the print.<br /><br />If you're at all into disney, I would definately suggest picking this up.</p></br><a href="../users/AWSYTZ2I2MW0V.html">AWSYTZ2I2MW0V</a><br/><p>There's some fairy tales that most EVERYONE in the world knows...SNOW WHITE and the 7 DwaRFS is one of them...and the DISNEY version to this tale is the DEFINITIVE...A CLASSIC from 1937!!!!

This would be the first full length animated film and the one that started it all for Walt Disney. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs tell the story of Snow White who is the beautiful step-daughter to the evil and vain Queen; full name is never given in the movie. The Queen dresses Snow White in rags and makes her work as a scullery maid. Everyday the Queen asked the Magic Mirror who was the fairest of them all and as long as the Magic Mirror told the Queen she was one sexy babe then Snow White got to live another. One day the Magic Mirror told the Queen she was no longer the fairest and the land and that Snow White was the new beauty babe in town. This upset the Queen to no end so she devised a plot to kill Snow White. The Queen tells the Huntsman to take Snow White to the hillside to pick some flowers and to kill her and to bring Snow White's heart back as proof of the jobs. The Huntsman could not bring himself to do the job and to tell Snow White to flee and never come back. Snow White finds shelter in the cottage of the Seven Dwarfs. The Seven Dwarfs discover Snow White in their cottage and decides that she can live with them, mainly because she can make gooseberry pie. Grumpy is the only who want her to scram because in his opinion women are nothing but trouble. To some husbands and boyfriends that statement may be true.<br /><br /> Well the Queen finds out from the Magic Mirror that the Huntsman did not do his job and as the old saying goes: "if you want something done right then do it yourself". The Queen turns herself into an old Peddler and creates a poison apple that will make Snow White take one long nap. The Queen, now an old hag, finds Snow White and tricks her into taking a bite out of the apple and Snow White is now in snooze land. The animals of the forest rush to warn the Seven Dwarfs and it is Grumpy that leads the charge to save Snow White. The Dwarfs chase and traps the Queen to a mountain cliff. The Queen tries to loosen a boulder to kill the Dwarfs, but a bolt of lightning strikes the cliff and she fall to her death; and you the folks out there already knows the ending to the story. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is a great movie to own and get an AAAAA+++++.<br /><br />VHS EXTRA<br /><br />Behind the Scenes of Pocahontas</p></br><a href="../users/A30IP5D5DLHRPA.html">A30IP5D5DLHRPA</a><br/><p>At first I was really skeptical at the idea of a 1080p version of a film made more than a half-century ago.  Blu-Ray renditions of classic films such as Top Gun and Ghostbusters leave considerably more to be desired since most movie watchers could care less about the plethora of special features per disc.  This begs the question of "why should we watch classics on Blu-Ray beyond two dozen different commentaries that couldn't be fit on a single DVD disc?  As such, I was curious to see how Sony would remaster the classic with Blue-Ray capabilities.<br /><br />After watching Snow White on Blu-Ray, my skepticism still remains albeit the film did, to a certain extent, exceed expectation.<br /><br />The film is, indeed, completely remastered in a fashion akin to how George Lucas re-rendered/restored numerous scenes in the original Star Wars trilogy (albeit w/o additional scenes).  The animation is considerably improved upon as the flow seems to be more fluid if not seamless.  It bears a certain resemblance to cell shading although that would be a reasonable stretch.<br /><br />Pertaining to the special features, I'll be bluntly honest here.  I could care less about the silly flash-esque games, the documentaries, storyboards, family game night features, sing-a-long, crap.  I'm sure some kids and film afficianados will appreciate said features, but to the majority of us movie watchers forking over the capitol to invest in a Blu-Ray player we typically have one thing on our mind; high definition viewing.  As such, I really cannot speculate on the alleged awesomeness that is the special features on the disc since I would rather throw in Uncharted 2 into my PS3 and play that instead.<br /><br />However, the digital re-rending/restoring of Snow White was impressive enough to justify obtaining the Blu-Ray copy over a regular DVD disc of the film.  Well done Disney!  Now bring out Beauty and the Beast and Lion King in Blu-Ray before I go buy Mass Effect 2 on my 360!  :P</p></br><a href="../users/A29R4FCO6RFX4K.html">A29R4FCO6RFX4K</a><br/><p>Disney's first foray into full-length feature animation was unsurprisingly measured a risky move for the studio that were best known for short Mickey Mouse and Sillie Symphony cartoons. But thankfully, SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS was acknowledged with critical eulogize and box office achievement, prompting the studio to continue making feature-length caricatures. This is an essential chapter in movie-making history, with so many amazing features; it really does define the word `classic'. One of my much treasured Disney movies, Snow White has all the staple ingredients for archetypal animation: a great story, fantastic animation, catchy songs and amazing imagery that still impresses after nearly 70 years. A perennial favorite, it paved the way for other grand movies (Pinocchio, Bambi, Fantasia, Dumbo et all) The DVD has great 'making of' material, including never before seen archive footage.  A must-have for Disney and film fans alike.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZVERVFM25MJT.html">A2ZVERVFM25MJT</a><br/><p>This, the first full length animated feature, is undeniably a classic in its own right.  It's still one of the few Disney films that truly manages to capture the horror of its original source.  Grimm fairytales are notorious for their morose tone, and several of the more menacing scenes from the book are brought to life here.<p>In the movie Snow White is draped in rough garments to hide her beauty from the jealous Queen, but when her magical mirror informs her that she is no longer the 'fairest one of all', she sends a huntsman to kill Snow White.  When our heroine manages to escape, her trip through the horrifying woods, with branches and hollows looming out at her from the shadows is stunningly realised.  When she is rescued by the seven dwarves, that movie becomes a little more comic.  Thankfully the dwarves are never overbearingly cute, but remain ultimately winning, especially the mute Dopey and stuck-in-his-ways Grumpy.<p>The most important thing about this movie is though that it never veers too far in one direction.  It mixes light humour with inobtrusive songs and colourful scares.  In particular the Queen's transformation into a hag is just so well done that it would rival even some of Disney's later and more polished films.  There's even a little play with the subtext of the sexual feelings that Snow White evokes in her hosts.  This is a Disney movie to treasure.</p></br><a href="../users/A3CCYAQRHUTPIQ.html">A3CCYAQRHUTPIQ</a><br/><p>Well, you know the film. I'm going to review the DVD, and it's quite a special DVD as well. For a start, the animation has been polished to within an inch of its life - the colours and so forth are extremely vivid, and although released in 1937 you can't tell from the film quality alone (the music and the 'look' of Snow White and the Evil Queen are very 1930s, however).<br />As the above list indicates, there are rather a lot of extras. As with Lucasfilm, Disney often get a lot of bad press for being stingy -  this is Disney's equivalent of 'Star Wars: Behind the Magic', in that they've gone to the other extreme and including almost anything possible.<br />Disc two has a couple of afternoon's worth of stuff, highlights of which include the various trailers dating back to 1937 ('See what the genius of WALT DISNEY has created!') and some galleries of concept art. It's odd looking at galleries of concept art from the 1930s - the animation and storyboarding 'work in progress' frames don't seem dated, and some of the throwaway pre-production illustrations are as gorgeous as anything in the film.<br />The menus are very nice, but as with a lot of flashy menus (the ones for MGM's 'James Bond' films) they get a bit tiring the second time.<br />There are deleted sequences, some audio clips, shots of live action test shots, short films on animation presented by Walt himself (looking surprisingly dapper), the works. There's even a short history of the Disney company itself, a piece of fluff which skims over the studio's dimishing artistic fortunes after the death of Walt, and has a blankly-smiling actress sum up the 80s as 'a decade of agressive investment and expansion!' and not, say, 'a decade of 'The Black Cauldron' and 'Tron''.<br />Disc one has the film, Barbra Streisand (for two minutes), some games, and an intriguing audio commentary by Walt himself, assembled from bits of interviews. It's a bit muddy and hard to hear, but that's definitely his voice talking. I haven't actually listened to it all the way though, but it deserves a nod for the effort involved (unless, of course, it's all faked and Walt isn't really dead at all).<br />To top it all, it's reasonably-priced. As a landmark in cinema, and as a classic Disney film, I can't think of a reason not to own it.</p></br><a href="../users/A141HP4LYPWMSR.html">A141HP4LYPWMSR</a><br/><p>To truly appreciate this film one should remember that `Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs' was released in '37 making it's production an incredible achievement in animation considering the overall state of the art at the time. This film was the spring board for the many Disney classics to follow in the years ahead making it a classic by that standard alone.<br /><br />However having that said, after all these years the film can still stand on its own merits. The animation is enjoyable, the soundtrack is enchanting, at times haunting and the seven dwarfs are beloved by millions around the world. It may not be technically the best of Disney's animated films but it was the benchmark of all that was to follow and still has a loyal fan base after all these years. A true classic.</p></br><a href="../users/A2I6MHMAZZDCRX.html">A2I6MHMAZZDCRX</a><br/><p>The Disney Company has over used the term Masterpiece when referring to its own movies.  But this one truly deserves that title.  While its animation betray its age, the story and characters are still fun, and its place in history also makes it a must.<p>The story is simple and familiar.  Snow White's wicket stepmother wants her killed because Snow White is &quot;the fairest of them all.&quot;  She is saved from this fate, and hides out with seven dwarfs.  But will the queen find her and try to kill her?<p>Walt's genius here was in creating the characters.  The dwarfs have very distinctive personalities, and some of the best scenes in the movie revolve around them.  (The scene where they first come home is a classic.)  The animals add some humor as well, especially when cleaning the cottage.<p>The plot moves along well, and when I first saw it in college, I was drawn into the story even though I knew the ending.  I actually felt tears when the dwarfs were morning Snow White.<p>By today's standards, the animation is flawed, especially for the prince.  However, there are some truly beautiful scenes as well, particularly the sun set when the dwarfs are coming home.  Fans of Disney in the 30's will recognize the feel of some of the silly symphony cartoons.  The important thing to remember when watching this movie is its place in history.  This is the first animated movie ever, produced when everyone thought no one would ever see it.  The fact that we're still watching it is a testimony to Walt as a filmmaker and pioneer.<p>This is truly a classic movie.  If you've never seen it, watch it today.</p></br><a href="../users/AY39CRKDV5L8S.html">AY39CRKDV5L8S</a><br/><p>Purchased this for my grown daughter - VHS just doesn't cut it - by the time a new format comes out - she'll have to buy her own</p></br><a href="../users/A22VNXHU6IZ5MT.html">A22VNXHU6IZ5MT</a><br/><p>Mirror mirror on the wall,this is the Disney classic that started it all!,coming in a great Blu Ray + DVD package,so you can play in it on your Blu ray Player or a standard dvd player,always good to have choices,since I have BOTH Blu and dvd players in my home/van.

Suffice it to say that it is the very first full length animated feature film ever made, that the gamble taken by Walt Disney paid off handsomely and the film in most respects was the catalyst for the expansion of his company into one of the biggest entertainment conglomerates in the world. The film spawned a whole new genre that has to a very large extent been the exclusive domain of the Walt Disney Company since 1937, and you only have to wander through the names of the memorable animated features that they have created to understand the impact they have had on family entertainment for the last sixty four years. Pinocchio, Bambi, Cinderella, Peter Pan, The Jungle Book, The Little Mermaid, Beauty And The Beast and The Lion King just to name a few of the many gems in their catalogue. And it all begin with Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs. Somewhat pretentiously, the Walt Disney Company have always afforded the film the appellation of "masterpiece" for its infrequent theatrical and video releases, but if there is one film in their catalogue that does live up to that pretentious appellation then it is Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs.<br /><br />Like just about every reviewer in the world, I am not going to provide a plot synopsis, for the story is so well-known that there seems little point in rehashing it again. Suffice it to say that anyone of any age, other than those born since its last theatrical incarnation in 1993 and video release in 1994, is unlikely not to have seen the film or at the very least heard of the story. In our modern world, the story is incredibly simple and to some extent quite quaintly naive, but simplicity is often a wondrous thing, for it is that simplicity that keeps the crowds flocking back to see the film on its occasional theatrical releases and to add the video to the collection on its infrequent video releases.<br /><br />Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs is a landmark film in every respect and is one of the true classics. Nothing more needs to be said other than to ask the question: has the DVD release done justice to the film? After eighteen hours of watching, listening and typing over six days, let me assure you that you are going to be buying one of the very best DVD packages we have ever seen, period.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AY3EV2MFRFGG.html">A3AY3EV2MFRFGG</a><br/><p>Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (chosen by horror novelist Ramsey Campbell as the most terrifying movie he has ever seen, well everyone as at least on traumatic Disney viewing experience in their youth - for me it's Bambi) set the foundation upon which ALL of Disney's follow up animated features would be built.  Any fan of Disney, or animated movies in general, will see this as a required addition to their libraries.<p>The almost limitless 'immersive' DVD features will take months to watch and allow people a rare look into the creative process of mounting such a technically challenging project (the first of its kind) as this.<p>The film itself looks flawless, no speck, no grain, no fading, the colors just as bright and vibrant today as they were in 1937.  It is a mint condition presentation of a platinum standard film that set the mold.  Not only highly recommended, but, as I said, a required addition to any film buff's library.</p></br><a href="../users/A26BWRBPP4V2WF.html">A26BWRBPP4V2WF</a><br/><p>It is probably pointless to review the film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.  People with much more experience, knowledge, and writing skills have waxed rhapsodic about the importance and enjoyability of this film.  I will mention the endorsement of my 2-year-old son, however: this is the only "Princess" film he has ever asked to see.  Granted, he often picks "Cars" over Snow White, but he certainly asks for Snow White a lot.<br /><br />No, readers of this review are likely more interested in the various formats and qualities thereof.  Here I can offer some insight.  This 3-disc Blu-ray edition comes with a DVD copy of the film (which includes some extras not on the Blu-ray copy, so make sure you watch them both).  I've had no problems with this disc, and it looks and sounds just as good on my TV as the Blu-ray copy (42", same sound system).  The Blu-ray copy of the film also worked fine, but has the same annoying problems that Sleeping Beauty had: if you stop the disc, you cannot restart from where you left off, but are instead subjected to the FBI warnings, Disney propoganda, and menu navigation to get back to where you left off.  When you have small children, they are not going to watch the film all the way through every time!  And they are going to play with the remote control, etc.  This is incredibly frustrating and is not a function of Blu-ray discs in general: my Simpsons Movie Blu-ray, for example, acts like a DVD when stopped and restarted.<br /><br />The third disc contains extras.  The extras are fantastic.  No, better than that: they are FANTASTIC!!!  The highlights include an audio commentary by Walt Himself pieced together from audio recordings made in the late 1930s.  There are also lots of interviews and short video clips of other workers, including video of the director(s) setting up the multi-plane cameras, sound engineers discussing the relative merits of the echos in the men's vs. the women's bathrooms, and a promo film on Disneyland.  But best of all, there are included many of Disney's short films, most of which I hadn't seen before.  There's "Steamboat Willy" of course (the first Disney film to sync animation with sound), "The Old Mill" (first use of the multiplane camera), Flowers and Trees (first Technicolour cartoon and winner of an Oscar), Goddess of Spring (Persephone is often considered Disney's first attempt at a "realistic" human female character), and several others.  These shorts, and the technical introductions related to them, are themselves worth the price of the disc.<br /><br />Unfortunately.... Disney's Blu-rays are almost too annoying to actually watch.  As mentioned above, pressing stop (or turning off the power on your player) automatically resets the disc to the beginning.  I have a PS3 player, with load times on the order of seconds (5 or 6 at most).  So it was with some annoyance that I pressed stop and then timed how long it would take to get back to where I was in the disc.  The total time: 2 minutes and 33 seconds.  This is not straight running time either - I stood in front of the machine pressing the "Menu" and "Fast Forward" buttons on the remote whenever I had the chance.  Two and a half minutes to resume a film after just pressing "Stop" to go to the bathroom is unacceptable.  Having to watch the FBI warnings and Disney ads AGAIN is unacceptable.  Is Disney trying to drive people to piracy?  Because that is the effect that technical issues like this will create.  Memo to Disney: do not punish the people who are trying to be honest and actually buy your movies.  (And I didn't even mention the fact that I had to update my software before it would even let me watch the thing in the first place!  Aanother hour down the drain...at least I didn't have the kids crying because they couldn't start watching it right away.)</p></br><a href="../users/A2UQIIJ2CD8REE.html">A2UQIIJ2CD8REE</a><br/><p>In 1937, Walt Disney changed cinema forever with a little animated film called, "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs", the first feature length, hand-drawn cartoon. It's the classic Grimm Brothers fairytale of a beautiful young princess who escapes a murder plot by her jealous stepmother, the queen, and is taken in by seven kindly dwarfs who live in a forest cottage and spend their days mining for precious jewels. One fateful day, after the wicked queen has discovered through her magic mirror that Snow White is still alive, she uses her talent for witchcraft to create a cursed, poison apple, disguises herself as an old hag, and journeys out to finish Snow White once and for all. The only flaw in her plan is that true love's kiss can break the apple's spell.<br /><br />Simply put, "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" is a masterpiece. This is in no way an exaggeration. It may take a look at this Blu-Ray release's vast bonus features for much of the modern audience to truly appreciate how and why this film is such a masterpiece, but it is nonetheless. Even though this was Disney's first animated feature and the style reflects it, the amount of love, sweat, and tears poured into its making give it a unique and  enchanting richness only Pinocchio and Bambi even come close to. Snow White transports you to another world as only a few films can do. It is an old European storybook come to life. All the character designs and hand painted settings are glorious and an amazing advancement for the time. The Queen is one of the greatest screen villains ever, ruthless in a frighteningly believable way. All the songs are unforgettable classics, and while some have mocked Snow White's high-pitched voice over the years, Adriana Caselotti was the perfect choice for the sweet and innocent lead role and always sounds much better when viewing the film than we remember between distant viewings. And to guys like me who LOVE animated girls, while it is hard to compete with the modern Disney girls like Ariel, Belle, and Kim Possible, Snow White is truly a classic beauty and still very gorgeous. I always remember her as my first cartoon crush, alongside my first non-cartoon crush, Dorothy in MGM's Wizard of Oz. Funnily enough, it was the success of this film that allowed Oz to get the green light. Snow White not only has influenced films and filmmakers to this day, it also paved the way for a variety of types of films we have all loved so much, especially by earning respect for the fantasy genre.<br /><br />This new Diamond Edition Blu-Ray/DVD release of Snow White comes to us just in time for the Halloween season, and it's one of those Disney features that is just perfect for it! Old witches and poison apples just scream Halloween! We get 3 discs in the set: A Blu-Ray which holds the feature and a few bonus features, second Blu-Ray disc that holds the bulk of the bonus features, and a third disc that is a standard DVD of the feature film. It's a wonderful package that Disney is doing with all their Blu releases now, it seems, and I wish other studios would follow suit. Those of us who love buying Blu greatly appreciate getting standard DVD copies too for our other TVs in the house that maybe aren't upgraded yet, or for travel or computer use. For some reason, most of us DVD collectors just continue to be resistant when it comes to those pesky (and wasteful) digital download discs; nothing there to collect, really. I'm glad we aren't plagued with one of those things here.<br /><br />The feature film just looks and sounds incredible here, like never before! Truly gorgeous on Blu-Ray. Even if you own the previous DVD release, it's worth upgrading just for that. The Bonus Features are wonderful too, and there are tons. The previous (Platinum Edition) release of Snow White did hold much of what we have here, but there's lots of new stuff too, especially the Hyperion Studios Tour feature that showcases most of the Bonuses on Disc 2. There's a wonderful audio commentary by film historian John Canemaker and Walt Disney himself via archival audio clips on Disc 1 and several art galleries on Disc 2(I love the character design ones and the live-action reference stuff; also love promotional galleries). Disc 1 also holds a new music video for "Someday My Prince Will Come" as sung by the Disney Channel's Tiffany Thornton (not one of my favorite, current Disney Channel stars, but she does a good job with the song), a delightful look at the opening sequence of the upcoming "The Princess and the Frog", and an amazing look at two deleted scenes that were once planned to be used for a Snow White sequel short cartoon! I really found that last thing intriguing, and it's too bad they don't go ahead with that project today making use of the existing animation! After all, it's been long enough I think that it wouldn't hurt the integrity of the original (I mean, it's not like writing some new sequel that is totally focused on modern sensibilities and pandering to a toddler audience). It'd be wonderful to go to a new Disney feature and see that lost Snow White short playing before it. Also on Disc One are some games that are surprisingly fun, and a special feature that allows you to insert yourself into clips from the film using BD Live. There's also a how-to for using Disneyphile copies (the digital copies, ugh), even though Snow White didn't come with one. Oh, and before I forget, Disc One is also equipped with the "Disney View" option, so if you have a widescreen TV, which Blu-Rays are basically made for, you can activate to have the black bars on the side of this properly fullscreen film replaced with artwork meant to blend in with the film's backgrounds. Frankly, I tried this and found it distracting. Beautiful artwork, but in some scenes it didn't look right to me, like the forest stuff.<br /><br />As for more of what Disc Two holds in the Hyperion Tour section and beyond, as I said, there are galleries, but there are also tons of audio clips and featurettes that really do an amazing job of taking you back to the days Snow White was being made. You really get a feeling you're exploring the old Hyperion Studios with Walt and the animation legends; or more often, sitting in a room with them and listening to them reminisce. The stories are fascinating. An important thing to note here is that the story of the making of Disney's Snow White is very much the story of the early development of Disney animation and animation as a film medium in general, and the Bonus Features on Disc 2 do an amazing job reflecting and focusing on that. This is all about the beginnings of Disney animation. It's in depth, touching (if you're a Disney fanatic like me and your childhood dream was to be one of these great animators), and so much fun to explore, though there is thankfully an Index for when you don't feel like getting to things the long way.<br /><br />There are many classic Disney shorts on Disc 2 as well, emphasizing the importance of Disney's previous works in leading up to the masterpiece at hand. The Old Mill, Playful Pluto, The Goddess of Spring, Flowers and Trees, Babes in the Woods, Musicland, Steamboat Willie, and The Skeleton Dance can all be found on Disc 2. And a final couple of bonus features ported over from the previous DVD release are the delightful retrospective "Disney Through the Ages" and the "Dopey's Wild Mine Ride" game. The game is pretty fun, and the retrospective is very fun. It also includes many Snow White theatrical trailers to break up each of the decades talked about, each hosted by a different "Disney" personality. I must admit that I was a little miffed that my disc kept skipping during the Fess Parker/1950's section though. One always hopes the newest technology will leap the hurdles of flaws like skipping. It seems Blu-Ray isn't the technology to leap that hurdle, and I was watching it on a PS3, which are darn good players. Unfortunately, it's not as simple as saying I can watch this featurette on my old DVD if I really want to, as this Blu-Ray features an updated version with new segments hosted by John Ratzenberger, including a new decade! Well, it's a good feature anyway and I envy those who get to watch it unflawed. Oh, and there is one more bonus feature: a Heigh Ho sing-along. I don't get much use out of those as bonus features though. Can't we just turn on the subtitles during the film?<br /><br />All in all, this new Blu-Ray release of Snow White is outstanding and definitely a must own, even if it's a double-dip for you. I won't say it's without flaws though (and I'm not just talking about my skipping Fess Parker segment). There was a nice chunk of wonderful bonus features that were not ported over from the previous release, and there is just no excuse for that. Every new, grandiose release of a film on home video should include all the bonus features of its predecessors. That should be understood. Okay, games and things of that nature I can understand leaving off, but not deleted scenes, alternate songs, live action reference footage, and so on... This just means the true fan must hang on to his or her older release too, and that doesn't do much to encourage double dipping. But, again I say, this release is well worth it. It's a must have. But DON'T toss out your old Platinum Edition if you care about bonus features. The Diamond Edition has great ones, but it lacks some too. Most importantly though, the film itself has never looked better and belongs on the shelf of every film aficionado and Disney fanatic.<br /><br />Also recommended for fans of Snow White: Pinocchio, Bambi, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, The Black Cauldron, and all other Disney animated films! And go see The Princess and the Frog in theaters! More recommendations: Fantasia, Enchanted, Disney's Silly Symphonies (and the Walt Disney Treasures Collections in general), Snow White: A Tale of Terror, and all the Cannon Movie Tales, but especially Snow White in this case. There's also a Hallmark Snow White TV movie, but I only recommend it if you are entertained enough just enjoying the beauty of Kristen Kreuk (as I am known to be at times). Also often recommended to me is the mini-series "The 10th Kingdom", though I've yet to see it, and I know Filmation made a Snow White Christmas Special and their own Snow White feature sequel. I can't comment on those. I recently acquired them (they are available in one DVD set with Journey Back to Oz) but haven't gotten around to viewing them.</p></br><a href="../users/A3QNQQKJTL76H0.html">A3QNQQKJTL76H0</a><br/><p>Fans of Disney animation should be very happy to see Snow White finally arriving on Blu-ray. Widely derided as "Disney's Folly" by journalists and industry insiders of the time for its long and costly development cycle ($1.4 million was a staggering sum in 1930's Depression-era America), Snow White was Disney's first feature-length animated film and nearly bankrupted the studio. Walt's determination won out and Disney went on to build the entertainment empire that we know today. Now, old meets new as this cherished classic comes to hi-def with a sparkling new transfer. Newly remastered and digitally restored, this "Diamond Edition" looks and sounds fantastic, having been given all the care and attention that a film of this cultural and historical significance deserves (it was added to the National Film Registry for preservation by the Library of Congress in 1989). Snow White is notable for a number of cinematic firsts and technological innovations which set the standard for the animation industry (discussed in the special features).<br /><br />For $20, this is a great value, and there is plenty on this 3-disc set for young or old to enjoy. The first disc contains the movie, audio commentary culled from Walt Disney's interviews interspersed with comments by film historian, some interactive games, and 2 deleted scenes. The second disc is a vast collection of archival footage, photos, and history, all in HD. The third disc is the DVD edition, for viewing where Blu-ray isn't available. This item is identical to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00267N3DQ">Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (DVD/Two-Disc Blu-ray + BD Live w/DVD packaging)</a>, except that one has Snow White on the cover art and a black DVD case. The Blu-ray edition has the evil queen/hag and a standard translucent blue Blu-ray case.<br /><br />First, the picture quality: Disney has done a stellar job restoring this 72 year old masterpiece and given the film plenty of breathing room with a 50GB disc. There is not a hint of discoloration, fading, frame jitter, darkening, or yellowing throughout the film. According to the DVD insert, 360,000 frames of negative were scanned and digitally restored in a year-long process. This TLC is evident from the first few seconds of starting the film. Colors are steady, vibrant and fresh, looking like a painted storybook come to life, as it was originally intended. I did notice some specks and uncaught artifact when I went looking for them by standing right in front of the TV, but under normal viewing conditions from 4-6 feet away on your couch, these are not noticeable. I also did notice some unnatural halo outlining in some scenes, especially near the beginning of the film. A strange fuzz encircled the pigeons in the scene where Snow White is singing at the well. Again, I only noticed these flaws when I scrutinized the video up close. Most people will not notice unless it's pointed out to them.<br /><br />New to this edition is "DisneyView", a marketing term for how Disney fills up the black bars around the side of the screen. The original film was 1:33, so watching it on today's wider HDTVs will result in black vertical bars. DisneyView is just simple watercolor backgrounds, like curtains or stone pillars. They change when the scene fades to another scene. I found them distracting and turned them off after a few minutes. It felt like I was being boxed in.<br /><br />Audio: The original mono recording has been re-engineered for 7.1 surround. I only have a 5.1 for testing, and sound is clear and strong, sounding every bit as good as a film that was produced today.<br /><br />Extras: The commentary track from interviews culled from Disney archives is interesting to listen to, although film historian John Canemaker can be a bit dull at times and a bit too academic, dropping too many nerdy name and film references that will escape ordinary viewers. Being the great storyteller that he is, Walt's segments are always a joy to listen to as he talks about various aspects of the production.<br /><br />BD Live took a minute or more to load, but it seemed longer. From previous experience, BD Live is usually the worst part of any Blu-ray  experience. There's a feature called "Scene Stealer" where you can upload your face and it'll be superimposed over the scene. It seemed a big hassle to operate and I didn't bother. Similarly, a few games are included that you control with the remote, like an image guessing game called "What Do You See", and a jewel matching game, but I'm not a big fan of such features as usually the controls are awkward.<br /><br />Disc 2 contains a whole treasure trove of historical footage, interviews, and images. The content is divided into departments (animation, inking and painting, music, etc), each represented by black and white photography onscreen, with slick fly-throughs linking the rooms all together. There's a lot to see here, although getting around the different departments is a bit cumbersome. Different objects or parts of the room light up when you push the remote control arrows (usually 3 or 4 items per room). Luckily, there is an index link that lists everything (show as a map, with subsections all listed in a column along the right). Here you'll find the famous "Steamboat Willie" and a lot of early Disney shorts like "Skeleton Dance", "Flowers and Trees", "Goddess of Spring", "Playful Pluto", and several others. Some of the segments are very short, lasting only 1 to 4 minutes. These discuss various aspects of the production process and I would've liked for them to have been longer, but it was a genuine joy to see footage from 1930's America.<br /><br />In summary, this is a set every film and animation lover should own. This is a disc you and your family will enjoy for years to come.  The $20 price tag is very reasonable and you're getting a lot of material here. The second disc alone is about 2.5 hrs of content. I hope Disney continues this level of care and attention to upcoming Blu-ray re-releases of other classics like Dumbo [Blu-ray].</p></br><a href="../users/A2C7BOQVFH1HLE.html">A2C7BOQVFH1HLE</a><br/><p>This is not just a dvd of the original full feature length animated movie of the 1930s but is a whole entertainment device all by itself.

For adults like me, I still found myself fully enjoying this DVD and especially for the well remastered visuals and the Dolby 5.1 surround sound option in addition to the old mono original.<br /><br />This Platinum Edition Series is a brilliant idea that is very well executed by Disney and it leaves me very interested in getting all the other movies in this series such as "Beauty and the Beast" as well.<br /><br />Full value for money and well worth getting for your kids.<br /><br />Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>I was amazed how fantastic this film looked in the 2 disc Platinum Edition DVD!

This is the way to treat all the Disney animated classics, completely restored and unedited with lots of extras. Come on Disney! Haven't we given you enough of our money!? Please stop editing these historical pieces and give them the treatment they deserve. If you must edit them, then release them both ways.

I was able to buy this 5 Star Disney Princess classic recently for my young princess through one of Amazon's third-party sellers. And without that opportunity, my little princess may have outgrown Snow White by the time Disney released it again.<br /><br />Let me just say that my little one was absolutely captivated by Snow White, and to think that she would be deprived by Disney itself from seeing it at her perfect age is criminal.<br /><br />The story is familiar enough to any parent, so I won't go on about that other than to say that of all the Disney Princess classics, Snow White and Sleeping Beauty have some scenes that might scare a young princess under the age of 5.<br /><br />But you should take advantage of purchasing Snow White or any of the other "off-the-market" Disney princess classics like Beauty and the Beast now via one of this site's resellers if you have a little princess of your own that might not appreciate it as much when Disney decides that it's time.<br /><br />And indeed, you will enjoy Snow White or any of the other Princess classics as thoroughly as your young one.<br /><br />Side Note: The Amazon description says that this page is for the REGION 2 release which will not play in most US DVD players.

Yet when I watch a wonderful classic film like this all is forgiven. One caution the movie could be frightening to very young or fearful children. The Queen and her mirror are really scary as are her various plots to kill Snow White. I don't think the typical kid over seven would be afraid of it especially since there is so much comic relief from the dwarfs and the cuddly animals though the film is somewhat of a curious mix. I do find Snow White's singing and speaking voice annoying as well as her role of little homemaker but you have to remember she is a product of the late 1930's and appreciate the film as a hallmark of that time.</p></br><a href="../users/AYQF4Z1EQDACU.html">AYQF4Z1EQDACU</a><br/><p>It was almost 10 years after Walt Disney and the mouse he created became worldwide household names, that he gave Hollywood the first ever full length animated feature "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs". One of the greatest American films of all time, one of most renowed and the animated film to have the most releases from 1937-1993. An important masterpiece that is was once called "Walt Disney's Folly" but, who said that was very wrong, the film was immediate phemonenon and the highest grossing film of all time till it was knocked by "Gone with the Wind" I've been a fan of Disney for a long time and I know of all the animated films this is the one to see first. Snow White was only the begining, cartoons still stayed with Disney, but Snow White was Walt's turn to the movies. If you love Disney  as much as I do then see the most celebrated animated film of all time, the merriest and scariest of them all. See the one that started it all and still the fairest one of all.

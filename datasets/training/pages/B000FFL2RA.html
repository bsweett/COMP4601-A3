Much to my interest, "The Director's Cut" came my way. Curiously, some "Director's Cuts" are just a few sunsets added, along with 5 or 10 minutes of some guy riding a horse across admittedly spectacular scenery. Happily, this is not one of them.<br /><br />The added material in fact gives a lot more to the plot, and I agree with Ridley Scott that some of it should never have been removed. The subplot about Sybilla's son added more to the political intrigues, which I felt made the movie much better, giving it more substance. In short, the Director's Cut was much more interesting to me than the original release.<br /><br />The characterisations and the depth they receive with the added material also make a richer and more rewarding movie. In some parts, Orlando Bloom seems a little contrived, but overall the acting is first class, to match the first class cast.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed this DVD package in all respects. Honestly, I would be surprised if anyone finds it inferior to the shorter versions of the film. It is very thorough in all respects, including the supporting materials on the other 2 discs. This is an excellent movie version and the package is well worth getting.</p></br><a href="../users/A19VMQDCB4HZ9P.html">A19VMQDCB4HZ9P</a><br/><p>First off this film is much better than Troy and Alexander combined. Ridley Scott's direction shows that he hasn't lost the ability to manage epics of this size. His talent as a former cinematographer and art director shows in spades in this film. The color palette changes from the cool, almost black and white scenes in France to the blistering earth tones of the scenes in the Middle East. If one can find any faults in Kingdom of Heaven it won't be for its art direction and cinematography. There are faults in this film, but not enough to ruin the film or slow it down the way it did for Troy and, to a greater degree, Alexander. The story seems to not want to create a specific bad guy to root for. Even the characters whose motives and behavior scream "villain" can be excused by their religious veiwpoints. This is one film where everyone involved makes decisions that can be seen as good or bad depending on the individual audience's point of view.<br /><br />The cast did an admirable job in getting lost in their roles. One specific stand-out has to be Ghassan Massoud's portrayal as Muslim General Salah al Din (Saladin to the West). Massoud has presence and is actually one of the few characters who seemed to go beyond the petty, religious politicking this film has piles of. I must admit that I never really believed Orlando Bloom as the character of Balian of Ibelin. He makes a convincing enough knight, but never as the protector of Jerusalem. Eva Green makes for nice eye candy, but I looked closely enough at her character develop and she did a better job as a young married princess much too cynical and old than what her appearance and age would suggest.<br /><br />But most people will come to see Kingdom of Heaven for its many battle set pieces. Outside of The Lord of the Rings battles, Scott's work in pulling off the battles between the Crusader and Templar armies against those of Salah al Din would count as some of the most brutal and massive engagement in film history. Scott did his homework well for these set pieces. As a military history buff I'm usually more critical of epic films depicting historical battles on film. There's not much to be critical about the accuracy of the Siege of Jerusalem. The final battle does look like it owes some of its execution to the Siege of Minas Tirith in the end of LOTR.<br /><br />The film succeeds well enough in recreating the fight for Jerusalem and the politics involved from all sides. The acting is very good overall though a few casting choices could've been made better. Overall this film is very underappreciated. Maybe people are not ready for an intelligent film about a contentious time involving two of today's major religions.</p></br><a href="../users/A109LWN9DUGPDP.html">A109LWN9DUGPDP</a><br/><p>I didn't expect much from this movie after hearing what i heard about it and for about the first 45min. or so of the film i thought the assumptions were correct but after that the movie really picks up,if you liked Troy or even Alexander this movie is better than either of those.It may start slow to tell a story but hang in there you may be pleasently surprised!</p></br><a href="../users/AQUVTQFFXP4AC.html">AQUVTQFFXP4AC</a><br/><p>Being as my experience with director's cuts involved moving scenes about, adding a few deleted scenes, and/or changing the ending (even Ridley Scott's director's cut of Blade Runner did little more than remove the ending and the voiceover), I was vastly surprised to find out that this movie had been so thoroughly butchered for a theatrical run that the "director's cut" comes out to be a whole movie in itself rather than "oh hey, he says an extra line different from the movie".<br /><br />While the extended cut adds only about 45 minutes of film, it feels like it adds a whole new half to the movie, which makes it seem for the first time like the theatrical cut was actually "half" of a movie.<br /><br />Spoilers might follow.<br /><br />A lot of new scenes include minor tidbits for entertainment, while the majority of it has further explanation, exposition, and even a full subplot that had been not quite masterfully cut from the theatrical version.<br /><br />- The whole dealy involving the priest Balian kills is explained, as it's revealed the Priest is Balian's half-brother, the legitimate son of their mother, who had Balian as a bastard.<br /><br />- It's revealed that Balian had fought in wars before, and thus had a reason for putting up such a strategic defense of Jerusalem---there is even a scene of him discussing the tactics in properly fortifying a city like Jerusalem with King Baldwin IV<br /><br />- Godfrey is shown to be the brother of the village lord where Balian lives, and the lord is the one who sends the attack raid on Godfrey.<br /><br />- Salah ad-Din beheads Reynald, which is considered more historically accurate.<br /><br />- A whole entire sub-plot is re-inserted regarding Baldwin V---Sibylla's son.  After Baldwin IV's death, Sibylla crowns her son King, only to discover after accidentally spilling hot wax on his hand that like his uncle, he has leprosy.  Rather than suffer the backlash of the people on knowledge that she has birthed a leper, and that she may lose her power for it, she kills her son with poison to spare him the leprosy and herself the loss of power.<br /><br />- Emotionally devastated by killing her son, Sibylla's actions afterwards are more recognizable and understandable beyond "she's an idiot".  Guy de Lusignon knows about the affair she's had with Balian, and uses this against her to get himself crowned King of Jerusalem after Baldwin V dies.<br /><br />To add benefits to this set is a vast collection of documentaries focused on all aspects of making the film from pre-production to post-production, working with actors from well-known Orlando Bloom, to newcomer-to-American-audiences Ghassan Massoud as Salah ad-Din, to even acknowledging the bad reviews the theatrical film received, which prompted the release of the director's cut.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NL1KW56O3JR8.html">A3NL1KW56O3JR8</a><br/><p>This is defiantly no "Gladiator" but it's pretty good over all. I wish Neeson had a bigger role (and I never much cared for Bloom). The plot is a little forced--it has a somewhat choppy, pieced-together feel, like it's rushing to get to the good parts. Even so, there are a couple of really cool (if slightly clich&eacute;) scenes. The attempt to work in not-so-subtle comparisons to modern-day extremism in the Middle East was a touch clumsy, however. If you like "one-man-against-the-world" movies, then KoH will probably work for you.</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>I had missed seeing KINGDOM OF HEAVEN when it was originally in theatres.  Since its release on DVD I have heard many positive things about the movie and finally was able to view the movie for myself.<br /><br />The movie takes place during the Middle Ages and revolves around a blacksmith named Balian (Orlando Bloom).  Balian's wife committed suicide after the death of their child and he finds himself alone and living in a village where very few of the other villagers like him.  Lord Godfrey (Liam Neeson) returns home to find Balian, his long lost son and ask him to return with him to the Jerusalem, the Kingdom of Heaven.  At first Balian refuses, but after murdering a priest Balian joins his father in hopes that in fighting in Jerusalem he can be given absolution for both his and his wife's sins.  Jerusalem is somewhat unstable.  The King of Jerusalem, Baldwin IV (Edward Norton) is a leper with no heir to the throne.  Baldwin is a good man and has been able to maintain a peaceful existence with the surrounding Muslim nations.  Baldwin lived longer than anyone expected him to, but each day that passes finds him weaker.  His sister, Sibylla (Eva Green) will inherit the throne after his death and there are several factions fighting amongst themselves for control of the city after Baldwin dies.  Balian enters the scene and wins the trust of some of the nobles, such as Tiberius (Jeremy Irons) and the King himself.  Balian also wins the affections of Sibylla which causes her supposed soon to betrothed Guy de Lusignan (Marton Csokas) to hate Balian more.  Knights Templar under the direction of Guy force a war with the Muslim warrior Saladin (Ghasssan Massoud) after which Balian finds himself forced to be true knight for the people.<br /><br />I know that this version of KINGDOM OF HEAVEN wasn't the version director Ridley Scott had attended.  His version of the film is about an hour longer, but I haven't seen that one yet.  This version of the film is the version that was seen in theatres and as it stands by itself, it isn't too bad of a movie.  The acting is strong through most of the cast.  Orlando Bloom has taken a lot of slack for giving a poor performance, but in reality he doesn't do to bad of a job.  It is true that Bloom is really too much of a pretty boy to be playing Balian (knights weren't always the best looking people around), but the weakness of his character comes not from his performance but from the writing of his character.  The opening scene is supposed to form empathy with the audience, but it doesn't do that.  Therefore, a connection with Bloom's Balian is never really made.<br /><br />The movie has some great action sequences and the cinematography is spectacular.  Great lengths were taken in making detailed weapons and costumes and the siege of Jerusalem is one of the most accurate scenes of siege warfare about an actual real life battle that I have ever seen on screen.  Ridley Scott did a great job of bringing this film together.<br /><br />However, it doesn't work as well as it could have.  Much of this is because Scott's version of the film was cut dramatically.  There are points in the movie where you can tell a scene is missing.  I believe that the other reason the film isn't as powerful as it could be is because of the writing.  Characters that should be written strong, such as Balian, aren't.  Other minor characters come off being more important than they should be while characters that should have a crucial role to play in the film, such as Saladin's sister, aren't on screen more than a few seconds.  KINGDOM OF HEAVEN was William Monahan's first major accredited script so these flaws might just be the learning curve of a major screenwriting.<br /><br />KINGDOM OF HEAVEN is a pretty good historical picture.  It's a decent film to introducing people to the Crusades, but it's also just a fun film to watch on a Saturday night.<br /><br />This DVD version of the script includes a text commentary, some behind the scenes featurettes, a History Channel special entitled "History Vs. Hollywood--Kingdom of Heaven", and a special that aired on A&E called "Movie Real:  Kingdom of Heaven".  The History Channel companion piece is the better of the two major special features.  It starts off with Ridley Scott and the major actors talking about the film and then segue ways into examining the Crusades, Crusaders, Medieval castles, and Medieval weapons.  The A&E special is atrocious, though, and is basically a piece of propaganda.  The Movie Real feature is anything but real and includes conversations with the actors of the film as if they are real historians.  Half of the historians in the piece have a severely biased and flawed view of the Crusades and the time in history that THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN takes place and instead of introducing information that the film in someway ignores (such as the fact that Balian had an older brother named Baldwin), these historians perpetuates many of the myths of the film.  For example, none of the historians ever mention that before any of the Crusades started that Christians had been persecuted by Muslims and were no longer allowed to visit the Holy Places in Jerusalem as they had been doing for centuries. There are many more documentaries about the crusades and I would advise watching one of them and just ignore the `A&E Movie Real" altogether.</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>(Please note: This is for the 4 disc director's cut--for some reason this is combined with ALL versions of the movie including the Blu-ray. The Blu-ray features ONLY the first two discs of this set on one Blu-ray disc. None of the discs with extras are included as part of the package).<br /><br />Sometimes longer is better particularly when you have a complex story. The theatrical version of "Kingdom of Heaven" was flawed from the beginning with significant narrative gaps that undermine the character development and the smooth momentum of the story. That's because Fox had Scott cut the film by nearly an hour deleted significant and important character development at the expense of trying to fit in more showings per theater. The result was a sprawling ambitious project that had the epic scope of "Lawrence of Arabia" without the narrative strength. Thank God for DVD. "Kingdom of Heaven: The Director's Cut" restores the material demonstrating that the original 3 hour cut was a brilliant film that played theatrical late last year after the film had bombed at the box office. The reason the film bombed was the idiotic decision to cut the film and make it shorter reducing the film's impact. While it might not have made a huge amount of money it would have done well at the box office as a prestige film AND would have deservedly been nominated for Oscars. Much of the background story is fleshed out and the relationships between the various characters are more clearly defined. "Kingdom of Heaven" is a magnificent epic film that recalls the power of David Lean's epics and allows Scott's historical drama to breath. If you've seen the theatrical cut you owe it to yourself to see this major film from a major talent.<br /><br />The film is presented like the "Lord of the Rings" deluxe sets with the film spread over two discs. Featuring a beautiful anamorphic transfer this version of the film actually looks superior with less issues with digital artifacts when compared to the previous edition of the film. The 5.1 audio presentation sounds wonderful with both a 5.1 and 5.1DTS track that makes exceptional use of the format. You'll feel like you've put plopped down into the middle of the battle sequences in the action sequences and there's wonderful ambient sound effects sprinkled throughout the film even during sequences that are dialogue driven.<br /><br />Special features are terrific in this set. We start off with an introduction by Scott discussing the "Director's Cut" compared to the theatrical version of the film. Featuring Scott, writer William Monahan and actor Orlando Bloom the first commentary track (it was recorded separately and pieced together) becomes a rich resource of trivia beginning with the origin of the project and how Scott and Monahan ended up working together. The second commentary track has visual effects director Wes Sewell, assistant director Adam Somner and producer Lisa Elizey discussing the technical aspects of the shoot and the challenges they faced covering everything from the use of digital and on set effects to second unit photography. The last commentary has editor Dody Dorn discussing the two different versions of the film. We also have production notes and information about the shooting of the film provided as text commentary.<br /><br />The third and fourth discs have most of the supplements. Unfortunately neither has the excellent A&E documentary that was part of the two disc set so you may want to hold on to your other set if you haven't sold it already. We have "The Path to Redemption" presented in six separate parts with each running anywhere from a half  hour to twenty minutes a piece covering the making of the film.  The first of the three parts include text, images, early screenplay drafts and notes on the shooting of the movie. The second part has cast rehearsals covering everything from the training with the weapons to costume tests. The third of the three parts has storyboards as well as a short documentary featuring scholars discussing the accuracy of the film.<br /><br />The fourth disc features the last three parts on the film and includes video shot on location, storyboard galleries and photo galleries as well as deleted/extended/alternate scenes with optional commentary by Scott and editor Dorn. There's also a section on the visual effects of the film as well as various sound elements to create the unique sound mix of the film presented in various stages. The last section features trailers, TV spots, the Showest presentation. There's also footage from various premieres around the world, poster galleries, footage of the press junket shot on video, image and poster galleries as well as a brief featurette similar to the one done for "Gladiator: The Extended Version" that discussed the creation of this special edition.<br /><br />An exceptional film that was badly butchered by Fox prior to its premiere due to skittish leadership at Fox, the film has finally been presented the way it should have been in the first place. Fox DVD has done an exceptional job in putting together this package and has made amends for the way it handled the film when it was released theatrical last year. Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A268EEWUXYCA8Q.html">A268EEWUXYCA8Q</a><br/><p>UPDATE: I originally wrote the following because of the notice that there would be an eventual extended edition of the movie.  The update is that Amazon.com now has a listing for said extended edition that comes in at 191 minutes and is to be released on 23 May 2006.<br /><br />I wrote a review for the theatrical release of this film which I will post below if you are curious what I think.  I really wanted to just point out that if you enjoyed this film, you might not want to purchase this version.  Back when the movie was first released in theatres, Ridley Scott was interviewed and stated that there was almost an hour taken from the movie.  He also said there would be a director's cut that would have that material restored.  Its not being released now, presumably, so that the studios can get their double dip.  Look at Sin City (the "longer extended cut" comes out in December 3 months from its original release date) or Saw which is coming unrated this month to support the sequel.  It happens all the time.<br /><br />Overall, I think the film is decent and I am curious to see what was cut out.  I just don't want people who are interested to waste their hard-earned dollars because the studio wants to double dip.  Take what I'm saying as a grain of salt because things can change and I'm no "insider" so I can't say for absolute certainty that they will release the director's cut, but there is an interview out there with Scott about the director's cut.  So, my recommendation (take it for what you will)?  If you enjoyed the movie but wanted more, wait for the inevitable directors cut  :)<br /><br />For those interested, my original review for the theatrical release is pasted below:<br /><br />When epic films come out, people usually fall into two categories without even seeing the movie: they are excited to see it or they roll their eyes and yawn. I happen to fall into the first category. Epic historical war films like Gladiator, Troy and now Kingdom of Heaven (just to name a few) are a lot of fun to me. There's nothing like seeing boulders of flames lighting the night sky as they explode into castle towers, etc.<br /><br />From what I've gathered through the media and through friends of mine who are history buffs, the film is pretty accurate as far as movie epics goes; I am not a history buff so I couldn't tell you. Ridley Scott does a good job of mixing fictional (Orlando Bloom's Balian) and historical (The leper king, played by Edward Norton in an excellently subdued role). Complimenting the battle sequences is a rousing score by Harry Gregson-Williams who has done everything from the video game Metal Gear Solid 2 to Shrek. They also sample a song from the Prayer Cycle by Johnathan Elias which is achingly beautiful. Overall the sound fits the theme and the time period admirably well.<br /><br />The story is pretty standard epic film stuff. You have the unwitting hero, the possible love interest, the possible love interest's evil husband, all engulfed in the massive Crusades that are tearing apart Jerusalem. One thing I am glad for is that I feel Ridley Scott and screenwriter William Monahan did a more accurate portrayal of the Crusades by showing not only the religious side of events but also the socio-political and economical themes that pushed the war forward.<br /><br />I think Orlando Bloom has been criticized perhaps too strongly in this movie. Most professional reviews comment that he is too "pretty boy" for the role. It's almost as if critics are trying to pigeon hole him and type cast him into that role. I'm not trying to defend Orlando Bloom, but it never really struck me as the "fish out of water" character casting that professional critics are demanding it is. Sure, he relied on the look of a puppy dog who's lost his best friend a little much, and yeah he has that "pretty boy" look I suppose but come on, if you don't allow someone to do something different, you're just reinforcing his type cast which leads to a vicious cycle.<br /><br />You might feel that even though the movie is a good 2 hours and 25 minutes that it felt like something was missing. And, that's probably because something was missing, about 80 more minutes. In an interview with Ridley Scott, he mentioned that the theatrical cut is not his cut and that he was planning on releasing a directors cut on DVD that encompasses an amazing 220 minutes. I suppose the production company decided they didn't want to have an almost 4 hour movie in the theatres right now and so decided to chop sometime off, but according to reports with Ridley Scott that's not what he wanted to happen exactly.<br /><br />Going with the cuts and the story, I think part of what was left out might have been more of Saladin's point of view. It seemed as if the movie wanted to show both sides as there were moments were we saw dissent on the Arab side as well as a hint of some motives. I'm hoping that this was something we'll see more of in the DVD cut because it creates a better picture of just what was going on.<br /><br />I would like to say that it would be better to catch this on DVD so one could see the movie in its entirety, but fans of this genre know that the best place to see these movies is in the theatre. Just know that when it comes out on DVD it will be more complete. It's a pretty good epic film. There were some nice fighting sequences and the final siege of Jerusalem leading up to the climax was stunning. Personally I enjoyed it much more than Troy and Alexander of last year. It might not live up to Ridley Scott's Gladiator right now, but come DVD it has a chance I think.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>This movie, unduly BASHED by critics, was not half bad.  I enjoyed the storyline, and the acting as a whole was decent.  The battle scenes as well as the scenery itself was breathtaking and even rivaled those in Troy.  I have to say, to me the strongest charactor was Marton Csokas who played husband to Eva Green (who also did a great job with what she had to work with) and subsiquential heir to the throne.  Orlando Bloom who I will say is a fine actor handled his role well, or as well as can be expected.  Although I feel that Colin Farrell did a far better job in Alexander (my opinion) I was surprised to see him buff out for his role here.  He's got nothing on Crowe, Bana or Pitt for that matter but he did decent.  Edward Norton as the leper king was a treat...he's a great actor who can tackle anything spendidly.  It's a story to be told and thats a great thing.  I love epic pictures and this is one I will watch again and one that I am happy was made.  It's not like it couldn't have been better, but the point is that it's still really well done.  Just because he's no Crowe doesn't mean he's not good.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KD8NJPZ01R37.html">A1KD8NJPZ01R37</a><br/><p>There's a ton of bone-crunching, writhing of swordblades and shields a'clashin. No doubt, it's good action. BUT, Orlando probably wasn't the best choice for the role, and the story is just so bland. Liam Neeson is in it for a whopping 90 seconds.<br /><br />Your thinking "Ridley Scott; it's got to be awesome". But alas they gave him a budget for good production value but the rest just sucks. It's definitely worth a look, and good for some mindless action, but you'll have buyers remorse if you purchase.</p></br><a href="../users/A2AVV9LV9UXT6F.html">A2AVV9LV9UXT6F</a><br/><p>Despite what other reviewers have said, this movie is not "Muslim apologetic".  Sorry to break it to some people, but Reynald de Chatillon REALLY WAS an out and out, thoroughly contemptible, rapacious brigand.  Guy de Lusignan may not have been QUITE as bad as he is portrayed in this film, but the real Guy was close enough as makes no difference.  In fact, he was so repugnant that the Knights Hospitalers did in fact leave Jerusalem rather than serve him (which means David Thewlis' character should have survived, as he wouldn't have been at Hattin).  The Templar grandmaster (whose name is not given in the film, but whose name, in history was Gerard de Ridefort) REALLY WAS a cruel, fanatical bigot.  Ridley Scott is not being unduly harsh in his portrayal of these men.  They really were evil.  Other facts to ponder.  The crusaders really did massacre the inhabitants of Jerusalem when they took the city in 1098.  Saladin really did refrain from returning the favor when he took the city in 1187.  The crusader army really did make an incredibly stupid blunder and leave a secure position, marching across open desert without water, and was utterly crushed at the Horns of Hattin on July 4, 1187.  Saladin really did spare Guy's life after the victory at Hattin, saying: "it is not the custom of kings to kill kings".<br /><br />The story is dramatized, and Scott and his writers made liberal use of dramatic license.  But the basic facts of the story are not too inaccurate, and the portrayal of Guy, Reynald, and others among the crusaders is not unfair.  Nor is Scott heaping undue adulation on Saladin out of PC multiculturalism.  Saladin really was known as a chivalrous and merciful opponent -- so much so that he was revered as a chivalric ideal throughout most of Christian Europe, despite being a Muslim.  This is not revisionism; it's accepted history.<br /><br />Another criticism I have read here is that this movie portrays every man of faith as evil.  I have to wonder if the reviewer who said that saw the same movie I did.  Scott doesn't portray all men of faith as evil; he portrays the fanatics as evil.  The same reviewer said the "atheist" knights were the only good ones.  What atheists?  Balian wasn't atheist.  He fears he has lost his religion, yes.  But he also torments himself as being unworthy, and abandoned by god.  No man would worry about being rejected by a being he doesn't believe in.  The Hospitaller, played by David Thewlis is also a good man, and a man of faith.  He is a member of a religious military order, is Godfrey's confessor, and states at one point that he believes Christ would not order men to commit the crimes that the Pope is ordering them to commit.  King Baldwin, admonishes Balian that he must ultimately answer to God for the things he does in this life, and it will not excuse crimes or wrongdoing to say that others ordered him to it.  These sure don't look like atheists to me.  The two other good men we see in the film, Balian's father Godfrey, and Tiberias, played by Jeremy Irons, never say much about their religious views one way or the other, so why assume they are atheists?  And finally, Saladin, in the movie, though not a Christian, is clearly shown as a man of faith.  At one point he weeps over the bodies of his soldiers who were killed in the assault on Jerusalem, and he prays to God as he does so.<br /><br />If you don't like the film on its artistic merits, fine, that's your priviledge.  But it seems that some of the critics are bashing it for political reasons, and worse, are doing so based on a very distorted view of the movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A10X0JN8KTK89H.html">A10X0JN8KTK89H</a><br/><p>Kingdom of Heaven confronts religious extremism as the bane of all evil. Using the Crusades as a backdrop, Christianity and Islam square off nearly 1000 years ago just as the major religions of the world do today. Battles over Jerusalem and concerns about what the city means to the world have been at the center of much human suffering for centuries. The tone of the film is greatly enhanced because its main character isn't particularly religious, and the film dissuades the viewer from taking sides, creating no demonized enemy, but rather a mesh of human beings being humans. Thus, this film is a true epic about our actual lives and histories and not about those men of virtue and bravery and evil and cowardice who exist only as abstracted myth.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Orlando Bloom is cast in this film. He simply does not have the charisma to carry a movie as its star. He has only one or two expressions throughout the entire film, and he is completely surrounded by great actors who make him look silly. This drags the movie down for me, because he has a lot of screen time. I love the ideas behind the film, but I don't like it when I'm watching a film and just know that I'm watching an actor try to act and fail.  I have yet to see a convincing performance by Bloom and cannot understand why he is so popular. At least someone like Keanu Reeves has charm despite his inability to act consistently.<br /><br />The romance is completely copied and pasted. Boring.<br /><br />In the end, the film is average to me.  It tells a familiar tale, but I will admit that the timeliness of the film is at least interesting.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IOJE0W1NXOSE.html">A1IOJE0W1NXOSE</a><br/><p>Orlando Bloom plays a blacksmith who has tragically lost his family and then is persuaded to fight in the Crusades by his father, who is played by Liam Neeson.  Unfortunately, after Neeson dies, the quality of the acting goes down throughout the film.  The "holy" war is fought with the usual bloody battle scenes, and the characters neatly divided into good and evil (some on both sides) for which Hollywood is famous.  The film has action, a love interest, fairly accurate history, but unfortunately not much heart.  The leading characters are never engaging enough to cause the viewer to really care about the outcome, and thus the movie becomes lots of sound and fury.  The one point that it does make is that nothing much has changed in 1000 years--Christians and Muslims are still fighting over control of the Holy Land.</p></br><a href="../users/A1V3PCKVCJ3TTZ.html">A1V3PCKVCJ3TTZ</a><br/><p>I can watch this movie over and over again.

This is another excellent release produced by Charles de Lauzirika, the man behind Ridley Scott's other great special edition releases such as Gladiator, Black Hawk Down, Legend, Hannibal, Thelma & Louise, Matchstick Men, and Alien.  I cannot even imagine, especially after Kingdom of Heaven on four discs, what Lauzirika will accomplish with the upcoming Blade Runner set.<br /><br />Anyway, this is the Director's Cut of Kingdom of Heaven.  If you saw the original, you hopefully enjoyed it, yet realized that it was in fact a very flawed movie which moved at a very unnatural pace especially in the first act.  This version is over three hours long, the other is about two and a half.  The only thing sad about this is that if this Director's Cut would have been the version to hit theatres, this film would've gone somewhere instead of no where.  The footage that has been brought back into this cut has turned the movie into a much more believable tale.  When you realize what was taken out of the theatrical release you will be astounded.  It's amazing to think what story elements were sacrificed only to get an acceptical running time.<br /><br />If you're a fan of the movie than you've got two discs worth of a 3+ hour movie to watch here, which includes a few commentaries for that running time.  The 3rd an 4th disc are packed.  Think of the 2003 Alien Quadrilogy combining with the Lord of the Rings Extended Edition DVDs.  Nothing is left out on these 4 disc, and if you own the original release, then you've got 6 discs worth of Kingdom of Heaven to cherish.<br /><br />If you're a Ridley Scott fan and really wanted to like the film when you first saw it in '05, then this is the version that you'll be satisfied with as long as you can sit through its running time, and I doubt that sitting through a movie this great would be that big of a problem.  I'm not kidding, the original ranges from a 7 - 8/10; this cut ranges from a 9-10/10, it really is that much of an improvement and should really be made the official version of the film.<br /><br />I highly recommend getting this DVD, even if you just liked Gladiator or something.  It's an excellent movie, and IGN's "DVD of the Year", so what are you waiting for?</p></br><a href="../users/A2T7TZBOTP68C7.html">A2T7TZBOTP68C7</a><br/><p>The Crusades was no place for sissies.  Early scenes of this film contain some of the most brutal battle action I have seen. Kingdom of Heaven follows Balian, a mostly unlikeable antihero (Orlando Bloom) who goes to Jerusalem at the behest of his dying father, (Liam Neeson) whom Balian never knew.  His father was a powerful man, and he asks his son to protect the innocent Muslims who will die if a certain Knight Templar takes power in the holy city.  Bloom seems miscast physically as the sword hefting and swinging required to survive seems to need much more physical bulk.  Nor does Bloom's warm, sexy, engaging personality shine through this particular character, either.<br /><br />But overall, the film brilliantly explores the root of Muslim-Christian antagonism, the result of which we are seeing today in the same Holy Land, now called the Middle East.  Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KJ6JAZPH382D.html">A3KJ6JAZPH382D</a><br/><p>Stacked up against "Troy" and "Alexander," Ridley Scott's look at the Crusades holds up the best of the trio. First off, he seems to be taking the least liberties with the history of events here. (Even if you want to refer to legends as history.) Orlando Bloom, who seemed to do little more in "Troy" than look like a chick magnet for Helen, has a lot more to do here and carries himself well as the unwilling action hero. The battle scenes are terrific (as you would expect from Scott's exceptional "Gladiator").<br /><br />What really carries "Kingdom Of Heaven" is the supporting cast. Liam Neeson gives his role as Balian's father gravitas, Kings Baldwin (Edward Norton, who does receive recognition in the DVD's credits) and Saladin (Ghassan Massoud) offer the moral center with Tibereus (Jeremy Irons) as the pivot between the good of these men versus the blood-hungry Knights Templar as well as the more eager generals among Saladin's forces.<br /><br />Detriments? Well - there are a couple. The sole two female characters here serve no real purpose other than to give the men something to move the plot along with. Saladin has a sister who appears long enough to get captured and (since you never see anymore of her other than Reynaldo {Brendan Gleeson} tearing away her veil) have something awful done to her. Eva Green seems to exist as the Queen of Jerusalem merely to add a love triangle. "Kingdom Of Heaven" is a guy movie, and the fight scenes outweigh the need for female character development. But Scott is too good a director for that, so all the warriors, good and bad, operate at a level other than spouting lines before battle.<br /><br />The moral compass of this movie is also solid. While some reviews here are argumentative about Saladin being "such a good guy for a Muslim," a movie like this (or "Troy" and "Alexander") can't work without the leaders being noble, even as the underlings plot around them. If we weren't at war, would the movie still look the same? My guess would be yes. The idiots that are too full of themselves to look at reality would still march off and get slaughtered, Jerusalem would have still fallen (even if historically the surrender was bloodier and more costly - Saladin reputedly took the wealthier of Jerusalem's citizens for ransom before allowing them 'safe passage' out), and the good guy would still get the girl. If the movie's end proves anything, we are still gullible to our own fanaticism; Richard The Lionhearted rides off to attempt to reclaim Jerusalem for the crown and the cross.<br /><br />One of 2005's best, and I have a feeling "Kingdom Of Heaven" will gain in stature as the years pass.</p></br><a href="../users/A9LAPV8XNKZVZ.html">A9LAPV8XNKZVZ</a><br/><p>Yeah, little heat in romance but this is a war epic.

The man is magnificent!<br /><br />Yeah, we never got to see the true acting possibilites, Bloom always playing second rate roles, never a primary actor. But he really can hold scenes well by the strength of his acting. And this movie proves it.<br /><br />Kingdom of heaven is a wonderfully done movie by Ridley Scott (Gladiator) the history is pretty much accurate, and jerusalim is breathtaking...and huge. Some of the fighting scenes look like they could have been a cut off from LOTR, but then so did Troy. Not to say they wheren't awesome, but the part where Orlando leads his small band of horsemen into Saladin's army is a definate throwback to the scene in Return of the King, where Viggio leads his party into the circuling orcs at the gate into mordor...but I regress.<br /><br />Bloom comes back looking like he did in the Pirates of the Caribbean, a little more mature and handsome, but long hair and scruffy look just the same. Alan Rickman (Hitchiker,Dragonheart)is here also, as the crusader bent on following god and the king. His scenes aren't long, but what he does have shines.<br /><br />However, don't go looking to watch this movie as being light entertanment. For those who have watched Gladiator this is pretty much the same. Lots of head slashing, blood and neck cutting. Doesn't get much realistic then this. Besides, its enough just keeping up with the history portrayed in this movie to keep you focused. Otherwise you'll miss alot.<br /><br />Truly enjoyable, a real feast for the history buff and those that love good movies</p></br><a href="../users/A3VQSFORKH8B7O.html">A3VQSFORKH8B7O</a><br/><p>When Ridley Scott goes to make a film, he always seems to have a clear view in mind. but when studios tell him to tinker with his films, his vision ends up getting diminished. Such as what occurred with "Kingdom of Heaven." Although I enjoyed the 144-minute theatrical version, I also noted that the first half of the film did suffer from under-developed characters and rushed storytelling, but was made up for by top-notch visual effects, some good performances, and superb battle scenes. Still, something was missing from the origianal version.<br /><br />But what was missing has been restored in Scott's superb director's cut. The film has been extended to 194-minutes, mostly adding plot and characterization, that gives the film more of a soul. Now, instead of a good action-epic, we get a film more on the lines of "Gladiator:" a character-driven historical epic, with fine performances by the main stars. I believe that if Scott had been allowed to release this version in the theaters, a great number of the cast and crew would've been up for Oscars.<br /><br />The DVD presents the film in a Roadshow presentation that would've been normal for a film of this kind back in the fifties and sixties, and features fine picture and sound. The special features are also fascinating, giving insight into the making of this epic film, and the reasons why it may have failed here in the states.<br /><br />Overall, this version of "Kingdom of Heaven" is a masterpiece of film that ranks with films like "Gladiator," "Alexander," and "Braveheart" as one of the greatest historical epics of our time.<br /><br />Movie/DVD Grade: A+</p></br><a href="../users/A220FJEQNGMSRN.html">A220FJEQNGMSRN</a><br/><p>Kingdom of Heaven turns out to be Ridley Scott's best film since Blade Runner, largely because for once his visuals are matched with a pretty good script that doesn't feel like an afterthought. While most critics, aware of the longer director's cut on the horizon, found it rushed, I had no such problem: true, the film has the quickest shipwreck in screen history and the love story quickly disappears (a shame, because Eva Green gives the film a lightness it otherwise lacks), but for the most part it's journey is well told. Nor is it overly politically correct - the Muslims might be more honorable than some of the Crusaders, but that doesn't make them any less ruthless. Its biggest structural problem is the siege finale, which for all the impressive visuals pales besides Orlando's last couple of efforts at the battlements, The Two Towers and Troy, and unfortunately feels rushed and underpowered and ultimately overstylized. We're never in the thick of it, either emotionally or visually.<br /><br />For a film about religious and moral ideals, it's a curiously untriumphant epic dealing with the failure of reason and compromise. Even it's hero's attempts to live a decent life becomes a part of that failure: when offered the chance to save the city from war and get the girl, his knightly code will not allow him, condemning the people of Jerusalem to war. That, and the fact that it's a film about a loser may well be part of the reason for the film's failure to find an audience in America, but it's also one of the things that makes it so interesting. Even though it's full of historical errors, it does encompass the ebb and flow of a state of mind in a point in history surprisingly well.<br /><br />Orlando Bloom is far from disastrous even if he's not quite good enough. He does the grim and serious stuff well, but he doesn't offer much else: there's no light or shade to the performance, just a conscientiousness that isn't exactly wrong for the character but still leaves you hoping for something more as the third act comes along. If he's not exactly two-dimensional, he does at least manage one-and-a-half more dimensions than Clive Owen did in  King Arthur and never embarrasses himself as much as Colin Farrell did in parts of Alexander. The supporting cast are mostly on good form, although Edward Norton seems to be doing Anthony Zerbe's leper turn from Papillon as the dying king.<br /><br />The film was shot largely with real extras for all but the largest crowd scenes, which plays real dividends here. Aside from giving you a sense of a world outside the main characters, it also highlights one of the real limitations of CGi extras: their failure to interact with the elements. It doesn't feel like a computer game but a conflict involving real people, which helps ground the story and give it a sense of weight. John Mathieson's photography is infinitely superior to his overpraised work on Gladiator even though he does overdo the dreariness of Europe.<br /><br />Harry Gregson-Williams' score is competent, but it's telling that much of the film needed to be scored with several cues from Graeme Revell's Crow, Marco Beltrani's Blade and, most effectively in the "Rise a knight" sequence, Jerry Goldsmith's Valhalla prayer from The 13th Warrior - so don't be surprised if you find yourself suddenly wanting to see one of them straight afterwards!</p></br><a href="../users/A220FJEQNGMSRN.html">A220FJEQNGMSRN</a><br/><p>Kingdom of Heaven was probably my favorite film of last year, and the 194-minute director's cut gives the film more room to breathe, but it won't make converts of the unbelievers. Instead, it's a more leisurely paced version of the film for the faithful who liked the theatrical cut and want to revisit its world and characters in a little more detail. Closer in style and tone to sixties roadshows than Scott's Gladiator, and all the better for it, in many ways it's the richest and most ambitious of the recent batch of epics. It's more of a journey in the extended version, and a bloodier one (the added violence will please the gore hounds), although there are a few moments that tip over into self-indulgence and could have been tightened or omitted entirely.<br /><br />The extended opening allows more character detail, but at the expense of more of Michael Sheen's caricatured greedy priest, now revealed as Balian's brother. Orlando Bloom's limitations are also given a little more room than they had in the theatrical cut, but he certainly never stoops to the lows of Gerard "I'm wonderful, me" Butler in Beowulf, Colin Farrell's Alexander or Clive Owen's truly catastrophic non-performance in King Arthur that left that film with a void at its center. Edward Norton's performance as the Leper King suffers a little from using different takes than the theatrical version, and at least one of his expanded scenes is simply longer without really being any better than its equivalent in the shorter version. The real winner in the extra footage stakes is Eva Green, who I think I'm falling in love with and whose part is considerably expanded and much more complex, allowing her a mass of contradictory motives (few of them noble), impulses and emotions that were smoothed away in the theatrical version. The subplot involving her son also helps add more of an emotional charge to Baldwin's death, with the shot of his leprous face no longer gratuitous but essential. In fact, in this version of the film, there are even a couple of genuinely touching sequences.<br /><br />While the added complexity in this cut is more in the characters than in the plot, some of the problems of the theatrical version have been addressed. The shipwreck is just as rushed in this cut as in the theatrical version, but the pacing problems in the astonishingly spectacular siege finale are much improved by the addition of a fairly minimal amount of footage. It no longer seems quite so hurried and there's more of a sense of the human cost after the battle at the Christopher Gate that was lacking in the shorter version by the simple expedient of including characters we briefly get to know among the dead. There IS one massive miscalculation after the siege where a redundant swordfight has been added: not only is it completely ineffective, dwarfed by the sheer scale and weight of what has come before, but it's also unnecessary, winding up a plot point no-one cares about any more and simply underlining the events of the previous scene.<br /><br />It also now comes with added Bill Paterson, which is rarely a bad thing, especially since his brief scene as a compassionate Bishop establishes the incompatibility of fanatical adherence to religious law with the actions of a loving savior that is one of the film's major themes. Although most of the Christian clerics here are transparent hypocrites, they are also counterbalanced by David Thewlis' Knight Hospitaler just as the `good' Muslims are counterbalanced by fanatics as both Saladin and Baldwin have to walk a tightrope with their own people to prevent war.<br /><br />Thanks to a strong script this is easily Scott's best film since Blade Runner. Unlike Gladiator it doesn't feel like it was written on the hoof, and he has enough confidence in the material not to overdo the stylistics at the expense of the storytelling: here the visuals serve the picture, which isn't always the case in his past work. Even John Mathieson, probably the worst cinematographer to ever win an Oscar, finally delivers the goods. CGI is used sparingly and very effectively when it is (none of the poor FX problems that plagued parts of Gladiator here, thankfully). Instead, much of the spectacle is shot for real - not only is it usually cheaper, but it's certainly a lot more impressive to look at.<br /><br />The transfer quality is not as good as on the theatrical version, but it's more than acceptable. The extra features on the 4-disc set are impressive (or what I've seen of them), including a deeply depressed screenwriter mulling over its US failure. Of the additional deleted scenes included as extras, there's nothing that needed to go back into the picture: most are ideas that didn't really work while a couple are just plain silly. The DVD also includes an interesting collection of trailers and TV spots that try to sell it as everything from The Passion of the Christ II in an outrageous piece of false advertising involving adding a "Don't worry, God is with me" line of dialog not in the film (particularly ironic considering its Humanist viewpoint and the crisis of faith of its hero), a family movie, an epic adventure, a country and western rock video and a kick-a** heavy metal teen bloodbath: anything to avoid mentioning Muslims or, God forbid, history. Can't think why this didn't take off at the US box-office...</p></br><a href="../users/A1NLZVP501JM5Z.html">A1NLZVP501JM5Z</a><br/><p>I know most people will disagree with me when I say this is a better movie than Gladiator but it is.

Yes, it is a mammoth production with enough spectacular sets, battle scenes, violence and atmosphere to satisfy even the most ravenous Big Picture appetite. But is also has a fine script (written by William Monahan) that elects to focus on a rather intimate series of stories that have sensitivity and tenderness and, perhaps more importantly, offers some historical background for understanding the ongoing battles over the city of Jerusalem.<br /><br />Balian (Orlando Bloom) is a recently widowed blacksmith in France in the 12th century whose long absent nobleman father Godfrey surprisingly informs him that Balian is his son and pleads with him to accompany him to Jerusalem for the Crusades, a challenge Balian slowly accepts.  Godfrey is killed in battle but manages to bestow his knighthood on Balian before he dies, leaving Balian to assume the important role of humanist in the multifaceted struggle for power that exists in Jerusalem.  King Baldwin of Jerusalem (Edward Norton) lives a holy life hiding his leprosy behind a mask and bids Balian to protect the people of the city of Jerusalem against not only the evil undermining of the Knights Templar led by Reynald (Brendan Gleeson) and the incipient King of Jerusalem Guy de Lusignan (Marton Csokas), but also against the Saracens led by Saladin (Ghassan Massoud). Balian  is assisted by mentor Tiberias (Jeremy Irons) and by his innocent love for Sybilla (Eva Green) who unfortunately is the wife of Guy! Balian remains true to his ideals of knighthood.<br /><br />The military logistics of the various battles are a bit confusing to follow as the variation in uniforms is minimal.  But it is Balian's ever-present protection of the people of Jerusalem that leads to the historical moment that ends the siege of the city well described in history books.  The film ends in a manner that emphasizes the importance of humanity over greed, lust, war, and destruction and opens the path for compassion for the centuries long schism that still afflicts the holy city.<br /><br />The cast is excellent with small roles made large by such fine actors as Michael Sheen, David Thwelis, Velibor Topic, among others. The musical score is a magnificent blend of Western ecclesiastic themes (including Bach!) with  Eastern ones under the writing direction of Harry Gregson-Williams. John Mathieson is responsible for the vivid cinematography.  But major kudos go to Ridley Scott for making what could have been a loud blood and guts period piece into a film with a quiet heart and soul. KINGDOM OF HEAVEN is an inspiring  film to see.  Grady Harp, October 05</p></br><a href="../users/A2UL0A8GJB4318.html">A2UL0A8GJB4318</a><br/><p>Nothing.  Everything.  On its' surface, "Kingdom of Heaven" seems like everything desirable in a giant scaled monolith of an epic.  Director Ridley Scott (Gladiator) flexes his visual  muscle, and he shines in overwhemling battle sequences, aided by John Mathiesons' sweeping camerawork and Dody Dorns' forceful editing, both of which are crafted with extraordinary skill.  A picturesque cast attempt illuminate a story about religious conflict that has overt parallels to today.  But "Kingdom of Heaven" commits the cardinal sin of epic moviemaking: it let the story play second chair to its' own visual splendor.  "Kingdom of Heaven" is not unsalvagable, but nothing is a better catylist for the audiences' indifference than a two and a half hour epic that is content with a second hand story and a first class look.  It expects the audience to be accepting of shoddy goods delivered in a lovely package.  The trick doesn't work.<br /><br />"Heaven" opens in twelfth century France, when a young blacksmith named Balian (Orlando Bloom) takes up his father's (Liam Neeson) challenge to venture to Jerusalem on Crusade, but only after he kills a priest for desecrating his wifes' dead body.  Balian now has two reasons to travel to the Middle East.  Being in a Crusade with absolve him of his sins and that of his wifes,' who committed suicide.  The Crusades themselves are in full, bloody swing, as rival Muslim and Christian armies vie for the Holy Land.  Some are fanatical.  But all fanatics are outdone by the Knights Templar, led by Guy De Lusignan (Marton Csokas) and Reynald (Brendan Gleeson).  The Christian zealots, looking for power and wealth, bide their time as they await the death of the young, leperous but progressive King Baldwin (Edward Norton uncredited), who has fashioned a fragile peace with his contemporary, Saladin (Ghassan Massoud).  The Templars eventually get a golden oppurtunity, potentially spoiled by the presence of Balian, who Baldwin admires and his sister (Eva Green) takes a liking to.<br /><br />Even though the film is fatally flawed, that does not mean it still has plenty going for it.  Ridley Scott still stages battle scenes with muscular verve, and the sieging of Jerusalem is spectacular.  He's blessed with a great supporting cast.  Edward Norton and Ghasson Massoud embody understated grace as leaders trying to hold a peace and hold onto the prospect of a better future even as religious wars flare around them.  Liam Neeson once again proves no one is better than him at playing the wise mentor and Jeremy Irons still purrs with his gravelly tenor, giving emotional weight to the kingly advisor Tiberias, a warrior who sees the Crusades clearer then almost anyone around him.<br /><br />But all of those strengths are peripheral to the main plotline and Bloom.  The films' credibility is stretched too far by debut screenwriter William Monahan, who makes Balians' journey from lowly blacksmith to superknight too abrupt and too easy.  Once he reaches the Holy Land, the new Crusader has the foresight to dig a well on his inherited land (which apparently his father never thought of doing beforehand), hold court with the King and his templar rivals and command armies in battle.  The scenario is too implausible to believe and the film feels distant because of it.  Bloom, to his credit, gives the role everything he's got, trying to register the look and feel of a man caught up in extraordinary circumstances, but he simply does not having the acting chops needed to pull it off.  Director Scott at times seemed to be preoccupied with the crafting of the film, letting Balians' plot arc flounder.  With so much promise in their movie, Scott and Monahan sadly let it slip, and it's a shame.  It could have, and should have been so much more.</p></br><a href="../users/A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX.html">A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX</a><br/><p>Ridley Scott again shows his mettle and sure hand with action films full of the violent and spectacular scenes and melees that are his forte. Although most probably won't say this is a greater flick than his previous Blackhawk Down, I enjoyed it more, probably because of the historical connection to events present and past, and the film's story seems realistic enough so that it could have happened, and perhaps it did. All the performances were excellent, and I even thought Orlando Bloom did a decent job in his role, although up against competition like Neeson, Norton, Gleeson, and the guy who played Saladin (don't know his name, but he brought a convincing and studied intensity to the role), he has his work cut out for him.<br /><br />One minor correction, the major battle scene with what they called the ballistas are actually trebouchets. The ballistas are very large arbalests, or crossbows. To employ an overused word, the battle is truly awesome, and reminscent of the opening scene in Gladiator, but even better. It was still a couple of hundred years before gunpowder and canon came into use in the 1300s, and it wasn't uncommon to have battles in the Middle Ages where both sides were pounding each other with literally hundreds of catapults. So I thought that part was quite accurate and pretty interesting.<br /><br />Of course, with a current heart throb like Bloom in the lead role, there has to be a beautiful woman and a little romance thrown in, but this isn't allowed to sidetrack the main story as the tensions between Christian and Muslim forces build and finally erupt into at first sporadic raids and skirmishes, leading up to the final big battle with the siege of Jeruselam. Scott deftly unfolds the events and the action, controlling the pace of the movie with a sure hand, until the final climactic scene. Overall, another fine film from Scott and worth seeing on the big screen.<br /><br />By the way, a little Ridley Scott and movie trivia here, there are websites devoted to discussing the various film genres and I've seen the second Alien movie (Aliens) called the greatest action flick of all time. And this was by people weren't necessarily sci-fi fans. In fact, after seeing Kingdom of Heaven last night with a friend, the subject of Aliens came up as we were discussing Scott's other films, and my friend said that when he went to see it, the film broke and they had to stop and fix it. When they stopped the movie and turned on the lights, he said the whole audience heaved a collective sigh of relief at the opportunity to take a break from the intense, non-stop action. :-)</p></br><a href="../users/A15Q7ABIU9O9YZ.html">A15Q7ABIU9O9YZ</a><br/><p>Wow. Some of you guys are cold. It seems unfair that actors who have made millions being sullen and anti-heroic (Pitt, Cruise, Farrel) now get a chance to play a completely out-of-character role of a man embroiled in myth like Achilles, Nathen Algren and Alexander, and are then compared to the one guy who could pull it off, Crowe. And they are found wanting.<br /><br />Brad Pitt spends a year in the gym pumping up for Achilles, Cruise practiced Samurai combat for 8 months to get ready for "The Last . . . ." and Farrell, well he kept dying his hair different shades of blond to get the right Macedonian lilt.<br /><br />But in the tradition of Arthur and Modred and Lancelot and Spartacus and Ivanhoe, it's hard to beat Russell Crowe. He was born 50 years late! So comparing Orlando Bloom to the Maximus character isn't going to work.<br /><br />I believe the problem with any 2005 movie with Jerusalem as the venue makes folks generally nervous. I don't know what to think of it. You know you want to say if it is a Holy City it certainly has been the site for such extraordinary suffering for the last 2000 years, and suicide bombers and car bombs and rocket attacks notwithstanding, it still is.<br /><br />Generally the plot was a relatively accurate description of what every other historian referred to as following the Dark Ages. The tranquil time (that's a relative term) between Crusade II and Crusade III.  Bloom is credible and Eva Greene as Syballa was beautiful in the long hair or short hair version and the presence of powerful men such as Jeremy Irons and Liam Neeson gave it direction. Like all huge movies, sometimes homeric film shots gave way to our understanding of the purpose.<br /><br />Poor choice of a topic during a time of great political unrest. Good story worth seeing. 4 stars.

Some people would reach for a romantic comedy at this time.  Not me.  To me, there is nothing like a silly swashbuckler with a big theme, huge battle scenes, and a bit of romance.  This 2005 film, Kingdom of Heaven, met that goal perfectly.  All I had to do was sit back and watch heroes and villains and lots of pomp in a rather contrived story about good and evil.  And whether the film is historically accurate or really happened this way makes little difference.  After all, the only reason I was watching it was so I could sit back, relax and kill a few hours before going to bed.<br /><br />The film is set in the 12th century and it's about Muslims and Christians fighting for control of Jerusalem.  Orlando Bloom is cast as the young blacksmith in France who is the illegitimate son of a knight, played by Liam Neeson.  He teaches his son to fence and to be honorable and then gets murdered.  The young man now has his quest in front of him.  He will go to Jerusalem and fight for the forces of good.  Of course there are challenges along the way - like getting shipwrecked in desert (yes, the desert) and saving the life of an Arab who we all know will show up later in the film.  The king of Jerusalem is Christian and is trying to keep peace in the land.  However, he is dying of leprosy and soon there will be a fight for his throne. He has a beautiful sister though, played by Eva Green.  Alas, though, she is married to a Christian bad guy.  And after Orlando Bloom falls in love with her,  he refuses to have her divorce the bad guy and marry him because he feels it is wrong.  She's a terrible actress but she has beautiful blue eyes and wears great costumes.  The one romantic scene surely could pass any censor.  Maybe that's because the producers wanted to attract a Muslim audience.<br /><br />Anyway, the film plays out as I expected.  It's very politically correct and tries to show that the fighting was more about personal power than religion.  Jeremy Irons is cast as the good king's advisor.  He's a good actor as were most of the others.  There was good cinematography too.  But the battle scenes were very similar to every other battle scene I've ever seen.  And the story seemed to lack an electric charge.  I did like it though because it kept my interest.  But it really is boring.  So don't bother.</p></br><a href="../users/A10DB0H2NZF11E.html">A10DB0H2NZF11E</a><br/><p>The action never stops and it's just tons of fun.  The special effects are insane.

Whatever that actor's in, they look for ways to poke fun at it, even if they give some slack to very similar movies with other actors in it. It seems to me that this is what's happened to Kingdom of Heaven.<br /><br />The story is an interesting and timely one. Back in medieval days, there was an uneasy truce between the Christian king who held Jerusalem and the Muslims which surround the city. Not all Christians believe this friendship is wise, and soon enough there is a large scale war going on for the city. Only Orlando Bloom, in the shape of a young bastard blacksmith named Balian, can step in to try to save the population from being wiped out.<br /><br />I admit that after several watchings there are still a few things which strike me as very funny or odd. The fact that Balian's father, Godfrey (Liam Neeson) shows up and says "Hey there, I'm the one who raped your mom. Although she protested, I don't think she really minded". The way Godfrey trains his son in all the arts of fine swordsmanship in one 15-minute session.<br /><br />When Balian goes out to his father's lands, he finds a dry desert, with many families living on it. He promptly decides to dig a well in about 2 hours they have a well with water and full irrigation going. What, none of the locals ever thought to try digging to find water? Were they all standing around, like little AI-less villagers in a badly designed video game, waiting for someone to click on them? It seems like only days afterwards that the entire landscape is green and lush.<br /><br />You really can't blame Orlando Bloom for any of this. He is told to read his lines and to go through his paces - he can't take responsibility for a poorly written script or odd dialogue. He does reasonbly well with the lines he's given - rage at a deceptive priest, angst over a lost love, courage in the face of overwhelming odds.<br /><br />I love battle movies in general, and I greatly appreciated the cavalry charges, castle assaults and other such scenes in the movie. I did had to laugh at a number of very obvious Lord of the Ring similarities though. It's hard not to chuckle when you have "Legolas" up on a tower wall, watching the siege towers roll on in. You're looking for those cave trolls.<br /><br />I also found it exceedingly convenient that a man who claims throughout the entire movie that he is of the utmost high moral character - to the point of risking the entire city of Jerusalem's safety in order to preserve his moral code - has no problem at all hopping into bed with a married woman. I guess morals can be set aside when you've got a sexy babe in your arms.<br /><br />Still, all in all it was a fun romp through medieval days, and the supporting cast like Jeremy Irons were great. I like how the movie tells a fair amount of the story from the Muslim side, and how the Muslim ruler is the one to pick up a knocked-over cross and set it back upright. The message that respect can be found for all religions is a healthy one that I'd like to see more of.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GHUN5HXMHZ89.html">A1GHUN5HXMHZ89</a><br/><p>This is an excellent movie with good casting, story, special effects, camera work, music, and sets. If you enjoy movies like Gladiator, The 13th Warrior, Troy, Robin Hood, et cetera you will probably enjoy this movie. Our main character played by Bloom finds himself in a ackward predicament in protecting the crown and being infatuated with a beautiful young lady. A great deal of epic battle scenes, knightly honor, and court intrigue make this well worth a look. It may not have been a big hit at the box office, but it certainly merits at least a rental.

Unfortunately this DVD doesn't have a commentary by Scott, but some of the procuction footage is cool to watch and the 2 seperate documentaries about the real life crusades are interesting.

While slow in it's buildup, the film features exciting battle sequences, amazing visual effects, and (Most important of all) great performances by a stellar cast. And it's fair depiction of both Christian and Muslim alike lends to it a cautionary tale about how we need to get along despite are differences, and that fanatics of all religions are dangerous people who need to be dealt with.<br /><br />The Widescreen DVD release features impressive sound-and-picture quality. The main extra, the production grid, features nine featurettes that, although very well-done, are not as good as the seven-part documentary for the Extended DVD of "Gladiator." Even better are the "Movie Real" documentary that presents the truth behind the movie, and the "History vs. Hollywood" documentary that details both the fact and fiction behind this amazing film. The four internet featurettes and theatrical trailer are good as well.<br /><br />"Kingdom of Heaven" is a fantastic film that belongs in everyone's collection of historical epics.<br /><br />Movie/DVD Grade: A-</p></br><a href="../users/A2SRZQU1SZG4RR.html">A2SRZQU1SZG4RR</a><br/><p>Unfortunately this film did not become a major hit at the box office. Yet, it has many fine points which makes it a worthwhile viscerally intense viewing experience. Likely at the time, the public was inundated with sexually appealing epics such as "The Gladiator" and "Alexander". "The Kingdom of Heaven" deserves a closer look for its presentation of the historically important Crusades,  which is the clash of Christianity against Islam in a very volatile region of the world, Palestine, now modern Israel. In the end, the Moslems show mercy on the Christians after a long and bloody battle. There is a very wise and universal message here presented by Saladin, a Moslem leader, which is important for modern times for all of humanity.<br /><br />This rich and deeply moving epic film shows the magnitude and impact of the Crusades on the lives of specific individuals, countries, and the world.  Orlando Bloom is cast as Balian, a French blacksmith, who's wife committed suicide after the death of their child. Per the Catholic religion, she is not allowed proper burial. Her wrapped body is placed at the crossroads as an example to all. Balian is enraged and exacts his revenge upon the clergy when he sees her necklace (with a crucifix) on one of the priests. These events shake his faith in God. In despair, he leave his homeland ...<br /><br />On the road, Balian encounters Crusaders, among whom is the injured knight named Baron Godrey of Ibelin (played by Liam Neeson). Balian learns Godfrey is his father, who is now dying. The scene where Balian prays on a mountainside, entreating God for guidance and to strengthen his faith is very powerful and moving. In another very emotional and solemn ceremony, Balian is blessed by his father and is beknighted not long before his father succombs to battle wounds. Liam Neeson's performance is magnificent, he is totally believable in the role).<br /><br />Priot to arriving in Jerusalem, Balian encounters the enemy in the desert, a Moslem,  with whom he fights and on whom he shows mercy, by not murdering him, instead he takes his horse. Balian learns of the political differences which exist bewteen the Crusaders who are divided into two camps of how to win Jerusalem for Christianity. On his travels in the city, he meets a beautiful Moslem woman Sybella (played to perfection by Eva Green) on horseback. Learning she is the sister to the king, who has leprosy, and is the wife of one of the more influential Europeans whose closeness to the king, gives him an advantage during the political unrest in the region -- their destinies are sure to cross again ...<br /><br />The battle scenes between the Crusaders and Moslems are immense in scope and depth. Balian becomes the leader of the Crusaders against the major battle with Saladin, the Moslem leader. Balian also has a secret liason/ relationship with Sybella - despite her married status and unique position ... Overall, this film has much to offer the viewer interested in an exciting emotionally engaging viewing experience.

However, it's good to see this two-disc DVD edition flying off retail and rental shelves. Muslims fighting invading Christians in the Middle East, the movie makes clearn, is not ancient history.<br /><br />There's no denying that this picture is a spectacular achievement. It has only one non-fatal flaw, the casting of Orlando Bloom in the lead. Nevertheless, that does not detract from the substance of director Ridley Scott's film, a controversial follow-up to his Oscar-inning "Gladiator."<br /><br />His subject is the Christian crusades into the Holy Land ("God wills it!") It ends with the siege of Jerusalem, prompting Richard the Lionhearted to launch yet another plundering crusade. Most of the characters are based on real figures and the actors are aware of that, especially a masked Edward Norton, unbilled as Baldwin the Leper King, and Jeremy Irons as his advisor.<br /><br />Only Bloom seems miscast; he isn't yet able to center a character or anchor a film, as Russell Crowe did "Gladiator." Eva Green is fetching as the king's sister, the fictional love interest and only that. Liam Neeson, Brendon Gleeson and others lend superior support.<br /><br />Scott's visuals are stunning: the windy port city of Messina, the entry into Jerusalem, and two battle sequences with sweeping views of opposing armies. Scott uses weather elements and streaming flags to enliven sequences. He actually explains how the technical defense of Jerusalem was executed. Scott is one of the few large scale directors (David Lean was another) able to make intimate moments between characters as meaningful as magnificent vistas. The extras are lackluster save for a lavish documentary that shows what an artistic and logistical accomplishment this film is, and how relevant it is today.<br /><br />Addendeum: A new director's cut of "Kingdom of Heaven" extends the narrative by an hour, expanding upon character and incident and accomplishing the rare feat of improving the original. Whole characters and their story lines are restored, and scenes are enlarged to the scale that Scott intended.</p></br><a href="../users/A3H9JSM1SUTE4O.html">A3H9JSM1SUTE4O</a><br/><p>Ridley Scott's majestic, provocative KINGDOM OF HEAVEN (Fox), never achieved mainstream status. Perhaps it was the contemporary "crusader" implications of the U.S. invasion of Iraq or the strong support of Israel by American evangelicals and the rise of radical Islamic terrorists that chilled the public's desire to see a film that explores and exploits the core conflicts between Christianity and Islam regarding Jerusalem.<br /><br />Criticized by both Arabs and Christians as taking the other's side, the film's an epic adventure that follows Balian (Orlando Bloom), a simple French blacksmith who discovers he's a nobleman and assumes his father's place in Richard the Lionheart's Third Crusade (1187-1192) to reclaim Jerusalem from a Saladin.  The main characters are based on real people with the exception of Balian's father.<br /><br />This convincing visual recreation of another era catches arguments for both sides and spotlights the self-serving agendas of those who influence the powers-that-be.<br /><br />The details of siege warfare in the climactic battle for Jerusalem, the huge scale of the confrontation and the fiery catapults are a wonder of modern filmmaking.<br /><br />Everyone I know who has actually seen this impressive film has enjoyed it.<br /><br />For more on this relevant theme, read James Reston's terrific book "Warrior's of God" and see the superb two-hour PBS documentary "Holy Warriors" now on DVD (Paramount).</p></br><a href="../users/A30IP5D5DLHRPA.html">A30IP5D5DLHRPA</a><br/><p>Many complaints coming from critics is that KOH was too nice to the Muslims and made the Christians look like warlords... well, that's exactly how it was; the Christians did attack to retake the "holy land" and was rather nasty towards the Muslim occupants until their expulsion.  Historical nitpicking aside, KOH had it's ups and downs.<br /><br />First off, the movie was slightly long-winded and tended to drag quite a bit so at certain points it was hard to stay focused, however, the dialogue pertaining to religion and extremism was very interesting and very prevelant in our day and age; something that is often overlooked in our mainstream society today.<br /><br />The action sequences were nice; a true testiment to how sword-fighting and medieval warfare was at the time.  The scenes were not overly-grotesue but just right for the occassion so the viewer is not distracted.  The code of honor was not overdone in a hookey over-the-top style like many movies do these days.<br /><br />The acting wasn't bad either; I love Jeremy Irons and Orlanda Bloom and both played characters well suited for their styles of acting.  Some of the other actors and actresses needed a little work here and there, but that's nitpicking.<br /><br />The only real drawbacks I can find is the dragging dialogue in some scenes and not enough action.  For how long the movie is, I was hoping for more battles and less dialogue; for that, I am disapointed but will still be proud to purchase this DVD.<br /><br />All in all, an 89%.</p></br><a href="../users/A33PNAQ33DGBJG.html">A33PNAQ33DGBJG</a><br/><p>nailed his part.The drama of this movie will keep you going and waiting to see the ending.

Kingdom of Heaven isn't one of those films, and after watching it, I now know why directors and writers change things. While it isn't entirely true (some of the early scenes in the movie were fake), most of it is, including the characters and battles that happens. It does keep your interest all the way up until the end, where it will then leave you feeling a little cheated. Without spoiling much, I can say that this is where the director Ridley Scott should have applied the Hollywood touch.<br /><br />This is a great movie for those who love world history or for those who love epics (like me). Beyond that, I wouldn't recommend it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DK5AZMXS1QA3.html">A1DK5AZMXS1QA3</a><br/><p>Is it a coincidence that a movie based on Christian - Muslim relations was to come out after the 9-11 terrorist attacks?  Maybe, maybe not. The movie itself is quite good in many aspects, but could have been a lot better.<br /><br />First, the acting.  Coming out in the summer of 2005, this movie probably had more big name stars in it that most of the summer crop.  Jeremy Irons, Liam Neeson, David Thewlis, Edward Norton, and Orlando Bloom lead of an international cast highlighted by many actors famous for both stage and screen performances of medieval roles.  The lead role went to Orlando Bloom and this movie was advertised as his breakout role.  Unfortunately, his acting, or lack thereof, is totally overshadowed by the other actors and actresses.  There are many moments where he is silent and it seems nary a thought is going thru the character's mind.  Luckily, all the other roles were played well, especially the parts of Saladin and King Baldwin.  Both Edward Norton and Ghassan Massoud portray well the leaders who shouldered so much weight on their backs in public, and handle internal bickering in private from subordinates.<br /><br />Second is the setting.  Taking place in what is now Israel, Italy and France, the movie should have been filled with grand scenes of the terrain of these areas; such as lush forests, expansive deserts, and rocky mountains.  Instead, the only grand vistas are the occasional shots of armies marching to battle.  This movie should have a taken a cue from Jackson's LOTR in terms of cinematography.<br /><br />Third is the music.  A movie of this magnitude should have hired John Williams for a complete orchestral score with dedicated pieces for each scene and the major characters.  Instead, I cannot remember a single tune from this movie's soundtrack.<br /><br />Fourth is the action scenes.  These were truly amazing in every respect; grand, chaotic, bloody, realistic, grim with sweat and dust covering the troops on both sides.  But the drawback is the sudden sword fighting skills of Bloom's character, Balian.  In this respect, this movie copies of Pirates of the Caribbean.  In both movies, Bloom's character starts of as a blacksmith who happens to make swords, and ends up displaying very impressive combat skills.<br /><br />Fifth is the look and sound of the characters.  If you look at pictures of people from the 1950s and earlier, you will notice the prevalence of bad teeth, and bad skin due to a variety of ailments, injuries, diseases, etc...  1000 years ago the average health of humans was much worse than now, yet notice how healthy and wholesome the knights look.  Clear skin, straight teeth abound.  These are soldiers, yet none have scars on them.  Related to this is the speech.  Most of the knights are supposed to be French, yet they are played by actors from the British Isles and have distinctive British accents.  Likewise, why do so many of the Arab soldiers speak English.  The makers of this movie should have taken a hint from Mel Gibson and had all the Christians speak Latin.  That would have made everything more believable.<br /><br />All in all a good movie and worth the 2.5 hours of watching it.  But it was not the best movie of 2005.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>The film isn't incredibly memorable; it won't go into the annals of filmdom like `Lawrence of Arabia,' `Lord of the Rings' or `Gladiator.' To me this film can be viewed on a rainy day. `Kingdom of Heaven' has the action, excitement, and interest. The story, the cinematography, and the acting are fine as well but I think the film misses its attempt to have an emotional core. It's primary focus is on the politics of the situation between the Christians and Muslims and the kings of both sides. But all films require an emotional core around the central characters to work well, or it's just pages out of a fictional textbook.<br /><br />Part of the problem is the writing. The writers mention the tragic loss of the lead character's wife, and there is a very touching scene on the Mount, but then the matter is subsequently dropped. The writers mention the need of the lead character to redeem himself, and it is barely mentioned again until the very end. This redemption does have a nice payoff at the end, but by the time that happens you've forgotten all about it. There is also a minor plot element regarding a romance between two characters, but that too is almost forgotten until the end (where there isn't the best payoff).<br /><br />The other problem is Orlando Bloom. He simply lacks the passion to be a lead character. He is fine in the broody, silent, reflective moments, but he does not project any sort of passion when required. He can't portray anger, or grief, or inspiration, or joy very well. It's something he should clearly work on, it's going to keep him back from truly being a great actor.<br /><br />The film does have redeeming moments, such as the siege of Jerusalem and the humor only brothers-in-arms could create, much less appreciate. The cinematography, set design and costumes are beautiful, and the action is believable and exciting yet not gory. Ridley Scott's `Kingdom of Heaven' is a good epic and for those who likes this genre will enjoy it.</p></br><a href="../users/APIW11UEPKIC2.html">APIW11UEPKIC2</a><br/><p>If you are expecting a movie like gladiator then I will stop you from putting this in your dvd player.

But somehow (and refreshingly) that seems to make it more realistic to me because dramatic and intense scenes are often more to advance the plot and are thus more artificial than representative of how people behave in real life. The movie's greatest strength is perhaps Ridley Scott's direction. The battle scenes are excellent, from the forest fight in the beginning, that reminds this viewer of the opening battle in GLADIATOR, to the siege of Jerusalem with siege towers and catapults and casts of thousands. The costumes and the sets are very realistic. For a history buff like me, it is a joy to have such versimiltude. In one scene I recall seeing a beat-up looking shield with several dents in it. That is great attention to detail. It was a nice touch in this subdued movie to have our near-mute hero Balian of Ibelin's lady love interest come riding wildly into a scene in bright clothes and then lower her veil to expose a exotically beautiful and intellgent face. Too bad the writers didn't put more of her sassiness and exotic color into KINGDOM OF HEAVEN; it could use a little perking-up. Another interesting device was the use of The Leper King of Jerusalem wearing a gold mask and being wrapped up in bandages to hide his disease. As for conflict, the Christian order of Templars, with large red crosses on their white tunics, are made the villians of the piece for wanting to fight muslims. There is a debate scene among the Christian lords where the Templars argue for war and the feeling is the Templars are blood-thirsty, evil thugs trying to stir up trouble. A few of them are even hanged for attacking muslims. On the other side, there is only a brief scene where a character approaches Saladin, the great muslim general, and reminds him of his promise to take Jerusalem. So, by weight of material, we have the muslims as basically nice fellows and some Christians as the bad guys, the implication seemingly being that they could all get along if it wasn't for warlike elements from the West. Imagine that! Well, this is Hollywood. Of course, the film doesn't tell you that the muslims had conquered Spain and had driven into France, threatening Europe with slaughter and slavery before they were stopped. But that is just a minor detail to be ignored by leftist film writers trying to get out their message and brainwash the movie-going public. The worst kind of historical fiction, whether book or film, is to wash a story about the past in the dirty water of today's politics. It is the writer's real task to tell it like it was in the past and, my friends, there are two sides to this story. Maybe, after seeing KINGDOM OF HEAVEN, which by the way I do recommend as an entertaining film and award three and a half swords out of five, you will go to the library or a bookstore and research the real story of the Templars and the struggle between Christian and muslim cultures, going on now since 700 AD.</p></br><a href="../users/AUEHG0DB54B7K.html">AUEHG0DB54B7K</a><br/><p>I saw Kingdom of Heaven when it came out and was immediately taken with Ridley Scott's epic tale.  The story of the film has been well discussed in other reviews so I will mention the 45 additional minutes in this cut.<br /><br />I thought that the beginning of the film could use some additional scenes to give the viewer more of a background to Balian, and the new director's cut does just that.  We learn that Balian has been to war and involved in engineering.  We see Balian's wife alive in a flashback and even Godfrey (Liam Neeson) has a moment when he recalls a meeting with Balian's mother.  We also get a brief glimpse of Godfrey's older brother, the Lord of the area, who seems a bit jealous of his brother and his nephew.  It is this nephew who later attempts to arrest Balian.  The most significant addition to the film is Sibylla's young son who is the heir to the throne of Jerusalem.  There is a good deal of discussion about this sub-plot in the accompanying bonus material and it adds significantly to Eva Green's character, creating a much more complex woman when she realizes that her son is condemned to die the slow death of her brother.  With the additional footage in the film one can better appreciate the performance of Ms. Green.<br /><br />There are small additions to the film that expand scenes.  For example, one of the grave diggers that is burying Balian's wife at the start of the film shows up in Jerusalem and fights in the siege.  We also have a final duel between Balian and Guy de Lusignan.  A minor addition perhaps but it helps connect Balian to his earlier life and we can observe how the people under siege believe in their leader.  The film was carefully researched and all of the major characters are historical, except for Godfrey but there is not much know about them.  The performances are superb: Marton Czokas is, as always, a marvelous villain, Jeremy Irons is outstanding as Tiberias and Edward Norton is an impressive King Bardwin, just to name a few.  This allows Ridley Scott the opportunity to flesh out his characters (however, we can be fairly certain that Sybella did not have a romantic fling with Balian) while remaining true to their personalities.  The casting of Arab roles was restricted to Arab actors and Ghassan Massoud makes an impressive Saladin and Alexander Siding is very good as Nasir.  There has been a lot of speculation that Ridley Scott had a message about Iraq in mind when making this film but I think the director has been clear that his idea behind the film was to show that the age old conflicts of the Middle East have had their share of good and bad people in every camp.<br /><br />This is a visually stunning and beautifully acted film that held my attention from start to finish.  In his Director's cut Ridley Scott has created an epic film worthy of a place among the best.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>We have Director's Cuts and Extended Editions. The former is usually what the director initially intended before studio executives got ideas about what the film should be while the latter is usually an optional version, a "if you want to, here it is" cut of the film. Before we had Gladiator getting an extended edition which oddly didn't work out in its favor and we have the director's cut of Kingdom of Heaven which is probably even better than the normal cut than previously thought.<br /><br />It's 1181 and Balian is in a particular depressed mood. His son died and in her grief, his wife committed suicide which is a big Christian no-no. He comes across his father, Godfrey, and he finds out that he can potentially right his and his wife's problems if he goes to Jerusalem only things aren't so great there. King Baldwin has leprosy and his health is deteriorating and there's a power struggle on who will be the next King. Meanwhile, Muslim hero Saladin wants Jerusalem for him and his people and 200,000 people are on their way to take it.<br /><br />Some longer versions of the film merely add to one of the film's problems or corrects them. Gladiator, awesome in its battle scenes but uninteresting in its political intrigue scenes, got even more of them in the extended cut. With this film, we get more insight into characters that maybe aren't as strong either way. For example, hero Balian is somehow who firmly sets himself in ideals yet he sleeps with a man's wife but he won't take up the crown and marry that man's sister and have him executed even if said man is power hungry. He just never really was much of an interesting character to begin with and seeing more of his moral flipflopping was odd.<br /><br />Maybe it's just getting old now but seeing 200,000 men descend on another large group of men and wage war isn't as thrilling anymore. Yes it's visually impressive but after seeing it in all 3 Lord of the Rings movies, then Troy then some others I probably haven't seen, it's just not as stunning to see. However, the scene itself works well with brutal combat and flaming fireballs and large towers(too LotR there too) and instead of admiring the effects, I just simply watch it. However, you'll usually get great visuals from Ridley Scott's movies and this one has it with some striking cinematography shots of landscapes.<br /><br />Acting-wise it's straight across the board with particular attention to Edward Norton as King Baldwin who, like Hugo Weaving in V for Vendetta, manages to be captivating even when his face is shielded by a mask. However it only falls apart once but it's in a key area: the casting of Balian. Despite a fluttering moral compass, it's our main man and Orlando Bloom just simply doesn't cut it. Yeah the guy can fight but he's not as emphatic or charismatic.<br /><br />You should definately check out the film and rid yourself of the memories or thought of its much-maligned theatrical cousin and watch this instead.</p></br><a href="../users/A1V3IO23FZFF9L.html">A1V3IO23FZFF9L</a><br/><p>Kingdom of Heaven is an epic movie with an epic length.

Although set in the late 12th Century, the film has a great deal of relevance to the world of today, seeing as how the Christian West and the Muslim East are once again at each others' throats much as they were back then.  Only the names and the weaponry seem to have changed.  With an eye towards fairness, perhaps, the movie makes it very clear that there are men of war and men of peace on both sides of the conflict, although, if the truth be told, the Christians come out slightly less noble than their Islamic counterparts in the film.<br /><br />By the time the story begins, the Crusades have been waging on and off for nearly a hundred years already.  And although a fragile peace seems to have taken a temporary hold in the Christian-ruled city of Jerusalem, forces from both without and within are threatening to rend the tender garment holding that peace together.  Orlando Bloom plays the young blacksmith, Balian, son of the beloved Sir Godfrey (Liam Nissan), who is hoping to find his redemption for killing a priest by becoming a knight and dedicating his life to defending that holiest of cities to the best of his abilities.<br /><br />Beyond its rather excessive running time, the biggest weakness in the film is Bloom himself who makes for a very bland, very pallid central figure, one whose "romance" with Sibylla, the queen of Jerusalem, is the least interesting aspect of the film.  However, there are fine compensatory supporting performances by Liam Nissan, Jeremy Irons and Ghassan Massoud as the great Islamic leader, Saladin, who, like Balian, is portrayed as almost a reluctant warrior in this titanic struggle for religious domination.<br /><br />And indeed, it is the sociopolitical parallels that the film draws between its own time and ours that ultimately lifts "Kingdom of Heaven" a rung or two above the ordinary.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R8PXSFGY9MC2.html">A3R8PXSFGY9MC2</a><br/><p>`Kingdom of Heaven' is an epic tale set during the Crusades and whilst this is rife with historical inaccuracies, it is also a fairly decent story of one man finding some peace and meaning in his life. Bloom plays the main character (Balian) and he manages to play the role reasonably well, although he doesn't seem to have enough grit at times. He puts on a brave show with his sword fights and gives the occasional rabble rousing speech now and again, but he is no William Wallace crying for `Freedom' although you get the feeling this was the image Scott was going for. This is based around the death of a king, his succession and the fall of Jerusalem and this could have lead to deep courtly intrigue and Machiavellian schemes to enhance the plot and though these elements are represented in the film, they are rather flat and without suspense. I think this stems from the fact that this is overlong (don`t be fooled by the time guide on Amazon), I have bought the directors cut of this and boy does it feel overlong by the end. This doesn't seem to have much pace, but plods on and on, when in reality it could be a snappy story full of chivalry, battles and honour. For all that, this is still a perfectly enjoyable film and once you settle into it's rhythm you can truly appreciate it for it's epic scope.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></br><a href="../users/AZQ7O73EAS3VI.html">AZQ7O73EAS3VI</a><br/><p>If you like Gladiator then you will like this.

I have no problems with the Crusades being told from the Muslim point of view; the problem with this movie is that the Christians are shown as oozing self hate, doubting their mission in the Levant, when in reality, even this late in the Crusades, they deeply believe in the righteousness of their cause (the movie is otherwise relatively accurate in historic terms). Add to that that the action scenes are very poor, that the acting is uniformly bad (Jeremy Irons is particularly terrible, but you can't forget the awfulness of that new invention of the star system, Orlando Bloom, a stand-in for Argentine footballer Ariel Ortega) and you have a very disappointing movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A13DQTXG02HZC1.html">A13DQTXG02HZC1</a><br/><p>I have always been an enthusiast of Ridley Scott's movie.  Every frames are picture perfect and Ridley himself even remarked jokingly that he's been categorised as a visualist (looks good but no substance).  Despite that this movie is better viewed in the cinema, the second dic with the extra features are exemplary in this instance.  There are two substantial documentaries that allow the viewers to understand deeper about the Crusades, comparing the facts against the fiction, getting a glimpse of the thoughts and reflections of the actors and actresses, planning process, production process and so forth.  In many other DVD compilation, we would have behind the scene extra which is more like a promotional material but not here, where all documentaries have gotten substance to them.  The movie is very relevant in today's situation where Muslims are still proclaiming jihad towards the infidels and Christians (in the form of USA with its supporters) invade and occupy Iraq and now, talking about exerting its muscle power towards Syria and Iran.  Then, there's the problem spot itself, Jerusalem where Muslims are still fending themselves or exerting themselves against the might of the Jews and the Christians.  The movie's intent is obvious.  It's actually an anti-war movie that believes in forward thinking leadership and resolving conflict towards dialogues and working together as shown by King Baldwin and Salahuddin.  Can you imagine President Bush and Osama coming face to face and working through an uneasy alliance?  This movie is different from The Gladiators because the focus is never on Maximus but about Jerusalem itself.  Characters that are featured in the movie form the total sum of the movie.  The whole time sitting through the movie, it never comes to me that it's about Balian but about conflicting and amiable personalities that either work against or for one another.  Don't take my word for it but this movie is a grand epic and very well-executed.  God is in details and from little subtle hints given in the picture shots, we get to understand the society, the philosophy, the costume, the diet, the geography  , the architecture, the warefare and its weaponary of its time.  The gesture of Salahuddin picking up a fallen cross and putting it right on the table mindfully is a very potent symbol of his respect and tolerance of other religion.  The movie brings forth a point that some people use religion for the greater good and some people hide behind the facade or religion to garner power and influence.  Once they are corrupted by power, they are incorrigible and would start committing evil.  It's quite remarkable that one of the Ten Commandments is Thou Shall Not Kill and yet, people can't still abide by TEN simple Commandments.  A memorable movie that anyone should have in their collections.  Highly recommended.  I'm really saddened by the fact that it didn't do well in the box-office.  Perhaps, it's due to people's denial of the inherent message in the movie, a movie that shows a more humane side of the Muslims, where the American market can't and won't accept right now especially when their sons and daughters are fighting a war that doesn't belong to them.</p></br><a href="../users/AUTBHG6070SL4.html">AUTBHG6070SL4</a><br/><p>-- though I'll leave it to others to discuss the historical accuracy.<br /><br />Balian, a blacksmith in medieval Europe, loses his wife. He finds that the village priest not only desecrated but looted her body. This costs Balian much of his Christian faith, and costs the priest his life. Balian joins a myterious traveller on a Crusade to the holy land, one step ahead of the law, whether or not that law stands for justice.<br /><br />The rest of the story builds well. Balian enters Jerusalem, and rises in importance there. His dealings with the other Christians in charge of the city corrode his already rusted faith. Although their voices aren't as loud, he speaks as one of the secular rulers of the city, dealing as fairly as he can with Jew, Muslim, and Christian alike.<br /><br />Balian becomes ruler of Jerusalem, through improbable circumstance, and its defender when the Saracens attack. The battle scenes are dramatic. In-fighting is bloody and vicious, and the night attack on the city will horrify anyone who thinks about it. The night sky light with Greek fire isn't that different from the napalm and phosphorus attacks of our own age, in all the worst ways. In the end, the city wall falls to the catapaults, and the attackers flow in like water through a breached levee.<br /><br />Although the city falls, Balian single-handedly saves the people in it. His personal honor is known and respected among the attackers, so they trade him the brick and stone of the city for the lives of its citizens, and for their safe passage out.<br /><br />It's an exciting movie. The battles are vivid, even if parts them were computer enhanced. The people are larger than life, but not exaggerated beyond belief - perhaps that's what cost it at the box office. Ignore the critics. It's well made, with characters you can care about, and better than a lot of other quasi-historical dramas out there.<br /><br />//wiredweird</p></br><a href="../users/A31I3HXMD5H1EL.html">A31I3HXMD5H1EL</a><br/><p>Ridley Scott's masterful follow-up to "Gladiator", "Kingdom of Heaven", is, certainly, the best film about the Crusades ever made. While this may seem faint praise about an era far removed from ours, his vision offers an honesty and timeliness that clearly illustrates how little has changed in the last thousand years. With remarkable fidelity to actual characters and events, "Kingdom" reminds viewers that goodness is not only a Christian attribute (Ghassan Massoud's Saladin is far more sympathetic and compassionate than many 'holy' Crusaders), that even an average man, given purpose, can change the world (Orlando Bloom's Balian, a grieving blacksmith, discovers his father is a Baron, embraces the code of chivalry, and ultimately saves Jerusalem from total destruction), and that religious atrocities "in the name of God" was as ridiculous then as it is, today.<br /><br />While there are many historical inaccuracies, for cinematic purposes (Godfrey and Balian were not related, Balian did not have a love affair with Sibylla, etc.), director Scott unflinchingly shows much that was true (Jerusalem's 'King' Baldwin...a masked Edward Norton...dying from leprosy; the horrific siege of the city), and fills the screen with such detail that the film demands repeated viewings, to truly appreciate the spectacle.<br /><br />Several performances deserve mention; Orlando Bloom is very good as the central character, Balian, in certainly his best performance to date; Brendan Gleeson, as the bigoted Reynald, makes the character nearly as unsavory as the ACTUAL Reynald; Jeremy Irons is wonderful as the fictional Tiberias (based on the historic Raymond of Cyprus...Tiberias DOES have a nobler ring!), and Liam Neeson, in a role FAR too brief, gives Godfrey both humanity and nobility (although he seems to be making a career of playing hero's mentors!)<br /><br />The DVD offers a variety of terrific extras, including detailed technical information about the production (filmed in Spain and Morocco), and an overview of the Crusades, and the period of the film, with special attention paid to where the film makers diverged from historic fact.<br /><br />This is a two-disc set that certainly lives up to expectations! Any Ridley Scott film is worth owning..."Kingdom of Heaven" stands as one of his best, so need I say more?</p></br><a href="../users/A2XGJ56VCFOKKZ.html">A2XGJ56VCFOKKZ</a><br/><p>Since I'm interested in the Crusades and was excited when I heard about this film coming out, perhaps my expectations were a bit too high, for this film failed to excite me as I watched it. I didn't feel any strong identity with any of the characters and the story wasn't compelling enough to keep me interested. In the end, it seemed like a colossal waste of money, people's time and talents, and the effort that went into the making of this film. Because it bombed at the box office, it ruins the chance for any future Crusades movie from being made any time soon.<br /><br />As far as "sword and sandal epics" go, "Gladiator" remains the best one that has come out so far, followed by "Alexander" (which I was pleasantly surprised by that it wasn't as bad as people made it out to be), and "Troy". I'm about epic-out though, as nothing really compares to "The Lord of the Rings" trilogy. This film would have been better to skimped out on the battle sequences (which I suspect most movie goers are tired of) and focused on the political and religious intrigue behind the fight for Jerusalem during the Crusades.<br /><br />Save your money and time by avoiding this movie. Invest in a good history book about the Crusades and let your imagination run wild.

Everyone who even has the slightest historical knowledge knows, that the cristian knights butchered all Arabs that weren't willing to accept their religious thoughts. And what do we see here? The cristians are nothing but good guys that mean no harm and the Arabs are like the indians from Dances with Wolves: humble, brave and sophisticated men with a noble code of honour.<br /><br />The only villains in the movie are the Templars that are looking for a holy war. To achieve this they murder some innocent Arabs for no reason...so this way giving the peaceful Arabs a reason to start to fight. This movie clearly tries to build a bridge between the Western and the Eastern civilization, but fails hopelessly as it is not telling the truth.(SARR)</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDNTB7377YH2.html">A1CDNTB7377YH2</a><br/><p>This movie was a lot better than Alexander and just about as good as Gladiator (Rome seems to be more sexy than tales of the middle-east).  During the time of the crusades where Christian hordes from France decided to kill all non-Christians in the middle-east because "they were told by g-d," Orlando Bloom flees after he has murdered a priest.  He ends up in the desert and running out of water and happens on an oasis and a horse.  Two Arabs challenge him for the horse which they state is theirs.  Bloom kills one and lets the other one live because he needs him to show him how to get to Jerusalem.  It will turn out later that the man that he spares is the son of the Arab king and each man will continue to do favors for the other throughout the movie.<br /><br />Bloom ends up in Jerusalem and catches the eye of the "married" sister of the local king.  She eventually starts to sneak off to see him.  Her brother the king, does not have long to live because he has leprosy and the woman's husband will become the new king through her when she dies.<br /><br />The rest of the movie involves clashes of egos between the new king, Bloom, the Church leader and everyone else and it appears that egos totally blind men even if it will cause their death.<br /><br />There are some excellent battle/siege at the castle scenes as good as Troy, Arthur, Lord of the Rings and all the other movies of that genre.<br /><br />Bloom makes and excellent hero and he seems to make the impossible happen.

Despite a few "ripped from today's headlines" speeches, the action is well-done, the military conflict interesting and there are strong performances all around. The climactic battle at the Christopher Gate of Jerusalem, if it doesn't quite measure up to similar siege sequences in Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings movies, is exciting and involving, even if the populism seems a few centuries early.<br /><br />Great fun with a more rounded story than the more intense Gladiator.<br /><br />Strongly recommended for fans of getting medieval.</p></br><a href="../users/AMIGVTZZIWS6I.html">AMIGVTZZIWS6I</a><br/><p>Every time you turn around there's someone lamenting about the lack of quality films coming out of Hollywood; and it's usually some whiny conservative crying about Hollywood's liberal bias.  The problem is, when Hollywood does create good quality films -- and believe it or not, there are several -- no one goes to see them.  Kingdom of Heaven is, in my opinion, a prime example of that.  This is the best presentation of the Crusades I have ever seen.  It not only shows the heroism of the men and women who thought they were doing God's work, but also the futility of the entire exercise.  The films also does an admirable job of presenting the Crusades in as even-handed a manner as possible. Both Christians and Muslims are presented without bias one way or another -- at least for the most part.  Usually, in films of this nature, the Christians are shown as these flawless heroes setting out to free the Holy Land from the clutches of the heathen Muslims, but not Kingdom of Heaven.  I would say this film does the best job of presenting both the good and the bad qualities of both sides, and leaving the audience to draw their own conclusions.  Of course, this film does have some biases.  At it's heart the film is very anti-war, not to mention anti-religion.  The anti-war part comes through in its depiction of King Baldwin (played by Edward Norton behind a mask) who would rather make Jerusalem of city for all faiths, with the help of Saladin, of course.  However, forces out of his control conspire to take Jerusalem to war and remove Baldwin from the throne.  It is anti-religion not because of any hatred towards religion, but because the Church used its influence with the populace to drive the Crusade and were usually the first to run and hide when the going got tough.  These are, of course, reasons why conservatives would cry liberal bias, but that's only because they are often too narrow-minded to see anything beyond a rigid set of ideas.<br /><br />The cast of this film is excellent.  This is the best work I've seen out of Orlando Bloom; Marton Csokas is wonderfully evil as Guy de Lusignan; and Ghassan Massoud gives a very interesting portrayal of Saladin.  Of special note is Edward Norton who plays the role of King Baldwin from behind a mask that hides the character's leprosy.  This film is epic in the finest sense of the word and deserved far more attention than it received at thebox office.</p></br><a href="../users/AWG2O9C42XW5G.html">AWG2O9C42XW5G</a><br/><p>I'm not to sure about how true this story really is but the action is intense and Orlando Bloom's Performance is just outstanding.

It is quite possibly one of the worst epics ever made. Considering that this is a Ridley Scott movie one has to beg the question - what on Earth did he think he was doing? Since the early 1990s Hollywood has been evading a movie about the Crusades... and now we can see why. An English blacksmith turns out to be the heir of a Jerusalem Knight and goes off there to find himself, only to replace his father and serve the King of Jerusalem who is having a hard time maintaining law and order in his own house while Muslims are knocking down his doors. Plotless, pointless and utterly boring, the fight sequences have been seen so many times before that you will just sleep your way into the end credits... and what a three hour nap it will be. For all the big names on display this really does leave much to be desired. Forget Gladiator or Troy. This one is clearly a no-brainer.</p></br><a href="../users/A3CL82UITQJLWS.html">A3CL82UITQJLWS</a><br/><p>I wanted to like this movie going in.

Unlike his other movies, Ridley Scott's story telling on this one fell flat.  Action and cinematography were on par as usual.  However, I just could not find a compelling reason for the crusaders in this film.  It seemed all the activities and scenes were built up just so Orlando Bloom could have his big save-the-day moment on screen.<br /><br />It was just a little too convenient that a blacksmith, who had just lost his wife and daughter, would suddenly have a noble Lord and crusader show up at his doorstep claiming to be his father asking him to join the crusades. Why does the nobleman show up now of all times after never seeing his son for several years? The plot seemed too easily set up.<br /><br />Bloom very quickly becomes disillusioned by the real intentions of the crusaders, but he seems to let it go as if unphased by it all.  He's just hanging around Jerusalem, building up his farm until it is time for him to make a difference.<br /><br />So what is the movie supposed to be about?  Is is about a man who had lost all hope and manages to find himself by embarking on a spiritual mission? Is it about Muslims and Christians being able to live in peace after all?  The themes switch back and forth.  Is there supposed to be a theme?<br /><br />Sorry Ridley and Orlando, stick to what you know.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EZHMGGWY74HY.html">A3EZHMGGWY74HY</a><br/><p>I purchased this movie yesterday and couldn't be happier that I have it in my DVD collection.

A great film for lovers of history.  You won't be disappointed if you give it a try.  You will be left craving more information on the subject.

After taking the flack for the multitude of blatant inaccuracies for Braveheart, he made the in-your-face statement that history should never get in the way of a good script.  Ridley Scott and William Monahan took that to heart!  Despite what the script calls for, blacksmiths didn't just up and become knights in the Middle Ages.  But that is a small sin, a foreboding of things to come.  The battle was not at Jerusalem, but a city known as Hattin (clue - it was called the Battle of Hattin for some reason...lol).  At one point in the movie, Saladin's sister is killed to tick him off - as if he isn't ticked enough already? ?this didn't take place.  His sister was never killed.  Sigh.<br /><br />Before you can blink, you are knee-deep in stereotypical Christians.  We are treated with "cute" soundbites of the Kingdom of Heaven still being disputed, speeches that would have never been uttered during this period and an all too simple Hollywood style wrapped up ending.<br /><br />So, park any historical interest at the door.  Did you REALLY expect anything different from Hollywood?  The Costumes are wonderful, the lensing of the whole thing is stunning from start to finish.  Orlando is finally easing out of the teen mode and into manhood.  He looks good, though really needed to reach deeper than his Legolas mode to pull out this performance.  Still, I don't fault him for never delivering the knock out punch his character should have provided.  Blame first-time screen-writer William Monahan (maybe that is the mistake - big budget and they go with unproven talent?) should take twenty lashes for the sacrilege.  He just doesn't give Bloom much with which to emote.  The character of Balian is just so vacant.<br /><br />It's an enjoyable movie if you have no anticipations, love visual impact and are a Bloom fan.  I like it for what it is.  Will watch it more than once, as I do with Arthur.  Historical Fiction makes it so seldom to the movies, you cannot afford to<br /><br />be too picky.  As a lover of this period of history, I had foolishly hoped for more. It's a very good movie.

Unfortunately this is a terribly flawed film and this begins with Orlando Bloom who is terribly miscast. Dirt and grit does not make you either masculine or heroic.  Bloom is alleged to be a "blacksmith" but he is probably about 50 pounds too light to be convincing in that role.  We are expected to believe that in a matter of hours / days he becomes a skilled warrior capable of ending off some well armed and mounted men-at-arms.  Mastering the broadsword requires a great deal more practice.<br /><br />The villains in the film are based on actual characters and come across pretty much like I think they were.  The Muslims are portrayed in a rather sympathetic light which isn't too far from the historical record.  I thought the film was relatively slow, Bloom was miscast, but the photography was good as were the costumes.  I thought the storyline was a little too politically correct and the ending was simply not believable.  A little more action might have helped.  Overall a so-so film but one that could have been better.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>Talk about a whole different movie.

I have a feeling this version would have been up for the Best Picture Oscar if the studio didn't force Ridley to chop it up.

Go buy the 4 Disc Set, you'll love it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VIOCJZ22JZXT.html">A3VIOCJZ22JZXT</a><br/><p>This is a very entertaining DVD, full of action with very well constructed and filmed battle scenes of great scope. In some ways the film is very timely considering that there is a tension between the current Western civilization of America and Europe and the Islamic world that stretches across Asia. I found it interesting that the film depicts those Christians who are tolerant of a multicultural and diverse nation with those Christians that are not tolerant of other's religious beliefs. In this film, Balian (played by Orlando Bloom), his father, and the king of Jerusalem ( a pitiful leper hiding behind a silver mask) represent those forces that can live with diversity of spiritual beliefs.  The Templar Knights represent those forces that can not live with diversity and multiculturalism for it threatens them. In this film, the Muslims are a powerful military force that also is diverse in tolerance or non-tolerance for Christians. It is a beautiful film, with fascinating architecture, set construction, and weapon and costume design. The battle for the city of Jerusalem is exciting, a dramatic high point, and a critical aspect of the film. Saladin wins the battle and Jerusalem is handed over to the Muslims. Remember that after the death of Jesus, the apostles and disciples spread Christianity into Egypt and Ethiopia, into Rome, France, Spain, England, and Ireland. Also Christianity was spread into Eastern Europe such as Romania, Hungary, Germany. Christianity was spread into present day Syria, Jordan, Iraq, and Iran. Thus the sweep of Islam across the world in around the year 600 brought Islam to Christian communities and cities across the Middle East. It is in response to this growing Islamic power and dominance over the Middle East for 700 years that the Crusades were waged - which is a primary theme of the film. Yet this is not a Christians hate Muslims who in turn hate Christians type of film. Instead the writers and film-makers imply that the Kingdom of Heaven is attainable here on earth through the belief in tolerance for other's beliefs about God. This is actually a good message for our day and time - which director Ridley Scott obviously knows.</p></br></body></html>

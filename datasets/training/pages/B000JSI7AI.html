They find this in Brokeback Mountain in a small Wyoming city.  What they find is much more than just summer work; rather, much more than what they expected.  After months of staying in the camp site hurdling sheep and other duties, they find love within one another.  Neither had examined their sexualities before arriving at Brokeback Mountain.  The end of the summer leaves them heartbroken due to the separation.  Ennis stays in Wyoming, marries a woman named Alma, and has two girls.  Jack moves to Texas, intenses his career as a cowboy, marries a woman named Lureen, and has a boy.  Five years later, Ennis and Jack reunite and discover that their love they shared remains.  However, society and the times prevent them from sharing the love as deep as their desires.  This relationship leads to romance and heartbreak.<br /><br />"Brokeback Mountain", adapted from the short story of the same name by Annie Proulx, was beautifully crafted by its cast and crew.  It proceeded to receive nominations and win several major awards, including eight Oscar nominations (including Best Picture) leading to three wins (Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Original Score).  Its emotional impact remains alive throughout the film.  They beautifully express the characters' pain and turmoil caused by a homophobic society.  This adaptation is one of the best screenplays written in many years.  Few other filmmakers have crafted a storyline that compiles twenty-five years of events within only two hours while sharing its story so deeply.  Its storyline placement and series of events proved highly difficult, yet succeeded in many ways.<br /><br />Many are quick to label "Brokeback Mountain" a gay film.  However, it is much more than that.  It is a story of love, secrets, loneliness, and struggle to express their true selves.  This is one of many qualities that make this film so groundbreaking.  Therefore, its viewers will quickly recall the characters Ennis and Jack and how much of an impact they made.  This is the first film with a romance of two people of the same sex as its primary subject line to receive such critical success.  Therefore, this will surely open doors for other filmmakers to continue pushing the envelope.<br /><br />This film could not have been so monumental through its emotional stance if it wasn't for the actors' hard work.  Three of its eight Oscar nominations were for acting: Best Actor (Heath Ledger), Best Supporting Actor (Jake Gyllenhaal), and Best Supporting Actress (Michelle Williams).  For years, Ledger and Gyllenhaal have been underrated talent-wise, despite several wonderful performances (Ledger's "The Patriot", "Monster's Ball"; Gyllenhaal's "The Good Girl", "Donnie Darko").  Ledger's performance as Ennis, a quiet and lonely man, showcases his talents further than in the past.  Gyllenhaal's performance as Jack, an eccentric and and outgoing man, fits well with Ennis and the overall film.  Williams and Anne Hathaway successfully placed their teenage image aside for the film.  Williams proves that she is much more than just "Dawson's Creek" as the lonely and gentle Alma.  Hathaway proves that she is much more than just "The Princess Diaries" as the sassy and feisty Lureen.<br /><br />Such film quality proves that "Brokeback Mountain" will stand beyond the test of time.  Therefore, this is destined to become a classic.  Hopefully by that time, the government will have legalized same-sex marriage.</p></br><a href="../users/A18M68DE1Y6W51.html">A18M68DE1Y6W51</a><br/><p>I am speechless at the utter brilliance of this beautiful movie, which I had missed in the theaters, to my great regret. Having read Annie Proulx's short story from which the movie was taken first, I can testify to the movie's phenomenally accurate, delicate and moving translation into film.<br /><br />What angers me beyond belief is all the adolescent, giggly jokes we had to endure for how many weeks? On every late-night show, and even at the Oscars themselves, absolutely everybody had a "gay cowboy" joke. But that's not what this story is about at all. Not even close.<br /><br />The intense unbreakable bond between Jack and Ennis examines the very essence of being human. Meeting at age 19, each has already been weathered by unspeakably harsh conditions, both environtally and spiritually. Ennis barely speaks. Jack is guarded and wary. On a summer looking after sheep in a starkly remote area of Wyoming, they are the only two human beings on the planet. And a bond between them forms and grows into something neither wants, but neither can break.<br /><br />Gosh, yuck yuck, let's get Jay Leno to make some more jokes! Or maybe, just maybe, those who haven't seen this movie can put aside their preordained "opinions" and just watch it unfold.<br /><br />Incredible directing by Ang Lee, incredible writing, spectacular photography and acting (Heath Ledger is incredibly talented as Ennis, in what might be the role of his career, but all the actors are superb), and lush, gorgeous music are all part of the whole--Brokeback Mountain is a masterpiece.<br /><br />My one tiny criticism of the DVD itself is that the music seems to drown out the dialogue, some of which is so soft that it is impossible to hear without turning the volume way up. Believe me, this is a small criticism and not enough to turn anyone away from this incredible movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1F2EYORWOZ3G1.html">A1F2EYORWOZ3G1</a><br/><p>I was hesitant about this movie for one reason. From the previews I saw I figured it depicted gay men in a negative light by getting married and eventually hurting the women and children they belonged to. But I was wrong.<br /><br />This movie isn't about that. It is about love, plain and simple.<br /><br />There aren't the descriptives here to express the ability this movie has to move you.<br /><br />The acting is stellar from all. The story is excellent and carried out very well on screen. The cinematography is breathtaking at times and the music truly reflects the mood.<br /><br />The basic theme of this movie is that love will strike in it's own time, and with whomever it deems is 'the one'. The love that struck the two main characters here was taboo and they do the best they can to quell the fire within them. When the realization hits that it's bigger than the mountain they met on they meet throughout the rest of their lives to satiate the need they have for each other.<br /><br />The angst, confusion, identity issues and all the other problems that would go with a 'taboo' love are what carry this movie.<br /><br />An unlikely forerunner in the award category, this movie is destined to be a classic. It has all the right elements.<br /><br />If you have been hesitant to watch this movie because of the theme do yourself a favor.... rent it and watch it. It has a lot to say about life and love.</p></br><a href="../users/A39IBJB2PBVC7I.html">A39IBJB2PBVC7I</a><br/><p>Brokeback Mountain has certainly given rise to a wave of homophobic jokes, reflecting a national nervousness about the subject, especially when applied to that most archetypically male American activity, cowboy life.  Ironically, there should be no surprise whatever that male-dominated societal enclaves like the military, the clergy, and the State Department are rife with homosexuality, no matter how secretive or repressed.  But this is not even the point of Brokeback Mountain, which is not a "gay cowboy movie" any more than Jaws is a fishing movie.<br /><br />Brokeback Mountain is a love story, specifically a story of forbidden love, and the horrifying emotional toll such a situation takes.  As with Legends Of The Fall, the real hero is Wyoming, Ang Lee has given us a loving, idyllic vision of the American West that seems to glow with purity and splendor.  (Let's protect it!)  Texas does not get off quite so easily, few people know better than writer Larry McMurty how god-awful flat, dry, and just plain miserable it is.  As to Annie Proulx, (just can't bear to add that affected E. in front of her name), whose story provided the foundation for the film, what can one say except that - wherever you find humanity's saddest qualities, darkest despair, and most senselessly cruel and violent tendencies, there you will find Ms. Proulx!  That's the spirit, Annie!<br /><br />Ledger's performance is haunting; his hurt seems to rise off him like steam.  Gyllenhaal, a terrific actor with a name that's hard to spell, is also outstanding, although his western twang does seem suspect at times.  Great supporting work by the wives.  Michelle Williams, as Alma Del Mar, is every bit as injured and silent as her husband, trapped and very sympathetic.  Anne Hathaway, as the Texas heavy equipment Princess, is perfection; there is a toughness to her that's very believable.<br /><br />The hype surrounding Brokeback Mountain was unfortunate, but inevitable.  Viewers who are able to put their homophobia in park for a couple of hours will discover a masterfully crafted film about two individual human beings attempting to find love in a world exquisitely designed to deny them access to it.  No matter what part of town you're from, that's always a heartbreaker.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>I waited to see this film divorced from the hype on it's initial release.  Anybody reluctant to see this film can relax because it's not going to change your inclinations.  Is this a great film?  That's debatable but it is a very good one.  I was impressed with a few things about this film primarily the direction by Ang Lee.  He allows the story to develope deliberately.  He doesn't shy away from the provocative nature of Ennis and Jack's relationship but it is told with discretion and taste.  Another thing that impressed me was the towering performance by Heath Ledger as Ennis.  Ennis is a taciturn man who does not verbalize his emotions but allows them to burn inside.  This kind of role in the wrong hands could come off as one note but Ledger pulls it off brilliantly.  Jake Gyllenhall is fine as Jack but his performance pales in comparison to Ledger's.  Great supporting work is offered here by Michelle Williams, Anne Hathaway, Linda Cardellini and Randy Quaid.  Another bonus is the splendid cinematography and the touching score.</p></br><a href="../users/A2E3F04ZK7FG66.html">A2E3F04ZK7FG66</a><br/><p>This film is about love lost for the sake of keeping up appearances that, in the end, just makes everyone involved miserable. Ennis and Jack are two young men who spend the summer of 1963 herding sheep in Wyoming on an isolated mountain in Wyoming. Ennis is the strong silent type in the Gary Cooper tradition, while Jack is more outgoing. During the two months they are together they become friends and then lovers. Had the time and place been different, they would have probably stayed together, based on the powerful scene in which they go their separate ways after that first summer. However, with the culture being that of the rugged mountain west and the time that of the early sixties, this was an impossibility. The reaction of their boss and Ennis' wife when they discover what is going on tells you what they could have looked forward to if they had been open about their relationship - muted ostracism by daylight, perhaps violence come nightfall. At first, the two just try to put their feelings for each other behind them. Ennis, already engaged, goes through with his marriage as planned and fathers two daughters. Jack goes back to Texas, meets and marries the daughter of a wealthy farm equipment dealer, and fathers a son. Four years after their initial separation, Jack returns to Wyoming and their relationship picks up where it left off - still a secret, this time on the pretext of week-long "fishing trips" they take two or three times a year for the next fifteen years, never able to tell anyone about their love, never able to show their affection in public. Many have mentioned that the two were just cheating on their wives all of this time, but the fact is if they had been able to follow their hearts, they would have never had wives to begin with.<br /><br />Much of what is great about this film is what is left unsaid. Is Ennis actually homosexual or did he just fall in love with someone who happened to be a man? Did Jack die the way his wife said he did or he way Ennis imagined? Did Jack lie to Ennis that last time they were together and say he was having an affair with a woman because he knew Ennis would be jealous of another man but not another woman? Did Jack deliberately take Ennis' shirt as a reminder of him that first summer or did he just find it and decide to keep it? The acting is tremendous, and I find myself mourning the tragedy of the characters in this film as though they were real people, although I'm sure their situation represents many real ones past and present. This is a beautiful and thoughtful film that definitely should have won the Best Picture Oscar. Jack and Ennis' double lives just leave themselves, their wives, and everyone else who is close to them feeling empty and just add up to time and opportunity lost. Only the unwritten rules of society and conformity come out the winner in this one.</p></br><a href="../users/AUSATFDSU2INS.html">AUSATFDSU2INS</a><br/><p>The cinematographic achievements of Brokeback Mountain have been buried under the controversy generated by its argument: a homosexual relationship between two cowboys. Of course, such scandal was to be expected, because if there's a stereotype more traditional and almost sacred in the United States, is the rude and very masculine cowboy.<br /><br />The western is a genre associated with a misogynistic point of view, always related with iconic figures such as Clint Eastwood and the very macho John Wayne; so, from this limited scoop, it's not rare that Brokeback Mountain put itself in the eye of a storm.<br /><br />Based on a short novel written by Annie Proulx, the movie narrates the story between two men for almost twenty years. When they meet in the 60's, Ennis (Heath Ledger) and Jack (Jake Gyllenhaal) are two young kids hired to watch a herd of sheep. Ennis is the quiet, shy one, engaged to marry Alma (Michelle Williams) and Jack is the free-spirited one, always happy, optimistic and a first-class dreamer. In Brokeback Mountain, both men surrender their souls to a forbidden love, and after doing this, they return to their routines, hoping to put behind a life-changing experience that would chase them forever.<br /><br />The years pass, and Jack and Ennis have their very decent and normal families. Until one day, they meet again. And this meeting marks the turbulent, painful and harrowing beginning of a prohibited and irregular relationship, with devastating consequences.<br /><br />Social prejudices, hypocritical morals, intolerance an narrow minds are some of the obstacles that Ennis and Jack's love must endure. The other obstacle, the worst, is their battle with themselves. Jack, more open and clear about what he wants, what happiness means to him, is more willing to make choices that will cost him, but he'll do them anyway. Ennis is more cautious, in part because he's incapable of admit who he really is, what are his true feelings, always afraid of what people will think, afraid of rejection, afraid of speak freely about his emotions.<br /><br />And here is where Brokeback Mountain succeeds. It's not an ordinary movie about two guys having sex or making out. It's a movie about a love that aspires, above everything, the freedom to love without censorship; a love that seeks respect, dignity and the opportunity to be lived at its fullest. Director Ang Lee has beautifully crafted one of the greatest love stories of all times, one that will transcend its characters. Slow, with a gorgeous cinematography and a paused tone, Brokeback Mountain is simply a moving and tragic tale of two secret lovers; and these lovers could very well be heterosexual. But then, who would find this original and interesting?</p></br><a href="../users/AY6A8KPYCE6B0.html">AY6A8KPYCE6B0</a><br/><p>This movie really is as huge as the hype has made it out to be.  First it's really the first gay love story (if you want to call it a love story) to go mainstream, second it's got two pulitzer prize winners and Ang Lee involved, third it's got the best acting I have ever seen on film, and when you mix everything together you get the most professional adaptation of a written work I wouldn't want to say ever done, but it certainly might be.<br /><br />You probably know the story by now, so I won't go on with plot summeries, but I will tell you what made me attend this film 4 times at the theater:<br /><br />As an English major this movie was like literary heaven.  After the first time I watched it I was blown away by all the foreshadow, symbolism, parallels, and poetric transitions that this film did perfectly.  For instance, Jack always misses what he "shoots" (coyote, deer) but Ennis hits them.  In a sense Ennis has "hit" Jack, but Jack can never really "hit" Ennis.<br /><br />At the end of one scene Alma throws down mail and the camera captures an ad for Honey.  In the next seen Jack says "Honey" to his wife.  What a great Poetic transition!<br /><br />There are many parallels, most notably that embrace from behind.  Jack and Ennis do it twice, once while in the motel and another during the flashback when Jack is "sleeping like a horse."  Alma also embraces Ennis from behind in the first bedroom scene when she wants to move into town.  Even the their two shirts together in the end can be considered an embrace from behind.<br /><br />Jack foreshadows his outcome by wearing purple in one scene.<br /><br />I could go on and on and on with all the fun English and Literary goodies I found by watching the movie--trust me, I took pen and paper into the theater and filled up 5 front-and-back pages of notes.  But I think I can summerize how I feel about this film by simply saying it is outstanding, and will always be considered Best Picture no matter what the Oscars have to say.</p></br><a href="../users/A1129LM24YWSZV.html">A1129LM24YWSZV</a><br/><p>Brokeback Mountain is the tale of two cowboys, Ennis and Jack, who ranch sheep together one summer in the 1960's. One cold night, the two men huddle together in a tent to keep warm, and an explosive physical relationship erupts. They both agree that the night was a "one-shot deal," but somehow the two men keep finding one another again, throughout the summer. After the ranching gig ends, both men nonchalantly tell each other goodbye, but the separation is painful for both. Cut to four years later - the men have gone their separate ways, married, had kids. But when they happen to see each other again, old feelings almost violently assert themselves, leading to a 20-year relationship that is by turns passionate, furtive, and tortured.<br /><br />First of all, performances by Heath Ledger (Ennis) and Jake Gyllenhaal (Jack) are unbelievable. I cannot adequately describe the performance work in this film. Ledger, who I'd only seen in fairly superficial roles - teen movies, not-so-great romantic comedies - totally transforms himself for this role. Tight-lipped, sun-baked, and shamed, his Ennis provides the tension in the film that powers the plot through to its final, saddening conclusion. Gyllenhaal plays Jack, the more honest, self-accepting of the two men, with an emotion that is strong enough to be real but restrained enough to epitomize the tough guy image of a Western. Both lend a haunting quality to the various ways in which Ennis and Jack try to live their lives, denied of the one thing they truly want.<br /><br />At the end of the day, Brokeback Mountain is a love story, the tale of two people who love each other but can't be together. This is not untrod territory in Hollywood. However, hanging this familiar storyline on a less-than-mainstream social topic for the movies - homosexuality - proves to be very powerful. The intensity of the two men's feelings for one another, and the delayed gratification that is the bedrock of their relationship, bring their experience into sharp focus for the viewer. Beautiful scenes of mountainous countryside and a strong, simple acoustic guitar accompaniment add to the poignancy. I just cannot recommend it highly enough. It will haunt you. It will make you think. It will move you.<br /><br />Fair warning - there is one brief sex scene between the two primary characters. If you don't warm to that idea, I recommend getting the film on DVD and fast-forwarding through that part. It is not worth missing the movie over.</p></br><a href="../users/AY6A8KPYCE6B0.html">AY6A8KPYCE6B0</a><br/><p>I want to mention two things about this movie. First, how brilliant it is. And second, how beautiful the blu ray transfer looks.<br /><br />1. It's been six years since Brokeback Mountain hit theaters, and though I've watched the film countless times since, if I had only seen it once, I can promise you I would never forget it. It is a storyline that you dream about, relate to, cry over, reflect upon, write about, and become haunted by. I watch a lot of movies and enjoy plenty of them, but never has a film inspired me to analyze its story so deeply and to read books on it by film critics and touched fans. The fourth time I watched it at the theater, I took a notebook and filled pages with notes on the beauty of the poetic transitions and the development of characters. But even during my 20th viewing (or however many times it has been now) I discovered new richness and depth in the story.<br /><br />Without going on and on, I suppose I should just say that I love this movie. But before I talk about the blu ray, I just want to point out that this is not strictly a "gay" movie any more than Titanic or Romeo and Juliet are straight movies. Love is a force of nature, as the tag-line says, and it is not bound to one sexuality or another. The movie is, simply put, a human movie about human life, desire, hate, mistakes, and many other universal emotions that make up us all. I recommend you see it and after it's over, I recommend you see it again. Like Shakespeare, the story is endlessly multidimensional and deserves multiple viewings to truly grasp it all. Obviously Annie Proulx's original short story is also required reading (I would suggest reading it before watching, but either way is fine) as it contains endless brilliance as well. The overall talent involved with this project is stunning.<br /><br />But let's move on and talk about the blu ray.<br /><br />2. The first thing I should mention is that this "100th Anniversary" new packaging from Universal Studios doesn't mean that there are any new features or remastered transfers that are different from the already available <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001QWEE4E">Brokeback Mountain  [Blu-ray</a>]. It does come in combo-pack format, however, which includes a DVD and Digital Copy of the film if that interests you.<br /><br />As far as the picture quality goes, I feel pretty confident when I say that I was blown away by it. I saw the movie in theaters, on DVD, on TV, and just about anywhere else I could find it. On Blu Ray, it was a whole new experience. You can read labels on soup cans, feel the richness of the grass, and see foam in the spring waters. Without question, this is a scenic movie. It DESERVES to be seen in 1080p. If you have the DVD, great, it's pretty good too, but this is so worth the upgrade. The picture is so beautiful, sometimes I just pop it in the player on mute and let it run as a "screensaver."<br /><br />The audio is also a joy. Gustavo Santaolalla's score is a masterpiece in itself and all the more beautiful in lossless DTS 5.1. Not to mention Heath Ledger's character is a bit of the shy type who mumbles as much as he speaks. I never had a problem understanding him, but the speech is noticeably clearer now for anybody who found that to be an issue.<br /><br />As far as the special features go, they are just repeats from the DVD release and admittedly not very exciting. Worth watching, sure, but not especially noteworthy. In some ways I think that's a good thing, though. As much as I would love Ang Lee to do a director's commentary, this type of movie will effect people in different ways and consequently I don't know that I would feel comfortable if the artists behind it revealed too much. That can easily frame the story in a certain way and ruin it for those who are touched by it in other ways. As I said, this is a universally human story, and it's a great movie for fans and scholars to discuss and compare experiences, but when the film-makers themselves start talking it...it can potentially ruin things.<br /><br />OVERALL: A+++ movie that will, without question, go into the Love Story Hall of Fame where it will stand next to other classics like Pride and Prejudice, Romeo and Juliet, Wuthering Heights, and so many other touching classics, gay and striaght alike. As far as the Blu Ray, it also deserves an "A" rating for its beautiful HD transfer that is everything a fan could ask for and more. I highly recommend purchasing it.<br /><br />And, if you are like the many who can't stop thinking about the movie and want to dive deeper into the literary genius of the story, here are some books that inspired me: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0743294165">Brokeback Mountain: Story to Screenplay</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0786430443">Reading Brokeback Mountain: Essays on the Story and the Film</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0739121650">On Brokeback Mountain: Meditations about Masculinity, Fear, and Love in the Story and the Film</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0803226640">The Brokeback Book: From Story to Cultural Phenomenon</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1595941223">Beyond Brokeback: The Impact of a Film</a>.</p></br><a href="../users/A24ZFFRQ4MG3XL.html">A24ZFFRQ4MG3XL</a><br/><p>Brokeback Mountain is a unique, brilliant and well acted movie.  I wasn't sure if I would like it, but I found myself loving it.  How could you not.  There was stunning scenery and a fantastic score, amazing script and last but not least, some of the best acting we've seen in many years.<br /><br />After working together on Brokeback Mountain, these two cowboys find more than just a friendship - they find forbidden love.  Their first meeting happend in 1963 where homophobia would have been far worse than it is today.  What follows is a moving story of two men trying to come to grips with their feelings for each other and their family life at home with their wives and children.<br /><br />This is a must see for everyone.  You may not think you'll like it, but you will be blown away.  It's one of the best movies I've seen in such a long time and this was thoroughly enjoyable.</p></br><a href="../users/A3MQ672FYFNM7B.html">A3MQ672FYFNM7B</a><br/><p>"Brokeback Mountain" is the story of two all-man cowboys that find love in each other. The film is unique because it is not the typical gay stereo-type; perhaps it is the first mainstream film ever made on this topic?<br /><br />Ennis Del Mar (played by the very talented Heath Ledger) is a very quiet and rough around the edges kind of man. He doesn't show his feelings very well and is somewhat of a loner. Jack Twist (played by the equally accomplished Jake Gyllenhaal) is more vocal about his feelings and emotions, but can still be pushed around (although I did enoy it when he stood up to his bigoted father-in-law).<br /><br />What makes this tale so bitter is that their's is a forbidden love. It is reminiscent of "Titanic" or Romeo and Juliet. Please keep in mind that the picture took place during 60's, 70's, and early 80's, in Middle-America where no one was openly homosexual, much less a cowboy. But, despite all their differences and personal demons both men loved each other more than life itself.<br /><br />Anyone with connected eyeballs can tell that Ennis and Twist were deeply in love (this was not an affair, rather it was a serious relationship that lasted over two decades). It was proof that Twist loved Ennis when they were on the hill getting ready to leave after he playfully lassoed and punched Ennis. Twist looked so sad to have intentionally inflicted pain on his lover. But Ennis holed off and punched him, because no one was gonna make Ennis his fool. And it was evident that Ennis loved Twist when he sobbed like a baby on the street after they departed Brokeback Mountain separately.<br /><br />The cinematography in this picture was absolutely stunning. The soundtrack is also amazing.<br /><br />I saw this movie over a month ago and I still can't get it out of my mind. It is a very full-toned and haunting picture. To say that it was the very best film that I have ever seen would simply trivialize it, because it is much more than just a movie.</p></br><a href="../users/AGQY11NLQJ2JL.html">AGQY11NLQJ2JL</a><br/><p>OK, I'm not a big fan of homosexuality; it just doesn't concern me, but....who can deny that this is a great performance?? Heath Ledger was an incredible talent;  if u met him, you would fall in love with him no matter if you were a man or a woman.<br /><br />Gay or straight, after all, they were in love; Try to understand that, dear perfect people.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>I believe we can. This movie will be remembered for years and years to come due to its superb acting, majestic cinematography, incredible dialog, intense emotion, cogent storyline, and the excellent score converged into making this two-hour-plus movie one of the great landmarks in the history of the cinema. I agree with those who say that this movie will be discussed and studied, along with the great ones: `Casablanca,' `Citizen Kane,' etc......<br /><br />Heath Ledger's rough-and-tough-but-tender-and-vulnerable performance is so believable that very little make-up was required in order to try to convince the audience that he is aging right before our eyes. As you watch him, you really do believe that this taciturn young roughneck is actually becoming a middle-aged man who is coming to terms with day to day responsibilities, family life, and an ever-present, nagging, burning need to hold onto a love that will not let him go (Sorry, couldn't resist that phrase). Can't say what has already been said regarding Michelle Williams, Jake Gyllenhaal, and Anne Hathaway because we all know they gave excellent performances.<br /><br />The last twenty minutes of the movie comprise some of the most gut-wrenching and emotionally painful experiences I have rarely encountered in a movie. This film is really hard to forget even though there is a gay context to this film it contains universal themes of love, intense longing, disappointment, infidelity, passion and sexual desire, all of which are applicable to all people, everywhere and anywhere.<br /><br />Ang Lee has done another amazing job putting this film together that was well deserved.</p></br><a href="../users/A38YUU4J5Q4EJO.html">A38YUU4J5Q4EJO</a><br/><p>The story is of 2 ranch hands that work hearding sheep on Brokeback Mountain for a summer in the 60's.<br />Though homosexuality was taboo back then, Jack Twist (Jake Gylenhaal) and Enis DelMar (Heath Ledger) are drawn to each other, and become lovers this particular summer.<br /><br />When Summer is over, they must part ways, and Enis tells Jack he is about to be married to his fiance' (Michelle Williams)<br />The following summer Jack checks back in at Brokeback to see if Enis had come back again for the summer. He hasn't, So Jack Twist goes on reluctantly with his life, and he also gets married (More for financial reasons than love)  4 years pass.<br /><br />Jack writes a letter to Enis saying he will be there for a visit. When he shows, all those old feelings resurface, and they head back to Brokeback, and it continues that way throughout the years, and through the years Enis rejects the idea of settling down together as a couple because of a gay-hate killing he saw as a child.<br /><br />The movie moves along nicely, to show the ups and downs of not only thier relationship, but thier relationships to others, thier friends and families throughout the years.<br /><br />There is a very heartfelt ending to this movie that I won't give away, but it will leave you thinking about "Brokeback Mountain" long after it is over.<br /><br />The acting is phenominal, the setting is beautiful, and the directing is flawless. One of my favorite movies of all time.</p></br><a href="../users/A21B2TJBWCSK1R.html">A21B2TJBWCSK1R</a><br/><p>Now that the hype surrounding Brokeback Mountain has started to die down, one can get past all of the superlatives heralding Ang Lee's film as a classic and all of the jokey puns on the film's title and concentrate on what makes it really work: the love story between two men. Much was made about it being the first mainstream movie about gay cowboys but it was also an achievement for Lee that he was able to bounce back from the commercial and critical disappointment that was Hulk.<br /><br />Heath Ledger has gone from teen comedies like 10 Things I Hate About You to such diverse roles as the ones in Lords of Dogtown and The Brothers Grimm. This performance may be his finest yet. It is a very internalized one. Ennis doesn't communicate very much verbally but rather through physical gestures and by his eyes. It also doesn't hurt that Ledger has the rugged good looks that are ideal for this role.<br /><br />Jake Gyllenhaal turns in yet another excellent performance as a hopeless romantic stuck in a marriage with someone he doesn't truly love. One gets the feeling that the time away from Ennis affects him the most but it is only because it is visible in the way he acts and in his eyes. He's the one who pushes hardest from the two of them to discard their traditional lives and be together all the time. However, as the film progresses, we begin to realize that their time apart hurts Ennis just as much - he just keeps it bottled up inside.<br /><br />There is a touching intimacy to Jack and Ennis' relationship. It isn't just physical, it is also about companionship. When you spend that amount of time with someone you get to know them really well. It is the kind of relationship that changes the course of their lives. Ultimately, Brokeback Mountain is a tragic love story - even more so because we get to know Jack and Ennis so well. We become emotionally invested in their lives and we know that they can never be together in the way that they would like. Ang Lee's film is one of those rare ones that actually does live up to its hype and definitely worth a look.<br /><br />"On Being a Cowboy" takes a look at the cowboy camp that the actors went through so that they could get an idea of what that kind of life was like and portray it convincingly on camera. Ledger actually grew up on a farm and had plenty of experience riding horses.<br /><br />"Directing from the Heart: Ang Lee" is a love fest for the director. The cast praise his direction and talk about how much they admire him.<br /><br />"From Script to Screen: Interviews with Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana" features the two screenwriters talking about their first reaction to Annie Proulx's short story that first appeared in the pages of The New Yorker.<br /><br />Finally, there is "Sharing the Story: The Making of Brokeback Mountain" that originally aired on the Logo channel. It follows your typical making of featurette that mixes interview soundbites with clips from the movie. This is a nice if not superficial look at the movie.</p></br><a href="../users/ARFCORBCTKX1J.html">ARFCORBCTKX1J</a><br/><p>I've added to and slightly revised this review, and appended comments about the Blu-ray edition.<br /><br />I've waited almost two years to review this film: it took me that long to work up the courage to watch "Crash", the viewing of which seemed a prerequisite for my claiming any degree of objectivity or intellectual honesty in reviewing "Brokeback". (I've posted a review of that film, as well.) I also wanted to be certain I'd found the right things to say and the right way to say them. There are so many things to discuss about "Brokeback Mountain" they could fill a book. Hopefully, someone will write one (qv, Jerome Agel's "The Making of Kubrick's 2001", a fine book about another controversial film).<br /><br />Of all the reviews, pro or con, the most-significant came from World Net Daily, an ultra-far-right religious publication. You'd expect its "Brokeback Mountain" review to be titled something like "Hollywood Liberals Aggressively Promote Homosexual Agenda". But, no -- it's "Rape of the Marlboro Man". (Yes!) The review argues that homosexuals are trying to appropriate the upright, decent, manly image of the cowboy to encourage acceptance of their own debased/depraved/perverted views of manhood.<br /><br />One doesn't have to know much Western history to recognize that the traditional view of the cowboy as "the man on the white horse" doesn't bear close examination. Cowboys were rough-living men who drank, gambled, and whored with little restraint.<br /><br />Cowboys and other Westerners were often solitary men - that's always been part of their mystique. (See "The Myth of the American Superhero" by Lawrence & Jewett.) Many left the East to get away from society, from government, from social pressures (including those to marry). From "The Last of the Mohicans" to "Lonesome Dove", frontiersmen have been laconic loners. (Well... Gus McCrae isn't exactly laconic. But Woodrow F Call makes up for it.)<br /><br />Cowboys and other western pioneers lived in an overwhelmingly homosocial environment. Whores provided a convenient sexual outlet, whereas marriage brought with it social fetters. Men therefore looked to other men for companionship -- and sometimes other things.<br /><br />The emotionally intimate relationships of Western males has been written about for a century and a half. Mark Twain observed homosexual behavior among prospectors. Charles Badger Clark's "The Lost Pardner", one of the all-time most-popular cowboy poems, outlines the near-sexual -- and explicitly misogynistic * -- relationship of two wranglers. Yet heterosexual males read it without embarrassment -- or seeming awareness of the poem's implications -- because the truth it speaks about intense male friendships likely masks its truth about male sexuality. Clark's "Bachin'" extols the delights of a female-free life ("...in our trouble list we never count a wife"). Its opening line -- "Our ways are hid; our trails are strange" -- and the later "Each has a reason why he's lone, but keeps it 'neath his hat" ares suggestive. Clark's less-familiar poem "My Enemy" ends with the adversaries not only making up, but also apparently making out. The implication is subtle, but Clark's writing shows such a consistently careful choice of words that it's difficult to read the meaning of "and when dark found us limp and jaded" otherwise.<br /><br />Several Bret Harte stories express a startling homoeroticism. The men of "Tennessee's Partner" and "In the Tules" share a love for each other that's "consummated" only in the afterlife. The implied "marriage" of Tennessee and his male partner did not prevent this story from becoming one of Harte's most-popular, probably because it was written toward the end of an era when it was not uncommon for men to express effusive love for each other, and the Romantic fancy of lovers uniting in death had not yet faded. "Tennessee's Partner" is a fine example of hiding something in plain sight.<br /><br />If "Brokeback Mountain" deviates from our view of the West, that view is the view presented by Hollywood and TV -- not the view of the people who actually lived and worked in the West. You cannot truly "rape" (in any sense of the word) someone or something that never existed.<br /><br />The inconvenient truths are... Men like sex. When women aren't around (and sometimes when they are), they'll have it with each other. And -- yes -- even unerringly masculine men will engage in mutual sodomy (as Jack and Ennis do), however unbelievable that might seem to heterosexual males reading this. (I speak from direct experience.) "Brokeback Mountain" is a gut punch to the American view of what constitutes "masculinity", which is why it attracted the outrage of groups and people that might otherwise ignore films with homosexual characters or themes.<br /><br />Those who'd like to investigate this subject in greater depth should read "Queer Cowboys" by Chris Packard and "Male-Male Intimacy in Early America" by William Benemann.<br /><br />Larry McMurtry has famously said "the story was just sitting there, waiting to be told". (For a writer notorious for demythologizing the West, why hadn't _he_ told it? **) Yet it /has/ been told, many times. "Brokeback Mountain" doesn't stand in isolation, but is firmly in the tradition of stories about frontiersmen sharing marriage-like relationships with indigenous males or other frontiersmen. *** "Brokeback Mountain" is simply the first time a serious writer has told that story without ignoring or "coding" its sexual elements. ****<br /><br />Larry McMurtry bragged about using virtually all the dialog from the short story. This is not true. Some significant material was removed, such as Ennis telling Jack of the overwhelming sexual attraction he feels for him, and Jack's telling Ennis why he finds sodomy with him so pleasurable. (I asked a bisexual horseman whether Jack's understanding of the physiology involved was correct, and he said it was.)<br /><br />McMurtry's novels don't shy away from sex, but he isn't interested in graphic depictions, and "Brokeback Mountain"'s film treatment reflects this. As late as a year before filming began, the screenplay had the camera coyly averting its eye as Ennis mounted Jack.<br /><br />But McMurtry doesn't limit himself to avoiding graphic sex -- he tries to de-sexualize the story. Though Annie Proulx describes Jack and Ennis as engaging in hot, sweaty sex up on Brokeback, the film shows them only briefly rolling around -- and that through Aguirre's binoculars. More significantly, the screenplay omits an important moment in their final tryst -- Jack putting his hand between Ennis's thighs to warm it, while Ennis unbuttons Jack's shirt.<br /><br />These omissions support the only valid criticism of the film -- it's overly reserved. Its basic reserve is a good thing -- the story easily lends itself to overwrought melodrama. Had the direction or acting been not so restrained, the effect would have been ludicrous, and "Brokeback Mountain" would have died a quick and unlamented death.<br /><br />But the restraint is excessive. The film fails to fully show what the short story makes clear -- 20 years haven't dimmed Ennis and Jack's crude lust for each other. We need to see them, on that final camping trip, pulling each other's clothes off and wrestling in front of the fire, kissing each other as violently as they had in front of Ennis's apartment. This scene would make their final argument and Ennis's ultimate acknowledgement of their mutual love all the more poignant and pathetic (in the good sense).<br /><br />As fine as Ang Lee's direction is (it's equivalent to walking on snow without leaving footprints), Peter Bogdanovich might have been a bit less "arty" and might have better caught the intensity of Ennis and Jack's relationship, without stepping over the line into melodrama. (Think of the pool-table scene in "The Last Picture Show".) And in the fantasy world of "if only", imagine the same script and actors directed by Alfred Hitchcock, with a Bernard Herrmann score. (Before you protest, note that "Brokeback Mountain" is, thematically, very much a Hitchcock story.)<br /><br />The religious right would like people to believe movie reviewers are a liberal lot consciously promoting "the homosexual agenda", and that "Brokeback Mountain" provided the perfect opportunity. Rubbish. Reviewers -- even those as intellectually shallow and confused as Michael Medved -- recognized a great film when they saw it. "Brokeback Mountain" speaks a truth many people want to suppress -- men become emotionally involved with each other, and have sex with each other, just as men and women do.<br /><br />Indeed -- and I emphasize this point to any uncomfortable hetereo males who've read this far -- men can and do have intense emotional relationships with each other /without/ sexual desire. I've had such relationships with hetero men, and know there are many straight guys out there who want emotional -- though not sexual -- intimacy with other men. Unfortunately, they often have to go to queer men for it, because most hetero men are just too cowardly.<br /><br />But is "Brokeback Mountain" _truly_ a great film? Well, it's an /iconic film -- as iconic as 2001, The Adventures of Robin Hood, Casablanca, Chinatown, Citizen Kane, King Kong, Network (another Best Picture loser), The Maltese Falcon, Snow White, or The Wizard of Oz. Great films aren't necessarily iconic -- but an iconic film is, by definition, great. *****<br /><br />"Brokeback Mountain" has also entered pop culture, perhaps indelibly, even among people who haven't seen the film. When a female reporter used "Brokeback" references in a piece about Vladimir Putin's bare-chested fishing expedition, few there were who didn't get the joke. And "I wish I knew how to quit you" is likely to become a lasting catch phrase, just as "Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn" and "I'm shocked... shocked!" have.<br /><br />So why did "Brokeback Mountain" lose Best Picture? If Tony Curtis and Ernest Borgnine hadn't opened their stupid traps, the answer might have remained equivocal. But it seems that "Crash" -- a film with mixed reviews that appeared on few best-picture lists -- was nominated to provide an alternative for those who had personal (rather than artistic) reasons for rejecting "Brokeback Mountain".<br /><br />Tony Curtis (nee, Bernard Schwartz) -- who has unapologetically admitted to having sex with men (see the Wikipedia bio) -- should have _some_ feeling for what it means to belong to a discriminated-against minority. Both he and Mr. Borgnine have worked with gay men and women (on both sides of the camera), and ought to have the common sense to realize that attacking "Brokeback Mountain" -- on other than artistic grounds -- was a slap in the face to their queer colleagues. ****** Despite Mr. Borgnine's averral that John Wayne would not have tolerated "Brokeback Mountain", I suspect "The Duke" -- assuming the film truly did offend him -- would simply have kept his mouth shut (at least in public).<br /><br />An anti-parallel could be drawn with the 1947 Best-Picture winner, "Gentleman's Agreement", an intelligent film about anti-Semitism, though hardly of the quality justifying a Best-Picture nomination, let alone a win. But Hollywood's demographic is strongly Jewish, so it's not surprising it was nominated and won, simply because it corresponded with the interests of that demographic. ******* Imagine the reaction if a gentile actor had said he'd no intention of seeing the film because of its subject matter!<br /><br />"Hollywood" had the opportunity to award "Best Picture" to a film that truly deserved the honor, if only because it disrupted the usual order of things, and did it so well. As a resepcted LA reviewer remarked the day following the ceremony, Hollywood had finally demonstrated (if any proof were needed) that the Academy Awards were meaningless.<br /><br />Is the Story Plausible?<br />-----------------------<br /><br />It's significant that no one -- not even the most rabidly anti-gay fundamentalists -- has raised any objection to "Brokeback Mountain"'s plausibility. Of course, fundamentalists /wouldn't/ object, as it would contradict their assertion that homosexual behavior is a consciously chosen perversion. The seeming naturalness of Ennis and Jack's attraction is arguably the most-disturbing thing about the story.<br /><br />Ennis and Jack's tale is completely plausible. People who think "real men" don't have sex with each other -- or God forbid -- kiss each other, or fall in love, don't know much about what goes on in the world. I've known queer men who would beat John Wayne in a butch-off and could cold-cock The Duke in a fair fight.<br /><br />An appreciation for the male physique -- which is only one step removed from sexual attraction -- is hardly uncommon among heterosexual males. (Heterosexual men engage in bodybuilding primarily to improve their looks, not their health.) I saw it in my 100%-hetero father's reaction to Douglas Fairbanks' (lack of) costume in "The Thief of Bagdhad". And highly sexed hetero males sometimes experiment with homosexual behavior. (I was publicly out in college, and two notoriously womanizing male acquaintances came on to me simply because they were curious.)<br /><br />Men are sometimes confused about their sexual orientation. I've met hetero men who told me they were afraid of waking up one morning and discovering they were queer. They likely had sexual feelings for other men they didn't understand or know how to handle.<br /><br />Ennis and Jack's mutual attraction is a normal thing, and doesn't need an explanation, any more than Rhett and Scarlett's does. And Scarlett's interest in Rhett is unabashedly sexual, but no one sees much wrong in that. ("He was a tall man and powerfully built. Scarlett thought she had never seen a man with such wide shoulders, so heavy with muscles, almost too heavy for gentility. ...his eyes were as bold and black as any pirate's appraising a galleon to be scuttled or a maiden to be ravished.") Which should be no surprise to anybody.<br /><br />Watching the film for a fifth or sixth time, on Blu-ray, I remain impressed with Michelle Williams's heartbreaking performance (particularly the short scene where Ennis cruelly dismisses their marriage, and she tells him what she's finally figured out), and the scene in which Jack's mother asks Ennis to come back. She wants to spend time with someone who truly loved her son -- which her appallingly nasty husband never did.<br /><br />Comments on the Music<br />---------------------<br /><br />I was surprised at "Brokeback Mountain" winning Best Score, as there is so _little_ score. Yet, it is the _lack_ of scoring that contributes so much to "Brokeback Mountain"'s dramatic punch -- it would be nowhere as good a film if it had a full score. It's probably the first film score to win an Oscar because of its non-existence.<br /><br />Bernard Herrmann famously said that the purpose of music is to establish an emotional connection between what's going on up on the screen and the audience -- the composer had to fill in what  the director could not or would not show. Herrmann was a master of film music because he focused on what was /not/ being said or shown. An outstanding example occurs in "The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit" during the flashback of Gregory Peck killing a German soldier. In just a few bars of music, Herrmann conveys everything Peck is thinking and feeling.<br /><br />But most composers score much less imaginatively than Herrmann, merely underlining what we're seeing or hearing, rather than enhancing or complementing it. Too often the music /tells/ the audience how to react to the scene. That creates a distancing effect, where the emotion is conveyed more by the music than by the acting.<br /><br />In "Brokeback Mountain", the music is almost all atmosphere. There are no Leitmotivs (other than the melancholic guitar theme, which sometimes arrives to represent Ennis and Jack's relationship), and the music rarely underlines either thoughts or events. Consider Ennis and Jack's reunion, their ecstatic embrace, and Alma's appalled reaction to seeing her husband kissing another man with more passion than he's ever shown /her/. Though this scene seemingly cries out for music, there is none! We get the direct emotions of the situation, uncolored and unfiltered.<br /><br />This was likely intentional. Annie Proulx says she's not a "sentimental" writer; I suspect Ennis and Jack's relationship (which, let's be honest, is -- even at that point in the story -- far more sexual than romantic) would seem more than a little silly if it were "enhanced" by music.<br /><br />On the rare occasions when the music does reflect the scene's affect, Santaolalla's scoring is spare, subtle, and unclich&eacute;d. This is a remarkable score that shows, in an era where 70% or more of most films' running time is scored, how less can be more.<br /><br />Comments on DVD Quality<br />-----------------------<br /><br />Projection quality in American theaters is generally mediocre or worse -- inadequate brightness, muddy/smeary/dirty prints, flat color, lack of overall sharpness, etc.<br /><br />DVDs and LVs tend to automatically "look better" than what we see in the theater, simply because removing the projection lens and screen improves sharpness/detail and increases contrast. Transfers from the negative (rather than an IP or projection print) effect further improvements in sharpness, detail, color accuracy, and saturation.<br /><br />But these improvements aren't always aesthetically desirable. The cinematographer normally lights the film knowing how what's front of the camera will "translate" to the final projection print. The biggest change is a loss of shadow detail, which can be used to advantage (eg, the substitution of a piece of cardboard for Robby's left leg in the final scene of "Forbidden Planet"). When the DVD transfer restores the "lost" detail, we see things we weren't supposed to.<br /><br />For "Brokeback Mountain", these improvements work against the film. The generally dark, dingy quality of many scenes, that so fits the film's tone, is lightened, or lost altogether. Colors are now sometimes too bright and saturated, particularly in scenes where they shouldn't be. There's far too much shadow detail -- Aguirre's trailer office now looks relatively clean and neat, and Jack's family home not quite so dirty or run-down.<br /><br />Though there's now a "deluxe" multi-DVD edition, its transfer appears to be no different from the original single disk's. I hope someday the director and cinematographer - working from the negative -- will time each scene for the appropriate density, shadow detail, color saturation, etc. We need to see "Brokeback Mountain" as it was (probably) intended. The current DVD does not, as far as I can determine, present it properly.<br /><br />That's the DVD, of course. See the following remarks on the Blu-ray.<br /><br />Comments on Blu-ray Quality<br />---------------------------<br /><br />I've remarked in other reviews that the /only/ way to see a movie is /at home/, from an HD source on a big display (50" or larger). This couldn't be more true of "Brokeback Mountain".<br /><br />I saw the film twice theatrically, at different theaters. Particularly with the indoor scenes, the projection print was a muddy mess, though I felt at the time it was appropriate to the film's atmosphere. The DVD struck me (and a few other people) as overly clean-looking.<br /><br />The Blu-ray changes all that. We are now seeing (in effect) the camera negative, in high resolution. The most-significant improvement is not in sharpness and detail (though there are huge gains), but in tonality. The BD images truly capture what it's like to stand outside on an overcast day, or the feeling one has in someone's living room or kitchen. Annie Proulx says she writes stories about peoples' relationships with their environments (both physical and social), and the Blu-ray transfer captures Ennis and Jack's environments very well.<br /><br />Though dramas do not generally benefit much from high definition, this one is an exception.<br /><br />* Clark almost always represents relationships with women as encumbrances, or just plain unnecessary.<br /><br />** Though Gus and Woodrow are portrayed as close friends of many years' standing, their personalities -- the ever-randy, ever-whoring Gus, and the emotionally constipated ur-loner Woodrow -- seem consciously calculated to block the remotest possibility of anything sexual between them, even something as unthreatening to the sense of one's masculinity as "a chaw fer a chaw". After reading "Dead Man's Walk" and "Comanche Moon", you conclude that two such utterly different people couldn't possibly have been the lifelong friends they're portrayed as in "Lonesome Dove".<br /><br />*** While we're at it, let's throw in "The Epic of Gilgmamesh". The Gilgmamesh / Enkidu relationship is intensely homoerotic and vehemently misogynistic. Their society did not proscribe sexual relations between men; the Mitchell realization gives alternate versions that indicate they engaged in mutual sodomy.<br /><br />**** Richard Amory's classic "Loon" novels, though well-written, don't count. Though giving the illusion of reality -- Amory appears to have known far more about the realities of living in the wild than J. F. Cooper ever did -- they're fantasies set in an all-male world.<br /><br />***** An iconic short story became an iconic film. The current consensus is that "Brokeback Mountain" is not only the best short story "The New Yorker" has yet published, but one of the greatest American short stories, period. Without intending to, Annie Proulx hit the nail on the head. It's the work she will most-likely be remembered for.<br /><br />****** In "If Chins Could Kill", Bruce Campbell offers high praise for Ernest Borgnine's professionalism. But his professionalism apparently doesn't extend to having the sense not to defecate in your own nest.<br /><br />******* The 1947 Academy Award nominations were filled with ironies. "Crossfire" was also about anti-Semitism -- a soldier is murdered simply because he's Jewish -- but the film is based on the novel "The Brick Foxhole", in which the victim is homosexual. And the author of "Gentleman's Agreement", Laura Z. Hobson, would later pen "Consenting Adult", a novel about her gay son's coming out.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EUSH8DPW75LR.html">A3EUSH8DPW75LR</a><br/><p>Some of the reviews here are so sad.  We live in such a troubled time where the most important thing should be for all people to be accepted totally - whatever their sex, race, age, color or sexual identity.  The hate reviews here really do trouble me for the hate really isn't for the people they are attacking but comes from within the people themselves.  The only people capable of such hate are those who have it within themselves and must look at themselves first.<br /><br />That aside, let me review the brilliant masterpiece that is BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN.  The film is beautiful in every way.  Spellbinding cinematography, amazing script and actors giving some of the best performances of their career.  This film for all its grandeur is a simplistic, realistic love story for the ages.  Some have called it the gay GONE WITH THE WIND.  The most important thing here is that none of the characters are stereotypes.  Yes, the relationship is between two men but that is not the purpose of the film.  It is not a gay message film.  It is a love message film.  When two people connect in that special way that enables them to share their hearts, souls and celebrate it through the beauty of sexual expression it is a gift for any two people be they man/woman, woman/woman or man/man.  When this unique transcending true love is actualized it can happen between any two people.  A man who lives his life straight may find it with one other special man.  He may not be what we define as gay.  His love is for this man.  With this man gone he may desire no other man.  True love is such a gift and should never be denied.  And shame on anyone who tries to deny others from having it.<br /><br />Here we see that kind of love happen for Ennis and Jack.  The intimacy they feel takes the two of them by surprise and they develop a bond that only comes with true love.  The film shows us how they both deal with this love and how it affects their lives and other interpersonal relationships.  Heath Ledger and Jeke Gyllenhaal are spellbinding here and attack their characterizations with true honesty no holds barred.  The other stand out is Michelle Williams in a ground breaking, career making performance as Ennis's wife.  Her journey could have been so stereotypical but in her hands it is a splendind self realized exploration a woman must endure.<br /><br />The story here is romantic, tragic, happy sad and a timeless tale.  The blu ray version is astounding.  This film was made for it and it will seem like viewing the picture for the first time.  The 1080p high def picture is astounding.  The scenery pops with immense clarity, colors are crisp and close ups have perfect flesh tones.  The dialogue comes out strong and the beautiful music soars through the speakers as this beautiful tale is told.<br /><br />This film should definitely have won best picture but the fact that it got so many nominations is enough I guess.  I pray for the day when we as a society celebrate love pure and simple with no other issues mattering.  Highly recommend this amazing film.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>`Brokeback Mountain' will stand the tests of time, for that I'm certain.  Many would argue that it's only because of it's taboo subject matter or controversy but in the end, after the dust has settled and the smoke has cleared `Brokeback Mountain' is more than just a superlative talking point, it's a monumental powerhouse of a motion picture, from it's brilliant script to it's earth shattering acting to it's award winning directing.  At it's very core `Brokeback Mountain' is a story about life as we see it, live it and need it and it reaches to the heartstrings of much more than would be expected.  This is far deeper than `gay cinema' as some have labeled it but is modern cinema at its finest and teaches valid and life changing points that everyone can learn from despite their orientation and or morality.<br /><br />The film, based of Annie Proulx's short story, centers around the lives of two sheepherders Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist.  The two meet when they are but eighteen, Ennis engaged to his sweetheart Alma and Jack just trying to find himself.  They spend the summer together on Brokeback Mountain, herding sheep and albeit unintentionally falling in love.  The film setting begins in the early sixties and advancing twenty-some-odd-years before its conclusion and throughout the notion of repressed sexual feelings it made apparent. It's not culturally acceptable for these two men to even entertain the idea of loving and or being together, and so after their summer-long affair they go their separate ways, Ennis to marry Alma and Jack to eventually find and fall for Lureen.  Years later, after the births of their children, the memory of their affair still plagues them, not in regret of action but in regret of leaving it alone for so long and so they start up again, rekindling a flame that could only end in tragedy.<br /><br />The film is less a `gay love story' and more a universal cry for love in the most complex of terms.  This film proves that you can't pick the one you love but that the thoughts and feelings of those around us, whether it be close family, friends or the idea of a culture in whole can and will affect our decisions to whom and how to love.  While I feel that Jack Twist's character is and was a homosexual man I feel that Ennis was more or less a man you found love in a place he least expected it.  He never sought after the attention of other men as Jack did.  In fact even after Alma leaves him he still seeks the affection of a woman, but Jack and Jack alone had stolen his heart.  That's what's so moving and inspiring about this film is that it parades the truth that love is love and one must embrace that love of lose all happiness they could ever know.<br /><br />What helps elevate this film so far above the competition is the brilliant acting on the entire cast, a cast of young talented stars who blew up in such a big way by taking on such a mature film.  Looking at the roster one may not believe they could handle the material but everyone involved is stellar.  Ledger plays Ennis with such restraint and precise confusion that one is brought to tears almost as much for Ledgers star turn as he is for the tragedy wrapped within his character.  Ledger creates a performance that stays with you.  Gyllenhaal also manages to brilliantly create a character we can relate to.  Jack Twist is someone we know and maybe even a little bit of each of us, a man who just wants to live his life and doesn't care what the consequences.  Death to him is a fair enough price to pay for freedom.  Michelle Williams is a revelation as Alma, her pain, her subtle emotion, her breakdown and her silently unraveling sanity is as moving as it is astonishing to watch.  Anne Hathaway, while not receiving the critical attention of her co-stars delivers a brilliant performance and deserves to be recognized.  Her performance as Lureen may not have been as baity as the character given to Williams, but she maneuvers her character through her scenes with a maturity that she is recently blossoming into.<br /><br />Visually stunning and emotionally captivating `Brokeback Mountain' is a movie that demands to be seen and taken seriously and is one that will stay with the viewer for years even decades to come.  We feel the pain in Ennis' gut as he falls to his knees in despair over leaving Jack.  We feel the torment in Alma's eyes as she watches the man she loves embrace another man.  We feel the frustration in Jack's demeanor as he pleads for Ennis to stay with him, give him anything more than an annual escapade.  But most of all we feel our own heart breaking and setting as we realize how this film and it's very essence effect us in ways we'd never imagine.  Gay, straight, male or female we have all met our Ennis or Jack and maybe even let him or her go because of outside influence or confusion of heart.  May this tragic tale of love denied and love lost move us to never let that happen to us again.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>It is wonderful to see Ang Lee come back with `Brokeback Mountain,' beautifully-shot, heart-rending drama about two cowboys and their forbidden love. Some of you might find the film's theme not so attractive at first, but don't worry, the film can be appreciated as a love story, and a very good and nuanced one too.<br /><br />The quiet opening section is the strongest part, where Ennis (Heath Ledger) and Jack (Jake Gyllenhaal) are hired to guard the sheep in the mountains in the early 1960s. The sparse use of dialogues and soundtrack enhance the emotional tension between them, with a help from the stunning photography of Rodrigo Prieto, who captures the serene beauty of Brokeback Mountain,<br /><br />Then we meet Ennis and Jack four years later, both married and with children. While Jack considers the possibility of living together, Ennis, who recounts a horrible episode from his childhood memories, evades the topic altogether, suggesting his repressed fear about the consequences of such a life. However, as time goes by - and the film covers about 20 years of their life -- their hidden (so they believe) relations inevitably influence those around them, especially the life of Alma (Michelle Williams), Ennis's wife.<br /><br />First and foremost, `Brokeback Mountain' is a success as the poignant love story between Ennis and Jack. Jake Gyllenhaal is good as Jack, clearly more seductive of the two, but it is Heath Ledger who embodies the sadness of these two lovers. Ennis is a good example of a lonely soul, who knows nothing about his own life except that he messed it up somewhere in the past.<br /><br />Female roles are less impressive though Michelle Williams shines as tormented wife of Ennis. Ann Hathaway plays Laureen, Jack's wife, but talented as she is, I think the NYC-born actress is miscast as Texas girl. (And there are brief nudity of them, which is totally unnecessary here.) Anna Faris, Linda Cardellini, and Kate Mara also appear, but with the exception of Kate Mara, who plays the daughter of Ennis and seeks for the love of her father, the good cast is largely wasted.<br /><br />`Brokeback Mountain' is not without flaws. Perhaps it could have been better with more time to tell the story, but the emotional power of the central theme is strong all the same, and the end results of their story are simply overwhelming.</p></br><a href="../users/A4F8CJ1L4348V.html">A4F8CJ1L4348V</a><br/><p>Now it is my turn to chime in. I orginally saw this movie in the theaters with my partner. The movie theater was packed with all people both straight and gay. There was not an eye that dry when the movie was over. I liked this movie for what it is and what it stands for. It is a story about about two men that find each other in the early 60s and fall in love. If everyone remembers what the early 60s were like for people of color, and everyone that  was a different faith than Christian. This was not a time of safety for anyone that was different from the white Christian hetrosexual family. With that being said, Jack and Enis did what they had to at the time the movie took place for the safety of themselves and their families. I find it very interesting what people are saying about this movie and why they don't like it. All that they are talking about is how these two men in love cheated on their wives. I ask myself, can these reviewers see the trees through the forest? Or better yet, can they see past their own noses (the reviewers) and walk in these men's shoes in that era being who they were? No, they would not have the strength to be who they were in those times. I am a person that came out in the 80s, into a society that was not accepting of me or my partner. I can only imagine what it was like in the 60s where everyone was hated for being different than a white hetrosexual Christian male. I recommend this movie to anyone that wants to see pure strength and a fearlessness for who they love.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R90OGE1EACZE.html">A3R90OGE1EACZE</a><br/><p>I Loved Brokeback Mountain.<br /><br />Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal did a phenomenal job as Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist two cowboys who fall in love in the summer of 1963. I also thought that Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway did great jobs playing their wives-the only thing I have to say is that Anne Hathaway's hair looked very strange toward the later part of the film.<br /><br />Lots of people might make fun of the movie, saying that it is immoral to portray two men in love, but it is a sweet simple story and watching two hot guys making out in a movie is pretty interesting.</p></br><a href="../users/A2X6GEC6LCDN4S.html">A2X6GEC6LCDN4S</a><br/><p>This film is disturbing to watch but has POWERFUL lessons for us all.<br /><br />It was sad how much the two main characters had to hide the love they found.  I believe if some is gay deep inside they cannot pretend to be somebody else.  Pretending to be someone else is more harmful than helpful, and they end up suffering more.  Society is still scared to death of people who are "too different."  What a powerful lesson this film teaches.  Even Dora should understand that her so called Christian moralizing does not match up with the truth exuding from this award winning film.  Until human beings are able to understand people who are different rather than hurting them, we are still running in place.  We have a ways to go.<br /><br />It's all about tolerance the Golden Rule...treat others like you would like to be treated.  You should know this if you are a 5th grader or a senior citizen.  The ethic of reciprocity (or the Golden Rule) is a general moral principle found in virtually all religions and culture, often as a fundamental rule, a fact which suggests that it may be related to innate aspects of human nature (see altruism). It is most commonly rendered as "do unto others as you would have them do unto you", or in other words "treat others as you want to be treated".<br /><br />In most formulations it takes a passive form, as expressed by the Jewish sage Hillel: "What is hateful to you, do not to your fellow man."<br />In Western culture, however, the most famous formulation is active, as expressed in the Torah as "love your neighbor as yourself" (Leviticus 19:18).<br />This traditional guiding rule was (and is) so highly valued that it has for centuries been known in English as the "Golden Rule".<br /><br />Congrats on those who had the guts and integrity to make this picture.  I hope it starts and long and healthy dialogue about tolerance and love.  This country needs good political dialogues so desperately.  We need more respect for each others' humanity.</p></br><a href="../users/AY6A8KPYCE6B0.html">AY6A8KPYCE6B0</a><br/><p>This movie really is as huge as the hype has made it out to be. First it's really the first gay love story (if you want to call it a love story) to go mainstream, second it's got two pulitzer prize winners and Ang Lee involved, third it's got the best acting I have ever seen on film, and when you mix everything together you get the most professional adaptation of a written work I wouldn't want to say ever done, but it certainly might be.<br /><br />You probably know the story by now, so I won't go on with plot summeries, but I will tell you what made me attend this film 4 times at the theater:<br /><br />As an English major this movie was like literary heaven. After the first time I watched it I was blown away by all the foreshadow, symbolism, parallels, and poetric transitions that this film did perfectly. For instance, Jack always misses what he "shoots" (coyote, deer) but Ennis hits them. In a sense Ennis has "hit" Jack, but Jack can never really "hit" Ennis.<br /><br />At the end of one scene Alma throws down mail and the camera captures an ad for Honey. In the next seen Jack says "Honey" to his wife. What a great Poetic transition!<br /><br />There are many parallels, most notably that embrace from behind. Jack and Ennis do it twice, once while in the motel and another during the flashback when Jack is "sleeping like a horse." Alma also embraces Ennis from behind in the first bedroom scene when she wants to move into town. Even the their two shirts together in the end can be considered an embrace from behind.<br /><br />Jack foreshadows his outcome by wearing purple in one scene.<br /><br />I could go on and on and on with all the fun English and Literary goodies I found by watching the movie--trust me, I took pen and paper into the theater and filled up 5 front-and-back pages of notes. But I think I can summerize how I feel about this film by simply saying it is outstanding, and will always be considered Best Picture no matter what the Oscars have to say.</p></br><a href="../users/AK0CENM3LUM28.html">AK0CENM3LUM28</a><br/><p>Brokeback Mountain / B00005JOFQ<br /><br />*Spoilers*<br /><br />Somehow I missed watching Brokeback Mountain when it was first released and it's been on my "Things to Watch" list forever, and now I'm probably the last person on earth to watch it. Just about anything I can say about this wonderful movie seems woefully superfluous at this point, and yet it seems fair to point out that I'm yet another person taken in by this tragic and touching movie.<br /><br />I'm not usually a big fan of romances and tear-jerkers, largely because my tears are so easily jerked that I'm one of those people who cry during previews (especially the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013FSL3E">Wall-E</a> preview, *sniffle*), and I can't say that I'm ever likely to return to Brokeback Mountain a second time, but that's not because I didn't enjoy the movie (far from it) but rather because this movie is memorable at a level comparable to searing itself onto one's brain matter. The writing is simply superb, the acting is quite possibly the best I've ever seen, and the plot is both simple and straightforward (forbidden love) while still being incredibly complicated and thought-provoking.<br /><br />It's hard to say what I liked most about this movie. I appreciated that Ledger's character wasn't given an 'easy out' in terms of his almost emotionally abusive behavior towards Gyllenhaal's character. Yes, the movie acknowledges powerfully that Ennis' behavior is driven by a guilt and fear that was instilled in him powerfully at a young age, but though Ennis is a victim, the movie does not insist that we hand him complete forgiveness for his treatment of Jack. Ennis is holding on to Jack because he loves him, and we pity him for being unable to embrace him fully, yet he seems blissfully, willfully blind to Jack's own pain at their near-constant separation, and Ennis is at fault for not making more time for his lover, or at least make his feelings plain and clear enough to ease some of Jack's pain and doubt.<br /><br />I also greatly appreciated the tenderness with which the movie approaches Ennis' wife and her feelings towards her husband's affair. It would have been tempting to cast her as all saint (understanding her husband's needs and accepting it without any feeling on her part) or as a convenient villain (thus making it morally 'acceptable' for Ennis to behave as he does), yet she is neither and the movie is better for it. As a human being, she struggles with her hurt over Ennis' adultery balanced against his steadfastness as a provider and father, if not as a loving husband. Even when her anger boils over, she never loses sight of the fact that she loves Ennis (as the father of her children, if nothing else), and she does not spread the rumors that he fears might literally end his life.<br /><br />I felt that the ambiguity over Jack's death was a careful touch. We are unsure whether the story of Jack's death was merely a cover for the murder Ennis imagines, and whether or not it is a figment of his imagination colors his acceptance of the matter. Was Jack's death a tragic event that he could have prevented by running off with him? Or would running off with him merely have put them both in further danger? It's impossible to say, and it's easy to imagine Ennis tormenting himself with this question for the rest of his life.<br /><br />Like pretty much everyone else on earth, it seems, I deeply recommend Brokeback Mountain for a tragic and touching tale of love and loss.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll</p></br><a href="../users/A4PPZNQF1X2IY.html">A4PPZNQF1X2IY</a><br/><p>Great scenery, great story, great screenplay.  Heath Ledger was outstanding.<br />One of the top movies for 2005 easily.  Good job Ang Lee.  So much is told thru<br />the slightest of hints, not a wasted scene.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ALOIPRR8Q06J.html">A1ALOIPRR8Q06J</a><br/><p>A couple years ago I was staying with family that has digital cable. Let me digress: Ever read _Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business_by Neil Postman? It's worth checking out. Anyway, I was hanging around the house a lot and this movie was playing on the HBO channels. At first I wasn't too interested to be honest. You know, seemed it might be a liberal Hollywood "message movie" and the subject matter didn't particularly appeal to me. I mean romance movies aren't my thing anyway and one about two dudes is just not my cup of tea. And there was so much buzz around it cause it's the "gay cowboy movie" and people are retarded and trip, in large part because of the very entertainment industry TV shows and magazines that are mainly responsible for generating the publicity for Hollywood products. But I started catching parts of it when I was hanging out channel surfing and ended up seeing the whole thing. ANYWAY, this is a very good movie, plain and simple. I was moved by it alright? I mean it got to me. And I made a point to tell friends. It bothered me that I felt even slightly funny about telling people I know that I liked the movie. I called BS on myself.<br /><br />The motivation for writing this here Amazon "review" for BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN is Heath Ledger's performance.<br /><br />Seeing Ledger in this role it was perfectly clear to me at the time that Ledger was going to be one of his generation's finest actors. I've heard from fanboys a million times over how awesome Ledger's performance as The Joker is and it really is an amazing performance and I completely agree. However, long before ever seeing THE DARK KNIGHT I knew Heath Ledger was going to be a superstar. I knew well before ever even seeing a clip of him as The Joker he was going to be great as The Joker solely based on his performance in this film and that THE DARK KNIGHT would make him a star.<br /><br />I'd also add that BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN is a much better pictire than CRASH which won for "Best Picture" that year. Ang Lee is a truly great drama film director. ICE STORM and RIDE WITH THE DEVIL are also great and unique films. The tribute below is touching and I think perfectly articulates what so many have thought and felt..<br />___________________________________________________________________<br />"Ledger's magnificent performance is an acting miracle. He seems to tear it from his insides. Ledger doesn't just know how Ennis moves, speaks and listens; he knows how he breathes. To see him inhale the scent of a shirt hanging in Jack's closet is to take measure of the pain of love lost.<br /><br />Rare is the performance that can honestly be called a "revelation," but that's what it felt like to watch Heath Ledger in "Brokeback Mountain." Not only did he bring iconic life and nuance to the existential loneliness of Ennis Del Mar, a taciturn but complex (and conflicted) character, but for such mature work to spring from the teen-idol star of "10 Things I Hate About You" and "A Knight's Tale" was... well, revelatory itself -- the astonishing revelation of a suddenly, fully developed actor whose juvenile efforts scarcely hinted he'd be capable of such moving depth and clarity. Ledger emerged as if from a cocoon, gleaming with promise and flexing his wings.<br /><br />Only two years after he received his first Oscar nomination for this iconic, star-making performance, it seems unthinkable that we should be mourning his death, at the age of 28...."<br /><br />-- outstanding film critic Jim Emerson.<br /><br />Couldn't say it better.</p></br><a href="../users/A1I7QGUDP043DG.html">A1I7QGUDP043DG</a><br/><p>This film about forbidden love during a time when coming out of the closet could get you killed is truly heartbreaking.  The screenplay stayed true to the short story and the actors took on their roles with maturity and dedication.

Directed by Ang Lee and adapted from Annie Proulx's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0007205589">Brokeback Mountain</a>. Three Academy awards, three Golden Globes and Golden Lion of the 2005 Venice Film Festival. True love between two modern cowboys over a period of 20 years. Souvenirs, time, guilt and risk sublimate this relationship. Deserves all the praise it created. Masterpiece.</p></br><a href="../users/A34D06JL7LC6MU.html">A34D06JL7LC6MU</a><br/><p>This movie was the "IT" movie of 2005. It was the most talked about, most joked about, it scored the most Oscar nominations.<br /><br />It won 3 Academy Awards including Best Picture for director Ang Lee and was the subject of the big Oscar upset when 'Crash' won Best Picture. Personally, I think 'Crash' was a better movie. But despite it's labels ("the gay cowboy movie") and the jokes made on it's behalf (Brownback Mountain, etc.) this movie proves to be one of the best films of 2005 and a deeply sad movie about unexpected love. I'm straight, so I was worried when I saw this movie just how affected I would be by the love story of two men...I was surprised. Oscar nominee Heath Ledger (Best Actor, Brokeback Mountain) stars as Ennis Del Mar, a tightlipped cowboy searching for work. Ennis ends up at a trailer where he meets Jack Twist (Oscar nominee Jake Gyllenhaal). The two are hired (by Randy Quaid) to herd sheep on Brokeback Mountain. After a while on the mountain the two hit it off and one cold night they end up having sex. The scene is somewhat graphic, but not sickening. Both Ennis and Jack are surprised by the sudden act, neither one of them are aware that they're gay. That's expressed in a fantastic scene as the two stand on a mountain and Ennis says "You know, I ain't no queer".<br /><br />"Me neither" Jack replies. Anyway, when the job ends; both men go their separate ways. Ennis marries a woman named Alma (Oscar nominee Michelle Williams) and has two daughters. Jack moves to Texas and marries Lureen (Anne Hathaway, obviously trying to shed her "Princess Diaries" image) and has a son. Four years pass, when Ennis recieves a postcard from Jack. The two meet up and the passion is rekindled immediately. For the next 20 years the two continue their relationship, with Jack insisting that the two can live together somewhere on their own ranch. The tighlipped Ennis however realizes that can never be so...<br /><br />Also, Jack is the only one who seems to really accept that he's gay...Picking up a male prostitute in Mexico and forging a relationship with a man in Texas. Now, this story isn't really just about two gay cowboys. It's about forbidden love and I'm going to paraphrase Roger Ebert's review here; but it could have just as easily been about a muslim man and jewish woman or<br /><br />a black man and a white woman. It shows that love can happen at anytime even with someone you least expect. It's deep stuff.<br /><br />Ledger finally gets to step out into the limelight and Gyllenhaal shows off some more acting chops (which he's done before in movies like "The Good Girl"). I haven't seen Michelle Williams outside of anything other than "Dawson's Creek" and it's amazing to me that she could strike up the kind of emotions she does as Alma, the wife who knows of her husbands relationship but is to nervous (and scared) to bring it up with him. Hathaway was underrated in her role as Lureen, Jack's wife and shows that she could begin to be taken seriously in the years to come. This is a marvelous film, that I highly recommend.<br /><br />GRADE: A-</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>This was the first movie I have watched that is a genuine love story between 2 men.  There was only 1 sex scene and a few kissing scenes.  So anyone who might be turned off by reports of this being all about 2 men making out can give this movie a try.  The story, set in 1963 Wyoming is more a character study about 2 men who fall in love with each other.  Ennis and Jack share something special, but they can never reveal it to the world or even let on.  This is 1963 and the heart of middle America, and you don't dare come out of the closet.  The two men spend the next 20 years trying to spend some time together out in the seclusion of the mountains, while trying to maintain the appearance of normal heterosexual lives with wives and children.  It is a very good look at forbidden love.  Well acted all the way around, with an interesting story.  2 parts kept this from being 5 stars from me.  The first is the sexual encounter between the men.  To me it just happened all of a sudden.  I would have enjoyed more of a buildup.  The second is Jack's parents, who hinted at knowing that he was gay.  I would have liked to seen more of his relationship with them, or given a more clear understanding of what they knew.  Other than that, this was well crafted and worth a watch.</p></br><a href="../users/A1RJXK6KF3LL5R.html">A1RJXK6KF3LL5R</a><br/><p>I loved it.It was great.A movie showing how strong love can be and how it can last forever.A must see.</p></br><a href="../users/A3B87UZLPCF0HW.html">A3B87UZLPCF0HW</a><br/><p>Too many people focused on the supposed homosexual content. To my dismay I could not figure out what all the big fuss was about. I emphasised with these characters as I or anyone who has ever been in a relationship could feel their pain. Jack (Jake Gyllenhaal) is the one who wants to throw it all out there and go for it, he's not afraid to say 'I Love You'. Ennis (Heath Ledger) is reserved and can't allow his head to follow his heart. That sounds awfully like traits that heterosexual people have too. Ang Lee does an absolutely fantastic job with his character's development and the astounding scenery in which this all happens. The bond that both of our lead characters have is truly beautiful and pure. 1963, mid America, work is scarce and two farmhands are hired to tend to sheep on a remote mountain. I believe everybody who hasn't seen the film know the rest. The character driven story is held by a tremendous young cast of actors. Gyllenhaal puts himself up there to become a great leading man in Hollywood, Anne Hathaway has become the new Reese Witherspoon and in time assuming she stays on track will become a leading force. Michelle Williams has left James Van Der Beek crying into his Pillow back in Dawson's Creek as she has now come into her own. Finally Heath Ledger, by far one of the most powerful performances he has ever produced. A complex, engrossing portrayal, Ennis presents himself as a more conventional male stereotype than Jack, so the tension between his masculinity and his sexuality is all the more demanding. A career best from nearly the whole cast.</p></br><a href="../users/A20JYIHL1W1U54.html">A20JYIHL1W1U54</a><br/><p>Rather captivating in its own right this film is thought provoking.

This film stays with you, you can't help but think about it, it is that powerful. Heath Ledger is so good in this film that i almost forgot this is the same actor who made his acting debut in 10 things i hate about you. Jake Gylenhaal is wonderful as well, i loved him in the good girl and october sky. Their love for each other is so real and passionate, that i believed in this story from the getgo. Two actors pretending to be in love, they sure pulled it off effortlessly. Ang Lee's direction is so beautiful with the sheeps, it looks like a cloud floating in one swing. Gorgeous, intense, and courageous acting is what you will get when you engross yourself in this oscar-nominated film. I think it should have won best picture but some of the best films of all time never win. Rent this, buy it, it will leave a profound effect on you, highly recommend it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ULSA0IRUE09E.html">A2ULSA0IRUE09E</a><br/><p>Wow. This is a film about two people who honestly do love each other. Does such love still exist in the world? Ennis and Jack's story proves that you don't need to be married to the person you love, and you don't even have to see them everyday to still be in love with them. Their story elevates love to a whole new level, and the sexual aspect of it becomes secondary.<br /><br />This is the sort of pure and divine love story that I wish Schools would show their kids to teach them about real life. The world would be a much better place if kids watched things like this growing up - they would certainly be more grounded individuals and more true to their hearts. Its about time we all woke up and recognized this film for the pure slice of heaven it is.</p></br><a href="../users/A38U2M9OAEJAXJ.html">A38U2M9OAEJAXJ</a><br/><p>It's been the butt of many jokes, often told by people who have never seen the movie.  But the truth is, "Brokeback Mountain" is an emotionally charged love story directed with maturity, elegance, and grace by Ang Lee.  Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal play two men (Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist) who get a gig as shepherds at (where else?) Brokeback Mountain (based in Wyoming but filmed in Alberta).  Their working relationship morphs into a friendship, which takes an intimate turn when Ennis and Jack have a tryst on one cold night.  They swear it's a one-time thing, but in reality, they try to carry on a twenty-year affair unbeknownst to the wives they eventually marry (Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway).  The beauty of "Brokeback" is that it doesn't take sides or cast judgement.  Ang Lee lets you feel each of the character's pain, frustration and anxiety.  We sympathize with Jack's longing, and we witness Ennis struggling to balance both a family and the man he so desires.  We also ache with Ennis' wife Alma (Williams), who can't even begin to grasp the words to describe what she sees when she catches her husband kissing another man from her window.  For her, it seems, homosexuality is completely outside her realm of understanding.  But "Brokeback" wouldn't stand tall without its performances, which are collectively outstanding.  What's also remarkable is how the screenwriters took the 40-odd-page short story (written by Annie Proux) and stretched it to a movie that runs for over two hours.  Rush-released shortly after the Oscars, this DVD somewhat skimps on the extras (no director's commentary, for instance).  Still, "Brokeback Mountain" is a beautifully told movie than lingers in your head long after the final credits roll.</p></br><a href="../users/A20TJ5P97W5MS1.html">A20TJ5P97W5MS1</a><br/><p>What does it take to make a person think differently? Brokeback Mountain is everything you would expect it to be and honestly much more. It is a meditative, thoughtful, well paced & shot, romance. There is a slight chance you may have never watched a love story of this nature before. The two main characters are Ennis Del Mar played by Heath Ledger and Jack Twist played by Jake Gyllenhaal. While these two are on assignment herding sheep in the mountains of Wyoming they discover a similar interest: each other. Brokeback Mountain is a real testament to the fact love can definitely be found in the very unlikeliest of places and between the unlikeliest of people. Love in the traditional sense is not always what we think it is. Overall Brokeback Mountain is a very daring and stereotype destroying outing for all parties involved. Some people may not be interested and others may not be ready. Whether it's your thing or not Brokeback Mountain is a meaningful and enduring film.</p></br><a href="../users/A37PV5GMP2ILJC.html">A37PV5GMP2ILJC</a><br/><p>A story of bi-$exual love<br /><br />'tween Ennis and Jack Twist<br /><br />Two youngsters hired to tend sheep<br /><br />Up in the mountain mist<br /><br />One cold night they share a tent<br /><br />Much smaller than a dorm<br /><br />When suddenly they find a way<br /><br />To keep each other warm<br /><br />All too soon the summer's done<br /><br />As all good things must end<br /><br />For four long years they live apart<br /><br />Each thinking of his friend<br /><br />A postcard dropped into the mail<br /><br />The romance is re-started<br /><br />They realize their passion lives<br /><br />Despite the years they'd parted<br /><br />Jack proposes a small ranch<br /><br />But Ennis keeps him wishing<br /><br />He will not leave his family<br /><br />So they keep "going fishing"<br /><br />Tortured heroes, shattered dreams<br /><br />The emotion's like a fountain<br /><br />This story covers twenty years<br /><br />Of love on Brokeback Mountain<br /><br />Amanda Richards, March 28, 2006</p></br><a href="../users/A19OQ7LWE2YJL3.html">A19OQ7LWE2YJL3</a><br/><p>Forget that they are gay, it doesn't matter.

Jake Gyllenhaal brilliantly underplays his role. Unfortunately Heath Ledger seems to have received all the kudos for this film and Gyllenhaal efforts have gone summarily unnoticed. For some reason Ennis Del Mar, Heath Ledger's character gets all the histrionic kudus.  Gyllenhaal needed something more from the Ennis character to really bring out Jack Twist's heartbreak. Unfortunately, Heath Ledger curiously did not make this openly apparent in his performance and I found Ledger's character a rather frustrating person to discern. Jake Gyllenhaal as Jack Twist was just waiting. He was left out in the cold. This is true in so many of life's experiences yet still unforgivable. The indelible image of the forlorn looking Gyllenhaal is indelibly etched into one's memory.</p></br><a href="../users/A1O60Q7LBN4MQ.html">A1O60Q7LBN4MQ</a><br/><p>I thought Heath Ledger was excellent and was definitely his movie. I thought it was sad that at that time and place that two people who love each other can't be together without people making it their business, which Ledger's character Ennis Del Mar was worried about. Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) was the outgoing of the two. He didn't care, he was willing to take the chance. They both ended up getting married, Ennis was divorced later. His wife found out their secret early.<br /><br />It's kind of a sad story and I felt for both of them but it was Ennis who my heart went out to. It's a worthwhile movie to see if you are open minded and willing to set through a fairly long movie that tells it's story slowly.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IUI3CJUMB7J0.html">A1IUI3CJUMB7J0</a><br/><p>I enjoyed this film from start to finish. The story is a drama so there is no action or nothing but that's good. It's a haunting love story that will get you hooked and will not let you go. The acting is excellent and every actor gives oscar worthy performances the acting is the best I ahve seen in a long time. The score is great for the filma nd the scienry is great especially for some on who ahs seen where they film (in jasper/banff albert). Overall I would dnot say it's the best film of 2005 but it's up there as being one of the best films of the year.</p></br><a href="../users/A3JPFWKS83R49V.html">A3JPFWKS83R49V</a><br/><p>"Brokeback Mountain" is a film based on a story of the same name, written by author E. Annie Proulx. This controversial film received quite a bit of talk when it was first released and it was the subject of many jokes by comedians of all types. The idea of two cowboy types who fall in love while working at a mountain ranch was just too irresistible to many and it made Brokeback Mountain the common [...] (no pun intended) of many jokes.<br /><br />Today, many months after its initial release, much of the hoopla has died down. Brokeback Mountain has now been released on DVD and this provided me my opportunity to watch this movie and see what the fuss was all about. I already knew the film received rave reviews and it was nominated for many Oscars, taking home three of them before the Academy Awards wrapped up the 2005 awards evening. But would Brokeback Mountain live up to the hype, I wondered, or would it be an idiotic mess of unrealistic events, stupid one- liners, and a case of "pushing" an issue (in this case, gay themes and rights) on the viewer?<br /><br />Now that I have watched this movie in its entirety, I am happy to report that Brokeback Mountain contains none of the negative qualities I described above. Director Ang Lee presents a movie that is tastefully made and that doesn't push any social agenda. Yes, the film does portray many adult scenes (like gay sex and straight sex), but it is done in as tasteful a way as possible. What takes place in this movie is probably not very far- fetched at all for the time period that it covers (1963 to 1981) and there are likely many viewers who will be able to relate directly to the plot of this movie and the confusion and frustration felt by its lead characters and their families as they struggle to sort out their feelings. Ennis and Jack have obvious feelings for each other but they feel they must keep their affair secret. They have families to support and they want to be seen as "normal" by those around them. Jack is more aggressive and he pushes Ennis to join him and start a permanent relationship. But Ennis resists and the strain it places on them and their respective families is significant and the emotional pain on the screen is openly visible.<br /><br />Ang Lee does a superb job directing this film and its no surprise that he won the Oscar for Best Director. The cinematography is excellent, with great scenes of the vast Rocky Mountains as they majestically pierce the bright blue skies above them. The direction he takes this film is nearly flawless as it follows the two main characters on their path from lustful attraction, to emotional involvement, to resistance and beyond. Intertwined are the problems experienced on the home front. Both men get married and start families, in spite of their obvious attraction to each other. Like many people during that era, they probably did this because it was assumed to be the right thing to do. But the difficulties it causes their two families are obvious, with Ennis' character experiencing the greatest domestic turmoil of the two. Not only does Ennis get divorced, he even allows himself to get involved in another relationship with a woman; this, in spite of the fact that he knows where his true interest and feelings lie.<br /><br />Heath Ledger plays Ennis Del Ray and his performance is near perfect. Ledger is only twenty- six years old but he plays the part of a man who is (at the end of the movie) in his forties. The make- up, the talk, and the attitude that Ledger projects into this character are very real and it's easy to see why he, too, was nominated for an Oscar. It took me a while to get used to Ennis' voice because he talks like someone with a hunk of chewing tobacco in his mouth. I had to replay some of the scenes to pick up on what he was saying. But the character was like this for a reason, most likely to make him similar to those who work in this type of occupation. Jake Gyllenhaal's character, Jack Twist, is very different from Ennis. He is more of a straight talker who says exactly what is on his mind and proceeds to work toward his goals. Gyllenhaal's performance isn't quite as good as Ledger's but it is still notable and still memorable.<br /><br />One thing I noticed about Brokeback Mountain is that it took me some time to warm- up to the main characters. They seemed so distant and casual about the whole thing at first that it was difficult to care what was going on. I found myself feeling more sympathetic toward the families who had to deal with the volatility of their respective fathers/husbands on a daily basis. However, as the film nears its end, the frustration felt by Jack and the stubbornness of Ennis got me more involved with the characters. I just wanted them to finally make up their minds one way or the other and it was much easier at this point to feel the frustration felt by Jack as he tried to persuade his friend that he wanted their relationship to be more than just a seasonal fling.<br /><br />Brokeback Mountain is a very good motion picture that will be remembered for years as one of 2005's best pictures. The cinematography, the performances, and the directing are all top- notch and the story of forbidden love is engaging and vivid. The film will likely remain controversial for its subject matter but regardless of your own personal feelings on this type of subject, "Brokeback Mountain" is a film I recommend watching. It presents a realistic look at what people who lived this life often experienced back when alternative lifestyles weren't as accepted as they are today.</p></br><a href="../users/A21XVS00AIENLX.html">A21XVS00AIENLX</a><br/><p>Ang Lee once again creates a masterpiece on screen with yet another angst-ridden drama.  This time the story is between two cowboys who spend time together sheep herding on Brokeback mountain in the summer of 1963 and continue their relationship for the next 20 years.  While the women in their lives suffer emotional neglect, the real angst in this movie is depicted in the moments when Jack and Ennis are spent apart.  It is said that absence makes the heart grow fonder, but Jack and Ennis feel its effects doubly so.<br /><br />The cinematography is absolutely stunning.  The soundtrack is quiet, simple and honest.  The actors are perfectly cast and well-depicted.  I was quite surprised by Anne Hathaway's performance.  She nails the Texas accent and the attitude of a wife whose marriage very quickly became a loveless convenience.  Additionally, our wholesome heroine from the Princess Diaries is no more after Hathaway's first topless scene with Jake Gyllenhall.  Seems like everyone is growing up in this film.<br /><br />Because the movie involves some very sensitve material that is not yet widely accepted by the public, I do caution to those who are uncomfortable with homosexuality that this film is not for you.  There are a few love scenes, short yet somewhat explicit, that might cause you to squirm in your seat or quite possibly gag.  Conversely, homosexuals would find this movie both sad and endearing.  You should add it to your DVD collection.<br /><br />This is a very good story, well filmed and by far Ang Lee's best work to date.  Meant only for the maturest and most open minds.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AYN3IIUNQCIA.html">A1AYN3IIUNQCIA</a><br/><p>i have to agree, Brokeback got robbed at the oscars. this is definently one of the biggest upsets like when Shakespear in Love won over the excpected Saving Private Ryan. why the film lost i can speculate is because of prejudice, theme, and all the late night jokes about it (have you seen comedy central when it came out?) i guess the academy wasent ready for a film adressing the gay theme to take home the most prestigous film award but we can look at the bright side, in a year or two we will forget about the Crash victory but Brokeback will only gain in popularity and it will become a classic like other robbed oscar films. the film has a sad tone in it and when it shows pictures of happiness its just heartbreaking. the film is about two ranchers, Ennis and Jack, who meet one summer tending sheep in the wilderness of Brokeback Mountain and by fate, fall in love. then as time goes buy they get married, have kids, but still always meet at the mountain to rekindle there love. all the performences are great, Gyllenhaal gives his best performence since the Good Girl while Hathaway comes far since her Princess diaries days. but the two standout performces are Ledger and Williams. Ledger perfectly brings a gruff, quiet Ennis to the screen with explosive results and Williams has blossomed into a pitch perfect actress potraying Ennis's tortured wife and proves she has come a long way since Dawson's creek. i have loved Ang Lee's films from Sense and Sensibilty to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon but this by far is his best film to date, i wont give away the ending but i will say the shirt...just makes you want to cry. some people may shy away from the film but its a great film so i definently recomend seeing it. it is truley the best film of the year.</p></br><a href="../users/A7Y6AVS576M03.html">A7Y6AVS576M03</a><br/><p>Jake Gyllenhaal as Jack Twist is brilliant and gives a very restrained and heartfelt performance. Jake Gyllenhaal brilliantly underplays his role. Unfortunately Heath Ledger seems to have received all the kudos for this film and Gyllenhaal efforts have gone summarily unnoticed. For some reason Ennis Del Mar, Heath Ledger's character gets all the histrionic kudus. Gyllenhaal needed something more from the Ennis character to really bring out Jack Twist's heartbreak. Unfortunately, Heath Ledger curiously did not make this openly apparent in his performance and I found Ledger's character a rather frustrating person to discern. Jake Gyllenhaal as Jack Twist was just waiting. He was left out in the cold. This is true in so many of life's experiences yet still unforgivable. The indelible image of the forlorn looking Gyllenhaal is indelibly etched into one's memory.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B3Z2QHW3V35S.html">A2B3Z2QHW3V35S</a><br/><p>I heard about this movie before buying it. I bought before seeing it. I am a straight married woman. But I love gay man. They are great friends and I don't see anything wrong with who they want to spend their life with. Because I feel so strong about gay man I knew I would like this movie before seeing it. I wasn't wrong, this is a great love story. Yes I said Love Story. It doesn't have to be about a man and a woman to make it a love story. This movie is about two man who worked together on Brokeback Mountain alone one year. One night they had sex together. One feels like he did wrong and the other is in love. After their job was done at Brokeback Mountain they both went on with their life. Getting married and having children. They both found each other again and every so months they got together to show their love for each other. I don't believe there was any more sex scenes but you can see how much they care for each other. SO NO THIS MOVIE IS NOT A GAY PORN MOVIE. Like someone wrote on here. This is a must see or have movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3JLOIXFM75QNV.html">A3JLOIXFM75QNV</a><br/><p>I know people that will not watch this film because of the subject matter. All I have to say about that is, get over it and grow up. This isn't a film about sexuality, or homosexuality. It is about 2 people, who happen to be men, who meet and grow close. Its not an explicit film, it is all done extremely well and directed beautifully and tastefully. Ang Lee is a favorite of mine, especially after Sense and Sensibility. Brokeback Mountain is easily another score for him. It really is a beautifully touching movie. I must say that at times, it frustrated me, or I should say, the characters frustated me. Everyone wants a happy ending but sometimes, Its just not possible. This is a depressing and moving film. And because of the maturity of Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal, its a very realistic and believable film. They really brought the characters to life and were very brave for attempting something that really wasn't attempted before in recent memory. Those actors took a risk and it worked. People will not forget this film. ***RIP Heath Ledger***</p></br><a href="../users/ANGH6401L9Y0T.html">ANGH6401L9Y0T</a><br/><p>This is a movie that needed to be made. It was just the right vehicle with which to go mainstream with a gay love story.<br /><br />It starts in 1963, when Ennis and Jack spend the summer as sheepherders (not cowboys, although Jack also does rodeos) on Brokeback Mountain. In a scene that seemed completely authentic to someone with no personal experience of homosexuality but plenty experience in sexuality, they end up making love one night in their tent. And we have to say making love, not having sex. There is real feeling here along with the masculine horseplay. Thus begins a loving friendship that lasts over 20 years, mostly on "fishing trips" and other camping adventures away from wives and prying eyes.<br /><br />Remember this starts in 1963, long before the word "gay" had been developed as a healthy way to describe male homosexuality. They had a lot nastier terms in those days. And Ennis remembers when he was a child, his Daddy took him and his brother to view the remains of a man who had been mutilated and killed for being one of a couple of men who lived together. Understand this: he did NOT happen upon the corpse accidentally; his daddy took him to see it. As Ennis said, he probably was one of the people that did it.<br /><br />So naturally they want no one to know about their relationship. Thus the movie explores some of the hazards of closets.<br /><br />OK, no spoilers here. But you definitely do not have to be gay, or even bi, to appreciate this movie. That is exactly what's so valuable about it. Even straights can have real sympathy for the two close friends, likable guys, who look the part, but just don't quite fit the stereotype of the he-man of the western mountains, the rodeo and the ranch.</p></br><a href="../users/A1Z2ZN39LL07GI.html">A1Z2ZN39LL07GI</a><br/><p>Great for dvd .. it's 2 disc edition with a lot limited collector's card. transfer pciture not good like blu-ray. perhaps maybe i buy it because said it collector's.

With that being said, I knew, (just like I'm sure you all did) the subject matter of the film, so I don't see why some viewers (no matter how few) act so offended by what they saw. Secondly, you must take into account when this movie takes place (time and era). Thirdly, It seems that instead of dewelling on the superb acting and storyline people are more so effected by the fact that it's about homosexuality between "gay cowboys". I guess the point flew over their heads that this is indeed a love story, and as with most love stories (except for teen movies) they all end in tragedy. It's usually in that tragedy that the person realizes what they lost. It actually took Ennis losing Jack to realize that he was the love of his life. I liked it because it was a realistic and very delicate look at love between 2 males. If I wanted to see gay guys sleeping around I could've sat at home and watched "Queer as Folk". Another thing is that people seem to be more disgusted at 2 guys than 2 women. I guarantee you if it had been 2 women the guys would've been cheering them on. Anyway, this sort of thing this has been apart of films for as long as I could remember.Let's not forget, Hilary Swank.."Boy's Don't Cry" or Charlize Theron..."Monster" it's just that "Brokeback Mountain" is sooo in your face. At any rate, to stay on topic, Heath Ledger made his character so believeable that he deserves an Oscar for this. Ennis' inner struggle with his own purpose, identity and sexuality is one that some of my best friends have had to endure. Prejudice is another. Jake's character Jack was also believable, and he deserves an Oscar as well. Even though I may be a straight woman, I could still relate to those feelings of love and hope for someone that you love, and only getting feelings of isolation, regret, shame and embarrassment in return. My only gripe is that I wish they would've explained the ending a lot better. I kinda keeps you guessing about what actually happened to Jack. I think they should've talked more about that. Like, Was he murdered in hate crime fashion because he was gay? Did someone else besides their boss see them on Brokeback Mountain? Did he come on to the wrong guy? I guess I just want to know..Why did they kill him? Also, I'm a little curious because at the end when his wife was talking to Ennis about Jack's death she didn't seem grief stricken like a wife who just lost her husband would. Did she find out about him like Ennis' wife did? or Did her father have something to do with it after Jack stood up to him? I had tons of unanswered questions by the time the movie was over. Which, by the way, this film was way too long come to think of it. However, you have to watch it with an open mind to like it.</p></br><a href="../users/A359IT81FBX64Y.html">A359IT81FBX64Y</a><br/><p>I resisted watching this film. At first I assumed it was a gimmick: a mainstream movie featuring "breakthrough" love scenes between gay men. Then I thought it would be too serious and depressing, with pain and misery on all sides. I was wrong on both counts, and Brokeback turns out to be the best movie of the year.<br /><br />But I wasn't completely wrong. It is a breakthrough film, and there is pain and misery, but the quality of the story, the script, and the acting rise above everything else and come across as true, compelling, and universal. Brokeback is not about gay love; it's not about forbidden love; it's not about star-crossed love. It's about accepting people for who they are and the joy of a true bond of love.<br /><br />I thought the love scenes might be a little off-putting, but they were genuinely touching. For Ennis and Jack, it wasn't just about sex; more important was the emotional freedom and trust they allowed each other, so they could open up to happiness rather than suffer in loneliness. Affection was easier for Jack, and it was especially heart-warming to see Ennis emerge from his shell.<br /><br />Brokeback is a bittersweet tale of the redeeming power of love, as well as the sometimes desperate struggle for love and against loneliness.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EBHHCZO6V2A4.html">A3EBHHCZO6V2A4</a><br/><p>"Brokeback Mountain" was a breakthrough in mainstream American cinema. It's the first (relatively) mainstream movie to address gay issues, and to treat a gay romance the same way as a straight one. In fact,the poster/CD cover of the leads was purposefully modeled on the one for "Titanic." Unlike "Titanic",however,"Brokeback" brings up important issues,has great depth,and is emotionally moving.<br /><br />Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) goes to the mountains of Wyoming for sheep herding. There,he meets Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal),and there's a spark between them. For a time,they enjoy a pastoral and amorous idyll. Soon,their paradise is lost. Both Ennis and Jack marry. They have children. They reunite every summer, their time together bittersweet. Apart from each other, Ennis and Jack break down. Ennis' marriage ends in divorce. Jack carries on an affair with another cowboy,and also has a one night stand with a Mexican prostitute. Jack has hopes for a life with Ennis-but Ennis is afraid. In the end, Jack is murdered in a gay-bashing,and Ennis lives a life mourning "the road not taken." Ledger is excellent as the emotionally uptight Ennis,while Gyllenhaal is heartbreaking as the hopeful Jack.<br /><br />"Brokeback Mountain" is hardly "homosexual propaganda" (as LifeSite has called it),or an "attack on masculinity" (according to DecentFilms) Jack&Ennis' mutual adultery does devastate their families. It's not the "adultery without consequences" that's so often glamorized. The consummation between Jack&Ennis is disturbing because it looks like a rape--not because it's between two men. The morning after is hardly domestic bliss-Ennis finds a lamb killed by a wolf during the night. Anne Hathaway is amazingly sympathetic as Jack's heartbroken wife.<br /><br />The positive aspects of the movie are the performances of the leads,the powerful soundtrack (Gustavo Santoalalla is great),its beautiful scenery.<br /><br />One can disagree with the movie's message that it's an argument for gay marriage,or that homosexual and heterosexual love are the same,but it stands as a work of an art. As a work of art,it's open to interpretation;it's hardly "a homosexual propaganda film." Does it say gay is OK? It depends on the viewer.<br /><br />The ending of "Brokeback Mountain" is a tearjerker. When Ennis cradles Jack's bloodied shirt in his arms,how can one be unmoved? "Brokeback Mountain" takes on new,poignant resonance in light of Heath Ledger's tragic,untimely death. Ennis was his breakthrough role,showing his promise as a subtle,powerful actor. He conveyed the depth of Ennis' emotional repression&suffering. Heath Ledger will rightly be remembered for "Brokeback".<br />RIP Heath Ledger (1979-2008)</p></br><a href="../users/A9LAPV8XNKZVZ.html">A9LAPV8XNKZVZ</a><br/><p>Upon initial viewing, I found the movie to be emotionally underwhelming.

There has not been a love story (released in the US) in the past thirty years that compares to "Brokeback Mountain." Anyone that appreciates classic cinema will totally enjoy "Brokeback Mountain" because it is emotional, heartfelt, and very thought-provoking. It's like watching The Titanic, " "The Wizard of Oz" and, "Johnny Guitar" all rolled into one picture, but even better.</p></br><a href="../users/AWPODHOB4GFWL.html">AWPODHOB4GFWL</a><br/><p>Annie Proux's short story is magnificently reproduced on the screen with Ang Lee's amazing cinematography.  It's as sparse and simple a tale as they get, but the drama is tense and sometimes unbearable.  Jack and Ennis are two sheepherders in 1963 Wyoming, working for little money that summer.  They unexpectedly fall in love, but each one takes a different path in life.  The film follows the result of their lives and their decisions over the next twenty years.  Most people have heard of this film, but those who have seen it can speak for the raw imagery and gut-wrenching story of love that cannot be fulfilled.  The pace is deliberate and every scene or piece of dialogue rings true.  This is an instant classic and one that will be remembered forever as the movie that used to be called the `gay cowboy movie'.</p></br><a href="../users/A26A64X86VL1R4.html">A26A64X86VL1R4</a><br/><p>Ang Lee's film is groundbreaking in that it is a mainstream movie that portrays passion between two men.  The story begins when two farm boys, Ennis and Jack, meet while herding sheep on isolated Brokeback Mountain.  The job is for the summer and they must camp out with the sheep.  They share the stories of their love deprived  childhoods and on a cold night they end up sharing a tent.  They make love and develop a passionate bond.  Taciturn Ennis is nearly incapable of revealing, let alone talking, about his feelings to the more demonstrative Jack.<br /><br />Over the next twenty years or so, Jack and Ennis meet for fishing trips and to renew their passion.  Both are married with children in their attempts to fit in to the demands of culture. Jack is able to express his dissatisfaction with being apart from his true love and repeatedly suggests that he and Ennis get a ranch together.  Ennis is barely able to talk about this, let alone allow himself to be with Jack.<br /><br />This film creates an atmosphere of love and longing, while unflinchingly showing the lack of acceptance by mainstream culture of alternate lifestyles.  The scenic splendour of nature is filmed with haunting clarity.  This provides an element of nature, almost as another character in the film, acting as a neutral witness to human passion.  Gyllenhaal and Ledger are touching and beautiful in their roles.  The supporting actresses playing their wives, Michelle Williams and Ann Hathaway, provide accurate and devastating performances.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UKC6QFG9L5GV.html">A2UKC6QFG9L5GV</a><br/><p>"Brokeback Mountain" reminded me of Clint Eastwood's "The Bridges of Madison County" by its mood and pacing. It's one of those love stories that really touch your heart. "Brokeback Mountain" is not a simple story, it's about two persons' relationship and this relationship is complex like life itself. Jack and Ennis love each other although none of them are gay as they put it. But Ennis has a wife and two daughters, Jack also has a wife and kid. Besides where they both come from the bonds between two men that are too tight are not appreciated. There's more - they both work as cowboys, usually very manly occupation. But they attracted to each other and they can't do anything about it.<br /><br />This film is about happiness, about how difficult is sometimes to reach it yet it seems to be very close. It's difficult and easy at the same time, you just need to desire it very much. Therefore it's about decisions we make - sometimes wrong, sometimes right, but in the end no one can tell wrong from right. Jack and Ennis could be happy but the price could be the unhappiness of two broken families. Apart from being afraid of publicity they decided not to be happy themselves but also not to ruin the lives of their wives and children. So "Brokeback Mountain" is about moral obligations too.<br /><br />Maybe in other circumstances, in another time Jack and Ennis could live happily somewhere. But the story is set exactly where and when it's set so they had no choice.<br /><br />I guess Brokeback Mountain itself symbolizes every person's dream. It's the place people crave, where they are totally happy. Jack and Ennis were happy there sleeping on the ground, eating beans every day and being cut from the rest of the world. It was their personal paradise. I think if they could they'd live on the mountain, but they couldn't (the reasons don't matter), they've chosen to be happy for a couple of times a year, driving away from everyone else, having just each other, in the place they felt alive. It doesn't matter where they went - even some tatty motel would be their Brokeback Mountain from then on.<br /><br />I think everyone has his own Brokeback Mountain, his paradise, a place where you can be yourself. And it's not always a "place" literally. Some people finally get there and some not. Jack and Ennis couldn't.<br /><br />"Brokeback Mountain" is a beautiful and sad story definately made by a sensitive person. And I'd say it's made for the sensitive. Ang Lee deserved his Oscar for sure. If you liked his "The Ice Storm" and you are not homophobic, you'll apprehend this film.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ01Q3070LT29.html">AQ01Q3070LT29</a><br/><p>Widecreen. Rated "R".

It was almost a break-through film, but just as it's about to give you an emotional pay-off, it cuts you cold.<br />  Why is Hollywood so afraid of making a male friendship movie with a happy ending?<br /><br /> A very diffucult film for both actors to do, but they both gave outstanding performances.<br /><br />Update: Heath Ledger died January 22, 2008, from an accidental overdose Acute intoxication, combined effects of painkillers, sleeping pills, anti-anxiety medication and other prescription drugs. He was 28. Heath had said he was not sleeping well, 2 or 3 hours only, because he was distraught about his role as the "Joker" in the new Batman movie, THE DARK KNIGHT (2008). He had a hard time getting out of the character. he also was separated from Michelle Williams and missed his daughter.<br />  His housekeeper found him naked laying face down at the foot of his bed. She came in to tell him his masseur had arrived.<br />  He will be missed! Rest in peace, Heath.<br /><br />  While The Dark Knight (2008) was already completed, he was filming The Imagination of Doctor Parnassus (2009). Johnny Depp, Jude Law and Colin Ferrell will continue his changing character in the film. The scenes with Heath Ledger will stay in the film.</p></br><a href="../users/A39AWL2FKWDFK6.html">A39AWL2FKWDFK6</a><br/><p>Ang Lee's slightly overhyped "Brokeback Mountain" was a decent story about a relationship forged between two Wyoming cowboys played by Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal who were to become lifelong soulmates.  The film benefited from Hollywoods perchant for heralding particular themes when selecting films for awards.  This years theme of alternative lifestyles elevated the film's status.  No question the film was cinematographically stunning with its gorgeous western panoramic vistas and desolate Wyoming towns.  The relationship between the men was poignant yet the film dragged at points.<br /><br />Their tabooed relationship was in stark contrast to the social mores present in the 60's and 70's in the remote West.  Ledger in particular was very effective as the taciturn Ennis Del Mar who finds love with Gyllenhaal playing Jack Twist as they work a summertime job of sheepherding on Brokeback Mountain.  Both men go on to marry and have children existing in largely unfulfilling relationships.  After a hiatus of four years they reconnect are able to find chunks of time where they go off together.<br /><br />The stories chronicles the evolution of their relationship over an approximately 15-20 year period of time that culminates unfortunately in tragedy.<br /><br />Ang Lee did a nice job in his direction and hefty Randy Quaid did well in his portrayal of the sheepherding boss Joe Aguirre.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>This movie got a large amount of controversy, all of it going to its theme: homosexuality. While it certainly feels like a breakthrough film, there have been films with the very same theme before. Most of them, however, are barely seen as they're usually arty independent movies or foreign ones. Brokeback in many ways shows that it's still a problem with people and while it may have some storytelling issues I have a problem with, it's still a solid story, it's only missing something that makes it an absolute masterpiece.<br /><br />In probably one of the most slowest opening 40 minutes I've ever seen, we follow Jack Twist and Ennis Del Mar as they become sheep herders. Alone for a long time, the 2 act on feelings that they might love each other. Of course the problem is they're both men which is very frowned upon at the time. The 2 go home and end up leading separate lives but are very much wondering about the love that could've lasted.<br /><br />Flash forward 4 years and Ennis marries Alma who gave birth to 2 daughters while Jack meets Lureen and they have a son. A meeting between the 2 men rekindles their relationship and now have a decision to make: to continue in short and increasing gaps of time or call it off forever, not experiencing each other's love anymore. This of course doesn't sit well with either of them, or their wives.<br /><br />There will be people who probably won't like this review(or any other like it) where I don't outright praise the film for the masterpiece that it is and that I either don't "get it" or I'm a homophobe. I'm not gay but I don't go after them either, it's love period regardless of who's in it(although I do have problems with animal lovers and pedophiles). The film has been called groundbreaking but really it's just a love story, only with 2 men. What about movies where the underdog team actually lost instead of triumphing in a big finish? Or a crime story that has the killer actually win? Storytelling wise these could be called groundbreakers too and they've been done before as well.<br /><br />Acting-wise it's straight across the board with Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway proving that they can be actresses(the latter's turn in Havoc was just wasted). Jake Gyllenhaal is good as well but the biggest attention went to Heath Ledger. Granted it's a very good performance full of nuance but at the same time, he almost mumbles through the entire thing. I'm glad I put subtitles on sometimes, otherwise I wouldn't know what he was saying half the time.<br /><br />It's odd how the filmmakers want us to root for the love of 2 gay men despite the fact both are committing adultery, one of which is actually with 2 others, including his wife. The other actually ends up getting divorced because of it and to see the 2 men get together only to hide away their feelings and be quiet about it you kind of wonder, "they seem happier with their women don't they?" It's slightly manipulative as well since the cinematography during their passionate love trips are beautifully shot with mountain ranges while their normal homes have drabby looking houses, crying kids and depressed looking wives. It's no wonder we want to root for the men don't we?<br /><br />I will give the film props though: it is a love story and it's handled nicely if one sided and the actors are more than willing to show it. It might seem like I'm using more from the con list but it does have great cinematography, a relaxing(if extremely repetitive) score which I have no idea why it won the Oscar. The story between the women could've been handled better though. Michelle Williams literally drops out at one point in the story and the direction on Anne Hathaway during her last scene makes the ambigious ending even moreso.<br /><br />Expect a double dip, this one is guaranteed. Obviously wanting to capitalize on the Oscar attention, the film comes with a very barebones disc, coming up with no more than 4 featurettes. No commentary? Deleted scenes? Coincidentally, Crash which got the upset Best Picture win over this film is released on the same day with a bigger release. Trying to steal thunder, methinks? It's a solid story and while it is a good film, I can see why it lost, although personally, Crash is no better.</p></br><a href="../users/A25PM9JGHPU8EI.html">A25PM9JGHPU8EI</a><br/><p>[...] I like the movie, but this is a dvd that is utterly LACKING in extra / bonus / supplementary material. The cover art has it listed as a "Four Star Collection". Well it's only getting 2 stars from me for NO commentaries, NO deleted scenes, NO isolated score, NO trailers. Maybe Universal is readying a "Randy Quaid Gets Paid Special Edition" for later. Any way you look at it, this edition is anorexic. There isn't even a booklet or anything when you open the case. Is this any way to issue this film? I think not. If you have to have it, you have to have it. You should wait for a deluxe edition if you can rather than get taken / swindled by Universal and Focus Features.</p></br><a href="../users/AMYMJ96STIRW.html">AMYMJ96STIRW</a><br/><p>This is a truly touching and moving presentation. It also perfectly captures the 60's when this sort of romance would have unfolded exactly as presented on the screen. The only problem is that same sex relationships, however romanticized, are doomed as was this one. Its brilliant portrayals and casting create an exquisitely overwhelming romantic fantasy!</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>For starters, I couldn't get anyone to watch it with me. Then there was either something wrong my ears, or my sound, cos Jake Gyllenhall & Heath Ledger seemed to mumble all their lines! It got very annoying, and I kept turning the sound up 'til nearly as far as it would go. Then the sex scenes are actually filmed in nearly complete darkness, so it's very difficult to see what actually is going on, but it's also very well done. But then they just seem to be sleeping, and the next thing you know is one is jumping on the other ... you know the rest.<br /><br />I quite liked both Jake & Heath in this, apart from the constant smoking, and the rest of the actors in this are amazing. Michelle Williams, playing a dowdy character for once in her life, is simply amazing as Ennis' on screen wife (and off screen), the scene where she discovers her husband's betrayal will bring a lump to anyone's throat, although it's implied in her previous scenes that she knows. Anne Hathaway takes her first major step away from The Princess Diaries & Ella Enchanted, by playing a bit of a cow, and doing her first blink-and-you'll-miss-it topless scene. Randy Quaid & Anna Faris also appear in this, as unrecognisable characters, I didn't actually realise it was them until reading the cast list.<br /><br />There is no other love story like this out there, and can play itself out without much in the way of dialogue, apart from half way through. Heath & Jake both took a major risk getting involved with this film, but they both pulled it off with little embarrassment. Ang Lee and all actors didn't shy away from the material put in front of them, they got on and did it and pulled out an unforgettable film.<br /><br />The ending is heartbreaking, and unforgettable, but also unpredictable. I did not see this coming. The almost final shots of their shirts together, and a postcard of Brokeback Mountain.<br /><br />This is a very hard film to review, second only to United 93. If you've known love, you'll be hit by a ton of bricks watching this film, it's so emotional, and really tugs at the heart strings. It's a film that some people will never see, but should.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BEU7GPGNIG44.html">A2BEU7GPGNIG44</a><br/><p>Brokeback Mountain is now available on DVD.  Heath Ledger stars in the film as Ennis.  He comes from a difficult background and seemingly broken home.  He takes a job as a rancher and meets Jack.  Jack is a rancher working rodeo.  Their bosss (Randy Quaid) has them working on the top of Brokeback Mountain isolated from the rest of the world.  The two men bond like good friends.  One cold evening Jack invited Enniss into his tent so that he can keep warm.  They soon find themselves embroiled in passion. It's the sixties and homosexuality between Wyoming cowboys is taboo.  They hide their feelings and Ennis initially has a hard time dealing with the situation, even declaring it a "one time thing," even though their trysts continue.  Ennis and Jack soon split up due to a change in their assignments. Ennis goes on to get married and becomes a father.  Jack still has a strong attraction to men but he eventually settles down with a woman.  When the two re-connect after time has passed they continue their hidden love.  Brokeback Mountain is a good movie, a little overhyped, a little soft porn, but a great story about two men living on "The DL."</p></br><a href="../users/A17FLA8HQOFVIG.html">A17FLA8HQOFVIG</a><br/><p>I saw this film a couple of months ago but just haven't gotten around to reviewing it.  By now, of course, everyone knows the general plot.  And everyone has an opinion about this film whether he or she has seen this film or not.  The opinions tend to follow the person's views on the gay issue.  This seems a little unfair because I think a good film should stand by itself and not just be a reflection of a personal opinion about its theme.<br /><br />The credits are impressive.  Ang Lee directed it.  As always, he makes the audience really understand his characters.  The two cowboys, as played by Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenthal, become real and easily identifiable for their very human qualities.  The film is based on a short story by Annie Proulx.  She writes about the dark side of the American West, not the place of the great John Wayne myths.  The writer, Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana are also experts on the west.  I would expect nothing but the best from them.<br /><br />The story is complex and more than the sum of its parts.  It starts in 1963 when the two young men spend a summer working together herding sheep on the lonely Brokeback Mountain.  For the entire summer, they have no other human companionship.  Naturally, a bond develops between them.  And then, on one cold and lonely night, they have a brief romantic encounter.  They both would like it to be only a one-time thing, but it isn't.  Their feelings grow for each other.  Later, they are discovered, go back to their respective lives, and try to forget each other.<br /><br />Both men marry.  Both have children.  The marriages are not happy.  And there are some scenes between these men and their wives that show the sadness and impact of these flawed marriages.  Then, several years later, the men come together again, and from then on, they spend several weeks each summer continuing their relationship on Brokeback Mountain.  They say they are going there to fish; but they never do bring home any fish.<br /><br />The story takes place over couple of decades.  It is a gloomy story, one that the audience knows will end badly.  There's fine acting, great scenery and everything else that deserves the accolades it received.<br /><br />Problem is, the film runs 134 minutes which is much too long.  The action is subtle and brings up unsettling emotions.  After a short while, I knew I had gotten the point of the film.  The storyline didn't really change and there were no surprises.  I found myself constantly looking at my watch.  If I had been home in front of my DVD I know I would have fallen asleep.<br /><br />I commend Brokeback Mountain for its breakthrough approach to a forbidden subject and some great acting.  It was just a little too slow for my taste.</p></br><a href="../users/A329U9CDUPKXAC.html">A329U9CDUPKXAC</a><br/><p>I read the book before the movie came out and my reaction was "They're making a movie on this?" It's just not that great of a story. Granted, the movie is better than the book. There are more characters. But still, it's just not that great. There's a lot of beautiful scenery in this movie though and good acting. Although I found Heath Ledger to be very difficult to understand half the time. I'd say this movie was good but not great.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ASIT0JYIGHTA.html">A2ASIT0JYIGHTA</a><br/><p>This was one of the most heartfelt films I have seen in recent years. The story of undying forbidden love in a time when it just was not accepted by society. It should be seen by all, and particularly  for the beautiful cinematography. It is however, not without faults.  Perhaps the biggest problem with the film is the role of Heath Ledger whose attempt at an American cowboy accent is so off the mark that it actually is very annoying to listen to throughout the film.  Heath mumbles his way through his role, and while he has touches of brilliance, I question why he was chosen.  Jake Gynenhaal, on the other hand, was simply brilliant and convincing throughout.<br /><br />Overall, a fascinating, brilliant film but let down by Heath Ledger.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TEMNM9ZEOLJ6.html">A1TEMNM9ZEOLJ6</a><br/><p>Ok, gay cowboys. I'd heard all the jokes. Still, this one is as good as you've heard. Sure, it gets a little icky here and there. And Jake really does look a little gay. I could barely understand Heath Ledger's cowboy accent, filtered through Aussie. Yet, the story is compelling, and the female stars as the wives are very good, indeed. Watch it. You won't be sorry.</p></br><a href="../users/A16Q1LYIDE2WDZ.html">A16Q1LYIDE2WDZ</a><br/><p>I thought this movie was missing something. I liked the concept, I liked the setting and I liked the love scenes. Something about this movie though seemed to fall flat. The acting was wooden and the emotions seemed fake. It wasn't really a great love story and seemed to lack real passion. After the first time, all of their meetings seemed painful, unsatisfying and not worth the effort. The overall tone of the movie was moody and I found the ending a little anti-climactic. I really respect the fact that writers and studios are getting brave enough to branch out and make movies about taboo subjects like this. It was a good effort but not a great movie. It wasn't terrible, it just left me feeling empty. It's kind of a depressing storyline with not a lot of happy moments, just a lot of pain, drama and problems. There seemed to be little chemistry between the two actors. Let me just say, I have no problem with people being gay and I would have felt the same way if this was a heterosexual story! There just were no sparks, and the movie came off as cold or lukewarm at best.</p></br><a href="../users/A5A2QE6NECFR5.html">A5A2QE6NECFR5</a><br/><p>I found this a little too long, a little too slow, a little too sad to rate five stars. Worth seeing once, it is an honorable effort to portray the power of forbidden love between two modern-day cowboys who would obviously vote Republican on all but gay issues, and perhaps even on some of those. Now that the film is a couple of years old, I think it is safe to reveal that one of the leads does not survive the film. That was the most disappointing part...we come to care about the men, yet one passes from this world with only the briefest of depictions. I was surprised it did not win the Oscar as best film, but the awards were given out before I saw the movie. Now that I have seen it, I think it can be fairly called one of the ten best films of its year, and one of the three most talked about, but not deserving of the top honor for its season. Good performances for sure, but the script could have used some trimming and some punch.</p></br><a href="../users/A5TZXWU8AALIC.html">A5TZXWU8AALIC</a><br/><p>Did anybody honestly believe that BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN was going to win Best Picture at the Academy Awards last month?<br />Come on, this is a business.<br />They may pick films that most of the country will never see but they're not going to pick a controversial film that'll jeapordize any box office revenue.  The media was focused on the hysterical rage of the gay community that flared up when CRASH was announced as the winner but you could also see the collective sigh of relief filling the auditorium when Nicholson called something other than BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN.<br /><br />Despite all the hype and the huge media push, in spite of all the blogs and message boards where gays brag about inflating the box office by seeing the movie a half-dozen times a week (or weekend), I don't think America wants to see this movie.  I live in a blood Red state filled with cowboys and NOT A ONE wanted to see this movie.<br /><br />It's about gay sheepherders.  Or they think they're gay sheepherders, although they keep telling each other they're not.  One wife finds out they're gay...but she doesn't say anything (that's in a perfect world, folks, because I've known wives who found out their husbands were gay and it was a cross between Jerry Springer and Armageddon.  Think about it: would the wives be so understanding if their hubbies were bunking up with a cowgirl?).<br /><br />The movie would've been more interesting if the two cowboys HADN'T been gay but everyone else THOUGHT they were.  They continue on their fishing and riding trips over the years and their families are gossiping and snickering while nothing sexual is happening between them.<br /><br />As it is, re: the fate of these two guys, I was waiting for Monty Python's Church Police to show up and "arrest Society...since society's to blame!"  It's like the Matthew Sheperd crime: nobody cares what someone does, just don't go hitting on drunken rednecks.<br /><br />And I'm still not ready to completely forgive Ang Lee for ruining THE HULK.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AP6H48QHX8BR.html">A3AP6H48QHX8BR</a><br/><p>I orginally saw this movie expecting it to live up to all the hype such as being told it was "one of the movies that will change the cinema forever." The movie itself is simplistic seen from a casual observer. You see the forbidden love/romance but, I was not convince that the love between Jack & Ennis was geniune you really see a few moments between here and there that make you feel as though they have a love connection- but the moments are so brief you cannot real see the true connection between the two.<br /><br />The movie taps into gay issues- such as hidden romance- not being able to reveal your "true self" or being misunderstood in society. For that the movie might change the cinema forever- making more movies that relate to gay romance/gay romance more accepted(because how it is NOT accepted in society in the movie).<br /><br />Ledger does an amazing job as Ennis a man torn between his own wants and what others expect of him. Both men do have families- and the beginning of both marriages seem almost like a sham or something that would have NEVER worked out regardless of how much either partner tired. The wives are portrayed as cold, non-responsive, and un-thoughtful... leading to perhaps that DIRE need Ennis & Jack have to be together and retreat to the place they intially fell in love "Brokeback Mountain."<br /><br />But, I seriously doubt that "Brokeback Mountain" will be here for generations or become the classic of this decade like "Titanic" or "Casablanca" will always live on. The truth is the movie has recieved the hype not for the movie itself but mainly the story matter- never has a gay romance movie gone mainstream or been accepted for that fact "Brokeback Mountain" will shape the history of the cinema and the United States. But, I highly doubt that future generations will look upon the movie as a "classic" but, more as a meer stepping stone in politics and society's views.<br /><br />If you don't want to see the movie for religious reasons or for personal beliefs than just don't see it- The movie will NOT convert or convince anyone to change their lifestyle or change their own views and truth is anyone who is against homo-sexuality for personal or religious reasons will NOT see the movie. All in all if you like simple romances and expect a simple movie/with simple concepts than you will enjoy this movie... hopeful this is just a drop in the bucket for future films/the country.</p></br><a href="../users/AG8U6F6226GBZ.html">AG8U6F6226GBZ</a><br/><p>The main thing I didn't understand was if these two guys really wanted to be together, why didn't they move someplace where they could be accepted?  There have been many cities that accepted gays. NY, SF, New O., Chicago, and most major cites in the north. Why not go there? If they they were gay why did they marry women?  None of this made sense to me. I remember the 60's and there were gay people who were out, and nobody cared.  I don't think the movie was a true perspective of gay life when these 2 guys got together.  It wasn't until the 80's and HIV came along that homosexuality became a big scare, and with good reason.  But back in the 60s and 70's gays were accepted in many cities.<br /><br />If they wanted to ride around in the mountains, and get married, then they made their choices.  Nobody can have it all.</p></br><a href="../users/A32XW50ILWOXNO.html">A32XW50ILWOXNO</a><br/><p>The deepest wounds to "Brokeback Mountain" have been inflicted by those who trumpet as more than the humble masterpiece that it is. A breakthrough picture for gay rights...a torch for tolerance...such bouquets diminish the universal themes found in the movie's story of two men - one gay, one confused, both broken - and their 20-year love affair after a summer herding sheep in the Wyoming highlands. "Brokeback Mountain" drips with longing and regret that knows no sexual orientation.<br /><br />Director Ang Lee opens his picture in a gravel parking lot occupied by Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) and Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal). They're silent strangers brought together by ranch manager Joe Aguirre (Randy Quaid). Jack's estranged from his father. Ennis' dad is dead. Aside from the job, that's their first bond. They swap jobs once on the mountain. They drink whiskey, shoot coyotes, curse the beans in tomato sauce. Jack makes a move one night when they both sleep in the tent. Ennis relents. The experience and the totality of the summer ruins him.<br /><br />The Academy Award winning screenplay from Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana explores how the men live on unsteadily, marry women, have children, and get together one or twice a year for a "fishing trip." That's a change from E. Annie Proulx's source short story, which mostly recounts Ennis and Jack's arguments and passions during their encounters. What Lee, McMurtry and Ossana transform her story into is an epic that reveals the pain Ennis spreads to his wife Alma (Michelle Williams), the daughter most like him (Kate Mara) and, after divorcing Alma, to a hopeful waitress named Cassie (Linda Cardellini). Jack has more of an agreement with his hardened Daddy's girl Lureen (Anne Hathaway) than a marriage - "we could do it over the phone," he tells Ennis - and it frees him to make as many trips to Mexican bathhouses as he chooses.<br /><br />Jack's a dreamer, and he begs Ennis to work a ranch with him. Ennis answers with a childhood story about a couple cowboys who live together, "tough old birds," who were found beaten and castrated at the bottom of a ditch. It goes on like that, Jack wanting more than Ennis will give. Jack wants the summer eternal. Ennis, broke, estranged from his own children, unable to look his ex-wife in the eye, is also wracked with love and lust, yet empty, distant.<br /><br />For all its anguish, "Brokeback Mountain" has a lovely, good-natured screenplay full of small asides and local humor, probably courtesy of McMurtry ("Lonesome Dove," "The Last Picture Show"). It allows us to enjoy the men as men, the women as women, a laugh as a laugh. Lee orchestrates a particularly good scene on Thanksgiving, where a long-running feud between Jack and his father-in-law culminates in an argument over whether Jack's son can watch TV during dinner. Lee is a model of restraint in every scene but one, where a buff Jack washes his torso while Ennis sits in the foreground, cooking beans. Lee has already helmed a domestic masterpiece in "The Ice Storm;" he combines his ability to reveal dining-table truths with artistic helicopter shots of the mountain.<br /><br />Ledger is some actor. It takes range to play the burdened Ennis, Casanova and surfer hippie ("The Lords of Dogtown") in one year. He is the picture of repression in "Brokeback Mountain" a character worth genuine pity who, when he finds the right words for his daughter in the movie's last scene, has accomplished a feat 20 years in the waiting. That he reserves it for her is overlooked by most critics - Proulx's story doesn't have this ending - but crucial to appreciating what Ennis has learned. Gyllenhaal is 25, yet he plays the older Jack fiercely. He's a selfish SOB, but hard not to like. Both twang and spit the distinctive cowboy chatter of the screenplay with ease. Williams and Hathaway convey enough in short onscreen bursts, and the pretty Mara, like Ledger, transmits a lot through her silences.<br /><br />To its end, "Brokeback Mountain" refuses to underline itself. It is a calm, sad, loving sigh of a thing. So while the inevitable, crude backlash is unfortunate, Lee does his own efforts no great favor to rewrite his film as an event or monument when it was made on a modest budget as modest movie about average men. And Proulx's letter to the Academy following the movie's Best Picture loss to "Crash" is arrogant and damaging to the potential audience it could reach. This is a work of art. Not an essay. Pop culture has done it few favors. Maybe time will.</p></br><a href="../users/AGRR05FH945HR.html">AGRR05FH945HR</a><br/><p>Bravo, to all the fine men and women, gay and straight, who have stood up for this beautiful movie.<br /><br />While there have been many excellent movies about relationships between men, they have often been semi-obscure art movies. With Brokeback Mountain, we are seeing the same level of intelligence and sensitivity in a mainstream movie. The fact that the two main characters are cowboys, a traditionally masculine image, makes this all the more powerful. Yes, you can be gay and macho at the same time.<br /><br />This is a long overdue, stereotype-breaking movie. While this was initially set in the early sixties, we still live in a society in which there are definite limits to 'acceptable conduct', based on gender. Even today, if two men greeted each other with a kiss in a supermarket setting, the way women often do, they would be seen as nancy boys. Traditionally, men are only allowed to be affectionate with each other on the sports field or on the battlefield.<br /><br />Full marks to the writer, the cast, and Ang Lee above all for their courage and vision.</p></br><a href="../users/A2G6GO4O7EVCPF.html">A2G6GO4O7EVCPF</a><br/><p>Brokeback Mountain is of course the movie about Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist, 2 cowboys who spend one summer up on Brokeback Mountain together with the sheep. Along the way they make love to one another in which case Ennis says he isnt that way. They dont want anyone else to know about it so they keep it a secret. Ennis' wife Alma Del Mar is played by the wonderful Michelle Williams (The Baxter, Dawson's Creek). They have a daughter as well. Jack falls in love with rodeo girl Lureen Newsome played by cutie Anne Hathaway (Havoc, Princess Diaries 1 & 2). They have a son together. Jack gets in contact with Ennis and the two of them spend time fishing which is what they do but also their love for each other grows. Alma right away discovers the secret hiding and bottling it up inside of her all throughout. I ignore the bad reviews and snippy remarks and the jokes and just watch the movie and I thought it was pretty good for what it is. Heath Leger (Lords of Dogtown, Casanova) and Jake Gyllenhaal (Donnie Darko, Jarhead) give superb performances. The scene in which Gyllenhaal yells at his step-father to sit down was a great scene...I was waiting for Gyllenhaal to deck that guy. I had to put subtitles on half way for Ledger because some times he'd talk real low and I couldnt understand what he said but I got it all. Do I think it was snubbed at Oscar time? Uh, it was but I did liked Crash. The cinematography is great.

The first thing I liked was the beauty of the natural setting at the start of the movie when the couple at the heart of this story, Jack and Ennis, were atop Brokeback Mountain itself. The other was during the fireworks scene when Heath Ledger's character punched out the rude biker type who was cussing and being crude around his little girls. The rest of the film...well...<br /><br />I realize this is one of those stories where if you don't like it, you're instantly and with a closed-mind convicted of being a homophobe (such a convenient passive-aggressive term!) or unenlightened, or the ever-pat, "you just didn't get it."  I disagree. I'd like to think I'm at least as enlightened as the next person out there and if I'm accused to failing to "get" Brokeback Mountain, then I'll turn the tables and say maybe a large portion of the audience was too ready to excuse too much here and proclaim its greatness for reasons other than its onscreen merits. Namely: "Hey, look at how cool I am, embracing this movie about homosexuality!"<br /><br />I suspect many hailed Brokeback Mountain as masterpiece because they felt its subject matter was somehow artsy, ground-breaking, and morally sophisticated. I'll leave those evaluations to others. All I know is I saw it from a neutral perspective and I did not like this film. I expected I'd at least come away seeing some sort of quality to it, but even that is largely lacking. Michelle Williams, who gave seven seasons worth of fine performances on Dawson's Creek was such a washed-out weakling here, it was almost unrecognizable that she possesses the acting talents she does. I realize both the lead actors are in reality heterosexual men, but even so, for supposedly portraying two souls deeply in love, I discerned no chemistry at all between them, only a coldness that made it clear they were just two actors playing parts: disbelief was not suspended, reality intruded into the plot. If anything, a good subtitle for these guys might've been "dumb and dumber". Kissing like they did in public, in plain sight of one of their wives, in town, and their boss up on Brokeback Mountain? And yet thinking they were keeping some sort of secret for twenty-whatever years? Am I alone in seeing that as...stupid?<br /><br />What really put me off was not the relationship between the men, adulterous though it was, it was the fact these supposedly sympathetic figures were complete and total jerks. Obviously they were miserable and wished to impose that misery on anyone close to them. They were terrible fathers, especially Ennis, who constantly and cruelly let his longsuffering daughter down, rotten (and unfaithful) husbands, and not even very good friends and lovers to one another. How anyone felt anything but alienation radiating from these two defies explanation. If this is the movie that was meant to be a groundbreaking ambassador for the gay community, I think gays are in trouble, because far from advancing the cause of that segment, surely this is a closet-embracing backset.</p></br><a href="../users/A1C7BWPATO40VA.html">A1C7BWPATO40VA</a><br/><p>This is a movie that has gotten glowing reviews. IMO, it is a love it or hate it movie. I didn't really enjoy it much because, to put it plainly, it bored me to death. The movie drags on at a realistically paced soap opera. I admit the acting was decent and the story was alright, but it was really boring. I would definitely not watch this again, even on a boring rainy day with green eggs and ham.<br /><br />Problems:<br /><br />1. The plot of the movie isn't really complex. I won't say it since it'll spoil it for you.<br /><br />2. The love scenes and love relationship in general feels more like a fetish reenactment or a spare the moment "I haven't gotten any for a long time" kind of thing. The love never really hits a believable level where you're like "yeah, they really care for each other even without the sex". Sex is the limit of their love. I know the movie tries to portray it differently but come on now every time they meet there's always some sexual encounter. They never really build their relationship much past that point.<br /><br />3. The movie was extremely static and slow paced. If I was ever to be tortured, watching this movie again would probably be the finishing move.....<br /><br />4. Have anyone noticed that the characters don't really change physically even though they said it's been about 20 years or so? In the end when BLANK met his daughter, the daughter almost looked like his wife, the dad and the daughter looked almost the same age!<br /><br />5. No satisfactory conclusion. I guess that's how it works in real life but again it goes back to the pretty static plot. You would think that there's some sort of better resolve in the end, but it just feels like the whole moral of the movie was "love sucks, don't get into it or you'll be like US (echo effect).<br /><br />I was seriously bored out of my mind. I just thought there would be something that would make this movie more rewatchable or rather....watchable at all. It just bored me to death. I'm very open to different types of movies, but yeah...<br /><br />My thoughts are: I think the only reason this movie got so much attention and overexaggeration is because of one single thing. HEATH LEDGER. Well, that and of course because it stands for homosexuality and the ever growing community which supports it WHICH probably explains the ratings.</p></br><a href="../users/A9Q28YTLYREO7.html">A9Q28YTLYREO7</a><br/><p>Heath Ledger&Jake Gyllenhaal really had alot of Chemistry. that is probably One of the most noticeable things about this film. the directing was really good as well. the film was hit&Miss in terms of pacing&also the story lines hit on some cliches,but the film was interesting.</p></br><a href="../users/A387BD735MI50R.html">A387BD735MI50R</a><br/><p>The scenery in this movie is breathtaking. The framing and photography sweep you into the vastness of twilight prairie and mountain. You feel at the same time at one with nature, and isolated and insignificant in its grandeur.<br /><br />So I found visual thrills in this movie, but unfortunately not the thrill of any real love story. Yes, there can be tacit love. And yes, cowboys are notoriously taciturn. But there's a limit. Ultimately, human love has to be built on some words, on some shared history, on some weaving of one's individual biography into a shared narrative. And there is none of that here.<br /><br />Heath Ledger is so choked back and nonverbal in his roll as Ennis that I at first had to turn on the English subtitles to my DVD to catch what few words he is mumbling. There doesn't seem to be any point beyond the sexual in being with someone like him. He has no enlarging view to offer, no wit, no sustaining support. And the Jack Twist character isn't much better.<br /><br />But the men's failure as lovers goes beyond their inarticulateness. If you truly love someone, you carry a lamp glowing inside you. You see reflections of that person in everyone you meet and so you confer that spark to all your encounters in life. You bring that spark to everything you do. It sustains and animates you. It makes you want to perfect. And there was none of that here.<br /><br />To the contrary, the two men make the lives of their everyday spouses and girlfriends a misery by their inexplicable unavailability, their withdrawal and lack of essential interest. They are always elsewhere. They are always frozen in disaffection for the ones with whom they might really have forged some bond, albeit not a bond based on any sexual urgency.<br /><br />Lust aches. Love lightens. So this relationship never much gets beyond lust. Instead of carrying their forbidden love as a secret charm that could radiate, the two men in this movie schlep through their days spreading a sort of emotional blight wherever they go. Instead of being a tragedy about how prejudice prevented two people from being together, the overriding tragedy of this movie is how often people can't get beyond specific sexual craving in order to joyfully abide in the life that is proffered to them.<br /><br />Finally, were the namings of these two characters (Ennis and Twist) a little too suggestive? I didn't read the Annie Proulx short story on which this movie is based. So I don't know if her original characters had these names. If they did, it seems to undermine any serious, heartfelt intent for the story. By the unlikely coincidence of these men having Stud Magazine names, it in fact seems to reduce and doom their relationship from the outset to - just sex.</p></br><a href="../users/A2JXAQ92WYPAAR.html">A2JXAQ92WYPAAR</a><br/><p>The movie has a lot going for it, as has been said , and said well, here and elsewhere. For myself, the movie was visually pleasing and refreshing in some ways, too, but I had some problems with what is by now esteemed a virtual classic. I am a middle-aged guy, been around, lived in several states (though not Wyoming), but I have never seen a man cry, not once in my life. In this movie the guys are always crying. They cry when they meet, they cry when they separate, they cry after they kiss, they cry after they fight. Is this believable? In the film, it is 1963 and gay or not, I just don't believe they would have gotten through life intact crying all the time. Somewhere along the way, some male figure would have put them straight on this. They seem to have gotten the message on the shame of their sexuality, is it credible that they could have survived crying their way through high school, through military service, and so on? They would have had to learn the hard way that crying would not be tolerated. This seems like a small point, but for me it is indicative of the overall anachronistic mode of the film, which looks and feels a lot like two 1980s Santa Monica gays time traveling back in the 1960s. Maybe I'm wrong, but I think they wouldn't have survived a junior high school gym class weeping and slobbering they way they do.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>"Brokeback Mountain" is based on a short story by E. Annie Proulx about two men who, young and poor, meet in 1963 when they tend a herd of sheep for the summer on Wyoming's Brokeback Mountain. Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) is laconic, introverted and plans to marry shortly. Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) is an outgoing rodeo jock, estranged from his family, who dreams of better things. Isolated and increasingly attracted by their mutual differences, the two men have a passionate affair. When the summer is over, Ennis marries his sweetheart Alma (Michelle Williams), and they start a family. Jack moves up in the world by marrying Lureen (Anne Hathaway), the rebellious daughter of a well-to-do farm equipment distributor in Texas. Ennis and Jack see one another sporadically over the next couple of decades on fishing trips where they rekindle their relationship, and Jack becomes increasingly frustrated with Ennis' resignation that their association can never be more than occasional and secretive.<br /><br />"Brokeback Mountain" is a story of cowboys, but it is not a "Western" genre film. It's an "epic love story" genre film in the sense of being a stock story of 2 people who fall in love in their youth and are kept apart by social conventions. We've all seen this plot a thousand times, but "Brokeback Mountain" fails to convince as either "epic" or "love story". Annie Proulx's short story is intimate and focused. The material isn't suitable for an epic. The film doesn't have the production values to pull it off anyway. The 1.85:1 format doesn't flatter the Wyoming landscapes, and attempts at grand vistas undermine the core tension in the plot. As to the love story, I don't see it. There is no chemistry between Ennis and Jack and no evidence of undying love. Ennis and Jack seem like buddies who get the hots for one another now and again. Their fishing trips come across simply as nostalgia for a time when they were young and happy, not stolen moments of desperate love. There is nothing wrong with that. In fact, the short story gives the same impression. But it's clearly not what the film's screenwriters or director intended.<br /><br />The filmmakers intended a love story with a message (so they've said). For that, the actors needed help from the editor and cinematographer. The short story has no such agenda. Annie Proulx's story succeeds precisely because it focuses on the intimate relationship between these 2 men to the exclusion of everything else. The film shows us a lot of open spaces and wide angles. Poorly chosen lenses and landscapes make it difficult, if not impossible, for Jack and Ennis' alleged frustration and desperation to come through. Poorly chosen cuts and excessive length dilute the main storyline. Forty-five minutes should and could easily have been cut from the film to focus its emotions. Screenwriters Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana intended to "flesh out" Annie Proulx's story. But instead they stretched it out and watered it down with extraneous material. Alma, who is a credible, embittered character in the short story, has been made weak and weepy. Her acrimony is transferred to Lureen. Ennis comes across simply as someone who can't decide what he wants, and Jack as someone who always wants things that are out of reach. The trouble is that the movie is about two men deeply in love. Supposedly. "Brokeback Mountain" is excessively long, unfocused, and unconvincing.<br /><br />The DVD (Universal 2006): There are 4 featurettes. "On Being a Cowboy" (6 min) includes interviews with the cast, director Ang Lee, stunt coordinator, and animal wranglers on how the actors learned to ride and rope. "Directing from the Heart: Ang Lee" (8 min) includes interviews with the cast, producers, and cinematographer in which they speak about Ang Lee. Lee himself talks about the film's dramatic themes. In "From Script to Screen: Interviews with Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana" (11 min), the screenwriters talk about adapting Annie Proulx's story, which takes up only half of the screenplay. No kidding. (A bit of sarcasm there.) "Sharing the Story: The Making of Brokeback Mountain" (20 min) is a "Logo Movie Special" documentary made for television about making the film, from preparing the actors to filming in Canada, to audience reactions. Captions are available for the film in English, subtitles in Spanish and French, dubbing in French.</p></br><a href="../users/A2OFSDJB3MVQ16.html">A2OFSDJB3MVQ16</a><br/><p>I had no qualms about viewing this highly praised movie since I've seen in the past such films as "Sunday, Bloody Sunday" (directed by the gay director, John Scheslinger) and a highly rated Movie for TV "That Certain Summer" with Hal Holbrook as a divorced "out of the closet" gay man dealing with his young son's discovery about why his parents divorced. These films were both excellent and I looked forward to seeing this film but I was disappointed. Despite excellent acting from Heath Ledger and Michelle Williams, the film left me cold.  I think one of the reasons was that the film focused a little too much on the two male characters and less on the women.  My question too was did Anne Hathaway's character know that her husband was gay--and what were the consequences that resulted in their marriage.  Maybe director Ang Lee's approach is a little too detached for this material and also the writing had too many questions unanswered for me to fully enjoy this film.  Sorry but "Crash" though not a perfect film really deserved the Best Picture Oscar.</p></br><a href="../users/A2SNUORW55MZWO.html">A2SNUORW55MZWO</a><br/><p>This movie has the worst story and character development.

It's still on my mind. It recently came to the forefront when I saw a stack of DVDs in my local warehouse club. I was tempted to buy, but didn't. But the sight prompted this review. This has to be one of the best movies I've ever seen. Absolutely stunning.<br /><br />"Brokeback Mountain" is a tragic love story, and it's tragic on every scale. It was set largely in rustic and scenic Wyoming (actually, Alberta) and it unfolded as two young men met as employees of a local rancher. Their task was to care for a herd of sheep on Brokeback Mountain over the summer months. They gradually became friends and then "special friends." At the end of the summer, they parted and went on with their lives including getting married and raising families. The experience of Brokeback Mountain, however, proved too strong and they gradually started getting back together again, and again. The result was an aching love story and a growing tragedy for the men, their families and all concerned. The story riveted my attention and was painful to watch. My girlfriend and I left the theater and we couldn't talk. We were both choked up by the emotional impact. We discussed it for the next several months, however. The movie was that powerful.<br /><br />Everyone associated with this film should get an award of some kind. The director gently reached out and grabbed hold of the audiences' attention. He then allowed the tragic story to unfold amid a spendid scenic backdrop and accompanied by wonderful music. In watching it, you feel as if you're a part of the story, or at least a fly on the wall. This film is amazing and very powerful. View it, by all means. If the subject matter bothers you, don't buy and complain. This film deserves a lot more respect than some of the coarse remarks in certain viewer reviews.</p></br></body></html>

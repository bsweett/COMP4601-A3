Perhaps this fact tells you something about this biographical movie about Margaret Thatcher here played by Meryl Streep. Not surprisingly, Meryl Streep shows what a seasoned performer like her can do, and you will not be disappointed with her acting. As to the film itself, however, maybe you should read a book instead.<br /><br />My complaint is a simple one. This is a life story of a political icon Margaret Thatcher, and that means it is full of events, so why not tell the story in a straightforward and linear way?<br /><br />Instead of that, "The Iron Lady" insists on showing Margaret Thatcher in her later years, seeing hallucinatory visions of her deceased husband Denis (Jim Broadbent). The film goes back and forth in time between today when aged Margaret Thatcher is seen talking with Denis, and several important episodes in her political career like the Falklands War.<br /><br />I don't know who is responsible for the unnecessarily complicated narrative structure, writer Abi Morgan ("Shame") or director Phyllida Lloyd ("Mamma Mia!"). Despite the solid performances from the supports including Richard E. Grant and Anthony Head, "The Iron Lady" does not tell us much about Margaret Thatcher, whether as a prime minister or a person.</p></br><a href="../users/A2198O25QYUPXE.html">A2198O25QYUPXE</a><br/><p>"The Iron Lady" is a biographical drama film of the life of Baroness Margaret Thatcher.<br /><br />The narrative focuses on an aging Thatcher with fading health, reflectively looking back on her life and career.<br /><br />It was ambitious of the film directors to try and incorporate so many facets of Thatcher's life into a single feature film. This is because several aspects of her life are significant enough to be separate films. For example her rise within the Conservative Party as a female politician or the Falklands War both contain enough depth to be separate films. Notwithstanding this the viewer is presented with numerous major events in Thatcher's life such as: her admittance to Oxford University as the daughter of a green grocer, her progression as a Conservative Member of Parliament, tenure as Leader of the Opposition, and eleven years as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.<br /><br />The quality of acting is engaging and this film honourably acknowledges Thatcher's breakthrough political career.<br /><br />Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>When I first heard about THE IRON LADY, I was eager to see the movie.  I am a child of the 1980s and because of that I will always respect and admire Margaret Thatcher. As a kid, I remember seeing her on tv and listening to some of her speeches. I liked what I heard. She was the only current foreign leader I knew anything about until around fifth grade. As the first (and so far only) female Prime Minister of Great Britain, it wasn't until years later that I realized how extraordinary Thatcher's rise was. Her rise to the Prime Ministership is an incredible story that illustrates how freedom and determination can allow a person to rise above the position they were born into. It's a story that resonates particularly with women. Unfortunately, THE IRON LADY doesn't focus on that. Instead, it chooses to tell a story about Thatcher that revolves more around the spirit of the woman than the actual woman herself.<br /><br />THE IRON LADY opens with a present-day Thatcher (circa 2009) patiently waiting in line at a grocery store to buy a pint of milk. This moment seems bizarre and almost absurd. Yet, its significance is revealed as the film unfolds. This trip to the grocery store reinforces to Thatcher's staff that she is slowly losing her mind; they see her as a poor elderly grandparent who can no longer be trusted to make her own decisions and live by herself. However, to Thatcher the simple act of buying a pint of milk is extremely important; it is one of the ways she has stayed connected to and in touch with the people she has served her whole life.<br /><br />After that opening sequence, THE IRON LADY flashbacks to an earlier time in Thatcher's life. For me, this was one of the most disconcerting parts of the entire movie. Flashbacks serve a purpose, but they should be used sparingly. In THE IRON LADY, they are used on a regular basis throughout. I suppose one of the reasons for this is that the flashbacks echo memories Thatcher is recalling in the present at particular moments. This constant rewinding into the past and fastforwarding into the present augments the sensation in the audience that Thatcher is, perhaps, losing her mental faculties. This particular framing mechanism would be fine if it worked, but it doesn't. So, instead of empathizing with Thatcher, the audience is just left feeling nauseous and not really knowing why.<br /><br />Amidst this constant flux and flow of memories, is Denis Thatcher, Baroness Thatcher's husband. In the film's present day, Denis has been deceased for several years. However, Thatcher sees him and sometimes has conversations with him. She tries to ignore him or drown his voice out, but no matter what she does, she can't get rid of him. Denis Thatcher is the catalyst for much of what happens in the THE IRON LADY. For instance, Thatcher's staff and daughter keep trying to get her to let go of her dead husband's belongings, but for most of the movie she is unable to do so. In her mind, getting rid of Denis's clothes and other belongs is like completely erasing Denis from her life. It's rather touching and quite romantic; a love between two people that is so strong that even in death it cannot be broken. However, this love story between a woman and her dead husband is also the greatest drawback of the movie.<br /><br />Instead of being a story about the incredible life of Margaret Thatcher, THE IRON LADY is a love story about two regular people that revolves around the struggle of one of those people to keep their mental faculties. I can somewhat understand why the filmmaker chose to make THE IRON LADY this way because it seems to humanize Thatcher. But, in delineating Thatcher's story to the realm of romance and framing the story within the context of a woman struggling with her own sanity, THE IRON LADY turns Thatcher's life into just a movie about aging and mental health and not about Margaret Thatcher. I don't want to see ordinary Margaret Thatcher as a woman in love struggling with dementia. I watched THE IRON LADY because I wanted to see a movie about Margaret Thatcher, the impressive and formidable woman who became the first female Prime Minister of England, an inspiration for woman everywhere. I wanted to see the fiery Margaret Thatcher who helped tear down the Iron Curtain, took back the Falkland Islands, stopped England from becoming a debtor nation, and what made her tick. Instead, what I got was a love story between a dead husband and his wife and her struggle against dementia.<br /><br />Despite the storytelling flaws, I did enjoy parts of THE IRON LADY because of the acting. Meryl Streep is uncanny as Thatcher; the mannerism and vocal inflections are nearly perfect. The resemblance between the actress and the Baroness is at times surreal. Jim Broadbent portrays Denis Thatcher and he makes a great foil to Streep's Thatcher. Also impressive are Alexandra Roach as the younger Thatcher and Harry Lloyd as the younger Denis Thatcher.<br /><br />Overall, THE IRON LADY is an unremarkable movie about one extraordinary remarkable real-life woman. The movie is worth watching for the acting, but average filmgoers might be so turned off by the storytelling that they'll sleep through the fine performances. The film also offers something to those who like romances and to those with an interest in mental health.</p></br><a href="../users/A3MV1KKHX51FYT.html">A3MV1KKHX51FYT</a><br/><p>The Iron Lady, 2011 film<br /><br />A woman buys a pint of milk at a grocery. [The story proceeds slowly. What was its purpose?] There is a flashback to the bombing of WW II. Margaret helps her father at his store (like a good daughter should). The TV tells about an explosion at a Brighton hotel. Next Miss Roberts is chosen as a Conservative candidate for Parliament. She explains her viewpoints. [The film keeps skipping from the present to the past. This is confusing to anyone who knows little of her history.] Margaret will marry Dennis but wants to be more than a housewife. In retirement she watches old home movies of her children. "They grow up so fast." She wins a seat in Parliament in 1959 (because of a divided opposition). "Welcome to the madhouse." She makes a speech. A strike stops garbage collection and other services. There was a coal miner's strike over lowered wages circa 1972.<br /><br />Margaret decides to run for leader of the party on principle. A man advises her on her appearance to attract voters. She takes voice lessons to project her image. A friend is killed by a bomb! In 1979 she became the first woman Prime Minister in the Western World. [The film jumps ahead again.] Baroness Thatcher was called "The Iron Lady". She cut the budget and privatized services. [So how did that work out for the British?] Did she "change the face of history"? Did her policies cause a drop in industrial production? Were people becoming impoverished? There was growing unemployment. Bombs are set off! The Argentinians invaded the Falkland Islands. Maggie said sink the Belgrano (as it was returning home). An Exocet missile hits British frigate. The British retake the Falkland Islands. This victory proves popular and boosts her standing. She asks for new taxes on everyone and accuses those who disagree with her of cowardice. [Has she grown proud and arrogant?] There are disturbances in the streets.<br /><br />The jumping back and forth in the first half of this movie makes it difficult to follow if you know little of the details of her life. It should have followed the historical sequence. You see actors who represent actual politicians; they are unknown to those who know the details of British politics. Thatcher destroyed the national coal industry to make the country dependent on imported oil and gas (as far as I know). This benefitted these special interests. The future will decide if this was a correct decision.<br /><br />There was a military coup in Argentina in the mid-1960s (part of the "Alliance for Progress"). It led to the oppression of the people. The attempt to reclaim the Falkland Islands with an invasion. This failure led to their overthrow and a more democratic government. The same thing happened in Greece a decade earlier. Is there a lesson here?<br />I wonder about the powers that first backed Maggie Thatcher then switched to a new leader (she was rejected by her own party). There was not mention of this in the movie. Was Great Britain in better shape after her reign as Prime Minister? What corporations promoted her?</p></br><a href="../users/A3SS6VRWCTB7V.html">A3SS6VRWCTB7V</a><br/><p>Looking to be educated.

Whether or not you embrace conservatism, you have to agree that Margaret Thatcher was not just a important political figure but an extremely important one.<br />Told in a series of flashbacks, and through many imaginary conversations that Thatcher keeps on having with her husband, Dennis Thatcher or DT, this film is filmed after her tenure as the British PM. It traces her roots- small grocer's family, her entry into politics and finally her act as the British PM. We simply get a glimpse of her rise but only superficially. The movie does not reveal her relations with her children or friends. I realize that such an endeavor is impossible in the hour and 45 minute run time. However, to get a fleeting glimpse on the British PM, this film is great. Nothing more was expected and the film delivered just that . Three stars. 7/15/2012</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>The idea of a film portrayal of Margaret Thatcher is an interesting one.  I just really wish that this film were more interesting.  Instead of giving us anything of substantial depth, director Phyllida Lloyd serves up a series of scenes that serve no purpose other than to prove that Meryl Streep can do anything.  Sadly, her performance is hindered so drastically by the horrific pacing and emotional emptiness that I feel her Oscar win will be largely considered one of the most undeserved in recent years.<br /><br />I'm not going to sit here and bash the film.  It isn't...terrible.  Some critics were relentless and some of my friends said it was the worst film of 2011.  It wasn't.  At least this film isn't insulting.  I would watch this again before watching something like `The Descendants'.  That being said, this film is far from good.  It is actually pretty bad, especially for what it attempts to do.  Lloyd is a very inept director (as was proven by her botched job with `Mamma Mia') and trying to tackle something of considerable depth left her coming up VERY short.  She manages to take a woman who had so many stories to tell and reducing her to a montage a scenes with zero complexity.  The shoddy editing takes us in and out of Thatcher's life, at times in nonsensical order, as a way of weaving her past into her present, but this only serves as a way to take us out of the story and place us elsewhere.  If it weren't for Streep's obvious handle of the material I would have turned the film off a quarter of the way through.  It lags too often, and the unintentional camp that comes in with the constant regurgitation of events (the handling of Thatcher's hallucinations is clich&eacute;d and overused) made my eyes hurt from all the rolling they were doing.<br /><br />It feels weird to say that Lloyd should have called up Ron Howard for tips on how to build a coherent and engaging portrayal of mental illness, but she should have.<br /><br />The lack of emotional connect makes this a really shallow portrait of an important woman.  By film's end, we really don't learn anything about her.  Lloyd is so bent on portraying Thatcher's inability to let go of her late husband that she fails to build anything else, and she forgets to really color in WHY Thatcher can't let go.  The scenes with Streep and Broadbent don't paint Denis Thatcher as anything special or really allow them to build a relationship.  In fact, Thatcher is basically painted as a solitary entity the entire length of the film with no real emotional ties to anyone.  Her ambition drives her, but that is never truly explored, and I wouldn't have even took to that concept had Broadbent not shouted it at the camera in one particular scene.  Lloyd doesn't layer anything here.  She tries to pass off segues as complete thoughts (let's zoom in on a photograph and then show scene that has no tie to the last and then zoom out at an old woman staring blankly at a wall and call that depth) and it just doesn't work.<br /><br />Streep is a wonderful actress.  She can really do no wrong.  Her talent is non-negotiable and yet even she falls victim to Lloyd's horrendous grasp of the material.  By splicing the film in such a nonsensical manner, Lloyd has stripped Streep's performance of depth and meaning and merely presented us with a really good mimicry act, but nothing more.  Streep embodies Thatcher, but she doesn't tell us anything about her.<br /><br />Poor Viola Davis.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ01Q3070LT29.html">AQ01Q3070LT29</a><br/><p>Released December 30, 2011.

Running Time: 1 hour, 44 mins.<br />  The movie begins with Margaret Thatcher (Meryl Streep), in her life of retirement, is purchasing a pint of milk in a market and is surprised by the price of it. At home, she speaks with her husband Denis (Jim Broadbent) during breakfast, however, her husband passed away in 2003. She misses her husband so much, it gives her comfort to believe he is still there in her home. It's a way of trying to keep memories.

While Ms. Streep is her typical fantastic self, the film itself is a bizarre let down.  It starts in around 2008 and shows Ms. Thatcher in a semi-state of dementia.  She has visions of and converses with her dead husband Denis (Jim Broadbent).  Her past life is shown through a series of flashbacks.  The film spends too much time in the present showing her as a frail old woman fighting the demons in her mind then focusing on the potential powerful situations of her being the first woman to lead a country in the Western world. Mr. Broadbent plays his character like a complete loon and you can't understand why someone like that would haunt her mind. That being said, Ms. Streep inhabits the character and transforms herself into Margaret Thatcher completely.  While you can never argue when Ms. Streep wins an award, I thought she was much better in her three most recent nominated roles for Julie & Julia, Doubt and The Devil Wears Prada.  The film is worth watching strictly to see maybe the all-time greatest actresses in an Academy Award winning turn, but not much else.</p></br><a href="../users/A3QLAOOTFEHCJI.html">A3QLAOOTFEHCJI</a><br/><p>The same night I watched this movie I was channel flipping and came across "Out of Africa" from 1985.  It starred Meryl Streep and Robert Redford.  I'd seen the movie before but watched several minutes out of comparative curiosity.  Meryl plays a headstrong Danish baroness/plantation owner in colonial Kenya.  She speaks English with what appears to be a perfect Danish accent.  The woman is remarkable which is also the correct adjective for her role as British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher.  If not for her performance this film can easily be overlooked and would feel right at home on basic cable.<br /><br />While Thatcher's rise to power as the first woman prime minister is quite an accomplishment, it doesn't seem to be terribly interesting.  One of the problems is that the meat of her career doesn't begin until she's in her 20's.  There isn't much about her childhood.  All of this comes as the aging, depressed woman teeters on the edge of dementia.  It is those uncomfortable moments we get too much of.  Thatcher's life story would have played better with linear story telling but then we wouldn't have seen so much of the well done make-up artistry and Streep's well played old lady.  Was that the filmmaker's goal?<br /><br />It's too bad the story, style and script don't meet the standard established by Ms. Streep and the excellent video transfer.  Projected in a wide 2.35:1 aspect ratio in 1080p the film looks great.  Likewise the DTS-HD MA 5.1 is terrific.  Clear and perfectly situated.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AFXJ8U72MD6L.html">A1AFXJ8U72MD6L</a><br/><p>A nicely delivered even if not fully engaging tale about the life of Margaret Thatcher, former Prime Minister of Britain, which is mostly told through flashbacks in her old age as her memory begins to fail her. Meryl Streep, who played Thatcher, received Best Actress from the Academy Awards for this picture.<br /><br />About the only issue I had (and it's a big one) is that they tried to make it appear as if all of her victories didn't mean much in the end when they actually did. One could argue there was a liberal bias in this film that took a few opportunities to slam Thacher when they really weren't justified. Thatcher's children dubbed this film "a left-wing fantasy". Anybody who doesn't know what she did for Great Britain should educate themselves about the woman and no I'm not a conservative.<br /><br />The budget for this picture was $13M and it made over $114M at the Box Office.<br /><br />STORY/PLOTTING: B minus to B; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B to B plus; GOT THATCHER RIGHT: B minus; OVERALL GRADE: B minus to B; WHEN WATCHED: end of May 2012.</p></br><a href="../users/A36EW68H08UOCS.html">A36EW68H08UOCS</a><br/><p>Let me begin by saying that I think Meryl Streep is perhaps the most talented actress to EVER appear in films.  It is no coincidence that she has been nominated for Academy Awards and Golden Globes more often than any other person.<br /><br />That being said, "The Iron Lady" is neither a "crown jewel" nor a "feather in her cap."<br /><br />There must have been a powerful draw to portray Dame Margaret Thatcher, the first (and so far, only) female Prime Minister of Great Britain. But when I think of recent "real-life" biopics like "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001NMYZXM">Ray</a>" or "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003UESJH4">The King's Speech</a>" (or even "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VXGW2E">Julie & Julia</a>", which featured Streep as famed Chef Julia Child), "The Iron Lady" falls short.  Far short.<br /><br />The film is anchored in a recent time - with Mrs. Thatcher an old widow, at least a little demented and frequented by hallucinations of her dead husband, played by Jim Broadbent in maybe the film's best performance.  The rest of the film is told in clumsy flashbacks, but always returns to doddering old Maggie - Ms. Streep under an often distractingly bad pile of makeup.  Old Margaret shuffles around the house, looks confused, stares out the window, and absolutely sucks any life from the narrative.  (Here the fault lies not with Ms. Streep, but with the screenplay and direction.  And perhaps editor.  Was there no one putting the final product together who looked at "the forest" and noticed "hey... we've got about half of the running time devoted to old Margaret shuffling around, getting in and out of bed, etc.?")<br /><br />In REALLY brief don't-blink-or-you'll-miss-them flashbacks we see the Margaret who grows up the daughter of a grocer with a political bent, marries a young earnest man who sees that Margaret is determined to become the powerful half of a couple, has twins, runs for office, and is finally thrust forward as Leader of the Conservative Party and elected Prime Minister.<br /><br />In a good biopic (like last year's King's Speech) you get a good feel for not only the central figure, but also those surrounding.  In "The Iron Lady" I never felt any connection to anyone.  Other players, such as daughters, other members of Parliament or American Secretaries of State, show up long enough to be cast aside by the ambitious "Iron Lady".<br /><br />How I wish that this film had reached the scope of "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00190N4E4">Gandhi</a>" or the emotional depth of "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004SIP98S">The Queen</a>." The Mrs. and I agreed that it is likely that both Ms. Streep and Dame Thatcher herself are not pleased with the result.  We know we weren't - and it isn't OUR movie.<br /><br />Addendum: Last Sunday Meryl Streep and her make-up team both won Academy Awards for this film.  Neither of these facts change my opinion.  I read a post-Oscar article that suggested that the Make-up Award was given BECAUSE of Streep's performance.  Perhaps, but that being said, the Mrs. and I saw "J.Edgar" since I wrote my original review here - and the "old age makeup" for Leonardo DiCaprio was substantially more believable than what we saw in "The Iron Lady."  Again - my major beef for this film is not at all related to Ms. Streep's performance or to the makeup, but rather to the overall movie and the amount of time it devoted to depicting a very old and very demented Margaret Thatcher.  Because of the award, someone unfamiliar with Street's total body of work could be tempted to think this performance and film superior to The Deer Hunter, Out of Africa, Bridges of Madison County, Doubt, etc.  IMHO - this would be incorrect.</p></br><a href="../users/A1J03J0HZ7KU5T.html">A1J03J0HZ7KU5T</a><br/><p>One of the worst motion pictures to receive an Oscar of any kind. Meryl Streep's award-winning portrayal cannot save "The Iron Lady" (2011) from its bad filmmaking technique. Pretentiously directed, clumsily scripted and choppily edited, this cinematic travesty does a tremendous disservice to Margaret Thatcher and Streep's remarkable talents. A squandered opportunity to capture the life and times of Britain's first woman prime minister.</p></br><a href="../users/AFJFXN42RZ3G2.html">AFJFXN42RZ3G2</a><br/><p>Meryl Streep portrays the leading role of one of the most well known politicians of the most pivotal periods in history, the Cold War.  "Iron Lady" is a moving picture of England's most influential and at times controversial leaders Margaret Thatcher who fittingly inherits the name of being an "iron lady" with a domineering female presence amidst an environment of male counterparts.  The film depicts her rise as a young politician that weaves within a collage of memories of her personal and professional life.<br /><br />The movie is somewhat of a love play of Thatcher's career but most of all her love for her husband Denis Thatcher (Jim Broadbent) and family, especially her daughter Carole (Olivia Colman) and though not shown within the film except in flashbacks her absent son Matthew.  During the opening scenes of the film, one must orient one's self with what exactly is happening in the kitchen between Thatcher and her husband.  This is a moment in Thatcher's life as well as one of the focal points of the storyline of the film depicting her twilight years.  Director Phylla Lord and Writer Abi Morgan do a good job interplaying the film's storylines of the life of Margaret Thatcher.  There are moments in the film that may take time to understand amidst the history that most know of Thatcher during the Reagan Years and her personal life that only now, unless one has followed every point of her life, the film sheds a light upon.  While watching the film, viewers may think of other biopics that take an extremely intimate approach towards showing the humanistic aspects of almost larger than life figures.  There are qualities of the film that bears similarities to the film "Iris" or "The King's Speech," each depicting notable figures in English history.<br /><br />But what one may come out of watching the film despite parallels with other biopics, it is an interesting movie that takes an unpredictable approach to delving into the life of a woman that made an enormous impact to the world during the most tumultuous times in twentieth century history.  This film is much recommended for the history aficionado or anyone who has the curiosity to understand influential people that have made a difference.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X1CEGHTHMBL1.html">A1X1CEGHTHMBL1</a><br/><p>Margret Thatcher (Meryl Streep) is in the final years of her life. She suffers from dementia and often carries on conversations with her husband who has been dead for 8 years. She has many flashbacks to her younger years when she went to Oxford University and had a desire to go into politics. She was the daughter of a grocer who was also the mayor in the town in which they lived.<br /><br />She had a hard and focused personality but she has declined to the point where she needs constant care, supervision and protection. Her political successes came as she won three elections for Prime Minister of England and the leader of the Conservative Party for over 11 years......<br /><br />This movie has a major asset, the acting of Meryl Streep, who once again proves that she is possibly the best character actor of all time. Beyond her amazing performance this movie suffers for many reasons. Hollywood likes to take pot shots at leaders and this is no different. Margret Thatcher hated Socialism and Communism and fought to keep England a democratic and market driven country thriving on the intellect and inventiveness of its people. In the movie she is vilified (as she was during her career) but unfortunately this movie only seems to focus on vilifying her and illustrating her Alzheimer's and dementia.<br /><br />The most powerful women in political history also had as many admirers as those who hated her policies. She broke the unions and fought the government from printing money just to be more socialistic. The unions wanted a 30% pay increase. England was going into debt and high inflation was rampant. She helped lead them back to stability and financial security. She believed in taking action and fighting for what was right. She wanted to do something to make the world better rather than just trying to be someone.<br /><br />This movie was focused on belittling Margret Thatcher and depicting her as an old lady severely ill and as a bully when she was Prime Minister. Over 50% of the film was focused on her dementia instead of the powerful influence she had on the world. She was one of the leaders who helped stop the cold war with Russia but this topic was hardly even touched!<br /><br />The acting of Meryl Streep was superb but the script and story line was shameful. Hollywood does it again! This movie is not worth seeing for the story but the acting of Streep is the hook that will make you want to see it!</p></br><a href="../users/AV6QDP8Q0ONK4.html">AV6QDP8Q0ONK4</a><br/><p>It seems we can't just can't have a normal biographical movie anymore without flashbacks. The flashback style is done for the purpose of showing us how events in someone's past effected their later decisions. Seeing the retired senile Margaret Thatcher was really unnecessary to this film. Can you imagine a Reagan biography starting out with a senile Reagan not knowing he is no longer president and talking to dead people? Unfortunately the senility scenes are needed so we can get to know the character of Marget Thatcher because the main biography part is poorly done with an over abundance of "red meat" sound bites.<br /><br />To make matters worse, the film then employs this technique during the flashback so there is a flashback within the flashback.<br /><br />I liked the young Margaret Roberts (Alexandra Roach) growing up in a man's world where the expectations of women were to stay out of business and politics. Her bucking the system was inspirational and it would have been a better film had we seen more of this and less of Margaret thinking her husband was still alive.<br /><br />The meat of the film picks up when she is the Education Secretary of the conservative party. England is facing a union strike crippling the nation. Marget doesn't like her party's leadership and decides to run for the leader of the Conservative Party. She correctly places herself in the hands of professions who tweak her for national appeal, including working on her shrill voice...but she keeps the pearls.<br /><br />The movie relates to today. England was in a recession and people couldn't pay their mortgage. Margret wanted to cut government spending in the midst of a recession contrary to everyone else, including her own party who worries about re-election. I expected to see a "Paid for by Ron Paul" after that speech.<br /><br />For me, the film becomes watchable when Thatcher has to weigh her decision to go to war over the Falkland Islands. Streep gives us some wonderful performances. But when I see Matthew Marsh miscast as Alexander Haig, I have to ask, "What were they thinking?"<br /><br />I went into this film thinking "5 stars" but reality set in as they killed this film on the editing floor. Horrifically edited and badly written. Whose idea was it really to have Streep walk around in an old house coat with messed up hair looking acting like Edith Bunker? The scenes of Streep moving through a crowd of faces, speaking her thoughts was another idea that failed. The soundtrack during the file footage scenes was terrible. Streep had a few strong scenes, but not enough to save this film. My advice: read the book.<br /><br />No f-bombs, no sex, brief nudity on file footage.</p></br><a href="../users/A2DAHERP7HYJGO.html">A2DAHERP7HYJGO</a><br/><p>For a film called THE IRON LADY this movie was felt more like it was formed from Reynold's wrap. But what else would you expect in a movie made about a Conservative woman by a group of Liberal die hards? Its difficult not to bring politics into a film of this nature since the centerpiece is a politician. But when all that's offered is a one sided description how can you not?<br /><br />For those who are confused while watching a film that jumps back and forth in time then stop reading and forget this movie. It does that from start to finish and not very well. The object of the movie, the Iron Lady in question, is ex-British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, portrayed here by Meryl Streep in an Oscar winning performance. Just another example of why the Oscars mean so little these days.<br /><br />The film opens with Thatcher in her later years post PM status and after the death of her beloved husband Dennis (Jim Broadbent). At this time Thatcher was dealing with the impending onset of Alzheimer's as well as the loss of the man she so desperately cared for. We watch as she attempts to force herself to part with those things left behind, clothes and the like. And while she does, so various items and things around her home lead her to remember her past.<br /><br />We get glimpses of young Margaret as she works in her father's store while the other girls walk past. We she her listening and being influenced by her father's speeches to the locals touting the value of a solid business front not willing to cower to the Nazis as they attempt to bomb the country and force the people into hiding. These are the ideas that formed the basis for her beliefs but they are given short time here.<br /><br />Flash forward as Margaret deals with her daughter or perhaps the other way round. We see her getting ready for a dinner with friends where her opinions are asked but she seems buried in the past and her guests seem more embarrassed than pleased to hear her views. Her daughter acts the same.<br /><br />Back in time we see how Margaret meets Dennis but not how they fell in love. Margaret decides to take on the establishment and become a female member of Parliament. Her struggles in the face of chauvinism can be seen here with a touch of the problems she faced but more in focus as to the differences in clothing choices, a bright blue dress among a sea of black suits.  Then back to her slow slide into dementia.<br /><br />The important historic moments in Thatcher's life are touched on but very lightly. Incidents like the Falkland War and the miner's strike feel like they are mentioned without any depth to them. Other items like the Iran hostage situation are ignored completely. With the amount of story involved in Thatcher's life I was left wondering why the film makers here decided that her illness seemed the most interesting part of her life instead of those more interesting historical moments. Then again when thinking about Hollywood's depiction of Conservative figures I recalled the attempt to make Ronald Reagan look senile and mentally ill as well. The friendship between Reagan and Thatcher is barely touched on in this film.<br /><br />Streep won the Oscar for best actress for her performance here. I am at a loss as to understand why with the exception of the fact that she is Hollywood royalty and is nominated for anything she does these days. I saw little acting here and more impersonation. If that's all it takes to win an Oscar then Rich Little should have had an entire shelf lined with the trophies. I will admit that I've never been a Streep fan up front but this movie did little to change my mind.<br /><br />It would be nice if folks in Hollywood would take a historical topic and present the facts untarnished by their own viewpoints when making the film. I have little doubt that there were bad things about Thatcher but there were good as well. A movie that would choose to present both sides and let the viewer decide would have been interesting. This movie did little but make you wonder how she stayed PM for 11 years. Then again the movie also made you wonder about her sanity the longer you watched.<br /><br />To capture an entire life in 105 minutes is difficult at best. To present it accurately and fairly even more so. Some may watch this film and think they've learned about Margaret Thatcher. It only made me want to look deeper into her life as this felt more like fluff than biographical film. The only good thing this movie presented was the love and adoration Thatcher felt for her husband. Even a story revolving solely around that would have made a better film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZHSORK1HHYTT.html">A2ZHSORK1HHYTT</a><br/><p>I am sorry, I really wanted to like this film.

If ever an Academy Award was given to the right person, this was the time - Streep absolutely clones her mannerisms, speech inflections and style in a way I've never seen anyone else come close. But besides the outstanding performance, the script is somewhat lackluster, deciding to take the career of one of the most iconic people of the century and focus on the least interesting parts.<br /><br />It's not that the script itself is terrible - it's better than many films I've seen in the last 12 months. It's more that it feels like a missed opportunity since there are dozens of events that could have been drawn upon to make a more interesting film. In making a movie that's essentially about isolation and loneliness, it fails to capture the sheer passion and depth of feeling - both positive and negative - that the average Briton had for Mrs Thatcher.<br /><br />Overall, I'd still recommend the film to people who are interested in the former Prime Minister but be prepared for watching something that's very small scale given the grandness of the times when she was in power.</p></br><a href="../users/A2W00XKTTF1G0Z.html">A2W00XKTTF1G0Z</a><br/><p>MOVIE REVIEW #30  (DVD): " The Iron Lady "<br /><br />Meryl Streep having been nominated for an Academy Award 17 times and winning 3, this movie being her third win for playing the Historic figure, Margaret Thatcher! Her performance is amazing. It's detailed and extremely subtle. Broadly gentle and very honest in what ends up being the end of her life. I understand why she was nominated and why she won! With the make-up, movements and emotion...she was Margaret Thatcher.<br /><br />However, Director Phyllidia Lloyd may not have the chops this type of drama film. It was slow to start and has the style of seeing the legendary English leader going through her daily routine as an elderly, dementia stricken woman - by going back and forth with flashbacks brought on by her old pics, memorabilia, news clippings and even clothing. Director Lloyd did a much better job directing Mama Mia.  The fast paced, toe-tapping, gotta-sing-along, movie musical with the ABBA soundtrack!<br /><br />What makes this movie passable and worth waiting for is the performances; once you get to them! Thatcher's husband Denis, played humorously by the brilliant Jim Broadbent (Harry Potter, Moulin Rouge, Indiana Jones) makes their partnership - both in life and death extremely heartfelt.<br /><br />Other amazing performances included those by Anthony Head (Merlin, Buffy The vampire Slayer) who was the Parliament President and that of Richard E. Grant (Bram Stoker's Dracula, Corpse Bride) who played Parliament's lead man. The two against Meryl were engaging to say the least.<br /><br />Overall the screenplay, written by Abi Morgan (from British TV) like the film, is a little slow handed. The pieces of controversy over English issues with her people and the Falkland Islands became great dialogue scenes with anger, frustration and why Thatcher was coined `The Iron Lady' by the Russians. If anything the performances and inside view of history that Margaret Thatcher made, make this film worth watching. I can see why she won the Oscar and the other performances were nominated....but I can also see why the rest of the picture wasn't nominated as film overall. Meryl is definitely worth it as is the rest of the cast. There is a great ensemble of actors in this film.....just takes a little while to get to those scenes!</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>I think Streep is fantastic in the Thatcher role and probably in line for an Oscar.  However her performance alone can not raise this movie to 5 stars.  The movie takes place with Thatcher at the end of her life suffering dementia and hallucinations and through flashbacks we learn her life story.  I found the pace to be slow, and the whole thing a bit sad.  Whether you like her policies or not, Thatcher was an incredibly strong woman and politician and I wish the story had focused more on that.  Starting everyone from the saddest point of her life dampened my enthusiasm for the movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2XRZV63X79YSJ.html">A2XRZV63X79YSJ</a><br/><p>Even though Margaret Thatcher was Prime Minister when I was in my 20's, politically, I really did not know what made her tick.  Unfortunately, this film does little to answer my questions (and I assume many of the questions asked by many of its viewers.)<br /><br />What the film does is spend a lot of time on her declining years and her dimetenia.  As for Meryl Streep, she gives a fine perfomance that is hampered by the final cut.  Did she deserve an Oscar nomination, maybe.  Did she deserve to win, definitely not.  As for the make-up, as young Margaret, Meryl looks nothing like her.  She is too beautiful.  I guess vanity would not let her be made down to look like an average woman.  But the old age make-up is fantastic.  Unfortunately, between the two, the old age is easier to accomplish and therefore less important.<br /><br />The worst part of the film, is that it never trusts itself.  It uses gimmicks to tell the story.  While there has been many films that have successfully used flashback to tell a story, this film uses it to disguise the film's shortcummings.<br /><br />I guess I will have to wait for Masterpiece Theatre to do a story on Maggie to get a full understanding of her inner mind.</p></br><a href="../users/A3QH6BEY6RYQR0.html">A3QH6BEY6RYQR0</a><br/><p>The story of Margaret Thatcher, the first woman elected Prime Minister of England. The movie begins with her later years suffering from Alzheimer's and flashes back to her early days as a young woman and her time in office. The movie only provides a snapshot of who she is, and perhaps could have focused less on her current condition, and given more weight to her rise from an eager young woman to the leadership of Great Britain. The primary reason to see this one is for one of the great performance by Meryl Streep. The iconic actress is at her finest, and successfully delves into the role, transforming herself into "The Iron Lady." If you enjoy great acting, this is a good one to see.</p></br><a href="../users/AG8U6F6226GBZ.html">AG8U6F6226GBZ</a><br/><p>I bought this movie before reading the reviews.  Big mistake.  I heard it was so good, and Meryl Streep always is, but not in this kind of film.  I watched for the first 20 minutes, maybe less, and came to the computer to read the reviews.  Was it me?  At first I couldn't figure out what was going on, but after a short while I realized they were doing re-runs of her life through a woman aging with dementia.  My mother suffered from Alzheimer's and I didn't want to watch it all over again.  It's a horror.  I will not watch the rest of this film. After reading the reviews, I realized that many other reviews were not good, and though it's Meryl Streep, and she's a great actress, it didn't help. I've recently purchased two DVD's with her in it,Julie and Julia and The Devil Wears Prada, I loved them both. Watched them many times.  She's great in both. The films are uplifting and enjoyable.  We all have enough of our own problems to watch something as awful as this. I hated Doubt as well, but at least I could watch it.  I guess I'm not interested in horror films.  That was what this film seemed to be moving into. Well, that's all I have to write.  I will probably never watch the rest, but I don't think I'll be missing anything.  Why didn't they make a film about the high points of her life and career? That's what I thought it would be.  Who knows?  Good advice.  Read these reviews before you purchase any films.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GCHG6U8HTVIT.html">A2GCHG6U8HTVIT</a><br/><p>Half of this look at Margaret Thatcher's life is engrossing. Half is slow going. Without Meryl Streep's performance as Thatcher, this movie would never have reached take-off speed.<br /><br />The engrossing part gives us Thatcher's determination to make a difference, to gain power as a woman playing what had been a man's game, and to use power with supreme confidence. We're given all too brief looks at her decision-making process as prime minister, her deliberate steps to scale back the welfare state Britain had become, her cool facing down the coal miners and her refusal to do anything but fight vigorously to re-claim the Falklands. When she says "Sink it!" regarding the Argentine ship the Belgrano, there's no doubt about the quality of steel in her spine. Her domination of her cabinet ministers is so amusing a person is glad he's not one of them.<br /><br />The slow going is due to all the time spent reminiscing (this is the frame of the movie) in old age as she sinks into dementia. Sad but true that Margaret Thatcher's rise to power and her years as prime minister are fascinating. Margaret Thatcher as wife, mother and in old age isn't.<br /><br />For a pungent view of life with Thatcher, you won't do better than to read Alan Clarke's three-volume diary. He was one of her ministers. For well-written, entertaining gossip, shrewd observations and satisfying irony about high-placed Brits, particularly in politics, the arts and government, Harold Nicolson's diaries, 1907 to 1963, should not be missed.</p></br><a href="../users/ATHTCOG6BB6WK.html">ATHTCOG6BB6WK</a><br/><p>Mery Streep gives an awesome performance as usual in this film. In Iron Lady, former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher is an elderly woman who suffers with dimentia. In her mental state, she frequently converses with her beloved deceased husband when no one is nearby to overhear. The movie flashes back and forth from present day to earlier times and touches on her personal life as well as her political ambitions. Scenes from her formative years as the daughter of a grocer give glimpses into the formation of her political thought. It was in this environment that she learned firsthand the value of a hard earned dollar. No doubt, that life experience contributed to her grit as an adult. The movie may be lackluster for some but I enjoyed seeing the old girl again via Meryl Streep.</p></br><a href="../users/A1XT8AJB7S9JJG.html">A1XT8AJB7S9JJG</a><br/><p>IRON LADY - Starring Meryl Streep & Jim Broadbent - Rated PG-13<br /><br />"Watch your character, for it becomes your destiny. What we think we become." A look at the life of Margaret Thatcher, the first and only female Prime Minister of England. This movie covers from her acceptance to Oxford up to present day. Being a huge history buff I was looking forward to this movie. Growing up in the 80's I remember quite a bit about Thatcher and was hoping to see stuff that I knew already and events to help me fill in the gaps of things I didn't. While this is a good movie overall I was very disappointed. The movie pretty much deals with how she handles her husbands death with bits of flashbacks thrown in. It does cover a fair amount of her time as leader but really only covers how she decided to run, trying to get back the Faulking Islands and her resignation. I was surprised there wasn't more Cold War events as well as her dealings with Reagan. I will admit that Meryl Streep was amazing in this movie and did deserve the Oscar, but I am glad the movie wasn't up for best picture. Even for a history buff like me this was a little boring. Overall, a good movie but I was hoping for more events of when she was Prime Minister. I give it a B.</p></br><a href="../users/A2E0EZ8DO5YSU3.html">A2E0EZ8DO5YSU3</a><br/><p>I assumed this would be the story of the political career of England's first woman prime minister.  It did tell that story indirectly through flashbacks, but the main focus is Margaret Thatcher in old age, suffering from senile dementia.  That is also a powerful and moving story.  Meryl Streep's performance is amazing.</p></br><a href="../users/A16GAIJJE39T1S.html">A16GAIJJE39T1S</a><br/><p>This film is plotted from a retrospective point of view--from that of Margaret Thatcher as an elderly widow suffering from dementia.  Photographs, music, and TV programs serve to remind the declining old woman of her younger years and her glory days of Prime Minister.  Unfortunately this plotting device devotes too much time to her hallucinations--going through the same sort of imaginings again and again--especially those in which she conjures up the presence of her late husband.  This time would have been better spent on detailing her personal life and work in Parliament and as Prime Minister--or even her younger days as a shopkeepers daughter.  They also would have done well to show her interacting with her friend "Ronny" Reagan--an aspect of her tenure as PM that seems to have been all but forgotten here.<br /><br />Despite this awkward and tedious retrospective framework, this movie has moments that shine--for which we can thank consummate actress Meryl Streep.  I especially enjoyed the part where she acts on the advice of her political advisers and works to remake herself into someone who the voters can better respond to, and who they could imagine as Prime Minister.  The elocution lessons in which she is taught to speak in the grand way that Brits has come to expect from their leaders is hilarious!</p></br><a href="../users/A27H9DOUGY9FOS.html">A27H9DOUGY9FOS</a><br/><p>Love her or loathe her, there is no denying that Margaret Thatcher is a subject worthy of a grand bio-pic treatment. She is a one-of-a-kind historical figure and her story is both epic and controversial. Hearing that one of the screen's living legends, Meryl Streep, was going to take on this complicated and powerful woman: it was like a dream pairing! So much story to tell! And yet, in a bizarre choice, the screenplay of "The Iron Lady" tells us almost nothing. At best, I thought the film had the potential to really dig into the heart of what made Thatcher tick. At worst, I thought the film might be a Cliff's Notes journey through the highs and lows of Thatcher's reign. And yet, for me, there is so little actual content that I'm absolutely speechless. Nothing is put into context. This gives you almost no idea of Thatcher's career, her family life, her politics, or England's history. Instead, the movie focuses on a retired Thatcher speaking to her deceased husband (an always welcome Jim Broadbent) and reflecting back at random moments in her life. I have NEVER seen a biographical movie that has left me so unconnected with ANYTHING having to do with its subject matter! I know that's a big statement, but absolutely how I feel.<br /><br />I remember all the previews of "The Iron Lady" with Streep really burning up the screen. When Streep faces down her adversaries in those previews and proclaims that she's had to fight every day of her life, it's a sweepingly dramatic moment. When that scene finally appears in the movie, I literally laughed out loud. Why? Because up to that point, the film had shown us nothing to make me believe it was true. We never know how Thatcher started in politics, how or why she achieved early success, how she was even considered for higher positioning, or anything at all that made her noteworthy as an up-and-coming political figure. Instead, the most background we get is that she's a shopkeeper's daughter. Then how did she get involved in politics? At one point, many years into her reign as Prime Minister, her closest advisors (and they are all interchangeable without one second's thought to developing them as characters) sneer that she's just the aforementioned "shopkeeper's daughter" in her presence. Really? It's patently absurd. She's one of the most powerful women in the world at this point with decades of leadership under her. Years fly by, sometimes people like Thatcher, sometimes they don't. You can't really care, because the screenplay is so thin. The only historical moment that gets the least bit of explanation or screen time is the Falkland Islands.<br /><br />Streep, though, does an uncanny impersonation. Oh, the movie that could have been made! She picked up her third Oscar (the first since 1982's Sophie's Choice, WOW!) and her make-up man received a golden statuette as well. But rarely has such greatness been expended for so little pay-off. I feel like I am exactly the target audience for "The Iron Lady" and I was so frustrated by its presentation. In all truth, I'd give this picture only one star for missing everything that made Thatcher such a noteworthy historical leader. But for Streep and Broadbent, I'll add one. An enormous missed opportunity! KGHarris, 4/12.</p></br><a href="../users/A13E0ARAXI6KJW.html">A13E0ARAXI6KJW</a><br/><p>That Meryl Streep would be brilliant in her portrayal of Margaret Thatcher is a given and should be enough to justify a film's existence, but this sympathetic 2011 historical biopic does not give the actress enough to work with in what amounts to a charitable and cursory view of a controversial figure. Director Phyllida Lloyd had directed Streep in one of her lighter recent efforts, 2008's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GKJ2DY">Mamma Mia!</a>, where caricature and fleet footing worked together to keep the bouncy ABBA-penned score from touching ground. This time, however, a more definitive grounding would have been beneficial to provide Thatcher's story with much-needed perspective. Unfortunately, screenwriter Abi Morgan's (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007FXLZ9K">Shame</a>) episodic patchwork of a script takes no sides in presenting the life and career of one of the most influential world leaders of the 20th century. Instead, amid moments of genuine poignancy, her story is tethered to the ravages of old age and the onset of dementia, presenting the still-living Thatcher as an almost Dickensian character dependent on the ghost of her eccentric late husband Denis for personal support.<br /><br />In fact, the film opens circa 2008 with Thatcher in a semi-senile state venturing out to buy milk at a local convenience store. Even though she is immersed in imaginary conversations with Denis, she is preparing to dispose of his clothes eight years after his death at the behest of her daughter Carol. After this lengthy introductory sequence, the story starts to traverse back and forth between extended flashbacks and her present-day solitude. We see her as the devoted daughter of a Grantham grocer, worshipful of her father but distant from her mother as Thatcher takes an interest in national politics starting at the lowest rungs of the Conservative party. From these early-day scenes, it's difficult to tell how or why she climbed to the top of the party because there is barely a glimmer of the ruthless ambition and savvy positioning that must have been Thatcher's forte to get ahead. Instead, we get the Cliff's Notes version that cuts to the high points of her career, so significant turning points come across as little more than a dramatic checklist.<br /><br />Running a blessedly brief 105 minutes, the film tackles in quick succession her Conservative stand at Parliament, her pointed challenge to Edward Heath for leadership of the party, her unfettered decision to send troops to defend the Falkland Islands, and her forced resignation in the face of hubris and waning popularity. Interspersed throughout is archival footage of the real Thatcher (with her face hidden, of course) during her twelve years as Prime Minister, the longest of any in the last century. Had Lloyd and Morgan reined in the breadth of Thatcher's life and zeroed in on a defining moment like the Falkland Islands war, the film would have been more dramatically effective in revealing the true figure. There is, however, no faulting Streep (with seamless assistance from her long-time make-up assistant J. Roy Helland) whose uncanny resemblance and authoritative performance commands attention most willingly. The surrounding cast barely has time to make any vivid impressions with the exceptions of Jim Broadbent's (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000067J3R">Iris</a>) sprightly, familiar turn as Denis and Alexandra Roach's wide-eyed impersonation of the younger Margaret. Otherwise, the pacing feels off due to Justine Wright's choppy editing and Elliot Davis' overly artful camera angles. See it purely for Streep's artistry.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>That THE IRON LADY ultimately fails as a great movie is puzzling.  Despite the great performance by Meryl Streep portraying the larger than life Margaret Thatcher, one of the most important political players of the 20th century, the story remains spotty and unsatisfying despite evidence that it is trying so very hard. Abi Morgan is responsible for the screenplay that does indeed offer individual scenes with touch moments but lets the overall sweep of the film in tatters.  Phyllida Law directs.<br /><br />For reference, `Margaret Hilda Thatcher, Baroness Thatcher, LG, OM, PC, FRS, n&eacute;e Roberts (born 13 October 1925) is a British politician and the longest-serving (1979-1990) British prime minister of the 20th century, and the only woman ever to have held the post. A Soviet journalist nicknamed her the "Iron Lady", which later became associated with her uncompromising policies. As prime minister, she implemented conservative policies that have come to be known as Thatcherism.'  Where the film take us is to view Thatcher (Meryl Streep) as elderly and a virtual prisoner in her own home due to her concerned staff and daughter Carol (Olivia Colman). She looks back on her life as she clears out her late husband Denis's (Jim Broadbent) clothes for the Oxfam shop. Denis is seen as being her rock as she first enters parliament and then runs for the leadership of the Conservative Party, culminating in her eventual premeireship. Now his ghost joins her to comment on her successes and failures, sometimes to her annoyance, generally to her comfort until ultimately, as the clothes are sent to the charity shop, Denis departs from Margaret's life forever.<br /><br />Streep's ability to convey the mental deterioration of this lady is a triumph of moderation: she never imitates Alzheimer's disease but instead allows us to view senility in a new way. The cast is large and there are some good performances by some of England's finest actors.  But somehow the events during Thatcher's rise to the role as England's first woman Prime Minister and all the events (Falkland war, fall of the Berlin wall, etc) just seem like addenda.  Even the usual fine music composer Thomas Newman fails in his task to create a memorable score (except for the inclusion of Maria Callas singing `Casta diva' from Bellini's `Norma' and excerpts of Bach from the Well Tempered Clavier). It is a showcase for Meryl Streep and she handles her end of the project well indeed.

In The Iron Lady, Meryl Streep plays former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher with the same chameleonic grace she harnessed for her portrayal of Julia Child in 2009's Julie & Julia. Told primarily in flashback, Phyllida Lloyd's portrait begins in Thatcher's youth, then traces her rise to power and chronicles her involvement in certain key historical events. To get a sense of my opinion of the film, consider the following: Lloyd's only other feature directorial effort, 2008's ABBA-themed musical Mamma Mia, is actually better The Iron Lady, but for her work on the latter, Streep took home Best Actress honors from the Golden Globes, the BAFTAs, and the Academy Awards. In other words, The Iron Lady is worth seeing for the acting alone.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KMG1AIUS00DC.html">A1KMG1AIUS00DC</a><br/><p>"The Iron Lady"  is the story of the political rise and fall of Margaret Thatcher (Meryl Streep) from her modest early years as a clerk in her parents' grocery shop to prime minister of Great Britain.  As with many screen biographies, the movie touches on career high points and, in the interest of maintaining a reasonable running time, either encapsulates or sidesteps the rest.<br /><br />The story unfolds from the present day as Thatcher recalls episodes from her past, with Alexandra Roach as the young Margaret, and her often tempestuous tenure as prime minister, the film's most interesting.  We see Thatcher's rise to prominence in Parliament even as she is ridiculed as both a woman and a newcomer who dares to challenge seasoned members of that body.  She seeks the advice of image shapers who suggest ways to command the respect of her peers and their serious attention.  These include a new hairdo, a deeper speaking voice, and the abandonment of hats.<br /><br />Traditional make-up, hair styling, prosthetics, and contact lenses contribute to an often uncanny likeness between star and real-life stateswoman.<br /><br />Streep's performance is extraordinary and won her her third Oscar.  However, the film itself is kind of old-fashioned in its depiction of Thatcher as stalwart world leader.  We see her triumphs and her modest beginnings, yet there is a sense that we've never really gotten insight into the woman.<br /><br />Blu-ray extras include a making-of documentary and featurettes on Thatcher's husband, Denis; the film's costume design; Thatcher's battle in the House of Commons; and transforming Streep into Margaret Thatcher.  The movie is also available on DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/A17LEYMZI8OYOQ.html">A17LEYMZI8OYOQ</a><br/><p>Meryl Streep certainly deserved the Best Actress Oscar for her remarkable performance as former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in THE IRON LADY, as did make-up artists Mark Coulier and J. Roy Helland for their work on the production.  Indeed, when she is playing the elderly Thatcher, if you didn't know that was Meryl Streep up on the screen, you wouldn't know that was Meryl Streep up on the screen.<br /><br />Sadly, Streep's performance is really the only reason the see this 2011release, because the movie itself is rather dull.<br /><br />The problem lies in its approach to the material.  The story is told in flashbacks, which can often work, but in this instance director Phyllida Lloyd and screenwriter Abi Morgan have chosen to spend far more screen time with the aged, delusional Thatcher ,  having conversations with her late husband (Jim Broadbent), rather than focusing on her political career, which would have been far more interesting.<br /><br />Broadbent and all of the other actors, particularly Alexandra Roach and Harry Lloyd, playing the younger versions of Streep and Broadbent, are exceptional, but a film that prefers to concentrate on the framing story undercuts them all.<br /><br />I would have liked to have learned a lot more about Margaret Thatcher than I did from this picture.<br /><br />THE IRON LADY has been released in a 3-disc Blu-Ray Combo Pack from Anchor Bay Entertainment.

I'll make this review short and sweet:  forget the politics and forget the pro / con arguments regarding the "accuracy" of this movie.  Yes, those are important things for a movie that deals with someone's life.  But the overwhelming issue with this movie is even more basic;  it's just a dreadfully boring movie.  Furthermore, this lamest of movies is exacerbated by the terrible method of film making (at least in this case) where the scenes go from the present (ie demented state) to the past.<br />2.  Bottomline:  to all potential folks interested in watching this movie (and it doesn't matter if your liberal, conservative or unclear), just do yourself a huge favor and bypass this movie because it's just simply boring and semi-confused.</p></br><a href="../users/A2809U2S14N0K1.html">A2809U2S14N0K1</a><br/><p>The story let it down somewhat.  I thought a much better job could be done of Thatcher's life. Many of the important moments in her life were almost missed concentrating on trivial. Still it did keep my interest up throughout.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the characters were not properly developed in the movie. Many appeared very superficial.<br /><br />However, the acting was excellent, Meryl Streep performance was extremely good. As were most of the other actors.<br /><br />What I thought was brilliant was the makeup, they used on Maryl Streep. The way they could  make her look older and younger. I was very impressed with that.</p></br><a href="../users/A126KX6FVI4T66.html">A126KX6FVI4T66</a><br/><p>I was lucky enough to get this movie<br />as one of my Amazon Vine reviews.<br />Now, I'm faced with reviewing<br />what I can only call:<br />"The Wicked Witch is dead"...?<br />They make a lot about her "The Baroness"<br />having dementia in her old age.<br />I can only be ashamed of a liberal<br />community that would rejoice at her<br />medical problems in old age.<br />Good acting can't make up for bad biography?</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER5AYS3FQ9O3.html">A1ER5AYS3FQ9O3</a><br/><p>While I deeply wanted to love this movie, I instead felt mostly ambivalent about it.  Margaret Thatcher's younger self alternates with a portrait of her as dementia sets in (this is no spoiler but clear nearly from the outset of the film).<br /><br />This contrast of past and present can be effective - but not in this film. Streep musters on gamely and evokes Thatcher's character as much as possible within the limits of the script. I was frankly puzzled by how much of the film focused on Thatcher's decline and confusion rather than her most powerful moments in history. It seemed a waste.<br /><br />This isn't an absolute wreck of a film. Certain moments ring true. When Thatcher becomes prime minister  and walks through a sea of men, one feels for Thatcher. Streep conveys Thatcher's resolute nature and presence and her uncertainty about her chances of becoming prime minister. She has to be convinced this is actually possible when her stated goal is only to shake up things. .<br /><br />The movie is unfortunately quite slow and feels like a dull documentary instead of the riveting historical account it could have been. As my son and I watched it, he got very little feel for the history of the time and was left mostly with the impression of a confused older woman who had fleeting memories from her past.</p></br><a href="../users/AW3VZ5O895LRK.html">AW3VZ5O895LRK</a><br/><p>Meryl Streep and Jim Broadbent do the formidable job I would expect them to deliver as the Thatchers.  Margaret Thatcher was prime minister of the UK during the Reagan Era.  Streep captures her flawlessly.  I have lost count of how many biographical figures she has brought to life.  The last one I saw was of her as Julia Child and she was just as convincing.<br /><br />A good part of this movie is taken up with Thatcher's having dementia in her latest years.  Her husband has been dead for awhile of cancer but she carries on conversations with him constantly.  We cut back and forth in time to see her earliest years as a shop girl in her family's grocery to her beginnings in politics to her beginning as a member of Parliament.<br /><br />She is as conservative as Reagan was so was perfect for her era.  Although I personally don't care for her political persuasions, she was probably in the right place at the right time.<br /><br />Some viewers may be upset with the emphasis on the dementia part of her life along with the hallucinatory conversations with Broadbent.  However, having had family members with this disease, I actually found that aspect more interesting than the politics.<br /><br />It is a good film with excellent performances by two old pros.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GPEV42IO41CI.html">A2GPEV42IO41CI</a><br/><p>Meryl Streep stars in this biopic of Margaret Thatcher as the elderly lady, suffering from dementia, remembers key moments of her past.  We see young Margaret in her first political campaign, as she meets her beloved husband (later played by Jim Broadbent), and her eleven years as Prime Minister with its struggles and triumphs; but mostly, we see her deteriorating health and increasing frailty.<br /><br />I was absolutely stunned by Streep's impersonation of Thatcher; aided by incredibly believable make-up, she looks and sounds just like her and gives a thrilling performance.  It is an example of the finest acting and I'm glad she was rewarded with an Oscar, but I wish the role had been played by a British actress instead.  Jim Broadbent, as Denis Thatcher, plays his usual, jovial character and, while very likable, reminded me of silly Horace Slughorn from `Harry Potter.'<br /><br />The script was underwhelming in scenes depicting Thatcher's public life, but it was excellent in the very moving scenes of her current life as a delicate, rather pathetic, old lady.  All in all, I enjoyed it but think it could have been better.</p></br><a href="../users/ASEBX8TBYWQWA.html">ASEBX8TBYWQWA</a><br/><p>Read all the reviews of this film (there are 127 here already on Amazon - focusing on the film as shown in theaters. ALL of them focus on Meryl Streep and here Oscar-winning performance. I have to agree that she is an amazing actress and really inhabits the character of Margaret Thatcher in this film. But the production as a whole seems to last for three hours when, in fact, it is only 105 minutes. The reason is the concept used by Director Phyllidia Lloyd that has the time frame jumping back and forth (AND back and forth, and...) between Thatcher in her final days and at various points in her career. There is the conceit that has her late husband (and childhood sweetheart) Denis, appearing in her mind (and on screen) to converse with her, long after he has died. Personally I was getting a headache with all this time shifting. So, as a film, this only gets three stars from me.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray DVD - and I think the standard DVD - has a large group of special features, though many are short and one is really odd. They consist of:<br /><br />Making the Iron Lady - 12 minutes - the standard "making of" featurette with the cast and crew making comments among scenes repeated from the film.<br /><br />Recreating the young Margaret Thatcher - 3 minutes<br /><br />Denis, The Man Behind the woman - 2 ? minutes - focusing on Jim Broadbent's character<br /><br />Battle in the House of Commons -2 ? minutes - mostly comments by the Director (and some repeats section from the "Making of" one<br /><br />Costume Design: Pearls and Power Suits - 2 ? minutes - comments from the costume designer and Director<br /><br />And the odd one: an 18-minute "featurette" on Historical film bios, that - while interesting - is a promo piece for other recent DVDs of Weinstein Company produced films. We learn about Marilyn Monroe (from film historian Drew Casper and actress Michelle Williams), Wallis Simpson (the film W.E. where we hear from a professor and the film's director Madonna) , The Iron Lady (with comments by the book version's author John Campbell and Streep) and one more film I forget. It seems to have been edited from a longer piece because there is a narrator but no title or credit.<br /><br />So, if you want to see a great actress inhabit a role, this is the film. But if you want to learn a lot about British history during Thatcher's career, I'm afraid this is not the best place to find that.<br /><br />I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />"Anything Phonographic"</p></br><a href="../users/A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F.html">A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F</a><br/><p>Meryl Streep won a well-deserved Academy Award for her portrayal of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, to this day one of the most powerful women who has ever graced the earth.<br /><br /> "The Iron Lady" begins with an aged Thatcher walking the streets of London, well into her eighties, buying fruits and vegetables, with no one recognizing who she is. The film is told in flashback as we learn of Margaret's upbringing, her interst in political life and her ultimate postion as Britain's first female head-of-state.<br /><br /> Meryl Streep's performance here is nothing short of astonishing: her speech, facial expressions (helped by inventive make-up) and her mannerisms are dead-on. Streep had never met the real Thatcher, but was able to view old film's from archives from the BBC and other sources and it was from watching Thatcher that Streep discovered how to play her.<br /><br /> It took Meryl 29 years to win another Oscar thanks to this role. As a huge fan of hers I have to say "The Iron Lady" is my favorite of all the performances Streep has done.<br /><br /> Simply an A+ film.</p></br><a href="../users/A9I40WFF40R4.html">A9I40WFF40R4</a><br/><p>Besides portraying dozens of fictional women-- and one rabbi-- Meryl Streep became Ethel Rosenberg, Julia Child and now Margaret Thatcher. Surely if there is any justice left in Hollywood,  she, just having won the Golden  Globe,  will get an Oscar for her splendid performance as Britain's first and only female prime minister. This movie is not to be missed. While the supporting cast  is superb, particularly Jim  Broadbent as Denis Thatcher in old age, this film  belongs to Streep and Streep alone.  She is in most of the scenes; when she is on screen, it is all about her. There is obviously  no role she cannot play.<br /><br />The film opens with Mrs. Thatcher debilitated with dementia and flashes back to her days as a young woman-- played by another actress-- and then as prime minister of course. In practically one-half of the movie, we see her in the present when she cannot remember that her husband Denis is dead. There is a particularly poignant scene where she is signing books and mistakenly writes "Margaret Roberts, " her maiden name instead of  "Thatcher." For those of us who have had family members with dementia, we recognize immediately that Ms. Streep, sad to say, is perfect as this character-- her gait, her vacant stare, her confusion.  And she has all the fire and steel that we associate with Thatcher in her days as prime minister.<br /><br />While I suspect that Ms. Streep does not share the prime minister's political views, it is easy to see why she chose this role since Mrs. Thatcher, whether you like her or not, had an uphill battle as a woman surrounded by men in government.<br /><br />The riot and protest scenes are riveting as the prime minister often is driven through them. The soundtrack is beautiful. I recognized "Casta Diva" from NORMA and some Bach also.<br /><br />You will be wrung out at the end of this film but glad you saw it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>While Meryl Streep deservedly won her third Oscar for her impressive performance as Margaret Thatcher, THE IRON LADY is a disappointing portrait of this historical figure.<br />The script focuses on Thatcher's seeming decline into probable dementia accompanied by hallucinatory conversations with her dead husband (a charming performance by Jim Broadbent) rather than illuminating Thatcher's key political crises.  This is all the more surprising since the director is a woman.<br />Streep is as expected amazing.  There are times it's hard to recognize the actress at all.  THE IRON LADY ultimately emerges as a vehicle for a brilliant performer in a flawed movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JV4QKTEB7QBL.html">A1JV4QKTEB7QBL</a><br/><p>In Phyllida Lloyd's 2011 film, "The Iron Lady," the ever-accomplished Academy Award winning actress Meryl Streep adds another accent to her repertoire of outstanding characters with distinctive speech patterns that mark their identity.  However, it is not the duplication of former British prime minister Margaret Thatcher's voice cadence that wins her her third Oscar, it is her ability to play a woman in angst with multi-faceted nuance.  As Thatcher, Streep ripples and reels with the passing of time--for most of the film we see her as an aged oldster missing her now deceased husband with not much to check off on the daily to-do list other than seeing doctors, packing off her hubby's clothing and battling hallucinations.  Why Phyllida Lloyd decides to use Thatcher as a case-in-point for the ephemeral nature of success and the poster child for a modern-day Ozymandias lesson in the inevitable decline of any human, great or small, along with whatever empires they build, seems understandable on the surface, but results in a dreary portrait of "The Iron Lady" and her myriad of accomplishments within the United Kingdom.<br /><br />Of course, Streep portrays Thatcher in her dotage with a befuddled excellence that entitles her to be thought of as one of today's most brilliant actresses.  As the older Thatcher, she becomes visually disturbing as her mind meanders, chasing after dreams of yesterday as epitomized by the appearance of her deceased husband (played with panache by Jim Broadbent) who reminds and coaxes her to maintain control of whatever is left of her life.  Seeing Thatcher depicted in this way is almost embarrassing and decidedly irreverent.  Should not the woman who was prime minister of the UK longer than anyone else in its history be allowed the perseverance of her private dignity?<br /><br />If writer Abi Morgan's motivation for depicting Thatcher from this vantage point is to garner support for dementia-awareness with unsolicited cooperation from the former prime minister in order to show that it can happen to anyone despite one's former glory, this reviewer supposes that both Morgan and director Lloyd accomplish in projecting this theme.  However, the life of any woman would have done just as well to make this point.  Sadly, anyone expecting to understand the climate and politics of her time at the helm of the British nation will see montages of events like the IRA bombings, her battle with the unions and her mission to reclaim the Falkland Islands but will be ultimately disappointed when attempting to discern her contribution with regard to advancements for women and the British world.<br /><br />Instead of a strong woman who leads an important world nation for over 15 years, the audience sees a woman struggling for her sanity because her physical body is failing.  But what of Thatcher's quick mind?  What of her accomplishments?  Should she not be applauded for her tenacity and ability to stand up to others?  The filmmakers give us a glimpse of this, but focus on Thatcher's deterioration instead of her crested glory.  The resultant film wears thin in the mind of the viewer--the lows are underscored too brutally while the highs are barely explained.<br /><br />Even though Alexandra Roach bristles as the young Margaret Thatcher--she is all about quenching her thirst for change and getting done what she thinks must get done--this reviewer does not get a sense of who Margaret Thatcher really is.  Instead, the image of Streep as the old woman in a world that has passed her by remains steadfast--a cautionary tale almost Buddhist in its leanings towards the insignificance of the world of politics and materialism.  Why bother to strive when what awaits you is forgetfulness, a body that betrays and death?<br /><br />Bottom line?  Phyllida Lloyd's depiction of Margaret Thatcher does not contain enough data about this longest serving British prime minister to consider it a biopic.  Instead, the film, sadly, depicts the trials and tribulations of the aged as dementia and other dehabilitating diseases set in.  This "make hay when the sun shines" mentality depresses rather than instills ambition or rallies motivation towards world progress in any positive manner.  Streep excels as the aging Maggie, missing her husband, her son and underling the importance of having some purpose to even the longest days.  Recommended only for those who want to see Streep's award-winning performance and realize this is not an upbeat biographic film bullet-pointing Thatcher's actions during her ministry.<br />Diana Faillace Von Behren<br />"reneofc"</p></br><a href="../users/A2WB4OWBUH2VQX.html">A2WB4OWBUH2VQX</a><br/><p>***possible spoilers***<br />It's hard to argue when someone says that Meryl Streep is the world's greatest living actress. She shows why in her portrayal of Margaret Thatcher in "The Iron Lady". However, an honest look at this film shows that there is a severe political bent on the way the story is told and this diminishes the fine acting that takes place. Heavily-laden phrases like "You must be crazy to suggest spending cuts during a recession" seem such an obvious political statement on today's politics. When the film portrays Thatcher as an agressive, mean-spirited woman who willingly abandons her family for her career (the scene when her kids run after her down the street as she leaves for parliment is quite ridiculous),it becomes obvious that the filmmakers want to cast a negative light on her achievements. I was really surprised to see that the film implies that Thatcher "heard voices" well before she resigned as the prime minister, implying that all of her political decisions were influenced by the voices in her head. Possible message: anyone who doesn't think like a liberal must be hearing crazy voices in their heads. It's ironic that liberal filmmakers who pretend to be rabid feminists so willingly undermine achievements made by women who don't represent their own agendas. You can't help but notice this selective feminism while watching the film, despite the great acting. The film comes across as an unbalanced and mean-spirited portrayal of Thatcher, which cannot be the whole truth of her story.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TPW86OHXTXFC.html">A1TPW86OHXTXFC</a><br/><p>There is no doubt that Meryl Streep embodied the spirit and facade of Margaret Thatcher. It is one of those remarkable performances that you are unlikely to forget. The real Margaret Thatcher, however, was left somewhere else. I got the point that she was a strong woman, opinionated and had a rough road to hoe to her position as Prime Minister, but the rest was left elsewhere.<br /><br />Streep's performance and that of David Broadbent, who plays her husband, Dennis, were the highlights of the film. The story is told in flashbacks and as we are told in terms of a demented, Margaret Thatcher. Not the best way to portray a woman of such substance. It is intimated that her son, Mark, was not and has not been a big part of her life. It was also intimated that Margaret Thatcher was not a big part of her children's lives. Not much was explained, it is all a perception. Much of what Margaret Thatcher went through as part of the House of Commons was also our perception. It looked like she had a great deal to overcome with her male colleagues, and the fact that she was the first Prime Minister is remarkable. That road in her life, needed much more emphasis.<br /><br />Meryl Streep gave such a superb performance, this was the film. She deserved the Academy Award for this performance.<br />That, however, is the film, and I expected so much more.<br /><br />Recommended for performance. prisrob 05-10-12<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003E7PZCO">It's Complicated</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001R1B6YA">Defending Your Life</a></p></br><a href="../users/A20EEWWSFMZ1PN.html">A20EEWWSFMZ1PN</a><br/><p>This film had a great title and great actors and lots of money thrown at it. So what went wrong? What went wrong, is that someone does not know how to make a movie. You might think that they were trying to be artsy-fartsy; however I think it was a thorough lack of movie making skills.<br /><br />For those who lived through the era they would be disappointed because nothing of any interest or any of the special highlights of Margret's life was displayed. I personally did not mind what was not shown. It was their hodgepodge chopped up moved back and forth through time inconsistent nonsense that not only ruined this film but any film they would've made on any subject. I put the blame squarely on Phyllida Lloyd - Director, Abi Morgan - Writer (screenplay), Damian Jones - Producer, Elliot Davis - Cinematographer, Thomas Newman - Composer, Simon Elliott - Production Designer, and Justine Wright - Editor.<br /><br />To keep you from having to guess what I'm talking about and actually watch snippets of this movie I'll tell you. As filler it shows a ditzy old Margret played by Meryl Streep who flashes back in time to have the real story "snippets of her life" displayed played by Alexandra Roach. Alexander does all the real parts in Meryl Streep gets the "Saturday Night Live parts."</p></br><a href="../users/A1FG91CM8221X1.html">A1FG91CM8221X1</a><br/><p>It's only because of the superb performances of Meryl Streep and Jim Broadbent as Margaret and Denis Thatcher that I give "The Iron Lady" three stars out of five. Without them, it would deserve two at the most. Streep as usual is impeccable; her appearance, voice and mannerisms are so perfect that for long stretches of the movie you forget you're not watching the real Margaret Thatcher. Broadbent as Denis is playful and charmingly dotty; together, he and Streep make the most delightful British Odd Couple since Horace ahd Hilda Rumpole.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Abi Morgan's screenplay is misshapen and wrongheaded, and Phyllida Lloyd's direction lackadaisical. Under their guidance, "The Iron Lady" becomes mostly the story of the elderly, demented Margaret, living in a fantasy world with the image of her long-dead husband. The story of Margaret's political rise and triumph, in which she once again made Britain--for better or worse--a haven for imperialism and laissez-faire capitalism, is tacked on almost as an afterthought. Of course the political story is the only reason the life of Margaret Thatcher is of any interest, but ironically it's the pitiful story of the elderly, fading Thatcher that holds our interest, strictly because of Streep and Broadbent. If it weren't for them, "The Iron Lady" would be a total botch.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>This first paragraph will be filled with statements you either already know or should already know. Meryl Streep is a great actress. The plethora and diversity of the roles she has done is testament to this. And she has an uncanny, chameleon-like ability to adopt, use and make accents work for her character. Because of her ability to create such believable, indelible, interesting characters, she frequently appears in films that are not as memorable as her performance. None of this should come as news to you. And all of this is applicable to "The Iron Lady", the new biopic about Margaret Thatcher.<br /><br />Beginning in "Current Day", Thatcher (Streep) ambles down the street, oblivious to most, and wanders into a shop to buy a pint of milk. She is unrecognized, ignored and shocked by the behavior of the people in the shop. Returning home, Denis (Jim Broadbent), her husband, spreads too much butter on his toast earning a chiding remark from his wife. Then, he realizes her assistants are in a tizzy, speaking in whispered tones. Why and how did Lady Thatcher get out and wander around alone? Denis playfully chastises her. An assistant asks her is she is ready to begin sorting through Denis' old clothes, to decide what to donate to charity, which pieces to pass on, which pieces of clothing should just be thrown away. Yes, Denis is gone. She realizes she is a little confused and remembers back to World War II and the Blitz.<br /><br />Written by Abi Morgan ("Shame") and directed by Phyllida Lloyd ("Mamma Mia!"),  "The Iron Lady" suffers from the same narrative problems as the previous collaboration between the star and the director.<br /><br />Frankly, I was surprised by how much of "Lady" is set in present day. It is interesting to watch Thatcher as she deals with old age, memories haunting and confusing her. Her daughter, Carol (Olivia Colman) shows up and helps her prepare for a dinner party. As she helps her mother get dressed, the television shows a news story about a bombing in Afghanistan. This prompts a memory flash to a similar event early in her political career and helps to set-up the narrative style of the film.<br /><br />It is fascinating to watch Streep play Thatcher, especially at this stage in her life. In the first scene, as she ambles down the street, it isn't immediately obvious we are watching the former Prime Minister. She looks like any typical old woman, scarf covering her hair, stoop in her back. When we realize it is Thatcher, we immediately feel some regret, some pity. How did one of the most powerful women in history come to this?<br /><br />Streep makes Thatcher's age, mental fragility, confusion and dread a palpable thing. As she watches the story about the bombing on television, she immediately slips into Prime Minister mode and begins addressing the public. Her daughter and assistant watch with concern on their faces.<br /><br />Because the film concentrates so much time on Thatcher in her later life, the filmmakers use memories as jumping points to illustrate other parts of her life. This is hardly a modern, innovative or even an engaging method of depicting a person's life story - it's been done thousands, millions of times before - but the simplicity does allow us to concentrate on the characters and story.<br /><br />But "Lady" has two things working against it: The overdone narrative device and director Phyllida Law.<br /><br />While the narrative device is simplistic and allows us to concentrate on the characters, it is not modern in any way and makes the film seem old-fashioned. Old-fashioned is not an adjective most filmmakers would want used to describe their film. And because the subject matter is basically a senior citizen, the old-fashioned nature of the narrative only seems amplified.<br /><br />Law comes from a background of theater, opera and music videos. Her first big film "Mamma Mia!" an adaptation of the popular musical is good, but the cheap production values and penchant to use music video techniques to illustrate narrative, really bring the overall quality down. I get it. Law has experience with music videos and feels comfortable using this technique. But it doesn't mesh with the "musical" narrative of the rest of the film.<br /><br />In "Lady", Thatcher remembering back to key moments in her life and career almost creates a narrative "promise" that these flashbacks will provide us with the backstory, the narrative we need and desire to get a more complete picture of the politician's life. A flashback leads to how Margaret and Denis meet. Another flashes back to when they decide to marry. But there is nothing between the two and their marriage is portrayed as a transaction. She loses her first campaign for Parliament and Denis convinces her that a married woman would stand a better chance. If this is in fact true, it doesn't paint a very romantic picture. If it isn't, what are we supposed to pick up from this? We don't get enough details or information to fill in the gaps or make other connections. Only when we watch Margaret and Denis late in their life do we realize that they are now very much in love.<br /><br />Later, flashbacks lead to a scene of Margaret trying to make an impact in Parliament. Then, another scene shows two of her fellow Conservative Party members giving her coaching, grooming her (somewhat literally) to become the party leader and the PM. A flashback triggers a memory of an IRA attack that kills one of her advisors. Then, she is Prime Minister. Then, things aren't go going especially well. Then, she goes to war in the Falkland Islands. The war goes poorly until the British are victorious and everything turns around for Margaret and the Conservatives and they ride a wave of popularity.<br /><br />These moments seem almost secondary. If my description of the narrative seems a bit choppy, a bit like an outline, this is an accurate reflection of the film. As Thatcher becomes extremely popular, she is shown dancing with Reagan and Nelson Mandela. This is virtually the only mention of Reagan and does nothing to illustrate their relationship. In fact, the entire sequence, as Thatcher and her party enjoy their power and popularity is basically a montage, a music video, which fails to illustrate anything of value.<br /><br />At one point, Geoffrey Howe (Anthony Head) begins to appear constantly at Thatcher's side. Later, she berates him and he turns in his resignation. We don't learn what their relationship is or why this is an important development.<br /><br />The same problem plagues the character played by Richard E. Grant. At one point, someone makes a comment about Thatcher losing support and she turns and spots Michael Heseltine (Grant) looking at her suspiciously. Why are people jockeying to replace her? Who is Heseltine? Why does he want to replace the popular PM? Is she even still popular? Unfortunately, the film doesn't help us with these questions.<br /><br />Broadbent and Streep work well together and they paint a portrait of a couple who have been together a long time, remembering and laughing at all of the silly memories they share. It is a good portrait of an older couple.<br /><br />But we don't really learn how they get to this point. There is one brief scene showing Denis and Carol's amazement when Thatcher announces she is running to be Prime Minister. Initially, he seems very upset, but just as quickly seems fully supportive.<br /><br />There also seems to be a lot of animosity between Carol and her mother, but we don't really learn why this exists.<br /><br />Law seems convinced that we must know these things and this is a dangerous conceit to adopt when making a biopic. Most successful biopics concentrate on a specific period of the subject's life. By doing this, they are able to illuminate these moments and build what we hope is a memorable portrait. And most biopics are more than two hours long. "Iron Lady" runs 105 minutes and presents snippets from throughout the Prime Minister's life. Because of this, it feels like we are watching a study cheat sheet come to life. Key moments, important facts and interesting details are missing throughout.<br /><br />"The Iron Lady" features another great performance from Streep, which is not served well by a haphazard screenplay, incomplete ideas and choppy filmmaking.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZOF747O5EB6R.html">A1ZOF747O5EB6R</a><br/><p>Margaret Thatcher acquired the sobriquet, the "Iron Lady", from the Soviet Union.  It was meant to be disparaging.  She regarded it as a compliment.<br /><br />"The Iron Lady" provides a biography of Margaret Thatcher's adult life.  The highlight of this life, of course, was her more than a decade a Britain's first female prime minister.  The film covers this as a series of flash backs as seen the through the eyes of a very aged former prime minister.  The technique works.  Her life has certainly been quite extraordinary although there is little focus on her weaknesses.  In this sense, the film almost becomes hagiography.<br /><br />Notwithstanding the apparent lack of blemishes in the character of the former prime minister, Meryl Streep, in playing the older Margaret Thatcher, is spell binding.  Moreover, Streep is simply magnificent. Her performance is my early call for an Oscar. She really does become Margaret Thatcher.  There are no apparent flaws.  The accent, in particular, is right on the money.<br /><br />Streep is supported by Jim Broadbent as Dennis.  Unfortunately, his role tends to fall almost to caricature at times.  This is a shame as there are a number of other cameo roles and most of these are played excellently.  Michael Foot, Geoffrey Howe, Michael Heseltine, et al are played in absolutely convincing style by a great supporting cast.  The various sets and the manner in which the era of the 1980s is re-created is also first class.<br /><br />In sum, apart from the danger of hagiography, this is a great film led by an actress at the top of her form.  Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A2H44WVZS59KKT.html">A2H44WVZS59KKT</a><br/><p>Margaret Thatcher was such a huge figure in British politics and for, whatever reason, the filmmakers decided to focus on her latter years and her battle with dementia. AND they didn't even do that well.<br /><br />That is not to say that Meryl Streep doesn't do a fabulous job because she does - as always. Watching her in this film WAS like watching Thatcher herself.  But I was hoping for so much more - an in-depth look at Thatcher's service to her country and the changes she helped bring about. That didn't happen and I was disappointed.<br /><br />It's worth watching "Iron Lady" just to see Streep's performance but I wouldn't watch it for a history lesson.</p></br><a href="../users/A168VXSISJWQN9.html">A168VXSISJWQN9</a><br/><p>.... what you're left with is this movie.<br /><br />Margaret Thatcher had a profound effect on British politics. Not only the first woman prime minister, but also one of the most committed to her viewpoint, she took Britain by the scruff of the neck and shook it up. The changes Thatcher made were enormous, including destroying the coal-mining industry, increasing home ownership by selling off subsidised housing to the tenants, mobilising the country for a war in the Falkland Islands, slashing government spending and many more. Some people were helped by the changes, some hurt, some, such as the union leaders of the mining industry, destroyed. She was intensely, and deliberately, divisive. Her impact was such that the British Labour party completely reinvented itself as 'New Labour', a party unrecognizable from the old Labour party of the 1970s. Thatcher won 3 elections, became the UK's longest-serving prime minister of the 20th century and was ultimately thrown out by her own party. Whatever your feelings towards her, she has to be regarded as the single most important political figure in the UK in the second half of the 20th century.<br /><br />The problem is that this film misses almost all of her impact on society, both positive and negative. Over half the film is given over to an imagined portrait of her in her later years, having conversations with her dead husband. The earlier part of her life is covered in flash-backs, so it lacks continuity and, often, context. In trying to present a portrait of the individual, the film-makers have diminished her actions to a side-issue which is, in her case, entirely inappropriate. Thatcher rarely spoke about her personal feelings and did not let others into her personal life. If ever a person were defined by what she did rather than who she was, it was Margaret Thatcher. The perspective of this movie is all wrong and what should have been a gripping tale of one of the most influential political figures of recent times becomes a rather dreary portrayal of a person in decline.<br /><br />Meryl Streep has been nominated for 17 Oscars and won 3 times. In my view, pretty well all of the 14 performances which did not win were better than this one. That's not a criticism of Streep, who is the most brilliant female actor of our time and turns in an immaculate performance as always. It's just that the part is so poorly drawn that Streep is hardly able to utilise her magnificent skills to make it come alive. Instead, I was left with the uneasy feeling that her Academy Award was not for acting but for impersonation. Streep has so often made characters compelling and unforgettable that to see her win for what was basically a female version of Rich Little was somewhat galling. I suspect in later years she will not look on this award as her finest achievement by a very long way.<br /><br />There is scope for an important film to be made about the life and impact of Margaret Thatcher. This is not it.</p></br><a href="../users/A18GP1PWVTKXQQ.html">A18GP1PWVTKXQQ</a><br/><p>*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />No matter how good an actor's performance is (and in this case, Meryl Streep's performance is excellent), if the script is weak, the movie as a whole, cannot work. And that's what's happened with 'The Iron Lady'. Director Phyllida Lloyd and Screenwriter Abi Morgan want it both ways. On one hand, they have a great reverence for Margaret Thatcher as a feminist pioneer who became Britian's first female prime minister. On the other hand, being liberals, they've got to be uncomfortable with Thatcher's conservative political stance (to many liberals, in her heyday, Thatcher was viewed as a modern day 'Marie Antoinette').<br /><br />On the surface, Lloyd and Morgan have produced a fairly standard biopic--a hagiography of sorts, touching on Thatcher's storied political career. But I would argue that because of their unease with Thatcher's belief system, they unconsciously attempt to disparage her. Lloyd and Morgan end up focusing on Thatcher in her old age, ravaged by Alzheimer's, and a shell of her former self. Thatcher is now transformed into a tragic figure, and whatever Lloyd and Morgan's underlying intentions, the net effect is to constantly remind us that a woman who once was a firebrand, has now been taken down quite a few pegs.<br /><br />It's one thing to deal with the reality of Thatcher's dementia, but to focus on it, as the main focus of the film, that's a big mistake. Why do we have to be constantly reminded of Thatcher's fall from grace? This could be a story about ANYONE with Alzheimer's! The Weinstein Brothers already covered the subject matter with their 2001 film, 'Iris' starring Judi Dench and Jim Broadbent (note Broadbent shows up here in virtually the same kind of role--the understanding husband who must cope with a wife in sad decline!) . And yes we know that Alzheimer's is a terrible thing but to knock us over the head scene after scene (with Thatcher experiencing hallucinations of her dead husband), that takes away from the material we're really interested in: Thatcher's rise to power and subsequent political career.<br /><br />Granted, it is a tall order to turn the story of Thatcher's political career into compelling drama; but Abi Morgan is clearly not up to the task. What the script lacks is basic conflict, with a recognizable external arc, culminating in a resolution to the protagonist's dark moment. 'The Iron Lady' works best when Thatcher battles her allies in the Conservative party, but those moments are fleeting. Her opponents are underdeveloped--on for such a short time that the film feels more like a History Channel biography than full fledged drama. Instead, we're treated to archival footage, chronicling the frenzied opposition to Thatcher's policies through the years, as well as realistic (but again, short) scenes in Parliament, where we never get to know any of the Labor opponents as fleshed out characters.<br /><br />Individual scenes do occasionally work. When a bespectacled Harry Lloyd (the young Denis Thatcher) proposes to Alexandra Roach (the young Margaret), the young actors capture the unbridled innocence of the young couple about to embark on their life's journey. The two scenes involving violence also work, which include Thatcher witnessing the assassination of a political mentor and surviving an IRA bombing with her husband, while staying a hotel for a political conference. The Falklands War is covered in the style of a standard biopic but we do learn interesting details as to Thatcher's reaction to the conflict (she writes personal letters to the families of each soldier killed). Finally, there's a powerful scene (albeit somewhat clich&eacute;d), as Thatcher witnesses her husband's death, as he disappears into white light.<br /><br />Despite Streep's bravura performance, one feels that she acts in isolation. Undoubtedly, Thatcher's rise was dependent on a myriad of relationships, which are only touched on briefly here. What's more, the film's scenarists avoid taking a stand on many of her controversial policies, preferring to retreat to the generic portrait of Alzheimer's victim.<br /><br />In the end, we find out it was Thatcher's obstinacy that led to her political downfall. She ended up alienating her very own conservative party members, who couldn't stand her lack of flexibility and harsh, demanding work habits.<br /><br />Somewhere, there's a story here but not in the confused recollections of a sad woman, plagued with dementia. The rich tapestry of British political life from 1979 to 1990 is glossed over as we're treated to The Iron Lady's career from the outside in, instead of the inside out.</p></br><a href="../users/A18758S1PUYIDT.html">A18758S1PUYIDT</a><br/><p>Streep's performance is the main attraction in this otherwise rather uninteresting biopic.  The constant shifting from present to past is more of a distraction than a clever device.  When exactly did her husband die?  In the explosion?  Why did we not see more of her son and his family?  Why is her daughter barely there?</p></br></body></html>

Set in the mid-1950s, we see the strained marriage of April and Frank Wheeler, an aspiring actress and former longshoreman who initially shared a keen sense of adventure, a vitality that has waned since they had children and moved to the suburbs. Frank (Leonardo DiCaprio) takes the train to work in New York each day with thousands of men like him. April (Kate Winslet) stays home, minds the children, chats with neighbors, and becomes increasingly frustrated with her circumscribed life. So she proposes that they give it all up, move overseas, and immerse themselves in life again. At first, Frank agrees, but then the struggle to balance security, happiness, and social pressures begins.<br /><br />The 1950s were a conformist time, an era when the American middle class ideal was defined especially narrowly. Of course, people like the Wheelers led comfortable lives, for which perhaps they should have been grateful. Comfort and security are nothing to sneeze at. On the other hand, the stifling social environment and rigid value system fashionable at the time had ugly side effects: mind-numbing boredom, shallowness, isolation, hypocrisy, and alcoholism among them. What strikes me about "Revolutionary Road" is how contemporary it is. America entered another conformist era in the 1990s, one that I estimate is more conformist than the 1950s, as the middle class is larger, careerism is taken more seriously, and rigid and often bizarre expectations are now extended to children.<br /><br />In an interesting twist, it is April, a mother of two young children, who wants to give up her comfortable home and take on a job to feel like she is still alive. But her willingness to take the situation in hand unintentionally emasculates Frank, who has slipped more easily into the constraints of middle class ambition. Or perhaps he is genuinely excited by the prospect of a promotion and higher pay. Frank has a compulsion to talk about everything, but he never says what he thinks. "Revolutionary Road" was directed by Sam Mendes and filmed on location inside a suburban Connecticut house. This is helpful, as the audience is placed in April's world, surrounded by walls, with windows overlooking the quaint yards of neighboring homes, and unruly woods out back where freedom seems to reign. Two outstanding performances by Winslet and DiCaprio are complimented by a sharp supporting cast, including Kathy Bates, Dylan Baker, and Michael Shannon.<br /><br />The DVD (Paramount 2009): There are 5 deleted scenes with optional commentary, one featurette, and an audio commentary. "Lives of Quiet Desperation: The Making of Revolutionary Road" (29 min) interviews the director, cast, producers, screenwriter Justin Haythe about the film's themes, production designer Kristi Zea about the office and house sets, and costume designer Albert Wolsky. The audio commentary is by director Sam Mendes and screenwriter Justin Haythe. They compare the final cut of the film to a preliminary cut, the film to the novel, talk about characters, filming on location, and the challenges of dramatizing Frank's interior, since his thoughts were expressed in the book. Subtitles are available for the film in English, French, Spanish. Dubbing is available in French and Spanish.</p></br><a href="../users/AE9GUE3HHOX3U.html">AE9GUE3HHOX3U</a><br/><p>Leo and kate are some of my fave actors so it's great 2 see them paired up again.  the story in this film is a lil slow but overall because I like the acting, it was a compelling movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A31ARSC1LGY8WK.html">A31ARSC1LGY8WK</a><br/><p>Interesting though not altogether satisfying study of a marriage in crisis. Winslet and DiCaprio as the warring couple are excellent if a little bit too "pretty" for their roles. All their bickering becomes a little bit repetitive and depressing. But that this film makes you feel uncomfortable is no accident. It's an unusually mature examination of adult relationships.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDNTB7377YH2.html">A1CDNTB7377YH2</a><br/><p>Dark period piece about a 1950's couple (Winsett and DeCaprio) who meet at a party in Manhattan.  She is an aspiring actress and he is a fun guy with very few aspirations other than being something like a delivery guy.<br /><br />The scene shifts forward a few years and Kate is in a play that is apparently a dud.  Leo, now her husband, tries to comfort her saying that at least she was the best thing about the dismal play.  This does nothing to quell her disappointment.  He than pulls the car over (they were driving) and starts yelling at her, telling her that it is unfair for her to be blaming him for her failure (this was not true).  He nearly hits her and this scene is a harbinger of things to come.<br /><br />Throughout the film it seems that Kate's dreams are constantly shattered while Leo muddle's through life oblivious to her needs.  Kate feels that her life as a housewife in a suburban home with two kids (that was supposed to be the American dream back then) is a boring existance and her husband constantly tells her how boring his job is and that he only keeps it to pay the bills.<br /><br />Kate comes up with an idea where they will go to Paris to live.  Leo had always told her it was the most fun place he had ever been to.  She thinks that this would be perfect as she would put meaning to both of their lives where she can work and support him until he figures out what he wants to do rather than toil away at something meaningless.<br /><br />The whole thing sounds like a chance to live out a possible dream but Leo does everything to thwart it.  Whether it be starting up an affair with a girl in the steno pool or wanting to stay at the job he has because his father worked there for twenty years.<br /><br />The realtor (Cathy Bates) that sold them their house becomes a regular friend of theirs and convinces them to let her bring her son to visit even though he currently resides in a mental institution.  The son may be crazy but he is the only one who sees their relationship for what it really is and has an uncanny knack for seeing through lies.<br /><br />As the movie goes on Leo keeps killing his wife's dreams to a point that she becomes unfeeling and kind of crazy herself.  I liked this film for showing that the American dream of the 50's wasn't all it was cracked up to be.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RH7ARWQSUVQV.html">A2RH7ARWQSUVQV</a><br/><p>I disagree with most of the reviewers here.  Most view this film as one of a dysfunctional marriage set in the monotone that was the 1950s.  On the other hand, if the film had been set in the 1960s, it would have been viewed as a dysfunctional couple in which one [April] was determined to abandon the 'straight' life whereas her husband [Frank], simply couldn't, with the tragedy that ensues.<br /><br />As a person who was always uncomfortable with socalled societal conventions, I see it otherwise.  April is determined to shake things up but her 'shake up' has no real direction.  She wants to relocate to Paris without really knowing anything about it....  As third party viewers, we recognize that Paris will prove even more disappointing than Connecticut.  Her husband, Frank, who has been to Paris, is initially carried away by his wife's dream but, learning of her pregnancy, he is jerked back into reality.  Not April.<br /><br />April, who was probably always psychiatrically fragile, slides inexorably into mental illness.  Severe mental illness is tragic as is demonstrated graphically in the grim ending of this well-acted tale.<br /><br />Ron Braithwaite author of novels...'Skull Rack' and 'Hummingbird God'...on the Spanish Conquest of Mexico</p></br><a href="../users/A17FLA8HQOFVIG.html">A17FLA8HQOFVIG</a><br/><p>Starring Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio, this 2008 film is about a marriage in the 1950s.  It's a time of conformity, suburban living, stay-at-home mothers and a lot of smoking and drinking.  Directed by Sam Mendes, there is an edge to this film, and the viewer immediately senses the despair beneath the seemingly happy veneer that this couple puts forth.  There's tension throughout as DiCaprio is bored with his job and seeks solace in a meaningless affair.  In the meantime, Winslet is home with two children and her hopes of being an actress have been dashed with a mediocre performance in a local theatrical production.  The couple argues a lot and it is clear there is something missing from their marriage.<br /><br />And then one day Kate comes up with the idea of moving to Paris where she will support her husband as a secretary and he can "find himself".  Plans move ahead.  The neighbors are surprised and a bit jealous.  And the real estate agent, played by Kathy Bates, who has befriended the couple, brings her son, who has just been released from a mental institution where he has gone through electroshock treatments, into the couple's home for dinner.  Conflict ensues and he is the only one who voices some painful truths.<br /><br />This film made me uncomfortable, as it was intended to be.  However, I couldn't take my eyes from the screen because I was interested in knowing how it would all turn out.  Kate Winslet gave a remarkably wonderful performance.  But in my opinion, Leonardo DiCaprio just can't act.  Whenever he was in a serious scene I just couldn't relate him to the character he was playing and I found myself thinking about his rather wooden performance.  I also find it interesting that the only actor who was nominated for an Academy Award from this film was Michael Shannon, who played the role of mentally unstable neighbor.<br /><br />Revolutionary Road is a good film.  I just wish they had chosen a better actor to play the role of the husband.</p></br><a href="../users/A30TK6U7DNS82R.html">A30TK6U7DNS82R</a><br/><p>Obviously a labor of love for all concerned, Revolutionary Road comes to us after many decades of trying to bring it to the big screen by a long list of many of Hollywood's most talented creators.  All of them have run ashoal on the insurmountable problem odf the novel's structure.  Sam Mendes, the talented British director, thought he had it licked.  He didn't see the trouble coming from the opposite direction: while he was making this show, US television was delivering MAD MEN, a Revolutionary Road knockoff that manages to outdo the original in every direction.  Uh-oh, what a disaster, not in execution but just in comparison to the TV version, the Mendes picture just seems like a mighty waste of talent.<br /><br />Others have listed the similarities, so I won't bother, but I will say that MAD MEN has made this picture not only superfluous but actually an object of curiosity.  Watching Kate and Leo in what seems like a dutiful recreation of the American 50s, I began feeling restless wondering why even bother putting it back in the 50s?  Wouldn't it have been more honest, less glamorous, if the filmmakers had made it happen today?  What would possibly have made the least amount of difference?  The Wheelers would have the same ennui at living unfulfilled lives.  April would still have been an awful actress (this was a holdover from the Yates original, one of the many ways in which we know that Yates hated women).  Her despair at being ten weeks pregnant, the way Frank uses this as a bargaining chip to make her stay home.  Everything could have taken place in 2008 and you wouldn't have a picture dripping with all that Kodachrome quaintness that ultimately ruins the picture.  These types of movies are made to make audiences feel better, as if to say, look how awful people had it back then, nothing like this could possibly happen today.<br /><br />As the office mope who sleeps with friendly Frank, Zoe Kazan tries, but the writing just doesn't give her anything to work with.  Think of the various girls Don Draper has it on with, and the contrast is just humiliating to Mendes.  I love Richard Yates, always have, but we've come to a point when others do him better than he did himself (except for EASTER PARADE and A GOOD SCHOOL).</p></br><a href="../users/A4PPZNQF1X2IY.html">A4PPZNQF1X2IY</a><br/><p>Looks like the opinions are all over the map.  Definitely better than the dreadfully pedestrian "The Reader".  That withstanding, the script, although impactful, leaves the audience confused over the message/purpose of the movie.<br />The reason I give it four stars is for the overall authenticity of the tragic romance between the protagonists.  Several fight scenes pulled out the guts of the infamous and disturbing fights between young lovers when the relation sours, and dramatically depicts the unseemly and needless pain two nominally decent people can inflict on each other.  50s plastic commercialism is not a new subject,<br />yet the movie did have a new take on the matter as the couple dared to defy convention, but ultimately the movie was about how they ended up conspiring against each other and the simple beauties of a normal life.  DiCaprio's character especially was unveiled to be ultimately cowardly, hypocritical, and fawning to the luxuries and vacuous comforts he purportedly despised.  The movie is unable to end on a conclusive note however, and ultimately indicts both human desire but also convention.  A bit of a debbie downer i'd say.  About 3.5 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A10E3F50DIUJEE.html">A10E3F50DIUJEE</a><br/><p>Kate Winslet can do no wrong by me.  She is such an amazing actress.  This film is an excellent showcase for her talent: the subtle body language and facial expressions, as well as the dynamic and explosive emotions and dialogue show her true gifts as an actress.<br /><br />Leonardo DiCaprio is stunning as well, but frankly he pales in comparison to Winslet.  Michael Shannon is also stunning in this film.  It is, overall, an excellent film that dissects several summer months in the lives of April and Frank Wheeler.  As they come to grasp the "emptiness and hopelessness" of their unfulfilling suburban lives, they both begin falling apart in their own ways.  It is obvious how unhappy they are ... but it is not until Frank's birthday that they attempt to do anything about it.  April comes up a grand scheme to move to Paris, so they can finally live.  Along the way, they face much resistance and soul searching as life continually throws them obstacles.<br /><br />I would categorize the film as somber. I truly enjoyed it, but was left rather sad in the end.  Still, do not let that discourage you from seeing this truly brilliant film.  Highly recommended</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>A half a century ago migration from the noisy high-powered success of the city to the serenity of the suburbs found the path of REVOLUTIONARY ROAD a common one.  Richard Yates' novel about the fragility of married commitment in 1955 has been very successfully transformed to the screen by writer Justin Haythe, director Sam Mendes and a perfect cast of actors.  All of the soured expectations of that period gel in this superb film - a movie that is difficult to watch at times, mostly because it rings so very true.<br /><br />Frank (Leonardo DiCaprio) and April (Kate Winslet) Wheeler move to Connecticut from New York when the addition of children to their lives of thwarted expectations alter their once dreamy plans for their future.  Once in the 'just perfect' little suburb and living in a just perfect little house sold to them by real estate agent<br />Helen Givings (Kathy Bates) - who has a grown son John (Michael Shannon) who is in a mental institution and has undergone multiple shock therapy treatments that allow him to see things as they are no matter how cruel or rude his views - Frank settles for life in the Knox Business Machines Company, reluctantly following in the footsteps of his father while April attempts to rationalize her dreams of being an actress by appearing in an unimpressive amateur theatrical group.  From the opening frames of this claustrophobically suffocating new life the once happy couple shows signs of deterioration of a marriage.  The manner in which they couple attempt to dramatically change their boring life is destroyed by the realities of their situation: another pregnancy plays a significant role in the downward spiral of Frank and April's future and we as viewers are forced to watch the castle crumble.<br /><br />Winslet and DiCaprio are excellent in the lead roles, offering the type of sensitive acting skills that pull the audience into the film.  The supporting roles by Kathy Bates, Michael Shannon, David Harbour, Richard Easton and Kathryn Hahn are cameos worthy of praise.  Every aspect of the film recreates the 1955 era and in some ways that 'distance' makes observing the film emotionally more tolerable.  This is a sad story that has no redeeming end.  Well worth the attention it has received.

This story has so many layers to it<br />and is well told and acted. You will either love it or you'll<br />hate it, depending on what you like to get out of the movies<br />that you watch. I don't want to bore you with a scene-by-scene<br />depictment in my review, because they're are so many reviewers<br />who have already done that for you!--But my heading for this<br />review says it all basically!--Two people in a very repressed<br />and socially narrow time who meet, get married, and do<br />what people of their time where expected to do...<br />only they completely lose themselves, their dreams,<br />and what chance at true happiness that they have<br />due to the need to fit in.<br />There's alot of angst and inner turmoil within these characters. Everything is done subtlely...but deeply felt.<br />The 1950's were on many levels about conformity and not bucking<br />the status quo...at least for the adults of that time!<br />The kids were on another page!<br />(i.e. Rock-n-Roll, James Dean, Elvis, etc.)<br />It ends on a very sad and unexpected note that left me kind<br />of up in the air, but I have to give it 4 stars on the strength<br />of the acting and subject matter. It's not for everyone,<br />but it's still a quality film.<br />The actor who played (John) the mental patient who comes<br />over and completely sees through all their BS gave<br />a great & hilarious performance as well!<br />I loved what he brought to it!<br />Like an idiot savant/soothsayer who you'd like to<br />strangle because he won't shut the hell up!

They also both feel doomed in their lives; he hates his job and she always wanted to be an actress but ended up an ordinary housewife. Excitement does come back into their lives, however, when they decide to move to Paris and do all the things they once wanted to do, but life has a way of spoiling even the best of plans.<br /><br />Based on Richard Yate's seminal novel about suburban discontent, the movie has the same plot but lacks the author's sly, witty observations acknowledging the irony of people being unfulfilled amid relative luxury, luxury made possible by rigidly conforming to the expectations of society.  DiCaprio and Winslet both do competent jobs; he has a more sympathetic role, looking quite young but handsome, while she plays a desperate shrew, looking much older and being the only woman in the cast not to have the 50's look in hair and make-up.  The period is otherwise wonderfully reproduced and the movie is photographed with a lot of natural sunlight that gives a yellowed, washed-out look, befitting a story about hopelessness.<br /><br />While not as memorable as the novel, the movie is still a well-made character study.  Because there isn't much action, it feels like a staged play much of the time and it's hard to feel sorry for people who seem to have it all and still want more.  As a couple, Leo and Kate don't recreate the romantic magic of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000JLWW">Titanic</a>, but they do prove to be fine actors.</p></br><a href="../users/A21B2TJBWCSK1R.html">A21B2TJBWCSK1R</a><br/><p>There is an audio commentary by director Sam Mendes and screenwriter Justin Haythe. According to Mendes, the BBC owned the rights to Yates' book and asked Haythe to adapt it four years ago. They shot the entire film on location and almost completely in sequence so that DiCaprio and Winslet really lived with their characters. Mendes says that the look of the film was not inspired by other films but a documentary about the suburbs and photographs from the era. Haythe talks at length about adapting the book to film - what was left out, changed and so on.<br /><br />"Lives of Quiet Desperation: The Making of Revolutionary Road" is a very classy featurette on how this film came together. Winslet was a big fan of the book and really wanted to make it into a film. Mendes had just finished <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E0OBK6">Jarhead (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)</a> and didn't want to jump right into another film but Winslet worked on him for a year until he agreed to do it. It also took Winslet two years to convince DiCaprio to do the film and he loved the script and the chance to work with her again. This featurette also touches upon the challenge of working on location and how the fantastic look of the film was achieved.<br /><br />Finally, there are five deleted scenes with optional commentary by Mendes and Haythe. There is a scene that was to reveal the Wheeler children earlier on in the film. There is also more footage of the Wheelers visiting with their next-door neighbors with DiCaprio delivering an excellent monologue that reveals more about his character. We see more footage of Frank commuting to work. There is also a flashback with the Wheelers seeing their new home. Mendes and Haythe talk about why this footage was cut and put it into context with the rest of the film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>This film could have been a melodramatic mash and it is not. In fact the situation and the various developments make it quasi-tragic. Tragic because it is the story of a totally impossible epiphany for a couple who is living in our modern society. There is no escape from the present programmed and even pre-fabricated life in which we all live. We have practically no freedom of choice. The only freedom of choice we do have is to refuse a possible promotion, a potential chance in this life, and we will end up on the dump, the manure pile. There is no choice because we have to pay for the house, the car, the children's education, and so many other things. There is no real choice because our psyches have been pre-determined into accepting the small little tiny wee box that has been attributed to our life. Our psyche is always opportunistic and it always goes the way the wind blows. Even a simple accident, like an unwanted pregnancy, the result of a negligence as for preventive protection, the result of going out bareback when it is well known we are supposed to go out covered, if we want to really have a choice, becomes the direst tragedy of all times. But we are in such a formatted life that we forget something because "they", the big brothers of this brave new world, have mesmerized us into forgetting. There is no simple way out, there is no way out at all. Any attempt at trying to evade the consequences of this event will lead to an even worse catastrophe, like death, or suicide, or death by suicide or suicide by death. Tragic indeed. I will also add that the main two actors are outrageously outstanding. They play their anger, their disorientation, their psychoses, their schizophrenias even with such realism and conviction that we may think they are playing their own roles, their own parts, their own private fate and destiny. It is true the cameraman is also quite prodigious. The way he takes the profile of Di Caprio when this one is supposed to be stubbornly refusing any move brings out this stubborn-ness revealed by the very line of the forehead seen under that profile angle, a Neanderthal or apish profile indeed. It is such details that make an actor and a film remarkable. It is true too that the insane, deranged son of the real estate agent is truer than nature, more prophetic about this society than all the Bibles of the world, than all the Freuds and Marxes of this low, low world of ours.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines, CEGID</p></br><a href="../users/A1TUVJBY0X4M5O.html">A1TUVJBY0X4M5O</a><br/><p>"That's it?  I'm Picking the Movie Next Time...", said a woman three rows behind me, rather loudly, as the credits began to roll.  I think that if, instead, it had gone 5 minutes longer and ended with a tear-flowing, apology-laden embrace...that she would have been satisfied.  She missed the entire point of the film...probably on purpose.<br /><br />I came into the movie expecting it to be a warning to all those thinking about marriage.  Basically, the main characters are stuck.  Stuck together.  They've got the house, the kids, the car, the white picket fence.  But then what?  They aren't happy.  They try to think of a way to escape...but both of them know it wouldn't work.  There is no way for them to be happy together.  There is a "crazy guy" in the movie, fresh out of the psych-ward who acts as the voice of truth.  Of blunt truth.  He's the only truthful character in the movie.  Everyone else lies to themselves and plays the "happy suburbia" game.<br /><br />I know people like this.  They married young under societal and family pressures.  Got their car.  Got their house.  Got their kids.  Got their white picket fence.  But...they aren't happy.  They're stuck.  Can't change careers.  Can't go back to school to pursue something interesting to their soul.<br /><br />Not one single character in the movie is happy.  Actually the thing that seems to scare the characters most is the possibility of seeing someone else achieve the happiness they cannot.  As long as everyone is "in this together" (misery loves company), then they won't have to feel bad about themselves.<br /><br />A lot of people will see this movie and distance themselves from it, just like the characters in the movie did with the main couple:  "Gee, what's wrong with them?  Why do they choose to be depressed?  Why can't they just be happy?  They've got food in their bellies and a place to live.  I'm glad I'll never/didn't end up like them."  This kind of person is doomed to end up like these characters.  The money, the kids, the possessions...these things don't make a person happy.  The main characters compromised themselves, compromised their dreams and ambitions in order to have these things.  And it destroyed them.<br /><br />I think it speaks volumes that when the crazy character speaks...the audience roars in laughter.  But he's just speaking the honest truth, brutally blunt as he is.  It shouldn't be funny.  It shouldn't be strange.  It's ironic that if his character wasn't crazy, and still said these things, that it probably wouldn't be accepted by the audience as a plausible character.  We're all so used to lying to ourselves and others that seeing someone speak blunt truth is uncomfortable, and wildly outside of normal societal conventions.  So we laugh to release the tension.<br /><br />I have friends and family that are destroying themselves in different ways.  Gambling.  Obesity.  Infidelity.  Not seeking medical attention when they obviously should.  Others not taking their medication.  It would be great if this crazy character could visit these people for me and speak the truth.  Maybe wake them up.  Help save them...before it's too late.  And I would like to be that character for them.  But it wouldn't help.  As the crazy character in the movie states:  "Emptiness and Hopelessness" is what they're stuck in.  And any attempt I could make to shake them out of that would be met with the same violent rage and indignation as DiCaprio's character in the film.  If I tried anything I would become an unwelcome pariah.  Realistically there is nothing I can do.<br /><br />This movie re-enforced what I've always felt.  Whether you're happy or not is your own damn fault and no one else's; a lesson that very few people ever learn.  You need to do whatever makes you happy.  Chase that.  Live that.  Never compromise that for anyone or any reason.  Period.  The second you stop living for yourself is the second you stop living, and start destroying yourself.  But introspection, "knowledge of self", is the most important thing you need to be truly happy; to stop lying to yourself and see the truth clearly.<br /><br />This movie would be good companion viewing with "It's a Wonderful Life".  It's like the anti-Capra film.  Jimmy Stewart's George Bailey did everything we're told to do.  Everything all our lives we're told is right.  Everything that should give a man true happiness.  He sacrifices his dream (see the world, etc.), in order to serve his family and community by working for the family business in a job he hates and resents.  The sad truth is, the real-life townsfolk of Bedford Falls would have been indifferent to George's situation (reacted as Potter expected them to), and the real-life George Bailey would have ended up at the bottom of that river.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I think I might make both of these films a yearly viewing ritual, to make sure I've got my life priorities in order.  To make sure I'm not lying to myself.  To make sure I'm not lying to others for my own benefit or to their detriment.  To make sure I'm not living my life to live up to the same pipe-dream (i.e. "American dream") lies.<br /><br />You know, the more I write this review, the more I admire Revolutionary Road.  Originally I was going to write 2 or 3 lines on this flick and give it three stars.  But I found an awful lot to chew on...</p></br><a href="../users/A2R1HAXRNU0QX7.html">A2R1HAXRNU0QX7</a><br/><p>Hollywood seems to like to explore the idea that American suburbia is a cultural, spiritual, moral and BORING wasteland.  How many times have we seen this shot:  A camera on a crane is overlooking a typical street in a typical, cookie-cutter subdivision...when all the cars full of all the people leaving for work back out of all the garages at the same moment...and they're all the same make & color of car?  Ha ha!  That was funny the first dozen times I saw it.  It's even a big part of the opening credits for WEEDS.  And in more "serious" movies, denizens of suburbia are all burnt-out middle management types, with bored wives who no longer love or lust for their spouses, and they've all got kids who are spoiled brats, firestarters, druggies or kids trying to GET AWAY from all the BS and phoniness.<br /><br />It's a VERY tired idea, and from viewing the trailers for REVOLUTIONARY ROAD, it sure looked like Sam Mendes was going to travel that road again...a road recently covered by the excellent MAD MEN.  It looked like Mendes' own AMERICAN BEAUTY, but without a sense of humor and set in the `50s.  But my wife and I finally dragged ourselves anyway, because Kate Winslet is too good to miss.<br /><br />In some ways, the film DOES imply that the sameness of suburbia and the drudgery of taking a train "into the city" for work kills the soul and deadens the creative spark.  We see familiar scenes of New York City middle-managers trudging from the train station, all with identical suits, ties & briefcases.  They all smoke.  They all drink.  They all cheat on their wives.  They all look utterly miserable and bored...hopeless.<br /><br />I happen to know that folks CAN live in suburbia, and commute a great distance AND be happy.  I know that people who live IN a bustling, alive, creative city can be miserable.  The old clich&eacute; "home is where the heart is" is true.  I've endured long drives every day to work so my young family could have a house on a quite street with a decent backyard.  I hated my drive...but I loved coming home.  I know a lot of people like that...Hollywood just chooses to believe they can exist.  In these kinds of films, the friends and neighbors living the same lifestyle are all equally unhappy.<br /><br />In REVOLUTIONARY ROAD, Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio are young citydwellers who meet at a very artsy looking party, probably in the Village.  They fall madly in love...but we leap forward a few years, and they're living in suburbia (in a gorgeous house, I might add) and have a couple of young children.  All their dreams of living in Paris are dead.  DiCaprio goes to a job he clearly hates (and in which he's clearly asked to actually DO very little).  Winslet is the stay-at-home mom who is going just a little  crazy.  She's bored with her life, but is also terrified that she and her husband are WASTING their potential and falling out of love with each other.<br /><br />They have some spectacular verbal battles, doing lots of psychic damage to each other.  Yet Winslet is fiercely determined to break the cycle and she concocts a crazy plan.  Sell the house, quit the job, grab the savings and move to Paris.  Winslet will work as a secretary and DiCaprio can spend a few months "finding out what he really wants to do."  My goodness, if that isn't an invitation for extended navel gazing, I don't know what is!  DiCaprio agrees to the plan, and the couple begin to make plans to unravel their domestic situation.<br /><br />A few complications arise, of course...some dramatic and some rather subtle.  They couple reconciles, falls apart, reconciles, etc.  It's all impeccably staged and acted.  It feels like a play, in fact.  The overall production is lovely, but has a fussiness to it that keeps the movie from ever letting loose.  It's almost like the indictment of suburban ennui had inflicted the movie with a lackadaisical sensibility.  It's carefully put together, but has only moments of true life bursting in it...otherwise it feels too observational and not immersive.<br /><br />But interestingly, it emerges not so much as an indictment of suburbia as a whole, but as almost an exploration of delusion or even mental illness.  I won't tell you WHOSE illness...although you can probably guess anyway.  We all like to think we're a little special...but most of us don't think we're spectacularly special.  What if we did?  What if we genuinely believed we were living amongst ignorant clods who couldn't possibly understand how special and full of bright, shining greatness we are?  Wouldn't that drive us a little crazy?  Wouldn't we scheme to escape?  And when escape becomes an obsession, and "real life" conspires to hold us back...just how would we respond?  That's what REVOLUTIONARY ROAD was actually about to me (not sure if that's what Mendes wanted, but that's what I got).  The ability of some people to delude themselves constantly that life is meant to be better and more exciting for them, if only they could be somewhere else.  That happiness and fulfillment are there for the taking...somewhere else.  That the grass is always greener, not on the other side of the fence, but on the other side of the globe.<br /><br />DiCaprio gives a fine performance (not great) as a man who has somewhat resigned himself to a life of mostly drudgery, with only occasional bursts of joy.  He still looks like a kid, and middle-class gravitas does fit him easily.  But his performance is sincere.  Winslet, big surprise, is incandescent.  She is a character who is easy to dislike, and doesn't care.  She's selfish, vibrant, intelligent and angry.  Unfortunately, sometimes her dialogue in particular (DiCaprio's too) is SO stagey that even with her talent, she doesn't always come across as flesh-and-blood.  These characters scream EVERYTHING at each other...the writer just didn't believe in letting anything roil under the surface...it all needed to spew out.  So while the fight scenes are great in a way...they also feel like scenes, and not snippets of real lives.<br /><br />There is a wild, crazy exception to all this fussiness.  You've probably seen that Michael Shannon (excellent in BUGS, among other solid roles) was nominated for an Oscar for his role here.  He plays the son of a Winslet & DiCaprio's real estate agent.  He's a mathematician who is mostly confined to an asylum.  Mom brings him round to meet the "nice young couple" for lunch, and he is immediately wise to them.  He sees their unhappiness and he articulates it to them.  In his first appearance, his honesty is seen as refreshing to the couple...and affirmation that they are RIGHT about their plans.  Yet later, when things have ceased going so well, he spends another meal with them...eviscerating both of them as neatly as a surgeon might excise a mole.  His character is difficult to believe on an academic level...yet Shannon brings an unexpected zest to his character.  He's a fussy kind of man (just as the movie is fussy), but he's unfettered by propriety, eager to make everyone around him uncomfortable by bring out the truth.  While it does feel like a device to explain to the audience what we already sort of know...Shannon is riveting nonetheless...he literally steals the show from his far better known co-stars.<br /><br />It's no surprise that REVOLUTIONARY ROAD ultimately was almost excluded from Oscar contention.  It's just a little too carefully crafted and full of itself to entirely work.  Yet is it still a fascinating character study, and a movie journey worth taking.  It actually does have some surprises up its sleeve.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MYUI8IT6UBUU.html">A2MYUI8IT6UBUU</a><br/><p>If you ever think life can't get any worse, leave it to the movies to introduce you to characters whose despondent situations far surpass your own. Such characters thrive in Revolutionary Road, a film whose outlook reaches so far into a realm of stifling depression that the result is exhaustion. If only we could care for these people in some way, if only we could sympathize or connect, then their suffering might not have been wasted on uncaring eyes. If only.<br /><br />For April (Kate Winslet) and Frank (Leonardo DiCaprio) it's love at first sight, and shortly after the seemingly inescapable rut of repetition. Frank assumes the dreary day job as a businessman sleepwalking through mindless work days, womanizing the new secretaries, and purposely slacking in his duties. April is the stay-at-home mother, trapped by her responsibilities and the sinking feeling that her life isn't being lived to the fullest. As the couple plots a course to a new life in the utopian Paris, harsh realities replace desperate dreams and difficult choices steadily destroy their chances at breaking free from the sordid existence they've created.<br /><br />There really isn't anything to like about Revolutionary Road. The characters are all depressing, dysfunctional and annoying - but most of all they're presented in such a way that sympathy is practically out of the question. As April spirals into insanity and Frank broils out of control, the only sensibility comes from the clinically loony John (Michael Shannon) who is so obnoxious that even his explanation of their situation is troubling. The two children, who might also be used to muster sympathy, are frequently away, further disconnecting audiences from the crumbling leads. It's as if we are supposed to despise everyone in the film, responding with nothing but negativity toward their failures and shortcomings.<br /><br />The dialogue is lacking as well, making Leonardo and Kate look as amateurish as their turns in Titanic. Some may argue that they're accomplished actors in their primes and that their performances are worthy of distinction - but even the climax of the film is laughable, along with nearly every sequence in which they bicker and yell. And their arguing takes up the majority of the runtime, making this incredibly dialogue-heavy melodramatic mess all lemons and no sugar. At several points Revolutionary Road is so ridiculously funereal it's funny. It's a movie that will make audiences reevaluate the worst performances and films of the year. Maybe it will also cheer up those viewers who can give thanks that their lives are not this socially impaired - or hit too close to home for others.<br /><br />- The Massie Twins</p></br><a href="../users/AQZH7YTWQPOBE.html">AQZH7YTWQPOBE</a><br/><p>Kate Winselt and Leondaro DiCaprio, that same duo that brought you <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000JLWW">Titanic</a>, now star in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001KZIRKE">Revolutionary Road [Blu-ray</a>], a very different film. This movie isn't really a lighthearted love story, which is what I expected based upon <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000JLWW">Titanic</a>. Rather, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001KZIRKE">Revolutionary Road</a> attempts to show the struggles of a young couple seeking to break out of the traditional mold of 1950s suburbia. The premise of the movie was interesting, but it's a very dark movie and not a great date movie (my date fell asleep). Furthermore, Winselt and DiCaprio just weren't the actors to carry this out. DiCaprio is very stiff and can't get beyond being boyish, despite being 34 years old. Winselt is way too dramatic and overacts. At the end of the movie, I felt little personal connection or sympathy for either character. This movie might appeal to some audiences, but it was entirely forgettable for me.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DRKVXO300RUE.html">A1DRKVXO300RUE</a><br/><p>I did not find this movie enjoyable to watch.  Within its genre, it is probably very well done - obviously very good acting, good production values, good tension, good character development, etc.  I would like to call out the director/dop specifically, very strong camera work.  My problem though is in several other areas.  First, this is the story of a 50's family struggling with conforming to societal norms and mediocrity; they work their way back to a mid-life picker-upper, but the (SPOILER) story is obviously setting the couple up for failure.  The very predictability of the story made it less satisfying of a watch.  Second, like the Greeks of old, I watch movies as a form of entertainment and/or escapism.  While I am very happy in my life, I do feel surrounded by the types of people depicted in this film - those who feel lost in their hopelessly empty existence.  So in effect, I'm watching a movie that is nothing more than a semi-artistic recreation of the world around me...down my street.  Boring and antithetical to my motivations for watching movies in the first place.  Despite my disdain, though, I must say that Kate Winslet deserved her recognition, and is an outstanding actress, and her husband did an outstanding job of directing.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZOF747O5EB6R.html">A1ZOF747O5EB6R</a><br/><p>I suspect that many people watching "Revolutionary Road" will expect to see some sort of romantic comedy.  Put Leonardo DiCaprio together with Kate Winslet and would it not be reasonable to expect something romantic?  Nothing could be further from the truth.  "Revolutionary Road" is often confronting.  It deals with tough themes within an unsettled marriage.  It is anything but romantic.<br /><br />Based on the novel by Richard Yates, "Revolutionary Road" is set in 1950s Connecticut.  Frank Wheeler (DiCaprio) is a young company man trying to make a way ahead for his wife and two kids.  He works for the same company that previously employed his father in New York.  He is bored.  However, his wife, April (Winslet) is beyond boredom.  She is quite depressed and hates her lifestyle.  This is unfortunate as her lifestyle would be the envy of so many people.  The family is well off and there are two happy children.<br /><br />It is the interaction of husband and wife that forms the basis of the film.  At times, this can be extremely discomforting to the viewer.  Yet it always seems plausible.  The characters have cred.  The film's ending is also traumatic.  Don't go looking for a happy reconciliation between husband and wife.<br /><br />Notwithstanding the film's troubling theme, "Revolutionary Road" is worth the effort.  The viewer is rewarded with a gritty insight to a dysfunctional family.  Both DiCaprio and Winslet are excellent in their roles.</p></br><a href="../users/AJRFZ0VZ0LD26.html">AJRFZ0VZ0LD26</a><br/><p>April and Frank and seemingly happy, handsome and successful suburban couple living in the well off suburbia during 1950s.  Their lives however, seem to be gloom: we see Frank following hordes of people to the train station that takes him to his miserable job in NYC where he sits in dreadful cubical.  April is stay at home wife, surrounded by every day mundane work and endless care for their two young children.  Their quiet disatisafction culminates with Frank's 30th birthday when he has an affair with the secretary from his firm and April's own desire to reconnect with her own youth and her unfulfilled dreams.<br /><br />On the whim, they decide to start new life in Europe.  They want to break with all social conventions of the time and reconnect with each other and find their own dreams in the process.  But as life never goes according to the plan, neither does their pact to go to Europe.  Outside world and social conventions continue to interfere, until it all falls apart. Irrevocably.<br /><br />Cast in the film is amazing.  Winslet and DiCaprio make great couple on the screen together and it is wonderful to see them together after their initial match in "Titanic".  Both are a little bit older and a whole lot better as actors.  Their supporting cast is out of this world too.  All of them.</p></br><a href="../users/AFFVUZEGP1FDQ.html">AFFVUZEGP1FDQ</a><br/><p>"Revolutionary Road" is a poignant and thought provoking film about a young married couple living the so-called American Dream. Frank has a job as a salesman in New York City, April is a housewife and mother with unrealized dreams of being an actress. Moving to Paris seems to be the solution to their stagnant lives. But, comfort, fear and the inability to blindly leap proves to be the catalyst that makes them reach their boiling point.<br /><br />Frank and April always thought they were above it all, above the suburban lifestyle, that they were special and this was just a stop on the road to something marvelous. Then, they start to confront the idea that they are just like anyone else, that this is their life now and forever and that they have and are living a frustrated and unrealized life. Frank and April feel trapped in their suburban life. They resent the job, the house and also their marriage. Their unfulfillment and general unhappiness lead to explosive quarrels that little by little corrode the couple's relationship. The movie was raw and honest, delving deeply into a relationship and the idea of living a compromised life. Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio were nothing short of astounding in their performances and the movie itself was perfectly and artistically shot. 4.5 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A18G7GG53G2X8A.html">A18G7GG53G2X8A</a><br/><p>It begins so innocently: A young man and a young woman glace at each other and immediately want to close the distance between them and get better acquainted. Such a moment can be found in James Cameron's "Titanic" early in the film, when the characters played by Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet first notice each other despite being separated by deck levels and social status. A very similar moment can be found at the beginning of Sam Mendes' "Revolutionary Road," and interestingly, it features the same two actors. Their characters see each other for the first time at a local party, and they're separated more by life goals than by stature. As wonderful as "Titanic" is, it's an escapist entertainment, a sweeping, epic romantic fantasy. "Revolutionary Road" is smaller, subtler, and painfully real. We know this because the youthful, na?ve love the characters share at the start disappears by the next scene, at which point they're already married and having a terrible fight.<br /><br />Based on Richard Yates' novel, "Revolutionary Road" is a brilliant, unflinchingly honest examination of suburban life in 1950s America, where the outward appearance of domestic happiness meant everything to the average married couple. It tells the story of a corporate employee named Frank Wheeler (DiCaprio) and his stay-at-home wife, April (Winslet), who live in a picturesque but boring Connecticut neighborhood. Despite the fact that Frank hates his job, he's content to stick with it, knowing that he's expected to provide for his family. This isn't to say that he doesn't let himself go from time to time. Early in the film, he has an affair with a young secretary. The fascinating thing is that both of them seem so casual about what they're doing; if they regret their actions, they certainly don't show it. There isn't even a spark of emotion as he leaves her in a motel bed, asserting that she was swell.<br /><br />April, on the other hand, yearns for something more out of life than just living in a suburb and raising her two children. Years ago, she was an aspiring actress. Now, she's in a domestic trap as a wife and mother. On the night of Frank's thirtieth birthday, she makes a radical suggestion: They should all move to Paris in the fall. Once there, she will get a secretarial job while Frank will be allowed to figure out what he actually wants to do with his life. It takes a little convincing, but Frank agrees, and for a time, his relationship with April improves. But it isn't long before life starts getting in the way. For one thing, absolutely no one takes their plan seriously, especially their neighbors, Shep (David Harbour) and Milly Campbell (Kathryn Hahn), who seem genuinely hurt by their wanting to leave. But truth be told, there is something a little phony about the glow that surrounds Frank and April, as if the idea is more appealing than actually moving.<br /><br />There's more holding them back, of course, but I won't say what. I will, however, take the time to describe a subplot featuring another "Titanic" alumnus, Kathy Bates. She plays Helen Givings, the realtor who sold the Wheelers their house on Revolutionary Road. Even though she doesn't have much screen time, it's surprising just how much we learn about her. On the outside, she's polite and upbeat, with a pleasant face and charming smile. On the inside, she's judgmental and, in some ways, just as desperate as April. Her son, John (Michael Shannon), has just been released from a mental hospital, and as part of his rehabilitation, he begins spending time with the Wheelers. In the same way the blind Tiresias is able to see the truth about King Oedipus, John is the only character in "Revolutionary Road" with a firm grasp on Frank and April. But as insightful as he is, there does come a point when the truth really hurts.<br /><br />What I really loved about this movie was the meticulous attention to dialogue. Every line in this movie felt natural, going not for obvious dramatic statements but for realistic outbursts of anger, hurt, and frustration. Even the quieter moments have an intensity all their own, as when Frank sits with the secretary at a restaurant; in that pivotal scene, he expresses--probably for the first time--the disappointment he feels for turning out exactly like his father. At the same time, there's an air of epiphany in his voice, as if he realized right then and there that he was never meant to be anything more than an office worker. Writer Justin Haythe evokes powerful emotions in his screenplay, and he does so without being condescending or clich&eacute;.<br /><br />Of course, well-written screenplays are only half the battle--you need talented actors to make the dialogue work. DiCaprio and Winslet have such believable onscreen chemistry, especially as their characters descend into a seemingly never-ending cycle of shouting matches. They fight so well, as if they were an actual married couple. After having eleven years to mature as performers, they may in fact be better than they were in "Titanic." One wonders what would have happened had the ship made it to America and Jack and Rose had gotten off together. Would the fairy-tale romance eventually end? Would they grow up to be as unfulfilled as Frank and April Wheeler? "Revolutionary Road" is such an amazing film, superbly cast, expertly plotted, and emotionally compelling, a sobering reminder that what we want doesn't always coincide with what we get. Even the cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me of 2008--like "Changeling," "Gran Torino," and "Frost/Nixon"--are not as good as this film is.</p></br><a href="../users/A18GP1PWVTKXQQ.html">A18GP1PWVTKXQQ</a><br/><p>Instead of blaming Hollywood for their self-congratulatory tales of suburban angst, why not blame a gullible public? For it's the public that laps these specious and false tales up. Why was 'The Graduate' such a success? Because it gave the average person the right to feel that 'I'm better than you'. It's easy to sneer at a Mrs. Robinson, an adult woman who manipulates the emotions of Dustin Hoffman's 'innocent' college student, Benjamin. She's willing to ruin not only his life but that of her daughter's. Her narcissism knows no bounds. In a nutshell, she's a character who's easy to hate. Hollywood has the formula down pat: give us an innocent rebel who 'doesn't fit in' and have him/her pitted against the 'monster'--the hissing mustachioed villain of 19th century melodrama has evolved into the 'conformist' post-war suburbanite.<br /><br />In Revolutionary Road there is nary a laugh to be heard throughout the entire 118 minutes of the film. No one seems to like themselves at all. At the film's beginning, the suburbanites' community theater production is a complete failure. And the worst performance in the play is given by our protagonist, Kate Winslett's April Wheeler. Heaven forbid people can have fun performing in a community theater production or even laugh at themselves if the production is a little off. No, the point is made from the outset that our community of post-war suburbanites is one of 'hopelessness' and 'emptiness'. This is the profound 'epiphany' that the makers of Revolutionary Road want us to experience and they are going to reveal these 'profound insights' to us. But the truth is, there is no such thing as suburban 'angst'--back then and now the vast majority of people have egos--in short, they like themselves!<br /><br />Those who have written negative things about Revolutionary Road seem to agree that there is little character development when it comes to April Wheeler. When Helen Givings (Kathy Bates) tells April that she always felt she was someone 'special', the camera comes in close and we see the blank expression on her face. April is not to be blamed for her depression--society has made her into what she is. It's a trite idea that people are not responsible for their own lives but that's what Revolutionary Road serves up here. April is a Bohemian, a free spirit whose main goal is to move to Paris. For half the movie, her plan of liberation is about the only thing we find out about her. Certainly we find out nothing about her personality vis-&agrave;-vis her children--they are barely seen in this film and can be best thought of as a set of props in this overblown passion play.<br /><br />Additional 'props' can be found in the characters of the Wheelers' neighbors, Shep and Millie Campbell. When April and Frank tell them of their plans to move to Paris, they later deride them in the comfort of their own bedroom as "immature". The film's scenarists wish us to identify them as being arrogant and part of the overall suburban 'emptiness'. Shep loses further points when he beds April just before her final breakdown.<br /><br />One wonders why Frank is so easily convinced by April to chuck his house and job and run off to Paris with her and the kids. After all, he screams at her for her illusions of becoming a great actress in the opening scene. But somehow she appeals to his earlier idealistic desires to be free and independent before the kids came along. In the blink of an eye, the empty and uncaring suburbanite who has no compunctions about bedding the new pretty office worker suddenly is transformed into a caring, self-actualized mensch who will go along with his wife's bold plan to go where no other suburban couple has gone before.<br /><br />Don't despair, Frank returns to his vile ways quite soon enough. With a job promotion hanging over his head and the news that April is pregnant, he decides to 'sell out'. Aha, we've finally found out who the antagonist is in this film! Fortunately there is one bright note in Revolutionary Road and that is Michael Shannon's electroshock victim, John Givings. John is basically an ally of April since they both don't fit into society and are labeled as deviant (note that at one point, Frank recommends that April see a shrink!). Before Frank 'sells out', he and April have a nice 'heart-to-heart' talk with John in the woods who echoes the film's theme: people in suburbia might 'get' emptiness but April and (pre-sell-out) Frank 'feel' hopelessness. The non-conformist blesses the free-spirit couple for their 'bravery'. But once Frank takes the new job and decides not to go to Paris, he is the recipient of John's full wrath. A real person would have parried John's blows with perhaps a sense of humor, but since Frank is merely a stand-in for all the ills of suburbia (and hence American society), he comes off as arrogant, defensive and with a severe anger management problem.<br /><br />The only truly enjoyable moment in Revolutionary Road is when John turns on April for a millisecond. After berating Frank, he whispers in HER ear and tells her in effect that maybe she's no great shakes either! The suggestion that maybe April is not an angel is short-lived. Before you know it, April has done herself in by means of a self-induced abortion. Our beloved bohemian is now enshrined as sacrificial lamb.<br /><br />Ironically, Revolutionary Road is well-acted and directed. What's more the art design of the film, with its attention to period detail, is a work to behold. The score, while repetitious, is also haunting. But somehow the histrionics of the principal characters do not impress since people are not like that in real life. Stories about people living 'lives of quiet desperation' is not only a myth but 'old hat'. The 'Road' is more empty than the mythic society it creates and attempts to tear down.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>Having been a huge fan of the novel, and being totally in love with any and everything `Kate Winslet', it's needless to say that I was really, really anticipating this film all year long.  The trailer (complete with the operatic score) just made my skin crawl with excitement.  As the Oscar season progressed and I watched this film get repeatedly snubbed I began to worry, but my interest and anticipation did not dwindle.<br /><br />And then I saw the film.<br /><br />`Revolutionary Road' is really a mixed bag of tricks, with a lot going for it, but enough working against it to keep it from becoming the brilliant drama it should have been.  The novel, one of my personal favorites, reeks of humanity and blunt honesty, and while the film carries with it a genuine awkwardness, it's overt obviousness can at times take away from the message Yates was trying to provide us.<br /><br />The film tells the story of Frank and April Wheeler, a young suburban couple living in the 50's who loathe their lives.  They are stuck in a nice house on a nice street littered with nice people.  They have nice kids and Frank works at a nice job and they are basically sick of the existence they've pigeonholed themselves into.  They want to be free, free from the generalities that make their life so loathsome.  The point is that while their life appears to be perfect, it is that perfection that drives them crazy.  It is that perfection (and their growing distain for their lack of spontaneity) that has driven a hole into their marriage and caused them to attack one another, picking at their faults and growing to detest the very sight of one another.<br /><br />Be forewarned; `Revolutionary Road' is one of the bleakest films released in recent memory.<br /><br />In a stroke of desperation, April suggests that Frank quit his job and move the family to Paris, where he would be free to find himself while she supported him and the children doing secretarial work.  Despite the mixed reaction from friends and workmates, Frank seems keen on the idea.<br /><br />But is he?<br /><br />Sam Mendes manages to do a lot of justice to Richard Yates' novel, I cannot fault him there.  His style of direction, from the choice in music to the graceful way he captured the era within the actors, was completely complimentary to the source material.  I was in awe of almost every frame, each one just as beautiful as the next.  That had a lot to do with the costume design as well, and the set pieces are glorious.  I loved the crisp whites and overall brightness of most the scenes; the open rooms within their home splattered with yellows and creams and basically adding to the idea that it is the cheery normality of it all that is the evilest creature.<br /><br />This is a story about loathing complacency.<br /><br />The acting for the most part is stellar.  Kate Winslet slips in very easily here, and while it can be said that she has done this role before I don't think that she has ever done it so well.  She is a pro, there is no denying that.  Leonardo DiCaprio feels slightly awkward in scenes, as if he isn't sure he knows how to get a full handle on his character; but when he is really needed in order to sell a scene (that brutal fight sequence towards the films end for one) he really nails it.  It's a slightly uneven performance, but there is more good than bad here.  I was more impressed with David Harbour, who plays Shep, the Wheeler's neighbor.  I remember when I read the novel I was really drawn to Shep's quiet yearning for April, and his total feeling of loss.  Harbour nails that.  I would have much rather seen him garner an Oscar nomination over Michael Shannon, who did was he was asked to do but nothing more.  Shannon, in his portrayal of the mentally unstable John Givings, plays `crazy' the way crazy is always played.  I really wanted him to layer this character, since it is within this character that the Wheeler's whole world is brought to fruition.<br /><br />He just didn't do that for me.<br /><br />This is where the films primary flaw lies.  Within the Wheeler's dealings with John and his parents (gloriously played by Kathy Bates and Richard Easton) their whole existence, motives and underlying feelings towards each other, is unveiled.  In the novel, while it is almost delivered in the same manner, it appears more subtle and discreet.  No one likes to be browbeat, and so Yates, while maintaining the bluntness with which he treated his characters from the novels beginning, managed to tell us what was `really' going on without `telling' us.  In the film adaptation the same structure is used, but Shannon's delivery of each line feels far too brutish for it to really make an impact.  There is no feeling of mystery or emotional reveal.<br /><br />He yells, they react, we get the picture.<br /><br />Had Shannon toned down his approach and actually `lived' that moment as apposed to `act' it, we would have felt something close to what Yates captures on the printed page.<br /><br />In the end, `Revolutionary Road' is well worth seeing.  The film is harsh, very harsh, and there are no happy endings so don't wait up for them.  This is a film in vein of the novel, truly capturing the harrowing realities of a marriage on the rocks.  This is honest, brutally so, and thus it is not for everyone.  Many people want to escape the realities of life in film, and if that is your intent then stay far away from `Revolutionary Road'.  If, on the other hand, you like to experience film in order to reveal truths about yourself and those around you, then by all means, see this movie.  It will not leave you feeling warm all over.  It will most likely make you squirm in discomfort and break down into tears and leave you in a state of misery (my wife balled her eyes out and lost sleep), but the films honesty is nearly unrivaled.<br /><br />Despite a few flaws it is intelligent, engaging and unforgettable.</p></br><a href="../users/A3A4WQL80WOTMH.html">A3A4WQL80WOTMH</a><br/><p>That would be my take on it.  I found this movie, first of all, watchable.  It made me ask questions as I watched, questions about what it means 'to be someone', what it is she actually hoped to be, and how she thought moving to Paris would help her realize that.  The desire to 'come alive' is often achieved through travel or a drastic change of some kind and I can fully understand wanting to escape the suburbs and the hometown - so on one level I could relate. Not to mention that divorce and abortion were were both taboo in the 50s (when the movie seems to be taking place). It becomes a chessboard of tangled issues developing and playing against each other as the story progresses.<br /><br />DiCaprio and Winslett did a good job acting in this as well and their dialogues pulled me in.  DiCaprio is sometimes hit and miss for me.  I liked him in "Catch Me If You Can", another 50's piece, and in this one I also found him more or less sympathetic (and fairly believable).  The character of the insane/truth-telling son of the housing agent was an added plus and helped really bring out the issues in the film.  It ended nicely too I thought and left me pensive.  I don't think this movie is simply about agreeing or disagreeing with the course the characters take (although that is inevitable) but rather seeing the very familiar attitudes and needs which spurn them on on their way.  The extremity to which she takes things is what makes you really think about it and (probably) come to your own more healthy conclusions.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KEZLJ59C1JVH.html">A3KEZLJ59C1JVH</a><br/><p>Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio costar in "Revolutionary Road" as April and Frank Wheeler, a typical suburban couple living a typical domestic life in 1955 suburbia. To outsiders, it appears that the Wheelers have it all: a lovely house, two beautiful children, a steady income, etc. The truth of the matter is, both April and Frank are absolutely miserable. Frank is stuck in the same stupid job his father had before him, and he doesn't think April appreciates all his hard work, which causes him to seek comfort outside his marriage in the arms of one of his floozy secretaries. Meanwhile, April is bored out of her mind with being a mother and a housewife. Desperate for a change of pace, she proposes to Frank that they pack up their kids and move to Paris in order to turn their boring lives into an adventure. At first Frank is all for the idea, until he's offered a big promotion at work. Unfortunately, the change of plans doesn't sit well with April, and the Wheelers soon find their lives headed on a downward spiral of self-destruction,<br /><br />"Revolutionary Road" is based on the novel by Richard Yates, and it is an extremely good adaptation of the book. Winslet and DiCaprio both deliver the best performances of their careers so far, definitely deserving of Oscar nominations. The film is incredibly depressing but brilliantly well-done. It illustrates the importance of following your dreams before it's too late. (Also, in my opinion, it's a wonderful pro-choice film...you will see why during the last 15 minutes.) This is definitely one of the best films I've seen in a long time, and I highly recommend it.</p></br><a href="../users/A37PV5GMP2ILJC.html">A37PV5GMP2ILJC</a><br/><p>Short Attention Span Summary (SASS):<br /><br />1.

DiCaprio is terribly miscast for this role, his baby-faced good looks making him appear far too young, bright eyed and bushy tailed to be a middle aged man with the world on his shoulders.<br /><br />Winslet, on the other hand, is perfectly cast, and totally aces her part.  Unfortunately, the character is too unlikeable, and draws little or no sympathy from the audience.<br /><br />Supporting roles are played by Kathy Bates, Richard Easton and Michael Shannon as a dysfunctional family group, and by Kathryn Hahn and David Harbour as a friendly couple.<br /><br />Far from being King of the World, this monotonous melodrama posing as a Titanic reunion should have gone down with the ship.  Points are given for the acting, the sets and the costumes, with a bonus for Winslet, who gives the only performance worth the ticket price.<br /><br />John Givings: "Hopeless emptiness.

This is a somber, dark film about a 1950's suburban couple, April and Frank Wheeler (Kate Winslet and Leonardo Di Caprio), who are ill at ease and dissatisfied with their so-called perfect life.  Frank hates the job he commutes to five days a week.  April finds her days long and empty.  Both feel life is passing them by too quickly and long for something more.<br /> They decide relocating to Paris is just the thing to energize them both.  April will get a high-paying job as a government agency secretary while Frank takes time to think about what he'd like to do.  Their savings will see them through several months.  Initially elated by their decision to uproot themselves and their two children to start a new life overseas, they meet with circumstances that create serious obstacles.<br /> The Wheelers are unhappy not so much with each other but with the feeling that their suburban life has not been the satisfying goal they expected it to be.  Winslet and Di Caprio have a number of heavy-duty verbal fights that ring true, thanks to Sam Mendes' on-the-money direction.  April is a woman trapped in a life of her own making -- a life that has let her down.  It's not as easy as chalking it up to a marriage gone sour.  She still loves Frank, and that is part of her tragedy.  She wants more for both of them, and is desperate for a way out.<br /> Michael Shannon co-stars as the son of a real estate agent (Kathy Bates) who has recently been released from a mental institution.  His character is the one person who sees things more "normal" people -- even the Wheelers -- are blind to.  Mr. Shannon was nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for this role.<br /> Bonus extras include commentary by director Sam Mendes, a making-of featurette, and deleted scenes.  The Blu-ray edition contains the biographical profile, "Richard Yates: The Wages of Truth."</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>Revolutionary Road starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet is a disturbing but honest look at a marriage on the brink of collapse. This film is drected by Sam Mendes (American Beauty), he just happens to be married to Winslet - I love how dark and unsettling this film is - the ending was uncomfortable to watch but definitely not forgettable in any sense. DiCaprio and Winslet are incredible and gifted actors, their chemistry is smoldering, don't expect a Titanic kind of film though. Probably the best film of 2008, I highly recommend it!</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio, stars of "Titanic," reunite for the first time in eleven years for "Revolutionary Road," but their new film's tone is far from romantic. That is no surprise as the film is directed by Sam Mendes, known for his "American Beauty" and "Road to Perdition," and when the critics and reviewers say "Revolutionary Road" is a depressing film, they are exactly telling you the truth.<br /><br />The real point is, however, that depressing mood comes not from the nature of the story itself - see what happened to Jack at the end of "Titanic." It was sad, but not depressing. No, the film's depressing tone comes from seeing too much of unhappy characters who choose to be depressing.<br /><br />Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio play a married couple April and Frank, who settle in a beautiful house on "Revolutionary Road" in the mid-50s. After the brief scene of April's disastrous amateur stage production, we realize their married life is not going well.<br /><br />I am not particularly against the film's vision about American dream turned nightmare. The problem for me is that "Revolutionary Road" overstates the point. The characters talk much about themselves. Their efforts are all fertile. What they do is meaningless. Life is miserable and empty. They are not happy even having affairs with someone else. OK, their life is hollow, I know, but what else does the film offer besides what we realize in the first 30 minutes?<br /><br />The acting of Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio is fine. And throughout the film we are aware that they are acting. Their acting is too good (or serious) for these characters they play, which rather belong to melodramatic world. This is why Michael Shannon (deservedly nominated for Oscar) steals every scene from them as a mentally troubled teacher, who relentlessly tells these characters what we have already known. His character has a mystery, or originality, that "Revolutionary Road" ultimately needs.</p></br><a href="../users/A3JLOIXFM75QNV.html">A3JLOIXFM75QNV</a><br/><p>Revolutionary Road begins in an almost promising manner with a seemingly content couple meeting, then sort of flash forwards into their lives to a sunny suburb where they live in a lovely home with children, and everything seems peachy.<br /><br />Unfortunetely underneath their calm exteriors, the couple, played to perfection by Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio really aren't all that happy with their lives.<br /><br />The plot is both simple and complex. The film is really about the emotions of the characters. The distrust, deception, adultery- you name it and it can be found in this film.<br /><br />It is not always pleasant to watch but you almost can't stop watching the pair of spectacular actors do their thing. If it weren't for them, I don't think the film would be as interesting.<br /><br />Truthfully, after watching it, I can't really make up my mind as to whether I liked this film or not. It is an odd type of film where really you should despise every character and their situation, and yet you find something redeaming along the way.<br /><br />The film is certainly a downer and I'm not sure of a second viewing. It is a well-crafted movie with minor flaws which don't really detract but make it that much harder to enjoy it.  It certainly makes you think and I suppose it accomplishes that much at least.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>I really hate "Revolutionary Road", the new film starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet and directed by Winslet's husband, Sam Mendes ("American Beauty", "The Road to Perdition").<br /><br />After a very brief scene showing Frank and April (DiCaprio and Winslet) meeting at a party in New York City, circa the late 40s or early 50s, the film flashes forward almost a decade and we watch as Frank and April fight about how unhappy they are living in the suburbs. April is going stir crazy spending her days in the suburbs, taking the garbage out, and Frank commutes to New York City to work in a cubicle writing sales materials for the Knox Corporation. It's Frank's 30th birthday and his entire world is crushing in on him. When he returns home, April and the two kids sing "Happy Birthday" and give him a cake, complete with lit candles. But Frank is still unhappy. April suddenly comes up with an idea. They will uproot the family and move to Paris, the only place Frank has ever felt 'alive'. She will get a job and Frank can study and read and decide what it is he wants to do with his life, what it is he is good at. When they tell the neighbors, their friends, Shep and Milly (David Harbour and Kathryn Hahn), who are even more entrenched in suburbia, their plans, Shep and Milly are not encouraging.<br /><br />At one point late in the film, very late, April turns to Frank and says "Can we just not talk about anything for a little while?" Hallelujah, sister. Maybe if they talked less during the film, there would be less fighting. Maybe we would see more of their life and the decisions that led them into this predicament. Maybe "Revolutionary Road" could've provided a scathing portrait of how two young people end up living in suburbia and are unable to cope with the limitations of such a life. Actually, in this film, that means they are dead and must make stupid, irrational decisions in an effort to live.<br /><br />In "Road", practically the entire film is about Frank and April being unhappy with each other. It makes sense that so much of the film concentrates on them; Leo and Kate are the stars and they appeared together in the number #1 money-making film of all time. I will never understand why filmmakers think it is a good idea to put two people the public love so much in a film in which all they do is fight? It just makes the entire film uncomfortable to watch and leaves a bad taste in the mouth. Exactly what every filmmaker should be striving for. The only way to make this type of story work is to show us events leading up to these arguments, to provide some sort of counterpoint, to give us a flavor of why they fell in love in the first place. Strangely, these films almost never seem to do this, skipping directly to the fighting and the fireworks.<br /><br />So it is even more perplexing when director Mendes shifts away from the action and gives us an interlude with Shep and Milly, or introduces a busybody realtor played by Kathy Bates and her mentally ill adult son played by Michael Shannon. These moments pull us away from the main story, which means we are pulled away from the constant fighting and self-loathing, which isn't a bad thing. But as a filmmaker, Mendes should not be introducing these elements unless they help to move the story forward. Concentrate on Frank and April. They are the reason we paid $12 in the first place. The scenes with Kathy Bates and Michael Shannon are particularly egregious and stick out like a sore thumb. Did Mendes really believe these characters were realistic? I get the purpose of Shannon's character, but it is always a tricky thing to introduce a mentally ill character. It is difficult to make them believable. And in "Road", Shannon isn't believable. He is as theatrical as April wants to be in her nascent acting career.<br /><br />When I initially saw the trailer for this film, I suggested it to my mother as a possible Christmas Day film. She immediately nixed it. "Oh, no. When I saw that trailer Aunt Kathy and I laughed and thought they were play acting". In a way, she isn't far from the truth. Leo's Frank Wheeler turns 30 at the beginning of the film. This prompts him to have a mid-life crisis, have an affair, loathe the sight of his wife and family, etc. Kate's April would be about the same age. This young couple is apparently very self-aware of their problems to be so unhappy at 30. Especially when neither demonstrates a real calling for some great life as an artist, writer, dancer, and the like. Generally, people experience their mid-life crisis at least a decade later. Good for them. Maybe when they grow up they'll be able to live a happy life.<br /><br />Or maybe not.<br /><br />Early on, Frank watches April performing in a play that appears to be put on by a local community theater. It doesn't go well and Frank tries to say a few encouraging words, But April is just as aware that it didn't go well and they fight during the drive home. Unfortunately, the entire film seems like kids play acting the roles their parents should be playing. DiCaprio still has amazing boyish good looks, despite a few more wrinkles, and just seems miscast as a 30 year old experiencing a midlife crisis. It doesn't help that many of their arguments devolve into each of the characters throwing multi-syllable words at each other that just don't seem natural. It makes them sound like they are regurgitating bad Freud they learned in a college course they recently completed. Worse, it makes them seem like they are spouting over written, stagy dialogue. I just never bought DiCaprio as a defeated businessman and father. In a couple of scenes, he has lunch with a few co-workers, one of whom is played by well-known character actor Dylan Baker. Baker is 15 years older than DiCaprio. I buy HIM as a disenchanted, middle aged man experiencing a mid-life crisis. DiCaprio is simply too young. Winslet fares better, but she also tends to start yelling at Frank, using words that just don't flow naturally and seem stagy and over-written, making her character seem like a little kid playing a grown up role.<br /><br />There are many, many scenes in which Frank, April, their friends and his co-workers are pictured smoking and drinking. This also seems to make both DiCaprio and Winslet seem younger than they actually are. They are acting like college kids away from home for the first time. Scotch, Bourbon, Whiskey, Gin, Rye, Beer, Wine, Cocktails? Sure. Let's try them all. Could be fun.<br /><br />"Revolutionary Road" is a trial to sit through. Wait until it comes out on DVD and rent "The Break-Up" to go with it. The perfect double bill. Just make sure you're stocked up on the anti-depressants before hitting PLAY.</p></br><a href="../users/A3RB6NQOLOBXYD.html">A3RB6NQOLOBXYD</a><br/><p>Adapted from Richard Yates first novel, Revolutionary Road exposes the adversities of a young couple living in a Connecticut suburban neighborhood during the 1950's who simply realize too late that they were never meant to be.<br /><br />Frank Wheeler (Dicaprio) and April Wheeler (Winslet) feel as though they must standout from all the other mundane and ordinary suburbanites in their neighborhood. Frank, a marketer who works for Knoxx business (equivalent to IBM in those days) machines, is profoundly miserable at his job as he diligently works in a cubicle and engages in secretarial affairs with the novice typist. April, a struggling actress, who apparently never received her big break in show biz does not like to talk about her failures.<br /><br />During the beginning of the film, we are introduced to a quick flashback of how they met at a party while they were younger; Frank exhibits his witty, charming charisma as he gives April the impression of eventually leading a spontaneous life in Paris in the future. However, the viewer only begins to find out that this was merely a sales pitch or a common characteristic of a marketer. On the contrary, April falls for it no less. Fast forwarding to the present, April now lives in an ordinary life on Revolutionary Road with Frank and her two children and receives frequent visits from her inquisitive real estate agent (Kathy Bates) accompanied with her "mentally unstable" son. April feels as though she is leading a very unsatisfying and unfulfilled life. To add some excitement in their relationship, April broaches Frank's former idea of actually pursuing a career and settling in Paris as a secretary because it simply pays handsomely; meanwhile, it will beneficially fit Frank because he can finally figure out what he wants to do with his life. Frank refuses at first because according to him it is just "unrealistic" but eventually obliges because he too feels as though they need something new and spontaneous to reinvent their relationship. Despite the neighbors and Frank's fellow co-workers disbelief in this "childish" and radical decision, things seem to go very smoothly in the Wheeler family; the house they just bought is now on sale, their belongings are packed, the children are excited, life could not be any better.<br /><br />It all seems too swell for this tragic couple, when suddenly Frank is offered a promotion at his redundant job with a higher paying position, heavier responsibilities, and more importantly a chance to be apart of something great, the computer. Frank refuses this handsome offer from his boss at first because it interferes with their big trip to Paris. On the other hand, Frank cannot resist the temptation and is drawn to stay at this job because of the attachment he has regarding his father. We learn that Frank's father has also worked at Knoxx Business Machines for 30 years. It suggests as though Frank has a yearning desire to fulfill this empty legacy. On a different note, it strongly expresses Frank's inability to change and triumph over his trepidation. This couple struggles to achieve any sort of compromise as their lays a serious conflict of interest regarding their futures. April wants a lifestyle change in Paris; meanwhile, Frank is satisfied working in a miserable occupation with a higher salary. This relationship portrays that conflict of interest incessantly; it also shows how it affects their lifestyle and how they grapple with the consequences. It is not pleasant I rest assure you. (You'll see what I mean)<br /><br />The bigger picture here is the heavy social commentary implemented in this film at almost every other scene. It reflects and exposes the culture of the 1950's, the struggles of an unhappy relationship, and the fine line between insanity and simply pure genius. It also sheds light upon questions such as what is insanity and what is mean to be medically and mentally unstable? The reality is that the real estate agent's son who is "mentally unstable" by society is the only one that possesses a real intellectual and realistic perception on the wheeler's relationship.(Go figure) The Wheeler's relationship and decisions are constantly being influenced by other people and we see this through Frank's work environment, the neighbors, and the real estate agent. April is victimized as a prisoner of culture and her difficulty of coping with the dynamics of the role of a wife during the 1950's. Some might question her role in the film and ask, well, why doesn't she just get a divorce, or leave Frank? It just wasn't that simple during that time period as it was considered taboo or dishonorable to leave or separate from your husband. April wishes she could leave the house but is drawn back to it like a magnet because she has two children, a husband, and could not possibly earn a lucrative living in those days considering the job opportunities available at that time period. In that regard, April is prisoner of the house, living in an inescapable environment. She is a prisoner living in a prison within a prison. Frank is a mere coward that cannot confront the social obstacles of change. Like April, Frank too, is a prisoner as well. Hence, my conclusion, a couple that was never meant to be.<br /><br />Personally, I enjoyed this film not because of the setting, or from the great performances, but the realism that is portrayed here in this relationship. It is quite unique in the sense that the film does not sugar coat anything. Not to be too clich&eacute;d or anything but it echoes the expression "it is what it is". In that regard it may turn some people off. I happen to cherish and embraced this message. If you like this film, check out "A Doll's House" with Anthony Hopkins. Both are excellent but sad films.  They express a similar struggle of a couple resisting to conform to society.</p></br><a href="../users/AGEIT17HENDIS.html">AGEIT17HENDIS</a><br/><p>Over the past period I have seemingly endlessly retailed the experiences of my young adulthood during the 1960s, the time of the "generation of `68". That makes me, obviously, a child of the 1950s, the time period of this very interesting movie, "Revolutionary Road" based on a book by the darkly sardonic writer, Richard Yates. I have also seemingly endlessly pointed out my experiences and the effects they had as a result of growing up among the marginally working poor in that `golden age'. I am fond of saying that I didn't know there was any other condition than being poor for a long time. Well, I did find out there was and although in my youth I would still have had a hard time relating to the story line of this film. The `trials and tribulations', then, of an upwardly mobile, prosperous young couple, the Wheelers, Frank and April, with the mandatory two charming children and a nice leafy suburban house in some nice town in Connecticut would have gone over my head. Now though I can a little more readily appreciate the seamy psychologically paralyzing side of that existence.<br /><br />As graphically portrayed in the film that seamy side (that also provided some of the most powerful scenes in the movie, and best acting moments by both Winslett and DiCaprio), the central driving force of the story), is the emptiness of middle class existence in the 1950s. Cookie-cutter is the word that came to mind as Frank and April try to break the golden bonds that keep them tied to their old life. One of the nice moments cinematically is the sequence involving Frank's routine workday morning ritual catching the train to New York City (along with all the other felt-hatted men, the symbol of success in that period). Another sober moment is when April takes out the rubbish in their deathless suburban tract and realizes that this life is not for her.<br /><br />But how to break those golden chains? The issues presented here about consumerism, meaningless and vacuous work, the isolated role of women in the nuclear family, the eternal struggle for security in an individualistically-driven society are all issues that got a fuller workout and wider airing in the 1960s (and since). In a sense the `whimsical' Wheelers were too early. They were before their time. However, although times have changed, I will bet serious money that if you go to some Connecticut train station headed to New York City on any Monday morning you will see, two generations removed and without the hats, men and women making that same meaningless trip that old Frank made. Yates was definitely onto something about the nature of modern capitalist social organization. But I will confess something, although I know better now the stresses of that fate, I would not have minded, minded at all, growing up in that little `cottage' the Wheelers called home. That, however, is a story for another day.</p></br><a href="../users/A1129LM24YWSZV.html">A1129LM24YWSZV</a><br/><p>Revolutionary Road is definitely a tough movie to watch (which strikes me as very Kate Winslet these days. Make a HAPPY movie, Kate!!), but it smacks of reality in a thought-provoking and almost gut-wrenching way.<br /><br />Winslet plays April Wheeler, a stifled suburban housewife, opposite Leonardo DiCaprio's Frank Wheeler. In the 1950s, the couple marries and moves out of the city due to an unexpected pregnancy. Their dreams of living abroad, treading the boards, etc., are pushed aside to make way for the realities of life with two kids.<br /><br />One day, April comes up with a novel idea - chuck it all and move to Paris. After some persuading, Frank agrees, and the two begin planning their adventure. As they do so, April and Frank are happier and more in love than they've been in a long time. However, another unplanned pregnancy dashes their dreams of living abroad, and their lives together crumble as a result.<br /><br />This movie is a study of two things: social mores of the 1950s and the disintegration of a marriage. Both illustrations are fascinating. Performances are more than solid (Both Winslet and DiCaprio are masterful in some of the final scenes.), and the careful recreation of 1950s suburbia is remarkable to observe.<br /><br />Worth seeing, but not if you are looking for feel-good entertainment.</p></br><a href="../users/AJMU8VVFKMZI4.html">AJMU8VVFKMZI4</a><br/><p>First I just have to say Kate Winslet just keeps getting better with time.  No disrespect to Leo, but it seemed to me that in this production that Winslet blew Dicaprio out of the water.  Dicaprio has proven he can play a wide range of characters but a '50 suit man-not so much.  It's not that he was bad, it's just that Winslet ws just so much better.  I could absolutely feel her angst even when I didn't agree with her choices.  The book is still in my TBR pile, I can't wait to get to it so see how everything stacked up.</p></br><a href="../users/A2OFSDJB3MVQ16.html">A2OFSDJB3MVQ16</a><br/><p>Just recently saw this on Blu-Ray, and unfortunately despite the casting of Winslet and DiCaprio, the film was a respectable failure.  I say "respectable" because despite Mendes' direction and the attention to the '50s setting, I felt a sense of "deja vu" to this film that I didn't have to "American Beauty".  If it weren't for Michael Shannon excellent rendering of a dysfunctional character, I would probably knock this down 2 stars but in fact his appearance gives this film the needed spark to rescue it from pure tedium.  I'm sure the book was very poetic but unfortunately it did not translate to film so well.

Today, not much has changed, and there's never a bad time to perk up and pay attention. Based upon an acclaimed book written over thirty years ago, Revolutionary Road is a study in relationships, character, and existence, most of which are illusions cobbled together by disappointments and a little bit of genuine joy. That joy keeps us going, even though we're bitter, wounded, uncertain, and keeping at bay as best we can alienation, anomie, and moral unwinding.  I'm not sure there is any filmmaker today that puts on a better show about these ideas.  Together with American Beauty, Revolutionary Road is a sure-handed dissection of all the things that make the cozy upper-middle class insufferable and, ultimately, not redeemable. We're playing house as a wonderful pass-time to avoid truly living -- so much so, that really experiencing our lives seems more and more like some wishful daydream.<br /><br />There is no joyful or redemptive ending. In comparison, American Beauty is a sweet Jolly Rancher of optimism -- which in many ways it is. Nor is it perfect. In trying to add subtlety and complexity to the characters, some clarity was lost -- but, I don't necessarily fault Mendes for that.  One thing that's for certain is that nothing is clear about life. Like Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Revolutionary Road gets into the mechanics of who we are alone and in relationships -- why we can't live with them, and can't, seemingly, live without them. And Kate Winslet, the common thread in both of those films, shines as a bright woman just looking for some peace of mind and a little stretch of happiness.<br /><br />Wonderful and intelligent, if a little studio-esque, Revolutionary Road is a smart film well worth seeing.</p></br><a href="../users/A106016KSI0YQ.html">A106016KSI0YQ</a><br/><p>Richard Yates's famous 1961 novel about the wrong side of the American dream has fascinated readers (and other writers in particular) for years because of its bleak questioning of Eisenhower-Kennedy era middle-class values. The film rights were tied up for years, and finally in 2008 this beautifully shot movie adaptation came out. In 1961 the misery of Frank and April Wheeler, an idyllic couple who have compromised their youthful aspirations to be part of the creative class in order to raise their children safely in suburbia, seemed very new and incisive. But by 2008 it's hard to work up much sympathy for Frank (Leonardo di Caprio) and April (Kate Winslet) since all they seem to do is scream at each other when they're not smugly congratulating one another on how much better they are than everyone else. They're just about irredeemable characters, and even worse is the awful, artificial conceit of the electroshock patient (the son of their realtor) who comes to their house to tell them "the truth" (as Richard Yates saw it) as to their compromises and weaknesses. Without Yates's beautiful prose to carry you along you're just left with his ideas about American life, which have not aged well and carry an appalling strain of misogyny to them (especially given April's final fate and the plot reasons for it). DiCaprio is miscast in the central role of Frank, and though he works hard, he doesn't seem adult enough to carry off the part. Winslet--intelligent and alert to everything--fares much better, although even she cannot make April very sympathetic. Michael Shannon is also as good as anyone could be reasonably expected to be in the awful role of the crazy truth-teller. The film has some terrific cinematography, but it's really not worth seeing just for that: almost everything this film has to say was done much better the year before by the AMC cable series MAD MEN (where you don't have to put up with all that screaming, either).</p></br><a href="../users/A2E0EZ8DO5YSU3.html">A2E0EZ8DO5YSU3</a><br/><p>I mean REALLY slow and plodding.  This is a snoozer.  Acting is pretty good for a script that is really lame.  I suspect this was adapted from a play.  Whoever adapted it just doesn't understand how to write an effective script for a motion picture.</p></br><a href="../users/A34D06JL7LC6MU.html">A34D06JL7LC6MU</a><br/><p>Revolutionary Road, the fourth film by Oscar-winning director Sam Mendes, reunites <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000JLWW">Titanic</a> co-stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet which is what the film really got the most press from. It scored a couple of Oscar nominations and many critics called it one of the best films of the year, but it certainly avoided a large audience. Mendes' first film <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CWL6">American Beauty (Widescreen Edition)</a> was his masterpiece and the two films he followed up with it (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JLBQ">Road to Perdition (Widescreen Edition)</a> & <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000DZIGDU">Jarhead (Widescreen Edition)</a>) were not without merit. I don't hesitate to say that this is his best film since American Beauty and is almost the film's counterpart. While American Beauty portrayed the darkly comical underbelly of suburbia, Revolutionary Road shows the tragic, claustrophobic grip of it.<br /><br />The setting is Eisenhower-era Connecticut, which is where Frank (DiCaprio) and April Wheeler (Winslet) live in a nice suburban home on Revolutionary Road. Having given up on their aspirations to raise their children, Frank works at Knox Business Machines (a job he hates) while April fills her position as housewife. Feeling smothered by the suburban lifestyle they're trapped in, April proposes that the family move to Paris. She wants to get away, but she also wants to give Frank a chance to find his passion. While their friends find the plan absurd, the Wheeler's are steadfast in their determination. But, as things begin to change, the Wheeler's see their dreams start to crumble right along with their marriage.<br /><br />Don't expect too many surprises, I warn you. The film has an ominous musical score, reminiscent of American Beauty (fitting, as the same composer Thomas Newman scored both films) that clearly foreshadows things aren't going to play out in the happiest way. On the subject of music however, there is perfectly placed '50s era music scattered throughout the movie that marvelously puts us in this timeframe. The set direction (by Kristi Zea) and the costume design (by Albert Wolsky) are both perfect in the film. The beautiful recreation of 1950's suburbia perfectly contrasts the empty attitude of the character's.<br /><br />The acting is, of course, the film's selling point. Winslet is a reliable actress that likely would've won her 2008-Oscar for this film had she not made <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PPLJIQ">The Reader</a>. Not any actress could capture feelings of emptiness and claustrophobia in this performance, but Winslet does it flawlessly. A true actress Winslet is.<br /><br />DiCaprio is one of the most successful actor's in Hollywood, but he's not without his detractors. His performance as Frank is a powerhouse of pent-up frustration and emotion. I think this is one of his best and certainly one of his most powerful performances. The two performances together are so vividly realized, you'll forget this is the "Jack & Rose reunion." They completely outshine those performances.<br /><br />With all the star-power this film has backing it, the Academy only acknowledged one performance in this film. The character is John, the adult son of the Wheeler's neighbors who has only recently been allowed to leave the psychiatric hospital he's been staying at. The actor is Michael Shannon, who has only two scenes and a small amount of screen time. Shannon impressed me in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000T5O48K">Bug (Special Edition)</a>, but I don't think he has previously been given a role that allowed him to really showcase his talent. As John, he makes quite an impression as the only person able to see right through the Wheeler's facade. He has the most powerful dialouge in the film and he is so stand-out, it's easy to see why the Academy singled him out among these other, well-known actors.<br /><br />Revolutionary Road goes deep into the inner workings of suburbia, a crumbling marriage, and the unhappiness of these people. It doesn't explore these themes subtly, but gives the audience a very clear view into them. It's based on a 48-year-old novel by Richard Yates and was brought to the screen all these years later because it's still a very relevant story. Look no further for proof than the recent, overpublicized Jon & Kate debacle. This film is not a subtle meditation, it's a realistic exploration.<br /><br />This is a beautiful, heartwrenching film...Definitely among the best films of 2008. It's powerful, effusive, and impressive considering the subject matter has the makings of a soap-opera and instead is a real human drama. While not a happy movie by any stretch of the imagination. I highly recommend this film.<br /><br />GRADE: A</p></br><a href="../users/AMNNPDX9MFEUD.html">AMNNPDX9MFEUD</a><br/><p>Just before things take a turn for the worse, Frank Wheeler (Leonardo DiCaprio) is dictating a letter. A line about inventory control underscores the heart of where he and his wife April (Kate Winslet) find themselves: "Knowing what you've got, knowing what you need, knowing what you can do without..." Those answers seemed clear until Frank second-guessed himself, tempted by offers of prestige and money. If there is one lesson I have learned in life and that I will continuously remind my children of, it is that second guessing yourself, going against what your instincts tell you, is always the wrong thing to do. Revolutionary Road is a movie about a couple who face this crossroad in life and differ as to the right direction they should take. April listens to her instincts despite the dark uncertainty of her choice. Frank follows the well-lit and safe path.<br />Revolutionary Road is a movie that splits people on either side, with those who feel it is a study in whiny, selfish, and immature suburbanites wishing for a better life than they currently have. Then there are those like me who felt a deep connection to them, in particular April; the one of the pair that seems the most trapped in the suburban dream and the one whose escape is the most critical<br />Of the two, April is largely attacked in reviews and I can't figure that out. She is the one accused of screwing things up and being the most difficult and unrealistic. Yet, she is the one who comes up with the idea to move to Paris as a gift to her husband. She is the one who realizes that "living life as if it matters" is beyond any price tag. If any one is at fault in my interpretation, it is Frank, who takes the path of least resistance and condemns his wife to a world of "emptiness and hopelessness."<br />What this movie does is give voice to the minority of people who, like Winslet's character, find themselves trapped inside someone else's dream. Some of us break through, but most stay there, slowly wilting and collapsing under the strain of denying oneself of their own needs, suppressing one's soul, and doing what you feel you are supposed to do. Understand clearly that I am not making an indictment of the suburbs et al. For most people in the world, most people I know, and most people living that life, there is not the oppressive feeling of wasting life and the angst therein. What I am saying is that there are those of us who do not feel the same way about that life choice and this movie speaks to us. It's knee-jerk to not only take offense at the dim view Revolutionary Road portrays of The American Dream, but furthermore to see the Wheelers as little more than a spoiled couple; the assumption being they have everything and still they want more. On the contrary, my opinion is that being spoiled means wanting more and yet not wanting to give up what you have. The character of April Wheeler does not want what she has and knows what she needs - not more, but something entirely different. For those who have been in her tormented shoes, Revolutionary Road is a place some of us call Hell.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />It didn't get the Best Picture nomination it deserved and Kate Winslet got a trophy for her inferior performance in The Reader, but Sam Mendes's brilliant adaptation of Revolutionary Road deserves to be recognized for the way it breathes new life into the cliched subject of American suburbia: with its perfect cast, beautifully stark cinematography, vitriolic screenplay and agonizing conclusion, this is a searing and nearly great film.<br /><br />3.5/4</p></br><a href="../users/A1POFVVXUZR3IQ.html">A1POFVVXUZR3IQ</a><br/><p>I have not read the book, so I can only comment on the movie itself. Frankly, "Revolutionary Road" is a depressing movie from start to finish. The story centers on Frank and April Wheeler, a nice couple residing in suburban CT and apparently living the American dream, not. April [Kate Winslet in a gut-wrenching performance] is a stifled personality, feeling neither joy or fulfillment in raising her two kids or in her marriage. She wishes to break free from the confines of suburbia and all that it entails, and hits upon a plan - get Frank [Leo Caprio] to give up his humdrum job, pack the family up and move to France, where she is convinced that she can earn a good living as a secretary [she keeps harping on the fact that secretaries get paid really well in Europe] whilst Frank figures out what he really wants to do.<br /><br />This is a movie about two truly lost souls - both Frank and April aren't really sure what they want, and just feel that they're missing something, which is undefined. As a viewer, it was hard for me to connect emotionally with either character, and more so April than Frank. April is a character that is so consumed by misery that she literally sets herself on a self-destructive path, but it is hard to understand why this seemingly intelligent, beautiful woman can be so unhappy. She has two lovely children whom she doesn't spend much time with [throughout the movie, the kids are either sporadically present or not at all], she takes no pleasure in her beautiful home or surroundings, she chafes in social situations [like there's someplace better she'd rather be] and just appears miserable throughout the movie [except instances where she's packing up, hoping to leave for that beacon of light, Paris]. The only thing I could come up with was that April was clinically depressed, but even then, no one reaches out to her, especially her husband. This is never touched upon in the movie [perhaps because such things were not acknowledged back in the 50s?].<br /><br />Besides the themes of an unhappy marriage and unfulfilled lives, there are other underlying themes here such as mental illness [Michael Shannon in a remarkably illuminating supporting role], abortion [back when such procedures were illegal, leading to some tragic actions and consequences], adultery, and depression. Given such dark themes, it was inevitable that "Revolutionary Road" would be such a depressing watch.<br /><br />I loved the acting - both Kate Winslet and Leo de Caprio shine in their tormented roles, as does Michael Shannon as the mentally unbalanced mathematician with much foresight. But given how disconnected I felt to the characters being portrayed, I can only give this movie 3* at best. Only recommended to those who can stomach a dark ride into the human soul.</p></br><a href="../users/A35AMPDFAB8JLT.html">A35AMPDFAB8JLT</a><br/><p>"Revolutionary Road" is brought to life by the extraordinary performances of Leonardo Di Capria (Frank Wheeler) and Kate Winslet (April Wheeler). The movie portrays a young couple who are stuck in a rut and decide at one point to make a major change in their lives and move from Connecticut to Paris. This sounds all well and good, but then various new options and obstacles begin to mount. He's offered a better paying job, and she gets pregnant, and so instead of being able to make a break for a new life the prison of their lives begins to get tighter. It is apparent early on that April is unhappy with her life. On the other hand Frank seems resigned to his vacuous life. April is frustrated with their lives and grows resentful of Frank's complacency. There is a chilling scene, the morning after their big argument, when Frank comes to breakfast. April acts like one of the Stepford wifes, behaving with utmost perfection, like a dutiful wife, as if nothing ever happened the night before. Frank seems bewildered, but relieved, and doesn't seem to think too much about what his wife's chilling transformation could mean.<br /><br />Sam Mendes (Road to Perdition, American Beauty) beautifully directs this movie, which initially seems trapped in the inertia of its all too idealized depiction of 1950's America, but then Mendes takes us down this disturbing path where everything that is too perfect, sterile and bland is revealed as a kind of prison for this couple, and this facilitates in highlighting the underlining tension between Frank and April. This is a monumental movie that takes its time in order to weave it web.</p></br><a href="../users/A1YB29BIDULEYE.html">A1YB29BIDULEYE</a><br/><p>Well, if you really feel like depressing yourself, this movie will certainly deliver. It is an interesting movie, but serious flaws are prevalent.<br /><br />The movie starts with the Kate Winslet character (April) feeling humiliation after an unsuccessful play performance. She quickly has a bitter argument with her husband Leonardo DiCaprio (Frank). We see that their marriage is having trouble at best, and at worst is already dead and waiting for the tragic inevitable end. Whatever people may think of Frank, he has a point when he says: "It's not my fault that the play was lousy."<br /><br />A flaw here is that April and Frank are both unhappy with their lives. And while April looks for an irrational escape, Frank seems more set in reality that they have 2 children as well as responsibilities. True, Frank is not happy at his job. But he's not going to 'jump ship' when he has a wife and 2 children. (One pun on "The Titanic" here is inevitable.)<br /><br />Later, April gets a strange idea to run away to France. What she says may sound good in THEORY. But how can she be sure of getting a job? Frank again carries reason when he says: "It might make more sense if I were a writer or painter."<br /><br />It is worth noting that while the movie doesn't mention it, April may very well be bipolar. The movie tries to keep sympathy balanced between the characters, but it just doesn't work. Towards the latter half, April finds that she is pregnant. And Frank knows that he has to go back to reality and accept a great promotion he has been offered.<br /><br />Whether you are anti abortion or pro choice, there is an unavoidable sting of reality when Frank says: "A sane woman doesn't perform an abortion on herself so she can live out some fantasy." April responds that it is for him. And Frank understandably responds: "How can it be for me when the mere thought of it makes my stomach sick?!"<br /><br />Frank desperately tries to save the shambled remains of their marriage, but April only gets more cruel: "I never loved you. You're just a man who made me laugh at a party." At this point, we can scarcely blame Frank for his rage here: "Then why are you living in my house? Why are you my wife?" Also to his credit, despite his rage, he is able to avoid physically striking her.<br /><br />Another serious flaw in this movie is that they try to make a cruel and nasty man carry weight. (What he says is not fit to be printed here and would probably not be allowed here.) Charles Dickens often put the voice of reason into eccentrics, but without the profanity and cruelty.<br /><br />I'm not saying the movie does not have some worthwhile moments. But the story just doesn't work. While it tries to make April heroic, it just does not work. And it seems to try to make Frank look bad for keeping one foot in reality.<br /><br />Sorry; usually lightening just won't strike twice.</p></br><a href="../users/A387BD735MI50R.html">A387BD735MI50R</a><br/><p>This movie doesn't work. It's an intellectualized, staged conception of "quiet desperation." It doesn't look or feel like real desperation. I can't imagine real people arguing this way or shifting moods this way. It's a professorial view of life that feels as if it had been written from an ivory tower, while its author looked down at an expanse of suburbia from an academic distance. All the intriguing details are invisible; only the broad patches of pattern are apparent.<br /><br />So it sees only clich&eacute;. It sees the clich&eacute; that the 1950's were unbearably conformist, with husbands swimming upstream every morning to work like doomed salmon, while wives stayed home in crisp regiments of starched aprons. But if you had looked close and lived through the 50's, you would have found a very different, motley, messy reality.<br /><br />There is also the clich&eacute; of the real estate woman's son. Michael Shannon cast in this role does a very good job as the disturbed, truth-telling iconoclast. But again, his character plays into the trite, almost sitcom presumption that people who are or who have been in insane asylums can be counted on to deliver rude insights and raw wisdom.<br /><br />There's not necessarily meant to be a clear-cut moral to this movie. However, the movie's sympathies are clearly with making a break from the life dealt to you. Director Mendes and the author of the book on which this movie is based both lean in favor of grabbing any chance to climb out of what, to them, is the inevitable rut of the workaday world. The message is that if you don't have the courage and tenacity to launch off somewhere - you'll be trapped and tragic.<br /><br />However, that is the biggest clich&eacute; of all. It overlooks the real detail of beauty inherent in the scene, in favor of the preconceived disdain of 1950's suburbia. If the Wheelers could have opened their eyes, they might have realized they had a gleaming interior, and a view of lovely dappled woods outside, in both a literal and a metaphoric sense. They might have seen that John's co-workers were affable, available beings, probably with rich back-stories of their own. They might have seen that they had a varied network of intelligent, potentially heartfelt people on their very doorstep.<br /><br />I gave this movie three stars instead of something lower because the actors do make a good attempt to elevate their characters to some social importance. However, in the end, I couldn't care about these people, because they would have been incapable of caring about me. They wouldn't even have been able to find me interesting - unless they came upon me somewhere else, in some exotic, glamorous place - such as Paris.</p></br><a href="../users/A18758S1PUYIDT.html">A18758S1PUYIDT</a><br/><p>Andaluz nails it in the review, saying that it is tiresome to watch these people fight and carry on when they really don't have it so bad.  They are so overwrought and picking fights and pushing each other's buttons that it becomes overwhelming after a very short time.  The first fight that we see, after April performs in a play, seems to come out of nowhere and to have no context.  But then, having the context and the backstory later doesn't even help all that much.  Also, the music is too loud and rather pervasive and distracting at times.<br /><br />On the plus side, the photography of the lovely yet sterile-looking homes and the washed-out faces is absolutely appropriate for the subject matter and tone of the film.  A late scene with April trying to perform a procedure on herself at home is especially haunting.  Winslet and DiCaprio can't be faulted for doing the best they can with what they're given.<br /><br />It's just hard to give much of a care about two folks who create their own problems and are their own worst enemies.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R8PXSFGY9MC2.html">A3R8PXSFGY9MC2</a><br/><p>`Revolutionary Road' is one of those films that although not especially `positive' or `happy' is very well written and acted and draws you in from the start. Following a successful couple who seem to have it all, good job, nice house, two children and a happy marriage, this film explores how all is not quite what it seems and the tensions and frustrations that simmer away beneath any marriage. The acting from both Di Caprio and Winslet is fantastic and the natural chemistry between them makes the love and fight scenes all the more potent. This film is infused with a sense of sadness throughout as you see the couple go from carefree, idealistic young adults to a confused, frustrated and angry set in their ways couple. This film also looks at how the good and bad things in life can trap you into set patterns that don't fulfil you, things like a pay rise or promotion or a pregnancy that alter your plans for the future. The fifties set pieces and costumes are great, as is the directing from Mendes and this film is a very polished affair. You won't walk away with a spring in your step, but that isn't necessary every time you watch a film, and the overall effect at the end is so powerful that this is well worth a watch. This may be deemed by some as bleak, but life isn't always a bunch of roses and it's good to see Hollywood acknowledge that for a change.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></br><a href="../users/AGQY11NLQJ2JL.html">AGQY11NLQJ2JL</a><br/><p>This movie is very close to my heart, or maybe to my dark side; contemplating many subjects like boredom, high expectations, and self destruction.

Good well fleshed out characters.  The problem is the like ability.  You have Winslet who seems to have everything a woman in the 50's could want--a nice house, handsome husband, 2 kids.  But she is incapable of being happy.  Dicaprio wants this ideal life, but he is unhappy with his job, cheats on his wife and is not very compassionate to her needs.

Mrs. Wheeler, played so convincingly by Kate Winslet, seeks escape from her illusion, and finds only submission and death.  Mr. Wheeler, played equally convincingly by DeCaprio (who is under-rated, I think, as a superb American actor of our age, perhaps the finest), finds only submission.  This is a very grown-up, complicated Beckerian movie - but, alas, a movie which does not have Beckerian overtones is nothing but fluff.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UW83R0JOZZ6.html">A2UW83R0JOZZ6</a><br/><p>"If my work has a theme, I suspect it is a simple one: that most human beings are inescapably alone, and therein lies their tragedy." - Richard Yates on his novel, "Revolutionary Road"<br /><br />The above quote gives one a pretty good idea that "Revolutionary Road" is not a simplistic or feel-good film, rather a film that dares to imply that society is na?ve, misled, too quick to conform, and that people lack the courage to do what truly makes them happy because they are too concerned with comfort and safety.  It does this through the "everyday" couple, Frank and April Wheeler, and how it does so may touch a nerve or two in those who have ignored their hearts' desires or their discontent for the sake of sufficiency.<br /><br />From the beginning, it is clear that the Wheelers' marriage is anything but happy.  They are shown meeting at a party for the first time, locking eyes across the room and then the movie swiftly centers on their present relationship in 1955, the two of them married with children and consumed by their own disillusionment.  To an outside observer, April (Winslet) and Frank (DiCaprio) are living the American dream, their comfortable lifestyle in suburban Connecticut seeming to include everything but the white picket fence.  What bubbles beneath the surface is Frank's dissatisfaction with his compliance to conformity, his identity lost in a job he could care less about in the effort to support his family.  April is equally dissatisfied with her role as a housewife, wanting something more exciting and meaningful than what everyone else is scrambling to achieve.  The disappointment with their stations in life peaks when Frank has an affair with a secretary at his office on his 30th birthday (the day after a nasty argument with his wife), only to be surprised that evening by an apologetic April who has put on a pretty dress and baked a cake.  She later stuns him with a proposal to move to Paris and Frank is dismissive of the idea at first, viewing it as nonsensical.  When April begins to appeal to his ego, telling him that she will work to support the family while he spends time finding his true vocation, he warms to the idea and the move breathes optimism and romance back into their marriage.<br /><br />Seemingly happy, the Wheelers begin telling their friends and acquaintances about their plan and are met with criticism, most deeming the move irresponsible and unrealistic.  Frank begins to cave from peer pressure and when he is recognized at work for his efforts and offered a promotion, their plans become shaky.  The clincher is April's unexpected pregnancy, an event that completely rules out Paris for Frank and has him taking the job offered to him.  Crushed by Frank's decision to keep them in the wearisome lifestyle that has made them so unhappy in the first place, April becomes cold and despondent and what hope their marriage had of repairing itself crumbles quickly and climactically.<br /><br />Great dramas ride high on illuminative dialogue and the execution of its main actors and both elements are in top form here - you'll rarely glimpse perfection like this, no matter how many films you watch in your lifetime.  There are movies I have watched where I enjoyed them but had little to say about them; "Revolutionary Road" differs in that after watching it, I can't say ENOUGH.<br /><br />Nearly everyone involved in this project was highly passionate about the material - most of them had read Yates's 1962 novel and commented on how well it was written, that it was among their favorite novels of all time.  Justin Haythe is among those people and his screenplay is outstanding - I found myself wanting to write down several lines I heard, so many of them quotable that I couldn't possibly put them all in this review (truthfully, I would love to have a copy of the entire screenplay).  Haythe borrowed heavily from the novel's own language as well as producing some wonderful material of his own, and I'm a little surprised that it didn't even get an Oscar nod ("Slumdog Millionaire" won the Best Adapted category.  Again, WHY?).  The exchanges between April and Frank teeter back and forth from sympathetic and understanding to downright spiteful - some of their remarks towards one another are so cutting at times that the viewer feels stung by them just standing on the outside listening in.<br /><br />In fact, I'm surprised that it didn't get more than three nominations total in 2008, among them Art Direction (courtesy of Kristi Zea and Debra Schutt, who brought the 1950's alive like never before - it's all in the little details) and Costume Design (I loved the majority of Winslet's wardrobe - simplistic and chic).  Perhaps the most surprising was an out-of-the-blue nomination for little-known actor Michael Shannon for his scene-stealing supporting turn as John Givings, a man who from the beginning speaks cold hard truths everyone knows but no one wants to hear.<br /><br />Master cinematographer Roger Deakins is onboard this project and his ingenuity knows no bounds.  Sam Mendes, a director who loves to play with light and shadow, has a cooperation with Deakins that produces iconic imagery with stark contrast both visual and metaphorical.  For the actors, there is no soft lens - every wrinkle, crag, scar and physical imperfection is there for the world to see, making their characters more relative and real to their audience.  For the sets, sunlight brightens a cheery and conservatively decorated living room, clashing with the cluttered darkness of the Wheeler's marriage, giving the impression that all is not how it appears.  Shooting within the house, though significantly larger than houses in the 50's typically were, was still a challenge - Deakins squeezed himself into the confined rooms, neck and neck with the actors, creating a physical and psychological claustrophobia that radiates into the story and the performances.<br /><br />DiCaprio and Winslet tear the house down as Frank and April Wheeler, their on-screen dynamic trumping that of their first collaboration in 1997's "Titanic" (of course, this film is of a completely different ilk and highly unromantic). Of their fight scenes, DiCaprio was quoted as saying, "So much of what happens between Frank and April in this film is what's left unsaid. I actually found it a real joy to do those fight scenes because finally, these people were letting each other have it."  Because he and Winslet are such great friends in real life, their portrayal of a husband and wife is highly believable and Winslet even had to take a moment to compose herself during one of their tougher scenes because DiCaprio had never been that angry and physically violent towards her before.  Though she won an Academy Award for her role in "The Reader" the same year, THIS is the better performance of the two by leaps and bounds.<br /><br />While the actors are incredible, it is their characters that one becomes so frustrated with.  Though April and Frank struggle with the restrictions of their simplistic lifestyle, it is a prison of their own making and it gets hard for one to sympathize with them after a time, particularly because of their inability to communicate in a meaningful way and to come to a compromise of which both of them can be happy.  Frank is not a risk-taker and won't squeeze out of his societal niche for the sake of leisure, while April is too impractical in her desire to change things; one will come to wonder about her state of mind not only because of her manipulation but her extreme swings between highs and lows (bipolar) throughout the film.  Knowing how difficult they were finding it to see eye to eye after a time and that their feelings for each other had diminished to a certain degree, I don't know why they felt the need to stay together.  Divorce was certainly an option for them instead of what April chooses to do later on.<br /><br />Bottom line: A dark and emotional journey through a dysfunctional marriage and how the choices we make in life can inspire or delude us, "Revolutionary Road" captures that truth of which so many of us choose to avert our eyes.  It is a film that will make a deep impact with those who thought - or knew better than - to trust our ideals.</p></br><a href="../users/A39IY0JU5JI69G.html">A39IY0JU5JI69G</a><br/><p>I went to see this film, in spite of mediocre reviews, just to see Winslet and DiCaprio.  They did not disappoint!  I sat through the whole thing just because of their amazing performances, especially Winslet's.<br /><br />However...the script is a whole other thing!  I understand, from reading other reviews here, that the novel from which the film was made was written in the late fifties and that explains a lot.  The main issue appears to be the stultifying influence of suburban life and the impossibility for any sentient being, especially one with artistic aspirations, to live a decent life there.  As we, in 2009, look at the house which poor April (Winslet) feels is her prison we groan.  Poor woman has to put up with that, and wear her nice clothes and stay home and cook for her two beautiful children and then sleep with her handsome husband.  We weep for her dilemma!  No wonder she screams all the time at the guy who goes to work every day at a job he hates in order to finance all this...<br /><br />What bothered me about the film was that it seemed that Mendes was sympathizing with April and making the husband the bad guy.  I'm a woman and I found it hard to sympathize with April at all.  The husband keeps trying to talk to her about their relationship problems and she just doesn't want to talk.  That sounds backwards to me!<br /><br />I lived through the 50's and do remember the problems that the novel is addressing.  I haven't read it but it sounds like it was a good treatise for that time.  But now, fortunately, we have evolved and the problems of these people seem really unrealistic to modern eyes.  I kept agreeing with the husband who said that they could have a happy life, yes even there in the gorgeous Connecticut suburban house that seemed to have a woods in the back yard.  A raise was coming, her husband had found something in his job that finally captured his interest, it seemed that their problems were solved.<br /><br />Another thing that bothered me was the way the children were treated.  We saw them, once, idyllically photographed through the spray of the garden hose, but they weren't around much.  April claimed to love them but we don't see much interaction with them. There was more interaction with the neighbors.  What really was April's problem?  She didn't seem to be much of an actress.  If she really wanted to pursue acting, Manhattan was only a train ride away and she could have hired a baby sitter and taken classes with Lee Strasberg or Herbert Berghoff!  Maybe the novel gives more background on her to make her incredible unhappiness more justifiable.  But the way Mendes makes this film, she is shown to suffer simply because she has to live there and egad, have another beautiful child and somehow it's her husband's fault.<br /><br />By the end of the film I had lost any sympathy for April, in spite of Winslet's superb performance and I wished her husband better luck next time.<br /><br />I have to wonder what in this film attracted Mendes---perhaps the opportunity to work with his wife and the added attraction of the reunion of the Titanic co-stars.  Too bad he didn't wait for a better script.</p></br><a href="../users/A22RY8N8CNDF3A.html">A22RY8N8CNDF3A</a><br/><p>The 1950's were not that bad, so I felt this movie was unfair to a happy decade.  The sets were fantastic and the actors did their best.<br /><br />The movie starts upbeat enough with a romantic scene where Frank (Leonardo DiCaprio) and April (Kate Winslet) see each other across the room.  They start a conversation about their dreams and a hopeful future.  They get married and become "the Wheelers."<br /><br />The next scene shows Frank embarrassed as April is in a play and it is just awful.  The fights start and continue throughout the movie of this mismatched couple.  April's failure as an actress (minor) and Frank's failure to take the family, quit his job and move to Paris to find out what he really wants to do in life.  The movie focuses on Frank who hates his job in New York City, and has the daily grind of going to work and coming home to a wife and two children in a nice home in suburbia, that is on "Revolutionary Road."  This gives a clue to what is coming.<br /><br />April and Frank both feel the middle class malaise, however, April feels it acutely.  Like a 50's wife, she is willing to submit her desires so her husband can succeed.  On Frank's birthday, April asks him to follow his dream - got to Paris (I never figured out why location made a difference in a goal - she later said it could be "anywhere").  April talks Frank into taking their savings, sell their home and quit his job to move the family to Paris.  She will get a high-paying job as a secretary in some governmental office.<br /><br />Feeling free and not tied to his job, Frank submits a proposal that is unexpectedly welcomed.  He meets with a high ranking member of his company who offers Frank a better position and more money.  Frank decides he rather stay in his home on Revolutionary Road.  April is devastated.  She wants Frank to go to Paris to find out what he really wants in life.<br /><br />The realtor that sold them the house (Kathy Bates) becomes a friend and introduces them to her grown son who has psychiatric problems.  He has had shock therapy and yet he speaks of the evils of conformity.  He told the Wheelers to go to Paris - break out of the mold - find individualism and the spirit of youth.  This causes rough fighting and brutal words between two beautiful people.<br /><br />The rest of the movie is drama and fighting.  Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet act well, but the lines did not ring true.  The problems they had were not big ones, they could take a trip to Paris with the kids with all their money and see if that is what they really wanted.<br /><br />Instead, April and Frank keep fighting and hate grows.  April gets pregnant and Frank does not want her to have an abortion.  She wants out of her shackles and self-aborts the baby and dies.  We are told that Frank adores the other children and takes them to a different house to raise.  It is a sad ending to a disturbing movie.  She cannot accept boredom and conformity.</p></br><a href="../users/A13E0ARAXI6KJW.html">A13E0ARAXI6KJW</a><br/><p>It took 47 years to adapt for the screen Richard Yates' celebrated novel of the struggles that a young suburban couple faces living within the constraints of Eisenhower-era conformity. Even now, the resulting 2008 film, as meticulously directed by Sam Mendes, feels so internally driven that the story may be better suited for the stage or even TV.  In fact, it often feels a bit like an extended episode of the 1950's-set AMC series, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YABIQ6">Mad Men</a>, although the arguments between the protagonists bring to mind similarly visceral set pieces from Edward Albee's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I2JDEY">Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?</a> Adapted by screenwriter Justin Haythe (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002XVKLS">The Clearing</a>), the plot focuses on Frank and April Wheeler, an attractive couple settled in a Connecticut suburb with two young children and seven years into a dysfunctional marriage. The time is 1955 well before professional counseling and divorce were viable options. The one attribute that the couple shares is the disillusionment each experiences with their daily lives, a far cry from the worldly aspirations they had when they first met at a Manhattan cocktail party.<br /><br />Initially a frustrated actress, April is a creative person who is suffocating from her suburban domestic duties, while Frank is an even more aimless dreamer who hates his sales job at an IBM-like company. The story turns on April's sudden idea to move the family to Paris, where she plans to work as a government agency secretary while Frank figures out what he wants to do. He tentatively agrees, but it is her mounting desperation to hold onto her dream of living a bohemian life abroad that points to their emotional unraveling. Extramarital affairs prove to be the least of their problems, as each becomes entrenched in a deepening inability to empathize with or support one another. Communication between them turns into mutual provocations of emotional abuse. Mendes returns to familiar territory here, as there are vestiges of his debut film, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CWL6">American Beauty</a>, in the often uncomfortable-to-watch marital discord he etches here. However, the tone is even more desultory this time with nary a trace of black humor to provide a counterbalance. All the period touches feel authentic with Roger Deakins' cinematography and Kristi Zea's production design contributing to an evocative feel that doesn't feel overly contrived. Thomas Newman's haunting score is another asset that enhances the dramatic elements.<br /><br />This is the type of movie that provides a showcase for its principal actors. As April, Kate Winslet (Mendes' wife) manages to make a fundamentally selfish character sympathetic by throwing herself fearlessly and honestly into the role. Her former <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VS6R26">Titanic</a> co-star, Leonardo DiCaprio has proven to be an arresting actor in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M341QE">The Departed</a>, but his baby face and youthful demeanor really seem at odds with Frank's weakening emotional state and diminishing sense of self-worth. He comes to life during the many confrontation scenes, but he can't match Winslet's affinity with the heavy material. The supporting cast is solid - Kathy Bates (another <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VS6R26">Titanic</a> veteran) as unctuous real estate agent Helen Givings, Kathryn Hahn as the Wheelers' chipper neighbor Milly, David Harbour as her deceptively complacent husband Shep, Zoe Kazan as Frank's gullible secretary, and in just two sharply rendered scenes, Michael Shannon as Helen's mentally ill son and a powerfully uncomfortable harbinger for the tragedy to follow. The 2009 DVD has a standard set of extras - a mostly interesting audio commentary track from Mendes and Haythe, five deleted scenes, and principal cast and crew members contributing to an adequate half-hour making-of featurette, "Lives of Quiet Desperation: The Making of Revolutionary Road".</p></br><a href="../users/A2D0PJFW2VY8G.html">A2D0PJFW2VY8G</a><br/><p>Do you ever have those moments where you think about your life and ask yourself is this the best I could be doing? It's happened to me many times and pursuing writing is my way of trying to achieve something I'd be happy to do for a living. I'm sure all of us at some point have wished for better things and many have achieved their desires, others soldier on content, but not as happy as they might be. Sam Mendes' Revolutionary Road, based on the 1961 novel by Richard Yates, takes a look at a suburban couple in the 1950s, both far from happy with their lives but with the chance to change things.<br /><br />The film begins with Frank (Leonardo DiCaprio) and April (Kate Winslet) Wheeler having an argument following April's appearance in a disastrous play that has not been well received. Their verbal exchange makes for uncomfortable viewing and is made all the more tragic by a brief reminiscence of when the couple first met and had big ambitions for the future. We are then given a linear narrative as the couple go about their lives in their home on Revolutionary Road. Frank works in an office, the same as his father did for 20 years, but Frank hates his job, never really pushing himself and is having an affair with a colleague, Maureen (Zoe Kazan). April is largely confined to the Wheelers home, the domestic goddess that was so prominent in the Victorian Age but it is not an existence she thrives on, wanting much more in life. One day April thinks back to a time when she and Frank spoke of Paris, the latter revealing how amazing life is in France. April proposes she and Frank abandon the suburbs and start a new life in France. She insists she will work as a secretary while Frank stays at home and decides what he wants to do with life. It's the chance of a major change for the Wheelers but do they see it through?<br /><br />Sam Mendes gave us a great insight into American suburban life in his masterpiece American Beauty (1999) and he does the same here. The Wheelers portray the image of the perfect family to their neighbours, Helen (Kathy Bates) and Howard (Richard Easton) Givings, and Milly (Kathryn Hahn) and Shep (David Harbour) Campbell. Helen is frequently visiting and seems intent on making sure the Wheelers are maintaining the peaceful equilibrium of suburban life. The Campbells, like the Wheelers, have something to hide but manage to disguise it though not as convincingly as Frank and April. Milly seems constantly on edge while her husband, Shep, gives occasional but noticeable glances at April. Frank and April have entered a world where happy families are not just expected but demanded. The suburbs in the 1950s seem the perfect place but sadly for the Wheelers their surroundings only serve to create further cracks in their marriage.<br /><br />After initially dismissing April's idea of moving to Paris, Frank realises it might not be a bad idea. The couple begin to announce their news to friends who are taken aback and don't know what to say, causing much delight for the Wheelers who are finally breaking free of social convention's stranglehold. The Givings' troubled son, John (Michael Shannon), is the only one to speak up and try and lift the suburban masks the couples are wearing. His outbursts are dismissed and ignored as he isn't well but, ironically, it is John that talks more sense than anyone in the film, frequently touching nerves with the truth. Inevitably, the strain of domestic life continues to weigh heavily on Frank and April and their hopes for a better life are threatened when Frank, submitting a sarcastic piece of work, is recognised as a great talent and offered a lucrative promotion. Frank suddenly sees some good out of the mundane job he does and the move to France becomes less appealing. Even worse, April discovers she's pregnant with the couple's third child but is so determined to leave for Paris that she considers an abortion, an idea furiously condemned by Frank. With the couples' dream of a better life seemingly in tatters, something has to give.<br /><br />When I read the synopsis for Revolutionary Road I thought the move to Paris would be the focal point of the film but this is simply a study of the pressure of maintaining a domestic paradise in the heaven that is the suburbs and whether it's possible to break free from it all. Watching Frank and April try to escape their unfulfilling lives was difficult. A film of this nature is bound to end in tragedy and Revolutionary Road does leave a bitter taste at the end. The only issue with the film is that it perhaps could have had more emphasis on the gulf between Frank and April at the start of their relationship to the sad descent in the present. We are given a couple of instances of their lives when things were great between them and the future looked bright but other than that we have to accept that the difficulties have been a part of their marriage for a long time. That's a minor quibble, of course, for I do believe the film portrays a frightening view of suburban life in the 1950s and in April we have a modern and independent woman still bound by the expectation that her only option in life is being in the kitchen.<br /><br />Revolutionary Road is a thought-provoking and tragic drama depicting the perfect surface of suburban life but revealing the maelstrom of troubled marriages and relationships beneath. A much better pairing for DiCaprio and Winslet than Titanic, Revolutionary Road remains enthralling throughout but will leave you exhausted by the time you reach the poignant ending.</p></br><a href="../users/AAZRWLML88IZK.html">AAZRWLML88IZK</a><br/><p>A decade after Titanic, Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet again find themselves playing characters on a sinking ship; however, in Revolutionary Road the vessel is their marriage. The movie is handsomely crafted by Sam Mendes, but the result is an exquisite downer. DiCaprio and Winslet star as Frank and April, a young couple with dreams of ditching their humdrum suburban existence for the freedom and excitement of Paris; however, circumstance stymies them, and resentment follows. Revolutionary Road looks immaculate, and the performances are outstanding, but I feel the movie is more tasteful than emotionally resonant.</p></br><a href="../users/A3O536E2YOKK4Y.html">A3O536E2YOKK4Y</a><br/><p>Eleven years after their mega-hit "Titanic," Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio reunite for "Revolutionary Road," released in January, 2009. Kate has shed her unappealing baby fat and is now a curvy beauty, whereas Leonardo is definitely a man and no longer has that boyish vibe.<br /><br />"Revolutionary Road" is a drama about a couple with two kids living in the suburbs of Connecticut in the '50s. Frank Wheeler (DiCaprio) marches off to the big city five times a week, ten hours a day, to a job he hates, whereas April (Kate) takes care of things on the home front, including their hardly-seen children. Kate's dream of being an actress has failed and she vents her frustrations on Frank. Feeling emasculated, Frank has a meaningless affair to prove his manhood to himself. Meanwhile April comes up with a wild idea for them to move to Paris because Frank's war tales describe it as a place of total exhilaration and April desperately wants Frank to regain that aura of vitality he had when they first met. Will they escape the miserable corner they've painted themselves into or will they join the masses of living dead in their midst?<br /><br />I enjoy a good drama now and then, like the excellent "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001DN0V02">Snow Angels</a>," the potent "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000056BSJ">Grand Canyon</a>" or the masterpiece "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305144168">Dead Poets Society</a>," but "Revolutionary Road" fails to achieve the greatness of those films, mainly because the characters and their story are fairly boring. The film's just not that engrossing, which is my main criteria for evaluating any flick.<br /><br />Yet it does have some glimpses of greatness. For one, the movie possesses a very real bizarreness that's hard to explain. Seriously, this is easily one of the most slyly offbeat dramas I've ever seen. Secondly, Michael Shannon as John Givings, the mentally disturbed son of the real estate lady (Kathy Bates), is a fascinating character. Everyone else in the Wheeler's lives thinks their plans to give up their surburban paradise are crazy. Big surprise. But John sees the brilliance and necessity of the plan. In other words, the only person who 'gets' the plight of the Wheelers is this nigh-insane dude. But he's not really insane. John is gifted at seeing through a facade to get to the core of a matter, the awesome or awful truth. And he has no inhibitions about speaking his mind, good or bad. At heart, John is a beatnik, the 50's precursor to the hippie. He represents the first wave of the 60's counter-culture, a generation of youth who discerned the cracks in the post-war "paradise," and spit on it, for better or worse.<br /><br />The film raises some important questions: Is life just having a marriage, a family, a well-paying job (you loathe) and a nice home in the pleasant suburbs, plus cigarettes and drinks without end? Or is their more? What about love? What about genuineness? What about unrealized, unused or ignored talents and dreams? What about (gasp) God?<br /><br />"Revolutionary Road" has some other positives: it's expertly made, has a good score by Thomas Newman and evokes some haunting moments.<br /><br />The film was shot in Connecticut & NYC and runs almost 2 hours.<br /><br />FINAL WORD: Because of the unengrossing characters and story, I can only give "Revolutionary Road" a strong 3 Stars or C+. But I can see why others rate it higher because it does have flashes of greatness and it definitely makes you reflect on its themes. In some ways, the same message is addressed in "Dead Poets Society" (and "Grand Canyon" to a lesser extent) -- rejecting the box society tries to confine you, throwing caution to the wind, and going after your dreams -- the difference is that "Dead Poets Society" (and "Grand Canyon") accomplished this with a captivating story whereas "Revolutionary Road" doesn't. Generally speaking, that is.<br /><br />But this is a film that might be better on repeat viewings. We'll see. I'll be sure to adjust my rating if it is.<br /><br />In any event, it's definitely worth catching if these themes trip your trigger.</p></br><a href="../users/A1UFV4HALV2OXW.html">A1UFV4HALV2OXW</a><br/><p>Revolutionary Road may feature the stars of Titanic - Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet  - but there's no Titanic love story here. It's the end of the line for a marriage. Frank and April Wheeler had hopes and dreams when they first got married but all they ended up with was disillusionment. A good performance by the actors, but not a movie for those looking for an uplifting story.</p></br><a href="../users/A2582KMXLK2P06.html">A2582KMXLK2P06</a><br/><p>What makes Revolutionary Road stand out to me is the fact that, being patient and putting up with a relatively slow-moving storyline for the first 50% of it will gradually win you over by the time the movie has finished. I feel confident about this because there's a few twists and shockers at the end that I honestly never seen coming.  In order to appreciate these twists, you need to follow the entire film, even the boring parts.<br /><br />Let's be honest- the first half of Revolutionary Road is slow, boring, and almost pointless. The majority of the first half consists of a young couple (the man played by Leonardo DiCaprio) having big aspirations in life, and the wife encouraging the two of them to go and live in Paris permanently with their two children.<br /><br />Well, that never really happens because a bunch of obstacles come into the picture and cause a distraction for the young couple, one of them being that the wife is pregnant with another baby. As soon as we find out about the pregnancy, THIS is when the movie really picks up steam. An argument comes about, and then more problems follow suit. This all happens about halfway through the movie.<br /><br />The first half though... yikes. A VERY slow moving storyline this one has.<br /><br />Any time any mention of Leonardo DiCaprio's job position is mentioned, the storyline immediately sinks. This is just dull and uninspiring storytelling, and it's a horrible waste of time.<br /><br />Kathy Bates plays a nice, if somewhat unimportant part in the movie, and like always her scenes are absolutely golden. When she brings her troubled son over and he carries on conversations with the young couple and sticks his nose where it doesn't belong concerning the relationship problems the young couple is having... haha, BAD things happen. I won't spoil it though.<br /><br />This isn't a comedy- it's a drama with a twist at the end you need to see if you've been following the movie for the first half of it. It's a movie that tells a nice story, and that's about it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX.html">A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX</a><br/><p>As many people have already commented on the aspects of this film, I thought I would make a few comments on an interesting parallel I just became aware of in regard to another movie.<br /><br />Oddly enough, within 24 hours I saw both "The Man in the Grey Flannel Suit," a flick from 1956, and this movie, and they're both so similar that one wonders if the novel this movie was based on was in some way influenced by the 50s novel and subsequent movie. In both movies the couples (played by Gregory Peck and Jennifer Jones in the earlier flick) face the same struggle between security and conformity, the desire to escape a constricting life, and the need to excel and stand out in some way from the herd.<br /><br />Peck is a successful advertising executive who is haunted by flashbacks from the war, but who has married, started a family, and managed to successfully balance family with career, despite his own reservations about the personal compromises he must make at work. The wife isn't happy with those compromises, always wanting Peck to stand up for his own ideas and be more independent, despite the fact that this would almost certainly put his job security in jeopardy. But like the Winslett character in this film, she wants a different husband and some ways a different life, although not to the extent of her husband quitting and then gallivanting off to Paris.<br /><br />In this film, again, we have a young couple who want a freer, more alive, more independent life, free from the dull, drab, boring sameness of 50s middle-class life and its strictures and conventions. The difference between this couple and Peck and Jones is that they do indeed at least initially decide to chuck the comfortable middle class life they've set up and move to Europe. But circumstances intervene, and so they're both left with the earlier unhappy compromises that they were trying to break free of--with resulting disastrous consequences for their marriage--whereas in the 50's flick eventually everything works out in the end.<br /><br />Another interesting parallel is that both men have (although under very different circumstances) romantic dalliances outside of their marriage. In Peck's case, it was during the war when he thought he might die any day, never to see his wife again. In the present movie it's a less forgivable dalliance since it occurs with another woman in the office.<br /><br />Overall a well done movie about a couple who just weren't meant for each other and with interesting parallels to another movie from over 50 years ago.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MNMZMM6BGLTA.html">A2MNMZMM6BGLTA</a><br/><p>I really enjoyed this movie. I liked the story and the atmosphere of 1950's culture. Leo and Kate were excellent as were the rest of the cast. The crazy guy from 'Bug' (with Ashley Judd) steals the entire show playing the crazy son of Kathy Bates. He is hilarious! Good movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VABWDOUQLULZ.html">A1VABWDOUQLULZ</a><br/><p>For all the hype surrounding this film, I suppose my expectations were a bit high.  I had no idea what the film was about, so nothing was given away.  I went into it fairly open.  From the opening scene there was something disjointed about the film's flow that I just couldn't get around.  I thought perhaps I just didn't relate to the 1950s dynamic, that perhaps one of the Wheeler couple had some sort of mental imperative that skewed the story for the audience, or some other similar great reveal lurked right around the corner.  But nothing ever jumped out to save this film.  It looked spectacular, the story was interesting though painfully slow moving throughout, the acting was top-notch.  In the end what struck me most was that despite how many wonderful elements made up this film, they did not act in unison.  While Winslet, DiCaprio and their supporting cast were fantastic, they all felt like they were each acting in their own film.  There was no synergy.  That was, in essence, the point of the film, but the feeling that even the cast was fragmented did not seal the story.  In the end it gives good insight into the insidious nature of depression and how despite the way things may appear on the outside, everything has shadows.</p></br><a href="../users/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ.html">A12X2J7AVZ04IQ</a><br/><p>Sam Mendes is a fine director, in tune with the human condition. His vision of Richard Yates' novel is a character study that, I think, was much maligned by most. Certainly, it's not a million laffs; rather a study of life as it is (or was...and still is). This could've been just another sad soap opera, but what sets it aside is the superlative acting of Winslet and di Caprio, and excellent support from Michael Shannon, Kathy Bates & Dylan Baker. I will not blab away the plot, as others did, but paying attention to the characters can only make you marvel in the talent displayed. I guess I just chose to pay attention; maybe I could relate to the angst. Critics don't have to deal with these things. REAL people often do... Dealing with these people is no different than dealing with other traumatic experiences. I thought it was profound, and thoughtful, and beautifully explored.</p></br></body></html>

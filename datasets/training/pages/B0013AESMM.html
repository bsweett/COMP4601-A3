Besides the very excellent action story featuring an abundance of action and violence, this story has a lot to say about never being able to return to who you were prior to being made the victim of a violent crime.<br /><br />The story makes a convincing case for the idea that extreme trauma almost always prevents one from returning to that innocent "person", or possessing that tranquil state of mind he or she believed they were in prior to being a victim of violence.  That person is dead and gone, always replaced by a new person having no "illusions" or ideals about safety, truth or justice.<br /><br />The question is how to proceed from that point on. The idea that revenge and violence is inescapable is troubling, but I don't believe it to be necessarily true as Jodie Foster's character emphatically did. Nevertheless, this story was a chilling and exciting roller coaster of a film and I recommend it for all fans of action movies as well as wonderful Jodie Foster.</p></br><a href="../users/AIMR915K4YCN.html">AIMR915K4YCN</a><br/><p>Jodie Foster (Taxi Driver, Silence Of The Lambs, Panic Room, Flight Plan) has really hit her stride w/ these thrillers. In THE BRAVE ONE, she takes on the role of radio-personality turned vigilante w/ ease and cool lethality. At first, I thought this was going to be some sort of DEATH WISH re-tread. Nope, TBO is a story about the ultimate cost of revenge. The toll that vengeance takes on the avenger in the form of a new inner deadness and freezing of one's own soul. While the scumbags who get their due are certainly deserving of their fate, Erica must go deeper into the abyss w/ each execution. The price of becoming an angel of death is extremely high. Ms. Foster brings authenticity and anguish to the part of Erica Bain. I found myself pitying her, while at the same time hoping she would get the satisfaction that she was willing to kill and die for. As a Jodie fan for some 30+ years (I fell in love w/ her character in The Little Girl Who Lives Down The Lane back in the 70s), I consider this to be one of her best performances. Terrence Howard is also great as the cop who finds himself torn between his sense of morality / duty, and his growing  understanding of / respect for the motive that drives this street-avenger. I must admit that I did not see the final&eacute; coming! I was surprised by it. I was even more surprised by my own gleeful reaction to it! Watch it and you'll see what I mean...</p></br><a href="../users/A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5.html">A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5</a><br/><p>Radio announcer Erica Bain (Foster) had the perfect life.  Her show's going great.  She loves her fiancee, Dr. David Kirmani (Naveen Andrews).  Then they are attacked one night in the park while walking their dog by a vicious band of street punks.  Erica awakens from a coma after three weeks to discover that David's family had to let him go while she was unconscious.<br /><br />She's afraid to walk the streets anymore, even the most innocent passerby makes her wary.  So, she buys an illegal gun.  Next, she takes up smoking.<br /><br />A friend tells her she's got to figure out a way to life.  That's the hard thing. The story tells how fear changes a person and makes them wonder if they will ever be the same again.<br /><br />Erica starts out innocently enough, defending herself against a robber who killed his wife. Next, it's a pair of punks in the subway who rob an innocent person and then pull a gun on her.<br /><br />Almost every person who's been hurt has wanted to seek vengeance in some way.  The dream is a lot harsher than the reality.  "The Brave One" is painful to watch, but it's worthwhile.  Jodie Foster's given the best performance of a life full of strong performances.  Also, kudos to Terence Howard as Detective Mercer.<br /><br />Rebecca Kyle, September 2008</p></br><a href="../users/AOTMP0OKJOUWI.html">AOTMP0OKJOUWI</a><br/><p>To my surprise, I found myself quite entranced by this mystery movie of a traumatized woman who takes justice into her own hands.<br /><br />I know there are plenty of vigilante movies out there, and to be perfectly honest this one doesn't do much that is original. We get the obligatory philosophical debate of the morality of killing thugs who deserve it, minus that crucial law step.<br /><br />But mostly, this is a movie that impresses it self most by some impressive performances from its leads and the fact that, despite whatever our opinion is on the vigilante syndrome, there is something pretty darn neat about watching jerks get shot in the face by Jodie Foster. Indeed, I pretty much ignored the good/evil debate and happily waited for Ms. Foster to take out another hoodlum.<br /><br />Plus, I thought the filming was just plain pretty--in a dark and sinister kind of way.<br /><br />If guns and good acting is all it takes to keep you happy, this will be worth your viewing.</p></br><a href="../users/APOGXH3A74CM3.html">APOGXH3A74CM3</a><br/><p>A turn of events can change a person's life in an instant.  That certainly is the case here.  A brutal attack finds Foster's character (Erica Bain) barely alive, and her fianc&eacute; not so fortunate.<br /><br />Bain finds herself struggling with a stranger within herself.  Unable to connect with the world she knew before her attack, Bain becomes her her own demon.  She finds herself once again in the wrong place at the wrong time, witness to a murder in a liquor store, and in this instance she is pushed beyond the brink.<br /><br />She lives for vengeance, and strangely on the wrong side of the law, out to right the wrongs of the world.<br /><br />Bain's only connection and comfort comes from the relationship that develops between her and Detective Mercer (an outstanding performance by Terrence Howard) who is out to catch the mystery vigilante.<br /><br />In the end, it is Mercer that hopefully has brought Bain back from the edge (didn't want to give too much away).<br /><br />Outstanding performances and gritty tension.  Well done.</p></br><a href="../users/AJMU8VVFKMZI4.html">AJMU8VVFKMZI4</a><br/><p>Jodie's talent saves another thinly plotted script.  How many life and death situations does an average citizen get into?  Does anyone believe that this-what 5'4 woman really beat up fully capable 6'1 or more man with a crowbar-oh and toss him over a high drop parking deck?  I like a little vigilante justice...in my Hollywood movies only, but the final moment with Terrence Howard helping her out in the end was just a bit too much.  They weren't THAT close.  Still despite being predictable, the film does deliver the suspense.  I understand the need to have dark scenes, but I hate that almost nuclear green tint these films use.  I always feel like I need a bath after watching two hours with that slimy color.  Overall The Brave One manages to entertain...because Jodie is always fascinating to watch.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>Certain parallels between Charles Bronson's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000541AN">Death Wish</a> and THE BRAVE ONE have undoubtedly already been drawn, and rightfully so. Both focus on vigilante justice by a man (or woman) who was wronged by thugs. But herein lay the ONLY similarity, making The Brave One a somewhat unique animal.<br /><br />What drove Bronson's Paul Kersey character was anger, whereas Jodi Foster's Erica Bain is driven by fear after a brutal attack in a New York park that leaves her fianc&eacute; David (Naveen Andrews, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0017HZZP0">Lost TV Series</a>) dead and herself in a coma for weeks.<br /><br />Erica, a well-known radio personality, has to try and get her life back on track, but fear of everything infringes upon her every wish. Walking down hallways make her dizzy, and going out at night is out of the question. Upon returning to work she finds she can hardly breath and confides much to her boss Carol (Mary Steenburgen, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MTFFO0">The Dead Girl</a>). Coming to terms with her fear, Erica purchases an illegal handgun and, after finding herself near another person who's violence dismayed her, kills someone with her new gun. Her hand is steady. She doesn't shake. Her life of fear is changing into...something else.<br /><br />A path of vigilante deaths get the cops involved and Detective Mercer (Terrence Howard, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BITUWU">Hustle & Flow</a>) is on the case. He's also involved in trying to solve the murder of Erica's fianc&eacute; and the two form an unusual relationship based on suspicion and the dichotomy of right versus legalities. Their interplay is unique and tenuous as the two learn more about each other and come to a mutual form of respect ...and perhaps much more.<br /><br />Those similarities I mentioned at the beginning are now sorely lost. Mainly because Bronson's Paul Kersey (a man and the stereotype for vigilantism) and Foster's Erica Bain (a woman and not a stereotype) are in different ballparks. Kersey did it for revenge from the get-go, while Bain's in initially about how to deal with her fear, but later becomes a convoluted form of animalistic revenge. The damage she's doing to herself are felt within the character and not from without. Her realization that she "doesn't tremble" when she kills someone is both unsettling and comforting. That she gets better and better at killing is equally so.<br /><br />The biggest problem with the film, however, is that it initially sets Terrence Howard's Detective Mercer up as a very good and forthright cop, but in the end he is anything but that. He crosses the line between right and legally right with exceptional ease, which kind of ruined the ending for me; too simplistic for such a complex man.<br /><br />But nothing can be taken away from Jodi Foster (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GFLKF8">Inside Man</a>). Still plugging along after all these years, she's still able to carry a film's weight with grace, honor and sheer terror.<br /><br />A worthy evening diversion for those interested in the genre.</p></br><a href="../users/A2582KMXLK2P06.html">A2582KMXLK2P06</a><br/><p>I was hoping The Brave One would live up to the hype of being an incredible edge of your seat thriller/drama, but it didn't happen that way.  Instead it was a merely good enough film that offered just enough action and excitement to give it a passable rating.<br /><br />What was a bit odd was how the action scenes just sort of appeared out of nowhere.  Suddenly, Jodie would find herself in a situation where she had to use her nifty little gun that she bought for a high dollar price, to fire off some shots at the bad guys who'd come into the picture and mess with her.  Now, if she had to use the gun as often in real life as she did here, I'd strongly consider moving out of that dangerous city.  It wasn't believable in that sense.<br /><br />I think another thing I didn't like was the whole "radio show" bits that would creep in every now and then.  Whenever Jodie interviewed someone for her show, that would almost immediately take away all the excitement from the story and make it as boring as possible.<br /><br />But, we can't deny Jodie's performance was really good, like always.  She's one of the best actresses doing movies.  Always has been, in fact.  Some pacing issues aside, along with some storyline bits that make us question reality, it was a good movie</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>Watching 'The Brave One' while being a very insightful character study, still ends up being another 'Death Wish'. Smarter perhaps, but it does bring us to the same place. The film does show the different phases of healing from a victim's point of view, but in the end, we still love to see these dirtballs get exterminated! Jodie Foster gives a wonderful performance and I really felt her anxiety and paranoia when she tries to re-enter the world she once knew. Although she seems to have no problem finding trouble after her attack, I guess it's not too far fetched as I'm sure there is plenty of it, if your looking for it.....trouble that is!</p></br><a href="../users/A1GHUN5HXMHZ89.html">A1GHUN5HXMHZ89</a><br/><p>Although we have seen many vigilante movies, this one takes a very different approach. First it is a woman that is wronged by a gang that kills her fiance. But even though she goes after them, this movie is as much about her psychological changes as the acts of vengence. Well thought out screenplay with excellent character development. This is not at all in a class with the Bronson or other vigilante movies. Jodie Foster as always is a consumate actress and pulls off another unforgettable dramatic performance as a radio jock with a show about her feelings for New York City. Even after her change to a stranger that executes killers she reaches out to the city. Terrence Howard does a fine job as the cop pursueing the vigilante. Good quality DVD and fair replayability. If you enjoyed this catch "Panic Room", "Red Eye", and "Flightplan". - C. Luster</p></br><a href="../users/A2Z44AN3F2IN61.html">A2Z44AN3F2IN61</a><br/><p>I was initially a little dubious about watching this movie, worried that it would be a tear-jerker. It wasn't.<br /><br />It also wasn't a revenge/action movie, though that's definitely part of it.<br /><br />Erica Bain's (Jodie Foster) fiance David (Naveen Andrews) is killed in front of her, and The Brave One is the story of how she deals with that. She buys herself a gun to feel safer, and then finds herself courting danger with the gun for protection, and finally becoming a vigilante.<br /><br />But it's not something she sets out to do--she's not trying to be a superhero, and she's not reveling in the violence or even remotely feeling good about it--she's just trying to feel safe.<br /><br />Detective Mercer (Terrence Howard) is the detective on her fiance's case, and ultimately on her own, and he plays a sounding board, conscience, and catalyst.<br /><br />Gah. I'm having a terrible time describing this movie. It's always so much easier to say what I don't like than what I do.<br /><br />One scene that sticks in my mind is when Erica is in the emergency room, the action is interposed with a love scene between her and David. It's visually poignant and powerful. And there are a lot of similarly powerful scenes.<br /><br />Okay, I give up. Bottom line: I loved the movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NYQCLFQRTI74.html">A2NYQCLFQRTI74</a><br/><p>A radio host (Jodie Foster) witnesses her fiance's death and is left for dead. When she comes back to, she gradually sets out to get revenge on her fiance's killers.<br /><br />It's about time a female character in a movie is shown taking revenge and justice in her hands. Sorry for all the people out there that did not enjoy the movie because they didn't think Foster's character was realistic. But if these things were to happen to you, I'm quite certain, you, like Foster's character, would take the law in your hands and chase after the bad guys. So this is a great film for that.<br />I also enjoyed Foster's performances, though at times some scenes stretched out.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ROE64EVHDTTV.html">A3ROE64EVHDTTV</a><br/><p>The Good Things:<br />-Not a bad concept.<br />-Not a bad character; it is interesting to see how she turns wicked. More interesting to see her inner conflicts and emotions.<br />-Emotionally strong.<br />-Camera style is kind of wierd. It's smooth, but it still moves around a lot and has very mesmerizing parts.<br />-Dark and dreadful portrayal of city life, with rampant criminals willing to beat everybody up (scary!).<br />-Good suspense throughout.<br /><br />The Bad Things:<br />-Slow paced.<br /><br />This is basically "Death Wish" with Jodie Foster instead of Charles Bronson (between the two, I would prefer "Death Wish" for its 1970's grittiness). This film is much more modernized, with clean, smooth, hypnotic shots. One could say that it is even visually appealing. To top it off, it has strong emotions (certainly enough to overpower "Death Wish"). The beating scene is particuarly brutal and sad. The only problem I have is that this film is that it is slowly paced, and for a full 122 minute movie, it gets a little tedious.<br /><br />I would reccomend this for people who are interested in thrillers. Fans of cop films or other vigilante films (like "Death Wish") may also be interested, but be aware that it is based more on suspense and characterization, not action.</p></br><a href="../users/A3HM5G9IV1FTFP.html">A3HM5G9IV1FTFP</a><br/><p>The storyline in "The Brave One" is one that is very familiar in American cinema ... a brutalized victim reclaims their power by turning into a vigilante. Because this story is so familiar, and the script of "The Brave One" is just so-so, it took a great director (Neil Jordan, "The Crying Game") and a powerhouse lead actress to elevate the film into something more than just another revenge flick.<br /><br />Most of the credit goes to Foster. Her performance as Erica is absolutely mesmerizing. She portrays a woman who is equal parts frightened, repelled and astounded by the avenging vigilante she finds herself becoming. Her character maintains her complex emotional landscape even when she's delivering lines like "who's the bitch now?" (While killing one of the thugs who murdered her fianc&eacute; and nearly beat her to death.)<br /><br />Credit also belongs to Neil Jordan, who never allows the film to descend into cheesy fare, and occasionally allows it to explore the complex emotional reactions Americans have toward revenge and vigilante violence.<br /><br />This is a "Hollywood" film, to be sure, with an ending that's just a little too neat and tidy to fit the messy business of revenge. But it's one of the best "Hollywood" films I've seen lately.</p></br><a href="../users/A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ.html">A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ</a><br/><p>Erica Bain (Jodie Foster) is the radio host of a pretentious program on some no doubt mind-deadening station.  Her life is great and her eyes are closed to the real horrors of the city.  But she soon has to watch her fianc&eacute; die at the hands of brutal murderers who also leave her in a coma and steal her dog.  They steal her dog!  Upon awakening, her world is rocked; she's borderline agoraphobic.<br /><br />In a situation like this, people typically do one of two things.  They either bury it deep inside, letting it burn, crippling them emotionally for years; or, they act out in a way that will help them overcome the trauma.  Erica chooses the latter option, buying a gun, becoming revitalized, and seeking a complete resolution.  Like Sally Field in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005Y1UV">Eye For An Eye</a>, I'm VERY pleased with her choice.<br /><br />From there she channels her inner Bronson and begins to clean up New York, one dirt bag at a time.<br /><br />First up, a man enters a gas station, gets angry - more than likely about the fact that the clerk had trouble scanning a debit card - and blows his top like Michael Douglas from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0790742780">Falling Down</a> if you added a strong meth addiction to the picture.  Bain whips out her hand-cannon and fires from one aisle to another, through merchandise, to avenge the murder.  Clean up, aisle three!  As a follow-up she recreates my favorite scene from the Bernhard Goetz biography, and it's thoroughly satisfying.<br /><br />The transformation Bain undergoes from safety to paranoia to judge/jury/executioner is what truly makes this movie great.  Philosophical, political, emotional, physical, it's a metamorphosis in every way (similar to the 180 degree change Travis Bickle wanted for her in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0767830555">Taxi Driver</a>).  She may have thought that New York was one of the safest big cities before she was attacked - something she mentioned early on - but the experience has now opened her myopic eyes.  Now, she plans on ensuring her previous misconceptions ring true.<br /><br />This is, by far, my favorite Jodie Foster performance, and her performance is absolutely mesmerizing.  Highly recommended.  I can only hope that it turns into a series of duplicates like the original <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000REOCSA">Death Wish Collection</a>.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>Prior to seeing The Brave One, I saw a lot of preconceived opinions that the movie would be Death Wish 2007...a la Jodie Foster. And that's not too far off plotwise.<br /><br />We all know what happened in 1974's Death Wish, right? In Death Wish some hoodlums put the hurt on Charles Bronson's family and Bronson goes Medieval on New York City's bad guys with a roll of quarters in a sock and a gun.<br /><br />Well Death Wish didn't win any big awards, but it was certainly a cult classic that holds up to this day. On the other hand, I wouldn't be surprised to see Jodie Foster nab a nomination (from the MTV Movie Awards at minimum) for her role as Paul Kersey...er...um...I mean Erica "Pain" Bain.<br /><br />Foster really is a great actress and she makes you feel the agony that she is going through after the loss of a loved one. She also does an A-list job of taking a personality from Princess Leia to The Dark Side of the Force.<br /><br />Terrence Howard (who's in more movies in 2007 & 2008 than anyone I think) plays a cool, enjoyable to watch detective with his own mini side-story. But the key is that all of the side stories--and there really aren't that many--take a back seat to the primary script. The script that drew so many to the simple concept of Death Wish. The vigilante on the loose.<br /><br />The story is well-told and focuses on Foster's acts of retribution as much as the moral dilemma of being brutally violated, then taking severe action against the violating crowd, but questioning yourself and being questioned by the public for your response to the original attack committed against you (Hey, remind you any current events?).<br /><br />Director Neil Jordan keeps the action real enough in The Brave One so as to make you think you've got a window into something-that-is-really-happening. There are a couple of over the top sequences...especially in the last 15 or so minutes...but otherwise, the emotion, suspense and tense situations will keep you in your seat and thoroughly entertained for its full 2 hour runtime.<br /><br />The Brave One was definitely worth the trip off the couch and out to the theater. At minimum, don't miss it on DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>The Brave One starring Jodie Foster is a powerful and revenge-seeking drama about a woman who's forever changed by a harrowing trauma. Foster is a superb actress in every sense of the word, her eyes are magical - you feel her pain and anguish. Some of the subplots are a bit outrageous and can be too violent at times but overall, The Brave One is worth watching. Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/AYZLXLVMJGTJV.html">AYZLXLVMJGTJV</a><br/><p>This movie really drew me in. I could relate to Erica's way of seeing the world after a traumatic experience impacted her whole way of being. She was such a happy person with so much joy to look forward too. She was marrying a man who shared the same amount of energy towards her as she him. They just completely exhibited such completeness. This was so well acted because you only had a few scenes with them both but you got the vibe so well before the actual tragedy hits. The impact leaves Erica played by Foster, in such a way that it takes her identity and reshapes her into a person who is without any of herself much glimpsed. When she goes out into the city after experiencing ptsd, the visuals are used in such a way that reflects trauma. The way the camera plays on the ptsd hits home. The loud sounds, the hyperviglance the way Erica holds her body, all shows what happens after an event that scars an individual. Her reactions to her job and people take on a drastic change and she does seem shut down and on pilot, living her life with impulsive acts of violence. She realizes this and seems to want to be punished for the actions of crime she has committed. There is a dissociation that can be seen in her, and people who have experienced a tramatic event can relate to this. She seems to be impacted by two people and other than them she seems cut off from the world. A detective and a neighbor seem to impact her with words of wisdom that hit home. She seems so angry but it is repressed. When she talks about the killings that have yet to disclose the perpatrator who is secretly her, she seems to be disgusted by the uncaring remarks of her radio audience, they disregard humanity and lack compassion, which suggests a polarity or a split in her. I liked the identification I had with the character and her meditation and reflection in healing. I loved her depth in her words and how she portrayed herself towards the detective and on her radio program. The moment was stronger cus of the impact her words made on others and almost felt like prose. The movie had a dark depth of spirituality to it and even had Sarah Mclauglin music, this particular singer gives off that aura. The movie has the buildup of  revenge and sadness. The movie could be a turnoff to some but the darkness makes it different and creative. The beautiful relationship between the two as reflected in the hospital scene again shows the polarity between pain and exquisite pleasure. A very engrossing film.</p></br><a href="../users/AHABFECTNE15I.html">AHABFECTNE15I</a><br/><p>Version: U.S.A / Warner / Region A, B, C<br />Aspect ratio: 2.40:1<br />VC-1 BD-25 / AACS / Advanced Profile 3<br />Running time: 2:02:18<br />Movie size: 21,11 GB<br />Disc size: 24,05 GB<br />Total bit rate: 23.02 Mbps<br />Average video bit rate: 17.03 Mbps<br /><br />Dolby TrueHD Audio English 1414 kbps 5.1 / 48 kHz / 1414 kbps / 16-bit (AC3 Core: 5.1 / 48 kHz / 640 kbps)<br />Dolby Digital Audio English 640 kbps 5.1 / 48 kHz / 640 kbps<br />Dolby Digital Audio French 640 kbps 5.1 / 48 kHz / 640 kbps<br />Dolby Digital Audio Spanish 640 kbps 5.1 / 48 kHz / 640 kbps<br /><br />Subtitles: English SDH, French, Spanish<br />Number of chapters: 31<br /><br />#Deleted Scenes (SD - 6m 45s)<br />#Featurette: I Walk the City (SD - 21m 41s)<br /><br />*********************************************************<br /><br />Version: U.K - E.U / Warner / Region A, B, C<br />Audio: Dolby TrueHD English, Dolby Digital 5.1 English, French, Dutch, Italian, Spanish<br />Subtitles: English SDH, Dutch, French, Spanish, Italian SDH, Portuguese, Deen, Finnish, Noors, Swedish, Chinese, Korean</p></br><a href="../users/A10X0JN8KTK89H.html">A10X0JN8KTK89H</a><br/><p>The Brave One casts Jodie Foster in a role Hollywood generally reserves for men: the vigilante.  While women in film are no strangers to violence, they usually don't do the killing themselves, and especially not with a gun.  Foster plays the role of Erica Bain, a hip radio essayist, with the same courage she conjures in Silence of the Lambs.  Bain and her fianc&eacute;, David (played by Naveen Andrews), are attacked during a nightly walk.  David does not survive his injuries, and Bain's life proceeds down a dark and violent path.<br /><br />The unseen protagonist of the film is psychological closure after a traumatic event.  The plot of the film would not occur if the police had brought to justice the men who attacked Bain and David.  It's the need for closure that drives the plot into highly predictable and sometimes unlikely situations.  The film is not a total loss, however, thanks most to Foster and Terrence Howard.  Howard plays the role of Detective Mercer, and in the hands of a lesser actor, Mercer would have appeared as irrelevant as the character truly is.  Howard's charisma and patience won me over, as did Foster's wide-ranging and dynamic characterization.  The subtle love interest between Foster and Howard was well written and well acted.  R-rated films rarely show people interested in each other without forcing them to sleep together.<br /><br />Despite a familiar plot, the movie is highly entertaining, well acted, and at times thought-provoking.  The film does contain scenes of intense violence.  In the end, The Brave One asks us to consider strange mixes of justice and vengeance, vigilantism and law, love and loss; and while the movie does reach closure, it doesn't quite come to a moment of clarity about these important ideas.</p></br><a href="../users/AMP7TQRWAIE84.html">AMP7TQRWAIE84</a><br/><p>*get this if you have been hearing it's good<br />*get this if you want a suspenseful masterpiece<br />*get this if you don't know about/haven't seen Death Wish<br />*get this if all you rent are comedies<br />*get this if you're bored one day with nothing to do<br />*get this if you like lots of violence and blood<br />*get this if you enjoy Jodie Foster (as an actress)<br />*get this if you want a nice ending<br />*get this if you've ever been a victim (especially of some crime)<br /><br />*don't get this if you can't stomach violence<br />*don't get this if you know you don't enjoy suspense/murder movies<br />*don't get this if you don't like to be at the edge of your seat waiting for what's next<br />*don't get this if you don't like exciting movies (>_>)<br />*don't get this if you don't like blood<br />*don't get this if you can't stand innocent people being harmed<br />*don't get this if you're not a thinker<br /><br />had me interested till the very end.<br /><br />4.8 stars.<br /><br />end note: get this</p></br><a href="../users/A3R2YB0WTTB0IJ.html">A3R2YB0WTTB0IJ</a><br/><p>*** 2007.

Not bad but it's nonetheless a little disappointing film from the author of such masterpieces as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0767847415">The End of the Affair</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXBJ">Mona Lisa - Criterion Collection</a>.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LSDDSM4PGOU5.html">A1LSDDSM4PGOU5</a><br/><p>this movie was much better than i had hoped or expected it to be.it<br />basically turns the vigilante genre on its head,and has a female<br />character as the vigilante.like any vigilante movie,it certainly poses<br />tough questions.it contains some terrific performances in it's two lead<br />characters,Jodi Foster as the vigilante,and Terrance Howard as the cop<br />on her trail.both are outstanding and very credible in their respective<br />roles.Foster really makes you sympathetic to her character and rooting<br />for her,even though you probably shouldn't.Howard's character is also<br />sympathetic,because he has mixed feelings,but has to follow the law.he<br />comes off very convincingly as someone who is conflicted.the movie is<br />well paced and appropriately dark.even before the end of the movie,i<br />thought it was well done,but the ending caught me totally off guard.it<br />elevated the movie a notch.for me,The Brave One is a 4.5/5</p></br><a href="../users/A9LAPV8XNKZVZ.html">A9LAPV8XNKZVZ</a><br/><p>Great scenes with Foster and Howard lift this from the average. A ridiculous finale drags it down. What's with the modern movie endings? Too much audience participation? Cowardly studios? "No Country..." had guts.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>It's a revenge story set in New York City. It sounds like a female version of "Death Wish" at first sight, but things are more complicated as "The Brave One" stars Jodie Foster as Erica Bain, whose terrible experiences in the park turn her from a radio talk show host living happily into a one-woman vigilante squad. Among many A-list actresses that you can think of, Jodie Foster would be the most unlikely one to be seen in such a revenge story.<br /><br />But she is, and she is very good as you expect. The film gives Erica several occasions (pretty conveniently, I am afraid) to use her weapon, but the strength of "The Brave One" directed by Neil Jordan lies not only in suspense surrounding her "missions," but in how crimes (including Erica's) change her personality. Violence is depicted as it is, not glorified in any way and what she does is also often described as nasty and Jodie Foster is excellent showing her character's changes.<br /><br />So far the film is great. Neil Jordan also emphasizes the relations between Erica and the police detective (Terrence Howard), which is another merit. Unfortunately, however, reliable supports like Mary Steenburgen and Jane Adams (especially the latter) has virtually nothing to do.<br /><br />But I was disappointed with the final 20 minutes where the film becomes something different (though I cannot tell exactly how here). All I can say is that "Death Wish" is often accused of being a crowd pleaser, but "The Brave One" looks as if it wants to please us more. Very realistic depictions of crime and its victims are turned into a concluding sequence which is simply unbelievable in more than one way.<br /><br />Please see it for yourself if you want to know what I mean. I can assure you Jodie Foster gives strong acting yet again and I am sure that much of the film's power comes from her if not the script itself.</p></br><a href="../users/A14Q6R4481YFFG.html">A14Q6R4481YFFG</a><br/><p>Jodie Foster's Erica Bain is the host of a smug, NPR-type radio program.  She lives in New York, which she bills as the "safest large city in the world."  After her boyfriend is killed and she is beaten almost to death while walking in the park at night (New York's still not *that* safe!), she and a new friend, Mr. Nine-millimeter,* embark on a voyage of self discovery, and together they explode the myth that it's only conservatives who love gunning down the bad guys.<br /><br />Like her predecessor Charles Bronson's Paul Kersey, Ms Bain's killing spree is tasteful and politically correct.  She kills a properly diverse group of thugs, pervs, wife-beaters and drug-runners.  Also like "Death Wish," we know our lead character is really a good person at heart, because of the emotional trauma she goes through after gunning down each criminal.  The Brave One is definitely a worthy update to the classic original.<br /><br />*  Ripped off from Pulp Fiction.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>I enjoyed The Brave One more than I thought I would. The plot is familiar, but the acting really elevates it above the average film it is. Jodie Foster turns in her best performance in quite some time and Terrence Howards is very good as well. It took me a while to get into the film, but once it got a hold of me it didn't let go. You will feel as abused as Jodie Foster's character by the time the credits role. A worthy DVD rental for sure, but you may want to pass seeing it in theaters.<br /><br />3 and 1/2 out of 5 stars</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZBOBV9H1HDV.html">A3LZBOBV9H1HDV</a><br/><p>"The Brave One" is great!

You have to shoot first, kill the shopkeeper as soon as you enter the corner store, then take the money without even checking if there is anyone around and then run. Killing is always the first step of that crime. Stealing is second and cleaning up is even farther down the road to hell. Who cares anyway since most of these criminals are still running, no matter whether they have been "introduced" to a judge and a court or not.<br /><br />The police has no power whatsoever when confronted to these thugs. The vigilante reflex is then one possible reaction from the public, passive most of the time but one out of a million makes about 15 ready to draw their guns and start shooting at them. Shooting them dead of course.<br /><br />The second problem is the point of view from which this film is seen, that of the victim of some violence of that type who has managed to survive by sheer luck. She wants to get out of this past but this past will never be bygone, so it has to be expurgated, purged, flushed away and the homeopathic method, since the standard police doctor is out, is the best way to extinguish the pain.<br /><br />The rest is the final twist. You will not be able to foresee the end even if you know the victim at stake here is a radio show anchorwoman. Radio people often have a strange imagination because they are used to being invisible since they are only a voice.<br /><br />Enjoy the ending, and the in-between details. A good film altogether and the vision of Central Park is slightly less conventional than usual.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU</p></br><a href="../users/A2LXG7XUQNZO6E.html">A2LXG7XUQNZO6E</a><br/><p>Solid Acting? Check. Jaw-dropping violence? Check. Jodie Foster looking exceptionally well for her age? Check. Hmm, this sounds like a winner, doesn't it? Well, believe it or not...it is. The Brave One is a believable and effective revenge thriller that's highly reminiscent of 1974's Death Wish. In my opinion, Death Wish is a classic and Bronson is the man's man to end all man's men but Jodie Foster acts circles around Bronson and, let's be honest, is far better looking. Does that mean this is a better film? I wouldn't say its better but it's a darn good film nonetheless.<br /><br />The Brave One kicked tail, it really did. It wasn't amazing but I let out some audible gasps while watching this as well as a "Holy Crap!" once or twice and that spells entertainment in my book. It's never going to be a classic or anything but nu-sploitation films like this and Death Sentence have really put a smile on my face. If you haven't seen The Brave One, do so. Foster may walk soft (and occasionally manly) but she carries a very lethal stick.</p></br><a href="../users/A319Y83RT0MRVR.html">A319Y83RT0MRVR</a><br/><p>A great character drama, with vivid colors and cinematography, it's the kind of movie that reaffirms the best of what Neil Jordan has to offer. This movie is best on reflection rather than as you are watching it. The themes and the characters are unusual and different and controversial. And that's precisely what makes this movie so engrossing and on-the-edge of your seat thrilling. Jodie Foster and Terrance Howard both give remarkable performances, but one doesn't expect anything less from them.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>I sometimes get dubious of these kind of films: these "message" films where it'll try to take good, hard looks at a certain societal problem and try to examine why it is we do what we do or why things are the way they are. Problem is they are good films with a message but there's not a good enough film attached to it to really elevate it or it's just a good film whenever you put it on and whether you'd even put it on sometime in the near future or even remember it is another problem. While it does have very solid acting all around, it does have nagging problems in its script, rather unbelievable scenes and events and a rather inappropriate ending given its tone.<br /><br />Erica Bain is a radio host who walks the streets of New York City, recording its sounds and waxing poetic about the ever-changing atmosphere and the stories within it. Happily engaged to doctor David, her life completely hits bottom when, out walking their dog, they're brutally attacked leaving Erica out for three weeks while David dies from his injuries. Grieving and shaken, Erica can't seem to function much anymore and buys a gun to feel more secure but when she kills a robber who murdered the store clerk, Erica becomes a different person and fears who that is while giving in to it anyway.<br /><br />Detective Mercer is investigating the victims in Erica's wake where her actions speak of a vigilante who takes down the criminals cops don't have the manpower or time for. Mercer is not content at letting people take the matter into his own hands but with Erica becoming interested in the investigation, Mercer can grow ever more suspicious about Erica's involvement and their developing friendship.<br /><br />The film in the end has 2 messages: does it make it right to stop crime by righting the wrongs the wrong way and do we really understand who we are if not given the opportunity to find out. Like a lot of films, the premise and moral uncertainties end up being more interesting than the film that deals with them since the film, as impeccably made as it is, just falls into pitfalls it shouldn't. A cute radio host literally does not get anything resembling violence towards her the whole time she's lived in New York and one incident has her practically attacked on a weekly basis? Or the useless Mercer partner character? Or Erica's art gallery friend that is literally in 2 scenes? Or its tonally wrong ending which essentially shoots down any moral debates it was generating? It's things like this that drag the film down.<br /><br />That being said, at least the film has some great acting and Jodie Foster always manages to bring gravitas into a role even if it wasn't required in the first place (like, I don't know...Panic Room? Flightplan?) While she is given some bad B-movie dialogue during her Superwoman scenes, it's the struggle and humanity that seems to diminish is where her talent comes through. Also delivering solid work is Terrance Howard who helps flesh out a character that could've easily have been some speaking-wisdom-from-the-podium type role where he's just there to clarify that the world can indeed suck from time to time. Unneeded though is Nicky Katt who basically plays the wisecracking partner and is simply somebody Mercer can talk to in crime scenes without having to talk to himself (which to be honest, Howard could probably pull off).<br /><br />Awhile ago, I rented a movie for my mom which she quite liked when she first saw it. A recent trip to the video store, she came across the same movie and asked whether or not we saw it. Me having a good memory, I said yes and mom looked at me like "huh...weird I don't remember". That's kind of like the Brave One: you see it and it's good; let it sit for awhile and can't remember much from it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2J57EQ9KPGXR9.html">A2J57EQ9KPGXR9</a><br/><p>Jodie Foster stars in the movie as a woman, traumatized by violence, who goes on a shooting spree - Punisher-lite style. The Brave One is like a toned-down version of Punisher War Zone, minus the black costume, the big guns and all the cartoon violence.<br /><br />  I must admit that I fast-forwarded through the plot set-up scene (people run around late at night in Central Park not paying attention? Really? Nope. Stupid plot twist..) due to its silliness. So the woman reacts to her attack by getting a *gasp* Devil Machine - a gun. Immediately, it turns her into a short,skinny version of Frank Castle - blowing away "bad people" left and right. Of course, the cops are stymied, except for one guy of course.<br /><br />After watching the whole movie, I thought, y'know if she (or her boyfriend or both) had that gun in the beginning, there would'nt be any movie at all (personally, I think Jodie should have gone with a snub nose .357 instead of that 9mm - more stopping power and less chance of a fatal jamming incident, but thats just me..). And of course, she is able to get a gun illegally in 5 minutes, in Manhattan - OK, if you say so Jodie. Also, on a side note - you never see her cleaning the gun, a big no-no if you are going to use an automatic. The whole "guns are bad, they make nuts nuttier" premise of the movie is lost amid all the violence.<br /><br />The Brave One is not a horrible movie, however. I've seen worse. The acting is decent as well as the cinematography and the pacing picks up after the first 15-20 minutes or so. But the anti-gun message really misses the marke here.</p></br><a href="../users/A18MBO1U4DPY20.html">A18MBO1U4DPY20</a><br/><p>Jodie Foster was the perfect person for this role although I felt the reason it seemed somewhat awkward is because we are not used to seeing her as a victim who's lover has been dealt away with. She's had a good run of late and has done some very good films. Flightplan. I quite liked, among other films I thought Inside Man was good although her consequence to the plot is limited, Panic Room was a great film. It's 2008 and she's 45 and she looks 45. There is an element of fearlessness I see in Jodie Foster which truly comes out when she acts in films such as this one. I'll stop being POP TATE and will get to the chase.<br /><br />The Brave One starts with an accident, drags for 10-12 mins, features an amazing performance from the ever-so-improved, Terrence Howard (from the amazing CRASH and the recent good film called "Air I Breathe"), Naveen Andrews has a small role and I couldn't help but notice how well he fit the part and looked it. The storyline isn't much that but there are several instances where human intricasies are bought out. For instance, there is this one scene in which the cop asks a person who just enters the police station to have a seat and offers a kind word. He later offers exactly the same kind word and greeting to the other person and so on. I think it was remarkable how that was done. I found the one scene in which the young man describes Jodie Foster pretty funny but that's the only scene in the film I'd call funny.<br /><br />If you're watching THE BRAVE ONE at the theater, you can't help but share the resentment and downright hatred the central character feels towards degenerates that often flog streets of the urbs and subway trains. There was definitely a lot of imagination involved in the abilities of one single woman but the particular subject matter had to be dealth with. My review says one can't quite describe in words the message of the film but I'll give it a try.<br /><br />This film talks about an often over-looked downside of a city. Festering in small corners are unhappy, unyielding, morally dwindled lives that are what society terms as troublemakers. I dislike degenerates immensely. There is a world that exists and police, law and order, mafia, protection can do nothing about it. But a gun and a heavy heart can or rather might.<br /><br />I'll stop meandering. You will relate to this film if at any stage of your life you have felt helpless. It is for that moment we replay in our mind, always cringing, but wishing we had done something or said something to the trouble maker.<br /><br />Pretty good film. I'm not feeling very generous so ignore the three stars now, will you.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>Trauma, severe trauma, can unleash aspects of the human personality that may appear as a stranger within. Such is the premise for this well-constructed film by Neil Jordan (screenplay by Roderick Taylor and Bruce Taylor), and while the neither concept of trauma-altered personality or revenge tales is new, THE BRAVE ONE alters the vengeance idea just enough to make it credible and to even draw the viewer into believing that what the character is doing is justified and right!  And that is perhaps the most frightening aspect of this terrifying film.<br /><br />Erica Bain (Jodie Foster) is a night radio talk show performer, a woman who walks the city of New York gathering sounds and observing the mysteries of the 'safest big city' and relates her observations poetically to a large radio audience.  Erica is engaged to young physician David (Naveen Andrews) and the couple are very much in love. One night on an evening stroll with their dog they are attacked by thugs, beaten with pipes, and David is killed while Erica narrowly survives. Upon awakening from her coma she is devastated by her loss of David and becomes a strangely haunted woman, unable to sleep, unable to get immediate help from the police, and turns to purchasing a gun in an attempt to right the wrongs she has suffered.  This new 'person' or 'stranger within' happens to witness a murder in a little store and to her amazement she responds by killing the murderer.  A similar situation happens on the subway where two thugs threaten people, threaten Erica, and Erica again responds by killing the thugs. She feels driven to avenge the death of her David, but at the same time fears her own inner stranger. Erica returns to her radio show, under changing instructions form her boss Carol (Mary Steenburgen), and finds the changes in her psyche result in bracing her listeners about fear on the streets.  In her audience is Detective Mercer (Terrence Howard) who has personal problems related to the fact that he has been unable to arrest a known killer.  Mercer connects with Erica in various ways, she interviews him for her show, and the two bond.  Erica trusts Mercer, wants to share what she is doing, yet hears his frustration about not being able to seek his own brand of revenge frustration against the oily killer he pursues, and decides to eliminate that trauma for Mercer.  As the tension builds, the identity of Erica's assailants is discovered, and how she deals with these thugs (and with Mercer's interaction in the solution) forms the surprising ending for the film.<br /><br />Too little has been written and said about the quality of performances from both Foster and Howard in this tense thriller.  These two actors deliver performances so sensitive in execution that memories of previous similar films evaporate.  This is a tough film to watch for all the violence not only on the screen but from within the characterizations by the actors (with the capable direction of Neil Jordan), but it is for this viewer one of the strongest films of the year.  Perhaps now that the DVD can be viewed within the safety of the home more people will pay attention to a film that deserves awards.

Josh Taylor<br /><br />Erica Bane played by Jodie Foster is one of those women you want to emulate. She is a free wheeling, honest, liberated woman who loves her job and her man. She works for an NPR like station in the 'safest large city in the world". Her voice is authentic and sexy, intelligent and draws you into her world. She loves her life until...Erica and her fiancee are walking their dog one evening in Central Park when they are both assaulted by a team of thugs. Erica is badly beaten, and her fiancee is beaten to death. One moment in time when your life is unalterably forever changed.<br /><br />Erica takes three week to recover from her head injury and she goes home, alone to her empty apartment. It takes her days to weeks to obtain the courage to walk out the front door. This tragedy has left her changed, she lives in fear, but she finally determines she will no longer allow the fear to rule her life. Erica buys a gun.  She is weak and fearful but she cannot sleep. So, Erica walks the streets at night. She witnesses a convenience store murder and in self defense kills the perpetrator.  In this one instance Erica faced her fears and killed them with a gun.  As time goes on, Erica faces her fears with her anger spurring her on. What is it that is pushing Erica on? In my mind it is facing her fears and surviving.  The film is brilliant in its depiction of Erica facing these fears- her anxiety, her grief. The film gives Erica enough time to explore the confusion, frustration and sadness that envelopes her. This is an extraordinary performance by Jodie Foster, one of her best.<br /><br />Into the picture comes a police detective played by Terrence Howard. This is one of the most believable performances I have seen. My eyes were opened to this man with his sexy, open, honest performance. He is the only member of the police department who actually listens to Erica. She is torn and tormented by what she is doing but she can't stop.<br /><br />The grit and determination, the reality of a life living and facing your fears is open for a look within. What this terror, grief, and violence does your life is open for us to view. The clues left and discovered by the police detective is also open for us to view. An extraordinary film that does not gloss over nor trivialize the passion, fears and self loathing that becomes pervasive.  I was truly mesmerized by these performances and the film.<br /><br />Highly Recommended.  prisrob 02-07-98<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005Y1UT">The Accused</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000O179I6">Spark</a></p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>As some have mentioned, this story has been told before.  It's been told plenty of times to be more exact.  The lack of originality aside though, `The Brave One' still delivers on quite a few levels and manages to leave the audience satisfied.  In fact I'm a little stunned at the critical beating this movie took.  Some critics made this out to be so terrible that I almost stayed away entirely.  I've never been a real fan of Jodie Foster and Terrence Howard just irritates me to no end so really the film had no draw on me to begin with; and then the critics attacked and so I was left with absolutely no reason to give it a chance.  Then I found myself alone and bored with nothing to do but watch TV and the only movie on Pay-Per-View I hadn't seen was `The Brave One'.<br /><br />I will say this first and foremost; both Foster and Howard have never, and I mean NEVER, impressed me more than in this film.  They are the beating heart here, the reason upon all reasons to give this movie a chance.  Especially Foster, but I'll get to her in a minute.  Howard really sunk into his role and pulled up every ounce of his characters vulnerability.  I remember back in 2005 when Howard starred in `Crash' and `Hustle & Flow' and everyone was singing his praises as the next big thing.  I remember so well because I didn't get it.  His performance in `Crash' was choppy and uneven, a little forced even and his performance in `Hustle & Flow' was decent but to me it ended up being 70% hype and 30% delivery.  Here I actually saw what everyone had been claiming to see for so long.  Here I finally saw him shine.<br /><br />`The Brave One' tells the tragic story of Erica Bain, a middle-aged woman about to be married to the man of her dreams when she and her fianc&eacute; are brutally attacked and their dream is shattered.  Her fianc&eacute; dies as a result of the attack and she is critically injured.  Upon recovery she realizes that she is no longer the person she once was.  She is trapped in this shell of fear and pain that engulfs all that she does, every decision she makes and ultimately shapes the person she will soon become.  Her first step was buying a gun, a gun she initially purchased to protect herself from the very people she now feared so much but that gun soon led her down a path she didn't know was going to be presented to her.<br /><br />Jodie Foster has been a critically praised actress for years now.  She's won two Academy Awards for her performances in `The Accused' and `The Silence of the Lambs'.  She's been considered one of our greatest actresses for quite some time but it wasn't until I saw this film that I understood why.  I actually thought that Foster was overrated.  She utterly blew me away here.  This is by far her finest performance and to me is one of the best performances of this year, period.  Her fragility, her vulnerability but most importantly her strength help elevate this character so much.  There's a scene where she returns to work for the first time after the attack and she's struggling to talk, struggling to put herself out there and then all of a sudden a clicks.  Her voice deepens, her eyes squint, her face tightens and in those few moments I was spellbound by her brilliance.  She was captivating.<br /><br />`The Brave One' is not the best film out there.  It suffers from some clich&eacute;s and a lack of originality but it has two very strong performances in its corner to help it survive.  Despite its flaws it never falls apart or loses our interest.  Foster commands every scene she embodies and carries this film straight on through to its closing.  Put aside the fact that you've seen this plot unravel before and embrace the electric performances that embody the soul of this film.</p></br><a href="../users/AZCDCO6KK2T81.html">AZCDCO6KK2T81</a><br/><p>A powerful and Oscar worthy performance by Jodie Foster is unfortunately overlooked because far too many associated this film with Charles Bronson's classic <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000541AN">Death Wish</a>.<br /><br />While there are definitely similar themes in both films and strong performance are given by both leads, this film is far more cerebral with its approach than Bronson's film.  We feel Foster's pain more via her bravura performance and especially since as a radio DJ she has the unique opportunity to air her thoughts on the subject at hand, vigilantism, and hear how others think of her actions (without realizing they are actually speaking to the vigilante herself).  This puts a powerful psychological spin on the story often lacking in other similarly themed films.<br /><br />I also found the title intriguing as it may be asking a question more than defining a character here.  Foster's Erica Bane, clever choice in last name which means burden or cause of ruin, is conflicted over whether her actions are praise-worthy or even brave as both topics come up on her radio talk show.  Her reaction is bewilderment to think others think she is brave when she believes she is acting out of fear, and disgust for those that think she is "doing the city a favor" somehow or for finding her behavior easy.<br /><br />She does her actions as a compulsion to rectify a wrong, to vent, and, yes, get revenge.  She does not believe she is "helping" the city and is angry at that perception and with herself for this obsession that is now invading every part of her being.  These criminals who hurt her have taken more than her finance, they have taken her peace of mind and a chunk of her life and she is angry that many don't understand this.  She feels very misunderstood by most except for a detective, excellently portrayed by Terrance Howard, who is on to her, but very sympathetic as he is something of a tortured soul himself.<br /><br />The film explores just who is brave here.  Is it Bane for facing her anger, for finding a manner in which to vent, for seeking resolution, for simply surviving her harrowing encounter, or is it the power that a gun gives one.  It's easy to be brave with a gun in your hand is an underlying message in this story as it was in a famous novel I just finished teaching my students this week.  Atticus Finch said in Harper Lee's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060935464">To Kill a Mockingbird</a> to his son Jem who watched an old woman die facing a battle most could not or would not face themselves and said, "I wanted you to see what real courage is, instead of getting the idea that courage is a man with a gun in his hand."  Courage isn't measured by how many bullets one has, but by how one faces a struggle in which one can't win.<br /><br />Foster's Bane seem to feel great anger at herself for the control that she has allowed some criminals to have over her life and for the power she was finding in a gun.  Isn't this why some carry a gun?  For power?  For control?  For their notion on what justice is or ought to be?<br /><br />Who is the brave one?<br /><br />Sadly, it isn't the writer or director who choose to take an emotionally charged and intelligently developed story and go down a trite, contrived, and completely unrealistic resolution to a story as provocative as this one started out as and could have and should have ended as such.  Those who like their stories to end with a neat bow will be pleased, but others who prefer realism and honesty in films will resent the cheap cowardly ending this film contains and that is my only reason for this film getting four stars instead of five and perhaps why it got snubbed at the Oscars even though Foster's performance and Terrance Howard as the detective keeping tabs on her are completely flawless even with the silly ending they are forced to act out with a straight face.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DHQ5WO80X1IZ.html">A3DHQ5WO80X1IZ</a><br/><p>Weak re-telling of 'Death Wish' with Jodie Foster as the wronged victim who fights (shoots) back. I'm surprised she was involved in this movie, both for the topic and the overall weakness of it. Watched the first hour, then ended up fast-forwarding through the last 45 minutes just to see how it ended.</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>This should have been great.  Jodie Foster doing a female Death Wish.  But good acting can't overcome a very predictable story.  It is fun to watch Foster change into a vigilante, but then it really goes nowhere original with that idea.  The basic plot is that Foster and her husband to be are attacked by thugs in the part.  Foster is beaten severely but survives, her boyfriend is not so lucky and is killed.  Foster then becomes a killing avenger while a divorced good cop slowly starts to piece together the mystery of who is killing all the bad people in New York.  The Blu-ray transfer is good.  A nice crisp clear picture.  I wish the movie were better.  Unless you are a huge Foster fan, this one is a skip.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDZNPO7U4E6N.html">A1CDZNPO7U4E6N</a><br/><p>First of all, I absolutely love Jodie Foster. I think she is one of the best actresses of all time with movies like.. "The Accused", "Silence of the Lambs", "Panic Room" and "FlightPlan". Secondly, I think this movie wasn't up to par with Jodie's talent because I know she's capable of so much more, so yes, I would have to say that Jodi deserved so much better. I know she did the best she could do with the story that she was given, but this was just not what I expected from her, and it's my opinion that this movie was better suited for a B-list actress. Actresses like Jodie, Hillary, Meryl and Halle don't have to accept just anything because after the way they have established themselves film after film they have nothing left to prove. Third, after the initial turning point of the movie (Erica and her boyfriend get attacked while walking their dog) I found this movie to be slow and boring for extended periods of time. I mean, there are moments when I found myself dozing off just waiting for it to be over so I could see the ending that everyone was talking about. Needless to say, I was less than impressed by what I saw, but I won't spoil it for others. Fourth, I hate the fact that this movie keeps being compared to "Death Wish" when in actuality I saw where this film paid homage to several different fims, and that goes double for the unrealistic ending that everyone keeps raving about. Fifth, I don't know if "Erica Bain" can be considered a "Brave One" because she went totally off the deep end, and went on a full fledged killing spree after what happened to her. Granted, all of the attackers in her case deserved what they got, so I guess that's where the fine line between vigilante and murderer come into play. Sixth, and lastly, Terrence Howard is another actor that didn't have to play this part. After films like.. "Hustle and Flow" "Four Brothers" and "Crash", I think Terrence could've done much better too. However, he did the best he could do with what he was given the same as Jodie. I just expected a whole lot more from him as well. At any rate, my recommendation for this fim is that you wait for video because it's worth watching at least once. Please, don't pay any money to see it though because it's not worth the price of admission. JUST MY OPINION FOLKS!!!</p></br><a href="../users/AE9GUE3HHOX3U.html">AE9GUE3HHOX3U</a><br/><p>I love Jodie Foster, but I did not enjoy this movie.  I had a problem with the storyline and some of the acting was a bit amatuer.  Jodie Foster did a great job playing her character, doesn't she always? But some of the other actors seemed like they were nervous, or just need more acting lessons.  It's hard to get into a movie when the actors don't seem like they know what they're doing.  There were too many improbablities in the plot, too many to name.  The dialogue was amatuer as well.  Like the whole "radiohead" thing they kept repeating, please give me a break. And the voice over narration by Jodie Foster sounded like bad poetry, that kind of poetry went out in the 80's.  It's like the script was written by a high school drop out.  I hope Jodie Foster picks better movies, someone give this girl a good script.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>Prior to seeing The Brave One, I saw a lot of preconceived opinions that the movie would be Death Wish 2007...a la Jodie Foster.

In Death Wish some hoodlums put the hurt on Charles Bronson's family and Bronson goes Medieval on New York City's bad guys with a roll of quarters in a sock and a gun.<br /><br />Well Death Wish didn't win any big awards, but it was certainly a cult classic that holds up to this day. On the other hand, I wouldn't be surprised to see Jodie Foster nab a nomination (from the MTV Movie Awards at minimum) for her role as Paul Kersey...er...um...I mean Erica "Pain" Bain.<br /><br />Foster really is a great actress and she makes you feel the agony that she is going through after the loss of a loved one. She also does an A-list job of taking a personality from Princess Leia to The Dark Side of the Force.<br /><br />Terrence Howard (who's in more movies in 2007 & 2008 than anyone I think) plays a cool, enjoyable to watch detective with his own mini side-story. But the key is that all of the side stories--and there really aren't that many--take a back seat to the primary script. The script that drew so many to the simple concept of Death Wish. The vigilante on the loose.<br /><br />The story is well-told and focuses on Foster's acts of retribution as much as the moral dilemma of being brutally violated, then taking severe action against the violating crowd, but questioning yourself and being questioned by the public for your response to the original attack committed against you (Hey, remind you any current events?).<br /><br />Director Neil Jordan keeps the action real enough in The Brave One so as to make you think you've got a window into something-that-is-really-happening. There are a couple of over the top sequences...especially in the last 15 or so minutes...but otherwise, the emotion, suspense and tense situations will keep you in your seat and thoroughly entertained for its full 2 hour runtime.<br /><br />The Brave One was definitely worth the trip off the couch and out to the theater. At minimum, don't miss it on DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>***1/2<br /><br />Call it the Sword of Damocles Syndrome of filmmaking, but anytime characters seem just a little too happy at the beginning of a movie we know that some unspeakable catastrophe is just waiting to befall them.<br /><br />In the case of Erica Bain and David Kirmani, that event is catastrophic indeed.  Erica and David are a deliriously contented couple eagerly making plans for their upcoming marriage.  One night, while walking their dog in Central Park, the two are attacked by a gang of hooligans who kill David and leave Erica beaten, battered and clinging to life in a weeks-long coma.  When she wakes up, Erica has trouble coming to terms with the terror brought on by what has happened to her and buys herself an illegal firearm, initially as a means of protecting herself from any future assault.  Quickly, however, she finds another use for the weapon, namely to go roaming around town eliminating any threatening malefactors unfortunate enough to wander across her path.<br /><br />It's impossible to discuss "The Brave One" without making at least a passing reference to 1974`s "Death Wish," the archetype for all those urban vigilante melodramas that became so popular in the 1970's and 1980's.  Erica pretty much fits the mold of those earlier antihero figures (despite the one obvious difference that she is a woman), although the writers - Roderick Taylor, Bruce A. Taylor and Cynthia Mort - and director Neil Jordan bring an added psychological dimension to the character (it might be nothing more than pop psychology, for all we know, but at least it's something).  The filmmakers work hard at trying to explore Erica's motives for what she's doing, even if one of the themes of the movie seems to be that there may not BE any real explanation for her actions.  Erica is a woman suffering the ravages of not only the grief of losing her fiance, but the fear, paranoia and psychological dislocation that result from violent trauma.  Erica - who hosts a radio talk show whose theme seems to be reflections on city living - keeps telling both us and her audience that she is no longer the same person she was before the incident and that she will never be that person again.<br /><br />Like "Death Wish," "The Brave One" is clearly more of a dark urban fantasy than a work of stark documentary-style realism.  The filmmakers never make the logistics of Erica's killing spree all that convincing, but neither do they descend to the level of cheap exploitative rabblerousing one might expect from such a premise.  The climax is not entirely plausible given the nature of one of the characters, but at least it avoids the easy, pro-law-and-order clich&eacute; it appears at first glance to be on its way to embracing.<br /><br />As Erica, Jodie Foster gets to play the Travis Bickle character this time around (though she is more righteous and considerably less unbalanced than her "Taxi Driver" predecessor), purging the city of bad guys and making the streets once again safe for decent, law-abiding citizens.  Her gun-toting Angel of Vengeance character may be a bit of a stereotype at this point, but Foster imbues her with enough humanity and depth to make her interesting.  The pain and torment Erica is feeling is often made palpable for the audience through Foster's multi-layered, emotionally complex performance.  She gets strong support from Terrance Howard, who does stellar work as the compassionate homicide detective assigned to investigate the killings, as well as from Naveen Andrews ("Lost") and Mary Steenburgen in smaller but nevertheless crucial roles.<br /><br />As a "study of violence," "The Brave One" pretty much leaves it up to the viewers to sift through and sort out their own complex feelings on the subject.  The movie neither glorifies nor condemns, neither endorses nor berates Erica for her actions.  It tries to understand her, but it doesn't feel called upon to judge her.  The filmmakers may, indeed, be copping out by not putting forth a clear message on the topic, but this noncommittal approach actually makes the movie more thoughtful and authentic.  Some may be enraged by the film, while others may be enthralled by it.  But few will have no strong opinion on "The Brave One" one way or the other - and that's what makes movie watching ultimately worthwhile.</p></br><a href="../users/A17FLA8HQOFVIG.html">A17FLA8HQOFVIG</a><br/><p>I didn't expect much from this 2007 film.  But Jodie Forster was in it and she's such a fine actor that I love seeing her work on the screen.  She's cast as a vigilante who takes out revenge on all the bad guys who come her way.  The acting is so good, however, that I soon forgot that this was a formula film.  Jodie Forster seems to actually live the psychological terror and helplessness that befall her after her fiance is brutally beaten to death as they walk their dog in Central Park.  Yes, the bad guys are all stereotyped.  I expected that.  And it reflects a scary New York of random violence that existed about 15 years ago and which is different today.  But it didn't take me long to relate to her and, to the director's credit, he kept the scenes short so they didn't weigh down the film.  Terrance Howard, cast as an understanding cop, is someone I admire too.  As the bad guys start dropping he soon becomes suspicious and his relationship with Forster is tense and complicated.<br /><br />Even though I knew the general outline of the plot, I was never bored for a minute.  This is not a great film,  but has great acting and a fast paced plot. I certainly recommend it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDNTB7377YH2.html">A1CDNTB7377YH2</a><br/><p>I thought that this would be another Death Wish rehash but it was actually a lot better than I thought.  Jodie Foster is a radio personality who is about to be married.  Her fiance is murdered by some hoodlums and Foster left for dead.  When she recovers in the hospital she seems to be possessed by a dark force seeking out revenge against all violent evil-doers.  Some scenes are similar to Death Wish and Bernard Goetz.  And like Charles Bronson in Death Wish she is being persued by New York Detective.  At first he doesn't suspect Foster but she seems to be at the scene of some of the crimes, using her radio personna as a cover.  He seems to be the opposite of Foster as he is usually powerless to act against evil-doers because the law ties his hands while Foster just blows the evil-doers away without a qualm.</p></br><a href="../users/A18758S1PUYIDT.html">A18758S1PUYIDT</a><br/><p>SPOILERS AHEAD!<br /><br />They just destroy in different ways.  The violence inflicted on the loving couple that kills one of them leaves the other with a wounded soul.  She tries to exorcise her demons by killing other criminals on the streets of New York late at night, but is increasingly haunted by her own actions and by the memories of her victims' last words.<br /><br />Even at the end, she insists to a sympathetic police officer that she has the right to kill every last one of her attackers.  Too bad they went for the weak, easy ending, wherein she gets to have her day and the cop lets her get away with it.  I don't buy that this could ever happen in real life.  A real cop would have taken her down and had her put in jail despite his own regrets and wishes to the contrary.<br /><br />Vigilantism and revenge may feel good or seem appropriate at the time, but they too leave irreparable scars and the person can never be the same again.

She gathers courage, finds out that the police are unable to help her, and buys a gun for protection against the many New York criminals. Several events follow in which she uses her gun and discovers the depths of her personality.<br /><br /> She is in a grocery store when a man shoots the clerk and wants to kill her so that she would not identify him. She kills him in self defense and leaves the store without letting anyone know what she did. She is surprised that she feels no anguish over the killings.

Together, they provide greater texture and moral ambiguity than what one would expect from a formulaic, overly contrived script by the father-and-son screenwriting duo of Roderick and Bruce A. Taylor, and Cynthia Mort. Foster, in particular, seems to be channeling her most famous roles into a greatest hits package here, as I can see aspects of her enraged rape survivor in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005Y1UT">The Accused</a>, her tenacious FBI agent in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LP6KNU">The Silence of the Lambs</a>, and her victimized pre-teen prostitute in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000R8YC18">Taxi Driver</a>. In fact, the film evokes the unsettling urban paranoia of Martin Scorsese's 1976 classic as much as it does the audience-pleasing vigilantism of 1973's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000541AN">Death Wish</a>, the movie with which it is most frequently compared in professional reviews.<br /><br />With a low-key manner that appears to boil just underneath the surface, Foster plays Erica Bain, a public radio personality whose descriptive observations take inspiration from living in New York City, which she acknowledges is a safer place but profoundly changed since 9/11. At the outset, Erica is in an idyllic relationship with a younger doctor and preparing for her wedding. As she and her fianc&eacute; walk their dog through Central Park at dusk, a group of thugs abuse and attack them and one actually films their brutal act. Erica survives the attack, but unrelenting grief over her dead fianc&eacute; leads to a consuming fear. Unable to move past the tragedy and growing impatient with the police to find the men responsible, she illegally buys a 9mm handgun to protect herself. Witnessing a crime in a convenience store, Erica confronts her fear head on and finds herself on the offensive with an inability to connect with her old self.<br /><br />It's at this stage of the film that Jordan treads precariously between an intriguing examination of the corrupting power of violence and a series of visceral thrills that has Erica feeling bracingly liberated by her actions. The latter finally overtakes the film with the script's overly coincidental plot turns leading to a questionable ending. Complicating Erica's monomaniacal path to her fianc&eacute;'s killers is Sean Mercer, a cynical, emotionally damaged detective who gets drawn to her fate both professionally and personally. Terrence Howard is solid as Mercer, but the contrived, purposefully ambiguous nature of his character undermines his credibility. It also feels like the relationship between Mercer and Erica has been left vague more out of plot convenience than thoughtful consideration of the increasingly tense circumstances. Regardless, it's Foster who makes all the melodrama watchable, even though the familiarity of her steely determination is starting to feel like retread.<br /><br />Smaller roles are not as well fleshed out, though the actors shine briefly - Mary Steenburgen as Erica's plainspoken boss; Naveen Andrews as the unlucky fianc&eacute;; Nicky Katt relentlessly annoying as Mercer's wisecracking sidekick; and in what amounts to a convenient plot device, Nigerian actress Ene Oloja as Erica's unperturbed neighbor. If Z&ouml;e Kravitz looks familiar as the drugged runaway Chloe, that's because she's the daughter of Lenny Kravitz and Lisa Bonet. Special mention should be given to Philippe Rousselot's cinematography which vividly matches the off-kilter urban landscape with Erica's unstable situation. The 2008 DVD is sparse on extras with no running commentary provided by either Jordan or Foster, who also served as one of the producers. There is a twenty-minute making-of featurette, "I Walk the City", in which Jordan, the producers, the screenwriters and the stars are interviewed. As usual, Foster comes across as the most articulate and insightful. In addition, there are five deleted scenes, all understandably excised from the final cut.</p></br><a href="../users/AU25GMX57XBVO.html">AU25GMX57XBVO</a><br/><p>I am not a big Jodie Foster fan but I have to say this movie I really liked, her role & the movie.  It has the 3 things I look for in a movie; keep my attention from beginning to end, take something away from the movie or can personally relate to it and a good, appropriate ending.  I don't want to spoil it for people who have not seen it, but the ending was great.  Sometimes an ending in my opinion can make or break a film.

Which, of course, is a beautiful thing.  Her eyes are piercing blue and translucent that give her particularly dreamy look in this movie.  She plays a woman who is attacked, along with her fiancee, in the NYC's Central Park as they walk the dog.  It is sensless and brutal beating and the scenes about the attack are disturbing.  While Erica Bain (Foster's character) survives the attack, her boyfriend is killed.  Considering how much in love they both were with each other, this outcome is devastating for Erica.  before long, she is cruising streets of New York at night taking vengeance on the bad guys in the grocery stores, subway and even her attackers.  During this she becomes friends withthe police detective who connects wih Erica's feelings onthe emotional level.  Being recently divirced, he suferred "a little death" compared to the real death of her boyfrined.  Both people are devastated by their lost companions and the lonely, cruel world thay are left into.  They understand each other completely and that is what saves this film at the end.  The strongest point of the movie is Foster's voice (she is a radio person) and her quiet narration of her New York stories is riveting.  Her voice is mesmerizing and her "stories" true beauty of this film.  If there is a book on tape with Jodi Foster narrating it, I want to know - because I want HER to tell me the story.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NL1KW56O3JR8.html">A3NL1KW56O3JR8</a><br/><p>I can't get overly excited about this movie.

Of course, the people she kills are all one-dimensional s**t-bags for whom the viewer has no sympathy so you're almost tempted to think that what she's doing is right.<br /><br />The best thing I can say is that TBO avoids the clich&eacute; ending I was expecting; kudos for that.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KEZLJ59C1JVH.html">A3KEZLJ59C1JVH</a><br/><p>The premise of this movie is a good one: Erica Bain (Jodie Foster), a public radio essayist, and her fiance, David (Naveen Andrews), are violently attacked in Central Park one night by a couple of hoodlums.

Afraid but determined never to be a victim again, Erica purchases a firearm illegally, and soon finds herself threatened by a man in a convenience store. Erica uses her gun to protect herself, and finds that the only way she can cope with her new life is to go around New York City and take out a bunch of bad guys vigilante-style.<br /><br />Foster delivers an excellent performance in this movie, as usual, and Terrence Howard is great in his role of a police detective. Unfortunately, though, there are so many things about this movie that are completely far-fetched, from the outrageous number of dangerous situations Erica finds herself in day after day to the behavior of Howard's character when he finds out exactly what Erica's been up to. It's very disappointing, because "The Brave One" has all the makings of a really great movie, but the script itself is really stupid in places, and that ruined the whole film for me. The best thing about the movie is that Erica's dog ends up okay at the end, and that's about all I really cared about by the time the film was over.

Jodie Foster plays Erica Bain, who is a DJ who gets beaten in a robbery, her fiance is killed at the same time and due to post traumatic stress turns vigilante. That is the story in a nutshell, but there are more twists and turns to the plot than my description would suggest and which I won't elaborate on to prevent spoilers. I've never been a huge fan of Foster, but her performance in this film was surprisingly good and you really get a sense of her characters fears and motivation for justice that impelled her actions. This film felt quite slow at times, but I was still kept engaged throughout. Some of the violence was quite upsetting and/or graphic, mainly the attack at the start of the film and this was a particularly hard hitting scene. This film uses some clever direction to enhance some scenes, like interspersing a love scene with a hospital scene, which made the brutality of the damage caused by the attack all the more powerful in counterpoint to the tenderness in the love scene. Overall, if you like crime films this should be right up your street and for a stellar performance from Foster this is the place to go. Not truly amazing, but a good film never the less.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></br><a href="../users/A34GZPHWYPSY2T.html">A34GZPHWYPSY2T</a><br/><p>THE BRAVE ONE (2007), aside from being Jodie Foster's last good film, was always in my estimation an argument in favor of the 2nd Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. With her powerhouse performance, Jodie Foster shows exactly what many gun owners experience to some degree; at film's end we are left wondering whether we should own a gun also.<br /><br />Foster plays Erica Bain, a New York City DJ who ruminates late at night about her beloved city. She's one of those sexy voices many people find themselves addicted to hearing on a regular basis, and is an excellent cure for the loneliness only a big city can create. In a brutal, sadistic attack in Central Park, Erica loses her fianc&eacute; David Kirmani (a very sexy Naveen Andrews). After awakening from a coma in the hospital, Erica suffers the natural meltdown upon learning of the murder.<br /><br />This rather precipitate storyline interested me in one singular point: once Erica seeks to buy a gun and receive instruction, she panics and yells that she must have a gun immediately or she "will die". That reaction in the face of a normal gun acquisition struck me as the loud indicator that Erica is somewhat out of her mind. She skips the formalities and buys a gun 'out of the trunk of a car', as we say.<br /><br />The scene with the trafficker giving her rapid lessons in a back alley is heartrending. Soon Erica is making her way around NYC, blasting away at all deserving bad guys. If you recall the tragic case of Bernard Goetz in the NYC subway decades ago, you'll understand her. Eventually she entices criminals only to shoot them down, but the first time she is forced to use her gun - in a store robbery - her horrible agitation and the adrenalin makes the scene that much more horrific and memorable.<br /><br />She is watched over, helped a bit, by a police officer (the wonderful Terence Howard as Detective Mercer). He seems to be the left-wing anti-gun voice in the film, yet he, too eventually gives way to the need for citizens to be armed. In an ending I will not divulge, the audience learns all about guns, whether we want to or not.<br /><br />As a gun advocate and one-time owner, which always shocks everyone, I loved this film for its unblinking approach to one person's need for a gun. Foster becomes like a junkie, spraying bullets quite expertly at the bad guys and glaring with maniacal glee once the job's done. She's protecting her city and its citizens. The fear of public retribution is probably what stopped this film from mutating into a weird vigilante-based superhero franchise.<br /><br />The cinematography is in my view rather unique and stunning for such a film as this. The acting is top-notch, though Foster carries too much of it by herself and Howard is left sort of panting after her in certain scenes. I know Foster wanted this film to be anti-gun, and approached it that way. She succeeded in evoking the opposite feelings, and I'd show this film to anyone, any age, who felt compelled to get a gun for self-defense.<br /><br />That is as far as I go in my appreciation of this film as gun advocacy; the producers would surely not thank me for it but there it is on screen! It is a real nail-biter, taught, tense and terrifying. A unique thing about this film is that I imagined every great director would have made it exactly the same way. That is one powerful film.<br /><br />Final note: read the review by Bama. Bama is a brave soul who was attacked like Erica Bain, and that made THE BRAVE ONE real and therapeutic for Bama. The idea that the victim is in a way dead, is post-crime a different person, is a powerful agony we must all try to understand. And Bama says something very Buddhist: you don't have to murder someone to take their life from them.<br /><br />If we learned that lesson, we wouldn't need any form of weapon at all.</p></br><a href="../users/AMYMJ96STIRW.html">AMYMJ96STIRW</a><br/><p>What a joy to watch a movie with this sort of quality acting and message. While this kind of thing would be great, if people like this were available in our society, they are not. But, for those of us who are disgusted with what our society, particularly in cess-pool cities like New York, has allowed inself to become, this movie is a great catharsis and a stunning triumph of the human spirit. Jodie Foster showed herself to be on top of the league of actresses available today.<br />Higly recommend to people of all ages, but young people should be told that is not a really possible way to handle horrible crimes...I think!?!</p></br><a href="../users/A126KX6FVI4T66.html">A126KX6FVI4T66</a><br/><p>As much as I may have enjoyed this movie,<br />I think it is questionable making heroes out<br />of people twisted by life into monsters they themselves no longer recognize.<br />New York has turned itself into an hell on earth<br />with greed, crime and drugs, such that those receiving crime<br />are hard to distinguish from those dishing it out?<br />The woman vigilante here is New York's finest?<br />Something is very wrong when the police have lost so much<br />respect that people take the matters into their own hands.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TEMNM9ZEOLJ6.html">A1TEMNM9ZEOLJ6</a><br/><p>Why does an intelligent actress like Jody Foster keep churning out these silly blood and gore thrillers? In this one, she takes revenge for the beating death of her fiance by pulling Bernie Goetz-like vigilante killings all over Manhattan while getting closer and closer to the cops as a radio journalist. She acts like some caped crusader, wiping out what she takes as evil. There's even a heavy dose of "Why don't they stop me before I kill again?" silliness going on. Trash, but watchable for a night's light entertainment.</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>This was entertaining. Sure, one can't help but draw comparisons and think back to the most famous vigilante film of all time: "Death Wish," but this film stands on its own story. No, it's not "Death Wish," but it's not far from it, storywise.<br /><br />It's different enough to keep us guessing what "Erica" will do next so, in that regard, it's good value for your entertainment dollar, particularly if you enjoy film noirs. This would be labeled a "neo noir" today.<br /><br />I was a little skeptical about Jodie Foster playing a Charles Bronson-type shooter, but she pulled it off convincingly. The difference in "Erica Bain" and Bronson's "Paul Kersey" was minimal except she seemed to be more depressed over who she had become, once she started killing. Foster, by the way, shows no signs of slowing down as an actress and this was a juicy role for her.<br /><br />The ending a little unsatisfying to a number of reviewers, both here and in national publications. That's all I will say on that, as I don't want to spoil anything for readers who haven't seen the movie. You make up your own mind what you think of it, and the message it conveys.</p></br><a href="../users/A2OFSDJB3MVQ16.html">A2OFSDJB3MVQ16</a><br/><p>Many people have compared this female vigilante film to earlier films like "Ms45" and "Death Wish" yet the fact that the sensitive Irish director Neil Jordan (The Crying Game, Interview with the Vampire) and Jodie Foster are involved plus the excellent Terrence Howard should make this a cut above those films. In many ways it is since instead of exploiting the violence that the main character creates--we get a sense that the closure will never come to that individual.  There is no catharisis, and Foster's character realizes what she is doing is wrong but she can't stop it? This element plus the superb interaction between Foster and Howard make this an above average action flick much much better than that terrible film which came out weeks before this one did ("Death Sentence" with Kevin Bacon).  What you make of the ending will depend on your perception of it but I believe it was disturbing and yet in a way, it was the best one available.  Recommended if you especially enjoy Ms Foster's work.  The HD DVD version which I bought for under  $6 is superb and a value at that!!</p></br></body></html>

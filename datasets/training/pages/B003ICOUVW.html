However, those were computer generated. After having seen Universal's The Wolfman, I found the version of it's creatures to be the best make-up effects of any werewolf I have ever seen. The film uses both CGI and make-up effects and did stellar jobs at both. I have my fingers crossed for an Oscar nom or two.<br /><br />If you want a cool looking werewolf in your movie, there's really only one man to call: Rick Baker. This is no wonder as he has won a whopping six Oscars out of the 11 for which he was nominated. He's done make-up for Eddie Murphy movies on several occasions and his list of Oscars includes The Grinch, Men in Black, The Nutty Professor, Ed Wood, Harry and the Hendersons and of course An American Werewolf in London. He's also done make-up for some of the best werewolf films to include The Howling, Wolf, Cursed and now The Wolfman.<br /><br />2010's The Wolfman will not disappoint werewolf junkies, like me. Whether you prefer upbeat horror flicks that are filled with blood and gore, or if you're prone to the old-school story driven style of the 30s, 40s and 50s horror classics; this film will satisfy your needs. It's essentially a beautiful collaboration of both tastes.<br /><br />It pains me to report that I missed the first few opening seconds of the film, as I walked in just in time to see the film's magnificent title page. I'm told however, that it opens with the killing of a man by a savage beast. Big shocker, I know, but this sets up the entire film. We begin in London in 1891, which is a terrific setting for this film if you ask me.<br /><br />Benicio Del Toro stars as Lawrence Talbot, the brother of the film's first of many victims. Lawrence's dead brother's fianc&eacute;e Gwen is played wonderfully by Emily Blunt. Gwen begins writing to Lawrence who has been living in America, in hopes that he will return home to assist her in finding his brother who has gone missing. Honoring her request, Lawrence returns home only to discover that his brother has become lunch to something unbearable.<br /><br />In addition to starting up a subtle romance with his dead brother's girl, Lawrence also makes an effort to rekindle the relationship with his bizarre father, Sir John Talbot. The legendary Anthony Hopkins (who was also in Bram Stoker's Dracula) plays Sir John and is terrifyingly convincing. He harvests a dreadful secret and creeps around his dark and lonely mansion by candlelight.<br /><br />Lawrence begins seeking answers in regards to his brother's death and eventually finds some. By "finds some", I mean he's bitten by a werewolf and slowly but surely begins to put two and two together, umkay. Lawrence begins having disturbing visions and develops a heightened group of senses. I don't think it's any huge secret, that he turns into a freakin' werewolf and starts slaughtering people, arousing suspicions; so let's just jump ahead and discuss what was done well and what wasn't, shall we?<br /><br />The new film offers several entertaining moments between Lawrence and his father, that weren't found in the original. It also adds some suspense and originality with Hugo Weaving playing a detective hell bent on stopping the creature, after his decorated failure of tracking down Jack the Ripper. These were all pluses, but they may be what caused the relationship between Gwen and Lawrence to fall short of what we saw in the original version. There just isn't enough build-up for their feelings to be warranted; especially considering that they have the mutilated body of a loved one, as a token of what brought them together in the first place.<br /><br />I kind of have mixed feelings about Del Toro's performance. I think he's a good actor and has the perfect look for the character of Lawrence. I liked that he played Lawrence differently than Lon Chaney Jr. did in the original. In that film, Lawrence was a bit of a comedian, and a happy chap, so it was a nice twist when his fate was sealed. Here, Del Toro plays him as a man with an already tortured past, having witnessed the death of his mother. I just didn't feel like Del Toro conveyed the emotion of the character to the extent that I know he could have, based on his previous work. The scenes between him and Gwen were the most notable of this.<br /><br />The transformation scenes were awesome; a great combination of special effects and make-up effects. Nothing looked phony and we see a few things we've never seen in any werewolf transformation before. I loved seeing the wolfman terrorize the streets of London. I could have done without the close-up superhero shots of him galloping though, and Roger Ebert had an interesting point: the creature moves around like he is weightless. He should not have bounced around the screen like an out of control pin ball.<br /><br />It's not that the gore was offensive or in bad taste; it's just that it seemed to be there for the sake of being there. It could have been spread out a little more or toned down. It was too hyped up is I guess is what I'm trying to say. The suspense of not knowing where the creature was and then seeing his claws rip someone to shreds from the darkness, was more satisfying. Or hearing him howl from off in the distance, or even seeing a flicker of him in the moonlight, running between the trees.<br /><br />The sets were phenomenal. It reminded me of the exquisite detail that went into those of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. We were never on a fake movie set; we simply drank some magic Kool-Aid and traveled back to an 1891 London.<br /><br />While I wasn't satisfied with the end of the ending (as in literally the last thing that takes place before the credits), with either version of the film, the climax in the middle of act three of this installment was one of my favorite moments. What takes place has been and will continue to be criticized by many. I found it very entertaining and I think it could have easily been cheesy but never was.<br /><br />The screenplay was no-doubt a good one. It was co-written by one of most talented screenwriters in Hollywood, Andrew Kevin Walker, who has hand-crafted for us, some of the best horror thrillers ever made: Se7en, Sleepy Hollow, Brainscan and 8mm.<br /><br />Director Joe Johnston has helped directors everywhere in regards to not being type-cast to one particular genre of filmmaking. Going from directing Honey, I Shrunk the Kids, to Jurassic Park III to The Wolfman, it's clear he can do it all.<br /><br />The film could have been a little better, yeah; but it certainly could have been a lot worse. It's a ton of fun, and will give you some chills. Nobody does horror films like Universal Studios and it's good to see them re-planting seeds to successful crops of their glorified past. Universal is by far my favorite studio, and werewolves are my absolute favorite movie-monster, so, there is really probably no way I wasn't gonna like this film.</p></br><a href="../users/AZAEJB1ECT9HC.html">AZAEJB1ECT9HC</a><br/><p>I enjoyed this film in the movies, I enjoyed the unrated director's cut on blu-ray even more.  Taking place in 1891, this is a remake of the original Lon Chaney Jr. film with some exceptions and plot differences.  Benicio Del Toro plays Lawrence Talbot, an actor, returning to his families mansion  in England to investigate the brutal death of his brother (that we see in the first scene in the film.)  Needless to say, this doesn't turn out to ba a great idea in the end.<br />My favorite aspect of this film is the sense of atmosphere.  The mansion where his eccentric father (Anthony Hopkins) lives is properly gloomy and cobweb encrusted and the forest mist-covered and freightening.  There are several very violent attack scenes, particularly one great sequence of the werewolf running amok in London.  Del Toro seems to be sleepwalking throughout most of the film although, to be honest, perhaps thats the way the director wanted him to portray this sad and disturbed character. (Del Toro talks about how badly he wanted to make this film and play this role on one of the retrospectives on the making of the film.)  Hopkins chews the scenery as his crazed father and Emily Blunt is properly lovely as his dead brother's fiancee with whom Del Toro falls in love.<br />There are many extras including deleted and extended scenes.  There are 2 alternate endings.  (After watching them, one can see why they were not used.)  There is much more "Making of" material including a segment on Rick Baker, who produced the amazing transformation scenes.  Baker won an Oscar during the '80s for his legendary transformation scene of another werewolf film: "An American Werewolf in London."<br />This film did not do well during its release earlier in the year.  As stated, I enjoyed it but I enjoyed the unrated version even more which runs almost 20 minutes longer.<br />If you want to see a wildly bloody and violent remake of a classic film, this film is for you.  Like The Wolfman himself, it probably deserved a better fate.</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>The box office bombing of this movie probably sunk the whole Universal classic monsters revival.  It really isn't a bad remaking of the original classic.  It has great atmosphere of 1800's England and some good actors.  Special effects are good, but not always flawless.  The problem with the movie is the 200 million dollar budget.  I am trying to figure out where the money went.  There aren't a bunch of 20 million dollar actors.  The special effects are certainly not the highest grade.  The sets and atmosphere are good, but not that great.  This looks like a 50 million dollar movie.  If it had been made for that much, it would have been lauded as a success and we would have heard talk of Frankenstein, Dracula, The Mummy, etc.  I think Universal blew the opportunity with this one.</p></br><a href="../users/A3T0OTH5072YRE.html">A3T0OTH5072YRE</a><br/><p>This remake of a classic doesn't at all do it justice.  While it hosts quite a few well-known actors, their superb playing cannot do anything for a plot that simply isn't there.<br /><br />Lawrence Talbot (Benicio Del Toro) is returning to his childhood home upon the disappearance (and as he learns later death) of his brother.  Having not parted well with his father it is also a homecoming of sorts.  His father (Anthony Hopkins) is currently playing host to his brother's fiance Gwen Conliffe (Emily Blunt) and it was she who let Lawrence know that his brother had gone missing.  Upon arriving he hears of his death and goes to look at the body, which is scarcely recognizable.<br /><br />Determined to find out what happened to his brother he bites off more than he can chew when he is attacked by the same creature.  Barely escaping with his life he starts to notice things are off when his wounds heal faster than normal.  Frightened that he too is becoming the werewolf told in the gypsy's folklore he has no time to do anything when his father has him shipped off to the insane asylum.  There he is subjected to a number of horrific tests and procedures.  He's not sure he will be able to endure it and is scared because in just a few days there is another full moon.  What will happen then?<br /><br />This movie could have been so much more with the cast of characters it provided.  As always, Anthony Hopkins, is delightfully creepy and does his role well.  However, the rest of the characters, no matter how good they could have acted, didn't have a chance with this movie.  The script just wasn't written well enough.  The dialogue was short and hardly had any substance to it.  There was nothing to make the viewer care for the characters.<br /><br />The cinematography was excellent and I loved some of the scenes and landscapes that were featured in the movie.  While London was pictured as dark, it was more than made up for by the countryside of Lawrence's family home and the creek and woods surrounding it.  There was a fair bit of whimsy portrayed that probably was done with computer manipulation.  I do find fault with the way the werewolves were designed.  Surely for the stage of technology that is available they could have been done better.  However, to me they looked on par with the werewolves in some eighties or nineties movie.  The music to accompany this film was only so-so.  It did a good job of being instrumental and clashing at the suspenseful parts, but it was nothing fantastic.<br /><br />Overall I would only rate this movie average.  It neither was terrible nor was it something I would be eager to watch again.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GMUNBN9HKRZS.html">A2GMUNBN9HKRZS</a><br/><p>Very atmospheric. Great lighting, shots, locations. Script/directing didn't made me care one way or another for the characters. If you don't care for them, hate them, or want to root for a character, or feel protective of them, want love to blossom, to savor bitter revenge on those that deserve it...it's just an unenvolving ride. Any emotions in this film just lay flat. We should be afraid of the Wolfman, but leavened with pity...as he is an innocent victem. Things happen, and I feel barely a nudge in the storytellers craft to get us involved. It's a handsome film, well made, but doesn't draw you in.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>Lawrence Talbot, a haunted nobleman, is lured back to his family estate after his brother vanishes. Reunited with his estranged father, Talbot sets out to find his brother... and discovers a horrifying destiny for himself. Talbot's childhood ended the night his mother died. After he left the sleepy Victorian hamlet of Blackmoor, he spent decades recovering and trying to forget. But when his brother's fianc&eacute;e, Gwen Conliffe, tracks him down to help find her missing love, Talbot returns home to join the search. He learns that something with brute strength and insatiable bloodlust has been killing the villagers, and that a suspicious Scotland Yard inspector named Aberline has come to investigate.<br /><br />The performances in the movie were absolutely fantastic. Benicio Del Toro, Anthony Hopkins, Hugo Weaving, and Emily Blunt all delivered and really brought their characters to life. It's always good to have great performances in a horror movie. The action sequences are pretty exciting and they'll keep you at the edge of your seat. Just when you think it's safe, something crazy happens and mayhem ensues. The 'kills' are also pretty awesome. The werewolf in this movie is pretty insane, so expect to see a lot of blood, gore, and human body parts flying around all over the place. The violence, along with the dark atmosphere, really gave a suspenseful experience. The pacing of the movie starts off slow to introduce the characters and setting, and then all of a sudden kicks to high gear and then goes back to a slow pace again. Finally, the ending wasn't that great. But overall, "The Wolfman" is a pretty decent horror movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD.html">A3PPXVR5J6U2JD</a><br/><p>My dad is a big werewolf fan.  I wrote a book on werewolves. So the notion of bringing the Wolf Man back to the screen is near and dear to my heart.<br /><br />This version is actually a new incarnation of the classic Wolf Man movie of 1941 from Universal Studios, which in turn was preceded by Werewolf of London. The new version incorporates elements from both movies. From Werewolf London, we get the origin of the werewolf originating in Tibet, dueling werewolves, and death by gun.  From the Wolf Man we get the Talbot family line, the "wolfbane" poem, and the silver wolf-headed walking stick.  Perhaps the biggest inspiration is the makeup itself, which eschews the now standard gorilla-werewolf transformation for a form that looks distinctly like the original Wolf Man makeup.<br /><br />Shakespearian actor and American Lawrence Talbot (Benicio del Toro) returns to his family manor after a long separation at the bequest of his dead brother's fianc&eacute; Gwen Conliffe (Emily Blunt). Conliffe is central to the plot; she enamors Lawrence as well as his father, Sir John (Anthony Hopkins), and it is her presence or lack thereof that drives the lycanthropes to murder. As the body count rises, Francis Aberline of Scotland Yard (Hugo Weaving) arrives to solve the mystery.  The hunt is on, but who's hunting whom?<br /><br />Benicio del Toro is undeniably wolfish-looking, but he seems wooden and out of his element compared to Blunt, who uses her big soulful eyes and gothic Victorian attire to good effect.  Unfortunately, they lack chemistry.  More imposing but erratic is Hopkins, who lends a cold menace to the cast.  Weaving doesn't have much to do but glare and shout orders, but then that's what we're accustomed to by now.  He does add "horrified stare" to his trademarked expression.<br /><br />Interspersed throughout the mystery is the family rivalry between sons and father.  The best part of the movie takes place in an insane asylum. It provides an ironic take on lycanthropy as a mental disease and contrasts Victorian logic with the lurking world of magic and curses.<br /><br />The Wolfman stays true to its roots.  This is not a remake as much as it is a reimagining, filled with lush backdrops, gloomy settings, ancient moors, and a Tim Burton soundtrack that pays homage to Francis Ford Coppola's Dracula.  This incarnation is a gothic period piece set in Victorian times<br /><br />Unfortunately, you get the sense that this new version is very insecure about its choices. The movie isn't particularly scary -- the horror is meant to be from the doomed plight of the protagonist -- but it nevertheless resorts to random shrieks and jump cuts.  The Wolfman, while undeniably violent, transforms into an over-the-top death machine capable of tearing off heads and limbs with one swipe of his claws. This isn't just a new version of the Wolf Man, it's the Wolf Man on steroids.<br /><br />Like Dracula, The Wolfman does not end well for any of its characters.  As a gothic romance the best we can hope for is a resolution, not a happy ending.  And that's exactly how it should be. The Wolfman respectfully carries a legacy of violent beasts on its hirsute shoulders, but mainstream audiences will probably hate it.</p></br><a href="../users/AHBNPMHDWZ7SB.html">AHBNPMHDWZ7SB</a><br/><p>The Wolfman is not the film that it could have been. It also was not as bad as people have been making it out to be. After seeing it, I did understand why alot of people hated it so much, and why it took forever to get production done, but I don't completely agree. The director was Joe Johnston, and while he may not be the best of filmmakers, I don't dislike his movies. I actually enjoyed Jurassic Park III, and Jumanji isn't a complete piece of crap either. But The Wolfman, like those two, just seems to have been done in his spare time, rather than his main focus. Even so, he could have done alot worse. Danny Elfman, the genius composer. His music is what really got under my skin and kept me interested in the story, because the cheap scares sure didn't. As odd as it may sound, that is what musical scores are made for. Pay attention next time you watch your favorite movie. Because if your favorite movies did not have the music they have, you would notice something special missing. But back to this movie. It's not the rotten movie that most of the critics on RT have made it out to be. I certainly noticed the flaws, but they did not spoil the experience for me.<br /><br />It is true that the pacing is uneven, like most have said. I could probally count the amount of screen time (in minutes) the actual wolfman got, with my fingers. That would not have been such an issue if the other characters were equally as interesting. Sadly, not even Benicio del Toro was very compelling as the lead Lawrence Talbot. I wanted to feel sorrow for an innocent man that becomes a monster, but del Toro didn't make me. Emily Blunt and Hugo Weaving are their usual selves. Very good, and believable. My favorite performance hands down goes to Sir Anthony Hopkins. He was great. In fact, I think his performance is what saves this movie, and makes it a standout in its genre. I haven't been a fan of the horror genre lately, but this movie does stand out. The art design was great as well. The dark old English setting was very effective. And the special effects were on point. Even the bloodshed was great, and I'm not big on gore. Although it doesn't bother me. What this film does have is charisma. Every scene with the wolfman was exciting. Throughout the film I found myself slouching in my seat, even daydreaming a couple times about what they should have done with certain scenarios to make the movie better. But as soon as the slightest sign that the wolfman was on his way emerged, I immediately perked up. And in the end, that is what made this a fresh experience to me. The Wolfman.</p></br><a href="../users/A370Z6I5GBWU44.html">A370Z6I5GBWU44</a><br/><p>For all the hype this movie got, once I watched it, it was a huge letdown. It starts off nicely enough, but started to unravel with a bad storyline and acting alike. The revelation about the mother, and the truth about the father just ruined the movie. For a classic and great werewolf movie, watch '<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005LC4E">An American Werewolf in London</a>'.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GD1G8XXPRYQ8.html">A1GD1G8XXPRYQ8</a><br/><p>I was afraid to buy this movie. I expected it to be bad and even worse, terrible. But in fact it was good. I liked that it was almost 2 hours of the movie, that way I felt the story didn't lack nothing. What I disliked, was the cast for the movie. I didn't like none of the characters. And what was cool, is that the movie is done in old fashion. And atmosphere for the movie is really great. What was too much, is some scenes where the main character was dreaming, but thought he was awake and suddenly a werewolf appears, then again and again and so quite a few times through half of the movie. All those hallucinations he had were not necessary to show. And of course all the old curses stories of the Hollywood and silver bullets. I didn't like how they made werewolves, but again it's like an old movie remake. And it was pretty original. So I don't love it, but I liked it.</p></br><a href="../users/A356RFKNIG043B.html">A356RFKNIG043B</a><br/><p>4.5 stars<br /><br />Just as you can't always trust good reviews, neither can you trust a host of bad ones, as for this Wolfman remake. It took me a while to get around to it, but I'm glad I did.<br /><br />I normally let Amazon's own "Editorial Review" slide by, but Robert Horton's is so laughably ignorant that it's worth mentioning. I sure hope they didn't pay him for it, unless it was a plugged nickel. He refers to the werewolves as all CGI when in fact they are beautiful real masks/suits and make-up by perhaps the greatest creature/powder guy in cinematic history, Rick Baker. Nice eye, Robert! What an expert. He also makes no mention of Elfman's exemplary score or Hopkins' wonderfully edgy performance, but of course makes sure to take the opportunity to dis Van Helsing, de rigueur amongst monster fans with zero sense of humor or irony, which VH was hilariously laden with. That half-blind fanboys like Horton are so insistent on comparing all new Universal efforts with the originals only highlights the strengths of this solid reworking of the original Wolfman.<br /><br />While that first lycanthropic gem certainly is classic, it also has its share of hokey moments, and for me there were few of those in this new version. It's no masterpiece, but I found it surprisingly enjoyable. It's gorier than the 1941 version, but not gratuitously. It's got its share of scares, but they worked organically for me and rarely seemed cheesy. I expected a lot more cheese here, actually, and even Del Toro held up well, no mean feat when compared to Chaney. Hopkins is just as good as Rains as Talbot Sr. in his own way, remolding the role to suit himself and coming up with one of his best scary takes since the original Hannibal. Weaving almost steals the show; as in The Matrix, he's the perfectly imperfect cop, and really knows how to make you both loathe and feel for his character. He's due for a major breakout role, as he sure is a fine actor.<br /><br />I also liked the rewrite; Von Sydow's mysterious donation of the silver cane is a fine touch, and many of the other new details work well. Rather than ape the original, director Johnston makes his own film and in its own way I think it holds up just as well. I loved the foreboding darkness throughout, and on blu-ray the various black depths come to life. The lighting is suitably dramatic and while there's little of Van Helsing's self-mockery, there are moments of sly humor that surprised me. Johnston uses the medium to great advantage; the tight cuts and quick flashes as the wolf enters into Talbot's system are excellent, and I the transformation scenes realistic and are as good as any I've seen.<br /><br />The BD has a tight transfer as well as many extra features, with some good interviews with the stars, a wonderful piece showing how Baker created his own version of the werewolf, and various other enjoyable shorts.<br /><br />I expected little from this film given its weak reception, but a reviewer whose opinion I respect here (certainly not Horton's!) wrote well about how decent it was, and I'm glad I read his review. That's why I find this site so useful: I can reliably trust those who share my tastes on other films, and use them to find films I would otherwise never have watched. And I can also happily ignore people who don't even know the difference between CGI great make-up and prosthetics.<br /><br />If you enjoy the dark foreboding feel of Victoriana in the Rathbone Holmes and many of the great old monster films, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised by this version of The Wolfman. I sure was. And as always, be sure to watch it at night with all the lights out!</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>I thought that Joe Johnston was a good pick to direct the 2010 remake of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002Y0KRDO">The Wolfman</a>. He's made two movies that I'm quite fond of that are full of action, scares and laughs (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXXS">Jurassic Park III</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000031EGV">Jumanji</a>), so I thought that with Johnston at the helm for The Wolfman, we might be in for more of the same. The trailer for The Wolfman sure made it seem like at least the action and the scares would be there, but ultimately I found The Wolfman very slow-moving and hardly scary.<br /><br />For a "monster movie", I want a lot of monster. Johnston's Director's Cut runs for a full two hours, and I'd say that there's a monster(s) on screen for maybe about 25% of the two hours. The rest of the movie is a bunch of boring Benicio Del Toro lumbering around looking more like that character Anton Chigurh from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0011BE3K0">No Country for Old Men</a> than Larry Talbot. Except when Chigurh was on screen in No Country you paid attention, when mild mannered Talbot is on screen in Wolfman someone better be there to pinch you if you want to be awake when some action finally starts.<br /><br />And surprisingly, with a cast that includes some other greats like Anthony Hopkins and Hugo Weaving, you'd think that a lack of action might be made up for by stellar acting. But if you ask me, those guys are miscast and gravely underused in The Wolfman.<br /><br />So my recommendation is to skip The 2010 version of The Wolfman, perhaps check out the original if you've never seen it, but if you want a really good werewolf story, go with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VLFE76">Underworld Trilogy</a>.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KY68OTSNHM3G.html">A3KY68OTSNHM3G</a><br/><p>Benicio Del Toro reprises Lon Chaney's 1941 role as the Wolfman.  Instead of being set in Pre-World War II London, the 2010 version is set in the late 1800s.  Del Toro stars as Lawrence Talbot.  He has just received a telegram from Gwen (Emily Blunt), his brother Ben's fiance.  The telegram states that Ben has been missing for a considerable time.  Leaving his acting troupe behind in New York, Lawrence returns to Talbot Manor to assist in the search for his missing brother.  Upon arriving, Lawrence's father Sir John Talbot, played magnificently by Sir Anthony Hopkins, informs him that Ben's mutilated body had been found.  Sir John said that the body was mutilated by some sort of beast.  Lawrence discovers that Ben was wearing a gypsy necklace when he was killed.  He takes the necklace to a local group of gypsies to determine its significance.  While there, the camp is suddenly attacked by the beast.  Lawrence is bitten while trying to help, and the beast flees.<br /><br />An elderly gypsy lady tends to Lawrence's wounds and she recognizes their significance; a werewolf's bite was the cause.  According to legend,, there is no cure for the bite of a werewolf.  The recipient then turns into a wolf themselves.  Now, Lawrence must face the horrible transformation each time there is a full moon.<br /><br />In the meantime, the detectives at Scotland Yard have been trying to solve the rash of killings.  The lead inspector, played by Hugo Weaving, is suspicious of the Talbots, and he's keeping close watch on Lawrence.  Sir John, thinking Lawrence is insane, has sent him to a mental asylum to undergo treatment. While there, Sir John visits Lawrence and reveals the identity of his brother's killer.  Lawrence is then bound to a chair and set in front of a large group of observers.  The lead psychiatrist tries to explain away Lawrence's condition, but the appearance of the full moon convinces them.  The inspector is on hand to witness this and barely escapes.  He knows with certainty about Lawrence's condition and sets off to finish him.  Meanwhile, Lawrence has returned to Talbot Manor for a showdown with his father, but sir John has his own surprise in store.  Lawrence's only hope of release is Gwen, but will she be able to help before it's too late?<br /><br />I've seen the 1941 version of The Wolfman, and I enjoyed it very much, and this film is very good as well.  I feel that Benicio Del Toro does a very respectable job in portraying the Wolfman.  One major difference in the two films is that the original movie dealt more with psychological terror whereas this new film has much more blood and gore.  The stories are similar in the aspect that Lawrence Talbot appears in both.  I thought the acting in this movie was very good, especially by Del Toro and Hopkins, and the computer-animated werewolves were scary.<br /><br />I highly recommend this fine reprisal.  Horror fans will surely enjoy seeing the Wolfman on the prowl once again.</p></br><a href="../users/A3F2JUHM6C9RZ9.html">A3F2JUHM6C9RZ9</a><br/><p>No chain-saws, no hockey masks, just a good old-fashioned horror movie! Solid performances and beautifully atomospheric photography and soundtrack combine with make-up master Rick Baker's remarkable prosthetics to make this WOLFMAN an absolute treat for fans of the Universal monster classic!</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>The Wolfman stays true to the old fashioned look and story of the original, but this time it's in color and we get folks being ripped apart piece by piece. The level of gore caught me be surprise. I knew there would be some to earn it's R rating, but limbs and heads leaving bodies and sailing through the air had my full gorehound attention. Rick Baker is still the man when it comes to creature makeup. He kept the original look from the 1941 version, only he added enough changes to make it far more menacing. Benicio Del Toro, Anthony Hopkins, Emily Blunt and Hugo Weaving are all in cruise mode here. None of them turn in a bad performance, but nothing memorable either. Still, the acting is fairly solid all around. The set design and cinematography add plenty of gothic vibe to establish a nice eerie mood. Most of the scares are the cheesy kind, you know, where something jumps out of nowhere and makes a loud noise. There is a good mixture of practical effecs and CGI (some good, some average), but I'm glad they kept the CGI to a minimum. The werewolf transformations are very good here and look painful. Francis Ford Coppola had a much better take on an old monster classic when he made Bram Stoker's Dracula back in 1992, but Joe "Jurassic Park III" Johnston did a better job than I thought he would in resurrecting this beast for modern audiences. It comes across well as an old fashioned horror tale, but with huge doses of animalistic violence and bloodletting, leaving no doubt that this is The Wolfman you shouldn't pet, but fear.<br /><br />3 and 1/2 out of 5 stars</p></br><a href="../users/A2GPN2VKS8E77C.html">A2GPN2VKS8E77C</a><br/><p>Academy Award winners Benicio Del Toro and Sir Anthony Hopkins star in "The Wolfman," a thrilling mystery/actioner based on Universal's classic 1941 film "The Wolf Man" starring Lon Chaney Jr. I hesitate to call it a remake because the plot is considerably different than the first one, except for some basic things at the beginning. From that point, it takes on a life that's all its own, emotionally and physically... Emily Blunt and Hugo Weaving co-star in this extraordinary motion picture with bite. Joe Johnston ("Honey, I Shrunk The Kids," "The Rocketeer," "Jurassic Park III") directs. Hugo Weaving in this movie reminds me of Sam Niell. I highly recommend this movie. SPOILER!!! The ending hints at a sequel...which I hope will be made. SPOILER OVER!!! Should have been rated PG-13.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EARN5PUVIF1S.html">A1EARN5PUVIF1S</a><br/><p>What a pleasant surprise!<br /><br />This is an exceptionally handsome big budget remaking of "The Wolfman" with an A-list cast, set in the late nineteenth century.<br /><br />The costumes and settings are spectacular, the effects are nifty, and the man/werewolf transformations are state-of-the-art.<br /><br />Connoisseurs will appreciate the fact that Rick Baker apparently masterminded the makeup effects.<br /><br />Bloody, scary, and exciting, this is a true horror film, in which a tragic protagonist is undone by his fate and ultimately delivered from damnation by the love of a good woman.<br /><br />The only reason I give this DVD four stars instead of five is the appalling lack of extras, which apparently have been reserved for the Blu Ray version.  This is NOT acceptable!!!  Studios should NOT penalize DVD viewers with such sleazy and greedy marketing tactics.<br /><br />Back to the film, this is a must-see for any fans of the classic Universal horror films.  Maybe it's time for a superior remake of "Frankenstein" and "The Bride of Frankenstein"!<br /><br />But is this DVD a must-own?  NOT until they add the making-of extras that appear on the BR version.

We are prepared for gratuitous violence. Gwen Conliffe (Emily Blunt) invites the wayward brother Lawrence Talbot (Benicio Del Toro) to put off his acting position and return to the old family home to fathom out the culprit, be it man or beast.<br /><br />I will not go through the story and al l its implications, as that is why you are purchasing this movie. However, the local Reverend Fisk (Roger Frost) had some rather unfriendly words about Lawrence Talbot's return. "There are those who doubt the power of Satan--the power of Satan to change men into beasts. But the ancient Pagans did not doubt, nor did the prophets. Did not Daniel warn of Nebakanezer? But the proud king did not heed Daniel. And so, as the bible says, he was made as unto a wolf and cast down from man."<br /><br />***** One overwhelming negative is the noisy background compared to the dialog volume.<br /><br />If you totally duplicated the film and just brought the technicalities up to date, it would be barley worth it. If you did as most movies do and just use the title many people who are comfortable with the originals as I am would hat it because there is nothing to relate. This film is a rare hybrid that brings the movie up to date, tries to maintain continuity and has a twisted plot. As a psychological thriller it barley scratches the surface. However, there is a clear love triangle as the hub.<br /><br />Yes, there is a quickie view of Max Von Sydow handing Lawrence a silver wolf's head cane.<br /><br />Hugo Weaving did a good job of acting but I kept thinking "Elrond."  Moreover, we wait for Anthony Hopkins' most famous line from "84 Charing Cross Road" (1987) where he says "Very nice, very tasty." If you are really looking for a psychological thriller with werewolves try "She-Wolf of London" (1946)<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CX8N">84 Charing Cross Road</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005LC4O">Werewolf of London / She-Wolf of London (Universal Studios Wolf Man Double Feature)</a></p></br><a href="../users/A3H9JSM1SUTE4O.html">A3H9JSM1SUTE4O</a><br/><p>Lawrence Talbot (Benecio Del Toro) returns to his family estate to investigate the brutal murder of his brother. Emily Blunt is the widow and Anthony Hopkins is the estranged father.  Eventually, Del Toro and Hopkins virtually tear up the screen in this often beautifully rendered, action-packed thriller.  Not taken from literature, but rather folk tales and of course the classic Universal film of the same name, The Wolfman still lacks a literary pedigree and heft, but this incarnation is just fine - especially the extended version "not seen in theaters."  Too bad the metaphor of the Prodigal Son, hinted at in dialogue during an early scene, is not played out in all it's inverted and demented potential of a father seeking redemption through his son.

Let's start with Rick Heinrichs, the production designer; his sets evoke a gothic style that may not be realistic, but is an absolute pleasure to look at. Then there's Rick Baker, who has proven time and time again that he's a master at makeup effects; his werewolf designs are convincingly primal, all ghoulish facial contortions and untamed tufts of fur. There's also Shelly Johnson, whose shadowy cinematography brilliantly captures the essence of the horror genre. Milena Canonero's costumes are effectively drab. Danny Elfman's score is wonderfully moody. From a technical point of view, this movie is a triumph.<br /><br />But as a story, it's a serious let down. I find this odd, since the basic plot is the same as the original 1941 film written by Curt Siodmak. I'm sure director Joe Johnston and writers Andrew Kevin Walker and David Self had the best of intentions, but unfortunately, they let their film fall victim to weak character development, unresolved subplots, and scenes that place gore above genuine fright. It's an updated film, alright - for audiences that favor heavy action and elaborate death scenes. Like so many remakes that have come before it, "The Wolfman" takes a neat idea and turns it into a shallow spectacle of art direction and special effects.<br /><br />The plot: In the year 1891, Shakespearean actor Lawrence Talbot (Benicio Del Toro) returns from New York to England when he learns of the death of his brother, Ben. For reasons I won't reveal, Lawrence has kept himself distant from his family, especially his father, Sir John Talbot (Anthony Hopkins), an unaffectionate man who lives in a sprawling estate so dreary, it's a wonder it isn't teeming with ghosts. When Lawrence gets a look at his brother's body, he's repulsed; Ben was ripped to shreds, either by a wild animal or a deranged lunatic. Prompted by his own grief - and by his brother's fianc&eacute;e, Gwen (Emily Blunt) - Lawrence takes it upon himself to get to the bottom of things.<br /><br />The discovery of a medallion on Ben's body leads Lawrence to a gypsy camp, where Ben had been acting as a liaison between them and the town. A mysterious old woman (Geraldine Chaplin) gives him the obligatory warning about an ancient curse, which is appropriate given the fact that tonight just happens to be a full moon. And that's right about the time a vicious werewolf attacks the camp, resulting in Lawrence getting bitten. You know what happens when a werewolf bites you during a full moon, don't you?<br /><br />Here enters Inspector Francis Aberline of Scotland Yard (Hugo Weaving), who has reason to believe that Lawrence is hiding something. Let's just say that the Talbots haven't been the happiest of families.<br /><br />The problems with this movie don't have much to do with the tone, although I must admit, the updated animal-attack scenes were a bit heavy handed with the gore. No, the real problems stem from the content, or rather, how the content was reinterpreted. Consider the inevitable romance between Lawrence and Gwen; while tragedy often times diminishes the capacity for overt emotions, the way these two regard each other is so low key that it's impossible to believe they would ever fall in love. It's never really explained why they fell in love in the first place. Maybe this has to do with pacing, since the final cut makes it seems as if they developed feelings over the course of one day.<br /><br />Some of the blame rests with the actors, or maybe with the way the actors were directed (it's hard to tell sometimes). Del Toro, an accomplished actor in all respects, plays Lawrence as an emotionless drone. He's quiet, monotone, and shows virtually no range - except, of course, for when he's transforming into a werewolf, at which point he's buried by computer graphics and makeup. Hopkins isn't much better; his character is a man of mystery, and yet he's so passive and matter-of-fact in his delivery that none of his revelations shock us. Not that it matters a great deal, since his secrets aren't all that plausible within the context of the story.<br /><br />It's sad when the technical achievements of a film upstage the story. There are moments of dazzling cinematic wizardry, such as when Lawrence hallucinates while under the influence of psychiatric drugs. You're amazed by the visuals, but you're also at a loss to explain how they're significant to the plot. To me, it all seemed like filler material, a way to compensate for a lack of imagination. Perhaps the film's troubled production is responsible; numerous reshoots and a rejection of Danny Elfman's score (which was subsequently used anyway) saw the original release date of November 2008 give way to February 2009, April 2009, and November 2009 before finally opening on February 12, 2010. With such long delays and drastic changes in direction, it's no wonder the end result is bit disappointing.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>I went into the theater to watch The Wolfman with an open mind and lowered expectations after reading so many bad reviews. I'm a huge fan of the original film, and I was prepared for a few changes in the original story, but I didn't expect them to do a complete rewrite! While this new Wolfman film is slick looking on the surface, the convoluted story line of this remake takes the original's brilliant and simple story and makes it confusing and tedious with too many unintentional laughs.<br /><br />****SPOILER ALERT****<br /><br />I have several gripes with this remake.<br /><br />1) Why does Hollywood insist on putting a romance front and center in every film at all costs!? The changes to the story are not only unnecessary, but absolutely ridiculous.  The original film did have a love interest, but it shared the center story with Talbot's father, who didn't believe in this Werewolf nonsense!  This made the ending heartbreaking in the original as Larry's father realizes he has killed his own son, making for a very dramatic climax! It's one of the most powerful scenes in the original film and it has been removed from the remake? This is like having King Kong win the plane battle on top of the Empire State building and go back to his island living happily ever after!<br /><br />2) There are too many sub plots, the brother's death, the mother's death, Larry's father is a werewolf, Larry is an actor?, Larry was in an insane asylum, Larry has dreams that make little to no sense.....etc...etc. This wouldn't be so bad if any of them helped to get the viewer involved in the story.....they do not!<br /><br />3) The make up created by Rick Baker is very good and I respect the fact that he pays homage to the original make-up, but Jack Pierce's original 70-year old make-up design is far superior. The CGI isn't too bad, but there are moments it looks cartoon-ish and unconvincing.  While there are some nice gore scenes, none of them evoke any fear because the film just isn't scary.  The Wolfman's howl is awful and it sounded like it was lifted from the film 'Teen Wolf', in fact the most ridiculous part of this film is the Werewolf battle between father and son, which really reminded me of 'Teen Wolf'!<br /><br />4) While the acting is very good, the dialogue is tedious and you know you're in trouble when one of the main characters has to give a speech halfway through the film to hopefully get everyone watching up to speed.<br /><br />5) The film tries to please too many demographics as it isn't scary--but it has some gore, it has a love interest--but it isn't moving and it has a good horror story--but it goes for the laughs.<br /><br />6) The film is only an hour and thirty five minutes, but seems longer and has no where near the atmosphere of the original.<br /><br />7) Danny Elfman's music score is inappropriately awful and doesn't even come close the the classic original score by Hans J. Salter!<br /><br />8) Benicio Del Toro gives a good perfomance, but there is no sympathy for him when he dies. While Lon Chaney jr. may have been heavy handed with his emotional performance in the original, Del Toro is not emotional enough and his character is not all that likable.<br /><br />The funny thing is as much as I thought this film was a missed opportunity, I still enjoyed it in a strange way. I just like monster movies I guess and it is unfortunate the studio didn't have the "sac" to make a film that was made for horror buffs and not for the "middle of the road" crowd. This could have been one of the scariest and saddest films of all time.<br /><br />In short the film looks good, but it just doesn't deliver the goods!  If you want to see some great Werewolf films watch the original Wolfman, Werewolf Of London, American Werewolf in London, or Dog Soldiers.</p></br><a href="../users/A16XRPF40679KG.html">A16XRPF40679KG</a><br/><p>I still like the original 1940's 'the wolfman' more than this one , it's a true classic and has lon chaney and bela lugosi, and claude rains in it. This one however is a good version,  All the acting in this one is done very well to be sure , I could havd done without the father/son struggle but it gave us a battle of the wolfmen for a climax so it did have some validity. This blu ray looks stunning though, just beautiful and that's because it's a modern film shot on high quality film. THe cgi effects look overall top grade too, one thing that's classic about this one is the way the wolfman looks ,much like the traditional version and it works very well in this movie. The wolfman is a frightening half man , half wolf creature that can run like a wolf. Something the original couldn't do but that doesn't make the original less a true classic movie though. The blu ray has the unrated version and the theatrical version , plus deleted scenes and documentary stuff which are in hd as well. I could do without the digital copy though if it will bring prices down lets get rid of digital copies for good. I don't buy this to watch on tiny computer screens or laptops.  Some people were turned off by the gore but lets be fair here this is a movie about a werewolf that tears people apart and eats them. The cgi effects have progressed alot since the last well bigger budget werewolf movie 'cursed' for sure , it's amazing how far effects have come in 6 years or less. Still only twits complain about effects of older movies they were fine for their day usually and still bring me enjoyment even from the 1930's era. The story is much the same about a man bitten by a werewolf who becomes one and fears and hates what he has become so that is a plus for this one. I would say that if you don't like gory movies then  you won't like this one , but it didn't bother me because I am a horror fan. And the people who made this movie were fans of the original wolfman series and probably the great paul naschys very gothic wolfman series; 'mark of the wolfman' and such which are worth grabbing too. 'night of the werewolf and vengence of the zombies' are on one blu ray , it's old school werewolf fun though don't expect cgi effects. But I love old horror movies. I have tried to grab most of naschys werewolf movies on dvd too. This is bloodier than those but naschys has alot of good vibe to it too.<br />I would say horror fans will like this movie and others may not, but at least it has excellent acting from the lead actors involved Benico Del toro is truly excellent in this movie. His torment is really conveyed to the viewer throughout this movie. So grab this one and check out naschys film too if you are gothic werewolf fan.</p></br><a href="../users/A39W3263A9HCMN.html">A39W3263A9HCMN</a><br/><p>The Wolfman is a remake that takes no prisoners, and boy, you can't help but love it.<br /><br />Remakes aren't a new thing, they've happened for quite a while now. But I wouldn't necessarily call this movie a remake, more of an alternate telling of the classic tale that we all know as The Wolfman.<br /><br />The movie begins as any movie called "The Wolfman" would- guy is making sure nothing oogie happens in the woods at night, he hears a sound, searches for where he heard it, then BAM- he turns around and is scratched by the wolf. So he runs and runs, and before ya know it, he's doomed!<br /><br />Anyways I wouldn't need to recycle the plot for anyone who knows the plot- Lawrence Talbot returns to his home in England after Tragedy strikes with the gory death of his brother. He is reunited with his dad and one night gets scratched by a werewolf. This leaves him with one thing he cannot control: at the full moon at night, he becomes a wolf.<br /><br />This movie is stupid? Yes. It's pointlessly gory? Yes. It hardly has a plot and is just two hours of Benicio Del Toro going around ripping people to shreds? Yes. But THAT'S why the movie is so good! There's nothing that needs to be taken seriously. It's just two hours of werewolf mayhem.<br /><br />The acting is excellent- everyone shines in the roles and it comes off as very stage-like. The special effects are great as always- and in total, the movie is just FUN. It's very fast paced, it thrills you for its duration. There's tonnes of gore too, which adds to the cheesy feel.<br /><br />In total, this movie is cheesy, exaggerated, overblown trash, and yet I loved every single second. The whole movie was thrilling and fun, and in short, if you can turn your brain off for 2 hours, you'll enjoy the pure adrenaline rush that is "The Wolfman". Hell, I own it on Blu-ray- it's a great movie!</p></br><a href="../users/A28OB1QLXN5BM6.html">A28OB1QLXN5BM6</a><br/><p>In preparation for watching this WOLFMAN, a remake of the 1941 classic by the same name, I watched the original starring Lon Chaney, Jr. and Claude Rains. I think it is fair to compare the two movies because the new one is so obviously patterned on the original. It's clear that the director was not trying to remake the classic as much as he was trying to refresh it. To some extent, I think he succeeded. While the original had all the earmarks of a B movie, the new one has very high production values, adequate special effects, and top flight actors. But what the original had that the refresh does not is heart. When Lon Chaney Jr. learned what he had become, I believed in his remorse and fear of horrors he was bound to commit. Benicio del Toro does pronounce the same sort of fear, but I never felt it. It was more of a checking off of a box. The same is true of the father's character, although that was intentional and to say more would be a spoiler.<br /><br />As I watched the new WOLFMAN, I kept waffling between liking it and being ambivalent toward it. After letting the experience settle for a few days, I've decided on ambivalence. There was really nothing about it that got me excited or fascinated or touched. So Lon and Claude can rest easy. They haven't been replaced yet.  In a perfect world, it would have been wonderful to see what Lon Chaney, Jr. and Claude Rains could have done with today's production values.  That would have been magical, I am sure.<br /><br />"Even a man who is pure in heart, and says his prayers by night, may become a wolf when the wolfbane blooms and the autumn moon is bright."</p></br><a href="../users/A3JLOIXFM75QNV.html">A3JLOIXFM75QNV</a><br/><p>The Wolfman is supposed to be a horror film but instead comes off as boring, predictable and not terrifying in the least. While the gothic atmosphere surrounds the entire film, the poor editing and lackluster acting really demotes The Wolfman. Benicio Del Toro is actually pretty bad in this. I can't tell if he is acting at all, which in this case, is not a good thing. He just sort of snarls some times and attempts to emote at other times, but it just wasn't working. Anthony Hopkins does slightly better, but his role is sadly underutilized and he can barely make an impact. Hugo Weaving is completely wasted here, a shame really as his acting has a broad range and he really didn't exibit any of it in this film. Emily blunt is subtle and sweet and while I liked her character, again, she just felt out of place.<br /><br />I mentioned the editing and UGH is it terrible. It jumps from scene to scene, from plot to plot and from one geographical area to a completely unknown one in bursts that it's extremely confusing at various times. There is no proper path from beginning to end, no direction of any kind. They tried to mix a mythical mystery with a love story and in the end it turned out to be a jumbled mess. I loved the dark, sort of spooky, grainy atmosphere and the costumes are always nice to look at, but, combined with the weak, barely-there plot, it was just a huge let-down. You can't call this a horror since there is nothing frightening about it and it's not really a drama since you really feel nothing for any of the characters. Perhaps I'm being generous with my 3 star rating, if I could give it 2.5 I would. I guess I have seen far worse than this, but still, a HUGE dissapointment.</p></br><a href="../users/AUUH6Z8MSGGF.html">AUUH6Z8MSGGF</a><br/><p><span class="tiny"> Length:: 4:35 Mins<br /><br /></span>Gina from Haunted Flower reviews the movie "The Wolfman", a remake based on the 1941 classic monster movie directed by Joe Johnston and starring Benicio Del Toro, Anthony Hopkins, Emily Blunt, and Hugo Weaving.<br /><br />[...]</p></br><a href="../users/A1P2NBM3P3TS2X.html">A1P2NBM3P3TS2X</a><br/><p>Skip it.<br /><br />Maybe the DVD will have some cool bonus features, but the film itself is a disappointment.

Beheadings galore, in fact, and plenty of guttings, but eviscerations don't make the movie, and to see one of the great actors of our time ( Anthony Hopkins ) sleepwalking through his part, didn't help. If you're looking for 'the real deal,' stick with AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON, or even THE HOWLING- or the original Chaney version of this tale. That is not to say that this movie was unwatchable. It was far more entertaining than the cutsie version of lycanthropy in THE TOILET ( pun definitely intended ) SAGA, or the syrupy soap opera, BLOOD AND CHOCOLATE. There were some very atmospheric effects, the recreation of period London was sweet, and Hugo Weaving did a great job with his part as a suspicious detective, but I don't feel compelled to go back and watch this thing again seven times in a week, as I did AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON back in 1981.</p></br><a href="../users/A1C58YXM2A30CY.html">A1C58YXM2A30CY</a><br/><p>The mysterious, Gothic feel of The Wolfman was really well-done.  First of all, it was great of Universal Pictures to release this film on a full moon.  Unfortunately the full moon hit Valentines' weekend.  *shrug* What do you do??<br /><br />Unlike the 1941 Lon Chaney, Jr. version, which took place in the then-contemporary pre-WWII Europe, this picture takes place in 1890s England, apparently right outside of London, in the inevitably named "Blackmoor."  Nice.<br /><br />Benicio del Toro seems a bit miscast at first glance.  But viewers find out early in the film that Sir Talbot married a Latin woman, so Benitio's Latin looks makes sense.  Without the "Why me?" look of Lon Chaney, Jr., Benicio had the fear of God in him instead.<br /><br />This fear seemed real and sincere, as he discovers he is cursed.  Cursed from the bite of a werewolf.  He implores the local gypsies to help him but this version of Maleva is not much help.  Her advice is to put Larry Talbot out of his misery.  Silver bullets no extra charge.<br /><br />Quite a surprise as to who the other werewolf is (no spoilers here).  The duo werewolf smack-down will make any WWE fan proud.<br /><br />Larry getting captured and locked up in a mental asylum was quite intense.  The director's view of psychiatry as a barbaric science with its use of ice-baths to cure delusion and sticking him with some kind of drugs has, unfortunately, not changed that much in 21st century psychiatric practice.  We've graduated to electro-shock treatments from ice-baths.  A true horror story.<br /><br />The transformation of the man to wolf is great.  Memories of The American Werewolf in London will come to you, and naturally so, because Rick Baker had something to do with both films.  But where to the wolfman's clothes go?  Does he pick up after himself after each transformation?  But I digress.<br /><br />As in the first Universal picture, there is a mild love interest.  It's a subdued, subplot however.<br /><br />Anthony Hopkins (chewing up enough scenery to gorge on!) is delightfully demented as Sir Talbot, Sr.  The gothic mansion atop the hill with moon shining down in its full glory is so iconic -- and the fake time-lapse movement of our lunar neighbor as it glows through the dead tree branches and storm clouds brings back more memories of Universal pictures past.<br /><br />Example:  The usual villagers with torches marching through the forest (with the baying dogs and such, reminiscent of Frankenstein).  The deep howl of the wolfman as he bays at the moon, as he gorges on the liver and intestines of his latest victim.  Oh, the hopping from the rooftops, again reminiscent of Henry Hall's wolfman, Werewolf of London (which predates Chaney's version).<br /><br />The music evokes a mood and the plot moves along quite swiftly.  At times, the audience is surprised as if the director says "boo" out of a closet or something.  He does this a bit too often, but it's still fun to do.<br /><br />If you are any kind of a Universal fan and have waited for a more adult treatment of this film, then you really should watch this film.  See how many iconic pictures you can spot as Universal digs deep into its vault of horror.<br /><br />So don't be a cynic -- turn off your brain, don't think, and enjoy this bit of entertainment.<br /><br />Warning: much gore and decapitations ensue!<br /><br />I understand Bride of Frankenstein is coming soon.

Of course, Larry has to pull back the sheet, and sees the body looking pretty bad.<br /><br />Back at the family estate, Larry begins having flashbacks about seeing his mother dead from what appeared to be a suicide when he was a young boy.  After her death, Daddy sent him to an asylum for a year and then sent him off to live with a relative in New York.<br /><br />Larry is determined to find the beast that attacked his brother and decides to visit the gypsy camp one night. (Duh--would you go out at night when you knew there was a werewolf in the area and it was a full-moon night to boot?  I hope Larry doesn't tell "blond" jokes :-).  Of course, you don't have to be a rocket-scientist to guess that Larry gets attacked and bitten by the wolfman.  And so it begins--once bitten. . .<br /><br />Larry is sewn up by the gypsy woman and returns home.  A Scotland Yard detective shows up at the manor to investigate and a few unpleasant comments are expressed by both men.  Shortly afterwards, Larry begins to change.  He has some scary nightmares and he begins to develop sight, hearing, and smelling sensitivities.  His body begins to change before our eyes one night and he goes on a killing spree.  The change is done well, too.  Needless to say, the local villagers are severely spooked and the story continues to reveal some additional information.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the movie.  I thought it was well done and added a few new things just to keep the story fresh.  Anthony Hopkins was wonderful in his part, but don't let this worn-out but classy gentleman act fool you.  He is a not a very nice guy.  Benecio De Toro was also wonderful in his role.  The orchestra music added to the film and the visual effects were wonderful.  There were also some nice scenery shots of London and the English countryside.<br /><br />This is NOT a movie for your young and impressionable children.  There is blood, guts and gore for shock value, murders, and asylum torture.  Heads and body parts are ripped off and people are gashed open.  Your children will have nightmares over this stuff.  If you can take that stuff yourself, then this was a really good movie.  (Normally, I won't go to this kind of violent film either, but, I grew up with the Wolfman, Frankenstein, and Dracula stories, so I had to see it.)</p></br><a href="../users/A3TNM3C9ENUCFW.html">A3TNM3C9ENUCFW</a><br/><p>Plagued with delays, reshoots, on set bickering and changed release dates Director Johnston's remake/homage makes it to the silver screen, and is a good old fashion scary movie.<br />Interestingly, the DVD and Blu-Ray release will feature a further 17 minutes of footage, aka "Directors Cut" which according to an interview with the director is mostly in the first half of the movie to build tension, and fill in some back story.<br />It was said that here (the cinematic) release wanted to be concise and get to the first transformation sequence in as soon as possible to keep the audience attention. This ideal I can understand, as all too often one must sit through an hour of build up to get to the meat of the action (no pun intended) and see what has been teased in trailers and TV spots. Time will tell as to whether these 17 minutes make a whole lot of difference, my view is that it will be a nice to have, rather than a need to have. For me the picture felt pretty complete.<br />Del Toro is great from the first scene as the grieving brother summoned by his late siblings fianc&eacute; to the funeral, to try to find out what happened after his mangled remains are found in a ditch near the family's stately home.<br />There's an air of a troubled past about from the get go, as he reunites with his estranged father Anthony Hopkins. We learn in flashback that he witnessed his mothers apparent suicide and was committed to an asylum and suffered untold horrors by his father at a young age, in hopes of cleansing him of something.<br />Hopkins as always is masterful, and more than distracting as the brooding Lord of the manor, with more than a few secrets to hide.<br />Hugo Weaving, as Inspector Abberline also puts in a fine performance, as does Art Malik in a nice cameo role.<br />The similarities to the original Lon Chaney are hinted at more than played out, but it feels, and looks good as he begins to delve into the history of Blackmoor, the nearby gypsy encampment, and the family "curse".<br />They did a great job with filming locations. Chatsworth house (The Blackmoor stately home) is actually in a lot better condition than they made it appear with a dreary run down CGI touch up, and may be familiar to viewers of many movies like Pride & Prejudice. Actually about 160 miles from London, for the purpose of the movie it's setting is supposed nearer to the capital, as Del Toro walks there from London towards the climax of the movie. Castle Combe in Wiltshire is used extensively for the village scenes, and creates a perfect period feel for the late 19th century setting. Those who have actually been to that part of England will know that "yes, it actually looks like that today" an obvious reason why it was chosen.<br /> Emily Blunt is captivating but deliberately understated as the grieving fianc&eacute;, slowly drawn to Del Toro's gentle handling, and the romantic connection is thoughtful without being overplayed.<br />So to the special effects and make up, well those familiar with Rick Bakers talents, particularly in the excellent <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0024FADD8">American Werewolf in London Special Edition</a> (which is seen by many as still the benchmark for the most realistic depiction of the transition from man to wolf) will not be disappointed. Here however, we get more of a direct reference to the original, in that Del Toro is an upright Wolf Man, sort of 50/50 as opposed to being completely lupine or monstrous as in the recent Underworld movies for example.<br />It was also interesting to read that the makeup took only two hours to apply, and one to remove, with Baker remarking that the hirsute Del Toro was easy to change from his current form, to "just a more hairy version of Del Toro with teeth and claws"!<br />You can complain about the constant full moons, the question of where Del Toro's clothes disappear to and reappear when he changes back, and a number of artistic flaws in the story, but the pace and suspense of the movie keep you viewing. This is escapism after all.<br />There are some graphic scenes during the numerous changes and attacks, but the strength of the tension lies more in the good old fashioned scary moments, plenty of searching of dark rooms, and roaming around at night in forests, and more than a few "Boo" moments to make most people alarmed.<br />It's a relatively predictable story, I saw the end coming a mile away, as I'm sure most did, and of course the filmmakers have the left the door open for a sequel. That said, it's an impressive piece of gothic horror well presented with today's technology and sure to do well at the box office, and on DVD. 4 Stars.</p></br><a href="../users/AER15RIMV8E6D.html">AER15RIMV8E6D</a><br/><p>I thought this was a pretty good tribute to the classic 1941 original. Some parts seemed kind of boring and you just wanted Lawrence to turn into the Wolfman. Benicio del Toro was a perfect choice for Lawrence Talbot because he reminds me a lot of Lon Chaney Jr. When his brother Ben, is missing, Lawrence returns to his home town to investigate what happened. While visiting some gypsies, a werewolf comes and wreaks havoc. Lawrence is bit and slowly becomes one also. He tries to hide from Inspector Francis Aberline and seeks help from Gwen, his brother's fianc&eacute;e. I loved when Lawrence turned into the Wolfman, because that's what it's all about. I loved the gory death scenes. If you love the original classic, maybe you'll love THE WOLFMAN!!!</p></br><a href="../users/ARYSE5JQ3AG7L.html">ARYSE5JQ3AG7L</a><br/><p>No new ground was broken here.<br /><br />Casting was great: Hopkins, Del Toro, Blunt & Weaving<br />edgy characters<br /><br />The werewolves were creepy.<br />Digital effects were similar to Van Helsing, but that was a better story.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LSDDSM4PGOU5.html">A1LSDDSM4PGOU5</a><br/><p>i thought this was a pretty good movie.it's bit predictable at times.but it's also fun.Benecio Del Toro really impressed with a flawless American accent.i could have done with someone else playing Hugo weaving's character.though.here,he just reminded me of his Agent Smith character in the Matrix series.by that i mean the same tone of voice,the same cadence and inflection,that sort of thing.maybe that's how Weaving always speaks,but it's just distracting for me.one thing about this movie:it's very graphically violent.the transformation scenes were well done,in my opinion as were the special makeup effects.it may be a remake of the 1941 original,but there some difference,if i recall correctly.anyway,i'm not gonna compare the two movies with each other,although i know i did also like the original.as for The Wolfman (2010),for me,it's a 4/5</p></br><a href="../users/A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ.html">A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ</a><br/><p>If you're going into WOLFMAN expecting a game changer, you're going to be disappointed. WOLFMAN isn't groundbreaking or a remake that rewrites the story or takes the story in a new direction. It just doesn't, and there's nothing wrong with that. What you do get is the creature of the WOLFMAN brought to new light with new technology. Ultimately, the original WOLFMAN with Lon Chaney, was the story of a MAN who became a wolf. The new WOLFMAN with Benicio Del Torro is the same thing, with an added bonus; the ability to show with violent and hairy detail the reality of the man's WOLF side.<br /><br />WOLFMAN is ampted up to fit the technology of the day and the audience of the day. Many may say it is gory, or even too gory, but what I say, is that it accurately shows the violent, physical and aggressive speed and strength of a man who becomes WOLF by the light of a full moon. You truly get the feeling of how horrible it is to be someone who just spent the night darting around killing and eating whatever he could, and not being in control of it.<br /><br />The music, constructed by Danny Elfman, is also something to take note of. It is beautiful and brilliant. It is a merge of old film themed music with the fined tuned chimes of today's music and it works to perfection in reminding you of the movie it is based on, and the movie that it is.<br /><br />WOLFMAN is a perfectly entertaining movie, as long as you don't go in expecting to be awed. To me, the werewolf changing scene in A WEREWOLF IN LONDON, is still awe-inspiring, and you see that same thing here, x100. Yet, people tend to take movie magic for granted these days and WOLFMAN 2010 deserves its due.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VZLLDNLURGJB.html">A1VZLLDNLURGJB</a><br/><p>Universal Studios almost redeemed itself for Van Helsing as The Wolfman was a great, great remake!  Almost everything that I found to be terrible about the Van Helsing movie did not occur in the Wolfman. Wolfman took itself quite seriously, with creature effects that incorporated the original makeup marvelously updated, and great actors like Anthony Hopkins. Almost all of the original film inspired some portion of this film, which is due homage.  The new plot twists from the original were needed since we did not wish to know how this film would work out in the end.<br /><br />The special effects which involved computer animation were not quite as good as the makeup or the prosthetics which were used. Now tell me it was all computer animated. I think computer animation effects are much better suited for Sci-fi than horror and non-organic set type visuals, than live action creature effects. For example, I felt that the animation work on this film was good but not quite as effective as its close in makeup, or say An American Werewolf in London, which was definitely all prosthetics.  If anyone writes a comment that everything was computer animated in this film I will only say I am surprised (in advance). The creature effects in this film, (which I believe to be prosthetics) were absolutely amazing.<br /><br />I loved the depicted "sets" or corresponding computer generated settings, loved the costumes, loved the music, loved all the characters and absolutely loved Hopkins who always adds something magical to any movie.  I did not even know this movie was made until watching it recently on a rental.  I am going to purchase it from Amazon, after deciding if I want it in Blu-Ray or not. Universal, you can resume filming great remakes (like this one), all is forgiven. I was really steamed about Van Helsing.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BFIYZYNK54QX.html">A2BFIYZYNK54QX</a><br/><p>One of the biggest issues that I have with this film is the fact that it's a vanity project for Benicio Del Toro and it barely feels like Del Toro is barely there in the film. He has no opportunity to showcase his vast talents as an actor here, especially as an actor playing an actor (the "Alas, poor Yorick" scene from HAMLET that is showcased in the film is cringe-worthy... is Talbot supposed to be a bad actor?).<br /><br />While listening to the commentary track for SIN CITY, Directors Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller discuss Benicio's desire to play The Wolfman in a remake, and that is the proof in the pudding about where I got "vanity project" from. So that can end that debate.<br /><br />But the plot, at least to begin with, is identical to the Universal classic (it even has the old-school Universal logo at the opening). Lawrence Talbot, who had left his ancestral home in England for success in America as an actor. He comes back to his home after learning of the horrible death of his brother by what could be a maniac or some huge animal. He is greeted by his father, Sir John Talbot (played by Anthony Hopkins, channelling Hannibal Lecter AGAIN...), a famous big-game hunter who greets the "prodigal son" with the warmth of the English winters. He is also confronted by his deceased brother's fiancee, Gwen (played by Emily Blunt, who's performance is relegated to nothing more than a plot necessity), who quickly warms up to Lawrence... a lot more quickly than what one might expect from a grieving fiancee. Lawrence is also a man with a mission: to hunt the beast (or maniac) that killed him. He finds that his brother had some dealings with Gypsies that have put up camp nearby, and they are suspect because of their outsider status. He visits the Gypsy camp and the beast appears, and instead of exacting his vengeance, he is bitten by the beast. And the games then begin. Soon after the attack, an inspector from Scotland Yard comes to investigate: Inspector Mark Abberline (played with the barest vitality by Hugo Weaving), who is, in reality, one of the inspectors of the Jack the Ripper case, and there is a fleeting allusion to that in this film, but it is fleeting.<br /><br />This is pretty much where the similarities end. Aside from a little easter egg moment with Max Von Sydow giving Del Toro a silver-headed cane (that houses a hidden blade), the best of moments of this film come in the various animal attacks filled with gore, evisceration, beheadings and more... and some of the moments of the sparse character development.<br /><br />The biggest problem with this film is the fact that many of the people involved in the making of this film are extremely talented in their own right, but that talent is barely present throughout. As I stated, Del Toro is barely there. He plays some of the tortured elements of his character well, but that's about it. Hopkins plays to his specialty, which is chewing the scenery to nothing. Blunt is pretty much a ghost in this film. Her presence is barely there, and that's not her fault. She's been written into a corner that she has no way out of. Weaving is still channeling some of his Agent Smith persona (and can we have the line "God help us..." put on indefinite moratorium? Please?).<br /><br />Then there are the behind-the-camera people. Director Joe Johnston is someone who can make a really good film (OCTOBER SKY, THE ROCKETEER), but he's still a director that is so incredibly reliant on CG effects, as he learned in films like JUMANJI and JURASSIC PARK III, that he's forgotten the joy that can be seen and felt in practical effects. There are SO MANY composite shots in this film that you honestly feel like every exterior shot is somehow off-kilter, even if it is natural. And the CG feels INCREDIBLY rushed. If it worked better, I might think better of this film.<br /><br />Writers Andrew Kevin Walker and David Self do what they can to give more depth to the film as opposed to the simplicity of the original. In many areas, it doesn't work, sadly. Both of them have written terrific films in their career. Walker rocketed to instant acclaim with his amazing script for David Fincher's masterpiece SE7EN and did some polishing on Fincher's other masterpiece FIGHT CLUB. Self wrote ROAD TO PERDITION and THIRTEEN DAYS, both very underrated films. But here, they don't bring anything that really shines or haunts, which is what a great horror film should do. You should leave still feeling scared but exhilarated.<br /><br />The greatest tragedy of this film though sadly lies on the shoulders of SFX innovator Rick Baker, who is no stranger to werewolf films. He designed, created and reinvented the werewolf transformation in John Landis' AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON, which treats you to the most agonizing and amazing transformation from human to wolf that has ever been committed to film. And the miracle of that was it was all done with PRACTICAL effects. There was no CG. It's still state of the art now, and that was fron 1982. And now with all the innovations in technology over the last 28 years, the design and the CG transformation for the Werewolves in this film are so incredibly fake that nothing is convincing. Not even the movement looks real for a moment. Think about that for a moment. Rick Baker has been given the opportunity and the technology to do something even more convincing than the pinnacle of his technical achievement than something he did 28 YEARS AGO, and it looks like a cheap UNDERWORLD knockoff.<br /><br />So yes, this film is a barely 2-star film because it does hold some interest for the viewer, but once you get to the end, you realize that you've just wasted more time than you would want to.</p></br><a href="../users/A6DOCZ10B7JAJ.html">A6DOCZ10B7JAJ</a><br/><p>Howl in the hell did they screw this one up?  With this latest were-adaption we've got a monstrous budget, an outstanding cast, and a classic wolf script to feed on.  But somehow this Hollywood serving just doesn't come close to appeasing that voracious wolfman appetite.<br /><br />It's not a complete disaster, and I imagine that many mainstream horror fans will be slightly entertained.  There are some drab 19th century London sets that capture a nice depressing feel.  The costumes also capture that era quite well.  Plus there are some decent gory action scenes that deliver some solid thrills.  Some noticeable CGI, but overall the effects were somewhat gripping and realistic.<br /><br />Now for the bad.  This script was functional, at best.  The action is kinda slow-paced, with the dialogue sorta bland.  There's nothing too emotionally-charged or noteworthy happening whatsoever.  The acting performances in turn seemed very uninspired.  But really what pretty much ruined this movie for me were several plot developments that seemed eclipsed of all possible logic.  I won't include spoilers here, but some reactions to the disastrous werewolf problem seemed flat-out ridiculous.  There is a pointless romance that is clumsily included that's just atrocious.  And finally there is a horrible plot twist which is arbitrarily inserted that makes absolutely no sense.<br /><br />Not a complete waste.  But I'd recommend saving your money, or at least wait for a rental.  Pick up the almighty DOG SOLDIERS instead.</p></br><a href="../users/A3IKBHODOTYYHM.html">A3IKBHODOTYYHM</a><br/><p>It had to be this way. Sorry.<br /><br />Dialogue spoken in the film, but words which might offer explanation of the newest monster installment, The Wolfman. Killing (if you pardon the pun) many of the classics with remakes has become all too common recently, unfortunately. However, films are big business, and essentially money driven to a degree, and masses eat up the blockbuster type of film, even if it strips down the story, diminishes the characters, or leaves you with no real connection to anything in the viewing experience other than "being entertained." I don't want to get "all nostalgic" on you, because there have been clever masterpieces that past films couldn't duplicate. We just often look to the originals as masterpieces not because they were flawless, but because they have spirit, mood and emotional connection, something that one might have witnessed seeing Chaney in the original version of The Wolfman. In this version, the main problems were the overuse of unnecessary gore (just for the sake of it), the lack of cleverness, and the formulaic characterization. The Wolfman is a film that just shoves too much in your face-- and you see it coming a mile away-- which kills the fun of the intensity or creepiness in seeing a monster or villain film.<br /><br />And yet, it's not all bad, really. What the remake is able to do is inject plenty of werewolf lore and legend in it, which does add to the atmosphere, although I wished the gypsies had more of a prominent role. Had they focused more on making us care about Lawrence Talbot rather than adding a hokey subplot of father and son (reminiscent of Teen Wolf) and superficial love story (why exactly do these two love each other?), I might have cared more about the film and been more involved. Instead, the viewing experience wasn't horrible, but just one that is easily forgotten, kind of like a fast food meal. Intermixed with appropriate Victorian background and dreary mood, we have lackluster main characters who trigger zero empathy. Consider Lon Chaney's Lawrence Talbot in The Wolfman's original: he had a genuine disturbing link to the horrible things that were happening to him, and his humanness necessitates pity on our parts. After all, we felt bad for him, and rooted for him even though we knew what had to happen. Here, Del Toro just seems to be sleepwalking. Sure, he does crank up the intensity somewhat towards the later stages of the film, when the action is high, but there's no build up to this point. Additionally. Talbot's father was a bit of an odd one. Maybe I'm the only one who thought that Anthony Hopkins' character turns into Hannibal Lector about the half way point of the film, with his calm, quiet instability bordering on homicidal maniac.<br /><br />While this film strives hard to give us the atmosphere and background to the idea of the werewolf, it ultimately resorts to mainstreaming itself so we can get up, grab a soda and popcorn, and forget about the film soon after.</p></br><a href="../users/A387BD735MI50R.html">A387BD735MI50R</a><br/><p>This film is too heavy with atmospherics and with CGI special effects. The smoky oak atmosphere of the English village and the surrounding woods is interesting for a while. But then the unrelieved lowering of sky and woods and old mansion begins to get tedious.<br /><br />The actors also have too limited a range to play across here. I'd looked forward to seeing Benicio del Toro and Anthony Hopkins star together. Both men have great faces and generally a great on-screen presence. But their usual charisma gets smothered in the dour monochrome settings of "Wolfman." It's as if one of the dusty brocade tapestries on the walls of the Talbot mansion had fallen on them, pressing them into the misty purple scenes.<br /><br />I had thought that modern F/X techniques might have made man's transformation into wolf even more thrilling than it was in the Lon Chaney Jr. original of this movie. But it isn't so. If anything, the modern simulations make the transformation look almost ludicrous in comparison to the more nuanced elision from man to beast that the Chaney version accomplished. The wolf versions of the man look more like artifacts than ever.<br /><br />There are a few moments of genuine emotion here as the Benicio del Toro and Emily Blunt characters discover their love for each other. But this humanity gets covered by the matted fur coat of Larry Talbot's alter ego. On the whole, I'd advise that you spit up this hairball.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>Directed by Joe Johnston ("Jurassic Park III", "Honey, I Shrunk The Kids") and written by Andrew Kevin Walker ("Se7en", "Sleepy Hollow") and David Self ("The Road to Perdition"), there is a lot to like about "The Wolfman", the new big budget version of the classic Universal horror film. Unfortunately, there is just as much confusing narrative to cause confusion and dislike about it as well. Ultimately, it is a forgettable film, which is a shame because as you watch it, you keep hoping it will ultimately swing the other way.<br /><br />London, 1891. Lawrence Talbot (Benicio Del Toro), an actor touring in England, returns to his ancestral home, Blackmoor, at the request of his dead brother's fianc&eacute;e, Gwen (Emily Blunt, "Sunshine Cleaning", "The Devil Wears Prada"). His brother was recently killed in a strange, savage animal attack and she needs his assistance trying to comfort his father, Sir John (Anthony Hopkins). Larry arrives at his ancestral estate and finds it in a sad condition; nothing appears to have been cleaned in ages and there is a deep sense of dread about the house and the small town nearby. Larry visits his dead brother's body and realizes the attack was not made by a normal animal and people in the town start to blame the attack on a Wolf Man. The blame also starts to fall on a group of traveling gypsies led by Maleva (Geraldine Chaplin). Soon, Larry is attacked by the wolf and races against the impending full moon to find out who the wolf man is. And when he realizes Gwen might be in danger, his mission accelerates. Then, Inspector Abberline (Hugo Weaving, "The Matrix", "Priscilla Queen of the Desert"), a Scotland Yard Inspector, arrives to lead the investigation.<br /><br />Johnston is not a very prolific director. He's had some hits and some misses. His debut "Honey, I Shrunk The Kids" showed promise but with the exception of "The Rocketeer" and "Jumanji" his films have been very uneven and most would be best described as "Cable-Ready" fare. "Jurassic Park III" should have been released direct to video. Both screenwriters, Andrew Kevin Walker and David Self have penned highly original, interesting screenplays and you would probably expect something interesting and unusual from them. Most of the problems with "The Wolfman" arise in the narrative. And for that, the screenwriters and director receive most of the blame.<br /><br />What I did like about the film is it is just dripping with atmosphere. Dirt and leaves line the entry hall of Blackmoor. The exterior is lined with black moss giving the building a decaying look. This theme is carried throughout; the night scenes are filled with black, white and silver, which I am sure is no surprise, but the method in which this is done lends the film a unique look, making it appear almost monochromatic, almost as though it is a black and white film.<br /><br />The narrative has a quick pulse to it, giving the film a faster pace than you might expect. In many films like this, a lot of time is spent establishing the mythology of the characters and the setting. Often the film runs two hours plus as a result. In "The Wolfman", as a scene ends, the action seems to shift and fast forward to the next set-up. This keeps the pace brisk and also mimics the actions of the actors when they are turning into the wolves. It's a nice touch and helps give the film a slightly stylized look.<br /><br />I also appreciate the fact the filmmakers decided to make the film a period piece. I'm not exactly sure why this was done, but it does lend an air of interest to the film. Does it make it more believable? Maybe. It seems the more old-fashioned a setting, the more believable it is to see a man turn into a wolf. Somehow, if the film were set in present day, the threat wouldn't be as real. Surely there is some modern weapon that could be used to trap and or kill a wolf man more easily. The original film was released in 1941 and this new version jumps back sixty years before that. Giving the film a period setting, even if it isn't the same period, somehow, strangely, seems like a tribute to the original. Perhaps this is meant to be a prequel, Del Toro's character is Larry Talbot, the same name of Lon Chaney Jr.'s wolf man. Maybe Del Toro is meant to be the ancestor of the character later played by Chaney. It's a nice thought, but I'm not sure how much of this was deliberate.<br /><br />This new version is an R-rated film, which is a nice change of pace in the current marketplace. So many studio films are created with the caveat they must receive a PG or PG-13 rating, to ensure the millions of teen-aged boys who buy multiple tickets can get into the theater. An R-rating allows this film to paint a bloodier picture, a more 'realistic' picture of the carnage of what a wolf man can and would create. How stupid would it be to have a film like this rated PG-13? Every time the wolf attacks, the camera would have to cut away to the reaction of someone standing nearby, or a shadow on a wall showing us the action. This is probably what would have been done in the 40s and this technique could be applied with some great success in this project. But to make it work, the filmmaker has to apply some great skill and finesse. In "The Wolfman", there more blood and gore, less skill and finesse. It seems like an acceptable balance.<br /><br />There is a significant amount of exposition dedicated to making us believe Benicio Del Toro is the heir to an English estate, in 1881. His father (Anthony Hopkins) makes a comment about Larry's time spent with his aunt in the United States. There is a reference to his mother, who may have been Spanish. But it just doesn't work. Del Toro is a great actor and he always brings a lot of intensity to the roles he plays. But you don't ever believe he is the son of Anthony Hopkins. You have to quickly get past this little bit of information and move on, because the film has more story to get through and it won't wait for you.<br /><br />As we hear Gwen narrate the beginning of the film, we see a brief shot of Lawrence on stage as Hamlet and the camera pushes forward abruptly and we see another shot of Lawrence as Macbeth, then the camera pushes forward and we watch as Lawrence's brother is murdered by a large beast. This beginning scene is very good at setting up the tone for the entire film. Even though this is a period piece, the camera never lingers too long and the action continues to move forward. Late in the film, as we watch Lawrence transform into the beast, his face gets a little hairy and then his body jerks forward and we see that his face has transformed again. Each time his body convulses, or jerks forward, another bit of the transformation takes place. Both of these methods seemed similar and help to advance the narrative in a quick, almost modern way. It might seem like this would be a little jarring, given the film is set in 1881 England, you might expect a film more reminiscent of Merchant Ivory, but it is a refreshing way to tell the story.<br /><br />Del Toro is always a pretty intense actor and this serves him well in his performance of Lawrence Talbot. As he becomes embroiled in the mystery and learns more about the situation, you get the sense there is a growing anger lying beneath his surface, an anger that he is barely able to contain. When this anger reaches its apex, it unleashes the beast within him.<br /><br />Anthony Hopkins is one of the greatest actors of our time. But he is also an actor who frequently just walks through the parts he is playing, like he can't muster the enthusiasm to make the role something memorable. So he simply plays Anthony Hopkins. Granted, Anthony Hopkins playing himself is a lot better than most would do with the role, but we have seen this man in some truly great, truly memorable performances. Because of this, it is disappointing to watch him simply play himself. If he isn't able to muster the enthusiasm for the role, why take it?<br /><br />Emily Blunt is good as Gwen, the woman who first must mourn the loss of her fianc&eacute;e and then realizes she is attracted to the man's brother. She brings intelligence and strength to the role that helps to set it apart from the typical damsel in distress.<br /><br />Hugo Weaving plays Inspector Abbeline, the Scotland Yard inspector sent to the Moors to help with this strange case. There is a brief reference to Abbeline's previous duty hunting Jack the Ripper, a nice touch helping to make his character seem more vital. When he arrives, he finds the townspeople in arms trying to impart their own brand of justice. Abbeline quickly puts a stop to it and begins his official investigation. But events quickly take over and he finds himself unable to stay ahead of the investigation and must fight to keep from drowning.<br /><br />When you are dealing with a fantasy film, a horror film, a film depicting anything out of the ordinary, it is vital to get one aspect of the production absolutely and completely right. The story has to be airtight. If it is, if the filmmakers follow their own established rules for the universe they are creating, if all of the characters fit together correctly, if everything makes sense in these parameters, we can enjoy the ride and the film. If there are problems with the story, we become distracted and start to look for other problems. Is the make-up believable, is that special effect working, did they recreate that scene correctly? We begin to pick it apart. There are problems with "The Wolfman" and these distract us from the rest of the film.<br /><br />Ultimately, I didn't leave the theater fearful of the next full moon and that is a problem.</p></br><a href="../users/A15YPJLKLZS0MK.html">A15YPJLKLZS0MK</a><br/><p>This is a hip update of the classic Universal film  The Wolf Man. It was one of the only Universal horrors I hadn't seen. I saw only bits and pieces of it. This updated version is actually made by Universal studios. It was not scary, but worth seeing once. It said made by Joe Johnson in the end credits.</p></br><a href="../users/AF8C86SGYLH81.html">AF8C86SGYLH81</a><br/><p>Horror buffs, you don't want to miss this excellent adaptation of the 1941 Universal Studios classic.  Stellar performances by Benicio Del Toro (Lawrence Talbot), Anthony Hopkins (his father) and Emily Blunt (his love interest), make this a millennium classic from the get-go.  Be sure to see it on the big screen.  I spilled my popcorn three times (thank goodness I bought the large refillable box).  And many kudos to the movie sets and costumes of 1891 England.  But, please don't bring the kids.  It's rated "R" for all the right reasons (horror fans that is).  There's lots of flesh-ripping gore and up-front out-of-the dark terror.  The tragic storyline will remind of you of another horror classic - "King Kong".  If you recall (without giving away the plot), the last line in the original Kong was:  "It wasn't the planes that got him, it was beauty that killed the beast."  All 5 stars.  We need more true horror films like this.</p></br><a href="../users/AV5G37VFE5NVD.html">AV5G37VFE5NVD</a><br/><p>Bad dog.  If there's anything to be said in defense of "The Wolfman," it's that it's another movie with potential f****d over by the studio.  That's all the defense the film deserves.  It doesn't take a full moon to illuminate where the production went wrong.  Joe Johnston is a nice guy and a good director who shoots movies that look pretty--he knows how to use shadow, that's for sure--and fills them with characters no deeper than celluloid itself.  He's also studio-friendly: his films are well-received critically and profitable financially, which is why he won out as director in the end.  In hiring Johnston, Universal got a director they could feel safe with.  They also sabotaged the potential for a film with vision and, well, worth.<br /><br />The worthiest aspects of Johnston's "Wolfman," as it is, are two men: Hugo Weaving, who manages to give a Scotland Yard inspector as thin as the paper the script was printed on a fa?ade of life, and Rick Baker, who designed the makeup effects.  Anyone familiar with the Werewolf film will know Baker, whose epochal effects for John Landis' "An American Werewolf in London" won the first Best Makeup Effects Oscar in 1982.  His effects for "The Wolfman" were stunted by the studio like a plant without fertilizer or water.  Baker's work in "American Werewolf" is proof of the vast superiority of physical makeup effects to the modern-day computer-generated imagery, the latter being the method Universal forced him to use.  Nonsense.  The resulting effects generate more thrills than the other aspects of the film, but look hopelessly crude compared to the effects Baker designed--and executed, physically--almost thirty years ago.  All one can say about Weaving is that the liveliness he's able to wring from his talking clich&eacute; is nobility like the screen has rarely seen.<br /><br />Which directs attention to the script, that which attracted me to the project when it went in to development half a decade ago, since it's written by "Seven"'s Andrew Kevin Walker.  The script was touched up prior to filming by David Self, unfortunately, whom I think must to be blame for many of its shortcomings.  As translated to the screen, the script has flashes of almost exciting vision, flashes rapidly less frequent as the film progresses.  Most of the time, the plot takes leaps forward, trips on a sidestep, goes nowhere, and then leaves a hole so wide the monster from a far better monster movie, "Cloverfield," could crouch inside it.  The plot seems unsatisfactory in the middle of the film and obnoxious at its end.  Some scenes make no sense and suggest Self patchwork that would do David "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull" Koepp proud.  Cliches are a pack of wolves roaming across the screenplay.  The cliches aren't as offensive as the scenes all-too-obviously stolen from Landis' "American Werewolf in London," and they certainly aren't so embarrassing as the painfully stupid werewolf fight I'd prayed the film was smart enough to avoid.  Could be the stupid/stolen action-injected scenes became a necessity once Danny Elfman delivered his score, supposedly a homage to Wojciech Kilar's score for Francis Ford Coppola's "Dracula," proof that Elfman has revealed himself as a long-since-spent theme-meister whose scores stink.<br /><br />As does this film, whether you see it as a rehash, a standalone picture, or, ugh, worst of all, the incumbent counterpart to Coppola's "Dracula"--now there was a remake.  Coppola's "Dracula" pulsed with sex, bizarrity, and, since those are two of its central components, life.  "The Wolfman" is nowhere near as bizarre as I'd like it--the weirdest it gets is some gore, which livens things up just enough to make me grateful the studio went with the R-rated version, and a trippy dream sequence that creeped me out enough for me to consider it successful--and it's about as sexy as a mossy old soda can in the middle of a marsh.  Which, with the soda can as completely unrounded character and the marsh providing opportunities for shadows and pretty visuals, might make fitting subject matter for Joe Johnston's next project.  Just leave "Frankenstein" alone.</p></br><a href="../users/A3TYC8T6W81DDB.html">A3TYC8T6W81DDB</a><br/><p>Out of all the classic Universal monster films, The Wolfman was my least favorite. Frankenstein, Dracula, and even The Invisible Man all seemed to be in a league of their own while The Wolfman didn't seem to fit in the same demographic that those films did. Once this film went into production, the cast was announced, and pictures leaked from the set, I was extremely excited. This remake had everything going for it to be everything the original film was and then some. So that's the mindset I had going into the film and luckily it didn't disappoint. The homages to the original film are definitely there, especially during Lawrence's first transformation sequence and attack on the men hunting him. Not only that, but the film is practically overflowing with blood and gore. With films relating to vampires or werewolves, they need to be scary and intimidating. We need to know what these monsters are capable of. The carnage and bloodshed is glorious in this film. In fact, as a horror fan, it gave me chills. The film's setting in 1891 or thereabouts helped establish the mood and look of the film and was certainly used to its advantage since it's hard to imagine the film having as much of an impact in a different setting. But above all else, this movie should be seen in the theater for the sound. Hearing this type of film in surround sound is one of the reasons I keep going back to theater. There was a scene with water dripping that sounded like it was dripping right behind me and hearing that howl shake the floor and vibrate your seat is a joy. If you plan on seeing this movie, see it in a theater you know has spectacular sound. It is well worth it.<br /><br />There isn't much regarding flaws for the film. As a massive horror fan, this film really delivered in all aspects. During the trailers, it seemed like everyone involved was just reading off of cue cards or something. While watching the film, the performances seem to build. The two actors that stood out the most were the two main ones; Benicio Del Toro and Anthony Hopkins. Watching the film in context, the way they talk is uncomfortable since they haven't seen each other for so long and their reactions and interactions get more intense as the film advances. Del Toro's performance shines during his return visit to the asylum he was at as a child and Anthony Hopkins is truly magnificent in the second half. I found it odd that Hopkins was saying everything twice in the trailers for the film ("Terrible things, Lawrence. You've done terrible things," "Be strong, son. Be strong," etc). and he does do that quite a bit throughout the film, but his character gets a lot more interesting later on. It didn't bother me in the long run. Regarding the look of The Wolfman, nothing really presents itself that there were any changes regarding its design. He looks incredible and the mix of practical make-up effects and CGI result in one of the better werewolf designs in recent years. There are a few scenes during the transformation sequences that are noticeably CGI, but they're few and far between and are pulled off in excellent fashion for the most part.<br /><br />The Wolfman is easily the most satisfying horror film I've had the pleasure of seeing in quite some time. It is a must-see for horror fans as it's one of the few remakes that is better than the original film. The transformation scenes are spectacular, the carnage that's left is devastating and pure bliss to watch for fans of bloody violence, and the film's sound is truly what makes it worth seeing in theaters since it's done so well. The Wolfman comes highly recommended and is one of the best films to come out in the first few months of 2010.</p></br><a href="../users/A319Y83RT0MRVR.html">A319Y83RT0MRVR</a><br/><p>The movie required a prompt exit out of the movie theater. It wasn't a terrible film, but one felt that there were just better things to do than sit there and watch this movie unfold. The CGI transformations from human into a werewolf were done really well though. Benedito Del Toro was barely passable in the leading role and caused the overall lack of interest in this viewer.</p></br><a href="../users/AQZH7YTWQPOBE.html">AQZH7YTWQPOBE</a><br/><p>I can't say I was expecting much from this movie, but Wolfman disappointed. It comes across as a B-monster movie rather than something more. The focus is definitely on a monster killing people. The movie goes to pains to find odd and grotesque situations in which to disembowel a lot of people. However, this gets pretty boring. The scenes are uniformly dark and the acting dull. Simon Merrells is catatonic and Anthony Hopkins comes across as a joke. The only ray of light is Emily Blunt, who manages to look even sexier in 19th century wardrobe.</p></br><a href="../users/A18GP1PWVTKXQQ.html">A18GP1PWVTKXQQ</a><br/><p>*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />  'The Wolfman' is a remake of the 1941 horror 'classic' of the same name, starring Lon Chaney Jr. By changing the setting to Victorian England, the remake is light years ahead of the original in the set design department. I happened to love all the costumes, the locales where the film was shot as well as the Danny Elfman score which manages to add a lot more weight to the film, which suffers from the original paltry concept and some noxious re-imaginings found in this new revision.<br /><br />  I simply fail to understand why people are drawn to the whole Wolfman concept in the first place. It has little basis in reality unless you're drawn to those stories of humans raised by apes in the jungle who are unable to throw off their primitive inclinations due to their unusual upbringing. Of course in those rare cases, the human being doesn't find himself transformed into a beast and then reverting to human form, whenever daylight finally breaks.<br /><br />  As a myth, the Wolfman seems awfully simplistic. What does one learn after undergoing the 'Wolfman' experience in the movies? That men are capable of horrible violence when the thin veneer of civilization is swept away? So what!<br /><br />  In a sense, the Wolfman character is a paganistic, pre-Christian representative of the Devil. Where the Devil is a beast in human form, the Wolfman is a human in a fake, beast-like form. Those viewers with unconscious aggressive wishes are vicariously drawn in part to the fake beast, who with his superhuman strength, rips peoples' heads off with a flick of his paw-like hand. Not only do they take delight in a character that can best be found conjured up in a five-year-old's nightmare, but also cheer just as loudly, when the fake creature meets its end at the hands of a superstitious, vengeful mob. The mob finally figures out a way to snuff out the life of this maniacal figure, who somehow emanates from a dream-like world. It's much more difficult coming to terms with devils such as the Nazis, whose evil had a human face and were not so easily defeated as the Wolfman is here.<br /><br />  'The Wolfman' (the remake) changes the plot of the original 1941 film by introducing the idea that the Wolfman's father, Sir John Talbot, is actually a Wolfman himself and is responsible for the death of his son, Ben Talbot. Lawrence Talbot, now an American actor (having left England after the death of mother), initially returns to the family estate to investigate the disappearance of his brother, but soon learns that the brother has been murdered. Later, it's revealed that Sir John's faithful servant, Singh, has been keeping him locked up for years in the castle whenever the full moon appears, preventing the father from escaping and fomenting havoc throughout the countryside.<br /><br />  The problem is that Sir John is an utterly, unlikable character who's depicted as not having one modicum of charm. He's such a churl that he doesn't hesitate in informing Lawrence that he's responsible for murdering his mother, his brother and also turning Lawrence into a werewolf as well. Instead of sticking up for the son (who's being hunted by a determined Scotland Yard Inspector as well as assorted meanies from the town), Sir John would rather (pardon the pun), throw his son to the wolves!<br /><br />  Lawrence as the Wolfman has a similar problem. Unlike the Frankenstein monster or a modern version such as Terminator II, he's not what you would call, a 'conflicted' creature. The good side never comes out until maybe the end, when he realizes that it's Gwen (the woman who falls for both Ben and Lawrence), who he's about to rip apart, turning her into the expected umpteenth bloody mess. While Lawrence terrorizes both urban and rural parts of England, he's simply a killing machine, ripping all kinds of body parts from living human beings. All this becomes tiresome since we're praying that perhaps his human side might emerge and the Inspector will now have reasons in hesitating to do the creature in.<br /><br />  Was anyone else bothered by the fact that the The Wolfman's demise is a foregone conclusion? I found it deflating that Maleva, the gypsy woman, informs Gwen that there's no cure for the Wolfman's curse. The best we can look forward to is that the Wolfman dies in the presence of someone who loves him. Once all that is brought out, the climax is utterly predictable and one realizes that 'The Wolfman' is a film with virtually no surprises.<br /><br />  'The Wolfman' could have been a much more interesting film if it had some stakes (pardon the pun again), that you could bite your teeth into! How about a satire or critique on the Victorian age--the era in which the film is set in? In the end, 'The Wolfman' is all atmosphere. One must be content with admiring the attention to detail--yes, dig those illustrations on the front page of the newspaper that chronicles "the monster's" deeds, that the Inspector thrusts in Gwen's face when he visits her antique store! Very cool! As for the Wolfman story--unfortunately, that's something that's not very hard to forget, in a virtual instant.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>[THIS REVIEW REFERS TO THE THEATRICAL VERSION OF THE FILM]<br /><br />After the brutal murder of his brother, Lawrence Talbot (Benicio Del Toro) comes back to his family's Blackmoor estate, where his estranged father Sir John Talbot (Anthony Hopkins) lives. The terrified villagers suspect that gypsies (or the bear they keep) are responsible for the deed, but on the full moon night the locals are to know the real culprit is out there in the woods - some mysterious creature that starts attacking people, killing them with its superhuman power.<br /><br />As you know, this is a remake of the 1941 Universal horror classic "Wolfman" starring Lon Chaney, Jr. and Claude Rains, but the plot is considerably changed, presumably to allow for more special effects. I don't mind these changes as long as the film delivers the goods, but I am afraid that is not exactly the case here.<br /><br />For all Rick Baker's special make-ups and effective production designs, the film remains largely thrill-free, due to the predictable script (originally penned by Andrew Kevin Walker, rewritten by David Self) and pretty ineffective storytelling that fails to build tension during the action scenes. One exception is the impressive observation room sequence in which a character strapped in a chair morphs into a werewolf, but the rest of the film is just OK. The romance is there, but Emily Blunt's heroine remains uninteresting, wasting any opportunity for her to show what she can do. Hugo Weaving, like he always does, steals every scene he is in, but his character itself is sadly underwritten.<br /><br />This is the first work from director Joe Johnston since "Hidalgo" in 2004, whose "October Sky" is one of my favorite films. Though not totally a terrible film, "The Wolfman" has turned out a little disappointing, lacking a good story to tell.</p></br><a href="../users/AJRFZ0VZ0LD26.html">AJRFZ0VZ0LD26</a><br/><p>In this film that casts mainly British actors, it is still puzzling to me how Benicio DelToro gets to play a lead role.  "Wolfman" starts with a horrifying scene of a beast killing a young man in a forest.  As it turns out that young man is Benicio's character's brother.  It is the grieving fiancee (Emily Blunt) that gets in a picture when she asks for help in finding her fiancee's killer.<br /><br />Film does not have particularly strong special effects.  Anthony Hopkins look more bored that scary as a wolfman.  He is ruthless in a sense that is his willing to sacrifice his entire family for his need to kill.<br /><br />It is a so-so movie, fine entertaiment but nothing too deep.</p></br><a href="../users/A3MV1KKHX51FYT.html">A3MV1KKHX51FYT</a><br/><p>The Wolfman, 2000 film<br /><br />The story begins with a full moon in 1891 Blackmoor England. A man wanders at night, alone and unarmed. He is attacked by a wild creature. Gwen Conliffe is engaged to Ben, she asks his brother the actor about the missing Ben. Larry Talbot knows nothing. On the train a stranger offers him a silver-headed cane with a canine head. A two-horse coach carries Larry to the estate. [No servants?] A large dog barks at him. Sir John Talbot tells him the news about finding Ben's body. Did a wild beast do that? Were the foreign Gypsies responsible? Could it be a werewolf? Words in the inn lead to turmoil. Are the villagers ignorant and superstitious? [Why do they suspect the aristocracy?] Do actors pretend to be somebody they are not? A strange medallion was found on Ben's body.<br /><br />Larry remembers his mother's death. [Symbolism?] Larry was sent out of the country (to explain his American accent). There is another full moon. Larry goes to the Gypsy camp to inquire about that medallion. "Mazel Tov?" Mounted riders with arms enter the camp. Something attacks the men? Gunshots are useless. Larry runs after the canine: it attacks him! There is no cure for one bitten by the beast. Larry recovers at home, remarkably well. A warrior must be armed against evil, even with silver bullets. A policeman investigates the crime, Larry alone survived. There are no natural predators left in England. Could it be a lunatic? A group of men try to capture Larry on suspicion. Is a stranger dangerous?<br /><br />Larry orders Gwen to leave by nightfall. Is she in danger? The villagers cast silver bullets. The police detective waits in the village inn. Is Talbot Hall cursed (like the Baskervilles)? Why does Sir John visit the crypt at night? What does his talk tell? Larry undergoes a change in personality. The villagers hear a howl. Can they trap this beast? Who is caught? The werewolf attacks the crowd of men, impervious to gun shots. Can it be captured? Can ice water cure insanity? Or electric shock? Will Larry hallucinate? Sir John tells about his adventure in India, and its after effects. [Were you surprised?]<br /><br />Larry is brought before a group of doctors for an examination about his delusions. [Note the amazing special effects from computer generated images.] Was this meant as a comedy? And so Larry is free to run over the rooftops like a wild animal. Pistol shots have no effect! [Too bad for anyone where the bullets land.] Gwen finds Larry, he tells the family secrets (a hereditary disease). The police detective questions Gwen about Larry. Gwen read up on "Lycanthropy". Will she "set him free"? The police will shoot Larry on sight. Larry goes hunting too. Will there be a surprise? Can a werewolf defeat another werewolf? [More amazing special effects. Does this remind you of professional wrestling?] Will fire kill a werewolf? Or a silver bullet? The spell is broken, Larry is set free to go to a far, far better place. But what about that police detective who was bitten? ["Abbott and Costello Meet Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde".]<br /><br />This is inferior to the 1941 original movie, which had more integrity. This version runs on too long with its extraneous scenes. Its great special effects got in the way of the story. I read that Curt Siodmak, the original writer, concocted those legends of werewolves (silver bullet, etc) which became part of popular beliefs. Check the references to "silver bullet" in popular culture. The original story was a parable about the economic cycle that regularly brought hard times.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y.html">A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y</a><br/><p>I managed to see this movie thanks to a gift of tickets and I am thankful I did not pay,because If I did I would have given it 1 star!Wolf Man 2010 is typical Hollywood Remake.

This film was able to do just that, yet keep it's own identity. The changes in storyline were subtle and VERY nicely done. The wolfman itself was very similar in style to the Lon Chaney Jr. makeup job...and although the original is considered corney by the standards of today, this new wolfman image is, again, very much like the original, but changed enough to make him ferocious and more to our modern tastes.<br /><br />I can't say that I would have chosen Del Toro as Lawrence if I had the chance to cast, however, after a rocky start he really pulled it off.  Anthony Hopkins was once again, BRILLIANT.  I was almost seeing a little Hannibal L. in his portrayal of Lawrence's father, and it was intruiging, since Claude Raines was such a benign Mr. Talbot.  Anthony loved playing this part...it seems to suit his personality.<br /><br />Visually, this movie was stunning. The scenes of Old London...the moors...just beautifully rendered.  The scenery was a bit unsettling out near the Talbot house and that is exactly what made it all work.  The house didn't have to be decaying, however, it suited the mood and went well alongside the obvious destruction of their family from the inside out.<br /><br />Another great classic monster movie from Universal. I hope any further remakes of their classic monster line of films will be as respectful as this one to the film that came before.</p></br><a href="../users/AOXL514GEE4AA.html">AOXL514GEE4AA</a><br/><p>Wolfman is a remake of the Universal Classic. It tells the tale of Lawrence Talbot(Del Toro), who is lured back to his family estate by his brother's fiance Gwen (Blunt) after he goes missing. Reunited with his estranged father and haunted by his past, Talbot sets out to find his brother. After he is attacked, he soon discovers that something with brute strength and a lust for blood has been killing the villagers, and that a suspicious Scotland Yard inspector named Aberline (Weaving) has come to investigate. The curse of the wolfman begins and as he falls deeper into madness, he makes a startling revelation! Can he destroy the evil behind it all, before it destroys him?<br /><br />This movie is getting high praise and serious criticism on here. It deserves neither. The critics are ridiculous and I wonder what they expected? The cast is excellent and the script (all things considered) original and refreshing. What fun would it be to see the original film remade frame by frame? Talbot is a more complete character with a haunted back story. The relationship with his father is the main storyline in the film, which gives it substance. I have not seen the theatrical but the problem with the Director's Cut is that it gores it up too much. Otherwise, this is an excellent remake and enjoyable movie.<br /><br />BLU RAY THOUGHTS: Universal morphs out a monstrous disc! Absolutely stunning! The robust picture fills the screen with excellent colors and marvelous darks! Great sound too. The special features are interesting and insightful (especially the 2 alt endings and making of). FINAL THOUGHTS: A MUST OWN!</p></br><a href="../users/A3O536E2YOKK4Y.html">A3O536E2YOKK4Y</a><br/><p>This 2010 version of "The Wolfman" reminds me a lot of 1992's "Bram Stoker's Dracula." Both feature a classic monster, both take place in Great Britain during the Victorian era, both are stylistically similar, and both feature Anthony Hopkins in a major role.<br /><br />Each is visually striking but, story-wise, "Dracula" wins the prize, which isn't to say that "The Wolfman" isn't worth watching. Hopkins, Benicio Del Toro (in the title role) and Emily Blunt are all fine in their roles, it's just that somehow the story and characters aren't all that engrossing. Maybe it's because Hopkins plays a distant eccentric patriarch and Del Toro plays his brooding loner son who hides behind Shakespearean characters. It's hard to relate to them or like them. Emily Blunt is likable enough, but she's never sufficiently fleshed out and her deep love for a certain character seems a bit unlikely and forced.<br /><br />But, again, the film looks incredible and is worth viewing or owning for this reason alone. You get foggy moors, mysterious woods, gloomy estates, gypsy camps, dungeons and old London streets, all with werewolf attacks. Speaking of which, there's quite a bit of action and extreme gore interspersed throughout to keep things interesting. The music's good too.<br /><br />The DVD features both the theatrical and unrated Director's cut, the latter of which is close to 20 minutes longer, which is the version I viewed.<br /><br />GRADE: C+ or B- (although, visually, it's A+ all the way)</p></br><a href="../users/A96JD9312DHWC.html">A96JD9312DHWC</a><br/><p>An obscure attack by some sort of beast leads a long-lost son back to visit his father. Along the way he hears folklore of something other than an animal wandering these parts, and is left confronting something that is both sinister AND closer than he ever wanted to think.<br /><br />When I heard that the Wolfman was coming out, I was happy about the release but I was hesitant about the movie. Typically, werewolf movies have several flaws in them and, more often than not, modern movies do not give the werewolf the things it deserves. This movie does that and more, however, by getting great actors to stand alongside a great place and get special effects - leading the watcher on a journey that is both twisting and terrible in a delightful manner.<br /><br />One could tell from the start that this was going to have a lot of gore in it, but the way the gore was placed in the movie was tactful and was also something that one was left to wonder about. At times it simply appeared and you were left watching and wondering, and other times left you wondering if the wolf would appear of if it would simply disaapoint - which it did not. Combine that with a storyline that threads it s was around our main characters and you have yourself a tragedy that had been accursed for a long time and would have remained that way had it not  been for an act that starts as the movie does.<br /><br />Many other things can be said about this movie but, with a fear for giving something away, I simply have to say that I enjoyed it and that I think other horror fans will as well. If you like your movies with the suspense that is required, the acting that is a must, and the location that always plays a part in making a monster work, then you will love this.<br />I personally found myself wanting a lot and thinking it delivered on all fronts, making this consumer happy. It is rare to find that type of thing in modern horror, and even less in something centering around a foundation-monster like the wolf.<br />Great - approved of on so many fronts.</p></br><a href="../users/A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ.html">A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ</a><br/><p>Armed with an alarmingly suspenseful trailer, Benecio Del Toro and Anthony Hopkins as leads, and a solid foundation of horror history to carry the major weight, this movie looked like a can't miss home run.  I can't say all expectations were met, but for those who know what they're looking for, entertainment is still possible.<br /><br />To start with, the two leads do not disappoint.  Both carry their scenes competently enough, but don't attempt to overwhelm.  I'd go so far as to say that Del Toro's interpretation of Lawrence Talbot, and the subsequent morose delivery - while normally suited for his roles - doesn't always fit the scene.  Nonetheless, the acting is one of the positives of the film, with Art Malik (the antagonist in True Lies) and Hugo Weaving (Agent Smith, Matrix) rounding out the cast.<br /><br />Estranged family member Lawrence returns home after receiving correspondence about his brother's death of unknown cause.  The only thing known is that his brother was gashed open with unrecognizable claw marks, and his brother's beautiful widow is still hanging around the English mansion - a lavish Victorian monstrosity with enough grandeur fitting of the time and position, and enough moaning floorboards and ten-foot cobwebs to make it spooky - with Lawrence's reclusive father, Sir John Talbot (Anthony Hopkins), a man with a shady (some say cursed) past to say the least.  Commence with the investigation into the brother's death, the increasingly revealed werewolf, and the "twist" ending that, when put together, gets a little long in the tooth.<br /><br />The cinematography is predictable but good.  Tons of dark, cloudy nights with impossibly bright moons looming dangerously.  The full moon appears often enough to get an IMDB page.  Similarly, the story sticks to tradition, adding in very good special effects befitting of a big budget movie.  Yet, it's not outstanding.  And therein lies the problem.  Nothing stands out, and there was very little in the way of character connection.  Add in a pointless, inappropriate romance, and result is a somewhat hollow overall feeling.<br /><br />Pretty simply, go into this movie with the understanding that the filmmakers intended to stay true to the werewolf lore and its tragic similarities and to Shakespearean literature, straying as little as possible to avoid the recent Hollywood habit of raping traditional perspective.  Do that and you'll have a good time.  Expecting the Wolfman to live a life happily after, and you'll be disappointed.<br /><br />Jason Elin</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ.html">A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ</a><br/><p>Since vampires are the chic supernatural creature of the moment, it's nice to see werewolves getting some love. And despite being based loosely on the classic monster movie, "The Wolf Man" is  surprisingly well-made and suspenseful horror-action story, draped in grey light, decayed backdrops and a growing sense of tragedy. Think of this as the "anti-Twilight."<br /><br />Lawrence Talbot (Benecio del Toro) receives a letter from his brother Ben's fiancee Gwen (Emily Blunt), telling him that Ben has vanished. By the time he arrives, his brother's body has been found.<br /><br />However, the body was so horribly mutilated that Lawrence is determined to figure out what killed his brother (especially since coming home has triggered some nasty flashbacks to how his mom died). While investigating Ben's last days at a local gypsy camp, Lawrence witnesses dozens of being people slaughtered by a monstrous wolflike creature. When he tries to kill it, it bites him -- and he nearly dies of blood loss and fever.<br /><br />Fortunately, Lawrence quickly heals from his wounds. But Scotland Yard's Inspector Aberline (Hugo Weaving) and the local villagers suspect that Lawrence himself either is a deranged maniac, or has acquired the curse of the "beast" (especially since he's completely healed). And on the night of the full moon, Lawrence discovers that there's some truth to those wolf-man superstitions -- and that his curse comes from someone very close to him.<br /><br />Ivy-draped crumbling mansions, grey skies over the moors, rainy London streets, misty stone circles and a forest haunted by a beast-man (or two). "The Wolf Man" is soaked in gloomy gothic atmosphere from beginning to end, until you almost feel like choking on all the gloom and greyness. In fact, the entire movie is like that -- it's SO relentlessly dark that it could give you SADS.<br /><br />And the storyline matches the gloomy atmosphere. Director Joe Johnston swings between haunting gothic suspense and gory gutsplattering action; the actual werewolf isn't very scary looking, but all the bloody dismemberment and lightning-fast attacks ARE very scary. To top it off, Johnston peppers the story with spooky flashbacks and some eerie hallucinations popping up to scare us out of our seats (including a wolf-boy who looks like Gollum). Fortunately Johnston also inserts some quiet, romantic moments for Gwen and Lawrence, especially that adorable stone-skipping scene.<br /><br />Downside? The asylum tortures and the whole "audience" scene were flashy and silly, and it feels like they were tacked in there for MGP (Maximum Gore Potential). Fortunately the movie settles back into its groove once everyone returns to Blackmoor, just in time for a harrowing climax of silver bullets, fire, and family strife.<br /><br />As for the actors, the movie rests on a solid square of them -- Benecio del Toro is a truly brilliant, tragic protagonist, whose entire life is turning into a nightmarish spiral of death and misery. Blunt is a delicate English rose with a core of steel; Anthony Hopkins is heartily creepy as del Toro's sociopathic dad. And Hugo Weaving is, as always, brilliant as a hard-edged inspector who is determined to bring down Lawrence no matter what he is ("We wouldn't have any silver bullets?").<br /><br />"The Wolf Man" is a solid antidote to the drippily romantic werewolf/vampire stories out now -- it's grey, gothic, monstrous and ultimately heartrending. A solid horror movie, but rather heavy to digest.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RKI7RPP5CJMG.html">A2RKI7RPP5CJMG</a><br/><p>As long as I can remember I have always been a fan of werewolf films.  From the good ("An American Werewolf in London") to the mediocre ("Silver Bullet") and from the funny ("Never Cry Werewolf") to the just plain bad ("Cursed"), I've seen just about every werewolf film that's been put out.  Of all of them, I've yet to see one come close to matching the greatness of 1941's "The Wolfman."<br /><br />Hoping to revive one of its legendary monsters, Universal offers up 2010's "The Wolfman," a remake loosely based on the 1941 Lon Chaney, Jr. classic.  It features Benicio del Toro as Lawrence Talbot, Sir Anthony Hopkins as Lawrence's father, Sir John Talbot, Emily Blunt as Gwen Conliffe, and Hugo Weaving as Scotland yard inspector Francis Aberline.<br /><br />While the basics of the original story are all there, such as Lawrence returning home to investigate his brother's violent death, the curse of the werewolf, frightened villagers, and a band of traveling gypsies, the rest of the tale varies greatly.<br /><br />In this version, Lawrence returns home with a damaged past.  After apparently witnessing his mother's suicide as a child, he is placed in an insane asylum for a year and then shipped off to America to live with relatives.  While acting in London, he decides to make a side trip home to find out what has happened to his brother who has gone missing.  When the grisly details are revealed, he starts looking for his brother's murderer.<br /><br />His investigation leads him to a group of gypsies where, unfortunately, he finds hiimself in the middle of a werewolf attack.  He survives the attack, but fans of the original know all too well what happens next.<br /><br />From here, he sets out to find the werewolf that has cursed him and also tries to find a cure.  Without revealing too much else, just know that Lawrence's story is changed quite a bit from the original film.<br /><br />While I liked many of the changes that were made to the original, I felt that director Joe Johnston fumbled the ball numerous times with these alterations.  Johnston added a bit of arthouse flavor to many of the transition scenes in the film, and spent a lot of time on flashbacks that, while not taking away from the basic plot of the film, didn't add much either.  Some of them were downright boring.<br /><br />The film was also very predictable.  From the beginning, I figured out who the real villain was and what would most likely happen.  While this did not ruin the film for me, it would have been nice if Johnston wouldn't have made the story so obvious right out of the gates.<br /><br />Johnston did get the atmosphere correct, initially giving the film a dark, gloomy and terrifying edge and then turning it into a desperate race for a man who hates and fears what he has become.<br /><br />Benicio del Toro does a pretty good job as Lawrence.  His performance is very subdued until his character starts to mentally unravel.  Sir Anthony Hopkins did a very good job as well, but I've seen him give much better performances in other films.  Emily Blunt delivers the goods each time we get to see her despite having a somewhat limited role.  The other primary player in this story, Aberline (Weaving), seems a bit over the top, but still fun to watch.<br /><br />The highlight of this film is the Wolfman himself.  Rick Baker's make-up is brilliant.  He updated the original make-up from Jack Pierce's 1941 creation, but kept all of the classic's primary appeal.  When you see the Wolfman on the screen, you know you're seeing the classic in all his glory.  When you look into the creature's eyes, you can see Lawrence Talbot begging for mercy underneath.<br /><br />The gore in the film is on scale with many modern zombie films.  The viewer gets to see human jaws impaled by werewolf claws, internal organs freed of their human confines, entrails and blood spattered all over the place and more than enough decapitations.<br /><br />Yes, there is some CGI in the film, particularly when the Wolfman takes to running and during transformations, but the creature itself is all make-up, hair and Benicio del Toro.<br /><br />Is the film great, not by a long shot.  It does have a few boring sequences and a bit of stiff acting, but overall it is well worth watching.  As of this writing, it is still in theaters.  If you haven't seen it in the theater yet, I highly recommend you do so if for no other reason than to see the big bad Wolfman fill up the screen and howl at the full moon in the background after rampaging through London.  It's one of the greatest shots I've viewed at the movies in a long time.<br /><br />For fans of werewolves, whether you'r idea of a werewolf is from "The Howling" or "Ginger Snaps," I highly recommend this film and  definitely recommend the 1941 classic.  Horror fans in general will also appreciate this film for its terror and "boo!" moments.  Action fans will also enjoy this movie.<br /><br />I plan on getting it when it is released on DVD.  If Universal plays their cards right, they'll release it on the night of a full moon.  Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/AUM3YMZ0YRJE0.html">AUM3YMZ0YRJE0</a><br/><p>I hate to admit it, but I liked this better than the original Larry Talbot, which I had watched last week.  This film has all the atmosphere, all the feverish guilt and anguish at fate, all the gory action.  The great difference is that the actors are uniformly superlative, not second-raters like Lon Chaney, Jr.  Of course, the effects are also superior.  Finally, the plot of the story diverges significantly from the original, which makes it stand on its own as something new, with somewhat richer themes than the original.  In particular, the psychologies of the various characters are complex and almost deep, which is great fun.<br /><br />TO say anything more would reveal too much.  I recommend this with enthusiasm.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ST1XBL6EQTBV.html">A1ST1XBL6EQTBV</a><br/><p>Benicio Del Toro plays the ill-fated Laurence Tolbert (sp?), who gets<br />bitten savagely by a strange beast in the dark & misty forest one night<br />and eventually becomes a werewolf.

Benicio Del Toro stars as Lawrence Talbot, who upon his return to his ancestral home after the brutal death of his brother, finds himself at odds with his father (Anthony Hopkins) and yearning for his dead brother's fiance (Emily Blunt).  Before you know it, he is bitten by the beast responsible for his brother's demise, and it isn't long before the curse of the werewolf has befallen Lawrence as well.  Anything that The Wolfman offers is nothing that hasn't been seen before in just about any and all werewolf flicks to see the light of day since the original 1941 classic was originally unleashed.  There is a heaping amount of blood and gore effects to satisfy nearly any gorehound, albeit some of the CGI wolf effects leave quite a bit to be desired.  That being said, Rick Baker's prosthetic effects are spectacular, while the film's cinematography and set design pay wonderful homage to the original film.  Del Toro, who bears a striking resemblance to Lon Chaney, is good, but it's Anthony Hopkins, who delivers such a memorable, albeit hammy, performance.  All in all, The Wolfman is nowhere near as mediocre as many have proclaimed it to be, and it deserves to be checked out at the very least, especially if you're any kind of a horror fan in the least.</p></br><a href="../users/ARA48345JZPZR.html">ARA48345JZPZR</a><br/><p>I dug it.  Hey, Larry Talbot goes home to a spooky old mansion and a weird old man, and there's a wolfman out in the countryside tearing some viscious Ay that's going to give him a very nasty bite.  The film looks great and there's atmosphere aplenty, and it moves quickly and wastes no time getting down to the business of eviscerating mayhem.  It both honored and updated the old film nicely.  Weirder and bloodier, but that's about right for an update.  I liked the interim in the insane asylum and the other tweaks to the story, and with the help of Rick Baker's terrific prosthetics you get some stunning transformations.  Yeah, of course there's CGI, but I thought it was used pretty much only where necessary.  As an aside, I thought it was eerie how much Benecio Del Toro suggested a thinner Lon Chaney Jr.<br /><br />I dunno, I went to see a monster movie, and that's what I got.  A pretty darn good one too, that ripped along with a flourish.  There was no deception.  I wasn't expecting King Lear, so I wasn't disappointed.  Worth it if you like monster movies.  If you don't, why would you go?</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>I approached this film with a lot of trepidition before watching it.  Knowing Rick Baker did the creature effects I thought he was going to resurrect his cheesy work from "An American Werewolf In London".  Secondly, screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker did a third rate job with "Sleepy Hollow" and I was expecting more of the same.  Thirdly I have a low tolerance for gore unless it's in the service of a good movie.  Lastly, I have an affinity for the 1941 film with Lon Chaney Jr.  Curt Siodmark's script for that film brilliantly and economically relates the sad fate of the doomed Larry Talbot.  Director Joe Johnson has allayed my fears, however.  His film not only lovingly references the original but there are some definite Hammer film influences here.  Walker's script not only expands the themes from the 1941 film but gives Lawrence Talbot a plausible backstory.  Benicio Del T oro is nothing short of brilliant as the ill-fated Talbot as is Anthony Hopkins as his estranged and enigmatic father.  I also liked the winsome Emily Blunt who is torn between saving the man but killing the beast inside the man.  It may take a strong stomache of sorts to sit through "The Wolfman" but you will be mesmerized by this retelling of this revered classic.</p></br><a href="../users/A2582KMXLK2P06.html">A2582KMXLK2P06</a><br/><p>The Wolfman really IS a unique blend of adventure and gruesome horror elements.  Unfortunately, there's a few serious problems with the script.  The acting is *extremely* reminiscent of a dramatic high school play which means it's hard for me to get into *every single one* of the characters present during the movie.  Everything about the characterization is severely overproduced and it's a major interference to me.  The entire script feels like a bloated mess as a result.  I hate it.  A comparison to a high school auditorium play is honestly totally appropriate.  The acting is borderline unbearable.<br /><br />However, the most shocking aspect of the Wolfman is the way it's somehow able to move beyond all that cheesy and unnecessary play-like acting and focus on really intense and downright disgustingly violent segments that involve a Wolfman going crazy in the woods and attacking people randomly.  Make no mistake about it- the amount of blood you will experience is REALLY high and the segments themselves are incredibly graphic.  Expect decapitations and other intense types of violence courtesy of the Wolfman's sneak attacks.<br /><br />Talk about surprising the way the movie writers went back and forth between two drastically different writing styles that honestly don't blend very well together, which will definitely make it extremely hard for most people to admire a movie like the Wolfman and will therefore struggle to enjoy the overdramatic acting in between the blood and violence.  As a result, most people will have to be extremely patient to sit through a movie like this because boredom is probably highly likely to occur.<br /><br />You have far fetched cheesy acting on one side and sickening violence on the other.  It's hard to be a fan of *both* styles so don't be surprised if you end up feeling disappointed after the film is over.</p></br><a href="../users/A5KLP39OKXD5P.html">A5KLP39OKXD5P</a><br/><p>A genuinely horrifying film concentrating neatly on werewolves in the most simplified manner possible, the best part of the film is, that during the whole film we witness an atmosphere that keeps whispering to us that 'something is going to happen!'.<br />A fabulous performance from Benecio Del Toro, makes the film much attractive and exceeds one's expectations easily. Benecio's performance is enough to get hold of your eyes and glue them to the screen quite easily. The rest of the cast deliver a decent performance.

Dark forests shrouded in mist.  Gothic mansions set in pale moonlight.  Stop-action photography, innovative camera angles, goose bump-inducing special effects.  This is a well crafted film very much worth watching--just prepare yourself for an uneven, if not completely superfluous, story.<br /><br />So much could be gleamed from the basic plot--the anguish, agony, and torment once Lawrence Talbot (a gloom-stricken Benicio Del Toro) learns he is a werewolf, doomed to kill and maim under each full moon.  Instead, this compelling story line is distorted and sidetracked by a romance never fully vetted, an inspector who constantly gets in the way, and by an aloof, eccentric father (don't get me wrong, Anthony Hopkins is his customary brilliant self) who has a showdown with his son that is nothing more than a howler.  (Pardon the pun.)  Accordingly we have a story that never finds a rhythm, that kicks and bucks and sputters and careens into silliness.  True, THE WOLFMAN looks good; it just doesn't have the story to be good.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning</p></br><a href="../users/AV6QDP8Q0ONK4.html">AV6QDP8Q0ONK4</a><br/><p>"Mysterious Gothic feel" is a buzz phrase for "poor lighting" because the special effects weren't that great. The acting was good and the story line was just fine. The movie was ruined by 19th century novelist dialogue that better fit a Jane Austin novel than a Gothic horror. The scenes tended to be dark to hide the fact the special effects have not improved since "American Werewolf in London." Lawrence Talbot is told by his brother's fiancee that he is missing. Talbot returns home only to find out his brother has been found dead, ripped to pieces. The movie is a complete bore until Talbot gets bitten by a werewolf and survives (not unexpected in a werewolf story). He then walks through the house and the dog growls at him. He stops as if he knows this is some kind of sign he is a werewolf. The scene would have worked except the dog growled at him all the time before he was bit and also (mini-plot spoiler) lives with Talbot's dad who is also a werewolf (revealed about half way through if you hadn't figured it out before hand). The gypsy woman which was great in the 1941 master piece is reduced to a minor character. Hugo Weaving plays a Scotland Yard investigator, thinks the killings that happen while Lawrence Talbot was away was caused by him, another bad plot element, which made as much sense as the dog growling. The werewolves in this movie just don't kill one guy and are done for the night, rather they go on senseless killing sprees. As in most werewolf movies the action jumps from full moon to full moon, which seem to come at an incredible rate.</p></br><a href="../users/AR1T36GLLAFFX.html">AR1T36GLLAFFX</a><br/><p>I generally enjoy comic-book type films like this.  And this is a good film, made better than average by the stunning cinematography and art direction.<br /><br />Appropriately set in a huge but decaying mansion in the wilds of England, The Wolfman stars the always wonderful Anthony Hopkins as Sir John Talbot, the lord of the manor.  Talbot was married to the beautiful Cristina Contes (Solana Talbot), but she tragically dies before the film takes place.  Talbot has two sons, Ben and Lawrence.  Ben is found murdered, in a ditch. Lawrence (Benicio Del Toro) returns to help find his brother, at the insistence of Ben's wife Gwen.  Lawrence has been scarred by the death of his mother, and has moved to America to forget the painful memory.  And there is trouble in the old moor.  Mutilated bodies keep popping up; the townspeople find so many that it brings a investigator from Scotland Yard, Abberline.<br /><br />Sir John is a slightly repellent figure.  Hopkins plays him in excellent fashion (as always), like a seedy, slightly batty older lord, falling slowly apart much as his manor is decaying.  The strange doings in the area (dead animals, and men) don't seem to perturb him too much.  His man-servant, Singh, is still there, helping Sir John with the running of the house (Sir John doesn't seem to do anything; there isn't a farm to speak of, just mysterious woods and dark ponds about.  I suppose the proverbial 'old money'.).  And then there is that brilliant full moon...<br /><br />The film is excellently shot and cleverly put together.  The moon seems twice as large in the skies over Sir John's manor, and it casts an odd light everywhere, including the nearby town, which seems to be rapidly losing its male population.  The colors are vivid and strange when the full moon comes out, and the very environs themselves take on an other-worldly appearance.<br /><br />Recommended.  It's a good film, solidly acted and well-made.  The opening and ending end-pieces of the film, with the tarot cards and the like is especially artful and vivid.  The set design is excellent, the make-up superb, and the costumes so good you don't notice them.  And there are those silver bullets.  The basic plot we've been seen before (so we know what's up when the silver bullets come out); most notably in the film with Lon Chaney, Jr. in the title role.  My only quibble is the film is needlessly graphic and gory.  Please, no more severed heads!</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>Lycanthropy is 'in folklore, the magical ability to assume the form and characteristics of a wolf: it also describes a delusion that one has become or assumed the characteristics of a wolf or other animal'.  What makes this remake of the original screenplay circa 1941 by Curt Siodmak is the apparent respect for the 'delusional' aspect of the subject matter.  The setting for the film is Blackmoor England 1891 and the screen is filled with imagery so dark and dependent on candlelight that the underlying terror of the story is well set.  The story is known to everyone: Sir John Talbot (Sir Anthony Hopkins in a mesmerizingly  dissociative role) has a past that includes the loss of his wife by 'suicide' and the loss of his one son Lawrence (Benecio Del Toro, miscast here) to the land of America where he became an actor, never communicating with his family - the family now being solely his father and his brother Ben (Simon Merrels) along with Ben's affianced Gwen (Emily Blunt).  While Lawrence is playing 'Hamlet' in London, Gwen comes to Lawrence's dressing room to seek his help in investigating the recent murder of Ben.  Lawrence acquiesces and returns to the Blackmoor manor, much to the surprise of his strange father. As Lawrence  begins his search he is attacked by a werewolf and thus, by definition, he becomes cursed and is destined to live out his days as an occult monster who breaks into the werewolf mode at the full moon.  The story from there needs to be viewed instead of reviewed as what little story there is lies in the conclusion of this strange family.<br /><br />The cast is strong - Hopkins is his usual master of acting, Blunt manages to create a credible character with the little material given her, Hugo Weaving turns in probably the best performance as an Inspector with insight about lycanthropy, and even Geraldine Chaplin glows a bit as the gypsy Maleva.  The cinematography by Shelly Johnson captures all the gory details of carnivorism and the stench of an insane asylum and Danny Elfman's musical score enhances the moods.  THE WOLFMAN is not a great movie, but it is a good period piece and a reminder of the original film that started the now overabundance of film on werewolves and vampires.

The Unrated version is a marked improvement over the choppy theatrical version of the film that we saw in theaters with better pacing and giving us a better understanding of the characters in the film (it's also a bit more graphic as well). Why studios continue to listen to preview audiences when deciding to re-editing a film (I can think of many films that later were seen as classics that suffered at the hands of studios..."Blade Runner" anyone?)in a seamlessly branched edition with both versions. "The Wolf Man" looks marvelous with a sharp, detailed looking transfer.<br /><br />Be aware however that I noticed a drop out in the sound at around the 1:30 mark it could be an isolated glitch but you may want to check your copy (and no it wasn't related to the player nor any dirt or debris on the disc as it happened at exactly the same spot. Could be something in the dual layer of the BD disc though). I didn't notice any other glitches and/or problems.<br /><br />Director Joe Johnston creates an atmospheric film with terrific production values. While there are elements that don't work in the film (Benicio Del Toro and Emily Blunt have zero chemistry both do give good performances although Del Toro at times seems a bit miscast to me). The action sequences particularly the sequence set at an asylum in London are terrifically staged and directed. Is the film flawed? Most certainly although the "Director's Cut" eliminates many of these flaws and "The Wolf Man" remains a gory entertaining movie.<br /><br />Actor Lawrence Talbot (Benicio Del Toro)returns home at the request of his brother's fiance to discover who or what mutilated and killed his brother. Long estranged from his father (Anthony Hopkins who chews the scenery quite ably), Talbot returns home reluctantly at first but becomes determined to find the creature stalking the locals. When Lawrence is attacked by the creature he becomes cursed becoming a monster when the full moon hangs high in the sky.<br /><br />The Blu-ray has quite a bit in the way of special features focusing on the visual effects, make up and thoughts behind remaking the 1940 film. Included as part of the package here is the ability to stream the original film via BD Live (it would have been nice if they had included it on Blu-ray as an extra here)and it looks quite good (here's hoping a BD version will arrive soon).<br /><br />"The Wolf Man" is QUITE gory and as well as being an atmospheric film. While I'm not sure if it is a "classic" it is an entertaining if flawed film and the "Unrated Director's Cut" is far superior to the theatrical version even if it is only 16 minutes longer.<br /><br />If in doubt, I'd suggest renting before buying.</p></br><a href="../users/A22BPC7LRSGSYQ.html">A22BPC7LRSGSYQ</a><br/><p>Just some thoughts...<br /><br />The Wolfman (2010) is a remake of the original 1941 movie of the same name.  The movie's plot was changed considerably, though it does retain a lot of the original plot.  One huge change is that the movie now takes place in 1891.  This movie stars Benicio del Toro, Anthony Hopkins, Emily Blunt, Geraldine Chapman, Art Malik, and Hugo Weaving.  The musical score by Danny Elfman is pretty good.<br /><br />This movie is definitely darker and scarier than the original.  This movie has a lot of CGI, but it's done well.  The movie looks great - dark and creepy woods, fog, mist, a full moon, creepy interior sets, etc.  Some critics say that this movie lacks suspense and scariness.  I disagree.  I think it has plenty of suspense and scares, considering it's a werewolf movie.  What do you really expect in a werewolf movie?  I think it would be unrealistic to expect a werewolf to tiptoe around his unsuspecting victims.  A werewolf is part wolf (a wild animal) and part man.  What do wild animals do?  Wild animals just attack full throttle - that's it.  That's the style of the werewolf creature and werewolf movies in general.  Maybe that's where the so-called lack of suspense comes in.  The werewolves just suddenly attack, in other words, jump-out-of-your-seat moments instead of creeping around.  Look at what happens when a man transforms into a werewolf - once the transformation is over, the werewolf goes on the attack and goes berzerk.  However, there IS some suspense leading up to some of the werewolf attacks out in the woods, in my opinion.  Some people might not like how the werewolf runs on four legs, but stands on two legs.  I think the four-legged running is cool.  The werewolves look terrifying.<br /><br />This DVD has the unrated director's cut, which is 1 hour, 59 minutes.  Also included is the theatrical cut, which is 1 hour, 43 minutes.  I like the director's cut a lot better than the theatrical version.  The extra 16 minutes contain a lot of good stuff.<br /><br />If you want to see a good werewolf movie, then I recommend this one.</p></br><a href="../users/AYBL30P5NXNZ4.html">AYBL30P5NXNZ4</a><br/><p>It's so refreshing to see an honest to goodness `traditional' horror movie... a remake of the classic Universal movie The Wolfman.  There have clearly been some noble intentions here in recreating and updating one of the original classic Universal horror movies.  The end result however, is a little fragmented, not quite delivering on all the promise, but still with some stunning visuals and some highlights worth seeing.<br />It's a straightforward origins type story with few surprises.  Benicio Del Toro plays the role with minimum histrionics, while still convincing, and Anthony Hopkins is always a must see, even when rehashing past efforts, coming across as a mixture of Zorro's Dad and Hannibal Lecter..Emily Blunt and Hugo Weaving round out the cast, she as the love interest, and he as the dogged Scotland Yard detective.  Weaving is probably the most fun element in a movie otherwise lacking in levity.  Visuals are fantastic, echoing the gloomy long shadows and foreboding images seen in the best of early black and white horror.  Where it comes apart though, is the second half.  This is the half that departs most from the story of the original.  The efforts to update the story seem to have left the makers with too much story, and a need to shoehorn action setpiece after action setpiece, with not enough thread left to join them together, and the story presumably left somewhere on the cutting floor.  Del Toro is reduced to running around with some too-busy camerawork trying to catch up with the story.  It works ok, but you get the feeling this was a better film at some point between its screenplay  and the editing room... perhaps a little less gore filled action, a soupcon of humour and a little more story in a shorter movie might have done the trick.  And am I the only one that finds it a little odd to see all those dollars go into complicated computer graphics technology to update the wolfman, producing a cgi creature that looks - very much like the original guy in a suit..?<br />Critics were unkind and it's perhaps not difficult  to see why; the film begins to feel quite incoherent , probably the result of having had a change in director in mid stream - and yet with a fun visual style, some actors well worth watching and a classic tale, it's actually quite entertaining and well worth a watch despite its flaws.</p></br><a href="../users/AMYMJ96STIRW.html">AMYMJ96STIRW</a><br/><p>This is a remake that is original, captivating, and a worthy version of the first one. The casting and acting are superb and the attention to detail and the overall "darkness" contribute to a throughly captivating and "frightful" experience. The attempt to recreate the vintage was exceptionally successful.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TXR85WQLE32N.html">A2TXR85WQLE32N</a><br/><p>The 1941 horror classic "The Wolfman", starring Lon Chaney Jr, featured primitive special effects and a simple, horrific, yet sympathetic tale of a man, bitten by an unknown creature, who becomes a monster at each full moon, and who yearns for release from his terrible curse.<br /><br />Fast-forward to 2010's "The Wolf Man."  Laurence Talbot is summoned back to his ancestral home of Talbot Hall on the disappearance of his brother.  He arrives to find his brother murdered and multilated, and rashly promises his brother's grieving fiancee Gwen that he will uncover the truth.  He visits the local gypsies for answers, only to be bitten by a mysterious beast.<br /><br />Nursed back to health by Gwen, Laurence is under suspicion by the local villagers, who fear a monster, and by Scotland Yard Inspecter Aberline, who seeks a murdering lunatic.  When the killings resume at the next full moon, Laurence discovers the nature of his curse.  He is confined at a facility for the criminally insane.  There, a visit from his father Sir John reveals the full horror of his situation.  Laurence will escape the mental institution to seek his fate at Talbot Hall.<br /><br />The movie generally follows the 1941 original, with some plot twists involving the (very) troubled Talbot family history.  Bernicio del Toro is a sympathetic Laurence.  Emily Blunt is stoic and effective as Gwen.  Hugo Weaving almost steals the movie as Inspector Aberline.  Anthony Hopkins is in full scenery-chewing mode as Sir John.  The famous Chatsworth Hall is morphed into a dark, brooding and decrepit Talbot Hall.  The movie is full of things that go bump in the night, both real and imagined.  The CGI effects are frightening, if surreal and a bit overdone.<br /><br />"The Wolf Man" is highly recommended as an entertaining horror flick and a decently-done successor to the original.</p></br></body></html>

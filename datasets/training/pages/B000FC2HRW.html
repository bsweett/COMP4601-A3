Strangely enough, most trilogies of the horror genre lose their production value and strength of character. Yet, instantly I was struck by the quality of the production.<br /><br />Honestly, the FINAL DESTINATION movies are REALLY one dimensional. There's no Freddy, Jason or Michael. There's an invisible force. A myth of death. A myth of when it's your time, it's your time and death will get you one way or the other.<br /><br />So there's no funny Freddy lines or chases. No scary faces. There aren't even any scary moments. Just... death scenes. Sort of like watching a fictionalized FACES OF DEATH. Sorta morbid now that I think about it. Yet, the characters are engaging, especially the lead character Wendy, played by relative newbie Mary Elizabeth Winstead (Ring 2 & Sky High).<br /><br />The most noteable thing, as I've already mentioned, is the production value. The MONSTER ROLLERCOASTER scene is very cool. Never in my life has a movie rollercoaster scene gave me that artificial feeling in the gut like being on a real rollercoaster, but, although not a huge effect, I sort of felt it in this movie. They took a regular and small theme park rollercoaster and CG'd a MONSTER ROLLERCOASTER and it's very effective. It looked incredibly high.<br /><br />It doesn't stop there. Nearly all of the scenes in Final Destination 3 are well done and engaging. The weight machine, the drive thru, the tanning beds, the warehouse & the carnival.<br /><br />I enjoyed the movie. I really did. Is it classic stuff? No. Does it have strong entertainment value? Sure does. I'll certainly buy this... just to ride the Monster Rollercoaster over and over.</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>While the originality is gone by the third movie, it is still a fun ride to watch death bump off a new cast of people who have cheated death.  This time, it is all the people who got off a roller coaster that crashed shortly after.  The story moves nicely, and most of the characters are interesting.  The deaths are certainly unique and pretty gorey.  This dvd is full of extras, including choosing an alternate path for characters to take which may lead them to safety.  The extras alone make this a worthy buy.  I will probably wait until the inevitable 3 movie box comes out and grab them all.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PN7Z2VTHICL8.html">A2PN7Z2VTHICL8</a><br/><p>A group of seniors on their high school graduation trip are at an amusement park, when Wendy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) has a premonition about the Devil Roller Coaster.  She becomes so upset that seven of the seniors leave the ride, and of course, the premonition of disaster comes true.  Her boyfriend dies in the crash, but Kevin (Ryan Merriman) his best friend lives.  Kevin has done his research, and finds an "urban legend" about a similar occurrence on Flight 180 years ago (a tricky reference to Final Destination #1), warning Wendy that the seven survivors are in danger.<br /><br />At first Wendy disbelieves Kevin, but as after two survivors die in a tanning bed mishap (I loved this scene, especially the fact that they were listening to "Roller Coaster Of Love" while they died), Wendy looks again at the photos taken the night of the crash and decides that the rest of the kids need to be warned.<br /><br />The 'Final Destination' movies are simple, flash-in-the-pan horror flicks with a bunch of teenagers and a bunch of grisly deaths.  This third installment holds true to the format and won't disappoint fans of the first two movies.  Head "poppers" seem to be a favorite of the death scenes.  A special mention goes to actor Kris Lemche as Ian McKinley, my favorite character.<br /><br />One thing Part Three has that the other two didn't is a special interactive feature on the DVD called "Choose Their Fate", which is fun.  I recommend watching the theatrical version first, then have some fun with the "Choices".  The choices don't have much to do with the outcome, but lead to different scenes, and besides, its fun to interact.  Some lengthen and some shorten the theatrical version.  You can also back up the scene and pick differently if you choose.<br /><br />'Final Destination 3' is a solid addition to the first two movies, if you like teenage horror flicks.  Definitely worth a purchase.  Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/ANEDXRFDZDL18.html">ANEDXRFDZDL18</a><br/><p>This is a teen scream film about a group of teenagers saved from death due to the precognitive talents of one of their number, only to have Death call in his chips. To my surprise I actually kind of liked it. It has an interesting premise: what would happen if death itself wanted you dead? Overall I was amused. It's not rocket science but it was fun.<br /><br />Negatives: I could've done without the t&a scene at the tanning parlor, but I'm sure the men loved it. The DVD also has a feature which allows you to 'choose the fate' of the characters at certain points. I tried it, but was 'meh' about it. I thought there would be actual film footage- instead, there is sort of an epilog which tells you 'what happened next...' to the characters. After the first one I didn't bother to try the others.<br /><br />I particularly liked the ending. Three stars. Average, but gory horror fun.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>Final Destination 1 was good. The concept that you can't cheat Death was done in a relatively new way. Final Destination 2 was also pretty good....It was a good sequel but a lot of the suspense that the first one had was gone because you pretty much were familiar enough with the concept to know that Death was coming fast and ugly for those that cheated It.<br /><br />Final Destination 3 had almost 0 suspense. You knew what would happen to everyone that cheated Death in the initial scene...it was just a matter of what kind of grotesque accident would befall the cheaters.<br /><br />Death and gore lovers will have a field day with Final Destination 3. There's all kinds of death and mutilation. The initial, well-publicized roller coaster scene is worth the price of admission. But the movie follows the roller coaster scene with a very predictable pattern of building up to the next gruesome death with some torturous B acting. It was easier to watch the deaths than the acting in between the deaths.<br /><br />The Final Destination formula is worn out and old. If you don't need a good movie to back your craving for blood, then you will enjoy Final Destination 3. Otherwise, perhaps wait for late night cable to waste your time.</p></br><a href="../users/A268EEWUXYCA8Q.html">A268EEWUXYCA8Q</a><br/><p>Sometimes I feel weird explaining horror films I want to see. For instance, I had a horrible time explaining why I wanted to see Hostel. That and Saw has to be some of the hardest to explain to non-horror-film-ites. Friday, I was asked what my plans were for the weekend.  I said, I was planning to see Final Destination 3. When I said that, it was "why would you want to see that?"<br /><br />And the response on the tip of my tongue was going to be "to see the teens offed in darkly humorous ways" but I stopped myself because I knew how that would sound. I mean, that is why I'm going to see it. Final Destination spooked me and made me jump and cringe due to the scary situations (getting strangled in your tub by wire to the point where your eyes turn red...that made me cringe in empathy) and Final Destination 2 made me laugh at the horrendously over-the-top ways Death plotted each person's demise. I laughed and said "Wow!" a couple times at the truly creative ways in which the real world could kill someone. Part of the fun in that movie was figuring out not "if" a person would be offed but how. It kept you guessing and played with your expectations.<br /><br />Director James Wong returns to helm the third film and makes a film that has some of the best and worst aspects of the first two.  He is a pretty decent technical director.  The camera angles are great as is the general cinematography.  To begin with, I thought the roller-coaster was a bit tame, compared to the horrific car accident and plane explosion of the first two films.  However, some of the deaths that follow it exemplify some of the best of cause and effect science laws where the littlest thing ends up causing so much destruction.<br /><br />The actors and characters are all pretty much stereotypes and cliches which actually makes the movie more enjoyable.  You know these people aren't real, you know that, in effect, you are watching cliches getting splattered and shot, instead of real people.<br /><br />The strength of the second film was how different each death was.  The third film has too many "splat" deaths.  They are and aren't as creative as the first two, if that makes sense, meaning if taken by themselves are creative, but looked at as a whole, they are too similar to each other.<br /><br />It also relies on too many cliches of the first two films.  The rustling wind, the protagonist slowly twirling around as if experiencing something the rest of us can't see.  The candles flickering when there's no breeze to flick them.  It got in the way of what we want to see.<br /><br />In the end, its a good entry in the series.  Sometimes it excels over the past two, but at times it drags under the contraints of the film.  I want to see a fourth film in which the people try to outsmart death, not wait around to see what It is going to do and then try to react.  Or, how about one of the characters, like the goth figure in this film, decide to take matters into his or her own hands and try and kill the last person who's supposed to die (as suggested in this film but never used)?  They need something new to inject into the series to keep it going past its one shot premise.<br /><br />A good film, sometimes better sometimes worse than its prequels, but overall a fun way to spend an evening...if watching heads splat and teens fake bake themselves to death is your cup of tea.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M5O6UHXO9IBU.html">A3M5O6UHXO9IBU</a><br/><p>Although not directed by the original guys, I would say the former sequel was better. It was punchier, ingenious and had a twist linking the protaganists to the 180. In 3 the makers assumed we just wanted gorier deaths. Ain't neccessarily so. It was a little too slow and maudlin too. I think the problem with both the sequels is they could not come up with an ending that matched the 'Carter special'. That was just genius, pure and simple. Never the less, I laughed.<br /><br />Why are these films popular? Why were two elderly patrons in the row ahead of me, supposedly outside the projected demographic? I think it's because everybody has a story like my fathers, or knows someone who does. He and his workmate rushed to catch a train just as it was departing. His friend climbed on board and hung out the window urging him to jump aboard. But my father could see the train was full and he would have to stand in the corridor the whole trip so he said he'd catch the next one. The train crashed and his friend was killed. Gonna take a love train....</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>There is someone walking behind you,<br />Turn around, look at me.<br />There is someone watching your footsteps,<br />Turn around, look at me<br /><br />Yes, an old song by the Lettermen becomes the harbinger of death in "Final Destination 3."  The McKinley High School senior class is enjoying a graduation celebration at a local amusement park, but Wendy Christensen (Mary Elizabeth Winstead, "Sky High") is having bad feelings about the giant roller coaster ride that is supposed to be the highlight of the evening.  When Wendy, her boyfriend, her girlfriend and her boyfriend, Kevin Fischer (Ryan Merriman, "The Ring Two") go to get on the ride the first car is up for grabs.  Wendy refuses to sit there and Kevin loses the coin toss and has to go sit in the back with his girlfriend's girlfriend (they do not even like each other).  It takes a while for it to happen, but everybody dies and then Wendy finds herself back at the start of the ride and starts screaming to let her out of the death trap.<br /><br />You know that "Final Destination 3" is going to be about the Grim Reaper coming for those who survive death the second time around, and so we have the bubble headed tag team of Ashley (Christal Lowe) and Ashlyn (Chelan Simmons), creepy pervert Frankie (Sam Easton), big strong jock Lewis (Texas Battle), and the Goth couple of Ian McKinely (Kris Lemche) and Carrie Dreyer (Gina Holden).  Wendy and Kevin are clearly the privileged couple, which means they are the ones who are going to figure out the pattern and try avoid ending up dead teenager.  Kevin does Internet research so he actually knows about Flight 180 and the first movie, which saves time in getting Wendy on board.  Since she is the control freak, she takes over the key role in what happens.<br /><br />"Final Destination" director James Wong is back as is Glen Morgna who wrote screenplay for the first film from Jeffrey Reddick's story (Wong gets a screenplay credit as well this time).  The opening of "Final Destination 3" is essentially the same as the original, only this time with a roller coaster instead of an airplane and with Wong letting it drag out a bit longer given this is familiar territory.  We know the rules of the game and until the initial death ride is over we cannot get to the main part of this 2006 horror film.  Wong and Morgna also know how to play the game and they make a conscious effort to up the ante for the death sequences.<br /><br />There are two key differences in "Final Destination 3," of varying significance.  The first is that Wendy's camera has pictures of everybody who got off the roller coaster and she makes a connection between what is in the photograph of the first survivors to die and how they die.  Of course, sometimes there is more than one picture and figuring out what are the key elements in the movie comes at the last moment, but it does provide a different dynamic.  However, this is restricted to helping the audience pick up on the elements falling (usually literally) into place to set up the deaths.  Wendy discovers ominous photographs of both the World Trade Center attack and Lincoln's assassination that tie into her theory as well (Suddenly you flash on the next film, "Final Destination 1865," but get confused as to how what happened at Ford's Theater could be turned into one of these Rube Goldbergesque circumstances).<br /><br />The second is that the corpses, if not the deaths, are way more gruesome (this movie wins the award for most gruesome death by a nail gun, which is not example a category short of nominations).  My wife was torn between using her hands to cover her face and grabbing my hand so she could dig her nails into my palms (she decided to go with closing her eyes and lowering her head so she could really dig those nails in nice and deep).  I think the best part of the "Final Definition" films are the way simple things conspire to kill someone and the first two in the first movie (Tod in the bathtub and Ms. Lewton in her kitchen) are still the best of the bunch.  But it has been a long time since I have seen a film where the deaths make you wince, partly because of the blood and everything but also because each one is set up to build the sense of anticipation of seeing something that you do not want to see.  If that is a key criteria for seeing a horror movie in a theater as opposed to waiting for it to come out on DVD, then "Final Destination 3" really delivers.  Let me just say that my wife has informed me in no uncertain terms that she will never go with me to a theater to see another horror film as long as she lives (and I suspect she will not go to see one without me either).<br /><br />The Achilles heel of the "Final Destination" films turns out to be the punch line at the end of the first film, which as I recall was not the original ending.  If you make only one film that final cut to black is a great in your face (or back of your head) ending.  But when you make a series it is problematic because it says that no matter what you see and no matter what they do, all of these kids are going to die.  You can stop short of the actual moment, but everybody is going to arrive at their final destination despite their best efforts.  Consequently, it makes sense that the ante has been upped on the deaths in this film because in the end what else does this story have to offer?</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>I just got back from seeing FD3 and I would say that it is just as good as the first two films. The deaths are way gruesome (some seem to have been edited, so bring on the Unrated DVD), but they aren't as inventive as the ones in the past films. The acting and dialogue isn't the greatest in the world, but for this kind of film, it could be much worse. This is rated R horror movie that delivers the goods!</p></br><a href="../users/AZQ7O73EAS3VI.html">AZQ7O73EAS3VI</a><br/><p>I love Mary Winstead. Other than her, this is just a typical horror flick. Not as good as the original Final Dest but not as dumb as the second.</p></br><a href="../users/AIFXFHO2N9WJB.html">AIFXFHO2N9WJB</a><br/><p>With the release of two successful entries into the relatively new `Final Destination' series New Line Cinema was faced with a minor dilemma.  Continue releasing further entries into the series, and risk failure by creating sub-par movies, or quit while ahead and take pride in the fact that you released two successful and original horror films (a feat not easily obtained in today's modern movie age).  Plus the fact that both current installments were highly entertaining supernatural/horror thrillers that managed to avoid the clich&eacute;d pitfalls of most horror films, which led me to believe that New Line Cinema was playing things smarter with this series.  However, the appeal of strong box office returns always outweighs executive's better judgment in such matters.  When it was announced that "Final Destination 3" was being made, I was highly doubtful of the film being all that good, but I thought the same about the second movie and I was proven way wrong on that count.  So, I kept an open mind and awaited the release of the trailer to fill me in on the story for the third movie, and once the preview finished, I was fairly certain that this movie was not going to be as good as its predecessors.  But, I thought, since I had already seen the first two in the series and they were entertaining, I may as well see this one.  Of course I waited for DVD, I wasn't about to go pay 7.00 dollars to watch this movie, especially with an increasingly strong probability that it wouldn't be all that good.<br /><br />"Final Destination 3" begins with a group of teenagers preparing for graduation and their lives beyond high school.  In this group you have, the bad boy, the popular girl, the hot chick(s), the outcast, and the jock, this group comprises your basic horror movie cast.  During a graduation celebration, the outcast named Wendy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), has a vision of the roller coaster her and the rest of the group are preparing to ride crashing and killing all onboard.  Upon waking up from her vision, Wendy freaks out getting herself removed from the ride along with several others in the group and within moments of Wendy being removed the ride begins and all the events she had just witnessed in her vision come true.  All the people on board the ride, including a couple of her friends, are killed.  Wendy's prophetic episode prompts the bad boy of the group (Ryan Merriman) to do some research, and he discovers that she's not the first to have these visions, but also if history continues to repeat itself that all who got off the ride are still in danger as Death is looking to finish off what it began that dark night.<br /><br />So, how does a movie studio continue to churn out hit after hit within a movie franchise without leaving the audience feeling like they've seen it all before?  And when will they learn that a franchise has reached its peak, and they should quit while ahead?  For some franchises there may never be enough, for there is always a new way to reinvigorate the franchise; "Batman Begins" and "007: Casino Royale" would be prime examples.  But other franchises, primarily those of the horror genre, tend to overstay their welcome long after their franchise has peaked, and therefore fail to achieve hit after hit.  But that doesn't necessarily stop the studios from trying to find that special something to achieve box office gold yet again with a single series.  Examples for franchises that overstayed their welcome would be `Halloween', `Friday the 13th', and `A Nightmare on Elm Street'.  Sometimes movie studios know how to keep a good thing going for as long as they can, and then they know when to cut it off, so that profits won't taper off.  Dimension Films found huge success with their highly successful `Scream' trilogy, they also knew that past "Scream 3", the franchise would be entering that `overstayed welcome' territory, and that was a risk they didn't want to take.  So, have the powers-that-be at New Line Cinema managed to release another entertaining and profitable installment into a franchise or have they overstayed their welcome?<br /><br />Well, the answer is a mixture of both.  "Final Destination 3" was an entertaining chapter in the series, hopefully a final chapter, because though the movie was fun and kept my attention throughout, it made me feel a little too much of  `been there, done that'.  The characters were your typical horror cast of characters as I pointed out above, and the story felt a little too much like a rehash of the story from the first film, making the movie seem unoriginal for a franchise that had succeeded in being original.  Even though I have my gripes about this third chapter in the `Final Destination' series, I still liked it, though not as much as the first two.  The death scenes were inventive and original enough, without being over-the-top and gory.  The cast was fairly solid, the movie could have definitely benefited from a veteran actor or two.  It was nice to see that the series remembers its roots and references events from the first two films to link the proceedings together, but this also served as a reminder as to how unoriginal this installment was.  The biggest problem "Final Destination 3" had, aside from lack of originality (which was bound to happen in a series like this), was that New Line didn't appear to try as hard with this movie, and the story proceeded along in a rather predictable manner.  With all that being said, the movie as I stated earlier in the paragraph, was still entertaining, and would serve as a decent ending to the franchise.  Because, in my opinion, any further entries would be an example of overstaying one's welcome, and I hope New Line is smart enough to figure that out.<br /><br />"Final Destination 3" is rated R for violence, language, and nudity.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>What's better than seeing impossibly attractive teenagers meet their gory demise?  Nothing I tells ya!!!  X-Files alumni James Wong and Glen Morgan return to the series they helped spawn with Final Destination 3; which is sadly the worst installment of the series yet.  Rising star Mary Elizabeth Winstead (soon to be seen in Grind House and Live Free or Die Hard) has a premonition of impending doom on a rollercoaster ride, and wouldn't you know it as soon as she and a few friends exit that everybody dies painful and horrible deaths?  Anyone familiar with the first two films knows what's going to happen, the sad part is that this time around isn't as fun as the other two.  The first film was a surprisingly good thriller, while the lesser second installment was trashy fun.  Final Destination 3 just doesn't have that spark that made the other films guilty pleasures.  Not to mention that most of the actors are terrible to boot, but Winstead is plenty easy on the eyes.  There's some nice CGI generated gore effects, and some inventive deaths (you'll want to avoid tanning beds for a while); although many of which can't hold a candle to anything found in the first two films.  Final Destination 3 isn't absolutely horrible, but it's not the enjoyable, sleezy trash fest that one would come to expect from the series either.  New Line, who made a name for themselves with films like these, have given an overly generous heaping of extras to the DVD; some of which are worth checking out more than the film itself.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GKPMHV4U64IY.html">A3GKPMHV4U64IY</a><br/><p>Much like the earlier films, we have a character who foresees a terrible accident and winds up saving a bunch of lives.  In trying to figure out what is going on, the protagonist comes across the idea of a camera having caught premonitions of how the survivors will die.  Another twist is that she is not sure who all got off of the roller coaster and is now in danger.  This time photographs provide clues to how death will catch up to the survivors.<br /><br />Much of the film is just what you would expect with the lead trying to warn people of their impending doom and lots of Rube Goldberg-style accidents.  Some of the action feels a little more intense that in the other films.  Certainly the ending is original and not just a rehash of the first two.  There is also the nice added tension supplied by not knowing who all is on the list.  When the final riders are identified it adds another dimension to the film.<br /><br />All in all a pretty predictable film but with a pretty good ending.  If you liked the first two films then there is no reason not to like this film except familiarity.  The acting was a little better than in the first (couldn't stand the lead in that one) and some of the writing is a little tighter.  There were obvious attempts to make the story fresh and new so it doesn't just wind up as a lame sequel.  Check it out.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EAU736LWTDCE.html">A3EAU736LWTDCE</a><br/><p>I really, REALLY wanted to give this 5 stars. I guess I had my expectations too high when I went to see it. I liked the second movie so much I was really hoping they could top it. Don't get me wrong, FD3 is a very good movie! I will buying it when it comes out to DVD, and I definitely would recommend going to theaters and seeing it. So, with that being said, I want to start off saying I do not think this one topped the first two movies. It does how ever offer a few deaths scenes that make it a must watch for gore lovers. I will not try to give too much away, but I will try to sum it up as best as possible: The acting isn't up to par with the first too movies. I didn't feel as attached to these characters as I did in the first too movies. It had kind of a cheesy feeling to it. Maybe like a "Scary movie" or "scream" kind of atmosphere. It was a movie that couldn't possibly scare anyone, and never seemed to take itself seriously. I think these kids were no where near as good as the kids in the other movies.<br /><br />  Next, the plot is over done. Even though I love this series and wish it would go on forever, I can easily see how the concept is getting very burnt out. The plot was overdone and lacked any surprises for those of us who have seen the first 2. I also agree with the one review who said the death scenes didn't seem as elaborate in this one. There was a lot of "splatter death" in this one: an easy horror movie effect. A horror movie example: throw a body in front of a moving vehicle, then show the blood hitting onlookers in the face. Yea, its bloody, so what? Remember in FD2, the scene with the barbed wire fence? I think it took a lot more creativity to make that scene than it does to make blood splattering against people's faces. Once again, don't get me wrong here. This movie does have it moments, and it does have about 2 scenes that might be the goriest in the trilogy, but it still did not outdo the other ones. So your left with an all to familiar plot, not so hot acting and some beautiful gore FX. In the end though, what really brought this movie down for me was the ending. Anyone could have wrote a better ending. Since this is supposed to be the last movie in the series I was really hoping for something explosive, unexpected, and extraordinary for an ending, instead it was very cheesy.<br /><br />  Verdict: they don't make too many movies this gory anymore, for that reason alone it is worth seeing, just don't expect a lot of new territory here.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R6ST52EBN2FK.html">A3R6ST52EBN2FK</a><br/><p>I've been waiting for this for a while.  It does stay true to the stories that preceeded it, but I agree with the previous review, this is sooo much gorier.  I've always had a funny feeling about roller coasters and airplanes, I really don't trust the aging mechanisms and the people that are supposed to be inspecting them, so this definitely played on those fears.  My pick for the goriest death?  The hardware store one.  The roller coaster was a great starter, but unlike the airplane in FD1, and the log truck in FD2, I was most shocked at the poor girls demise at the store in this one.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>If you are sitting in a nearly empty theater, with a dozen other people, and you have a premonition you are about to waste 90 minutes of your life, head for the nearest exit. In all likelihood, your premonition will be correct.<br /><br />Okay, I'll admit it. I liked the first "Final Destination". It took a tired, old, over-worked premise, the horror film in which dumb teenagers get killed, and added a little twist to it, elaborate Rube Goldberg-esque murders. It was like watching a game of "Mousetrap", only with murder. The unique thing about the first film is that many of these `contraptions' ended with a quick cut, just as the victim is about to fall prey, allowing our mind to fill in the blanks. The filmmakers mixed these less gruesome, elaborate machinations with quick, brutal murders, keeping the viewer on their toes, always guessing.<br /><br />"2" was a mess. A retread with more gruesome elements, robbing the film of any of the interesting work found in the first.<br /><br />"3", directed by James Wong, an alumnus of "The X-Files", and co-creator (some might argue, perpetrator) of the first installment, attempts to use the mix of the first film while adding more gruesome elements, apparently to appease audiences who expect more and more graphic material. It just doesn't work. Part of what holds your interest in the first film is that you are never quite sure how someone will get offed. Some were gruesome. Some were elaborate. In "3", all of the methods are elaborate, but all are equally gruesome and graphic in detail. This provides the gore, but none of the shock.<br /><br />The acting? Irrelevant. A bunch of forgettable teenage actors, many of whom would be unable to get jobs on the WB, attempt to make their characters believable. But these attempts fail. Miserably. Then again, any one who goes to see this film isn't going to discover the next Meryl Streep. They want to see some teenagers get killed. That's what this genre is all about and it doesn't fail in that regard.<br /><br />But unlike the first film, it doesn't provide anything new. Yes, the teenagers are killed in different ways, but because they are all gruesome, the film doesn't have any of the surprise or interest the first entry had.<br /><br />Story? Ludicrous. Again, this isn't really the point of these films. An elaborate attempt is made to try to make the story believable. A young teenage girl has a premonition the roller coaster she is about to get on will have a terrible crash, killing her and all of the members of her senior class in the process. She screams and yells and they finally let her off, along with most of her senior class. Her boyfriend remains on the coaster. Soon, the car does jump the tracks and the remaining people all die. But what about the people who got off the ride? The girl soon realizes Death still wants them and will do whatever it can to get them, in the same order they should have died on the roller coaster. If they are able to save someone, Death skips them over and moves on to the next one. If you haven't stopped reading by now, due to the fact that you are laughing so hard at the ludicrous nature of the story, keep reading. The teenager is a photographer for the yearbook. Before they got on the ride, she took a lot of pictures of the Senior Class. As she realizes the survivors will soon die, she also realizes that there are clues to the deaths of the remaining survivors in the pictures. Oh no, not the pictures!<br /><br />The only thing that might have saved this film from the inevitable 99 cent rental bin at your local video store would be if they returned to the original formula of the first installment. Some elaborate murders with quick cuts, and some quick gruesome murders, leaving the viewer on their toes. Instead, they sort of combine both for this new installment, resulting in a predictably gruesome teenage blood fest. It seems sad that horror films have to be so gruesome, so bloody in this day and age. Whatever happened to the great films that left a lot of the horror to your imagination? These were much more effective and will stand the test of time. Instead, filmmakers now seem to feel it necessary to depict every gruesome detail for the viewer. Perhaps they feel that the viewer can no longer use their imagination and needs everything handed to them on a silver platter. When an image is left to your imagination it is usually scarier than anything a filmmaker could create, so let us think about it.<br /><br />Forgettable.<br /><br />Come on, you weren't going to see this were you? That's what I am here for. To see crap like this, so you don't have to waste your time.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>I'd just like to say on the record, I've loved both previous Final Destinations, and couldn't wait to get my hands on this one. I especially liked the fact that in you can take control of whether the characters die or don't die. Although I resisted when I first got it, and watched the theatrical version.<br /><br />I've now watched it twice, the theatrical version and today, the Choose Your Fate version. I didn't really change too much at first about the second version, although I ended up saving Frankie Cheeks (why?!) and if you choose the 76 degrees during the tanning salon scene, you actually see a slightly changed version of it - although both girls still die. Also, for previous reviewers who have had a little moan about the fact there's no links between this & the previous two, there is, but it's well hidden. Watch the Choose Your Fate version, and then right towards the end, in the train scene, the old guy who's sleeping on a bench, has newspapers covering him. You'll get the option to read an article on the newspaper, and there's your link to the previous movie. Very very cool.<br /><br />The actors in this are all amazing, especially Wendy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), she has the amazing ability to cry at the drop of the hat, even when she wasn't really crying, just tearing up. Her and the actress who played her sister, could have been sisters in real life they looked so alike! Also, Kris Lemeche, who played Ian McKinley, was brilliant! I actually developed a tiny little crush on him during the film, but mainly because he reminded me so much of Christian Slater's character in Heathers. The look, the dry humour, the one liners - it was all Christian Slater! The rest of the actors were alright, dispensible really.<br /><br />The tanning salon scene really freaked me out! Having been to tanning salons many times before (albeit, in the upright booths) I knew about this in advance (I read the novelisation when I was on holiday), so I was prepared to see it, but it still really freaked me out. It's just so well filmed, almost realistic, and my skin literally felt like it was burning afterwards.<br /><br />The rollercoaster scenes were scary too. I've only been on two rollercoasters in my life, and I don't plan going on any again. The first one I kept my eyes closed the entire time, the second time was a tiny one on holiday.<br /><br />I LOVED the new element to the Final Destination franchise, clues being left to how each character is going to die. Very well thought out, and lots of different and original deaths. All the clues are stored in photos taken, and there's little clues left in all of them to how that individual character is going to die. It makes for great fun for the viewers to work out what's going to happen.<br /><br />The final was changed after test screenings from audiences proved negative, but I have to say I liked the original ending, and the alternate. The alternate brings a new spin onto things, and definitely makes you jump.<br /><br />The extras on this are amazing, and very informative, although there are a couple that are actually LONGER than the film itself. There's some great scenes of how they filmed the rollercoaster scene (which is a shame, as you can spot what they've done in the film afterwards), and in one night, the actors had to ride the rollercoaster 26 times, so they could get all the shots in - and some hilarity as everyone takes bets on who's gonna throw up first.<br /><br />Listen out for Tony Todd as the voice of the devil (how appropriate), and also the train announcer at the end of the movie.<br /><br />This is definitely my favourite out of all 3 of the Final Destination films, and will definitely be watching it again, just so I can try all the different outcomes of the Choose Your Fate feature.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>Horror films come in 2 flavors: gory and over-the-top as possible, or psychological thrillers. Well you can obviously tell what Final Destination 3 is going to be right? Despite the contrivances, these films always offered the best gore-filled deaths around and this film doesn't skimp on it either. One thing you'll always love about these films is the gorefest involved, where it almost becomes giddyness when somebody gets off very gruesomely. It'll make you question your sanity at seeing such scenes but boy it's fun!<br /><br />A soon-to-be graduating class is out at the fairground and decide to get on a high rollercoaster. Wendy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), yearbook student and self-described control freak, has a premonition where the rollercoaster kills everyone in it so she freaks out and people get off the ride but the ride still continues, leaving her boyfriend and best friend on. The crash goes according to plan and Wendy finds herself trying to save everyone's life when Death is after everyone who get off the ride and he's kinda ticked and dispatches them in gruesome ways.<br /><br />While bloodwise you would probably say the second one was the biggest, the third is arguably the most creative. Characters die in gruesomely bloody fashion and we get to see it. However there is one slight nitpick: they're a bit too elaborate. Instead of just a simple accident or a bad case of wrong place/wrong time, Death now is playing Mousetrap: Rube Goldberg-like scenarios where one thing knocks over another thing which turns on another thing that shorts another thing and it just goes until the character dies. It becomes a bit silly, and plus there is one big plothole: that of somebody's video camera. But there is some effective deaths including a nailgun and a tanning salon. But the tension for some reason gets kind of lost since Wendy, thanks to photographs she took night of the rollercoaster crash which contains clues to character demises, is aware of how everyone dies and it doesn't become as much a shock. See the glass pane boy from part 2 compared to tanning salon here: we're aware something nasty is going to happen in there and you end up almost waiting for the carnage.<br /><br />Acting-wise of course it's not the strongest although anything terrible makes it slightly better with Mary Elizabeth Winstead who manages to at least give some weight to what is essentially a plotless script (not to mention she's my new actress crush since, not only is she quite adept at acting but there's such a natural beauty about her). Everyone else though is not quite as stellar. Each one has 2 moods: their basic attitude towards everything (the jock who's kind of a jerk, the ditzy "like oh my gawd" mall wenches) and the disbelieving attitude they have when Wendy comes up to them and rants they're going to die.<br /><br />Extras-wise it's quite nice as we get a commentary with director James Wong and co-writer Glen Morgan, an almost hour-and-a-half long documentary about the film with some weirdly funny bits (for some reason, I got such a kick out of "chunky goodness"), a featurette about the dead teenager movie genre with discussion from historians and Roger Ebert and others. There is one weird addition and that is the "Choose Your Fate" version. Basically at certain points, the screen morphs into a screen where you can make a decision about an action a character can make in the film. It's a neat idea since you get to see more footage (and for me, more Winstead) but it's kind of a hassle since some decisions like the very first one inadvertedly stops the film really early while another is basically the same death just with one minor detail added. Also, if you watch the theatrical version, those moments cause a slight pause in some players.<br /><br />Unlike such films as Hostel or the Hills Have Eyes which were just pointless gore with a story that's going nowhere and taken too seriously, the Final Destination films know what kind of film it's going to be and does so with gusto. That of a gore galore film where you almost feel disturbed about how much of a kick you're getting out of characters getting the axe (figuratively though).</p></br><a href="../users/A21VGNU5959O85.html">A21VGNU5959O85</a><br/><p>Final Destination 3 is hopefully the final installment to this series. They have all been entertaining, gory, and clever but the charm has finally worn off for me personally. The acting has never been first rate, horror movies rarely offer Oscar worthy performances. The formula has always been followed, someone gets a vision saves others from a terrible fate than one by one they all hand in their "get out of death " free card to the grim reaper. The main characters must figure out the order of death, and maybe cheat it making it skip and therefore end the cycle completely. By this third movie, it seemed to me the kill scenes were just getting a bit forced and completely unbelievable even for a supernatural causation. The tanning beds, the nail gun, the motor chopping off heads, and the exercise equipment were just off from the first two movies genius. The extra feature where you can decide their fate with your remote was a waste of time, I don't understand even putting it on there unless they really had changed some of the fates (besides the one dude with the stupid hat , which when saved just disappears and it makes no sense) I have read other reviews on here, and I have to agree with whomever pointed out that the pictures before the rollercoaster shouldn't have showed their grim fates, if they all were supposed to die on the ride, Did death know she would save them? If so than that changes everything, its not really cheating death than is it? Oh well, anyway, watch this if you have some free time, and if you liked the first two, its an okay , hopefully the end to this played out series.</p></br><a href="../users/A2LW5AL0KQ9P1M.html">A2LW5AL0KQ9P1M</a><br/><p>Enough plot-holes to run a roller-coaster through ... but little else.<br /><br />For those who crave horror/supernatural films, both "Final Destination" and "Final Destination 2" were a pleasant surprise. The original film presented a youthful but talented cast. It also offered a remarkably original premise injected with a bit of dark humor. Quite a treat! Moreover, while "Final Destination 2" had a thinner plot, the technical effects were completely unexpected -- utterly groundbreaking. The mature casting granted the film an interesting sense of plausibility. So phenomenal a visual-spectacle is the second installment of this film that I shared it with my film-studies class! Now for "Final Destination 3"... Not only are the actors ridiculously inexperienced (this is the first foray into acting for some...and it shows!), they seem to be entirely unaware of their less-than-mediocre talents. This is not a problem of editing, this a serious problem with casting. These actors literally have their foundation in television-acting (check the bios) ... and we are talking bad, bad cable acting (or the CW). The talent is so heinous that that viewer hopes for these actors deaths (not because he/she craves the brutality, but merely as a relief from the "acting"). But, and here is the worst crime the film commits, the deaths are ineffective. The problem: they lack creativity. The first two installments of this franchise used viewer-misdirection to shock its audience with appalling death-scenes. In this instance, the deaths are both predictable and obvious. A tremendous disappointment, indeed.<br /><br />And, for those "Final Destination" fans who think they are going to see a slightly dumbed-down echo of the first two films. ... think REALLY dumbed-down. The grotesque caricatures of teens, the crass/vulgar humor, the gratuitous nudity, and the excruciating writing was shocking. It is unusual to see a director deliberately disregard a film's cult-following. Not only did Wong ignore the intended audience for the film, but he insulted them.<br /><br />For all horror enthusiasts: be prepared to walk-away from the film angry ... and it's not just the SLOPPY, SLOPPY conclusion. Trust me. This is not "Final Destination 3" . . . This is Friday the Thirteenth Part 40 . . . it is base, it is amateurish, and an utter disgrace.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IUI3CJUMB7J0.html">A1IUI3CJUMB7J0</a><br/><p>The acting was horriable but overall the deaths scenes where good and the movie was entertaing. The first 15 min was so bad it's almost as bad as to walk out of the theaters they draged it on and on and on (you'll be screaming at the screen to get on the rollercoster allready). The film gets good when the death scenes' start happening the death parts are really good and well done just like the other films. The acting was bad and I mean bad. The first film is still the best and the sequal was better but this film was still good and a must see if you seen the other films and the film is entertaining.</p></br><a href="../users/AWJOVW1BZZ34H.html">AWJOVW1BZZ34H</a><br/><p>...more entertaining deaths. Teenagers that survive a roller coaster crash are stalked by the entity known as death. Lots of gore, couple nice racks and lots of screaming. What more could you want from this type of movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2G6GO4O7EVCPF.html">A2G6GO4O7EVCPF</a><br/><p>James Wong comes back as the director in this movie, he directed the first one which was the only good one out of the series and this one doesnt even compare to the first one, neither does the awfully idiotic 2nd Final Destination with that laughable Ali Larter death sequence...here, there's a laughable sequence in which 2 prissy girls (played by Crystal Lowe and Chelan Simmons) who are in a tanning booth and a piece of wood gets stuck in between them.....which was reatarded at best. So, here goes the story, a girl named Wendy, played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead (The Ring Two, Sky High) has a premonition about the roller coaster that she is about to ride which goes crazy and everyone dies. Her and some other people get off the roller coaster and it suddenly happens. Kevin, played by Ryan Merriman (The Ring Two, Halloween: Resurrection) tells Wendy about a kid who 6 years ago foresaw a plane blowing up and everyone started to die afterwards. Wendy doesnt believe him until she actually sees it. So, Wendy and Kevin go around trying to warn everyone who was on the roller coaster and eventually they all die one by one. Horrible to put it to you clear, will serve up something for the people who love to see teenagers kick the bucket in different ways. Best line in the movie: "FU Ben Franklin" but besides that, it's slightly better then the second one but it is still a bad movie. Also starring Kris Lemche (Knockaround Guys, Ginger Snaps), Alexz Johnson (Selling Innocence, Reefer Madness: The Movie Musical), Texas Battle (One Tree Hill, Coach Carter), Sam Easton (The Butterfly Effect, Underclassman) and Amanda Crew (Smallville, 15/Love). They played "Roller Coaster" and " Love Train".....wow! Leaves it open for another....if so, I aint seeing it.</p></br><a href="../users/AIIR8E34EDKCQ.html">AIIR8E34EDKCQ</a><br/><p>Being a big fan of the previous Final Destination movies I knew I would love this one as long as it stuck to the formula. Not only did this movie accomplish the task, it left me squeezing my boyfriends arm a few times too many, a good sign that the disturbing scary horror parts did their job! I liked al the new characters introduced, a class of McKinnley high school seniors celebrating end of their schooling with a wild night at the amusement park. The whole movie does not take the place in the park, only the beginning, the place of unspeakable horrors and lot's of bloody bodies.<br /><br />Mary Elizabeth Winstead in head role as Wendy Christensen was a new face to me but a joy to watch on the screen. She had a really disturbing premonition of the roller coaster ride breaking, and while everything happened as she imagined, the remaining people who thought they were lucky had no idea what horrible things would await them. I was shocked at the gruesome death scenes perfectly set up in a cat and mouse style of a game. It reminded me of those old fashioned Dominoes games I would play, arranging the pattern on the floor for hours, then at one push one thing led to another and the whole design pushed forward slumped in a mess. That's how death worked in this movie, one misplaced object would leak onto another, push a cart then a bottle toppled over, wetting a heater which in then increased the temperature in a tanning booth while two saved girls tanned in. A coat hanger tripped by an air fan showed the bookshelf on top of the booth locking them in, that is how this movie happens. There are no bad guys, no monsters , no ghosts, just that evil draft  and unfortunate coincidences that somehow brought boys and girls to bloody pulp. All of the death scenes were amazing, as much as disturbing, they were really shown in full detail, as I had no idea this movie was going to be that hair raising. The rollercoaster scene itself was incredible, totally disgusting and something I will love to see again.<br /><br />The best, well the most disgusting death scene was with the nail gun, you guys who have seen it know what I am talking about, I was shocked yet at the same time I was really impressed at the effects and the poor actors. Overall a great fun movie, a blast to watch and really gory but interesting enough when you care for the characters.<br /><br />I loved trying to figure out with them how to cheat death and seeing their failed attempts and small successes lead somewhere. I hope more parts will come out, as I can never get bored of this theme!<br /><br />- Kasia S.</p></br><a href="../users/AZSN1TO0JI87B.html">AZSN1TO0JI87B</a><br/><p>It's tough to come up with a premise for a horror movie that hasn't already been done (or done to death), but the creators of the original "Final Destination," Glen Morgan and James Wong, sure had no problem back in 2000. Now, returning to the franchise they created, the respective writer and director return (after being absent for "Final Destination 2") with an all-new, exciting and invigorating sequel. Starring Ryan Merriman ("Halloween: Resurrection"), Mary Elizabeth Winstead ("The Ring 2"), two plastic bimbos who look too old to be high schoolers, and someone named Texas Battle (?), "Final Destination 3" is a lot like it's predecessors; this one isn't shy when it comes to gore and innovative and wild death scenes.<br /><br />Hate to make the comparison, but "Final Destination 3" is a lot like a rollercoaster ride. It has it's ups and downs, yet totally unpredictable. Although this movie obviously feels like a retread (kinda hard to stretch this premise to far), there are still a few elements to keep this movie feeling fresh. For starters, James Wong's directing here is a bit more stylish than it was in the original, and some of the death scenes are just as, if not, more, clever and creepy as those in the first two. This time, instead of an airplane or a car crash, our main character has hallucinations of a rollercoaster going off it's rails. After successfully getting half the people kicked off the ride, she can only watch in horror as the remaining victims plummet to their grisly deaths, as predicted. Also, as predicted, the characters wise up to "Death's Plan" and quickly try to find ways to avoid it. One angle that this film had that the other two lacked was a stalker that isn't supernatural. Not to ruin anything, but out of all of the events, a main character finds themselves being stalked by another. This was a cool addition to a tried and true storyline, but I just wish they would have taken it farther.<br /><br />If you enjoyed the first two movies, buckle up and enjoy. "Final Destination 3" definitely lives up to the legacy. Despite the fact that this franchise feels like it's running out of steam (and supposedly, this is the "Final" installment), the third movie delivers enough thrills to keep even the most discriminating horror junky happy. One thing is for sure, I'll definitely think twice next time I'm standing in line for a rollercoaster...</p></br><a href="../users/A1Q15TP2FXYYMF.html">A1Q15TP2FXYYMF</a><br/><p>I saw this film the day after its release and despite being extremely ill, I really enjoyed it.<br /><br />This time, the film looks at a group of teenagers enjoying graduation by going to a funfair. One of them is a photographer for the school paper and starts to notice strange things in the photographs she takes. (For instance the ride that said 'high die' instead of 'high dive') Her friends decide that they want to go on the rollercoaster and although the photographer isn't sure about it, she decides to go on it as well. I was so scared when the rollercoaster started to move. That part was really good because it definitely built up some tension and as soon as the rollercoaster went down the drop, things really started to get nasty. (In a good way though!)<br /><br />The death scenes in this film are incredibly gory. There nastier than the first film. (Again, in a good way!) My favourite death scene had to be the one of those two girls on the sunbeds as that part truly terrified me and had me on the edge of my seat. I also loved the ending too but i won't say anything about that 'cause I don't want to give too much away!<br /><br />"Final Destination 3" wasn't as good as the first film but its still great and all fans of horror and gore should get it!</p></br><a href="../users/A3I69IXPTDVKQF.html">A3I69IXPTDVKQF</a><br/><p>Final Destination 3 heads away from the first two movies in the series (which were linked by having some common characters) and brings in a brand new batch of players who escape death due to an uncanny premonition by one of their group, this time a high school student named Wendy (played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead, one of my personal favorites), only to have death seemingly come after them, as the survivors again begin dying in a series of bizarre freak accidents.  The connection to the previous movies is basically established by some internet research undetaken by Wendy after the deaths begin, which uncovers a history of similar phenomenon - groups of people who avoid death thanks to a premonition, only to all die shortly afterwards, usually under weird circumstances.<br /><br />  This time the 'cause of death' which claims a number of lives isn't a plane crash or a multi-car pile-up on the highway, but an accident on an amusement park roller coaster ride.  The Final Destination series has become famous for some really spectacular sequences involving the various accidents and/or death's attempts to reclaim its victims, and the roller coaster scenario certainly sets the stage for a continuation of this theme.  As a note of interest, an additional possible link to previous films comes in the form of the 'voice of the devil' at the entrance to one of the amusement park rides: the voice is that of Tony Todd, who also played the undertaker Mr. Bludworth in the first two Final Destination films, the eerie guy who seems to know too much about this whole phenomenon.  Whether this was just a neat bit of casting or whether there's an actual connection to the voice and the Bludworth character is in the same class as all the questions about Bludworth that were in the subtext of the previous movies.  It's there waiting to be explored further, should they choose to do so in a future movie.<br /><br />  In the first Final Destination, the group who survived were members of a high school class who all knew each other but didn't necesarily get along, and they grew closer as they faced the death phenomenon.  In Final Destination 2 it was mostly strangers, mostly likable characters, who quickly knit into a cohesive group.  In this chapter the survivors mostly know each other peripherally, but in contrast to the first two movies, the group grows increasingly at odds and in some cases hostile as events escalate.  After noticing that the deaths happen in the same order that they would have if the premonition hadn't changed things, one character even comes up with the idea that maybe most of the deaths - including his own - could be avoided if they just knocked off the last person on the list first.  So the pursuit of the death phenomenon itself isn't necessarily the only threat this time around.  The acting, as usual in the series is well done; Amanda Crew from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0027P9S0Y">The Haunting in Connecticut (Unrated Special Edition)</a>, another of my personal favorites, is also in it as Wendy's younger (by a year) sister Julie.  The special effects are fantastic.<br /><br />  The DVD version of Final Destination 3 makes use of a unique 'Choose Your Fate' option, where the viewer will periodically make decisions for the characters using the remote, some of which actually change the movie.  Very cool feature that I'm surprised hasn't been used a bit more often; it would lose its appeal if used too often, but if used for the right movie every now and then, I think it would be good.  It certainly seems more appealing to me than all the next-generation special features for Blu-Ray, like watching the movie and watching the 'making of' at the same time in separate boxes.<br /><br />  The third chapter of the Final Destination series doesn't re-invent the wheel of the series, it just uses that existing wheel to extremely good effect and gives it some extra twists and turns.  One of the best installments in a great series, and the 'Choose Your Fate' option is an extra bonus, especially for repeat viewing.</p></br><a href="../users/A2A6NH6DPE0VXR.html">A2A6NH6DPE0VXR</a><br/><p>Sequels were originally planned with Devon Sawyer having a vision in each one and I didn't mind that idea since I thought he wasn't that bad in the first one. Since they couldn't get him to come back they just made part 2 about someone else having a vision and death following those who survived a big highway wreck because of her. Then part 3 it has someone else having a vision of a big rollarcoaster accident. Then death follows whoever survived killing them in the order they would've in the accident. With the person who had the vision spending most of it figuring out who will die next.<br /><br />  The stories are all pretty much the same but the writer has to be creative  with who will die and how. The death scenes are creative and bloody and the film is about as well made as the first. Part 2 was a little too hateful, gross and disturbing for me. It's cool that you can control the fate of the survivors on the dvd even if the outcome is pretty much the same in the end. Still I wouldn't mind the feature in more horror dvds. It would've been cool having that fetaure with a Scream movie. It adds more to the film being able to watch it this way . Although once you do it once I doubt you'll do it again and again.</p></br><a href="../users/A34VV92TSLC37R.html">A34VV92TSLC37R</a><br/><p>I love the first two Final Destination movies.  It was an original idea, and it was executed extremely well.  The car crash sequence in Final Destination 2 is one of the best I've ever seen on film.  Number 2 was also great because of its ridiculously elaborate ways to kill characters.  And the gore was some of the best in recent horror to top it all off.  The  first movie was more about plot and characters, but still had some intense moments and good kills.<br /><br />Needless to say, I was excited to see the third entry in what I am hoping becomes a franchise the likes of Friday the 13th or Freddy (I'm talking number of movies here, not quality-wise).  Normally I don't let myself get too excited for a movie, because I am always let down.  Well that's what happened here.  I got myself all pumped up and excited, then as the movie progressed, it just didn't do anything for me.  There were a couple moments where I was like "that was cool," but nothing that made my jaw drop like in the second film.<br /><br />You all know the premise.  Main character has premonition of horrible death sequence (a roller coaster crash in this case), and gets people off of the ride and saves their lives.  However, Death then comes calling, in the order of how they would have died in the original incident, all the survivors start being knocked off in inconceivable, horrendous ways.  The roller coaster sequence was pretty cool, but the movie was basically downhill after that.  I got to the point where I was just counting down the minutes until the next death scene.  In the previous two, I was at least interested enough to pay attention to what the characters were saying, but at this point, how to avoid your death has been rehashed three times, and I think that's plenty.  If they are planning on making another one of these films, I suggest a new perspective on the story, because even I, a fan of the series, felt a litte tired of it after leaving the theater.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ01Q3070LT29.html">AQ01Q3070LT29</a><br/><p>It began with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YHE9J2">Final Destination (2000)</a> (2000) and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JLZK">Final Destination 2</a> (2003).<br /> Tony Todd who appeared in the two previous movies is the voice of the devil in this one.<br />  Now to present...Final Destination 3.

Some were graphic, some were gross, some silly and some intense. The death scenes in the 3rd installment were more of a quick surprise, they would suddenly come out of nowhere, and I won't lie to ya, a couple of 'em made me jump, then say "damn that was cool" So, ya got bland acting, sensational death effects, and a incredible rollercoaster scene. Put reality and common sense away for 95 minutes and have some cheesy fun!!</p></br><a href="../users/A25ZVI6RH1KA5L.html">A25ZVI6RH1KA5L</a><br/><p>Interesting characters, an engaging story, and bizarre, intricately orchestrated death scenes...these were the three main elements I took away from the original Final Destination (2000)...after watching Final Destination 3 (2006) last night, it seems only one of the three elements I mentioned made it to the third installment (I'll give you a hint...it wasn't the interesting characters or engaging story).  Co-written and directed by James Wong ("The X Files", Final Destination, The One), the film stars Mary Elizabeth Winstead (The Ring Two, Sky High) and Ryan Merriman (Halloween: Resurrection, The Ring Two).  Also appearing is Amanda Crew (She's the Man), who looks a heck of a lot like the singer Tiffany, Kris Lemche (Ginger Snaps), Sam Easton (Underclassman), Alexz Johnson ("Instant Star"), Jesse Moss ("Whistler"), Gina Holden (The Butterfly Effect 2), Chelan Simmons (Dr. Dolittle 3), Crystal Lowe (Scary Movie 4), and Texas Battle (Coach Carter), which is about one of the goofiest names I've heard in awhile, but whatever...<br /><br />As the film begins we see a group of seniors from McKinley High at an amusement park and we end up focusing on two couples, Wendy `Wen' Christensen (Winstead), Jason `J' Wise (Moss), Kevin Fischer (Merriman), and Carrie Dreyer (Holden).  Eventually the foursome head towards the mammoth roller coaster called Satan's Armpit (or something like that), but Wendy, who's on the yearbook committee and has been snapping pictures all night long (this is a key aspect later on) gets a bad feeling...if you've seen the previous two films then you'll probably guess she's got `the sight', in that she gets an ookie feeling when bad things are about to happen.  Anyway, if you've seen the first film, picture in place of a plane a roller coaster, as disaster strikes taking a handful of teens (Wendy had a serious freak out while sitting in the coaster, eventually leading to a number of teens not taking the ride of death).  Okay, so if I've learned anything from the previous two films it's that you cannot cheat death, and sure enough those who got off the coaster begin getting picked off in particularly horrible ways...emollition, decapitation, electrocution, impalement, and so on...and guess what?  Not only does Wendy have an idea of who's next to go, but she also has clues to how they're going to die, said clues found in the very photos she took the night of the disaster.  All she has to do now is convince those who are next on death's hit list before they bite it, which is kind of difficult given few, if any, truly believe her, at least until it's too late...<br /><br />I signed on for this ride with my main expectation being to see a lot of really nasty, violent death sequences, as found in the previous films, and I wasn't disappointed in that aspect.  The biggest problems I had with the film was both the actual story and characters seemed flat and relatively uninteresting.  The most interesting character for me also happened to be the sleaziest, one named Frankie Cheeks (Easton), the socially retarded creepy guy who graduated a couple of years earlier but still hangs out at high school functions hoping to score with some underage babes who might be dense enough to fall for his game (every class had someone like this).  As far as the rest of the characters, I honestly didn't care for any of them one way or another, and saw them as nothing but fodder for the meat grinder...there really wasn't any performances that stuck out, but there are some pretty comical lines thrown about, one in particular that featured Wendy and Kevin.  Kevin didn't want to see his actual `death picture', but he did ask Wendy for some sort of confirmation that it didn't involve him going out in an embarrassing way, with something getting rammed up his rear portal.  If I had to pick the most painful death sequence from the film I think I'd have to go with the one connected to the sun tanning beds, only because it was the most drawn out, the with nail gun incident at the hardware store a close second.  As far as the rest, I won't go into detail, but they are gruesome and visceral, and usually occur as the result of a lengthy build up.  Perhaps this is where the most fun is, as while you're watching events unfold, you're trying to figure out where it's all leading to in terms of how the person involved is going to get it...I learned a number of things from this film, including the following...<br /><br />1. When the roller coaster you're riding on starts emitting showers of sparks, that's a sure sign something is wrong.<br /><br />2. Wheels are an essential part to a roller coaster operating properly.<br /><br />3. Roller coasters apparently don't have any sensors to detect the loss of hydraulics, causing the ride to shut down automatically as a safety feature.<br /><br />4. The Grim Reaper seems partial to deaths caused by massive head injuries, particularly in those whom escaped his grasp through the intervention of another.<br /><br />5. High school girls sure like to show their mid-drifts.<br /><br />6. Those bubble headed bimbos sure were dumb, but they had some nice mams.<br /><br />7. Never frequent a tanning salon operated by a Russian guy as if something goes wrong, he won't be around, having accidentally locked himself of the building by gabbing with his girlfriend on his cell phone.<br /><br />8. Loose shelving, Big Gulps, and tanning beds don't mix.<br /><br />9. Nail guns are effective against pigeons (and people).<br /><br />10. The Grim Reaper is vindictive as hell, especially towards those whom escaped his grasp through the intervention of another, so much so he creates exceptionally elaborate Rube Goldberg-esque scenarios that result in hideous deaths.<br /><br />11. Lockers rooms are very dangerous places, especially those occupied by jocks soaked with testosterone (and most likely steroids).<br /><br />12. Goth couples have cutesy nicknames for each other, like Zip and Pip (blech).<br /><br />13. Anytime the wind blows, the lights dim, and the radio in your car goes nutty, that's a sure sign someone is going to die horribly.<br /><br />14. Good luck charms ain't worth diddly spit when death comes a callin'.<br /><br />15. You can't cheat death, but you can really tick him off.<br /><br />As I said, there isn't much in the way of story or characters, but if you dig on bizarre, visceral death sequences, then you enjoy this film.  Also, Wong does keep things moving along well as the hour and a half run time went by very quickly.  All in all a whole lot of flash (and blood), but not much substance...was I expecting more?  Not really, but it would have been nice, especially with Wong, who was behind the original Final Destination, at the helm.<br /><br />I won't bother mentioning all the extras included on this two disc DVD release as the Amazon site does that well enough, but I will say the picture, presented in widescreen (2.35:1) anamorphic, and the audio, available in Dolby Digital 5.1 EX Surround, DTS-ES 6.1 Discrete, and Dolby Digital Surround, both come across immaculately.  Also, there's two versions of the film here...one being the standard, theatrical release, and a second that allows for some interaction in that at certain points in the film in that the viewer gets to make choices for the actors (resulting in them doing one of two actions), thereby altering the story slightly (maybe they die, maybe they don't...maybe they die a different way then originally depicted).<br /><br />Cookieman108</p></br><a href="../users/A3KJ6JAZPH382D.html">A3KJ6JAZPH382D</a><br/><p>Let's face it, roller coasters are one of those terrifying thrills that many of us have a attraction/aversion to on a primal kind of level. It makes the first 15 minutes of "Final Destination 3" truly scary in a white knuckle kind of horror way. It is easily the best thing about this movie, and the bonus disc shows just how much effort they put into making that tiny sequence as authentic as possible.<br /><br />Thus, when Wendy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) has her premonition and then starts divining clues from her digital pictures, the blueprint for the very determined force of death offing the survivors (ala the original <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0780631684">Final Destination</a>) is in place. FD3 does so with humor and verve (putting the infamous scream from The Ohio Players' "Love Rollercoaster" was a great touch) while devising increasing grisly and freakish ways to kill off the seven survivors. Trust me, you'll want to swear off tanning beds after this one.<br /><br />The bonus features are what help elevate this DVD to the 4th star. The "Choose Their Fate" option offers both alternative takes and some really funny bonus clips (Frankie Cheeks' in particular) and a cool documentary about the "Dead Teenager Movie," featuring Roger Ebert. For a thrill ride movie, it takes a good perspective on itself.</p></br><a href="../users/ATZ1LTONGHOP6.html">ATZ1LTONGHOP6</a><br/><p>In my opinion, the original "Final Destination" was one of the best horror films to surface in the wave of post-"Scream" horror films that emerged in the late 1990's. The idea of a group of teenagers "cheating death" and then having "death" come back to collect them was a great one and with all of the elaborate death sequences, it was extremely well executed (excuse the pun) too. Evidently, I wasn't the only person out there who thought this, because "Final Destination 3" is essentially just a remake of the first "Final Destination" and why would you remake something if the idea didn't have merit to begin with? Of course, since "Final Destination 3" is just a remake, why bother to watch it at all; why not just re-watch "Final Destination"? The answer to that question depends on why you liked the first film to begin with.<br /><br />If you are looking for originality of plot, then don't bother with "Final Destination 3". It's not there. This film will just give you a 89 minute feeling of deja vu. However, if you want to see yet another series of gruesome and elaborate death sequences, then you've come to the right place. The death sequences in this instalment are even better than those in the previous two films, and in spite of myself, I found myself eagerly anticipating each new death. Guessing who would be the next victim and how they would die was fun and the 89 minutes of the film literally just vanished, I was so engrossed in it (something which I can't say about many films). I won't give away the details of any of the deaths, since that would spoil the fun, but if that's why you like this series, then you will definitely enjoy this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JH5J1KQAUBMP.html">A1JH5J1KQAUBMP</a><br/><p>This film follows in the proud tradition of its predecessors by delivering a number of satisfyingly gory deaths embedded in a plot that is just barely engaging enough to keep you from just fast forwarding to the next killing.  If you don't get any joy from watching the painful demise of numerous characters, there is no reason to watch this film.<br /><br />Although it accomplishes its mission, I can't help but be disappointed.  James Wong and Glen Morgan did some great work on TV.  They worked on "X-Files," including "Home," the single scariest episode of that (or any?) series ever made.  They seemed to pretty much take over for the second season of "Millennium," and they hit it out of the ballpark there.  The sci-fi series they created, "Space: Above and Beyond," got off to a slow start but was really picking up by the time it was cancelled.  If they could do such a good job on television, which requires them to work faster and be more prolific, why has their cinematic output been so underwhelming?  There's a mystery for you.</p></br><a href="../users/ANBQIWHO9JRFS.html">ANBQIWHO9JRFS</a><br/><p>Well, reviewing this is easy enough: If you saw and liked the first 2 'Final Destination' films, go see this one.  If not, don't.  That's about it, but I'll go on some more anyway.<br /><br />Major release horror movies are always bound to be a mixed bag, particularly because this kind of film leans towards theoretically fun horror movie rather than the, well, horrifying sort.  And this is definitely true of the 'Final Destination' films; it's hard to imagine anyone being terrified or disturbed by them provided they aren't a small child or a complete pansy.  I prefer serious horror films, generally, but this sorta thing can work too, and FD films are some of the best horror movies of this kind to come out in recent memory.  FD3 is certainly nothing more than reiteration, but the original ideas are amusing enough for another go round, and this one proves to probably be the best of the series.  (It's a tough call, though.  They're all in about the same range, quality-wise.)<br /><br />The premise is exactly the same as the previous two films:  A high schooler, Wendy, has a premonition of death just prior to riding on a roller coaster and flips out, causing herself and about half a dozen others to get off the ride.  The premonition, of course, comes true, and they're all spared.  But apparently Death isn't so pleased with this and proceeds to off them one by one in the order that they would've died during the accident all via bizarre, impossible coincidences and accidents, and  if you escape the trap Death passes you by and heads to the next person.  Wendy, as did the other FD protagonists, has premonitions of sorts regarding the impending deaths and, adding a new wrinkle to the plot, they also discover that the numerous pictures that they took prior to the roller coaster ride contain clues as to their future demises.  Thus, after the opening, the film is just a series of set pieces where they're killed via elaborate contraptions interspersed with scenes of them standing around and talking about how they're gonna die, and how that sucks and all.<br /><br />The film gets off to a somewhat slow start.  They probably spend too much time at the spooky carnival and the roller coaster crash itself proves to be fairly unimpressive.  A roller coaster disaster sounds good in theory, but I dunno how you're gonna actually shoot this effectively, and apparently Wong doesn't either.  It's okay as it is, but the disasters in the previous films were better, particularly the spectacularly over the top crash from FD2.<br /><br />Once it gets going it's better than ever before, however.  Wendy is probably the most likable protagonist in the series, though that's not much of a prize, and the most annoying characters are generally killed first.  Furthermore, they just generally spend less time standin' around and talking and more time gettin' killed.  The set pieces are the most consistently amusing and perhaps most elaborate ones yet in the series, though I won't discuss them too specifically as that would kinda ruin it.  (There's nothing quite as ridiculously amusing as the teacher death from 1 nor as great as the squishing from 2, but it's got wonderful consistency.)  The film is about as gory as mainstream horror gets, definitely on the level of FD2 if not higher and far surpassing the original. (Which sadly, had little gore to speak of.)  It's also got a few relatively original deaths, though I emphasize relatively, as there just isn't a whole lot more you can do to the human body that hasn't been done yet.  On top of the high gore quotient its also got probably the most painful, vicious deaths in the series, giving it a bit more visceral punch, though it's still a fairly light hearted affair, as far as horror films go. (Spoiler Alert: Particularly note the roasting via tanning beds and the chick receiving about half a dozen nails thru the back of the head from a disturbingly high powered nail gun. Ouch)<br /><br />Wong and Morgan wrote the film again, and it's got some of the old humorous touches from the original that didn't make it into the sequel, or weren't as affective and noticeable, anyway.  Overall, it's just a bit smarter and better written than 2, though that ain't exactly what you're looking for when you go to this sorta film.<br /><br />Sadly, Tony Todd (the Candyman) isn't back as the creepy mortician.  Sure, I thought his appearance in 2 was kinda silly and unnecessary, but once the pattern is established I figured they'd continue with it.  Too bad.  He is back, however, in a sufficiently appropriate role, I suppose.<br /><br />On a final, insignificant note, there's a scene where they look at a photo of the WTC supposedly just before 9/11 where there is a phantom shadow of an airplane on it.  (This is supposed to connect in with the idea that the photos can show how the deaths will occur.)  This is very amusing, as it will certainly offend plenty of whiny babies and it's surprising that they'd dare do this.  (I haven't the faintest idea why this would offend people, but I'm absolutely sure it will. If I really understood why something was offensive I'd be offended too.)  Anyway, good for them.  It's rare to see the film business not be cowardly, particularly for no good reason.<br /><br />Grade: B</p></br><a href="../users/A33CLVW2K7SL1P.html">A33CLVW2K7SL1P</a><br/><p>There isn't anything terribly clever - certainly nothing new - in Final Destination 3. It's a rehash of hash, so to speak, and should be approached accordingly.<br /><br />We all know the plot at this point, so repeating it here seems unnecessary. What you're probably looking for is whether you should watch it. Here's the guide: if you loved the first two Final Destination films and thought they were boffo clever, then you'll like this. If you're curious to see what the fuss is about (they did make three films, after all), don't bother with this one. See the first (also directed by James Wong). It was better.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDZNPO7U4E6N.html">A1CDZNPO7U4E6N</a><br/><p>It never fails. If you somehow manage to get through the first and second film it's always at this point in most franchises where it usually goes down in flames. They manage to flush all the ideas that made the first 2 films so good right down the toilet. Personally, I'm stil confused as hell about the ending. The first 2 films had new and interesting concepts, but this whole rollercoaster thing was dumb. I wonder who do we have to thank for that horrible idea. Is that the best they could come up with? A rollercoaster? On top of that, the first 2 films found a way to tie in together, and in my opinion, that's very important. I hate it when they have sequels with no continuity, and sequels that have absolutely nothing to do with the 1st 2 movies. I think American filmakers need to follow a few tips from a moviegoer that has seen her fair share of movies.<br /><br />#1-To make a good plot...the story must first be INTERESTING!<br /><br />#2-You can't keep sticking to the same scare tactics. What creeped me out last time won't work the 2nd time around. It's just not as effective.<br /><br />#3-Don't ignore the previous films in the franchise. I don't care if it's part 3, 30, or 300. The viewers haven't forgotten what they've seen, and we can't be fooled. So, the movie needs to make sense.<br /><br />#4-If you're gonna branch off and tell another whole story let the movie stand on it's own. Don't call it the same as it's predecessors.<br /><br />#5-Quit using blood and gore as a replacement for originality, plot, and storyline.<br /><br />I think that if they would've reversed it and made the ending on the train the beginning, and went from there it might have been better. Another thing, it was a whole lot creepier when they had to figure out the signs that death was about to strike. The signs weren't explained in a photograph. I have said this before, and I'll say it again. Whether they are American or Canadian filmakers the premise still remains the same, and they need to understand that you can't just rely on showing a whole bunch of gory, nasty, and bloody scenes to the audience everytime you run out of ideas, and you know the movie blows. I notice they tend to do that quite often these days. They replace the plot and storyline for blood and violence. That's not entertainment, that's a distraction, and it's plan-B just in case plan-A doesn't work. Distract us from the fact that the movie is so bad and show us a lot of scenes to gross us out instead. They know that our society is based on so much violence that's enough to satisfy a lot of people. However, I'm not so easily impressed. I truely think any real fan of the first 2 movies won't appreciate this one. 2 stars is really being way 2 kind.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VCPMT1RRS7K0.html">A1VCPMT1RRS7K0</a><br/><p>Following very faithfully in the tradition of the first two movies in the series, Final Destination 3 is a cross between a cheesy teen movie and a gory horror film. The opening scene is effective in the suspense and sense of dread leading to the tragic event that kicks off this round of "cheating death". I don't particularly enjoy roller coasters myself, so this scene was rather disturbing, but it was done well.<br /><br />There are some nasty death scenes in this movie. I mean, it's nothing like a movie such as "Hostel", but the gratuitousness of the deaths almost don't seem to fit into what would otherwise remind you of a movie like "Clueless". They are creative, though. You are warned that something nasty is about to happen by the tone of the scene, yet you may still not be quite ready for it when it happens.<br /><br />The acting is better than I would have expected. I doubt any awards will be handed out for these performances, but I'm sure that wasn't the intention, anyway. I must say that I enjoyed this movie more than I was expecting to and I would recommend it.</p></br><a href="../users/A329U9CDUPKXAC.html">A329U9CDUPKXAC</a><br/><p>It wasn't a bad movie. It just wasn't near as good as the previous two. I didn't really care about any of the characters. The death scenes were actually kind of funny. But they also weren't all that imaginative either. I love the first two films because the ways people died was just so cool. In this one they find new ways to smash people's heads.</p></br><a href="../users/A3RMAWK4ELOLRZ.html">A3RMAWK4ELOLRZ</a><br/><p>On a rollercoaster at a fair, Wendy Christensen has a premonition of a rollercoaster accident.

The 7 people who got off the ride die one by one in mysterious ways throughout the movie.  Two girls (I don't remember their names) both die while in tanning beds.  They burn to death.  One guy gets his head smashed while at the gym.  The deaths are fake.

This time, we get a horrific roller-coaster disaster, predicted by the lovely Mary Elizabeth Winstead. Of course, the real fun begins when Death starts reaping the souls of those who have "escaped" their untimely demise. FD3 works in the same way as the first two installments, by preying on our fear of death and the supernatural / unknown. I mean, surviving a catastrophe is supposed to be a "miracle", not a reason for further dread and terror! I get a kick out of these films and the way Death uses the machinery of everyday life in order to orchestrate our doom. The tanning-bed sequence is my favorite "accident" in this one!

Your average horror fan gets a thrill from the films because they are a sort of spice for life, they are the seasoning that makes the mundane parts of life all the more richer.  Watch a bunch of people get sliced and diced by a monster or madman, and that adrenaline rush makes you feel as if, on some level, you yourself have cheated death.  For awhile or more, it's nice to be alive.<br /><br />The FINAL DESTINATION films utilize the same premise, but instead of creating a defeatable or relatable villain, it makes the very act of dying the villain.  Watching the movies, it's very much like they decided that the force of Death, after a millenia of ending lives, has grown bored and has decided to put some spice into his job.  In all of the movies, Death awards a young soul with a premonition of a huge catastrophe, and when that soul saves him/herself (along with a handful of others), Death gleefully sets up cat-and-mouse games with the survivors and watches as they scream and skitter.  The question is never Will They Die?  It is How Long Can They Hold Out?<br /><br />Because everyone dies, sooner or later, and it's rarely at the hands of a zombie or a Leatherface.  Car accidents are far more common.  Fires.  Mechanical failures.  The FD films make Death a snarky, sadistic force without ever showing his face.  Instead, Death operates basically through three cards -- wind, gravity, and passive human interference -- and with these three things, he orchestrates the deaths of dozens and dozens of characters.  These films are filled with pointless scenes of people screaming that they're in control of their lives, scoffing at the idea that Death lurks everywhere.  Then they die.<br /><br />The real fun in these films lies in the complex machinations that Death sets in motion with the leak of a pipe or the flutter of a bird.  If you're expecting interesting plots, complex characters, or realistic dialogue, prepare to be HEAVILY disappointed.  In fact, these elements of the films get steadily more and more wooden and cartoonish, until by the fourth installment, they are laughably bad.  The makers know that what you're really waiting for is to watch Death do his thing, investing everything from quarters to fishsticks with a sinister menace.  To that end, I have provided here a summary of the only thing about each of these films that is worth watching: the death scenes.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0780631684">Final Destination (New Line Platinum Series)</a>:<br />In the first film, Death's premonition is visited upon a young student on a plane.  The ensuing plane accident (5/5) gave me nightmares for a week.  When the student leaves the plane along with others, he then experiences more premonitions (most of them cheesy reflections in windows) indicating that Death is now hunting them down.  Of all the movies, this one features the most personified version of Death.  A dark mist accompanies each death, and you can even see Death pursuing some characters, especially in a tense bathroom scene (4/5).  Some of the deaths feature complex sequences of domino-like chains (there is a catastrophic house fire (4/5) and a menacing electrical storm (4/5)).  Others are less creative (the bus and train accidents are both unimaginative throwaways (2/5)).  The final death (by sign) is a cheeky nod at the movie's premise (4/5).  Notable in this film: Death has a soundtrack, which turns out to feature, over and over again, "Leaving on a Jet Plane."<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JLZK">Final Destination 2</a>:<br />Death isn't so hung up on music this time around, but that's okay because he's a bit more creative.  This film's opening highway accident is by far the best beginning out of any of these films (5/5), and when the storyline later ties the survivor's lives to the events of the first film, it's actually interestingly done.  Not as interesting as the deaths, though.  You've got a tongue-in-cheek apartment fire (4/5), a crushing visit to the dentist (4/5), and an unusually persistent elevator (3/5).  In one case, the jaws of life have the opposite function (4/5), and in another case a flying fence executes a mortal ballet (5/5).  There are also three explosive deaths that are a little cheap (2/5).  The characters this time around all get premonitions (again, mostly just false reflections in windows), and they spend a lot of pointless time trying to cheat Death's plan (their ideas mostly centering around a "new life").  The final scene, just as in the first film, is an over-the-top nyuck-nyuck moment.  "It's all in fun," Death seems to be saying.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FC2HS6">Final Destination 3</a>:<br />This time around it's a roller coaster catastrophe (4/5).  The movie has a creative idea by putting the premonitions into poorly shot yearbook photos, and Death continues to get up in people's faces with ominous/ironic songs and smug little omens (before one death, characters at a drive-in watch as the word "control" disappears from the digital menu).  The first "catch-up" death in a tanning salon is perhaps the best of the film (5/5), although there's a nicely intricate set-up later in the film that involves a nail-gun (5/5).  A runaway truck and horse and a falling sign constitute some of the film's weaker executions (2/5, 3/5, and 2/5, respectively).  Elsewhere in the film, the movie's token "I'm Gonna Live Forever!" character battles death in a weight room (4/5).  The movie concludes with an intense subway scene that is kinda cool, but also sort of a rip off as far as endings go. (4/5)<br /><br />The Final Destination [Theatrical Release]:<br />The opener here is the weakest of the franchise.  It takes place at a racing track, and so all of the subtle connections and coincidences get lost in the sprawling chaos of the catastrophe (3/5).  The premonitions this time around are ridiculously aggressive hallucinations, and they forecast some rather uncreative demises.  One man is murdered by a tow truck in a way that almost makes sense (1/5).  Another character bites it at a hair salon in a rather unsatisfying fashion (2/5).  There's a clever little two-fer where two characters simultaneously battle watery deaths, although both are almost too cartoonish to be all that scary (4/5 - car wash; 3/5 - swimming pool).  The movie's real saving grace (aside from the 3D, which does its job without much fuss) is it's final theater/mall debacle, which is witty, self-referential, and fairly intense (5/5).  The close of the movie (and, ostensibly, the franchise) is an unceremonious vehicular accident that is only notable for the X-ray vision it is finally shot in.</p></br><a href="../users/A1C0PHJN6AUZT6.html">A1C0PHJN6AUZT6</a><br/><p>It's very unusual that I would like a third in the series the best, but I really do! I love the opening amusement park setting, I can always get the creeps there and so many bad things that can happen in one, it makes perfect sense to start a thiller in one. The funny the is, the characters are the least likable ones, not on in the FD series, but in almost any movie. They were just really broad stereotypes of some diffrent teens about to graduate. You know, snotty girls, jocks, emos, etc. I swear you almost cheer for them to get killed, and wow do they get killed in cool and new ways! I really loved the ending, it's how it should be considering the first 2 movies. I also like the interactive features, and some of the stuff on the other disk. If you like these movies for the orignal death scenes, not character development, you'll enjoy this entry.</p></br><a href="../users/A1T17LMQABMBN5.html">A1T17LMQABMBN5</a><br/><p>Okay, let me say that whoever watches this film and is shocked that it isn't well written or well acted... You are not getting Citizen Kane here folks!  You get what you're being offered, and this is a teen slasher flick.  They are my guilty pleasure, and I enjoyed watching the first two movies and had a blast with this one as well.  This is a good standalone from the first two flicks, which means that you can watch it even if you hadn't given the first two a whirl (though I recommend that you do).  For those who watched Final Destination 1 and 2 are familiar with the plot: kids are headed for a ride (plane, car, this time a rollercoaster), one of them gets a premonition and he/she, along with several others, gets out just in time.  But then the ones who got off their bloody fates begin to die in mysterious and graphic ways in the order in which they would have died in the premonition.  It is up to the protagonist to stop the deaths, or at least try to save herself/himself before it's his or her turn.<br /><br />The third part of the trilogy features high school seniors about to graduate.  Wendy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) gets signs and a clear as day premonition of what would happen if she gets on the rather sinister-looking rollercoaster.  Well, everything else is pretty predictable, for the plot doesn't change from the first two films.  The actors are all young and attractive.  They're not the best actors in the world, but I haven't seen very many horror flicks with Oscar-caliber performances.  The fun of this film is watching how the characters die.  There is a lot of decapitations in this one, that's for sure!  They are less creative or surprising than in the first two Final Destinations, but, as said earlier, you already pretty much know what to expect.  The thing I like about this one is that Wendy (Winstead) looks genuinely distressed and spooked during the death scenes.  Also, the screen writer, editor and director are smart enough to let time pass in between deaths so that the characters adjust to what they had seen and experienced.  I hated the detached way in which the characters in the earlier movies reacted when someone died right in front of them, as if to say, "Eeww, gross!  Okay, who's next?"  So unrealistic!  Speaking of unrealistic, why does the protagonist get a premonition if he/she and the others are meant to die that day?  Did they possess these powers BEFORE the horrible occurrence?  Is the Grim Reaper a sadist who wants to play a game of cat and mouse?  Total suspension of disbelief, like in all of these flicks, is necessary.  Then again, this is a teen horror flick.  Since when do these movies make sense?  I mean, Jason from Friday the 13th died when he was a kid, and then he reemerges a grown man with a hockey mask and an insatiable bloodlust. So... just watch and enjoy! (Okay, I could have done without the gratuitous topless scene at the tanning salon, but I bet the men loved THAT!)<br /><br />The DVD is good.  The widescreen edition (2:35 format) is better than the previous films, which had a 1:85 format.  I also liked the features.  The choose the fates and deaths thing is a good addition for die-hard fans.  I would recommend buying the set that includes all three movies if you don't already have them.  They are more of a bargain when bought together.  Plus you'll get to have a good time with your friends -- watching three movies while admitting that you actually enjoy this kind of stuff. Recommended for fun and entertainment.</p></br><a href="../users/A1COW0UIB5HA9J.html">A1COW0UIB5HA9J</a><br/><p>One night at the graduation part at a local amusement park, Wendy (Mary-Elizabeth Winstead) and her friends are having a great time until they decide to go on this roller-coaster ride. Wendy secretly has a special gift, she can predict what bad things can come especially a horrific vision of themselves dying on a roller-coaster ride accident but after that vision she warns her friends not to go on it as they follow her advice then it really starts happening. After that ordeal, her friend Kevin (Ryan Merriman) belives in her and must try to find some clues on pictures she took at the carnival as she believes death is coming for her friends and must save them or else deah himself will preveal.<br /><br />Easily the weakest of the three FD movies but there is some suprisingly and ghastly moments of gory accidents such as for example the head crushing sequence in the gym which will remind you of that one from "The Toxic Avenger" and one sequence that will make you never wanna go to the tanning booth again. There are some cute girls in this movie even though they maybe slaughtered by the grim reaper himself, James Wong (creator of the series) returns as director and producer. It's not as good as the first two movies but it does have some cool and violent moments with some sexy girls, it's worth watching if your into horror and gore.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray both the theatrical version and a way cool "Choose their fate" version where during the movie on some scenes you can change the course of the film with alternate scenes and the character's fate. The extras includie a documentary, a feature about the "Dead Teen" subgenre, audio commentary, Trailers, TV Spots, an animated short, Extended Police Station sequence, and "Planned Accidents: a look on the set of FD3". The Picture is very decent and the sound is good but not great as it sounds the same as the DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/A2582KMXLK2P06.html">A2582KMXLK2P06</a><br/><p>I am a big fan of horror films, especially ones that really make you think about death.  Final Destination 3 mainly focuses on death, and the story is about predicting when and how someone is going to die.<br /><br />This movie was exceptionally worthwhile for the violence and blood.  The way the plot works is that each of the characters (all teenagers) are supposed to die in a certain order, and it's up to one of the girls (along with a teenage boy) to try and figure out a way to stop it from happening.  They try connecting clues from the pictures they took at a carnival, and this all adds up to a lot of careful creativity on the part of the writers.<br /><br />This means the boy and the girl will frequently find themselves in a situation where something doesn't feel right, and then they will remember something similar from a picture they took at the carnival.  When they realize that something from a picture happens to be right there in front of them at the moment, death begins to turn its ugly head in their direction and they have to try and escape with their lives.<br /><br />Let me try to make some sense of this by using an example: in one instance the girl remembers a picture she took of her male friends face up against the camera, squinting and fooling around.  This picture predicted that the boy would actually be squinting for real because of a dangerous situation he would soon encounter.  This is how the story works.<br /><br />The film also does a good job building suspense when a death is about to happen, because sometimes you can tell a death is just around the corner, however, the writers of the film must have really great brains because a LOT of creativity went into the way the characters in the film died.<br /><br />I'd say the feel of the movie was similar to that of I Know What You Did Last Summer (teenagers that die one by one) but the actual horror plotline was more interesting and violent overall in Final Destination 3.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RKI7RPP5CJMG.html">A2RKI7RPP5CJMG</a><br/><p>I really enjoyed the first two "Final Destination" flicks.  The original was exactly that--original.  Having Death go after those who cheated him was a very good idea.  The second film, bringing back Ali Larter and (in a minor role) Tony Todd, managed to keep my attention very well.  The kills were a bit more extravagant and the pacing was excellent.<br /><br />With "Final Destination 3," however, this rollercoaster has lost some steam.  Granted, the kills in this film were just as fun and intricately built as in the other two films, but it lacked characters that you could actually pull for.  Wendy, played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead, is the closest to an actual hero that the viewer would have any emotion for.<br /><br />The rest of the characters, played by remotely recognizable Ryan Merriman, Kris Lemche, a dude who's actually named Texas Battle, goth-girl wannabe Alexz Johnson (the "x" at the end of her name makes her cool) and a slew of other unknowns, do a decent job of standing around looking brooding, hot, athletic, or whatever else their stereotyped character is supposed to be.<br /><br />In case you're wondering about the plot, it's the same as the other two flicks.  Wendy has a premonition about a rollercoaster ride going insanely bad and her actions cause a few other people to miss the ride.  Death then goes after them, killing them off in the order they would have died on the coaster.  The rest of the story is spent showing us how gory and intricate the deaths can become.<br /><br />Something was missing here.  Perhaps it's just the fact that this is the third installment of the series and it's become boring.  Maybe it was the lack of a character you'd want to see actually survive to the end.  I don't know, but I have to say that despite the film's being boring, it moved at an excellent pace.  I was forty-five minutes into the film before I stopped to check how much time was left to the film.<br /><br />The DVD has quite a few nice extras, including the standard "making of" documentaries, an animated short, a look at teen thrillers, and a neat feature called "Choose Their Fate," which allows the viewer to pick one of two options to see either a different way of a character getting offed or, in a couple of cases, the characters actually survive.<br /><br />Overall, I'd consider this a good rental, but I would only buy it if I already own the other two flicks and needed it for a complete set.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ.html">A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ</a><br/><p>So, let's see. What have we gotten so far?. An airplane incident. Car/Highway incident. And now a rollercoaster. We should expect part 4 to come along real soon with a train. I am a fan of these films and enjoy them a lot. I thought the original film was a smart, different, and entertaining film amid the sly slasher films that were the norm. The sequel was bigger with the deaths and gore, but not as good. Now the original team that brought us the first film, have brought us the third. This one is better than the second installment. This time around, a group of graduating high schoolers are at a carnival, where a number of them get on board a scary looking rollercoaster. Like others before her, Wendy(Mary Elizabeth Winstead)has a vision that the ride will go horribly wrong and people will die. Soon enough, her vision comes true. A handful of students are thrown off the ride, and now death is looking for them. Like in the previous two, this one follows the same formula. The bunch that got thrown off are now dying one by one. Death is coming to collect those that got away. This one isn't too packed with heroes and heroines trying to figure out "death's design" as the previous ones, and just goes straight ahead with gruesome deaths and trying to get the victims in time. Our heroes do follow pictures that were taken at the rides to help them know how one is going to buy the farm. The only thing people go to these films for are the murders. The second film uped the ante from the first, and this one follows suit. There is no disappointment here concerning creative kills or gore. It's there in all it's glory. I never felt "death" hanging around as much as in the first one. These deaths just seem to happen. As for the characters, they are the usual lot. The good girl, the nice jock, the beautiful twits, the outsiders, etc. None of them have any distinction, but none of them are bad either. The movie is sharply made by James Wong, who can set up a scene and spine tingling moment with the best of them. The cast do what they can with their characters, but they weren't written with much else in mind but to be victims. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is a fine leading lady for this kind of thing, but after a while, she is just doom and gloom and is always looking dour. Seperated from the other two, Tony Todd does not appear. He does make his presence known tho. I won't tell you how or where. I'll let you try to spot him. The DVD is well packed with extra goodies, and the "Choose Their Fate" idea is a brilliant idea!. I wouldn't mind seeing this feature be a regular thing for certain films. Final Destination 3 is a fun popcorn/cotton candy movie designed to be as slick and tasty going down as those mentioned goodies, and just as empty.</p></br></body></html>

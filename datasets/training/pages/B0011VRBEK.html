The story is an unsettling tale of vengeance, murder, suicide, mutilation, sex, more mutilation, and incest.  The movie seems to focus on what human beings will do in the name of justice, and then twists darkly into an exploration of the ugly aspects of truth.<br /><br />The plot seems to be simple enough at the outset.  A drunken man is making a fool of himself at the police station, babbling incoherently about missing his daughter's birthday party.  Finally bailed out by his friend, the drunk is swiftly kidnapped off the street by forces unknown.<br /><br />And he is kept in prison for fifteen years.  15 years of one room, one TV, and a whole bunch of fried pot stickers.<br /><br />And then, he is freed.  He does not know why.  He does not know who did this to him.  He just knows that he must find seek vengeance.<br /><br />Virtuoso filmmaking elevates this story - one that has a pretty high body count but gets a lot more "mileage" out of its torture scenes (and there are quite a few) than the killings.  Indeed, the most disturbing death scene involves the live octopus famously consumed at dinner.  This is movie where several body parts are sliced off, penetrated, or pried out of their natural locations, and "Oldboy" shows none of Quentin Tarantino's restraint - remember when Mr. Blonde cuts off the cop's ear off-screen in "Reservoir Dogs"?  Very little happens off-screen in "Oldboy."<br /><br />"Oldboy" is one of those dark, ultraviolent films that has a lot to say and doesn't really leave you feeling all that good at the end.  But like other ultraviolent films like "A Clockwork Orange," or "Menace 2 Society," or even (in its own way) "Natural Born Killers,"  that uses its extreme violence and subject matter in an intelligent, entertaining way.  Just be warned - this is far from the feel-good movie of the year.  But if you can stomach it, it's a pretty darn good flick.</p></br><a href="../users/ANBQIWHO9JRFS.html">ANBQIWHO9JRFS</a><br/><p>Well, that title is perhaps a cheat, as I believe it was actually released in most of the world in 2004 and South Korea in 2003, but I've noticed that some real critics like to go by the year the film came out in their country, so I'll let it slide.<br /><br />Though 'Oldboy' certainly isn't popular, it has gotten quite a lot of underground buzz, and it seems like it always gets compared to the work of some better known director, either Fincher or Nolan or Tarantino or Miike or whoever.  Comparisons can be useful, but they tend to suggest that the film or director is clone or knockoff, and thinking this would be a grave disservice to Chan-wook Park and 'Oldboy'.  This is a strikingly modern film, slick and beautiful in its hyper-technological, urban setting, with an occasionally fractured narrative filled with both dark humor and gruesome violence .  So the comparisons are fairly accurate, actually,  but Park has a knack for putting it all together that it's clear that he isn't imitating anyone else.  It all holds together underneath, with strong storytelling and genuine human interest beneath the attractive surface.<br /><br />You've probably already heard to premise: A drunken and surly, but still seemingly good-natured man named Dae-su spends a night at the police station just before he is abducted by a mysterious stranger.  He's placed in a small apartment devoid of any human contact for 15 years, until he is suddenly released one day.  Dae-su wants revenge, but he perhaps even more than that, he wants to know why this happened to him.  During this he meets a young lady, Mi-do and quickly finds the man responsible for his imprisonment, Woo-jin.  Woo-jin makes a sort of deal with him: If, in the next 5 days, Dae-su can find out why all this happened, Woo-jin will kill himself.  If not, he will kill Mi-do, along with every other woman that Dae-su ever loves.  This may make the film sound rather plot-intensive, but it actually isn't.  Dae-su actually solves the bulk of the mystery fairly easily, the plot generally moves quickly in leaps and bounds between the moody, surreal scenes and various setpieces.<br /><br />`Oldboy' is perhaps the best looking film of last year.  Park composes his shots with great care and it's all sleek, fashionable and modern.  And though it isn't an action movie is still has some cool fighting.  There is one very rough, extended single-shot fight that is becoming quite famous, and rightfully so.  The use of music is also fantastic, with various repeating themes manipulating the mood nicely.  You need great music in order to build up a sorta operatic grandiosity and intensity which this film has in its best scenes.<br /><br />The performances are all great, particularly Min-sik Choi and Ji-tae Yu as Dae-su and Woo-jin, respectively.  Most notably, though they are hero and villain, both of these characters prove to be exceedingly likable and sympathetic once you find out all there is to know.  Dae-su is definitely one of the best protagonists in recent film history, combining an undeniable bada**ness with inner turmoil and self-doubt.  Woo-jin is interesting in that he is rather non-threatening looking and has a fairly playful demeanor that he rarely drops.<br /><br />There are plenty of movies out there that I really like simply because they have so many neat ideas and look so good.  `Oldboy' works on this level, but it also has some real human interest and emotional impact that most films are lacking.  You can really feel the pain of being locked away for so long with no contact, and the scene where Dae-su and Mi-do say goodbye before he heads of to confront Woo-jin is really quite powerful, as are a number of things which happen during the climax of the film, though I can't go into specifics.<br /><br /> I've heard some complain that the ending is slightly drawn-out, and while this is something of a problem it's pretty much the only real concern I have with the film, and it barely matters.  I must note that the denouement will likely put some people off, and not without good reason, as it is rather strange and perverse.  I was sufficiently into the film that I went with it despite the disturbing implications, but others doubtless will not. (Judging by the critical response, however, I believe that most people will go along with it.)  Also, the film does have a significant twist in it, but it's not totally the heart of the film. Well, I should say, it's crucial to the plot, but the whole point of the movie isn't simply to have the rug pulled out from underneath you at the end.  I'm interested to see how they'll deal with this twist in the American remake, as I'm sure execs will assume that such a twist will be upsetting to many viewers, but if you change it you pretty much have to come up with a whole new plot.<br /><br />I guess I'm tired of writing.  Check it out, and whatever you do, DON'T WATCH THE DUBBED VERSION!!!!!! I repeat, DON'T WATCH THE DUBBED VERSION!!!!!!!<br /><br />Grade: A</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>Imagine a Hitchcock thriller crossed with Raymond Chandler's "Farewell My Lovely" with a twist of David Lynch thrown in for good measure and you'll get an idea about how inventive, startling and powerful "Old Boy" is. Chan-wook Park's film dazzles with stunning imagery but more importantly with a brilliantly supversive mystery at its core. Oh Dae-Su is kidnapped after a celebratory night. He was headed home for his young daughter's birthday when he disappears. When he wakes up he finds he's a prisoner in a cutrate hotel without windows and a metal door. His meals are slid under the door to him, his only companionship is a TV and his grip on sanity begins to slip away after 15 years of confinement. Suddenly, he's released without explanation. He's given a cellphone, a wallet full of money and 5 days to discover who imprisoned him and why. Filled with rage when he discovers that his wife was murdered and he was framed for it, Oh Dae-Su tries to try down his young daughter with the help of a sushi chef he meets and gradually falls in love with. This twisted, dark tale has more twists and turns than a mountain road. Oh Dae-Su gradually unravels the mystery which stands at the heart of his existence but with each bit he unravels he discovers more unanswered questions.<br /><br />The image quality on this disc is extremely good as is the sound. The film can be viewed in the original Korean (although English is the default language for the film)and there are subtitles which, amusingly, don't always match what the English dubbed track has. Featuring a director's commentary as well as deleted scenes(with optional commentary) and theatrical trailers for this film and others in the Tartan Asia Extreme Cinema DVD releases, "Old Boy" like "Momento", will keep you guessing all the way to the conclusion. If this was an ordinary mystery, I'd say it would be worth viewing one time but the dazzling directorial skill of Park and the strong performances by the actors (as well as the well written script)make this graphic, violent suspense thriller worthwhile.<br /><br />You'll be glued to your seat as you try and put together the pieces of the puzzle about why this ordinary man's life is taken apart and, more importantly, why he has to put together the pieces of the mystery to regain his life again. Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>This film, in spite of its sulfuric reputation, and the direct connection established by the media in the recent Virginia Tech massacre case, is a masterpiece. A boy has been privately imprisoned for fifteen years with no explanation at all, and of course no trial. It was a private initiative taken by some kind of criminal organization controlled by some kind of mafia itself organized by the entrepreneurial rich. When he is freed he tries to find out why he had been imprisoned like that and to get even with those responsible for it, hence to get his vengeance. The film is a lot more powerful than that in fact, than a simple vengeance case. He will understand that he had known something he shouldn't have known, and he had used it against a schoolmate of his though he should have known he should have kept it for himself, he should have kept his trap shut. And his talking, even if very little, was enough to cause the suicide of a person, and it is the schoolmate of his and lover of the suicidee that went through with his own justice. The film becomes great when the victim of this imprisonment understand his mistake, his crime, his responsibility in the death of the other person and mutilates his speaking for him never to speak anymore. But then the schoolmate, quite older of course understand that he caused a lot of suffering, the death of his victim's wife for instance and the disappearance of his daughter. He then brings justice back onto himself. And the Old Boy, meaning the boy who got old in this private prison, can finally tell the story, in writ, to a woman friend of his and he finally rediscovers love, even if mute love. And this time the film becomes a rewriting of Oedipus' myth: the criminal, unaware of his crime, blinds himself when he discovers the amplitude of his criminal attitude and will die slowly in poverty, rejection and begging. Here the responsibility is definitely shared, silence is imposed onto the criminal tongue, but death comes to the avenging initial criminal who did the first unlawful act that was revealed by the Old Boy, and this Old Boy can then rediscover love again via his writing down his own story. Guilt is always a shared human dimension and punishment must also be shared though some innocent people will pay for the crimes of others and the initial criminal will have to pay more than the subsequent ones. The human species is a very barbaric animal race and yet it is haunted by justice.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine & University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne</p></br><a href="../users/A19VMQDCB4HZ9P.html">A19VMQDCB4HZ9P</a><br/><p>2003 would go down as the year a master filmmaker emerged from the ranks of the independent circles to the forefront of elite directors. Chan-wook Park was already well-known amongst the indie circuit as an innovative director coming out of South Korea's burgeoning film industry. He'd already released such well-received films as Joint Security Area and Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance. In fact, the film in question that's propelled Mr. Park to the forefront would be the second part of a film trilogy dealing with the existential nature of vengeance and its effect on all involved. Oldboy follow's Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance like a sonic boom and inproves on the first leg of the trilogy in every way.<br /><br />Oldboy at its most basic is a revenge film. It is a film about a man wrongly and mysteriously imprisoned for reasons unknown to him and to the audience. We see Dae-su Oh --- the man in question --- through his 15 years of mysterious imprisonment and we see him change from the Average Joe from before his kidnapping to a taut, volatile and somewhat insane individual whose only goal in life is to find whoever did this to him and make him pay. Dae-su Oh's imprisonment takes a good part in the telling and makes up the first third of the film's tale. As the years go by we see him spiral down to the lowest depths a man can get to before sanity leaves him. There's no evidence that he didn't go insane during his imprisonment, but Park sure does show us scenes that Dae-su Oh's singular focus to find out why he was imprisoned and to exact revenge on this involved might have just unhinged the poor man in the process.<br /><br />The second part of the tale being told occurs the moment Dae-su Oh is suddenly --- as mysteriously as his imprisonment --- released. One moment he's still in his prison where his only contact with the outside world is the TV in his room and then he's on the rooftop of a building with new clothes on and a suitcase with more clothes and his notebooks where he's listed all the names he thinks may have caused him this wrong. From here Dae-su goes on a whirlwind search to find clues and information on who may have imprisoned him. Along the way he meets the young sushi chef Mi-do who seem to have taken some interest in Dae-su Oh's well-being and who slowly falls in love with him. It is their journey through the maze and labyrinth of false leads and trails that dominate the second third of this tale. It is also the part of the film where Dae-su Oh's monster persona takes precedence as he wreaks havoc on anyone and everyone who may have the information he needs to solving the mystery of his imprisonment.<br /><br />Many have already mentioned the wince inducing pliers scenes and the single-take corridor fight scene. But it is the lovemaking scene between Dae-su Oh and Mi-do that I consider the most pivotal scene of this part of the tale. With the two characters finally consummating their mutual attraction to each other we see the two as not separate entities but a singular one where both will reap whatever their search will sow in the end. Mi-do becomes less of a sidekick and more of an equal partner in Dae-su Oh's search. She knows that the only way she and Dae-su would find true happiness together is if she helps him finish his quest even if it means finding the truth that may not be to their liking.<br /><br />The third and final part of this tale finally puts to light just who exactly is the mastermind of all that has transpired. The clues picked up by Dae-su Oh starts to fall into place and the puzzle that opens up for him and the audience is nothing less than tragic and Shakespearean. This third part really hits the audience between the eyes about the nature of vengeance and how all-consumming it can be if allowed to simmer, grow and take root. We see how it has already driven Dae-su Oh to the brink of madness and how he teeters just beyond the point of no return. Then on the mastermind of the whole thing we see how one slip of the tongue in the distant past of all involved has consumed this individual to exacting a complex and appropriate plan of revenge on Dae-su Oh. As the tragic and heartwrenching final part of the tale weaves and continues to the end no one ends up being the victor and all become just the victim of the cycle of violence and vengeance thats taken hold of everyone.<br /><br />Chan-wook Park's direction was flawless and there's not a wasted scene from beginning to end. Every scene was shot and edited with a sense of purpose to convey the mood and feel of the situation. It didn't matter whether it was a a slower-paced scene where the actors conversed in intelligent dialogue or a scene full of frantic energy where burst of violence seemed both randomly shot but choreographed at the same time. The composition of the scenes and his judicious use of wide-angle and static shots with little editing helps convey the the single-minded focus of Dae-su Oh and his main antagonist. Some of the scenes even show hints and clues to the audience that --- as unlikely as it might seem --- the whole film might be a figment of Dae-su Oh's fractured mind as a consequence of his imprisonment. Chan-wook Park doesn't answer whether it is a figment of Dae-su's imagination, but the theory is there for people to ponder.<br /><br />The screenplay as Park has written from the original Japanese manga is excellent and doesn't waste unnecessary exposition to distract the audience from the main tale being told. Everything said and acted on the screen ultimately leads to the shocking climax in the end. In fact, I would say that the climax of the film doesn't happen until the very last second of the film before everything fades to black and the credits roll. That's how tightly written and focused the screenplay was.<br /><br />Then there's the three main characters as played by Min-sik Choi, Ji-tae Yu, and Hye-jeong Kang. These three actors play their parts to perfection. Min-sik Choi as Dae-su Oh was a picture of focused madness. We invest in his quest for vengeance and as the final secret was unveiled we truly feel his shock, horror and anguish. Ji-tae Yu plays the mastermind of the whole thing with icy calculation. This was a man who had spent half his life working on, preparing and letting loose the events that would lead to him finally getting his revenge on Dae-su Oh. The two, though after the same goal of vengeance, are diametrically opposed in terms of look and personality. Then we have Hye-jeong Kang as Mi-do, the young sushi chef caught in the middle of this duelling vengeance tale. She was both endearing, innocent and the pure soul that keeps Dae-su Oh from spiralling into final madness. It truly becomes tragic that the final consequences of the vengeance wrought by both male principals impacts the female in the middle and in the end she remains oblivious to the truth and Hye-jeong Kang conveys this sincere, innocent naivete to sweet perfection.<br /><br />There's much more to say about Oldboy, but its really just more accolades to be heaped upon a near-perfect film. A film exploring the darker side of man's inhumanity towards one another to satiate their self-righteous quest for so-called "justice" and retribution. Like Cronenberg's A History of Violence, Park's Oldboy also shows the unending cycle of vengeance heaped upon vengeance in addition to the violence it inherently breeds. Like Cronenberg's 2005 film, Oldboy doesn't fully answer this existential question but leaves it up to the viewer to make their own decision. Chan-wook Park's Oldboy is a film that comes but once in an era and helps redefine an era of its place in film history. Oldboy also continues the vengeance trilogy Park has confirmed will be finished with Sympathy for Lady Vengeance (shortened to just Lady Vengeance here in North America). Oldboy makrs the true arrival of one of the new masters of film and he joins the fine company of such people as Spielberg, Coppola, Scorcese, Cronenberg, Bergman, Kubrick, Kurosawa and Lean. A near-perfect film all-around. 10/10</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>Lots have been said about this film. It is neither a classic nor a flop. After seeing this film last night I found it to be pretty good. There's no reason to bash this film because it does deserve to be rated moderately. When rating a film I ask myself what the film is giving the audience and what the message that the director is pushing across.<br /><br />Like Sympathy...Oldboy is another film concerned with the theme of revenge but on a first glance, seems a little more straightforward in it's approach. On the surface, this seems like a simple revenge fantasy, but as the mystery of why he was subjected to his confinement unfurls, things become a little more complicated. Lee Woo-Jin, his nemesis is at first a cold, calculating man fixated on destroying Dae-Su, but once his reason for doing so becomes clear, its hard not to feel just a little sympathy for him. Furthermore, Park pulls plot twist after plot twist out of his film makers bag of tricks, but manages to keep it from becoming disorientating like in say, Identity and the pace of the film does not suffer for these quiet, analytical sequences.<br /><br />However, what ultimately lets it down is that you get the feeling Park wasn't totally decided on what sort of film to make. Sympathy...for all its flaws had no misgivings about the fact it was a dark revenge tale, but Oldboy cannot seem to decide whether it is a action spectacle or a twisted, Oedipal tragedy. The infamous corridor fight sequence for instance, while fun, seems extremely out of place with the rest of the film and can we really believe that Dae-Su is such a great fighter, when all the training he has done has consisted of shadow boxing? And whoever was in charge of casting should of ask for a second opinion, as Dae-Su and Woo-Jin look to have about fifteen years of age difference between them, when they're supposed to be almost the same age.<br /><br />Aside from that Min-sik Choi gives the performance of that year and potentially his career. As Oh Dae-su, he undergoes a transformation of at least three different persona's, performed almost all of his own stunts and otherwise poured his heart into the movie. I will say `OldBoy' kept me entertain and didn't bore me one bit. It's truly work watching.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>This film is inevitably going to gain a word-of-mouth cult following.  My interest in this film was piqued when "Entertainment Weekly" listed it as one of the year's ten best DVDs.  They were not wrong.  It would be a disservice for me to say too much about this intricate tale of a man mysteriously imprisoned for 15 years who upon release is torn between vengeance and curiousity about the identity and reason for his captivity.  The best I can offer about this Korean import is that it can honestly compared to such latter day classics such as "Chinatown", "The Usual Suspects", "L.A. Confidential", and "Memento".</p></br><a href="../users/A1COW0UIB5HA9J.html">A1COW0UIB5HA9J</a><br/><p>Oh Dae-su was your typical average person until he got jumped by someone and taken to a private prison for 15 years. His prison is basically like a rundown apartment complete with bathroom, a bed and a TV as one of his only link to the outside world besides talking to the jailer, he gets fed 3 times a day including with water and would sometimes get a haircut but during those years he builds up so when the time comes he can take care of someone his own way. Now in 2003 after 15 years he is finally free out on the streets of Seoul as he is given new clothes, cash and a cellphone. He sees the city has changed over the years, he finds romance with a Japanese chef named Mido and now must find the crooks who tormented him and imprisoned him for those years.<br /><br />A most excellent crime thriller and one of the best comic based movies ever. From Korean director Park Chanwook, this movie is loosely based on a popular Japanese manga or Japanese comic book, this movie is a poetic and very violent revenge movie about what it feels to be aged and being away from the world for a long time. There's a Taratino-esque quality to it that he even approve of this movie as being one of his favorite movies ever and now it has became a cult classic that even thrilled critics. This movie is brutally violent at times with a couple of torture scenes like the cringe inducing dental job with a hammer-back scene to good acting. This complex work of art is one that entertains and thrills the viewer to the edge of their seats to the mind blowing ending.<br /><br />The blu-ray has a nice transfer with good sound with great extras like 3 commentaries in subtitles with your choice of Korean with english subs or English dubbing. Trailers, deleted scenes with optional commentary and a second disc with 5 documentaries, interviews and featurettes.<br /><br />A must have for fans of crime, action, comic book movies and cinema alike.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJIJKKN15KR9.html">A1TJIJKKN15KR9</a><br/><p>A Korean action-suspense flick that, like many far-east thrillers, doesn't hesitate to take things well into the realm of the taboo. In a lot of ways that's a blast of fresh air, as no doubt an American version wouldn't have been half as biting, daring or dark, and its dedication to probing the unacceptable makes up a large part of Oldboy's character. It's not those stabs outside the boundaries that bothered me about this one, though, so much as it was the refusal to bask in them for more than a few instants before jolting off in search of new depths. The establishing story is almost perfect, setting the stage with an everyman who's been transformed by fifteen years of unexplained imprisonment, then following his violent, dedicated search for both suspect and reason. It's an act the tangled, overstretched follow-through can't hope to match, even when its mysteries and motivations are finally, confusingly, lain bare. Oldboy deserves recognition for its style, demeanor and intense action scenes, but the plot often veers into weirdness and depravity for unclear reasons that don't always benefit the bigger picture.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>When I mentioned to a friend last week that I had just watched and liked <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003T6LIBM">The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo</a>, he suggested that if I like stories of mystery, murder and revenge that I ought to try Old Boy. So from Sweden to South Korea I went this weekend, and my friend was right, Old Boy was quite good. (But I think that I've filled my quota for subtitled movies for the year.)<br /><br />While a little over the top and bizarre at times, Old Boy is one of the more original and diabolical stories that I've seen in a while. Your name is Dae-su and you've been kidnapped off the streets one day to find yourself locked in a room with no explanation for why you're being held captive. No one communicates with you other than a TV set that has been placed in the room and your only contact with anyone is a daily serving of dumplings pushed through a small opening in the locked door. Now imagine that several years of this pass and there's still no explanation for your captivity.<br /><br />Would you go nuts? Or would you spend every day wishing and preparing for release so that you could exact revenge on your captors? Be careful what you wish for, because being locked in a room for the rest of your life could turn out to be a better option if your captor releases you and your imprisonment was only the beginning of your torment. "Laugh, and the world laughs with you. Weep, and you weep alone." Baloney! Ask Dae-su how he feels about that inspirational poster.<br /><br />Old Boy is darkly amusing at times, but mostly genuinely disturbing. Importantly, it was thoroughly entertaining. It had enough action and the twists and turns came frequently enough to prevent any boredom. Definitely worth reading 2 hours of subtitles.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>`Oldeuboi' tells the twisted tale of a man named Dae-su Oh who is imprisoned for fifteen years with no understanding as to why only to be released suddenly, left to ponder the realities of his situation while seeking unlawful revenge on the man who stole such a large chunk of his life from him.<br /><br />I don't even want to begin to hint at the films final revelations, for they are best served as a complete surprise.<br /><br />Oh, but how delicious is heated debate, so I'm going to do my best to elaborate as ambiguously as possible here.<br /><br />The film is a total morality tale, but it is, in the end, something completely devoid of all morals.  The character of Dae-su Oh is a drunk and a disorderly man (as witnessed by the opening scene as well as by news reports overheard shortly thereafter).  He has left a long trail of enemies (he himself finds it most difficult to narrow down the list of suspects in his search for his captor) and has cataloged a long list of personal failings on his part.  He is, as he put it himself, nothing more than a beast.  The thing is, when all is said and done, Dae-su Oh seems very human to the audience.  When you take someone who is reportedly undesirable and then do awful things to them they become somewhat sympathetic, don't they?  If you doubt my words then ask yourself why you don't hate him when the credits begin to roll, because you know why he did what he did and it should repulse you.  Another thing I find simply remarkable is the `reason' for which all of these things take place is not anything that Dae-su Oh even recalls.  As his aggressor puts it, it wasn't important to him and so he simply forgot; end of discussion.  The fact that it wasn't of any importance to Dae-su Oh is something of grave importance for it outlines the very fact that our actions, no matter how innocent in texture, have lasting and at times devastating outcomes.<br /><br />But then again, it's not like Dae-su Oh is completely to blame for that tragedy.<br /><br />If you are reading this and have as of yet to see this remarkable film, watch it tonight.<br /><br />The film could be (ignorantly) labeled an action film.  Well, it is one to a certain extent, but Chan-wook Park really proves that there is no bounds to the amount of emotional depth one can heap upon a certain genre.  Not many action films contain this much poignancy and remain this harrowing.  The action scenes (which can get ridiculously brutal) are perfectly balanced in tone to never once convey a sense of surrealism.  This film is very real.  The violence is handled with care to remain something feasible.  The film never dips into CGI mode (thank the heavens).  The acting is also a standout.  The lead performance, delivered by Min-sik Choi, is so layered it is unforgettable (especially that breakdown sequence with the whole `dog' transformation).  Yes, he is angry and vengeful, but he is never one-note.  The amount of emotional transference noted in a single facial expression is bountiful.<br /><br />The final reveal in `Oldeuboi' is heart stopping and it may leave a sour taste in your mouth, but it is all par for the course and serves as an unforgettable way to make a lasting impression, and raise very complex question:<br /><br />"And now... now, what joy will I have left to live for?"</p></br><a href="../users/AIMR915K4YCN.html">AIMR915K4YCN</a><br/><p>Locked in a windowless room, w/ only a television for company, a man grows increasingly cold and vengeful.

No reason for the bizarre incarceration. So begins this man's quest to solve the greatest, darkest mystery of his life, and to get the answer to WHY any of it has happened. Also, WHO would do such a thing, going through so much trouble, expense, and planning in order to imprison one man? He WILL find out, but the answer just might be worse than anything he has yet endured. OLDBOY is far from any typical revenge story.

It, well, no, I can't tell you,  you have to see it to believe it.  If you are into this kind of sick stuff, it is for you, but the second half of the movie just gets too "extreme" for me.  I will check out another one of these some time, but I give it one more chance.  Can anyone recomend a "tartan" action movie for me that is not so freakign extreme.  Good flick though, very good.<br /><br />Also the music kicked ass, but the music changes just like the movie does towards the end.  I may have gave this 3 stars, but being an action fan, I really enjoyed the realism as well as the unrealism in the fight scenes.  Yes he does use that hammer:)  The acting was BRILLIANT, story was good, but I only like my stomach turning over when I am watchign a horror. But last reviewr is right, camera angles and overall directorial job is just awesome.<br /><br />Commentary gives you all types of insight as the director and cinematographer focus mainly on the film and don't really get off topic.  They certianly wanted to talk about how they made it, some really good info on the  commentary.<br /><br />In the interview with the director he talks about the violence in his movies, how surprising.<br /><br />Other goodies iclude deleted sceens and trailers.<br /><br />Overall I have to say that the special features are superior to pretty much any other all region or region 1 asian dvd.

After a while trying to readjust to society and figure out what's happened, he is given 5 days to wreak vengeance upon whoever took his life away from him.  Unfortunately, the progress is being watched by a less than benevolent spectator.<br /><br />What's interesting about this film is it's influences.  It's based loosely around The Count of Monte Cristo, takes a lot of Shakespearian and Biblical elements, throws in typical Asian kung fu, and then puts it into a very modern stylistic context in terms of cinema.  The best part about this movie's style is that it never actually feels overdone and it actually seems to make sense...  a shot isn't canted just to be weird, it's more subtle than that, even if the tone itself bleeds the idea of style.<br /><br />Honestly, I was taken simply by a single shot, a long take where the camera tracks along a hallway as the main character fights off a large group of people.  It straddles the line between realism and romance and creates a distructive ballet of choreography and motion that is downright beautiful in a somewhat horrible way.  Then setting it into the context it has to a rather well done and structured story really helps this movie have a profound effect on the viewer.  Just don't expect to be coming out of this feeling very happy, as it gets a bit disturbing at the end.<br /><br />It may have overdone the ending, but I don't care.  The weird mix of hypnosis and not-hypnosis kind of constricted the story.  It is interesting to note that this film is of a new group of films out there that a few people call Asian Extreme Cinema, and I've seen two other films from this neo-genre that involve heavy use of violence and hypnosis themes (and men cutting their own tongues out).  Why do these images seem to tie this genre together?  What is it about hypnosis, specifically, that creates an anxious desire in these filmmakers for broken vigilantes?<br /><br />--PolarisDiB</p></br><a href="../users/A2BPDFR58H9575.html">A2BPDFR58H9575</a><br/><p>You can learn a few things from this ultra violent, darker than dark Drama / Mystery / Thriller with the occasional elements of humor: you will learn the new meaning of words Fresh Sea Food, you will never be able to listen to Vivaldi's "Four Seasons" the same way again, you will think twice before going to your Dentist's office. Be careful of what you say about anyone - you never know how your words can (and will) affect their (and what is most important your) life. And the last but not the least, revenge is the dish better served cold, 15 years cold. Without spoiling anything, no matter how far and how fast we try to get away from our destiny, each step would bring us closer to it until the inevitable and shocking "Appointment in Samarra".<br /><br />I have mixed feelings for the movie. It is very impressive, and trying to take the story in its second hour to Sophocles's realm was a clever twist but something stops me from pronouncing it great. The more I think the less I like it and the reasons are incoherent plotting, very ambiguous moral equation, and technical sloppiness that insult my intelligence.<br /><br />Threre are two things that impressed me the most - fascinating performance by an octopus (sadly, it was its one and only performance) and the story of a guy with a little dog that we never heard.

On one level, "Oldboy" is a classic man-wrongly-accused story of the type Hitchcock did so well - but neither we nor Dae-Su know what he is accused of.  Indeed, "Oldboy" starts off as man-wrongly-punished - or is he?  Park sets up the camera and lets it remain stationary a la Kubrick for much of the movie, adding to the tension by making us unsure of when he will cut away.  And us Western viewers will wish he had cut away from some of the more gonzo horror scenes.  Asian horror is far more transgressive than American horror, and while this film does not descend to the same depths that a Takashi Miike film would, several scenes go beyond what we Americans are used to, even in a post-"Hostel" world.  Even the subject matter, which is revealed at the end, is much more transgressive than what we would expect from an American movie.<br /><br />Having said that, "Oldboy" has no shortage of humor, interesting characters, and artistic choices - shades of "Pulp Fiction" and Tarantino's other films.  As such, "Oldboy" may be one of the more accessible films to those new to Asian cinema.  And it includes a psychopathic Stanford grad, to boot.<br /><br />I knocked off a star due to some pacing issues, and an ending that didn't quite fit with the rest of the film.  Without ruining the ending, it lasts too long, and where we should be racing for the curtain, there is overwrought melodrama and general wasting of time.  I thought this was over 10 minutes before it was.<br /><br />Nevertheless, fans of suspense, action and horror will enjoy this, as will fans of Asian cinema and people who are interested in Asian cinema.  "Oldboy" is worth at least a rent.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IWWRZJOXOSYP.html">A1IWWRZJOXOSYP</a><br/><p>"Oldboy" is an excellent film.  Its violence is startling.  Korea has two major film festivals, one is government-sponsored while the Blue Dragon festival has been controversial because it is sponsored by a conservative newspaper -- like the Fox news of Korea -- and has had scandals about vote buying.  Despite that controversy, from what I've read, it is highly influential in Korea.  This film won three major Blue Dragon creative awards.  Park Chan-Wook won as Best Director; Choi Min-Sik won as Best Actor; and Gang Hye-jeong (or Hye-jeong Kang) won as Best Actress.  The film also won the Grand Prix Award @ Cannes in 2004.<br /><br />The story grabs you from the start.  We watched the DVD in Korean with English subtitles to hear the powerful original voices of the actors.  As Oh Dae-su, Choi Min-sik does a masterful leading performance.  His character goes from obnoxious drunk to the driven haggard man who seeks revenge.  Both he and Yu Ji-tae again work with director Park Chan-Wook on "Lady Vengeance," with a similar theme, this time with a woman falsely imprisoned.  Yu Ji-tae as Lee Woo-Jin is a smooth corporate success.  The set designer creates a cold austere penthouse where Lee Woo-Jin showers in a glass stall in his office and has waterways built into the floor.  The subplot of his illicit relationship with his sister and his murder of her is chilling.  Gang Hye-jeong as Mi-do does a good job of being the unstable caregiver that adopts Oh Dae-su upon his release and falls in love with him.  Oh Dae-su's best friend No joo-hwan is played by the paunchy Dae-han Ji and fills the role with believable friendly support.<br /><br />The images in this film are startling.  Oh Dae-su eats an Octopus.  (Apparently, Choi Min-sik is a Buddhist and had to do prayers after this scene.)  The tongue scene was gruesome & hard to watch.  The actor who plays the blond assistant to Lee Woo-Jin also did an excellent job throughout the movie.  The cinematography is top rate.  From the prison set that looks like an Asian Motel 6 to the penthouse to the outdoor images, "Oldboy" visually impresses the viewer.  While I read the usual accolades on the DVD box, I was not expecting such an excellent film.  This one is stunning.  Bravo!</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>I just caught this film on DVD after hearing much hype over the last couple of years and I wasn't let down. The acting was very good and the twist was unique (though I did predict it before it was revealed). This film may be a disturbing to some, even though it leaves more up to the imagination in terms of actually showing the gore. If you are in the mood for an original movie that will likely leave you a little depressed, then give Oldboy a try. When the film ends, you can at least be optimistic about how your life isn't half as bad as it could be. Just look at the dude in Oldboy for a reference.</p></br><a href="../users/A6ADO7B6FUVN.html">A6ADO7B6FUVN</a><br/><p>Oldboy has a Shakespearian tone as it depicts the tale of Oh Dae-su (Min-sik Choi), whose name means "he who can get along with people".  Oh Dae-su is on his way home after having been arrested for public drunkenness to celebrate his daughters birthday.  However, Oh Dae-su never arrives to his home as he is kidnapped and imprisoned in a small room where his only contact with the human world is a television.  During the time Oh Dae-su is caged someone murders his wife and he becomes the prime suspect for the murder.  The questions that Oh Dae-su unsuccessfully attempts to answer while locked up is why revenge is being taken on him and who is seeking this cruel revenge.  After 15 years Oh Dae-su is released from his torturous imprisonment, which leaves him confused and ragingly vengeful.<br /><br />Chan-wook Park directs a brilliant cinematic experience that is full of well-written conspiring intrigues that will keep the audience in suspense.  The suspense is initiated in the opening shot where a man is hanging over the edge of a roof top causing the audience to asks themselves--why is this happening?  The suspense continues as new and mysterious clues appears, but apprehension does not leave the audience even after the end of the film as the final line echos in the minds of the audience.  Park's vision of revenge in Oldboy often depicts exaggerated violence that is well balanced with story as it is related to the themes of the film.  However, this should serve as a warning to squeamish folks as the film is occasionally brutal and bizarre.  Furthermore, the cinematography used in Oldboy vividly projects the emotional tone of the cinematic themes and characters.  The characters are also superbly performed by an excellent cast, which will help the audience to experience a first class cinematic event.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FG91CM8221X1.html">A1FG91CM8221X1</a><br/><p>The consensus of critical opinion is that Chan-wook Park's  "Oldboy" is one of the true cinematic masterpieces of the past decade. In both plot and technique, it is, indeed, incredibly brilliant; on those points alone it deserves four stars out of five. I understand why "Oldboy" has so many ardent admirers (chief among them Quentin Tarantino, for whom Park could be suspected of tailoring this film). Yet, though I have a reasonably strong stomach for cinematic gore, I found "Oldboy" to be a little TOO sadistic. When you compare "Oldboy" with Tarantino's own work--"Pulp Fiction" and the "Kill Bill" movies--you realize that Tarantino's movies have a cartoonishness about them, a hip and ironic remove, that reminds audiences they're just watching a movie after all. There is no such remove in "Oldboy." I have nothing but praise for the performance of Min-sik Choi as Oh Dae-su, the heedless, obnoxious but not really so bad guy who is imprisoned, tortured and toyed with for 15 years. I have never seen such a realistic, heartrending cinematic portrayal of abject grief as Choi's at the end of this film, when Oh Dae-su discovers both his torturer's identity and the full extent of his treachery. And this is precisely my problem: the film's emotions are too real. Obviously I'm in a tiny minority about this, but I simply felt too sorry for Oh Dae-su to get the requisite thrills from this thriller. Vincent Vega and Beatrix Kiddo are, as Tarantino intended, pulp fiction; Oh Dae-su is flesh and blood--and BOY, do we get to see that demonstrated, very graphically indeed. Reviewers have equally high praise for the other films in Park's trilogy, "Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance" and "Sympathy for Lady Vengeance." I think I'm going to wait a while before I check them out, however. The DVD transfer of "Oldboy" is sharp and excellent, but the film has been dubbed rather than subtitled (not really a problem, except for the annoyingly chirpy voice of the actress who dubs the character of Miko). A bigger disappointment is that the deleted scenes and the bonus interview with Chan-wook Park are in undubbed, unsubtitled Korean.</p></br><a href="../users/A34VV92TSLC37R.html">A34VV92TSLC37R</a><br/><p>Oldboy's beginning had me excited for the rest of the film.  I mean it is a great beginning.  Oh Dae-su is kidnapped from the middle of the street one night, and we then learn through his narration that he will be in his cell for the next 15 years.  We go through the journey with him, seeing the time pass by as he finds ways to get himself through each day.  Then, miraculously, he is released one day for what appears to be no reason whatsoever.  Once he is released, he sets out to find his captors.  The only clue he has is the food that he ate on every single day for the past 15 years, so he goes to every restaurant named Blue Dragon until he tastes the food he knows so well.  Once he finds out where he was kept, he has to find out who and why, and that is where the film goes crazy.<br /><br />The twists at the end of this film are some of the best I can think of from recent film history.  Not only is the subject matter hard to handle, but the film also features some horrible scenes of violence, and one scene where a live octopus was definitely harmed in the making of the film.  While I'm not in love with this movie (it definitely slows down after the beginning), it is more interesting and original than a lot of stuff that our country has put out recently.  And it was definitely good enough for me to check out the other two parts of Park's vengeance trilogy.</p></br><a href="../users/AHL35XZ3OND2Z.html">AHL35XZ3OND2Z</a><br/><p>For a film about death, it sure feels alive.<br /><br />What would you do after being trapped in a hotel room for 15 years?  If your answer is "bloody revenge," then you pretty much know what Odlboy is about.  Or do you?<br /><br />This is a revenge flick, make no mistake.  All the genre hallmarks are in place, but this is much more than Kill Bill Korea or a Seoul version of a Charles Bronson blast fest, believe it or not, there's some real heart at work here.  Director Park Chan-wook takes obvious western influences and crafts a completely unique odyssey of death and even redemption.  Choi Min-sik is a miracle worker in his portrayal of the avenging angel Oh Dae-su.  His performance is probably one of the best to come out of any film in the last 20 or 30 years.<br /><br />The serpentine manga story of Oldboy is judiciously revealing and though oweing nods to Tarantino, de Palma and even Robert Towne, as I said before, it feels original at every turn.  The action is similar. The hallway hammer fight is a brilliant example of where western action seems to always get it wrong.  Clearly Asian in style, Park's uncutting wide angle camera gives us everything without bumpy cameras and non-stop edits to break the dance of carnage or the tension.  There are no cheats here, we get it all in mass quantity.  And that goes for everything else in the film, like it or not.  Oldboy is a poster child for the eruption of excellent South Korean films in the last ten years and the pinnacle of the masochistic gangster genre that has become so popular on the south end of the peninsula.  Oldboy is an incredibly violent film.  It's not really Goodfellas violent, it's more Peckinpah or Marathon Man to me.  Yet for all the torture and brutality, Park Chan-wook  has a made a film that feels as violent as it needs to be to tell its story.  This one is not for the kids and also not very everybody.  It is a genuinely adult odyssey, and even then perhaps only for a few.<br /><br />I feel there is a real kinship between Oldboy and Beat Takeshi's Violent Cop. But this one has real depth of story and character where Violent Cop was exercise.  The journey we go on is a long one and though the ending is needlessly "artsy" it is a satisfying trip and easily the finest, deepest and most polished of Park's vengeance trilogy.  I'm sure some greedy American producers are working on a remake but let's hope it never sees the light of day.  Even in South Korea many psuedo clones and even competent riffs like The Man from Nowhere miss the point.  Sight unseen, if a true remake ever comes, I'll skip the new one and take the old boy every time.</p></br><a href="../users/AIY4H4KWR2KWZ.html">AIY4H4KWR2KWZ</a><br/><p>This might be one of the most intensely bizarre movies I have ever seen.

And what a tragedy for anyone who hasn't yet seen this powerful film.<br /><br />If you're lucky enough to be free from any spoilers as I was: Old Boy is completely original (how many times can you honestly say that about a film?), independently creative, performed meticulously and is deliciously twisted.<br /><br />Top marks in every category that I can think of - and well worth the full purchase price. Don't even blink if a clean used copy is available - buy it.<br /><br />One important note: Absolutely do not get the dubbed version.

The next night after seeing it, I ended up dreaming I was trapped in a hotel room, with my hair growing out of control, with the exception being that there was no TV. It certainly makes you think how you would cope in that situation - the only situation similar to that would be prison. But at least in prison you get some luxuries.<br /><br />The story is based around Oh Dae-Su, who is taken from the streets after a drunken night out, and held prisoner in a hotel-style room, with no way out and nothing but the TV for company. He keeps up with the events of the world through this, and also learns of his wife's death and his young daughter's subsequent adoption. When his hair needs cut, or his room needs cleaned, he's gassed. After 15 years he's released, to a whole new world, and a wallet full of a cash, and a mobile phone.<br /><br />What happens after that is an absolute whirlwind of emotions and imagery. I won't spoil any of the film for you, but be prepared to concentrate. Unfortunately, the film does lose its momentum part way through, and then it all comes together at the end.<br /><br />When you think you know exactly what is happening in this film, it takes a sudden twist, and you're left thinking again, and puzzling over it, trying to work out what's happening, and where it's going before it gets there. The film comes to an absolute through-provoking climax, where I was still left wondering what on earth was going on, and it will take a few minutes to work it out. But I did go home babbling about it to my dad (who'd already seen the film) which is normally a good sign.<br /><br />I didn't really like Sympathy For Mr Vengence, but Oldboy has more than made up for that.

Yet whereas Fincher's film explored the origins of, and visceral release of violence, this guy Park just loves the stuff and there seems to be no limit to the lengths he will exploit it for cinematic gain. All wrapped safely in sarcasm and black humor of course. The tone of the original Japanese manga is considerably different; it is much more of an intense, existential story of a man losing his identity.<br /><br />Yes, it is quite jaw-dropping how well this guy can stage a scene and elicit dry humor amidst total degradation. He also knows good music and the film looks extremely cool with its color palette, endless reams of rotting geometric wallpaper and first-rate art direction. Some of the coolest titles you'll lay eyes on as well.<br /><br />But this film crosses the line into repulsive ethical territory without condemning it. This is all started in American Films of the 60s with treating criminals and violent acts with sympathy -- but Oldboy wallows in horrendous acts of brutality and treats them like a video game. Even worse is the sexuality of the film, which progresses from unsettling to extremely disturbing by the end. And make no mistake about it, Park really is offering an apologia to a sex crime that has been degenerate for millenia in any civilized society. Unbelievable. You can accuse me of American parochialism but I think this film transcends the usual frame of reference: wanker Hollywood endings or Judeo-Christian hypocrisy.<br /><br />So, it is difficult to rate a film of such talent and technique while not hating it for what it is saying. "Just because I am a beast...." Give me a break.</p></br><a href="../users/AVT9Q9PTUCDMR.html">AVT9Q9PTUCDMR</a><br/><p>The story is ridiculous and has so many holes in it, I'm shocked at the press reviews lauding it so much. Where the movie works for me is the layers that are revealed as to why this guy was imprisoned in hotel room (why a hotel room...your guess is as good as mine) for 15 years and why he's never told why he's being imprisoned. Yet this whole psychological experiment is really one of revenge from something tragic that happened back in his high school days.<br /><br />Weirdly loopy logic throughout. Incredibly dark sets. Gratuitous nudity. Hilarious English dubbing. It works on a B movie level but to think this is great "art" is taking it a bit far. It's basically a typical story found in Japanese manga that J-salarymen get off on (high school sex and suicide) redone in a South Korean setting.<br /><br />The extras are dull as dishwater usual--audio commentary track, director interview, deleted scenes.<br /><br />A rental at best.</p></br><a href="../users/A39W3263A9HCMN.html">A39W3263A9HCMN</a><br/><p>Ha, Ha!

When you see our hero humiliated at the end, you won't think that revenge is sweet any longer. (Tarantino made an attempt at this at the end of KILL BILL, VOL. 2, but then Tarantino is perhaps too infatuated with obscure old movies to really be able to convincingly pull off such a humanistic gesture with the conviction Park shows in OLDBOY.)<br /><br />Revenge movies have always been somewhat morally problematic, especially in modern movies. It's become an action cliche that when someone close to a hero dies, the hero may show a flash of pain on his face, but then he'll collect himself, stand up, and go after his nemesis with even greater force. Obviously, it's an understandable impulse, revenge---but, as even Shakespeare tried to show in HAMLET, it's rarely as simple as that. My memory of HAMLET is a bit faulty, to be honest, but I remember that none of the characters were painted in broad strokes of black or white, and that Hamlet's quest for revenge had an effect on the people around him (especially his sister Ophelia). And of course there's Hamlet himself: thirsty for revenge, but always over-thinking his every move, perhaps too passive a character to ever carry out such a thing.<br /><br />OLDBOY is far from HAMLET, of course. But, in its own gritty way, its view of revenge---as an inhumanly vicious cycle---is similar. It may not have the nuances of Shakespeare, but it has a poetic intensity at the end of it that can only be described as "powerful."<br /><br />This could have been a great film, though, if Park didn't at times seem so eager to shock for the sake of shock. I mean, seriously (and I hope this isn't too much of a spoiler): did we really need the whole incest thing thrown in? And, of course, the violence is occasionally graphic, and filmed in a way that may lead some people to dismiss Park as un-serious in his mostly-pessimistic view of vengeance. There is one scene that is problematic in this regard: one in which Oh takes on a whole bunch of cronies wielding a hammer. Most of the fight is filmed in one long take, and it is probably a scene that wouldn't feel too much out of place in Tarantino's KILL BILL, VOL. 1 (you know, the more violent installment, heh). For a director who makes a big show of decrying the inhumanity of revenge, he does make some of the violence look awfully cool.<br /><br />But that's not being totally fair to Park, I don't think. Yeah, there are problems in OLDBOY, aspects in which Park's shock tactics go a little too far. Overall, though, I think this is one violent film that doesn't take the pain out of violence, both physical and emotional. You're not hyped up to cheer the revenger here; Oh Dae-su is a sympathetic but not necessarily likable hero (and the actor, Choi Min-sik, doesn't really attempt to make him likable, either). I mean, does he really have to rip the teeth out of a bad guy, like he does in one particularly gory scene? Park's point is that revenge has taken over Oh's life in such a way that it has made him less of a human being. Better this than the stupid (if technically well-made) action revenge sagas that Hollywood has occasionally produced in recent years. Recommended, with reservations.</p></br><a href="../users/A319SKSB556033.html">A319SKSB556033</a><br/><p>I was often recommended Oldboy by loads of people but kept putting it off for some reason. Well, I'm glad I just decided to go 'what the hell' because it IS actually really, really good.<br /><br />Even though the plot has been outlined a zillion times in other reviews, I will simply say that some seemingly random dude is plucked from the streets, imprisoned in a shoddy apartment for 15 years and let loose with a wallet full of money and a cell phone. He has 5 days to find the man who imprisoned him and why.<br /><br />An absorbing set-up and the clues as he slowly finds them and slowly puts them together make for a brilliant mystery movie with a wicked dark sense of humor. The plot has layers and layers of mystery and our hapless hero wades through thick twists and turns, always keeping us on the edge of our seats.<br /><br />There are some brilliant fight scenes and some truly bizarre moments, such as a live octopus being eaten whole. But what really floored me was the ending. I won't tell you a tiny little bit of it. But...wow! As is the case with EVERY SINGLE Asian MOVIE, Oldboy is currently being remade by Hollywood. Because anything that the Asians can do, Hollywood can apparently do better. In my opinion this film really doesn't need a remake as this version is strong enough to appeal to the whole world.<br /><br />Too bad most of the planet are philistines who would rather 'watch' a film than 'read' it. A complaint I hear often enough. If your impression of Asian films is they are all shoddy and not very modern looking then, in the case of Oldboy, you are very much mistaken.<br /><br />Among the many strong points of the movie are the faultless editing and stunning photography. Oldboy is the slickest movie I have seen in a good while and can easily out-gloss anything by Michael Bay.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and check this movie out. If you don't love it then you truly have no business watching films at all. I'll save you time and tell you outright that if you like stuff like Crapper By The Dozen 2 and Miss Congenatiliality 2 then is best you just stick to stuff like that.

I figured, yeah, the twist may not be as exciting or surprising as some say it will be, but I know that at least I'm getting a good movie. That was true for Oldboy--it is an excellent all-around movie--and the twist itself paid off big time. I've never been floored like that in my life.<br /><br />Oldboy follows the fifteen year journey of a man named Oh Dae-su who is married, has a child, and an obvious penchant for creating problems for those around him. He is suddenly taken from the streets of Seoul, and imprisoned inside a room for fifteen years, given food, TV, writing materials, a shower, everything a person can live off of, except simple freedom and the answers to his questions. During his time here, he trains himself to fight, records everything he did up to his current days of imprisonment, and attempts suicide twice, both failures. But then he's suddenly drugged and hypnotized, and wakes up outdoors, on the roof of a building, dressed in a nice suit with all of the few possessions he had had inside of the room. He soon learns that he's been framed for his wife's murder, and his daughter has been adopted by Swedes. And he has one thing on his mind: find out who imprisoned him and kill them.<br /><br />I won't go on from there, because I may spoil the twist for some people. I will say that the action scenes in this movie are great; it's as if the actors were placed in a room and told to fight for their lives. It looks real. The actor who plays Oh Dae-su plays this role brilliantly. He's funny and dramatic, and carries with him in his appearance all those years of imprisonment. The story itself plays out slowly, releasing tidbits of information, enough to keep you interested long until the next small lump of info. While not an actual mystery, you still feel as if you're trying to solve Oh Dae-su's problem along with him, as he makes it easy to get inside of his head.<br /><br />I can't recommend this movie enough. I wonder why films like this get ignored so easily. Oldboy is smarter than anything Hollywood has made in ages, with superior acting, a great soundtrack, and an intense well-plotted story. If you like good movies, then pick up Oldboy.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>"Oldboy" plays like a martial arts version of a Franz Kafka novel.  Dae-su Oh is a businessman in Korea who wakes up one day to find himself imprisoned in what appears to be a cheap hotel room from which he cannot escape (any time spent in a Motel 6 can elicit the same impression).  He doesn't know why he's there or who put him there, but he spends his fifteen-year-long "sentence" watching TV and perfecting his fighting skills, the better to exact revenge on those responsible when he finally gets out.  When that day comes, he sets out to unravel the mystery of his captivity, seeking out clues with the help of a sweet, sad young waitress he meets on his first day of freedom.<br /><br />"Oldboy" is an imaginative, high-energy film that keeps the viewer guessing right up to its final moments.  Shot through with dark humor, stylish directorial touches, and cartoon-style (albeit fairly graphic) violence, the film is deliberately disorienting in the beginning, the better to approximate the confused psychological state of its protagonist.  But eventually the plot points come fully into focus, and the film doesn't fall victim to that dreaded Third Act curse which has been the undoing of so many other mystery films of recent years.<br /><br />Fun stuff.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZLROGIL2V7GV.html">A2ZLROGIL2V7GV</a><br/><p>You know how effective a film is if after it's over and you're in bed trying to go to sleep, that the film in question refuses to leave your mind for a second and you cannot stop thinking about it.  "Oldboy" is such a film, and to deny the fact that it captures raw and brutal emotion within it would be a disservice.  Whether you love the movie or despise it, you cannot argue with the fact that it will at some point hit a nerve.<br /><br />"Oldboy" tells the tale of Oh Dae-su, who at first sight is just a drunken babbling mess who gives no one any ounce of respect, not even the cops who have arrested him for his drunken and disorderly conduct.  He sings, calls them hideous swear words and sees no wrongdoing on his part.  After he leaves the station, he is abducted by unknown captors.  He is imprisoned in a strange and isolated room... for 15 years.  For those 15 years, he nearly loses his mind and wonders what misdeeds of his past has brought him to this horror.  After 15 years, he is released without any explanation or answers.  Oh Dae-su vows that he will find the truth and get revenge on anyone responsible for his imprisonment.  In fact, the whole point is that the captor is planning on Oh finding out the truth, as that is the whole point of his game.  Blood will be shed and devastating revelations will make their presence felt.<br /><br />"Oldboy" is a film unlike any I have ever seen.  Rarely have I ever seen a movie so dark, brutal and unrelenting--and yet be so beautiful at the same time.  You really do feel emotionally invested.  This is not a simple shoot-em-up revenge thriller.  It is something beyond that.  It poses questions and investigates the darker side of being human.  Not once did I feel myself losing interest.  The movie is superbly directed and acted.  There is a phenomenal fight scene where it's done in one complete shot, and without it being loud or flashy.  I also have to add that this film has one of the best and most haunting music scores since "Requiem for a Dream."<br /><br />Be warned, this isn't for everybody.  It is a dark movie and it does not let you off easy.  While it's not non-stop action and the movie focuses more on story and character, the violent scenes are really brutal.  You can watch it with an English dubbed track, but I encourage you to watch it with subtitles and see it in its original language.  Nowadays the English dubs do not do the films justice, as they change words and phrases around to make it seem more in sync with lip movement from the actors.  The Blu-Ray version of the film includes 2 disks.  There are some nice behind-the-scenes featurettes.<br /><br />"Oldboy" is a film that will leave its mark on you, no matter what your final judgment on the movie may be.  It takes "revenge" to a whole new and unexpected level and you'll have no idea where it's all leading to until the very end.  It's not for everybody, but if you're looking for something that's dark, intense, challenging and beautiful, give it a try.  You'll never look at revenge thrillers in the same way ever again.  Most likely, no other revenge thrillers will ever come close. - Michael Crane</p></br><a href="../users/A2UUP58XPQW3GF.html">A2UUP58XPQW3GF</a><br/><p>OLDBOY is the 2nd installment of Park Chan-Wook's vengeance trilogy that is loosely based on the Japanese comic by Tsuchiya Garon and Minegishi Nobuaki. I use the term "loosely" because the plot, characters and almost everything else is completely re-worked for the big screen. I've read that Park saw his film; "Sympathy with Mr. Vengeance" a sort of commercial failure, so he comes back with an effective counter-attack. Oldboy made me re-think the old adage: revenge is best served cold, because this film emits SCORCHING FIRE.<br /><br />Oh Daesu (Choi Min-Sik) is a man with a wife and child. He is kidnapped and kept in captivity in a small room, fed with dumplings mostly as his main dish, with only a television to keep him company for 15 years. Someone paid an obscene amount of money to incarcerate him indefinitely. Mentally tortured and overcome with a desire for revenge, he plots for escape. One day, he is set free and dumped in the streets, with a suit to wear and left with some money. Daesu meets and hooks up with a young sushi chef; Mido (Hye-Jeong Kang) to look for the man responsible for his incarceration.<br /><br />"Oldboy" has a lot of visual wallop and visceral punch. Park's stylish direction and the VERY intriguing premise are truly awesome. There are quite a few films that really stayed with me; this film is one of them. I can still clearly remember the great soundtrack, the visually original hallway fight, the tooth-pulling, the live octopus devouring and others. The ingenious style of its direction and the balanced intensity of its execution keep the proceedings grounded. The plot is a bit over-the-top but to the director's credit, it remains balanced and believable.<br /><br />This film may be considered an ultra-violent dark film by most people but it is actually very tame when it comes to blood and gore. The proceedings are so well executed that the atmosphere emulates violence and darkness. The very set up and sequences of what happens in each shot creates a lot of tension that people will remember it as a very dark and violent film, that it is in fact gorier and bloodier than it actually is. Park has the hand of an artist and is a true visionary to be able to pull off this sensory manipulation. "Oldboy" has a lot of uncompromising twists and turns.  You will have to keep in mind that Park's films are usually a character study of its main characters.<br /><br />Aside from Park's stellar direction and premise, the film draws its strength from its excellent cast. Choi Min-Sik gives a near-stellar performance as the main character. I remember his haircut that looks almost like a mangled lion with a chopped black mane. His portrayal of a BROKEN everyday man is one of the reasons why "Oldboy" has been elevated to "cult status". The film's final image; Choi's joyful but at the same time, infinitely sorrowful SMILE will forever be remembered by its audiences.  Ji-Tae Yu plays the villain; Woo-Jin, suave and handsome; with his Bond-like physical attributes and a very elegant charisma. Despite his good looks, Ji-Tae Yu has a very menacing presence and does command attention like a deity, with a "mere" mortal as his plaything.<br /><br />One VERY minor (so minor) fault the film may have is that the method of which the actual revenge is executed. The hint of hypnotism may require a tiny suspension of disbelief. Everything plays out so well for the antagonist; we are all expected to believe that he is a genius, with an intellect dedicated to the torture and punishment of one man. He has dedicated 2 decades of his life to his vengeance which may be one of the coldest, if not, certainly the most perverse. However, this very minor flaw is forgivable, because the film is so focused and succeeds in immersing us in its sequences that all we consider are the things that it has done PERFECT.<br />Oldboy explores a moral issue about vengeance; what happens next after you do exact your revenge? If revenge becomes a main focus of your life, what else is there to live for? With Daesu and Lee Woo-Jin, the answer is very different.<br /><br />OLDBOY is PURE contrasting cinematic genius; it is repulsively ugly but at the same time, it is breathtakingly beautiful. It is gut-wrenching but at the same time it is very delicate. It is cold but indeed emotional. It is mind-bending at times and certainly artistic in its execution. With its flair and style, it is a bunch of contradictions that adheres to coherency.<br />Park will not only entertain but make you uncomfortable. It does no other film has done: to entertain at the same time analyzes pure emotional pain. It is TERRIFIC!<br />Highest Possible Recommendation! [ 5- Stars]<br /><br />Recent News: Hollywood will be re-making this film with the director of "Better Luck Tomorrow" at the helm. I was watching MTV when I heard this news; Good or bad? Let's wait and see...</p></br><a href="../users/A13OMT8D4GPIBV.html">A13OMT8D4GPIBV</a><br/><p>Park Chanwook's Oldboy is a masterful achievement.  A great story and an eqaully impressive film.

First do not buy this film expecting to see a martial arts or action packed film because this is not packed it's just the right amount to keep you interested. There's more torture than fighting as you see Oh dae-su seek the ultimate revenge after being kidnapped and held for 15 years and then for some crazy reason he's let go.<br /><br /> By this time your probably thinking Oh dae-su has some bit of control over his life after being released but his napper tells him different. Whenever Oh dae-su thinks he's getting some control he is pulled back like a dog on a leash. He figures out he has not really been released just let out for some air. The napper tells Oh dae-su he released him because he wanted him to know why this was done to him and who did it and he only had 5 days to do so. You think you know who's getting the revenge but you don't really know.<br /><br />This film surpasses anything your thinking about it and the twist makes it worth every penny. I actually jokingly guessed the twist before it came and had the biggest jaw drop ever when I found out I was right, that's how unbelievable the twist is.<br />This film is so unique that you have to see it because there is no way you can find a twist in a movie in America like the one in Oldboy so get ready to be surprised. The actors are on the next level in this violent masterpiece and stop at nothing to make the film perfect. Don't watch this if you have a weak stomach.</p></br><a href="../users/AR37967IAR6ZT.html">AR37967IAR6ZT</a><br/><p>I went to see OLDBOY last night, and I'll be damned if it wasn't the best movie I've seen all year.<br /><br />I went in expecting some Asian-style actioner. Instead, it was dark, twisted, visually interesting, violent and pretty much genius.<br /><br />The plot, which I won't divulge much of here since the joy is in discovering what the movie is about, is excellent. The movie's graphic and intense.<br /><br />OLDBOY is based on this manga, so Edmondson and I were expecting some sort of light, funny, hero-driven, martial arts actioner when we headed to it last night. It's nothing like that. Edmondson kept pointing out that he thought it was funny how I wanted to see a "gritty, Asian revenge thriller" about a guy who is imprisoned in an apartment for 15 years for unknown reasons by unknown people - and then, upon getting out of his prison, tracks down his captors for answers.<br /><br />There were moments of violence where I just kept saying to myself, "Dude ... Dude ...," gripping on to the armrest, for it was intense and incredibly clever. And I don't even say "Dude." It was wicked. It was sick. It was fantastic.<br /><br />Highly, highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A2P49WD75WHAG5.html">A2P49WD75WHAG5</a><br/><p>Based on Garon Tsuchiya's manga, Oldboy is about Oh Dae-su, an ordinary salaryman type, who is held at a police station for being drunk.  Afterwards, he is kidnapped, locked up in a hotel-like room without windows, gassed repeatedly so the room is cleaned and so  he can get a haircut and clean clothes, and kept there for 15 years.  "If they had told me then that it would be fifteen years, would it have been easier to endure....or harder?"  His only contact to the outside world is the TV.  "It's both a clock and a calendar. It's your school, your home, your church, your friend... and your lover<br /><br />It's after being let out and into "life in a bigger prison" that Oh Dae-su's quest really begins.  Who imprisoned him and why?  He is given a cell-phone and a wallet full of money by a scraggly bum, then goes to a sushi restaurant where he meets Mido, a beautiful young woman who takes pity on him and takes him back to her place when he collapses.  It also appears he has been hypnotized during his imprisonment--but why?  His nemesis, a man later identified as Lee Woo-Jin, is quite the mastermind.  When they first confront each other, Lee gives him five days to find out the truth, or he will kill Mido.  If Oh Dae-su wins, Lee promises to kill himself.<br /><br />Through clues of finding out which Chinese restaurant provided him with the same potstickers he ate for 15 years, he finds Mr. Park, the owner of the hotel where he was imprisoned.  It is here that two memorable scenes occur, one a tooth torture scene where he extracts Mr. Park's teeth out with a hammer, all set to Vivaldi's "Winter" section of the Four Seasons.  Using such music in such a scene adds a bit of humor in it.  He then takes on a handful of Park's thugs armed only with a hammer, his fists, and keeps on fighting even though a knife is plunged into his back.  The sardonic smile on his face when he encounters an elevator full of thugs is priceless.  Guess what happens to them?<br /><br />The theme of revenge and Lee Woo-jin's attitude, "Whether it is a grain of sand or a rock, in water they both sink alike" implies that no sin is too small for revenge.  He later tells Oh Dae-su, "Seeking revenge is the best cure for someone who has been hurt.  Try it. ... Once again, revenge is good for your health."  But to quote Hamlet, aye, there's the rub.  "But what happens after you've had your revenge?  I bet that hidden pain probably emerges again."  The whole point is that this isn't about Oh Dae-Su's revenge on Lee Woo-Jin, but vice-versa.  As someone who holds grudges easily, I can easily relate to what Lee says.<br /><br />Oh Dae-Su's introspection in seeing who it was he had offended reveals that every life is far from perfect.  "Study your whole lifetime," he is told by Lee.  But he also realizes that his imprisonment has changed him, as he figures Mido wouldn't like him the way he was before imprisonment.  But there is hope for redemption, as seen in the scene with snow, symbolizing a clean new start.<br /><br />This was actually the second film I'd seen with Choi Min-sik, the first being Shiri, but so far, this is his master performance, a creditable and credible performance as Oh Dae-Su.  He later appears as the villainous Mr. Baek in Lady Vengeance.  Yu Ji-Tae scores well as the devilish but weak Lee Woo-Jin, and has a cameo in LV.  Ditto for Kang Hye-jeong as the cute-as-a-button Mido.  She is a TV reporter in LV.  And Oh Dal-Su (Mr. Park) plays the bakery owner Mr. Chang in LV.<br /><br />The movie's score is another triumph.  Whether it is the upbeat techno beat of the opening shot of Oh Dae-su grabbing onto the suicidal man's tie, the haunting quiet ambience during Oh's fight with Han in Lee Wu-Jin's penthouse, the Godfather-like waltz that is Lee Woo-Jin's theme, and Mido's sad theme with clarinet and strings, the music team scored a big triumph.<br /><br />This is hailed as the best in Park Chan-Wook's trilogy in story-telling, film-making, acting, and techniques.  One of the best films I've seen in awhile.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HII4U9WQ0XUV.html">A2HII4U9WQ0XUV</a><br/><p>Than to run your mouth, remove all doubt, *and* be locked up in a seedy back-alley dungeon, imprisoned for no reason, with no explanation, by an implacable, mysterious, shadowy foe, entirely bent on your destruction and insanity.<br /><br />Such is the fate of our hero Oh Dae-su (Min-sik Choi, in the role of a lifetime): a buffoon, a drunken Korean businessman loaded up on too much booze and a night of excess, busted by the police, booked into jail, urinating in a corner of the police station, barely bailed to freedom by his old friend Joo-hwan---and who, seconds later, on a busy Seoul thoroughfare, outside a phone booth, minutes away from his wife and infant daughter---disappears.<br /><br />Without a trace.<br /><br />Without a trace to his family and friends, perhaps---but certainly not to his tormentors. For Oh Dae-Su awakes in confinement, in what appears to be a seedy flat in a seedier tenement, confined, imprisoned, given no answers, provided food and water, and gassed each night for the Cleaners to make---ahem---'adjustments'.<br /><br />It's enough to drive a sober man stark-raving mad, don't you think?<br /><br />It's even worse that Dae-su, entombed as he is in the guts of the City, cut off from any explanation---why is he here? when can he get out? who has done this? My God, jailer, won't you talk to me?---panicked, hopeless, desolate---is nonetheless in contact with the outside world: through television.<br /><br />Call it his book of days. He sees the days stretch into months, the months stretch into years. He hears the news report of the atrocious, brutal murder of his wife, her throat slashed at the hands of a shadowy brute, his infant daughter whisked away into the protective clutches of anonymous Officialdom.<br /><br />A happy man, one instant: a Prisoner, the next.<br /><br />Years pass, and then the greatest trick of all: Dae-Su is released. Sprung. Baptized atop an office tower, sprung from the womb of an oversized suitcase, left to find his own way, bereft of family, life, place: suspected as the murderer of his wife, years ago. A Man without a face, without a name, without a country. With one thing, and one thing only: Revenge.<br /><br />Oh, and a cell phone, and a wallet full of money, passed to him by a nameless beggar who claims to know nothing: hungry, tired, dispirited, Dae-Su tears through a pack of thugs---all that karate +-practice in his lounge-lizard-prison having paid off handsomely, evidently---checks into a juke-jive, bites the head off a squirming, hapless octopus, and meets a sweet young thing---Mi-Do---who is instantly horrified, and compelled.<br /><br />And then the real fun begins.<br /><br />Now: it would be unfair to say much more about "Oldboy". It is a stark, searing little testament to the power of guerilla filmmaking, a laurel wrapped about the head of its creator, Chun-Wook Park, who has managed to graft high style with a weird kind of cinematic poetry, an elegiac cinematographic high style, married to a sere, haunting, neo-classical soundtrack (with snippets of Vivaldi): all of it builds up to a crescendo that is nothing short of catharsis. It's an exhausting film: it makes demands.<br /><br />The cinematography is its own character here, as is the direction: there is a kind of wild elegance, in the rain-swept streets of Seoul, of the spare interiors, of the weary, craggy, hell-beaten topography of its hero's face, seamed with bewilderment and agony. The battle sequences---there are a number---are kinetic, yes, but for all the high style, feel real: you can feel the skin buckling, the bruises forming up purple-yellow, the sullen exhaustion of the combatants.<br /><br />And beyond and above it all is the central question: what is Vengeance? Who is the Avenger, and what is avenged? The acting---from Choi to Hye-Jeon Kang (Mi-Do), and all the supports---is supple, and completely compelling, adding to the grandeur of this shivery little tale of grue and moral kurare: ultimately the big reveal is more devastating for its precision---its preciseness, its measured planning---than anything you might have expected.<br /><br />Brace yourself.<br /><br />JSG</p></br><a href="../users/A18MBO1U4DPY20.html">A18MBO1U4DPY20</a><br/><p>Old Boy was the first Korean film I have ever seen. I must say I am completely taken aback by the concept. I've lost count of the number of times in this film when I experienced EXTREME GOOSEBUMP SYNDROME.<br /><br />I know I will never watch a film like Old Boy again but I do know it will reflect in my future conversations. I am not even ashamed of downloading this film. Atleast I watched it.<br /><br />This film is about revenge and has more suspense filled raw staggering control over the viewer than I can possibly comprehend in my little review. The story is about as unique as the design of the wonders of the world. The movie covers a lot of aspects of a man's life. What value does time have? Do we really forget everything we know? Do elevators actually have passwords for the penthouse right on top? Do men actually have a remote control controlling their life support?<br /><br />Now now, I know how vague and random I might sound but Old Boy actually did this to me. It is the most potent display of human thought I have seen in a long time. I remember watching "Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind" and being disappointed not by the story but by the frail enactment. "Old Boy" contains more thought and hardcore action than quite a few movies put together. It leaves most behind in terms of quantity of mind.<br /><br />I don't want to start with the actors and storylines because I do not want to ruin it for you.My favourite character in the film was the villain.The movie seems way ahead of it's time. At first, the subtitles didnt really help but soon I got used to it and by the end, they only helped more and more.<br /><br />Old Boy keeps becoming more interesting as it grows. When it ended, I had my hand on my mouth and my eyes just about as wide as to make me look uglier. Anyhow, watch it to feed that demon in you that wants to watch absolute trendsetting imaginative plots. Hope you know what I mean. You will.</p></br><a href="../users/A3U56M0Y8LYO6J.html">A3U56M0Y8LYO6J</a><br/><p>At the core of Chan-wook Park's "Oldboy" is a revenge plot that is unbelievably twisted.  Discovering what that revenge plot is and why it has been perpetrated will perturb even the most hardened viewers of disturbing films.<br /><br />Dae-su Oh (Min-sik Choi) heads home to deliver a birthday present to his daughter after being bailed out of jail.  He is kidnapped on his way home and spends the next fifteen years of his life alone and imprisoned.  He has no idea where he is, who has kidnapped him, or why he is being held prisoner.  Then one day, Dae-su is freed for no apparent reason.  With vengeance burning within him, he immediately embarks on a quest to discover the identity of his former captor.<br /><br />"Oldboy" is not a film to watch with the family.  Rest assured that this is not a warm and fuzzy Disney production.  "Oldboy" is a film that takes no prisoners and refuses to adhere to any restrictions on the presentation of its content.  Park does a marvelous job of letting the story's revelations unfold slowly in order to keep the tension building.  He also infuses "Oldboy" with a visual flair and energy that distinctively sets his film apart from earlier entries in the revenge genre.  The performances are stunning with Choi's bravura performance being the stuff of nightmares.  Ji-tae Yu as the mysterious Woo-jin Lee and Hye-jeong Kang as the sympathetic Mi-do are also excellent.  Check your expectations at the door and fall under the spell of "Oldboy" if you are not the queasy type.  You will see things you have never seen before and likely will never want to see again.</p></br><a href="../users/A3N6GAJTEOF4MO.html">A3N6GAJTEOF4MO</a><br/><p>A movie driven by madness is the shortest and best way I can sum up this film as it seems to be a plot focusing around which man can be the most insane; the one seeking revenge against his captor or the one who has done the capturing. I will need to be careful as the way the film's structured, in order to really tell anything of the story, I may have to spoil a few important moments of the movie so you have been warned.<br /><br />The story focuses around a man known as Dea-Su who, at the start of the film is seen drunk, being held at a police station waiting for his friend to pick him up and take him home. Suddenly Dae-Su goes missing and wakes up a few days later locked in a room with no knowledge or where he is or why he's there. He is locked in captivity for 15 years and is released without warning. Driven mad by his own solitary confinement, upon release he immediately sets upon a mission to find his captor and discover the reason for his imprisonment.<br /><br />While out he encounters a young girl named Mi-do, a sushi chef who takes pity on him and brings him into her home as he has nowhere else to go. Dae-Su, discovers that his captor is an old school friend by the name Lee Woo-Jin and the reason behind the imprisonment is that Dae-Su never kept his mouth shut and spread a rumour that destroyed Woo-Jin's family. Driven by the passion for revenge against Dae-Su, he looks to destroy Dae-Su in the same way that the rumours destroyed him.<br /><br />The film itself takes on a comic book style of storytelling, darting from one scene to the next whilst consistently narrating the story to explain exactly what's going on. The character of Dae-Su is a fairly complicated one, but turns into a sort of anti-hero movie as he moves from one depraved and sadistic act to the next in order to find the answer to the question of why. Park Chan-wook does a splendid job of directing this and it's something you can really get into, once you have become used to following the subtitles and the on-screen action simultaneously.<br /><br />The acting is superb, especially that of Choi Min-Sik (Dae-Su) as he portrays a man driven mad by his captivity and his own passion for revenge superbly. The main antagonist, Lee Woo-Jin, played by Yu Ji-Tae is played so well, the character itself is as disturbing as I'm sure he was intended to appear. Almost too cool and calm to be the villain of the piece, I found myself expecting something more behind the whole scheme as he certainly did not initially appear to be the man who would be behind this torture of Dae-Su.<br /><br />Overall, this is simply a masterpiece of Asian Cinema and it is unfortunate, in a way, that the only real way we would get movies this masterful in the west, is if they were independent films that would ultimately not get the exposure they would deserve because the premise and outcome of the film aren't commercial. The worst news possible, relating to this film, is that there was a planned American remake and would undoubtedly poison the brilliance of this absolute masterpiece by putting a pointlessly optimistic spin on the story. Thankfully, it doesn't look like this will be happening, so I would strongly recommend this for the purposes of witnessing brilliant storytelling very rarely seen.</p></br><a href="../users/A3JLOIXFM75QNV.html">A3JLOIXFM75QNV</a><br/><p>To describe any part of this film would be to ruin it, so I will only say that it is not something that you see every day. This is not your average and straightforward tale of revenge. It is brutal, shocking and so twisted, that it would certainly turn some people off if they knew what they were getting in to.<br /><br />I suppose what I can say is it revolves around a man, who without warning or explanation, is held prisoner for 12 years and just as suddenly-he is let go. From then he has 5 days to find out why this happened to him. That is all you need to know.<br /><br />Visually, the film looks very cool. It is bold in color, sometimes grainy and always interesting. I found the subtitles easy to follow, which I was glad of as some films, it just goes by way too quickly. The plot was easy enough to follow, even though you really don't know much of what is going on. Only in those last tense minutes do you get the sense of what you are witnessing.<br /><br />Though I liked this film very much, looking back, I have to say that the plot is almost too elaborate for the big reveal ending. I can't go into depth here since I don't wish to spoil anything, but after I finished viewing it, I just thought that it just seemed a bit over the top. Also, I have no idea why this is sometimes labeled as a horror film- it is not. It is very adult however, with plently of violence and sexual content. I found this to be more of a drama than anything, especially after the end. People will have varying opinions regarding this film, though if you have an open mind and like a great mystery, you may enjoy Oldboy.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>Oldboy (Chanwook Park, 2003)<br /><br />I'm not sure why, but I was expecting Oldboy to be a far more violent movie than it actually is; those of you who got the same impression and haven't yet seen it, be aware that while it's a very odd film-- very odd indeed-- if you go in expecting Ichi the Killer, you're going to be disappointed on some level.<br /><br />We open seeing Oh Dae-Su (Sympathy for Lady Vengeance's Min-Sik Choi) drunk in a police station. (Watching the DVD's sole deleted scene, an extended version of this opening scene, will both help it make a lot more sense and give you a strong appreciation for the editor's job.) His best friend, Cheol-woon (Dal-su Oh, also in Sympathy for Lady Vengeance) comes to get him, and they stop at a pay phone on the way so Oh Dae-Su can call his wife and daughter (whose birthday it is) to let them know he's on his way home; as his friend wishes Oh Dae-Su's daughter a happy birthday, Oh Dae-Su vanishes. (I'm being a bit more expository here than usual, because it took me about thirty minutes to understand how the opening scenes connected to the rest of the film.) Oh Dae-Su wakes up in a prison-- though it's not by any means a normal prison-- and there's an extended scene about his day-to-day life there, during which he slowly goes insane. Fifteen years after he is first imprisoned, he gets out, vowing revenge on those who imprisoned him-- as soon as he can figure out why they did it. Think Kafka, but with more claw hammers and less existentialism.<br /><br />The best thing about Asian mysteries, aside from the obvious fact (obvious, anyway, to those who watch them) that unlike Hollywood, the Asians assume their audiences have a modicum of intelligence, is that Asian mysteries are usually surprising when the big reveal comes about. I don't know whether this is a function of me being an American watching them; perhaps, if I'd grown up in the culture, I'd watch Oxide Pang, Chanwook Park, and Kyoshi Kurosawa films and be as depressed as I am attempting to watch J. S. Cardone films as an American. I don't think so, though; the simple fact is that Park, who also wrote the screenplay, has come up with a truly twisted mystery, with layer upon layer of surprises just waiting to jump up and punch the viewer in the face. It's not handled in amateur fashion, either; it's one of those situations where you never quite get used to the punches, because each one is just that much harder than the last. And Park varies the delivery methods, as well (the infamous clawhammer scene is so out of place in the early stages of the film that it comes as a shock, but still doesn't feel as if it's actually out of place thanks to Oh Dae-Su's internal monologues. That's good filmmaking right there), so the movie is, while not a continual revelation, a constant guessing-game. It's not only the plot that will keep you watching.<br /><br />I should probably warn you that if you've got a weak stomach for things that normally gross people out, the big reveal in this flick (and Oh Dae-Su's wonderful reaction to it in the film's final scenes) is probably going to give you the weirds. But then I get the feeling that was Park's intention. Me, I was just impressed that Park had done such a great job of setting it up, and I'd completely missed it. This is really fun stuff. ****</p></br><a href="../users/A2UKC6QFG9L5GV.html">A2UKC6QFG9L5GV</a><br/><p>Interesting, but all reviews that I read of "Oldboy" either praise the movie or decry it to the limit. I think it's already a good sign when a film doesn't leave everybody indifferent. Actually I have mixed feelings about it. On one hand I liked "Oldboy" for being rather unusual, on the other - there were many complex things difficult for comprehension. Partly because the storyline is intricate, and partly because of asian mentality which is sometimes rather sophisticated (at least for me).<br /><br />The plot is flawless and that's a very good thing, because you don't have to say to yourself all the time: "That's not possible, I'm not buying it". There were some things and characters' actions that seemed unmotivated, but again I tend to explain it with mentalities distinctions, I don't think those were the plot holes.<br /><br />Anyway even if you are not going to like "Oldboy" you'll have to admit the film is different. Some say it reminds "Ichi the Killer" (which I haven't seen), to me it seemed reminiscent of "Memento", they share the same mood of despair and gloominess.<br /><br />"Oldboy" is very stylish and well-crafted, every scene and every shot look like they're on their place, it's very elaborate and beautiful (although there are many violent moments). Many scenes became instantly famous among cinephiles, like the corridor fight scene, that lasts several minutes and is done with one take. Especially I'd like to mention brilliant music which is the third part (or even the half) of film's success.<br /><br />I'm sure I'm going to watch "Oldboy" for the second time to clear certain things out, but after the first viewing I was left with the impression of something fresh and innovative, which appeares rather often lately when watching asian (and Korean in particular) movies. For one thing I'm sure, you won't get bored, if you decide to see this.</p></br><a href="../users/A39AWL2FKWDFK6.html">A39AWL2FKWDFK6</a><br/><p>Chan-wook Park's amazing flick "Oldboy" is a modern day Shakespearean type saga of deceit, vengeance and reprisal played out against a current South Korean setting.<br /><br />Oh Dae-su, played amazingly by Min-sik Choi, is a womanizing Seoul businessman, husband and father of a young daughter who is inexplicably confined in a private prison cell for 15 years.  In his solitude his only attachment to the outside world is a TV.  While watching he learns of the brutal murder of his wife, orphaning his child.  From that point he musters all his power to sharpen himself both physically and mentally for revenge against those who immersed him in this predicament.<br /><br />After being released he embarks on a blood thirsty campaign of vindication.  While doing so he becomes befriended to a young female sushi chef Mi-do played by an innocent Hye-jeong Kang.  They eventually fall in love and she supports him in his quest.  Soon after his released he is outfitted with a cell phone and wads of cash by his tormentor.  It is established that he is to be given 5 days to ascertain the reason for his incarceration by his captor or the life of Mi-do will be forfeited.<br /><br />This last part of the flick chronicles Oh dae-su's voyage of discovery as to the genesis of the deeds that caused his plight.  What is revealed is a stunning sequence of events leading to an unpredictable and ironic conclusion to an extremely well crafted and written plot that is superbly directed by Park.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FCWRSICTO2AH.html">A1FCWRSICTO2AH</a><br/><p>What a ride!  "Oldboy," has been labeled a revenge flick - which it certainly is.  It also has all the classic trappings of Noir, which may elevate things a bit, since such careful attention to noir elements reflects a careful construction behind the carnage.  Of course, you couldn't tell that from watching the first twenty minutes or so - which is humorous and completely different in tone when contrasted with what follows.  Still, if you watch carefully, the seeds of the story, and the fate of Oh Dae-Su (the movie's anti-hero), are all there.  The movie's "secret" or mystery really isn't that big of a secret, and if you've watched noir flicks at all or have read your Jim Thompson, the characters' fates are not such a surprise. Shocking -- always, no matter how many times you've seen or read it, but not a surprise.  But I'm not revealing anything more here.<br /><br />The movie has loads of style (which is probably what attracted Tarantino's interest), and the story unfolds nicely - in a very pulpish way, while Oh Dae-Su, the whole time offers up pithy existential nuggets of hard won wisdom.  The movie starts out almost as a comedy, turns surreal (Salvador Dali weird) as Oh Dae-Su is mysteriously imprisoned for fifteen years.  Then it shifts gears into grindhouse action, and closes with a Sergio Leone like flourish - operatic, over the top and totally cool.  Probably the only movie I've seen that believably shows a man fighting 15 others - with a hammer.  It was like the Thriller from Manilla - kung fu version. Grueling. Brutal. A must see flick.</p></br><a href="../users/A13DQTXG02HZC1.html">A13DQTXG02HZC1</a><br/><p>It's a rarity nowadays to find a movie that would captivate you from beginning till the end.  This movie did exactly just that.  The setting was mostly grim, on a rainy day, in a cell, in a room with fluoro-green colour, on the top floor of an office building, and so forth.  It truly excelled in putting the audience on the edge and enabling the audience to feel the pain and grosteque that the people were going through.  The movie didn't intend to have the audience empathise or feeling sorry for the main character who was imprisoned for fifteen years.  Rather, we were more intrigued to find the cause of imprisonment.  Naturally, the ending was as disturbing as the movie was and it didn't disappoint.  If you  think that the ending would be the imprisoned main character gotten his final revenge from his captor, you would be hugely disappointed because the theme of this movie would be running off the tangent in every sense of the way.  When classical music was playing whilst the torture was going on, it gave this movie a haunting but lasting beauty that would imprint in audience's mind for many years to come.  By no means, I'm making a comparison here but if you have watched "Fight Club" before starring Norton and Pitt, you know what you are to expect from "Old Boy".  As a word of percaution, this movie is not for the faint-hearted.  I squirmed quite a few times in this instance.  Highly recommended and totally deserved the accolade that it gotten from the Cannes Festival two years before.</p></br><a href="../users/A457S8SW690NM.html">A457S8SW690NM</a><br/><p>Best Foreign movie EVER!<br /><br />Oldboy is a Korean film, obviously made on a very short budget that is nothing short of brilliant. It has been compared to Tarantino movies and may I ask: what's up with that? Sure I enjoy some Tarantino flicks but this has nothing to do with them. The pervasive language label on the back is in all fairness a bunch of b.s. Mr. F is barely used.<br /><br />There isn't that much violence in the movie but when there is, it's intense. The violence is there for a purpose: for example, one scene is a sacrifice and another is vengeance. The one brawl the movie has is great! The protagonist (don't know his name) and his hammer makes these 15 men's lives a living hell.<br /><br />Yet there were very few fights which surprised me. But the ones there are..are great!<br /><br />On the other hand this movie lives off of the ingeniously woven plot. The violence is only a product of that, only used with a purpose. A man, preparing for his daughter's birthday is abducted and thrown in a room. He is framed for the murder of his wife and spends 15 years of his life there. Who did it? Why? This will all be found out in due time. When he is released, he's given a suit and a cell phone where his abductor calls him. He meets a young woman and falls for her. She helps him, shows him love, and helps him get revenge. But things are more complicated than that. And if you want to see a twist, the huge one at the end will knock you flat. It will haunt you and maybe bring tears to your eyes. The "sacrifice" is the true meaning of love, and it shows the good nature of our hero. This hero isn't only a but kicking bad a#$ like Tarantino would have made him out as, no...He is someone who really knows about love and is such a courageous person that he will do anything for that person. And this is what American films lack, a moral. And this twist isn't like the dark crazy ones in Amercan cinema, it is an unusual one, an unexpected one. It's a touching tale, a haunting tale, a sad tale. It will make you think a lot and behind all of this violence and revenge is love and that love is the true meaning behind this ingenious tale.<br /><br />It is hands down the best of 2005 and more than that even!</p></br><a href="../users/A2VD2D1QHCMF9Q.html">A2VD2D1QHCMF9Q</a><br/><p>This was an extremely difficult film to watch.  It starts off Kafkaesque, and even from the beginning it is very hard, if not impossible, to know what is fantasy and what is real.<br /><br />Oh Dae-su has been inmprisoned for 15 years and he has no idea why, or who has done this to him.  Upon his release, he finds a young woman, Mi-do, who is extemely attentive to him.  The rest of the movie centers around these two people and uncovering the secrets which led them to each other, and in identifying and dealing with his nemesis.<br /><br />In particular, the relationip betweeen the young woman, Mi-do, and the protagonist, Oh Dae-su, does not appear credible, but this and other happenings which appear to be unexplainable come together at the end.<br /><br />The musical score is beautiful, and forms a counter-point of sorts with the violence of the film.<br /><br />There is a lot of violence, and some of it is so extreme that I did not know if the violence was meant to be real, or was it a fantasy, a dream in the mind of Oh Dae-su.<br /><br />While the ending ties most of the movie together, you have to have a strong stomach to get there.<br /><br />This has to be one of the strangest films that I have recently seen, and although I finally came away with a sense of satisfaction with it, it is too intense, too difficult a film for me to recommend to anyone I know.</p></br></body></html>

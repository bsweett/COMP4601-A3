It definitely deserves to be ranked among the top 100 films that I've ever seen.  Director Joshua Marston has put together a well paced and riveting story concerning three young Colombian women who agree to smuggle drugs into the United States.  They do this by swallowing balloons filled with the illegal contraband.  And yes, it is dangerous and not exactly the best thing to do to one's digestive system.  Catalina Sandino Moreno is excellent as the poverty stricken and pregnant Maria who is unmarried and lacking any viable future prospects.  Carla (Patricia Rae) and Blanca (Yenny Paola Vega) are also in dire straits.  Things go tragically wrong and their lives will be changed forevermore.  New York City is a long way from their backward small towns.  The inevitable cultural shock is just the beginning of their troubles.  You will care about what happens to them.  My only complaint is that the title is somewhat misleading.  Religion plays virtually no role for any of the characters which doesn't quite ring true.  Nonetheless, Maria Full of Grace is a must see film.  It is well worth a couple hours of your precious time.</p></br><a href="../users/A6ADO7B6FUVN.html">A6ADO7B6FUVN</a><br/><p>Maria Full of Grace is an extraordinary story depicting a young Colombian woman's struggle for hope, dreams, and a better life, which was written and directed by Joshua Marston.  The film is disturbing and dark and it may be fiction, but it certainly provides some haunting images of the dark nature of humanity.  For some, this is maybe one of the best films this year--and it may very well be one of the best films.<br /><br />Colombian people work hard in order to sustain life.  The shifts are long and grueling without unions that see that they employees are being treated humanely and are paid an amount worth their work.  Instead the companies set the rules, which are in enforced by foremen that could more or less be compared to slave drivers as the workers are paid substantially less than poverty wage.  These slave drivers constantly remind the workers that they must fill their quota in order to get paid and often provide false information in regards to the company profits.  The 17 year old Maria Alvarez (Catalina Sandino Moreno) has such a job at a company where she cuts long-stemmed roses where she constantly cuts her fingers while being harassed by the foreman about her production.  The day comes when Maria finally has had enough of this work and she quits as she was not allowed to visit the bathroom when she felt sick.<br /><br />Shortly after Maria has quit her job she enters a pharmacy with her mother and sister as her sister's son has taken ill.  The mother demands Maria's pay as they must pay for the medicine for the little boy, but Maria wonders why she has to give away her hard earned money to her sister to which her mother comments, "Why do you have to be so difficult?"  In anger Maria hands the money to her mother as she mentions that she quit her job.  After some discussion the mother says, "At least it's a decent job.", and Maria coldly responds "Please, what's decent about it?"  Yes, Maria is difficult as she does not comply to the socially learned values by being a good girl and following the patriarchal rules of the Catholic Church as she comes from a one parent home.  However, Maria's rebellion seems to originate from her perceptive view of the Colombian society and the injustice within it as she noticed her unjust treatment at the flower company, unlike her mother and sister that simply accept their place in poverty.<br /><br />Discovering the absence of two periods cautions Maria to suspect that she is pregnant.  Maria informs the father, Juan (Wilson Guerrero), about the probable pregnancy to which he responds that they have to get married.  Again Maria rebels as she asks if Juan loves her, but he cannot say those words.  Resentfully Maria displays her dislike for Juan's lack of affection, and decides that a marriage will never take place, which is against the Catholic values she has been brought up to cherish.<br /><br />Maria dreams and hopes of something better so while being uneducated and standing pregnant on her own two feet she begins to seek alternative means of making a living.  Through a friend Maria meets Franklin who introduces her into becoming a mule.  A mule is a drug trafficking person who transports several dozen pellets full of potent illegal drugs in their stomach.  If one pellet breaks it will lead to certain death.  Thus, becoming a mule means that what is inside the stomach of the mule is more important to the criminals than the life of the person carrying the drugs.  Knowing this, Maria begins rehearsing the swallowing of pellets in order to prepare for her drug trafficking trip to New York, which could be the door to a better life.<br /><br />Maria Full of Grace is strong film that clearly opens up a door that will let out several social issues as it also sends a strong political message.  The drug trafficking is visually revolting and nauseating, and will probably lead to emotional turmoil within the audience as they follow Maria and the other mules experience.  Cerebrally the story is much more horrifying in regards to how people are treated as they are willing to go to great lengths to put themselves in such danger.  The film has some similarities with Lukas Moodysson's Lilja 4-ever (2002) where a teenage girl is left in Estonia by her mother who immigrates to United States while the girl is being lured into sex slavery in Sweden.  Both films depict a teenager trying to find a better life for themselves as they fly to a new country under illegal circumstances.<br /><br />The sadness that Maria Full of Grace provides is not in the film, but in it's depiction of what the reality is for many people who take these risks.  Catalina Sandino Moreno does a brilliant job in highlighting the sad truth by providing a raw and poignant performance as Maria.  This performance offers an authentic perspective on the emotional suffering a dangerous journey can cause as Maria is forced into situations that could possibly be the end of her and her family's lives.  Marston's direction elevates the genuine atmosphere as each scene simply brings a visual impression of Maria's mere existence as she makes mistakes to which she quickly adapts using her street smarts.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>Maria Full of Grace (Joshua Marston, 2004)<br /><br />I find it odd that this is the third "foreign" film I've reviewed in the past month with an American director, but encouraging as well; Americans are often disparaged for having, shall we say, our own unique take on world events (that usually boils down to "America, [censored for Amazon consumption] yeah!"). And none of the three (Chris Smith's The Pool, Cary Fukunaga's Sin Nombre, and Joshua Marston's Maria Full of Grace) seem to take that provincial "oh, my, look at the interesting natives" approach that's been endemic in American film since Nanook of the North. Obviously, being American myself, and not well-traveled, my main experience of Goa, Mexico, and Colombia, respectively, comes from the media put out by those countries (the novels, the movies, etc.), but going on those, it does seem to me that these filmmakers are trying to look at their subjects from as much a native perspective as they can. That said, it seems that Maria Full of Grace is the least successful of these, in that regard; it focuses on one narrow piece of Colombian life before transferring its action to New York City. On the other hand, looked at just as a film, it is the most successful of the three for precisely that reason; Marston has a story and he's interested in telling it without the details getting in the way.<br /><br />Maria (Che's Catalina Sandino Moreno in her screen debut) is a Colombian teenager whose meager pay stripping the thorns from roses goes towards keeping her entire family fed and clothed. After an altercation with her boss, she quits the job in a fit of pique (and rightfully so), but that leaves her family with no income. Given the choice, she opts for making a lot of money very easily: she becomes a drug mule, as does her best friend Blanca (Yenny Paola Vega in her only screen appearance to date). The first half of the film covers this, along with the two of them befriending another mule, Lucy (Guilied Lopez, another with no other credits), getting loaded up with the drugs, and then heading to New York. The second half of the film is Maria in New York, where things go wrong, as things like this are wont to do, and she finds herself adrift, with her only contacts in the city Lucy's sister, whom she's never met, and the inconstant Blanca.<br /><br />The movie has been hailed many times over for its gritty realism, but no one focuses on the more intriguing idea that this is actually noir. Think about it. There are no good guys in this film (with the possible exception of Don Fernando, a helpful New Yorker, but he is more reporter than participant in the film's events), only bad guys and badder guys. The protagonist is somewhat hapless, has a more hapless sidekick, and finds herself in way over her head from the get-go. Every time Maria attempts to do what she thinks is the right thing, it goes horribly wrong, sometimes more horribly than others. Is that not the essence of noir? Even the ending, which is far more ambivalent than one would expect (noir rarely, if ever, leaves room for hope), is not the kind that normally caps off a straight drama.<br /><br />On the downside, however, is my wife's first comment after she'd thought it over for a while. "Have we seen that before? I don't remember seeing it, but I knew certain scenes before I actually saw them." No, we hadn't seen it before, but it's an understandable reaction; there is very little new here. There is artistry in the production (I originally wrote "production in the artistry" and it seemed right until I reread it, which should tell you something), and a lot of very good acting from people who are not (or were not at the time) actors. But if you experience deja vu while viewing, don't be surprised. ***</p></br><a href="../users/A1TEMNM9ZEOLJ6.html">A1TEMNM9ZEOLJ6</a><br/><p>A PC movie that is actually good, for once. The phenomenon of drug 'mules' from places like Colombia probably doesn't get enough attention. I imagine this is still going on every day. This film shows the difficult lives of immigrants, as well as the cheapness of life in places where it's difficult to earn money. The focus is narrow here, but that's an asset to the filmmaking.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>I got into a heated debate with a friend the other day about the difference between subtlety and lifelessness.  He got all up in arms when I labeled Ed Harris's nomination for `The Truman Show' a joke.  Now as many of you know, I love the movie, but I felt that Harris really added nothing to the film.  He was less subtle and more hollow.  So, when he said that I wouldn't appreciate subtleness if it hit me in the face I rattled off this little film and told him to bask in the glory that is Catalina Sandino Moreno and her brilliant use of subtle forcefulness.  So, we watched the film together, and my adoration of her performance was deepened and I think I made my point.<br /><br />This performance may be quiet, but it is in no way shape or form `hollow'.<br /><br />`Maria, Llena Eres de Gracia' is a brilliant film, truly, from start to finish one of the most honest and raw films I have seen in recent years.  The film feels so natural, which only adds to the emotional destruction the audience goes through while watching it.  There is nothing that feels Hollywoodized or embellished in that overly dramatic heavy handed way that most films are done today.  It is simply raw and gritty and truth; pure truth.<br /><br />Here we are told the story of young Maria, a seventeen-year-old Columbian who lives with her mother and grandmother, her sister and her young nephew.  She works hard every day dethroning flowers only to pay more than her share at home.  When Maria winds up pregnant she is faced with a decision.  Her boyfriend isn't the marrying type, and her job is less that satisfactory so she decides to leave town and try to find work elsewhere.  That is when she is given the opportunity to make some quick and `easy' money.  She is asked to become a mule, swallowing pellets of heroine and smuggling them into the states.  She accepts, and her harrowing journey is one of danger, fear and ultimately self awakening.<br /><br />The film, much like Moreno, is very subtle.  There is nothing here that is over-the-top or any mere scene that begs for your attention the way that most films produced today do.  The story is told in a very focused yet very earnest way.  We see everything (almost everything) in a very point-blank manor.  Nothing is glamorized, nothing is sugar-coated; nothing is depicted as anything other than reality.  I think I first realized this when Maria has to wash off pellets after she went to the bathroom and then re-swallow them in the airplane bathroom.<br /><br />Fearless.<br /><br />I want to take a minute to applaud the Academy for nominating Moreno back in 2004 for Best Lead Actress.  I often give the Academy a hard time for nominating gimmicky and obvious performances that take no imagination and really require no stretch of talent, but in 2004 they nominated five VERY worthy performances (albeit handing possibly the least worthy the award).  Catalina Sandino Moreno delivers such a spellbindingly pure performance, never reaching too far and coming off as forced but always keeping her characters innocence and naivety a central part of her performance.  Maria is sincere and genuine, yet confused and determined.  This reads beautifully on the screen.  She is gives such a radiant performance, one that is nuanced to perfection and such a dynamic force without being abrupt and outlandish.<br /><br />First time actress Moreno (yes, this is her DEBUT performance) and newcomer writer/director Joshua Marston (he had one credit under his belt before this) are a brilliant team who mesh so well with one another to create a film that reaches the heart and stirs the emotions and will remain utterly unforgettable.  Watching Maria grow as a person throughout this treacherous journey may be hard to take, but in the end the reward is beautiful beyond words.</p></br><a href="../users/A9TG2NFA614S9.html">A9TG2NFA614S9</a><br/><p>A drug mule is a human being who agrees to, or is coerced into swallowing a large number of latex drug pellets filled with cocaine in order to smuggle the illicit narcotics into the United States. The movie tells how a group of women out of desperation become mules. It is a degrading, deeply dehumanizing, dangerous thing to do. If a pellet ruptures and the drugs get loose in the body, they can easily cause death. This small indie movie makes this experience human, tragic, and intimate to moviegoers. It carefully details the technique as the women practice swallowing whole grapes.<br /> Maria, a beautiful, strong-willed woman chooses to be part of this very dangerous drug trafficking scheme. She is pregnant, terrified of being discovered, and feels trapped. She has lost her job in a fresh flower factory stripping the thorns and leaves off stems. The irony is that Colombia exports both flowers and cocaine. At one point Maria in New York passes a flower stand selling imported flowers.<br /> The focus in this film is on women. It has good direction and fine acting. The ordinary scenes in Colombia and in New York City seem very authentic, realistic. The plight of these women is made very urgent and tragedy strikes in one case. It's a very affecting movie that documents the seriousness of this kind of crime that turns human beings into mules. Their bodies are used as containers, vessels in a vicious smuggling racket. Many will find it to be a devastating, instructive film.</p></br><a href="../users/ATXL536YX71TR.html">ATXL536YX71TR</a><br/><p>I have always said that HBO Films KNOWS how to effectively and rivetingly tell a story that is poignant and unforgettable without resorting to all kinds of gimmicks and splashy techniques.This is a crowning achievement for HBO and MARIA FULL OF GRACE delivers the goods (pun intended)in a taught and tense 101 minutes of well calculated story telling with real character angst.<br />Maria Salazar,supremely portrayed by Catalina Moreno,wants to get "out of dead-end Dodge"-here,it's Colombia,South America.From the outset of this film, Maria shows her feistiness and tenacity to speak up to her boss,her family and her boyfriend making her the perfect candidate for a decision that she will make that will alter her life forever.But this is not your usual situation faced by a two-month pregnant seventeen year old who wants a new life! She meets Franklin who sets her up as a "mule", a stubborn woman who has the courage and composure to swallow over sixty balloons of heroin and deliver them in her belly to New York City.The narrative never allows you to agree or quite disagree with her decision.She is young,she is desperate, and she honestly does not fully understand the immense risk she is taking.That is what makes this film so compelling and the character of Maria so rich;we simply cannot judge her.<br />The process of swallowing the drugs will make you wince and cower.The camera sneaks from face to face aboard the New York bound plane which also has three other Colombian "mules" on board.Your palms will sweat and you will feel the tension that these girls undergo.What happens next is up to you to find out.<br />No small wonder this film was so popular at the 2004 Film Festivals with it's numerous wins.It also received a Golden Globe and Academy Award nomination.<br />The film is in Spanish with very readable subtitles.The commentary by writer/director Jonathan Marston is insightful and fluid.The VHS tape is also excellent for purchase.<br />Very Highly Recommended!</p></br><a href="../users/A1OS2HX2CWQIC7.html">A1OS2HX2CWQIC7</a><br/><p>The subject depicted in this film is hardly uncommon: an enterprising Colombian decides to work as a drug mule to escape the tedium of of work as an unskilled laborer and make a good profit. The individual in question swallows a large number of carefully-wrapped pellets containing either cocaine or heroin in order to smuggle them into the United States undetected. If all goes well, the transaction is successful and payment is tendered in exchange for the mule's defecated cargo. If not, a worst-case scenario might involve a long prison term or death when one of the pellets ruptures inside the mule's stomach.<br /><br />If any other film has ever explored the duties of drug mules as its' primary subject matter, I haven't seen it. That's surprising, considering that these people are an essential part of the business and so many movies concerning the drug trade have been produced. This would have been a very easy subject to trivialize as a flashy actioner or a tiresome political exercise, but director Joshua Marston wrote and directed this film as a straightforward drama that spares no details.<br /><br />While the entire cast is impressive, Moreno's performance justifies the enormous praise that's been lavished upon it. It's very rare to see a newcomer perform a role with naturalistic conviction, especially when said performance is reinforced with such effortless charm. That Moreno possesses what must be the purest, most pastoral beauty that I've seen onscreen in years doesn't exactly detract from her screen presence.<br /><br />Marston accomplishes quite a lot with a small budget, almost giving this microproduction the polish of a major feature. Budget constraints are mostly relegated to a limited narrative that focuses entirely on the story from Maria's perspective. Perhaps 60% of the film consists of close-up shots of Moreno; since she's more than easy on the eyes and her delivery is flawless, this really isn't a problem. The tension and dramatic force of this tumultuous story is never dulled by unnecessary sentimental flourishes.<br /><br />The clever visual metaphor of the theatrical poster and video cover isn't depicted in the film, and that's just as well. Nevertheless, few other promotional materials have ever caught my eye as these have. See how much can be done with good photography, a pretty face and thoughtful post-Catholic sensibilities?</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>"Maria Full of Grace" is an interesting examination of one aspect of the international drug trade.  It concerns itself with the exploitation of young Colombian girls by drug dealers who<br /><br /> employ them as human mules to transport their heroin to the U.S.  What seems like easy money to these impressionable impoverished young women turns out to be perilous as they make the trek with these balloons full of deadly drugs lodged in their stomaches.  The film's primary focus is on Maria Alvarez(Catalina Sandino Moreno) a seventeen year-old pregnant girl who tires of her job as a flower cutter in a rustic Colombian town living with her extended family of single mothers.  What initially seems glamorous soon takes on ominous overtones.  The film takes place in a matter of a few days, however, with the potentially life-threatening experiences that Maria endures her demeanor takes on what seems like years.  Moreno more than earns her recent Oscar nomination for a performance of great subtlety.  She is more than up to the demands of the intricasies of the changes that Maria's character goes through.  Credit also to director Joshua Marston for an enthralling study of what is potentially sentational material but delivers it in a non-exploitative manner.</p></br><a href="../users/A1PASRZ81DY9C.html">A1PASRZ81DY9C</a><br/><p>Viewed: 4/07<br />Rate: 9<br /><br />4/07: I hadn't heard of the picture Maria Full of Grace until I spotted the title in a DVD movie book with reviews and ratings. The review was favorable, and I shelved the title on my list of movies to see. It's been there for some while until I finally spotted it in a local library. I hadn't known the story yet until watching the picture. When the first mention of the city Bogota showed up, I thought it was obviously going to be a story about drugs. When it was, I was right until I realized where the picture will lead me. It's a quite astounding story, and a wonderfully made picture at that. Its drawback is that it doesn't feel realistic enough. Nonetheless, the performances throughout the film are outstanding and outstanding. Catalina Sandino Moreno carried the film all the way from start to end. Maria Full of Grace painted a somber picture of girls who swallow pellets of drugs. When I say pellets, I mean the size of meatballs with cocaine in them. When I say pellets of drugs, that's in the vicinity of seventy of them. Sounds like your worst case of digestive system nightmare. And yes, it is. Aside from that, the walk-through of the young girl's life was well-appreciated, self-paced, and absorbing. I was pleased with the two sides of the story: Colombia and New York. Both were handled extremely well with the same level of excellence. That New York side was rather heightened with fear, anxiety, and suspense. All in all, since it does not glorify the surroundings like City of God, Maria Full of Grace is a very impressive picture.</p></br><a href="../users/A36EW68H08UOCS.html">A36EW68H08UOCS</a><br/><p>What type of performance would it take for a teenage girl in a Spanish-speaking film debut to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress?  This type.<br /><br />Catalina Sandino Moreno flames the screen as the resourceful and practical Maria.  This character makes some difficult choices - some would say the "badness" that occurs to these young women are only just desserts, but Joshua Marton's film does an excellent job of portraying the type of desperate poverty in Columbia that would make a young woman consider desperate choices.  Maria is working in a warehouse stripping thorns from roses that are being shipped overseas when she meets a young braggart who introduces her to men who are smuggling heroin into the U.S. by packaging them into horse-pill pellets, wrapping them in the fingers of latex gloves, then having "mules" carry them into the U.S. in their digestive tract. Maria flies over along with 4 other "mules" with over 60 of these heroin death-pills in her belly.  If one breaks, death seems a certainty.  Tension mounts palpably - will a pellet break and kill one of the girls?  Will U.S. Customs catch one who arrives on an expensive flight from Colombia with little visible means of support?<br /><br />The supporting characters are fleshed out as well as the story needs - but the film is carried on the able talents of Moreno.  Not recommended for those squeamish about a movie where considerable time is spent depicting desperate young people in illegal and morally questionable activities.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJPMB7N776WS.html">A1TJPMB7N776WS</a><br/><p>Maria Alvarez (Catalina Sandino Moreno) is a small town Colombiana with a major league 'tude: she knows what she was born into but also knows she doesn't like it and strives, and more to the point, craves for more. One day she is approached by someone who can set her up as a Mula: a courier who swallows rubber capsules of drugs and smuggles them into the USA and hopefully earn some big bucks in the process. But what Maria doesn't bargain for is that she will find more than a bucket of money at the end of the rainbow in the borough of Queens in NYC, USA.<br />MARIA FULL OF GRACE is a subtle, audaciously well directed (by Joshua Marston) film about what happens when you get what you wish for and ultimately regret having wished for it in the first place. This is Moreno's first film and she is heartbreakingly beautiful and touching as Maria. She is dark, sexy and quietly sensual: the kind of woman who is not aware of her powers, yet wields them nonetheless.<br />Director Marston has made a film of uncommon grace and intelligence. Don't come to this film looking for a glossed over, sugar coated story, you will not find it. What you will find is the ugly and the real told in a manner that can only be described as beautiful yet painstakingly blunt.</p></br><a href="../users/AL5OEDM8TPTKV.html">AL5OEDM8TPTKV</a><br/><p>According to the director's commentary, Joshua Marston's original inspiration for his movie "Maria Full of Grace" was reading an article about Columbian drug mules risking their lives to transport drugs into the United States. He then sat down at his computer, and in a fevered rush, wrote the screenplay for the movie in two days. The end result has wonderful intentions, and a mesmerizing performance by Catalina Sandino Moreno who plays Maria, with the end result being somewhat disappointing.<br /><br />The most wonderful thing about this movie is the main character of Maria, a headstrong flower worker with big problems in her familia. Her life in Colombia is less than ideal, with a boyfriend who's a lout who manages to inpregnate her quickly. She quits her job, drawing the ire of both her sister and mother who depend on the cash to live. In searching for another job, she happens on a young motorcycle rider with connections to Columbia's drug world, and convinces her ultimately to become a drug mule. Thus begins her journey.<br /><br />Maria, played flawlessly by the impressive and beautiful Catalina Sandino Moreno, is headstrong and purposeful. As Maria encounters problems entering the United States by some suspicious immigration officers, she is brilliant enough to lie convincingly, while having luck turn in her favor. Navigating herself through New York, unable to speak the language, she manages to keep herself and her friend Bianca away from some Columbian baddies. Maria relies on herself through this film, and it's refreshing to watch how she manages such a task.<br /><br />However, the script somewhat lets down the film. For example, the plane ride over to New York has some scenes of suspense, but they were somewhat downplayed to advance the story along. The potentially edginess of being hunted by the Columbian drug runners in New York City is somewhat downplayed to advance Maria's decision she makes at the end of the film. This film had the great potential to put Maria in much more danger than it did. Perhaps the screenwriter felt protective of Maria and didn't want to endanger her any more than he did. But perhaps if he did, the film would have been stronger overall.<br /><br />The film does manage to show how an innocent girl manages to make a decision to become a drug mule, and how the policies of the United States in the drug war are ineffective at best. "Maria Full of Grace"'s scope is a bit wide, but the net cast by Catalina Sandino Moreno in her role of Maria will be a portend of great things to come from her.</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>In the middle of the most horrid of the miseries, a little spark of apparent bright seems to be a stairway to heaven.

I understand and accept that.  I'm not saying anyone else's review is wrong.  But being an American, seeing the movie in America with English subtitles, I feel I have every right to review it with from an American perspective.  So I'll give my thoughts on what would have otherwise been a too-slowly paced movie.<br /><br />First, what surprised me the most was the movie's positive view of the United States.  The last thing I ever expected out of an HBO-affiliated film was soft-core pro-America propaganda, but there it was.  Now, as a policy matter I'm not sure I'm in favor of a teenage drug mule ditching her family to come to America and have her illegitimate child at taxpayer expense, but hey, I'm honored she'd even consider it.<br /><br />Second, I thought the movie did a wonderful job showing the bottom of the drug supply food chain.  We have seen some great movies of life at the top of organized crime (e.g., The Godfather) and also at the working class level (e.g., "Good Fellas").  This one definitely has a bird's eye view of the working poor in the drug trade.  It answers the questions Who, Why and How of drug mules with a verisimilitude that astounds (the When, Where and What we already knew).  That makes the movie worth watching.<br /><br />Also, great acting. Ms. Moreno is outstanding and utterly believable.</p></br><a href="../users/A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ.html">A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ</a><br/><p>Maria Full of Grace focuses on the life of a fairly common girl growing up in Columbia 17-year-old Maria (Catalina Sandino Moreno).  Her work dethorning roses pays meagerly, and her boss won't even let her take a quick break.  She asks to urinate, he replies, "If you do, urine trouble," and she says "Urine ojete; I quit."  Although, I must admit that my Spanish is rusty, I ignored the captions a few times, and the Spanish in this film is on Columbian hyperdrive like they're purposely trying to insert slang and confusion.  The lack of job puts a particular cramp on her family because she's the family pack mule; she carries/supports her mother, her sister, and her sister's bastard.  The latter is supported unwillingly.  There goes that iPhone data plan!  Unfortunately, this dire financial situation also left Maria without enough dinero to buy condoms.  Better make that crib a double!  At this point, Maria has few choices.  Make no mistake, we always have choices, but Maria's are almost all bad.  But since she's in Columbia and she's used to being a mule...why not make some big bucks doing what she knows?  Who else is going to facilitate New York's llello delivery to privileged, trust-funds named Trent and Cole, or the Ivory Tower of Wall Streeters who need a pick-me-up to screw over the rest of America for longer than an 8-hour work day?  The stage is set; let the drug smuggling commence.<br /><br />Devoid of massive cocaine factory explosions which rain Columbian sugar down on an entire village, it is apparent director/screenwriter Joshua Marston took no pointers from Michael Bay.  Instead, a realistic approach is delivered without condescension or preaching.  Much appreciated.  Nearly all focus is on the protagonist; her jealous, gordita girlfriend, and the third most dangerous activity involving a mule I can think of.  By all appearances it's the second most authentic film about drug trafficking which has probably ever been made.  First is clearly Aces: Iron Eagle III.  Classic.<br /><br />I enjoyed this tense, character-driven look into the world of poverty, drugs, the lubricating properties of tooth paste, and a recycling scene that toes the line of Human Centipede material.  At no time during the movie are decisions or scenarios unfathomable, which, in and of itself, makes the message powerful, enthralling, and interesting.  Moreno's performance cements this movie's profound significance and impact.<br /><br />Note: I realize crank is a slang term for meth, and not cocaine.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />A solid slice-of-life style drama about South American drug mules, Maria Full of Grace sometimes feels so much like a docudrama that it loses some of its human impact; nevertheless, the acting is fine and the story engaging.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RDR5G65D9H84.html">A2RDR5G65D9H84</a><br/><p>There is certainly a consensus about the fact that drug dealers are nefarious for society and therefore should be punished. But we plunge into grayer areas when we get to discuss mules, which are people, usually women, who smuggle drugs into the US in their stomachs, risking their lives in the process. Of course it is an offense punishable with prison, but in this case one should consider that in many cases the offender might have found herself down a path that she could not avoid; that is the case of Maria Alvarez.<br /><br />Maria (Catalina Sandino Moreno) is a seventeen year-old girl, living in a small town in Colombia and working in a flower nursery, stripping roses of their thorns. The working conditions resemble a subtle form of slavery and workers are mistreated relentlessly and paid below what is needed to satisfy their basic needs. When she ends up pregnant by a boyfriend she does not love and who does not love her, she decides to go to Bogot&aacute; in search of a brighter future for her and her baby. Right before leaving she meets Franklin and when he says he can get her a well-paid job in Bogot&aacute; she does not hesitate and jumps on his bike.<br /><br />When Maria arrives in Bogot&aacute; we get to see how dealers get people who are going through a tough time to do their dirty work, first suggesting the deal as if it was legal and little by little letting the true story slip out. All the while they present a friendly face and promise riches beyond belief for these poor girls. When on her first trip into the US, with an old friend and a new one, Maria has to face a disastrous situation, she has to show what she is made of and decide how she wants to live the rest of her life.<br /><br />A few aspects are noteworthy about this movie, like how well it shows the hardship that most people living in South America have to go through in their everyday lives. As mentioned, we get a gut-wrenching depiction of the methods drug dealers use to gather their "troops" and the differences between the situation they promise and what reality is. Finally, we get to see that a loving family, that took the time to inculcate the appropriate values, always has an impact on the decisions we make when the going gets tough.<br /><br />Besides the thought provoking and emotional story, this film counts with an actress that delivers an amazing performance, especially when one considers that this is her first movie in a leading role. One thing is guaranteed, we will have many chances to see her in future productions, and I will be waiting for them.</p></br><a href="../users/A1V3IO23FZFF9L.html">A1V3IO23FZFF9L</a><br/><p>"Maria" is a strong movie about drug traficing and the pvoerty in Colombia. Its portrayal of the characters are real and never stoop to the level of lecturing the viewer. The acting is great, especially for a group of unknow actors. A real winner of foreign cinema.</p></br><a href="../users/A33CLVW2K7SL1P.html">A33CLVW2K7SL1P</a><br/><p>Plot descriptions have been given, so I'll focus on my thoughts regarding the film.<br /><br />This film was a touching and emotional story, believable and sad. Why sad? Sad because Maria was expected to support her daughter's child and her mother, sad because her boss was a jerk, and sad because the only job for her in the vicinity was the flower factory. Where else would she find work to do everything she needed to do?<br /><br />Particularly harrowing - and deftly handled - were the scenes dealing with the ingestion of the drug packets. I tried to imagine doing it myself, and had a difficult time, knowing that one mistake could kill me. These girls must have been truly desperate to become mules. I can't possibly imagine their destitution.<br /><br />Part of me wanted to see more of the dirty side of the drug business. It seemed too clean. The dealers in Columbia, although they did make slightly veiled threats, came off as nice and amiable. Perhaps they are - I have no clue. The receivers in the U.S. seemed to be more of the real thing, given their callous reactions to the three girls, and what they did to Lucy, of course. What was very unbelievable, however, was that they actually gave the girls their money when the girls ran away with the drugs. They had no obligation to do so, they could have kept the money for themselves, nobody would have given them a hard time, so why'd they do it? For that matter, why did the girls run off with the drugs in the first place? I understand that when a person is confronted with a horrific scene, as Maria and Blanca were when they saw what happened to Lucy that all logic can fly out the window, but surely there had to be some understanding that if they fled with the drugs (and why would they do that anyway?) they would be endangering not only themselves, but their families back in Columbia. After all, there were the veiled (but undoubtedly fully understood) threats.<br /><br />Also, although was labeled as being rebellious by her boss and by her family - their perceptions, and absolutely incorrect - I saw her as a very kind and decent person. I thought that her acquiescence to becoming a mule was too quick. I wish that Maria<br /><br />That's my only complaint. Otherwise, it was touched and moved me greatly.</p></br><a href="../users/A140XH16IKR4B0.html">A140XH16IKR4B0</a><br/><p>Wonderfully shot on location in Columbia, Ecuador and New York City, "Maria Full of Grace" tells the story of a young woman, bored with life on a flower plantation, seeking the easier money of the drug trade. She quits her job dethorning roses and agrees to act as a "mule" for a cabal of drug dealers. The film is mainly interesting for its depictions of the trials that are part-and-parcel of her decision: learning to swallow marshmallow-sized "pellets" of latex-wrapped cocaine and heroin; trying to keep the pellets down during a long flight to the US; encounters with suspicious customs officials and vicious drug handlers. The film gives us a fascinating look  at the Columbian community in New York, showing us drug enforcers, immigrants working form better lives for their children, as well as neighborhood fixers who help their countrymen through the vicissitudes of adjusting to American life.<br /><br />As a window into a world I did not know, "Maria Full of Grace" was extraordinary in spite of a few limitations. The acting (especially on the part of Catalina Sandino Moreno, who played the film's heroine, Maria Alvarez) was underplayed to the extent of woodenness. The film also lost a chance to show the other end of the drug trade -- those who use the product Maria was smuggling. Yet the film is successful in tracing the path of one young woman from an unfulfilling life, through a journey through hell, to what one hopes is a more auspicious future.</p></br><a href="../users/A9LAPV8XNKZVZ.html">A9LAPV8XNKZVZ</a><br/><p>What would you do to get by? One girl's foolish choices illustrate the difficult lives of many. Good movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1SPB225CVTRUU.html">A1SPB225CVTRUU</a><br/><p>Maria Full of Grace is a surprisingly compelling foreign film this year or recent years. It's a very good low-budget film made by an American writer and director(Joshua Marston) which had taken him 5 years from writing the script to the finished film. The debut performance from the mesmerizing Catalina Sandino Moreno is trully captivating. She came across as a combination of Salma Hayek and LeeLee Sobieski. This film had won her the Berlin's best actress award, and I was really touched by her character as well as her performance.<br /><br />Maria(Catalina) is an 18 year old living in poverty, and she works in a rose plantation in Columbia in order to bring home the bacon. She quit her job after an arguement with her boss, and her family was angry at her for losing the job. Meanwhile, she found out that she's pregnant and she has no desire to marry her "stupid" boyfriend. While she was looking for a new job, a friend of hers from the neighborhood introduced her to a drug dealer and told her that she can make lots of money working for him.<br /><br />The job is to carry as many as 100 pellets of drugs in her stomach to New York city. It's a risky business, because if she gets caught, they might send her to jail. Also, if the pellets break in her stomach, she will die. Considered the big chunk of cash she wanted to earn, she took the job.<br /><br />Along with several other girls on the flight who are also "carriers", Maria was very anxious whether she could make it all the way. She had to go to the toilet to "eliminate", and when some of the pellets came out, she had to wash them and swallow them down again. Her friend Lucy was in sweats, and had no idea that the pellet in her had been broken.<br /><br />Maria was taken to the customs when she landed, because they suspected her and took an x-ray on her, and found out she was pregnant. She swore that she was not a "carrier", and they released her. One of the girls got caught, Maria, Lucy, and Blanca survived the customs.<br /><br />They were picked up by the local dealers outside the airport and taken to a motel to "eliminate" the pellets. Lucy was already dying, and ultimately the dealers ended up cutting her open in order to get the pellets. Maria and Blanca were horrified and ran away with the pellets. They had no where to turn except Jucy's sister who had lived in NY for 4 years. There they had to figure out how to solve their trouble and tell the truth to Lucy's sister....<br /><br />This is my favorite Spanish film since Talk To Her, and I think it's going to get a few Oscar nominations including best original screenplay and possibly best actress, considered that they had nominated the girl from Whale Rider.</p></br><a href="../users/A1O60Q7LBN4MQ.html">A1O60Q7LBN4MQ</a><br/><p>This movie was at times hard to watch. A pregnant woman being a mule. How horrifying! I have neighbors who complain about the immigrants coming here, but can you blame them for wanting a better life in America? It's so hard in this stupid world. We just don't appreciate how much better we have it. Besides, all of us in the United States are descendants of immigrants, unless you are one of the few Native Americans left.</p></br><a href="../users/A1A535W556ROBQ.html">A1A535W556ROBQ</a><br/><p>It certainly is a very disturbing story as we watch 4 young Columbian women being used as "mules" to deliver cocaine to the US, but unfortunately this film made "mules" out the characters, failing to really develop any of them sufficently enough to carry this flimsy plot.<br /><br />The movie starts out well enough, introducing us to Maria and giving us a glimpse of her life in the outskirts of Bogota, but the film breaks down once she and her compatriots board the plane to New Jersey. It was hard enough for me to imagine Maria getting through US customs with her weak story much less surviving this harrowing ordeal.  The director all too obviously sets up each girl as a stereotype for what happens to young women caught in this predicament, and then loses all sight of what he is trying to say as Maria and her friend are left to fend for themselves in New York.<br /><br />This was obviously a director who felt he had something terribly important to tell, but his inabilility to sufficiently resolve the plot is what brings this movie down.  Too bad because one does develop empathy for Catalina Sandino Moreno, the actress who played Maria, as she managed to keep her head held high throughout this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2DSXA1E02C86D.html">A2DSXA1E02C86D</a><br/><p>The day after I watched the DVD of MARIA FULL OF GRACE, it's star, Catalina Moreno, was nominated for a Best Actress Oscar. I guess my viewing put her over the top.<br /><br />Catalina plays Maria, a 17-year old Colombian whose life is in the dumpster. She's pregnant by her worthless boyfriend; she quits her job de-thorning rose stalks after her male boss won't let her leave the assembly line to go to the loo and vomit; her mother and self-centered sister, the latter also an unwed mother, berate her for abandoning the major portion of the family's earning power. What's a poor girl to do? Why, of course, go to Bogota and volunteer to become a "mule", i.e., someone who jets into the United States with his/her belly full of miniature sausage-shaped baggies of cocaine. After practicing swallowing large, red grapes - I would have picked those little cocktail weenies - off she goes to New York with sixty-something of the packets onboard and the promise of $5,000 when she delivers. And, as the drug middleman warns her, don't lose any on the way because "we know where your family lives". In any case, Maria finds herself on the international flight with three other mules. Only one comes back.<br /><br />With her Oscar nomination as Best Actress, is Moreno in the same league with the likes of Imelda Staunton (VERA DRAKE), Annette Benning (BEING JULIA), and Hilary Swank (MILLION DOLLAR BABY)? Most assuredly not. Perhaps her inclusion represents the relative dearth of great female screen performances in 2004; there's little from which to choose. However, having said that, Catalina's performance is a very fine one, especially for one so new to the Biz. A golden statue is within her reach in the future.<br /><br />The creators of MARIA FULL OF GRACE remained disingenuously neutral throughout about the morality of the drug trade. Rather, the film focuses on the unremarkably commonplace economic pressures that pushed Maria, ostensibly a young and intelligent woman of otherwise average morality, into a venture that subsequently caused her so much anguish, mortal fear, and inconvenience. One would hope that the experience would make her a vocal DARE advocate, but perhaps that's too much to expect in today's world. In the great scheme of things, the causes of evil and suffering can be banal indeed, and just go on and on.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>In this week's "Entertainment Weekly" Stephen King picked "Maria Full of Grace" as his favorite film of 2004, which is certainly an interesting thing to know before watching this independent film from writer-director Joshua Marston.  The picture on the DVD cover shows Maria Alvarez (Catalina Sandino Moreno) posed as if she were about to receive Holy Communion.  Only instead of receiving the host Maria is about to swallow a pellet containing heroin wrapped in the finger of a latex glove.  That particular image is not present in the film with as much symbolism as it is on the cover, but it does represent the crucible of Maria's odyssey.<br /><br />Maria is 17 and works in Colombia picking the thorns off of roses before they are shipped overseas.  Although she is clearly a bright girl, Maria discovers that she is pregnant.  To make things worse her boyfriend is a loser, her boss at work is a jerk, and her family needs her to provide money.  So after Maria quits her job she is introduced to a man in Bogot&aacute; who will give her $5,000 for flying to New York City with 62 of those pellets in her stomach as a "mule" for a drug lord.  For Maria that amount is a virtual fortune and seems worth the risk that one of those pellets could break in her stomach and kill her.  So she practices swallow grapes so that she will be able to do what needs to be done to get her money.<br /><br />There will be several mules on this particular flight, a practice known as "shotgunning" that Marston learned about and which inspired his original script.  The idea is that if you put several mules on the same plane and plan on U.S. Customs catching one of them, which would make it easier for the rest of the drugs to get through.  Also on the plane with Maria are her friend, Blanca (Yenny Paola Vega), who is jealous of the money her friend is going to make, a mule on her third run, Lucy (Giulied Lopez), who wants to visit her sister in New York City, and at least one more experience drug smuggler.<br /><br />"Maria Full of Grace" sets the stage for the big trip by paying attention to the process by which Maria first practices, and then swallows all those pellets.  This serves to underscore how dangerous this is going to be and you know that something is going to go horribly wrong.  It is just a question of how many of these girls will be dead by the time it is all over and what exactly Maria will do to earn the sobriquet of the title.  Marston does touch on all of the mules on the plane, but the focus of the story is on Moreno and her compelling performance.  Clearly Marston is out to make a point, but because this is a low-budget independent film he is forced to tell it simply.  Ironically, his leading actress is so good that we are concerned more with her survival than any stinging indictment of the use of mules by Colombian drug cartels.<br /><br />Catalina Sandino Moreno won the best actress award a the 2004 Berlin Film Festival along with Charlize Theron in "Monster," which is interesting simply because the performances are pretty much at opposite ends of the acting spectrum.  Since "Maria Full of Grace" premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January 18, 2004, where it won the Audience Award, Moreno's performance would be eligible for the next Academy Awards.  Usually Oscar nominations focus on movies released in December and as a rule ignore anything released before the Summer blockbuster season, but what Moreno did in this film might be too impressive to forget (Addendum: For once I was right and Moreno is nominated for Best Actress).</p></br><a href="../users/A1DZKOOMMJM1MI.html">A1DZKOOMMJM1MI</a><br/><p>Maria Full of Grace is a moving and powerful motion picture about a girl who goes in over her head when she longs for a better life. We follow Maria (Catalina Sandino Moreno) from her dead end job stripping roses in Colombia to a new opportunity--becoming a "mule," by ingesting drugs in large capsules and smuggling them to  New Jersey. What follows is a gritty, fast-paced, and suspense-filled story<br /><br />Remember the name Catalina Sandino Moreno. The heartfelt and harrowing performance she gives here has won her a heap of awards and I am sure there are many more to come. First-time director Joshua Marston, who also wrote the taut screenplay, shows Maria being taught how to swallow drugs wrapped in packets -- she sips soup to make them go down without gagging. If the drugs in her belly should seep out during Maria's turbulent jet flight to New York, she could be poisoned or arrested or both. Marston builds incredible tension. But it's the human drama etched on Moreno's young, weary face that gives Maria its potent punch.<br /><br />This Winner of the Audience Award at Sundance is a terrific film; shocking, engrossing, and entertaining. But what makes Maria Full of Grace an extraordinary experience is its ability to be ordinary. We see everyday life here, plausible motives, convincing decisions, and characters who live at ground level. The movie's suspense is heightened by being generated entirely at the speed of life, and showing us what probably would happen, and not some implausible fairy-tale.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PR6NXG0PA3KY.html">A2PR6NXG0PA3KY</a><br/><p>Painful and ugly, Maria Llena de Gracia is also a powerful experience of vicarious desperation and deprivation. The story of a village girl in Colombia whose family, novio, and job all fail her at the same moment. She rushes heedlessly into big trouble, which in Colombia can only mean the cocaine trade. Coke merchants and smugglers are not nice people; we know that, and to see this film as an indictment of their viciousness is only a fraction of the movie's content. It's also, and more importantly an indictment of the global economy, the Octopus of our era with far stronger tentacles than the railroad of the early 20th Century. The indictment is clear from the first scene of the movie, when ALL the young women of the community report for work through a high wire fence to the warehouse where roses are trimmed and wrapped for export to North America. There is no other work in the village, no subsistence, no options, no future. If it were in Mexico - and there are exactly the same horrible sweat-shops in NAFTAfied Mexico - one would have at least the option of illegal emigration to El Norte, but in Colombia, it's 'muling' drugs or maid service. Frankly, I doubt that many American viewers of this film really saw what it was about from the Colombian perspective. Stopping the drug traffic isn't just a matter of spraying lethal chemicals over the countryside or supplying arms and helicopters to the latifundistas who own the government, and it isn't just a matter of reducing demand from the two poles of American society - the marginalized Black and the overprivileged White - either. It's a matter of facilitating the recovery of a diverse local economy, in which most people can make a living and a few can even find opportunity without crime and violence.<br /><br />The Spanish spoken in this film, by the way, is extremely hard to catch unless you've heard the rural dialects before. The "vos" forms are used throughout (vosotros in Spain, the second person plural) and slang is pervasive. Even my son, who went to public elementary school in Spain and who speaks like a native, had to have the English subtitles.</p></br><a href="../users/AWPODHOB4GFWL.html">AWPODHOB4GFWL</a><br/><p>Maria Alvarez (Catalina Sandino Moreno) is a seventeen year old living a poor farming life in Columbia with her mother, sister and her niece whose father has deserted them.  After losing her only job in her community, Maria finds herself involved with smuggling heroin into the USA.  This would give her enough money to start a new life in what is referred to as `the magical land' (El Norte).  Desperate, she finds herself in a situation completely unlike she expected and meets tragedy and betrayals everywhere she goes.  However, there are those kind enough to understand her and support her - if she manages to live.  Moreno was up for Best Actress for this role, which is uncommon for a non-UK or American actress.</p></br><a href="../users/ABN5K7K1TM1QA.html">ABN5K7K1TM1QA</a><br/><p>"Maria llenas eres de gracia," is one of the outstanding films of the new century, and one of the best I've seen in months.  Joshua Marston, who wrote the script and directed, took a commercial idea--that of telling a story about the "mulas" who smuggle drugs into the US by swallowing pellets of cocaine or (in this case) heroin wrapped in latex which they later excrete.  Should one of them burst before it is passed out of the body, it is likely the mule will die.  It's a risky business in more ways than one, and only somebody desperate or foolish would do it.<br /><br />So the first thing that Marston must do is establish Maria's character in such a way that we can believe she would do something like this.  She is, on the one hand, an ordinary 17-year-old Columbian girl who works stripping the thorns from the stems of roses in a factory.  She lives at home with her mother, sister and her sister's baby.  She has a boyfriend.  She has to work to help support the family.  On the other hand she is a headstrong person, a pretty girl with a head on her shoulders.<br /><br />But Maria is not exactly desperate.  She is a bit of a gambler, somewhat foolish, no doubt, but she is also a strong person with great personal integrity.  Marston allows us to see in the beginning of the film that she will take chances that others won't.  She climbs up onto the roof of a building, a climb her boyfriend is afraid to make.  We see her tell her boss (more or less) to take this job and shove it when he won't let her go to the bathroom.  And we realize shortly thereafter why she needs to go to the bathroom more often than usual.  We watch her tell her boyfriend about her predicament, and she does it in such a way that we can tell that she is searching for how he really feels.  And when she finds out he doesn't really love her, at least doesn't love her the way she wants to be loved, she leaves him.<br /><br />But now she is in a fix.  Her job helped pay for the family's bills.  Now the situation is set.  Her character is set.  The premise of the film can unwind: and so she meets a young man on a motorcycle who tells her how she can make some serious money smuggling drugs into the US.<br /><br />Imagine how the average Hollywood director would fashion a movie from such a premise.  There would be brutality, gun fights, car chases.  Cardboard villains would exploit Maria and others like her.  There would be some heroics and perhaps a knight in shining armor would save Maria.<br /><br />But that is not how Marston plays it.  He opts for realism and he doesn't wallow in the violence or the exploitation.  He keeps the focus on Maria and her personal struggle to find herself and to deal with the circumstances she has gotten into.  The characters are real, the situations are authentic, and the details are closely observed and realistic.  We see Maria practice swallowing large globe grapes.  We see the people in the drug-smuggling business and some of the other mules.  We see the security people at the airport and the young men who watch the girls until the pellets are passed.  There is no glamor among these characters.  It is clear they are patterned after real people who could actually be in this ugly business.  And in the end we see the triumph of Maria's character.<br /><br />What makes this such an outstanding movie is not only the careful, clear and veracious way that Marston tells the story, but the compelling performance by Catalina Sandino Moreno who plays Maria.  She is a very talented young actress who has the kind of beauty that suggests something close to nobility of character, if I may use such an old-fashioned phrase.  It is this quality of hers that Marston captures and emphasizes.  The result is one of the most arresting performances I've seen in quite a while.  Moreno appears entirely real, completely divorced from any phony celluloid heroine.  She became to me--and this is what all great actors can do--someone I know, someone I care about, and I was filled with emotion as the movie ended.<br /><br />"This is a movie about a girl becoming a woman," is the way Moreno expressed it.  Marston puts it this way, "I realized...I was making a film about a girl who was doing something universal in trying to figure out the meaning of her life."  This is really what the story is about: becoming a woman in this world of risks and trade-offs, of dangers and obligations.<br /><br />A movie that is a work of art and worthy of something more than the diversion of an evening should affect the viewer emotionally, intellectually and artistically.  Maria Full of Grace is such a movie, a movie that comes along perhaps once a year, or perhaps only once in several years.  It's that good.<br /><br />By all means see this for Catalina Sandino Moreno who was nominated for Best Actress by the Academy in 2005 but lost out to Hilary Swank for her performance in Million Dollar Baby (2004).  And see it for Joshua Marston who made it real.</p></br><a href="../users/A1RECBDKHVOJMW.html">A1RECBDKHVOJMW</a><br/><p>Catalina Sandino Moreno recently won a Best Actress Academy Award nomination for her stunning portrayal of Maria in Joshua Marston's "Maria Full of Grace." This was a debut performance for Ms. Sandino Moreno, a native of Bogot&aacute;, Colombia, who developed an interest in acting while in high school. She subsequently studied theater and acting and caught Marston's eye when she auditioned for this part. He took a risk by casting the inexperienced young actress as Maria and, in return, she delivered - bringing tremendous depth to the complex and demanding role.<br /><br />Seventeen year-old Maria Alvarez works on a flower plantation outside Bogot&aacute;, stripping thorns off roses in preparation for shipping. It's a dead-end job and her future doesn't look to improve much. A spirited, independent young women, with a sense of adventure, she is obviously bored with the work and her abusive supervisor, disenchanted with her immature boyfriend, and fed-up with her family, which receives almost her entire paycheck. When Maria discovers she is pregnant, she accepts the offer to carry drugs to the US as a mule. There is no way, however, that she could have imagined the nightmarish and threatening world she becomes involved with.<br /><br />Films about the drug trade abound, from this year's "El Rey," (also up for an Academy Award), to "Traffic," "Veronica Guerin," "Trainspotting," "Blow,"  even 1971's extraordinary "The French Connection," to name a few. However, "Maria Full of Grace" offers a totally different perspective on the business of drugs and drug smuggling. Even though the primary focus is on the mules here, a much broader picture is portrayed. It is painful, and extremely intense, to watch the desperate Maria force herself to swallow almost 70 thumb-sized pellets filled with finely powered heroin. She takes medication first to slow her digestion, all the while under the watchful eye of her runner. The danger of discovery and death is ever present, as is the potential risk to her family if anything goes wrong. A Colombian mule can earn between $5000. to $8000. per trip. Considering that the average annual per capita income is around $2,000, one gets a general understanding of why the girl might imperil herself to this extent. I felt a terrible sense of sadness throughout much of the movie. This particular film does conclude on a hopeful note, I think - for Maria anyway.<br /><br />Marston, who directed from his own script, takes us through the entire harrowing run in a manner so realistic that I felt I was watching a documentary at times. The building tension on the commercial plane flight to New York had me literally on the edge of my seat. And Catalina Sandino Moreno is a natural - absolutely gifted! This film is outstanding - certainly<br />one of the best movies to be made on the subject. The supporting cast also deserves kudos, with special mention to Yenny Paola Vega, who plays the tenacious Blanca, and to Orlando Tobon - who is not a professional actor. His character, Don Fernando, is taken from fact not fiction. In Jackson Heights, Queens, Orlando Tobon is called the "mayor of Little Colombia." He makes his living as an accountant and travel agent, but he also serves his community as a social service counselor and all-purpose guide to many of the thousands of Colombian immigrants who come to live in his ethnically diverse Queens neighborhood. Tobon is also known as "the undertaker of the mules" for his work helping families repatriate the remains of Colombians who die smuggling drugs into New York.<br />JANA</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>When I first heard about Mar&iacute;a Llena eras de Gracia and its subject, I had many doubts about the treatment of such a delicate subject and how Colombian this movie was, with a writer/director from the USA; but when I heard the interviews and read the reviews I got really interested in the film and had the opportunity to see this film this afternoon.<br /><br />Maria Full of Grace is one of the better films of 2004: well acted, well written, and very unique in its' story. From the beginning to the end Joshua Marston chooses to present the story in a way that has us relating and sympathizing with Maria in her plight to find her place in the sun.<br /><br />A very real topic with very real portrayal and acting, this is definitely one of the better films to come out. Unusually well managed without being junked up with the usual Hollywood tawdry tinsel and situational extremes, this very human drama does more pound-for-pound than most films many times its size. It presents its story at a quick pace and leaves you wanting more.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed the film and recommend it to anyone in general, being a great triumph in film-making. I hope to see more films from Joshua Marston in the future.</p></br><a href="../users/A2QHM5HBSIXRL4.html">A2QHM5HBSIXRL4</a><br/><p>For once, here's a small, low budget film done justice by its excellent marketing campaign.  First, my compliments to whoever designed the movie poster - to the uninitiated, it would appear that Catalina Sandrino Moreno's 'Maria' is about to receive Holy Communion - a perfect juxtaposition in devoutly Catholic Colombia.  Those who've seen the stark, no punches trailer know that Maria is receiving a baptism of a far different sort.<br /><br />I often get frustrated when a powerful film like 'East Is East' is marketed here as a 'breezy charmer' (no lie - that was the campaign for a movie that was anything but).  So, I'm obligated to note when a movie and its marketing efforts respect the intelligence of its viewing audience.  Thank you, HBO Films.  And thanks, too, for taking a bet on writer/director Joshua Marston despite his brief biography.  Good to see that HBO continues to recognize that the best ideas don't always come out of the Hollywood enclave.<br /><br />Ultimately, this movie works because of Catalina Sandrino Moreno's brilliant performance.  You have to believe her naivet&eacute;, and for the ability of this 23-year-old to pull off a performance as a doe-eyed 17-year-old.  How/why could anyone become a mule, you ask?  'Maria' makes you see how a person could find themselves compelled to make such a choice.<br /><br />'Maria' is also notable for its excellent depiction of the Colombian immigrants' support system in New York City, featuring a wonderful performances from Orlando Tobon as "Don Fernando" - a one-man office source of job leads, explainer of the U.S. legal system and all-around 'shoulder to lean on' for 'Colombians en el Exterior' in his neighborhood.  Given that Sr. Tobon is also Associate Producer, I suspect 'Don Fernando' is not too far from the role he plays in real life.</p></br><a href="../users/A13E0ARAXI6KJW.html">A13E0ARAXI6KJW</a><br/><p>This first-time work by director/writer Joshua Marston is impressively unadorned in a way that surprised me because of what I perceived to be the predictable elements involved. For a low-budget indie, the 2004 film also has surprisingly first-class production values, most specifically the very crisp camerawork by Jim Denault, who captures the realism of the various locales - Bogota, New York City, Jersey City - without jittery stylization. The straight-ahead story focuses on seventeen-year old Maria, pregnant and in a dead-end job picking thorns off roses on a Columbian plantation. Tired of her presumed lot in life, she breaks up with her thoughtless boyfriend and connects with a friend who leads her to a drug lord. He offers her a job as a "mule", which means ingesting 62 pellets of heroin and traveling to New York to make the delivery.<br /><br />The stacked-deck set-up sounds like the plot would spiral into issue-oriented melodrama and "Scarface"-like bloody confrontations. Instead, Marston uses an almost matter-of-fact approach to the escalating complications that Maria faces in taking the job and her ensuing experiences in the U.S. There is a naturally spontaneous quality to the unexpected storyline that propels it with candor and emotional resonance. It helps that the filmmaker found the ideal Maria in big-screen rookie Catalina Sandino Moreno, whose plaintive presence and realistic acting provide the film a genuine soul at its core. The rest of the unknown cast seems incidental by comparison, though there is solid work by Moreno look-alike Guilied Lopez as Lucy, the more experienced mule facing inner turmoil about her decision; Patricia Rae especially powerful in her few scenes as Carla, Lucy's estranged sister living in New York (her no-nonsense but sympathetic character reminds me a bit of the roles Frances McDormand usually takes); and Yenny Paola Vega as Maria's clingy, foolhardy friend Blanca.<br /><br />As expected, the pellet ingestion scene is painful to watch, and there is some overly convenient wrap-up toward the end that seems to oversimplify the problems Marston painstakingly presents. In fact, at certain points late in the film, I did start to get concerned that he was going to turn the movie into a don't-let-this-happen-to-you parable, but luckily my worries were not realized. Regardless, it's a wondrous debut for both Marston and Moreno, and clearly both are well poised to do great work in the future. There is an informative commentary track by Marston on the no-frills DVD package.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EEUQ81DTY7G3.html">A2EEUQ81DTY7G3</a><br/><p>There are some terrific, tense scenes in Maria Full Of Grace, a heavily dramatic and horrifyingly real drug mule movie. This is a tormenting portrait of a resourceful young woman who refuses to play the hand that life has dealt her, which is to remain poor, and exploited in rural Columbia. The fierce and startlingly vital Maria Alvarez (the beautiful Catalina Sandino Moreno) is a seventeen-year-old Colombian teen. She's restless, rebellious, and feisty. She also has a loving mother, but she's tired of working at shearing roe stems at the local flower plantation, especially when she sees her wages going to support her sister (Johanna Andrea Mora), a single mother. She discovers she's pregnant and when she admits to her feckless and spineless boyfriend (Wilson Guerrer) that she doesn't love him, she quits her job and escapes to Bogot&aacute; and the promise of a better future.<br /><br />On her way to the big city, she meets a young man who invites her to become a mule for drug traffickers, who want her to help them transport heroin to the United States by swallowing 62 drug-filled pellets. Her best friend Blanca (Yenny Paola Vega) wants to join her. Maria has to learn how to swallow the pellets containing heroin by practicing on grapes given to her by her mentor drug mule friend Lucy (Guilied Lopez). Maria feels scared and vulnerable but she's determined to go through with the plan and escape the life she's known.<br /><br />Maria Full of Grace never shies away from showing us the risk and danger of the drug transportation underworld. From the terrifying plane trip, where Lucy begins to get sick to the tense moments where some of the girls are hauled in by immigration officials in New York, the movie is absolutely gripping in its verisimilitude, The viewer sees how the pellets are made and how the women suppress the gag reflex and manage to swallow them, and also how they cope when the ultimately get to the United States.<br /><br />The film cleverly refuses to pass judgment on these girls and the choices that they make. Their desperation and flaws are apparent but their motivations are completely understandable. There's lots of unpredictable plot twists as Maria is forced to survive in a country where she doesn't speak the language, and where anxiety is a daily force. Moreno is a revelation as Maria - easily one of the best, most exciting performances of the year; she is indeed full of "grace." Mike Leonard September 04.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>Even if you don't know the name of Catalina Sandrino Moreno, you will remember her and her strong acting after watching this stunning drama about "Maria," Columbian girl who becomes a "mule" hired by drug dealers. The film is partly suspense, partly drama, but no matter how you categorize this low budget film, you cannot deny the powerful acting of Catelina Sandrino Moreno who grabs your heart from the beginning to the end.<br /><br />The film slowly builds up its quiet first half set in Columbia, showing the life of 17-year-old Maria (Catalina Sandrino Moreno) who does not seem very happy living there. We are going to see her problems - about her family, work, and boyfriend -- but at the same time we also watch the social conditions seen from the viewpoint of an ordinary girl.<br /><br />And you may think no ordinary girl would accept the job of becoming a mule. The film, however, convincingly recreates the atmosphere of the place in which there are very few choices left for the ordinary girls like Maria, and an opportunity of becoming a mule comes as if it is a part-time job like babysitting. The guy who offers her a job of delivering something to someone in New Jersey does not look so bad, speaking like her own grandfather. But by the time we see Maria's decision, we realize the strong undercurrent that pushes girls like Maria. She silently and quietly, accepts the job, knowing the dangers of being arrested, or death.<br /><br />One of the most amazing things about the film is that we come to share the values of Maria while we know that what she does is morally wrong. Of course she knows it is wrong, but she knows (or she thinks she knows) it is the only way left for her. But after the suspenseful travel to New York and the horrible accident she encounters there, Maria is no longer what she was. And her next step should be a more independent one.<br /><br />[HARROWING DETAILS] You heard the stories of mules bring illegal substances into the countries like America by swallowing them. The film director Joshua Marston, it is reported, has interviewed the women who recounted their own experiences as mules, and the details of the business-like routine of the training to be one are one of the most realistic and harrowing experiences I have ever seen. Not that it is violent. It is painful to see because it is done as if it is nothing.<br /><br />But the most impressive is the energetic performance of Catalina Sandrino Moreno, who realized a realistic and credible portrait of an ordinary woman in Maria, which defies our easy categorizing of the good and the evil. She could be both good and bad, or strong and weak at the same time, and her powerful acting gives a human's face to the social concern in which humans are often treated as figures or ciphers. Among many merits of the film, the last is the most difficult one to achieve, and for that reason alone, the film and Catalina Sandrino Moreno should be praised..</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZOF747O5EB6R.html">A1ZOF747O5EB6R</a><br/><p>"Maria Full of Grace" is a touching, yet at times frightening, film that deserves a wider audience than those of the art house circuit.  Unfortunately, it has always been the case that films wholly or partly subtitled miss out on mass market distribution.  This is a shame.  Many such films, including "Maria", are truly excellent and deserve broader accolades than they receive.<br /><br />The story of "Maria" covers the life of Maria Alavarez (brilliantly played by Catalina Sandino Moreno) whose life revolves around providing for her mother, her sister and her sister's baby from the wages she earns dethorning roses in rural Colombia.  She hates her work and her boss.  Ultimately, she quits in frustration.  Coinciding with this, she realises that she is pregnant to her boyfriend who is probably best described as a loser.  Her life seems to have little upside.<br /><br />Maria's solution is to work as a mule in order to carry heroin from Bogota to New York.  It's a potentially lucrative trade.  She swallows 62 capsules of the drug.  Her journey is troubled as she escapes the authorities in New York simply because she is pregnant and therefore cannot be X-rayed.  She also sees the brutal and unrelenting side of the trade when one of her fellow mules is killed to retrieve the cargo she is carrying in her system.  Life in this business is cheap.<br /><br />Without revealing the end, it can be said that the film is great.  The characters are very plausible and the film seems to have no special axe to grind.  See this film for the strength of its characters.  Do not be persuaded otherwise simply because of the requirement to read subtitles.</p></br><a href="../users/AFJFXN42RZ3G2.html">AFJFXN42RZ3G2</a><br/><p>MARIA FULL OF GRACE is an ironic film about drug trafficking among young Columbian women.  Within the context of the film lies a buried depiction of the American Dream that only comes at the end of the film.  It is definitely a five star quality independent film that covers unique angles from a basic and complex plotline.  The film centers around a young woman wanting to break out of her conformist life where she works at a factory that makes flowers in order to help her mother support her sister and her sister's child, but she eventually becomes involved with the wrong side of the tracks.  Maria becomes a pregnant teen who looks toward her so-called rebellious friends, who convince her to quit her mundane job at the factor and to deal drugs.<br /><br />Upon Maria's arrival to New York to delivery the drugs, via her stomach, she meets up with her neighbor from Columbia, Lucy, who  is also one of the scapegoats.  Unfortunately, Lucy does not succeed in completing her mission, and is left to die in a hotel room.  Maria happens to have Lucy's sister's address, and convinces her to bring her in despite the fact that she does not know about the trouble Lucy is in as well as Maria's dealings with drugs.  In the end, Maria finds out that Lucy has been murdered.  She completes her mission, but as she is about to leave to go back to Columbia, she changes her mind.  She walks away from the airport counter heading back to New York City to begin a new life in the United States along with her unborn child.<br /><br />MARIA FULL OF GRACE appears to be an incomplete film because the narrative runs succinctly.  However, the film doesn't drag at all and will keep viewers interested in knowing what will happen in the next scene.  There's no doubt that the film is covered with much cultural and religious overtones as well main premise of the film  -- survival.  Is it a coming of age film?  Possibly, but from another perspective - a young woman attempting to live on her own terms and having much luck on her side.  This is one film with controversial issues, and where there's a happy ending.  Maria's experience could only happen in the movies.</p></br><a href="../users/A25AXWGBGJ5KBS.html">A25AXWGBGJ5KBS</a><br/><p>I spent the hundred or so minutes of this film's duration in a hypnotized but stressed-out state. Stress because I felt as if I was standing right there next to Maria Alvarez, the titular character.<br /><br />This remarkable film does so many things well, it's hard to catalog them...but I'll try anyways.<br /><br />First, the depiction of life in Colombia, and how simple/necessary it is to become involved in the drug trade, is effortlessly but exquisitely told. Our heroine has no other options...it's obvious.<br /><br />Second, the details on, shall we say, "mule" training, were enough to make my wife and I both nearly gag in empathy.<br /><br />Third, the suspense that builds during the initial travel to the U.S. is nerve-rattling.<br /><br />Fourth, the entry into NY and the harrowing motel scenes, again, are brilliantly but plainly told. I didn't want to blink.<br /><br />That's all fine and dandy, but the single unifying element that raises this film into the category of something "really special" is the performance of Catalina Sandino Moreno.  Miss Moreno presents us with a fully formed, incredibly detailed and nuanced character; there's not a false note in her entire performance. She had me from the moment she appeared until the final fade-out.<br /><br />Now having seen this movie, there is no question why she was nominated for Best Actress. It's that good.<br /><br />In an age where sequels are made from the most embarrassing tripe, here is one of those rare films where I would do anything to see what happens after the credits roll.<br /><br />I need to know that she's OK.<br /><br />I'm from Colombia. I know Colombia. This film gets it right.<br /><br />Bravo, Joshua Marston and bravo Miss Moreno. You've made a simple, eloquent film that puts most everything else from 2004 to shame.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FG91CM8221X1.html">A1FG91CM8221X1</a><br/><p>To American audiences lulled by action flicks and insipid teen comedies, Joshua Marston's "Maria Full of Grace" is a bucket of cold water in the face. Shot in jittery, cinema-verite fashion, it tells the story of Maria Alvarez, a spirited young woman facing dead-end prospects in her small Colombian town, who takes the only apparent way out--signing on as a drug mule, swallowing packets of heroin and transporting them in her stomach from Bogota to New York. And thus, as Marston makes brutally plain, she leaps from the frying pan into the fire. Writer-drector Marston passes no judgment on Maria, though surely everyone who sees this film will feel renewed loathing for the drug trade. Maria is a headstrong but decent and moral young woman, whose only real crime is having been born into a world in which the deck is always stacked against her. As Maria, Catalina Sandino Moreno gives a beautiful, heartbreaking performance. Her final scene--in which Maria comes to a decision that leaves her well and truly alone--will haunt you for a long time. "Maria Full of Grace" may well be the best film ever made about illegal immigrants to the U.S.; in my opinion, it deserves comparison with "Umberto D," "The Bicycle Thief," and other classics of Neo-Realism.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ODBHT4URXVXQ.html">A2ODBHT4URXVXQ</a><br/><p>Set in Colombia, Maria Full of Grace focuses on the choice an independent-minded pregnant teenager makes in order to escape a stifling home situation, a heading-no-where boyfriend situation, boredom, and lack of other opportunities. She agrees to be a mule, a drug runner, for lots and lots of money. The process of swallowing the large capsules is described in such detail that you nearly gag along with her as she struggles to get the hang of it, knowing she will die of a heroin overdose should one break.<br /><br />Turns out there are 4 female mules on her flight from Bogot&aacute; to NYC. Only 3 make it thru Customs, and only 2 survive to carry on with their lives.<br /><br />The lead role of Maria is played to perfection by Catalina Sandrino Moreno, an actress whose face conveys all her inner conflicted feelings with a bare minimum of movement.<br /><br />Very powerful film in every way.</p></br><a href="../users/A1129LM24YWSZV.html">A1129LM24YWSZV</a><br/><p>Wow. While a bit of a downer at times, I found Maria Full of Grace fascinating and, ultimately, hopeful. Maria lives in Columbia, and she works long, humiliating hours at a flower plantation. She chafes under the supervision of her pompous supervisor, but her family needs her checks to pay for necessities such as medicine. After a particularly difficult day, Maria finally quits her job. Her sister (who, incidentally, doesn't even have a job) is thrown into an uproar. Shortly thereafter, Maria meets Franklin, a silver-tongued young man who is involved in the country's illicit drug trade, at a party. Franklin promises Maria big bucks and the chance to travel if she will serve as a drug mule, smuggling cocaine into America. (He doesn't mention up front that Maria will have to swallow approximately 60 laytex-wrapped pellets of the drug to make the transfer.) Maria, who has recently discovered that she is pregnant, makes a desperate grab at the opportunity.<br /><br />This was a very powerful film. Catalina Sandino Moreno, who plays Maria, turns in a truly star performance. Although the situations Maria is faced with are definitely high-stakes, Moreno never overacts or emotes. Maria is a thinker. She considers her decisions; even though most of her options are unpleasant, she weighs them carefully. Moreno portrays this measured quality wonderfully. I highly recommend this film. It's filmed in Spanish, with subtitles, but the performances are so good that you'll hardly notice. No nudity, some language, and very gritty material in some scenes.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VJ7HYM1EC94M.html">A1VJ7HYM1EC94M</a><br/><p>Maria Full of Grace deserves all of the accolades being heaped on it - and then some.<br /><br />This is a powerfully moving film with a stunning first appearance by Catalina Sandrino Moreno.

Her story is a harrowing one and it's told without a note of false sentiment giving almost a documentary feel throughout that makes the tale all the more real.<br /><br />Every frame captures the horror of a teenage girl wanting only to better her life, getting involved in a something bigger than herself (and hopefully one shot deal), being stranded and lost in a foreign country and legitimately fearing for her life.  Ms. Moreno won several international awards for her performance and earned every one.<br /><br />A stunning achievement and a beautiful, if harrowing film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VIOCJZ22JZXT.html">A3VIOCJZ22JZXT</a><br/><p>Maria Full of Grace is a superb film. The story of how a young girl from the Columbian countryside becomes a drug "mule" for a drug cartel is realistic and frightening.  The acting of all the characters were great but Catalina Sandino Moreno playing the role of Maria was exceptional. Maria is a strong willed independent young woman, which in some ways leads her into extreme risk with drug dealers in Bogota. However her strong will also saves her in the end as she escapes from the web strung around her and other young women like her. The film draws you into her situation and is suspenseful throughout. I knew that people smuggled drugs into the US in their stomachs but this film gives you all the gory uncomfortable details.

Then a "friend" advises her that she can make unheard of money as a "mule" who swallows packets of heroin and delivers them by stomach to New York City. The allure of money and adventure is too much, so Maria, her best friend Blanca, and a seasoned mule named Lucy, learn how to swallow 50-60 packets without gagging and find themselves on the next flight to the Big Apple. We're not surprised when custom agents grill Maria upon landing, or that a packet bursts in Lucy's stomach, but these are only the beginnings of bad outcomes for all.

She is what is called in the drug business a "mule".  "Or they are called "swallowers," drug couriers who rent out their bodies as cargo containers, each carrying upwards of a kilo, or 2.2 pounds, of packaged narcotics. It's an old trick, body packing, but on the rise, and getting more sophisticated. Increased airport security has caused some drug cartels to shift a majority of their small shipments out of carry-on baggage and into the less easily searched internal compartments of the "mule."

I was educated about a world with which I was unfamiliar, but I maintained my attachment to some of the characters.

You will follow the storyline without hesitation.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>It's always interesting when a newcomer or a little well known actor/actress comes out with a film and just astonishes people, moreso when they find out that the newcomer is quite young. Such is the way with Catalina Sandino Moreno, the main character of this film and interestingly, the first Oscar nomination for someone of Columbian descent.<br /><br />In Columbia, Catalina's character Maria works in a flower plantation de-thorning roses before they're shipped out. Her boss is pretty much an ass, she has a very loser boyfriend that ends up getting her pregnant and her family relies on her completely for money, including her sister who has a son.<br /><br />She meets a guy that offers her a job: travel to New York with close to 60-70 thumb sized pellets in your stomach and get through US customs without getting detected. Deliver the pellets and you'll get paid a large sum of money. These pellets however contain heroin, and if one breaks or dissolves in their stomach, it will mean death. She meets up with Lucy, someone who's done it before and has to deal with Blanca, her friend who also ingested the pellets and is tagging along.<br /><br />One nice thing about Catalina's performance is that she's playing the role like someone calling out to the audience and not demanding sympathy. She does things that are quite bad, she's a bit naive at times yet somehow you feel sympathetic towards her and want her to come out clean in the end despite her actually going through with being a mule. I'm hoping she doesn't turn out like Carrie Henn from Aliens who did quite a great job for a little girl but didn't make another film afterwards.<br /><br />It's not a typical Hollywood film, it is in subtitles and it's not the most happiest of topics but Catalina's performance makes it stand out(too bad she lost the Oscar to that damn Swank girl, bah).</p></br><a href="../users/A17FLA8HQOFVIG.html">A17FLA8HQOFVIG</a><br/><p>This 2004 Independent film has won all kinds of awards and I can well understand why.  It deals with a subject that I've been vaguely aware of and brings it up close and personal.  And it does it so well that I felt I was right inside the film, feeling the pressures of a young Columbian woman as she makes her choice to smuggle drugs into the United States.<br /><br />We first meet Maria in her native land, where she works all day picking roses and preparing them for export.  In spite of the beauty of the flowers, it is physical labor with an unfeeling boss who won't even let Maria go to the bathroom when she needs to.  Her family needs the few pesos she earns and are upset when she quits her job.  But she has another secret.  She's pregnant.  And her boyfriend is a real loser.  She refuses to marry him and leaves her small town to look for work in Bogot&aacute;.  Immediately she's recruited to be a "mule", swallowing rubber pellets filled with a white powder and then boarding a passenger plane to America.  The audience then gets to see exactly what this means.  Maria is told not to eat anything for 24 hours.  Then she is given some sort of anesthetic to keep her intestines quiet.  And then, with grueling realism, we watch as she gags and chokes and eventually swallows 63 of these pellets which look about 2 inches long and an inch or so wide.  We also meet her traveling companions, one of which is Lucy, who has made the trip on two different occasions and teaches Maria how to practice swallowing grapes so she learn to do the task.  There's also her best friend, Blanca, from the flower factory. The plane ride is a horror.  And when she goes to the bathroom and expels a pellet, she has to re-swallow it again.<br /><br />But that is not the end of the story.  Eventually Maria does make it through and is taken to a motel in New Jersey.  And her experience with the young men whose job it is to get the pellets after they are expelled is a nightmare.  He friend Lucy gets sick, very sick.<br /><br />Maria and Blanca eventually make their way to Jackson Heights in the Borough of Queens.  She has an address of Lucy's sister.  Life in America is hard for the sister who is married and pregnant, but she agrees to let Maria and Blanca stay with her.  Now Maria gets a little bit of a taste of America.  It is very strange to her.<br /><br />An unknown actress named Catalina Sandino Moreno plays the role of Maria.  She is fabulous.  And, I understand that in the Berlin Film Festival she tied with Charlize Theron (Monster) for best actress.  Everyone in the cast is wonderful though and so is the directing and cinematography.  There was tension in every scene and I felt I was right there with her, experiencing the drug world as this cast of characters does.  There are no guns or big money displayed in this film.  It's only about the little people who are caught in the drug world's web.  This is a fine film and the fact that I found myself retching as I watched it, only reinforces its realism.<br /><br />Highly recommended, but not for anyone with a weak stomach.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GCHG6U8HTVIT.html">A2GCHG6U8HTVIT</a><br/><p>This story of a young Columbian woman who agrees to become a mule to transport heroin into the U.S. is realistic, very linear and very affecting. Maria is a poor, independent-minded woman who has quit her job in the sweat-house flower growing industry and has learned she's pregnant. She agrees to become a mule, swallowing large capsules of compressed heroin and attempting to get past U.S. inspectors after a flight to New York. She's picked up by paid thugs who take her to a cheap safe house to wait until the capsules pass through her body. The whole process is shown realistically. The dangers are real, from capture by the authorities to death if one of the capsules ruptures inside the body. This happens to one of the women on the same flight with her, and the movie plays out the consequences to Maria. As demeaning and brutal as the process is shown to be, the movie ends on some small notes of hope.<br /><br />The acting is first rate. The actress who plays Maria had never acted before and does an outstanding job. The character she plays can be stubborn, not always honest, brave when she needs to be.

Then, Mar&iacute;a has to survive to the fear of being caught by the police, and to the death of another "mule" that became her friend at the hands of the men who were supposed to receive the cocaine.<br /><br />Will Mar&iacute;a die too?. What will happen to her?. You will learn that when you watch "Mar&iacute;a full of grace". Strangely enough, you will care for what happens with the impetuous Mar&iacute;a, because this movie will allow you to understand what kind of situation can convince someone to become a drug smuggler. Despite that, understanding the reasons for a decision doesn't mean justifying it, and I don't.<br /><br />All the same, I think writer/director Joshua Marston should be congratulated on a movie well done, that gives a human face to the "mules" that help drug lords to smuggle drugs. We come to realize that sometimes the mules are the victims of extraordinarily bad decisions that they cannot correct in time due to threats to their families, and fear. Catalina Sandino Moreno as Mar&iacute;a conveys very believable what a person is likely to feel, in such a difficult situation.<br /><br />On the whole, I really liked this movie, even though at times it was difficult to watch due to the emotional agony some of the characters transmited. "Mar&iacute;a full of grace" won't make you smile, but it will make you think. That is sometimes enough, isn't it ?.<br /><br />Belen Alcat</p></br><a href="../users/A1L43KWWR05PCS.html">A1L43KWWR05PCS</a><br/><p>This is an outstanding independent film by director-writer Joshua Marston that has received excellent critical reviews and caused quite a stir at various film festivals, winning the 2004 Sundance Film Festival Audience Award,  and garnering a 2004 Best Actress award at the Berlin Film Festival for newcomer Catalina Sandino Moreno. Filmed in Spanish with subtitles, it is definitely a must see film.<br /><br />The film tells the story of a beautiful, headstrong teenager, Maria Alvarez (Catalina Sandino Moreno), who lives in a rural area of Columbia with limited opportunities. She works on a flower plantation and helps to support her mother, her sister, and her sister's out-of-wedlock baby. She has a best friend, Blanca (Yenny Paola Vega), and a boorish boyfriend, Juan (Wilson Guerrero). All of them have limited futures, and Maria seems to sense that she is definitely on the road to nowhere.<br /><br />Maria is sick of her demanding family, as she sees that her sister, who does nothing to contribute to her family's welfare, is treated better by their mother than she is. Maria is also tired of her job at the flower plantation, where she is treated little better than a serf. Pregnant by her boyfriend but unwilling to enter into a loveless marriage with him, she is introduced to Franklin (John Alex Toro), a seemingly more worldly young man than she is accustomed to meeting.  It is he who introduces her to the high risk job of being a drug mule to the United States. The money, five thousand dollars, is far more than Maria is accustomed to earning, and, suddenly, the inherent risks seem to fade into the background.  It seems to the pregnant Maria that the whole world could be her oyster.<br /><br />The film gives a very explicit birds-eye view of the life as a drug mule. It shows the viewer just how the process works, from the swallowing of the encapsulated drugs to their eventual evacuation from the drug mule's body. It also shows what can happen when the drugs leak into the mule's system.  Of course, when dealing with illicit drugs, one is also forced into interacting with drug dealers. In her brief career as a drug mule, Maria is faced with all of these situations, as is her best friend, Blanca, who against Maria's advice, also makes the journey to the United States, stomach bloated with drugs, along with two other girls.<br /><br />Once in flight, there are signs of things not going as smoothly as planned. When they land, further complications arise. These increase, once they are in the drug dealer's lair, and the evacuation process begins. Unfortunately, the worst case scenario presents itself, and Maria reacts in a way that has the potential for extreme ramifications for her and her family. Maria, however, is a survivor by nature. When the danger is averted, and the time comes for her return home, Maria makes a last minute decision that will forever change her life and that of her unborn child.<br /><br />Catalina Sandino Moreno is a natural, and it does not hurt that she is also beautiful. Her portrayal of Maria is sensitive, yet, strong and compelling. She is, indeed, full of grace. She is also the linchpin around whom the entire film revolves, and she certainly is up to the job. The screenplay is tautly written with just the right amount of tension. Moreover, Joshua Marston's deft direction, as well as the stellar performances by the entire cast, adds up to a superlative film that should not be missed.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>Maria Alvarez works in a flower factory in Columbia, de-thorning roses for a living at the brusque age of seventeen. Her hands ache and bleed, her boss is verbally abusive, and her family (as most seventeen year olds think) don't understand that she wants more out of life. Then one day she meets a young boy who introduces her to a drug runner who hires "mules" (women who carry drugs in their stomachs and into the United States) and Maria's life changes drastically.<br /><br />But is it all for the worst?<br /><br />That's tough to say. Although we all know the terrible things that happen to these young girls (rapes, the pellets leaking in their stomachs and killing them, being arrested by border agents, etc.), the viewer has kind of a dark sympathy for Maria and her fellow mules. The amount of money they can make in one trip ($5,000) is a simple treasure to them.<br /><br />It took me a while to review this film simply because it IS so disturbing. The drug trade is a terrible thing that kills people all the time, but in this film we get to see how it benefits one individual ...but at what cost? Emotionally she's nearly torn apart (she has to watch another mule slowly, painfully, die after a drug pellet leaks in her stomach), but it also makes her a stronger person. She has means (via cash) to support herself and, come to find out, her unborn child.<br /><br />Will Maria remain in America, or return to her family in Columbia and raise her child there while continuing to be a mule? You'll have to watch it and find out.<br /><br />A simple film with a powerful message; a message that isn't as easy to swallow as a pouch full of heroin.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EHTFVSD0H7I6.html">A1EHTFVSD0H7I6</a><br/><p>I've hesitated to rent Maria Full of Grace. Do I really want to immerse myself into the heartbreaking world of drug mules? Finally, I grabbed it and sat down to watch. On several levels Maria may be the most disturbing film I've ever seen. A young girl faced with a future that leaves her feeling hopeless. Her boyfriend, selfish, young, more interested in drinking and his friends than her, offers her freedom from her life of working to help out the family. But would life with him be any more like life than the one she so wants to escape. Her job, menial, difficult and the only one out there, wears her down, especially when she has to contribute to the care and upkeep of her selfish sister and small nephew.<br /><br />A new guy heads into town, dances with her, opens up some possibilities of life that is more than mere existing. So she jumps at the challenge and opportunity that he dangles over her. Unfortunately the challenge is swallowing pellets full of drugs and the opportunity is traveling to America to spend time in a cramped hotel room waiting while her body expels 62 pellets.<br /><br />The trip goes bad in a horrific way, and Maria is left to fend for herself in New York City. Maria has to come to some heavy decisions regarding future. Everything has changed and she will never be the teenager she was.<br /><br />Aside from the horror of the situation, the film is well done and compelling. In Spanish with English subtitles with realistic dialogue peppered with the F-word. Those who like documentaries, historically accurate films, crossroads moments and raw storytelling should find Maria to be a thought provoking movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A38I00SO3D9ZSM.html">A38I00SO3D9ZSM</a><br/><p>It's nearly impossible to take your eyes off Catalina Sandino Moreno.  Though beautiful, it's her performance, not her looks, that captivates.  You feel the indignities and frustrations of Maria's life.  Her desperation, which drives her to a near-tragic end, is palpable.<br /><br />Lots of movies have glorified (for lack of a better word) drug dealers and the drug trade (think: Blow, Scarface.)  Maria Full of Grace, quite beautifully, shows the conditions which drive otherwise good people into that lucrative "business."  This film moves steadily but hardly at a breakneck pace; yet, it is intense and keeps its viewers glued to the screen.<br /><br />Maria Full of Grace is one of the best movies I've seen in the last few years.  Everything about it -- acting, script, cinematography -- is great.</p></br><a href="../users/A18758S1PUYIDT.html">A18758S1PUYIDT</a><br/><p>The desperately poor women who become carriers of drugs--inside their stomachs, no less--risk a terrible death but are willing to do so for the chance to live in the U.S.  Not a propaganda piece, but a hard, cold look at the truth.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MQQI4UYT9C11.html">A2MQQI4UYT9C11</a><br/><p>Maria is a young dissatisfied Columbian woman (actually 17) who works at a rose plantation to help support her family, including her unwed-mother sister. Life, including work, boyfriend and family, continue to grate on her and she gravitates to a recruiter of "mules"--young women who swallow latex-covered "pellets" of heroin to transport by commercial airline to New York City. Her veteran trainer describes the work as "not difficult, but not easy, either". I couldn't find the easy part. Swallowing in excess of 50 pellets didn't look too easy; nor did facing the suspicious US Customs agents; nor did risking the overdose that loomed if any the pellets broke.<br /><br />The result is a heartbreaking tale of longing for a better life and how criminal elements can exploit that longing. The "grace" of the title presages Maria's outcome, but much pain and sadness populates this movie as well. Catalina Sandino Moreno is riveting as the determined Maria and all the other cast members do a fine job well. The production and directorial-style and very straightforward so as to not distract from the compelling story.<br /><br />This movie is in Spanish with English subtitles. With the drug-related story and one violent scene, it is not really suitable for sub-teenage children, though it would help teenagers understand better the costs of the drug culture.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VCLTAGM5RLND.html">A1VCLTAGM5RLND</a><br/><p>This is one of the better films of 2004. Well acted, well written, and very unique in its story. From beginning to the end Joshua Marston chooses to present the story in a way that has us relating and sympathizing with Maria in her plight to find her place in the sun.</p></br><a href="../users/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ.html">A12X2J7AVZ04IQ</a><br/><p>It took me a few days for this film to sink in (I rented it). The hopelessness and frustration of being stuck in a poverty-stricken area of Colombia was so well portrayed by director, Joshua Marston. Poor Maria is stuck in a rut, with her whole life ahead of her, and knows she can do better. Enter the chance to travel & make money; Maria thinks twice and agrees anyway. After all, it can't be all that bad...right? Well, I'm not going to blab away any plot points, but Catalina Sandino Mareno embodies the drab, as well as the strong; ultimately the outraged and determined heroine of this disturbing film. To me, the ugliness of the drug situation wasn't made ugly enough. Mr. Marston chose brevity over outrage, and hit all the right marks. He relied on Ms. Moreno to convey, and his choice was dead-on. This brillant young actress (23 at the time, playing a 17 year old) has a formidable career ahead of her. Will she win the Oscar? Probably not. I think it'll be another slug-fest between Swank & Bening, and no one's seen Staunton (who should win); and don't discard Winslet, who's outrageously energetic performance can't be discarded (she's also been nominated, and lost, more than the others).Despite idiot choices by the Academy in the past, it's comforting to know that true excellence is being recognized. I'll be waiting to hear of Ms. Moreno's next project.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>MARIA FULL OF GRACE  is an unpretentious, low budget, superb little film that has managed to captivate the hearts of audiences everywhere. Writer/Director Joshua Marston has opted for extracting a slice of life in Colombia, found characters who symbolize the passions of young people who seek a  better life, and shows us how indomitable the human spirit can be.<br /><br />Maria (portrayed by a gifted and beautiful young Catalina Sandino Moreno) lives among the poor in Colombia, earning a living for her mother and sister by stripping thorns off roses in a factory.  Unhappy with her work conditions and with her useless boyfriend who has impregnated her, she has the courage to quit her job and at the encouragement of a passing acquaintance  agrees to serve as a 'mule' to transport drugs form Colombia to the United States.<br /><br />The film documents the means of transporting (swallowing many bags of drugs in a harrowing manner, riding an airplane with the fears associated with her  mission, arriving in America with all the terror of being in a strange place with a dangerous mission) in a way that feels so real that we as audience identify wholly with Maria.<br /><br />The story is new, the acting is superb, and the many underlying messages are profound.  This is a film for every audience. An excellent film in Spanish with English subtitles.<br /><br />Grady Harp</p></br><a href="../users/A2FEGRJQNU51P9.html">A2FEGRJQNU51P9</a><br/><p>A film by Joshua Marston<br /><br />Maria Alvarez (Catalina Sandino Moreno) de-thorns roses at a flower plantation in a small Colombian town.  She recently learned that she is pregnant by her boyfriend whom she does not love nor does he love her.  After being poorly treated by her employer, Maria quits her job and needs to find work.  Maria helps to support her family, which includes her sister and nephew.  Her sister doesn't work.  The only job options are to return to the flower plantation or travel many miles away to get work in a city.  She meets a young man named Franklin (John Alex Toro) who suggests another option: Maria could work as a mule.<br /><br />A mule is the person who transports drugs from Colombia to America.  In the case of the mules in "Maria Full of Grace", the mules swallow 60 or more pellets filled with heroin and transport the drugs inside of the mule.  There is still great risk: the mule can still be caught by customs and submit to an X-Ray which will reveal the pellets; a pellet can break open inside the mule, essentially sentencing the person to death; or the mule can lose a pellet by using the bathroom.  Losing a pellet can result in horrible consequences for the family of the mule, as the drug lord threatened Maria and her family.  American may be the Land of Opportunity, but "Maria Full of Grace" shows why a Colombian girl with no criminal leanings would choose to enter this life.  The opportunities are simply not there in Colombia.  A mule could buy a house for her family with just one paycheck.<br /><br />This film does not shy away from graphically showing us what can happen to those who traffic drugs across the border.  We see every possible consequence to being a mule, from the good to the horribly bad.  While Joshua Marston does not hand us a moral judgment on Maria, I don't see that there is any way that he is giving any sort of approval to the life of a mule, either. I just know that those characters which chose to continue in that life are not going to have an easy or very long life.  Sooner or later time and reality will catch up.  The mule is a beast or burden and will not long live a life of luxury.<br /><br />Catalina Sandino Moreno did a fantastic job as Maria.  It is difficult to believe that this was only her first role in a movie (much like Bryce Dallas Howard in "The Village", only this movie is actually good).  Moreno is so self assured in "Maria Full of Grace", but also frightened or unsure when circumstances call for it.  We get why a basically moral young woman would make the decision she did.  For Maria being a mule is not entering a life of crime, but rather an opportunity in a land of no opportunities.  Moreno truly is the star of this movie and I would love to see her nominated for this performance.<br /><br />"Maria Full of Grace" is one of the year's best films and it is moving, heartbreaking, and even uplifting.  Second time director Joshua Marston looks to have a very good future ahead of him if he can keep making movies as good as "Maria Full of Grace".  The story and the performances really make this foreign language movie shine.  Grade: A<br /><br />-Joe Sherry</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDNTB7377YH2.html">A1CDNTB7377YH2</a><br/><p>This is the best foreign film I have seen in years.  Maria, has a fight with her boss and losses her job.  She can't go back and face her family because they need the money and also she is pregnant and doesn't want to live with the father of her child's family.  Maria heads to Bogata, befriending a young man on a motorcycle.  She explains her plight to him and he takes her to someone who can help.  He is a mafia-type working upstairs in a bar.  He will pay her well to be a mulo (mule) which means that she will have to swallow a lot of cocaine packets and carry them to a contact point in New Jersey.<br /><br />Maria, desperate goes along and is joined by a friend.  She soon finds that it is a much harder job than she thought because she can't swallow one of the packets, much less the 50 or so she is expected to swallow.  Then there is the fear of getting caught including several tense moments going through Newark immigration and seeing another woman with her caught.  On top of it is the knowledge that if one packet breaks, she will die.  Such is the fate of one of the ladies travelling on her plane.  When that woman is treated like trash by the contacts in New Jersey, Maria decides to flee.  With no place to go, no knowledge of English, and no right to stay in the US, Maria must find a way to survive.<br /><br />Great cinematography especially in Colombia.  Having been there I felt myself transported back.  Also, the director captures the feel of Jackson Heights, New York, where the later part of the film takes place.<br /><br />Great acting and a very compelling story.  This one should not be missed!</p></br></body></html>

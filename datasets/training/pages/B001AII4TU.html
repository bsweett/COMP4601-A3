He has no desire to be in charge, but he has to find someone else to take his place so he won't be stuck with the crown.<br /><br />Pros: I love everything about Puss n' boots, and it's no coincidence that I'm that smitten with Antonio Banderas, too. Both the cat and the man have major swagger. Although I can't get into some of the movies Eddie Murphy has been in, he does a great job as Donkey. I don't think anybody else could be quite as funny as he is playing that part. Same goes for Mike Myers as Shrek. But I just kept listening to Artie and thinking, "He sounds so familiar." Mr. Sexyback Timberlake is playing his role, and he did an excellent job. I fell out laughing at the line about "relating" to him.<br /><br />Like the other two Shrek movies, this movie was funny, the technical animation was impressive, the plot was interesting and I loved how strong the women were. I was amused with them getting into position--classic. Good to see my buddy Pinocchio and the Gingerbread Man, too. Great movie. The jokes in this Shrek series is better than most of the comedic films out for the past 10 years--the writers didn't try too hard. The film was just naturally amusing. I highly recommend it. I can't wait to see the final movie in a couple days.</p></br><a href="../users/A1UFV4HALV2OXW.html">A1UFV4HALV2OXW</a><br/><p>Fans of Shrek won't be disappointed in the third movie in the series.

I remember Mike Myers having to go on tour to promote this film and not only did he seem to cringe trying to explain it or talk about, he very clearly seemed depressed about it.<br /><br />Like so many others have said, the allure of the original film has long since vanished and leaves this current offering from Dreamworks as probably the worst movie they've ever made.<br /><br />Recently, I realized how much my son loved the original Shrek movie when he kept bringing me the DVD case in the afternoon and pointing at the TV wanting to watch it. He laughed during the silly parts, clapped during and after the fight scenes and danced during all the songs. Twenty minutes into the third installment, he turned away, left the room and wanted nothing to do with it. I turned it off and he went back to coloring. About an hour later, out of curiosity, I put the original Shrek back in the DVD and he was stuck to it - once more - clapping, laughing and dancing until the very end where he danced to the 'Swamp Party Karaoke' scene.<br /><br />I guess the message is this: Shrek isn't a played out concept at all. Shrek is very endearing and a lovable character. He always will be. I actually like Donkey the best. But the people in charge of this project forgot who this film was supposed to be targeted at and thus have been left with a real stinker.<br /><br />The sad thing is that we will probably see Shrek 4 sometime soon, and they'll be trying to hammer home more of this adult-driven nonsense.</p></br><a href="../users/AOTMP0OKJOUWI.html">AOTMP0OKJOUWI</a><br/><p>I loved the first two films.  I was hoping this would be great as well.<br /><br />And it tries, it really did try. To its credit, there were several very clever scenes. The typical Snow White's gift with animals takes an awesome turn, and I can guarantee that you will never laugh harder at a death scene than the one of this movie. The animation? Top-notch.<br /><br />I just guess effort doesn't always beat out sheer inspiration. A film with a few moments does not win against a good, simple movie.<br /><br />The desire to produce a film merely ended up as a plot device to get Shrek and Fiona back to their beloved swamp. A long, boring plot device. With the passing of King Harold, Shrek and Fiona are heirs to the throne of Far, Far Away. Unfortunately, that does not interest them, so Shrek goes on a journey to bring back the next guy, a young Arthur "Artie" Pendragon. Heck, why not? Everyone loves a good Camelot infusion, and Artie is as flawed and as likable as you could want. Unfortunately, he is only one character in a cheesy madhouse of minor characters and cameos. In the effort to get everyone their screen time, that whole plot gets lost in the background.<br /><br />Which normally wouldn't be a problem. After all, the original movie did not have the most complex of plots. What it had was a few incredible characters. The second movie added a few more, but still kept it delightfully manageable. This time, it seemed that the powers that be assumed we already knew everything about Shrek, Donkey, Puss, and the rest of the bunch that we really didn't need to see them. Hey, let's bring in one more characters for the audience, but refuse to give them time to get to know them! Poor, pathetic lack of character development.<br /><br />So back to the plot. The few times that came around, it was pretty much a tacky, forced attempt to create some pseudo father/son relationship between Shrek and Artie. Good intentions, but no cigar. Maybe if we had more time... But we don't, so let's just wrap it up with a few corny lines about understanding and rising to the occasion. Yeah, we got that the first time around, and without any of the verbal commentary.<br /><br />On top of that, this film misses that inexplicable spark of the first two installments. I'm sorry, but I just didn't feel it. Just as a lukewarm attempt of continuing the series and aiming at a five-year old audience.<br /><br />Sorry. Not my favorite of the series by any means, leaving me to wonder how a sequel to films of such genius as "Shrek" and "Shrek 2" could make something so average?</p></br><a href="../users/AJMU8VVFKMZI4.html">AJMU8VVFKMZI4</a><br/><p>Though there are a few funny jokes, Shrek 3 just feels long and flat. One can't escape the feeling that we've been here before. It literally is a paint by numbers production designed just to bring in the bucks. I certainly hope that the series end here. It's not a bad movie per se, but it certainly not a good one either.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JH5J1KQAUBMP.html">A1JH5J1KQAUBMP</a><br/><p>Unwilling to assume control of the land of Far Far Away in accordance with the wishes of the deceased Frog King (John Cleese), Shrek (Mike Myers) enlists the aid of Donkey (Eddie Murphy) and Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas) to bring back the long lost Arthur (Justin Timberlake) to rule in his place.  However, even as he attempts to evade one type of responsibility, he learns that he is about to face another: becoming a father.  And then there is the threat of Prince Charming (Rupert Everett), who has assembled an army of storybook villains.<br /><br />There's plenty going on in this third installment of the popular series that is just as much fun for adults as it is for children.  The animation and voice talent are top notch, and the screenplay does a good job of keeping the large cast of supporting characters in play.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RKI7RPP5CJMG.html">A2RKI7RPP5CJMG</a><br/><p>"Shrek The Third" might lack the originality of the original film, but it's still a very good movie.  Shrek is once again put into an uncomfortable position, except this time around he isn't trying to win Fiona's heart or impress her parents.  This time he's been chosen to replace his father-in-law as the king of Far Far Away.  He quickly finds out that there is one other potential heir to the throne called Arthur.  Once he figures out where Arthur is located, Shrek, Donkey, and Puss set out to find the boy and convince him that he should be king.  Before leaving, however, Shrek is weighed down with more pressure when he finds out that he'll soon be a dad.  While Shrek's away, Charming gathers up all of fairytale-dom's meanest villains (including Captain Hook and the Wicked Witch from "Snow White") and stages a successful coup to become ruler of Far Far Away.  Using Fiona and her friends as bait, Charming awaits Shrek's return in order to finish him off and become the rightful king.<br /><br />I think the reason that many people dislike this film so much is that the spotlight shines considerably less on Shrek, Donkey, and Puss than it did it the previous films.  Fiona, Snow White, Cinderella, Beauty (of "Beauty and the Beast"), Rapunzel and Sleeping Beauty all get a decent amount of camera time.  Lesser sidekicks like Pinocchio and Gingey also take the camera off of Shrek.  Even Charming gets ample screentime along with his fellow villains.  Does this make the film any better or worse than the others?  Not in my opinion.  In fact, the princesses add quite a bit of humor to the film (not to mention a sweet action sequence set to a cover of Heart's "Barracuda").  Charming and his companions also offer some fun moments.  The addition of two other characters, Arthur and Merlin, also give the viewer more to laugh at.<br /><br />I'll agree with others who stated that the fart jokes and other sophomoric humor can be excessive, but no more than in the other films.  In fact, jokes like that got the children laughing more than in the other two films which, in my opinion, had more humor for the adults than this sequel.<br /><br />All of the original voice talents make it back for the film, and a few new voices are added as well.  These include Justin Timberlake, Eric Idle, and a few old SNLers.  It's nice to see that SNL's castmates stick so close together.<br /><br />Overall, this film is better suited for the youngsters when compared to the other films.  However, that doesn't mean that the adults in the audience miss out on any of the fun.  This will be a definite purchase when it rolls out on DVD.  I recommend it as a buy.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R6RA8FRBS608.html">A2R6RA8FRBS608</a><br/><p>Shrek The Third is a good movie with incredible animation. I marvel at that animation! However, the plot is just average and it didn't really hold my attention the way I hoped it would. I think after this Dreamworks needs to move on to new develop new characters in new films; but only time will tell if Dreamworks wants to milk this theme yet again. The voiceovers are very well done and the DVD has a plethora of extras.<br /><br />When the action begins, Shrek (Mike Myers) and his wife Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) are filling in for the ailing King Harold (John Cleese). Unfortunately, King Harold passes away and, with his dying wish, names Shrek as the rightful heir to the throne. This doesn't sit too well with Shrek who has been suffering from public relations embarrassment to public relations embarrassment as he launches ships with such strength that the ship blows a hole and sinks--and more. King Harold says, just before he dies, that the only other heir to the throne would be a young man at school named Arthur (Justin Timberlake). Immediately after the funeral for King Harold, Shrek, Donkey (Eddie Murphy) and Puss-in-boots (Antonio Banderas) set sail to find Arthur at school. Things go downhill even more when Artie (as Arthur is called) is ambivalent at best to become a king; and it's up to Shrek and his buddies to convince Arthur to become king.<br /><br />Of course, things back in Far, Far Away Land aren't much better. Prince Charming (Rupert Everett) and his cronies take over the kingdom and imprison Fiona and her friends including Fiona's mother. Things look pretty bleak.<br /><br />Of course, the plot can go anywhere from here. (Yes, I know, you've read the spoilers by now but I won't give them away anyway.) Will Fiona and the other women be able to break free and fight the evil Prince Charming? How does Shrek react when he finds out he's becoming a father? What happens to Puss-in-boots and Donkey when an old wizard accidentally casts a spell on them so that they are trapped in each other's bodies? Watch the movie and find out!<br /><br />The DVD extras are very extensive. The commentary is great; and I like the bonus feature that includes a man going through a storyboard of a deleted scene at the school where Arthur is standing on line to get his lunch. There are funny "suggestions" from Donkey, Shrek and other characters as to how to deal with the problems of parenthood; and there are web links as well.<br /><br />Overall, this is a good effort and a movie to watch when a better one is unavailable. However, Shrek fans will love this movie. This is best suited for families with kids that are at least 8 or 9 years old because of some crude humor that you wouldn't want younger kids to experience.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HVL790PBWYTU.html">A2HVL790PBWYTU</a><br/><p>Some SPOILERS follow.<br /><br />Even though Shrek - Sir Shrek, that is - and Princess Fiona have become a fixture at the royal court of the kingdom of Far Far Away, it doesn't mean that our ogrish hero has to like it. With Fiona's father having been transformed into a frog (see SHREK 2) and then falling ill, Shrek grumpily chips in by undertaking some of his dad-in-law's royal chores. But the mantle of the purple settles uncomfortably on Shrek's shoulders (and it probably itches, too). All he really wants to do is take Fiona and go back to his beloved swamps. But that would have to wait when the fast expiring King names Shrek as his successor. But Shrek doesn't want the crown and so, with Donkey and Puss in Boots in tow and again providing sidekick duties, he goes on a journey to fetch the next guy in line for the throne - Prince Arthur. Of course, there are obstacles awaiting Shrek. For one thing, Fiona lays down some news which distresses our ogre. Then Prince Charming, who's been reduced to entertaining in dinner theater, decides to make another bid for his own "happily ever after." Accordingly, he manages to enlist a heapload of fairy tale villains (Captain Hook, Rumpelstiltskin, the Headless Horseman, the Cyclops, several villainous trees, and more...).<br /><br />SHREK THE THIRD, while being a fun and funny flick, is the least of the three Shrek movies. Of course, the element of surprise, which made the first Shrek film such an uberhit as it riotously turned fairy tale tradition on its ear, is long since gone. The sequel provided us with the kingdom of Far Far Away, which paved the way for even more snarky, nudge-in-the-rib stabs at pop culture in general and at the Disney film factory line in particular. Some of the wit is still here in SHREK THE THIRD, though not as razor sharp. The humor still made me smile, though it wasn't quite as subversive or as disarming. Basically, it's all stuff I'd seen already. I was waiting for something new to knock me off my feet. It didn't happen.<br /><br />The movie suffers most when the spotlight is on its newest character Prince Arthur. As voiced by Justin Timberlake, "Artie's" tepid personality proves to be a detriment not so easily brushed aside. Artie is introduced as a loser teen and then, as the film progresses, supposedly shows his mettle when he reveals his smarts by throwing a crying fit and, later on, by unveiling his gift of gab (where was this when he was getting picked on in medieval high school?). To me, Artie comes off as wheedling and even a bit disingenuous. The fact that he took screen time away from Shrek and that he has a significant role to play in the film's resolution just doesn't sit well with me.<br /><br />Points are also taken away for not giving heftier roles to Donkey and Puss in Boots. These two great characters are pretty much relegated to the background. Their one highlight sub-plot, which has them switching bodies, doesn't pay off with anything significant and is, therefore, superfluous and lame to the nth power. It was funny, though, to watch Puss, while in Donkey's form, attempt to use his "cute" power.<br /><br />Despite a nagging feeling of "Is that it?" I have to point out that there's still so much going for this film. For one thing, the old reliables are at it again. Mike Meyers as Shrek, Cameron Diaz as Fiona, Eddie Murphy as Donkey, and Antonio Banderas as Puss in Boots have their characters down pat and their voice performances are seamless. Meanwhile, John Cleese as the frog king is priceless in his one prolonged cameo. Newcomers of note are Eric Idle as the slightly skewed Merlin and several SNL actresses portraying various fairy tale princesses. Rupert Everett also returns as that royal swine Prince Charming and is majestically over the top, while Ian McShane has several standout moments as Captain Hook.<br /><br />The incorporation of classic rock music adds a nice touch to several scenes, although it's a bit odd to hear Led Zeppelin, Heart, and Wings in an animation. But, hey, any chance to hear "Barracuda" or "Live and Let Die" is a good thing. The animation? Wow! It's amazing. If anything, the CG is even better than in the prior Shrek flicks. For example, the expressions on the characters' faces are realistically conveyed. Even when groaning thru the one scene of Prince Charming tossing his hair in slow motion, I still couldn't help but note the excellence of the graphics. So, yes, a well-deserved pat on the back for DreamWorks.<br /><br />SHREK THE THIRD has already made piles of money and stands to make even more with the dvd release. And, apparently, a fourth installment is in the works, as well as a Puss in Boots spin-off. While this third film doesn't live up to the quality and originality of the first two, it still boasts several sparkling moments, the aforementioned frog king scene being only one of 'em. There are also some nice bits with the Princesses Snow White, Cinderella, and Sleeping Beauty. I also liked that the medieval high school girls spoke with "thees" and "thous" but in a Valley accent. And, of course and always, at the heart of this franchise, there is Shrek, the cantankerous ogre with the heart of gold. True, he doesn't do much here (his supporting cast supply most of the smiting) but he does provide the grounding element of the movie and remains the preferred point of view character for the audience. As more Shrek movies are churned out, it's nice to see that some things do stay the same.<br /><br />SHREK THE THIRD elicits some laughs, plenty of smiles, and, sadly, a few yawns. The good will garnered from the first two installments goes quite a ways in carrying this film. Ultimately, I do consider the time and money to have been well spent on this one. So, yes, I got my Shrek on, now go get yours.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1EDCBV2KU8D.html">A3Q1EDCBV2KU8D</a><br/><p>Continuing on the Shrek franchise, this one looks at Shrek not wanting to be king of Far Far Away after Feona's father dies, so he seeks to find another heir to the throne.  In the midst of that Prince Charming decides to take over Far Far Away.  A bunch of sub stories with Merlin and Author, and some fun scene, just not up to Shrek 1 or Shrek 2 standards.  Good to watch and because it is a series, good to own.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZHH7AK83JB5G.html">A2ZHH7AK83JB5G</a><br/><p>I'll say right out that the original SHREK is one of my favorite animated films of all time and though my memory of the second film is a little dim I know I enjoyed it too. SHREK THE THIRD carries on the good hearted fractured fairy tale themes of its predecessors but the misunderstood ogre gimmick is beginning to wear a bit thin.  Shrek and Fiona still make a sweet couple and Puss (Antonio Bandaras) and Donkey (Eddie Murphy) continue to play their parts as amusing sidekicks well.  The scenes at the medieval high school where Shrek and Company pick up the future King Arthur (Justin Timberlake) who is a bit of a teenage dweeb are quite amusing.  However some of the scenes such as at the villain tavern just seem so "busy" with ideas and characters that the viewer can't absorb it all.  I also didn't care for Fiona's fairy tale princess friends who get imprisoned and then escape with her and her mom (Julie Andrews) back in Far Far Away.  I did like the pop songs used on the soundtrack and the animation is stunning from beginning to end.  As in the other SHREK films there is an important message that all should believe in  themselves though young viewers might be a bit confused by Shrek's fear of becoming a father which is happily resolved by the film's ending.  SHREK THE THIRD is not a bad film but I hope Dreamworks is satisfied at leaving the series as a trilogy.</p></br><a href="../users/A25QJBK33C4O0R.html">A25QJBK33C4O0R</a><br/><p>My wife and I recently watched Shrek the Third on HD DVD. On HD DVD viewers should be impressed with the beautiful picture, nice bright colors and excellent detail on the animation and this disc doesn't disappoint at all. Prince Charming's hair flows in various directions, shadows and lighting throughout show great attention to detail by the animators/rendering team, etc.<br /><br />Story wise this was, as most critics seemed to point out, probably the weakest of the 3 movies, but not bad. If the first two movies hadn't set the bar so high, this one would have been better received, but a lot of the sight gags and inside jokes have been done in the first two movies, so you aren't as shocked and don't react as well this time.  (Note that there is one great sequence with the Gingerbread man {Gingy} that is almost worth the price of the disc by itself.)  Be aware that this film is also somewhat darker at longer periods of time (story wise) than in the first two movies.<br /><br />I have some questions about the extras that are available for this movie, as I'm curious if the web enabled updates will (as they should) add content over time for this title.  For example, my wife was looking for a segment of the Puss-in-boots dance similar to the Donkey dance segment that is available in the extras/web content.  If that sort of content is made available later, then the web enabled updates features will prove to be quite valuable for a movie like this.<br /><br />Worth the purchase price to me, but I suspect this one is more likely a rental for many viewers. I would love to see it packaged up as the Shrek Trilogy so that I could get the first two movies in HD (I have both on DVD, first movie on two disc DVD I think). If that is done, I hope they don't cheap out on the extras and include as much as they can in the set.</p></br><a href="../users/A2INL3AYAT6325.html">A2INL3AYAT6325</a><br/><p>I was right.<br />I knew from watching trailers & clips that the 3rd film is my least favorite of the 3 films.<br /><br />Not as funny.  No new good/funny characters.<br />Just did not have as much fun & good jokes as the first 2 films.<br /><br />Best thing about the film is the partial use of 3 songs-SPOILERS.  "Live & Let Die" my favorite Paul McCartney song.<br /><br />Now, the POOR DVD package.<br /><br />For a film that made as much money as it did what do we get when purchasing this DVD?<br />1.

Shrek the Third is nothing more than an excuse for excuse's sake to continue the franchise and for Hollywood to "ride the money train".I resisted watching this film in the theater, and it turned out for good reason. While it's not a total and utter disappointment like other films or sequels I've seen, it just lacks "the punch" that the first film possessed. There were some funny moments here and there, but the use of the same gags and humor for a third time around just lacks the punch line. To my disappointment, I read a while back of the plan to not only make a fourth Shrek film, but that a spin off with Puss in Boots is in the discussion stage as well. Has Hollywood grown this desperate?<br /><br />  Well, fortunately for them, they have the gullible public to fall back on so they will always make a profit. How much more pathetic and disappointing can Hollywood become and the public be? A boycott is called for (I.M.O) for people to be more responsible and deliver a message to demand a better film, more "bang" for your buck be produced rather than settle for the garbage over and over again. Costs have been rising in most places to see and enjoy a film in a theater. To some, maybe they are just easily entertained and like someone with tunnel vision and blinders on, they just can't tell the difference and any empty, shallow intelligence draining film will do. Come on, wake up folks.<br /><br />  I understand it's hard to say "No" to you kids. They are bombarded with commercials and toys of such films as Shrek virtually by the minute, but you could at least hold out for something better, and worst case scenario...wait until it hits the DVD shelf? These days the turn around has been widdled down to a few short months instead of years. So, in basic summery, Shrek the Third delivers a simple message of just "believing in oneself" surrounded by a basic story of Shrek inheriting the Kingdom of Far, Far Away but not wanting it because he's an Ogre. Prince Charming rallies all the other "losers" or the faerie world to take over the kingdom, Shrek is sent on a quest to retrieve the "next" in line, Fiona is pregnant and what you have here is a soap opera for kids.<br /><br />  Like I said, there are some laughs and some entertaining moments, but nothing to write home about. The first Shrek film is obviously the best of choice, and I did like the second one as well, but the third just doesn't deliver. Kids can't typically tell the difference, but parents should. How can you not know when you are being fed a plate of "crap"? I can sniff out a stinker a mile away and more.<br /><br />  There are many "give aways" and tell tale signs of how bad a film is going to suck. One of the easiest is when you have an original film that is rich, new and original such as the first "Shrek" film and then sequels are made to dilute everything down from one film to the next. Another is by being aware how much a film is being promoted. Sequels typically ride the shirt tales of profit and popularity. The more a film is promoted, the chances of it being a dud on screen is awfully high, or sometimes...the "lack of" promotion simply because the studio knows it will make  money is DVD sales and rentals no matter how bad it is. Lastly, you can pin it on talent, or lack there of. Bad actors make good scripts bad and bad ones ever worse, and occasionally the opposite, a badly written script or thought out plot can make a great actor look ridiculous.<br /><br />  Obvious stinkers are: The Incredible Hulk, Godzilla, Transformers, Titanic (made a blockbuster solely by "popularity"),The Ocean's 12,13 films, Star Wars: The Phantom Menace and it's following prequels, a few of the Star Trek films, Spiderman 2 and especially 3,Crank, Smoking Aces, The Fast and the Furious films/sequels and the list goes on and is ever growing. Do yourself a favor and be a bit more mindful of bad films before you grant them a 4 or 5 star rating and bit less of a gullible consumer.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>It would be safe to say that the third time is definitely NOT the charm when it comes to the "Shrek" series, since "Shrek the Third" lacks virtually all the imaginativeness, wit and magic that made the previous two installments such tremendous fun for young and old viewers alike.  In this latest go-round, the writers have clearly run out of comical inspiration, leaving us with a humorless farrago of labored jokes and sappy life-lessons (mainly about the joys of prospective fatherhood and the importance of being willing to take a chance in life) guaranteed to please no target audience or age group whatsoever.<br /><br />In this edition, Shrek's father-in-law, the frog king of the realm of Far Far Away, bequeaths his crown to Shrek on his deathbed unless the reluctant ogre can find a distant heir (the young Arthur) to take his place.  Shrek, filled with doubts about his own ability to rule the kingdom, heads off with his faithful companions, Donkey and Puss In Boots, to find the boy and bring him back to the castle where he will assume his rightful place on the throne.  Meanwhile, the vain, conniving Prince Charming has decided to enlist the aid of all the villains of the kingdom to mount a coup and proclaim himself king of the land.<br /><br />As I reckon them, there are about five hearty laughs in "Shrek the Third," and at least four of them come in the opening scene of the film (a very funny parody of third-rate dinner theater).  Unfortunately, it's all pretty much downhill from there, as one ostensibly comic line after another crashes and burns, leaving us with little but the gorgeous backdrops and seamless animation to hold our attention.  Regarding the latter point, it must be stated that movie animators have certainly come a long way in perfecting the facial expressions of their characters, but what is the point of such a technological advancement if it is placed in the service of as dismal a script as Andrew Adams, Howard Gould, Jeffrey Price, Peter S. Seaman, J. David Stern, David N. Weiss, and Jon Zack have concocted here?  Somehow, you know you're in trouble when no fewer than seven writers have a hand in a screenplay, but couldn't at least one of them have come up with a funny joke or two while they were hammering it all out?  Moreover, the story itself is dull and plodding and even the "Shrek" trademark of piling on clever pop culture references falls flat in this instance (and having Medieval teenagers blabbing away in already-dated Valley Girl lingo just doesn't cut it).<br /><br />Eddie Murphy and Antonio Banderas still provide yeoman service as the voices of Donkey and Puss In Boots, respectively, but even they can't keep the whole enterprise from feeling as if blockbuster rigor mortis has set in.  Unlike the two earlier films in the series, "Shrek the Third" feels less the product of a magic spell than of a divine curse.</p></br><a href="../users/A33CLVW2K7SL1P.html">A33CLVW2K7SL1P</a><br/><p>While a girl under the age of 10 was highly amused by this film (she laughed from beginning to end), she was mostly the lone voice in the theater. Some of the jokes have grown old, and others just weren't funny. Certain story elements didn't seem to fit, not for me at least. Bringing King Arthur in to rule over the magical land of Far, Far Away seemed a bit of a stretch. He's not exactly a fairy-tale creature as much as he is a legendary king (real or mythical).<br /><br />Shrek 4 has already been given a thumbs up, and I hope that everyone goes back to the drawing board and tries a bit harder the next time around. In the first two films they made us believe the unbelievable. This time they gave us scenes that were completely unbelievable. Prince Charming, capturing a kingdom and using theater to bring down his arch-enemy (Shrek)? Ah, no, that was just silly and uninspired.<br /><br />Pinocchio's lawyer-speak scene was funny, and so were a few with the gingerbread man. Let's hope they can bring all of the magic back next time.</p></br><a href="../users/A27FR2C67JPDRS.html">A27FR2C67JPDRS</a><br/><p>In a summer of threequels (Spidey 3, Shrek 3, and Pirates 3), everyone's favorite green orge returns, complete with his true love, Fiona, and his sidekicks, Donkey and Puss in Boots.  The Shrek franchise is a popular series of films (and a definite money maker) and this film should continue that trend.  However, this film is not quite up to par with its predecessors.<br /><br />The story begins in Far Far Away Land where Fiona's father dies, but not before asking Shrek to step into his royal shoes and rule the kingdom.  Shrek is none-to-happy to fulfill the dying wishes of his dead father-in-law and decides to seek out another heir to the throne who the dying monarch mentions before he croaks...pun intended!<br /><br />With Shrek off on an adventure to find the heir, who turns out to be Arthur or "Artie" (King Arthur and played rather dimly by Justin Timberlake), the scheming Prince Charming (Rupert Everett) returns with an army of fairy tale villains determined to steal the throne and banish his green rival once and for all.<br /><br />The story this time around seems to take a little longer to get rolling and doesn't quite have the charm of the first two films.  The film does have its moments and I did love the fact that this movie empowers the fairy tale heroines (played by the wickedly talented, Mya Rudolph, Amy Sedaris, Cheri Oteri and Amy Pohler) who are normally relegated to being saved by a handsome and heroic prince.  This time the girls including Cinderella, Snow White, Sleepy Beauty and Fiona rush to the rescue of the men and give the twisted fairy tale a "girl power" makeover!  Another charming aspect of the film is that we get to see Shrek as a daddy, which provides an upbeat and endearing ending to the film.  One thing that did bother me a little is Donkey and Puss switching bodies after a magic spell goes wrong.  It was a funny bit but after a while it was a little disconcerting to hear the voice of Antonio Banderas coming out of donkey's mouth and Eddie Murphy's coming out of Puss' mouth.  And, as far as Timberlake voicing Arthur, I wasn't all that impressed.  If he were replaced in the fourth film, it really wouldn't bother me at all.<br /><br />But if you are a Shrek fan, I think you will enjoy the film.  It does have some funny moments and the animation, as usual, is beautiful.  A good addition to the Shrek franchise.</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>When King Harold (John Cleese) falls ill and eventually croaks, Shrek (Mike Myers) takes over the duties of King of Far, Far Away.  He quickly realizes that he's just doesn't have what it takes to be a king. After all, he is an ogre.  When he learns of another relative in line for the throne, Shrek sets out with Donkey (Eddie Murphy) and Puss In Boots (Antonio Banderas) to find the long lost heir, Arthur (Justin Timberlake).  While Shrek is gone, Prince Charming (Rupert Everett) forms an army of evil doers and overtakes the city.  Fiona (Cameron Diaz) and her friends fight back, so that all is chaos by the time Shrek returns.<br /><br />I really enjoyed SHREK. I was even more impressed by SHREK 2 and in some ways think it is a superior movie to the original.  I was really looking forward to seeing SHREK THE THIRD and seeing how creative the filmmakers would get bringing together the fairy tale world of Shrek and the legends of King Arthur.<br /><br />I was severely disappointed to find that they chose not to be creative.  The plot of the movie is interesting enough, but the execution is horrible.  For instance, take the character of Merlin.  Instead of making him into a strong ally who could help Shrek and Artie, he's portrayed as a bumbling teacher of magic who was fired from Artie's school.  He can't remember his spells and seems to struggle with narcolepsy.  That idea of Merlin seems funny on paper, but it just doesn't work on screen.  Or take Prince Charming.  In SHREK 2 he was portrayed as the chosen heir to marry Fiona, raised by Fairy Godmother and groomed to be the perfect King.  In this installment he's downgraded to being a bad actor re-enacting Shrek's defeat of Fairy Godmother.  Charming should be a great fighter and warrior, but instead he's portrayed as being a wimp who decides he will get his revenge by having a huge play where he literally kills Shrek on stage.  Then there's the last five minutes of the movie.  I won't say what it involves, but the musical montage completely ruins the tone of the rest of the movie.<br /><br />That's not to say the movie doesn't have some good moments.  I really enjoyed the medieval take on high school.  I also really enjoyed the princesses' revolt.  Still, there just wasn't enough good stuff to make up for the bad.<br /><br />Children will like SHREK THE THIRD and it is worth watching if you've seen the first two SHREK films.  However, if you're looking for the same style, humor, and tone that made the first two SHREK movies such a joy to watch, you won't find it here.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>As someone very special pointed out, the Shrek movies are all about pop culture references, and spotting the celebrity voices, rather than watching it properly for a movie.<br /><br />I'm sure if I re-watched the first two movies, I would be ultimately as fed up of them as I am this one. They were good when they first come out, but the third was one too far I think.<br /><br />There's just nothing stand out about the movie. It's the same tired jokes, the same nonsense once again, and it's just got really old.<br /><br />Is it worthwhile seeing? No, it's not, only if you seriously LOVED the first two, but otherwise, put it down and walk away.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>There is nothing wrong with "Shrek the Third." And nothing special either. That's what I thought after watching the film, which is certainly entertaining thanks to the wonderful voice cast and funny gags, but the funny part does not include the wicked and clever humor of the first "Shrek" film.<br /><br />Perhaps its weak story and unmemorable new characters ought to be blamed. Well, to be honest, the idea of a young, spoiled boy `Artie' who is brought from a high school by Shrek to be the king of "Far, Far Away" is not as interesting as Prince Charming, now second-rate actor playing himself on stage, returning as villain to take over the kingdom. The third "Shrek" tries to incorporate the first plot into the second while the latter has much more potential as the background story for side-splitting comedy.<br /><br />And we are told that Shrek is going to be a father, and through the unlikely friendship with rebellious Artie the green ogre learns to be one. That is not a bad idea, I admit, but at the same time it shows that "Shrek," both its characters and story, are now getting closer to the world and its values (Disney, for instance) which the original "Shrek" was poking fun at so effectively.<br /><br />In fact, funny as they are, the jokes in "Shrek the Third" have become more like familiar types that can be seen elsewhere. They borrow bits from "King Arthur" story (including retired Merlin, voiced by Eric Idle), bits from "losers" of the fables (such as Captain Hook), bits from "princesses" of famous tales (like Cinderella), but the film's script fails to develop any of these ideas.<br /><br />"Shrek the Third" is not a bad film. It is just average. But "average" is not something that we expect from Shrek and these lovable characters.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EOLRV216BXJ9.html">A1EOLRV216BXJ9</a><br/><p>Shrek the Third is not just an animation. It is a warm, hilarious movie that sees the growing up of Shrek and Fionna. While Shrek the original is about true romance, the Second is about meeting the parents and the Third is about getting ready to be a parent.<br /><br />In terms of characters, the duo of the donkey and the cat, royal to Shrek as always, is fun to watch. Prince Charming has a wicked voice (Rupert Everett) and such beautiful hair! The greater emphasis of the girl power and action scenes - Snow White, Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty - produce even more humour and excitement. In terms of animation, Princess Fionna is more beautiful than ever. Somehow her green face, big nose and plus size combined exudes real beauty. Her frown, her gaze and smile grab attention. In terms of storyline, there are gripping moments that may result in a tear or two - the last words of King Frog, the bond between Shrek and a young King-in-waiting, the downfall of Prince Charming.<br /><br />I can't say Shrek the Third outdo the previous two. All I can say is that it is a natural extension of its predecessors, providing as much entertainment and warmth. It feels good to see how the characters grow up and bond together. In terms of technical development, it also evolves to be more advanced and fluid. Prince Charming and the Queen mother can pass as real people if one doesn't look closely. You won't come out of the cinema disappointed.</p></br><a href="../users/A27CHILBK6HIL2.html">A27CHILBK6HIL2</a><br/><p>MOVIE: The summer of thirds continues. We've had Spider-Man 3 so far, which is in the running for biggest disappointment of the year, the third Pirates film is coming up and should be a blast, and we have Ocean's 13 and The Bourne Ultimatum rounding out the group of thirds. This monster month of May continues with Shrek The Third, and thankfully we have our first enjoyable film of the summer. Fans of the first two movies will flock to this one in great anticipation. The movie itself is a treat and will please kids and adults alike, but unfortunately the movie suffers from sequelitis in that it has lost some steam.<br /><br />While the movie is not as fresh as the first two it does offer plenty to entertain. The jokes come flying in fast and they are funny. There is a lot of physical comedy I guess you could say, but we still have the great popular culture references. There is also tons of humor that will fly right over the younger audience and make the experience worthwhile for adults. I saw a late screening and basically the entire audience was 17 and older and the place was a laugh factory. The movie even got applause at the end. Jokes like Puss saying goodbye to his many lovers or having a line like "You are royally . . ." with the curse word being blocked by a foghorn should give you a good belly laugh. In fact I felt that this movie was less orientated towards kids than the first two. The first two films had their fair share of farts and burps, but this installment toned back on it. The only kid orientated aspect of the film is having Justin Timberlake play Arthur, heir to the throne. Except that Arthur is in high school, so we get a scene of what school life would be like in the world of Shrek. I think a problem that some people will have is that there are so many characters now that it throws off the focus of the story. Characters like Pinocchio and Gingy serve simply as cutaways for jokes, while they are still hilarious it does lower the quality of the film when stacked up to what we've seen before.<br /><br />The biggest difference worth mentioning is the absence of director Andrew Adamson who made his start with the first two. Adamson's direction was superb and is the reason why the first two are just great comedic family films. Since he is busy with his Narnia empire he wasn't able to direct Shrek The Third. Adamson did do the story but he didn't do the screenplay. The result is a notable lack of structure and timing for the jokes and the story as a whole. It seems as if we are dropped in the middle of everything; there is no set up. Alas this is a sequel, but I think some establishing of the story couldn't have hurt. The other thing I had a problem with was the unbelievable overuse of popular songs. Some songs felt out of place and some just didn't work at all. There were too many songs and not enough score. Harry Gregson-Williams has been part of this franchise since the beginning and he returned to score the third one despite Andrew Adamson leaving. It feels like that they drown out his score completely with all the songs. Granted you don't go see a movie like this for the score, but I think the score played a big part in the first two and I hardly recall noticing most of it this time around. Thankfully he will be getting a score release in June so I can sit aside and give it a listen then.<br /><br />ACTING: In the voice department everything is on par with the previous two. The actors give the same enthusiasm to their characters as before and once again Antonio Banderas shines with Puss In Boots. Eric Idle is probably the best addition to the cast as Merlin the wizard. Idle plays Merlin after he's had a nervous breakdown, and the character steals some of the funniest moments in the film.<br /><br />BOTTON LINE: The bottom line here is that Shrek The Third is not as good as the first two, but it's still better than most animated films out there. I laughed a lot and found it to be worth my time as a summer fare. The lack of focus and structure plus the overuse of popular music didn't ruin the experience, but I do think it shows that when you change directors there is in fact a difference. Go see Shrek The Third and have a good time, it was certainly more enjoyable than Spider-Man 3 that's for sure.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL.html">A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL</a><br/><p>The worn path of `Shrek The Third' reeks of obligatory sequel and becomes 'Shrek' The Mediocre. `Shrek' 1 and 2 were charming, yet crudely funny, providing a remarkably dynamic and well-rounded entertainment. Much of the humor is lost: Crude without funny falls flat. With a noticeable diminution of charm, even the lovable characters seem worn thin this trek. Often the lines are lame insults or tired clich&eacute;s. Episodic and sometimes random, Shrek seems to have run out of gas.<br /><br />The plot is planted solidly enough. The Frog King, on his death lily pad, croaks his last, making Shrek (Myers) his heir. Shrek, the Reluctant, looks for Arthur (Timberlake) attending a land remote from "Far, Far Away" to take his place. Meanwhile, Feona (Diaz) is expecting their own family heir, providing a dream sequence about baby fluids, and a chance for another sequel. Strengthening the conflict, however, is Prince Charming (Everett), a washed up dinner theater actor for the rotten tomatoes crowd. He reaps his revenge at a rough bar of broken dreams summoning Snow White's witch and other misfits to challenge Shrek and his cohorts.<br /><br />To be fair, a new magician does have Puss N' Boots (Banderas) and Donkey (Murphy) "trading places" in one scene, but these laughs are the exception. (Indeed both characters are the core merits for this sequel, and some sight gags live up to 'Shrek' legend.)  The satire is lost with stereotypical jokes at Arthur's Worcestershire School, and the same Zen wizard waxing about "serentity circles" and "Primal (Scream) Therapy". (Lame)  Remarkable animation and past characterization only partly save this sequel.<br /><br />Otherwise, we can only hope a new `Shrek' movie will be more inspired and not based on deadlines.

Mostly, the jokes are flat and childish. Shrek movies have become known for making fun and delighting their audience with an incredible movie soundtrack, yet, the third installment attempts to be mediocre and gather the attention of little kids (presumably in hopes of staying afloat long enough to earn the big bucks). The Ogre himself has less face movements (with his jaw moving but the rest of the face remaining expressionless) and Fiona is barely in the movie to make much of an impact.<br /><br />The credits, however, are done incredibly well and are enjoyable to watch.

Shrek (Michael Myers), Donkey (Eddie Murphy), Puss-N-Boots (Antonio Banderas) and Fiona (Cameron Diaz) are once more in fine form, with plenty of laughs in store, especially from Donkey as Shrek's comedic sidekick. But this isn't nearly as funny a film as the recent "Meet the Robinsons" nor one which will play strongly with your emotions. Instead, we're treated to stale "Valley Girl" jokes and barely amusing escapades (There's one classic scene of Shrek christening a ship which comes across as a third-rate imitation of a classic Mickey Mouse short film from the 1940s.). Justin Timberlake as the young King Arthur is mildly intriguing, but Eric Idle seems badly miscast as a bumbling Merlin.

Now, I have not seen this new Shrek film as of yet, but I feel compelled to defend the third film now since, in my opinion, it was far from disappointing.<br /><br />In fact, both my wife and I concluded that this was better than the second Shrek film.<br /><br />The plot revolves around Shrek becoming heir to the throne of Far, Far Away when Fiona's father dies.  He's not really suited for the Kingly life so he sets out on a journey to find Arthur, the only other heir to the throne, and bring him back to claim his place.  There are a few problems.  Arthur (or Artie as he is better known) is a rebellious teen who isn't really suited for Kingly duties either.  You also have the bitter Prince Charming who is determined to overtake the throne, even if that means imprisoning the recently impregnated Fiona.<br /><br />Well, it's not like Fiona can't take care of herself.<br /><br />If any of the Shrek films meandered or lost steam it was the second film.  For me, `Shrek the Third' was a step in the right direction.  Sure, it isn't as fresh or exciting as the first film, but none of them have been.  BUT, this film is funny, witty and charming.  The voice performances by the entire cast (including the newbie, Timberlake) are all top notch, and the gags here are one laugh after another.<br /><br />I know it's been noted, but that whole `Puss-in-Boots swapping bodies with Donkey' scene is hilarious!<br /><br />I don't get the hate here.  It really makes very little sense to me.  The film is entertaining from start to finish and capitalizes on everything that makes these Shrek movies so fun and engaging.  I understand that people may have been expecting more, but in the end this film really does deliver a memorable good time.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EHTFVSD0H7I6.html">A1EHTFVSD0H7I6</a><br/><p>I wish Amazon had 1/2 stars. This is a 3.5 in my book.<br /><br />I hesitated to buy or even rent Shrek 3. I'd read a review when it opened that suggested it fell very short of the other two. But I found a deal I couldn't pass up, and even if it was slightly amusing I thought it might produce a few giggles. If nothing else, the infamous Puss-in-Boots big-eyed, poor kitty stare was worth the price of Shrek 2.<br /><br />Surprisingly, I found much to enjoy. A twist on the traditional Puss-in-Boots eyes brought a smile. Prince Charming's dinner theater gig gone bad was another amusing scene.<br /><br />It's creative, well-written and still amusing. It would be impossible to produce a Shrek movie without relying on some of the tried and true Shrek and company gags. Magic gone wrong with funny results, of course. Princesses with attitude, only a few minutes worth and still watchable.<br /><br />A gentler Fiona and a slightly tamer Shrek are to be expected because people do grow and change, after all - it stands then that ogres might also. Donkey as a daddy plays.<br /><br />If you are a huge Shrek fan for the subtle and not-so-subtle twisted fairy tale moments and laughed out loud at Shrek 1 and 2 - I think it's safe to say you will enjoy Shrek 3.</p></br><a href="../users/A2I6MHMAZZDCRX.html">A2I6MHMAZZDCRX</a><br/><p>Shrek (Mike Myers) and Fiona (Cameron Diaz) are still in Far Far Away.  Fiona's father, King Harold the frog (John Cleese), is dying, and the two are filling in for him at state functions.  Shrek's really trying to handle things correctly, but he always makes a mess of things.<br /><br />Unfotunately, King Harold croaks.  But before he does, he tells Shrek that Fiona isn't the only heir to the throne.  She has a distant cousin, Arthur (Justin Timberlake), who could become king.  Since Shrek wants to return to the swamp and give up life in the palace, he sets off with his faithful friends Donkey (Eddie Murphy) and Puss In Boots (Antonio Banderas) to find the heir.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Prince Charming (Rupert Everett) has been reduced to acting in bad dinner theater.  After one especially bad performance, he decides to take what he feels is rightfully his.  So he enlists the aid of every fairy tale villain he can find.  This time, they are going to get their happily ever after.  Will his plan succeed?  Can Shrek find Arthur?<br /><br />Like the first two, Shrek the Third is a funny film.  There is still plenty of the bathroom humor that was present in the first two, but the double meanings and suggestion jokes seemed to be gone.  Frankly, I was thankful for this.  Yet there was still plenty of satire for the adults to laugh at.  In fact, I think I heard more adults laughing then kids in the packed theater when I first saw it.<br /><br />All the previous main and minor characters are back, plus a plethora of new friends.  We've got King Arthur and assorted other Arthurian characters for starters.  Plus Fiona is visited by Snow White, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, and Rapunzel. And having Prince Charming team up with the other villains was brilliant.  Frankly, this is the film HAPPILY N'EVER AFTER wished it could be.  Yet the story is still fast moving with a good moral.  Yes, we're still talking about self-acceptance, but they find a fresh take on it that ties in with the first two.<br /><br />A word of warning about the death scene.  It is long and drawn out.  While played for laughs (and it is pretty funny), it might be too much for some kids.  Granted, it is a frog, but it also is Fiona's father.  Every child is different, so you know best how your will react.  But consider that before they watch.<br /><br />I've spent most of the review praising the film.  I really did enjoy it.  But I did feel it wasn't as funny as the first two.  While there were still plenty of laughs and satire, some of the bite was gone.  It's good, but it doesn't live up to the other two.  And, with all the characters, some got short changed.  For example, Julie Andrew's queen has plenty of screen time, but she hardly has any lines.<br /><br />In the end, this is another fun animated comedy that the entire family will enjoy.</p></br><a href="../users/A3JLOIXFM75QNV.html">A3JLOIXFM75QNV</a><br/><p>Shrek 3 was pretty decent, but at times it was also pretty stupid. I LOVED the second one and had high hopes for this one. There were a few mildly funny bits but overall, I would say it was just OK. I would probably watch it again if it was ever on TV, I dont know about purchacing it though...</p></br><a href="../users/AZCDCO6KK2T81.html">AZCDCO6KK2T81</a><br/><p>Shrek suffers from the #3 curse in the way Superman, Batman, Lethal Weapon, and Jaws sequels did in that it gets tiresome.  With the exception of a rare few like Jurassic Park III, The Godfather III, Spider-Man 3, and most likely Pirates 3, it's hard to be original on the third go-around and even harder to sustain our interest.  It may be of some fun, and Shrek 3 is to some degree; however, it has lost much of its charm and often feels strained and contrived.  The first 30 minutes of Shrek the Third is sensationally funny as we see a series of bloopers with him trying to do kingly duties; however, the story is substantially slower in the last two thirds and often unfunny.<br /><br />I had my opinion, but I wanted to know what my kids, ages 10 and 14, to whom this film is mostly aimed at thought of this film without any bias from me and my son said, "It was alright, but seemed to drop dead after the first half," and my daughter said, "It was okay, but not nearly as good as the first two.  The second will stay my favorite."<br /><br />I couldn't agree more with my kids.  I'll rest my case there.</p></br><a href="../users/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD.html">A3PPXVR5J6U2JD</a><br/><p>Shrek, like Harry Potter, is one of those entertainment vehicles that transcended the gap between target marketing groups.  Harry Potter is appealing to both kids and adults, making it a huge hit.  It's a difficult balancing act that is threatened by its own popularity...it's very possible for a name or product to be a victim of its own success, thereby turning off future readers/viewers.<br /><br />Shrek's hit that point with Shrek the Third.<br /><br />For kids, Shrek was fun to watch.  The characters are either cuddly or blubbery, but never really mean (even the dragon's kind of cute).  Shrek himself, supposedly a horrible ogre, looks like a green pile of Playdoh.  He's not all that threatening, and he's not supposed to be.  And since Shrek is gross, he's got a certain prepubescent boy appeal.<br /><br />For adults, Shrek was packed with twists on old fairytales, winking nods to familiar voice actors in unfamiliar roles (I'm apparently the only one who got some of the Eddie Murphy jokes in the second Shrek film), and plenty of riffs on movies.  Keeping a film amusing for the little ones without aggravating adults, or amusing for the adults without boring the kids, is high art.  The path is littered with the corpses of movies who couldn't balance it well (see Chicken Little).<br /><br />By the time we reach Shrek the Third, the producers had to figure out which he wanted to do: make a movie that's filled with more riffs on fairytales, or actually treat Shrek as a real personality who grows and develops.  Shrek 2 managed this amazing feat by shifting locales: Shrek went to the equivalent of Hollywood, fertile ground for humorous allegories and wisecracks.  He was also getting to know his in-laws, and certainly all the adults in the audience could appreciate the hilarity that inevitably ensued as two very different groups of people tired to get along.<br /><br />So Shrek the Third tackles next logical step of having a baby.<br /><br />The lovable cast of ridiculous misfit fairytale characters is barely in evidence.  Taking up the task of mocking fairytale tropes are fairytale villains.  Sort of.  We've got the Evil Queen from Snow White, Hook from Peter Pan, some dwarves, the Headless Horseman, and a lot of evil trees.  I don't know about you, but I don't think of evil trees when I think of fairytale villains. And oh yeah, for some reason one of the bad guys is a cyclops.  Can't forget the cyclopes. They couldn't come up with more recognizable fairytale villains?  THIS is the most hilarious it gets?<br /><br />In the middle of this villainous rebellion, led by Prince Charming, Shrek goes off on a quest to find an heir to the king. The heir's a punk named Arthur (as in, King).  Only he lives in a fairytale version of high school.  Which would be really funny, if Shrek actually stayed there.  High school jokes were a potential for comedy goldmine, like the Hollywood jokes.  But alas, it's not to be.  Shrek leaves, with Donkey and Puss in tow.<br /><br />Speaking of which, Donkey is now utterly extraneous.  Puss is hilarious and entertaining, Donkey is barely relevant.  With so many characters, it's getting crowded in the Shrekiverse.  And me being a cat owner has nothing to do with my bias towards Puss, I'm sure.<br /><br />The movie wraps up with a Grrl Power counterattack, and finally we see the Shrek we came to see.  Watching all the fairy princesses gather together to use their unique powers to finally save themselves is great.  The Snow White scene made the audience laugh.  But the rest of the princesses are barely used, and we're once again back to Adultsville.<br /><br />In the end, we get a nice little sermon about everyone getting along, about how we shouldn't marginalize people by making them out to be villains, and about Shrek accepting that he's finally going to be a dad.  Ironically, my wife is six months pregnant, so this movie was a lot more relevant to me than I expected.  Worries about being a good father?  Check. Concerned that the kids will be too much to handle?  Check.  Not sure how domestic life will become part of your own manly personality?  Check.  Man, Shrek really was hilarious...I was laughing out loud at several parts!<br /><br />Then I noticed I was the only one.<br /><br />You see, there weren't that many dads in the audience.  It was stuffed to the rafters with mothers and their children though.  And those kids were squirming through much of the movie, because...because dad jokes are funny to dads and dads-to-be.<br /><br />The movie ends with Shrek asking Fiona.  "The kids are in bed...what do you want to do now?" That's a decidedly adult joke, but don't worry...they end up falling asleep instead.<br /><br />Yep. Shrek seems a bit tired.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R8PXSFGY9MC2.html">A3R8PXSFGY9MC2</a><br/><p>`Shrek the Third' is a rather lack lustre addition to the Shrek series of films and whilst perfectly enjoyable, it seems to be missing a key element.<br /><br />This follows Shrek, Donkey and Puss in Boots as they go to collect Finoa's cousin, Arthur, to install him as King after Fiona's father dies and Shrek doesn't want to become King or have the responsibility of the kingdom.  There is also the side story of Fiona's pregnancy and Shrek's hesitancy in ruling the kingdom is mirrored in his hesitancy in becoming a father.<br /><br />The characters are still voiced by the star cast we have come to love, as well as the addition of Justin Timberlake as Arthur.  The animation is also very good, as we have come to expect, and whilst other animated films have caught up to Shrek in their quality, this film still manages to do it very well indeed.<br /><br />The fairy tale `in jokes' are also prevalent and whilst they still raise a smile, they have mostly been exhausted and can't make you laugh throughout like the first two films did.  In fact this may be the key element that I mentioned is missing, originality.  This has all the components of a good animated film, but lacks any originality.<br /><br />All in all this is a perfectly enjoyable, animated film and should please fans of the previous films.  Just don't expect the style or verve of the first two films and you won't be disappointed.  Good but not great.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></br><a href="../users/A5WMBIOGE8Q6N.html">A5WMBIOGE8Q6N</a><br/><p>Rumpelstiltskin, evil contract has changed reality for Shrek.

Grossing nearly $800,000,000 at the boxoffice, "Shek 3", like the first two films, was a certified hit. Featuring the voices of Mike Myeres, Cameron Diaz, Justin Timberlake, Eddie Murphy, and Antonio Banderas, the story continues to tell the tale of a giant orgre, his knowledge that he is going to be a dad, and the fact that he and his wife are next in line to become Queen and King of a place called Far Far Away.<br /> The DVD includes lost scenes, games and activities, and more.</p></br><a href="../users/A11ED8O95W2103.html">A11ED8O95W2103</a><br/><p>But even a "bad" Shrek movie is more fun than most movies.<br /><br />That said, why didn't it work like the first two?<br /><br />1.  Uncompelling story that missed a huge opportunity for new satire.  Rather than rehash Prince Charming and have him storm the city of Far Far Away and then have Shrek's people storm it again (I think that castle's been stormed three times in two movies!), how about making the movie a spoof of the whole King Arthur mythology?  That would have been fun.  And what's funny and sad is that when I watched the storyboarded "deleted scenes" in the special features, they were more funny than most of the stuff in the movie!!<br /><br />2.  Too dark and violent for too long.  A lot of the movie just wasn't fun at all.<br /><br />3.  Crass use of popular music sound bytes.  One of the fun things about Shrek movies is the use of popular music tunes, and they were used very effectively in the first two movies.  But why did I have to hear "Live and Let Die" for a frog's funeral?  Or Heart's "Barracuda" when the gals storm the castle?  These loud heavy handed old rock tunes just switch in and out of the movie like someone is back there flipping the "time for the popular" tune switch, no matter if it really helps the story or not.<br /><br />4.  Really really lame DVD menus.  I kept watching the DVD main menu screen waiting for something fun to happen, and it never did!<br /><br />5.  And, you know something went wrong when there's no commentary track on the DVD.  At least I couldn't find one.<br /><br />So, aside from the sheer escapism of Shrek, and a few good gags, like Gingy's life flashback, this was like someone just took leftover Shrek stuff out of the back of the fridge and cooked something up.  Twenty million hours of render time does not a satisfying story make!</p></br><a href="../users/APOGXH3A74CM3.html">APOGXH3A74CM3</a><br/><p>This film was entertaining, but didn't cover any new ground.

Third movie's were big this year and each one of them got their share of bad reviews. I don't know why? Maybe the Hype? Or third time being a charm.....NOT! or expectations running too high making it impossible to meet them. I think that must be it. I thought this Shrek was very entertaining but, maybe a little simpler in story. It is a worthy installment and the animation is simply beautiful! Lots of fun with adult references/buff jokes throughout like all the Shrek films. Can anyone name one third installment movie that was better than the first two films in a series?.......No? .....exactly. I don't think it has ever been done. By the time you get to a third installment it's hard to keep it really fresh because we have "been there done that". This film is very good and I recommend buying it. The DVD transfer is excellent and the extras are interesting.</p></br><a href="../users/AY12DBB0U420B.html">AY12DBB0U420B</a><br/><p>I rather enjoyed the original Shrek movie. It was different, and in an amusing way. The animation was excellent and the movie was somehow appealing. Shrek 2 was OK., but I didn't get the same enjoyment as with the first. I guess that's the usual case with sequels. I felt a little burned out on the whole idea. Lately, my fianc&eacute;e, who liked the Shrek movies better than I did, picked up the Shrek the Third DVD when we last visited the local warehouse club. We watched it a couple evenings later. I was feeling negative toward viewing another Shreck thing and that may have tainted the experience.<br /><br />Shrek the Third is well done. It's a polished piece of work. The animation is terrific. In  places, the film seems so realistic I have difficulty believing it's an animation. If this is the first Shrek movie someone has viewed, I think they would probably find it interesting and amusing. However, this is the third one for me and it just doesn't have much to offer beyond the first two. The word "stale" comes to mind. The movie has some funny sight gags and there's a few mild chuckles here and there. The story is light and frivolous. My main reaction on watching was mild boredom and I began to wonder when it would be over.<br /><br />I'd say that Shrek the Third is stale and uninteresting. That about sums it up. If you haven't seen a Shrek movie you might enjoy it, although I'd suggest the original or even the second. Kids might enjoy it. For the rest, I'd suggest that there's better films available.<br /><br />Gary Peterson</p></br><a href="../users/A29QA79VLQGHY6.html">A29QA79VLQGHY6</a><br/><p>DreamWords' video unit always treated "Shrek" like royalty.

Introducing a slew of new twists on classic storybook characters, and a multitude of priceless pop culture references, this film proves that the third time's a charm. Unbelievably realistic animation, running gags and spoofs of popular movies along with a brilliantly upbeat soundtrack ensure this crowd-pleaser will delight the whole family. And the Gingerbread Man never gets old.<br /><br />Shrek and Princess Fiona are planning to go back to the comforts of their swamp when all of a sudden the frog King (John Cleese) croaks. Forced to either assume the throne or track down the last remaining heir, a boy named Arthur, Shrek, Donkey and Puss in Boots embark on a mission to locate the young hopeful. Meanwhile the unscrupulous Prince Charming amasses a group of dastardly storybook villains to take over the land of Far Far Away. Fiona must gather her princess friends including Snow White, Cinderella, and Sleeping Beauty to save their overthrown kingdom. Will Shrek bring back the next heir? Will Fiona rescue her people? Will there be a Shrek 4?<br /><br />For the third installment of the Shrek franchise, the distinctive characters really drive the plot. Almost a direct sequel to Shrek 2, the story picks up shortly after, employs most of the same personae, and revolves around a comparable plotline and the same villain, Prince Charming. Despite the story's familiarity, the grand assortment of characters is still entertaining to watch. Puss in Boots returns, and although he mainly reuses his best gags, including the wide-eyed begging glare, Antonio Banderas and the ingenious script ensure that he steals every scene he's in. Donkey is his usual annoying self, although here he's been toned down since the second film. And of course the Gingerbread Man is back, who is so risible that he deserves his own spin-off so we can enjoy his undoubtedly psychedelic solo adventures.<br /><br />Movie references and pop culture are a huge part to the Shrek franchise. "The Third" features spoofs of Rosemary's Baby, an unbelievably witty nightmare sequence, and homage to buster Keaton's collapsing wall stunt in which he remains standing through an open window. Dozens of one-liner jokes and running gags emphasize pop-culture and famous clich&eacute;s. At times it seems as if quirky quips comprise the entirety of the film and that if all the non-related jokes were removed, a movie might not exist beneath it. Certainly more interesting here and now, where a lot of the references are influential and relevant, the Shrek films will always be good family fun; their magic, however, might fade with the popularity of the subjects they mimic.<br /><br />Technically and visually, the Shrek films continually advance. Amazing, eye-popping graphics grace the screen, with ultra-realistic textures, shading and environments, as well as fluid humanlike movements and nearly flawless animation. Hilarious character designs come to vivid life with the stunning combination of aesthetic mediums and devices. Once again an upbeat and popular soundtrack garnishes the production and hilariously placed full-scale song-and-dance sequences enhance nearly every scene.<br /><br />Shrek 4 is already in the works, and while we certainly don't need it, if Dreamworks Animation keeps up the same fast-paced blend of humor, adventure and role-model-morals, it can't do us any harm. Shrek the Third perfectly matches its predecessors and, while equally as preachy, the entertainment value always remains high.<br /><br />- Mike Massie, MoviePulse.net</p></br><a href="../users/A2RDR5G65D9H84.html">A2RDR5G65D9H84</a><br/><p>I think it is time to stop now. The quality of this series has been slowly sliding, and even though this movie is OK, I am at a point at which I would not recommend it. There are still some sparks of clever humor and an efficient use of satire at certain times, but there are portions of the film that come close to putting the audience to sleep. Overall, I would have to say that this production shows an uneven quality throughout its duration, and that it is reaching that point commonly known for series as jump-the-shark.<br /><br />This time around, the story deals with filling the position of king of Far Far Away. The Frog King, while in his deathbed, asks Shrek to do this, together with Fiona, but the ogre could not be less interested. Thus, he goes on a quest to find Arthur, Fiona's cousin, to take the hot seat. Meanwhile, Prince Charming is plotting, together with every villain that ever existed in a fairy tale, to overthrow the current government and take possession of the throne. Ohh! I almost forgot; there is the small issue of the pregnancy!<br /><br />As mentioned before, there are some segments in which the satiric elements make us laugh and keep us entertained, especially when Shrek visits Arthur's high school. The music is also pretty good, as has been characteristic of the series, but it is definitely not at the level of the first movie. However, these features are not enough to make this film one to be recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>I know a lot of people were disappointed with this film, but it really isn't a bad picture, I just think that it pales when compared to the first two.  The idea is interesting enough one--the frog king dies leaving Shrek next in line to be king unless he can find a distant cousin to the king named Arthur.  The Arthurian myths are only barely touched despite the presence of Arthur and Merlin.  I think they dropped the ball with that one.  I laughed at a few scenes with the Gingerbread Man, but overall this one lacked the charm of the other films.  Maybe the characters are getting stale, or maybe the writing wasn't up to snuff.  I will probably buy this one to go with the first two, but on its' own it is a toss up.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R1HAXRNU0QX7.html">A2R1HAXRNU0QX7</a><br/><p>After the brilliance of the first two films, the third is just disappointing.

Even the idea for the plot...with Shrek running off to find young Arthur to fill the throne he himself doesn't want...is a decent skeleton.<br /><br />But the movie just isn't as funny!  There were some fairly long stretches where is realized, "Hey, I haven't laughed in quite a long time."  There are lots of chuckles of amused familiarity...it's always fun to see Puss in Boots do his big, sad-eyed bit.  The supporting roles of Gingerbread Man, Pinocchio, the pigs, etc. are fun.  But the film doesn't surprise or delight.  The first was so great because we'd never seen a film like it and the characters were so fresh and fun.  #2 simply stepped up the hilarity quotient (and added the brilliantly hilarious Antonio Banderas).  But #3 just misses.  At one point, Puss and Donkey exchange bodies.  Haven't we seen similar ideas before?  Didn't Donkey become a Stallion?<br /><br />Also, some of the jokes just weren't funny.  Playing "Live and Let Die" at the Frog King's funeral was weird...not funny.  The climactic battle between Charming and his gang vs. Shrek and his friends was not exciting, not funny and not visually interesting.  VERY anticlimatic.<br /><br />For me, the best scenes took place at Arthur's high-school...a very Hogwarts sort of establishment.  It poked fun at the Harry Potter stories, at "teen-clique" movies like MEAN GIRLS and at the Arthurian legend.<br /><br />But for a movie that took 3 years to make...it felt a little lazy.  I'll keep going to SHREK films for now...but I hope 4 picks it up again!!!</p></br><a href="../users/ATXL536YX71TR.html">ATXL536YX71TR</a><br/><p>Short and sweet here:the adventure was good, the comedy was dreadful.What Made SHREK 1 and 2 better was clever dialogue. That IS NOT here in SHREK THE THIRD. The comedy and script now seem cheap and lame.As an adult with no kids,IMO, this was the worst SHREK yet. I waited until I could see this at a "second run" cinema for $3. I am glad that was all I spent.Kids may like this one, but as an adult....ZILCH! If there is a SHREK 4, the writers better get on the stick!</p></br><a href="../users/A1GHUN5HXMHZ89.html">A1GHUN5HXMHZ89</a><br/><p>Although by the third movie most sequels are finding it hard to keep the magic. Shrek is no different. Amusing story, good animation, and another round of the characters we enjoy. This time Prince Charming is looking for payback and enlists the bad guys and gals from all the fairytales to help him. While Shrek is off looking for Arthur "Arty" Penndragon to take over a kings crown he doesn't want, the castle is invaded by Charming. All the fairytale ladies have to break out of the tower and give a nice fight sequence, but are recaptured. Shrek returns and with the help of Arty, saves the day. My only complaint is they put way to much time into sophomoric characterizations in the extras about the kids at Arty's high school where Shrek found him. A little is nice, but it went way beyond little. Nonetheless it is a nice addition to the other two movies. Great DVD quality and enough extras to make you sick of them.</p></br><a href="../users/A38QEATH3NODFM.html">A38QEATH3NODFM</a><br/><p>I enjoyed Shrek 2, Shrek was good, but now the third is just an extension on the franchise.  I think this one should be it.  Mostly adult like humor, toned down a notch from the second movie.  Just not suprising. Credit on the story line though, nice to draw on the king arthur story.  Worth it to buy for the collection, but not a must have.</p></br><a href="../users/A1U360OMVQRPUB.html">A1U360OMVQRPUB</a><br/><p>SHREK THE THIRD offers some interesting crossroads for our favorite green ogre (Michael Myers). With Fiona's (Cameron Diaz) frog father on his deathbed, Shrek has had to serve as king of Far Far Away in the interim.  And uneasy lies the crown.  We have some knee-slapping good times watching Shrek to his level-best to be the king to the people, but even an ogre with a good heart just isn't cut out to be the king.  He messes up nearly everything he dies, and he stinks at being the king.  Shrek is the first to admit this.<br /><br />Thankfully, Eddie Murphy is back as Donkey and Antonio Banderas returns as Puss In Boots. The movie just wouldn't have been the same without them. Their constant bickering and commentary helped move that plot and the characters along quickly. Plus they got some of the funniest lines in the movie.<br /><br />Prince Charming returns as the villain in this one. The opener showing him working dinner theater in a low level pub is just hilarious. The effort so fits the character, and so does all the grief he takes at the hands of the audience. Of course, he's trying to exorcize his demons by starring in a play where he triumphs over Shrek, which is what he thinks he should have done in the first place.<br /><br />Then, and I'm going to use a line here that was painfully obvious in the movie that was never used, Fiona's father croaks (he's a frog, remember?). But before he does, actually after several false alarms, he tells Shrek that there is one other heir to the kingdom of Far Far Away: a young boy named Arthur.<br /><br />Shrek resolves to go find Arthur and crown the boy king. All Shrek wants to do, all Shrek ever wants to do, is get back to his beloved swamp and get on with sharing his life with Fiona. But when he boards the ship to begin his voyage, Fiona tells him she is pregnant. It's all too much for Shrek. The nightmare he has about having ogre children is absolutely side-splitting. Not only that, but the movie double dips on the whole nightmare premise and caught me flat-footed on one of the quick twists.<br /><br />In the meantime, back in the heart of villainy, Prince Charming retreats to a pub where all the evil characters in the fairy tales hang out and begrudge their existence. The scene where Charming rallies the troops really works. I was ready to vote for him myself.<br /><br />After that, we're treated to a series of eye-popping adventures as Shrek goes back to high school to get Artie, which is how Arthur is known among his peers. Shrek also discovers that Arthur is the much-maligned prey of the school bullies and butt of all practical jokes. No one likes him.<br /><br />With nothing there to stay for, Arthur decides to join Shrek and go back to be the king. Along the way Shrek ends up playing the father role to Arthur, which could have been predicted but still played well.<br /><br />With the end of the movie in sight, everything is up for grabs. The visual comedy in the combat scenes is amazing. The twists and turns the plot makes as it follows a much-trod path are brilliant. It's the little things in the Shrek films that add up to big laughs.  Like the pay-for-play window Pinocchio dances in while Shrek is trying to get information about the location of Fiona. Like Arthur throwing himself on the ground and crying his eyes out to get Merlin to help them get home. Like Donkey, while possessed by Puss In Boots, when he tries to make all his fur stand on end like a cat. Like Donkey's kids when they spelled out the smoke message that tells him they love him.<br /><br />One of the best things to come out of left field, and there were several, was Fiona's speech to the princesses of Far Far Away to rally them into a combat force. Sleeping Beauty's attack on the tree guards at the gate to the city is simply amazing, and I found myself lifting my jaw off the floor and laughing out loud. Music is so much a part of the Shrek movies, and there's plenty of it on the soundtrack.<br /><br />I always go see the Shrek movies on the big screen, and I have a hard time waiting for the DVD release so I can watch them again. Despite my attention to the screen, there's always something I miss. Plus so many of the laughs can be enjoyed over and over. Like the Gingerbread Man's Six Million Dollar Man run through the fields. I can't wait for the DVD, and I can't wait to see if there will be - hopefully - a SHREK 4.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B3Z2QHW3V35S.html">A2B3Z2QHW3V35S</a><br/><p>I love all of the Shrek movies. Shrek The Third is just as funny as the first two Shrek's. I haven't seen the last Shrek movie. I'm looking forward to watching it.</p></br></body></html>

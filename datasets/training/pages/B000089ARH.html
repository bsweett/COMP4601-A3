That this idea has merit is substantiated by this remarkable period piece both written and directed by Cameron Crowe. As he did in his quite captivating original screenplay for "Fast Times At Ridgemont High", he mines his personal background with an uncanny ear for realistic situations, dialogue, and personal experience to pull us deep into the quirky and sometimes surrealistic world of sixties rock<p>The protagonist of the film is a teen-something reporter for Rolling Stone magazine, and like Crowe, has an eyes-wide-open view of everything swirling around him, from sex, drugs and rock and roll to all the happenings associated with the rock and roll lifestyle itself. One finds William (newcomer Patrick Fugit) sucked into the vortex of a fictitious rock band's pulsating experience, and the moment to moment happenings surrounding Stillwater are so realistic, believable, and palpable that we roll along with it all, finding too much to remember from what we recall of the sixties. Also excellent are the ensemble of supposed Stillwater rock musicians, from Billy Crudup to Jason Lee, and the very lovely Kate Hudson showing her future potential as a leading lady in a powerful and convincing role here. <p>This is the closest any of us are likely to come to living vicariously in a rock and roll band. The fact is that Cameron Crowe actually did experience a lot of what goes down here himself as a sixteen year old reporter, and the verve and energy in the film owes to this authentic recollection of those times, and to his uncanny ear for all the elements of the rock scene. This is a terrific movie, and although it is fiction, is also quite representative of the times it purports to describe. Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A152C8GYY25HAH.html">A152C8GYY25HAH</a><br/><p>Sometimes a film comes along, and it enchants and excites you. It makes you believe in movie magic again. This may happen infrequently, but when it does, it reminds you of what made you fall in love with the movies to begin with. Of course, even the best movie triggers these feelings in only part of its audience. For me, Almost Famous is one of those pictures. Since the print media and the visual media are so different, I doubt this review can tell you if the film has the same in store for you. <p>Writer and director Cameron Crowe has had a charmed life, and he knows it, as can be seen in this partly autobiographical and partly fictionalized tale. When he was just fifteen years old, he got the first of several writing assignment from Rolling Stone magazine. Almost Famous is the story of a kid on the road with a rock and roll band in the early 1970s.<p>Young William Miller [Patrick Fugit] has come to the attention of Rolling Stone because of some articles he wrote for Creem magazine. The assignment comes via telephone, and the editors are unaware that they are hiring a teenager. William doesn't have much luck hooking up the band Stillwater until he gets a little help from a groupie called Penny Lane [Kate Hudson]. Penny is in love with Stillwater's lead guitarist, Russell [Billy Crudup]. Since he has a girlfriend back in New York, she tries to pretend she's just a friend, but everyone sees right through her. William's mother, Elaine [Frances McDormand], who has already alienated her daughter, Anita [Zooey Deschanel], is reluctant to let William go. She gives in when he promises to be back in time for high school graduation and swears he won't do drugs. He keeps his word on the drugs, but the tour and the group mesmerize the kid. He winds up on the road with them for weeks. It is, to say the least, an interesting trip. <p>This is perhaps the best coming of age movie I have ever seen. It ranks arguably at the top of movies about rock and roll, and it certainly feels like the most authentic. The songs performed by Stillwater were written for the movie by Crowe and others, and they fit in seamlessly with the vintage rock and roll tunes played throughout the film. The look and the feel of the 70s is captured perfectly. It was a very different time for music. It was a period when talent and idealism ruled the scene. It would not be long until all pop music was all confiscated by vast corporations. You see the beginnings of this process in the movie when a creep from the record company comes in to replace the band's long time manager and friend. <p>The acting is all world-class. Francis McDormand and Kate Hudson were deservedly nominated for Academy awards, but the whole cast is uniformly excellent. <p>This movie has a lot of drama in it, but it also has a lot of laughs. It remains upbeat more often than not. It has heart, something that is lacking in many films, but it is never sappy or sentimental. it touches you without making you feel manipulated. It is, I suspect, the best movie of last year. <p>Rated R for language, drug content and brief nudity. [I disagree with the MPAA on this one. I think Almost Famous is perfect for teens. Did they expect it to be historically inaccurate just because what was cool then isn't cool now?}</p></br><a href="../users/A2FEJIORC1MBG3.html">A2FEJIORC1MBG3</a><br/><p>Cameron Crowe's rock 'n' roll loveletter to 70's excess hits all the right notes. The hipper-than-thou &quot;one-star&quot; contrarians and spiteful naysayers are just insanely jealous of the director's incredibly charmed life (I mean, c'mon...writer for Rolling Stone at 15, several acclaimed films by his early 40's, by all accounts an amiable, down-to-earth guy, married to Rock Babe Extraordinaire Nancy Wilson...he's living every American male's Peter Pan fantasy-I say more power to 'im!). &quot;Almost Famous&quot; joins &quot;Dazed And Confused&quot; as another &quot;American Graffitti&quot; for those of us who reached young adulthood in the mid-70's (but hated Disco!). Crowe coaxes great performances from his ensemble, with standout turns from Billy &quot;Golden God&quot; Cruddup, Frances McDormand and the amazing Phillip Seymour Hoffman (who edges closer to becoming a national treasure with each successive role he tackles). In short, if you know what &quot;Dark Side Of The Moon&quot; sounds like with clicks, pops and turntable rumble...then you'll understand exactly what this film is about!</p></br><a href="../users/AUM3YMZ0YRJE0.html">AUM3YMZ0YRJE0</a><br/><p>For a long time, I thought that this was another one of those silly romantic comedies - afterall, that was the section it was in.  I thought, why bother with another coming of age movie that will end up stupidly happy, with the wrong lessons, and puerily unrealistic.<br /><br />Boy was I wrong on that one!!  This is a wonderful, sensitive film that develops a number of themes:  finding a mentor, making your first foray into the world, discovering what (relative) failures most of us are as people, and of course, the decline of rock in the 1970s.  Not only was the psychology of the characters subtle and realistic, but the evocation of the time - when the 60s idealism gave way to crass commercialism and, well, genuine mediocrity - is vivid and accurate.<br /><br />I am almost the exact same age as the protagonist, so I identified with him on many levels:  rebelling against a parent he loved to go his own way, accomplishing something original by getting inside with his own talent and gall, and seeing the people behind the idols of cool.  It is amazingly successful at all this, and for kids there is a lot to learn from it.  Heck, even I re-wrote my life somewhat while enjoying this adventure of youth!  It is lovely, sad, and uplifting.<br /><br />Warmly recommended.  This is a great director.</p></br><a href="../users/A3081Z4P774YR4.html">A3081Z4P774YR4</a><br/><p>Seeing as how I liked &quot;Almost Famous&quot; when it was in theaters, the idea of a longer version was at the very least a concern.  While I was sure it would add more to the experience in general, I did in fact fear that it would have material that would have been better off on the cutting room floor.  Luckily, this &quot;Untitled&quot; version was great, and improved on an already good movie.  The commentary with writer/director Cameron Crowe and others (including his own mother, no less) is worth a listen, if only to hear some of the details Crowe gives into the making of this film and stories from his experiences on the road in the 70's.  While the extras are sparse, this is of little consequence to my viewing experience.  The skeleton of this DVD set (the bootleg and theatrical version) is more than enough to keep me satisfied.</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>Recut and re-released films should be treated the same as remakes--one has to ask why it should be redone. Any number of films have benefited from this type of &quot;remake&quot;. Just as many, though, have had little added. In effect being able to go back and re-edit a film as allowed artistic second guessing. Sometimes it's to the disadvantage of a classic.<p>Crowe's &quot;bootleg&quot; version of Almost Famous (released under it's original title &quot;Untitled&quot;) kind of falls between these two camps as nothing essential is really added back to the film. A pity this wasn't released like this previously as the running commentary between Crowe and his Mom is actually interesting.<p>Still, kudos to Crowe (and the marketing folks at Dreamworks)for the way this package is put together. The CD of unreleased songs and having both versions of the film make this an interesting boxed set. A pity that Apocalypse Now Redux wasn't released in this format (there's a good example of a film that would benefit this type of packaging. It would have allowed the inclusion of the original film, the re-edited version --in the slightly different aspect ratio--along with the stunning documentary Hearts of Darkness by Coppola's wife).<p>SInce music is so essential to all of Crowe's films I can't help but wonder what he will do as a film director/writer once he finishes mining the past. What happens when he hits his midlife crisis? Who know what artistic explorations might be in store...</p></br><a href="../users/A1IANEBSMVGHS9.html">A1IANEBSMVGHS9</a><br/><p>When the music was extremely creative; when love, peace and Rock 'n Roll were the motto... Do I sound too nostalgic? Maybe because this movie and its music makes you feel that way. <p> Take 'America', Simon &amp; Garfunkel's super-hit, for example. My wife and I decided to get married while listening to this song. And so it goes. Elton John's 'Tiny Dancer' - extremely beautiful moment in the movie. <p> It makes me remember the fact that music seems to be there for a reason, and it is to tie sounds to your memories, to times during your life, and that is priceless. <p> Definitely worth seeing, owning, and listening to also.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>To be completely honest, when I first saw this film about five years ago I was under-whelmed.  It had been hyped up and won all sorts of awards and received so much attention, and really I didn't see why.  I was disappointed to say the least.  Then last night I decided to give it another shot.  Removing myself completely from the hype and praise and just amercing myself into the film was a huge plus for me, and I walked away from the experience singing it's praises like a church choir.  The film moved me in ways I didn't remember the first time; its rich sense of honesty ringing through with every frame.  The script is so real and raw, which I attest to the fact that director Cameron Crowe wrote this as a semi-autobiographic tale, and that first hand insight really gives `Almost Famous' an edge as possible his best film to date (and that's saying a lot since he has always been a genuinely talented director).<br /><br />`Almost Famous' tells the story of William Miller (a fictional representation of Cameron Crowe), a young kid sheltered by his mothers iron fist, the same fist that drove away his older sister Anita.  At fifteen Miller gets the chance of a lifetime, to follow around the rockband Stillwater and write an article for Rolling Stone about the band on the road.  What he finds within their world is something starkly contrasts to anything he imagined.  It is a world that entices and appeals to him, but at the same time it's a world that conflicts with his inner person, especially as he watches the fame tear the band apart and take out innocent bystanders in the wake.  Stillwater is still trying to find its sea-legs so-to-speak and the process proceeds to shake up the members and all those in their company.<br /><br />The performances by most the entire cast is strong and lends much support to Crowe's vision.  Billy Crudup and Jason Lee are effective as the feuding band leaders.  Crudup plays Russell Hammond, the lead guitarist filled with mystery, the one that everyone wants to be with.  Crudup does a good job of filtering through his characters inner contempt for the corruption within his profession.  When he's speaking with William's mother in the phone you can read in his voice his disgust with the whole `fame and fortune' aspect of his life.  Jason Lee is slightly less effective as Jeff Bebe, the jealous lead singer of Stillwater.  I didn't think he could completely sell his character.  I've never been impressed with Lee to tell the truth, and while his performance is not `terrible' it is merely passable here.  He tends to try and oversell things, and it got on my nerves a tad.  Patrick Fugit still seems a little green to me (but then again, when this was made he was green, right?) but he has a feeling of honesty in his performance that works well for what Crowe was attempting.  Fugit comes off uncomfortable with his performance, which I think aids in creating the vibe that he is a real fifteen-year-old kid who, lets face it, is pretty uncomfortable with himself.<br /><br />The three standouts here though are McDormand, Hoffman and especially Hudson, all of whom raise the bar for the rest of the actors in the film.  Philip Seymour Hoffman is rarely seen moving around, but his grasp of his characters idealisms has a strong influence on the film.  Frances McDormand really gets under her characters skin (that of William's overbearing mother Elaine) and draws out such unrestrained emotion that you can't help but feel for her in every scene, even the ones she doesn't embody.  For every scene she is not though, there is Kate Hudson, who is so effervescent as Penny Lane I can't help but adore her.  Her innocent devotion to a machine that just wants to use her, a machine that doesn't care enough about her to deserve her unwavering adoration is just so raw and believable and sympathetically captivating I just can't help but fall in love with her.<br /><br />Truth be told though, this film is all about Cameron Crowe.  His stamp of reality is felt on every frame.  The audience is allowed to become completely absorbed into the world in which he himself was found at such a young age (at eighteen Crowe wrote for Rolling Stone Magazine, and this film is based on his `adventures' so-to-speak).  His direction is flawless, but even more amazing is the script, which bleeds on every page the smell of honesty.  It may not be my favorite script of the year (`You Can Count on Me' remains one of my favorite screenplays ever written) but it is certainly one of them.<br /><br />`Almost Famous' truly has that extra something (not to mention the amazing soundtrack), that honesty that makes it worth every second of your time.  Cameron Crowe really put himself completely into this picture, and the finished product is something he can truly be proud of, and something we can all praise him unflinchingly for.</p></br><a href="../users/A10X0JN8KTK89H.html">A10X0JN8KTK89H</a><br/><p>I truly enjoyed this film, over-enjoyed it in fact.  There are far too many wonderful scenes, great joints of dialogue, and an overflow of brooding young men and women.  I felt like I had no character on which to focus my sympathy.  I wanted to focus on the perspective of the young writer, William Miller (played expertly by Patrick Fugit), but the film wouldn't let me.  I wanted to envision Russell Hammond (played genuinely by Billy Crudup), but I couldn't decide if he was a rock star, a little boy trapped in a man's body, or a surrogate father to William.  I didn't understand Kate Hudson's Oscar nomination, but I understood Frances McDormand's.  And why the hell Philip Seymour Hoffman wasn't nominated, I'll never understand.  Something was going on in this movie that confused me.<br /><br />I think the greatest flaw in this movie - the theatrical version, at least - is that there are simply too many great performances and too many fascinating characters for the film to center itself.  I'm positive that the director's cut is the version to see.  The theater cut was pieced together with an air of sadness in order to meet a marketable time limit.  I felt like I was missing a lot of back-story, supporting roles, and important moments.  If you have never seen this movie, avoid the theatrical version.  It is severely dismembered, and it's clear that the director (Cameron Crowe) had more to show the viewer.  The director's cut is over forty minutes longer, and I look forward to seeing it.<br /><br />I probably should at least attempt to place this movie.  The film covers the 1973-74 tours of the band Stillwater.  There were an actual band back then, but the majority of their representation is fabricated for the sake of the movie.  Most of the music in the film is representative of the time period and not so much from the band.  Thus, this is not a true biopic, but an imagined biopic, a movie about a band that was, as the title states, almost famous.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EBLL2OYEQJN9.html">A2EBLL2OYEQJN9</a><br/><p>Cameron Crowe's fictionalized account of his young days as a rock writer is a beautiful tale and a trip down memory lane.  So many roles in here are award-worthy-Patrick Fugit as the young rock writer, Kate Hudson as rock band-aid Penny Lane, Frances McDormand as a worried mother, and the scene stealing Philip Seymour Hoffman as rock critic Lester Bangs.  Every one of these characters is lovable despite their flaws.  The soundtrack is absolutely amazing, and it is integral to the tale Crowe is weaving for the audience.  This is an all-time best movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>Inspired by Cameron Crowe's real-life journeys and writings of some of rock and roll's biggest names(at least during the 70's anyways), the film is a kind of autobiographical-but-sort of telling of a boy becoming a man in probably the most un-innocent way a boy can.<br /><br />William Miller is an aspiring journalist who writes for some magazines, notably Creem. He meets Lester Bangs, a legendary critic/journalist who warns him of rock stars. He gives him an assignment to do a writing on a Black Sabbath concert and get an interview but he's not allowed backstage. Until up-and-coming band Stillwater decides to bring him in. He becomes so well-liked that Rolling Stone offers to send him on tour with the band and do a piece on them. And so the journey begins.<br /><br />With a largely 60's-70's soundtrack and many classic scenes, it's kind of hard not to like the film. The director's cut fleshes things out even more with more development into the characters, in particular band aid(don't call her a groupie) Penny Lane.<br /><br />While Kate Hudson is a nice find(not to mention cute), it's Billy Crudup to me who makes the better performance. Flawed, funny, and weirdly likable. Patrick Fugit is good in some scenes but other scenes it's almost like he didn't go further than he could've. Phillip Seymour Hoffman also gives a great performance as Lester Bangs, an actual journalist.<br /><br />Personally on a given day, I still prefer Jerry Maguire but this is probably Cameron's 2nd best film, even though it's obviously his most personal.</p></br><a href="../users/A34ZAYTNP67S83.html">A34ZAYTNP67S83</a><br/><p>I originally saw this film in the theatre, and after having bought this particular package, I have to say it's a much better movie with the extra footage.<br /><br />If you watch the both versions back to back, the omissions are glaring in the theatrical cut.  The film would likely have garnered more Oscars than nominations had this footage been in the theatrical release.<br /><br />No matter, for those of us who have a love-hate relationship with the DVD industry, this is one director's cut that justifies the format in every single way.  Oh, did I mention the performances?<br /><br />From top to bottom, everything about this movie is perfect.  From the casting to the editing, from the music selection to the writing, there isn't a weak link in the chain.  Cameron Crowe seemingly goes from strength to strength, and this film represents the pinnacle of his life as a filmmaker.<br /><br />Although I grew up with a big crush on Drew Barrymore, I have to say that Kate Hudson (at least in this role) was MADE for the big screen.  Hopefully she'll get more dramatic parts, but I have a feeling this will be the crowning gem in her career.  She's absolutely luminous, and has you alternately saddened and infatuated at various times throughout the movie.<br /><br />Frances McDormand is also stellar in her supporting role; she gets the biggest laughs.  Just when I thought Crowe wouldn't be able to top "Say Anything", he pulls this one out of thin air.  Stunning.</p></br><a href="../users/A3U56M0Y8LYO6J.html">A3U56M0Y8LYO6J</a><br/><p>Cameron Crowe's "Almost Famous" is a love letter to rock music.  You can feel his affection for the music and the culture that it spawned coursing through every scene of this film.  When creators talk of projects that are deeply personal to them, this is the type of project they are talking about.  <p>A teenager named William Miller (Patrick Fugit) is chosen by Rolling Stone magazine to write an article on an up-and-coming rock band called Stillwater.  The band finds it difficult to take the young writer seriously but eventually guitarist Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup) starts to warm up to him.  However, a groupie named Penny Lane (Kate Hudson) makes life difficult for the two men as her energetic spirit captures both of their hearts.  As William's journey with the band becomes more prolonged, he discovers more and more with each passing day that his romanticized perception of rock stars was a product of his youthful idealism.  <p>"Almost Famous" is an enchanting work that is blessed with memorable performances.  Fugit, Crudup, and Hudson are great and the supporting work turned in by Frances McDormand, Jason Lee, and Philip Seymour Hoffman is equally solid.  Hudson in particular sparkles in her role and proves that she possesses that rare ability to light up the screen every time she appears in a scene.  Her work in this film is like an announcement to the Hollywood community that a new star has arrived.  Crowe must also be singled out for his good work.  It is oftentimes difficult for filmmakers to capture the essence of their subject matter, but Crowe admirably pulls it off with "Almost Famous."</p></br><a href="../users/AVCRD98TH48RN.html">AVCRD98TH48RN</a><br/><p>4.5 stars.  While the script is the actual star of the film, the cast is exceptional as an ensemble and every actor here is worth mentioning at least once.  But it's the word-play and the situations that these fine actors find themselves in that propells the film forward.  The script is so sharp, in fact, that many times during the movie I felt some of the actors had a hard time keeping up.  Don't take that as a negative criticism because screenplays are rarely this well-written with such a huge cast as its centerpiece.  It just doesn't come together all the time.  I should not forget to mention the outstanding soundtrack, which I'm sure was hand-picked by Cameron Crowe.  He is notorious for his films having fantastic soundtracks.  "Singles," for instance.  I have watched this movie many times and I always laugh and get carried away with the interesting lives of those on tour.  This movie has great acting, an exceptional script, and another great soundtrack.  This is a journey worth taking.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FDW1SPYKB354.html">A1FDW1SPYKB354</a><br/><p>I had the awful feeling that I was going to hate this movie when I popped in this DVD for my inaugural look at the film. But my initial apprehension toward the picture vaporized almost instantly upon watching the film's first scene.<br /><br />I couldn't believe how much I liked this movie.  In my view, Director/Producer/Writer Cameron Crowe has done the near-impossible with this motion picture.  That being: He's taken a group of people that could have been so easily looked down upon and intensely disliked, and instead turned this assorted band of musicians, groupies, mothers, sisters, and rock-n-roll managers into some of the most interesting and fun-to-watch individuals ever to share a movie set together.<br /><br />Add to this mix one very likeable-right-off-the-bat young 15-year-old would-be music journalist (played to perfection by Patrick Fugit), and what you have in your midst is a highly-entertaining movie about ambition, music, a devoted mother's love, soul-searching, friendships, and chasing dreams.<br /><br />Every scene in this film is a memorable one. The whole movie feels "real", in this writer's opinion. Nothing seems faked, or phonied, or Hollywoodized. A reason for this, of course, is in large part due to the fact that the film is a great deal auto-biographical, with Fugit portraying Crowe when Cameron was a teenaged writer for Rolling Stone Magazine.<br /><br />And while it's rated "R" (for language and drug content), the film never once bogs itself down with the cliched rock band negativity of drugs, sex, and booze.  Sure, these elements are shown through Mr. Crowe's camera lens; but it's never displayed in such a way as to be a turnoff.  If this film were in the form of a book, it would indeed be described as a real "page turner".  The viewer anxiously awaits the next "page" (scene).<br /><br />There are two scenes in this film that are true "set pieces" in my mind (and after just seeing the movie one time).  One such piece occurs as the fictional band with which our talented young "Rolling Stone" journalist ("William Miller") is travelling encounters severe turbulence on an airplane flight taking the group to its next concert date.  As the severe thunderstorm batters the plane to the point where all aboard are nearly convinced they'll soon be meeting an untimely demise, one by one the passengers begin to confess their inner-most secrets and indiscretions. This fabulous scene is at the same time comical, bittersweet, and poignant.  As the aircraft finally breaks free of the turbulent air, much to the delight of the exuberant pilots, our band of passengers is too mentally drained from the confessions they've just offered up to each other to join in the celebration of the fact that they are, in fact, going to survive the ordeal.  The scene concludes comically with a member of the group, who has just informed everyone of a dark secret concerning sexual orientation, slamming the cockpit door closed to silence the cheers of the pilots.  Great, great scene!<br /><br />Another highly-memorable portion of the film takes place on the band's tour bus.  Elton John can be heard on the bus radio, singing "Tiny Dancer".  Gradually, the vehicle is filled with singing, as everyone begins joining Elton in belting out the tune.  This scene is one to play over and over again, as the feeling of togetherness and harmony fills the bus at that moment.<br /><br />The DVD presentation here is as flawless as the film contained on the disc.  Picture quality is exceptional via the nice 1.85:1 Widescreen Anamorphic transfer. And the Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround soundtrack is definitely robust enough to give those speakers a nice workout, especially during the many musical numbers heard throughout the movie.<br /><br />There's an adequate Making-Of featurette included as well, which contains several photos of a young Cameron Crowe "on the road" as a Rolling Stone scribe.<br /><br />For anyone who hasn't seen this picture who might be thinking (as I did before viewing it) that this is a movie filled with loud, obnoxious, cocaine-snorting booze-heads and the less-than-desirable environs that people of that ilk generally inhabit, let me assure you that "Almost Famous" will pleasantly surprise you.<br /><br />These characters are well-written, never "over the top", and totally engaging from the first chapter of this DVD until the last.<br /><br />It immediately has zoomed into my Top 25 of all-time favorite flicks!<br /><br />I still can't believe how truly good this movie is.  It's one that could easily be viewed time and again, and enjoyed just as much with each successive screening.</p></br><a href="../users/A27PSZX2SE0B51.html">A27PSZX2SE0B51</a><br/><p>There's a moment early on in &quot;Untitled&quot;, Cameron Crowe's 'Bootleg' Director's Cut of &quot;Almost Famous&quot;, where rock critic Lester Bangs (Phillip Seymour Hoffman), in mid-rant, claims that the Box Tops' &quot;The Letter&quot; says more in less than two minutes, without even trying, than Jethro Tull can say in hours, while trying their damndest.  It got me thinking: why didn't Crowe take his own advice?  Why did he take a perfectly serviceable 122-minute movie that appeared to say everything, and turn it into a 162-minute movie?  Well, I've seen &quot;Untitled&quot;.  It blows up &quot;Almost Famous&quot;, makes it spectacle and spectacular, while never losing its intimate edge.<p>This is a case where more of a good thing doesn't turn into too much of a good thing.<p>What do you get with &quot;Untitled&quot;?  Well, more character.  Backstories are fleshed out, relationships are better defined, and the humanity becomes more human.  We see William's (Patrick Fugit) kleptomania, along with more examples of how his youth made him an outcast.  We get Penny Lane's (Kate Hudson) nurturing side, explicitly portrayed.  And we get a full-on glimpse of Jeff Bebe's (Jason Lee) envy, why it started and how it manifests itself.  A couple of full scenes are added, most notably a radio station appearance that's terribly funny, albeit irrelevant to the plot.  But most of the additional footage comes from existing scenes being lengthened.  More often than not, the point is clarified without boring the audience with tediousness.<p>The audio commentary begins with Cameron Crowe outlining the two paths they might go down.  The first is the hemming-and-hawing path, where all the truths are covered up, in favour of banal stories and technical information.  The second path is the heart-on-your-sleeve path, where all the inspirations and backstories are owned up to, where mistakes are agonized over, and the truth is king.  If you've ever seen a Cameron Crowe movie, or heard the man speak more than two sentences, you'll know which path he chooses.<p>Crowe dominates the track.  He's joined by a couple of execs (or PA's or something; they're never really introduced and don't say much).  But the real treat of the track is the inclusion of one Mrs. Alice Crowe, Cameron's mom (and Frances McDormand's doppelganger).  Besides being a doting mother, and quick to offer praise for her son, she also offers some real insights into the genesis of the film.  She appears to know the movie backwards and forwards, and acts as further proof of the film's accuracy.  It's amazing to see how much of the movie was really based on actual events.  Every scene appears to begin with either Cameron or Alice being taken aback by the memories it invokes.<p>This is probably one of the best commentary tracks I've heard, for the inclusion, in equal measure, of technical information, on set anecdotes, and passion.<p>Also included on Disc One is real life video footage of an interview with Lester Bangs.  Lester's vitriol is palpable, his menacing nature is enormous, but his warmth shines through.  It's an interesting tidbit, in that it offers further proof that Hoffman is one of the greatest actors working today, for he doesn't stoop to imitating Lester.  It's more like channeling.  Then, Cameron includes a list -- complete with fully-represented album covers -- of his top albums of 1973 (the year the film is set).  An interesting curiosity.  Some of the works actually inform specific scenes from the film, which is kind of a neat trick.  They've also put together a &quot;video&quot; for the Stillwater song &quot;Love Comes and Goes&quot;, which is basically a montage of behind-the-scenes moments from the Rock Camp the actors had to go through.  More of this can bee seen on &quot;B-Sides&quot;, another video montage.  Most interesting is the inclusion of seven of Crowe's Rolling Stone articles from the era, printed in their entirety.  It's not hard to see the nascent voice of Crowe the filmmaker shining through these passion-filled pieces.<p>Disc Two has a lot less going for it.  Its main feature is the original theatrical version of the movie.  Also included is the full-length (15 minutes or so) Cleveland Concert, parts of which we see in the movie.  Despite the fact that Billy Crudup sometimes plays notes not actually in the songs, and that Jason Lee still has to work on his between song banter, this footage shows just how well the actors did in achieving their collective band persona.  The music's not that great, but the vibe, captured by on-stage camera work, is authentic.  The Production Notes section is basically the same essay you'll find in the box's liner notes, only with additional information.  There's an interesting little video moment, with Pete Droge and Elaine Summers singing &quot;Small Time Blues&quot; in a Hyatt House hotel room.  It's a moment quickly passed by in the actual movie.  But here you get to hear the whole song, from William's voyeuristic point-of-view, and it's just stunningly beautiful.  You can also scroll through Crowe's screenplay, peruse the cast and crew bios, and watch the theatrical trailer.<p>Disc Three is an audio CD.  It's got the six Stillwater songs, written variously by Nancy Wilson, Cameron Crowe, and Peter Frampton, among others.  They're not very good songs, and I'm not sure they fit the era they're supposed to come from, but for an &quot;Almost Famous&quot; completist, like myself, it's neat to have them in all their (sub-)glory.<p>A lot of effort was put into making this set look like a real bootleg, the kind of clandestine little document you'd pick up at a seedy record store.  I think the look and feel enhance the movie.  Which was pretty good to begin with.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZSC81MXLBELX.html">A2ZSC81MXLBELX</a><br/><p>This review refers to the Dreamworks March 2001 Widescreen release of the "Almost Famous" DVD..........<br /><br />Watching this film is like being in Rock and Roll Heaven! It is filled with young bright shining stars, under the superb direction of Cameron Crowe(Jerry Maguire). The music is like a trip down memory lane, and is very much a part of this great ensemble.<br /><br />This semi-autobiographical coming of age story, takes a young journalist on the journey of a lifetime. Based on actual events from Cameron Crowe's life, 15 year old William Miller lands a job with "Rolling Stone" magazine. He must go on the road with rockers "Stillwater"(a group actually put together by the filmakers and stars),and write their story. He hangs out everywhere with them, hotels, backstage, rides with them on their bus(this poor guy, a rotten job.. but somebody had to...)and eventually becomes very close with them and the "Band-Aids"(not groupies!) that are their entourage.All this to the constant worry of his over-protective mother, who besides rock and roll is another huge influence on his life.<br /><br />Follow William, the band, and the girls on a tour of a lifetime, in this deliciously funny and sometimes poignant story of learning what's important in life.All filmed beautifully, with those great outfits of the 60's and 70's and of course one killer soundtrack. All the great rock legends of this era are heard throughout the film, including Elton John, The Who, and Peter Frampton whose instruction in music makes "Stillwater" great!The film also includes original music written especially for "Stillwater" that is fabulous as well.<br /><br />The casting is impeccable...William is played by newcomer Patrick Fugit with an intuitiveness that is uncanny. Billy Crudup and Jason Lee are the leads for the band and totaly have that rocker image down pat. Kate Hudson is irresistable as "Penny Lane" and the other "Band-Aids", including Anna Paquin and Fairza Balk also contribute greatly. Two outstanding performances are Frances McDormand as William's mother and Phillip Seymour Hoffman as his mentor.<br /><br />This outstanding film is put together in an outstanding package. The DVD(although no the more expensive one) is a beautiful transfer in every way. The picture is in Widescreen(anamorphic 1.85:1). It's clear, colors are vivid, and shows off the great film work. Lots of choices on the sound(depending on your set up). There's DTS, Dolby 5.1 or 2.0 Surround. The dialouge and music both coming through brillantly. Tons of special features for you to peruse. There's a music video of "Stillwater" doing their song "Fever Dog' from the film, A "making of" featurette, blurbs on the "Rolling Stone" articles done by Cameron Crowe, and cast and crew bios to mention a few.It also comes with a booklet of some production notes, and it is captioned if needed.There is also another edition, a directors cut with some "never before seen footage" and other extras(see buying info) if your looking for even more. This edition though, is also top quality and costs a little less. Whichever edition you choose, if you've seen this film and love it, the DVD is a must have. If you haven't seen it, it's just a MUST!<br /><br />A film to be enjoyed by anyone who loves good movies and good music!  so enjoy.....Laurie<br /><br />also available in this two-pack:<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009IB45">Almost Famous/American Beauty</a></p></br><a href="../users/A1LP6O85Z894GT.html">A1LP6O85Z894GT</a><br/><p>Cameron Crowe, former teenaged rock critic matured into essayist, screenwriter and film director,  created my favorite film of 2000 (tied with "O Brother Where Art Thou") by bottling a precious ingredient found in few movies- real magic. <p>Drawing from his own rich autobiography, Crowe vividly relates the journey of a teenage Odysseus (played here with wide eyed purity by Patrick Fugit) who embarks on a journey of discovery, pain, love, maturation, loss and spiritual awakening. <p>The magic of Almost Famous lies in its characters' abilities to reach that most heroic of human experience: transformation into a better self.<br /><br />Fugit plays William Miller, a fifteen year old genius based upon Crowe himself, who is given the impossible task of writing a "think piece" in Rolling Stone magazine about a fictitious rock and roll band called Stillwater. Forced to travel the road with the band and their entourage of "professional girl friends/fans/groupies"- called band-aides here, Miller finds himself caught between staying true to his calling- writing honestly- and betraying new found friends. <p>Crowe's genius, as previously expressed in his earlier films Say Anything, Jerry Maguire and Singles lies in his ability to craft through careful collaboration with his always superb casts, real people who despite great character flaws and warts, have the spark of goodness inside them. In a Cameron Crowe film, everyone has the chance to be saved- and in their own way- everyone does end up forgiven and transformed.<p>Unlike many of his cold-hearted, mean spirited and cynical film making peers who actively seek out the sordid, the ugly and the destructive in society, Crowe possesses a sincere love not only for his characters and the world they inhabit but for the audience as well. That love radiates throughout every frame of every film he makes (this does not speak to his misstep "Vanilla Sky")<p>Crowe also possesses an uncanny instinct to marry music with the film. The sequence fusing Elton John's "Tiny Dancer" to a Stillwater's collective forgiveness of Russell Hammond is pure bliss. Of course Crowe creates many other similar sequences with music and image.<br /><br />This is not to suggest Almost Famous sugarcoats the harsh realities of an early 1970's rock and roll experience. Crowe is too honest a storyteller to allow that.  Free sex, drugs and the related decadence are ever present as are the consequences for such behavior. There is a real general callous soulessness that lurks on the tip of each scene threatening to consume the frail humanity of this Odyssey. But that evil is held at bay and ultimately destroyed by the great good that certainly dwells in every character's heart.<p>As consistent with all previous Crowe films, the acting ensemble is perfect. She has so many scenes that literally broke my heart while making me smile. Billy Crudup as self obsessed guitarist Russell Hammond, although far too good looking for any real rock star, swings gloriously unpredictable between sullen silence, affable congeniality and rage. He is a star in the making. Jason Lee, as lead singer Jeff Bebe, possesses just the right amount of shallow intellectual posings, narcissistic self promotion and paranoid uncertainty that prevails so many in his vocation. Frances McDormand is absolutely perfect as Miller's hyper-protective Mother. <p>The director's cut DVD is a God Send. The commentary by Crowe and his mother is priceless as is the fleshed out sequences which manage to humanize and elevate the characters even more. Being able to read the complete script is fascinating also as a reference point. It proves the old addage that all good films must begin with a great script.<br /><br />Almost Famous is Absolute Magic. Don't miss this one.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TWTULVD6F22O.html">A1TWTULVD6F22O</a><br/><p>again.  That wierd era where rock bands were eventually swallowed up by the disco craze.  What were we thinking?  Cameron Crowe is obviously an authentic student of the era.  If you don't know that the story is a rough autobiography of Crowe's own experience as the enfant terrible of rock journalism, you may find the plot to be unbelievable.<p>Crowe admits to combining many of the elements of several rock bands that he chronicled for Creem and Rolling Stone to create Stillwater, the fictional rock band of this tale.  Sights, sounds, clothing and thought processes of the era are all faithfully reported in this gem of a movie.<p>Watching the Crowe interview in the special features section, and checking out his Rolling Stone articles, you know that the casting director for the film was a genius.  Unknown Patrick Fugit has many of the mannerisms and wistfulness that made &quot;then-Cameron&quot; and &quot;now-Cameron&quot; delightful and admirable.<p>The real star of the movie is the music, and the mix of authentic and pretend rock of the era, along with some of its unusual anthems (all of Elton John's early music touched cords in rock lovers - we weren't sure why we loved it, but we did).  The group scenes in the movie, most set to music, have an authentic camaraderie and sense of &quot;chilling&quot; that made ecletic groups of band members such memorable icons of the era.  <p>Crowe was obviously enamored of both his mom and Lester Bangs, an early mentor.  He cast them richly with the incredible Frances McDormand and a beautiful cameo piece by Phillip Seymour Hoffman.<br />Many of the band members and wannabes were well cast, but the centerpiece is Kate Hudson, who illuminates the screen with her charisma and vulnerability.  A well deserved Oscar for a talented young actress.<p>This film earns a resounding 5 stars - there is not a target audience, because there will be something for everyone to enjoy.<br />Buy, don't rent the DVD!</p></br><a href="../users/A2TZKXU6Q0EDNP.html">A2TZKXU6Q0EDNP</a><br/><p>Roll back the 70s: a teenaged reporter who writes reviews for  underground rock-mag Creem gets a sudden break when he's employed by big-league-mag Rolling Stone to go on the road with up and coming Stillwater and deliver a report on them.<br />  During a wild 3 weeks on the road he (and we) sees the inside of rock n' roll of that era. All the elements are there. The 70's looks and attires, the drugs, the music (original songs written among others by P.Frampton and Cameron Crowe), the teeny "rebellions", the inner band strifes,the groupies and the developing rock industry, the then societal pulse, and the overall atmosphere set by the film's main characters, most notably the teen-reporter, star-groupie Penny Lane and of course the band members and last but not least the boy's "crypto-conservative" desperately-trying-to-be-progressive mother.<br />  "Almost famous" is a brilliant film. Before you can even begin to care whether what the film depicts is accurate, you find yourself laughing endlessly, and being "sucked-in" by a story that at times has semi-documentary touches (makes sense, as the story is a semi-biographical account of Cameron Crowe's) and loving the main characters (all charismatic in their own sense).<br />  The film's main "weapon" is its superb humor. I dont merely mean one-liners but the overall feeling it has, you dont only laugh but this movie tends to have a feel-good sense all over it as well. It's supposed to, right? After all, this is the 70s when everything still had a "purpose" or when things seemed to be more upbeat (compare with the prozac ridden 90s and their "nowhere to go from here" sentiment).<br />  All the actors do a terrific job to make the time machine work here. The mother is great in portaying a representative of the mothers generation that first perceived music as an "enemy" and as a gateway to drugs and (oh my god) wild sex. The band members are going from cool to uncool all the time (as real band members very often do) as they try to act like rock stars ("make us look cool, man") and at the same time try to maintain their human nature (...). The teeny reporter (in my opinion the least convincing of the lot) is decent too while the show is stolen by the enigmatic and pivotal character of groupie Penny Lane. She's is the one character that the others actually revolve around like satellites whether they realise it or not and also serves as a solid reminder of that period as well ( or maybe, not only of that period, in fact, why is rock music being mostly made if not to be "cool and get chicks")..<br />  The dialogue is great, the directing is great, the actors do a great job. Anything missing from Almost Famous to keep it from being a classic?? I would think not, but: because of the way this film works and of its very nature ppl will tend to see it as somewhat of a documentary. Is it? Tough question that one.<br />  The rock era of the 70s wasnt a monodimensional one. It wasn't only about bands that were Led Zepellin lookalikes and people who  were constantly professing "it's all happening man", and above all things were not always that lighthearted. In fact, a lot of people back then thought that there was a musical revolution going on which was going to -in turn- bring about an overall change of things. Ask anyone who's over 45 whether the music of that era did bring about a revolution and get prepared for some really long discussions with very differing conclusions.  Inotherwords, there were very many people around back then who took the whole thing very VERY seriously. Perhaps that is -epidermically- depicted by the rock critic in the film.<br />  It would be unfair though to criticize the film on that premise. After all you cant expect a film to fit in all that in 2 hours. And even if it somehow had done that it could've very easily been boring albeit more accurate.<br />  The fact of the matter is that "Almost Famous" is a wonderful film in very many respects. It goes from hilariously funny to touching with its dripping nostalgia. And yes it does have this "things were better and purer back then" feeling to it, but in the end the way people perceive the times they live in depend on very many different factors.<br />  I've seen this movie twice already and loved it both times and i hardly see how anyone could not love it actually no matter what other thoughts are to be had on the side.<br />  Almost famous is almost perfect</p></br><a href="../users/A1J2931UBBJPXM.html">A1J2931UBBJPXM</a><br/><p>It's 1973, San Diego, California; an exceptionally bright fifteen-year-old aspiring journalist with his heart in rock n' roll goes after an interview with a heavyweight metal band in town for a concert, and winds up tagging along on tour with a band called Stillwater, in "Almost Famous," a semi-autobiographical story from writer/director Cameron Crowe.  And once the bus leaves, it's music, mirth, mayhem and an unforgettable, career-launching experience for young William Miller (Patrick Fugit), as he gets a first hand look at what living the life of a rock musician is all about.  It's a lot to take in, but Miller's intelligence and adaptability belies his youth and he eases into his role quite naturally, with a little help from a couple of new friends:  Penny Lane (Kate Hudson), leader of the groupie elite "Band aids," following Stillwater on their tour; and Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup), who plays lead guitar for the band.  For young William it's a foray into a real fantasy world, through which he conducts himself professionally and objectively; quite a triumph considering his previous experience as a writer was limited to a few unsolicited submissions to "Rolling Stone" and "Creem" magazines, from which he received, up to this point, no response whatsoever.  His only real link to any of it, in fact, has been a chance encounter with Lester Bangs (Philip Seymour Hoffman), editor of Creem, who ultimately becomes something of an anchor to reality for Miller.  Cameron Crowe has given us a brilliant film that works on a number of levels; it's entertaining and insightful, delivered from his own unique perspective and presented objectively and without moralizing.  It's like an excellent piece of journalism committed to film, which enables the audience to make that necessary emotional connection that makes it all so satisfying.  Whether or not you even like rock n' roll, it's undeniably a force that has long since been ingrained in the universal consciousness of the world, and Crowe has captured the essence of it's soul in this movie.  There are characters and moments here with which everyone will be able to readily identify; from Miller's mother, Elaine (wonderfully played by Frances McDormand), the professor who cannot understand the music and fears the influence of it on her children, to the kid who just loves the music, to those obsessed and taken over by it.  It's a detailed look at what it means to be, not necessarily a rock "star," but a struggling band grabbing for the brass ring, and how it affects the lives of so many people directly and indirectly involved.  Crowe takes it deep and demonstrates the upside as well as the down, in a way that sparks the imagination without being too graphic.  It's a movie that allows you to experience the exhilarating, sometimes manic highs as well as the unpleasantness that must accompany it, but Crowe takes pains to deliver the message without ever taking you into unnecessarily dark or murky waters.  He maintains a delicate balance throughout the film that gives it both conscience and credibility.  There are a number of memorable performances, beginning with Fugit, who does such a great job of conveying the maturity of his character, which makes him so believable.  Billy Crudup and Jason Lee (as lead singer Jeff Bebe) breathe life into Stillwater, while Kate Hudson absolutely sparkles as Penny Lane.  And Hoffman takes the small role of Lester Bangs and imbues him with such spirit and nuance that his presence is felt throughout the entire film, as is Elaine, thanks to the tremendous talent of McDormand.  Rounding out the terrific supporting cast are Anna Paquin (Polexia), Fairuza Balk (Sapphire), Terry Chen (Ben Fong-Torres) and Zooey Deschanel (Anita Miller).  "Almost Famous" is, in the end, a stirring, thoroughly enjoyable experience; there's great music and some madness, and some real lessons about life in the real world to be learned along the way.  It's a film with wide appeal and something in it for everyone; and if you've ever listened to a record or heard a song, believe me, this is one movie you're going to want to see.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GN8UJIZLCA59.html">A1GN8UJIZLCA59</a><br/><p>The main character in Almost Famous is a 15 year old rock journalist named William Miller.  He gets the chance to write an article for Rolling Stone magazine about an up and coming rock band, Stillwater.  He goes out on tour with the band and what starts out as a simple assignment, turns into a life altering experience for all involved.  The character of William is director and writer Cameron Crowe's on screen alter ego.  Mr. Crowe was a 15 year old who wrote for Rolling Stone and the story is based on his life.  The film also involves William's overprotective and aggressive mother (played by Frances McDormand) and the battles she waged with his sister.  They are based on Mr. Crowe's own family's struggles and the fact that he was willing to air his family's problems in public adds a touch of humanity and reality to the film.  Stillwater is led by Jeff Bebe and Russell Hammond who bicker at one another about the band's future and possible fame. Billy Crudup plays Russell the lead guitarist and Jason Lee is Jeff the lead singer.  They have a natural fear of the press and refer to William as the enemy.  In fact, William struggles to get an one on one interview with Russell throughout the film.  The band is followed on tour by a bunch of groupies who refer to themselves as Band-Aids.  Their leader is Penny Lane played wonderfully by Kate Hudson.  She is in love with Russell, but it is William whom she confides in.  The tender relationship between Penny &amp; William is one of the film's great strengths. Throughout the film, William seeks and gets advice from legendary rock critic Lester Bangs.  Mr. Bangs is played amazingly by Philip Seymour Hoffman.  Mr. Hoffman provides the film's conscious and his brief time on the screen is electric. All the performances in the film are first-rate including Ms. Hudson who is luminous, Mr. Crudup is brooding and dark, Mr. Lee is self-righteous and Ms. McDormand is a fierce presence.  But the most startling performance is that of Patrick Fugit as William. Mr. Fugit had never appeared in a movie before and had minimal acting experience, but he is the emotional center of the film, the link between al the characters.  He plays William perfectly and captures the essence of what Mr. Crowe was trying to capture.  Mr. Crowe guides the film with an eye for detail as the sets and feeling are completely real and harkens the spirit of the 70's.  His screenplay perfectly balances drama and comedy and has some of the sharpest dialogue in a long time.  Mr. Crowe took home a Best Original Screenplay Oscar at the 2000 Academy Awards for this great script. Almost Famous is Mr. Crowe's love letter to his youth and the 70's.  The film is easily his most personal, but it is the personal touch he adds that gives the film its universal appeal.</p></br><a href="../users/A17FLA8HQOFVIG.html">A17FLA8HQOFVIG</a><br/><p>This original screenplay won an academy award this year and I can understand why.  There's a lot of heart in it as it's based on the writer/director Cameron Crowe's own experience as a teenage writer for Rolling Stone Magazine.  <p>The young Patrick Fugit is cast as William Miller,  the 15-year-old reporter who, with a combination of pluck and luck manages to get an assignment to write about the fictional rock band, Stillwater.  He's a true innocent and plays the role with wide-eyed wonder as he winds up traveling with the band, much to the upset of his mother, played by Frances McDormand.  Billy Crudup, with his chiseled good looks plays the lead guitarist of the band and his role goes beyond the stereotype of a rock musician.  And then there is the lovely Kate Hudson, who adds sparkle and sensitivity to her role as a groupie.  William Seymour Hoffman also adds his talents as the writer/rock critic who the young William looks up to as his mentor.  It's a great cast.<p>The best part of this film, though,  was the way the screenplay captured the time and place of the rock music scene of the 70s.  Some of the music was original and some were old favorites such as &quot;America&quot; by Simon and Garfunkel, &quot;Every Picture tells a Story&quot; by Rod Stewart and :The Wind&quot; by Cat Stevens.  The details were all there -- the attitude, clothing, and youthful energy that was so much a part of the times.  I couldn't help but notice though that even though drugs were talked about, there wasn't much on-screen drug use. This is to the film's credit which was, basically, about the relationships between the people as well as the music.<p>The world that this film captures so well is long gone.  The characters have grown up and the young reporter is now a successful Hollywood screenwriter. The intensity of the times have faded and we now live in a world of computers and cell phones.  What a delight it was though to again feel the pulse of the 70s and hear the music once again.</p></br><a href="../users/A38QEATH3NODFM.html">A38QEATH3NODFM</a><br/><p>I have watched this film several times over the years, and each time i see something new.

I am sure you know what it's about. What Cameron Crowe has done, is design a world that seemingly you feel a part of. This utopia where dreams in fact can and do come true, where if you just have some guts and some brawn and go with your heart, the road may lead to a different path than you first intended, where music placed in the most perfect of scenes can transport you to a time of endless love and karma and you can, if only for an hour or two, wonder why the world can be so cruel and unkind. Kate Hudson is radiant. I fell in love with Penny Lane. I wanted to run my fingers through her hair, let her cry on my shoulders, sing to her. I feel in love with Billy Crudup, his passion for music ignited another fire in me that was brewing for some time: to get out and see the small things that perhaps in the day to day heydey of living, I take for granted. If you haven't seen this yet, take the plunge, watch more filmmaking that crosses the threshold from simply a movie, to a journey.<br /><br />That my fine friend, that in all its joyous craft and benevolence is what Almost Famous is to me. A journey of the heart, a journey of the soul and a journey of a boy and a dream and the perservarance to give it all he could. Truly something that finally deserves 5 stars in my book. Cameron Crowe is a powerhouse with this motherload!<br /><br />So grab a handful of this and run with it, it deserves a place in your heart as well.</p></br><a href="../users/A10ODC971MDHV8.html">A10ODC971MDHV8</a><br/><p>Set in the early 1970s, and based on actual events in the life of writer-director Cameron Crowe--once an underage Rolling Stone scribe himself--"Almost Famous" is a beautifully observed coming-of-age drama that captures the spirit of an era with soulful warmth and bittersweet insight. Crudup, McDormand, Hudson, and wide-eyed newcomer Fugit all deliver vivid, well-rounded performances, while a brief early appearance by Philip Seymour Hoffman as real-life gonzo critic Lester Bangs remains indelible. Crowe's songs of innocence and experience will rock your world.</p></br><a href="../users/A1YQ6QB2127AJ4.html">A1YQ6QB2127AJ4</a><br/><p>This is one of the best movies released in 2000.  Cameron Crowe amazingly reflects on his times as a writer while traveling with legendary bands(Led Zeppelin, Allman Brothers, The Eagles, etc.).  He takes certain events that occurred during each tour and gives it to the movie's band.  Every piece of that fits perfectly amongst one another to create one masterpiece movie.  It's great that Crowe can make some of those serious events and put some comedy in them. Therefore, he was well-deserving of his Oscar win for Best Original Screenplay.<br /> Patrick Fugit makes a triumphant debut as William Miller.  If he continues to do movies in this style, he'll go far with his acting career.  Why did Marcia Gay Harden win the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress("Pollock") over Kate Hudson as "Penny Lane"?  Who knows.  Frances McDormand performs wonderfully outside her usual style as William Miller's overprotective mother.  This is Billy Crudup and Jason Lee at their best as the lead guitarist and lead singer of Stillwater.  Though Fairuza Balk and Anna Paquin had minor roles as band aids, their acting shined.  This is one of Paquin's best roles since her Oscar winning role(at the age of 11) in "The Piano".<br /> "Almost Famous" could be a huge influence for those who dream of making the big-time in music, any genre.  This is also a good one for those who are looking for quality comedy.  There are many surprises so one will laugh unexpectedly in various parts.  Why wasn't it nominated for the Oscar for Best Picture or Best Director for 2000?

All the performances in the film are first-rate including Ms. Hudson who is luminous, Mr. Crudup is brooding and dark, Mr. Lee is self-righteous and Ms. McDormand is a fierce presence. But the most startling performance is that of Patrick Fugit as William. Mr. Fugit had never appeared in a movie before and had minimal acting experience, but he is the emotional center of the film, the link between al the characters. He plays William perfectly and captures the essence of what Mr. Crowe was trying to capture. Mr. Crowe guides the film with an eye for detail as the sets and feeling are completely real and harkens the spirit of the 70's. His screenplay perfectly balances drama and comedy and has some of the sharpest dialogue in a long time. Mr. Crowe took home a Best Original Screenplay Oscar at the 2000 Academy Awards for this great script. Almost Famous is Mr. Crowe's love letter to his youth and the 70's. The film is easily his most personal, but it is the personal touch he adds that gives the film its universal appeal.  This is an expanded three disk DVD that has everything one could want regarding the film including a disk of Stillwater's live performance that was filmed for the movie and vintage Cameron Crowe Rolling Stone work.  The DVD is as expansive as any released and worth the few extra bucks.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TK6R2JSC97HL.html">A1TK6R2JSC97HL</a><br/><p>"Almost Famous" is a sort of riff on Director Cameron Crowe's early years reporting for Rolling Stone.  You don't have to be a rock enthusiast to enjoy its sweetness.  Set in the early 1970's, when rock was drenched in a sort of easy-going, sun dried, alcohol and drug-fueled haze, and teenagers across America worshipped at the altar of Led Zeppelin with a fervor thought reserved by Star Trek fans, it tells the story of William Miller, a high-schooler trying to become a Rock N' Roll Journalist.  Preternaturally mature (by age 11, he's in the same class as 13 year olds, and they still hate him), and sheltered at home by a lovingly domineering mother (superb Frances Mcdormand), William falls in love with Rock yet is less determined to become a rocker himself than follow in the footsteps of  the legendary Lester Bangs, the self-appointed Dean of Rock Criticism.  Getting his first break writing for Bangs's "Creem" magazine, Miller gets his big break when he's tagged by Rolling Stone to cover the burgeoning band "Stillwater" on its "Almost Famous '73" tour.  Bangs remains ever present mentoring Miller through the process of covering the fast-rising band, an endeavor that requires Miller to remain aloof and objective, but not so distant that the band's suspicious members won't shun him as "the enemy".  Despite her better instincts, and on Miller's oath that he won't miss high-school graduation, Miller's mother allows the boy to go on tour with Stillwater, a fictional band loosely hinting such 70's confabs as Credence, the Allman Brothers and the Eagles.  A steady stream of sex with the band's dedicated groupies (called "Band-aids", young girls with fake names who insist that they're there for the music) and various feuds between band members helps to occupy Stillwater's principals, and frustrate Miller's attempts to get the band to say anything coherent on tape.  Too sweet (or uncool) to be insistent, Miller follows the band across America, watching self-imposed deadlines come and go.  Adding to Miller's stress is his own burgeoning love for Band-Aid in-chief, "Penny Lane" (Kate Hudson), whose adoration for Russel Hammond (Crudup), Stillwater Lead Guitar, blinds her to how the band uses its groupies.<p>"Almost" is a great movie, one of those understated gems from director Cameron Crowe. Though an anthem to 70's rock fandom, the film excels on its characters -  Stillwater's lead vocalist's pompous platitudes on the significance of Rock, Crudup's acid-induced meanderings at a party he crashes in Topeka, Phillip-Seymour Hoffman as the sage Bangs and especially Macdormand.  Like a band, the film excels not only on solo acts but also on how the characters impact each other - the look on the Topeka partygoers or (in one of the flick's running gags) the look on the faces of hotel workers who have to take messages from Miller's mother, or the lecture that Hammond receives from Mrs. Miller herself.  (I'm not sure if Mcdormand's character is supposed to be a reference to the song, Mother", off of Pink Floyd's "The Wall".)  Above all, the script drips with tasty lines, bizarrely unforgettable zen koans (like the one about groupies who eat steak but don't use birth control) and a fair amount of period rock references.  When Crudup's Russel Hammond proclaims himself a "golden god", you might miss the Zeppelin reference, but you won't miss the imagery, one of a lost age that outdid ancient Greece in resembling the cover of "Houses of the Holy".</p></br><a href="../users/A3R2YB0WTTB0IJ.html">A3R2YB0WTTB0IJ</a><br/><p>Director Cameron Crowe's ALMOST FAMOUS is a good rental if you have 2 hours to lose next week-end. Good music, excellent comedians, a few laughs. Good. <p>Things change like old Bob says. Raoul Walsh, Frank Capra or Orson Welles who lived a captivating life never had the vanity to even think to shoot a movie about their own destinies. Nowadays, a former rock journalist can direct a movie involving his mother, his sister, his first love, his first sex night, his first paper, his intimate friends and his &quot;be cool&quot; attitude and show it to an admirative audience. Well, things change like old Bob says. <p>A DVD zone Narcissus.</p></br><a href="../users/A27PSZX2SE0B51.html">A27PSZX2SE0B51</a><br/><p>When I was fifteen years old, I had a subscription to Rolling Stone magazine, and every notebook and backpack I owned bore the logo of Led Zeppelin and The Who.  Which is probably why "Almost Famous" didn't resonant completely with me the first time I saw it.  I wanted to fall in love with fictional band Stillwater just as I had Zep.  But I didn't.  On seeing the film a second time, it's not that surprising.  By the its own admission, Stillwater is an average band making good on charisma and hard work and a touch of luck.  But the music is merely a canvas.  The passions of the individuals involved are the paint that makes this movie a great piece of art.  The boys in the band are passionate about the music.  The groupies (excuse me, "Band-Aids") are passionate about the music, and the bands who make it.  The 15-year old rock journalist (and Cameron Crowe double) is passionate about the music and what it takes to write about it.  His mom is passionate about her beliefs and instilling them in her kids.  And everyone is passionate about finding something real to latch on to, to make them, in the end, "people of substance".<p>And director Crowe is passionate about telling this autobiographical tale with energy and sincerity and dignity, but also about keeping it true, exposing the warts and all.  He does so.  Magnificently.  It lives up its pedigree, being superbly written, honestly acted, and insightful to such a degree that it exposes bone.<p>"The only true currency in this bankrupt world is what you share with someone else when you're uncool," says Lester Bangs (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) at one point.  It is my favourite line in a script that, even though it lacks a "Show me the money" moment ("I am a golden god," pales in comparison), speaks deeply on a lot of personal issues in a pristine and economical way.  A story that on first glance I found meandering and pointless, I appreciate now precisely because it is meandering and pointless.  We follow a rock band on tour.  What could be more meandering and pointless than that?  On the other hand, when one sheds the veneer of cynicism that adulthood saddles us with, we have to realize that there is nothing more beautiful.  To the people living it, it is Bohemia and Valhalla rolled into one.  Beautiful life and beautiful death.  Crowe's script lets these weighty concepts hang in the air, available for the passionate viewer to latch on to, and come along for the ride.<p>The acting ensemble is led by four (and a half) wonderful performances.  Patrick Fugit, in his first major role, is asked to carry the bulk of the film's innocence.  And he does so with aplomb.  It is an assured and strong performance.  Kate Hudson deserves all the accolades she has received.  However, on my first viewing, I had a tough time appreciating her work, because I was busy falling in love with her.  But now I see that she gets things right most of the time, showing she is able to simultaneously play the spirited sprite and the broken old soul.  I also suspect that she must have given the cinematographer fits, because she seems to be composed solely of a warm, bright light.  She glows.  Frances McDormand, on the other hand, plays the dowdy and domineering mom.  The revelation here is that she manages to enliven her with an odd kind of cool.  I adore everything she does here (and in her other movies), and whatever capacity for crushes I had leftover after my run-in with Ms. Hudson, I gave wholeheartedly to Miss McDormand.  Billy Crudup, as Stillwater's mysterious guitarist, didn't have me convinced the first time around.  But on the second pass, I realize that his is the best performance in the movie.  There's a moment near the end that clinched this realization for me.  He realizes he's been duped, and shows his appreciation for the person who got the better of him with a sheepish grin.  It's the capper in a series of subtle suggestive glances that line his flawless performance.  (N.B. The "half" performance noted above belongs to Phil Hoffman, who, in what amounts to an extended cameo, proves once again that he is incapalbe of giving an unrealistic performance)<p>As for the film's insight, well, I'll leave that for you to discover.  Needless to say it will be more beautiful that way.  I know, I know, this all sounds like mindless hippie drivel, but when I encounter a Cameron Crowe film, I find it very easy to wear my heart on my sleeve.  With pride.  And passion.</p></br><a href="../users/AGRR05FH945HR.html">AGRR05FH945HR</a><br/><p>Don't you know now... Well this is how it was, and full marks to Cam Crowe and his insanely talented team for blessing us with this dead-on insight into the world of a touring Rock band and the role of the journalistic 'Enemy'.<br /><br />Cameron and wife Nancy Wilson of Heart even wrote many of the songs, including the superb Fever Dog, with some additional contributions from music guru and Rock God, Peter Frampton. There is also a delightful cameo by Peter as the Humble Pie manager, Reg. Peter was the Pie's lead guitarist, along with the sadly late Stevie Marriott.<br /><br />Not only is this a flawless piece of casting, including the always excellent Frances McDormand as Pat's Mom, but the band are totally believable, even though Billy Crudup and the brilliant Jason Lee weren't even musicians at the outset. You don't get a piece of this quality without a great deal of hard work, research, and attention to detail, and between Peter Frampton and Cameron himself, they have ensured that the finished product is a work of Art.<br /><br />The Bootleg Cut is absurd value, featuring the extended version of the movie, plus the original and an excellent 6 track CD, which includes the Wilson-Crowe classics Fever Dog, Love Thing and Love Comes And Goes.<br /><br />Stillwater are totally believable as a band, musically and visually, and the Cleveland Concert (one of the numerous Special features) looks 100% genuine. Jason's Paul Rogers of Bad Company look is perfect, and his lip-synching is flawless. Likewise Billy's guitar playing.<br /><br />Kate Hudson absolutely shines, as does newcomer Patrick Fugit, who plays 'Cameron'. Naturally, to quote Jason, "the chicks are good", as you might expect with a collection of stunning and talented actresses that includes Kate, Fairuza Balk, Anna Paquin, Olivia Rosewood and Bijou Phillips. Yes, it's a BabeFest.<br /><br />Easily one of the best movies I have ever seen, with a simply stunning soundtrack. Aaaaaah The Rain Song...<br /><br />Take me now, Fairuza...</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZS82R4RC0I2N.html">A1ZS82R4RC0I2N</a><br/><p>A good movie about rock, &quot;Almost Famous&quot; is also one of Cameron Crowe`s best efforts to date. Focusing the daily tribulations of fictional band Stillwater, this story intends to give a scoop into the backstage of the music world, focusing the band members` relationships, the contrived press connections, the groupies` appeal and the extremely difficuld career in the music business. Billy Crudup and Kate Hudson shine as the young, innocent and passionate teen couple who is discovering life through music and must face a new and complex world that forces them to make hard choices. &quot;Almost Famous&quot; is clearly a labour of love, since everyone seems to be enjoying what they`re doing, and the fact that some elements are based on Cameron Crowe`s experiences also helps. Enjoyable and bittersweet, offering strong acting, direction and music, this movie is a worthwile cinematic experience that doesn`t quite change the world but makes it look like a better place. <p>Above average.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JJOV69MAU2J2.html">A1JJOV69MAU2J2</a><br/><p>Cameron Crowe, like any good writer, knows that the best advice for any writer is to &quot;write what you know.&quot; Well, Crowe certainly knows the story of a very young journalist on his first assignment covering a rock band on tour -- because he lived it. <p>This semi-autobiographical take on Rock and Roll, its cynical, destructive and transcendent parts all rolled into one, really sucks you into another time and place the way few movies in recent times have done. The movie feels authentic, in part because the characters are drawn with flaws, with natural story arcs, as opposed to the cardboard cutouts that we have come to expect.<p>William Miller, the boy at the heart of the story, has to balance his boyish desires to be one of the gang with his journalistic intentions to tell the brutal, honest truth.<p>Kate Hudson's character, Penny Lane, injects poignancy into a movie that could have been just another ode to guitar-heads, booze and acid.<p>Frances McDormand, as Miller's mother, also is great as a liberal counterculture mother who contends with her own desires to both protect her son and set him free.<p>The DVD also has a number of interesting extras, including interviews, et al.

This movie is wonderful but in a subtle way, and Oscar prefers less subtlety.  &quot;Almost Famous&quot; is a superb coming-of-age account of Cameron Crowe's early (VERY early) days as a rock journalist.  William Miller, Crowe's alter-ego, is played by newcomer Patrick Fugit, and he is a real charmer!  While this movie takes a little longer to get started than, say, &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot;, it is like having a backstage pass to the glory days of the rock business, &quot;before corporations killed it&quot;, as Lester Bangs supposedly said.  Kate Hudson shines as band-aid Penny Lane, but is it really an Oscar-worthy performance?  We'll find out around the time this review gets posted.  Watch for Peter Frampton in a small role.  This movie will bring back pleasant memories of rock and roll in its pre-corporate heydey, back when the fans decided what was good, rather than having MTV &quot;tell&quot; them.</p></br><a href="../users/A15TNUM2PBS6F0.html">A15TNUM2PBS6F0</a><br/><p>As a fan of most of Cameron Crowe's other work, I was somewhat disappointed with this movie.  It wasn't terrible or the worst movie of the year as some reviewers here seem to think.  It also wasnt' great or one of the best of the year.  It was good, but I also thought it was very boring.  The acting was outstanding by Crudup, Fugit, Hudson, McDormand, and Seymour Hoffman.  The screenplay was good, I was very happy to see Cameron Crowe finally win an award.  He won the Oscar for best screenplay.<p>The idea of this movie really seemed like a good one to me, and when I first watched the movie, I was pretty happy with the outcome.  Then recently I watched it again and was bored.  I kept saying, did i really like this?  It just seemed so lame and to not be going anywhere.  Maybe it just isn't one of the movies, for me anyway, that I can view repeatedly. The music I could certainly listen to over and over.  The soundtrack is better than the movie.<br />I just thought the story was really not all that interesting or entertaining.  It seemed to drag, and it wasn't particularly funny.  If it was supposed to be, I don't know where I was supposed to laugh.<br />It's certainly worth a look at for the great acting and soundtrack and screenplay.  It's just not all that fun to watch.  I compare it to another Crowe movie, Jerry McGuire.  This movie had so much hype, like Almost, and when I saw it in the theaters, I fell asleep!!! I am a woman, and I love romance comedies.  I didn't think either of these films were much of either but more of a sleep aid.<br />I think Crowe's best work was Singles and Say Anything.  They were both very entertaining comedies.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>Almost Famous by director Cameron Crow is just mediocre and completely blown out of proprotion.

Crow hasn't directed or written great movies in the last decade, his best film is Say Anything, not Jerry Maguire or Vanilla Sky. The music is rockin' but Almost Famous had me singing another tune. Skip it.</p></br><a href="../users/AIFNOZKR9WTYI.html">AIFNOZKR9WTYI</a><br/><p>The only possibly interesting relationship in this movie is the boy journalist's relationship with the editor of Creem, who acts as a mentor to him.

For the rest of the time, you get to hear the protagonist getting nagged by his cliche mother who urges him at regular intervals, &quot;Don't do drugs!&quot; You also get to hear him getting the runaround while on tour with the Abe Smellman Group - a band with no appeal, no talent, no existence. The highlight of this band's creativity is when the lead guitarist drops acid and announces, &quot;I am a golden god!&quot; The movie is more or less This is Spinal Tap, with a fifteen year old journalist thrown in... oh yes, and a sixteen year old groupie who bangs all the rockers.

Funny, inspiring, and at times heartwarming, and backed by one of the best soundtracks ever, "Almost Famous" is a cinematic masterpiece that I would place right up there along with "Goodfellas" and "The Godfather". IT IS MY FAVORITE MOVIE.<br /><br />The film (based on Crowe's younger day) takes place in 1973. William Miller (Patrick Fugit) is a 15 year old amateur rock journalist for Cream Magazine. Mentored by world renowned rock writer Lester Bangs (a perfectly snide Philip Seymour Hoffman), he is given by the biggest assignment of his life. He is hired by Rolling Stone to pen an article of the up and coming rock band Stillwater. He is sent out on tour with them, much to the dismay of his overprotective mother (the always wonderful Francis McDormand). He becomes close with the band, but mostly with the band's disillusioned and drug addicted guitarist, Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup). He also meets the woman who will change his life: "band aid" Penny Lane (Kate Hudson, who steals the show). Over the course of the tour, William does a lot of growing up, and learns of the harsh realities of the music industry. By the time the tour is over, he is no longer the 15 year old boy he was when he left.<br /><br />This movie is amazing. The cast is wonderful, and the soundtrack is the greatest ever put onto a film (this can be said for several of Crowe's film soundtracks). "Almost Famous" is a film you'll want to watch again and again.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ.html">A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ</a><br/><p>As I was born in the 1980s, I can only check out the era of blossoming rock'n'roll (Rolling Stones, the Doors, the Beatles, Led Zeppelin) through books and movies. "Almost Famous," a semi-autobiographical movie about the 1970s rock scene, gives a glimpse of the life of a young reporter (based on Crowe himself). A must-see for music fans!<p>When William's sister (Zooey Deschanel) left home, she gave him her collection of records: the Who, Cream, Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix, and many others. When William (Patrick Fugit) is fifteen he manages to get a writing assignment with Creem, and then with Rolling Stone magazine to write about the rising rock band Stillwater (think a mixture of the Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin). William falls in with the Stillwater guys and their circle of adoring groupies, including an effervescent blonde, Penny Lane (Kate Hudson).<p>Despite the displeasure of his controlling but loving mom (she claims adolescence is a marketing ploy), William accompanies Stillwater across the country. He keeps trying to get an interview with guitarist Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup), but Russell is too busy partying with Penny and diving off rooftops (literally) to give William his material. But some alarming incidents show William that the drugs, sex and rock'n'roll are only a veneer for what really matters.<p>"Almost Famous" is a fantastic mixture of expose and tribute -- there's music, there's romance, there's comedy. There isn't a lot of pratfall humor, although there is some (Anna Paquin running smack into a cement wall); the scene on the airplane where everyone confesses their sins is fantastic (Ed's only line is hysterically anticlimactic). We get to see inter-band conflict (who's the star?), groupies, rock journalism, and the unfortunate aftereffects for groupies. Yet the sort-of-romance between Penny and William is very sweet, rooted in genuine affection. <p>Both the glamour and the grit is shown here. The dialogue sparkles ("Last words: I dig music... I'M ON DRUGS!", "Forgive me Father, for I may sin tonight," "I'm about to boldly go where... many men have gone before"), and the direction is superb -- it cuts forward just when it needs to; the camera follows people out onto the dizzying stage and then zooms in for intimate close-ups. Nowhere else could a stomach-pumping scene actually contain an element of romance.<p>Patrick Fugit is a surprisingly solid lead, with a sort of wide-eyed innocence that contrasts sharply with everyone else. Kate Hudson plays a sweet groupie who doesn't practice what she preaches ("Never take it seriously, you never get hurt.") and falls in love with Russell -- only to get tossed away. Her fragile "why doesn't he love me?" is one of the best lines in the movie. Billy Crudup has disarming charm and selfishness as Russell; Anna Paquin is very funny as one of Penny's groupie pals ("Don't worry, he's still a virgin"); Jason Lee is likably grumpy as Jeff Bebe, and Frances McDormand is fantastic as Fugit's weird mother.<p>Music lovers and rock aficionados will love "Almost Famous," a bittersweet coming-of-age comedy/drama/music movie. A rare treat. When and where does this "real world" occur?</p></br><a href="../users/APOUYO1BEPK22.html">APOUYO1BEPK22</a><br/><p>It's 1973 and William Miller (Patrick Fugit) is about to have one of the craziest adventures of his lifetime. He's writing a piece on the new up and coming rock band Stillwater for the magazine Rolling Stones. He's going to get to go on tour with them and write about anything he wants about them for the next month or so. First though he has to get permission from him mom (Frances McDormand)... because he's only 15.<br /><br />Before he gets this little gig, he's trying to get an interview with Black Sabbath when he meets Penny Lane (Kate Hudson), who's not just a groupie, but a Band-Aid. The difference being, she's in it for the music and not the sex with someone popular. Penny is definitely one of those `out of this world' types of girls. Not just in looks, but in her actions as well. She's a legend to the rock bands because she's just so much fun to have around, and she can always light up a room when she steps into it. She tugs on the tendrils of every heart of every man who comes into contact with her. But the only man she truly wants is Russell Hammond.<br /><br />Will is accepted as a friend and not just `the enemy' as usual by the band members of Stillwater. Most notably by Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup) and Jeff Bebe (Jason Lee). Jeff is the lead singer and Russell is the lead guitarist and also heart throb of the group. While Jeff is sort of an open book for Will, it's Russell he's a bit more interested in, mainly because Russ never really gives that interview he's looking for, but more than not just some one liner quotes. As time goes on, we see how the band has some inner turmoil due to Russell's looks. He's becoming the front man of the band when it was supposed to be Jeff, like the plan was. Just like a lot of bands, this one started off great, but slowly, it could be coming to an end.<br /><br />I absolutely love this movie. Every time I watch it I have a big smile on my face almost the whole the time. From the atmosphere to the music to the settings to the parties, everything just makes me happy. Maybe it's because somewhere deep down in me I'm a rock star myself. Sure I can't sing, nor play an instrument (recorders don't count!), but by god I'm a rock star! The whole story is so much fun to watch unfold. Getting to witness the first time William gets to go back stage to the first time he gets to hang out at a hotel party, all the while making sure he calls his mom in the morning to check in, is just so much fun.<br /><br />I actually watched `The Bootleg Cut' of this movie to do this review, and I'm pretty sure it was the first time I ever watched it. It's mostly the same, but more Penny Lane. Those parts were good but there were some parts that I still thought that should've been left out. For instance one scene has Will writing some paper, and his sisters ex comes in his window and starts talking to him about nonsense. It felt very weird and definitely should've been left out. Some scenes I could see why they were left out but were ok I guess. Like a scene that involves Stillwater going to a radio station and doing and interview with a drugged out DJ. It was kind of funny and also a little informative of the situation between Russ and Jeff. But they also left out some scenes. I don't remember them all, but I do remember one. It was the scene where Will is in the hotel room and has some of the girls jumping around him and basically it's left to us, but he has sex with them, which is his first time having sex. They left that out. That was a great scene, so I don't know why it was taken out. Oh well.<br /><br />Also all the actors were great. Kate Hudson was very good, and I love the scene where Will tells her someone sold her for 50 bucks and a case of beer. She starts to cry just a tad, and then asks, "What kind of beer?" and smiles with a tear still rolling down her face. That was awesome. Patrick Fugit was good also, being the nice, sweet, and innocent kid and getting introduced to the life of the rock star.  Jason Lee rocked his part perfectly. He just had that 70's rock band swagger with the long hair flowing and not a care in the world except for his band being awesome. I also liked Billy Crudup and really everyone that was in Stillwater. They just seemed like a real band. So real I'd love to get a faux poster of the actual actors in their get up with a big STILLWATER above them. And Frances McDormand was just phenomenal as the mom of William. You honestly couldn't help love her. She was a great mom, even though a little crazy. You could tell she loved her kids, but was just a little too protective (so the movie makes you think). I actually thought she wasn't that protective though like the movie makes her out to be. Seriously she let her 15 year old kid go on tour with Stillwater to write for the Rolling Stones. At 15 I had to be home by 8pm and 9pm on weekends.<br /><br />It was also fun to see a lot of cameos. Jimmy Fallon (a little more than a cameo), Nick Swardson, Peter Frampton, Zack Ward, Martin Starr, and a lot more.<br /><br />In the end, man I would definitely say own this movie and make it the bootleg edition. That way you can watch both movies versions. I would DEFINITELY watch the award winning Theatrical Version first though.<br /><br />P.S. - The bootleg edition comes with a 6 song EP of Stillwater. I love this CD. `Fever Dog' sounds so good as well as the other songs. I just wish I knew who really sang these songs.</p></br><a href="../users/ABN5K7K1TM1QA.html">ABN5K7K1TM1QA</a><br/><p>Every time they do a writer story I get all choked up.

I watched practically the whole thing with tears in my eyes, partially from nostalgia from the music and the clothes and the hair styles done so perfectly, and partly because the story of &quot;Penny Lane,&quot; sweet flower child groupie, &quot;seamstress for the band&quot; (to borrow a lyric) who has a &quot;rock and roll record&quot; to borrow another lyric (Great White, this time) who wears her sophistication on her sleeve to cover her heart that's also there.  And for a slightly nerdish kid who grows up before our eyes and falls in love and is too young to really be loved in return, a nervous writer on his first assignment who overwrites and sees the best in people, even as they treat him like a little girl, a kid who is so, so unsure of himself.

I understand that Sarah Polley (The Sweet Hereafter 1997) was originally picked to play the part of Penny Lane, and she is a fine talent, but quite frankly Kate Hudson stole all the scenes she was in (she learned it from her mother!) and I don't think the movie would have been quite the beguiling, bittersweet experience it was without her.<p>Billy Crudup (a name to look at twice) manages to look exactly like all the wanna-be rock stars of the seventies wished they had while exuding the kind of charm that breaks hearts as Russell Hammond, guitarist for the band and Penny's true love.  Patrick Fugit is William Miller the would be teenaged writer as hero who is charming, boyish, vulnerable and well, heroic.  Frances McDormand plays his mother with just the right combination of pigheaded earnestness and her unique sense of the comedic.  <p>The entire cast was terrific and the characters were truly original.  The Academy Award winning script was clever and at times profound, interspersed with sparkling lines.  (My favorite, from Lester Bangs on William's school mates: &quot;You'll meet them all again on their long journey to the middle.&quot;)  Also, and this is important, Crowe paid close attention to detail throughout and never lost his concentration.  Everything seemed amazingly authentic right down to the floral stitch on Russell's shirts and the bottles of Jack Daniels in his hands.  And nothing was done in a routine manner.  Every scene was carefully planned and even minor characters were roundly developed.  I'm thinking in particular of Lester Bangs, mentor and cynical rock critic brought to life in a fine performance by Phillip Seymour Hoffman, and William's sweet and slightly dippy sister, vividly portrayed by Zooey Deschanel.  Notice how Crowe even took the trouble to satirize flight attendants with the parody of the stewardess uniforms (day glow orange!).<p>Yes, I loved this film, and I predict that the Academy, whose members obviously did not really SEE this film, will be rewarding the producers sometime down the road for the oversight.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PBV1899CX3TE.html">A2PBV1899CX3TE</a><br/><p>I just read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1556526687">Let's Spend the Night Together: Backstage Secrets of Rock Muses and Supergroupies</a>, by Pamela Des Barres, and one of the chapters was an interview with director Carmeron Crowe. There are 2 dozen interviews, and there is only one other male interviewed, male groupie Pleather. The book chronicles the exploits of groupie's, from Mary Magdalen, through Tura Satana, Pamela herself, Cynthia Plaster Caster, Gail Zappa, Sweet, Sweet Connie of Little Rock, Lori Lightning, Bebe Buell, and Pleasant Gehman, among others. The reason for the inclusion of Cameron is for the film, Almost Famous, and the character of Penny Lane, played by Kate Hudson. She is NOT a groupie, she is a Band-Aid, and the young journalist, William Miller (Patrick Fugit), in an early scene in the film, also claims he is NOT a groupie. I recently emailed Tura Satana, and she also claimed she wasn't a groupie either. She just happened to have had a fling with Elvis, among others. Sure, Tura wasn't a groupie, and maybe you could even say that Elvis was her groupie. Penny Lane, the non-groupie character in Almost Famous, says that groupies do it for the thrill of getting close to someone famous, but "Band-Aids" do it for the love of the music. A better term for them is "Muse" as in someone who inspires an Artist or Musician.<br /><br />Anywhat, Almost Famous is mostly a thinly veiled autobiography of Cameron Crowe, the film director who began writing for Rolling Stone at the tender age of 16. After such an auspicious beginning, he went on to direct<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008G7UK">Say Anything</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0800141741">Jerry Maguire</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JKMZ">Vanilla Sky</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305283516">Singles</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00029RTCG">Fast Times at Ridgemont High (Widescreen Special Edition)</a>.<br /><br />Penny Lane, Polexia Aphrodisia (Anna Paquin), and the other women are somewhat peripheral. Elaine Miller (Frances McDormand), his mother, and his older sister Anita Miller (Zooey Deschanel), play just as pivotal a role in the young auteur's rite of passage. Mother and daughter can't get along, but before she splits to become a Stewardess, older sister leaves him a stash of Rock Albums that will transform his life. Important male figures are Rock Critic/mentor Lester Bangs (Philip Seymour Hoffman), Rolling Stone editors Ben Fong-Torres and Jan Wenner, and the members of Stillwater, who the young journalist is desperately trying to interview for his first feature story.<br /><br />The band Stillwater is totally fictional, yet they are somewhat of an amalgamation of The Allman Brothers and Led Zeppelin, say around the time of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000003CMC">Eat a Peach</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000002J09">Led Zeppelin IV (aka ZOSO)</a>. Probably more Allman Brothers, though not nearly as Southern, with a charismatic guitarist, Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup), representing Duanne Allman, and a talented, though overshadowed, lead singer--shades of Greg Allman--Jeff Bebe (Jason Lee).<br /><br />Jason Lee is of course very familiar from the TV show My Name is Earl, but eerily, he also plays David Seville, manager of The Chipmonks, in the recent remake of that seminal prototype to The Monkees, The Archies, Josie and the Pussycats, Gorrilaz, and other pop music/cartoon, and/or television projects. What is eerie about it is that the opening scene of Almost Famous, the first music heard, is actually the aforementioned Chipmonks, as the young William Miller (Michael Angarano) listens on the radio. Back to Jason Lee, though, he not only sang well, he also acted his part superbly, bristling in the shadow of egomaniac Russell Hammond. Crudup's character is revealed when he attends a party with some mid-west locals, takes a psychedelic drug, and jumps off the house into a swimming pool, proclaiming "I am a Golden God."<br /><br />The DVD includes as a bonus some of Cameron's articles written for Rolling Stone, and they really shed a lot of light on the subject. The Allman Brothers story is written after Duanne Allman's fatal motorcycle accident. Perhaps, then, the Russell Hammond character is based on Jimmy Page, as another important interview of the young scribe was done of Led Zeppelin, who despite their huge success and tremendous album sales, were continuously slagged by critics, chief amongst them, Rolling Stone. There is a lot of mistrust and animus between musician and journalist. When they meet, they nickname him Enemy. Meanwhile, mentor Lester Bangs warns him, whatever you do, don't become their friend.<br /><br />The music for Stillwater was written by Cameron and his wife, Nancy Wilson, of female heavy metal group, Heart. The actors who played the band, Stillwater, were coached by Peter Frampton, who actually got them ready to perform within a few months with a little intense Rock Star Fantasy Boot Camp training. One of the Rolling Stone interviews is of Frampton, just after the huge success of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000009HF2">Frampton Comes Alive!</a>, and just prior to the release of the ill-advised film <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009APB6">Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band</a>. In the preface to that interview, he confesses that he broke the cardinal rule of Rock Journalism, as laid down by Lester Bangs: Don't befriend the musicians. Knowing what a fiasco and career wrecker the movie would be, one can only wonder why he would let his so-called friend make such a disastrous movie. But the amiable Frampton took his success in stride, and seems to have also taken his subsequent fall from grace quite well.<br /><br />But I digress, and just let me say here that the inclusion of the Rolling Stone articles is quite a bonus, as they not only illuminate what goes on in the movie, but also validate the protagonist's saga. Because, if he had sucked as a writer, what a silly story that would have been. But the writing is very impressive, and all the more so when you consider the author's tender age.<br /><br />Patrick Fugit, playing the Cameron Crowe/William Miller character does a fantastic job of acting as well. He yearns to be cool, but he is so not. He has a crush on Penny Lane, and one scene where he is deflowered by some of the other "groupies" is quite tastefully handled, well-acted, and what is most striking is that he makes eye contact with Penny Lane throughout, and you feel that there is some kind of strange love between them, however unrequited it may be. Another scene has Penny asking him if he wants to go to Morocco with her, and he says "Yes," then asks her to ask him again. It was later revealed in the "Making of" footage that he was asking for another take, but they left it in because it was spontaneous and captured an ethereal quality of yearning. Another scene that shows Crowe's skill as a director was one in which Penny Lane (whose real name is finally revealed as Lady Goodman) is smashed on qualudes. As she rolls around vomiting in her diaphanous lingerie, and the young journalist calls for emergency medical assistance, the soundtrack plays Stevie Wonder singing My Cherie Amour. He can't help loving her, in spite of it all. It is just this sort of juxtaposition that makes the mise en sc&egrave;ne of auteur Cameron Crowe unique, and why watching any of his films is always such an enjoyable experience.</p></br><a href="../users/AAEP8YFERQ8FC.html">AAEP8YFERQ8FC</a><br/><p>I'm a big fan of all things 1970s, and am into a lot of rock bands from that era (Yes, Genesis, Jethro Tull, Pink Floyd, etc, etc, etc). I'd heard about "Almost Famous", that it was a rock'n'roll kind of film, but the moment I found out it was set in the 1970s, I kept my eye out for the DVDs. Being born in the 1980s, I can't say whether this was an accurate potrait of the music scene back then, but I certainly found it interesting.<br /><br />William Miller (Patrick Fugit) is a clever kid, so clever he's been skipped ahead two grades. He likes to write, it seems, and he loves rock music and the scene that surrounds it. He wants to become a rock journalist, so he finds a local writer, who gives him a few pointers, and his first job - to write an article. William writes his article, and it goes down really well. So well, in fact, that Rolling Stone magazine give him a call, asking him to go along with Stillwater on the road on their "Almost Famous" tour. He's underage, and has lots of exams to do at school, but with a deep voice over the phone and the help of a "band-aid" by the name of Penny Lane (Kate Hudson), he is off around America with the rock group. On the tour he sees the ups, the downs, the dirty and the cleaned up. He falls in love, learns a lot about himself and hears a little more than a music journalist is supposed to. To top it all off, his concerned mother keeps ringing around, trying to get him to come home!<br /><br />It's an intriguing, involving ride, I thought. You get to see the perspective of a 1970s band, a worried 1970s parent, a 1970s fan, and a 1970s groupie. That's a lot of points of view, and they're all handled thoughtfully, I thought. I like the look of the sets and the locations. The young extras are a nice touch too. The music playing in the background really helped set the scene, I felt. Led Zeppelin, The Who, Simon & Garfunkel, plus a song from a couple of my favorite 1970s groups like Jethro Tull and Yes. It's always nice when a good film has a good soundtrack.<br /><br />If you're interested in 1970s music, this film is definitely worth a look.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HJB9J5O5CLPB.html">A2HJB9J5O5CLPB</a><br/><p>Almost Famous is charming and you can watch it with your older teens.  They'll ask you questions like, were you at Woodstock dad?  Did you do acid and meet mommy in a sleeping bag?  Sure kids, another time, another place, and don't do drugs.<br /><br />Rock died in the mid 70's, came back in Seattle in early 90's, and died again. Roaming the world in bus and jet like gypsies, that's really cool for a little while. Only groupies and drugs make it bearable for the long haul.<br /><br />Cameron Crowe had his experience back in 73 and Almost Famous is his belated version.  The actors are okay, the sets look rock-like, but something is not documentary true about those days. I was there and this fake sex and drugs was not fake in 73. In film, the era is sanitized for paying customers, my teens and the nostalgic baby boomers.  Penny Lane is sure nice for a really bad girl.  Read the screenplay and it's as good as the movie.  Hats off to Camereon.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DY46ZABF4CMQ.html">A3DY46ZABF4CMQ</a><br/><p>What a movie! <p>I remember seeing this movie in the theatres when it came out and i just loved it...i was taken by the honesty of cameron crowe's script writing, the music, the actors, the theme...everything! and now this great special edition of the movie on DVD is released and i just couldn't help but purchase it and enjoy it over and over and over again.<p>the video and audio quality are top notch...the special features which includes the bootleg version, the uncut original full length feature, and an audio CD of Stillwater's songs which appear in the film.<p>Everybody who has seen the movie already knows what a great rock n roll movie it is, possibly the best. anyone who has not seen it yet should simply because this is a classic.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZVERVFM25MJT.html">A2ZVERVFM25MJT</a><br/><p>I guess, like many people, I was unsure about watching a movie about music and set in the 70's.  I am too young to know anything about the 70's, and as the film mostly deals with teenagers, it would appear that it has no market.  Don't let that fool you, as this is one of the best movies of the year!<br />It features star performances from Fugit as the young reporter and from McDormand as his mother.  It's also nice to see Fairuza Balk, such a greatly underrated actress.  The only remotely bad thing I could say about this movie is that Kate Hudson is not nearly as good as I had expected her to be.  She was still very good, just not as superb as I had been led to believe.<br />Basically, although 'Almost Famous' deals with teens, it is far from your typical teen movie.  It raises questions of freedom and restriction alongside the failure of modern music to truly inspire any of us anymore (or that was the message I got anyway).  As William the young reporter leaves his home in hope of freedom, friendship and rock and roll, he slowly realises that this very world he's looking is being destroyed by the people he admires, attempting to overglorify themselves though... reporters.  In short, he's never truly "free", restricted by his own emotions for the beautiful Penny Lane.<br />This is a gorgeous film and one that everyone should see.</p></br><a href="../users/AK6UVFSU07NXH.html">AK6UVFSU07NXH</a><br/><p>Cameron Crowe wrote and directed &quot;Almost Famous&quot;, which is fitting since it is largely about his own beginnings. Cameron was the youngest writer for Rolling Stone magazine and, as a teenage journalist, he followed numerous bands as they went on tour. In this film, these bands are rolled up into a four-man group called Stillwater. These guys get my vote for the best band that never was. Since I was just out of kindergarten when the story was set, you should forgive me for thinking, after my first viewing, that Stillwater was an authentic recreation of some famous group from the early 70's. The realism is that perfect! <p>But this movie is not about a band, at least not predominantly. It is a  coming of age story. A young man raised in an unusual household, with an unusual mother, is taking his first steps to adulthood. The interesting thing is that his first steps are so large as to stretch past most people's entire careers. Through a combination of talent, luck and timing, young William Miller, played perfectly by Patrick Fugit, is recruited by Rolling Stone magazine to write an article on Stillwater. This strange occurrence actually makes sense when you watch the film despite sounding ridiculous as I write it. <p>If William goes through dramatic changes in a short time, his mother is a rock of stability. Elaine Miller is able to &quot;freak out&quot; most people, with a few choice words but to her son, she is home, safety, love and in a way... imprisonment. She is very intense but caring and it is this combination which drives her eighteen year old daughter to a life of airline stewardship. We can see Elaine's true courage however, when she agrees to let the fifteen year old William go &quot;on the road&quot; with a drug taking,  womanizing rock band. This, after we have seen her characterize Simon and Garfuncle as &quot;stoned&quot; and forbidden their music from her house. <p>One of the most important people William comes into contact with, on his journey, is Penny Lane. She is a beautiful, glowing, perfectly permed young dryad who follows the bands and has a following of her own. Adamant that she is not a groupie, Penny has created a concept called &quot;Band Aids.&quot; Her subscribers refrain from sex with the performers in an effort to more truly embrace the pure experience. She talks a good game but in the end, she's just a young woman in love. The object of her affection is Russell Hammond, the lead guitarist and Zen-master for Stillwater. Her situation is complicated after William falls in love with her, at first sight. <p>Thus Alice enters Wonderland and many an adventure is had. Despite William's best intentions and the good advice of his mentor, Lester Bangs, the band manages to seduce him. His plan, to get in and out before missing a test, is soon discarded in the face of a larger than life rock and roll experience. There is one truly touching scene where the band, (and company), is riding their bus to the next gig and singing along to &quot;Tiny Dancer.&quot; William leans over to Penny and says, &quot;I have to go home!&quot; To which she replies, with a magical pass of her hand, &quot;You are home.&quot; That says it all. <p>There are several contrasting character changes happening during the film.  One stands out more than most. William starts his professional career as a fan, loving the band, the music and the whole lifestyle. As the tour progresses and his eyes are opened, he becomes, not jaded but more worldly, professional and wise. Conversely, Penny Lane is introduced to us as the epitome of sophistication. She is young but knowing, and handles William as an older sister might. As the film progresses we discover that Penny is not so all knowing as she seemed. She is just as fragile and naively hopeful as any other girl her age. In the end, it is William that has to send her a reality check. <p>Everything about this film is fascinating. The music is just wonderful, with Billy Crudup and Jason Lee bringing authenticity to every performance. The band's interpersonal dynamic is almost a character of its own. This climaxes during the famous plane crash scare, when each confesses their deepest secrets to the unrestrained laughter of the audience. William, his Mother and Penny are all unforgettable creations. Crowe is a wonderful writer, so good in fact, that I am disappointed he didn't turn this story into a book. Watching the movie will just have to be enough, for now.</p></br></body></html>

So many people I know - critics included - had poo-poohed the film as too silly and slow, or simply unworthy of the hype that surrounds it.  And though I'd gotten a few good reviews from friends, I never expected to laugh as much as I actually did, or even cry the couple of times I ended up doing so.  <p>This is a warm, sweet-as-apple-pie film, certain to warm the coldest hearts in your living rooms.  Maybe some folks couldn't bear to admit liking the film out of fear of bring pegged as soft or worse yet, stupid.  Well - I'm not the smartest guy out there, and it takes alot to make me sob openly during a movie, but &quot;Greek Wedding&quot; was a blast.  Aside from the romantic sparks between Vardalos and Corbett, anyone with a diverse and crazy family will appreciate the hysterical plot and zippy dialogue taken from some of life's most precious moments.  Vardalos manages to be both a witty comedienne and a gifted writer, with a knack for setting up inspired sequences of truth and humor the likes of which have been missing from most movies for eons.  I didn't expect much, but I got much more than a great time --- I saw myself and my family in these characters - cousings and parents, in-laws and booze-swilling patriarchs.  Laine Kazan is a showstopper, while Corbett;s parents are the epitome of upper East Side WHITE-dom.  A laugh-riot combination ensues when this family decides to throw the greek wedding to end all greek weddings...from frilly stupid bridesmaid dresses to bustier-busting cousins, this movie's got it all.<p>Congrats NIA - this is a hit of epic proportions.  Whether you're Latin like me, or Greek, or Irish, African-American, or French (OK, maybe not French), you're gonna love this flick!</p></br><a href="../users/A3QZCA4LTTVGAD.html">A3QZCA4LTTVGAD</a><br/><p>It's no surprise to me that "My Big Fat Greek Wedding," directed by Joel Zwick, has become one of the biggest, fattest crowd-pleasing movie hits of 2002. This warm-hearted comedy stars Nia Vardalos (who also wrote the script) as Toula, a Greek-American woman who works in the family business. She falls in love with the WASP-y Ian Miller (a very charming John Corbett). Can true love conquer the cultural differences between their two worlds?<p>As someone who comes from a half-Italian, half-Puerto Rican heritage, I can tell you that I could relate to this story 100%. While grounded in the specifics of Greek-American life, the story handles this theme in a way which I believe has universal appeal.<p>Vardalos and Corbett are part of a superb ensemble cast that includes Michael Constantine, Lainie Kazan, and Andrea Martin. These last three in particular do a great job in creating characters that are hilariously outrageous, yet very human and loveable. The humor in the film is an effective blend of silly slapstick, uproarious sight gags, and character-driven humor.<p>"Wedding" is a film about dealing with a sometimes embarrassing extended family, having pride in your heritage, and reaching across ethnic lines to find romantic love. It's a wonderful film that I recommend to viewers of all ethnic backgrounds!</p></br><a href="../users/AD2BIAIH78QI5.html">AD2BIAIH78QI5</a><br/><p>Since this movie looked so good in the coming attractions, off I went to see it asap. VERY funny! It's a sort of "Moonstruck" about Greek-Americans--folk ways and family relationships exhibited for all to see. <p>Toula has always been self-concious about her Greek heritage, but can't seem to find a way out. She lives at home and works in the family restaurant, Dancing Zorba. Both her aunt (Angela Martin) and her mother (Lanie Kazan)are flamboyant women making vats of food. Michael Constantine is a stand-out as the father who believes that any cut can be treated with Windex (I thought it was very funny that no matter where you looked in the house, there was a bottle of Windex lurking somewhere). And then, out of the blue, into Toula's life comes Ian Miller, a sort of lite Kevin Sorbo. In time, she bucks her father's resistance and takes a computer class at a nearby college, and before you know it, in go the contact lenses and on come the lots more attractive wardrobe, so that the next time she sees that Ian guy, she's prepared. From there, you can figure out what going to happen: after all, it IS called "My Big Fat Greek Wedding", isn't it?  <p>My only criticism about the movie would be its lack of conflict. I kept expecting Toula to have a fight with her fiance Ian, but this never happened. I mean, even Liz Taylor had a fight with her fiance in "Father of the Bride"! <p>But that's a relatively small quibble for such a funny movie. Go take in "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" and have yourself a good laugh.</p></br><a href="../users/A356HRZZFCEGL1.html">A356HRZZFCEGL1</a><br/><p>My name is John Panagopoulos.<br /><br />Yes, my last name is Greek and I am Greek, Greek Orthodox to be exact.<br /><br />Yeah, my name is long (many Greek surnames are quite longer), but not that hard to pronounce.<br /><br />Parse it into syllables and say it slowly....<br /><br />Pa - na - gop (hard g, like "gus")- ou - los.<br /><br />Now that wasn't so difficult was it?<br /><br />Like many other ethnic groups, Greeks have endured their slings and brickbats of outrageous prejudice, stereotyping, and even general indifference. I believe many consider Greeks the evolutionary equivalent of paramecia. But I am not here to bewail Greek ethnic suffering, but to praise "My Big Fat Greek Wedding", a movie I took my fairly conservative but reasonable Greek parents to see. I honestly confess I laughed uproariously and continually throughout the movie. To non-Greeks, Toula's Greek universe may seem cartoonish, surreal, and even outrageously "sitcommy". Perhaps, but the exaggeration is only slight. I assure you the Greek beliefs, mannerisms, characteristics, and ideosyncrasies the game cast manifests on the screen do exist indeed. Tia Vardalos manages to satirize, lampoon, and skewer a vast variety of Greek life elements. Yet, she is not vicious, mean-spirited, or self-loathing. For all the guffaws, frenetic pacing, and boisterous interaction of the huge cast, "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" graciously and generously reveals the sweet heart and humanity of her extended exasperating family. As the clich&eacute; goes, I laughed a lot with recognition and cried a little with recognition.<br /><br />It is pointless to rehash the admittedly derivative plot: it's a pastiche (this is the Greek word for "casserole" by the way, as Toulas irascible father would say) of "Romeo and Juliet", "Father of the Bride", "Only the Lonely" and every "ugly duckling", "coming of age", "class warfare" and "crazy ethnic" movie you can conceive. But who cares? The movie is achingly funny, people, for both Greeks and non-Greeks. I would recommend all families - ESPECIALLY Greek families- to see this hilarious farce. They will be pleasantly shocked by how true to Greek life it gets. "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" serves as a concise but comprehensive primer to Greeks in general. If you're not careful, you may learn something about us kooky, overlooked Greeks.<br /><br />Not once was I bored with this delightful movie. No one is an irredeemable villain in this movie, not even the obvious target of the chauvinistic patriarch, who only really wants his family to be happy. Everybody is flawed, but everybody also has their worth. Each actor/actress in the film was an unfettered joy to behold, and contributes admirably to the overall effect of a wonderful slice of precious ethnicity.<br /><br />Apart from two anatomy jokes a couple of Greek cousins trick Ian Miller, Toula's beau, into uttering in Greek, the movie is not profane, depraved, or crude. This is a family movie in every sense of the world.  It's safe to bring the kids.<br /><br />My commentary could easily extend into a surgical dissertation of every joke, character, plot device, and theme this celluloid cornucopia abundantly provides. But I will conclude with a paraphrasing of the theme the Greek patriach (Michael Constantine - a real Greek) hilariously and touchingly enunciates: The world is more than a melting pot. It is a fruit basket where apples (Millers) and oranges (Portokaloses) must and can happily live together with warmth, mutual respect, and happiness.<br /><br />Yes, I bought the DVD.<br /><br />P.S.: I almost forgot; my parents loved the movie too, though they were still a bit disappointed about Greeks marrying "xeni (non-Greek stranger)", though they admit that it is all but inevitable. In fact, my mom thought the "xenos" elements was even a bit dated; more and more, Greeks are marrying non-Greeks.</p></br><a href="../users/A1C58YXM2A30CY.html">A1C58YXM2A30CY</a><br/><p>My Big Fat Greek Wedding was quite the romantic comedy and yet was disappointing in other areas.<br /><br />We have a nerdy, unkempt daughter of a Greek man [Nia Vardalos, who also wrote the screenplay] with a massive personality and belonging to a large Greek family.  She never fit in and rejected what was expected of her (marry Greek, have lots of Greek kids, be a mom) but seemed to blame it all on her family.<br /><br />Her family is quirky to say the least.  They're loud, happy and excitable.  She is so "not that" that she is introverted and unhappy most of the time.  She feels trapped and no way out.<br /><br />This part of the story was a bit annoying to me.  I too am Greek and have a large family but we never embraced the traditions of a Greek family as the main character does.  If anything I think I would have enjoyed going to Greek school.<br /><br />Finally she realizes that she can do something about it and goes to college to learn computers (over her father's objections) and gets a job at her aunt's travel agency and makes it work.<br /><br />At the same time she is completely frozen by the entrance of a man in her life.  He's not Greek, her father rejects him, but she falls completely in love and can't help herself.<br /><br />The plot is a bit predictable at this point with the man doing whatever he can to ingratiate himself into her big Greek family.  He on the other hand has a small, quiet family and his parents have a rough time with them - they want a country club wedding, quiet with a few guests - what they get is a big party!<br /><br />Most of the humor comes from the clash of cultures (spitting on someone for good luck --- I have to try that on my family, LOL) and of the woman realizing that she need not be ashamed of her heritage and completely reject it - that she can accept her big Greek family and be independent at the same time.<br /><br />It all works.  Recommended, especially if you have a wild and crazy southern European family.  According to Wiki, this was the highest grossing romantic comedy that never hit big in theaters.<br /><br />Cast!<br /><br />Directed by Joel Zwick<br /><br />Produced by Gary Goetzman<br />Tom Hanks<br />Rita Wilson<br /><br />Written by Nia Vardalos<br /><br />Starring John Corbett<br />Nia Vardalos<br />Lainie Kazan<br />Michael Constantine<br />Ian Gomez<br />Arielle Sugarman<br />Stavroula Logothettis<br />Gia Carides<br />Andrea Martin<br />Louis Mandylor<br />Jayne Eastwood<br /><br />Other Films with Nia Vardalos:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0021L8UO4">My Life in Ruins</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002U1LGTQ">I Hate Valentine's Day (Ws)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000CGNEF">My Big Fat Greek Life - The Entire Series</a></p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>Toula Portokalos is 30, Greek, and works in her family's restaurant, Dancing Zorba's, in Chicago. All her father Gus wants is for her to get married to a nice Greek boy. But Toula is looking for more in life. Her mother convinces Gus to let her take some computer classes at college making him think it's his idea. With those classes under her belt, she then takes over her aunt's travel agency again making her father think it's his idea. She meets Ian Miller, a high school English teacher, WASP, and dreamboat she had made a fool of herself over at the restaurant; they date secretly for a while before her family finds out. Her father is livid over her dating a non-Greek. He has to learn to accept Ian; Ian has to learn to accept Toula's huge family, and Toula has to learn to accept herself. "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" is a wholesome and very enjoyable movie, with a lot of funny moments, that the whole family can enjoy.</p></br><a href="../users/A39IY0JU5JI69G.html">A39IY0JU5JI69G</a><br/><p>I didn't see this film when it was in the theaters, in spite of rave reviews.  It seemed to be a pretty obvious story which didn't interest me.<br />Recently I picked it up at the library (for free) and, to my surprise, I found it genuinely heartwarming and entertaining.<br /><br />As others have mentioned, it is sort of a re-hash of Moonstruck, and it isn't as well done.  And yes be prepared for a lot of ethnic stereotypes--the loud Greeks with the garish taste as well as the uptight WASPS. And yes, we know from the opening scene what's going to happen.  I think that the reason the movie overcomes these flaws is the overwhelming love in it.  You can tell that it's a real story and that's what lifts it up from cliche to something genuinely touching.<br /><br />The script is smart and funny.  It moves fast.  And the cast is first rate. To some, the idea that the very homely 30-ish girl in the restaurant would stand a chance with the superbly hunky Ian Miller (played by the irrestable John Corbett) seems impossible.  But the actress is so funny, so real, and so smart, that she really does have enormous appeal.<br /><br />I am always happy to see the wonderful Laine Kazan, who makes every scene a heartwarmer.  The fellow who played the dad is perfect, too, as are all of the others.  I particulary loved the gramma!<br /><br />I recently saw Monsoon Wedding, which was also lauded and can be compared in many ways to this film.  But Monsoon Wedding nowhere touched the genuineness of this work.<br /><br />It's not the most artfully impressive film ever made, but, like the big fat family (including the newcomer,) it has plenty of heart...and that's worth a lot!</p></br><a href="../users/AJMU8VVFKMZI4.html">AJMU8VVFKMZI4</a><br/><p>4.5 stars.  One of my favorites-mainly because I'm a sucker for good romance movies-the cheesier, the better.  Vardalos, in my humble opinion, was very brave to go on camera without her makeup.  This movie gave hope to a lot of plain Janes when Toula captured the heart of Ian. (John Corbett from Sex and the City Fame).  Her loud, overbearing and obnoxious family are adorable in their own way.  Overall, highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HWD9PTM7RBXN.html">A2HWD9PTM7RBXN</a><br/><p>My Big Fat Greek Wedding is a light hearted movie that touches on good family values.  Toula, a low key conservative woman works in her family's Greek restaurant but yearns to find some happiness on her own.  She takes computer classes which gives her an opportunity to do more meaningful work as a travel agent within her aunt's company.<br /><br />At this point, Toula allows herself to be romanced by Ian, a free spirited teacher.  The fireworks really begin to fly when Toula's family find out about this secret romance.  The outlandish characters in the film particularly Toula's borther and father are quite amusing.  Its charming to listen to the father's ravings.  However in the end good family's stick together and true love conquers all.  Ian happilly adapts to his wife's family and Gus(father of the bride) gives into his daughter's wishes.  After all, apples and oranges are both fruits, right?<br /><br />Some audiences may be put off by the excessive stereotypical greek behavior.  However, I say what is wrong with celebrating the pride in one's enthnicity?  Two thumbs up from me on this delightful romantic comedy.</p></br><a href="../users/ATS7LYGLUX34L.html">ATS7LYGLUX34L</a><br/><p>I'll make this short & sweet: My Big Fat Greek Wedding is a laugh riot, and coming from a large Italian family, very realistic! Writer Nia Vardalos stars as a love-starved greek-American girl who meets the man of her dreams (John Corbett)....But he's not Greek, so how to reconcile her plans for the future with her Parent's plans for her?<p>  The cast is great, especially the Windex-spraying Dad, and the Movie is a winner from start to finish. Highly recommended!</p></br><a href="../users/AS7B4W4KOPQNV.html">AS7B4W4KOPQNV</a><br/><p>I liked this movie a lot, and I felt sympathetic to all the characters, which is rare for me.  This film was about a woman, Toula, who grew up in a very Greek family.  Toula's father is always pressuring her to get married to a Greek and he tells her that she looks old all the time.  Later on, Toula gets a make-over and a good job, which lands her a great boyfriend, Ian.  However, Ian is not Greek, which causes many problems for Toula at home.  I found this movie to be hilarious, and it was so funny how the father always sprayed windex on things, thinking it could cure anything.  You should go see it if you haven't already.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B7BUH8834Y6M.html">A2B7BUH8834Y6M</a><br/><p>This movie definitely received a lot of hype - but for good reason. A relatively unknown comedienne was discovered by Rita Wilson (actress and wife of Tom Hanks) and her story was put on film - and it starred the unknown comic, not some Hollywood-type, plastic person.  You do not have to be Greek to enjoy this film. The main character (Toula, played by creator/author Nia Vardalos) is growing up as a chubby, hairy, lonely girl in a very Greek, very large home with very eccentric relatives. Her family holds fast to strong family values and unlike all too many families today, they hold strongly to their ethnic traditions.<p>Vardalos tells the story of her life, her loving & nutty family and how she made the decision to change her appearance, education and attitude at age 30 to pursue her dreams. From her father's love of his own Greek heritage to his obsession with the miracle healing powers of Windex, the viewer will quickly fall in love with these quirky characters, warts and all.<p>Despite some deeply held biases, her family is very loving, if not over-protective. When they find out she has been dating a non-Greek man, they go bonkers... but they come around and grow to love their soon-to-be son-in-law.<p>The movie is less about the wedding and more about the family... the positives and negatives of growing up in a big, loud, loving family and how true love conquers all. Best of all, this is based on the true life story of lead actress Nia Vardalos.<p>Her real life husband portrays the friend/colleague of her husband in the film and many of her own relatives made cameos through out.<p>Great acting, great comedic timing and an over-all feel-good film. Family safe? That depends. It is definitely implied that the lead characters have a less than platonic relationship before they are married, but there are no [love] scenes and no nudity in  the film. It's up to the parents to decide what age is appropriate for their kids on this one. A really young child may not appreciate what is going on, but anyone 12 and up should get a kick out of this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK.html">A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK</a><br/><p>It seems like it's harder and harder for the film industry to come up with something original.  In many cases you can point to a film and list multiple movies in the same genre, and often the current movie is either a direct remake or a thinly veiled remake.  Not so with "My Big Fat Greek Wedding".<p>Nia Vardalos plays Toula Portokalos, a rather frumpy Greek-American.  Her family is somewhat stereotypical.  However, the stereotype, while extreme, is within the realm of truth.  Have been involved deeply with people from other countries, I have observed that quite often they see everything in terms of their own nation.  What Gus Portokalos has on his garage door is hilarious, as one example.<p>Toula is 30 years old, and single; a near death sentence in her Greek family where woman are expected to marry young, feed everyone, and make more Greek babies (according to Toula).  While working as a "seating hostess" in her father's restaurant, she meets Ian Miller, played by John Corbett.  The sparks begin to fly almost immediately.  After several creative scenes, Ian and Toula finally date, and quickly grow to love each other.<p>Toula's family is a riot.  Because her family is very large, and very close, her extended family includes dozens of members.  The two characters that stood out in my mind are Michael Constantine as Gus Portokalos, and Andrea Martin (of the long-defunct SCTV) as Aunt Voula.  There are other actors you might recognize, but virtually every scene with Aunt Voula was funny, and Gus Portokalos as the supposed head of the family was easily manipulated by the real heads of the family, the women, making many of his scenes very funny.<p>This movie is not the slapstick buffoonery we see in other contemporary comedies such as those by Eddie Murphy.  Here the humor is the contrast between the too pure-white, upper middle class, and small family of Ian Miller and the richly patriotic, ethnically cohesive, and large family of Toula Portokalos.  The Millers are overwhelmed by Toula's huge and relatively bizarre family.  For example, the Portokalos hold an outdoor barbecue on their front lawn with hundreds of people.  Whatever would the neighbors think would be the typical reaction of many people in many middle class neighborhoods.  The Portokalos interpret (or try) everything the Millers do by their own standard.  Both families are clueless regarding the other, and our objective view of both families give us the opportunity to find the humor in how little each knows about the other.<p>Ian finds Toula to be interesting.  Similarly, Toula finds something about Ian interesting.  Each feels that the other offers something different.  That difference is multiple, in terms of lifestyle, personality and expectations.  The viewer should not expect Toula to become Cinderella.  She does not and can not, and Ian is not looking for Cinderella.  In fact, Ian may be looking for non-Cinderella.  However, she is Ian's princess, and that's what truly counts.<p>I particularly enjoyed the ending of the movie.  There is a point as the movie nears the end where we realize that while the differences between the families and the lifestyles are large, ultimately both families have common interests.  For me that key moment pulled the whole movie together, explaining that the point of the movie, after highlighting the differences between the characters and their families, was that we all pretty much want and like the same or similar things.  Because I was personally touched by this moment, I'll let the viewers see for themselves what that moment might be, which may be different for them.<p>This movie is not a wildly hilarious slapstick comedy.  Instead, its humor is unabashedly ethnic-based.  However, its stereotypes are not generally derogatory, any more so than those of say, "National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation" with Chevy Chase.  But this movie will make you smile, and the touching moments will make you feel good.  An intelligent movie that relies on simple story-telling, this movie deserved the accolades it received, and earns a 5-star rating.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IO3LVYV5ZMK8.html">A1IO3LVYV5ZMK8</a><br/><p>What exactly did producers Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson see in this romantic comedy written and co-starring Nia Viadalos? The answer can also be simultaneously found in this sleeper hit which grossed more than 200 million in the U.S box office with a growing audience. This low-budget vehicle could have been a slapstick perfunctory sitcom outing if not for the spontaneity and sincerity when Ms. Vardalos regards her rambunctious Greek family. Exuding down-to-earth appeals as Tulas, she narrates her troubles with the family when she falls in love with a vegetarian WASP Ian Miller (John Corbett). The ensemble of the supporting casts fill the shoes of her extensive relatives which includes 27 cousins as well as a complaining aunt. They give shades of warmth and compassion to break free of their stereotypical mold - and Ms. Vardalos knows them so well that this becomes a joyous celebration of kinship as well as love.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TWTULVD6F22O.html">A1TWTULVD6F22O</a><br/><p>Sure, "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" is not a cinematic event...the plot has virtually no serious conflict, and the movie is really a series of gags built on one delightful theme...the craziness of ethnic families, proud of their heritage.<p>Rita Wilson, with help from husband Tom Hanks, engineered the making of this film.  From a biographical original screenplay by Nia Vardalos, who plays herself in the film, as Toulah, the ugly duckling daughter of a boisterous Greek family, Wilson got the film made with an original limited release to only a few screens in major cities.  Audience reaction caused the studio to think again, and remarket it to all theaters.  MBFGW will be one of the few films that survives the whole summer on the big screen.<p>Vardalos has crafted a plot and sight and sound gags that keep you chuckling throughout the film.  Add to the mix John Corbett, every woman in America's dream man since he played Aidan in "Sex and the City", and you've got a winner.<p>I was exceptionally happy to see the wonderful Michael Constantine and Laine Kazan, small screen performers of old, in terrific new roles, and terrifically funny!  Andrea Martin - the zany alumnus of Saturday Night Live, gets lots of laughs as the crazy aunt.  My favorite site gag in the movie, however, is the repetitive shots of the front of Toulah's home, complete with carefully placed Greek statuary.<p>There've not been many quirky, feel good films to rival MBFGW in recent years.  Go see it and celebrate your own crazy family!</p></br><a href="../users/A18M68DE1Y6W51.html">A18M68DE1Y6W51</a><br/><p>I love it when a sleeper of a movie like this one soars to prominence based on word-of-mouth. This little gem deserves every kudo it gets, and then some.<p>Refreshingly normal-looking Nia Vardalos basically plays herself in a script she wrote from memories of her own Greek-American upbringing. Maybe that is why the movie comes across as so real and so heartwarming. At any rate, Vardalos plays Toula, a 30-year-old spinster (in her traditional father's eyes) who helps run the family's restaurant, the Dancing Zorba. Hidden behind thick glasses, baggy sweaters and too much hair, Toula is miserable. She loves her family, but she wants to find her own niche in the world--without giving Papa a heart attack.<p>After much high emotion, Toula improves her looks, goes back to school, snags a job in her aunt's travel agency (after all, reasons Papa, it's still family) and meets the man of her dreams (gorgeous John Corbett, "Aidan" from "Sex and the City"). Everything should be happy, no? NO! Ian (the boyfriend) is NOT GREEK, and Papa is beside himself.<p>This movie is simply a delight, from the opening credits to the very end. It is unpretentious, warm, loving, and happy. And on top of all that, it's truly well-acted and very, very funny. I recommend it highly.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GA2SO3YK6CXI.html">A2GA2SO3YK6CXI</a><br/><p>May 5th, 2007. Alessandra Prado, Alex Ariano and I visited Martha Oliva who is at home recuperating from foot problems and we brought her this DVD to watch as a group... the best medicine available...  for this movie is a rare treasure of endearing fun... which applies to any cross cultural relationships!!!<br /><br />The plot is simple, a young Greek woman, still living with her parents at the age of 30, under a domineering father who tells her she is "looking old" and not yet married, falls in love with a rather handsome University professor, who does not share her heritage, her sense of belonging to a large family, or her cultural identity.<br /><br />Toula Portokalos, played by Nia Vardalos, works as a waitress in her family's Greek restaurant, "Dancing Zorba's" and one day sees the handsome Ian Miller come in to meet one of his friends and she falls in love at first sight. She is entranced by his sight, he notices her, but she can not believe it possible.<br /><br />Toula is inspired to look for more out of life and enrolls in PC classes at the University, the dialogue of her parents as they decide whether a "woman should be educated" or not, is simply some of the funniest lines ever!!!<br /><br />As she excels at the required courses to run an efficient travel agency, Toula, with the help of her encouraging mother, convinces her aunt that she should go and work for her... They sit to tell the father... or was it the father's idea that she should go to work at the travel agency?<br /><br />The day Ian Miller, played by John Corbett, happens to walk by her place of employment provides some of the funniest clips of this film, which keeps you laughing from beginning to end!<br /><br />The couple begin an endearing romance, one that we thoroughly enjoy as it develops into a beautiful love affair. But... beware! The family finds out and the father is livid at this WASP [White Anglo Saxon Protestant] moving into Greek territory, something unheard of in the tradition of this lovely Greek family.<br /><br />As the families start to get to know one another, some of the scenes are so funny that we laugh to our hearts content. Being Cuban American, many of the scenes remind us of our own struggle to bring different cultures together as we have weaved the fabric of our families with many other cultural threads.<br /><br />During the film we admire the way Toula transforms from a quiet, introverted and shy person into a rather sophisticated young woman. The wedding entrance has one of the most memorable scenes as the Greeks overwhelm the bride side of the guests... doing what is culturally correct to bring good luck to the bride... causing revulsion and shock to the American side of this couple.<br /><br />Simply... don't miss seeing this film... By now we have seen it 6 or 7 times and we find ourselves enchanted and constantly laughing. Indeed a rare treasure and a MOST own DVD!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A2YXMN40D7WTGP.html">A2YXMN40D7WTGP</a><br/><p>This isn't really a review of the movie, but how I feel the issues in the movie relate to real life situations....Many people think this movie is stereotypical or fake. I think many who are in multicultural relationships would disagree....<br /><br />The commercial for this movie does something interesting. When displaying the title at the end of the commercial, the title switches from Italian to Chinese to Indian, among other cultures. This is relevant because I think the topics and feeling that both the main character and the parents go through is pretty much universal.<br /><br />I guess you would have to be apart of this immigrant culture to understand this. My female cousins, all Orientals, married outside their cultural group (Polish, Scottish, Italian, Argentinian, Irish, etc.) and they all went through this. After listening to my parents, it looks like my aunts and uncles who had to deal with the foreign sons-in-laws and in-laws, also had it tough and many of them complained to their daughters on why they couldn't find a nice Asian male.<br /><br />Toula is a character that seems real to me, because I have friends that are in the same boat. A friend of mine, a high powered lawyer, whose parents are Russian, is scared to death to tell her parents that her love of her life is Jewish. Another friend who is 2nd generation South African has a boyfriend who is Honduran and she feels that their relationship would kill her parents. Immigrant parents want their children to marry within their own cultural groups and it is hard for them to understand why they would go outside their culture when there are so many good Greek/Italian/Indian/WHATEVER guys that are available (at least to what they think).<br /><br />Toula is a homely girl and lacks self-confidence because her whole life has been about rejecting her culture. She sees that all the pretty girls are WASPY, slim and blonde, while she is the complete opposite and this has hurt her perspective of life. However, for some reason, she wants to break out of the mold and improve herself, not to find a guy but to live her life her own way.<br /><br />Of course, her parents do not see this, all she needs to do is to follow her advice and she should be happy right? This is the dilemma that many 1st/2nd generation people fall under, it is the New World/Old World conflict that many of us (including guys) can relate to.<br /><br />She falls for a WASPY guy and he turns out to be nice and kind, he seems to have no bad traits. While many people may scoff at this, I also find that that men (especially my cousins-in-law) who date women outside their cultures, often have more patience and are more willing to accept a second culture than other guys. I don't really see it as much in women in my experience. However, as a movie-going experience, it may come across as pretty boring.<br /><br />The secondary characters are a hoot, if not a little cartoony. Aunt Voola is played up by Andrea Martin and she has a blast playing the matter of fact aunt. Martin Constantine also does a magnificent job as Gus, Toula's father. He is stubborn and scary for Toula, but all he seems to want is to be told of stuff and have things done the right way (a funny exchange comes when Gus doesn't understand why Ian didn't ask her to go out with Toula and Ian doesn't understand why he would have to ask since she's 30 years old--A funny clash of cultures).<br /><br />But the best is Maria, played by Lainie Kazan. She may be a little kooky, but she always is wise and knows what to say to make things right. She had my mother nodding in agreement throughout the whole movie when I showed it to her. Other characters like her sister, brother and cousins are merely time-fillers and have little purpose IMO.<br /><br />Another set of characters that seem to be stereotyped is Ian's parents. I have met alot of ignorant WASP parents, but they seem to be charactiatures of Nia Vardalos' vision of what WASP parents are like.<br /><br />So overall, I find that MBFGW to be more about real-life than about Hollywood romantic storytelling. In most movies, people meet, hook up, get engaged and get married. Opposed to movies like "How to lose a guy in 10 minutes" which has to go through a whole complicated plotline for people to fall in love. The reason why so many people watched this movie is because they could relate to the nature of this relationship and the issues that it brings. It's about a pretty homely woman who fixes herself out to turn into a regular (if not pretty) girl. She isn't a knockout, but she is interesting and different and for Ian (BTW: her real husband Ian is Mike the teacher in the movie) that is a marrying woman....Rating: B+</p></br><a href="../users/A29COAL60SB48B.html">A29COAL60SB48B</a><br/><p>Nia Vardalos's script bit into the stereotypes but it managed to not be stereotypical at the same time.<br /><br />The movie is about culture and ethnic identity, something that Americans were taught since Day One to reject because we're all supposed to be part of the big "melting pot."  It's the main reason why the majority of the folks who put this movie down here just don't get it.<br /><br />Too bad people couldn't pay attention to the beautiful and timeless Greek traditions that Toula explained in the movie and the fact that even though she was marrying outside of her ethnic group, her family supported her decision (begrudgingly) and not only gave her a beautiful wedding (in a Greek Orthodox church) but her father managed to put his feelings aside and buy his daughter and her new husband a house (even if it happened to be right next door).<br /><br />I guess, in the end, you have to be Greek (which I'm part, through my Italian side) or be a Greek-lover to understand and truly appreciate this movie.<br /><br />Thumbs up to Nia for an original script and a beautiful movie (and for casting extra cute John Corbett as the non-Greek husband).</p></br><a href="../users/A3KB1H0S7T6JX1.html">A3KB1H0S7T6JX1</a><br/><p>Definitely an outstanding comedy and one of my personal favorites, My Big Fat Greek Wedding, brings to the screen the story of Toula Portokalos, a 30-year old Greek-American from Chicago, played superbly by Nia Vardalos.  She falls in love with Ian, (played by John Corbett-and a wonderful performance it is) and that is when their problems begin as Ian goes through the culture shock that comes with marrying into a Greek family.  All the actors, no exceptions, give it their 100% and it shows! Very well written, very well presented, the movie is without a doubt a major hit world wide!  Needless to say people here in Greece are so proud over the success of the movie!</p></br><a href="../users/A2ODBHT4URXVXQ.html">A2ODBHT4URXVXQ</a><br/><p>Word of mouth carried this nifty big fat movie right up the popularity scales. Women rolling their eyes and swearing 'You've GOT to see it!' guaranteed a long run. Toula, so beautifully played by Nia Vardalos, seems destined to homely spinsterhood when she hits 30 - but she's far from resigned. It's her Old World papa who's the major road block. Mama, Toula, and auntie conspire to circumvent his strictures, and Toula goes to school - with a new hairdo, some new clothes, and too much makeup.<br />And falls in love with a WASP. And he falls for her. And of course they eventually get married, hence the title of the flick. But the process is the product, in this case, and the slow process of winning over her deeply ethnic family is the delight of this wonderful, hilarious, and ultimately compassionate film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GPEV42IO41CI.html">A2GPEV42IO41CI</a><br/><p>Nia Vardalos turned her stand-up comedy routine about her own Greek wedding into a fun, family movie. You don't have to be Greek to recognize the eccentric relatives in her family; her parents, siblings, aunts, uncles, and cousins all insist she marry one of her own kind and make babies. However, she falls for a non-Greek (John Corbett) and they make it work. The story follows her engagement, the wedding preparations, his religious conversion, and the wedding. She starts the movie looking like an ugly duckling, but love makes her beautiful, as well as happy.<p>Everyone has at least one relative like Nia's and you can laugh and cry with her. The humor is all clean and it's two hours of solid laughs. Surprisingly enjoyable.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TK6R2JSC97HL.html">A1TK6R2JSC97HL</a><br/><p>"My Big Fat Greek Wedding" is an enjoyable romp about the ethnic eccentricities of a young woman's (Nia Vardelos) family brought to painfully funny light when she marries outside of her Greek community.  It's a thin plot, an excuse to show off its ethnic characters, but it does so hilariously well.  Although there isn't anything about the Portokalos family that we haven't hasn't seen before (the mischievous brothers who pull merciless pranks on their sister's clueless suitors; the compulsion to include three generations of cousins in the immediate family; being devoutly religious; blatant male chauvinism that brands daughters as failures if they aren't mothers by 30, while sons can be bachelors well past that age; that the men cling so tightly to their power, they don't realize how women outmaneauver them with their guile; how women are expected to do only three things - marry Greek men, cook Greek food and bear Greek children), the script has a lot fun playing it to the hilt.  Toula is about 30 and unmarried - not even her family hides how they've given up on her.  Working in her father's caf&eacute;, Toula looks like a premature frump when the story starts (flat hair and glasses that look like they belong on a 9-year old).  Her father is played over the top as a man more Greek than Zeus, Hercules and Zorba rolled up (in a small suburb of tastefully modest houses, the Portokalos home was renovated to suggest the Parthenon, arrayed with columns, statues of the gods and a garage door painted according to the Greek flag; Mr. Portokalos relentlessly challenges others to dream up words that aren't somehow etymologically based on Greek; in case we haven't realized that Papa Portokalos had his roots as a character in some stand-up routine, the script has him toting a bottle of Windex, convinced that it can cure anything from minor burns to psoriasis).  With the help of her mother (Lainie Kazan) and a cooperative aunt (Andrea Martin in another of the flick's over-the-top performances) Toula breaks out of her shell and builds a career for herself.  Remaking herself (her hair and clothes, and swapping her glasses for contacts) Toula falls in love with a teacher (John Corbett from "Sex and the City") and manages to sell him and her family on each other.  While suggesting the ethnic clashes, the film remains breathlessly optimistic, and your face will hurt from repeated laughter.  Wise, knowing and fun, the script and the characters are good enough to compensate for its foibles (yes, somebody does utter the line "it's all Greek to me", but not until the near end of the flick; though set in and near a Greek caf&eacute; in Chicago, nobody ever says "chee-boiga, chee-boiga; chip, chip, chip).  In short, a lot of fun.</p></br><a href="../users/A267IXCC7UK1HY.html">A267IXCC7UK1HY</a><br/><p>The idea is, i suppose, to celebrate the way love brings together families from different ethnic backgrounds. The children go along tolerantly with the domineering Greek family, and this is supposed to warm our hearts. But somehow this strikes me as a single-joke comedy, and the joke in itself is not hilarious--unless you are a Greek EXTREMELY attached to Greek traditions.</p></br><a href="../users/A370Z6I5GBWU44.html">A370Z6I5GBWU44</a><br/><p>Oh goodness, I have seen this movie several times and it never gets old. The writing is fun, and the acting is absolutely superb! I especially liked the actress that played Toula's mother, and her saying of how the man is the head, but the woman is the neck and the head cannot turn without the neck is classic and a refreshing attitude to hear from a woman. There's lots of funny situations as Toula's fiance has to contend with her (huge) family. It is more of a 'chick flick' for people who like sports movies or movies with lots of guns and explosions, but it truly is a memorable and fantastic film that never gets old.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>This is a film that occupies the rarified air of being hard to dislike.  Comic ground isn't broke here but writer-star Nia Vardalos is such an engaging personality that you tend to overlook that.  Explain, however, the phenomenon that this movie was in 2002.  I was dating a Cuban lady that summer and she related to film because of it's portrayal of a tight-knit ethnic family.  At the time I didn't really understand.  Since then I've married into a tight-knit Polish American family and after many plates of kielbasi, pierogies, and gallons of borscht I get it.  All I have to say is that Ian (John Corbett) is one patient dude.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L43KWWR05PCS.html">A1L43KWWR05PCS</a><br/><p>This is a warmly funny, down to earth, one note comedy in which I was somewhat disappointed. The reality of it simply did not live up to its media hype. Still, I found this fairly formulaic, romantic comedy to be enjoyable, light-hearted fare to be taken at face value.<br /><br />The film centers around Toula Portokalos (Nia Vardalos), who comes from a fiercely ethno-centric, clannish, Greek family whose Greekness is the end-all, be-all of their lives. Toula is an over thirty, plain Jane, who lives at home with her overly protective mother, Maria (Lainie Kazan), and father, Gus (Michael Constantine), as well as her brother, Nick (Louis Mandylor). She works in her family's coffee shop where she seems to be sleep-walking through life. One day a handsome man, Ian Miller (John Corbett), enters the coffee shop with a friend, and she is smitten. Shortly thereafter, Toula embarks on a life changing course.<br /><br />She takes college courses. She undergoes a complete physical makeover, from the way she dresses to the way she carries herself. She even changes jobs, working at her aunt's travel agency. There, she chances to see her dream man again. They meet. They date. They fall in love. She does all this behind her family's back, as Ian is not Greek. When her family finds out, all hell breaks loose, as her parents parade a host of Greek losers for Toula in hopes that she will not break with tradition.<br /><br />Needless to say, Toula and Ian stick together despite family opposition, hers and his. His family finds her family appalling. Her family finds his family strait-laced and humorless. Never the twain shall meet. Still, the marriage will go on, and Toula's family completely commandeers the wedding, as they will have it done no other way than their way, that is to say, the Greek way. There are many funny, priceless moments throughout the film. Gus, the father, is particularly funny with his belief that all words are of Greek origin and his belief that a spritz of Windex will cure anything. Maria, the mother, also has her zany moments.<br /><br />Nia Vardalos, who is Greek, wrote the script, and she is right on the money. Living in New York, I have had many Greek friends over the years, and many Greeks of the older generation are as ethno-centric as those portrayed in the movie. There was a ring of truth in many of the jokes that hit home. As an actress, however, she leaves a lot to be desired. I found her to be unappealing and somewhat wooden in the role of Toula.<br /><br />The film is an over-hyped, cute, one note comedy that will not prevail over time. The film was recently put to the test when it became a sit-com of the same name with the original movie cast, with the exception of John Corbett (who had his own series "Lucky"). Needless to say, the sit-com did not last out the season. One note comedies rarely do. Still, this film is worth a rental, as it will certainly provide some laughs.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EUG9W2IAVCT.html">A2EUG9W2IAVCT</a><br/><p>Nia Vardalos certainly is a new queen of comedy as pictured in her self-written film My Big Fat Greek Wedding.  Funny, hilarious.  AWESOME!</p></br><a href="../users/AMG2LF8MLUDN1.html">AMG2LF8MLUDN1</a><br/><p>A suprise hit.  The author and star on this movie hits the nail right on the head.  She's 30, her family sees her as over the hill, her father is overbearing, her mother overfeeds her, and she's at her wits end.  The story is totally believable and why shouldn't it be?  Nia Vardalos lived the story and lived to tell the tale. Vardalos stars as Toula Portokalos, a quiet, shy, insecure girl growing up Greek.  She wants to experience the outside world but her father won't have it.  When she finally does meet a man that has interest in her, her father goes nuts.  There can be no marriage because he's not Greek.  A tragedy!  There are a lot of laughs.  Especially when the Toula's cousin  reveals the bridesmaids dresses.<br /><br />By the way, look for Nia Vardalos' real life husband in the film.  He plays the groom's best friend.</p></br><a href="../users/A15MLF38WROSWU.html">A15MLF38WROSWU</a><br/><p>I really, really enjoyed this movie.  I don't know much about Greek culture, but I was able to relate to the topic anyway.  I have friends who are of other ethnic backgrounds who ran into the same problem the Toula did.  Falling in love with someone who is not of their culture, and the differences it can bring.  I really liked the comedic spin of this film.  I thought that Nia Vardalos did an incredible job using humor to show what it means to be a Greek American.<br /><br />Toula is in her 30's, single, and working in the family business.  She is under tremendous pressure to marry and have children by her traditional father.  Toula on the other hand has other plans that her father can't understand.  He cannot understand why she would want to return to school, and he is not into the who modern values thinking like she is.  Her mother wants her daughter to be happy, and understands what Toula wants.  Toula has a crush on Ian Miller(John Corbet of Sex and the City), and when a relationship forms, Toula has to come to terms with their differences, and come to terms with how her family will accept her handsome boyfriend.  When they get engaged, it's funny to watch how the groom's parents are besieged by Toula's large family and their customs.<br /><br />You do not have to be Greek to enjoy this movie.  I thought it was quite funny, and enjoyable.  I felt this movie deserved the hype it received.  Toula's father using Windex to cure all his ailments was funny.  Strange, but funny.  If you enjoy good comedies, you must watch this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A26BWRBPP4V2WF.html">A26BWRBPP4V2WF</a><br/><p>Nia Vardalos is a veteran comedienne from the Second City group in Chicago.  This film is a catharsis of sorts, as only a gifted comedienne can present: growing up as one of the few Greek girls in Winnepeg, surrounded by blonde Anglos and Ukrainians, she undoubtedly felt left out and turned to comedy to be accepted.<p>This film is beautifully performed and written.  Vardalos herself plays the heroine, Toula, who is painfully shy and somewhat downtrodden, living in the shadow of an older, &quot;perfect sister.&quot;  When she decides to make something of herself - by going to college and specialising in &quot;Computers in the Travel Industry,&quot; she is noticed by a typical white-bread American, Ian Miller.  The movie follows their courtship with special emphasis on the contrast between Toula's Greek and Ian's WASP families.  Of course, since this is a comedy, everything is exaggerated - Ian's parents are stiff and reserved to a fault, while Toula's house is filled with 50 relatives at any given time.  There is also some fun inter-generational humour, as Toula (and her brother) try to break free of the old-world mold of their parents.  Some of the funniest moments are Toula's father lamenting that her over-education led her astray (i.e. into the arms of a non-Greek).<p>Although such a description implies there is an undercurrent of racism (or, at least, ethnic chauvenism), the movie is never mean-spirited.  In fact, it's almost naive in its good-naturedness, in that everyone ends up getting along and the two families come together wonderfully.  If only real life were as life-affirming as this film!  It is family film in that it is funny, warm-hearted, and contains no unsuitable material, although I suspect younger children will find the plot boring and not get most of the jokes.<p>Unfortunately, this DVD version is not up to the standards of the film.  The commentary, mostly by Vardalos, is interesting and points out a number of true-to-life events that were incorporated into the film, in addition to pointing out various friends and family members that appear in the film.  However, there are no cut scenes, no documentaries, etc.  Worse still, there are something like 7 ads for other movies at the beginning of the film, that you have to manually skip - this is a sure-fire way to anger your audience before the film even starts.  Finally, on top of all that, the box promises both widescreen and pan-and-scan, but the disc I saw only seems to have P&amp;S, which I hate.  You only get to see 2/3 of the movie that way!</p></br><a href="../users/AZ5250G2U795I.html">AZ5250G2U795I</a><br/><p>This movie is absolutely WONDERFUL!  Being Swiss, I can honestly say I have very little experience with Greek Culture, and found myself wanting to hop the first boat to Athens by the end of watching it.<p>Vardolos has written a film that deftly celebrates love, family, and heritage.  It's difficult to throw these elements into a comedy without crossing the dangerous borderline of parody, and she does this beautifully.  You find yourself appreciating the nuances of this film's portayal of a culture you may not be familliar with because you see your own family in hers, no matter what the nationality.<p>And John Corrbett should just plan on a career as a romantic lead.  His Ian is the perfect man you would want for yourself, best friend, daughter, etc.  Corbett brings a 'dreamboat' presence that resonates with romantic honesty and charm, and he also manages to be 'everyguy.'  His character works because he never seems 'out of your league' perfect.<p>Michael Constantine is brilliant at Tula's father.  His Greek ethinicy is brilliantly conveyed in ecentricities that are actually more particular to fatherhood than Greek culture.<p>This is a wonderful little film that will make you long to fall in love if you haven't already, and make you appreciate who you love if you are in love.  You cannot miss with this film, and the DVD is a must own because you will just watch it too many times to justify rerental fees.</p></br><a href="../users/A27FR2C67JPDRS.html">A27FR2C67JPDRS</a><br/><p>I just saw "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" and I'm still smiling.  What a nice surprise!  This is the best romantic comedy I've seen in a good while.  The story centers around a young woman (played very sweetly by Nia Vardalos) who meets Mr. Right after making a change in her plain and uneventful life.  The chance she takes pays off and she wins the heart of a handsome professor (John Corbett of "Northern Exposure and recently "Sex in the City) that leads to a wedding proposal.  A good majority of the film follows the couple as she introduces him to the her huge Greek clan and he to his rather sedated parents.  Lanie Kazan and Michael Constantine are superb as her parents and Andrea Martin, as Aunt Voula, is a riot.  The chemistry between Vardalos and Corbett is real and very touching.

I don't know Nia Vardalos from Adam (or Eve), but I remember John Corbett from his role as Chris on _Northern Exposure_ -- and I've seen Lainie Kazan and Michael Constantine in scores of films over the year. And they were all pretty good. HOWEVER: This thing would have been a lot more believable if they had omitted the computers and Ian's SUV and set it in the mid-1950s instead of the late `90s. I find it *very* difficult to believe there could still be such an insular, inbred, hyper-ethnic extended family existing in urban America today, especially running a couple of successful businesses in a major city. The social equivalent here in south Louisiana would be the old Acadian families with a dozen kids, all of whom speak only Cajun French -- but they're virtually extinct, the subject of reminiscence. Any folks like that these days are *way* down the bayou, not living and working in a big city. Even my son's Vietnamese mother-in-law, who only arrived here to live with her daughter a couple of years, is nothing remotely like the black-clad, hunched mama from Greece. Yeah, I'm probably being too logical in evaluating what is in essence a fairy tale, but the lively writing aside, I had trouble keeping my eyebrows lowered.</p></br><a href="../users/ATS1HA5M3EPZ4.html">ATS1HA5M3EPZ4</a><br/><p>In a turn of events, My Big Fat Greek Wedding outlasted many films in the theaters and kept on going for some time.  With it's sweet and enduring lead character, Toula, many people can relate to the pressures of family and their demand for finding someone THEY, not you, find suitable.  Toula works in her families restaurant and as far as they know, she will be for the rest of her life.  They see her as an old maid and that she needs to get married soon or her life will be over.  She describes herself as 'Frumpgirl' and decides to finally do something about it when she is enamored by the handsome John Corbett, a nice (but non-Greek) guy who finds her just as appealing.  She cleans up her hair, gets contacts, looses weight...yada, yada.  When the two start dating later on, the doubt and frustration of knowing how her family will react starts to upset her.  But they move forward, defying her parents rejection and his parents ignorance.  The movie is very funny, very sweet and offers a lot of comfort in showing that many families in America, not just our own, are dealing with these cross culture issues and anti-old country behavior from their offspring.</p></br><a href="../users/A1YQ6QB2127AJ4.html">A1YQ6QB2127AJ4</a><br/><p>When I saw this movie in the theater, I almost peed my pants because of laughing so hard!

I especially liked the portrayal of the bunt cake.  If you watch it, you'll see what I'm talking about (can't give too much away).  There are many other scenes like it so you'll probably have your own that stick out as much as the bunt cake with me.

To its credit, Vardalos's screenplay doesn't go in for any contrived "boy-meets-girl-boy-loses-girl" nonsense.  Toula and Ian are clearly in love and I never doubted that they would get married.  The central tension of the film is how-not whether-her family will come to terms with it.

It never moves past the stereotypes it presents of a large, extended Greek family and the unlucky child to find herself living in the shadow of it.  A dream man (John Corbett) appears and soon Toula is remaking her life, much to the chagrin of her patronizing father. Michael Constatine turns in an amusing performance as the confused father of the bride, trying to figure out why his daughter would marry outside the Greek community, shown in all its kitschy glory.  There are some funny running gags like the heal-all Windex, but the movie barely manages to keep one step of itself, falling back on all too-typical Hollywood trappings to maintain its momentum.

The attraction between Toula and Ian is never explained; he's just a plug-in &quot;dream guy&quot; who falls into her life.  In fact, his role is so trivial that John Corbett isn't even listed in the 15 &quot;top billed&quot; cast members in the IMDB description of the movie! <p>Toula's large, boisterous family is likable enough, but there are so many of them that nobody is really well developed as a character.  Anyone who grew up in a large ethnic-American family (Greek, Italian, Polish, or whatever) -- or dated/married someone from such a family --will probably enjoy it. So will women over 30 who have been less than lucky in love.

His daughter Toula is 30 years old and she is supposed marry a good Greek man and have many Greek children that can carry on the Greek traditions according to Gus.  However, Toula has a different idea of what she wants to do--she wants to go to college and get an education.  In the process, she meets Ian Miller, a non-Greek man who is from an opposite type of family where silence is merry.  This presents some problems for their relationship, since it infuriates Toula's father.  My Big Fat Greek Wedding is a warm and humorous film that in the end provides a happy ending as well as food for the mind.</p></br><a href="../users/AZ5250G2U795I.html">AZ5250G2U795I</a><br/><p>This movie is absolutely WONDERFUL! Being Swiss, I can honestly say I have very little experience with Greek Culture, and found myself wanting to hop the first boat to Athens by the end of watching it.<br />Vardolos has written a film that deftly celebrates love, family, and heritage. It's difficult to throw these elements into a comedy without crossing the dangerous borderline of parody, and she does this beautifully. You find yourself appreciating the nuances of this film's portayal of a culture you may not be familliar with because you see your own family in hers, no matter what the nationality.<p>And John Corrbett should just plan on a career as a romantic lead. His Ian is the perfect man you would want for yourself, best friend, daughter, etc. Corbett brings a 'dreamboat' presence that resonates with romantic honesty and charm, and he also manages to be 'everyguy.' His character works because he never seems 'out of your league' perfect.<p>Michael Constantine is brilliant at Tula's father. His Greek ethinicy is brilliantly conveyed in ecentricities that are actually more particular to fatherhood than Greek culture.<p>This is a wonderful little film that will make you long to fall in love if you haven't already, and make you appreciate who you love if you are in love. You cannot miss with this film, and the DVD is a must own because you will just watch it too many times to justify rerental fees.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IOJE0W1NXOSE.html">A1IOJE0W1NXOSE</a><br/><p>At the beginning of the movie, Nia Vardalos (Toula) is a plain, 30-plus young Greek woman, whose parents despair of her ever finding a nice Greek man to marry.  They are so entrenched in their own ethnicity that imitations of Greek statues adorn their lawn and Toula's father can prove that every word in the English language originally comes from Greek.  Nia persuades her parents to let her attend college and she has a physical transformation which leads to a romance with an engaging Anglo teacher, played by John Corbett.  There is a predictable clash of cultures when the two young lovers meet one another's families and the working out of these problems is the meat of the film.  Toula vacillates between love and embarrassment for her large family who talk too loud, eat too much, and get into each other's business.  If you need a good laugh and a "feel-good" movie, this one's for you!</p></br><a href="../users/AW3VZ5O895LRK.html">AW3VZ5O895LRK</a><br/><p>Let me join the chorus of approval for what started out as a small movie and ended up, deservedly, a huge hit.  I'm from a mixed marriage, Italian (mother) and New England WASP (father).  The only difference here is that the materfamilias half is Greek.  Small difference.  The huge difference is always how emotional, loud and overwhelming the ethnic end is and how restrained, cool, controlled and underwhelming the WASP end is.  This film captures that difference perfectly.  It is safe to say that the big attraction for the WASP end of the couple is getting away from the emotionally stultifying world he inhabits.  John Corbett (from "Sex and the City") is marvelous as Ian in that role.  Actually, this role isn't very different from that tv role but he does that kind of role extremely well and you couldn't ask for a more attractive, beguiling leading man.  He may lack range as an actor but that's not a problem here. Nia Vardalos, the leading lady, comes to film from comedy plus she also wrote the screenplay.  She is wonderful as the ethnic daughter who has to deal with her volatile family upon announcing that she is going to marry a non-Greek.  All hell breaks out.  Great as Corbett and Vardalos are, this movie is almost stolen right underneath them by Michael Constantine as the father.  He is the family member who has the hardest time accepting a mixed marriage and he is both hilarious and touching every step of the way.  The rest of the supporting cast is all top notch as well.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EMDSTJDUE6B0.html">A1EMDSTJDUE6B0</a><br/><p>Although this is not my favorite genre, this was a good movie. I was tempted to give it four stars, but there were no real drawbacks that would justify that, so it gets five stars.<p>The actors do a good job. John Corbett would appear to be John Travolta's brother -- similar looks, voice and mannerisms. The pair come off as made for each other and the timing of the playout of the romance is good.<p>The family representation is typical of large family marriages with a small family (like in our case and several other couples that we know). In that sense, much of the comedy may be easy to laugh at. However, for people not in that situation, they may ask themselves where the humor is. Still, there is enough to justify it for a good date with some romance in the air. Obviously a good choice for special occasions like Valentine's Day.</p></br><a href="../users/AOYTQFRLD8VLP.html">AOYTQFRLD8VLP</a><br/><p>"My Big Fat Greek Wedding" depicts the life of a Greek-American woman in her thirties who is under enormous pressure to marry and have children by her very traditional father (Michael Constantine) who refuses to embrace modern values and accept his middle child as she is. Life is made a little easier for her by her cheerful and understanding mother, played by Lainie Kazan.<br /> I somehow feel that Toula, played with both pathos and skillful comic timing by Nia Vardalous, who adapted her hit play for the big screen, could only be a middle child. Sandwitched between her "older, perfect sister", Athena (played by a nagging and very Type A Stavroula Logothettis) and her prankish but supportive younger brother Nick(Louis Mandylor), she starts out as an insecure girl whose notoriously ethnocentric parents send her to school with a lunchbox with the image of the Greek flag  on it instead of something more trendy, make her attend Greek school when her classmates attend Brownies, and never give her a satisfactory explanation about why she is constantly on a divergent path from others. As a young adult working in her family's restaurant, she deals with constant familial discussions about her marital status as if she isn't there to listen to them, she cannot ask for her father's support of her decision to return to school with any confidence(although she gets her way gradually), and later, when she embraces John Corbett's staid, friendly, and well-mannered non-Greek Ian Miller as her suitor, her parents challenge her decision by forcing the hapless Toula to play hostess to an obnoxious parade of men of her own nationality, whom they quite unbelievably prefer as mates for their daughter.It seems that older or younger children in a family are less likely to be under that much pressure to tow the line.<br /> Physically, it has to be noted that Nia Vardalous has dignified classic Greek features, reminiscent of  the profile portraiture on Grecian urns.<br /> In due time, we come to know Toula's large, boisterous extended family, including her Aunt Voula (Andrea Martin) who can be gauche and rather pushy,but funny, Yiayia (Bess Meisler)who is a walking example of war-related Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,and who clings as tenaciously to life as she does to her Greek Peasant garb, and the scene-stealing Gia Carides' big-haired, brassy, buxom,flamboyant, life-loving and gregarious drama queen, Nikki, to name a few.<br />  The groom's parents (Bruce Grey and Fiona Reid)are rather overwhelmed by the bride's family and their customs,but gradually come to embrace them, and Toula grows into someone who accepts her family and develops a more mature understanding of herself and appreciation for her heritage.<br /> While this film should be viewed with a grain of salt and not be taken as a definitive portrayal of Greek family life, it has an enjoyable livliness to it, enhanced by kicky bouzouki music, and because family eccentricties are often great onscreen fodder, it has been, quite understandably, a great success. Adiya, everybody!</p></br><a href="../users/A2BZWG2LTJZGBQ.html">A2BZWG2LTJZGBQ</a><br/><p>When I first heard of this movie, I was not looking forward to it.  However, I really liked it.  It is the story of a Greek woman who is part of a huge, cohesive family unit, who not only does everything with each other, but owns their own restaurant.  They won't even associate with anyone who is not Greek.  The woman's name is Toula.<p>Toula is somewhat lonely, because she is single.  Her dad wants her to do what Greek girls do.  Marry a Greek man, have a bunch of Greek kids, and make lots of Greek food.  Of course, she meets an American man, falls in love, and marries him.  This pleases her dad none too much, therein lies the conflict.<p>The movie is about the characters, not the plot.  The actors are all relative unknowns.  There is not one legitimate star in the cast.  It's similar to &quot;Blair Witch Project&quot; in that it was a sleeper hit.  Not a large budget, small opening circulation.  But word of mouth is still the best advertising.  <p>This movie will appeal to you if your family is anything like this one.  My family is not like this, but I see my wife's family here.  They are tight knit, and they do everything together.  However, they only use Windex to clean the glass.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>This film is the perfect adventure in experimenting all kinds of laughter, from an ephete smile to an uproarious bursting-out explosion. Every single detail is supposed to made you laugh, and you better do it if you do not want to be righteously considered as a party pooper. The film is hilarious and that is its only real quality. After a while though, you start wondering what your are laughing at? The melting pot that is working upside down, to the benefit and profit of the Greek immigrants? The salad bowl which is all mixed up and confused since good American people have to integrate the Greek culture and religion just for one son to get married to one Greek daughter? Or just maybe to ourselves who are always thinking, reacting and acting within the narrow guidelines of our one-way cultural vision? But who cares since it is funny and we laugh. But don't choke on the bones if, being a vegetarian, you are suggested to drop meat and start eating mutton. That is Greek humor indeed, maybe with a touch or Turkish recollection behind.<p>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Perpignan</p></br><a href="../users/A2SRZQU1SZG4RR.html">A2SRZQU1SZG4RR</a><br/><p>Nia Vardalas stars as Toula, the plain unadorned 30 year old single, "unmarried" daughter of a Greek family who have successfully assimilated into American life. They are the owners of "Dancing Zorba's" a popular neighborhood Greek Restaurant in Chicago. Like Greeks everywhere, the cultural values are instilled into the offspring early in life and the extended family is *most* important ... it is central to their lives. This film is a light-hearted comedy which exaggerates some of the amusing moments about a good obedient daughter who is trying to meet the expectations of her Greek immigrant parents and who is also trying to be independent and make a life for herself.<br /><br />While fulfilling her parents wishes and living within the cultural milieu of the family, Toula dreams of some independence ... she realizes she can contribute something more than being a seating hostess and cashier at the family restaurant. She recalls being in grammar school when she was the only dark brown haired girl, sitting alone eating her packed lunch, home-made "moussaka". At the next table a group of blond haired girls were laughing and asked her what she was eating, Toula told them. Afterwards, one had mocked her food, calling it "moose kaka", making all the girls giggle. At that age Toula  felt she was an outsider ... now as a young adult, she wants to spread her wings, take a course at the local university, prove her self-worth and that she is intelligent, not so different from everyone else. She receives the support of her mother and Aunt who convince her dad that she would be a valuable asset at her Aunt's travel agency ... he agrees and they exchange family employees, her male cousin will work at Dancing Zorbas, while Toula will work at the travel agency. After this point in the film, Toula blossoms from a "plain Jane" into an attractive young lady who begins expressing her own interests apart from the family circle. While working at the agency ... a young man walks past the window and waves to her. She recalls he was a customer at Dancing Zorba's, when she was plainly dressed, awkward and shy, while serving him coffee. Now, she is both embarrassed and flatterred by his amusing antics as he tries to capture her attention when working. His ploy works ... they meet and date. Toula makes excuses to the family that she is taking a pottery class in the evening so that she can see Ian Miller, who is a grammar school teacher and vegetarian. He comes from a family that is best described as W.A.S.P.<br /><br />The film has a superb build up of comedy and suspense as Toula and Ian become more serious. They learn about their unique differences but appreciate each other even more and consider them assets. One of the climaxes in the film is when Toula's female cousin catches her kissing Ian at the travel agency ... The cousin mentions the family knows Toula is dating a non-Greek because an Aunt saw them together and spread the news like wild fire. Ian learns protocol and asks Gus Portokalas, Toula's dad, for permission to date his daughter. Gus refuses because Ian is not Greek. Eventually, the families meet and iron out their differences as both Toula and Ian fall further in love ... The manner in which the couple win over Toula's dad and family is the stuff of great comedy. Both families gradually accept that Toula and Ian are meant for each other and will get married ... but only *after* Ian agrees to convert to the Greek Orthodox so he can marry within her church. Anyone familiar with Greeks who live in the USA will recognize the amusing characters, typical behavior and values that are so realisticlly portrayed in this film. The cast of characters is perfect. This film will appeal to a large audience of different age groups who enjoy comedy and romance.<br />Erika Borsos (erikab93)</p></br><a href="../users/A1VQBHHXIKHIGS.html">A1VQBHHXIKHIGS</a><br/><p>I'm  not known as a person who sits around watching romantic comedies.

The independent production cost five million dollars, about ten per cent of the price tag for an average Hollywood studio movie. With a very small promotional budget, it opened on a few screens on April 19, 2002 and should have vanished a couple of months later. Instead, it built and built, taking in nearly a quarter of a billion dollars domestically. The fifth highest grossing movie of 2002, it outdid such high profile titles as "Signs", "Goldmember", and "Men in Black II".<p>This very simple romance is about Toula [Nia Vardalos], an ordinary-looking, second generation Greek woman of thirty who meets and falls in love with Ian [John Corbett], a very tall and very WASP school teacher. This does not sit well with her family, especially her father, who always assumed she'd marry a nice Greek boy. The movie tells the sweet, often hilarious story of how two people from different worlds go from first meeting to the altar. <p>The cast includes some great character actors, including Michael Constantine, Lanie Kazan and Andrea Martin. Ms. Vardalos wrote the witty, semi-autobiographical script. <p>It's hard to pinpoint what made "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" the most successful independent movie ever. It's far from the best movie of 2002; indeed, it's rather slight. One factor may be that it's about unconditional love. From the moment they meet, Toula and Ian are destined to be together. They work through every obstacle without ever resorting to the stupid arguments that abound in most other romantic comedy. They never try to change one another. And they are so filled with the joy and wonder of having found each other, the audience can not help but be filled with joy and wonder, too.</p></br><a href="../users/A1YC9XEDFKXPLK.html">A1YC9XEDFKXPLK</a><br/><p>Simple story about a woman who comes into her own at age 30 and finds true and real love for the first time. She is like the sleeper who has awakened and there's nothing to hold her back ! Except her father who does not approve of a non-Greek marrying his daughter or the fact that she wants to go to college...that is the stereotypical macho way of thinking in some cultures that may steam some people, but it does exist and cannot be denied ...Overall, this is a pretty good film with subtle humor that will still make you chuckle...It has to, otherwise please check for a pulse !<p>Yes, many of the jokes and witty banter for the most part were racially stereotypical; But not in a bigoted or negative manner. Anyone, from a Greek, Latin, or Italian background could somehow relate (and yes, I have Greek, I myself am Hispanic, and have Italian friends). We could all relate to many of the familial situations and very much saw the humor...I can also see where some reviewers did NOT get the humor if they are on the "outside"...That said...Yes, I am defending My Big Fat Greek Wedding. It was an enjoyable family film without having to go over the top with race jokes or take on a strong sexual nature (the romance scenes were just that, romance)...I think this is probably what disappointed some viewers is that this was a "clean" film. Funny how we have come along way from seeing clean films made in Hollywood.

It's cute, almost to the point of cheesy. It's a Cinderella story (both within the film and in this sleeper's performance at the box office), and you don't have to think all that much to get it. Vardolos and John Corbett have a good, natural chemistry.<p>The reason this one was ignored at the outset of its release, though, is because it's so formulaic that there's nothing particularly remarkable about it. It's a tried-and-true audience pleaser, no more and no less.<p>As it ranks among the greatest films of last year, though, I prefer ones a bit deeper, more thought-provoking and more challenging.<p>The best this has to offer, though, is Martin's out-of-nowhere, long-winded story about the lump on her neck.

This is one of three films I saw for the first time without knowing anything about them, the other two being Good Will Hunting and Bend It Like Beckham. Although I consider none a "great film," I thoroughly enjoyed all three but for different reasons I shall briefly discuss.<p>Directed by Joel Zwick and starring Nia Vardalos (also author and screenwriter) as Toula, with Lainie Kazan (her mother Maria) and Michael Constantine (her father Gus) cast in important supporting roles, this film really could have portrayed any large and loving family's "big fat wedding." Growing up in a multi-ethnic neighborhood on the South Side of Chicago, I had numerous opportunities to attend weddings and receptions which were strikingly similar to those portrayed in this film but, of course, I had no idea what was happening as members of both families were involved in preparations. Much of this film's great appeal is probably explained by the fact that so many people can identify with the pre-marriage stresses, temper tantrums, threats, tensions, conflicts, alienations, reconciliations, etc. which author Vardalos and director Zwick examine so brilliantly...and so humorously. <p>Toula works in her family's restaurant, Dancing Zorba, and her "Prince Charming" proves to be a schoolteacher, Ian Miller (John Corbett). They meet, fall in love, and become engaged. So far, so good. However, the cultural differences between her family and his are significant. Adjustments and accommodations are necessary and often hilarious as the wedding day approaches. The film's ending is not merely happy, it is joyous. Refreshingly is the fact that in this film, there is a total absence of cynicism concerning ethnic differences. They are relevant to the story line and revealed with good humor. Those who enjoy this film are urged to check out Moonstruck (1987) and Return to Me (2000) in which ethnic and cultural values are also celebrated with style, grace, and exuberance.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L43KWWR05PCS.html">A1L43KWWR05PCS</a><br/><p>This is a warmly funny, down to earth, one note comedy in which I was somewhat disappointed. The reality of it simply did not live up to its media hype. Still, I found this fairly formulaic, romantic comedy to be enjoyable, light-hearted fare to be taken at face value.<br /><br />The film centers around Toula Portokalos (Nia Vardalos), who comes from a fiercely ethno-centric, clannish, Greek family whose Greekness is the end-all, be-all of their lives. Toula is an over thirty, plain Jane, who lives at home with her overly protective mother, Maria (Lainie Kazan), and father, Gus (Michael Constantine), as well as her brother, Nick (Louis Mandylor). She works in her family's coffee shop where she seems to be sleep-walking through life. One day a handsome man, Ian Miller (John Corbett), enters the coffee shop with a friend, and she is smitten. Shortly thereafter, Toula embarks on a life changing course.<br /><br />She takes college courses. She undergoes a complete physical makeover, from the way she dresses to the way she carries herself. She even changes jobs, working at her aunt's travel agency. There, she chances to see her dream man again. They meet. They date. They fall in love. She does all this behind her family's back, as Ian is not Greek. When her family finds out, all hell breaks loose, as her parents parade a host of Greek losers for Toula in hopes that she will not break with tradition.<br /><br />Needless to say, Toula and Ian stick together despite family opposition, hers and his. His family finds her family appalling. Her family finds his family strait-laced and humorless. Never the twain shall meet. Still, the marriage will go on, and Toula's family completely commandeers the wedding, as they will have it done no other way than their way, that is to say, the Greek way. There are many funny, priceless moments throughout the film. Gus, the father, is particularly funny with his belief that all words are of Greek origin and his belief that a spritz of Windex will cure anything. Maria, the mother, also has her zany moments.<br /><br />Nia Vardalos, who is Greek, wrote the script, and she is right on the money. Living in New York, I have had many Greek friends over the years, and many Greeks of the older generation are as ethno-centric as those portrayed in the movie. There was a ring of truth in many of the jokes that hit home. As an actress, however, she leaves a lot to be desired. I found her to be unappealing and somewhat wooden in the role of Toula.<br /><br />The film is an over-hyped, cute, one note comedy that will not prevail over time. The film was recently put to the test when it became a sit-com of the same name with the original movie cast, with the exception of John Corbett (who had his own series "Lucky"). Needless to say, the sit-com did not last out the season. One note comedies rarely do. Still, this film is worth a rental, as it will certainly provide some laughs.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NUHWMHA9XNKV.html">A2NUHWMHA9XNKV</a><br/><p>SO FUNNY!<br /><br />this comedy is outstandingly funny. i must admit, after i saw it, i couldn't stop laughing. yaya, is so funny, especially when she keeps going on the neighbor's yard. this movie is so fun-packed, and it's a famliy movie for everyone. trust me, YOU WILL LAUGH!</p></br><a href="../users/A1XJOSJN6FHFO0.html">A1XJOSJN6FHFO0</a><br/><p>If you want entertainment at its best, you just have to sit<br />down and watch this movie.

Toula is a frumpy, bespectacled "seating hostess" in her father's Chicago establishment. Though the life cycle of a Greek girl is to marry a Greek boy, have lots of Greek kids, and spend her life feeding an extended Greek family, Gus is beginning to doubt Toula's ability to pull this off - particularly the first bit. Realizing she doesn't have a life, Toula connives with her mother Maria (Lainie Kazan) to land a job in her aunt's travel agency. Now, out in the real world - with the help of a cosmetic and fashion makeover - she meets and falls in love with high school teacher Ian Miller (John Corbett). Ian is decidedly not Greek. He's the only son of affluent, coldly reserved, WASP parents. The film's comedic plot revolves around the awkwardness resulting from the collision of two very different cultures during the course of Ian and Toula's BIG FAT GREEK WEDDING. For example, when the elder Millers pull up in front of the Portokalos house for an initial get-acquainted get-together, they're appalled to see the entire Portokalos clan - Toula has 27 first cousins - roasting an animal carcass in the front yard. Did I mention that the Millers are vegetarians?<p>I never felt the same affinity and sympathy for Gus and his family as I did for Lalit Verma and his family in MONSOON WEDDING, a splendid Indian film that is driven more by character development than by comic situations. Perhaps it was also because Lalit was coping with some very real predicaments, while Gus's problems are of his own mind's making. However, MY BIG FAT GREEK WEDDING still works because the people seem very real. Toula and Ian are attractive in a reasonable, but not intimidating, way. (This isn't a cutely tousled Meg Ryan meets a handsomely charming Tom Hanks soap opera.) Ms. Kazan is terrific as the "family neck" which can turn the obstinate "family head" (Gus) in any way that she pleases. Both movies stress the value of large-family relationships, something long forgotten by the miniscule, Nuclear Age American families of WASP heritage that strive for independence from tribal obligations.<p>Oh, and I have to believe the makers of Windex forked over some big bucks to support this film's production. Otherwise, who would've brought to our attention this stuff's amazing properties?</p></br><a href="../users/A2JXAQ92WYPAAR.html">A2JXAQ92WYPAAR</a><br/><p>What a pleasing little film! I have seen it now half a dozen times. Each time I enjoy it as much as the first time. It is a delight. The acting is fine, of course, but finally it is the writing. The script is fantastic, a work of genius. What is so great is the author's ability to catch at each turn those little, tiny moments that say so much. The running gag over the Windex, for example, is hilarious, especially when the WASP groom takes it up. It shows the new connection between the father and son-in-law, while obviously just being silly. The film takes up a classic fish-out-of-water plot but, by emphasizing the cross-cultural connection, the story seems fresh and new. Both families are priceless. The characterization is so finely tuned, so accurate and true to character. Take the aunt, for instance: how funny she is when Toula's soon-to-be- husband announces that he is a vegetarian. "You don't eat no meat?" she says with some astonishment. Then: "OK. I'll make lamb." There are running gags, but also deep themes such as self-discovery, love, loyalty, and so on. The mother's heart to heart with Toula in the bedroom brought tears to my eyes. It is a deep movie, but light-hearted, inspiring, and loads of fun.</p></br><a href="../users/A23GFTVIETX7DS.html">A23GFTVIETX7DS</a><br/><p>&quot;My Big Fat Greek Wedding&quot; is family-clash comedy at its best, with wacky, over-the-top characterizations and absurdist situations.  Toula, a woman of Greek heritage who feels that something in her life must change, finds her salvation in Ian, a WASPish school teacher.  However, love does not conquer all since Ian's repressed parents find Toula and her family garish and overwhelming, and Toula's overly emotional family finds Ian and his family too, well, non-Greek.  As the title suggests, the real focus of this film is on Toula and her family, with their huge family &quot;impromptu&quot; gatherings, lamb on a spit in the front yard, and their superstitious rituals.  All these idiosyncrasies provide hilarious scenes that build on one another, culminating in Toula and Ian's improbable wedding.<p>The success of this movie arises partly out of low expectations, as it was a sleeper that only after months of word-of-mouth praise became a blockbuster.  The premise and ultimate plot progression is formulaic - a more or less typical romantic comedy.  Viewers won't find anything groundbreaking in comedy here.  Its strength lies in the individual caricatures of Toula's family and the charm of outwardly ordinary Nia Vardalos, who plays Toula.  Toula's reactions to her family's commandeering of her wedding are priceless in their exaggeration.  The film concludes as one would expect, although the ride to get there has been fun and full of laughs. I will never again pick up a bottle of Windex without smiling.  <p>If you don't expect too much of this film, you'll love it.  I recommend it for an evening of amusing entertainment when you don't feel like watching anything demanding.  While I would expect women to enjoy it more than men, I've found many male friends who highly recommend it - maybe because it reminds them of the trials with their own in-laws.  Fans of &quot;Meet the Parents&quot; and &quot;The Birdcage&quot; will probably like this movie as well.</p></br><a href="../users/A1M9DQDGE07Q0U.html">A1M9DQDGE07Q0U</a><br/><p>I'm at a loss to explain why "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" got the Oscar nod for best screenplay. It's the story of an ugly duckling, Toula Portocalas (Nia Vardalos) who (stop me if you've heard this one before) turns into a beautiful swan by the end. This transformation is made possible by the love and respect of Toula's floppy-eared fianc&eacute;e cum groom, Ian Miller (John Corbett). Though both of Toula's parents, Gus (Michael Constantine) and Maria (Lainie Kazan), are initially opposed to the marriage they eventually they warm up to the idea that their daughter loves a Catholic.<br />Written by Vardalos, who clearly thought this was some sort of homage to her middle European heritage, the plot is excessively burdened with middle-European clich&eacute;s that get overplayed, tapping into the bias that all Greeks are warm-hearted simpletons and all outsiders are clearly cold fish. Perhaps a more fitting title would have been, "My Big Fat Greek Stereotype". Really, there are maybe four instances in the entire film where I found myself genuinely smiling. The rest of the jokes fall somewhere between middle of the road and "oh God, I can't believe they did that!" Clearly, this was a movie written for and marketed to a very specific audience, and in so far as that goes, "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" hit its target right on the money and all the way through to a failed television spin off and lucrative Hollywood career for its star. Never has so little originality been stretched such a long, long way. But this is not a great comedy or even a mediocre one. It's just big and fat.<br /><br />At least there's some redemption to be found in the widescreen transfer. Anamorphically enhanced, colors are rich, bold and well balanced. Contrast levels are admirably presented with a remarkable amount of fine detail present, while blacks are both solid and deep. Edge enhancement is present but is kept to a bare minimum. Pixelization and shimmering crop up now and then, but here too, they are nothing to quibble about. The audio is 5.1 and nicely presented.</p></br><a href="../users/A33PNAQ33DGBJG.html">A33PNAQ33DGBJG</a><br/><p>The one line in the movie that made it a hit for me was,"you are worth it." After that, I just sat back and enjoyed the fun and sweetness of this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TAPSNKK9AFSQ.html">A2TAPSNKK9AFSQ</a><br/><p>In this movie we see Toula  who is a good Greek girl but is almost 30 and still not married. Perhaps this is what Sophocles had in mind when he wrote about Greek Tragedies. Toula then falls in love with an Anglo Saxon American much to her family's dismay and horror. The irony in this film is while Toula spends her time trying not to be Greek her new fiance does everything he can to be Greek and accepted by her family. He even dumps his friend as Best Man in his Wedding because he is not Greek. I figure that after two years of eating souvlaki and taramosalata he will file for a Big Greek Divorce!!! If you enjoy seeing ethnic stereotypes played out on the big screen then this movie is for you.</p></br><a href="../users/A1COG8T9MPP3KA.html">A1COG8T9MPP3KA</a><br/><p>How did they make Nia so unattractive at the beginning of this film? It is amazing what putting on a little makeup and fashionable clothes can do for a person! The story is not far fetched at all. If anybody has ever dated a person from another culture, you will get a kick out of this film. I dated a Russian and a Chilean before (not at the same time) and was thrust into some very similar funny situations. I wouldn't trade my experiences for anything. This film is charming in showcasing &quot;culture shocks&quot;....</p></br><a href="../users/A281NPSIMI1C2R.html">A281NPSIMI1C2R</a><br/><p>When every second person you meet asks you if you have seen a movie, you start to really wish they would release the movie on DVD sooner.<br /><br />Finally I was able to view a movie everyone I know has been telling me to see. EVEN people I don't know, like those in the line at the grocery store. Yes.<br /><br />The absolute enthusiasm is like nothing I've seen in a long time. I mean, strangers are asking me if I've seen this movie.<br /><br />Firstly, I think this movie is very popular because it presents a woman who is not a "pencil-thin waif" in the role of a romantic. She really is a woman we can all relate to.  She has hips, she breaks out AND everyone in her family wants to know when she is going to get married and have kids. Hello, hello, hello reality. This is REAL.<br /><br />Any woman who has planned a wedding and actually gone through with it without going half insane, will completely relate to Toula. No matter her age. This movie has those universal themes in it all woman can relate to. And then we have Ian (John Corbett) who could turn any woman into a complete mute in his presence. Which is what happens when Toula and Ian first meet.<br /><br />Then, to top this all off. Ian not only does everything he can to please Toula, he says everything she NEEDS to hear. The fact is, she doesn't have to ask. This man really, really loves Toula. He is a woman's most romantic fantasy.<br /><br />So, if woman are running up to you asking you why you haven't seen this movie or bought your own copy, that is my take on WHY.<br /><br />This is one of those sweet and almost innocent movies that doesn't focus on sex scenes and all you will see is some kissing and a brief scene that is rather cute and funny when Toula "attacks" Ian. This movie gets right to the heart of the matter and deals with romance, family situations and love.<br /><br />The plot is relatively simple because basically this is a very short and relatively uncomplicated courtship. This is a story told by Toula and therefore it takes on a "diary" feel.<br /><br />I thought Toula changed a bit too fast from "mousy-hide-behind-counter" girl to "I'm-so-here" girl (scenes got cut??), but apart from that, Nia Vardalos is a very likeable actress who captured the innocence of Toula. I'm not sure how Ian turned out to be quite so wonderful with the types of parents they portray. I'd like to see parents portrayed in a different way than is recently acceptable. The "we-are-so-not-here-and-stare-into-space" parents are so not fun to watch onscreen.<br /><br />How would a wonderful man like Ian be produced by "those" two parents? Sorry, not going to happen in my mind. I think they made his parents far too insecure and unintelligent. I'm sorry to say but the Greek family was not "that" different than any other family. It was like Ian's family had never left the house or met anyone of another culture in our multicultural society.<br /><br />I think I laughed three or four times (where they keep making poor Ian say things in Greek he has no idea he is saying), but this was not a ROFLOL funny type movie. There are some serious issues they address well and other's they ignore.<br /><br />I mean, would you not want to first study up on a certain religion before being baptized into a completely new religion?<br /><br />It was like watching a "dating show" in some way and like "remembering" your own wedding in other ways.<br /><br />Hey, even if this was overhyped, it was worth watching to see John Corbett in a role of a completely romantic guy.<br /><br />Listen up guys out there. This is what will drive a woman wild. lol<br /><br />What woman would NOT DIE to have a man ask her father if he could ask her out. Let alone make an effort to fit into her family life and adjust to a completely new religion.<br /><br />They are onto something here, but this movie should have had a more complicated plot, not to mention a longer period of time between "mousy" to "I'm-so-here" girl.<br /><br />Overall, I loved it and can see why alomst everyone does. If movies are at least moving in this direction there may be some hope for 2003-2004. Just wondering: "Did sales for Windex triple?"<br /><br />They should have really played up the "Greek Food" aspects in this movie. They barely show you anything and had a great opportunity to promote Greek food, which is some of the most delicious food I've ever tasted.<br /><br />I grew up with Greek friends and my parents learned how to make lamb on the spit and let me tell you, it is delicious beyond all expectations. Also, pass the Baklava, please. It does seem Ian loves Greek food, which is what gives us a hint at the start that he will fit in perfectly. Plus, he has such a laid back "I'm-so-in control-of-this-situation" attitude. It is just divine.<br /><br />Basic Plot:<br /><br />Girl sees Boy<br />Boy sees Girl but she is mousy.<br />Girl becomes goddess of desire and intellectual princess of travel.<br />Man sees Girl and remembers her for inner charm.<br />Girl tries to hide from Boy knowing family will never approve of dashing hunk who is not Greek.<br />Boy takes all in stride and conquers all in path on way to sweeping girl off feet.<br />Girl is stunned, amazed and impressed and how could she not be?<br /><br />If you are a hopeless romantic, you will probably love it.<br />If your pragmatic nature has gotten a hold of you, you probably won't.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review</p></br><a href="../users/A17FLA8HQOFVIG.html">A17FLA8HQOFVIG</a><br/><p>The only reason I finally succumbed to seeing this film was because it became such a big hit.  I usually avoid romantic comedies though and find them boring.  Well, frankly, this was no exception.  I do admire the star though, Nia Vardalos, who wrote the screenplay which she adapted from her successful one-woman show.<p>This is the story of a 30-year-old Greek-American woman who finds love with a nice looking non-Greek man.  From the opening scene the plot of the story was obvious.  And even though there were a few giggles because of the exaggerated ethnic extended family, there was not one bit of tension.  There are no conflicts between the lovers.  And the only bump in the road is her family, which doesn't seem to be any kind of real impediment - especially since the title of the film is a dead giveaway as to the final outcome.<p>O.K., I did watch the film all the way through.  Sometimes I even smiled at some of the predictable jokes.  But it was much too simple for my taste.  I'm sorry, but I can only give My Big Fat Greek Wedding the mildest of lukewarm recommendations.</p></br><a href="../users/AHCVWPLA1O4X8.html">AHCVWPLA1O4X8</a><br/><p>This is an interesting spin on the comedy/romance genre.  Unlike your typical 'chick-flick,' My Big Fat Greek Wedding is a story about culture clash and family values.  Toula, a 30-year old, unmarried Greek woman who is somewhat ashamed of her heritage, meets and falls in love with a young American named Ian.  What follows is a humorous story of their developing love and Toula's struggle to make her family understand.<p>So why only three stars?  Well, the movie is funny, but not THAT funny.  In fact, it's only mildly amusing.  Aside from the Windex joke (which was very cool), there is little to laugh at in this movie.  And, as far as the love story goes, there is hardly any chemistry between Toula and Ian.  In fact, the love story is horribly underdeveloped.<p>Lots of people think this movie is downright hilarious, so it's worth your time to check it out.  I wasn't particularly impressed, but then again I'm not a big fan of romantic comedies anyway. Either way, it's worth watching at least once.</p></br><a href="../users/A2J57EQ9KPGXR9.html">A2J57EQ9KPGXR9</a><br/><p>Good production values, good acting and a fairly interesting storyline. A guy can actually sit through this and not be bored to death and will laugh at the legitimately funny parts. Surprised the heck out of me too.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LU79BYMWZEW9.html">A3LU79BYMWZEW9</a><br/><p>I love my local drive in theater. (Yes, we still have one!!)  I mean, where else are  you going to get an oddball double bill like "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" and "XXX"?  You gotta love that!  Well, actually, I didn't quite love "XXX"--just not my cup of tea, although it may be, as they say, "good of kind."  "Greek Wedding," however, was another story, a real charmer through and through--an ugly duckling story in which the swan never totally abandons her duckling roots.  (Bad metaphor, but you know what I mean).<p>There really isn't much that is startlingly new in this heartwarmer.  Culture clash has always been a standard comedic ploy for as long as this nation has been a melting pot, and mixed marriages have been making for mixed up comedies since well before "I Love Lucy."  But a proven formula doesn't necessarily guarantee success.  Without sharp writing, good comic acting, and expert direction things can still go terribly awry.  Luckily for us, "Greek Wedding" is pretty much three for three on all those counts.  <p>Based on a one-woman live show written and performed by comic actress Nia Vardalos and brought to the big screen with the help of Hollywood power couple, Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson, "Greek Wedding" retains much of its non-splashy modest roots but is also very successfully "opened up".  Vardalos is a wonderful actress, but she and director Joel Zwick have also a assembled a colorful cast of well-known and not so well-known actors who flesh out what must have been somewhat sketchier portraits in the theater piece.<p>It's always heartening to see good actors get a chance to do good work.  When was the last time you even saw Michael Constantine or Lainie Kazan in ANYTHING, let alone anything GOOD!? Another reviewer below wondered why John Corbett isn't a bigger star.  I can't say whether he'd be a great regular leading man or not.  He's always had something of a Jeff Bridges quality, to be sure, but it's a quirky kind of Jeff Bridges-ness. He's just about perfect here though.  Here's hoping that he and the rest of this ensemble cast find more such quality projects--and if Nia Vardalos pens them, well, you can pretty much rest assured it'll be quality stuff.</p></br><a href="../users/ABFOAYZA2UHD3.html">ABFOAYZA2UHD3</a><br/><p>I cannot fathom why Nia Vardalos insisted on playing Toula, her acting is mediocre at best and actually diminishes the believability of the story.<br /><br />There are also a number of exaggerations in the whole "crazy greek family" setup, eeeeeveryone in her family is so crazy and tacky, and only SHE, brought up by same people mind you, is a model of style and taste.<br /><br />She is embarassed by her family yet has no balls to live a life on her own, without them.. what the hell?!<br /><br />First time you watch this movie, it's funny, as all the exaggerations actually surprise you and make you laugh, but on second viewing it starts sucking..

It's a coming of age, which I can appreciate.<br />Seeing as a Greek person, the star of the film, Nia Vardalos, wrote the screenplay, the portrayals of the Greek family must be right on. Well, I felt saddened by there behavior. I thought since Toula(Nia Vardalos) was coming into her new brave world that she would have put her foot down and had her wedding her way instead of her family's way. They entirely took over everything. It just bothered me to watch her allow this cuz they are "family".<br />A big letdown of a movie.  Avoid!! It's not funny.</p></br><a href="../users/AKMEY1BSHSDG7.html">AKMEY1BSHSDG7</a><br/><p>No! It's not Shakespeare! (By the way, do you know he was Greek?) But, it sure is one of the funniest, most heart-warming movies I've seen in years. If you are Greek, Italian, German, Irish or Anything, you will see something of your family in this film. More importantly, it will leave you with a feeling of hope for the world, because we all share these family relationships in one way or another.<br /><br />Yet another reason My Big Fat Greek Wedding is one of the best feel-good movies around is that it pokes fun at the characters and their relationships without a touch of nastiness or venom.<br /><br />This movie absolutely belongs in every family's DVD collection.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>`My Big Fat Greek Wedding' is not necessarily `laugh-out-loud' funny but it is funny.  I think that all the hype surrounding this film killed it for me the first time I saw it.  It just was not the laugh-riot I was promised.  Now, a few years later, I watched it again for the second time with my wife (one of the ones who over-hyped the film when it was released).  With the hype dead and my initial response to the film a vague memory I can honestly say that the second time around was much more rewarding.  `My Big Fat Greek Wedding' is sweet and sentimental and leaves the viewer with that warm and fuzzy feeling we don't get much anymore.  It just feels right from start to finish.  It's not like it's anything all that `new' to the genre.  Think `Guess Who's Coming to Dinner' with Greeks and Jews.  Despite the `familiarity' it still feels refreshing because it's not your typical comedy.  It's a little more inviting than the average comedy.<br /><br />This feeling of warm invitation is due to the films star (and author) Nia Vardalos, the most unlikely of romantic leads.  I think that's another draw to this film is that the stars look and act like real people (okay, they may act a little stranger than `real' people, but that's half the fun) as apposed to looking like Jessica Alba.  Vardalos plays Toula Portokalos, a thirty-something Greek girl who is still single, slightly overweight and gawky.  In the eyes of her family she's somewhat of a failure.  Toula decides that she is finally going to take her life into her own hands instead of living the life her father has set before her.  That is when she meets Ian, a handsome Jewish man that is everything she's ever dreamed of and everything her family would never condone.<br /><br />Nia Vardalos captures the downtrodden Toula perfectly, drawing the audience into her troubles, always remaining that sweet girl we want to see end up happy.  John Corbett is effective as Ian, handsome and genuine.  We understand why Toula loves him so much.  Lainie Kazan plays Toula's mother with such genuine warmth she'll have you wishing that she were your mother, and Michael Constantine does a great job of making his eccentric and overbearing father come across understandable and likable.  To me though, and just about every other person I speak to, the standout here is non other than Andrea Martin who steals the show with her comedic timing.  Her whole `twin' scene makes this movie worthy of your DVD library.<br /><br />`My Big Fat Greek Wedding' is truly a lovely film.  If you were anything like me and expected so much that you were disappointed the first go around I urge you to give this one another try.  Its warmth and genuine free spirit make `My Big Fat Greek Wedding' not the funniest comedy out there but one of the most likable.</p></br></body></html>

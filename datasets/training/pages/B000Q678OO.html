Alex always skips school and always been a troublemaker from the start, but during one night when he invades the home of a rich woman as he attacked and killed her, he is confined for a 14 year life sentence in Prison. But two years later the Government decides to make a program that can reabiliate crooks through special programming that can make them nice and normal citizens without commiting any crime as Alex is the first person to go through this program but can he remain sane and rational or will his horrible past haunt him?<br /><br />A brilliant and unique Sci-fi drama from Stanley Kubrick is one of his greatest movies ever! this is based on a book by Anthony Burgess and has became one of the most influential movies ever. The performances by the cast including Star Wars's David Prowse as one of Alex's Droogs is superb especially McDowell. The film tells about society in the future gone terribly mad that uses memorable images, disturbing subject matter and an unforgettable electronic music score by Wendy Carlos. This is one trippy and wild motion picture no film fantatic should miss, it's a once-in-a-lifetime cult classic that has been acclaimed by critics everywhere and even caused controversy in it's time.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray features spectacular picture and sound with some cool extras like audio commentary, two documentaries, Career Profile on Malcom Mcdowell and Trailer.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ARRAMXWT83PT.html">A2ARRAMXWT83PT</a><br/><p>One of the finest examples of filmmaking ever made in cinema history, this is one of my all time favorites. You all know the story, so we don't have to go there. Also, for the many detractors of this film - most of them Christians - here is a bit of advice: watch the film again and analyze it afterwards. There are many Christian themes in this film, and though they are not as optimistic as you would probably hope, they are still there. As a Christian, it's just easy for me to find God in just about anything...even Kubrick films! Yay!<br /><br />Also, this film features some of the best cinematography, writing, and acting that you will ever see/hear. Malcom McDowell is excellent as Alex, and just radiates pure evil. It's a shame that Kubrick never contacted him again after this film. They seemed to make a great team. Anyways, the whole cast is great, the music is great - in short, it's amazing. There are some things here that will disturb you, namely the lengthy rape sequence - but hey, you're supposed to be repulsed by it. If not, then I think you may have a few problems.<br /><br />If you have not seen it yet, SEE IT.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VQBHHXIKHIGS.html">A1VQBHHXIKHIGS</a><br/><p>Novelist Anthony Burgess is obviously a wordsmith of the highest order, and director Stanley Kubrick was able to share that in the dialogue and especially the narrative. The film is itself is one of the most clever and perceptive I've seen, with a sardonic wit, and a sense of irony so sharp it almost hurts. Shockingly violent visuals. Psychedelica gone amok which you must love. This 1971 vision of the world in and my 2005 vision of the world are identical. If you've never seen it, go get it right now.<br /><br />It's very hard to believe this film is 34 years old. It's too damn modern. I'd really hate to be Kubrick 30 years after this film, probably knowing he'll never top it.<br /><br />Malcolm McDowell. I suppose that, for many folks, he'll go down in cinematic history as the guy who killed Captain Kirk. I'd like to humbly suggest that McDowell watch this film so he can remember that, once upon a time, he was a damn fine actor.</p></br><a href="../users/AV1KYJXHOWPMD.html">AV1KYJXHOWPMD</a><br/><p>The film is not as good as the fantastic novel. Mainly because they went a little overboard on the violence and sexuality. I give the film four and a half stars. I could say that this is close to being a classic. I liked they guy who played Alex's father better on The Shining. But still, Malcolm McDowell was born to play Alex he was perhaps the best actor in the film. Recommended to Kubrick fans.</p></br><a href="../users/A1Y87E22UVYCE6.html">A1Y87E22UVYCE6</a><br/><p>Amazingly, director Stanley Kubrick's (1928-1999) career comprises only 16 films of which just 9 of them were done after his first great success: "Paths of Glory" (1957).<br /><br />With this rather small amount of movies in his 50 years as film director, he carved a place in Director's Olympus!<br /><br />He had a controversial personality, obsessive and perfectionist was dreaded by actors due to his "do it again" that may conduct to dozens of retakes.<br /><br />"A Clockwork Orange" (1971) was, arguably, his most controversial opus. Scenes of sex & violence leaded to film's exhibition being banished in many countries (Argentina amongst them), so we were able to see it for the first time many years after its release.<br /><br />There are scenes of rape, gratuitous violence against senior people, drug abuse and sheer madness.<br /><br />Nevertheless all these violence is not senseless as in most contemporary movies. It tries to shock the viewer and make her/him reflect about public and private use of power, social and individual manipulation, hypocrisy and family relationships amongst other critical issues.<br /><br /> The story, adapted from Anthony Burgess' sci-fi novel of the same title, is situated in a decadent future (may be due to post-WWIII conditions) at London.<br /><br />In this world teenagers band in quartets, consume exciting drugs, fight each other ruthlessly, use a peculiar language (the novel provides a glossary at the end of the book), ravage isolated country villas and commit remorselessly whatever violent act comes to their fogged minds. At the same time some institutions as penitentiaries & police force still stick to old repressive codes.<br /><br />Alex is the leader of one of these infamous quartets until an "excess" lead him into prison. Being there he will apply to receive an innovative "conversion" method.<br /><br />The outcome of this therapy-conversion method will have unexpected results.<br /><br />Malcolm McDowell in the best performance of his extended professional life fleshes Alex de Large. Michael Bates is very good too as Chief Guard.<br /><br />As is his trade mark, Stanley Kubrick, uses non-original music score outstandingly. During the movie it may be heard Beethoven's 9th Symphony, three opera overtures from Rossini and in a key scene Brown's "Singing in the Rain".<br /><br />Color cinematography is product of John Alcott, who will team with Kubrick two more times, wining an Oscar with "Barry Lyndon".<br /><br />It is a great movie only recommended for adult mature audience!<br /><br />Reviewed by Max Yofre.</p></br><a href="../users/A3TYC8T6W81DDB.html">A3TYC8T6W81DDB</a><br/><p>Alex DeLarge is your average eighteen year old boy...if by average, you mean he fully embraces the old ultraviolence and wanders the streets with his three droogs causing havoc and doing whatever he likes. Skipping school, breaking and entering, rape, assault...just another day in Alex's life. However, when a planned rape turns into an "accidental" murder, things start to turn fowl for Alex. His droogs turn on him and he winds up being caught by the police. He is then taken to a correctional facility where he spends the next few years, puts on the front that he's fully embraced the bible, and that he's now a changed man. But when word makes round of the experimental Ludovico treatment, Alex realizes his chance at freedom and jumps through the proper hoops to get out of the penitentiary he finds himself in and get into the experimental facility where he can be "cured." He is promised that he'll be a free man within a fortnight. The treatment consists of a drug known as Serum 114 being injected into the patient before making them sit through short films such as a man being beaten to a pulp, a woman being the sexual victim of several men, and a Nazi concentration camp film set to the soundtrack of Beethoven's ninth symphony. Alex begins to feel sick during the films and the doctors insist it's part of the cure. Alex's love for music and Beethoven in general become one of the adverse affects of the treatment as the ninth symphony has the same affect on Alex as the urge to beat or rape someone would. Alex soon comes to realize that you can never go home again and that being a free man isn't all it's cracked up to be, especially after a treatment such as this.<br /><br />It took me this long to finally sit down and watch this film. I have been told for months, maybe years, by friends that I need to see this because I'd enjoy it. I should have listened to those recommendations long ago because I did enjoy it. It is definitely an odd film. The film starts and it makes the viewer feel like they've missed something entirely that everyone else already knows about, but as the film unravels it snowballs into a unique vision of cinema. It kind of reminded me of Altered States, but I enjoyed this much more than Altered States. Even though A Clockwork Orange has a running time of well over two hours, it didn't feel that way. I wasn't glancing at the clock wondering when the film would end. The film didn't drag at all. It was odd, as I mentioned before, but it was interesting enough to keep my attention span throughout the entire film. That's something I take note of with the amount of films I sit through every week.<br /><br />The way the film looked and sounded was amazing, as well. Even though Clockwork is closing in on being forty years old, it sure doesn't look like it. Every scene had brilliant, vibrant colors that pretty much made every frame jump off the screen. The sound in the film was also near perfection. I was reading on IMDb that this was the first film take advantage of Dolby Digital surround sound and it shows.<br /><br />I also really love the way Kubrick shot this film. His sense of perspective is incredible. The long hallway shots and scenes that highlight an actors facial expressions are some of the most memorable scenes in the film and a lot of credit for that goes to the way he shot it. He's a director that I've come to realize I actually admire quite a bit, but need to actually see more of his work.<br /><br />Malcolm McDowell deserves a nod, as well. I doubt I'll be saying anything that hasn't already been said about him in this role, but humor me and pretend that this movie was just released on DVD or something. He makes the film and I'm not just saying that because he's in the lead role. I mean, it's hard to imagine A Clockwork Orange with another actor in McDowell's place. Malcolm McDowell is Alex DeLarge, period. Some of the speeches he gives along with the way he acts during and after the treatment process are some of the most memorable of any film I've sat through.<br /><br />A Clockwork Orange is quite a unique trip, no matter how you look at it. It is weird and unusual, but is worth the watch since it's never actually boring. Kubrick's vision of the film could be the main reason to sit through it as it seems like every shot grabs your attention largely in part to its perspective. Arguably though, the film could be worth seeing due to being the film that Malcolm McDowell is best known for. Clockwork is a film I wouldn't recommend to anyone as I feel like it may not only go over some viewers heads, but soar over. It's for viewers with unique taste for cinema that are willing to sit down and actually pay attention to a film rather than be on the computer or do anything else while trying to watch a movie. A dramatic/science fiction/thriller that is not only viewed by some as one of the ten greatest films in the sci-fi genre but also one of the greatest films of all time.<br /><br />Rating: 8/10</p></br><a href="../users/A100JCBNALJFAW.html">A100JCBNALJFAW</a><br/><p>this film is a has a very nice story about a man named alex who loves to rape woman and fighting/stealing,but that all changes when he goes to jail. then while in jail he hears about a thing that a doctor is doing to stop people from being bad. so later the doctor picks alex to be like a ginny pig for this test. he is forced to watch horrable things while hes eyes are forced open. after getting these test alex can one longer be bad because if he does he gets real sick..<br /><br />  my outro--- basicaly speaking karma is a b*tch as proven in this film. also i would like to add that when you mess with people's feelings that person is no longer a human...<br /><br />in closing------ great story, great directing, good acting<br /><br />i havent read the book but i might some time</p></br><a href="../users/AD0J5KK4WQXNS.html">AD0J5KK4WQXNS</a><br/><p>Clockwork Orange is not like anything you have seen before or probably will see again. It is not a five star movie by any means but it is a good one all the same. Essentially the story, derived from the inventive book of the same name by Anthony Burgess, is set sometime in the future (looks very dated though and the book's slang dialogue can be a little off-putting), about a young leader of a gang of thugs who spends his free time raping, stealing, joyriding, fighting and eventually murdering. He is sent to prison where he volunteers for an experiment to help cure him of his ultra-violent tendencies. However, even though the experiment works (with a small musical side-effect), it is very little more than just a political gimmick to win votes. While on release he encounters everybody that he did wrong too but can not defend himself because he gets sick whenever he gets angry or is aroused.<p>The acting, score and camerawork are on top form but the film suffers from the confines of its restrictive storyline leaving very little room for character development, except for that of the protagonist. What it does not lack in is violence or plenty of moral proclamations about the world in general. It is more of a philosophical statement about the nature of a corrective society than anything else. Everyone seems just as guilty as the other and Kubrick has no qualms about turning the husband of a rape victim into a sinister materialist who exploits anything to his advantage.<p>There are no "good" people in this film and even our horror star of the show has his turn at the innocent victim in the end. The film is a strange play on society in general but does not really merit repetitive viewing. As a side note the film was banned in Great Britain for years. Kubrick pulled the film from distribution himself because he felt that England was not ready for his film. He would also not allow the former Soviet Union or the Eastern Block to watch it either. He certainly was a bit of an odd character and even though critics hold Kubrick as a master director he did make a lot of bunk films too. This is not one of them.</p></br><a href="../users/A33L7G4E8CID3.html">A33L7G4E8CID3</a><br/><p>I just can't say enough about this movie. Thirty years after its initial release, it still holds up well and is the ultimate dystopia on film. Through its nightmarish view of a world where crime and chaos appear unstoppable to its equally nightmarish view of humanity in general, this film packs so much information on the human condition and our present day society that it is possible to feel like you are drinking from a garden hose, as there is so much being thrown at you at once that it is simply impossible to appreciate all of it.<p>The story opens up showing Alex, the protagonist played by Malcolm McDowell, and his three droogs, or gang members. Initially we see them performing all kinds of "ultraviolence" and rape. Then, later, when Alex becomes angry with his droogs and punishes two of them, they turn on him and leave him for the police. Placed in a bleak prison, he hears of a new treatment that will get him out of prison in a matter of weeks. He enthusiastically signs up, but he soon finds out that this treatment will make him physically sick at the sight of violence, sex and even upon hearing his beloved Beethoven. Released back into society, he soon becomes the victim as that timeless human truism, whatever goes around comes around, is proven correct.<p>There are so many themes and aspects of the human condition explored here that it is simply impossible to list them. Just a few are the innate moral condition of man, generally, the criminal mind, victims of crime, media exploitation, the old versus the young, and what happens when the ethics are pushed aside in favor of expediency or safety. All this being said, it is not a film for everyone. There is a lot of violence, sex, and nudity, so prudes need not apply. Certainly if you enjoy films where every question is answered and solutions to all of the problems are easy to find, this is not for you either. A Clockwork Orange raises many issues and also answers them, although you will have to watch closely to find them.<p>Finally, the technical side. Malcolm McDowell does a fantastic job playing malevolent Alex, grasping the nuance and contradiction that make him tick. Kubrick is perfectly in tune with Burgess' novel, able to add touches that perfectly complement the book. He makes the story his own without compromising what made the book so good. Excellent score and cinematography make it seem as if you are there with Alex.<p>If you are looking to see a film that examines the human condition without embellishing at all, gritty in the truest sense, you cannot go wrong with this movie. Although strange and not always easy to watch, it stays with you and reminds you of its timeless points constantly</p></br><a href="../users/A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z.html">A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z</a><br/><p>In Stanley Kubrick's chilling adaptation of the Anthony Burgess novel A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, an ultra-violent sociopathic hooligan named Alex, who murders a woman in her home, has his 15 year prison sentence set aside when he submits to the Ludovico Technique. This method of aversion brainwashing renders him incapable of committing violence, touching women or enjoying his beloved "lovely, lovely Ludwig van." An unforeseen result of behavior modification is that Alex becomes a pawn of those trying to overthrow the Interior Minister and his government.<br /><br />One of the finest soundtracks ever includes several pieces by Wendy Carlos. Kubrick's absolute best!<br /><br />I saw this futuristic frighter at an afternoon matinee during its first week of release. It's a vivid 40-year-old memory due to the unique conditions of that showing, which was at a first generation multiplex called the Showcase Cinemas. The projectionist who ran it must've really loved "Clockwork Orange," for the sound was turned up louder than on any movie I had seen before or have been to since. The deafening roar in that top-of-the-line auditorium stays with me 40 years later, as does the sympathetic nausea I experienced with Alex while the disconcerting Wendy Carlos piece, "Timesteps" blared and in a special movie just for his clamped open eyes the "red, red krovy ran real harasho."<br /><br />End results: 1.) I left the theater with my head a-spin and hearing slightly damaged. 2.) Saw this film a dozen times more that year but was disappointed when the audio was never as loud. 3.) The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000002KDU">A CLOCKWORK ORANGE</a> Motion Picture Soundtrack is an all-time personal favorite. (That Ludovico stuff really works!)<br /><br />Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 imdb viewer poll rating.<br /><br />(8.5) A Clockwork Orange (UK/USA-1971) - Malcolm McDowell/Patrick Magee/Sheila Raynor/Philip Stone/Michael Bates/Warren Clarke/Aubrey Morris/Anthony Sharp/Warren Clarke/James Marcus</p></br><a href="../users/A1YB29BIDULEYE.html">A1YB29BIDULEYE</a><br/><p>What makes this movie is that we may have to watch it a few times before we totally understand it.<br /><br />The movie APPEARS to be out the crimes of Alex (McDowell) and his friends George, Dim, and Pete. They beat up other gangs, and in an especially vile moment, they beat an elderly man and rape his wife. To make a long story short, Alex has a falling out with his friends, and Alex is arrested.<br /><br />This is when things start to get interesting. Certainly, Alex's actions were not to be admired. But gradually, we see that the people around him, and even the ones in the system are not so likable or admirable either. (A counselor is a pervert; the prison workers seem more interested in vengeance than justice; one prison worker seems to be a spin off of Adolf Hitler; the list goes on and on.)<br /><br />Alex hears about a method designed for getting people out of prison early, and making sure they never go back. (It basically makes the patient incapable of making the choice to act on sexual or violent impulses.)  The prison Chaplain seems to be the only voice of reason when he says: "When a man can not choose, he ceases to be a man." But Alex gets his way.<br /><br />All seems well, and Alex gets released from prison early. But things are not so well on the outside. His parents rented his room out, and there is really nowhere for Alex to go. From this moment on, the director does NOT allow our newly won sympathy for Alex to slack for a moment. It does in fact intensify. Alex's former victims see him and take their opportunity for revenge, and because of the treatment, Alex can't protect himself. To make matters worse, Alex runs into his former friends who have now become cops. (And should we be surprised? This does seem to keep with the movie's intentions.) But the worst is yet to come.<br /><br />It is interesting how the government appears to want to help Alex towards the end, but with just a bit of thought, we can see that helping Alex only seems to go along with their hopes of getting reelected. McDowell does in fact 'get cured.' But how different is the end of the movie from the start now? If anything, McDowell has more material to blackmail the government with now.<br /><br />Not only is this movie a masterpiece on social awareness, but the soundtrack is great too. I highly suggest it.</p></br><a href="../users/A27RJ30RN5K9MX.html">A27RJ30RN5K9MX</a><br/><p>The story is set in a near future society that has unthinkable methods of crime and punishment. Alex ( Malcolm McDowell)is a man that loves to fight, rob, rape, and kill. However, his luck finally runs out and he is captured. While imprisoned, he undergoes treatment to render him &quot; safe&quot; to the world around him, which is refered to as a &quot; Clockwork Orange&quot;. While Alex is made to look perfectly normal on the outside, he is crippled by reflex mechanisms beyond his control on the inside. This prevents him from committing any acts of violence whatsoever. After Alex's release, things go from bad to worse however, when his &quot;cure&quot; leaves him defenseless to the revenge of his victims. <p>&quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; is Stanley Kubrick's best film, and one of my favorite films overall. It is one of those movies that you can watch over and over again, and still be amazed everytime. I have never been as shocked as I was when I saw this film. The first 20 minutes involves two brutal beatings and an extremely graphic rape scene. It only gets more shocking from there on out. The story also offers a hilarious sense of irony. Alex is supposedly cured of all his afflictions, but is thrust back into a world of violence when forced to deal with his victims. The camera work used in this film is amazing, and the music is wonderful. All of the actors do an outstanding job in this film, but Malcom McDowell gives one of the most memorable performances ever as Alex. I have never experienced such a use of my emotions before when dealing with a fictional character. He will make you hate him and shock you with how he acts before he is captured. But then Alex makes you feel almost sorry for him with what he has to go through afterwards. <p>Stanley Kubrick has made some great movies with &quot;2001: A Space Oddesey&quot;, &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot;, &quot;Barry Lyndon&quot;, &quot;Paths of Glory&quot;, and &quot;Dr. Strangelove....&quot; In my opinion however, &quot; A Clockwork Orange&quot; is his best film. The overall story, acting, music, camera work, and truly shocking scenes set it apart from the rest. It is definately a must own, because it only gets better with repeated viewings. The DVD however, is very mediocre. The quality of the film itself is just above average, and there are no extras at all.</p></br><a href="../users/A1435P5AMCPB3X.html">A1435P5AMCPB3X</a><br/><p>First off, this was not an easy bood to make into a movie, but Stanly Kubrick did an excellent job of doing so, not cutting out too many of the details either.  This movie was way ahead of it's time, with excellent cinemetography, great acting, and excellent adaptation to script of a book that tells a tale of young Alex and his gang in a world he live raise "ultraviolence".  A nice glimpse into the mind of an Antisocial.  Rent this, Buy this, worth owning.  One of the many of a series of Excellent Kubrick films of the 70's.</p></br><a href="../users/A18MBO1U4DPY20.html">A18MBO1U4DPY20</a><br/><p>I just saw A CLOCKWORK ORANGE last night and what strikes me about it is how unpreachy it is despite being extremely well stretched out.You see,Kubrick's vision is extraordinary and often misunderstood. There is no real moral base he seeks to induce from his films and this is possibly why this movie is such an enjoyable watch.(i might be wrong i should add cause this was my first watch) For all those, who seek humor from this movie and enjoyed Clockwork Orange just for the humor bit,friends,I dare say, you don't deserve to watch films of this high a statute. Without trying to sound too much like a prude, "A Clockwork Orange" is gripping,unabrasive,interesting and big yet not ready for an immediate second watch.<br /><br />The characters in the film are few and simple, the dialogue writing is of supreme nature and the sets are extraordinarily rich with chaos and flamboyance of color. The first fifteen minutes of the film brought quite a jolt of shock to me owing to the graphic nature depicted. Interestingly enough, the main character is a huge Beethoven fan and has a life without pauses and limits. WHERE THE FILM SCORES FULL MARKS is in the character of Alex,who is one easy to dislike rodent.Somehow his narration is extremely likeable.<br /><br />Second most interesting character in this film would be the old man on the wheel chair and his crazy fatigued lifestyle. Everyone in this movie other than Alex is dislikeable as far as storyline makes you beleive. My favourite scene in the film would have to be a choice between Alexander's moodshift when he's sent to prison and his torture scenes OR the beginning of the movie where his rather scarily determined eyes pierce the watcher.<br /><br />Overall, I wouldnt be shameful enough to rate this. Yes, it is a classic that is not gonna die soon. I'll read the book in a year's time.</p></br><a href="../users/A3HM5G9IV1FTFP.html">A3HM5G9IV1FTFP</a><br/><p>I just watched "A Clockwork Orange" again for the first time in fourteen years. The last time I watched it I was only 15, so clearly my impression of it at this point in my life is different. Even at 15, I found the violence to be disturbing and not at all funny, and understood on some level that the main characer, Alex, despite his "rehabilitation", still had to pay the price for the vicious crimes he commits in the beginning of the film. At 29, this karmic theme makes even more sense to me. Despite being rendered incapable of violence due to the experimental treatment he receives, Alex still doesn't understand the consequences of his actions, and can't see his crimes from the perspective of his victims. So although the government's "treatment" may keep violent criminals from committing more violent crimes, it does nothing to treat the spiritual illness of a society who still, at it's core, rewards aggressiveness and believes that "might makes right".<br /><br />What I certainly didn't appreciate at 15 were the stunning and provocative visuals of the film. Instead of creating a future full of high-tech gadgets, Kubrick fills the scenary with imagery suggesting mannequin-like sexuality and soulless, tacky modernism. Even Alex's gang uniform (lipstick, false eyelash, jockstrap, combat boots) suggests phony, plastic beauty combined with aggressiveness and insanity.<br /><br />Although I believe that "Clockwork" and "Eyes Wide Shut" are the only Kubrick films I've seen so far, I can see from both of these brilliant films why he's widely considered to be a genius filmmaker.</p></br><a href="../users/A34D06JL7LC6MU.html">A34D06JL7LC6MU</a><br/><p>A Clockwork Orange is one of three films, along with Dr. Strangelove and 2001: A Space Odyssey, generally regarded as Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece and is probably my personal favorite of the three. Adapted from Anthony Burgess' 1962 novel of the same name, A Clockwork Orange is a violent, controversial film with some of the most iconic images in cinematic history and is easily the most accessible of those three Kubrick films. The film satirizes society, politics, and is also (like many Kubrick films) deeply philosophical. In addition, it's also one of the most surreal and endlessly fascinating films ever made.<br /><br />The film opens iconically with a close-up of the anti-hero protagonist and narrator Alex (Malcolm McDowell) and slowly pulls back to reveal his three droogs (Pete, Georgie, and Dim) sitting in the Korova Milk Bar where they are enjoying "milk plus" before embarking on a night fraught with "ultra-violence." Alex and his droogs wreak havoc in thoroughly immoral ways, beginning with the beating of an elderly vagrant and concluding with a home-invasion and rape, the latter performed while Alex joyfully sings "Singin' in the Rain." When he's not terrorizing the countryside by night, Alex is shown religiously listening to the music of Ludwig van Beethoven and inviting some girls back to his house to participate in a bit of the old "in-out, in-out." After Alex is betrayed by his droogs and sentenced to a 14-year stay in prison, he is given the chance to participate in a new experiment that will see his sentence commuted by brainwashing him into being unable to commit such atrocities.<br /><br />In addition to being a novelist, Burgess was also a linguist and the characters in A Clockwork Orange speak in Nadsat, slang comprised of Russian, English, and Cockney rhyming slang. For the adaptation, this remained intact and is one of the film's most indelible aspects. It's one of the reasons that the film is so memorable and timeless, as well as a contributor to what makes it so original. The brilliance of the story comes from Burgess, but the brilliance of the film is all Kubrick. A Clockwork Orange does not simply function on the foundation of having a brilliant story, but on the way that story is conveyed. This is one of the best assembled films ever made with one amazing scene consistently following another.<br /><br />The term "film composition" is never more appropriate than when discussing the works of Stanley Kubrick, as he treated each film like a musical composition with each piece falling perfectly into place at the precise moment. The composition of this film is masterful, perfect and it maintains an atmosphere so unlike any other film. Speaking of musical composition, it's impossible to separate this film and its spellbinding effect from the music of Ludwig van Beethoven that makes up a large part of the film's score. It may be a bold statement, but those looking for a perfect film need look no further. There is never a dull moment in A Clockwork Orange and this is not simply because of a compelling story, but because of the spell the film casts with performances that are like choreographed dance and the production design/art direction (by John Barry, Russell Hagg, and Peter Sheilds) that is truly a thing of beauty. There is not a single film in all of history that looks like this one and it's one of the best looking films you'll ever see.<br /><br />The whole cast give pitch-perfect performances and, typical once again of Kubrick films, several minor supporting roles are populated with actors who stand out substantially due to their little quirks. McDowell gives the performance of a lifetime as Alex, the role that made him an icon in addition to leaving him forever typecast. Shades of the character are noticeable in McDowell's earlier performance in If..., the film that inspired Kubrick to cast him, but it's a fully-realized, simultaneously comical and menacing performance here and it's doubtful that anyone could have pulled it off as marvelously as McDowell. He appears in every scene and carries the entire film on his shoulders with his mannerisms, voice, and movement, all of which are partly responsible for keeping the audience glued to the screen. In minor roles, the most unforgettable are arguably Patrick Magee (as F. Alexander, the writer whose home is invaded early on) and Aubrey Morris (as probation officer P.R. Deltoid). Deltoid's high-strung, comically nervous way of adding "mmm...yes" to the end of every sentence and Magee's creepy and unforgettable transformation from a quiet writer to a madman make these performances stand out even with very little screen time.<br /><br />I'm not the first person to say it nor will I be the last, but A Clockwork Orange is a work of art and stands as one of the best films ever made. Nothing in Kubrick's oeuvre remotely resembles it and yet it's so thoroughly Kubrick's work; a film that casts a spell on you with its biting originality and carries you through a cinematic world so uniquely its own. Kubrick began as a photographer and that profession largely contributes to why so many iconic, unforgettable images spawn from his films. Kubrick, possibly more so than any other director, knew how to point a camera at a particular image and get the most effective shot from it. Nearly every frame of this film is perfect from a photographic standpoint and easily has the best opening and closing shots of any film I can readily recall.<br /><br />It's a film that, with its political, societal, and moral implications, makes you think. It's a film that continues to cast a spell after repeated viewings; a film that still manages to entertain, shock, and excite. It remains, as it did at the time of its release, a controversial, subversive, and brilliant film that even the casual filmgoer cannot help but be drawn to. 40 years after it was made and there are still not enough adjectives to accurately convey how blisteringly original, brave, and immersive it is. With this recent Blu-Ray release, you're able to experience the film all over again and it's never looked or sounded better. Like nearly all of his films, this one had the Kubrick touch and, as such, it's pure cinematic gold.<br /><br />GRADE: A</p></br><a href="../users/AO461REE0KA4J.html">AO461REE0KA4J</a><br/><p>While comparing the new remastered DVD and the old DVD of A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, I discovered that the new transfer shows MORE picture on the left and right sides, but LESS at the bottom. The difference in picture amount is not great, but, to me, great enough to affect the composition.  In the scene where Alex kicks his friends into the river in slow motion, some of the toes are cut off due to the less picture at the bottom.  I wouldn't be surprised if this DVD would be re-released again.<p>To me the biggest improvement on the new transfer of ACO is the flesh tones -- they look more realistic, and complexions are generally rosier (although I have to wonder that, for such a dark subject matter, does healthier-looking skin tone enhance the theme of the movie?). Other improvements are the elimination of the graininess, speckles, and other blemishes. The darker scenes (many scenes take place at night and in low-light condition) don't show much improvement at all.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PBV1899CX3TE.html">A2PBV1899CX3TE</a><br/><p>I saw that there were 699 reviews of this film, and much as I like that number, I had to weigh in and make it an even 700. Stanley Kubrick directed this, and if he ever goes to Film Hell for Eyes Wide Shut, this will more than make up for it, at least it will get him into purgatory.<br /><br />Anthony Burgess wrote this in response to hearing about some controversial techniques that were proposed as a solution to the problem of teen violence, specifically the Mod vs. Rocker battles that were also the subject of The Who's Quadraphenia.<br /><br />The book is written entirely in Nadsat, which is a slanguage invented by Burgess that contains Russian words, Gypsy argot, Cockney rhyming slang (where a word is substituted for another that rhymes with it, or is connected somehow to the rhyming word, so the original connection is lost and only another Cockney would understand the reference) and other teen age slang words all mixed together. A glossary is included, but soon you'll have no need for it.<br /><br />Malcolm McDowell does a great performance, though he is much older than 15, the supposed age of the Beethoven lovin' hooligan, Alex. He has a certain boyish charm, and the panache to carry it off.<br /><br />This film is a lot like V for Vendetta, in that it could work as an action film, or be enjoyed on a deeper level as a thought provoking essay on society, violence, and classical music. In both movies the cinematic violence is exhilarating, really good use of the music to enhance the excitement, and just an artistic stylized look that draws you in to the strange dystopia of the future.<br /><br />Some people will be put off by the violence, but it is not merely gratuitous, but essential to the story, and in fact, the subject at hand. You could say Oliver Stone fell into that trap in Natural Born Killers, trying to make a statement about how the media glorifies and exploits violence, and in so doing just glorifying and exploiting it even more, but Stanley Kubrick has dodged that bullet--at least he dodged it until Eyes Wide Shut.</p></br><a href="../users/A20LY8E9NGYA4M.html">A20LY8E9NGYA4M</a><br/><p>One of the biggest complaints about "A Clockwork Orange", is the use of excessive violence. It's a shame, but let's face it: the violence is part of the human nature, it's an ugly side of our behavior, but it's useless to pretend that someone can't have violent thoughts once in a while. So I recommend to all those people that blame movies (like "A Clockwork Orange") for the violence all around the world, please read any Universal History book. Perhaps you might realize that the human race has a violent side by nature: wars, territorial invasions, betrayals, you name it, violence was here before the movies. "A Clockwork Orange" explores the violent side of the human being.<p>"A Clockwork Orange" shows the dark side of our nature, and the attempts made by the society to repress that dark side through the excessive control of the individuals. The main character, Alex (Malcolm McDowell, in a very charismatic performance) is a young man that enjoys life, but with violence and excesses. Usually, a character like Alex would be hated by the audience, but our antihero is so human, with so many sides, attitudes and personalities, that without a doubt he is an excellent example of the complexity of the human being.<p>One of the readings of "A Clockwork Orange" is: every person has a negative side and a positive side, everybody. Throughout the movie, we see that Alex is more than a bully, he is a person with all the flaws, needs and suffering, proper of the human being. Also, in "A Clockwork Orange", we can see that all our actions will have consequences, no matter if we act right or wrong. Alex acts wrong, but he also pays a high price in the movie.<p>One of the strongest highlights in "A Clockwork Orange" is the masterful use of music to improve the scenes. Music by Beethoven, Rossini, Walter Carlos and, oh yeah, a disturbing version of "Singing In The Rain", helped to create some of the most memorable scenes in film history. <p>"A Clockwork Orange" is one of the most important films of all time, in most of film critics "100 best movies of all-time" lists, we can read the name "A Clockwork Orange", proof of the transcendence of the movie. It's also the best movie made by Stanley Kubrick (in my humble opinion). It has a little of everything: action, comedy, satire, drama, excellent music, very creative dialogues, a very charismatic central character, and oh yeah, something that may confuse people that enjoy movies with MTV pace and one page scripts: A PLOT. If you can't notice the excellent portrait of the complexity of the human being in this film, I recommend you to try "American Pie", "Ernest Goes To Jail" or "Gigli". The rest of us, let's enjoy "A Clockwork Orange".</p></br><a href="../users/AT07UZQQR7ZEH.html">AT07UZQQR7ZEH</a><br/><p>[CAUTION: SCATTERED PLOT SPOILERS THROUGHOUT THIS ENTIRE ESSAY. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED:)  I first saw Stanley Kubrick's brilliant, but disturbing A CLOCKWORK ORANGE (1971) in late 1971 at the Hollywood Pacific Theater in downtown Hollywood.  I was an optimistic college student about to turn 21.  The movie overwhelmed and elated me.  I thought it was the greatest movie I had ever seen.  And the "X" rating gave it a forbidden fruit bonus that made several young women from my dorm asking me if I would take them to it because I was just a friend and they did not want to see it with their boyfriends.  During 1972, CLOCKWORK was THE movie for adult moviegoers to see; it played at the Hollywood Pacific for months on end.  I was literally seeing it every month and finding something new and fresh with each viewing.  I was the same age as punk protagonist Alex (Malcolm McDowell in the performance he has never topped) and found something imaginative about the use of music constantly, the set design, the editing, and the circular and ironic film structure.  It somehow did not bother me that I was watching hoodlums beating up and sometimes accidentally killing innocent people after drinking hallucinogenic milk; I just loved the interior of the Korova Milkbar and the writer and his wife being raped to "Singin' in the Rain".  And with Gene Kelly's rendition of "Singin' in the Rain" over the colorful closing credits, I left the theater feeling elated after 137 minutes.  And it wasn't just me.  Reviews were mostly raves for Christmas Week 1971.  The movie won Best Picture and Director of the Year awards from the New York Film Critics.  And it got four Oscar nominations, including Picture and Director.  One of my film professors at UCLA even offered extra credit to anyone who saw CLOCKWORK in Hollywood and turned in a halfway-intelligent review; I got an A.<br /><br />But we all grow up.  The very same print of CLOCKWORK ORANGE-OK, a few frames of nudity were trimmed in two places to get a ludicrous "R" rating-that enthralled me as a college student of 21 now terrifies me as a middle-aged movie scholar of 54.  The copy of the movie I own on VHS tape has only been played three times in the last decade, including once before writing this essay.  The film's near future of 1986 is now the past.  It is admittedly fun to see the kitchen with four colors of wallpaper, Mom with a purple wig and red raincoat, the glass tables with metal bases, and a record shop that still sells videocassettes and LP records.  The high-speed sex scene with two girls and "The William Tell Overture" remains a delight for me.<br /><br />But Alex's crimes are horrendous to me now.  I do not enjoy them, even with the creative use of music to distance us.  When the State imprisons Alex and  puts him through the Ludovico mind-altering technique in the movie's middle section, I now root for the State to win, not Alex.  I have been a patient myself in my share of hospitals, including for two heart attacks.  The doctors and nurses seem sympathetic.  And the ironic twist finale troubles me now at age 54.  It leaves me with a queasy feeling, not euphoric.  Same piece of celluloid for 137 minutes, but three decades later in emotional growth.  And then there is Malcolm McDowell doing two different short-lived, but welcome TV series with white hair and smiles to reassure us that he is not Alex anymore.  It was only a role, albeit the role of his career.<br /><br />(CAUTION:  NON-STOP  PLOT SPOILERS!  BEWARE!}  For those who have never experienced CLOCKWORK ORANGE in a theater or on home video, let me brace you for what to expect.  Ghostly music plays on the soundtrack as we track back from Alex and his two pals (droogs) drinking milk laced with hallucinogenic drugs in a milkbar with reclining white nude women sculptures as far as the eye can see; customers gets a refill by pressing a button below each sculpture's purple private parts.  Then a gang rape follows the beating up of a tramp under a night bridge.  A glass house where a writer and his wife live is then invaded by the three hoodlums.  Alex kicks at the writer as he happily sings "Singin' in the Rain" and rapes the wife after knocking over bookshelves.  Then the gang goes home.  Alex lives in downtown slum apartments with obscene graffiti on broken elevators.  Climbing the stairs he places a pet snake named Basil on his bed and plays Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, his favorite, happily on audiocassette.  A visit from his probation officer in the morning is followed by a fight and accidental murder by Alex with a woman who has a lot of cats and a lot of hilariously obscene sculptures, such as a white penis and testicles; that is a murder weapon.  But Alex is arrested outside the house, tricked  by his two droogie friends.  And we are now 45 minutes into a 137 minute movie that falls into three neat parts.  I give out this much plot because of friends who have given up on the movie after 20 minutes of non-stop violence and sex scenes with pubic hair.  Walk out on this movie before it ends, and you will miss the whole troubling and ironic point of it.<br /><br />(MORE DETAILED PLOT SPOILERS:)  The second third of CLOCKWORK ORANGE mostly leaves behind sex and violence.  Arrested for the accidental murder of the catwoman, Alex is now a prisoner of the State.  Scenes throughout are hospital corridors and rooms with sympathetic staff for me.  This is not a traditional prison at all.  And Alex is very sympathetic as he reads the Bible (though he likes the sex and violence parts) and trying to be a model prisoner.  After a couple of years, he volunteers as a guinea pig for something new the State has up its sleeve-the Lodovico Technique, brainwashing to abhor all sex and violence.  We see a few of these sessions-Alex with his eyes propped open being forced to watch a brutal rape film (this got very slightly trimmed to get the "R" rating in America) and I think a scene from TRIUMPH OF THE WILL (1934).  But an Alex supposedly all cured of sex and violence does not really succeed before an auditorium gathering.  Will the program backfire?<br /><br /> (STILL SOME MORE PLOT SPOILERS:)  We are now about 90 minutes into the movie, with roughly 45 minutes left to go.  This is where the movie gets mind-bogglingly and dazzlingly ironic.  The program has rough side-effects for Alex, who becomes an abused victim by some of his former tormentors.  Look what has happened<br />to Alex's two buddies and what they do to him.  The writer shows up again in a stunningly ironic scene with an even more imaginative and ironic payoff, leading us to a controversial final fifteen minutes or so.  I still think it is a happy ending, maybe because it has five minutes of closing credits with colored card name backgrounds and Gene Kelly doing "Singin' in the Rain"on the soundtrack,<br /><br />Two things are for sure:  The fearless Malcolm McDowell should have won the Oscar he was not even nominated for, and CLOCKWORK ORANGE is a masterpiece of audacious and endlessly creative filmmaking by one of our greatest filmmakers.  This is Stanley Kubrick's greatest film for me in terms of writing and pure filmmaking and provocative ideas, even as it still terrifies me.  I try to watch it on VHS tape in a darkened night bedroom to evoke the grand single-screen Hollywood Pacific Theater in 1972 when I was only 21, but it is hard. We are all older now-and hopefully wiser.  If you think you are up to it, CLOCKWORK ORANGE is a staggering and overwhelming video rental evening-and sells on DVD for only $14.95.<br /><br />[...]</p></br><a href="../users/A3O2RCKAMSE9X7.html">A3O2RCKAMSE9X7</a><br/><p>Movies that seem to focus on one apparent theme or set of visuals usually do not stand up to the ravages of time.  Whenever a director builds his movie on that single element, then if that element is no longer in synch with future audiences, this movie dates badly.  With A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, director Stanley Kubrick made sure this would not happen.  Kubrick took the novel by Anthony Burgess and squeezed out the ultra violence that characterized the nihilistic teens of a vaguely futuristic England and grafted it onto the big screen.  Malcolm McDowell as Alex the Droog is a walking trunk of unleashed anger that feels unbound by the laws of morality that bind the rest of the world.  To him, the world exists only to serve as the backdrop against which he plays out his fantasies of sex and violence.  For Alex, as his inability to distinguish Beethoven from brutality indicates, is similarly unable to recognize that the violence that he sees daily on the screens of his milkbars originates not from them but from within himself.  <p>The novel suggests that Alex's violence is a learned response to the violence of a harsh world that is even more morally empty than Orwell's Oceania.  Kubrick implies that if violence is the problem then more violence is the solution.  If there ever were an unregenerate soul it is the teen Alex, and if any technique could regenerate him, then that technique ought to be seriously considered for widespread use.  The problem with that is that Kubrick's use of sight and sound mask the inner villainy of a solution that is, at least on the Christian level, as bad as the disease.  Human beings are human, not because they can do both good and evil, but because they are free to choose either.  When Alex is sufficiently brainwashed, what emerges is not a de-violenced Alex, but a totally different young man who only looks like his amoral predecessor but with whom he has nothing in common.  This Alex reminds one of nothing less than a morally inverted character from any novel from the Marquis de Sade.  If one can unlearn violence and have that process hailed, then the reversal of that same process can be hailed too--if one also believes that free willed evil is preferable to forced good.  <p>Such weighty issues of free will versus predetermination stamp A CLOCKWORK ORANGE as far more than the astounding melange of surreal violence accompanied by classical music that many critics have either praised it as thoughtful or condemned it as mindless.  What both the book and film emphasize is that if a thug like Alex can choose evil over good, then it is far better for society to punish him than punish the rest of us by forcing him to tread a path that to him might have once seemed ugly beyond belief.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZLROGIL2V7GV.html">A2ZLROGIL2V7GV</a><br/><p>"A Clockwork Orange" is a haunting and disturbing look into the future.  This is a classic that just goes to show you how great films can be.  There is no equal to this movie.  This is a movie that must be seen by all movie lovers.<p>Alex is a troubled youth, who plays hookey and hangs around with his friends, (or "droogs, as he calls them).  They are the most reckless, violent, offensive, and careless sort who feels no sympathy for anyone or anything.  Well, all of that changes one night when Alex is caught up in an accidental murder and is sent to prison.  He is then found eligible for a rehabilitation program, which proves to take its toll on the young hoodlum.  This is a dark and briliant film, which also proves to be a bit of a satire about governments and rehab programs.<p>I loved this movie.  It was directed by Stanley Kubrick, who never missed a beat when it came to directing haunting and disturbing films that enhances the brain.  The images are disturbing and beautiful at the same time.  Malcom McDowell is a fine actor in this movie, spewing out dialogue that sounds like poetry.<p>I know this DVD set is tough to find, but if you can, it's worth it.  Though, there are no different special features, the picture is remastered and the second disk is the soundtrack.<p>Most memorable scene in the movie:  When Alex and the gang are beating up a couple in their home.  As he is kicking and stomping the man, he is singing "Singin' in the Rain."  What once was something so innocent and sweet is transformed into something so hideous and violent.  I loved it!<p>This is what film making is all about.  I plan to read the book as soon as I can.  "A Clockwork Orange," is, and will forever be, a true classic.  This movie is flawless, or at least I think so.  If you are a movie lover of true classics, see this movie as soon as you can.  If you've already seen it, SEE IT AGAIN!  It's nice to know that there are still quality films out there that actually feed the mind.  Beautiful and perfect in every way.<p>P.S.  We will forever miss you, Stanley Kubrick.  Your genius is missed by all.</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>Stanley Kubrick's "A Clockwork Orange" is a dark, brutal satire of the youth culture of the 70's a sort of inversion of the "peace, love" generation that preceded it that captures the narcissitic 80's a full decade before the "Me" culture of greed and self involvement took center stage.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this is the same transfer as the previous Blu-ray disc and some clips from the new documentary stuff looks better than THIS transfer. This transfer doesn't look horrible BUT WHY Warner didn't include the 4K new transfer they just did for the new theatrical showing is beyond me. They could have very easily because they didn't just throw the old disc from the previous set into new packaging.<br /><br />What's in this edition?<br /><br />This latest 40 anniversary two disc edition features the same transfer as the previous edition so if you are looking for an upgrade the image quality is exactly the same encode (although freeing up some of the disc space may have improved the quality slightly I didn't see it). We also get a lossless DTS 5.1 mix rather than the uncompressed LPCM soundtrack--the only difference is the latter consumes less disc space but they are comparable in quality.  The inclusion of the previous transfer isn't necessarily a bad thing as Warner did an exceptional job and the additional room on the disc allows for a very slight improvement for the film. Keep in mind that "A Clockwork Orange" is a 40 year old film and, as such, it looks quite good and striking for its age but it's unlikely to look like it was shot yesterday. There's plenty of fine grain on display as well giving the presentation a nice, striking quality.<br /><br />The real reason to upgrade this if you are a fan of the movie and Kubrick is the inclusion of Jan Harlan's documentary on Kubrick (Harlan was Kubrick's brother-in-law and co-producer for many of his films)on disc two. It's an exceptional documentary that was previously only available in the Stanley Kubrick DVD boxed set from a couple of years back. It is, however, presented in standard definition. All of the special features from the previous single disc Blu-ray have been retained.<br /><br />Ported over from the previous edition is the documentary "O Lucky Malcolm" (referring to another dark satire that the star Malcolm McDowell was involved in "O Lucky Man")but not on disc two. "O Lucky Malcolm" is presented in HD.<br /><br />We also get the excellent commentary from Nick Redman and McDowell that is both enlightening and an intelligent take on the meaning of the film now and then.<br /><br />We also get some new special features in high def but including one with McDowell recalling working on the film while flipping through production photos and another where he recites Alex's opening speech as other directors discuss how our world reflects the world of the movie (It does and it doesn't. It's also much more complex than that)and how it influenced other films.<br /><br />Finally there's the "book"--the Blu-ray discs are housed in a hardcover book with production photos.<br /><br />Kubrick's adaption of Burgess' novel is a sort of  inverted Pygmalion. As brilliant as Burgess' novel, the film brings some of the best sequences in the  novel to life with stunning, brutal clarity and satiric wit. Burgess himself  acknowledged as much stating that Kubrick's film was a "radical  remaking of my own novel" that was every bit Kubrick's as the source  material was Burgess.<br /><br />Kubrick's  most controversial film ( perhaps even more so than Lolita), this is a  classic film that is a radical as mainstream cinema gets.<br /><br />The bottom line: Should you buy this again if you have the single disc Blu-ray? I'd say no unless you don't have the Kubrick documentary which is excellent (although it would have been nice to see that upgraded to HD)and the few new featurettes included. The price difference may make a difference in that decision as well since this is a bit more expensive than the original single disc edition. If you don't have it--get it but if you have the previous single disc edition (unless you must have the excellent documentary "A Life in Pictures" about Kubrick), I'd skip this edition and spent your money on something new like the forthcoming reissues of "Lolita" and "Barry Lyndon".<br /><br />If you have the previous edition--wait until they reissue this with the 4K upgrade for the Blu-ray edition.</p></br><a href="../users/A2SLA0SXRQV8M0.html">A2SLA0SXRQV8M0</a><br/><p>Justly regarded as a landmark film, this disturbing and violent movie by Stanley Kubrick - stunningly filmed and still shocking after forty years - has been so talked about and overanalyzed that there is probably not much more to say. But let me add a few thoughts about A Clockwork Orange, after having recently seen it again after perhaps some twenty years.<br /><br />First, the movie has three clear and differentiated acts. In the first act, we see Alex and his gang commit outrageous acts of violence, rape and eventually murder against helpless citizens in a futuristic London. In the second act, Alex is caught and sent to prison, where he is "cured" through an aversion method called the Ludovico technique (involving basically the infliction of pain and nausea on Alex when he is forced to see violent acts in a movie). The third act sees Alex being rereleased into society, supposedly cured, but he will find it impossible to reintegrate himself to society. If the first act is a clear masterpiece (perhaps the best thing that Kubrick ever made), and the second act is very powerful, the third act I found wanting. It's as if Kubrick (or for that matter, author Anthony Burgess) wasn't very sure about how to wrap the story or what particular message he wanted to give forward.<br /><br />Lastly, and about the message of the film, there has been some debate on whether this is a right wing (conservative) film or is it a left wing (liberal) film. My feeling is that it cannot be put safely in any of the two categories. Kubrick was too idiosyncratic a director to be put into a neat ideological label. Thus, while the movie's radical critique of contemporary western society might put it in the left category, its skepticism that criminals can be "cured", can be seen as a conservative position. Also conservative might be its skepticism about whether any government bureaucracy can have good intentions toward the people.</p></br><a href="../users/A1V3PCKVCJ3TTZ.html">A1V3PCKVCJ3TTZ</a><br/><p>It is impossible to explain this movie to someone.  They have to watch it to even come close to understanding it.  I first saw it in the theater in the early 70's when you had to sneak in due to the rating.  I think the last time I watched it was in the 90's and I still loved it.  What I love about it, is what seems to be the timelessness of it.  Who knows how far in the future this is supposed to happen, however you can see the warning signs of Clockwork Orange in every decade we've had.  Someday, this will happen.  For me, the seminal (pun intended) point is a person's basic nature is what it is and no amount of therapy, rehab, medication, or counseling will change them.  Some members in society are just born "bad seeds" and there is nothing you can do about it.  Because of the Beethoven based, British double-speak in the dialog, it might take you some time to fully understand what is being said.  Once you get into it and take it as an alternative future culture...you'll be fine.  Whether you are a bit twisted in the head after seeing it...well that is the chance you take.</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>*** This comment may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />Friends are shocked when I tell them I find this movie fascinating and enjoy watching it every five years or so. They all think this is a very sick, shocking and just plain revolting movie. Hey, I understand that. When this film was released almost four decades ago, it was highly controversial. Even though nudity is nothing new in films today, I suspect this story still shocks a lot of people. It isn't just the nudity but the carefree-sadistic attitude of the main character that is repulsive to many.<br /><br />The vocabulary and the creepiness of lead actor Malcolm McDowell's character "Alexander de Large" is like nothing I have ever heard and seen on film. I play the DVD now with the subtitles on to understand all the strange words and expressions McDowell uses as he narrates this story. That dialog, too, is still unique and probably always will be.<br /><br />A big attraction for me or the wild visuals. The outrageous colors in here from the clothing McDowell and his gang wore, to the futuristic house interiors and sets, are still something to see! I think this is director Stanley Kubrick's best work, cinematography-wise, which is why - when I saw the first 10 minutes on Blu-Ray at a store, I was disappointed it wasn't that sharp.<br /><br />Yes, the violence is shocking but that sets up the main storyline: dealing with that kind of mentality (a sick thug with no apparent conscience). What ensues in the story is almost as disturbing - and thought-provoking.  After "Alex" is captured, he is a part of new experiment to cure violent and overly sexual tendencies. The scenes of his "rehabililation" aren't always easy to watch. He then returns to the street and is almost killed by his former victims who "accidently" run into him. Things get so bad Alex" tries to kill himself, so the media gives him a big splash and they de-program him back to his normal sick self and the movie ends abruptly with Alex a happy man again. How twisted is that?? A rapist homicidal maniac is set free and the government is made to look stupid? Well, since this comes from Kubrick, that's not surprising. But, this film probably was interpreted in numerous ways and was an interesting discussion-starter.<br /><br />In summary, a perverted story but the one-of-a-kind lead character, famous visuals and sets and interesting message always make this film watchable, but be warned: this is a brutal and often uncomfortable movie to watch.</p></br><a href="../users/A2C7BOQVFH1HLE.html">A2C7BOQVFH1HLE</a><br/><p>This movie is truly timeless and although certain elements betray its age e.g. use of cassettes in the future instead of cds, use of a typewriter instead of a desktop pc by the writer etc, this film transcends time and its message is still very thought-provoking and evokes strong responses from viewers just like modern avant-garde artworks are supposed to.  From "Dr. Strangelove" to "2001: A Space Odyssey" to this, Stanley Kubrick's brilliant directing genius can only be described as producing cinematic high works of art.  Just like in the great "2001:...", Kubrick forces you to think about serious issues, stunning and shocking you to come to your own conclusions and to stimulate your senses all the while refusing to tell you what to think.<br /><br />Some may feel Alex got off too easy and for all his major offences against society should be severely punished ala capital punishment and may actually come to this conclusion from watching the film.  Others may actually feel sorry for and happy for Alex that he returns to "normal" and that the powers that be get what they deserve with the threat of a loss of power.  Either way, the film disturbs you enough to elicit strong responses making it difficult to remain indifferent or to not have an opinion which is the definition of good modern art.<br /><br />This film could also be a metaphor for thought control and governance asking the question: is it proper to force people to accept an ideology even if they don't truly believe it themselves?  Whether it is Communism or even Capitalism or any religion should people be given a choice which one to go with or should society take all steps to penalise even to the point of using physical pain and suffering to ensure compliance?  It is telling at the end when Alex becomes "healed" only when he realises that the very powers that are trying to "heal" him are sick and maybe even sicker than he is; a different sort of corruption but corruption nonetheless.<br /><br />This film as time has shown is the true winner of the Oscar for the Best Picture, Director and Actor awards for that year and how "The French Connection" won for these categories is beyond belief.  This film is certainly a lot more rewarding on so many levels and has certainly aged a lot better to rank among the best ever films.<br /><br />The great news is that the digital restoration and remastering has been done very well making both the picture and sound quality of this dvd very, very good indeed.  Although the Special Features are nothing to speak about, I'm hoping the newly-released Blu-Ray version will have extras such as making-of and other sorts of documentaries as well.<br /><br />By far a film masterpiece by the great Kubrick and a must-have for every film buff's dvd library.<br /><br />Highly recommended!</p></br><a href="../users/AJUFIGATSP9AQ.html">AJUFIGATSP9AQ</a><br/><p>i've always loved this film and I think the BD looks and sounds great ( I think the dolby mix is better ) The BluRay  is the best I have ever seen the film and it took me back to  the 71 first week showing on Broadway. It will be released with better sound some day; but this one is already pumped up a bit so go for it. The content does bother some people but the story, the drama, the style, the visual/music presentation make a bitter pill go down well. I miss Kubrick.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EOYN87MMNHL1.html">A3EOYN87MMNHL1</a><br/><p>I thought this movie was "IT" in Seventy-Two, and I even had the soundtrack on an eight-track tape. Those of you of a certain age know what happens to eight-track tapes--they eventually start double-tracking, or the tape player eats them.  Precision splicing will give them a few more month's play time which I attempted in desperation. I always had it in the back of my head to get a copy of the movie, and I did, and viewed it a few month's back.  Malcolm McDowell is perfect as is the sound-track a perfect accompaniment. The costuming is FAB. Although the sets, which seemed ultra-futuristic at the time seem retro- Seventies now, it is still a great movie--I think Kubrick's best.</p></br><a href="../users/AER15RIMV8E6D.html">AER15RIMV8E6D</a><br/><p>I like this movie because of the storyline and it's dark, creepy, and has the classic look of the 1970's.

Nevertheless, his chilly vision of a morally ambiguous future world picked up Oscar nods for Best Picture and Director. Outfitted in a bowler hat, white jumpsuit, and codpiece, McDowell gives an iconic performance as Alex, a gleeful connoisseur of brutality who enjoys warbling "Singin' in the Rain" while committing vile acts. A cynical but stylish sci-fi cult hit, "Orange" is a disturbing yet intriguing film in a class all its own.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UYAFQ40U2PHS.html">A2UYAFQ40U2PHS</a><br/><p>I saw this film when I was in high school (I tricked my mother into renting it for me...she's so sweet), and I have never forgotten it. It's always a toss up between this film and 2001: A Space Odyssey over which Kubrick film is better (2001 is winning right now).  It was a bit heady for a high school teen (even one like me who was already searching out intelligent cinema), but I always thought it was a masterpiece.  Many people talk (and talk) about its violence, and they usually miss the satire and the sadness of the story.  McDowell gives his best performance ever, and Kubrick proves why he is the master that he is.  You feel real empathy for Alex, despite his being a monster (or just a man who embraces his dark nature).  I feel that there's an actual point to all the violence in the film.  Just one small quip: I didn't like the trough scene (even though upon further reflection, it is an ironic scene in that Alex attacked Dim and Georgie earlier in the film at a marina filled with dirty water).  There's no way Alex would have been able to hold his breath under the water because he gets sick whenever violence is done upon him.<br /><br />Most people who see the film love this film for the violence, and ignore the substance of the film.  I am not one for liking films that are just violent for violence sake.  The film is a film of ideas as well as emotions.  It's about free will, the power of the state, the true nature of man, etc., etc..  It's another challenging piece of cinema from one of the greatest directors of all time.  Amazingly, the film was shot almost exclusively on location in the UK.  There were only 4 sets built (the milkbar, a mirrored hall, a mirrored bathroom, and the prison reception area).  All of the supporting performances are excellent (with special mention going to Anthony Sharp as the Minister of the Interior, Michael Bates as the Chief Guard, Patrick Magee as the writer, and Warren Clarke as Dim).  Most of you probably know this already, but the huge man servant that the writer has later in the film is David Prowse, who played Darth Vader in the first 3 Star Wars films.  And let's not forget Philip Stone, an actor who appeared in 3 Kubrick films (perhaps a record, there are many actors who appeared here that appeared in other Kubrick pictures, like 2001 and Barry Lyndon).  Another aspect of this film I love is that it's so quinessentially British.  If you didn't know Kubrick was an American, you'd swear it was directed by an Englishman. O nly a handful of films have done that, where the director immerses himself so much in a foreign culture that his film makes you think he's lived there his whole life.  Kurosawa's Dersu Uzala and Tarkovsky's The Sacrifice are like that.  They were so quinessentially Russian and Swedish films, despite being directed by a Japanese man and a Russian man.<br /><br />This 2 disc edition has some fascinating extras, including a great documentary called Still Tickin':  The Return of Clockwork Orange.  Sam Mendes (director of American Beauty) is one of the commentators, and he says this film is remarkable because Kubrick really trusts the audience, and that most directors don't do that today.  Never in the film is there any attempt to sentimentalize or moralise in any way.  Kubrick makes no moral judgements here, which increases the film's power.  There is also commentary by Alex himself, Malcolm McDowell.  He shares the good times and the bad times, but all with great affection.  He had a minor falling out with Kubrick after this film, but that seems to have dissipated.<br /><br />This is still a deeply unsettling, scary, thought provoking film, one that deserves every accolade it gets.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>`A Clockwork Orange', in novel form, is one of the most important pieces of literature and should be read by everyone in my humble opinion.  I had never seen the film but had embraced the novel head on and respect it in its entirety.  My best friend told me that I had to see the film if I loved the novel so much.  He had seen it numerous times and just knew that it would interest me.  So I finally buckled down and rented this film and dare I say that it is one of the best motion pictures to ever be released.  For a film of the 70's it barely seems dated for the acting is top notch and the direction by Kubrick may very well be his finest.  Kubrick faithfully adapted Anthony Burgess' classic novel with fervor and fearlessness, not shying away from the darkness that clouded the pages.<br /><br />Let it be known that `A Clockwork Orange' is not a film for everyone, but it is a film that everyone should see.  I don't know if that makes perfect sense so let me see if I can explain.  In my humble opinion `A Clockwork Orange' delves into some of the most intricate workings of mankind.  It fleshes out the demons, the innate desire to have total control and it asks the questions that we do well to ask ourselves with regard to crime and punishment, vengeance and mercy.  In this respect it is an important film that begs to be lauded and respected.  In do this though is breaches dark territory and at times is both vulgar and explicit.  It is shocking, even with its age, and can at times even repel the audience.  Nothing is glorified, in fact it is extremely detestable and looked down upon, but it is visually included and very much a large part of the film.  In that respect not everyone can handle a film of this nature.<br /><br />The film (as does the novel) centers around a young man by the name of Alex.  Alex is, for lack of a better word, a gang member.  He walks the streets at night with his friends making trouble, stealing, pillaging, assaulting...killing.  Alex though has a bit of a power issue and this incessant need to be the ringleader puts him at odds with his fellow `droogs', Pete, Georgie and Dim.  When Alex is arrested and incarcerated he begins to see the folly of his ways.  Whether or not this `transformation' is real or merely an attempt at freedom is left up to the viewer in this instance (I'll get back to this point in a minute) but the `transformation', real or fake, is there and this prompts Alex to volunteer for a new government procedure supposedly able to cure him of his sick and twisted tendencies.<br /><br />My one disappointment with the film is one I saw coming.  The film was adapted from the originally released version of the novel.  So, the film, much like that novel, is unfinished, incomplete...wrong.  Anthony Burgess had written one final chapter, a controversial chapter that was omitted in order to boost sales by the publishing house.  This final chapter takes the novel to a whole new level and would have taken the film there too.  It would help make things clearer to the audience and help him or her become more in tune with Alex himself.  The ambiguity of Alex's `transformation' is one area that would have been crystal clear had the final chapter been part of the adaptation.  I won't say any more in this regard (read the novel, now released with the final chapter).<br /><br />Regardless though, the film is brilliant.  Aided by the powerhouse (and Oscar snubbed) performance by Malcolm McDowell, who masterfully captures Alex from his outward swagger to his emotional impotence, `A Clockwork Orange' delivers on each and every front.  Stanley Kubrick was a master of film and this is no exception.  This may very well be his finest film, but that is up to each and every one of us to decide for ourselves.</p></br><a href="../users/A39IBJB2PBVC7I.html">A39IBJB2PBVC7I</a><br/><p>Clockwork Orange has endured; even today it looks smart and modern.  If nothing else, Kubrick was a masterful stylist with a wonderful eye for composition and detail.  Wildly controversial when it debuted, the film continues to spark heated debate, even among Kubrick admirers.  Clockwork Orange was condemned for its graphic depiction of senseless violence, but screen violence of this sort is common today.  There are two reasons why this chilling masterpiece still has the power to unnerve audiences; the first reason has to do with Alex, the protagonist, the second with the broader implications of the movie's snarling social satire.<br /><br />Alex is not your garden-variety thug.  He adores Beethoven, he's intelligent, articulate, and capable of being charming.  More to the point, we don't get the sense that his pathology is the result of a wretched childhood or societal abuse - he simply delights in violence and cruelty, they make him happy.  The unforgettable "Singin' In The Rain" scene makes this point most emphatically, and tragically.  In this regard, Alex (played masterfully by Malcolm McDowell), is less a symbol of modern society than of man's inherently violent nature, celebrated every day around the world both directly and indirectly through innumerable well-respected rituals.  In short, Alex is especially horrifying because he is, if not likable, certainly familiar.<br /><br />The second is the allegorical nature of the film.  (Viewers determined to critique the movie literally are reminded that Alex has his own language.  The headline of this review, translated from Alex-speak, would read Great Story, No Apology.) Especially in the Burgess novel, but also here, we are invited to consider the moral consequences of a society's decision to use brainwashing and torture as a means of curing its violence-management problem.  Kubrick makes it easy to spot this ethical dilemma by having some of the droogs turn up in police uniforms, thus inviting the question, how does one tell the criminals from the good guys without a score card?<br /><br />Years after its release, Clockwork Orange holds its own.  As entertainment it is tough sledding but fascinating.  As art it is triumphant.  In art we look not for answers but for the right questions.  Clockwork Orange shines a very bright light on some fascinating and fundamental moral mysteries that go right to the heart of being human - brilliant then, brilliant now.  Belongs in any collection of important film.</p></br><a href="../users/A29Y34ALWJUGB5.html">A29Y34ALWJUGB5</a><br/><p>Stanley Kubrick, one of the legendary directors, is also the easiest to misunderstand, I think. His movies range in genre but generally follow his usual oddball style, and many find this style unsavory, even me. In fact, many of his movies, especially his newer ones, I have no care for. But to me, his three greatest films are some of the best ever. Those films are The Shining, Full-Metal Jacket, and this, A Clockwork Orange, which I think is his greatest.<br /><br />The story of Clockwork follows a young hoodlum named Alex as he goes about his days beating and raping people, bullying his friends, and drinking drug-laced milk. But when he goes too far and accidentally kills someone, things take the expected turn and he ends up getting caught by the police. After spending some time in prison, Alex gets word of an experimental new rehabilitation program, one that guarantees him a chance to get out of prison within two short weeks. He doesn't realize, however, what this treatment entails, believing only that it's his chance to get out or prison and back to his old life. And so begins the rehabilitation of Alex, and when released fourteen days later, he's a new man incapable of doing violence, having sex, or even listening to the Beethoven's Ninth.<br /><br />What drives this movie is easily the character of Alex, a kind of an amoral Peter Pan of sorts, a boy who doesn't want to grow up, locked in a world of ultra-violence that he rules without exception. He's intelligent and manipulative to the point of genius. He's fun-loving, singing and dancing while dishing out pain and torment. Yet, though we should hate this anti-hero, he's just so damn easy to cheer for, especially during the early moments, which are as shocking as they are exciting.<br /><br />I will say that A Clockwork Orange, like 2001, has the capability of being misunderstood, and could easily be considered Kubrick's worst film. It's a movie that takes a certain amount of stomach to withstand, because it places an emphasis on torture, full body nudity, and desensitized youth, and attempts to disturb the viewer constantly. But, even if you think this movie is bad, you can't help but realize that it's at least unique. No movie has ever been made like this, and it's been thirty-five years since its original release. If you haven't seen this movie, pick it up, especially if you are a fan of gory horror movies, apocalyptic sc-fi films, or adult Japanese anime, as all of these types of movies share some of the themes of A Clockwork Orange.</p></br><a href="../users/A20IIR0422G3A5.html">A20IIR0422G3A5</a><br/><p>`Clockwork Orange', directed by Stanley Kubrick, based on an important short novel by Anthony Burgess has the misfortune of being the movie Kubrick made after `2001'. I still remember having skipped out of work to see the movie on the very first afternoon it opened in local Baltimore theaters. I had read the novel and seen the previews many times over, so I was well primed for what I was about to see.<br /><br />My first reaction was that I was missing something. There were pieces of the movie which were truly masterful, especially Malcolm MacDowell's career defining role as the principle bad boy. The use of music was similarly well up to Kubrick's usually excellent use of borrowed music. The application of `Singin' in the Rain' alone was almost worth the price of admission. But somehow, neither the narrative nor the visual context seemed to hang together quite as well as Kubrick's earlier movies.<br /><br />In retrospect, this may not be too surprising, as `Full Metal Jacket', for example, has famously been described as half of a great movie and half of a good movie, with logical, but not entirely aesthetic connection between the two parts.<br /><br />Similarly, `Clockwork Orange' breaks down into at least three acts, where our `hero' Alex (MacDowell) is the quintessential bad boy, the tamed wimp, and the restored nasty Marker. Along the way, Kubrick does great things with ambient lighting, which makes this movie important from the cinematic point of view, but contributes only a marginal value to the overall audience experience.<br /><br />Part of my feeling of loss may be the fact that given the limited amount of screen dialogue in comparison to the dialogue in the book, Kubrick could not fully exploit Burgess' invented slang, which was a cross between Cockney and Russian words. This kind of wordplay is great for the cognoscenti, but it tends to leave the average audience scratching their heads trying to figure out what the characters are saying, without the benefit of a slang dictionary at the back of the book.<br /><br />Among all of Kubrick's works, this may be the least fondly remembered, because it had left no indelible quote in our minds like Slim Pickins' bomb ride, Hal's goodby to his human colleagues, Jack Nicholson's `Here's Johnny!', `Full Metal Jacket's `thousand yard stare',  and Sue Lyons' `Lolita'. `Eyes Wide Shut' and `Barry Lyndon' may be equally anonymous, but expectations for those films, I think was simply not as high as for `Clockwork Orange'.<br /><br />And yet, this movie is still better than 9/10 of all other movies ever made, and deserves an important place in our history of film. If for no other reason than it stands with `Bonnie and Clyde' as an exercize in the use of violence in film which is done to good cinematic effect rather than for pure gratuitous thrills.<br /><br />My biggest regret is that Herr Kubrick is no longer with us to give us comment tracks on his movies to give us some insights into his aesthetic.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FPDWTD9AENVK.html">A2FPDWTD9AENVK</a><br/><p>Alex leads a pack of degenerate young hooligans through the streets of England on an ultra-violent rampage of rape and murder. After being betrayed by his friends, Alex is caught by the police and incarcerated in a state prison, where he volunteers for an experimental new treatment in order to earn himself an early release. Here at the Ludovico Institute, he is subjected to hours of brainwashing images and conditioning that force a negative association with violence in his mind that is accompanied by a wrenching pain in his gut. Now free, he is a truly a changed man, but he re-enters a bitter society that is still riddled with violence, where he is beaten to the brink of death by those he had harmed in the past.<br /><br />Master craftsman Stanley Kubrick brings his own unique vision to the classic Anthony Burgess novel about free will and governmental control. This dystopian tale uses Alex and his droogs as extreme examples of youth in revolt, living without rule in an ambivalent society where teachers and family have all but given up on enforcing the law. A CLOCKWORK ORANGE paints the governing authorities in a mocking and contemptuous light, demonstrating their inadequacies through their dogmatic practices, failed social experiment, and loose hiring techniques.<br /><br />While the great Malcolm McDowell would go on to star in many other excellent films, it would be his role as Alex that would prove to be his most memorable and lasting performance. He plays beside an equally talented cast that each manage to extract the biting cynicism of the script and bring it to life on-screen. Kubrick's extraordinary use of color and expert filming techniques immediately juxtapose the graphic subject matter and violence, a trend that is heightened even further by the Classical music score that is intrinsically linked to Alex's character progression. The culmination of these various elements can be seen early on, when Alex and his gang terrorize an older couple in their home to the gleeful tune of "Singin' in the Rain."<br /><br />Nominated for no less than four Oscars? (including Best Script and Best Director) and winner of countless other awards, Stanley Kubrick's A CLOCKWORK ORANGE is in a class all unto itself. It is a defining piece of cinematic history, and an important watch for any film fan.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies</p></br><a href="../users/A2582KMXLK2P06.html">A2582KMXLK2P06</a><br/><p>A Clockwork Orange is the kind of film that, upon reviewed, many of these reviews often get criticized for either missing the point, or not entirely understanding what the movie writers were going for during its creation.<br /><br />I'm just another person with an opinion, but the way *I* interpreted the storyline is like this-<br /><br />A punk teenager from England is the leader of a gang, and he does some of the worst things imaginable.  He and his gang torture people while dancing around the room and singing, they rape women and feel no remorse whatsoever, and this gang of punks basically just continues to ruin peoples lives as they find new victims during their deplorable nightly journeys around the town.<br /><br />Some people view this film as a dark comedy, but I honestly fail to see any comedy elements whatsoever.  I don't think this is an example of another American who doesn't understand British humor either.  I just don't see how anything taking place is supposed to be funny.<br /><br />Oh sure, some of the sexual references have a bit of humor to them (such as the one gang member picking up a statue of a... mans thingy) but the thing is, if you look at the plot from an overall point of view, the main focus of the storyline is obviously NOT funny at all.  It's about an extremely serious matter and delivered in a twisted way.<br /><br />Let me put it another way- just because you witness a few scenes that could probably pass for comedy, it's really easy to dismiss these particular scenes since the main focus should definitely be on the shocking seriousness of the storyline.  Actually, considering the year this film was released, it wouldn't surprise me if those slightly humurous bits were included simply as a way to cover-up how disturbing this movie *really* could have been, had the writers been granted permission to go out and make it even more shocking.<br /><br />With that said, a Clockwork Orange is highly enjoyable because, for one thing, the first 20 minutes of film are VERY shocking considering the time period in which this film was created- the early 70's.  Not many films back then touched upon topics in *this* much brutal detail.<br /><br />I liked when the one gang member asked to be involved in a new experiment to figure out what triggers murderers and psychotics to go absolutely insane.  Without spoiling anything, the guy had to go through mental pain the likes of which most people wouldn't be able to handle, and well, by the time he was released, that mental pain quickly turned to physical.  You'll see what I mean by this.  Talk about VERY clever writing.  What goes around comes around is the moral of this storyline.<br /><br />Overall, the storyline holds up remarkably well, the acting is really good (though entirely British- be prepared for that) and it's easy to see the kind of reputation a Clockwork Orange has built over the years.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>This is a one of a kind film that is not going to be liked by everyone. It is one of the most disturbing films ever made and it hasn't mellowed with age.

He spends time in prison, and then is given the option to participate in an experimental prisoner 'rehabilitation' program. The new treatment renders him physically incapable of violence of any kind, but takes away what many deem as a human 'moral choice'. It's a very strange movie, and makes its point in violent ways, but it does have a point to make. I like how the character comes 'full circle' when he ends up crawling to the home of one of his first victims. A tightly written screenplay with not an 'inch' of boredom. You'll have to get the popcorn, etc. ahead of time. You're not going to walk to the kitchen during any part of this bizarre, memorable film.<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author</p></br><a href="../users/A1SVXJZ3386U2D.html">A1SVXJZ3386U2D</a><br/><p>After Stanley Kubrick came out with "2001: A Space Oddessy" everyone was looking forward to his next movie.  I remember my uncle asking me about "A Clockwork Orange" and suggesting that it must be a visual treat.  I realized then that many people may have been expecting the wrong thing when ACO was released.  Nonetheless it IS a visual treat but not in the sense that "2001: A Space Oddessy" was.<br /><br />ACO tells the story of a youthful thug named Alex in a not-so-distant future.  The society he lives in has morphed into one of wealth and poverty and plagued by roving gangs of which our anti-hero is one such member.  We are given a series of scenes that underscore his violent brutality.  We are also given a scene or two that tells us this kid isn't beyond hope.  Well, hope, in the eyes of society, rests with a new treatment that recently arrested Alex is going to be the guinea pig for.  The treatment is a paradox in that it turns Alex away from all violence including acting in his own self-defense.  In solving society's problem the fate of the indidual is discounted.<br /><br />"A Clockwork Orange" does a brilliant job in bringing to life an uncomfortable image of tommorrow and letting us exam an individual such as Alex.  We are filled with anger and disgust with his character but we eventually find ourselves becoming sympathetic.  Alex is excellently protrayed by Malcolm McDowell who has had some excellent roles and some not-so-excellent roles in the past (see "Caligula" or, better yet, DON'T see "Caligula").  His talent is certainly in focus in ACO.<br /><br />One of the interesting aspects of ACO is the music.  I had the soundtrack for awhile until it mysteriously disappeared.  The classical music was terrific, focussing on Beethoven.  I became enchanted with a little ditty called "I Want to Marry a Lighthouse Keeper" which was NOT a work By Beethoven.  This may have been at least one solid connection between ACO and "2001: A Space Oddessy" for those looking for one.  Kubrick knows how to make the most out of a musical score.<br /><br />Some years after seeing ACO for the 4th or 5th time, I came across a copy of the book by Anthony Burgess.  After reading it, I saw the movie again.  For some reason I was a bit disappointed with the movie this time.  I can't figure that out because it is one outstanding movie.  Maybe it was because the book was better?</p></br><a href="../users/AK81WLVD5KGUX.html">AK81WLVD5KGUX</a><br/><p>Which is better: to be capable of choice even if we use this capability to choose monstrous evil, or to be capable only of 'good' even if we are therefore incapable of real moral choice?<p>Anthony Burgess asked and answered this question in his haunting and disturbing novel _A Clockwork Orange_. Stanley Kubrick's stunning adaptation of the book to the screen succeeds at every level in conveying both the question and Burgess's preferred answer.<p>The film is rigorously staged and stylized, the graphic visual content often in fittingly violent conflict with the classical music of the soundtrack. The sex and violence are both repulsive and fascinating, as they must be in order to pose Burgess's question fairly (and to fulfill another purpose of Burgess's that he acknowledges in his introduction to the 1986 U.S. edition of the novel: 'to titillate the nastier propensities' of the audience).<p>Like the novel, the film features the unlikeliest 'hero' in the history of literature (and one of its greatest antiheroes). Alex is a sadistic teen gang leader with a taste for rape and destruction (and for Beethoven). Eventually, for reasons you will learn in the film, he's subjected to a groundbreaking behavior-modification treatment at the hands of a 'benevolent' State bent on reducing crime (partly in order to make room in the jails for political prisoners; incidentally, Burgess's book is also one of the finest man-vs.-the-State novels).<p>Malcolm McDowell is hypnotic in what is still the role of his lifetime. His moral choices during the first portion of the film will make you want to vomit. This guy isn't a handsome Cool Hand Luke charmingly lopping the heads off parking meters, or even a disarmingly free-spirited Randle Patrick McMurphy getting caught engaging in consensual sex with an underage girl. Alex is a violent thug, rapist, and (eventually) killer, and he does it all for the sheer fun of it. Far from being a likeable antiauthority figure, he will initially have you rooting for the authorities.<p>But after he (ironically enough) chooses to be subjected to the Ludovico treatment, you will find yourself on his 'side' (such as it is). The fact that Burgess is able to bring his reader to _sympathize_ with such a character is one of the novel's greatest achievements; Kubrick matches it point by point on the screen. (That's why this film is so much _better_ a 'countercultural'/'antiauthoritarian' film than even the admittedly great _Cool Hand Luke_ and _One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest_.)<p>The end of the film leaves something to be desired: namely, the final (twenty-first) chapter of Burgess's novel, which wasn't included in the original U.S. edition of the book. For some reason, even though the film was shot in the U.K., Kubrick elected not to incorporate this final chapter, with the effect that non-U.S. audiences were surprised at the abrupt and seemingly unfinished ending. U.S. audiences who have read the 1986 U.S. edition of the novel may feel likewise.<p>Whatever the merits of the omission, the film is not only great on its own terms but one of the greatest screen adaptations ever made of a novel. It will help a bit if you've read the book first, just because you'll have been thereby clued in to the largely Russian-based slang used by Alex and his droogs. But it's not necessary; as in the book, the screenplay gives you time and opportunity to adjust. In this respect and in every other, Kubrick's film stands just fine on its own merits.<p>This is one of the greatest motion pictures ever made. You'll need a strong stomach to watch it, but it will hold up under repeated viewings for as long as you can stand it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZVERVFM25MJT.html">A2ZVERVFM25MJT</a><br/><p>After hearing of the hype and critical praise that this film has received, I wasn't exactly sure what to expect.  It's a very visual piece, with plenty of colourful imagery punctuated by classical music that is used to great effect in some of the most disturbing scenes.  As for the violent scenes, they're mostly tastefully done, with less focus put on the act themselves than on the perpetrators and the victims.  This is particularly impressive in a day where movies measure themselves on body count more than anything else.<p>The story itself though, is absolutely horrible and particularly the clinic scenes are hard to watch.  The worrying conclusion that society is more concerned with curing the problem than looking at the root of the problem is pertinent even today.<p>Even so, I wouldn't go so far as to say that this film is a masterpiece (a word that has been associated with Kubrick an awful lot - remember that John Carpenter's 'Halloween' was also branded this and then he made 'Vampires').  There are plenty of clich&eacute;s such as the weird and wonderful central character and his love for classical music.  Such things are as old as the hills.<p>Still, the acting is excellent and a superb narrative is kept throughout the film which is thankfully not devoid of humour.  This is a wonderfully strange experience, but it's probably not something that you'd wish to watch over and over.</p></br><a href="../users/A3S9887MZFNNH1.html">A3S9887MZFNNH1</a><br/><p>I bought this on pirate video last year and was suprised at how good it was. They plan to re-release it here in Britain in the spring of 2000 I know this because I saw the colourful trailer. The story was well written  and the notorious rape scene is not as bad as they say it is. A CLOCKWORK  ORANGE delivers over 2 hours of dark humour, horror, adventure and  beethoven. Also a good soundtrack.<p>A sequel would not be as good, but it  would be interesting. This is one of Britains finest films.</p></br><a href="../users/A2CK0VXUDVXGMN.html">A2CK0VXUDVXGMN</a><br/><p>Basically a great book and great movie.

But recently my nephew Ronald and I sat down and watched it together he is a 16 year old male and for some reason he was unfased by he images so i ran out and brought the novel for him to read since it may spark a more clearer image of horror in his imagination but alas he laughed the thre film and the novel and that made me watch the film again and realize the true genuis behind it. Kubrick used classical music the music of beauty and intellect to propell a barbaric act of violence but violence isn't barbaric at all it is what keeps the world moving and is the driving force behind human nature. My nephew is of a different time then myself the visuals of blood and guns is nothing new but if you truly want to see th real life telling of A Clockwork Orange just turn on the tv and view how we set modern day music to the most barbaric emtions of all self loathing for the act love. Kubrick may have known that as the years past that humans would revert human nature to a point where the public wishes to throw away our origins of being human!</p></br><a href="../users/AUM3YMZ0YRJE0.html">AUM3YMZ0YRJE0</a><br/><p>I had not seen this movie in ten years, so I bought it for my collection of quirky scifi.  I popped it in my DVD player and was as utterly spellbound by it as I was the first time in I saw it, nearly 30 years ago, but from a new and different point of view (of a middle-aged man).<br /><br />It is simply one of the greatest socio-scifi films ever made, rich in themes and unforgettable images, a language uniquely its own, with first-rate acting and innumerable layers.  There are deliciously unanswered questions in it, like the infiltration of Russian into working class British slang, that stimulate the imagination.  In my humble opinion, this marks it as a work of genius that will survive as a classic of our times, to be compared with the greatest literary accomplishments.  Kubrick is one of the all-time greats and this film is superior to the novel by Burgess.<br /><br />We witness Alex, a twisted and sadistic youth, on his private journey to hell.  While devilishly funny, it is also a frightening portrait of a decadent industrial society, in which politicians and the intelligensia are as brutal as the thugs they hire into the police.  Plus, you have Kubrick's fascination with music and altered states of consciousness, all of which form part of Alex's bizarre character and recondite violence.  The story is so unique!!  And constantly stimulating.<br /><br />Recommmended as great art that will grow in your imagination for the rest of your life.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>Before I review this film I'd like to give a note of caution. "A Clockwork Orange" was adapted from a novel by Anthony Burgess, who based some of the events in the book on the brutal rape of his wife.  Stanley Kubrick, the director, pulled this film from release in his adopted country, England, after there were copy-cat crimes based on incidents depicted in the film.  His concern was the heinous acts portrayed in the film would be mis-interpreted by impressionable minds.  In the United States, this film was originally given an "X" rating, prohibiting anyone under seventeen from viewing it.  On a personal note I saw this film(repeatedly) as a teenager and the selling point to me was how cool the stylized violence was portrayed in the film.  Preaching aside, this is a great film for adults.  The story, set in an undetermined future, where youth gangs rule the streets of England.  One particular gang,or "droogs", is led by the charismatic Alex(Malcolm McDowell) who enjoy nothing more than assaulting homeless people, pinching autos, raping women,and just general mayhem.  After accidently killing a woman in a breaking and entering, Alex is imprisoned.  To his fortune or misfortune he is selected by the present government to receive treatment that would involuntarily supress his propensity for violence.  Released from prison without the free-will to protect himself from the malevolent forces who would prey on him, Alex is victimized.  The question that has to be asked by discerning viewers is does this film concern itself with free-will or is is it just an excuse for displaying stylized, choreographed violence?  I would have to say this film does effectively navigate itself on the side of free-will.  The rationale for the prettiness of some of the violence is that the story is told in the first person, as it was in Burgess' novel.  We have to see violence as Alex sees it and Alex loves violence.  McDowell does a charismatic turn as Alex and is supported by a fine cast(Patrick Magee, Miriam Karlin, etc.).  The art-deco look, the editing, the cinematography, the music(including moog classical by Wendy Carlos) is excellent.  Kubrick further cemented his reputation as the top director in films at the time and also contributed a superior screenplay.  A lot of the dialogue in the film is in "nadsat", a hybrid of English slang and Russian.  In the novel, Burgess uses an appendix to explain some of the terms but Kubrick effectively conveys here the meaning of a lot of these terms.  On a final note, the film ends somewhat ambiguously where Alex states "I was cured alright".  This corresponds with the ending that appeared in the American editions of Burgess' novel.  The British version contains an additional chapter that only appeared recently in America where it would appear that Alex repudiates his old ways.</p></br><a href="../users/A2QH5NMHW1KTJ1.html">A2QH5NMHW1KTJ1</a><br/><p>This film is inspired by Anthony Burgess's classic novel and it's also been inspire buy dozens of punkers. This film is directed by Stanley Kubrick which if you seen most of his films you can see that there's a lot of pauses, meaning not a lot of talk in a scene. This film takes place in England and it is about this gang leader who goes to jail by accidentally killing a girl. It's very gruesome the way he accidentally kills her so it's hard to explain. The government has an experiment where they could make criminals not kill anymore. He goes on the chance so he can get out of jail. When he does and goes back home all of his enemies kick his ass and he can't do anything about it. This film can be very disturbing for people. The only draw back for me was the graphic nudeness, it was just too much for me. One of the memorable scenes are when Alex (gang leader) rapes a girl while singing &quot;I'm singing in the rain&quot;. Also there's got to be a special addition one day though. This film is a definite must for all punkers.</p></br><a href="../users/AATKF0HDBQL86.html">AATKF0HDBQL86</a><br/><p>A face fills the screen with a wry smile.  Slowly, the camera draws back to reveal our humble narrator, Alex, and his three droogs lounging in the Korova Milk Bar among a variety of sculptures depicting nude women.<br /><br />Thus begins A Clockwork Orange, a modern satire about drugs, sex, and ultraviolence, brought to us by the fiendishly twisted mind of the late Stanley Kubrick.  Played with wonderful intensity by British actor Malcolm McDowell, Alex takes the viewer on a long and winding journey in which he and his droogs, prompted by their drug-laced Milk Plus, go out and commit random acts of theft, sex, and violence night after night, much to the dismay and grief of Alex's parents.  When one of these random crimes results in the death of their victim the droogs run off, leaving Alex to the mercy of a corrupt justice system.  He volunteers for a program designed to "cure" incorrigibles of their desire to commit mayhem, and he is subjected to a type of aversion therapy that ultimately leaves him completely defenseless.<br /><br />The language that Alex uses both as our humble narrator and as a participant is also a very vital part of the characters and story.  A mixture of schoolboy speak, 60's British slang, made-up words, and "Nadsat" Russian (that is, Russian spoken without regard for the subtleties and nuances of the language), it gives Alex and his droogs a richness and dimension that sets them apart from the others and makes them unique.<br /><br />All in all, A Clockwork Orange is a great movie, and one that I highly recommend.</p></br><a href="../users/ACVFTS9X2MKJ8.html">ACVFTS9X2MKJ8</a><br/><p>This was my favorite movie for more than 30 years.  It was also one of my first purchases on DVD many years ago.  A few years later, they released yet another newly mastered version.<br /><br />But now, this third mastering takes the cake!  The picture quality is fabulous, and so is the sound of the remastered soundtrack.  The music sounds cleaner than my soundtrack CD of "A Clockwork Orange."  And all these special features make this film all well worth having to buy it again, one last time.<br /><br />But the point I want to make the most about this release IS about the newly remastered video transfer.  This film looks excellent!  This proves to me, once again, that there is no need to waste my money upgrading to Blu-Ray DVD's because it is possible to have High Definition standard DVD's.<br /><br />I won't let myself fall into that trap of replacing all my favorite DVD's with Blu-Ray DVD's.  If YOU do then you're looking at an expensive future of buying all your favorite movies all over again.<br /><br />And you know what?  I'll bet, within 5 years or so from now, they'll say they've come out with something better than Blu-Ray DVD's, and you'll be suckered into replacing all your favorite DVD's once again.<br /><br />Blu-Ray is another example of the never-ending cycle of making sure that you keep buying your favorite movies, over and over again.<br /><br />And then over and over again, and over and over again, and then something new will come out and you'll buy all your favorite movies over and over again, and over and over again, and over and over again, and over and over again, and then something new will come out and you buy all your favorite movies over and over again, and over and over again, and over and over again, and over and over again, and then something new will come out and you'll buy your favorite movies over and over again, and over and over again, and over and over again, and over and over again, and then something new will come out and then you'll buy your favorite movies over and over again, and over and over again, and over and over again, and over and over again, and so on and so on....<br /><br />If you start to invest in Blu-Ray now, the movie industry obviously has you wrapped around their finger.<br /><br />I'm sure the standard DVD will never go away.  We've all invested so much in our video library that most of us are going to continue to cherish what we already have, and maybe only replace some particular favorite films when a newly remastered version is released.  That just makes more sense.  Don't you think?</p></br><a href="../users/A25KKXUQQ0OLWB.html">A25KKXUQQ0OLWB</a><br/><p>The movie is a classic and great.  Stanley Kubrick created an amazing movie from a great book.  Malcolm McDowell became well known for this role and a movie about futuristic street gangs had a resounding effect on Great Britain where Stanley Kubrick had the movie withdrawn after death threats.  Malcolm McDowell portrays a psychopathic hoodlum who rapes, beats and eventually murders vulnerable citizens.  After 2 years in prison, he agrees to a scientific study intended to steer him from violent tendencies and make him a productive citizen.  Instead it causes him to become a helpless victim of violence himself.  The story is never as momentous as the quality of the filmmaking and direction.  This film is truly Stanley Kubrick.</p></br><a href="../users/A3S98L5B1SR9P1.html">A3S98L5B1SR9P1</a><br/><p>A Clockwork Orange is about a teenager named Alex, who, along with his three "droogs", participates in beating and raping helpless victims during the night. After being slapped around by Alex, and a night of the ol' "ultraviolence", the droogies decide to knock him out and leave him for the police to find. He agrees to participate in a new, yet controversial treatment that will shorten his jail sentence. When he is eventually let out, he becomes A Clockwork Orange, which is an object (or person in the case of the movie) which appears normal on the outside but is completely artificial or "mechanical" on the inside. He loathes violence, and can't defend himself, but his ex-droogs, and his victims are looking for revenge.<br /><br />Stanley Kubrick's direction is top notch as usual, as he was a perfectionist, and in my opinion, got the best from his cast, who were, and still are, excluding Malcolm McDowell, unknowns. Malcolm McDowell's performance is truly oscar worthy, and I'm surprised he didn't win. I really can't imagine any actor playing the part of Alex other than him. Even Kubrick said that if McDowell hadn't been available to play the part, then he probably wouldn't have done the movie. I also read somewhere during the "Ludivico Treatment" scene, one of his eyelids was scratched by the glazzy clips, also when they were filming the scene where Dim and Georgie were drowning him while beating him, he almost drowned because the breathing pipe in the water messed up. That's true commitment to a film, if you ask me. McDowell also became immensely afraid of eyedrops after filming the scene. There adds to the commitment - doing something so many times so as to become afraid of eyedrops. McDowell's performance in ACO is, in my opinion, one of the greatest, most underrated performances in movie history.<br /><br />As for the question, "Is this Kubrick's best?", well, I'd say 2001 is his best, but as we all know, opinions differ. In terms of greatness, it's definitely one of his best. I think it is a must-see for any film-lover of any kind.<br /><br />- Zack, 16 years old</p></br><a href="../users/A1KT1GWCW8F80.html">A1KT1GWCW8F80</a><br/><p>&quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; is screenplay writer/director/producer Stanley Kubrick's interpretation of the book of the same name by Anthony Burgess. The dialog includes some of Burgess' made-up language from the book.<br /><br /> The plot revolves around Alex de Large and his group of friends who are very violent, and get their kicks by raping and assaulting people. After Alex and friends commit various crimes, Alex is finally arrested and put in prison with a sentence of 14 years. Eventually, his sentence is commuted in exchange for him undergoing experimental aversion therapy which makes him physically ill at the thought of sex or violence. However, it also makes him hate Beethoven's 9th Symphony which was played as background music to some films during aversion treatment. After an attempted suicide, Alex is re-treated with apologies by the government for inhuman treatment, and Alex appears he will resume his old ways.<br /><br /> This movie is highly stylized, including wardrobe, hairdo's (mom has purple hair, another woman had dark blue hair), set dressing, location and props. There is a fair amount of full frontal nudity of both sexes, and some stylized and slow-motion violence. Kubrick has made some good and bad movies, but this is his most stylized and over-the-top effort.

That is, it is a frightening but compelling SF-ish flick that, like the novel, is wrapped around deep socio-political and philosophical subtext.  It warns about the dangers of blithe, government-dictated social conformity, yet it also cautions against allowing citizens to indulge in so much freedom that society becomes unsafe and anarchic.  In other words, it forces viewers to ponder the question of just how far citizens of a society can have their free will restricted before they cease to be truly free...or truly human.<p>Set in an England of the &quot;near&quot; future, A CLOCKWORK ORANGE paints a picture of a British dystopia that, in some respects, is more horrific and more depressing--and in retrospect, closer to the reality of the 3+ decades that have passed since its release--than the Oceania of Orwell's 1984.  Malcolm McDowell stars as Alex de Large, a teenage ruffian who nightly roams the streets of his hometown with a gang of other sadistic young hoodlums (his &quot;droogs&quot;) and engages in acts of &quot;ultra-violence&quot; (i.e., robbery, rape, pummelings, murder, etc.).  Other such gangs of thugs also roam the streets at night, so going outside after dark is a dangerous prospect for the average citizen.<p>Following a botched burglary and murder, Alex is temporarily blinded and left behind by his craven droogs.  Young Alex is arrested for the murder when the police arive, and soon after he is found guilty and sentenced to a lengthy prison term.  But he thinks he has secured his quick ticket to freedom when he is accepted into a program that promises to &quot;cure&quot; his violent propensities and, upon successful completion of the program, nullify his prison sentence.  Unbeknownst to Alex, though, is that the procedure is based on Pavlovian conditioning techniques, meaning that Alex won't be &quot;cured&quot; so much as he will be brainwashed into autonomically behaving like a respectable, law-abiding citizen.<p>Due to the nature of the film's subject matter--and, of course, to help drive home its subtextual message--A CLOCKWORK ORANGE contains many disturbing and violent scenes, including the depiction of a beating and rape during which Alex &quot;kicks&quot; out his rendition of &quot;Singing in the Rain.&quot;  Some viewers, especially those not normally inclined towards watching horror or crime dramas, have a difficult time looking past the violence and delving into the film's subtext.  For those folks, it might be easier to emotionally and intellectually grasp the theme of Kubrick's film if they FIRST read Burgess' novel.  (For most viewers, though, enjoyment of the movie does not require familiarity with the novel.)<p>A CLOCKWORK ORANGE is fairly loyal to the source material, though Burgess' complete work includes a final chapter that is not depicted in the film.  Supposedly this is because Kubrick only had access to the American edition of the book--this despite the fact that he was an American expatriate living in England--in which the last chapter had been removed because Burgess' American editors considered it inconsistent with the rest of the novel.  Literary purists, who will often make value judgments about a film based on its adherence to the printed source, will probably be put off by Kubrick's purportedly inadvertent omission.  However, as with any other well-made film, it should be judged solely on its own merits.<p>With A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, Kubrick questions the perceptions of freedom and the concepts of crime and punishment in Western society.  The film is a truculent and thought-provoking socio-political satire that, after more than three decades, still retains its ability to shock viewers into philosophical rumination.  Of course, Kubrick's excellent script and tight direction contribute to the film's success in eliciting such a reaction, but so does Malcolm McDowell's energetic and compelling performance as Alex, that rare protagonist who is equally reprehensible and pitiable.  <p>All in all, A CLOCKWORK ORANGE is an excellent and still-relevant classic that belongs in the collection of any serious lover of great movies.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X15AQVSCKKRG.html">A1X15AQVSCKKRG</a><br/><p>This is a classic, I remember the first time I watched this,<br />it left me speechless, mesmerized, angry , sad and happy. Kubrick was a misunderstood genius at times, but everyone can agree a "ClockWork Orange" like "Dr. Stangelove" put him back on the map as a serious director with a vision.<br /><br />This case he takes still a young up and coming actor Malcolm<br />Mcdowell whose career spans from playing one evil villain<br />after the other. The other most notorious he played is of course<br />Caligula but here in this in this white suburban terrorist<br />who with his group spreads violence and terror is outstanding.<br /><br />In a way too, Kubrick was bringing to attention the problem<br />of todays youth, how their misguide, foolisn and with some like Mcdowell's character worthless. These are the types of youth who do the Columbime murders.<br /><br />Eventually Mcdowell's characters pays for his crimes, but thats until he feels the same torture and victimization he did to others. Alexander Large's then and only then really realizes what he has done and its until he feels the same amount of pain that he is truly sorry.<br /><br />In a way too Kubrick's message is that many people despite<br />all the feministic nonsense about rehabilation and sympathy<br />doesnt change dangerous and evil people. Thats obvious in todays age when we have somebody like George W. bush in power and a large growing known of "red" states supporting the evil.<br /><br />This is a must see that you must see time and time again.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6X0DAM87GN4.html">A3C6X0DAM87GN4</a><br/><p>Stanley Kubrick had the ability of always taking his viewers on a fantastic ride.

This is a MASTERPIECE!<br />To see Alex's reign of TERROR to his capture from the police to<br />his being cured/sickness and his recovery are some of the best moments<br />I have ever seen on celluloid.  I have just seen this for the first<br />time and it is easily in my tops for film.  please buy this now!<br />Wait you are still reading?  Stop right now and-you're still reading?<br />Go to add cart or put on wish list but please own this movie for<br />in time it will own you........<br /><br />WELL-WELL,WELL,WELL.....WELL,WELL,WELL,WELL  IF IT ISN'T LITTLE<br />ALEX...LONG TIME NO VIDDY DROOG,HOW GOES_______Dim</p></br><a href="../users/A17D77DFID0GZG.html">A17D77DFID0GZG</a><br/><p>It's hard to believe that this movie was released in 1971, for it's almost as powerful today.  And like most Kubrick films, this brutally cold satire isn't for everyone.<p>Kubrick has a knack of showing the world violence in  a way that makes us pause, makes us think, much like Sam Peckinpaw did in  the classic "The Wild Bunch".  The audience is confronted with one brutal  image after another, revealing the insanity of it all.  And much like  Kubrick's "Barry Lyndon", we have a cold-hearted hero? that we quickly come  to despise.  Yet, by the time the film winds down to its closing, our  feelings for this vile lad has changed.  But Kubrick doesn't let Alex off  the hook, nor society, nor the viewer.<p>Kudos to Malcom McDowell who  played Alex, the anti-social leader of a bunch of misfits.  His performance  was second to none.  Between 1 and 10, "A Clockwork Orange" gets a solid 9,  even today.</p></br><a href="../users/A38U2M9OAEJAXJ.html">A38U2M9OAEJAXJ</a><br/><p>"A Clockwork Orange" is an envelope-pushing, eye-opening satire on society by Stanley Kubrick.  Viewers may point to "2001" or "Dr. Strangelove" as his best film, but for me, "A Clockwork Orange" was the movie that had Kubrick at the very top of his game as a filmmaker.  It's visually stunning, profoundly disturbing, exceedingly violent, and, in a warped way, downright hilarious.  Malcolm McDowell is Alex DeLarge, a troubled youth who spends his day blowing off school and his evenings with his "droogs," committing the most despicable of crimes.  Following a botched attempt to burglarize and rape a woman, Alex is arrested, tried, and jailed before he is used as a guinea pig for an experimental rehabilitation program that supposedly "cures" criminals.  He goes through the treatment, is released from prison, and the world that once embraced him gives him a very cold shoulder.  But did this treatment really "cure" Alex?  I won't reveal more, but I will say that this movie is completely unmissable.  I have been reading reviews from others who complain about the film's nonstop violence.  I think Kubrick pumped up the violence deliberately to properly articulate the horror of Alex's actions.  If that bothers you, then rent "Harry Potter."  For the rest of us, "A Clockwork Orange" is a straight-up classic that's one of my very favorite movies ever.  It's a landmark in cinema that shouldn't be overlooked.</p></br><a href="../users/AY12DBB0U420B.html">AY12DBB0U420B</a><br/><p>In the late 60s and early 70s, I was very interested in artsy movies and I'd attend films at several of San Diego's art theaters. Most of the films were foreign. At that time a very-highly-acclaimed film was released to the major theaters and that was Stanley Kubrick's "A Clockwork Orange" and it was X rated, amazingly  enough. The X rating was for the violence content not what you might be thinking. Well, it was a pretty violent film at the time but would be pretty mild by today's standards. I was really taken back by the film. It was quite unlike anything I'd seen up to that time and I was talking about it for several years thereafter. Well, I recently found a new "A Clockwork Orange" DVD on my favorite bargain rack and I snapped it up in an instant. The film is now just about 40 years old and has held up remarkably well.<br /><br />The basic story in "A Clockwork Orange" had to do with a small group of English hoodlums who got their kicks by savagely beating people up and other assorted violence. It was a random and very impersonal striking out and finally they were caught after the leader caused the death of one of his innocent victims and was sent off to prison for an extended period. While in prison, he became part of an experimental rehabilitation program to attempt to cure those with excessively violent tendencies. He was proclaimed cured and then released back into society. His cure proved to be quite a burden for him. It's an interesting story and can be endlessly argued from a wide variety of viewpoints. It's very well done and the DVD adaptation is excellent. I didn't enjoy it as much in viewing it as I did the first time, but it's a classic movie and is well worth anyone's viewing time, if they can stand the violence.<br /><br />Gary Peterson</p></br></body></html>

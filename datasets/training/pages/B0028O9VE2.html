Her choice, "Spanglish", came first. It wasn't hugely attractive to me--I've never been much of an Adam Sandler fan (excluding Punch Drunk Love, which was a hoot), and Tea Leoni has to answer for her appearance in the awful "Sudden Impact". One potential positive was direction by James Brooks, who did Terms of Endearment (which in retrospect was quite similar to Steel Magnolias) about 20 years ago.<br /><br />I hung in for the entire 130 minutes of this tale of culture clash in Southern California. A Mexican women and her young daughter emigrate to the U.S. After six years working for peanuts in the barrio where everyone speaks Spanish, Flor (the woman) realizes that she needs to enter the Anglo world to find a better paying job, which she finds as a housekeeper for Sandler, Leoni and family. Sandler is a successful chef. Leoni is an achievement-oriented basket case. The Hispanic actress and her daughter are gorgeous. Cloris Leachman has a nice turn as Leoni's mother. The girl who plays the Claskys' daughter is terrific, but I just couldn't get past Sandler and Leoni to really enjoy this film, even though the story has some resonance and wasn't necessarily resolved in the "happily-ever after" fashion that you'd expect. The title refers both to the culture clash, and to the housekeeper's belated efforts to learn English, so as to better control the Claskys' influence on her daughter's life.<br /><br />I think most folks would enjoy this one better than I did (the rest of my family did). As a warning to parents, despite the PG (13) rating there's one clothed, but fairly explicit otherwise, sex scene between the two stars (ride 'em Tea!)</p></br><a href="../users/A39IBJB2PBVC7I.html">A39IBJB2PBVC7I</a><br/><p>To describe this film as a "chick flick" is to offend chicks everywhere.  While it is clearly aimed at the adult, female, box of tissues, slumber party set - I cherish the notion that these individuals are far too smart and with it to be taken in by such twaddle.  With the exception of Adam Sandler, (who couldn't act his age, much less act in a movie), the cast is excellent - so what's the problem?  Primarily it's that Spanglish never settles in on an approach, a pitch, a point of view.  At times it attempts, and misses, comedy.  At other moments it seems to want to be taken seriously as social commentary, which is laughable.  It comes closest to finding its heart in the relationship between mother and daughter, but frequently these scenes are glib and manipulative.  In a case like this, the blame must be laid at the director's feet, and the author of the abominable screenplay.<br /><br />These characters are not drawn; they're cut out of paper.  Deborah, in particular, played brilliantly by Tea Leoni, is so shrill and extreme that she quickly becomes a caricature, severely undermining the picture's chances of success.  John, played by Sandler, is certainly the most low key chef in the universe, he is so passive and uninteresting that one wonders how he could make milk toast, much less gourmet meals.  Cloris Leachman is brilliant as always - but it's never a good sign when a minor character threatens to walk away with a movie.  Compounding these egregious flaws, Spanglish is yet another SoCal film where folks in the picture biz examine their own neighborhoods and lifestyle - are these guys really so lazy - or narcissistic - that they won't leave the state?  An excellent performance by Sarah Steeles helps, as does an absolute star turn by Shelbie Bruce, but not enough to make sense of this hodgepodge.<br /><br />What saves Spanglish from the dustbin of cinema is an Oscar-caliber performance by the enchanting Paz Vega, who first won me over in 10 Items or Less.  Vega does more with reaction takes and other forms of non-verbal communication than all the other actors put together.  Besides being crazy beautiful, she has that ability to express a broad range of emotions easily, casually.  I'm told that when they made this film Vega did not even speak English, and learned her lines phonetically.  If true, her achievement is even more remarkable.  As a showcase for Paz Vega, Spanglish is worth your time; she is nothing short of brilliant.  Beyond that, it's just another grab bag of shopworn SoCal clich&eacute;s, two-dimensional stereotypes, and cheesy attempts to tug on your heartstrings without earning the right.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>I just want to say that Tea Leoni has quickly become one of my favorite actresses.  She has shown in the past two or three years that she has talent I NEVER noticed before.  Anyways, I just wanted to make mention of that while it was on my mind.  Spanglish was a film I had wanted to see but never had the urge to spend money to see, but since the library had it and it was a free rental I picked it up over the weekend.  I just want to say that although it may have not been marketed perfectly, you have to know walking into this film that it is by no means a 'comedy' in the sense that most 'comedies' are today.  It's more along the lines of 'The Family Stone' just not as good.  It's a drama with funny scenes.  The heart of this movie is not to make you laugh but to make you think.  The story revolves around Flor Moreno (Paz Vega), a single Latina who is strugling to raise her pre-teen daughter Christina (Shelbie Bruce) in LA.  She gets a job house cleaning for the Clasky family, but she never could have known what she was getting herself or her daughter into.  The Clasky's are not your typical family...their off, just a little.  John (Adam Sandler) is a top-notch chef and the 'sane' one in the family.  Deborah (Leoni) is the high strung, depressed and over whelmed mother who doesn't know how to deal with herself let alone her family.  Deborah's mother (Cloris Leachman) is a drunk ex-jazz singer who serves as the reason and also the solution to most of Deborah's problems.  Bernice (Sarah Steele), the overweight daughter, is going through those normal teenage years and is starting to butt heads with her mother enough to loath her for it.  Oh yeah, and they have a son but he never speaks.  As Flor moves in with the Clasky's over the summer the families start to interact in ways neither of them expected and bonds are formed between each and evrey one of them, while walls are built around others.  Writer/director James L. Brooks for the most part gets this very right for he creates people that we care about while painting a picture that is very believable.  The actors, especially Leoni, really sink their teeth into their roles, and Paz is such a warm hearted delight she's such a joy to watch on the screen.  Sandler tackled a role I would have never expected him too and he surprised me by pulling it off.  As I said, this is a dramedy with a lot of heart, a lot of humor and a lot of sincerity.  I'd pick it up, if you haven't already.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IOJE0W1NXOSE.html">A1IOJE0W1NXOSE</a><br/><p>This movie starts out with the college application to Princeton by a young Hispanic girl who is writing about the most influential person in her life--her mother (Paz Vega).  She relates the story of how her mother was hired to be a housekeepr by a neurotic Anglo woman (Tea Leoni)who demeaned her daughter for being overweight and who did not appreciate her long-suffering husband (Adam Sandler).  Paz's warm and accepting manner wins over both Sandler and his daughter, but does not endear her to Leoni, who spoils Vega's daughter with outings she does not have permission to take.  This movie touches on issues of race and social class, and has surprising depth.  As many of the other reviewers, I expected this to be a shallow comedy, but I was pleasantly surprised by its thought-provoking content.</p></br><a href="../users/A1V3IO23FZFF9L.html">A1V3IO23FZFF9L</a><br/><p>Spanglish, I was hoping, would be a great movie but instead it's just sweet. It has it funny parts, by leachman, and it touching parts too. All is in the film. What it lacks is it lags a little too long in some parts.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KAR9G699RM56.html">A1KAR9G699RM56</a><br/><p>Spanglish is about a life-shaping incident in the life of one Hispanic girl, where her mom goes to work, and temporarily lives with the American family.  The family that they are saying with though is rather dysfunctional though, and the narrator's mother's Hispanic heritage adds just another difficulty to this already hectic family life.<br /><br />Overall this movie was okay, and, for those readers, rather reminiscent of Sandra Cisnero's novels.  Overall, there is a touch of dysfunction, a touch of Hispanic American culture clash, and a touch of romance.<br /><br />The only reason this was not too pleasurable was that the sub-plots took too long to interconnect.  Whether it was Adam Sandler's (American dad) family or the Hispanic family the movie was about their troubles but there was nothing being accomplished.<br /><br />Like I said though, overall it was ok and Adam Sandler played a particularly strong role as the chef/father/nucleus of the hectic family unit.  Check it out for a simple yet slightly deep film, temporary amusement if nothing else.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>A lot of good directors will tell you good stories can often fall apart if the casting is bad. There are particular actors and actresses that are not terrible in their respective films but they feel woefully out of place among the talent around them (Katie Holmes in Batman Begins, Winona Ryder in Alien: Resurrection or Denise Richards in the World is Not Enough). In this case, it's Adam Sandler who actually doesn't even feel miscast. He does a very respectable job at getting away from his Happy Gilmore/Billy Madison schtick but this time instead of being miscast, he just seems like a lightning rod for miscasting rants from people.<br /><br />The film actually centers around Flor and Cristina, a Spanish mother and daughter respectively who move to California. Flor ends up taking a job as a housekeeper at a really nice house. Only thing is she can't speak any English whatsoever so that causes some initial problems. Things still continue when both of them move in and Cristina finds herself being at a huge center of attention from the wife Deborah. Deborah is shifts moods radically while her husband John is an unhappy restaurant chef, even when he gets a 4 star review. The film mainly centers around different styles of parenting and dysfunction that can happen in families.<br /><br />Now I should get this out of the way: Sandler doesn't feel miscast, in fact he's quite good, despite some Sandler-esque bits (his dialogue during a rather strange love scene is very reminiscent of his other stuff) but I think his presence suggests this is going to be a low-brow humor geared to frat boys. The real stars are Paz Vega and Shelbie Bruce, the headstrong but slightly stubborn mother and the wise beyond her years daughter respectively. In fact Bruce steals the show where she not only has to translate a fight with John and Flor but she nails the shifting emotional states of both characters. Tea Leoni I always felt gets really bad reps with stating she's a terrible actress (although her performance in Jurassic Park III made me wish a dinosaur did snack on her) but here I loved her.<br /><br />The film's main problem is its running time. Ever watch a movie that felt long or was long but looking back on it you couldn't figure out where you'd take the scissors if you had the chance? Spanglish to me is similar in that at 2 hours and 10 minutes it does seem a bit long yet I couldn't tell you what scenes required additional editing since they're important in and of themselves. Not to mention it's not exactly the most cliche-free plot as there's some scenes that are going to be obvious and when they happen they don't really surprise (a possible romance between John and Flor, Deborah and her mother having an all-out or jealousy among Flor and Deborah) but the film's entertaining anyway.<br /><br />Should you watch the movie? Personally I say so. It's rare lately to watch a good comedy movie that never felt as if all you'd get out of it was laughs.</p></br><a href="../users/A14Q6R4481YFFG.html">A14Q6R4481YFFG</a><br/><p>Many of the other reviews obsess over some of the film's minor flaws, like the writing out of the Clasky's son and the sotto voce guilt trip that Brooks is playing on American audiences.  Content yourselves with this folks: he could've ruined the race-and-class issues inherent in a film like this, the way "Grand Canyon" and "Crash" butchered race issues and "Maid in Manhattan" butchered class/ethnic issues.<br /><br />That said: great acting, great morality play.<br /><br />Acting. Shelbie Bruce as Cristina Moreno stole the show.  The simultaneous translation provided in the confrontation between Flor Morenoa and John Clasky is a classic.  Adam Sandler is Adam Sandler, and known quantity whether you like him or not.  I like him.  Tea Leoni: loved her every since the short-lived Fox sitcom "Flying Blind."  I guess that dates me.  She gives 110% and plays her role at 110%, just below the caricature of an Anglo housewife-overachiever.  Sarah Steele was very good as well.<br /><br />Morality play.  Any film whose moral basis is strength in the face of adversity is OK by me, and very refreshing.  The film makes this point time and time again: the flight to Mexico, Flor's decision to devote time to Cristina, returning money for fear of its corrupting influence, non-consummation of a desired relationship because of marriage commitment.  All these themes are worked in to Spanglish with wit and grace.</p></br><a href="../users/A146D2LYLICNLS.html">A146D2LYLICNLS</a><br/><p>I was pleasantly surprised by "Spanglish" and found myself enjoying it a lot more than I thought I would. I would actually rate it 3 out of 5 stars if it weren't for the top-notch performance by Paz Vega, who IMO steals the show. By playing a maid, her role unfortunately does not break away from the stereotypical Hollywood role for a Latina actress. However, she is given so much screen time in this movie that she has every chance to breathe life into it, which she does in every scene she is in. And what's even better, having her take center stage lets her avoid getting swallowed up by the starpower of Adam Sandler, Tea Leoni and Cloris Leachman. Although I agree with other reviewers that this movie focuses a lot (perhaps even too much) on Deborah's neurosis, I think Flor is the one whom this movie is really about. After all, the movie is narrated from the first-person viewpoint of Flor's daughter Cristina (Shelbie Bruce) who mainly talks about her mother's experiences with the family.<br /><br />In terms of the other performances, everyone does a credible job. Adam Sandler proves that he can take on a more serious role, although there were certain scenes when I almost expected him to suddenly go slapstick on us. The only scene that I found pointless is when Tea Leoni climaxes on top of Sandler with her clothes on. This scene was majorly out of place in the movie and was rather stupid and unfunny.<br /><br />All in all, "Spanglish" is a movie that would be fairly run-of-the-mill if it weren't for the injected Latin flavor of Paz Vega, who spices things up and makes it worth seeing. This is her first major blockbuster movie in the American market, and now that she has gotten the exposure she needs, I hope she can continue to have success with her future projects.</p></br><a href="../users/A1435P5AMCPB3X.html">A1435P5AMCPB3X</a><br/><p>First off, this is not your regular "Adam Sandler" Film.  It should not have been marketed that way.  He was the big name to get people into the theater, and he did a good job at his role, but Paz Vega is the true lead in this.  Paz plays a immigrant from mexico who decides to make a better life for her and her daughter by getting hired on as a housekeeper for an eccentric, upper class housewife who is clueless about daily life.  Adam Sandler plays the homeowner husband who just tries to hold life all together, and is just as grounded as Paz's character.  The movie follows the relationship of a housekeeper and the family over about a 6-12 month period, through the eyes of the housekeeper's daugther.  Despite a huge language barrier, bonds are made.  This is not really a comedy at all, but has it's humorous parts.  Good flick to just take in.  You'll either like it, or push it aside.  Worth a spin though, and give it a chance. Good rental.</p></br><a href="../users/ALJGB7XHPFCR.html">ALJGB7XHPFCR</a><br/><p>I have never been an Adam Sandler fan; however, this movie is really wonderful. Sandler has matured as an actor and is apparently taking roles with more meat and less physical comedy. His character is the polar opposite of Tea Leoni's. His love for their children and his understanding of human nature just shine through. Leoni is perfect as the neurotic, narcissistic wife and mother. A wonderful foil to Sandler's even tempered character. While you might think this is a great date movie, I think it's a better married with children couple date movie. Lots of truisms here. Favorite line: When Leoni's character tells her mother she isn't helping with her low self esteem, and the mother replies " these days your low self esteem is just good common sense". Sandler just might make it to my must see list for the future.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDNTB7377YH2.html">A1CDNTB7377YH2</a><br/><p>This is one of the more enjoyable movies I have seen in the past year!  It focuses on a single Mexican mother (Flor), who is trying to raise her daughter by working two jobs.  When she realizes that she needs to spend more time with her daughter, she talks to a friend about helping her find a job that pays at least the combined salary of her two jobs.<br /><br />The friend takes her to the home of a wealthy couple to be a housekeeper/nanny.  This is a major change for her because since she came to the US, she has not ventured outside the LA Mexican barrio.  On top of that Flor speaks zero English and the family for whom she will work for speaks no Spanish.<br /><br />Flor also learns fast that the wealthy mother is a control freak and her restaurant owner/master chef husband (Adam Sandler) is a wimp.  The daughter is a sweet girl but badly treated by her mother because she is overweight and not "perfect" in her studies.  Flor develops a bond with the daughter and when Flor is forced to bring her own daughter to live with the family, Flor bonds with Sandler because they both have very strong ties to their daughters.<br /><br />This movie seemed to be a tear-jerker for most of the female patrons that I saw at the theater and was a very enjoyable, fun movie for all the males.  The actress who plays Flor's daughter looks like a comer, who will be a big star someday!</p></br><a href="../users/A1TKM36EYEQNSM.html">A1TKM36EYEQNSM</a><br/><p>If it were possible to rate this movie higher than a four but not quite a five I would do so.  This is really a great love story, more about a love of life and how mixed up we all are at times in our relationships.<br /><br />We have a housekeeper who has nothing but her daughter, character and her morality living with a very rich and somewhat well known family in Malibu or Beverly Hills, depending on the timing of the movie.  It is fast paced, sometimes funny, sometimes sad and you also experience a whole wide range of emotions.<br /><br />Brooks does a good job of developing the characters and even the underlying theme has some basis in real life.  Tia Leoni plays a very frustrated housewife who co-owns her husbands 4 star restaurant.  This is a unique role for me to see Leoni in.  I have enjoyed her in Family Man and Deep Impact, but Leoni is superb in this role.  At times you just think, where does she get off with her approach to life?  If she were a real person, you would just be infuriated at her.<br /><br />Cloris Leachman plays her mom, she does a good job in her later years, and it is nice to see someone of her age still acting.<br /><br />This is also a different role for Sandler and he, like Leoni, show that he can truly act, that comedy is not the only thing he is capable of.  You just really like him in this movie.<br /><br />There are some very touching scenes between Sandler and his daughter and the housekeeper and her daughter.<br /><br />This is a good movie, not much language, a little intense at times, but fun and a good story.  Spanglish is worth it.</p></br><a href="../users/A82LIVYSX6WZ9.html">A82LIVYSX6WZ9</a><br/><p>Paz Vega starts a new job as a maid for restaurant owner and dad Adam Sandler (Punch Drunk-Love, The Longest Yard) and his talkative wife Tea Leoni (Deep Impact, The Family Man). Leoni has 2 kids, a son and a daughter and Vega has one daughter who has to translate for her and soon after Vega starts to learn English on her own. Cloris Leachman (History Of The World Part 1, High Anxiety), in a superb supporting role, plays Leoni's crazy mother. A good natured movie such as this is a breathe of fresh air with a beautiful performane by Paz Vega and a excellent role for Adam Sandler who still has the funny guy in him but he show's us again he can do other things. Tea Leoni's charcter is hard to like though Leoni is perfect for the part. The kids are all great. Love your mother and family is the theme for this movie and James L. Brooks (As Good As It Gets, The Simpsons) does it all too well. Thomas Haden Church (Sideways, Rolling Kansas) stars as the man Leoni has the affair</p></br><a href="../users/A2QHM5HBSIXRL4.html">A2QHM5HBSIXRL4</a><br/><p>"Spanglish" suffers from a near-death by over-poignancy.  It's earnest and tries so hard to please.  There is a lot to like and recommend here, though.<br /><br />In general, I'm not anti-Adam Sandler, butI love how he's consistently overcome doubters throughout his career.  Here, however, though he plays it straight the entire way through, I couldn't help thinking that I was watching Adam Sandler self-consciously taking on the bigimportantserious role.  In some of the key scenes with Paz Vega, he seemed uncomfortable.<br /><br />Speaking of Ms. Vega, she's the start of the many things that are good about Spanglish.  Like many people, I'm tired of the star-making machine trying to cram Penelope Cruz down my throat.  I like Ms. Cruz as much as the next person, but that just isn't happening, Tom Cruise or no Tom Cruise.  Let's hope Ms. Vega becomes everything that Team Cruz has tried to attain.  At the very least, Ms. Vega owes Ms. Cruz a thank you for chopping down the timber in front of her.  Ms. Vega had to learn both English and Mexican-inflected Spanish for her role, so its not all natural charm and eye-popping good looks up there.<br /><br />Other delights include:<br /><br />Cloris Leachman...still a scene-stealer 40 years (!) after the Mary Tyler Moore show made her a household name.  The Executive Producer of MTM was a young James L. Brooks, showing that it never hurts to make friends and be nice to people.<br /><br />Shelbie Bruce...as Ms. Vega's daughter Cristina, she has one incredible scene in which she acts as translator between Vega and Sandler, taking on not only the words, but also the intonations, body language and passion of the original speaker.  It's the second-best scene in the movie.<br /><br />T&eacute;a Leoni...as Sandler's wife.  Ms. Leoni is this country's best physical comedienne on the big screen ('Flirting With Disaster' anyone?), and she proves it again here, with a hilarious, over-the-top, not-quite-a-sex scene, replete with jogging bra and running shoes in which Sandler is only a convenient bystander.  This one should go right up there with Meg Ryan's famous "I'll have what she's having" scene in "When Harry Met Sally."</p></br><a href="../users/A3R90OGE1EACZE.html">A3R90OGE1EACZE</a><br/><p>I thought that this movie would be pretty interesting. The previews for it made it seem like it was funny. I however found it very boring in parts and sort of stupid. The charactors were either over the top or fall asleep dull with very little middle ground. Also the running time was too long, it says it was just a little over 2 hours, but to me it felt like much more.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HJB9J5O5CLPB.html">A2HJB9J5O5CLPB</a><br/><p>This is a sweet film, not exactly realistic; everyone seems to be a little too much on type.  Now I did not say everyone was stereotyped, just actors playing a type.  Cloris Leachman is the drunken mother ignored by her striving, seemingly perfect daughter, Tea Leoni.  Adam Sandler plays, er Adam Sandler, a successful, quirky, restrained Jewish guy.  Paz Vega is smart, wise, Mexican, immigrant, and poor housekeeper to Sandler's two kids and cloying, controlling wife.  Flour has a daughter out of wedlock (How did that happen to such a wise woman?)and then takes the unhappy rich family under her wings as much as the language barrier will bear.  That is it.  Sandler is unhappy with narcissistic Leoni and well he should be.  He pouts and grovels.  Gradually he comes to appreciate Vega as the counterpoint to his neurotic wife.<br /><br />I commend Sandler's attempt to move on from his dopey caricature, his screwball, gross-out roles.  I am thinking of the underrated, Punch Drunk Love, when I say he's going adult in comedy or drama situations.  Keep trying Adam.  Someday you will be real.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GKPMHV4U64IY.html">A3GKPMHV4U64IY</a><br/><p>This is a strange story told from the point of view of a daughter writing a college application essay.<br /><br />Tea Leoni is a rich woman who has just hired a new housekeeper who only speaks Spanish, a language Leoni cannot speak.  Her husband, Sandler, is head chef at a fine restaurant.  Both Leoni and the housekeeper have young daughters.  Tea also has a son.<br /><br />Tea Leoni sees the housekeeper's daughter as the daughter she would love to have and sets out to make it true in action if not in fact.  This causes stresses all across the board.  Eventually Sandler shows up and meets the housekeeper.  Eventually love begins to blossom between the two but both know it can not be allowed to go anywhere.<br /><br />In the end everyone seems to have had a fight with everyone else (not really true but it sure seems like it) and the film ends in a way most audiences will not like but will eventually convince themselves is the best that could have happened given the circumstances.  My real problem with this long long film is that it seemed very choppy.  I felt I was watching a film adaptation of a long novel and that crucial scenes had been left out.  This is apparently not the case but everyone I watched it with felt the same way.  We all agreed it was strange, choppy, erratic, and definitely NOT a comedy.  But do not be fooled by this, you will see some very good acting from most of the cast (especially the housekeeper's daughter), it is just the story that suffers and no amount of good acting can fill that in.</p></br><a href="../users/A33IZJVCKFKDPU.html">A33IZJVCKFKDPU</a><br/><p>There is a disclaimer that should be attached to this movie.  If you come into this movie expecting to see a Adam Sandler movie that resembles Happy Gilmore, Billy Madison, or even Big Daddy, then you will be incredibly disappointed.  Yes James L. Brooks is one of the writers for The Simpsons, and the writer of Taxi, but this is anything but a slapstick comedy.<br /><br />This movie is described perfectly by its title.  Spanglish can mean the lack of communication between cultures, but for this movie it represents the lack of understanding of people's feelings and the lack of communication amongst husband and wife, or a whole family in general.  And yes, there is a lot of spanish spoken to people who don not understand the language.<br /><br />The movie is about John Clasky (Sandler) a four-star chef who works nights, and his wife, the neurotic Deborah (Tea Leoni) who is  used to working days. Consequently, they need a little help around the house. Deborah's mother (Cloris Leachman), a washed-up jazz singer who spends her time in the bottom of a wine glass, isn't much help. The Claskys run an ad for a maid and hire Flor (Paz Vega), a Mexican immigrant who so hated to leave her native land for the bustle of Los Angeles that she's never learned English in her six years in America.  The familes relationship is really good until Deborah wants to move into a summer rental home in Malibu.  She wants Flor to tag along, but there is one problem.  Flor has a daughter named Christina, whom she has never mentioned to the Claskys, and Flor doesn't want to leave Christina behind.  So Deborah insists that Christina can also live with the family.  Then the trouble starts.  Deborah takes Christina shopping without Flor's permission.  John gives Christina $640 for finding sea glass.  Flor, being a very proud Mexican lady, does not like the Claskys doing these things for her daughter and becomes upset.  Then new relationships are built, some are destroyed and people learn to respect others wishes.<br /><br />As for the performances, this is Sandler's best to date.  Tea Lioni does a really good job at being someone that there is no possible way of liking.  Cloris Leachman steals many scenes and is always funny when she is one screen.  She must have had some good guidence from Mel Brooks for all those years.  The stand out performance is Paz Vega.  She cannot express herself too much in words, so most of her expression comes her facial expressions.  Kind of like Johnny Depp in Edward Scissorhands.  She resembles Penelope Cruz a lot, but is a better actress.<br /><br />The movies itself is really good, one of the years best movies.  The only real problem that I had with the movie is that is seemed to be about 10 minutes long.  Other than that, there was nothing else that bothered me.  James L. Brooks has done is again.  It seems like everytime he starts to write, something good is formed.  And Spanglish may be his best to date.</p></br><a href="../users/A1U6B2LDK3BUVU.html">A1U6B2LDK3BUVU</a><br/><p>Disappointing.  I agree with the professional reviewer on this site who said that Adam Sandler was in over his head in this role.  He does poorly in it.  Why is he played as such a sap?  Why is it that you want to smack him every time he fails to assert himself?<br /><br />I don't buy the multi-cultural nonsense either, the big deal about the Hispanic daughter losing her culture.  What kind of issue is that?  What kind of moron thought that was a big issue?  Oh hell, you don't want to hang out with Anglos, you don't want to go to a prestigious school, you just want to live in the Barrio.  Oh give me a break.  It's idiocy.  A non-issue for dummies.<br /><br />The film is simply a big flop.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>I must admit that it took a little while for "Spanglish" to completely win me over - but win me over it did thanks to its sharply observed social commentary and winning performances by a first-rate cast.  At first, the film threatens to be swept away by a tidal wave of stereotypical characters and cliches, but it doesn't take long for the subtleties and complexities to kick in and to lift the movie to a higher level.<br /><br />This is James L. Brooks' witty take on the cultural divide that separates the "master class" from the "servant class" in multi-ethnic Los Angeles.  The Hispanic side of the equation is represented by Flor Moreno (Paz Vega), a gorgeous single mother living in Mexico who heads to America to start a new life for herself and her daughter.  Eventually, despite the fact that she cannot speak English, Flor finds a job as a fulltime housekeeper and nanny for a wealthy white family named the Claskys.  The wife, Deborah (Tea Leoni), is a deeply neurotic limousine liberal who drives her family crazy with her obsessive compulsiveness and lack of a clear mental focus.  Her husband, John, is a mild-mannered master chef who has become completely exasperated by the intensely mercurial nature of his wife's behavior and moods, and who yearns for nothing more than a little peace and harmony on the home front.  The Claskys also have a sweet-tempered but homely daughter, Bernice, who bonds with Flor's beautiful daughter, Christina, who narrates the tale.<br /><br />What distinguishes "Spanglish" from so many other American comedies is its staunch refusal to adhere to a cookie-cutter formula.  Brooks has written a screenplay that allows the characters room to breathe and to interact with one another in complex and surprising ways.  He doesn't even feel the need to tie up all the loose ends in the closing minutes.  He is perfectly willing to let the characters continue to live their lives even after the closing credits have scrolled by.  What he captures best is the subtle tug-of-war that develops between the two mothers over their respective daughters, particularly Deborah's intense devotion to Christina, which seems partly a result of a genuine desire to help her get ahead in life, and partly an unconscious preference for this beautiful child over her own overweight daughter.  Brooks understands the sore spots inherent in parent/child interactions as well as relationships in general.  Naturally, a romantic attraction eventually develops between John and Flor, but one that is handled with charm, delicacy and tact.<br /><br />Sandler and Vega give warmth, touching performances, and Shelbie Bruce, Sarah Steele and Cloris Leachman offer superb support.  Leoni starts off so over-the-top that one fears she will throw the entire movie off-kilter.  But damned if she doesn't grow on you, as she turns what could have been a psychological gargoyle into a sympathetic woman filled with feelings of inadequacy and self-doubt.<br /><br />Happily, the humor in the film arises naturally from the characters and situations and almost never feels desperate or forced.  And, indeed, there are some very hearty laughs generously laced throughout the movie.<br /><br />"Spanglish' doesn't try to "solve" the ethnic and race relations problems that still plague America's largest cities.  However, in its own quiet, humor-filled way, it reminds us that the caste system is still very much a reality in a country that prides itself on its supposed lack of class-consciousness.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EFS5PV3HOFDI.html">A1EFS5PV3HOFDI</a><br/><p>Although others will disagree with me, I found Spanglish as dry as burnt toast. There's literally no humor or romance, and the movie drags on for two hours without really doing much of anything. Tea leoni (Family Man, Jurassic Park 3) seems almost bored with the script, and Adam Sandler can't even hope to liven the dull boring moments that constantly shroud the movie.<br /><br />Want to watch a good romantic comedy with Adam as our star? Try Big Daddy or the Wedding Singer. Even Fifty first dates was better than Spanglish. Adam and Drew Barrymore definatly had more chemistry going than him and Paz Vega (Flor). As for Adam Sandler being a chef, or  his family delightfully eccentric. All I can say is "I so desperatly wish it where so." Maybe the movie might have had more of an appeal. Otherwise, it leaves you with a huge sense of doubt.<br /><br />My advice? For what its worth rent this movie, or better yet try borrowing off a friend. Then if you like it enough buy it, otherwise you might have a big dissapointment in store. Even if you are desperatly crazy about Adam Sandler.</p></br><a href="../users/A2VD2D1QHCMF9Q.html">A2VD2D1QHCMF9Q</a><br/><p>This movie is worthwhile for the opportunity to watch the Spanish actress Paz Vega as Flor.  She is beautiful, and charming, although her character in this movie is a bit predictable.  The other main characters I found offensive, but perhaps that is part of the plot.<br /><br />Sandler has a problem completing a sentence.  He plays a wimpish character who, as Flor said, acts like a old Mexican housewife.  And Leoni's character was too abrasive, abusive, stupid and self-preoccupied to be believed.  That she and Sandler and their two children were part of the same family just did not make any sense, either in real life or in fiction.<br /><br />The movie barely had a story line, so without interesting characters there is nothing there.  But watch it just to see Paz Vega.</p></br><a href="../users/A24ZFFRQ4MG3XL.html">A24ZFFRQ4MG3XL</a><br/><p>I love Adam Sandler usually.  He doesn't have to star in a comedy for me to like him, in fact I was looking forward to seeing him in a drama.  But this was so long and so boring and so disappointing.  I think he did a fine job, but needs a better movie to be in (and cut his hair)</p></br><a href="../users/AXV9GS0TMSVW.html">AXV9GS0TMSVW</a><br/><p>Perhaps one of the great travesties of a film like this is the failure in marketing.  James L. Brooks makes serious movies that have a few laughs.  If we zoom in on his past films, we see the heavy detail given to the characters.  Spanglish is a character piece with some very obvious themes.  It's not very funny, but it's not supposed to be.  Fans of Sandler's slapstick comedy may be a bit taken by the understated performance here.  Moreover, they might be surprised by the fact that he isn't the "star," as previews might suggest.  Rather, this is an ensemble piece driven by Paz Vega, who plays a Mexican immigrant who works as a housekeeper for Sandler's family in the film. Vega is brilliant, but Sandler quietly steals the show in a performance that shows his range as an actor.  He's neither comedic, as he is in comedies like "Big Daddy" or "The Wedding Singer," or terribly manic, as he was in the quirky comic-drama "Punch Drunk Love."  Rather, his performance is understated, honest, and very precise, as a hard-working father trying to find peace within his family.<br /><br />The film's success relies heavily on how the characters play off each other, especially to Vega, whose entrance into the lives of everyone around her affect them and her.  It is about the communication or lack thereof between the characters.  Brooks brilliantly illustrates that language, in the literal sense, does not neccessarily equate with successful communication.  It's also not the only way to communicate effectively.  Brooks drives the point home in a very moving scene between Sandler and Vega and in the ending that may dissapoint some viewers.  It should at least illicit some discussion.<br /><br />The film's only failure is only in what people may make it out to be.  It is, in contrast to what many viewers may see, not about the experience of Mexican in a foreign society.  While there are scenes that illustrate the displacement of cultures, the film is more interested in the idea that culture is important in terms of honesty and showing who you truly are.  Some have criticized this film as white washing the Mexican American experience, and while the film is not an ideal illustration, that's not what it intends to be.  These aspects merely serve as a springboard for a film that has much  bigger ideas that speak to a much broader audience, whatever langauge they speak.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>Perhaps it's Adam Sandler that you want to see in `Spanglish,' James L Brooke's culture-clash drama. Yes, Sandler is surprisingly good with understated acting. He is good enough to make us forget his terrible near career-killing turn in `Little Nicky,' but let me remind you that this film is one of his recent attempts to undo his traditionally accepted image as comedian doing mainly madcap persona. This is not `The Wedding Singer' and it is meant that way.<br /><br />Young Mexican girl Christina (Shelbie Bruce) recounts how she and her beautiful mother Flor (Paz Vega) arrive at the Clasky Family and their gorgeous house in LA (it's `economy class,' she says), where Flor starts to work as a house keeper for a nervous and obsessive mom Deborah (Tea Leoni). Flor cannot speak English, but the fact is not a big problem among this dysfunctional family - see incredibly patient daddy John (Adam Sandler) first-rate chef so devoted to the family that he cannot say what he should to his nagging wife.<br /><br />Flor is after all a capable housekeeper, and of very affectionate disposition for that matter, so John is gradually attracted to her while to her dismay her daughter Christie is drawn to the rich life of the Clansky Family. Though the film gives some interesting supports, especially from deliciously off-beat comic performance as a retired jazz singer from Cloris Leechan, the budding romance between Sandler and Vega lacks chemistry, and is concluded with unconvincing ending.<br /><br />I know this is a matter of taste, but I found Tea Leoni's acting as the frivolous, self-obsessed mom interesting at first, but her constant one-note yelling and mugging gradually became annoying and irritating as the story went on. The character played by Leoni, who is better in recent `Fun with Dick and Jane,' gets alarmingly close to being monstrous.<br /><br />But if something or somebody should be praised for her freshness, naturalness, and most of all, radiating charms, Paz Vega should be the real star of `Spanglsih,' which, though well-intentioned and sporadically funny, is curiously devoid of the originality, or the quirky charms of the characters Brooks has been good at creating. The film is largely well-acted, and also amusing enough thanks to some of the one-liners, but everything about the characters looks oversimplified. And I totally disagree with the stilted and unnecessarily soapy ending.</p></br><a href="../users/AYWAY5MKLAITN.html">AYWAY5MKLAITN</a><br/><p>Take an emotinally unstable over-achiever mother<br /><br />Add a drunken mom . . .<br /><br />An Insecure Cook with heart . . .<br /><br />and a no-english speaking spanish  maid and you got yourself a fresh comedy in the tradition of AS GOOD AS IT GETS.

Brooks, the man who made "Terms of Endearment", "Broadcast News", "As Good As It Gets" and of course, "The Mary Tyler Moore Show", comes a dramedy that has two separate agendas that the filmmaker seems intent on integrating regardless of the resulting contrivances. The first is to show the plight of Mexican immigrants in their effort to realize economic betterment while concurrently maintaining their cultural identity. This part is worthy of screen treatment. The second is to show the underbelly of the liberal mindset and the seemingly rampant dysfunctional state of the family unit among the L.A. social elite. This part has been seriously misjudged.<br /><br />Let me tackle the problematic second part first. In an overly sincere mode, Adam Sandler portrays John Clasky, the hottest chef in a city where culinary celebrities are at the top of the heap. His professional life seems to be modeled after master chef Thomas Keller, who was exalted in the same way by food critics when he opened his "French Laundry" restaurant in Yountville (which is indeed fantastic). In fact, Keller appears in a pertinent extra on the making of the ideal late night sandwich, which includes the recipe as well. The challenge in accepting Sandler's performance is not his attempt to be taken seriously as Oscar-bait, but rather his apparently limited ability to convey the complexity underneath what seems to be the perfect man - understanding, compassionate (though too passive at key moments of conflict), a loving father. At this stage in his career, especially with his idiosyncratic tics (slurring his words, constant stooping, stumbling about), Sandler is simply not yet substantive enough an actor to pull off such a multi-dimensional role.<br /><br />But the real problem is the way Brooks conceives John's wife Deborah as a character. T&eacute;a Leoni has the unfortunate task of playing the aerobicized fishwife from hell, a former go-getter who was downsized out of her career as a commercial designer. Now Deborah is a horrifying mother who chokes the self-esteem out of her daughter (as much as it is inferred her mother did to her) and shamelessly pilfers the affections of her maid's daughter. She's a therapy-driven narcissist whose competitive impulses get in the way of any good intentions, and she's always apologizing for her actions, which Brooks hopes will endear her to us. It just doesn't work because Leoni, despite her obvious talent and beauty, is not likeable enough for us to care - Deborah is among the most exhausting, disreputable characters I have seen in a movie in ages (and that includes Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling in the documentary, "Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room"). The combination of Sandler and Leoni nearly torpedoes the movie completely.<br /><br />This leaves us with the movie's first agenda item, the fearful assimilation of immigrant Latinos. Brooks has found a luminous actress in Paz Vega, a Penelope Cruz look-alike (imagine the Almod&oacute;var possibilities in their joint casting), as Flor, the woman who escapes Mexico with her daughter to eventually find work as the Clasky maid. Vega injects a nice quality into Flor that is at once unselfish and proud, as Flor exhibits true backbone to her employers. The character, however, is idealized at the expense of presenting a figure as complex as the Claskys, especially as the story veers into the inevitable though not terribly credible attraction that develops between Flor and John. In fact, her innate nobility provides the framework for the story as it is essentially a flashback described by her daughter Cristina in what must have been the world's longest application essay to Princeton. In the end, we are expected to believe that Flor is too virtuous to have any personal desires, though there is still something resolutely selfish about pulling her daughter out of the scholarship-funded private school.<br /><br />Shelbie Bruce is excellent as the adolescent Cristina, especially as she cross-translates John's and Flor's argument and in a moment of unfiltered anger near the end. Sarah Steele is equally fine as the Clasky's overweight daughter Bernie, alternating between smart-mouth comments and palpable sadness. And finally in a good role again, Cloris Leachman displays her considerable skill in playing Deborah's alcoholic though self-aware mother, Evelyn, who tosses the best line to her daughter: "Your low self-esteem is simple common sense, dear." I only wish her character was fleshed out more to provide a better counterbalance to her awful daughter. Brooks should be commended for his high-mindedness here but docked for his hubris in having us accept these characters. The DVD has lots of extras, including enthusiastic audio commentary from Brooks with his editors Richard Marks and Tia Nolan and the addition of twelve deleted scenes again with the same trio providing comments. There is the brief Keller clip I mentioned, as well as an HBO First Look featurette that actually got me more excited about the movie than watching the movie itself.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CQON0P01BITL.html">A1CQON0P01BITL</a><br/><p>This was good.

At least that's what seems to be going on with James L. Brooks -- his latest film "Spanglish" feels like a tirade against a despised ex (which, rumor has it, it is). Paz Vega injects a bit of likability into the plot, but this comedy just seems like a bitter ride into marital dysfunction.<br /><br />Flor (Paz Vega) and her daughter emigrate to the United States, hoping for a better life. They find employment for Jamie Oliver-like John Clasky (Adam Sandler) and his neurotic wife Deborah (Tea Leoni), who have a very weird marriage -- he is a loving husband and father, with too much pressure; she is a screeching harridan who bugs her pudgy daughter to lose weight.<br /><br />Flor doesn't speak English, and the Claskys don't speak Spanish; her bilingual child has to translate for them. But a friendship starts to bloom between Flor and John, as Deborah starts to woo Flor's pretty young daughter away from her, and alienates her own daughter.<br /><br />A comedy that bangs you over the head with a message is bad enough. A comedy that just bangs you over the head is even worse. This is another one of the mature Adam Sandler movies -- you know, the ones where he is called on to play a non-dolt. Unfortunately, this movie isn't worthy of such an attempt.<br /><br />While the movie technically revolves around Flor and John's lives, the obnoxious self-absorbed Deborah dominates the plot. If you can get past Brooks' ridiculous bitterness, there actually a smothered message in the story about Flor. Unfortunately, it seems to be that if a person immigrates to the US, they shouldn't consider it "their" country, or let their kids do so. The writing has a few good lines (especially from Deborah's alcoholic mother), but stays tepid most of the time.<br /><br />Tea Leoni isn't a terribly good actress, but she's given a positively loathsome character in Deborah -- she's obsessed with her body, ignorant of others' feelings, and obnoxious even in the bedroom. (Yes, Brooks takes us THERE) Sandler's so-so performance is overshadowed by Leoni's harpy performance, especially since you can't see why he's such a devoted husband. Only Paz Vega gives a performance of real nuance and ability.<br /><br />The bile that spews all over "Spanglish" keeps it from being a moderately charming love/family comedy. Save your issues for your therapist, John. They don't make for good movies.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MUD2VY9HWFXQ.html">A2MUD2VY9HWFXQ</a><br/><p>This is a good film worth watching at least once. Good example of different ethnicities learning to work together. The film moves at a steady pace, has some charming comedic moments, and is overall enjoyable. Won't give the story away, but I do recommend this film for it's light hearted comedy and excellent performances. Tea Leoni is quite exceptional, and Penelope Cruz look-a-like Paz Vega shows promise as an up and comer. Sandler has some funny moments as well, but his role is less comedy and more dramatic. The children in this film are also quite talented young actors, with special mention going to Shelbie Bruce (Christina) & Sarah Steele (Bernice) for their heartfelt performances. Cloris Leachman is quite funny as the mother Evelyn Norwich. While Vega is enjoyable and quite convincing as Flor Moreno, this is really Tea Leoni's film. She pretty much steals the show as neurotic, newly minted housewife Deborah Clasky. It's becomes quite clear while watching, that she really threw herself into the role.<br /><br />Check it out if you get a chance! Probably a better rental than an addition to your DVD collection, however, as with all reviews....that is just a matter of my personal opinion. ;-)</p></br><a href="../users/A2PXHFGJZBNLXB.html">A2PXHFGJZBNLXB</a><br/><p>James L. Brooks' SPANGLISH is a movie about the clash of cultures and lifestyles. In the middle of the movie, Flor (Paz Vega), a Mexican immigrant who works as a maid for the affluent Clasky family in California, sees her young daughter, Cristina, enjoying the rich lifestyle, and starts to feel disturbed by it, fearing that perhaps her daughter is starting to forget all the old cultural traditions as she is seduced by wealth. There is one scene in this section of the film that, in its own way, sums up its subtle cultural conflict: an argument that develops between Flor and John Clasky (Adam Sandler, who gives another fine dramatic performance here), in which Flor accuses Mr. Clasky of flaunting wealth and being "smug," and Mr. Clasky fires back at her, calling her a "hypocrite." Why deny your daughter this life if she wants it?, he seems to be saying.<br /><br />It is this kind of thematic questioning and ambivalence that gives SPANGLISH its real interest and unassuming power; it's why I think the movie is worth seeing, even though it isn't perfect. The character of Deborah Clasky---a caricature of neurosis and well-meaning insensitivity---is a serious (and not all that funny) flaw to Brooks' conception, since, as hard as Tea Leoni tries to humanize the character, her over-the-top neurotic well-meaning villainy threatens to reduce the central cultural conflict between affluence and tradition to a one-sided affair (I mean, which Mexican maid would really want their kid to grow up to be a Deborah Clasky? When you see the film, you'll see what I mean). And the final scene, between Flor and a gravely-disappointed Cristina, is a little disturbing in its implication that mere cultural pride trumps even getting a good education if offered it.<br /><br />Still, I consider those flaws aberrations in what is essentially a searching film about whether becoming affluent does (or should) trump one's cultural roots. Because it provokes these kinds of interesting and thoughtful questions, SPANGLISH is a film worth seeing and reflecting. Recommended (with some reservations).</p></br><a href="../users/AFJFXN42RZ3G2.html">AFJFXN42RZ3G2</a><br/><p>James L. Brooks offers a mix of humor and seriousness with SPANGLISH.  Cultures clash between two different worlds, but not without the effort to bring an understanding of where each have come and where they want to be.  In this case, hollywood meets the third world.  This is a story of  single Latin American woman who ventures to the United States with her daughter to seek the opportunity to live a better life.  The daughter narrates the story as part of an essay she writes for college entry to a prestigious university.  She owes her determination and influence to her mother.  Life finally begins in the US when her mother happens to find a job working as a housekeeper with an upscale American family where she and her daughter quickly become part of the family.  In the process, she almost loses her daughter to the family.<br /><br />SPANGLISH contains an array of serious issues from alcoholism to infidelity over a laugh track of irony that each character encounter.  Adam Sandler, the chef-father, appears to take the serious guy persona as opposed to his previous comedic roles. Cloris Leachman basically steals the show as the mother-in-law who adds a little tongue and cheek one liners through out the film.  However, her daughter as played by Tea Leoni appears to be the downer of the film with her overbearing presence.<br /><br />One question comes to mind, why did Brooks choose upscale California for this semi-comedic film about a Latin American woman and her daughter making it in the United States?  Yes, stereotypes prevail, but not without the attempt to bridge the communication gap.  However, in the end each family return to their respective worlds where they can live comfortably, and possibly learn from each other's experience.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2ZN57YG2NMH.html">A1D2ZN57YG2NMH</a><br/><p>First of all, Spanglish not a manic, goofy, insane comedy like Adam Sandler usually pulls out.<br /><br />It is actually a Romantic Comedy.<br /><br />It is a chick flick in some ways, but actually enjoyable for most guys too, "unless you are on a Vin Diesel kick."<br /><br />A pretty good film with good morals and some fun moments.</p></br><a href="../users/A25HYPL2XKQPZB.html">A25HYPL2XKQPZB</a><br/><p>Spanglish is a good movie when it is about John Claskey and Flor, his Mexican imigrant housekeeper, played by Adam Sandler and Paz Vega.  John and Flor both have young teenage daughters and they are interesting as well.  John has a son who is on screen some but mostly goes unnoticed.  John also has a mother-in-law with a drinking problem who has a few good moments.<br /><br />But unfortunately, director James Brooks has created one of the most evil, unsympathetic characters ever in John's wife, Deborah, played well by Tea Leoni.  I don't fault Leoni because she is utterly convincing as the despicable, selfish, clueless, adulterous Deborah.  She is mean to her daughter, her husband and to especially Flor, the housekeeper she hired.  Deborah doesn't have one redeeming quality which the viewer can latch on to.  There is no reason to care about her.  Even at the end of the movie when she does perhaps see the error of her ways, it doesn't change the fact that she is a horrible person and it doesn't make up for all the evil she did to her family.<br /><br />The reason to watch this movie is Adam Sandler and Paz Vega.  Their chemistry together is fresh and exciting and one leaves the theater knowing these two were made for each other.  I read one review about Spanglish that said the movie isn't very good, but it does have interesting characters.  It could have been a good movie if Brooks hadn't made Tea Leoni's character so utterly unsympathetic and repulsive.  Still, Sander shows he can act without being his traditional silly self and Vega is a newcomer to America who is absolutely beautiful to watch.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>When movie trailers come out months before the release of a film and movie billboards crowd the malls and other places trying to convince the public of what to expect (read 'how can we guarantee making the most money from the biggest crowd?'), it is difficult to get motivated to step over the hype and decide for yourself the merits and message of a little movie.<br /><br />SPANGLISH used slapstick approach, beginning with focus on Adam Sandler of the superfluff/toilet mouth 'comedy' genre, to publicize this little story into a COMEDY.  That was enough to keep this viewer out of the theater.  But seeing James L. Brooks current opus at home without all the hoopla of the theater crowd resulted in a pleasant discovery: this is a well-written little drama, peppered with some comedy, that addresses a lot of issues about parenting, cross-ethnicity, living your dream vs skimming off the top, having loyalty to the inner self, the desperate need for communication in today's loud world, alcoholism, etc.  Not the stuff for slapstick, nor is it treated that way.<br /><br />John Clasky (Adam Sandler in a straight role that allows him to show substance over pratt falls) is a successful chef who is able to support his family with a home in Beverly Hills and a summer home at the beach (obviously Malibu).  His wife Deborah (Tea Leoni in a wildly dysfunctional mother role which she handles well), in desperation for breathing room to pursue her lackluster life, hires a non-English speaking Latina maid Flor (Paz Vega) who has immigrated to the US with her young daughter Cristina (Shelbie Bruce, a amazingly bilingual young actress) to make a life for herself after her husband has left her.  Deborah's daughter Bernice (Sarah Steele) is overweight and the victim of her mother's misconstrued attempts to correct her problem at the expense of acknowledging Bernice's self worth.<br /><br />Though busy with his successful restaurant, John finds time to be a loving father, a husband who is as supportive of his wild wife as is possible, and who gradually finds in the new Flor a gentle, honest, compassionate/passionate human being that seems to be a soul mate.  Things progress quickly: Flor learns English via language tapes on TV, Cristina moves in with the family when the move to Malibu occurs, Deborah dotes on the bright, attractive Cristina while ignoring her own daughter, Flor tends to the emotions of Bernice, and finally a marital crisis occurs which places into focus the idiosyncrasies of all members of the extended household (including Deborah's alcoholic mother - Cloris Leachman, as brilliant as ever).<br /><br />The manner in which Brooks brings this chaos to closure does not sell out the way most stories do: there are no pat answers here but altered individual perceptions are suggested and we are given the opportunity to resolve them as we wish.  Is this a comedy? No, though there are many cleverly funny lines and situations. This is a pertinent drama, unfortunately mislabeled in name and in media approach.  For this reviewer this is a tender film about family needs and personal goals.  The cast is excellent, each member taking risks that prove to be successful.  Give it a try!  Grady Harp, April 05</p></br><a href="../users/A1IANEBSMVGHS9.html">A1IANEBSMVGHS9</a><br/><p>I don't particularly love Adam Sandler's comedies. Fortunately, "Spanglish" is not one of them! It's more of a James L. Brooks movie. Once again, he writes, directs and produces, as he did with the classic "Terms of Endearment" back in 1983, and more recently, with "As Good as It Gets".<br /><br />Sandler plays John Clasky, a renowned chef who is in the prime of his professional career. He's the classic "good guy", who loves his family and keeps a great balance between the time he devotes to work and the time with his kids. Plus he loves his insecure wife Deborah, played by Tea Leoni (Deep Impact, The Family Man), one wacky lady who has put her career on hold to raise her family.<br /><br />Complementing the cast is Paz Vega, who broke into international stardom playing Lucia in "Sex and Lucia". She plays Flor (with rolled "R" at the end), a protective Mexican mom who wants to stay as close as possible to her native Mexican values, even while living in the heart of L.A., cleaning and cooking for the Clasky family.<br /><br />While the plot does lead into some predictable events (don't mean to spoil the story for you), this is not your "typical" Adam Sandler movie. As a matter of fact, some of the most hilarious moments are not courtesy of the legend from "The Wedding Singer" and Saturday Night Live, but rather the result of the head-on encounter of two cultures, where no side can speak the other's language or easily understand each other's motivations.<br /><br />With a balance between humor and drama that is preserved throughout most of the plot, the movie stands a good chance of being almost as popular as "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" was a back in 2002.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EEUQ81DTY7G3.html">A2EEUQ81DTY7G3</a><br/><p>Spanglish has some intensely quirky performances, and while at times it's a little over-romanticized, the film does raise a lot of hot-button issues about the Los Angeles cultural divide, where the barrio-driven east meets the glitz and upper middle class glamour of the Westside.<br /><br />A lack of communication seems to be de rigor in this world, where drunken matriarchs are ignored, where husbands and wives don't talk, and where the Latina hired help struggle to overcome the language barrier and be understood. Spanglish portrays an American family on the verge of crisis; they move through their days in a state of perpetual but agreeable sadness, with each loving the other, but so self absorbed and dysfunctional that they're miles apart emotionally.<br /><br />John and Deborah Clasky (a wonderful Adam Sandler and Tea Leoni) are married and living in a gorgeous home in Beverly Hills. John owns a five star restaurant, but he's recently been able to cut back his hours to spend more time with his family - he's a nice, affable, and genial fellow who deeply loves his slightly overweight daughter Bernice (Sarah Steele).<br /><br />John is the emotional opposite to the highly-strung Deborah, who spends her days shopping, streaking her hair, and fanatically jogging to keep her svelte figure intact. Deborah is spoilt and self-absorbed; she treats sex as an aggressive sport and her comfortable life is a daily challenge.<br /><br />When young Mexican single mother Flor (Paz Vega) takes her daughter, Cristina (Shelbie Bruce) to Los Angeles in search of better opportunities, she gets a job as housekeeper at the Clasky family home. The family immediately welcome her into their midst, with Deborah quick to gush "your gorgeous!" while her wine swilling Mum, a former jazz singer (a riotous Cloris Leachman) observes in knowing silence.<br /><br />Flor is shocked at the level of family competitiveness: at first she's content just to observe the family's antics, but soon she begins to get involved. John, estranged from Deborah, gradually becomes attracted to Flor; he respects and admires her niceness and sense of motherly duty. And Flor, only ever experiencing Latin macho men, has never come across a sensitive new age guy like John, who has all his priorities sorted and bares his emotions easily.<br /><br />When Deborah brings Flor and Christina to stay at their summer beach house, Flor soon becomes resentful when Deborah begins to take Cristina under her wing and introduces her to the affluent, moneyed life. Deborah's endlessly errant behaviour begins to causes friction, and the household begins to spiral out of control.<br /><br />Vega gives a linguistically masterful performance as Flor; she's a wide-eyed neophyte, a bravely dedicated mother, and a love-stung girl. Sandler is also perfect as the soft-spoken John, who is just as fearful of his overwhelming success as a chef, as he is of Deborah's uncontrolled, frenetic outbursts.<br /><br />The film, however, belongs to Tea Leoni, she's a gifted physical comedienne, who plays a woman who just can't seem to handle the demands of modern life; she's constantly frazzled, continually overwrought, and often wound tighter than a knot.  It's a pitch perfect, vivid, and fully realized portrait of well-heeled, upper middleclass mayhem and dysfunction.<br /><br />The central players are like real people touched with a faultless dose of comic exaggeration and the viewer cannot help but empathize with them all. Spanglish says much about the art of belonging, whether it's within a loving family or the often-painful, moneyed American class structure. With cultures colliding, and the social stratum transforming, actually knowing where you belong, and who you are, is in the end, probably far more valuable and beneficial to the soul than assimilation and integration could ever be.

The film can't decide whether the Klasky family is its focus or if the focus is their maid Flor, played by the beautiful Paz Vega.<br /><br />Adam Sandler and Tea Leoni play a successful couple with a bad marriage.<br /><br />Sandler plays his character as a charming but befuddled doormat who only occasionally asserts himself, though he never does that with his wife.<br /><br />Deb Klasky, Leoni's character, is a particularly unpleasant character. She's horribly insensitive, totally neurotic and makes some awful, awful choices. And then, for some reason, the film offers her character no ending whatsoever.<br /><br />I was waiting for there to be some resolution. I wanted to know what happened to the Klasky marriage. I wanted to know where the movie went from its central confrontation.<br /><br />But nothing happened.<br /><br />I don't know why the movie can't be about both Flor AND the Klaskys - giving all the plots a proper resolution, but director James L. Brooks apparently thinks, at different points in the film, that it's about one set of characters or the other.<br /><br />So we're left with some characters that get no definition at all (the Klaskys have a son who gets almost no screen time), some plotlines that are just left dangling (when does the young girl stand up to her mother?) and some confrontations that the movie seems to build toward that just never happen (Deb and Flor should have one more conversation).<br /><br />Also, the movie is told by a narrator who CAN'T know all the things the movie is telling us.<br /><br />On my way out of the theater after SPANGLISH, I heard one woman tell another that they liked it and liked, most of all, that it didn't have a traditional "Hollywood ending."<br /><br />I found it uneven, and I found its ending a cheat.</p></br><a href="../users/A21B2TJBWCSK1R.html">A21B2TJBWCSK1R</a><br/><p>James L. Brooks' latest movie, Spanglish, seemed to fly right under the critical and commercial radar despite the presence of Adam Sandler. Perhaps it was the misleading trailers that pegged the movie as some kind of goofy Sandler comedy. This couldn't be farther from the truth as the story is told by a young Mexican girl named Christina about her mother, Flor and their misadventures in America.<br /><br />Those expecting Spanglish to be a typical Sandler movie will be disappointed. Brooks prolongs his first on-screen appearance for as long as possible and when it does happen it is in a subtle, understated way with no fanfare. For the first half of the movie, Sandler plays a supporting role, allowing the other actors room to do their thing and then, in the last half, he comes to the foreground as the drama between him and Leoni's character comes to a boil. As brilliant as he was in Punch-Drunk Love, Sandler is even better in Spanglish, dropping most of his usual schtick by playing a nice, normal guy who loves his family. He hits all the right comedic beats but in a quiet, restrained way and ably handles the serious moments too.<br /><br />Ultimately, Brooks' films are about tolerance and optimism in a time when our society is so cynical and jaded. His movies happen in spite of the world outside. Very few mainstream American films deal with class differences and Spanglish tackles it head on as Flor and her daughter's Mexican heritage clash with the Clasky's upscale world.<br /><br />There is an audio commentary by writer/director James L. Brooks and the film's editors, Richard Marks and Tia Nolan. He speaks eloquently about Spanglish with the editors chiming in occasionally.<br /><br />There are 12 additional scenes, totaling 30 minutes, with optional commentary by Brooks and his editors. We see some of the footage of Flor and Christina in Mexico and a funny scene that gives Georgie more screen-time and pays off an earlier gag where Evelyn was teaching him jazz songs. With most cut footage it is readily apparent why they were cut but most of this footage is excellent and could have been kept in if it hadn't extended an already fairly long movie.<br /><br />"HBO First Look: The Making of Spanglish" is a standard press kit featurette with soundbites from Brooks and the cast mixed with clips from the movie.<br /><br />"Casting Sessions" features footage of some of the supporting cast auditioning for the movie with optional commentary by Brooks. It becomes immediately obvious that these actors were perfect for their roles and that Brooks is a genius at casting his movies.<br /><br />"How to Make the World's Greatest Sandwich featuring Thomas Keller" features footage of the chef (and film's technical advisor) showing Adam Sandler how to make the killer looking (and apparently tasting) modified BLT that his character makes in the movie. Brooks narrates this extra which, in a nice touch, includes written ingredients and instructions so that you can make it on your own!</p></br><a href="../users/A1LVZOK9F7K4CN.html">A1LVZOK9F7K4CN</a><br/><p>I was surprised to discover that I really dislike this film.  I like James L. Brooks and most of the people involved - including Adam Sandler.  The picture starts out good enough - lots of snappy dialogue - but then it takes a wrong turn from which it never recovers: it becomes a tedious, plodding, melodrama.  The film seems to go on forever.<br /><br />One of the things that killed the picture for me is that I just didn't like the Paz Vega character.  This is disastrous as the movie expects the audience to fall in love with her.  I thought she was annoying.  I also had a lot of trouble with the ending, which is supposed to be bittersweet and uplifting, but I found it totally false and it left a bad taste in my mouth.  Ultimately, the best thing about this movie was the shots of cooking.</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>This is a journey to hope, in search of  a better future and new dreams. These two women will gather a very original family: he is a successful chef, his wife is an unpredictable, hyper kinetic and selfish woman. She has reached a social status, but nothing is enough for her. Her mother Cloris Lechman (who stole the show) is simply an assertive woman, who was in her golden years a jazz singer, she is somehow the embodiment of the maturity in the house and that's why she controls the natural order. She is suspicious, clever and very funny, trying to keep the fragile equilibrium in that home.<br /><br />The frontier is far beyond from being a simple set of dots and lines. The idiom's barrier works out as a very original device to arouse laughs, but also make us think about the far from envy situation.<br /><br />Sympathy's Paz Vega is overwhelming her fresh image and spontaneity makes so credible her role that allowed us to engage and make a sincere rapport with her and her circumstance.<br /><br />This very original script enriches itself due the bonhomie of this lovely child who will establish the natural link between all the members of the family and her mother, who lives according nonnegotiable rules; her honesty is bulletproof, so well her affections and wishes.<br /><br />I liked the smart final, there are not easy concessions, it proposes you a deep revision about your way of living, the value of those little details that establish the difference and allows to dictate the red alarm to save a boring marriage.<br /><br />This a very touching movie, plenty of  human warmth, a funny portrait that faces two clear different lifestyles without restrictions or preconceived stereotypes.<br /><br />Absolutely marvelous, one film that rejoins us with the savoir vivre.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MG8DHACXH5MS.html">A2MG8DHACXH5MS</a><br/><p>This is one of the best films of 2004. To sum it up ... it's all about choices and how when children are involved you can't do what you want without harming their lives for better and worse.<br /><br />When Flor and her daughter enter the lives of the Claskys they are immersed in three generations of mother-daughter conflicts with their dad in the middle of it. Flor takes a liking to the family with the exception of Deborah (Mrs. Clasky). Things get even more complicated when Flor and Christina must move in with the family for the summer. In the end, this is one love triangle without a happy ending for anyone involved.</p></br><a href="../users/A2XGJ56VCFOKKZ.html">A2XGJ56VCFOKKZ</a><br/><p>I avoided seeing this film in theaters because it just didn't seem very interesting. Even after it has been on dvd for awhile, I hesitated renting it and the biggest reason is because it was victimized by false marketing. My guess is that the studios didn't know how to market it, and because it stars Adam Sandler, they decided to market it as a comedy, which is a huge mistake. I consider this film to be a drama with comedic elements...but if you're looking for the goofy style comedy of past Adam Sandler films, you're in for a huge disappointment.<br /><br />It's a shame, really, because this film doesn't fit any neat category. It must be viewed with an open mind (and an open heart wouldn't hurt either). There are some unbelievable stretches that don't work...such as the marriage between Adam Sandler and Tea Leoni. Throughout the whole film, I wondered why they were even a couple. They had little in common and clashed about everything, particularly the role of parental responsibility. If I hadn't seen "The Family Man" where I actually loved Tea Leoni's performance in that film, I would not have been impressed with her here. She plays a very annoying, obsessive and eccentric mother/housewife, who acts without thinking. She's impulsive, intense, and downright irritating. Self-absorbed/self-obsessed to pay any attention to her daughter or husband. I simply couldn't figure her out and her eccentric behavior only made me empathize with Adam Sandler even more.<br /><br />Adam Sandler does seem out of place in a film like this. As often is the case, he plays the likeable hero whom audiences love. This film is a bit of a stretch, as he plays a father, husband, and award-winning chef. The last part really strained credibility with me. Together, as a couple, Sandler and Leoni are affluent Los Angeles suburbanites who can afford a fulltime housekeeper, played wonderfully by Paz Vega. This film belongs to Paz Vega, as the POV is from her daughter and the focus sits square on her shoulders. She is an amazing find and the reason why I rate this film so high. She has an uncanny resemblance to actress Penelope Cruz and if any Hollywood moguls are reading this review, those two should play sisters in some film one day!!!<br /><br />The clash of cultures begin when the housekeeper Flor (Paz Vega) begins to work, as she doesn't speak English and the family doesn't speak Spanish. They get by with all manner of comedic misunderstandings, until Flor decides to learn English. What surprises me with this film is that it moves in a certain direction that makes you think where it will end up, yet turns in a surprising way that is actually profound. Ultimately, this film is about boundaries. The American family are too inconsiderate of their housekeeper as they try to "Americanize" her daughter in a way the mother doesn't approve, so she has to decide how best to maintain the sense of boundary and self-respect. The other surprise of this film is Cloris Leachmann, who is a wonderful actress in her own right and she gives the best advice any mother could give a daughter (she plays the alcoholic mother of Tea Leoni's character). I would have loved to see a larger role for her in this film, but she is a joy to watch in every scene she's in.<br /><br />The reason why I give it a perfect score of 5 stars is because of actresses Paz Vega, Cloris Leachman, and the two girls who play the daughters; along with the surprising turns this film makes; and the overall message one receives at the end of the movie. Quite profound on the clash of cultures, the nature of families, and how best to handle temptations. It is a remarkable film that should have been better advertised to find the right audience. People expecting a typical Adam Sandler comedy will naturally be disappointed, but people expecting a drama with some humor will most likely surprised, in a good way.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RDR5G65D9H84.html">A2RDR5G65D9H84</a><br/><p>Cristina has to write an essay about the person he admires most as part of her application for Princeton. A lot of people when faced with this question when applying for a college make similar choices, but for Cristina the winning candidate is crystal clear: her mother. Flor Moreno (Paz Vega) was abandoned by her husband and decided to leave Mexico and go to Los Angeles with her little girl to start a new life. At first she stayed within the Mexican community, working two jobs and barely making ends meet. But when her growing daughter required more of her attention and supervision she had to jump into the Anglo world, where she could earn more than double in only one job.<br /><br />One of the most interesting aspects of the movie is the clash of cultures we witness when Flor starts interacting with the Clasky family as their hired help, and with the lady of the house in particular. Deborah (Tea Leoni) is an extroverted and overachieving woman that pushes everyone else in her family to her limits. Her husband John (Adam Sandler) is the complete opposite; he is calm and collected, loves his kids and accepts them the way they are, and even though he is an excellent chef, he is not looking for great success. His goal is "three and a quarter stars".<br /><br />John quickly starts to see that the things that are important for Flor are similar to what he considers relevant in life and that this does not happens when he compare his goals with his wife's. And this is the other attractive aspect of the movie, John's realization of other alternatives and how he navigates through them. Especially after things start to get mixed up when Flor does not want to be just an observer in the life of the Clasky's, but decides to get involved too.<br /><br />Besides the great script, this film has a memorable cast that fit their roles amazingly well. Leoni is so successful in playing the stereotypical striving type A woman that she gets on the viewer's nerves at times (at least she did in mine). Sandler has evolved as an actor, from someone that could make us laugh, to a more complete actor who can arise other emotions from us as well. Sarah Steele is adorable in the role of Bernice, the Clasky's daughter, a girl who is as lovely as one can be, but is continually chastised by her mother because she is overweight. Then we get to Paz Vega, a new face that does not disappoint; probably some people will compare her to Penelope Cruz, and they may be right. In my particular case, I liked her freshness and irreverence even more.<br /><br />Do not be misguided, this is not your typical romantic comedy, with a thought provoking plot and a well-chosen cast, this is a very good movie that shines when compare to any other genre. I recommend it wholeheartedly.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KEZLJ59C1JVH.html">A3KEZLJ59C1JVH</a><br/><p>This film was poorly advertised when it hit the theatres last year, which is probably why I didn't see it when it came out. All of the promotions made it look like just another Adam Sandler comedy, which is fine and dandy, but I usually don't shell out the money to see Adam Sandler's movies in the theatre. However, "Spanglish" is so completely different from anything Sandler has ever done before. It's a comedy and a drama that will make you laugh and cry, and I absolutely loved it.<br /><br />Sandler actually has more of a supporting role in "Spanglish." The story revolves around a woman and her daughter who emigrate to the United States from Mexico. Flor (Paz Vega)  speaks no English but is determined to build a good life for her daughter Christina (Shelbie Bruce). She accepts a housekeeping job at the home of a dysfunctional couple (Sandler and Tea Leoni, who gives an excellent performance as Sandler's crazy, selfish wife). Flor must contend with her new employer's hostility toward her own family and her unwanted influence on Christina. "Spanglish" is a heartwarming movie about love, family, and responsibility. It was a thousand times better than I expected it to be, and I suggest that everyone watch it! (The only thing I didn't like about the film is that the movie is so open-ended. What happens with John and Deb?! Inquiring minds want to know!)</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>Brain circuits, reconnecting. Reality, resurfacing. Noises in head, stopping. Aaaaahhhhhhh!. Back to normal. Hopefully, the nightmares will stop.<br /><br />Deborah Clasky (Tea Leoni, Mrs. David Duchovny. Let's face it, she isn't known for her work in movies.), is the...<br /><br />Uh, oh. Didn't get far. Brain circuits breaking free, disconnecting from the matter, won't let me remember Tea Leoni's God awful performance in "Spanglish", the newest film from writer - director James L. Brooks ("Broadcast News", "Terms of Endearment"). Move on to another topic before brain shuts down and the drool starts.<br /><br />Remember when James L. Brooks used to make really good films for adults? I know, its getting a little difficult, but make good films he did. "Terms of Endearment" and "Broadcast News" earned a bucket load of award nominations and awards for the various stars involved. Why? Because they were good films, with somewhat believable characters who did funny things or lived through very dramatic events. In the last decade, he has made three films. One of these was "As Good As It Gets" and sort of made people forget the debacle of "I'll Do Anything", his "musical without music" starring Nick Nolte. Then he made "Spanglish".<br /><br />...matriarch of an affluent family living in Brentwood. Recently downsized, she finds she has a lot of time on her hands and naturally decides to hire a housekeeper.<br /><br />Why won't the voices stop? What? Leoni's shrill voice is still rattling around in my head? What? Stop it, Tea. Leave my brain immediately. I need to finish the review in order to purge the demons...<br /><br />From the moment we meet Deborah, we realize that something is wrong with this woman; she talks a mile a minute, she never shuts up for anyone, she appears to be taking some sort of medication, perhaps Speed, but no mention is ever made of this. So what is the excuse for her to act like this? Even if she were taking medication, it would take a lot of explanation to make her behavior acceptable. Her daughter, Bernie (Sarah Steele), a slightly pudgy young girl with braces, makes a sandwich which everyone loves. Deborah takes a bite and practically swoons and then says "But you really don't need that", referring to her daughter's slightly pudgy state. Later, having returned from a warehouse sale, Deborah presents her daughter with bags full of new clothes. Excitedly, Bernie starts to try them on and realizes they are too small, all a size 8. "Don't worry, honey. You'll fit into them real soon." Groan. The woman is a monster and shouldn't be allowed to raise these kids. Their son only appears in two or three scenes. Apparently, there was no dramatic material there.<br /><br />John Clasky (Adam Sandler) wakes up the next morning to find Flor (Paz Vega) cleaning the house. He didn't realize that Deborah -- the voices are ringing again -- had hired someone. John owns a small restaurant (modeled after the French Laundry, Thomas Keller's restaurant) which is receiving a lot of good praise. John learns that Flor speaks no English, but she does understand quite a bit. Flor is amazed to see how Deborah treats Bernie and takes all of the clothes, letting out hems and fixing them, to make them fit. This makes Flor Bernie's new best friend. Evelyn (Cloris Leachman), Deborah's mom, a former Jazz singer who lives with the family is intent on drinking as much wine during any given day as possible and providing sage advice to her daughter as she see fit. As the summer approaches, Deborah decides to rent a summer house in Malibu...<br /><br />Does not compute. Why would someone in Brentwood rent a summer home in Malibu? It doesn't make any sense. The weather is so much colder in Brentwood during the summer? If you are unfamiliar with the two, they are about ten to fifteen miles apart. Unfortunately, I am aware that people actually do this. Worse yet, as soon as they move, it becomes apparent that John will continue to commute to his restaurant. Business is booming because he just received four stars from the Times. The place is booked solid for four months. And Deborah, with her shrill, puffy face, crying all the time, screaming, or worse yet, talking a mile a minute, will continue to drive around, looking for something to occupy her time.<br /><br />Deborah insists Flor move into the summer house with them. Flor's daughter, Cristina (Shelbie Bruce), has to move in as well. Deborah immediately latches onto the young girl and treats her like a life size Barbie doll, making her the new `project'. She takes her to have her hair highlighted, to see a private school, etc., all without Flor's knowledge. Naturally, the first thing any of us would do is allow someone like Deborah to repeatedly influence our child, after watching the success she has had in her relationship with her own daughter, Bernie.<br /><br />Brain at critical stage. Meltdown imminent. Must purge it of all thoughts of  Leoni's performance. Must finish review. Quickly.<br /><br />It amazes me that anyone, anywhere thought Tea Leoni's performance was good, acceptable and film worthy; a combination of hysterics, crying, over-the-top acting and so much more. Maybe there are real people who act like this, but that doesn't mean that we have to pay to watch them for two hours. Always crying, talking hysterically, bossing people around, etc., etc. Considering how many people work on any given film it amazes me that someone, anyone didn't say "Ah...Mr. Brooks?". Brooks, Leoni, Sandler, the producers, the studio executives, David Duchovny, they all apparently thought that this performance was real and believable. It is easily one of the worst performances I have ever seen on film, or television, for that matter. In one scene, Deborah learns about the four star review of her husband's restaurant. This apparently excites her and she attacks him, pushing him into their bedroom, straddling him on the bed. John (Sandler) seems to enjoy the fact that she is taking control. "You don't even need me, do you?" he laughs. She rides him to her finish and then immediately begins crying and her face becomes puffy and sad. Oh my God. Every time she appeared on screen, I felt like poking my eardrums out, to save the torture.<br /><br />Brain levels lowering, don't really have to think about Leoni much anymore. Feeling better.<br /><br />The rest of "Spanglish" is acceptable. Billed as a "Comedy with a language all its own". It isn't very funny. Once of twice, I smiled, but I never laughed. Basically, everything they do is dramatic.<br /><br />It is also difficult to get past the contrived set-up for telling the story. An Admissions Officer at Princeton reads the admissions essay from Cristina, presumably 6 or 7 years later. In her essay, Cristina relates the events of her mother working for the Clasky family. How does Cristina know what the first meeting between her mother and Deborah was like? She wasn't there. How does she know how Deborah reacted to John's four star review? Clearly, she wasn't in their bedroom. It is difficult to imagine that someone would relate these stories, and others, to her. This is a sloppy, poorly executed method for telling the story.<br /><br />The production values in any Brooks' film will be of the highest standards. "Spanglish" doesn't disappoint there. Everything is crisp, clear, pretty. There is one exception. There are a couple of scenes with characters in cars, having a conversation as someone is driving. A couple of decades ago, these scenes would be shot in a studio, using a fake car, with the scenery projected behind the actors. In the last few decades, they have advanced this process, usually shooting in a real car, on the road. In "Spanglish", they have regressed. It is so obvious that a significant portion of these scenes were shot in a studio making me question why? Think of the Roger Moore James Bond films. Whenever he had to jump out of a plane, the close-ups would always have his hair moving in an unnatural way. This is because he was shot in front of a blue screen and the scenery was added later. They weren't able to make his hair flow freely. Apparently, they weren't able to make Leoni's hair flow freely either.<br /><br />Oh, oh. Mentioned Leoni. Brain levels back at medium, rising, rising. Must purge of all of her memories.<br /><br />After Flor's daughter moves in, Deborah begins to manipulate her and Flor, because she thinks Flor's daughter is beautiful. You see, she doesn't think her own daughter is beautiful. Now she has the daughter she always wanted. Flor's daughter is accepted at Bernie's school, Deborah gives her an expensive necklace on her first day, buys her books for her, insists that she invite her friends over to their house for a sleepover. Who thought this was an interesting, believable, watchable story? Someone was very misguided. I'm looking at you, Mr. Brooks.<br /><br />Every so often an actor or actress will give the performance of their career, overshadowing all others. The film becomes "Their Film". They earn all of the notice. Tea Leoni has done that in "Spanglish". It doesn't matter that Paz Vega gives a very good, believable performance as Flor, it doesn't matter that Adam Sandler does some good, if unspectacular work, it doesn't matter that Cloris Leachman is even in the film. The film is all about Leoni. And not in a good way. Her performance is so bad, she creates a black hole sucking all of the other actors in.<br /><br />Hopefully, they will get out in time and move on to other projects. Hopefully, Tea will take some acting classes and learn the art of subtlety. Hopefully, I will make a million dollars tomorrow. We can all dream.<br /><br />Aaaahhh, brain levels back to normal. Circuits rewiring. Can sleep again. Night night.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VQBHHXIKHIGS.html">A1VQBHHXIKHIGS</a><br/><p>This is [...].

It's an ugly place where nobody acts human, preferring to cling to stale stereotypes. A place where writers without talent set their stories. A place they grew up watching on American TV and in films, thus perpetuating the vicious cycle. This film is set in that world. No human being has ever been to this place, because it only exists in the minds of hacks.<br /><br />From the writer and director who brought us BROADCAST NEWS, which I reviewed recently. It, too, was in the pretend world, but that was okay because it was a film about a TV show and it had a bit of wit and perception.

Back to the movie: Ok, the characters were not likeable, the pacing was dull, and even Adam couldn't salvage this mess.

That is except for Leoni as Deborah whose performance is so whacked out and out of control; we can only blame Brooks for the miscalculation. In previous films ("Flirting With Disaster," "Hollywood Ending") Leoni has been witty, smart even Katherine Hepburn-ish. But here the material she has to work with and Brooks direction have her saying and doing things to her family that are just plain thoughtless on the plus side and ugly on the negative. Brooks: this is not "Ordinary People," this is a Comedy!!!<br /><br />On the positive side, Paz Vega as Flor fills the screen with warmth and sensuality and a hell of a lot of horse sense: something truly lacking in the Clasky household. She is a real find and she brings a needed stability to the proceedings. Sandler plays his regular guy, put-upon schlump here and as usual he does a good job.<br /><br />"Spanglish" is a minor blip in the career that is James Brook's but the one thing of which it will always be remembered is the introduction of the luminous and incandescent Paz Vega to the American screen.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VCLTAGM5RLND.html">A1VCLTAGM5RLND</a><br/><p>In this movie I like seeing a little different side of Adam Sandler he is more serious and had emotions.

If you pay attention to this movie, I think you will learn something about yourself, about cultural differences, about responsibility...all while having a few good laughs and a good time. (I know I sound like corney Dr. Phil). Go see this movie, I think Paz Vega is a stand out in her first big Hollywood appearance. her character could have lighten up she said no to just about anything, she won't let her daughter have $50, won't let her go to private school, she quite her job and moved out of the lovely house, she rejected Adam "which was stupid". Mrs. Leoni overacts and become quit bothersome. She's probable a CRACK-HEAD or RETARTED! The little latin daughter does a fine job at acting and she's very sexy "Salma Hayek" better watch out!</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>I'm not going to lay out the fact that James L. Brooks is one of the best film directors to ever walk the planet, because so many others have already pointed that out and really, most complaints directed at `Spanglish' are based on the fact that it just doesn't live up to the reputation that surrounds Brooks.<br /><br />I came at this from a different approach.<br /><br />Instead of looking at the director, I came at this looking at the star; Adam Sandler.  Now, Adam and I have a rocky relationship.  His early comedic work, in my opinion, was fresh and exciting (`Happy Gilmore' is still a uproarious ride).  His recent work is repetitive and crude.  He has slivers of greatness achieved, most notably when working with strong co-stars (as was the case in '50 First Dates') but he has recently become the worst part of any film he is in (see the dreadfully conceived `I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry').  So, watching `Spanglish' seemed like walking into a trap.<br /><br />I mean this is Sandler meets Brooks; not a combination for the most fluid offering.<br /><br />And that is the most disturbing part of `Spanglish', it just doesn't flow.  What starts off like a chaotic comedy that just needs a touch of focus turns, almost too suddenly, into a heartbreaking drama.  I mean, it feels like two very different films.  There needed to be some balance.<br /><br />Ok, so while I'm laying out faults I'll just spill it all right here.  The initial premise is kind of cheesy in a total `that would never happen, would it' kind of way.  Having the whole story told in a college essay submission seems, at a glance, to be inspired, but it isn't, and the way the essay is closed is rather stupid (and watching a group of adults smiling ridiculously over the essay itself got the film started off on a weird note).  The character development, especially within the relationships, is choppy at best.  John, the perfect husband, is too perfect.  It just doesn't make sense.  Deborah is a total mess, but for me she was the most understandable of the characters.  Sure, she was insane and kind of (or more than kind of) irritating but she was emotionally unstable and remarkably human (especially when the film takes that sudden turn and her performance is required to sell us on everything the script cannot).  For me, I just didn't get Flor.  I mean, I got what she was trying to do with her daughter and I respect the intention, but she came off a tad underdeveloped, and her character is the crux of the entire film.  The relationship that buds between her and John is predictable and annoying.<br /><br />Oh, and Cloris Leachman is hilarious, even if her character is BEYOND clich&eacute;d and feels like an afterthought.<br /><br />But, the film has surprising heart.  I loved the character of Bernice.  I mean, she had such depth even if her character was underwritten (Sarah Steele was the star of this show for me).  Tea Leoni was all sorts of manic brilliance here, and the way she sells that sudden scene of destitution was FLAWLESS (in fact, despite being totally out of no where and kind of unbalanced, that scene is the best part of the film and shows so clearly how this film COULD have been had the script been more focused).<br /><br />It tries, and it succeeds in parts, but the overall feel of `Spanglish' is that it just doesn't know what it wants to do.  It tries to hard to sell the `funny' in the beginning and then it tries too hard to sell the `drama' in the end.  It comes off choppy with moments of brilliance masked by layers of missed opportunities.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>In "The Family Man" T&eacute;a Leoni played the wife of Nicholas Cage and was as comfortable playing the character of Kate as the character was comfortable in her life.  I kept thinking how lucky Cage's character was to be married to her and hoped for David Ducovny's sake that Leoni was not really acting.  I bring up that 2000 film as a reference point because Leoni plays the wife of Adam Sandler in the 2004 film "Spanglish" and she is not just at the other end of the spousal spectrum she has gone around the bend.  Her Deborah Clasky is an awful person (if I did not know this the fact my wife said as much a half-dozen times during the movie would have been a clue).  She is an awful wife to her husband, an awful mother to her daughter, and an awful employer to her hired help.  What makes her so awful is that she is not abusive, so it is not a question of calling the cops and having her carted away to the betterment of her family.  She is not a malicious person and it is because her husband obviously loves her and that her daughter so desperately needs her that we want her to stop being an awful person.  The big question is whether there is anything there inside of her to build a decent human being.<br /><br />This might make "Spanglish" seems like a horror show, but it really is a romantic comedy.  The story is narrated by Christina (Aimee Garcia) a young girl who has written her college application to Princeton explaining why her mother is the most influential person in her life ("no contest").  We learn how Flor Moreno (Paz Vega) took young Christina from Mexico to Los Angeles and managed to work two jobs without ever having to learn English.  But as Christina (Shelbie Bruce) becomes a teenager, Flor has to find one job that will pay as much as too so she can see that her daughter is raised right.  That is how Flor ends up in the Clasky household.  John (Sandler) is a great chef whose restaurant is on the cusp of making it big while Deborah has been downsized out of a job into being a stay home mom where she has been reading way too many books on parenting.  She thinks her daughter Bernie (Sarah Steele) should be a size 8 and the stars in her eyes are blinding her to the tears in her daughter's eyes.  To add insult to injury, Deb is captivated by Christina, who seems the perfect daughter she deserves.  Without any other thoughts in her pretty head, Deborah starts doing things she should not be doing.<br /><br />The Claskys have a son, Georgie (Ian Hyland), but his only real problem is that when he has nightmares his maternal grandmother Evelyn (Cloris Leachman) teaches him another song she sang when she was a big jazz singer.  Otherwise grandma links to drink a lot of wine.  Meanwhile Deborah's self-absorption is going beyond being neurotic or merely having the type of mid-life crisis that sudden unemployment can provoke into a black hole that is threatening to suck in the rest of the characters.  The saving Grace is Flor, who might not understand the language but understands the emotional turmoil of the household she has entered.  However, just as she begins to but this fractured family back together Deborah insists on finding a new way of tearing it apart and making Flor and Christina part of the madness as well.  Compared to his crazy wife John is obviously going to find Flor attractive, and she is aware of the qualities he has that his wife is not so much ignoring as trying to beat out of him.<br /><br />Leoni is such a force of nature gone awry in this film that you have to stop and take notice that the others are turning in fine performances as well.  Sandler has not weaned himself of all of his comic elements but like "Fifty First Dates" this film proves that he can play a really nice guy, albeit with moments of manic insanity (several of his best moments are in the deleted scenes).  Paz Vega is a Spanish actress who signed up for the project without knowing English, which is perfect for the role, as is the fact that she manages to be both sexy and sweet, often at the same time (which is a neat trick).  She is the central character in "Spanglish," but since she is the eye of the hurricance while the Clasky marriage is imploding you can sometimes forget that fact.  Both of the young actresses hold their own with the grownups, with Bruce having a great scene where she mediates rather than just translate for her mother and John having a fight and Steele nailing the pain of a teenage daughter who is closer to her dad than she is to her mom at a time when she needs her mom the most.  Leachman actually refrains from stealing every scene she is in, but she does pick her moments and she becomes the key to her daughter's salvation, which is not a move I saw coming.</p></br><a href="../users/AW99SBGWEXP0J.html">AW99SBGWEXP0J</a><br/><p>"Spanglish" is told through the eyes of Christine (Bruce), a Mexican girl who comes to America with her mother Flor (Vega).  Flor resists Americanization as much as she can, but when taking a job as a housekeeper for the Claskys, she realizes that that is easier said than done.  The Claskys are a well to do family headed by renowned chef John (Sandler).  He is the "good" parent and a all around nice guy.  His wife, Deborah (Leoni) is out of work not a very pleasant person.  Her relationships with her husband and daughter are strained.  Flor's insertion into the family mix causes changes in everyone, mostly for the better.  Soon, Flor and her daughter are moving into a summer home with the Claskys, and cultures begin to seriously clash.<br /><br />"Spanglish" does not really have a plot so much as it examines a period of the characters' lives.  Since it is told through Christine's eyes, there is not as much resolution as many may like.  Instead, the story is strong on character, developing the three primary characters fully.<br /><br />Adam Sandler gives another solid dramatic performance (his first was the offbeat "Punch Drunk Love").  He is the nice guy, and is easy to like.  You feel for the guy as he has his ups and downs, and genuinely want him to succees.  T&eacute;a Leoni brings believability to the bitchy wife.  Self centered and oblivious to other's feelings, Deborah is a character that you do not want to like.  Cloris Leachman brings some comic relief as Deborah's mother.  Finally Paz Vega does a solid job as the woman caught between cultures, struggling to do what is right for herself and her daughter.<br /><br />Despite the good performances, "Spanglish" felt like a bit of a misfire to me.  I wanted more than I got out of it.  Perhaps it was the unlikeability of some characters or the lack of a real plot, I do not know.  In the days since I saw the movie, I have softened my review some, but I still can only recommend this on DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KB1H0S7T6JX1.html">A3KB1H0S7T6JX1</a><br/><p>Spanglish was quite a disappointment considering the make-up of the cast: Adam Sandler and Tea Leoni among others.  It is the story of a California family that hires a Mexican cleaning lady with no knowledge of English that uses her daughter as an interpreter.  The more time she spends with the family the more she finds out about the problems they are facing.  Consequently, she becomes fond of her employers and wishes to help them bridge their differences, until she falls in love with the man of the family and the woman of the family falls in love with her daughter....<br /><br />In short, the acting is pretty good (but nothing great, with the exception of Tea Leoni who does a wonderful job of portraying the psychotic wife), while the dialogues and the plot are just average.<br /><br />The characters are, overall, weak, bland and just plain uninteresting (e.g. the alcoholic mother in law and the two kids)<br /><br />Though the potential for a good movie was definitely there it fails to take off.  A shame really...<br /><br />Nevertheless, it should be noted that Paz Vega's potential to make it big in Hollywood is definitely there.<br /><br />In a nutshell, it's probably not a movie you would want to add to your collection, but it will provide for an evening's entertainment, and that's about it.<br /><br />No masterpiece here... 3 Stars</p></br><a href="../users/A2FWEZ0QS8N7A7.html">A2FWEZ0QS8N7A7</a><br/><p>The title of this review is advice that works on several levels.  In my case, I was enthusiastic about seeing Spanglish and my wife was not.  We went, bad decision.  In the case of the movie, Adam Sandler is America's greatest working chef -- hey, I didn't believe it either, but the New York Times review everyone reads hungrily in the movie says so -- and St. John to everyone (and especially Flor and his daughter Bernice, particularly well-played by Sarah Steele) but his wife with whom he never talks.  Now admittedly she is bipolar -- half the time a harping shrew and the other half some sort of New Age physical fitness addict who constantly screams "Left, left" to people she is passing as she jogs, as if they're going to commit some kamikaze leap into her path.  One hopes Tea Leoni has replaced the agent who steered her to this part, where among other things she is required to be made up to look like a 20 years younger version of Hillary Clinton.<br /><br />And why is this movie so interminably long, over two hours to reach its two banal lessons -- 1) be true to your roots and 2) you need to work continually at your relationship.  Which leads back to ... pay attention to your spouse/partner if s/he says not to see this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A18M68DE1Y6W51.html">A18M68DE1Y6W51</a><br/><p>I have read some fairly vicious reviews of this movie, and I don't understand why. It doesn't pretend to be more than it is; a rather gentle poke at the mores and values of a very liberal, trying-hard-to-be-humanitarian Southern California family.<br /><br />Other reviewers have described the plot: Spoiled brat wife Deborah (in a much-too-over-the-top hysterical performance by Tia Leoni) hires Latina housekeeper (the stunningly beautiful and intensely endearing Paz Vega), and tries to show her that she considers her equal to the family. There is much humor and some pathos, but the enjoyment is in the supporting actors. Vega is absolutely marvelous as the proud housekeeper who sees through her employers much more than they know; Sarah Steele, an endearingly awkward teenager, is fabulous as the daughter whose mother lets her know how fat she is. The acting falls down with Adam Sandler, the perfect husband and father who isn't believable for a single minute but who isn't obnoxious about it, and Leoni, who WAY overdoes the neurotic Deborah to the point of fingernails on the blackboard.<br /><br />So why did I like this movie? It is just basically a sweet story, no harm done, nothing horrible, and very enjoyable if you aren't looking for something deeply intellectual. I like it, and would recommend it despite its flaws.</p></br><a href="../users/A3F3B6HY9RJI04.html">A3F3B6HY9RJI04</a><br/><p>Here is the story of Cristina Moreno and her relationship with her mother, Flor.  The story (basically) begins when Cristina's father/Flor's husband takes off when she is a young child in Mexico.  Because of their poverty level, Flor and Cristina are forced to flee Mexico in hopes of finding a better life in Southern California.  In time, Flor takes up a job as a nanny or a housekeeper (the job wasn't very specific) for the Clasky family and is thrust upon the inner termoil that is present.<br /><br />The story is fun to follow and a real emotional roller-coaster.  However, I was blown away by the acting of six of the characters.  There has got to be some Oscar nominations in this movie somewhere for at least three of them.<br /><br />Flor is played by Paz Vega.  At the beginning of the movie she doesn't speak a word of English, even as she begins her job with the Clasky's.  Flor is very attractive and she has one of the best looks of shock, confusion, anger, and frustration at the events that unfold before her.  It is easy to fall in love with the character of Flor who lives for nobody except her daughter and understands the sacrifices it requires to raise a child.  If everybody raised children with the conviction that Flor had then there wouldn't be a messed up kid anywhere.<br /><br />John Clasky is played by Adam Sandler.  I am often a Sandler fan, except when he is shooting for laughs by being a complete drunken idiot.  If that is what you like and are expecting in this movie, don't go, you'll be sadly disappointed.  I'm glad he is shying away from that type of role these days, and he most definately doesn't play that role here.  John Clasky is the perfect father and if I had any complaint it was that he was too perfect.  Yes, some foibles were present, but I would have liked to have seen an uglier side of John Clasky to make this movie a bit more real.  However, Sandler still delivers a stand-up job that should be loudly applauded.<br /><br />Next is Shelbie Bruce, who plays Flor's daughter, Cristina.  As a child actor (I'm guessing 10 years old) she does an incredible job.  Cristina is a child who thinks she knows what is best for herself and is open to the manipulations of Deborah Clasky.  She is often at odds with her mother on doing what is right and is torn apart by the decisions that her mother makes.  There was a scene where Flor, who hasn't learned to speak English, confronts John Clasky and uses Cristina as a translater.  Shelbie Bruce does a wonderful job not only translating the words of her mother, but also her feeling.  It was one of my favorite scenes in the movie.  Shelbie Bruce even does a great job at the end of the movie when she finally confronts Flor because of the decisions Flor has made for her.<br /><br />And on to my three favorite characters.<br /><br />The first is Tea Leoni who plays Deborah Clasky.  I've always liked Tea Leoni as she usually shines in every movie she is in.  However, this is the first movie where she really lets herself go, in my opinion (granted, I haven't seen most of her movies).  There are scenes where she plays her stunningly beautiful self but then there are scenes where she goes the complete opposite direction.  She gets so bad in one scene that her mother (played by Cloris Leachman, she is next) comments that she needs a fire hose to clean herself up.  It is nice to see somebody like her allow herself to get so undone in a movie.  She can play emotion very well and she doesn't fail here as she plays every emotion I've ever felt in my life.<br /><br />The second is Cloris Leachman, who plays Deborah Clasky's mother.  Every scene with her in it just shines, and most of them just made me laugh out loud.  She most definately has the best and funniest lines of the movie.  However, Cloris' performance is dead on in every scene of the movie as, she too, must go through most of the emotional spectrum.<br /><br />And finally, the older Clasky child is Bernice, who is played by Sarah Steele.  Bernice is looking for some affection from her parents, especially  her mother.  You see some of the few moments of excitement in her eyes when she thinks she is being treated by her mother, and you totally identify with her during her disappointments.  Again, she also has a dead-on performance with every scene she is in and forces you to emphasize with the problems her character has.<br /><br />The story has a great message, which is that there is no greater sacrifice than those for your children and often through your children.  Some of the lines and the logic seemed a bit off, but the ending leaves you satisfied that you got your money's worth in a movie.  I especially love the highlighted differences between the American and Latino cultures.  I would recommend this movie for those who really enjoy a great performance on the screen.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R6RA8FRBS608.html">A2R6RA8FRBS608</a><br/><p>Spanglish from Director James Brooks is a good film that tries its best to tackle social issues facing immigrants, their families, and the "Anglo American" culture they meet when they move into the United States (or, in this case, out of Mexico into a Los Angeles barrio and then into "Anglo American" culture). It is well cast; the acting is wonderful. Adam Sandler proves he can listen and be the soft, sensitive man that women yearn for; Tea Lioni shines as the tyrannical American corporate wife forced into a motherhood she can't handle from downsizing. However, after all is said and done, the film comes up a bit short of my expectations. Until the last half hour, it seems to move just too slowly. The ending scene between Flor and Cristina just doesn't feel convincing; it has a certain feel to it that seems too rushed and this that leaves you unsatisfied and wanting a better way to end the picture.<br /><br />The film is actually a flashback of a young girl's childhood; we learn her story as someone reads a young immigrant girl's application to Princeton. The girl (Cristina) and her mother Flor (played beautifully by Paz Vega) come into the US, live in a barrio where her mother Flor doesn't have to learn any English and then suddenly are thrust into another culture when Flor needs and gets a higher paying job working as a maid for the Clasky family.<br /><br />Although John Clasky (played so well by Adam Sandler) is doing very, very well in his profession, he is not exactly proactive at home. His wife Deborah (played by Tea Lioni) runs the household--tyrant style! Deborah is not maternal and bossy to say the least. Her lack of faithfulness to John makes her even less likeable. While one major theme of this movie is the trouble caused when two people from two cultures try to get along, another theme is that Flor (now the Clasky maid) and John Clasky eventually become attracted to each other. What happens from there I will leave off for fear of spoiling the plot for you! (Sorry.)<br /><br />Although the Clasky family can help--greatly help--Flor educate Cristina at a very elite private school,  a painful dilemma ensues for Flor: should she hold onto her core Mexican beliefs and identity? Should she accept the Clasky's offer to send her daughter Cristina to an elite private school and take the chance for a better education than Flor could probably afford? A thought-provoking scene with Flor and Cristina ensues.<br /><br />In short, although the movie gives us a few laughs and it delivers great acting, the plot itself is just not enough to sustain it 100% of the way. There may be disagreement, too, between viewers: does Flor make the right decision about Cristina and the private school?<br /><br />What's the bottom line? I would recommend this film for its entertainment value and the performances by the actors. If you're looking for another great immortal classic like Gone With The Wind, however, you won't find it here.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>Spanglish starring Adam Sandler and Tea Leoni is a serious and funny film about people's insecurities and there need to be loved. The only thing wrong with this film is the long dialogue, the characters speak too wordy and the scenes are too dragged out, the editor needed to cut the scenes better. The cast is quite good, an impressive performance by Sandler but who really steals the show is Leoni, her comic timing and flawless delivery is the main reason to watch this film.

This a great film to watch even if you're not a fan of Adam Sandler.</p></br><a href="../users/A3W1JJGJHRPH4Y.html">A3W1JJGJHRPH4Y</a><br/><p>The movie has many great moments, but it doesn't really build on them. Nothing really happens in the movie. The plot meanders. The relationships work sometimes. The movie does a good job of developing Tea's character as the psychotic wife. The viewer gets a fuller and fuller picture of her dysfuntionality as the movie goes on. However, her personality is all over the map and it is hard to get a good picture of her. Adam Sandler's character works as the super nice husband. The maid character is supposed to be sane, but never really works out that way. The daughter of the maid's voice over is really confusing sometimes and I don't think it helps much at all.<br /><br />The movie does score some very direct emotional and humourous hits, but it misses just as much. I enjoyed it, but is a rocky ride. The extras includes how to make "The world's best sandwich." The commentaries were good too.</p></br><a href="../users/A1SPB225CVTRUU.html">A1SPB225CVTRUU</a><br/><p>Spanglish is a film that would be more enjoyable for viewers who have learned to speak a second language or have moved from one country to another, because most of the funny moments are generated from culture clash and language barriers. This is not a typical Adam Sandler movie, and he's doing good taste humours here like he did in Punch Drunk Love. The cast is superb in this film, especially Paz Vega(Sex and Lucia) who managed to deliver a wonderful, funny, and dramatic performance as a overly protective single mother(Flor Moreno) working as a housekeeper for the Clasky family.<br /><br />Tea Leoni is very impressive as the comic relief most of the time. She plays Deborah Clasky, a fulltime mom and she's obsessed with exercise and when she became discontended with her husband John(Sandler), she started to cheat on him. She's quite a neurotic case, and only her mother(Evelyn) can fully understand her and gives her good advice. Evelyn is a witty ex-jazz singer and an alcoholic, and she was wild and promiscuous in her younger days. John is a workaholic/renowned chef and restraurant owner. He is trying his best to be a good dad and husband. His daughter is overweight and very self-consious about it, and she befriends with Flor's daughter Cristina(played perfectly by the bilingual Shelbie Bruce) who served as a translator for her mother most of the time. The several months of working for the Clarsky, Flor's life and her relationship with her daughter had reached a volatile state. She feared changes and she resented her daughter for becoming so Americanized.<br /><br />This film is funnier in the first hour, and then it headed a melodramatic direction that intended to build up a touching and meaningful ending. Some of the deleted scenes will provide some clarity on certain "unfinished" scenes. The special feature also included some brief interviews on the leads. I was surprised that Paz Vega didn't speak any English before starring in this movie. Her character actually learned to speak English later in the film, but it's exaggeratted that she could learn so much over the course of one summer.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ990HW13DP08.html">AQ990HW13DP08</a><br/><p>Adam Sandler in a serious role? Yes, after a fashion. As the most famous chef in America, husband, and father, he plays John Clasky, and is married to Deborah, a suburban housewife who raises the bar for what it means to be a type-A control freak. When we meet her mother Evelyn we understand why.This Los Angeles family is very wealthy and profoundly dysfunctional. Enter Flor, a Mexican housekeeper who has a teenage daughter Cristina who is the same age as the Clasky's daughter Bernice. Since her mom does not speak English, Cristina narrates the film for us. You can imagine the sub-plots of this "blended" family, but in the end Flor is a source of humanity, warmth, and normalcy for everyone.</p></br><a href="../users/A1B05INWIDZ74O.html">A1B05INWIDZ74O</a><br/><p>This movie has a couple of themes or leassons.

But, he is a committed family man who deeply loves his daughter Bernie (Sarah Steele) and while he must love his wife for some reason, he is very frustrated with her because her callous disregard for the feelings of Bernie even though Deborah thinks she is doing the right thing.<br /><br />Into this strange, messed up family comes Flor.  She is gentle, and kind, and she doesn't speak a lick of English.  Translation and communication comes through Cristina, stuck between the excitement of a new way of life provided by Deborah (she treats Cristina better than she does her own daughter) and the steady tranquil traditions of her mother.  The conflict of "Spanglish" comes in the form of Deborah.  Deborah will whisk Cristina away for a day long excursion without asking permission from Flor.  Her hurtful comments towards Bernie is upsetting John almost as much as Bernie.  Deborah is paying little attention to her own husband or to her family except as they might relate towards her and her wishes.  It is no wonder that we see a budding friendship (could it be more?) between John and Flor.  John, like Flor, is gentle and kind and loving and is being hurt by his wife far more than he deserves.<br /><br />There is no true narrative here in the sense that "Spanglish" does not directly follow a storyline.  What we have is a movie about the relationships between these characters, most of whom are very likeable.  The crazy thing is that we want John to leave his wife because we know that he would be very happy with Flor and that they would treat each other well.  We want their children to get the love and attention they deserve.  We know that Flor's presence has been nothing but a good thing to John's family and that she is a positive influence with how steady and responsible she is.  If there is a villain here it is Deborah because she is just so unlikeable, yet at heart she must be a good person for John to have married her in the first place.  We only barely see glimpses of her heart, though.<br /><br />"Spanglish" has quite a bit going for it.  The movie has a stellar cast which also includes Cloris Leachman has Deborah's alcoholic mother Evelyn.  Leachman has all the best lines in the movie and I will be surprised if she doesn't pick up an Oscar nomination for her work here.  She steals every scene she is in.  The idea of an alcoholic mother could be a very harsh character, but in "Spanglish" Evelyn is so good natured that one could almost believe that it was Deborah that drove her mother towards the bottle.  Another highlight in this movie is Cristina's translations of conversations between her mother and John.  Not only does Cristina translate the words and the passion of Flor, but also the gestures and so we get a bit of perfect physical comedy with a younger girl saying very adult things.<br /><br />The only real problem with "Spanglish" is that despite the strength of all of its parts, the film itself doesn't come together to make a whole that is nearly as good.  We have a film about several wonderful characters working through their problems, but it doesn't amount to very much.  I can't explain it.  "Spanglish" is a nice movie, a decent movie and is filled with a certain amount of heartwarming material, but perhaps because of Deborah and the conclusion, it never really delivers the promise or the pedigree of the filmmakers.

Tea Leoni rises to the challenge, and Paz is a great discovery. I agree with most other reviewers that this film was heavily mis-marketed. It was a romantic drama with comedic elements. This is what happens when you try to do something different in Hollywood. Where its true that Spanglish avoids a pat ending-I think this is the first time that I'm actually rooting for the hero to leave his wife. And its solely because James L. Brooks refused to give Tea any redeeming qualities. Simply put, her husband was way too good for her. Her confession of misbehaving and the subsequent tears felt like another level manipulation. She never asked or try to understand how her actions affected her husband--or how her actions affected anyone.  Yes, I understand this might very well reflect a certain level realism-but in the land of movies, characters, at some point in the storytelling, are suppose to have a character arc and change.  Take Jack Nicholson's character in As Good as it Gets (antoher James L. Brooks creation) All the characters change or grow during the course of the story.  In THIS story, everyone stays exactly the same--and in return-its an unremarkable journey.<br /><br />Mrs. C refused to the end to hold up a mirror to herself or bear any blame. Just when you think she's cornered-she then turns to her mother and say-this is all your fault. Even now, I'm thinking-this man chose to live the rest of days with this lunatic. He deserved better than that.<br /><br />Shelbie Bruce (daughter) was adorable-and I understand the sacrifice was his feelings for his family. But what type of family are we talking about when you have a looney, self-servant mom at the helm?<br /><br />I was rooting for Flor to show up that night, snatch her daughter back, and open a good old fashion can of whoop arse.  Now that's a level of realism I can deal with.<br /><br />Good film-but I wished for a better and more satisfying ending.</p></br><a href="../users/A2VD3CYOEMJ6SR.html">A2VD3CYOEMJ6SR</a><br/><p>This was a comedy with a pretty good plot and would otherwise deserve at least 4 stars. My problem is, however, that some of the characters are not believable in their roles. Tea Leoni, who plays Deborah Clasky,the wealthy wife of a highly successful chef and restaurant owner, played by Adam Sandler, is fabulous as a nuerotic Southern Californian. However, Sandler, who plays his role as a good natured type that you would expect him to play, is just not believable as the restaurant owner who becomes fabulously wealthy from the restaurant. He is not convincing as a world class chef who is also a businessman adept enough to make his restaurant into a multimillion dollar business.<br /><br />The plot revolves around a housekeeper named Flor, hire by Deborah, played by Paz Vega. She has a daughter, the same age as the Clasky's daughter, and as the housekeeper, her daughter, Christina, is well treated by the Clasky's. Flor has certain problems with the Clasky's largess since she is very proud. It could be a compelling plot but, Vega is almost as unconvincing in her role as Sandler is in his. She plays a Mexican who moved to Los Angeles and while living there, never left the barrio until landing her job with the Clasky's. However, she looks assimilated into Southern California culture. Even though she is initially unable to speak English, she nontheless has the look and mannerisms of a well coiffed, reasonably fashionably dressed Southern Californian. Given the nature of her role, she would be expected to come across as much more provincial.<br /><br />The movie had potential. The Clasky's daughter was overweight and ungainly and needed love which Flor tried to provide. Meanwhile, Christina was the daughter of an immigrant mother who, for the first time, was obtaining many of the finer things in life, including private schooling. The parents of each girl, at times, bristled at the interference of the other. The characters have to click, however, and although some do (most notably, the girls), some key characters do not. Therefore, my recommendation is only lukewarm.</p></br><a href="../users/A36EW68H08UOCS.html">A36EW68H08UOCS</a><br/><p>James Brooks' "Spanglish" features Adam Sandler, but this is NOT "Happy Gilmore".<br /><br />I am reading many negative reviews here and I have to say the Mrs. and I didn't think it was that bad.  James Brooks has made some witty dramedies in the past, and Spanglish isn't going to make anyone forget "Terms of Endearment" or "As Good As It Gets", but it's not bad.<br /><br />Paz Vega stars as Flor, a Mexican immigrant who is in almost every scene yet speaks hardly any English.  Flor's husband has inexplicably left Flor and their young daughter, Cristina.  Cristina is portrayed as a 12 year old by the wonderful Shelbie Bruce.  She is not only an accomplished young actress, but most of her scenes are bilingual as she acts as interpreter between Flor and the Clasky family.<br /><br />Flor comes to America and is hired as a domestic for John and Deborah Clasky.  Sandler portrays John, who has opened a little restaurant after moving from New York and is declared by the New York Times the Greatest Chef in America.  Not much is made of his Cheffing - he could have as easily been Greatest Dog-Catcher, Salesman, etc.  Deborah is portrayed by Tea Leoni, and Deborah has issues.  I've read many reviews that suggest that her performance is a little "out there". Roger Ebert wrote "Deborah doesn't just go over the top, she waves goodbye as she disappears into cuckoo-land."<br /><br />In my professional dealings I unfortunately encounter Deborah's kind frequently.  Deborah was a high-powered type A executive until she was downsized, and now she's all type A and no outlet.  Her family - in fact everyone in contact with her - suffers for it.<br /><br />Cloris Leachman has a wonderful role as Deborah's mother, an alcoholic who was once a notable jazz singer.  She loves Deborah when pretty much no one else can, and she insightfully tells us at the end of the movie that she hasn't had a drink in weeks, and no one noticed, which must mean that she was a pretty well-functioning drunk.<br /><br />The Clasky's have a little girl about the same age as Flor's Cristina, and Sarah Steele's performance as Bernice is as good as Shelbie Bruce's Cristina - just without the bilingual dialogue.  Bernice is a smart, cheerful pre-teen with a little weight problem, and Deborah does and says all the things that dent Bernice's self-esteem.<br /><br />Deborah is high-strung and neurotic, Flor is beautiful and sweet-natured.  Is it possible John might be attracted to someone other than Deborah?<br /><br />I expected conflict - maybe even a little adultery - but the way Brooks' screenplay works through these issues was both realistic and satisfyingly open-ended.<br /><br />Reviewers who complain that the film ends with many issues unresolved must live lives that have all their issues resolved as well.<br /><br />Not the best Brooks.  But not as bad as much dreck released these days.</p></br><a href="../users/A2DSXA1E02C86D.html">A2DSXA1E02C86D</a><br/><p>The plot of SPANGLISH has been described as "the story of a Mexican woman and her daughter who travel all the way to Los Angeles to bring sanity to a crazy Anglo family." Right. That's like defining World War II as a minor squabble that discomfited Europe and the Far East.<br /><br />The gorgeous Spanish (as in Spain) actress Paz Vega makes her American screen debut as Flor, who, with her daughter Cristina (Shelbie Bruce), travel up from Mexico to SoCal for the employment opportunities. (Whether they're "documented" or not is, in this politically correct age, left to the imagination.) Though she speaks no English, Flor lands a job as a housekeeper with the well-to-do Clasky family, which includes the Mister, John (Adam Sandler), the Missus, Deborah (Tea Leoni), daughter Bernice (Sarah Steele), and Deborah's resident, alcoholic mother, Evelyn (Cloris Leachman). There's also a Clasky son, but his role is so minor as to go virtually unnoticed. When necessary, Cristina, who speaks English like a native, translates for her Mom. There must be wonderful language schools for the economically challenged south of the border.<br /><br />Flor, whose role eventually evolves to live-in maid as the household migrates from Beverly Hills to a rented Malibu beach house for the summer, stumbles into a tense situation. Deborah is unsatisfied with her marriage. John, owner/#1 chef of a four-star restaurant, is Mr. Nice Guy without a clue. Deborah has an awkward relationship with Bernice, who, overweight and with dental braces, doesn't meet Mom's expectations; Deborah seemingly has no relationship with her son at all, good or bad; Deborah disapproves of Evelyn's constant drinking. Deborah spends her time running to keep in shape and satisfy some inner concept of self image. Come to think of it, Deborah doesn't do much of anything. The plot's conflict emerges as Deborah begins to treat the perfect Cristina as her own daughter without Flor's permission, e.g., having their hair highlighted together, and getting Cristina enrolled in a prestigious private school. In the meantime, John is rendered incoherent by Flor's beauty and warmth, but, being a decent fellow, he doesn't do anything about it that might otherwise be expected of a male with normal hormone levels.<br /><br />Superficially, SPANGLISH has appeal. Deborah remains engaging even as she verges on Total Bitch. (OK, ok. I think Tea Leoni is a Hottie.) And there are some genuinely funny moments, as when Cristina translates an overwrought outburst by Flor, complete with vigorous hand and arm waving, and when Evelyn sobers up and tells her daughter to snap out of it. My biggest problem is with Paz Vega as Flor. She's truly eye candy I can appreciate, but I think the producers of the film want the audience to react to her as did the stupefied John, i.e., assign her a separate gender altogether based on looks. When Flor and Cristina walk off into the California sunset at the film's conclusion, all the difficulties back at the Clasky house are left unresolved. Indeed, the resentment that Bernice felt for having her place in Mom's affections co-opted by Cristine was never even dealt with. So, what was all this except a beauty contest with Vega as the preordained winner?<br /><br />While I'm allowing for the fact that the point of the film was perhaps to introduce Paz to American audiences, I still felt manipulated more than the norm by the scriptwriters. If you want to see a substantive role in current release by an acknowledged screen beauty, see CLOSER starring Julia Roberts. Granted, it's not a comedy, or even something for the whole family, but at least it's not fluff masquerading as a movie with a message.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ.html">A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ</a><br/><p>Oh, what a massive disappointment James L. Brooks has created.  Not being too excited about his work after seeing the devastatingly poor film As Good As It Gets, I thought that he may be able to redeem himself with some Sandler magic, while showcasing the point (like P.T. Anderson did) that Sandler has this very rich emotional side to him as well as the hysterical moments.  Sadly, this never did happen.  With an extremely choppy story, some overzealous acting by everyone involved, and one of the poorest production values this side of the Hollywood Mississippi, Spanglish proves that you can have a powerful cast, an interesting idea, and an Oscar winning director, but unless you compile them correctly, all you have is a jumbled mess of garbage.<br /><br />My largest issue with this film has to be the unconnected story.  There were so many creative ideas in this film, that from the outside it looked like it could have been an Oscar contender, but as you view it from the inside, it is nothing but unfinished roads and dead ends.  Brooks knows how to tell a story, in fact, he has won an Oscar for telling his stories, but in Spanglish, he took in more than he could handle.  There were so many different elements in this film, from Leoni's secret, to Sandler's cooking, to Vega's mothering skills, to a child's dream, that Brooks could not keep up with them all and successfully bring conclusions to each of them.  Spanglish jumped from one moment to the next without giving the viewer an opportunity to say, "Well, at least that was resolved".  It was so choppy that I hoped that Brooks would have provided seatbelts to anyone watching.  With all these themes and elements converging into a very unclimactic ending, you leave this story with a sense of "wha..." You have no real grasp on this story, the characters, or the ending as the final credits begin to roll.  Who was the true protagonist to the story?  Who was the central focus?  What were the major themes that I should have been watching?  There were so many negative "who" and "what" questions at the end of this movie that I immediately threw the case to the corner of the room as if it were possessed.  Brooks crafted a pitiful story that he could not control, and the final product was this hastily made story, which began in the middle of nowhere and thankfully ended there as well.<br /><br />With the story giving us nothing but questions instead of answers, it is then left up to the actors to carry the weight of the entertainment on their shoulders.  Again, with Sandler, Leoni, and Vega, you think that you would have an amazing dynamic set in place that a story could be poor without anyone noticing.  Well, let me tell you ... it was noticeable.  Sandler was not the lead that Brooks needed for this film.  While it is obvious that he can play an "every man" quite well, it is the emotional pressures that he has trouble with.  The scene in which he is asked to cry is ... well ... hysterically pathetic.  There is just no excitement around his character, and at one time I referred to his character in this film as "bland".  I think it is because Tea Leoni, who puts too much emotion into her character, poorly balances him out.  Here you have Sandler doing a low-key performance, and Leoni is well over the top.  There was no development in either of their characters, just screaming and crying.  This does not help progress the story well either.  Vega added nothing more than a "cute" element that honestly wasn't needed at all.  The only character that I thought did an exceptional job was Cloris Leachman who took these horrible performances and created her moment to shine.  She stole the film from everyone else, and I was proud of her.<br /><br />Finally, I would like to say that if your films have won Oscars in the past, and you are living well off The Simpsons money, than you have the budget to film actors actually driving a car to their destination instead of just using a green screen and fake driving.  Maybe it was just me, but I felt as if the production value of this film was not Hollywood standards.  Now, don't get me wrong, I don't mind a low-budget film at all, but I felt that Brooks was being super-cheap in Spanglish.  This hurt this film tremendously.  Maybe it was the DVD transfer, but it felt as if Brooks was cutting numbers in the film and it began with the production value.  It started out strong, but somehow felt less and less like itself by the end.  This did not make for good cinematic viewing.<br /><br />Overall, I was very unimpressed with this picture.  Brooks had a decent idea that somewhere along the creation of it went horribly wrong.  One could say that he had too many ideas and could not carry the weight of them all successfully on his camera.  There were ideas piled upon ideas that literally went nowhere, nor didn't really have any conclusion.  The elements were there, Brooks couldn't do anything with them.  Coupled with the fact that there was not any decent acting in the entire film.  This emotional step was too big for Sandler (and too fast), while Leoni was too over-the-top.  Vega felt like a stand in, while I just couldn't grasp the kiddy elements.  Finally, what hurt this film the most, I believe was the poor production value (especially in the car scenes) that brought this film into the realm of bad news bears.  While I think I am in the minority, I believe that this was not the greatest outing for Brooks, nor anyone else involved.<br /><br />Grade: * out of *****</p></br></body></html>

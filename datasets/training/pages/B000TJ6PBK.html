Especially when they're based on the works of authors I admire.  When it comes to horror writing, Stephen King is above par--he is the guy you compare all others to.  There have been some wonderful adaptations of his novels; there have been some horrendous adaptations as well.  Fortunately for all concerned, "1408" fits snugly into the former category.<br /><br />Mike Enslin is a non-believer.  No ghosts, no goolies, not even a god.  He's searching, though; he looks everywhere for evidence of the paranormal, but has yet to see a glimpse.  Then he gets word of the Dolphin.  And room 1408.  He's warned to stay away.  The manager bribes him with expensive liquor.  But Mike doesn't listen.  And once he enters 1408, he has one hour to live.<br /><br />This movie creeped me out.  I say that so bluntly because movies rarely creep me out.  "The Exorcist" does it.  "Jaws" does it.  A couple others, perhaps, but not many.  Of course you have your genuine shock moments--turn around and a guy slashes with a knife, some creep-o pops out of a ventilation shaft.  But true horror is atmospheric; and what's more atmospheric than a dingy, supposedly haunted hotel room?<br /><br />If nothing else, "1408" shows that John Cusack has what it takes to carry a movie by himself.  Don't get me wrong--the acting is great.  Samuel L. Jackson's performance is top-notch; his scene with Cusack in the office is tremendously entertaining.  But Cusack gets the majority of the screen time, mostly by himself.  His dry wit comes in handy to counter-balance the stark horror of the movie.  Not saying "1408" is a horror comedy; just saying, you'll probably get a laugh or two before you wet yourself in terror.  That should make up for any discomfort, I think.</p></br><a href="../users/A33PNAQ33DGBJG.html">A33PNAQ33DGBJG</a><br/><p>give me something to write about. This movie was suppose to be scary with a story behind it. Why was the room haunted? The best line in the whole movie was "You can check out but never leave the room! If you would like to try our express check out (a noose appears in all of the rooms)please let us know." John Cusack's acting is his usual but the script lacked something worth acting for. Don't expect to see Samuel L. Jackson for more than five minutes!</p></br><a href="../users/AJRFZ0VZ0LD26.html">AJRFZ0VZ0LD26</a><br/><p>There is nothing in this horror movie that we have not seen before.  Film is based on King's short story about haunted room in NYC hotel.  It seems anyone who checks into this room does not check out alive.  For two hours we watch John Cusack's character get taunted by ghosts who talk to him on the phone and put his thru ordeal of steaming hot room, freezing room, flooded room...  It is almost as if writer and film director are trying to find every possible way known to mankind to kill this character.  The big premise of the film is actually play of our human psyche.  So if you are a parent, loosing a child would be one of the most fearful thought you could have.  Therefore, out ghosts in room 1408 play on main character's grief and guilt of not being able to protect his own child Katie of dying.  That emotion is the driving force of this film.  Adult viewing only.  Themes of suicide (i.e. jumping thru the window from the hotel's 14th floor) could be too disturbing for young audiences.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>There's a famous line in a famous song by The Eagles <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000002GVO">Hotel California</a> that sums up the fate of those that enter the haunted room whose numbers add up to 13 on the 13th floor (aka 1408) of the Dolphin Hotel.<br /><br />There's a famous line in a famous song by Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000346B">Let's Call the Whole Thing Off</a> that sums up what you should do if you're on the fence about buying 1408.<br /><br />If you're looking for a great little haunted house story that takes a fraction of the time to tell than 1408 did, check out the episode "Television Terror" with Morton Downey in Season 2 of Tales From the Crypt <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000A88EU0">Tales from the Crypt: The Complete Second Season</a>. Plus with Tales Season 2, you get 17 other spooktacular episodes to keep you entertained if you're 'dying' for more than 30 minutes of scares.<br /><br />I remember reading 1408 in Stephen King's collection of short stories <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0743457358">Everything's Eventual : 14 Dark Tales</a> back in 2002. 1408 wasn't one of the most impressionable King stories from that collection, and the 2007 movie adaptation with John Cusack held suit...not impressionable. Not a bad movie, but certainly not a Horror film that will be remembered as great.<br /><br />There are some good scares (that reminded me of that Tales From the Crypt episode that I mentioned earlier) in 1408. 1408 held my attention well enough, and John Cusack does a stand-up job at what is practically a solo performance all the way through (with brief {but always excellent} appearances by Samuel L. Jackson). But all in all, 1408 seemed like one of those Horror movies that I'd seen before...and I don't mean because I'd read the short story years ago...I mean because it just wasn't that original.<br /><br />So unless you've got nothing else in your viewing queue, 1408 might be best viewed as a hey-look-what's-just-about-to-start-on-cable flick.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HII4U9WQ0XUV.html">A2HII4U9WQ0XUV</a><br/><p>Man, that's what they call room service!<br /><br />OK, imagine this: you've flown in on the red-eye, LA to Boston, cramped flight, surly stewardesses---oh wait, they're flight attendants nowadays, or resume-challenged critters, whatever. They were surly. One spilled coffee on you, and that was the nice one: the other managed to ignore your call button all the way from the badlands over Nevada to Logan.<br /><br />And anyway, nowadays flying business is like renting a timeshare in Dante's 8th circle of Hell: fat men on the left of you flu victim on the right of you, into the jaws of death sat the 500!<br /><br />One rough cab ride through a tangle of dubious streets later, you're checked in to your sanctuary, your beachhead, your staging point & command center for the busy week ahead. You're wiped out. You want to get out of your oxfords, pad around in comfy clothes, pajamas maybe, fix yourself a little pot of that in-room coffee, brush your teeth, flop on the bed.<br /><br />You fumble with the magnetic key, the door makes a little hiss and opens inward---GASP!---your mind reels in shock, horror, agony!<br /><br />They said a double-king----this sad excuse for a bed looks like something out of summer camp!<br /><br />The room is the size of a broom closet! There's no mini-bar! There is zero shower pressure! And worse---the whole place reeks of stale cigarette smoke! They promised you a NON-SMOKING room!<br /><br />Man I'm telling you, when you're a business traveller, hotel rooms can really be a killer.But that's nothing compared to the Killer with wall-to-wall carpeting masquerading as an innocent little 40 x 40 square of Manhattan commercial real estate in the new Stevie King adaptation "1408".<br /><br />It's a killer. A legendary killer, an oubliette of murder & madness relegated to the Bad Old History of the Dolphin Hotel, responsible for 56 deaths over its busy little lifespan: murders, suicides, hangings, stabbings, the works.<br /><br />It is crouched, waiting in the stale, inky darkness, waiting for meat. It hasn't had a victim in years because the hotel keeps it locked up, recondite, no vacancy---ever. I imagine it's pretty hungry.<br /><br />All it needs is an occupant, and a little room to work its magic. Let's start with the idea, which is King's in one sense (the viciously haunted hotel-room), but universal in another: hotel rooms, consummately transient places, are singularly creepy.<br /><br />I remember many times sleepwalking among the blocky, startling objects standing their ground in unfamiliar quarters: muttering to myself, fumbling at my lock, bumping into strange arrangements of stale-smelling curtains and furniture. How many times do you think someone has gone a-roving in the deep nightland of dreams and snapped his neck because of the hotel room's unfamiliar topography?<br /><br />Second is the setup and build, which is masterfully, deliciously done here: Samuel L. Jackson spins his gruesome little tale in grim counterpoint to Cusack's masterfully apathetic fencing, and this well-appointed little duel nicely sets the mood and pulled me in for a brutal little night of ghoulies and ghosties and long-legged beasties. It's a nice, classic, atmospheric build---but it did something else I hadn't expected.<br /><br />It made me nervous.<br /><br />So to begin with, I'm keyed up. I'm tense.<br /><br />Director Mikael Hafstrom, working on first US film, gave me the crawls: the voices shrieking random nubmers and cryptic threats over the phone, that dull throb of despair, of nihilistic horror, the certainty that the universe is vast and endless and impersonal and cares not a whit about your fleeting, purposeless little life. That's evil.<br /><br />And for about 45 minutes, I have to give 1408 credit for giving me a good case of the crawls. Hafstrom creates, remarkably, a very visual sense of disorientation that works its way to a kind of paranoid vertigo. His malign Room plays all sorts of diabolic little tricks on Cusack at first, creating the sneaking suspicious that someone's in the room, in the vent, leading to a nasty little game of hide-and-seek---in which you really don't want to find out what's doing the Hiding.<br /><br />Even the nervous little battle of wills with a faulty A/C---when the repairman (champ vet actor Isiah Whitlock) refuses to cross the threshold and instead walks Cusack through the repair, I'm thinking "smart man."<br /><br />But in the end, it's all for naught. Like any hotel room, much of the charm wears off about halfway through your stay. Watching the insidious, nihilistic, world-hating evil thing holed up in Room 1408 drive John Cusack mad: intriguing, only because you're not sure exactly what the room will cook up. Seeing big cracks ripple up through the wall and blood pour out, or the room explode, or a big vast icy tundra appear---I've seen that before. About the time you see the jumping ghost (man, talk about a depressing spirit), the movie is headed to Dullsville.<br /><br />Take my advice: on this one, get an early wakeup call---and take plan on checking out early. Trust me: you'll thank me for it in the morning.<br /><br />JSG</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>If your horror movie tastes run less towards chainsaw-wielding maniacs and more towards things-that-go-bump-in-the-night, then this is the movie for you.  Based on a short story by the great Stephen King, "1408" is one of the genuine movie sleepers of summer 2007.<br /><br />John Cusack gives a tour-de-force performance as Mike Enslin, a successful writer who specializes in the investigation of paranormal activity with a particular emphasis on hotel rooms that have the reputation for being haunted.  The twist is that Enslin is, essentially, a nonbeliever who spends most of his time and energy debunking the very subject off which he is making his living.  The 1408 of the title refers to a room in a swanky, five-star Manhattan hotel in which, we are told, no fewer than fifty-six guests checked in but never checked out, having met their untimely demises there in the decades since the establishment opened.  Determined to put an end to the "foolishness," Enslin moves into the room convinced he will ride out the night in utter peace and safety.  He has, of course, another think coming.<br /><br />As adapted by Matt Greenberg, Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski, "1408" succeeds mainly by keeping it straight and simple and by concentrating with laser-like focus on the character of Enslin and his relevant back story.  The multi-layered plotting keeps us guessing from first moment to last, so that we never quite know whether what Enslin is experiencing is really happening or whether he is suffering some form of mental breakdown brought on by the death of his young daughter and the subsequent breakup of his marriage a few years back.  Along with director Mikael Hafstrom, the master craftsmen responsible for the film's phenomenal art direction and sound recording draw us into the strange world they've created where nothing is quite what it appears to be and where we spend most of our time nervously scanning the edges of the frame to see what surprise is next poised to jump out at us.<br /><br />Cusack, who has long been underrated as a performer, gets the chance to really show us his acting chops in this role.  He allows us to clearly see the fear and vulnerability hidden beneath his character's wisecracking, cynical exterior.  Samuel L. Jackson and Mary McCormack also excel in the small but pivotal roles of the wise hotel manager and Enslin's estranged but faithful wife, respectively.<br /><br />For those who can remember a time when fright films had more on their minds than simple gore and grue, "1408" is like a refreshing, restorative tonic on a hot summer day.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>A tour de force performance by the underrated JOHN CUSACK fuels this creepy adaptation of Stephen King's short story.<br />CUSACK plays Michael Enslin, a cynical author of those coffee table pictorials on supposedly haunted mansions/hotels.  Enslin, embittered by the death of his little girl, boasts that in none of his investigations did he have any ghostly encounters...until he decides to stay overnight in Room 1408 at the Dolphin Hotel where over 50 people met mysterious deaths.  Creepy hotel manager Samuel L Jackson warns Enslin that no one lasts more than an hour in the room and he almost refuses to let him stay, but Enslin persists and his night of terror begins.  The movie has some good jolts, and although it's script is sometimes muddled and the ending a little anticlimactic, 1408 is a good ghost story and Cusack dominates it with his performance.  In a non-horror genre, this performance would be generating Oscar buzz, but it's rare that the academy honors this type of film, although Cusack is that good!!</p></br><a href="../users/A2PN7Z2VTHICL8.html">A2PN7Z2VTHICL8</a><br/><p>Mike Enslin (John Cusack) writes "horror" guides to haunted places.  With several books under his belt, he's become numb to the supposedly haunted surroundings he puts himself into.  Until he hears about room 1408 at the Dolphin Hotel in New York City.  In order to check into room 1408, Mike must get his attorney involved, regarding some blue law that if the room requested is unoccupied it must be rented upon request.  It's the only way Mr. Olin (Samuel Jackson), manager of the Dolphin, will rent the room to Enslin.<br /><br />Enslin checks in, under the caution from Olin that no one has ever lasted longer than one hour in the room.  At first, its an ordinary room.  But then things start happening.  The clock radio continuously goes off on its own, playing "We've Only Just Begun" each time.  The room warps, the pictures come alive, ghosts appear, the door locks itself, the thermostat malfunctions, and visions from Enslin's horrible past with his wife and daughter begin to infiltrate reality.<br /><br />Cusack's performance is excellent, as is Samuel Jackson and Tony Sheloub (Enslin's attorney).  This is probably Cusack's best performance of his career, very believable.<br /><br />I read the short story before watching the movie and actually wished that I hadn't.  I believe the movie would have intrigued me better if I hadn't seen the changes made to the story in order to make it movie material.  The creeping madness of the story was lost on film.  Too much of the fear was internal and hard to transfer to movie entertainment.  Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad movie, it's just not a great movie either.  I recommend watching the movie before reading the story, and I recommend a rental before purchase.  Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A3OH101U0CPUC7.html">A3OH101U0CPUC7</a><br/><p>Mike Enslin (John Cusack) is a travel writer who specializes in haunted locations.  When he discovers the Dolphin Hotel has a room responsible for numerous fatalities he can't resist the challenge of spending the night.  The hotel manager, Mr. Olin (Samuel Jackson) tries to talk him out of it, literally begs him to forego the night's stay but Enslin won't hear of it.  Enslin may write about the paranormal, but he doesn't actually believe in it.  Needless to say, room 1408 will change all of that.  Things start slow and then get progressively nasty as the room torments him relentlessly.<br /><br />John Cusack gives an excellent performance as burned out Mike Enslin.  As we learn more about his past involving the death of his child and his failed marriage, Cusack does a great job of conveying the emotions of his shattered character.  Samuel Jackson is also strong as Olin.  He's strong, poised, and believable as an upscale hotel manager.  The two actors also work well onscreen together.  In some ways, the highlight of the movie is early on when they go head-to-head in Olin's office.<br /><br />Like any good horror movie, things start off slow and then the tension starts to build.  There are plenty of creepy happenings, some "gotcha" jump moments, and the underlying story is more than interesting.  The ending is fairly inventive and satisfying.<br /><br />Those interested in the original short story by Stephen King that inspired this movie can find it in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0743457358">Everything's Eventual : 14 Dark Tales</a>.  The movie is similar up to a point but goes in its own direction for most of the second half.<br /><br />My criteria for a horror film are simple.  If I feel plenty of tension from the suspense of what will happen next and it doesn't completely gross me out with gore, then it's a winner.  In this case, the tension is definitely there, the gore is almost nonexistent, and the characters are far more compelling than we normally see in horror movies.</p></br><a href="../users/A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z.html">A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z</a><br/><p>I made a point of seeing the Film in the theatre and enjoyed it simply because it was so much like a dream experience, a nightmare.That really is the key to what they have on film, the fragmentary nature of the experience and the way the story emulates a dream so closely.The sound in the theatre was great, and the DVD sound is superb. The Camera work is great work  also.<br />Especially on second and third viewings.<br />I watched the Directors cut first, especially since I had seen the thetarical release of the film first and was utterly blown away with the sound , the quality of film, and the things I had remembered.Having a 5.1 system at home, my system is closer to me than the theatre ( but not better than the theatre) so, I can get a loud effect, as well as a full sound effect.Its really mostly in the final third that the major changes are placed, but when seeing the film additional times, the first two thirds are so well crafted and well acted that when they stand up so well, its really a great statement about the film.<br />The DVD is Well Packaged, and looks Great for the extra price.The 5 Cards you get are a great buzz, but did anyone get the "Don't visit Room 1408" Card ? Disc One has only a Few extras, rather few  in fact, but disc two has an abundance including some deletions that show some possible ambiguities in the role of Mr Olin. The Commentary is technically informative , but not, I would say entertaining: it rather shows how the Swedes can produce technically great films,but need good screen writers to do the frontline job.If you like the two different version of the film, skip the Commentary.<br />**<br />Feb 27 2008: This film withstands multiple viewings  and feels as good as the first few viewings. It is fast becoming a favorite like the relatively recent TIME MACHINE, that I have watched MANY times when I want to relax.</p></br><a href="../users/AZCDCO6KK2T81.html">AZCDCO6KK2T81</a><br/><p>1408 is the latest screen incarnation from the mind of Stephen King, one of my favorite authors, and this time Hollywood has well-adapted a story of his.<br /><br />King has traveled down this chilling haunted hotel road before with his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0743437497">The Shining</a> which was made into something of a minor classic by Stanley Kubrick; however, Kubrick's version of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005ATQJ">The Shining</a> turned left at some point when it should have turned right.  This time Hollywood got it right with King and much is due to Cusack's powerful performance from beginning to end.<br /><br />This time instead of having a never believable as sane Jack Nicholson as a tormented writer attempting to exercise his personal demons and plunging into madness, we have John Cusack who actually is believable as a sane writer who just might be going insane after one hour in an "(expletive) evil room" according to the wonderfully understated but sinister seeming Samuel L. Jackson who attempts to convince Cusack not to enter the room by giving him teasing tidbits that would entice anyone to want to just see the room.  He practices an evil reverse psychology with Cusack's character, Mike Enslin, that works like a charm.<br /><br />I don't want to spoil this review with giving away the plot twists, but just when you think the film is over and all is resolved satisfactorily . . . well . . . it ain't!  Clever writing, camera movement, and a surprisingly low-budget approach really add to the over chilling effect of this film.  Of course, this film really doesn't belong to the brilliant mind of Stephen King, but rather to John Cusack's flawless performance.  Is it Oscar-nomination material?  No, not really, but it's brilliant nevertheless and in what is basically a one character and one location film, he must and does carry the film.<br /><br />This film is worth running out to see and worth purchasing when it comes out on DVD even though it loses its punch a bit when the mystery is solved.  Like M. Night Shyamalan's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004BZIY">The Sixth Sense</a>, this film has excellent repeat value and will maintain its creepiness over multiple viewings even after the mystery is no longer a mystery.</p></br><a href="../users/A1OYW08VVPMP3Q.html">A1OYW08VVPMP3Q</a><br/><p>This Stephen King film about a haunted hotel room and the paranormal skeptic wo insists on staying in it has some riveting scenes.

But if your a fan of Samuel L Jackson and John Cusack then pick this movie up and watch it.  It will keep you entertained from start to finish if your into King's style of suspense, horor, and trillers.  I have been watching it time and time again and never get tired of the movie.

I think you will love it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FMJJKSVQDDQ.html">A1FMJJKSVQDDQ</a><br/><p>NOTE: This review contains MAJOR SPOILERS<br /><br />A specific hotel room in the Dolphin Hotel, New York, has become a breeding ground for disaster. In Room 1408, people have killed either themselves or other people through the ages, for no apparent reason whatsoever. The staff has since abandoned not only the room, but the entire floor as well (the thirteenth). Nobody is allowed on the thirteenth floor unless someone is supposed to be, such as maids or janitors. Mike Enslin (Cusack) is a skeptic writer who specializes on paranormal activities, and he wants to know if 1408 really is a hellhole or if the murders are powered by false superstition. The manager of the hotel (Jackson) warns him about the dangers of staying in Room 1408 for about one hour, but Enslin doesn't budge. As soon as he finds himself in Room 1408, bad things happen, of course. And this is when his own beliefs on the paranormal are drastically challenged.<br /><br />This is one of the more effective (and intelligent) horror films that I've recently seen. When other horror films rely on blood, gore, and whiny teenage girls, "1408" relies more on atmosphere and psychological effects. There are a few jump scares here and there, but they're actually done pretty well. This also has a more mature tone: this is the kind of horror film that is suited more for adults than for teenagers and kids. I'm sure several teenagers enjoy this, too, but I do think that this movie is primarily for adults. The one problem I had with the movie was when Enslin is convinced that his stay at the hotel was only a dream. This scene is situated very late in the film, right before he realizes that he is still in the hotel, and it's somewhat annoying, considering that the "dream sequence" is an old and tired gimmick that we've seen many times before. I know that we as the viewer are supposed to believe that it's not a dream at all, but it's done far too well as it looks and feels a bit too predictable. This is my only gripe, however, as everything else in the movie works.<br /><br />Now, I want to talk about the ending to this movie. The alternate ending (the one that's on the DVD) has been fairly criticized for its more depressing outcome. I think the criticisms are unjust, because I feel that this ending is far superior to the original theatrical ending. I have seen both endings, and, in my opinion, the alternate is more effective compared to the theatrical. I don't want it to be conventional. I don't like it when these particular horror films have a typical happy ending, where all the problems are solved with a feel-good attitude. With this alternate ending, it challenges you by going against your emotions and making you think of the consequences that you have just seen on the screen. Also, to me, this ending fits more to the entire movie. Enslin sacrificing himself to prevent his estranged wife from being 1408's next victim shows that he really changed. In the past, he has made some selfish decisions before his daughter's death. Even though he does lose his life in the end, he realizes that he has one last chance to redeem himself, and he accepts it despite a few consequences.<br /><br />Overall, this is one of the better horror films to have come out in the year 2007, and I even think that it surpasses some other horror films in the present. Keep in mind, this is not as excellent as The Exorcist or The Shining, but it's pretty close.<br /><br />Grade: A-</p></br><a href="../users/A3A4WQL80WOTMH.html">A3A4WQL80WOTMH</a><br/><p>It's quick to draw you in, and it does fairly get under your skin in a kind of frustrating way, although it's not a seamless movie and you can feel the hand of the movie makers in it too much. Samuel Jackson wasn't convincing as the hotel manager in spite of his two words of French, and he gets more billing than he deserves as he must occupy about 15 minutes worth of movie time.  Cusack wasn't bad.  The chill factor is akin to the kind of drug paranoia associated with people who went off the deep end with LSD or some other such substance and never 'made it back' (Syd Barret?).  Sixties child S. King's work has often been influenced by the psychedelic potential, which offers interesting possibilities for his novels and more so when left to the imagination rather than the screen.  There are some decent visual moments in the film, but there are just as many others that simply feel like gaudy Hollywood manipulation.  The premise of stepping into this room is that you are stepping into another dimension simutaneously - a dimension which doesn't follow the laws of logic or time, is bent on tormenting those who enter, and from which there is no escape, as it is hardly of this world in the first place.  Charming, eh?<br /><br />The film doesn't really compare with Kubrick's Shining.  Yes, they were both Stephan King, yes they both take place in hotels.  But where The Shining is a masterful work of art on all levels (story, acting, cinematography), 1408 is a kind of fast food by comparison, with a quick story, so-so character acting and more special effects than dynamite film work.  It does leave a mark though as do so many of King's stories, tapping into a kind of primal paranoia.  I give this film 3.5 stars, and maybe it deserved 4, but not 5.  I'm going to watch the alternate ending on the second dvd now, which supposedly does away with the "happy ending" of the theater version on disc one.</p></br><a href="../users/A2582KMXLK2P06.html">A2582KMXLK2P06</a><br/><p>I can't say I'm as thrilled with 1408 as most people.<br /><br />The movie did an INCREDIBLE job in the beginning building up suspense that the hotel room the main character wanted to stay in was full of unexplainable evil, and had a dangerous history of countless deaths over the years of the previous visitors that stayed in the room.  After all the convincing that the guy should NOT stay in the room from Samuel L. Jackson's character, I was anticipating what kind of danger this room would hold.<br /><br />The creepy build up as the guy (who was a book writer by the way) was approaching the room while walking down the hotel hallway was quite good too, with an elevator opening by itself, and flies buzzing over the food on the plates that were sitting on a tray outside a hotel room.  You could sense an enormous danger right around the corner.<br /><br />Once the guy entered the room and started experiencing how insane the room really was, this is where the movie started to lose me... but only a little bit.<br /><br />A nice twist having the Carpenters "We've Only Just Begun" constantly playing on the alarm clock radio, haha.  I love that song.  The history of the band itself was a tragedy, though I don't think the movie directors intended the band to be the focus of the storyline- it was just a random song they chose that was appropriate for the film because of the song title and the beautiful melody of the vocals worked REALLY work in this kind of uncomfortable setting.<br /><br />Anyway, once the guy started getting comfortable inside the room (or rather, UNcomfortable) strange things began to happen.<br /><br />Of course this is a horror movie, so the suspense started off slow and builded gradually.  Once the guy realized something was terribly wrong (and arrogantly thought beforehand that NOTHING would happen to him) he started having hallucinations.  It was a REAL challenge trying to figure out what was real and what was just the guys hallucinations creeping in.  Of course the evil in the room was forcing the guy to have hallucinations quite often about his dead daughter and almost drowning in a ocean (and waking up near a beach) but it was REALLY confusing to me what was really happening and what wasn't.<br /><br />I also feel the movie went a little too far with the creepiness and the hallucinations of the room.  Come on, the ENTIRE room turns into a freezer suddenly as the guy almost freezes to death?  The ENTIRE room floods with water as he almost drowns?  It went WAY too far sometimes and the creepiness went away as a result.<br /><br />1408 is quite entertaining as far as the action is concerned- one great scene right after another, and the film certainly LOOKS really good.<br /><br />Well, the film does make more sense in its conclusion.  I might give this movie a higher rating the second time I watch it, but as it is, it could have been a classic had some exaggerated scenes never taken place.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DHQ5WO80X1IZ.html">A3DHQ5WO80X1IZ</a><br/><p>Pretty good horror flick based on a Stephen King story. More like 'The Shining' than his later, weak movies. Held together well by a really strong performance from John Cusack as the writer who is trapped in a really evil hotel room. Not usually my kind of movie, and yet I still liked it.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>I'd put off seeing 1408 for a while, namely based on the fact that PG-13 rated horror just doesn't do much for me.  Not to mention that I can't remember the last Stephen King adaptation, except for The Mist, that was actually pretty good.  Well, I'm happy to say I finally gave 1408 a chance, and walked away quite satisfied, especially by the longer director's cut of the film that takes up the second disc of this Two-Disc Collector's Edition.  John Cusack stars as Mike Enslin, a jaded and somewhat haunted author who travels around to supposedly haunted places to debunk their myths.  Upon hearing of the bloody history of the Dolphin Hotel's haunted room 1408, Mike ends up taking it on, despite the warnings of the hotel's manager (Samuel L. Jackson).  Needless to say, Mike gets much more than he bargained for, and it isn't long before he starts becoming a believer.  Directed with efficient dread and perfect pacing by Mikael H?fstr&ouml;m, 1408 is carried by a spectacular performance from Cusack, and some truly scary moments to boot.  And while the theatrical version of the film isn't bad, it's the director's cut with an alternate ending that really deserves your attention, making 1408 one of the better Stephen King adaptations to see the light of day in the past few years.  All in all, if you're in the mood for some great suspense that actually will keep you guessing how it'll all end; 1408 is definitely worth a trip.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>I watched '1408' with my usual low expectations, but I was amazed to find that someone understood what a horror film is supposed to be! Films like this don't come around often, but when they do, you remember how it feels to have chills run down your spine! While not perfect, '1408' delivers in spades what most "horror" films these days lack to their very core. Cusack makes you believe what your experiencing and while the director's cut ending is better, I found the theatrical ending quite chilling too, Both versions are available on the two disc collector's edition which is the edition I recommend. The DVD transfer is excellent and there are some interesting extras included. Imagine,... a horror movie that's actually scary.....what a concept! I think I'll be watching some cartoons before I go to sleep tonight! :-I</p></br><a href="../users/A161ANWB62G3M8.html">A161ANWB62G3M8</a><br/><p>A good Stephen King adaptation can make for a great film and while this is no Shawshank Redemption, it stands as a strong horror movie and one with a very creepy atmosphere and some great, jump in your seats moments.<br /><br />John Cusack's performance holds this film together and he is very impressive as a writer whose job involves exposing haunting as fake. His cynical hack attitude makes the rising tension that much more effective. We see someone doubting his sanity and beliefs as the things he sees appear increasingly impossible.<br /><br />Samuel L Jackson gives strong support as the hotel manager who tries to persuade him against staying in the cursed room. This is a very good shocker, strongly recommended.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1906669023">Sherlock Holmes and the Flying Zombie Death Monkeys</a></p></br><a href="../users/A1GHUN5HXMHZ89.html">A1GHUN5HXMHZ89</a><br/><p>If you enjoy horror movies that are more about a scary atmosphere than seeing people hacked into little pieces with lots of blood splattering all over, you may enjoy this movie. John Cusack turns in a great performance as a author that is in search of haunted places. The movie focuses on what happens in room 1408 at the Dolphin Hotel. Now although you will see some gruesome images, you won't see the typical "Saw sequels" and "Hostel" type gore. I enjoyed this movie for that reason because I have always enjoyed movies that set the proper atmosphere, actually much like the first "Saw", and don't spend all their time trying to be gorier than previous movies. Good quality DVD with decent replayability. If you enjoyed this catch "The Shining", "Secret Window", and "Lost Room". - C.

To me, *1408* is just a movie version of *Tales from the Crypt* or *Amazing Stories*, something like that.<br /><br />Cusack plays Enslin, a doubtful author who visits and publishes books on noted places of paranormal phenomena.  One day, Enslin gets an anonymous postcard about the famed room, 1408, of the Dolphin Hotel in NYC.  Unable to resist the temptation to debunk the hype, Enslin registers for the room.<br /><br />Upon arrival, the hotel manager (Jackson) tries to dissuade Enslin from staying in that room.  Enslin is told of the grisly murders and strange occurrences/histories of room 1408.  However, nothing will prevent Enslin from staying in the room.<br /><br />Upon entrance of 1408, Enslin is in a twilight zone.  Things are what they seemed to be.  Gradually, Enslin starts to believe that paranormal activities are real.  The question is...can Enslin come out of the room alive?<br /><br />I thought *1408* was ok.  It wasn't scary or anything like that.  It was more of illusions or perceptions from Enslin, which could have been scary for him.  However, there was nothing scary for the audience.  There's a little too much talk.  More action, please!</p></br><a href="../users/AVOCNUFOXUCA6.html">AVOCNUFOXUCA6</a><br/><p>Perhaps no author has had so much of his work translated onto the big screen as Stephen King.  And perhaps no author has had those movies turn out so differently - from great classics like "The Shining" on the one hand to bad classics like "Maximum Overdrive" on the other.  "1408" definitely falls onto the "Shining" half of the scales.<br /><br />"1408" is deliberately paced without dragging - a very difficult feat to accomplish.  Even harder to accomplish is making a movie interesting where a long stretch of it is one guy in a room.  It is a testament to John Cusack's acting skills and the director's ability that the times Cusack is in the room are not just interesting, but often gripping.  Lesser talents would have rendered this movie unwatchable.<br /><br />"1408" gives us some reason to care about Cusack such that we care about what he's going through.  And it builds horror through suspense, music and atmosphere, not buckets of blood (not that there's anything wrong with that).  This is old-school horror, not spam-in-a-cabin.  The ending was a bit of a letdown - both versions, even; but honestly, I don't know how you could have ended this movie any differently.<br /><br />If you like horror movies, John Cusack, and/or "The Shining," you will probably enjoy this.  It's at least worth a rent.</p></br><a href="../users/A3STFVPM8NHJ7B.html">A3STFVPM8NHJ7B</a><br/><p>1408 is a great story but dont expect to much horror. Its John Cusack's performance is amazing and its a great look at how people can go mad. Samuel L Jackson has a great part but its a bit part. The movie starts basically with a few little giggles but dont expect to much horror. Its about a man dealing with the lose of his child. I thought the ending was cheap but alas, it wasnt the ending. Id highly recommend this movie. The real ending brought chills up my spine and that is something that never happens.</p></br><a href="../users/A1PL8JA0TEHBVN.html">A1PL8JA0TEHBVN</a><br/><p>John Cusack - a great actor - is very good as the protagonist of this story: an once honest author who now makes up stories about haunted hotels. So he is a non believer... and when faced with a hotel room everybody fears, it is obvious that he knows there's nothing in there except the imagination of those who enter the room.<br /><br />That is a great premise... but here it fails completely because the film does not offer anything interesting, scary or simply offbeat to surprise the audience.<br /><br />It all starts beautifully, as Cusack spends the first few minutes in the room and discovers there is something there that puts chocolate on his bed and replaces toilet paper... and turns on the radio that plays The Carpenters.<br /><br />But that's all... in a few minutes, the room becomes a roller coaster ride... ghosts can be seen jumping out the window... a window closes on Cusack's hand... the key breaks... and soon he discovers he is in one of those places in movies that we hate: a kind of parallel universe where anything goes: it rains... strange noises... it gets too cold... he sees his dead father... he sees his dead daughter... the wall has cracks and drips blood (how unoriginal!)... it snows... the paintings on the wall seem to move... the room gets flooded... the TV shows things... the radio keeps playing while unplugged... etcetera.<br /><br />We've seen it all before and it is all harmless like the haunted house in Disneyland.<br /><br />What I hate the most here is that the horror of this film is just a stupid sequence of idiotic tricks. Look: it's a guy locked in a hotel room for one hour. What fabulous ideas are there that turns this constriction into an advantage? None.<br /><br />Nothing scary here. This is a badly conceived project. Not all horror books can turn into great horror films.</p></br><a href="../users/A18758S1PUYIDT.html">A18758S1PUYIDT</a><br/><p>Very cool special effects and production design here, and John Cusack does his best.  However, it can be hard to translate King's work to the screen and this is an example of that problem.  Samuel Jackson is fine, but his role really could have been played by anyone.  I really couldn't see the point of the whole thing either.  The weak ending certainly does not help.  I'd wait until cheapo day at your local video rental place before getting this one.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ0EO10KTRJ4V.html">AQ0EO10KTRJ4V</a><br/><p>The first 30 minutes of this film set a good dark creepy atmosphere, then just turned silly.<br />The attempts at Scary simply were overdone to the point of becoming comical.<br />My wife was laughing.<br />Cusak's acting was good considering what he had to work with.<br /><br />Stephen King is one of the top horror writers of our generation and deservedly so, but he seems to have his own curse.......... meaning almost every attempt to translate his stories to the big screen fail.<br /><br />The premise of the film was good but it seems they tried too hard to use special effects and eye candy to create terror and thus it lost it's edge and became ho-hum.</p></br><a href="../users/A2D0PJFW2VY8G.html">A2D0PJFW2VY8G</a><br/><p>When it comes to horror, audiences can never get enough of ghosts and haunted houses with the onset of reported paranormal events becoming more common in the last century or so. Mikael Hafstrom's 1408, based on a short story by Stephen King, puts 100+ minutes of horror into the confines of a single hotel room, but is it scary or laughable?<br /><br />Mike Enslin (John Cusack) is a writer that makes a living visiting and reviewing haunted establishments, usually dismissing them as hoaxes. The sceptical Mike learns of a room at the Dolphin Hotel in New York where many visitors have met their deaths. Seeing this as the latest opportunity for a book, Enslin heads for the Dolphin Hotel but is stopped in his tracks by the hotel manager Gerald Olin (Samuel L Jackson) who offers Mike an upgrade to an expensive room, an expensive bottle of cognac and exclusive access to documents related to Room 1408 on the condition the writer doesn't stay in the room. Olin insists no one stays in 1408 anymore and warns that previous victims have not lasted more than an hour but Mike insists he can sue the hotel if they deny him access. Olin reluctantly gives Enslin the keys to 1408 and no sooner has he entered the room than his scepticism is put to the test by a series of horrific events.<br /><br />Being set in one hotel room a lot of the scope in the film is for Cusack to carry this film on his own and he does this well. Olin's warnings about the room he is about to face are very foreboding indeed. 1408 is cleaned irregularly and when it is opened to the cleaning staff, there are two in the room at the same time with Olin supervising them both throughout. This follows an incident where a cleaner got locked in the bathroom and in the short time it took for her to be released she had blinded herself! Enslin's experience of the room begins with the radio coming on but he quickly dismisses this as Olin playing games. Over time the strange events become more frequent with ghostly sightings of previous occupants of the room, the bedside clock switching from the time to a 60 minute countdown, with the feeling that Enslin will not survive to the end of that hour, and later in the film we have ice cold temperatures and the room falling apart all around Enslin. You're not short of supernatural events here.<br /><br />Enslin is a complex character, his dismissal of haunted locations and ghosts likely a result of the massive impact the death of his daughter, Katie (Jasmine Jessica Anthony), has had on him, while his estranged wife, Lily (Mary McCormack), is never far from his mind. As Mike suffers physical and mental torture in Room 1408 what he believes to be hallucinations in the first instance become very real threats and the spirits that occupy the room take on a more personal nature with Katie also appearing to her father. The room is always in control, responding with greater malevolence whenever the sceptical Mike continues to challenge it. What's unclear is why the room is haunted in the first place or why the staff would keep cleaning 1408 when it's not supposed to be open to guests anymore. As the one hour countdown ticks by we are left wondering whether Mike will survive the experience or be driven to suicide or self-harm like previous occupants of the room.<br /><br />1408 has a feel of The Shining but isn't as atmospheric as Kubrick's masterpiece from the eighties. The events will unnerve many and there are one or two moments that will make you jump as well but I was more interested in the character of Mike Enslin and how just a single hour in the room leaves him looking like he's suffered years of torment. 1408 has two endings and it is open to debate which of them is the best. I would favour the one I saw on the UK copy of the film which doesn't end as well for Mike but makes for a more moving experience. Although atmospheric in places I didn't feel uncomfortable in my seat but that didn't stop this being an enjoyable film.<br /><br />1408 is a like a piece of The Shining but on its own is an effective, but by no means, outstanding horror film. Cusack in the lead does a highly commendable job in going mostly solo throughout and by the end you'll be exhausted for him after his experience in 1408. Not particularly scary 1408 is still worth a look, particular for fans of Cusack, Jackson and King.</p></br><a href="../users/A1HMBIRR0RJ1NI.html">A1HMBIRR0RJ1NI</a><br/><p>4 1/2 Stars = Minor Masterpiece<br /><br />Ever wonder what went on in a hotel room before you stayed there?

There's an effectively suspenseful intro into room 1408 with Samuel L Jackson giving stern warnings about entering that room.  Apparently, anyone who enters that room commits suicide, even if they're only there a few minutes.<br />When Mike Enslin (John Cusack) actually does enter the room, the movie picks up steam...turning into a kind of Ghost Hunters t.v. show on crack.<br /><br />However, although there's a creepy vibe and your typical scare tactics, it seemed like this story was going to take a more meaningful turn.  The ghosts and demons that visit Mike are actually ghosts and demons from his painful past.  I even shed a tear, which is an unexpected response for a thriller.  So instead of being like a Ghost Hunters episode, it seemed like it'd be more like a Twilight Zone episode, with a meaningful plot twist at the end.<br /><br />I thought perhaps there'd be a message about letting go of your past or about resisting the temptation to escape, either by drinking or committing suicide.  But instead, the movie ends with a cheap scare.  That's disappointing because it had potential to go much farther than it actually did.</p></br><a href="../users/AB0W9GTNGHSI3.html">AB0W9GTNGHSI3</a><br/><p>ITS STEPHEN KING HELLO!!!

I like "thriller," but in last 25+ years most horror films have been "slasher" - blood, guts, and gore - instead of good, honest, edge of your seat psychological thriller.  1408, however, successfully returns the thriller genre to the big screen.<br /><br />1408 pulls you in quickly and keeps on going.  The pacing is just right.  The intensity of this film is excellently timed, bringing you to your edge of your seat, and then releasing you.  This rollercoaster effect actually increases the "thrill" of the thriller; you do not get numb and disconnected from constant slashing and bashing, fright and horror.<br /><br />The performances are terrific.  John Cusak is great as always. Samuel Jackson is riveting and appropriately spooky.  The little girl, Jasmine Jessica Anthony, is extremely talented.  The rest of the supporting cast does a similarly nice job.<br /><br />As I said, there is very blood, guts, and gore in this film; it is a true thriller.  It is the LACK of said blood, guts, and gore that gives this film its psychological edge, and prevents it from becoming a slash `em up film.<br /><br />I recommend this film.  For a good, old fashioned, yet up to date thriller, 1408 is the movie to see.</p></br><a href="../users/A3B87UZLPCF0HW.html">A3B87UZLPCF0HW</a><br/><p>This movie was made from a short story by Stephen King, 1408 is like a minibar version of Stanley Kubrick's take on The Shining: everything that made that film great has been reduced here into something smaller in scale that's easier to consume but significantly less satisfying. Another film about a writer being driven insane by an evil hotel, it offers a refreshing stop-over for horror fans seeking a rest from the torture porn excesses of Saw and Hostel, yet boasts none of the complexity, the intellectual nourishment or the intense creepiness of Kubrick's thematically similar horror masterpiece.<br />What it does have in its favour is John Cusack.<br />He plays Mike Enslin, a failed novelist who has managed to make a living debunking the presence of ghosts, ghouls and poltergeists in a series of bestselling guidebooks to America's most haunted hotels. His usual trick is to travel to some roadside motel where he'll be eagerly greeted by proprietors ready to regale him with tales of grizzly suicides and malign spirits haunting the rooms. He then tries to settle in for a good night's sleep, after making some effort towards, if not quite professionalism, then at least taking the job half-seriously.<br />This all changes when he receives an anonymous postcard imploring him not to enter room 1408 in Manhattan's upscale Dolphin hotel. His interest suitably piqued, he calls up to reserve the room, only to be told it's unavailable - at all times. With the aid of his publisher's legal team, however, he manages to secure a reservation and flies from his home in California to check in, only to be greeted by the hotel's creepily officious manager, Gerald Olin (Samuel L Jackson), who pleads with him to take an alternative suite.<br />His reasoning is simple---Four people have died horrible deaths under his watch and, in its 95-year existence, a litany of people have lost their lives by torturous means. Nevertheless, Mike is determined to check in and, sensing he's fighting a losing battle, Olin allows him to do so, ominously leaving him at the room's door to face a whole host of personal demons and malevolent spirits.<br />Once he's shut off and isolated in the room, Cusack is also the kind of actor you don't mind spending the majority of a movie with, and he's great when Mike's cynicism gives way to disbelief and outright terror. The film has a few neat touches, too--I won`t give then away....<br />It's too bad the film eventually goes overboard with CGI effects, but heck it kept me interested for a couple of hours.</p></br><a href="../users/A1POFVVXUZR3IQ.html">A1POFVVXUZR3IQ</a><br/><p>1408 is one of the best film adaptations of a Stephen King story, and is highly atmospheric. I too am growing weary of movies masquerading themselves as horror films these days, when all they offer are ludicruous plot lines and excess gore, violence and gratuituous sex.<br /><br />By comparison, 1408 exceeds all expectations when taken for what it is - an intelligent horror movie that despite being rated a tame PG-13 delivers chills, thrills, and a strong performance by its lead actor, John Cusack, as well as a good supporting role by Samuel L Jackson. The story centers around a jaded author, Mike Enslin [John Cusack] who pens 'true horror' books but is actually a skeptic who doesn't believe in the afterworld or entities associated with it. He receives a cryptic postcard one day that tells him 'Do Not Enter 1408' -being a room in the Dolphin Hotel in NY, where Enslin has left behind a painful past.<br /><br />The rest of the movie picks up pace very quickly and viewers are in for a thrill ride as Enslin manages to overcome the protestations of the hotel manager [Samuel Jackson] and spends the night in 1408, which has one of the grisliest & bloody reputations in the annals of hotel history. Enslin finds his skepticism melting in the face of the unbelievable horrors he faces in 1408, and struggles to keep his wits about him to survive.<br /><br />The horror in this movie is very palpable - there is no gore or excess violence, but there's a pervasive sense of menace and evil that sends chills down one's spine, and a couple of jump-out-your-seat moments[not to mention a couple of plot twists]. But what truly lifts this movie is the strong & riveting performance by John Cusack. The whole movie basically revolves around him and it is amazing to watch an actor bring so much depth to his role as well as portray a feeling of alienation, isolation and paranoia as Enslin tries to face his fears in 1408.<br /><br />I am a fan of atmospheric horror movies, and 1408 ranks as one of my favorite horror movies [ The Haunting, Changeling, Rosemary's Baby, The Shining being some of my other favs]. If you're a fan of the horror genre, or simply a fan of psychological drama & thrillers, then 1408 should please you.</p></br><a href="../users/A32K4BV5DFG3KP.html">A32K4BV5DFG3KP</a><br/><p>This film starts off a bit slow, and could have given a bit more of a back story to make the viewer understand about the tragic loss that the main character went through. The main character has become disillusioned with life and no longer thinks that there is any mystery in life. The mind bending qualities of 1408 really creeped me out, in about the same way that "Jacob's Ladder" creeped me out. I think on the undercurrent all people must be horrified of the same thing, the loss of family, your mind, reality itself. There are something's that are worse than death. I think that's what 1408 was about the horror that everyone has in them that people would rather die than face. On my creep meter I give 1408 ten skulls.</p></br><a href="../users/A34D4KCP94ACJZ.html">A34D4KCP94ACJZ</a><br/><p>1408's theatrical cut is just below mediocre but the director's cut is a solid four stars out of five and one of the most effective horror films in the last five to ten years.  So I went with three stars to balance things.  It is amazing that such little changes can have such a dramatic effect on one viewer's perception.  It's a shame that the Weinstein's decided to flub 1408 and give it a sappy and clich&eacute; Hollywood ending rather than the dark and gutsy horror ending that Mikael H?fstr&ouml;m decided to create.  This is the version that you folks in Europe and South American got to see in the theaters.  The director's cut certainly seems to be the real cut, as 1408 seems to move along at its own pace within that version.  It is simply a film about a man who checks into a hotel and we enjoy the suspense build up as the film's main protagonist soldiers forth.  H?fstr&ouml;m clearly knows what he's doing and he is influenced by a bevy of horror's most keenly detailed films, and that is why it is such a shame that his punches are pulled by Dimension Films for the US audience.  His razors are dulled, his poison is given an antidote, and his biggest attack of all is completely de-clawed.  Shame on the Weinsteins and shame on the US audience that always has a hankering for these sappy moments of comforting resolve.  Other than that I have no strong feelings on the matter.<br /><br />The Weinsteins did do one good thing and that is to suggest the casting of the Dolphin Hotel's manager, Mr. Gerald Olin.  He probably should've been played by some little old white guy with a fancy accent, but instead we get the absolutely iconic Samuel L. Jackson.  Jackson is surely one of my favorite actors and it is simply because I enjoy watching him in anything he is in, and 1408 is no exception.  Jackson is like Jack Nicholson, he can play anything but it seems that creeping perpetually underneath every character he plays is a little bit of Sam winking at the audience as if to say "it's me again".  Olin is the formulaic old man who warns the kids not to go into that house or stay at that camp, and no one listens.  The problem is Jackson, as an icon, is traditionally such a great intimadator, but here he is the intimidated and yet he carries the same confidence in 1408 that he carries anywhere else.  He warns ghost skeptic and author Mike Enslin, played by the equally enjoyable John Cusack (if you don't believe me I recommend seeing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013D8LBS">Grace Is Gone</a>) that his quest to find physical or visual validation of the supernatural will end in room 1408 of the Dolphin Hotel, but it will very likely mean the end of Enslin's life as well.  1408 is an extremely evil room.  It would have to be if not even Jackson will go inside.<br /><br />The screenplay is great and it is based on a Stephen King <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0743457358">short story</a> I'm only familiar with by name.  The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000R57T3O">music</a> in this film is outstanding and works the suspense triggers with the pace perfectly.  Enslin is a loner, who the audience will either like or dislike, but his character is very strong and Cusack plays him as if the audience could take him or leave him as a viable hero.  The scenes with Cusack and Jackson together are very enjoyable to watch as the two are such dramatically different actors and their characters are so fundamentally strong and so fundamentally in opposition of each other within the context of this story.  These scenes work to further heighten your curiosity.  What the hell is going on inside room 1408 anyway!?  Don't you worry, the Weinsteins will protect you.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>Mike Enslin (John Cusack) writes books about haunted places.

He calls to make a reservation and the room seems to be permanently booked. All of this naturally piques the interest of the disbeliever. He talks to his publisher (Tony Shalhoub) and the publisher's lawyer agrees to help. When Mike arrives, the manager, Gerald Olin (Samuel L. Jackson) tries to bribe, plead, threaten, scare and entice Mike to cancel his planned stay in room 1408. "That room is evil" he tells the writer. "No one has stayed in there for more than an hour." Mike won't have any of it and heads upstairs. As soon as he is in the room, Mike starts dictating his thoughts and notes for the book. Then, some strange things start to happen.<br /><br />"1408" is based on a Stephen King short story and it does something that few `horror' films do today. It is actually scary. The current trend in horror films, thrillers, what ever word you want to use to classify them, is to make them as gory and bloody as possible. "1408" builds a fair amount of psychological horror, scares that occur in Mike's mind, allowing our thoughts to fill in the details. This type of horror is always more scary than simply watching a bunch of knives, some blood, gory murders, the like.<br /><br />Director Mikael Hafstrom, whose last film was my least favorite film of 2005, "Derailed", does a really good job of establishing Mike's character, his background, his current animosity towards his line of work, everything that would make him a skeptic. So when Mike enters room 1408, we almost believe what he believes, that he won't see anything, nothing will happen.<br /><br />But then, there would be no need to pay $11 to see a movie called "1408" if that were the case, right?<br /><br />The screenwriters, Mike Greenberg and Scott Alexander (Alexander worked on the screenplays for "The People Vs. Larry Flynt" and "Man on the Moon" among others) deserve credit for adapting the short story by Stephen King into a fairly well rounded feature length film. They add a lot of back story for Mike, help establish his skepticism by showing us a visit he makes to another haunted inn, and much more. They have filled in a lot of the details King only hinted at in the original story.<br /><br />This is basically John Cusack's film. There are brief moments with Samuel L. Jackson, Tony Shalhoub, Mary McCormack and others, but once Cusack's Mike enters that room, everything is about what happens to his character and what his character does in response.<br /><br />So it is important for the details of Mike's character to be established ahead of time. Hafstrom and the screenwriters have done a lot of this work, but without Cusack's performance, the film would fail.<br /><br />Let's talk about John Cusack for a moment. Cusack is a remarkably underrated actor. Not an A-lister, he is, nonetheless, remarkably good. Sure, he has his share of missteps ("Must Love Dogs", "The Ice Harvest" anyone?) but when he is in a film, I can almost always count on at least an interesting film which has been elevated by his performance. Yet in most of his films, Cusack's performance adds significantly to the overall quality of the film, delivering some quirky, excellent, memorable films. "Grosse Point Blank", "High Fidelity", "Say Anything", "Being John Malkovich" all contain a unique, quirky performance from Cusack that helps to elevate the film.<br /><br />In "1408", Cusack plays Mike Enslin, a writer of books about haunted places. Throughout the film, we get further hints about Mike's past, his dreams, his failures, and these all help to contribute to his character. These moments aren't superfluous; they all mean something and add to the horror he later experiences. For instance, Mike doesn't really believe in haunted places, but the books he writes pay the bills, so he feigns interest and belief. Also, he once had dreams of being a great writer, and is surprised when a woman comes to a book signing with his lone fiction title, a much dog eared paperback that she wants him to autograph. The book's appearance is like a knife in his heart.<br /><br />But the most important part of his past lies in his relationship with his ex-wife and daughter. Naturally, when an evil spirit is trying to drive someone mad, they will use the most precious memories that person holds dear to aid in the process. And evil, evil room 1408 is no exception. It knows all about Mike's past and uses this information to drive the skeptic over the edge.<br /><br />Samuel L. Jackson is very good as Gerald Olin. He seems to genuinely care about Mike's welfare and doesn't want him to stay in the room. But the role is very small and the filmmakers do themselves an injustice by listing Jackson as one of the stars of the film. His role is really a cameo and if it had been billed as such, his appearance would help provide a nice little boost to the film.<br /><br />If you are familiar with Stephen King's writing, he has written many short stories about things becoming possessed by evil spirits and haunting `reg'lar' folks. Dogs, classic cars, cats, toys, the like. Many of these stretch the credibility factor, but still remain very watch able. In "1408", a hotel room is possessed by evil spirits. And you know, it works. Because the film takes some time to set up Mike's skepticism towards haunted places, he enters the room a disbeliever. Since we are living this story through Mike, we also enter the room a disbeliever. Once he begins to experience the various freakish things, we feel the freakish things.<br /><br />Virtually all of the horror in "1408" is derived from events or circumstances in Mike's life. And this makes the film all the creepier because it is slightly more believable. I can't really believe I am using this word when discussing a film about an evil hotel room, but there you have it. The film is believable for long stretches of time because we believe in Mike, and John Cusack's portrayal of the character. In fact, the film has very little blood or gore; there are a couple of shots of some of the other people who have died in the room but most of these are in black and white. And this is such a welcome change of pace from the current `norm'.<br /><br />"1408" was a big surprise.</p></br><a href="../users/A139ZF7CJVVTJU.html">A139ZF7CJVVTJU</a><br/><p>Stephen King's a decent writer.  His record speaks for itself.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0451188462">Sometimes</a> he can be brilliant.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0451169514">Other</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0453007449">times</a> (and this is more often the case), he starts off with a captivating idea, but never seems able to wrap things up with equal captivation.  And then there are <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0525941908">the moments</a> where he's way off the map in all directions.  It's no biggy, considering how prolific his career has been.<br /><br />"1408" was a short story of his that was meant to be more of a creative exercise than anything else.  I've never thought King was much of a short story writer -- his imagination needs room to stretch; "1408" the story isn't so bad, but I remember wondering how on earth they planned to stretch it out to movie-length.  The writer in King's tale isn't in the deadly room for ten minutes before the story comes to a close.<br /><br />It's hard to tell how long Cusak's Mike Enslin ends up in the room.  An hour at least.  The hotel room's powers make it hard to trust one's perceptions.  In fact, the whole of its horror is all about twisted perceptions, and therein lies the flaws of "1408."<br /><br />Enslin is a hack writer (once talented and profound) who makes a living by exploiting areas that are supposedly haunted.  Due to a personal tragedy, Enslin is dead-set against belief in any kind of spirit world, making him both a hack and a hypocrite.  It isn't long after he's shut the door of "1408" behind him that his beliefs are tested by the room's weird, ambient horror.<br /><br />Well, it's not exactly horrific.  King comes up with scary images, but without any supporting substance, they're really nothing more than images.  Bleeding walls.  Paintings with changing pictures.  Menacing spirits that appear and disappear.  Sure, it's creepy, but what's there to it?  As far as "1408" is concerned, there's only one goal: to drive Mr. Enslin mad enough to end his own life.<br /><br />Cusak bears the lion's share of what makes the movie worth watching at all (Samuel Jackson is the other name of note, but all he does as far as this film is concerned is chew on both cigars and scenery).  Enslin's history with his wife and daughter, added for the film, make his experiences noteworthy, although not terribly frightening.  You want him to get out of the hotel, but the room's machinations are just a series of mental tricks.  Psychological horror is what it wants to be; random oddities is what it turns into.<br /><br />King's stories, as far as their successes and failures go, are less about execution and mostly about the concepts that drive them.  "1408" struggles with both.  Cusak keeps things fresh and interesting, but I can't say the same for the hotel room in which he struggles to survive.</p></br><a href="../users/A18G7GG53G2X8A.html">A18G7GG53G2X8A</a><br/><p>In a Haunted Hotel story, it always starts with a warning: Don't stay in that one room. It's haunted. It's evil. Such is the way that "1408" starts, an opening that inevitably leads to a series of nightmarish supernatural occurrences. But rather than bombarding the audience with cliched images of ghosts and monsters, the film effectively gets under the audience's skin by adding uncomfortable subtleties. Example: there's a moment when John Cusack passes a painting while in room 1408. He sees that it's slightly crooked. It wasn't like that when he first entered the room. Moments such as these build up as the film advances, resulting in a story that doesn't shock so much as it unnerves. In short, this is a film that takes us on one heck of a ride.<br /><br />And no wonder; it's based on the short story by Stephen King. In the collection "Everything's Eventual," he introduces "1408" by saying, "hotel rooms are just naturally creepy places, don't you think? I mean, how many people have slept in that bed before you? How many of them were sick? How many were losing their minds?" I must admit that I don't put much thought into hotel rooms. Still, such unpleasant ideas ring true. The filmmakers must have known this; those very words were used as dialogue for Cusack's character Mike Enslin, a man who makes his living writing about reputedly haunted locations. Following the death of his daughter, he no longer believes in anything, least of all in ghosts. When he learns of New York City's Dolphin Hotel and the history behind room 1408 (whose digits add up to thirteen), he only sees it as an opportunity to add material to his next book. He intends to stay overnight.<br /><br />The manager of the hotel--Gerald Olin (Samuel L. Jackson)--desperately tries to talk Enslin out of it, as such characters do in such stories. Room 1408 has been associated with many deaths during the Dolphin's ninety-plus year history: there was the sewing machine salesman that slit his own throat; there was the man that drowned in a bowl of soup; there was the woman that jumped from the room's window. Today, no one stays in room 1408. The only people who enter it are the maids, who give the room a very quick turn every month. The sheets are changed. The towels are replaced. The light bulbs are fixed. According to Olin, it's similar to holding your breath in a room filled with poison gas: everything has to be done quickly. This is because no one who stays in that room will last for more than an hour. Something is in that room. Not a ghost, but definitely something.<br /><br />Enslin listens but refuses to reconsider. He sees Olin's words as nothing more than scare tactics, a way to drum up publicity for the hotel. Olin insists that he's being quite serious. Whatever the case, Enslin eventually receives the key to room 1408, an old-fashioned metal key that fits into an old-fashioned lock (the hotel has upgraded to magnetic cards, but according to Olin, nothing electronic will work in 1408). The room is located on the fourteenth floor ... but actually, it isn't. During the elevator ride, Enslin notices that the floor numbers go from twelve directly to fourteen; apparently, a thirteenth floor is highly frowned upon in many hotels. Either way, Enslin enters room 1408.<br /><br />Thus begins a highly intense, horrific journey, highlighted by unexplainable occurrences, terrifying images, and otherworldly encounters. I won't bother describing them in detail: for one thing, it would be difficult to do so; for another thing, you really should experience this film for yourself. Let's be incredibly vague and say that many strange and frightening things happen, all of which force Enslin to reexamine his state of mind. For the horror movie aficionado, this film is delightfully unsettling, filled to the brim with pop out scares, spooky sounds, and startling twists of fate. At the same time, it utilizes smaller, quieter moments, such as when Enslin bathes the room in ultraviolet light, exposing large areas that were once covered with blood. In the hands of a lesser director, all this could have amounted to mere shock value, great to look at but lacking any substance.<br /><br />Luckily, there's genuine imagination at work in "1408," so much so that it begins to get overwhelming. But that's how it should be; Enslin is learning the hard way, and the audience needs to be aware of this. Ultimately, I felt the same way leaving the theater as I did when finishing King's original story: thrilled. It doesn't matter that this film adaptation isn't completely faithful to its source; the story served more as a springboard than a strict guideline, allowing for many ideas to be expanded and solidified. When Cusack's strong performance is added to the mix, it gets even better; for most of the film, he had to act while alone in a hotel room, surrounded by a wealth of special effects. Nonetheless, he shows terrific range, relying on an emotional gamut that's just as convincing as it is intense.<br /><br />"1408" is one of the better Stephen King adaptations of recent memory, a carefully crafted fright fest that knows how to make the audience uncomfortable. It's engaging, exciting, and genuinely terrifying, perfect for anyone in need of a good scare.</p></br><a href="../users/AUM3YMZ0YRJE0.html">AUM3YMZ0YRJE0</a><br/><p>This film is OK:  there is a mystery, strange things happen with psychological realism, but you never lose your sense that it will be over in about 1.5 hours and the guy will survive it or not.  This is King's stock and trade and he does it extremely well, but after seeing the same kind of stuff for 30 years, I for one am yearning for something new, something that enters my imagination or fascinates (like, say, Polanski's Ninth Gate).  This most emphatically fails on the originality score, however strong Jackson and Cusack are, for they are truly fine actors.<br /><br />Recommended tepidly as background noise time waster.</p></br><a href="../users/AK1OBVI54SY73.html">AK1OBVI54SY73</a><br/><p>Nowadays it seems horror movies are either too tame to even be scary- and you're just eventually bored, or they are just filled with so much gore you are not scared- but just disgusted. I have grown bitter with horror films these days, but still hold on to hope at least once a year there will be one good one that comes out, which usually there is. 1408 is indeed, for me, this years one.<br /><br />It's not like it is without flaws, but the strengths in the film outweigh them. Cusack, for one, I think did just a great job with his role. Jackson was not in the movie too much so I guess he did fine with the little time he was on. The pacing and build up throughout the film I agree with the majority on, very well done. King always had a great way of building up suspense and he does not fail in this story either. He also does not fail to tug on the heartstrings as we eventually figure out why Enslin is the way he is- bitter, detached, etc.<br /><br />What I love most though is the lack of gore. I am not saying there should be none, but nowadays we are so incredibly filled to the brim with gore from so many other horror films, that watching one that really cuts back is just so refreshing. And also 1408 proves you do not need massive amounts of gore to have a movie creep you out. It's really a solid thriller throughout that at least kept me watching till the end.<br /><br />The only real problem I had in the film were the special effects. They were good enough, but I was expecting the effects to be a bit more impressive than they were. Also overall, after being a King fan for a long time, I have to admit 1408 does not measure up quite where many of King's other more heavyweight stories in the past did. Nonetheless, this is actually only a short story by King, and it really has made a successful step to film.<br /><br />I highly recommend this for a good, old- fashioned scare. King does not disappoint.<br /><br />4/5</p></br><a href="../users/AYWSFRCIMOAYE.html">AYWSFRCIMOAYE</a><br/><p>There is very little suspense in this movie. One of the scary scene was when the old lady walked from inside a wall to the window and fell out in to the street. She silently disappeared when hitting the street.<br />Another one when John Cusack dropped the bed lamp to the street from his 14th floor suite to see if he's hallucinating. The lamp hit the street without making any nose. Then it disappeared. Meanwhile, John could hear people talking and car honking from the street.<br /><br />Most of  the other scenes have been done in other horror movies before. For example, the door automatically locked him up. He could not open it etc. The special effects look fake.<br /><br />The worst thing about this story is that at the end it suggested all John Cussack experienced was caused by his imagination! It's because nobody else saw anything. The room was perfectly in tact after John was rescued. How scary it was!<br /><br />This movie is worth renting not buying.<br /><br />"28 days later" is still on the top of my list of Horror Movies.</p></br><a href="../users/AAU7CAQIN5BAE.html">AAU7CAQIN5BAE</a><br/><p>In some not so impressive saga, I find myself more and more, on through the years, comparing everything even remotely scary or jaded or creepy or thrillerlike to Silence of The Lambs. Yeah, that is my own innner child screaming for some innate understanding of the particulars of a movie, as opposed to blanket generalities, and for a lax reviewer I suppose that is a bias. Well so be it. The only saving grace in the movie was when Cusack, who is bland, detached and feverishly boring, orders a double Patron chilled. High fives on the couch abounded after that remark.<br /><br />Samuel L. Jackson. Tsk, tsk, tsk. How painful to watch him in anything. If he ever did anything good, it was because the people that he was sharing the screen with had the talent. He just shined off them. Go ahead and think about it. If his performances in the Star Wars films wasn't enough to send him a check to personally have him never to appear on the big screen again, we have this ersatz for talent appearing as a hotel manager, who is not in the least disturbingly scary. One would think, save wooden and pretentiously arrogant in most roles, he would have made the viewer all the more wary of having Cusak's character actually enter 1408. I mean there is this huge set up now about not entering the room, that charge that a REALLY REALLY good director, like well ya know, DePalma, Kubrick, Demme, would have made tres important, so that myself, and perhaps others, could really get the hairs on our arms doing backflips in anticipation of the horrors that await. He (Jackson) sounded like a Port Authority voice on the PA System. Mundane, reciting and ordinary.

Ignoring that, Cusack plays Mike Enslin, a writer of books about haunted houses, inns, and amusement parks (I made that last part up for Scooby Doo fans).  Enslin gets a barrage of brochures, letters, and emails from people who want him to feature their own haunting.  Every single time Enslin goes in, the haunting is bogus, and the owners get their free publicity in the new Enslin book.  This all changes with one notification...<br /><br />Samuel L. Jackson plays a dignified manager at an upscale, posh hotel in New York that just happens to have the most haunted room in history.  Room 1408 has had 56 deaths to date, and despite the room's reputation, the hotel is very expensive and busy.  Ignoring that perplexing contradiction, Samuel L. Jackson delivers as he always does, and keeps his career-long streak of dropping the F-bomb alive.<br /><br />What transpires is a reversal of Enslin's cynicism and doubt, as he realizes that all the previous debunking he has done at other rooms doesn't help him at all in 1408.  It's basically a hotel room taking on a life of its own - think Event Horizon on the 14th floor - and doing everything possible to scare Enslin senseless, and possibly lead to his death.</p></br><a href="../users/A18MBO1U4DPY20.html">A18MBO1U4DPY20</a><br/><p>In 1408, we have with us an author of cheap scare books. Even though he thinks his profession is rather respectable, one always feels John Cusack is being bit of weasel towards the beginning. His overconfidence soon turns into resentment. There were maybe three scenes in the film that I found quite scary. I loved the helplessness his character is made to feel but I also hated it because it was a bit too much like a bad dream and after a while if you're watching this on DVD, you will feel like looking at your watch. I'd say it's a 6.5/10. Mr. Jackson has no role in the film, he's just on the cover.<br /><br />The film's weakness lies in the fact that it had no answers to the problem it creates in itself. There was no moral conclusion it seemed to draw. It was meant to scare and bruise one's conscience but you definitely wouldn't think of this film unless asked to name one of the scariest films of the year, 2007.

He actually stays in the room expecting it to be not that bad since he has stayed at haunted places in the past. Samuel L. Jackson is great as the motel manager eventhough he's short and white in the short story I think but while reading it, I pictured Samuel L. Jackson anyway. Samuel L. Jackson adds more humor and sarcasm to the part though. Anyway he's both creepy and funny in the small part as he practically begs Cusack not to stay in 1408 adding some hilarious Samuel L. Jackson style curse words. Soon after arriving in 1408 Cusack realizes that 1408 is the real deal and as much as he'd like to leave the room won't let him.<br /><br />  The ghosts in 1408 can look like prejections from the Haunted House in Disney World, so they aren't that scary. But there's still pleanty of moments in the movie that will make you jump. The movie is also very entertaining but mostly due to the great work from John Cusack. He can make you laugh pleanty of times but the movie can also have it's emotional scenes which he handles fine as well. I admit there's a scene at the end where he had me close to tears. Despite some scares, the movie really wouldn't have been as good without him.<br /><br />  Even if you read the story, there's no one else you can picture who's as perfect for the part. If you're not sure what Stephen King book you can find the story in, it's in Everything's Eventual by the way. I still have to finish it, I started reading this week before I saw the movie. I'll have to see if the ending is the same but here I really liked it a lot. The movie is worth checking out, that is if you're not expecting a whole lot of blood and guts and just want to see a movie with a good story.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CLHLW9PFKG9Q.html">A1CLHLW9PFKG9Q</a><br/><p>Just finished watching 1408 and I have to add this to the "Movies Based on a Stephen King Story that Flopped at the End" pile. The movie stars John Cusack as a paranormal horror author Mike Enslin. He writes books along the lines of "10 Haunted Hotel Rooms" and other haunted places. He doesn't believe in ghosts nor does he believe in God because of the death of his daughter. ("How could God allow my daughter to die" kind of thing)<br /><br />Enslin receives a postcard warning him not to enter room 1408 of the Dolphin hotel in New York City. The hotel manager, Mr. Olin, played by Samuel L. Jackson gives him a long list of people who have died in that room. One maid was stuck in the bathroom for only a moment and had become blind. When asked about the spirits or ghosts of the room, Mr Olin tells Enslin, "It's just evil."<br /><br />Scary things happen near the beginning of Enslin's stay, I'll give it that. I was on the edge of my seat once he entered the room. He's given an hour to live. Olin warns him, "No one has survived longer than an hour." The clock beside the bed ticks off the seconds. Unfortunately, as the clock nears 00:00:00, I went from thinking, "What in the world is this?!?" to "Just finish this trash already".<br /><br />1408 had so much promise. It could have been a terrific horror movie if done properly. It could have been done in a way that scared the living daylights out of you, while giving you ideas to think about. Instead the story became lame and the direction was pathetic.

This is all due to then fine acting provided by John Cusack, who must carry the movie all by himself for the majority of the film's running time.  Jackson is good in his small role as the hotel's manager, but this is Cusack's movie.  Based on the short story by Stephen King, this film is easily one of the best based on King's work.  I highly recommend this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A355WMP0CQBJFX.html">A355WMP0CQBJFX</a><br/><p>horror movies are my cup of tea, and this one was just another to satisfy my cravings. of course there are many ways to describe "horror" movies. you have some mystery, some gorefest, some for the mind, and some funny. it all depends on what you like. theres plenty to choose from. well this is one of the good ones for me. it's a bit creepy, a bit spooky, and some psychological stuff. well alot of it. this guy whos never been scared ends up getting the worst scare of his life, and his life is just hanging in the balance. he's lived through a tough ordeal, and now although he doesn't know it he goes into this hotel room 1408, and it just doesn't get any easier. very paced and well thought out. it's not about ghosts jumping out of the closet, or the boogeyman under the bed, or anybodies guts hanging out. it's about all your worst nightmares all in one coming at you. can you survive. there's only one way to get out. just kill yourself any way you'd like. nicely done, and stephen king succeeds once again. brilliant man. john cusack one of the good actors. he does it the way he should. his performance is one of his best. as for samuel l. jackson, the man is great. usually his roles are brief, but play an important role, that you don't forget. the movie as a whole could have been better, but i guess they all can. great mind, good movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A14Q6R4481YFFG.html">A14Q6R4481YFFG</a><br/><p>In many ways 1408 reminds me of 1997's "The Game," the Michael Douglas psychological thriller.  In both cases, the movies' writers try to cram a maximum number of head fakes into as short amount of time as possible. The two films also put forth the very implausible idea that if you manipulate a person's mind enough, and mentally break him, that somehow that's going to heal him, or at least begin the process of healing.  Count me as skeptical on that one.<br /><br />The two movies do differ on the source of their protagonists' psychological and physical torture.  While The Game tries to make a non-supernatural case for psychotic manipulation, 1408 just presents the supernatural as fact.  In 1408, causes and motives for the supernatural events are irrelevant, with the minor implication, as presented by Samuel L. Jackson in a refrigerator of all places, that the people who stay in the inhospitable room are somehow guilty of bringing their doom upon themselves.<br /><br />The DVD provides alternative endings to the movie release.  They're just as good in their own ways as the theatrical ending, which has the more palatable theme of restoration, rather than martyrdom.  Choose whichever ending suits your predilections.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZLROGIL2V7GV.html">A2ZLROGIL2V7GV</a><br/><p>It is extremely refreshing to finally see a "true" horror movie that doesn't go for shock value.  All of the horror movies that come out now only deal with a lot of blood, guts and torturing.  Not knocking that type of movies, but it gets tiring when it's the same thing over and over again.  With "1408," you are given a truly creepy movie that gets into your head, as well as in your soul.  The premise at a glance seems simple and even risks being overly ridiculous if not handled with the greatest of care.<br /><br />Mike Enslin is a writer who likes to take his accounts of so-called "haunted" areas and sell them to the public in his books, however if you really know the man you know that he really doesn't believe in anything.  Still, there is something that drives him to go to each place that claims to be haunted to see if he can have some sort of proof that there is something more to what we simply see everyday.  He gets a postcard from the Dolphin Hotel and on the back it warns him specifically not to go into Room 1408.  Of course, this makes Mike all the more curious, so he sets his sight onto the room.  Not even the manager of the hotel can steer him away with his warnings, as Mike himself says to the manager that he doesn't believe in ghosts or monsters, and even if they did exist that there was no God to protect them from such horrors.  The manager allows Mike to stay in the room after seeing there is no way to tell him otherwise.  What Mike will witness during his stay is the things that nightmares are made of, and it will dish out every single fear he has ever had along with forcing him to revisit a horrible personal tragedy and get to the very bottom of his soul.<br /><br />"1408" not only is a well-made horror movie, but it's also an excellent film over all.  This is a movie that goes to places that a lot of the new horror movies don't go.  The movie is not afraid to get personal and deep while still giving you great scares.  There are times that you may find yourself jumping here and there, but the scare factor is mostly psychological and it'll make you feel uncomfortable in your seat.  You don't have to scream aloud to be frightened.  It's a scream that you keep inside of yourself and take with you when you go to bed, and it lingers in your head no matter how many times you try to shake it off.<br /><br />There are two things that make this movie a success; 1) John Cusack is phenomenal, and dare I say this might be one of his best performances ever, and that is nothing easy considering the fact that he's solo in 90% of the movie.  He has great range as an actor, and this movie showcases all of his emotions and you really feel for him and grow to love him.  2) The emotional human side of the film that's very realistic.  Even though it's been said in reviews and the trailer, I don't want to give it away.  You'll understand when you watch the movie.  These are the two important factors that make the movie work and keep it from being a "goofy horror" flick.<br /><br />The 2-Disc "Collector's Edition" contains some behind the scenes features, both the theatrical and an "Extended Director's Cut" and commentary on the "Director's Cut" version of the film.  I've seen both and I personally prefer the theatrical cut, but it was interesting to see the other version.  In fact, the director, as much as he loves some of the extended scenes and the "alternate ending" that's featured in the "Director's Cut," admits to being very happy with the theatrical version and understanding why some things were better left out or changed (this found on the commentary track with him and the writers).  The ending in the other version is very different from the theatrical, but again I have to say I prefer the version I originally saw the first time.  If you go with the 2-Disc edition, you can view for yourself and see which one you like better.<br /><br />"1408" is one of the few new horror movies that really made an impact on me, and it's a trip worth taking.  It's not one that everyone will like, and some people may not be able to handle some of the dark and depressing themes that the movie ventures into, but if you're sick of the torture flicks and want to see a genuinely creepy movie that'll stay with you, then I highly recommend checking it out.  Definitely goes down as one of my favorite movies of the year. -Michael Crane</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDNTB7377YH2.html">A1CDNTB7377YH2</a><br/><p>I was pleasantly surprised or should I say scared by this incredibly creepy film!  This is one of the best screen adaptations of a King novel to a movie since The Shining.<br /><br />John Cusak is a myth debunker who spends the night at places that are reputedly haunted and then writes books about his non-eventful night.  He is warned not to stay in room 1408 at the New York Dophin.  Of course he then insists on staying there and no amount of persuasion can stop him.  Even documented records of 54 deaths in the room don't phase him.<br /><br />During his time there it is bone-chilling horror that may claim his inner soul.  Along the way he re-examines his relationships with his father and his daughter who are both dead.</p></br><a href="../users/A33CLVW2K7SL1P.html">A33CLVW2K7SL1P</a><br/><p>I must not "get" Stephen King. I rarely like any of the movies made from his books (Misery is an exception), and have only truly been satisfied from his shorter works, of which The Shawshank Redemption and Stand By Me are perfect examples.<br /><br />1408 - hasn't it's premise been done to death? A strange hotel with a stranger general manager, a haunted room, mysterious ghosts and figures appearing and disappearing, rarely in a pattern that makes sense? Yeah, it has. And all of the good acting and top-notch special effects end up being nothing more than cheap window dressing, and window dressing has never saved a film.<br /><br />It's probably true that there are no more original stories to be told, but I need a more distinctive stamp of novelty before I'll buy into listening to, reading, or watching another take an age old concept.<br /><br />The ending was supposed to be shocking. Really? It was as predictable as an ending can be. Although I should admit that I kept expecting aliens to pop out of nowhere and take credit for the haunting. But he's done that, already, in how many movies?<br /><br />I have to admit that I feel strange criticizing the work of a man who has written more books than I could contemplate writing, but in his book On Writing, King said that he essentially follows tangents and lets them lead him through his work. It's a formula that has sold tens, if not hundreds of millions of books for him, but not a formula that any student of writing should consider. To blindly follow a tangent without stopping to ask yourself questions like "Does this make sense?" can only lead to ruin.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>"1408" aspires to be a latter day "The Shining".  It doesn't reach the level that Stanley Kubrick did but it offers enough chills for the buck.  Where Kubrick utilized a snowbound resort hotel to ratchet dread and claustrophobia, here a mundane hotel room serves the same purpose.  There is a certain supernatural element to the room's objects but the biggest boogeyman in the room is the human psyche.  It was a stroke of genius to cast John Cusack as the room's intended victim.  Cusack is an understated actor who rarely gives in to histrionics.  If Cusack can go bonkers than something truly evil is afoot.  Not classic King but more than passable Halloween fare.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER5AYS3FQ9O3.html">A1ER5AYS3FQ9O3</a><br/><p>First of all, I have to confess I'll see nearly  ANY movie with John Cusack in it. I'm not sure what it is about him as an actor that holds my attention but after seeing him in a wide range of films, I find his versatiliy, his ability to play a broad spectrum of characters and to keep  pushing the envelope and explore new territory to be intriguing. Don't get me wrong - I don't have a crush on him. He's an actor. I'm a reviewer - don't know the guy.<br /><br />Now, ABOUT THIS MOVIE. I read the short story in King's collection and have to say that the movie takes lots of creative liberties but that's fine by me. It holds true to the essence of the story. I happen to like this in book form better but that is because it's taut and doesn't waste words. Besides, it is easier to linger on a certain passage, until it is seared into the imagination.<br /><br />  Still, the movie has its fine points as well. As mentioned before, there is John Cusack, who definitely comes across as a skeptical writer who becomes genuinely spooked by his experiences in Room 1408. His acting is as interesting as usual, pulling out all the stops, with those quirky facial movements that can suggest so much about a character without saying a word.<br /><br />I found the special effects to be less impressive and the movie seemed to go on forever. But that's my main problem with adaptations of King books to screen. Sometimes they work beautifully and other times they fall flat. I think this one is somewhere in the middle.</p></br><a href="../users/A36EW68H08UOCS.html">A36EW68H08UOCS</a><br/><p>The modern "horror" film has degenerated into genre of "dead teenager" films - where attractive young people run into some "unspeakable evil" person(s) who spends the rest of the film maiming the attractive young people and the "gotcha" movie set in a haunted place and characterized by the sudden appearance of a ghoul (or cat...) punctuated by a sudden chord on the soundtrack.<br /><br />Not that long ago "horror" works (written and on film) used the audience's own imagination to get under your skin.

Mike Enslin is a published, but not on the King/Rowling circuit, writer.  He travels between "haunted" places and bookstores, debunking the "haunted" places, but writing about them in his books.

John Cusack does a credible job as the protagonist Mike Enslin, a cynical writer of non-fiction books who visits allegedly spooky places to debunk their claims of ghostly specters.  Against the advice of the hotel manager (Samuel L. Jackson), Enslin visits a supposedly haunted room in the Dolphin Hotel in New York City, insisting on staying in Room 1408, the locus of many a tragic event.  He finds that painful memories flood his mind as he descends progressively into the grip of the hotel's malevolent power.  The special effects are spooky and just short of over the top.<br /><br />Some viewers may criticize the film's lack of realism, most notably the ability of anyone other than a rock star or royalty to get a hotel room this large in New York City.  More likely you get a room so small that you have to step outside just to change your mind.  But what can you expect for a mere $617.00 a night in Gotham, the City that Never Sleeps?<br /><br />Or talk about scary -- $12 for a 4-oz. tin of honey roasted peanuts in the Honor Bar?  Frightening!!<br /><br />1408 is an effective fright charge likely to ignite shudders for those who like spooky movies, almost as scary as trying to find an economical hotel room in NYC!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>One of my friends is a huge fan of the recent onslaught of horror films: namely those that center on gore (Saw, Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake and prequel) or those that center on 10 jump scenes meant to scare you out of your seat but really show the story didn't have bite in the first place and needed those jumps. But as bad as he's been getting, Stephen King can come up with a few effective books which turn out to be either really great (The Shining, The Green Mile), manageable (The Langoliers) or just simply awful (Dreamcatcher). 1408 may not be the best adaptation of one of his films but it's certainly the best in awhile.<br /><br />Michael Enslin is a writer who specializes in the most haunted places in America. Well at least if they were actually haunted since a lot of them have been disappointing and he's been growing increasingly cynical. But a curious postcard about the Dolphin Hotel in New York with the phrase "Don't Enter 1408" appears. This sparks his interest and despite the continued warnings from the hotel manager,Gerald Olin, he checks in. What initially begins as disbelief soon grows into a fear that the room may in fact be real.<br /><br />A lot of horror movies are based on the idea that you're not safe as long as the film's on and with good use of atmosphere and tension, the film just might make you lose sleep. However, films lately are built around the idea that seeing entrails and "chunky goodness" is meant to scare you. Well it doesn't, it disgusts so it's with welcome that 1408 doesn't follow this route. Well there's only so much scary stuff to go around but it's a good use of letting the viewer feel uneasy. It also helps that we never leave the main character to sort of deflate everything which is a big plus.<br /><br />But that means that main character better be awesome right? Well how can you expect less from John Cusack, one of the more reliable actors right now. He's always been great and here he shines as well, showing the cynicism, shock and tortured past that the character has without it feeling hammy or "actor"-ish. The other main character is obviously Samuel L. Jackson (since he's on the cover, naturally) and Sam's always good but here he doesn't have much to do except for telling us how evil the room is. We also have Mary McCormack and Tony Shalhoub with only Mary being anything close to a full character.<br /><br />With the Mist coming from Green Mile director and Cell from Hostel director Eli Roth (ugh) coming, it seems either people are seeing how effective a Stephen King story can be under a good director it's just simply the thing to do lately but luckily 1408 is as good a horror film out this year as any.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MYUI8IT6UBUU.html">A2MYUI8IT6UBUU</a><br/><p>Treading the familiar Stephen King territory of a writer thrown into the horrors of supernatural chaos, 1408 is more Shining than Misery, but Cusack retains the redeeming pathos-inducing personality of the latter's troubled novelist. Choosing to use atmosphere and mood over blood and guts to increase suspense, Mikael Hafstrom's thriller admirably shies away from cheap scares and ghostly Ring-like little girls to slowly build a searing psychological terror where the audience might lose their cool before Cusack's character does.<br /><br />Mike Enslin's (John Cusack) tragic past provokes him to seek out the most notorious of haunted houses and other typical phantom hangouts and debunk the existence of such afterlife entities. After writing several less-than-successful "top 10" haunted locale books, Enslin happens upon a postcard warning to stay away from room 1408 in New York's Dolphin Hotel. Unable to resist, Enslin insists upon staying in the "evil" room that has claimed 56 lives and boasts a foreboding one-hour maximum life expectancy for its occupants. Ignoring the pleads of the Dolphin's manager (Samuel L. Jackson), Enslin embarks on a nightmarish night of supernatural torment where he must battle impending psychosis, paranormal devilry, and his own inner demons... and he may not last ten minutes let alone one hour.<br /><br />Perhaps its greatest accomplishment, 1408's emphasis on atmosphere and setting over blood packets and gore effects keeps it refreshingly new though its premise dabbles in the horror stories of old. Those expecting the elaborately grotesque tortures of Saw and Hostel may be disappointed in the psychological terrors that reign supreme in this haunted hotel room, but just as effective (if not more so) is the steady building of unbearable torment on Mike Enslin's rapidly crumbling psyche. And through his faltering rationalizations, we too begin to lose our calm. Once the mysterious happenings transform into supernatural disturbances, the likes of which Enslin can no longer pass off as cunning trickery from the hotel manager, he must face his inner demons as well as the deceptive visions brought forth by the hellish room. When the inevitable jumpy scares finally do arrive, we're so worked up by the terrifying setting and nerve-wracking mental deterioration of our protagonist that we jump even higher out of our seats.<br /><br />As Cusack's character changes from stubborn skeptic to mortified victim, his surroundings shift in appearance as well, almost like a less drastic Silent Hill, where the walls crack and bleed and an icy chill blankets the room in frost. The usage of such visual change in setting (especially later, when stormy waves flood the room) helps to keep Enslin a stranger in his surroundings, and therefore the audience as well, even though the film practically takes place all in one small location. The normally static environment becomes an unpredictable location where anything can happen.<br /><br />1408 is virtually a one-man show, and Cusack embodies the perfect victim and empathetic host to the horrors unfolding. At first he is obstinately confident in the nonexistence of ghosts and such supernatural phenomena, but as the notorious one-hour time limit counts down (thanks to an unnerving alarm clock with a mind of its own), Enslin realizes just how wrong his assumptions were. An ingenious plot device has him dictate his thoughts into a tape recorder, allowing the audience to participate in his initially logical thought process that quickly deteriorates into a frantic rationalization of the eerie events he witnesses, and ultimately the realization that he will die in the cursed hotel room.<br /><br />Though infused with plenty of cynical humor, the steadily increasing dread can't be shaken from Hafstrom's clever adaptation of Stephen King's short story. An inspired performance from Cusack keeps the suspense high and the hope of escape low, and the rising fear and paranoia parallel such horror greats as The Shining and Audition (as do the skillful psych-outs that toy with the audience and Enslin). And while our protagonist may be able to talk his way out of being frightened by the terrifying events unfolding (at least for a short while), chances are the audience won't be able to do the same.<br /><br />- Joel Massie</p></br><a href="../users/A3NH7PYU4AD5GA.html">A3NH7PYU4AD5GA</a><br/><p>Surely the best horror movie that I have seen for a long time.

Never has he actually come across a ghost or even anything remotely haunting and it shows in his cynicism when people ask him questions or when people tell him about something that is haunted. One day while going through all the `come to my haunted place' mail he gets, he comes across a simple post card saying `Do Not Enter 1408', and it grabs his attention and he decides to try out the room. After some legal action, he finally gets his room booked and heads to the hotel. The manager of the hotel, Gerald Olin (Samuel Jackson), tries his best to convince Mike to not go into the room and to just take a penthouse suite and go to a Knicks game... anything but go in there. After some very convincing arguments from Gerald, Mike still goes in the room. Once in the room, Mike begins to witness some strange and scary events from a room that isn't just haunted, but more like evil and demonic. Mike is convinced he's just drugged from liquor that Gerald gave him and is hallucinating everything until things begin to hurt him.<br /><br />I really didn't care for this movie for the fact that, due to the trailers, I thought I was going to be watching a scary haunted room movie. But in fact it was more of a scary psychological thriller movie. That doesn't really bother me, but most of the scenes were just plain or not that interesting. There were a couple scenes that were really good, but there were just too many that made me wish the movie was over. I for one could have done without the daughter scenes, but that's only because I didn't know I was going into a `thinker' movie. Sure, I get the point that the room was bringing out his inner demons or whatever, but at the time, it was just out of place for me. And then the whole `is he in the room or is this in his head' and `did he escape or did he not' stuff was just not well thought out. If you wanted to leave it open for us for thinking, I don't think the ending should have been what it was. I heard there were two different ending though and I saw the one that was on the single disc DVD.<br /><br />I'll tell you what though; Samuel L. Jackson is a great actor. While he was trying to convince Mike to not go in that room, I was thinking, "DON'T GO IN THAT ROOM. LISTEN TO SAM! HE GOT ATE BY A SHARK! HE KNOWS THINGS!" The dialogue between John and Sam was really done well by both actors. I shouldn't really have to say much about John Cusack, he's awesome in everything he does. It's just his style that I really like. Like when Sam was hovering over John in a chair while telling a story, you see John look up and say "What are you doing?" It just felt like it wasn't scripted to me and I started giggling a little.<br /><br />Well in the end, I would say give it a try. These movies are seriously hit or miss for all different types of people. But to this guy, I really hated it both times I saw it.<br /><br />P.S. - My room was haunted when I was growing up!

Yes, I know that he writes horror stores but that is the extent of my knowledge.  So, I was surprised to find that I enjoyed "1408".<br /><br />The essence of the story is that Mike Enslin (John Cusack) plays a cynical writer who pens reviews of supposedly haunted hotel rooms.  And why wouldn't he be cynical?  Stories of haunted rooms are a dime a dozen and who believes in ghosts?  Well, certainly not Mike Enslin.<br /><br />After receiving some anonymous mail, Enslin books into room 1408 at the Dolphin Hotel in Manhattan.  He is implored by the hotel manager (Samuel L Jackson) not to choose the room.  There have apparently been countless largely unexplained deaths in that very room.  Enslin, however, is a persistent man and he will not be convinced of the dangers.<br /><br />At first glance, the room seems totally unremarkable.  But, after a short time, strange and sometimes chilling things begin to happen.  I can say that at times I was given goose bumps.  This film is largely able to find that delicate balance between schlock and horror.  This is a rare achievement as the film industry is littered with movies that are often trapped by the former whilst forgetting the latter.<br /><br />Without spoiling the remaining plot of the film, there is an explanation for much of the various unexplained events.  Yet, it wouldn't be a good horror story without a twist in its tail.  And this one also has a good twist.  Enjoy!

It is well made and produced for a horror, but it is not a full out horror movie.  Yes it is about a haunted hotel room, but there were not that many shocking moments.  This is more of a character story about a man trying to deal with the death of his daughter and his non belief in god or anything beyond the living.  I think the story fails to be a balls out scarefest and it also fails to bring a full and satisfactory conclusion to his issues.  Cusack does a fine jobe and a brief appearance by Jackson is also good.  The ending was a little weak and the alternate endings presented in the extras are really no better.  This was a good rental and I am sure some people will love it, but for me it will remain a rental.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FY3H6F4249E0.html">A3FY3H6F4249E0</a><br/><p>I was really pleased to see this genuinely scary flick WITHOUT all the blood and guts and slashing and killing.

I watched it right before bedtime, so I had to have a little pep talk with myself before I went to sleep.<br /><br />John Cusack is outstanding in his role as Mike Enslin, a cynical hardened writer of mainly books that challenge "haunted" hotels.  Mike stays in the "haunted" room for the night, but never sees any ghosts.  Then he comes back and debunks the so-called haunted hotel.  Mike is a hardened soul who really doesn't seem to believe in anything, nor really care about anything since the death of his young daughter and the subsequent break up of his marriage.  You get the impression that his books aren't very good either.  He seems to have just kind of dried up inside.<br /><br />Anyway, Mike meets his match when he arrives at the Dolphin Hotel in New York, to stay at the alledged haunted room 1408.  Prior to his arrival, the Dolphin will not even accept a reservation from him for that room.  Upon his arrival and insistance, he is greeted by Samuel L. Jackson, the hotel manager.  Mr. Jackson tries everything to persuade Mike NOT to stay in 1408.  He even tells him the room is just "fxxxxxx" evil, but cannot convince cynical Mike. He shows him black and white photos of some bloody dead people (which is as gory as it gets) from that room and tells him about many many deaths associated with the room, but Mike thinks it's just a snow job and insists on staying.  By the way, Samuel Jackson adds just the right amount of creepyness to his part.<br /><br />So, Mike is led to his room and the manager departs his company at the elevator.  Things begin to happen very soon after Mike gets this attitude that nothing is going to happen.  First a window comes down and cracks open Mikes hand, and the clock mysteriously resets itself on a 60 minute countdown while it starts playing "We've Only Just Begun" by the Carpenters'.  A little at a time, all heck begins to break loose.  I can't tell you anymore without ruining the movie for you, but if you want a good scare, this should do it.  It's full of surprises and real heart-thumping terror.  When it's finally over you say, "Whew!" and are glad you're alive.<br /><br />No, I do NOT recommend it for children. Let them have their sweet childhood dreams as long as they can. By the way, I am pleased to say that I don't remember any foul language in the movie other than the comment by the hotel manager (above) for emphasis.  He was frustrated that he could not convince Mike to stay in another room, so the comment fit perfectly.</p></br><a href="../users/A141HP4LYPWMSR.html">A141HP4LYPWMSR</a><br/><p>The '07 release `1408' definitely had some positives going for it hinting at the strong possibility that this film would be a memorable and frightening viewing experience. I mean who doesn't love just about everything John Cusack appears in? Add the imposing figure of Samuel L. Jackson in a somewhat adversarial role and a reportedly haunted room at the Dophin Hotel and you begin to anticipate a disturbing, heart pounding journey into the supernatural.<br /><br />Unfortunately The film doesn't deliver as anticipated. Yes the production values are superb, the acting stellar (Cusack is amazing) and the storyline well developed and interesting. The problem is simple, the film simply lacks in the "Fear Factor" category which is obviously the most important aspect of any movie within the horror genre. There was no perceived acceleration of heartbeat, no increase in perspiration and no shutting of the eyes or turning away from the screen at any time. More importantly, there was no lingering uneasiness afterwards that would cause one to uncharacteristically peak into the closet or leave a night light on. All the things one would expect from a truly frightening film are mysteriously absent. Bottom line; good film, but not scary.<br /><br />My Rating: -3 ? Stars-.</p></br><a href="../users/AV1KYJXHOWPMD.html">AV1KYJXHOWPMD</a><br/><p>I watched this film in the theater last week and having read the brilliant short story (in Everythings Eventual) I knew this could either make a bad or good movie. When it was done, I loved it. The film stayed faithful to the short story and it rocked. I really liked the casting with very good actors like John Cusack (who was the sole performer for most of the film) and Samuel L. Jackson. The special effects were most convincing. To be honest, I liked the ending in the film better. I've been hearing in a few places that Stephen King recommends the film and I do to. This film washes away the shameful crap houses like Saw and Hostel and restores good supernatural horror to its place. Lastly I recommend both the book Everythings Eventual (it contains the short story) and this film (which I believe I like better).</p></br><a

works well until shortly after we enter room 1408,then it starts to regress into a cliche ridden,been there done that,spook story.<br />Author Mike Enslin(Cusack)is a moderately successful writer who has written a few books on ghosts and apparitions.He visits hotels,motels and houses that are supposedly haunted,well equipped with the latest in technology so he can document everything he experiences.However Mike is so far a skeptic,as he has never experienced anything approaching the paranormal in his travels.He returns to his home in California and goes surfing,only to experience a rather violent wave wash-over while trying to read a banner being pulled by a plane.Returning home he is sorting through his  mail when a postcard with the Dolphin Hotel in NYC,catches his eye.The writing on the back says NOT to visit room 1408 there.Intrigued he phones and tries to book it but has no success.He phones his publisher who in turn brings in a lawyer and between the three of them,they manage to get the room booked.<br />He arrives at the Dolphin a few days later and is greeted by the hotel manager Mr.Olin(Jackson),who begs him not to stay in the room because it is evil.Mike will not be talked out of it and the manager personally escorts him up the elevator to the floor,but will not see him down the hall to the room itself.Mike enters the room to find a rather well appointed older style decor.Always with his personal tape recorder in hand,he talks his notes out,describing the surroundings as mundane and frustratingly waiting to put in another fruitless night.Slowly but surely things start to happen in increments,like chocolates appearing on his pillow,the toilet paper end arranged neatly and a painting going crooked.Suddenly the clock radio comes to life blaring out the Carpenters "We've only just Begun".When the room temperature rises to unbearable degrees,he calls a maintenance man who comes but won't step inside the door.After he hurriedly leaves and the door is shut the radio comes on again;he pulls it out but the time revs forward and stops at 60 minutes,only to start clocking slowly backwards.The game is on baby.<br />Numerous specters of guests past,walk through the room,he tries to leave by walking out on the ledge to the next room but the next room disappears into never ending brick,he sees and talks to his dead daughter and father.We slowly find out that Mike carries alot of emotional baggage with the disintegration of his marriage because of his daughters death with cancer.Mike then desperately uses his laptop to contact his wife for help.This is cut short when the sprinklers go off.He tries to get out through the vent shafts above only to be chased back by an undead figure.A painting of a ship foundering in a storm comes to life and it floods the room with water.He goes under and resurfaces only to find himself back on that same beach in California that he was at when he was washed-over previously.He now can read the plane banner and the phone number on it ends with 1408.He ends up in the hospital with his wife by his side as he tries to make sense of what happened.She tells him to write about his experience,and when he does and is finished, he goes to the local post office to mail the transcript.However the employee who serves him tells him that he can't because they're closed.He recognizes him from the Dolphin Hotel and as he looks around at the construction crew,they are also from the hotel.They start into ripping the walls down to reveal room 1408 of the hotel.He has never left but re-enters it.The room now is blackened out from a fire.<br />His daughter appears and there is a tearful reunion with her but she suddenly crumbles to dust as the clock radio comes back on and the room returns to normal.Mike grabs a cognac bottle given to him by Olin and makes a Molotov Cocktail out of it and sets the room on fire.The room erupts in screams as the flames engulf the entire room.Firefighters rescue Mike and he is taken to the hospital.Mike has escaped,but barely.As he sits at his desk at home listening to his burnt tape recorder with his wife,the voice of his deceased daughter comes on and both stare at each other in disbelief.Fade to black.<br />The film builds wonderfully up until the moment the radio blasts out the Carpenter song.From there on in the movie becomes filled with cliches with the walking specters,the hot and cold room,the room filling with water,his disorientation,the taps scalding him,the walls issuing forth blood and so on and so on.The writers here went to great lengths to scare us but in the end,they just end up psyching themselves out by overcompensating with the special effects and muddying the haunted waters,by combining the occult with Mike's closet skeletons.Both main stars do wonderful jobs in their respective roles,with the film eventually turning into a one man show for Cusack;and he certainly was up for the task.It is just too bad the script wasn't.<br />Technically speaking the film is clear and crisp in its original a/r of 2:40:1.Extras include shorts on Inside room 1408,an interview with various stars on the film and the trailer.<br />All in all a decent film of yet another Stephen King story,but expanded to lengths not necessary in order to scare.The film is strong up until shortly after he arrives in room 1408,then it goes downhill in plot and scare factor.It becomes a little too cliched and obvious with the main characters foibles thrown into the mix.But Cusack and Jackson are strong actors and they compensate for the films flaws as best as they can under the circumstances.</p></br><a href="../users/AIMR915K4YCN.html">AIMR915K4YCN</a><br/><p>1408 proves once again, that a PG-13 horror movie can be excellent if done right. As w/ THE RING, THE GRUDGE, and the recent INSIDIOUS, 1408 uses building terror, creeping dread, and a solid story / characters (John Cusack and Samuel L. Jackson are fantastic) to make us actually care about what happens. Now, don't get me wrong, I like a good, mindless movie as much as anyone, but I also love movies that stir my grey matter a bit. 1408 delivers thought-provoking questions within it's jolts and shocks. Well worth owning...</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>The story is pretty simple. A man stays in a cursed room in a New York Hotel. The Dolphin Hotel's "Room 1408" is actually "an evil room," the hotel manager says, where more than 50 guests have committed suicide there (one drowned in his chicken soup). Ignoring the warning words of the manager, a jaded writer Mike Enslin checks in the room where he encounters a series of creepy events. Mike, who doesn't believe in these paranormal events, must endure the terrifying 60 minutes there.<br /><br />Had it not been for John Cusack who plays the skeptic protagonist Mike, "1408" could have been an unwatchable mess. John Cusack and his strong acting successfully provide tension and occasional humor to the familiar story while the superb production designs and the photography of the dimly-lit interiors give the film an authentic feel. Samuel L. Jackson appears as the hotel manager Gerald Olin, but his role is just an extended cameo and the film is virtually about Cusack's hero and the room itself.<br /><br />However, in spite of its gripping first half, the film gradually loses steam, not knowing where to go. Whatever the room does, the room does anyway, and there are not many options it can eventually take. The Carpenters song is a nice touch, but director Mikael H?fstr&ouml;m takes too much time to lead us to the climax, and some of the tricks you will see are nothing new and sometimes look repetitious.<br /><br />"1408," based on a Stephen King short, has familiar elements seen in numerous haunted house stories (in book or film) of the past, most notably, "The Shining" - both stories centering on isolated space, for example - but their approach is different. I enjoyed watching "1408" for the most part, but it is also true that I couldn't shake off the feeling that I saw it all elsewhere.</p></br><a href="../users/ARMVAHWQQ9S8A.html">ARMVAHWQQ9S8A</a><br/><p>The scare factor was high--but not to the point where you'll be uncomfortable sleeping alone for a week, which is too much in my humble opinion--and was enough to please those looking for a thrill.  The story had enough emotional impact for those looking for a bit more.  A few scenes could have been cut here and there to make it a tighter film, but overall it was a very good, atmospheric film experience.<br /><br />It's not one of those movies where you can automatically guess what happens.  Actually, one of the tricks of this film--now this is interesting--is that there are many points where viewers will think they've got it figured out.  Well, all those assumptions will be blown away by the end of this movie, which I thought was rather clever.  As things started to wrap up, I thought the end was going to be a big downer (as in depressing, not disappointment), but again--my assumptions were wrong.<br /><br />One thing I didn't like about this movie was the use of music.  Good music--like good acting and writing--is invisible, because it adds to the overall mood of the story.  However, music that tells the audience what to feel by being too loud, overly dramatic, or sappy has no place in the world of film, and there were a few instances in this film where I felt that the music was doing just that.  I'm not referring to the use of the song "We've Only Just Begun," which was bone-chillingly effective, but the actual score of the movie.<br /><br />Overall, 1408 is a vast improvement over the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V4UH0I">brainless</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EHRVP6">gore-fests</a> of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00105303S">torture porn</a> trying to pass as horror these days.  1408, though it isn't perfect, is an example of what horror flicks should aspire to be.<br /><br />8/10</p></br><a href="../users/AYG1U47VFZ165.html">AYG1U47VFZ165</a><br/><p>The chief problem with all of 1408 remains the chief problem with most 'ghost'-based films: once you're absolutely certain that you're dealing with a ghost/spirit/evil-presence, etc., how much longer CAN you suspend your disbelief?<br /><br />Based on a Stephen King short story (could you possibly have been expecting a happy ending?), 1408 revolves around a faithless paranormal author Mike Enslin, played perfectly by John Cusack.  Enslin writes books about the alleged 'haunts' across America, spending the night in haunted hotels to debunk the supposed ghostly experience.  He's a professional cynic -- a writer who believes in what he can see, not what he's been told -- and he's out to prove, essentially, that there's no such thing as an afterlife.  After receiving a bump on the head from a surfing accident, Enslin receives a mysterious postcard from an anonymous fan warning him to avoid staying in Room 1408 of the upscale Dolphin Hotel.  Intrigued moreso with the opportunity to debunk yet one more contemporary urban myth, he immediately books the room for one night ... and what a night it turns out to be.<br /><br />1408 (the room, not the movie) is occupied (not only with weary travelers, but also something far more ominous): 1408 is evil itself, receiving its marching orders from the deepest, darkest fears of the boarders themselves.  At first, the room greets Enslin with precisely the antics anyone would expect -- weird noises, weird appearances, and other general weirdness ... but, before his stay is over, evil itself will have looked deep into the writer's heart and soul, bringing to the surface only those memories that can crack an already fragile human psyche.<br /><br />Where the film excels is the performance of John Cusack.  As Mike Enslin, he embodies the writer with a sense of curiosity coupled with hints of disbelief.  Cusack's scenes with Samuel L Jackson (the hotel's manager, who primarily serves to set-up the history of the legendary room, no doubt 'sounding' like John Cusack's inner voice at a time when the writer truly believed in what he was reporting) are brilliant; they perfectly draw Enslin (and the viewer) deeper and deeper into the mystery of the Dolphin Hotel, and the verbal banter shows how well Cusack holds his ground as an actor against his learned peers.<br /><br />Where the film fails (or stumbles, at least) is what I stated in my lead paragraph: once you know what you're dealing with -- that the room is evil, that its peeling back the layers of Enslin's life and darkest tragedies -- at what point can the viewer believe in what he's seeing?  The crux of any good ghost story is maintaining the level of interest for the viewer.  Things that go bump in the night are only scary for so long, but 1408 is about things that go bump in the M-I-N-D, events that alter one's life, events that inspire despair and longing instead of enforcing hope and humanity.  While Cusack's performance lifts the film higher than the typical spook tale, I personally (and it's always a matter of taste) didn't find the story to be a fitting counterpoint.  It's a good entry into a rarely effectively explored sub-genre of the ghost story; on that point, the film's worth a viewing.</p></br><a href="../users/A1435P5AMCPB3X.html">A1435P5AMCPB3X</a><br/><p>This movie was a bit of a let down from the previews.  Not nearly as suspensful, nor scary as it could have been, and the pace of it at times made me a bit drowsy at times.  This involves Cusac who plays a writer who investigates haunted places.  One day he recieves a postcard with a hotel name and the room 1408 on it, and his curiosity gets the best of him, and he investigates.  There are a few subplots running along in this that try to build depth to this movie, and does it sufficiently, but overall the action/thrill, and unpredictability are not there to make this a lasting horror/thriller classic.  Worth a viewing if you are a fan of Stephen King.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>Based on Stephen King's short horror story, "1408" keeps us guessing whether the horror lives in the room or in the mind of its aggrieved, alcoholic protagonist. Mike Enslin (John Cusack) is a novelist whose creative energies have seen better days. Now he churns out guidebooks to purportedly haunted locales and tours the country in search of paranormal activity that he never finds. Mike wants to investigate Room 1408 in New York's Dolphin Hotel. But the hotel's manager Gerald Olin (Samuel L. Jackson) does everything he can to dissuade Mike from entering the room, where 56 guests have died in the hotel's 95-year history. Mike scoffs at the claim that no one lasts more than an hour, and insists on spending the night in Room 1408.<br /><br />We spend that hour with Mike in real time. The build-up to the hour of horrors introduces us to Mike's state of mind, to the legend of Room 1408, and to the imposing, intriguing hotel manager Olin. Mike's conversation with Olin is a lot of fun before we enter the maelstrom. The action in the Room runs out of steam after a while, but it recovers and succeeds largely because we're never quite sure what the source of Mike's ordeal is. At times, I thought "1408" was no more than a minor reworking of "The Shining", but the film doesn't linger long on any one rationalization. I can't say that I was scared, but I was entertained by Mike's cynicism, Olin's frankness, and that Room that forces its occupants to confront -and perish by- their own demons.<br /><br />The DVD (Weinstein Company single disc 2007): The single disc DVD contains the theatrical release version of the film, not the director's cut. Bonus features are 2 "webisodes", which are brief promo spots, and a theatrical trailer. In "John Cusack on 1408: A Webisode" (2 ? min), Cusack talks a little about the story and Samuel L. Jackson talks about the room. "Inside Room 1408: A Webisode" (2 min) features actors commenting on the room, and the special effects supervisor explains some of the effects. Subtitles are available for the film in English SDH and Spanish. Dubbing available in French.</p></br><a href="../users/A1U360OMVQRPUB.html">A1U360OMVQRPUB</a><br/><p>I didn't go see 1408 when it was in the theaters.  I intended to.  Life kept me away and it was gone.  So I was really looking forward to it when it came out on DVD.  And I ended up putting off watching it immediately.<br /><br />I think part of the reason was that I really wanted to like it.  Stephen King, when he's on (and I think he will be in the upcoming DUMA KEY), can't be beaten in the creep-factor.  And John Cusack is just one of those actors that I can watch no matter what he's in (though my personal fave is GROSS POINTE BLANK).<br /><br />Having them together was just a little bit of heaven.  In a hellish, possessed hotel room sort of way.  With Samuel L. Jackson playing a hotel manager who might not exactly be on the side of the angels.<br /><br />Happily, I enjoyed the movie, got my quota of scary moments and John Cusack intensity/one-liner presentations.<br /><br />There's nothing really new here.  King has pulled off bigger scare fests that still manage to touch the heart.  And Cusack has certainly performed in roles with more and deeper range.  But they definitely landed in fair territory (to use a baseball euphemism that King will appreciate) with this one.  You get more runs through base hits than with homeruns.  People just remember the homeruns more.<br /><br />Cusack, likeable as always with a touch of the sardonic and sarcastic, portrays Mike Enslin, a writer of true horror who doesn't believe in the paranormal.  Despite his lack of beliefs, his books have done well enough to give him a decent life.  However, he's never gotten over losing his young daughter, Katie, to a terminal illness or his own loss of faith.  He puts God and ghosts on the same page and filed them all in the circular bin.<br /><br />Until he reaches Room 1408 in the Dolphin Hotel in New York City.  A mysterious postcard arrives and sets Enslin on the trail of the long line of deaths associated with the hotel room.  Even though he doesn't want to be, Enslin is captivated by the idea of the room.  He decides he needs to stay there for the night for the final chapter in his latest book.<br /><br />The atmospheric build-up leading to Enslin's checking in at the Dolphin is so much a part of this story.  We can see that he's driven and missing a piece of himself, but we don't know what's driving him or what he's missing.  Then, as he researches all the deaths, I got hooked on the story.<br /><br />I have to admit, I'm a sucker for a good ghost story.  I love digging into the background of the coming tale, trying to guess what the writer is going to attempt to do to me during my stay.  I hadn't read King's short story in the collection EVERYTHING'S EVENTUAL, or if I had, it forgot it.  The screenwriter's outdid themselves on this one.  An overview of the short story shows that much of what they created for the movie wasn't in the short story, but the whole atmosphere was.  That's what King excels at when he's got his A-game.<br /><br />After Cusack checks into the room, during the last hour of the film or so, 1408 almost becomes a one-man play.  Cusack carried the whole load of the movie on his shoulders and totally walked through it like he was out for a Sunday stroll.  Cusack nailed every emotion, his own as well as the ones he was trying to elicit from the audience.  He played me like a harp, and I've seen enough horror films and read enough Stephen King to stay one step ahead.  And I did, but the movie kept me constantly on the move to earn my one step.<br /><br />The special effects are awesome, but they only work so well because of Cusack's performance and the pacing by the director, Mikael Hafstrom.  If the human element and the timing hadn't been there, it wouldn't have mattered how good the special effects were.  Audiences believe in character and atmosphere before they believe in cinematics.<br /><br />As it turned out, because of the holidays, I ended up watching the movie one night, then again the next.  It held me captivated both nights, just watching Cusack go through his paces again as I picked up small nuances of the visual cues that I'd missed or neglected to pay as much attention to because I was pumping adrenaline the first time.<br /><br />The only thing I can fault the movie for was not explaining why Room 1408 was haunted.  There's enough of a history there that I bought into the overall story, but usually movies and tales like these always nail down the "origin" story as well.  This one didn't and I was irritated enough to mention it.  Still, no matter what explanation had been provided, I might have discounted the threat if I'd known what the horror was actually caused by.<br /><br />If you're a horror fan, there's a lot to like about 1408.  And if you want to sit down with the older kids on family night for a little chill and shiver, this movie is definitely one you can do that with because there's no obscenely bad language and the death scenes didn't push it past a PG-13 rating.  Good, scary fun.</p></br></body></html>

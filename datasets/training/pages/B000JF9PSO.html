In the brilliant hands of British director Paul Greengrass, we have a film of passion, confusion, and full-circle resolution that is presented with the utmost care and concern; and profound respect. I was fascinated, riveted to the screen, and terribly moved by the film. The DVD extras, interviews with the famiies, are quite moving. This is really a film to be seen by all, if only to let people know that evil can be overcome with grit and determination. There is definitely strength in numbers. Bravo to the editors, the humility to those relatively unknown actors playing the parts, and to Paul Greengrass for delivering a sad slice of American history with such sensitivity.</p></br><a href="../users/A2Z0A3DOG0EVTY.html">A2Z0A3DOG0EVTY</a><br/><p>Where was I on September 11, 2001? Where was I as America was under attack?  I was sleeping. I got a frantic call from my big sister, and when I turned on the TV to see what happened all I got was static.  I lived eight miles away from ground zero and I felt cut off from the world.  As I finally found a channel on the TV that worked I saw the Twin Towers fall on live.  I didn't hear any explosions, I just saw a picture of two giant buildings falling.  I saw smoke rise as I drove to work later that afternoon.  The world had forever changed, but except for the pictures of anguish and shots of buildings falling down  I heard no explosive sounds from my vantage point.  Do you remember a sound?  Except if you were in lower Manhattan probably not.<br /><br />UNITED 93 is a film about an isolated moment in the middle of extreme chaos.  It's about mundane people living their mundane lives thrust into the most horrifying event in modern history.  It's a film about what a true hero is.  It's about evil men whose true cowardice united ordinary people.  But on a deeper level it's a film about big events in life and how you very rarely hear a sound.<br /><br />On September 11th 2001, four planes were hijacked.  Two hit the World Trade Center, and one hit the Pentagon.  The last plane crashed in a field in Pennsylvania. That plane was UNITED 93, to some it could have looked like a footnote to that horrible day.  But it became a symbol, because ordinary men and women took back the plane and gave their lives to save lives on the ground. Greenglass puts us right in the middle of this life and death drama.  We meet the hijackers, we meet the flight crew, and we meet the passengers.  We don't get to know them, but in real life do you really know who's sitting next to you?<br /><br />The film watches as people get ready for takeoff, as tower officials look at the skies on computer monitors. We check in with the FAA, the military, and we see that on September 11th life was pretty normal.  Then we watch helplessly as every one of these people is thrown into a tailspin when a plane disappears off a computer monitor.  We watch as a tiny green blip just disappears.  That flight hit the North Tower and it had just begun.<br /><br />What Greenglass wisely does is not focus on the carnage.  We don't even see the first plane hit the World Trade Center, and when the second one finally does there is not a big explosion.  We see it on a TV, with the CNN tickertape moving slowly by.  We see smoke, but we see no carnage.  Only Silence.  In a more conventional film we would probably see every explosion, but even as United 93 hits the ground we hear nothing, only silence. Because for the most part things only blow up in the movies.<br /><br />This device works well.  It makes UNITED 93 feel real.  The people feel real.  The action feels real.  I liken it to watching a home movie.  United 93 is so simple and effective I almost looked for the time and date stamps in the corner of the screen.  It's natural and raw.  That's why it is so effective and that's why it needed to be made now.<br /><br />September 11th's history is still being written.  As we get further and further from it  a romantic version of these events will begin to unfold.  You want proof check out a World War II film made in the 40's and compare it to PEARL HARBOR.  UNITED 93 is a film that's effectiveness will be felt 50 years from now when that generations Michael Bay decides to make a silly film about a girl and a guy who find love on the 65 floor of the trade center as they fall.  But in the here and now UNITED 93 will stand as a record of Hero's who saved the day, of the confusion that overtook us all, and of the raw power of real life.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VQSFORKH8B7O.html">A3VQSFORKH8B7O</a><br/><p>Hard on the heels of last January's TV Movie "Flight 93," acclaimed filmmaker Paul Greengrass brought his own variation of the fate of the passengers and crew of United Airlines Flight 93 to the screen, in the first theatrical feature to deal with the events of September 11, 2001.<br /><br />After seeing the television film, I thought it would be hard for any film, even a theatrical feature, to match the power and emotional charge that the first film had. But "United 93" succeeds with flying colors. A totally different approach all together, Greengrass depicts the events from the plane, with no dramatic imbellishment. This gives the film an immeadiacy that truly puts the viewer on the plane with these men and women. This is what gives "United 93" it's power. The scenes of air traffic controllers and military personnel trying to figure out what is happening on that fateful Tuesday morning are equally harrowing.<br /><br />The cast and crew do a fantastic job of recreating this tragic event of recent history, while showing the bravery of the men and women who fought to re-take Flight 93, and prevent possibly hundreds more from being murdered.<br /><br />I highly recommend this film, both as a reminder of that fateful day, and as a reminder of what we are fighting to prevent from happening again.<br /><br />Grade: A</p></br><a href="../users/A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL.html">A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL</a><br/><p>"United 93" is a taut reinactment of 9/11.  The action focuses mainly on the air traffic control towers and the one flight that managed to thwart the intentions of its hijackers.  It is good that the scope was chosen as it is. The movie is focused, but frenetic, a believable presentation of that inconceivable day.  Yet, it doesn't ignore the other aspects of 9/11 either.  Some of the actual people play themselves in the movie, and the actual footage of the Twin Towers and the Pentagon give the movie a poignant presentation.  Furthermore, the events unfold in a way that is plausible and realistic.<br /><br />Why see this movie?  I wonder myself, 'Is it morbid curiosity that brings one to this film?' The answer is simple:  It documents the courage of Tod Beamer and other real heroes that tragic day when America was otherwise blind-sided by a small group of deluded thugs.  9/11 is still unbelievable, and four and a half years later, we need to be reawoken to the consequences of that terrible day.  Nearly everyone is shown with slow reaction time, but their incredulousness is understandable.  (Some of the bureacracy should have taught us many lessons.) The movie honors the people of United flight 93 and puts a set of faces on the tragedy.  "United 93" gives us another chance to grieve, appreciate, and remember.  It also allows us an opportunity to face our worst fears.</p></br><a href="../users/A129YBX5BVNW2.html">A129YBX5BVNW2</a><br/><p>I can remember the first time I saw "United 93" - I was stunned and intensely moved. Released less than five years after the events of September 11, 2001 - the wounds were still raw. Yet the film was sentiment and opinion free - visceral to the extreme - and painfully brutally honest - and of course all the more admirable for it.<br /><br />Written and Directed by PAUL GREENGRASS - it had the most difficult material in the world to deal with - fraught with all sorts of depiction dangers and accusations of a crass cash-in. And yet it succeeded on every level. Come the last 15 minutes - your hurt is pretty much uncontrollable and the tears are flowing for real.<br /><br />And now on the 10th Anniversary of the event (Sept 2011) - it arrives on BLU RAY. And I'm glad to say it boasts a proper upgrade in picture quality and 'bonus material' which is not just respectful - but equal in power to the movie itself...<br /><br />It opens with four men in an apartment block. Dressed like a Middle Eastern businessman, the leader of the group squints underneath his immaculately clean reading glasses. But Ziad Jarrah is nervous - and as he breathily chants prayers over his Koran - even seems troubled. But a face that has no such qualms interrupts Ziad. It's Ahmed Al Haznawi - who will later hold the flight at bay with a knife he's smuggled into his belt. The al-Qaeda radical fixes Ziad with a steely gaze and says - "It's time."<br /><br />And so begins their infamous journey - driving to the airport - parking their cars - checking-in with minimal luggage - getting through the security monitors - and eventually boarding "United 93" - an early-morning non-stop flight from Newark International to San Francisco. Hours later - 33 passengers and 7 flight crew are fighting back - desperately trying to retake the cockpit from Ziad and Ahmed. But despite their valiant efforts - the Boeing 757 nosedives into a field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania at 10:03 am. And of the four aircraft hijacked and sacrificed that horrible day, it was the only one 'not' to reach Osama Bin Laden's presumed target (The White House, Washington DC).<br /><br />Why does "United 93" work? First up - Greengrass begins with the everyday - the 'ordinary'. In the waiting area - Thomas Burnett makes a business call as he eyes his polished shoes - while a dehydrated Nicole Miller applies lip-gloss once on board. Equally beautiful and seated for take-off, hostess Cee Cee Lyles regrets having not brought enough magazines for her to read on a 5-hour long haul flight - while passengers Patrick Driscoll and his friend William Cashman (70 and 60) plan a hiking holiday to Yosemite National Park from a colour brochure. Hilda Marcin asks politely for a glass of water so she can swallow her medication with her breakfast - while a man opens his laptop on the seat rest in front of him with a relaxed air. A 20-year old Deora Bodley is trying to do just that - she fixes a makeshift pillow on the headrest of her seat - and leaving her headphones in - tries to get some shut-eye. And up in the cockpit while on autopilot - First Officer LeRoy Homer talks to Captain Jason Dahl as they eat their meals from plastic trays about a London holiday he's planning for his wife and their new 11-month old baby. Every scene is humdrum - and of course real - and therefore incredibly unsettling...<br /><br />Second is the cast. There are no big names in the lead roles (some of the actors are vaguely familiar like Christian Clemenson from "Boston Legal" but most are not). Greengrass then combines their largely unknown faces with real people who were actually there on the day - Ben Sliney of Herndon Air-Traffic Control, Thomas Roberts of Boston ATC, Curt Applejack of New York ATC and Major John Fox heads up the military. Along with other staff members, the effect is like watching the events unfold in front of you - but in real-time.<br /><br />The music by JOHN POWELL is also used sparingly - but when it's applied - it packs either an incredibly sinister punch or ups your pulse-rate big time.<br /><br />Then there's the astonishing editing. The camera moves behind people's heads as they run down corridors - we get momentary glimpses of worried faces through gaps in clothing - there's close-ups on sweating foreheads which then in turn pull back onto disbelieving faces. There's side profiles of personnel constantly making and answering phonecalls - desperately trying to get a grip on the escalating panic. Speech quickens as the chaos escalates - and it all ratchets up the tension to the nines. So when the horror finally comes - it's devastating.<br /><br />The first sign of trouble is American Airlines Flight 11, which stops responding to hails from Air-Traffic Control and then disappears off radar over New York (it's gone into the North Tower of the World Trade Centre). Then an officer examines a tape of what was transmitted from the cockpit - he works out that the word 'planes' is used and not 'plane' - as in plural. With 4000 aircraft in the sky - their terror is palpable. Then it gets really ugly. The second of the hijacked aircraft (United 175) finally appears on the New York skyline outside their observation tower. But instead of making an emergency landing - and as they watch - it flies at escalated speed and smashes directly into the South Tower - bursting into flames. Now both buildings are on fire. The moment of silent disbelief that follows in the Control Room is heart-stopping.<br /><br />The script is fast and punchy too. Wisely Greengrass avoided conspiracy theories in his construction but did include factual details. The American military's Airforce NORAD was conducting a drill on that morning (of all mornings) and was informed by the FAA of the hijackings. At 08:46 a.m. they scrambled four F-15 fighter planes from Otis Air National Guard Base in Massachusetts to enter New York airspace, but politicians denied them 'engage' orders. Controversy has raged ever since. But again, Greengrass doesn't discuss this. He just shows the pandemonium at every level of authority while at the same time concentrating on what matters - the 'people' - and especially their eventual bravery - when they realized they weren't going to be any negotiations and they had to stop fanatics killing even more innocents.<br /><br />Some words now on the bonus material - the 2006 UK single DVD had 3 'Extras' - "United 93: The Families And The Film" (60-minutes), a feature-length commentary by Paul Greengrass and "Memorial Pages" - passengers and crew remembered with 40 written biographies. However, an American 2 DVD set put out in 2007 provided more. Added on were - "Flight 93 National Memorial", "Chasing Planes - Witnesses To 9/11" and "Twin Towers". This BLU RAY has all 6 features. The "Families" documentary in particular is extraordinary - where the actors meet the families with often beautiful results. Those who've lost someone are permanently hurting people - and acknowledgement/discussion of this by anyone other than the authorities (who have to appear to care) is hugely cathartic. In between the interviews are a lot of family photos and home movies - so be prepared for sadness as well as celebration.<br /><br />To sum up - given the ultra-sensitivity of the material - "United 93" is a fantastic film and a major achievement for all involved. It's also a worthy reissue on BLU RAY with well thought-out and fitting extras that both enhance and inform.<br /><br />I just wish it hadn't taken so many lost lives to produce something of worth and beauty. May they rest in peace...<br /><br />BLU RAY Specifications:<br />ASPECT: 1080p High Definition Widescreen 2.35:1<br />AUDIO: English DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1, French, Canadian French, German, Spanish, Latin American Spanish, Italian, Japanese DTS 5.1<br />SUBTITLES: English SDH, French, Canadian French, Italian, German, Spanish, Latin Amer4ican Spanish, Japanese, Korean, Swedish, Danish, Finnish, Dutch, Norwegian, Portuguese, Greek, Traditional Mandarin<br /><br />PS: as an aside - but related to 9/11...<br />I urge to check out a video on YouTube called "Regret" by THE BLUE NILE. Apparently collated and posted by a fan that wanted to say something about the atrocity on its 10th Anniversary - the video uses one of this superlative Scottish band's lesser-known tunes - "Regret". The song originally turned up as a UK non-album B-side to the 12" single of the "Tinseltown In The Rain" from 1984 on Linn Records. It's only LP/CD appearance to my knowledge is a 1991 compilation called "The Tree And The Bird And The Fish And The Bell - Glasgow Songs By Glasgow Artists". It's hard to find but worth hunting down.<br /><br />"Regret" is played against a backdrop of black and white images from that tragic event. Recorded years before in a country some 6000 miles away (and of course about something entirely different) it somehow fits perfectly - both musically and lyrically. Words from it title this review.<br /><br />More to the point (and I'll openly admit to this) - it moved me to tears.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R602SXNGOMJ4.html">A1R602SXNGOMJ4</a><br/><p>This was emotional and powerful film that I will remember forever and I can't fault anyone who doesn't want to see this film.<br /><br />Paul Greengrass has done the seemingly impossible by making a Hollywood film about this subject everyone is afraid to touch, but made it in such a way that it's hard to find fault, despite everyone's initial misgivings. No 'rah rah' patriotism. No veiled political stances. No cartoonish villains. No making the enemy sympathetic. Just a brilliantly executed look at what did happen and what 'might' have happened on that fateful day.<br /><br />What makes it more effective is that all throughout you don't recognize any of the actors.  And come to find out, many of the air traffic controllers and military personnel are playing themselves! This makes it all the more real and draws you in and takes you back to that day.<br /><br />And when the passengers decide to fight back? There's no swelling of violins or slow motion shots. They don't have a rallying cry or 'lets do it for Uncle Sam' type speech to motivate everyone. No, these passengers were reacting spontaneously to the situation as it played out and were acting on their survival instinct. You can't help but think how you would react in that situation and makes it all the more compelling and powerful.<br /><br />For all those who were afraid that this film would be exploitive, propaganda filled Hollywood trash, I'm sorry to say that could not be farther from the truth.  I won't say this film is for everyone.  It IS hard to watch at times.  I do know that United 93 was done in a tasteful, respectful manner, and many of the families affected on 9/11 supported its release. Who are we to say otherwise? See the movie and then make your judgment call. You may find yourself surprised, just as I did.</p></br><a href="../users/A21VGNU5959O85.html">A21VGNU5959O85</a><br/><p>Ever since 9/11 I have tried to learn everything I can about that day, especially in regards to the events that took place and the people who were tragically taken from us. I believe that its important to know their names, where they came from, and who they were because we all need to know the loss in order to make sure it doesn't happen again, and their legacies live on in our perseverance. I thought it was time, 5 years after, to begin showing what happened either in TV or in films. The story of Flight 93, the plane that crashed in Shanksville Pennsylvania presumably on its way to hit the White House, is riveting because of the details of both its passengers and crew and the detective work it took to piece together all those details. The planes that hit the world trade centers and the pentagon gave us few glimpses as to what transpired onboard, we have very few first hand accounts to see into their last moments. There were two projects based on that day, this movie "United 93" put out by Universal and a TV movie called "Flight 93" which came on A&E 3 months before the theatrical release. I have watched both, and I prefer the A&E version over this one, now this one is well done and is visually stunning and hits you where it should, BUT the TV version in my opinion has the greatest impact emotionally, physically. United 93, tells more of the technical side, what was happening on the ground at the military and aviation centers, It does not go into the passengers and their personal struggles and their families heartache. On Flight 93 we see everything the technical, the military, the passengers, the hijackers, the families. Watching the people call their families, which is taken directly from records and interviews, broke my heart in two. Knowing these heroes through this glimpse into their final goodbyes, and seeing them rise up to confront the terrorists inspired me like no other movie ever has. United 93 didn't quite live up to that, I felt like they didn't show who these people were and what they were leaving behind. If I hadn't watched the other one, it would have been an amazing movie, I am still giving it 5 stars, it deserves it!</p></br><a href="../users/AY46DEOJJYFTW.html">AY46DEOJJYFTW</a><br/><p>I finally brought myself to watch this film always fearful that I just was not ready for a 9/11 film. This is exquisite filmaking about the toughest day in our history for many Americans. Shot in documentary style with no star power but solid acting all around. Paul Greengrass respectfully chronicles the last flight of United 93 as passengers and crew arrive and terroists prep themselves for their mission. Knowing what will happen and watching the events unfold was riveting. I felt myself unable to move. It's gutwrenching at times especially as flight controllers watch the towers get hit right across the river from them. The crew and passengers of United 93 turn from passengers to heroes as they become aware of what's going on and that other flights have been rammed into the towers and the pentagon. That American can-do spirit leaves you feeling that we can overcome any horrible terror by coming together. An unbelievable movie experience. Be prepared to shed a tear and to feel some gutwrenching but do watch it.</p></br><a href="../users/A33CLVW2K7SL1P.html">A33CLVW2K7SL1P</a><br/><p>Director Paul Greengrass (The Bourne Supremacy) brings us United 93, a real-time rendering of the events that happened on one of the most fateful days of our lifetime. We first meet the four young men who hijacked the flight, then are introduced to the passengers on the plane, air traffic controllers, the FAA, and a military command center. The first portion of the film centers on the first three hijacked planes on 9/11; we watch, impossibly, as the FAA, air traffic controllers, and the military try and respond to a threat that literally appeared out of nowhere, and the difficult, time-sensitive decisions that needed to be made. It certainly gives one pause to think: what would *I* do if faced with such a catastrophe? When the focus switches to United 93, the film gathers considerable momentum. Although there is a relatively large "cast", Greengrass does an enviable job humanizing all of them. It would have been easy to sweep over each person and create a character that was close to the original but still clich&eacute;d, or worse yet caricaturized. In less skilled hands, this may have happened. But Greengrass obviously did his research, learned as much as he could about the people on that plane, and brought them to life in short time. That's not easy to do.<br /><br />Greengrass deserves further commendation for constraint. It would have been easy to turn this into a melodramatic affair, but instead he merely dramatized. He showed us the events as they took place, he showed us the passenger's emotions, and asked us to respond. And we responded! How could we not cheer as the passengers began their revolt? Rejoice at their bravery when they broke into the cockpit and wrested away control of the plane? Cry when we spied in on passenger's conversations with family and loved ones, especially knowing that Greengrass researched the passenger's lives extensively and that the conversations were more likely than not accurately depicted.<br /><br />This is a review of the DVD, and it gets extra high marks from me for the Bonus Features, particularly the interviews with family members. First, they were subtitled, which is sadly still a rarity (I'm hearing impaired, so miss out on most of the bonus/special features); most importantly, though, they reminded us that these were all real people. Next door neighbors. Friends. Co-workers. Brothers, sisters, uncles, parents.<br /><br />The passengers of United 93 deserve a standing ovation from all of us. They were part of a tragedy, indeed, but they fought to stave off an even greater tragedy.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDZNPO7U4E6N.html">A1CDZNPO7U4E6N</a><br/><p>I know by now there isn't a person on the planet Earth that doesn't know the events of September 11,2001. However, we can't really say we actually know or fully understand what truely took place, or how the events really unfolded aboard all 4 airplanes. However, the good thing about this movie is that it does shed some light on the subject, and it tries to give the people some insight as to what happened. Can anyone honestly say that this movie is completely, without a shadow of a doubt, accurate? Absolutely not! Can anyone honestly say that this is how it happened? Absolutely not! But, this movie does try to give you a pretty good idea. I won't lie, at times this movie is very hard to watch especially knowing how everything turns out. I guess what mostly got to me, is the fact that I knew what I was watching wasn't a movie, or something just for entertainment, but these people actually lost their lives on this plane. I'm not ashamed to admit that I cried. I cried to myself thinking that things may have turned out differently if those brave individuals would've just gotten to the cockpit of the plane a little sooner than they did. I cried about the thought of having to call my family and friends to tell them goodbye because I'm about to die. I cried because a whole lot of innocent people suffered and ultimately paid the price for something they had absolutely nothing to do with. This movie also shows you how unprepared and surprised the U.S Government officials were while these events were taking place. This movie cleared up a lot of unanswered questions for me. Like, how could guys with sharpened nail filers and small pocket knives hijack a plane full of people? I'm glad to say that this movie added plausibility to that scenario for me. I find it astonishing that I have read reviews with people complaining about the cinematography, and other useless crap like that. Let's get for real, I think this movie was done with what was important..RESPECT! For the families of the victims. I think this movie would've been extremely disrespectful if there were a lot of special effects dumbing it down. That's typical Hollywood fashion anyway. To make money off of other people's tragedies. I must say that cinematography was the furthest thing from my mind while I was watching this movie, and if I wanted special effects or cinematography I could've watched "The Matrix" or "Lord of the Rings". This movie was way too serious to make light of. I'm also glad they didn't get a whole lot of big screen actors and actresses to portray these real life people, therefore, making it a whole lot more believable in my opinion. I find it hard to believe the validity of a real life events with Nicholas Cage, Maria Bello, and Michael Pena as the stars of the movie like "World Trade Center". That's portraying it like it's nothing more than another action/drama movie, or some kind of made for T.V movie. Now, I think that would've been done in poor taste, but this was tastefully done, and not offensive to anyone.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>It is a tough watch from the very beginning because we know what will happen in the next two hours of the film. `United 93' is still a film that deserves praise not only because of its subject matter, but because of the way it treats it on the screen. It is certain that this is not a film that you can casually watch; some people would never watch it (and I don't blame them for it). But if you're still wondering, all I can say is "If not now, when?"<br /><br />Director Paul Greengrass's semi-documentary style with a shaky camera captures the intense atmosphere of the places. `United 93' unfolds on two levels simultaneously - both in the hijacked plane, and in the controlling room on the ground one after the other. The confusion and tension can be of course re-created in books or documentary films, but Greengrass who four years before made terrific `Bloody Sunday' based on the 1972 Irish Civil Right march and its subsequent events, knows the power of cinema, or how films can have us relate to the people in it.<br /><br />I must write about two things here before ending my review. Some say the detailed accounts of the incidents depicted in `United 93,' especially those on the airplane and her crew and passengers, are not entirely based on the confirmed facts. True, and God only knows what happened on United 93, or whether or not the passengers succeeded in breaking into the cockpit. But I can also say that the film is much more convincing and even truthful than those  conspiracy theories about 9/11.<br /><br />There has been discussion on whether or not the film is exploitation. Honestly, I don't know. But is there any other way of recording and presenting this tragedy without being `exploitive'? Or should we wait another 50 years or more to film it while we know it is about the present time and us? Ultimately it comes to this question: "If not now, when?"<br /><br />Always being somber, `United 93' refuses to be sensational - all the more reason for the film to be challenging and gut-wrenching.</p></br><a href="../users/A1OYW08VVPMP3Q.html">A1OYW08VVPMP3Q</a><br/><p>I've owned this movie for quite a while. I couldn't watch it until this week. It still hurts when I think of that day.<br /><br />This is not a Hollywood epic. There are no big-name stars to distract you from the story. There are no monologues or dramatizations to try to frame a message or tug at heart strings. No, this movie tries to tell as accurately as possible the tale of the passengers and crew of Flight 93, the airliner hijacked by the death-worshippers of Osama on September 11th, 2001. It tells the story not in long scenes or made-up dialog but by snatches of conversations amongst the passengers and by showing the story on the ground, at Air Traffic Control NYC and NORAD's local sector command center.<br /><br />The people on that plane could have been any of us... they were just ordinary housewives, business men, retirees. They didn't ask or deserve to be placed in harm's way but it is the nature of terrorist to strike at those who have no reason to fear. Yet, when it became obvious that the terrorists had no intention of holding the passengers hostage or even of landing the aircraft the passengers fought back. They became heroes the same way many people become heroes... they overcome their fear to do what had to be done. They saved many lives that day, no one can guess how many. I can't think of a better tribute to those men and women than this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/AAU7CAQIN5BAE.html">AAU7CAQIN5BAE</a><br/><p>absolutely engrossing and brilliant, had me glued to the edge of my seat, biting my nails, even though we all knew the awful outcome. Truly remarkable on using the non-professionals in the roles, and even better some of the real people taking the part of themselves, was totally refreshing and absolutely a splendid kudo on the right side cheek of director Paul Greengrass. The amount of countless hours of research and interviews he must have gone through, is totally present in every minute of the film, richly detailed and totally mesmorizing.<br /><br />Certainly not a five star movie, but five star in his writing and directing, without question.<br /><br />BUY this for your collection, the wide screen certainly brings more to the eye, methinks.</p></br><a href="../users/A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX.html">A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX</a><br/><p>This movie is sure to be controversial. Some people will like it, seeing it as a tribute to the heroes of flight 93; others will no doubt see it as opportunistic and cashing in on the tragedy of the flight. But overall I enjoyed the movie and it seemed to be a realistic enactment of what could have happened on that ill-fated flight. I also liked the fact that the director didn't use big name or professional actors, but who did very well in the movie.<br /><br />I had one more comment to make, but on a perhaps different or unusual topic. I am a martial arts instructor one of whose specialties is knife tactics and knife defense. The hijackers in the movie did not seem very skilled or well trained in knife fighting, which means they could possibly have been overcome by someone who was trained in empty-hand tactics against the knife. These skills are more difficult and take more time to acquire than empty-handed skills, of course, but it can be done. Even if one is a master of these arts, though, there are no guarantees, as anything can happen in a knife fight. One thing that was interesting, though, was how easily the one hijacker with the knife was overcome once the passengers decided to act together. Even a knife-wielding assailant can be overcome if they have to face multiple attackers who come at them from different sides simultaneously. He might be able to get to one or two of the incoming people, but likely not all.<br /><br />Another possibility is that perhaps the flight crew could be trained in the use of the Taser electrical dart/stun gun device, which, although not 100% effective if the person is wearing thick clothing, could be worth considering since it would be much safer to fire in a plane than a gun and would not cause explosive decompression like a gun if the hull was penetrated.<br /><br />Unfortunately, 10,000 years of "civilization" has shown that humans do not seem to able to live in peace, and so both individually and as a species we perpetually live in uncertain and dangerous times. And this movie is a reminder of the fact that the U.S. is a more dangerous place than it was just a few years ago. Overall, though, I thought it was a good movie and a dramatic re-enactment a fitting tribute to those who lost their lives in this tragic event. If we learn from these events then perhaps we can prevent similar tragedies in the future.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />United 93 manages to work as an incredibly skillfull thriller, building a great deal of tension up to a climax, and as a testament to those who lost their lives on 9/11; either way you slice it it's quite a film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KJ6JAZPH382D.html">A3KJ6JAZPH382D</a><br/><p>Watching Paul Greengrass' "UNITED 93" is an exercise in anxiety. We all know that the ending is not going to be pretty, and that, as much as our dream would have been for the passenger heroics to have stopped the hijackers and saved the plane; instead there is a big section of torn up field in Western Pennsylvania where the plane ultimately stopped.<br /><br />The question is, then, is the film created with respect and dignity, or is it just another big budget lump? The answer splits at about 90% in favor of good.<br /><br />By using unknown actors and people who actually were real-life participants as Sept 11 unfolded, Greengrass avoids the ticky-tacky sentiment and - in a gutwrenching way - forces these men and women to relive that horrible morning all over again. The actors cast were not picked for their dramatic skills as much as their everyday looks and behavior. They spend much of their early screen time making idle chat or calling work on their cell phones, unaware of their impending fates. The timeline cuts back and forth between the Air Traffic and FAA teams, the military and the plane itself.<br /><br />The story is told in real time, filmed on handheld cameras that force a lack of opinion into "United 93" (as opposed to the made for TV <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EYJHDS">Flight 93: The Movie</a>). Greengrass captures the confusion and panic, especially the utter horror of the Newark Airport employees as they see the second plane hit the towers. In that regard, "United 93" is unlike just about anything you'll ever see.<br /><br />That remaining 10%, you ask? "Untied 93" can't help but indulge in populist myth-making. Greengrass made a valiant effort to get the approval of the passenger/crews family members before embarking on this movie's production. In the bonus documentary, some of the actors meet the families of the deceased, sometimes being more emotional than I'd wager the actors were prepared for. But my guess is, because of that need for confirmation and approval from these folks, almost every person on the flight plays an active role in taking on the terrorists. (With the exception of the one semi-foreign sounding man...which I found pointless.) But we don't know what happened. We can't know what was said. Did one of the passengers really say "I'll break his wrists"? Did the hostesses really join the charge? Or was this just Greengrass' empathy getting the better of him? And despite the fact that those herky-jerky hand-carried camera shots added to the tension and claustrophobia of the scenes inside the plane, there were moments when my inner-critic started grousing "buy this man a dman steadi-cam, already."<br /><br />That said, "United 93" is an affecting piece of film-making. It offers proof that not every major-studio offering gives into the lowest common denominator, and offers us, as citizen viewers, an opportunity to better comprehend the events that will forever mark our generation. Along with the documentary <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006B1HI">9/11 - The Filmmakers' Commemorative Edition</a>, "United 93" is the best of the movies that attempt to make understanding of that day.</p></br><a href="../users/A13OMT8D4GPIBV.html">A13OMT8D4GPIBV</a><br/><p>September 11, 2001 will live in infamy just as December 7, 1941.  Both days are extremely important in America's history.  This movie does something different.  It's a chance for us to not only remember the day but celebrate the bravery of the passengers on one flight on that tragic day.<br /><br />Definitely a move worth seeing.  Beautiful, passionate, and well directed.  This day will live with all of us for the rest of our lives.  A movie like this helps us to remember that some people on that day showed their bravery and hopefully it will inspire us.<br /><br />I recommend that everybody should see this.  You'll definitely look at life differently.</p></br><a href="../users/AE9GUE3HHOX3U.html">AE9GUE3HHOX3U</a><br/><p>As morbid as it sounds, you couldn't help but wonder what went on aboard flight 93 on the tragic 9/11.  This film explored on a timeline as close to what happened as possible.  It was both horrifing and fascinating to witness.  It put a human face on the tragedy, other than seeing and hearing news type coverage about it.  It was a throughly engaging film, and at times hard to watch.  I couldn't help but get teary eyed during certain parts, that whole experience was totally tragic and disturbing.  I hope this film can bring some kind of closure or recogintion to the families of the flight 93 victims. They are of course the most important factor of the film and the reason why it was made.  This film should be dedicated in tribute to them, and of course thier loved ones that perished that day.</p></br><a href="../users/AGKPTMTR3UX1R.html">AGKPTMTR3UX1R</a><br/><p>This is a respectful, well-acted, honest, and as scrupulously accurate a cinematic account of the tragic flight of United 93 as we are probably ever going to see. For the few of you who don't know (and for you "Truthers" who disrespectfully call people "sheeple"), United 93 was the fourth plane hijacked on September 11, 2001. The plane was turned toward Washington DC by the terrorists, but it never got there, instead crashing into a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania. As far as we can tell, the passengers attempted to seize the plane from the hijackers, who drove it a full speed straight into the earth. No one survived.<br /><br />Some of what we see onscreen is necessarily supposition, based on ambient sounds in cellphone and airphone calls made by the passengers. We'll never know if the passengers succeeded in taking the plane even for a moment, but I like to think so.<br /><br />People have said that this film is exploitative. They are, of course, welcome to their opinions, but there is nothing exploitative about UNITED 93, any more than there was anything exploitative about APOLLO 13. Film has become a medium for reporting history, hopefully responsibly.<br /><br />"9/11 Truthers," in love with conspiracy theories, advance the idea that the government planned the entire incident, but their "facts" are made of inference upon inference, skewed to acheive a particular result. Bushworld did not need 9/11 to advance it's Preemptive War Doctrine; any of a score of minor incidents would have sufficed. Hitler started World War II over a border incident at Gleiwitz, a phony incident in which German soldiers battled other German soldiers masquerading as Polish soldiers. A few phony mannequin soldiers were even "killed."<br /><br />But there was certainly nothing phony about the deaths on 9/11.<br /><br />The media and the establishment have made "heroes" out of the Flight 93 passengers, but this both embellishes and obscures the truth. Americans tend to like their "heroes" larger than life, infallible, brave beyond reckoning, and unblemished, the types of mythic figures of which we make statues.<br /><br />Yet we forget that the true heroes are everyday people, like fathers and mothers who go to work each day, return home each night, and dedicate their lives to the kids and to little things like painting the garage, and people who keep on with an exhausting and impossible task to the end no matter the result.<br /><br />The Flight 93 passengers are these kinds of heroes, heroes without quotation marks.<br /><br />After hearing the news that the World Trade Center and The Pentagon had been attacked, realizing that they themselves were doomed if they did nothing, and faced with the reality that they most likely would die anyway, they fought back against the zeal-infected hijackers with airline cutlery, hot water, and sheer determination. Flight 93 became a manned cruise missile, a kamikaze mission, and a battleground on which a group of ordinary, terrified people transcended fear in order to take back what had been taken from them, their lives. That they died in no way diminishes what they accomplished.<br /><br />This film is a fitting memorial to them.</p></br><a href="../users/A192KEPM0HW6AC.html">A192KEPM0HW6AC</a><br/><p>Everybody remembers exactly where he was on September 11, 2001. I was taking a photojournalism course at the Defense Information School at Fort Meade, Maryland, and--ironically--taking part in an exercise on how military reporters should cover terrorist attacks. In fact, we were discussing the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center, and how, by the time the bombers came to trial, its significance had been buried because Americans' attention was diverted by the O. J. Simpson "trial of the century." At that moment, a Navy petty officer burst into the classroom and told our Air Force instructor to turn on the television--that the World Trade Center had just been struck by an airplane.<br /><br />We laughed in disbelief. As Army soldiers, being suddenly thrust by cadre into "live" training scenarios was old hat. We thought we were going to cover a "terrorist event" as a practical writing exercise. But, when the projector switched from the PowerPoint slideshow to the live "Today" show broadcast, we knew from the ominous visual of smoke pouring from the North Tower that this was no exercise.<br /><br />In the immediate aftermath of the attack, rumors abounded that Fort Meade was next, because the National Security Agency is located there. By day's end, I was standing outside our barracks, rifle in hand. I will never forget the emotions and thoughts that poured through me that day--revulsion, nausea, fear, anger, hatred. And finally, relief, because I had been spared the hell so cruelly inflicted on so many of my fellow Americans. As long as I live, I never want to relive that day. None of us do.<br /><br />Thus, when trailers for United 93 began screening in Los Angeles theaters shortly before its release, some in the audience wailed, "Too soon! Too soon!"  Too soon? From the morning Imperial Japan attacked the U.S. at Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, until she surrendered in ignominious defeat on August 15, 1945, 1,348 days had passed. On April 28, 2006, United 93's opening day, 1,689 days of the War on Terror had gone by--almost a full year longer than America's involvement in World War II. Surely time enough has passed to allow us to reflect upon and honor those who died that day.<br /><br />Although Americans were generally familiar with the events that took place on United Airlines Flight 93, most of what we knew had been the subject of dry news reportage and "what if" conjecture. Now, culling transcripts of cockpit flight recorders, 9-1-1 emergency calls, interviews with surviving family members, and eyewitness accounts, writer and director Paul Greengrass has taken the threads of innumerable and seemingly random facts, and woven them into a powerful visual narrative.<br /><br />In United 93,Greengrass's masterful direction gives us the feeling that we are reliving September 11 all over again. He takes us from the flight's takeover by Muslim terrorists to the events on the ground as the World Trade Center and Pentagon are hit by the three other hijacked planes. He follows United 93's doomed course, in scenes inter-cutting between the airplane and the various air traffic control towers on the East Coast; he ends with the passengers retaking control of the plane from the hijackers, and its tragic crash in a field outside Shanksville, Pennsylvania.<br /><br />By transforming my theater seat into a cramped seat in coach, as the forty-first passenger alongside those who would soon die on that hijacked flight from Newark, Flight 93 thrust the events in my face with visual and aural brutality, compelling me to relive that day--and to recall its lessons.<br /><br />Filming in "real time," much like Fox TV's popular action series "24," cinematographer Barry Ackroyd and his crew skillfully captured the action with handheld cameras. It's a method I usually eschew for its forced "realism," but Ackroyd made it work by avoiding show-offish, unnecessary camera movement. By shooting mostly with telephoto lenses, he instills in viewers a sense of claustrophobia that heightens the emotional anxiety. John Powell's dark, percussion-laden soundtrack pummels the ears at rapid-fire tempo, ratcheting up the tension to cardiac arrest levels. Throughout the film, my own heart was racing, my brow was sweaty, and I got that same nauseous feeling in my gut that I so vividly remember from that day.<br /><br />When the end credits rolled, there was nothing but dead silence in the theater where I saw it. United 93 masterfully achieved its objective of re-creating onscreen the nightmare that Americans went through on September 11th.<br /><br />However, despite the fact that United 93 totally connected with me emotionally as a viewer, it suffers from the primary flaw of telling much of the story from the hijackers' point of view. The viewer learns more about what motivated them to take over the plane than he will ever find out about the private motives of the passengers, whose dialogue is rather threadbare. We know that through AirFone conversations with relatives, the passengers found out that hijacked planes had already hit New York and Washington, that their own flight therefore was doomed, and that this knowledge motivated them to wrest back control of the plane. But we never really find outwhat personally inspired each of them to their valorous actions. We never really get to know the Jeremy Glicks or Todd Beamers. I agree with those critics who have pointed that their dialogue should have been beefed up, and that these heroes should have been more clearly drawn.<br /><br />Yet I don't think Greengrass himself fully understands what compelled the onboard rebellion. In a recent interview, he explained his film's depiction of the American passengers:<br /><br />I suppose what I most wanted it to explore was the relationship between individual moments and collective will...You can't lead if the group's not there with the will, and vice versa. Where does leadership come from? It comes from the desire to be led...The order of the airplane was completely subverted...They seized control of the plane, pinned everybody in the back and they were in charge, and something happened in the course of 20-25 minutes...but you've always got that challenge of: what do you do when a bunch of people take over an airplane? You can't just sit there!<br /><br /> While acknowledging and accurately depicting the American passengers' courage, the British director, it seems, hasn't begun to grasp the spirit of independence that most Americans still regard as their birthright. What induced these men and women to action could hardly be reduced simply to some group dynamic of a "desire to be led"--remember, these were American, not German, passengers--but rather, embodied the individualistic, "don't tread on me" streak that fires us up when push comes to shove.<br /><br />Fortunately, Greengrass's detachment does not undermine the movie's strengths. One scene in particular captures what makes the American spirit so unique and indomitable. As the passengers start attacking the hijackers to take back the plane, a frightened Swedish passenger tries to block them, standing astride the aisle like a lunch hall monitor. "Just do what they say," he lectures. "Give in to their demands...co-operate, and we will be safe." The Americans must shove the Swedish weenie aside in order to reach their attackers and regain control of the cockpit. I have yet to see a more succinct metaphor for European dithering and condescension as obstacles to righteous American action.<br /><br />Another critique--that United 93 is Politically Correct--is, I think, mostly unfounded. The movie makes no bones about distinguishing its villains from its heroes; it just does so without heavy-handed sloganeering, which would have wreckedthe taut, montage narrative structure. Composer Powell's menacing and foreboding passages, especially while the terrorists are praying, underscore their vicious brutality, just as upbeat, martial music accompanies scenes of Americans fighting back. Nor does the film disguise the facts that the hijackers were motivated by Islamism, or that the passengers took back the airplane to prevent its striking the U.S. Capitol, and, they hoped, to allow them to return safely to their loved ones.<br /><br />A year after September 11, I spotted a bumper sticker on a passing car while driving the Pennsylvania Turnpike. Next to an image of the American flag were printed these words: "9/11: Remember. Rebuild. Recover." I could not help but think that there was one "R" missing in that slogan. United 93 does a brilliant job in reminding us that on a Boeing 757, a group of heroic citizens taughtus the response befitting a free people in the face of wanton savagery--Revenge. And the film left me experiencing another "R" as well: Reverence for the memories of those heroes.<br /><br />Every American ought to invest two hours of his life in watching United 93, because it graphically depicts the inspiring acts, courage, and hope that helped spark the flames of direct action against Islamofascism. David Beamer, father of slain hero Todd Beamer, said of United 93: "This film is a wake-up call. And although we abhor terrorism as a tactic, we are at war with a real enemy and it is personal."<br /><br />No, it is not too soon for this movie. Rather, let us hope that it is not too late.</p></br><a href="../users/A3JPFWKS83R49V.html">A3JPFWKS83R49V</a><br/><p>United 93 is an incredible reenactment of September 11, 2001 focusing mainly on United Flight 93 and the efforts by its passengers to take back the plane from the hijackers. This movie had my heart pounding, my nerves pulsing, and my body sweating. It takes the viewer on a journey aboard the flight that was supposed to be part of an attack on Washington D.C. but that was thwarted by several brave passengers, thereby saving potentially thousands of lives and millions of dollars in damage.<br /><br />Everyone already knows what took place on September 11, 2001 and anyone who doesn't know can quickly look up facts on the internet or in printed form. The fate of United Flight 93 is already well known and for that reason, I wondered if this movie would be able to keep my attention for very long. I knew about this movie several weeks before its release and I was skeptical about its ability to accurately portray the events and to give the viewer a realistic feel for what happened during this flight. Everyone already knows the outcome, I reasoned, so how suspenseful could it possibly be?<br /><br />Well, I am here to tell you that United 93 is an incredibly suspenseful, scary, heart- pounding movie that ranks among the most dramatic I have ever witnessed. It accomplishes this in spite of the fact that you already know how it will end, and the bulk of the credit goes to director and writer Paul Greengrass for making this possible. He has produced a movie about the United 93 flight that is realistic in every way and so emotionally draining and pulse- pumping it should be approached with caution by anyone who has a history of heart problems.<br /><br />I love many things about this movie and the most important among them is the action and emotional factors. The movie starts off on an easy pace and the action at first is only lukewarm. But then, the North World Trade Center Tower gets hit by a plane, causing a reaction of disbelief on the part of the Air Traffic Controllers. The word "hijack" gets tossed around, but no one can believe it. There hasn't been a hijacking in the United States in decades and it seems too unreal to accept as fact. But then, the second tower gets hit and then the Pentagon. At this point, the action on the screen is furious, with Air Traffic Controllers talking non- stop on phones, officials watching the planes paths on radar, and everyone wondering what to do next. Then, the scene switches to United 93 and its relatively quiet passengers who are chatting back and forth about things in the news, things taking place at their homes, and so on. It's nothing but ordinary chitchat. That is, until the hijackers race to the front of the plane, open the cockpit doors, and attack the pilots. From this point on, the movie is a depiction of sheer terror as the passengers get tossed back and forth, the hijackers stab more victims, and a few of the men join together and rush the cockpit in an effort to regain control of the plane.<br /><br />Another thing I love about this movie is the way it is scripted. Paul Greengrass presents a script in United 93 that is very real. It doesn't contain snappy statements, amusing quips, memorable quotations, a catchy soundtrack of classic rock and roll tunes, or anything else one would expect from a big Hollywood production. Instead, the actors and actresses in this movie talk in the actual manner one would expect them to talk to each other. In other words, the little conversation that exists is typical of what people talk about each day on the job (in the case of the flight members, crew, and Air Traffic Controllers) or in the presence of strangers (in the case of the passengers on the plane). It's almost like Greengrass set the stage, told everyone about the events that took place during the actual United Flight 93, turned on his camera, and let everyone be themselves for the next 111 minutes. Everyone talks in a completely normal way, and this adds tremendously to the film's appeal. It seems so real it's frightening.<br /><br />The emotional appeal of this movie is another strong point and I cannot imagine anyone leaving the theater without feeling shaken in some way. You feel like you're right there with the hijackers. You feel angry at these crazy lunatics who want to kill all of these innocent lives. You feel the suspense as the moment draws near for the passengers to fight back. You feel anxiety and grief as you wonder what must be going on back home as different passengers call their families to tell them they are not likely to ever see them again. And you feel a sense of outrage over the lack of decisive leadership action from the FAA and other government agencies.<br /><br />One unusual thing about this movie is that it doesn't include any well- known Hollywood leading men or women. I recognized only one of the stars of this movie: David Alan Basche, who I can recall playing a part in the movie "War of the Worlds". And even he isn't very well known. I'm not sure why the Greengrass decided to leave out the big names, but I'm glad he did because casting the film with lesser- known actors and actresses makes it seem that much more realistic. They seem like ordinary men and women going about an ordinary day that eventually turned into the most hellish day of the lives. And because the action itself is so gripping, I had a hard time even remembering the names of the characters. Usually, I have a good roadmap in my mind when I watch a movie that accurately organzies the character names and the actors/actresses who played them for future reference. But this movie was so intense with its heart- pouding action that I completely lost track of who was who.<br /><br />One other surprise with this film is that it doesn't attempt to make any brash judgments or any strong political statements. I watched and listened closely to see if there would be any negative statements about different ethnic groups of people, different religions, etc., etc., but there were none. It would have been very tempting with this type of movie to include scenes with the passengers and/or the Air Traffic Controllers going off on a hateful rant over different ethnic groups or different religions but Greengrass resists. He also resists the temptation to blame anyone specifically or to indict any one group as responsible. He does point out the failures of the FAA, but this is honest truth and Greengrass doesn't try to sugarcoat the situation. But he also resists the temptation to demonize the FAA, choosing instead to just point out the inadequacies and move on.<br /><br />Because of the hectic pace of this film, there is a large amount of shaky camera work. The scenes move at a fast clip and the camera has a difficult time keeping up with everything. This is especially true aboard United Flight 93 and as the big moment approaches and the passengers decide to fight back, the camera goes all over the place. Here, some might find this a little bit sloppy and if it were most other movies, I would criticize it for this reason. But here, Paul Greengrass got it right once again. He wanted to depict the scenes exactly the way they would have been witnessed by someone aboard the plane. With all the chaos taking place, the sudden descents, and the rollover of the plane in the sky, the scene wouldn't have been smooth in any person's eyes. It would have been a jumbled mess of action, and that is exactly the way it is shown in this movie.<br /><br />It has been almost five years since the attacks of September 11, 2001. It is a day that will never, ever, be forgotten as thousands lost their lives in these terrorist attacks. But we can all stand proud and remember the brave men who fought back against the terrorists on United Flight 93. They didn't stop the plane from crashing and they didn't save the lives of anyone on board. But they prevented much greater loss of life and property by taking action at a crucial moment. This movie, United 93, is an excellent film that everyone should see. It accurately depicts the drama, the fear, the anxiety, and the sheer madness that was taking place in the skies on September 11, 2001 in a way that is emotionally exhausting and realistic to the extreme. We all know what takes place, but United 93 still keeps you solidly in its grip from start to finish. It's an incredible movie!</p></br><a href="../users/A3RTMB76CJWY9U.html">A3RTMB76CJWY9U</a><br/><p>United 93 depicts the horrific events during September 11, 2001, leading up to the crash of flight United 93, which terrorists had planned to use to demolish the U.S. Capitol building as they had the World Trade Center.<br /><br />There are probably many who feel that this film is "too soon" or in other ways in bad taste (i.e. trying to capitalize on a tragedy). However, if we agree that a film should be made on this subject at all, this film did it correctly. There is nothing overtly "cinematic" about this movie--we're just shown what happened. It is not moralizing at us. It is not telling us how to feel about anything. Just showing what happened, kind of like a dramatic re-enactment.<br /><br />If there is a message to the movie, it is only because the real life events themselves contained it. Perhaps the most compelling "theme" is how unprepared the government was to deal with this kind of a crisis--how the only people in a position to do anything at all were the passengers on the plane. One moment of dark comedy is how, with all of their technology and power, neither the military nor the FAA could figure out what the hijackers were doing until they turned on CNN and watched the coverage along with everyone else.<br /><br />I imagine that some people will complain that the terrorists were not depicted as being more villainous. It is true that some of the hijackers are treated with some measure of sympathy--they are shown to be human beings. However, this is not inappropriate, as whatever else they were, the hijackers *were* human beings. We don't know, and can't know, whether any of the terrorists hesitated, as was portrayed in this movie, but it doesn't make their deeds any less heinous for it. It simply makes them more believable and realistic, which is important because that's the great strength of this movie.<br /><br />United 93 is not really an enjoyable movie to watch simply because it is so sad, but it is well made and very powerful. It draws its power via the fact that it presents these still-painful events  impartially and with an open eye--that it does so realistically--and the quality of the film answers any objections I had going in as to the appropriateness of its creation.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RKI7RPP5CJMG.html">A2RKI7RPP5CJMG</a><br/><p>"United 93" is one of the most moving pictures I've ever seen.  It is a near real-time account of what happened on the doomed United flight that was headed for San Francisco but ended up in a field in Pennsylvania when its passengers overpowered the cowards who intended to use it to hit our nation's capitol.  It opens with the cowards preparing for their mission.  We are then given the seemingly mundane but all-important events of preparing a flight for take-off.  We get very brief glimpses at the lives of the pilot, co-pilot, and the steward staff.  We learn that some of them have children, some of them have been to London, and others are looking forward to a little time off.  We get hints at the lives of the passengers as well.  Some of the have dealings with Sony, some of them are going to meet family, others are planning a visit to Yosemite.  All of these things seem so simple, so "average," but the viewer realizes that none of these normal, everyday events will never come to fruition due to the actions of a few others on board the flight.<br /><br />We also learn of the chaos that tears air traffic controllers apart as they try to determine the fate of a multitude of hijacked and possibly hijacked flights.  Who or what hit the Towers?  Where are those three other planes headed?  Why can't we get airspace clearance from the FAA.  Should we ground an entire nation's flight schedule?  Why is their no response from American 11?<br /><br />This is simply a moving film.  I almost didn't want to watch it because I didn't know how I'd react.  I'll admit that I cried a lot.  I was also very, very angered by the actions of the cowards on the flight.  Yet in the end I was glad to have watched this film.  It showed just how strong the American spirit can be.  Even though the brave souls on United 93 were well aware of their impending fates, they came together to save the lives of so many others.<br /><br />This single-disc edition provides a trailer for "Twin Towers" and an hour-long documentary with interviews of surviving family members of the heroes on Flight 93.  It also has a memorial with a brief biography of all of the heroes who perished defending their country and their fellow man.  Each biography is written by a family member or dear friend.<br /><br />This film will make you cry.  It will make you angry.  It will also make you proud.  You'll be proud that no matter what our enemies throw at us, we as Americans can and will find a way to defeat them.  Naysayers cannot deny the bravery displayed on United 93, nor can they erase the horrible events of September 11, 2001 from our memory, try as they might.</p></br><a href="../users/A1SVXJZ3386U2D.html">A1SVXJZ3386U2D</a><br/><p>I had heard of "United 93" from enthusiastic viewers when it first came out.  I waited for it to come to our town but I kept waiting and waiting until I finally asked the theater owner what the delay was all about.  He said that they weren't going to show it because there hadn't been any demand for it.  I said that he ought to at least show it for a week and find out for sure but it never came.  I had heard that it was intense and realistic and, of course, most of us already knew what "United 93" was about just from the title.  I had also heard that it was rather low-budget; no "names" in the cast, the camera-work seemed hand-held, and a few other comments that are usually reserved for "B movies".  However, despite whatever disclaimers I heard, I also understood that the film had an impact on those who saw it.<br /><br />I rented "United 93" the other night and I am still immersed it.  This movie is very professionally made and it grabs you right from the beginning.  There is a lot that we see unfolding before us that we already understand.  It is impressive how the air traffic controllers are intitially curious then mystified then appalled.  The film-makers could have just assumed the audience knew all the background (which we still do) and focus on the lives of the victims leading up to climax of the taking and retaking of the plane.  In other words, they could have made the typical Hollywood disaster film.  By retracing the events of 9/11 sequencially we relived the event and found a conclusion to the one aspect that remained a mystery.<br /><br />I do not know how much the film relied on second-hand witness accounts (the film reminds us of the many calls to loved ones from the passengers on board).  I don't recall if the black box was recovered in tact.  However, I was satisfied with the reaction of the paasengers and their conclusion of hijacking.  These were not people portrayed as heroic.  Rather, they were portrayed like ourselves as people independently traveling for reasons of their own.  The development of a group focus was excellently done and the ultimate sacrifice that they made for ourselves and themselves was the chaotic effort of amateurs with a cause.<br /><br />For many of us, 9/11 was a mixture of anger, sorrow, fear and insecurity.  Yet there was courage and pride in that mix as well.  From the NY Police Departments to the NY Fire Departments to the passengers of United 93 we had a lot to be proud of.  Nothing I've seen brings that out as much as the movie "United 93".</p></br><a href="../users/AIFXFHO2N9WJB.html">AIFXFHO2N9WJB</a><br/><p>On September 11th, 2001, our nation was changed forever. Terrorists from overseas came to our land and dealt us with a devastating blow, attacking the twin towers of the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. As the terrorists thought we were down for the count, we did what we've done so many times before, we came back stronger and paid them back in full, and are continuing to do so through the war on terror. In 2006, two films were released that chronicled certain events from that day, one was Oliver Stone's ("Any Given Sunday" and "Alexander") heartfelt tribute to the rescue efforts at Ground Zero in "World Trade Center", and the other was the documentary-style "United 93" from director Paul Greengrass ("The Bourne Supremacy" and "The Bourne Ultimatum"). The latter of which is the film that I will be discussing here.<br /><br />"United 93" tells the powerful story of the passengers aboard the last hijacked flight who thwarted the terrorists from delivering another deadly blow to our country. As 3 hijacked planes had hit their intended targets, the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, the fourth plane landed in a field, unsuccessfully finding its target. On that tragic morning it seemed as if nothing could stop the terrorist plot, but as the passengers aboard flight 93, via cell phone conversations with loved ones, were quickly learning of what had been transpiring on the ground, they knew they had to do something. Because the only way their flight wasn't going to be turned into another deadly weapon was for them to rise up as one, and fight back!<br /><br />Many people felt that even after 5 years, it was still too soon to chronicle the events of that tragic day on film. Some even thought that the events should never be put to film, because for some the wound would never heal. For those people I have nothing but sympathy for them, and I completely understand why they would not want to see this film, or "World Trade Center". However, for the rest of us, I believe that this film and it's counterpart serve as chilling reminders of that day, of what evil actually lurks around in our world, but also of the incredible courage and indomitable will of the American spirit.<br /><br />With "United 93", acclaimed director Paul Greengrass, serving as both writer and director for the film, has crafted a very moving, incredibly realistic account of what may have transpired aboard that flight. Many of the scenes were based on cell phone conversations between the passengers and their relatives, what was heard on the cockpit recordings, and the rest was based on family members descriptions of what their loved ones were like throughout their lives. Compiling all of these elements together, Greengrass has made "United 93" into a film that honors those brave souls that sat down as strangers and stood up as one.<br /><br />Assisting Greengrass in honoring those victims of 9/11, was a cast of extremely talented, yet unknown actors and actresses that were given the unenviable task of playing these people in this highly emotional time, and not disrespecting their memory or their surviving families. Even though the actors/actresses were not a who's-who of Hollywood, they all handled each of their parts just as good as any A-lister, delivering such heartfelt emotion and depth in every performance. A truly magnificent job on all of their parts, I honestly believe that they did an exemplary job of honoring the memory of the people they were portraying.<br /><br />I know that many of the families of the victims of that day may never see this movie, but should they ever see it, I believe that they will be honored by the performances of the actors, and the very realistic and moving film that Paul Greengrass has assembled. For those of you out there that feel you don't need to see this movie to remember that day, I understand you viewpoint, but I truly believe you should one day choose to watch this film so that you can remember that even in our darkest hour, there are those who will choose to be heroes.<br /><br />"United 93" is rated R for violence and language.</p></br><a href="../users/AVCRD98TH48RN.html">AVCRD98TH48RN</a><br/><p>Writing the title of my review just now gave me chills.  Awesome!  This movie works on every level imaginable.  It is a masterful, technical achievement that is impressive througout under the supremely talented eye of director Paul Greengrass.  His Oscar-nomination for his work here is more than justly deserved. I sincerely hope he wins.  The characters are all humanistic and easy to care about.  Even the terrorists, who embark on a crime against humanity, come across as real people who sincerely believe in what they are doing.  Creepy.  There is the underlying tension at the beginning as passengers and crew board the doomed flight, and one cannot help but hope the plane never takes off at all, that some technical problem will keep the plane grounded and safe; the people aboard returned to their families.  The idea of using hand-held cameras throughout the movie intitially turned me off from seeing this film.  Normally, under most circumstances, I despise hand-held camera-work as it comes across as amateurish and annoying.  But in this film the increasing tension aboard the plane makes use of hand-held cameras more kinetic.  Using absolutely no "name actors" in the movie also adds to the effect of feeling like one of the passengers.  The acting from the entire cast is superb.  Watching this film made me feel as though I were re-living 9/11 all over again.  This film is terrifying, exhilirating to the point you want to scream, and outstanding filmmaking in every way.  This is a special film.</p></br><a href="../users/A129YBX5BVNW2.html">A129YBX5BVNW2</a><br/><p>I can remember the first time I saw "United 93" - I was stunned and intensely moved. Released less than five years after the events of September 11, 2001 - the wounds were still raw. Yet the film was sentiment and opinion free - visceral to the extreme - and painfully, brutally honest - and of course all the more admirable for it.<br /><br />Written and Directed by PAUL GREENGRASS - it had the most difficult material in the world to deal with - fraught with all sorts of depiction dangers and accusations of a crass cash-in. And yet it succeeded on every level. Come the last 15 minutes - your hurt is pretty much uncontrollable and the tears are flowing for real.<br /><br />It arrived not surprisingly on BLU RAY on the 10th Anniversary of the event (Sept 2011) - and here it is again (June 2012) on a BLU RAY/DVD/DIGITAL DOWNLOAD combo-pack as part of Universal's 100th Anniversary celebrations in the generic card-wrap packaging associated with that huge series of reissues (see comment section for full list). And I'm glad to say it boasts a proper upgrade in picture quality and 'bonus material' which is not just respectful - but equal in power to the movie itself...<br /><br />It opens with four men in an apartment block. Dressed like a Middle Eastern businessman, the leader of the group squints underneath his immaculately clean reading glasses. But Ziad Jarrah is nervous - and as he breathily chants prayers over his Koran - even seems troubled. But a face that has no such qualms interrupts Ziad. It's Ahmed Al Haznawi - who will later hold the flight at bay with a knife he's smuggled into his belt. The al-Qaeda radical fixes Ziad with a steely gaze and says - "It's time."<br /><br />And so begins their infamous journey - driving to the airport - parking their cars - checking-in with minimal luggage - getting through the security monitors - and eventually boarding "United 93" - an early-morning non-stop flight from Newark International to San Francisco. Hours later - 33 passengers and 7 flight crew are fighting back - desperately trying to retake the cockpit from Ziad and Ahmed. But despite their valiant efforts - the Boeing 757 nosedives into a field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania at 10:03 am. And of the four aircraft hijacked and sacrificed that horrible day, it was the only one 'not' to reach Osama Bin Laden's presumed target (The White House, Washington DC).<br /><br />Why does "United 93" work? First up - Greengrass begins with the everyday - the 'ordinary'. In the waiting area - Thomas Burnett makes a business call as he eyes his polished shoes - while a dehydrated Nicole Miller applies lip-gloss once on board. Equally beautiful and seated for take-off, hostess Cee Cee Lyles regrets having not brought enough magazines for her to read on a 5-hour long haul flight - while passengers Patrick Driscoll and his friend William Cashman (70 and 60) plan a hiking holiday to Yosemite National Park from a colour brochure. Hilda Marcin asks politely for a glass of water so she can swallow her medication with her breakfast - while a man opens his laptop on the seat rest in front of him with a relaxed air. A 20-year old Deora Bodley is trying to do just that - she fixes a makeshift pillow on the headrest of her seat - and leaving her headphones in - tries to get some shut-eye. And up in the cockpit while on autopilot - First Officer LeRoy Homer talks to Captain Jason Dahl as they eat their meals from plastic trays about a London holiday he's planning for his wife and their new 11-month old baby. Every scene is humdrum - and of course real - and therefore incredibly unsettling...<br /><br />Second is the cast. There are no big names in the lead roles (some of the actors are vaguely familiar like Christian Clemenson from "Boston Legal" but most are not). Greengrass then combines their largely unknown faces with real people who were actually there on the day - Ben Sliney of Herndon Air-Traffic Control, Thomas Roberts of Boston ATC, Curt Applejack of New York ATC and Major John Fox heads up the military. Along with other staff members, the effect is like watching the events unfold in front of you - but in real-time.<br /><br />The music by JOHN POWELL is also used sparingly - but when it's applied - it packs either an incredibly sinister punch or ups your pulse-rate big time.<br /><br />Then there's the astonishing editing. The camera moves behind people's heads as they run down corridors - we get momentary glimpses of worried faces through gaps in clothing - there's close-ups on sweating foreheads which then in turn pull back onto disbelieving faces. There's side profiles of personnel constantly making and answering phonecalls - desperately trying to get a grip on the escalating panic. Speech quickens as the chaos escalates - and it all ratchets up the tension to the nines. So when the horror finally comes - it's devastating.<br /><br />The first sign of trouble is American Airlines Flight 11, which stops responding to hails from Air-Traffic Control and then disappears off radar over New York (it's gone into the North Tower of the World Trade Centre). Then an officer examines a tape of what was transmitted from the cockpit - he works out that the word 'planes' is used and not 'plane' - as in plural. With 4000 aircraft in the sky - their terror is palpable. Then it gets really ugly. The second of the hijacked aircraft (United 175) finally appears on the New York skyline outside their observation tower. But instead of making an emergency landing - and as they watch - it flies at escalated speed and smashes directly into the South Tower - bursting into flames. Now both buildings are on fire. The moment of silent disbelief that follows in the Control Room is heart-stopping.<br /><br />The script is fast and punchy too. Wisely Greengrass avoided conspiracy theories in his construction but did include factual details. The American military's Airforce NORAD was conducting a drill on that morning (of all mornings) and was informed by the FAA of the hijackings. At 08:46 a.m. they scrambled four F-15 fighter planes from Otis Air National Guard Base in Massachusetts to enter New York airspace, but politicians denied them 'engage' orders. Controversy has raged ever since. But again, Greengrass doesn't discuss this. He just shows the pandemonium at every level of authority while at the same time concentrating on what matters - the 'people' - and especially their eventual bravery - when they realized they weren't going to be any negotiations and they had to stop fanatics killing even more innocents.<br /><br />Some words now on the bonus material - the 2006 UK single DVD had 3 'Extras' - "United 93: The Families And The Film" (60-minutes), a feature-length commentary by Paul Greengrass and "Memorial Pages" - passengers and crew remembered with 40 written biographies. However, an American 2 DVD set put out in 2007 provided more. Added on were - "Flight 93 National Memorial", "Chasing Planes - Witnesses To 9/11" and "Twin Towers". This BLU RAY has all 6 features. The "Families" documentary in particular is extraordinary - where the actors meet the families with often beautiful results. Those who've lost someone are permanently hurting people - and acknowledgement/discussion of this by anyone other than the authorities (who have to appear to care) is hugely cathartic. In between the interviews are a lot of family photos and home movies - so be prepared for sadness as well as celebration.<br /><br />To sum up - given the ultra-sensitivity of the material - "United 93" is a fantastic film and a major achievement for all involved. It's also a worthy reissue in Universal's 100th Anniversary series on BLU RAY/DVD with well thought-out and fitting extras that both enhance and inform.<br /><br />I just wish it hadn't taken so many lost lives to produce something of worth and beauty. May they rest in peace...<br /><br />BLU RAY Specifications:<br />ASPECT: 1080p High Definition Widescreen 2.35:1<br />AUDIO: English DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1, French, Canadian French, German, Spanish, Latin American Spanish, Italian, Japanese DTS 5.1<br />SUBTITLES: English SDH, French, Canadian French, Italian, German, Spanish, Latin Amer4ican Spanish, Japanese, Korean, Swedish, Danish, Finnish, Dutch, Norwegian, Portuguese, Greek, Traditional Mandarin<br /><br />PS: as an aside - but related to 9/11...<br />I urge to check out a video on YouTube called "Regret" by THE BLUE NILE. Apparently collated and posted by a fan that wanted to say something about the atrocity on its 10th Anniversary - the video uses one of this superlative Scottish band's lesser-known tunes - "Regret". The song originally turned up as a UK non-album B-side to the 12" single of the "Tinseltown In The Rain" from 1984 on Linn Records. It's only LP/CD appearance to my knowledge is a 1991 compilation called "The Tree And The Bird And The Fish And The Bell - Glasgow Songs By Glasgow Artists". It's hard to find but worth hunting down.<br /><br />"Regret" is played against a backdrop of black and white images from that tragic event. Recorded years before in a country some 6000 miles away (and of course about something entirely different) it somehow fits perfectly - both musically and lyrically. Words from it title this review.<br /><br />More to the point (and I'll openly admit to this) - it moved me to tears.</p></br><a href="../users/A27H9DOUGY9FOS.html">A27H9DOUGY9FOS</a><br/><p>As we approached the end of 2006, everyone released their pick for the top films of that year. I do the same thing every year as I assess the movies that I've had the pleasure of viewing, either on the big screen or on DVD. 2006, in truth, wasn't the strongest year--but there were a fair share of surprises. While many of the blockbusters actually surpassed my expectations with unusual depth or sheer adrenaline, it is many of the smaller films that lingered in my memory. "United 93" was a moderate hit at the box office and received pretty universal critical acclaim, but there was not much expectation that it would fare well come awards season. It was released very early in the year which is usually problematic. However, to my delight--the film was remembered and honored as one of the year's top films and its reputation has endured and grown stronger.<br /><br />"United 93," for my money, was the best film of 2006. Sparse and powerful, this docudrama took about 90 minutes of real time to unfold one of the most matter-of-factly harrowing and heroic episodes put down on film. Far from being a political diatribe, the film documents a real humanity and the commonality that pulls ordinary people together in a time of crisis. Offering almost no commentary, "United 93" just presents the facts of the situation about that ill-fated flight. Reconstructed largely from actual participants and phone records, this is about as close to reality as a narrative film can get.<br /><br />In an audacious decision, director Paul Greengrass does not ask that we know the passengers or ground crew as individuals. You see them in brief, slice-of-life moments as they ready themselves for the day--but there is no backstory, no manufactured drama. It's just a cross section of regular men and women doing mundane things on what will become a most extraordinary day. You will start to know some of the individuals from their actions and their responses, but the film doesn't offer anything extraneous. This simplicity and lack of ordinary storytelling convention sets "United 93" apart.<br /><br />By allowing an objective viewpoint, the film achieves a power that is more inherently real than 99% of scripted films. There is an honor and dignity at work here that's quite unexpected. Even though the film plays with a documentary feel, it ends up almost impossible not to envision yourself in the same situation. As such, "United 93" strikes a real and resonant emotional chord. It's easy to only accept this film as a poignant document of that day and a tribute to those involved. And that it is. It's also easy for those who wish to dismiss it as a cover-up to conspiracy theories to do so. But what I don't want to get lost in any political debate is the fact that this is also great filmmaking.<br /><br />I was more affected by this film emotionally than any other film of that year. And I have reflected on it more often than any other film in recent years. For those reasons, "United 93" was easily my choice for best film of its year. Heartbreaking, Intelligent, Horrifying, Uplifting--It's perfect. KGHarris, 12/06.</p></br><a href="../users/A4SY5RCGC5CH9.html">A4SY5RCGC5CH9</a><br/><p>I lack words for describing correctly the effect this movie made on me. I was shocked beyond what I can describe and consider "United 93" as one of the best real events description moments in cinema history.<br /><br />Paul Greengrass decided to make this film in a totally non-Hollywoodian style and he was dead right on target. No famous names, no Hollywood stars and some real air controllers who were in service on September 11 play themselves. The story keeps (as much as I can judge) strictly to the events of the day and there is no typically American alterations (no little girls waiting for transplantation, etc.). The events on board of United 93, the plane where passengers rebelled against the terrorists and stormed the cockpit, are described based on the real telephonic conversations, radio transmissions and the record from the black box. Some more conversations had to be added, but they fit very much to the rest of the story.<br /><br />The terrorists are very well described, including their leader (the pilot) who actually hesitates about ten minutes before giving the order of attack - it seems he was the only one of the attackers who was married and was leaving somebody behind. Even this is deduced from the real events, because United 93 was indeed hijacked later after the take off, than the three other planes. The fight on board of the plane is extremely ugly and realistic - no Hollywood usual stuff again.<br /><br />The incredible conversations between the military air defence command and the Supreme Headquarters of the US Air Force are one of the high points of the movie, with the general in charge begging desperately for a permission to shoot the hijacked planes before learning, that the two fighters that he managed to send in the air on such a short notice are unarmed... etc, etc. This is a great, great description of a great tragedy and possibly the best illustration of the proverbial "fog of war" I ever seen.<br /><br />As one of the previous reviewers, me too I do not think I will ever see this movie again - not because it is bad, but because it is SOOOOO good. Be warned - this is a masterpiece, but it is heartbreaking and the tension is almost unsufferable...</p></br><a href="../users/A27P0MW8TE1JQP.html">A27P0MW8TE1JQP</a><br/><p>September 11th 2001, 4 planes were hijacked, 3 of them reached their targets, UNITED 93 is the story of the forth.<br /><br />JFK said "We must never forget that art is not a form of propaganda; it is a form of truth." After 9/11, many artists chose to respond to the horror and tragedy of the events  in the way they knew best - through their craft.  They drew their own line offering  photographs, sculpture, paintings, poetry,  and film that commemorate that day.  Their work, good or bad, will forever be a part of those events. So timing and quality is important. At just under 5 years since the destruction of the Twin Towers in NYC, and the crash of United 93 in a Pennsylvania field, is the time right. Maybe, it will never be right. "the Flight of United 93,"  although approved by the familes of the passagers, might be a story not yet ready to be told, or more accurately it might be a story not ready to be heard and seen. With public opinion of the handling of the War down, maybe the time is right for a film that depicts the courageous actions of passengers on the fourth hijacked plane.<br /><br /> Director Paul Greengrass thoughtfully undertakes the unenviable task of telling this pivotal chapter in the events of that tragic day. Greengrass, director of THE BOURNE SUPREMACY shoots UNITED 93 almost virtually in realtime as all 40 passengers and crew gather the morning of Sept. 11, 2001 to board United's flight from Newark to San Francisco. Along with the 40, are 5 men planning to use the plane as a weapon against the U.S. Capitol. Once it "becomes clear" that a hijacking has occurred passengers begin to sneak mobile calls, saying their goodbyes, but also discovering that 2 planes have already been rammed into the World Trade Center, confirming their worst fears. The passengers see no other choice than to risk confronting the hijackers to gain control of the plane. Greengrass, along with his superb cast and crew, reconstruct the events from factual information gained from cell calls, flight recorders,  the memories of families and ground controllers. Casting of mostly unknowns adds weight to the film, intensifying the haunting reality of the situation.<br /><br />This is no TV movie of the week. It is urgent, edgy, moving and ultimately a fitting memorial for the heroic passengers of flight United 93.<br /><br />Approved by the families of the passengers, a portion of proceeds goes to the FLIGHT 93 MEMORIAL FUND www.flight93memorialfund.org. The film was well received when it premiered at the Tribeca Film festival.<br /><br />Rated R for language and scenes of terror and violence.</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>In 2006 two major motion pictures about September 11, 2001 were released.  One, WORLD TRADE CENTER, was a film from Oliver Stone about two first responders who were saved from the wreckage of the World Trade Center.  Though WORLD TRADE CENTER is a good and solid film, it does not reach the achievement that Paul Greengrass was able to do with UNITED 93.<br /><br />Filmed in a style that seems to be a dreamy cinema verite (though every moment on film was carefully constructed), UNITED 93 tells the story about the one plane that went down on September 11th that didn't hit its target.  United 93 was supposed to have crashed either into the White House or the Capitol Building, but because of the bravery and courage displayed by the men and women on board, the plane never reached that area and crashed in a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania.  No one alive can say exactly for sure what happened aboard the plane that day.  However, UNITED 93 does an incredible job of recreating what possibly happened.<br /><br />Paul Greengrass and the filmmakers spent an incredible amount of time talking with the family members of those who died.  They listened intently to the tape recordings on board the plane and messages left behind.  I'm sure that hundreds of hours of research went into creating the film and it shows on film.  No big name actors were cast in the film and many of the smaller roles were played by people who had actually been involved somehow with United 93 on September 11th.  It is an ensemble cast of the truest kind.<br /><br />I was deeply moved while watching UNITED 93.  The outcome is already known before even putting the film into the DVD player.  Yet, the foreknowledge takes nothing away from the experience.  The people on the plane reminded me of some of my own friends and family members and even though I knew they were going to die, their actions as portrayed in the film gave me hope.  UNITED 93 is a powerful piece of cinema, testifying to what ordinary people can do when faced against extraordinary circumstances.  The Academy might have ignored it, but UNITED 93 is the best picture of 2006 and a fitting tribute to the men and women who died that day.<br /><br />The DVD includes a commentary with Director Paul Greengrass which I found much more interesting, intriguing, and thought-provoking than many other commentaries I have listened to.  There's also a short documentary entitled "United 93:  The Families and the Film" that interviews family members of those killed and their reactions to the film.  Finally, there is a biography page that includes a small picture and a written biography about the 40 people on board (not including the hijackers) who died because of the hijacking.</p></br><a href="../users/A1COG8T9MPP3KA.html">A1COG8T9MPP3KA</a><br/><p>At first I didn't think I could watch this film (a sneak preview), it was a horrendous day for everyone in the USA . At last, I  prepared myself to  watch United 93. This is a frightening reenactment  of what could have happened on the airplane that didn't make it's intended attack on Washington DC. It has always been easy for me to sit thru a fictional horror film or thriller. Because we know it is make believe and it is for entertainment.This movie strikes a new chord on the human soul. I didn't think I could handle it. But I am glad I did choose to see it.There were people who thought  this movie should not be released.<br /><br />Let me assure you. You will not leave the film depressed. It is uplifting in a way. Because of the heroic actions of the Americans in the film. It makes you proud to be an American. I highly recommend seeing it. Even for the families of the people on the plane. The director turns each passenger into a hero. It won't be easy to watch.

KGHarris, 12/06.</p></br><a href="../users/A27CHILBK6HIL2.html">A27CHILBK6HIL2</a><br/><p>MOVIE: Film, the most powerful form of expression. Paul Greengrass' United 93 was one of the most moving, terrifying, emotional, and profound movie-going experiences in my life. The film tells the tragic tale of flight 93, the only hijacked plane that never made its target. Historical accounts presented through film are a different type of viewing experience in that we the audience know the outcome. When I watch films like Saving Private Ryan, Pearl Harbor, Schindler's List, Platoon, and other historical films I am experiencing these events for the first time. I was born in 1987, so I never lived through a great war, never experienced one firsthand even though my generation is in the middle of one right now. Sepetember 11th affected all of us, whether we lost someone or not. This is the first film that current generations will experience as a recounting of a tragic event that we lived through. We watched the towers fall, the people jump from hundreds of stories above the concrete jungle. Now Paul Greengrass brings an intimate and very real look into the lives of a few strangers who decided not to sit back and stay quiet. The film sets the tone immediately as it opens a beautiful sunny day as people arrive at the airport, talking on their phones, reading the paper, and getting ready for their flights. We never learn the names of any of the people in the movie, and all of the actors were cast as "no name" actors. It was done for the sole reason of not to exploit this event, and to make it seem as realistic as possible. The film uses parallel editing and jumps back and forth to the unfolding events in the plane and the events in the various control rooms of the military and air traffic control. Greengrass' style is shakey documentary style filmmaking, and those who saw The Bourne Supremacy can recall that. This style works to perfection, and creates a sense of chaos and confusion in the control rooms where 50 people are running around trying to comprehend what happened. They turn on CNN to see one of the towers in flames, later they witness the second plane hitting the next tower. Silence falls, and as I sat in my seat I began to tremble with my eyes beginning to water. We jump back to the plane where Greengrass places the camera as if it were the point of view of one of the passangers. All these passengers are strangers to each other, so they are strangers to the audience. The scenes on the airplane are terrifying, and will grip you and shake you at your core. The fear and the terror feels too real, I was so concentrated as I watched this film because it was so captivating and involving, and the only thing I can say to express my feelings is to quote one of the flight attendents on the plane, "I don't want to be here". The film is important, it's important because it brings new light to something so familiar. Is it too soon though? At first I thought so, but I realize now that it's not too soon at all. It still feels like it was yesterday that I watched the towers fall and the cloud of dust engulf New York City, images like that do not fade. So even 20 years from now people would still be saying it's too soon. The film doesn't deal with politics and is all about the courageous people who did the bravest thing any human being could do, and that is sacrifice their lives. Every American needs to see this film, it has to be seen no matter how uncomfortable it will make you feel. I watch movies like Saving Private Ryan to experience the past, in 20 years people my age will be doing the same with United 93. I am writing this review 4 hours after I saw the film, and I am still shaken by it. It feels like it happened all over again, but you know, it was worth it.<br /><br />ACTING: You won't be able to name any actors in this film, and it was casted like that for a purpose. If I was a WWII veteran and I watched Saving Private Ryan, I would probably say "That's Tom Hanks, he's an actor, he didn't fight in WWII". In this film you can't name any actor, and that makes it all the more real and you end up forgetting that you are watching a movie. The acting is superb, it's what drove the film. It must have been uncomfortable to film some of these scenes, the terror is genuinely real.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: "Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray. Do not go gentle into that good night. Rage, rage against the dying of the light." - Dylan Thomas. I leave you on that note.</p></br><a href="../users/A13E0ARAXI6KJW.html">A13E0ARAXI6KJW</a><br/><p>A most cathartic experience came over me when I viewed the much publicized "United 93". At once speculative and realistic, the 111-minute film will surely bring back the pall of fatalistic inevitability one feels about 9/11, but its more defining characteristic is revealing the untapped heroism and humanism of people caught in the most malevolent of circumstances. Masterfully written and directed by Paul Greengrass, this relentlessly intense movie covers that fateful morning when United Airlines Flight 93 departed Newark for San Francisco with 33 passengers and seven crew members on board.<br /><br />As it turns out, Greengrass's heavy background in documentaries turns out to be a blessing in this treatment, as he tracks the subsequent events in real time and uses either under-the-radar actors or actual aviation personnel to play the real-life characters. Instead of focusing on the higher profile passengers to provide an emotional locus, which a more commercial filmmaker would have done, he encompasses all the passengers within the emotional purview of the film, including the four hijackers who killed the pilots and took control of the plane. The key dramatic difference is that we get to know not the people but the situation at hand. Consequently, we get a more realistic sense of the scale of the events that may have occurred on that flight. That's not to say it is any less devastating. In fact, the last half-hour is harrowing in the most personal sense as the inevitable becomes reality.<br /><br />The power of the film comes from its surprisingly apolitical perspective and the inclusion of the ground personnel trying to comprehend the scope of all the redirected planes that day, in particular, Ben Sliney who effectively plays himself that day, the just-promoted supervisor of the National Air Traffic Control Center in Herndon, Va. None of the actors stand out because the film cumulatively achieves a verisimilitude that simply knocks me out. It also does not pretend to be the definitive version of what happened on the last few moments of the flight. In an emotional sense, such controversy is rather moot as we are talking about degrees of detail at that point. This is truly essential viewing.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R8PXSFGY9MC2.html">A3R8PXSFGY9MC2</a><br/><p>'United 93' is the powerful and moving look at the events on September 11th 2001. It focuses on the air traffic control centres that had to deal with the hijacked planes, the military response, as well as the events on flight United 93. I found this film moved very quickly and I was engrossed throughout. You get a real sense of the panic and confusion on that day and it goes some way to showing how difficult it must have been to deal with as it occurred. I was concerned this film would be pro American and biased, but it didn't seem to excessive in that respect and it gave the film all the more impact because of that. I found myself extremely choked up when the passengers on the flight were ringing relatives to say goodbye and couldn't even begin to imagine having to do something like that. The ending is full of drama and very powerful and although we have no way of truly knowing every event on that flight, this goes some way to portraying the fears and events that may have occurred. The film is excellently directed, the soundtrack works perfectly to move you and the acting is pretty good as well. Highly recommended indeed.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></br><a href="../users/A140XH16IKR4B0.html">A140XH16IKR4B0</a><br/><p>Using naturalistic language and a dearth of narrative tricks like foreshadowing, "United 93" shows how 9/11 developed from the POV of the hijackers, passengers on the plane, the flight controllers and the military personnel trying to get fighters into the air. I know the film was carefully scripted and blocked, but the sense you get is of the confusion and lack of coordination on the ground from men and women trying their best to grapple with a situation they were not prepared for. On the plane, each passenger is lovingly recreated by actors, though there is no attempt to exactly replicate situations or conversations. Even the hijackers were given realistic personalities, being jumpy, nervous and menacing as the occasion demanded.<br /><br />The bonus materials were great, with interviews where family members told of their loved ones and got to meet the actors playing them.<br /><br />If it didn't happen this way, it was pretty darned close.</p></br><a href="../users/A175GIISFGGO31.html">A175GIISFGGO31</a><br/><p>Wow.  This is the real deal folks....the unvarnished depiction of these savage killers and a handful of ordinary Americans who banded together and performed an extraordinary act of heroism.<br /><br />A great movie....but as I mentioned....this is the real deal....quite a bit of violence so put the little ones to bed and prepare yourself for an unforgettable movie.</p></br><a href="../users/AW99SBGWEXP0J.html">AW99SBGWEXP0J</a><br/><p>"United 93" is the first major motion picture to be released since 9/11 to deal with the events of that day.  Focusing on the plane that did not reach its target, the film moves in almost real time from take off to the crash landing in Pennsylvania.  Writer-Director Paul Greengrass has taken pains to be as accurate as possible, and when the story veers into the unknown, the story told is very plausible.<br /><br />The actors are mostly unknowns, preventing any one person from distracting the viewer from the story.  This was a wise choice by Greengrass, and is successful in keeping the viewer focused on the story.  The actors all do good jobs, even though none are developed excessively.  This, combined with the hand held camera work gives the film a more intimate feel, as if you are there among them on the plane.  Greengrass received 100% support from the families, and a substantial number of the people on the ground play themselves in the movie.  That alone should speak of the quality of the film.<br /><br />"United 93" is a tense, gut-wrenching movie of a group of people and their determination to stop four evil men who wanted to bring America to its knees.  Is it too soon?  I say no...it is never to soon to remember the heroic things that that the passengers did.  They should be remembered and honored as heros.  "United 93" does just that.  This is a must see movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A359IT81FBX64Y.html">A359IT81FBX64Y</a><br/><p>By themselves, courage and intelligence are not so rare. But to see these two qualities combined is inspirational and reminds me of what good leadership is all about: taking the best course of action under difficult and frightening circumstances. Even after the passengers of United 93 had learned about the Twin Towers, it would have been "easy" for them to sit it out and hope for a different outcome - a safe landing, hostage negotiations. Fearful hope can be blind, but enough of the passengers were not blinded. They not only faced the terrible truth; they acted on it. It is this kind of courage and intelligence that makes me proud not just to be an American, but to be a human being. I can't imagine a better tribute to the passengers of United 93 and to all the other victims on that tragic day.<br /><br />More to the film itself, this is an excellent production done with good judgment and finesse. I am glad that we didn't wait twenty years or longer to make it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EEUQ81DTY7G3.html">A2EEUQ81DTY7G3</a><br/><p>I guess we can all remember what we were doing on that day five years ago. Now we have Paul Greengrass's explosive movie United 93 to yet again remind us of how that fateful day played out. Set up very much like a documentary, and taking place in real time, United 93 puts you right there onboard United Airlines Flight 93, the fourth hijacked plane on Sept. 11, 2001, which crashed in a Pennsylvania field, just short of its intended target - probably the Capitol Building.<br /><br />For the crew, the passengers, and indeed the air traffic controllers in both Boston and New York, the day started like any other. In New York it was a beautiful summer's morning as the intended passengers for United Flight 93 arrived at La Guardia, ready to fly home to San Francisco. The pilots make small talk, while the air stewards' joke about personal stuff. People are seen working on laptops and talking into cell phones as the plane is loaded up with jet fuel. Mark Bingham arrives late just as the plane is finishing boarding.<br /><br />Little do the passengers know that sitting amongst them at the departure gate are four young men of Middle Eastern descent who intent to hijack the plane and use it as a suicide missile. Unfortunately, due to heavy traffic the flight is late leaving, but once it's in the air, the hijackers seem to breath a sigh of relief. We watch as they wait and wait for it seems like forever to make their move, and then, once they do, we also observe as the passengers realize the World Trade Center has been hit after talking with their loved ones on the ground.<br /><br />Meanwhile, during these breathless, heart-stopping moments, the film cuts away to the desperation and confusion in airport control towers, the FAA's overwhelmed operations command center in Herndon, Va., and the military's unprepared operations center at the Northeast Air Defense Sector in upstate New York. One of the air traffic controllers in Boston suddenly realizes that American Airlines flight 11 has been hijacked after he hears what he thinks is someone speaking Arabic.<br /><br />His boss acts in disbelief as technicians try frantically to figure out what's happening, and only slowly does the full scale of the morning's pandemonium become viciously, dreadfully clear. For all their monitors and electronic equipment, there is a horrific, low-tech moment when controllers at Newark Airport get a perfect view across the Hudson of the second plane hitting a World Trade Center tower. No one can even speak; everyone is so numb with disbelief at what they are seeing.<br /><br />Using tight jump cut editing, Greengrass skips backwards and forwards between the chaos and lack of communication between the FAA and NORAD and the panicked and then determined passengers who decide to do something about the situation. Obviously, we will never know exactly what happened on the flight. There is evidence from phone calls made from the plane and that's where it ends, but at least we know something monumental took place. Greengrass does a superb job of showing us what very likely did happen.<br /><br />United 93 is just so deeply rooted in reality - no A-list stars here, with the actors largely unknowns. This adds to the authenticity of events as they transpire. Any conversations are overheard in fragmented snippets, and the actors often trip over their pointedly inarticulate dialogue with unrehearsed freshness. You never feel like you're watching a movie, rather you feel like you're just there. The film is indeed a masterpiece and a fitting testament to these ordinary heroes whose defiance and willingness to stand-up to the terrorists is made so palpable. Mike Leonard September 06.</p></br><a href="../users/ARA48345JZPZR.html">ARA48345JZPZR</a><br/><p>I was just going to write a review of United 93 praising the work of Paul Greengrass in presenting this story with great intelligence and sensitivity.  His choices throughout the film are exceptionally astute and the film is gripping, terrifying and sad.  There is a feeling of numbing dread in the early scenes of the passengers boarding the flight alongside the hijackers that is excruciating.  Normal people, going about their lives, unaware of the terror we know is about to befall them.<br /><br />As I said, I applaud the choices the film-makers have made, and this is a fine film that should be seen by many.  I found it stunning.<br /><br />I likewise find stunning several of the jaw-dropping one star reviews I have just read here, motivated by and pumped full of their ridiculous and absurd conspiracy theories.  I was equally dismayed to see how many positive votes this rubbish has received.  Not only are these mental cases ill-informed, but their insensitivity to the families of the people who died on this flight in spewing their deranged crackpot views into this public forum is beyond bad taste.  I imagine they are likewise,  beyond shame.</p></br><a href="../users/AUSATFDSU2INS.html">AUSATFDSU2INS</a><br/><p>Director Paul Greengrass has accomplished the difficult task of making what will possibly be the definitive filmed version of the unthinkable events surrounding Flight United 93 on September 11, 2001.<br /><br />United 93 does not offer analysis or explanation. The movie just lives inside those astonished 90 minutes of horror between one moment and the next one.<br /><br />The film takes place in virtual real time, cutting among the events on-board United Flight 93, which was the only plane of the four hijacked that morning not to reach its target, and the escalating confusion on the ground. As much as 9/11 was a worldwide televised event, Greengrass manages to evoke new horrors by taking us inside the confusion, showing us how the scenario was slowly put together by those who were in a position to do something about it.<br /><br />There is a masochistic quality to watching the film, as we enter the theater knowing fully well aware of the horrors we are about to witness. For we all know, or think we know, how the story of United 93 comes out.<br /><br />But what happens at the end of the story? Greengrass evidently disagrees with Bush's implications that the passengers committed an act of self-immolation. In the director's vision, the passengers have a naive idea of using a passenger, a trained pilot, to bring the plane down to the ground. But it's clear that Greengrass's refuses to confirm that without the passengers' action they would have hit the Capitol. On the contrary, his script shows the terrorists making a miscalculation of their own.<br /><br />The film develops slowly, beginning in the early morning hours as the four hijackers prepare themselves for what they feel it's their duty. We get images of Newark airport, the passengers, unaware that they future does not behold a happy ending. The air traffic controllers, several of whom are portrayed by their real-life counterparts, are going about their everyday business until the horror shows in their screens.<br /><br />From there, the film escalates as we know it did, until Greengrass finally abandons the world on the ground and concentrates the film's final moments entirely on the plane. It is here that Greengrass's amazing restraint and respect shows up, as he presents the victims as a group of terrified people facing a certain death making a desperate decision to change their own fate. There are no goofy-corny subplots and made up characters. There is no sense of heroism or national duty, but rather the jittery, horrifying sense of seeing your own death approaching. It's hard, it's sad and overwhelming, but still, it's something that we should see, so we never forget the horrors those innocent human beings were exposed without any justification.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ALOIPRR8Q06J.html">A1ALOIPRR8Q06J</a><br/><p>You want reality? People want to talk about a movie being realistic and people talk about real events being movie-like. People that were even at historic events will say "it was like a movie". How can you ever know what it would be like to be on a plane that you and everyone on board knows is going to crash? You can't. It transcends waking consciousness. It still can be imagined, however. It can be portrayed in such a way as to give you the viewer *some* idea -I really believe this after seeing UNITED 93. And it is scary as hell. If you allow yourself to be absorbed by this film I feel you'll come as close as a movie can take you in having some sense -just some- of the sheer terror. You are going to die. It's over. It is over. Your life is gone. You begin to realize this. At first there is denial of coarse but one way or another reality sets in for you. You will never see your family again. You will never eat again, hug your child again, go to the park again, go to the movies again, make love again, nothing. Your going to die in the worst way. You are about to be broken, ripped apart, burned. What awaits you? Are you even able to think or you just overcome? The horror. The flood of emotion, of thoughts, images, your life flashing before you. People freaking out around you. Murderous little foreign relgious nuts, creeps with box cutters stabbing people. What are you going to do? What do you do? What can you do? You'll never really know unless your in that situation. Some people on that plane decided not to just sit there and wait to die. That's not too bad a way to go out. UNITED 93 is a fine film and does justice to this historic moment in American history. Credit is to be given to director Paul Greengrass [THE BOURNE SUPREMACY, THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM, and the upcoming GREEN ZONE(!)] for his talents in depicting real-life events in such an outstanding way.<br /><br />Watch it alone or with someone who can sit through a movie without running their mouth. Turn the lights off, turn the cell phone off, shut up, and sit there straight through, no interruptions. But don't buy it, it's a rental. I don't know why or how someone would want to sit through this ride multiple times. One, maybe two trips is enough.</p></br><a href="../users/A2582KMXLK2P06.html">A2582KMXLK2P06</a><br/><p>I'm going to be honest- it would feel really weird if I were to say I enjoyed this movie.  No, it was not a movie you can enjoy- it was a movie you can watch, and get a feeling of American history.  It's an important movie that anyone who was around in 2001 can understand.  It was such a horrible day, and this movie did a really good job at showing us *probably* what happened on that flight.<br /><br />No one knows exactly what happened on that flight, but I'm guessing the creators used the phone calls from the people on the flight to gather information in order to make this movie.  For example, as someone was calling home to a relative or a friend, I'm guessing they used the sounds they heard in the background and put the pieces together to make up what probably happened, without being entirely sure.  No one knows for sure that the passengers used a giant tray to block the terrorists inside the cockpit, but maybe sounds were heard in the background that led to that being a possibility, since we have tapes of the phone calls being made.  Hey, I may be wrong, and I apologize if I am.<br /><br />Well, I felt I needed to watch this movie and see what happened that horrible day, and maybe get a better idea of what may have happened on that flight.  The only thing I can say is that this is a movie that needs to be watched.</p></br><a href="../users/AYBL30P5NXNZ4.html">AYBL30P5NXNZ4</a><br/><p>This movie is intense, realistic, unflinching and moving.  That is not to say it is a fantastic film - it is efficient and appropriate to the subject matter, but is definitely not shot in a cinematic style - it is claustrophobic and more interested in authenticity of characters and events than in exciting style - as well it should be.  This works perfectly as you are never taken out of the feeling that you are actually watching the events unfold.<br /><br />The movie is essentially a real time depiction of events on the plane, along with corroborating scenes in air traffic control, and especially the relatives on the receiving end of phone calls from the planes.  The script and what we see has been hung primarily on the phone calls made from the plane on mobiles and air phones, giving the events a horrible authenticity.  It is not the memory of two dimensional bad guys on a suicide mission you remember - the politics and response are not addressed here - it is above all the trauma and agonising loss of the people left on the ground that you remember - the real cost of the loss of United 93. It is impossible to watch and not imagine you and your loved ones in that situation - and this is where the film is a success, it makes a huge geopolitical terrorist event something personal and real to each of us.<br /><br />A story of heroism in the face of tragedy that is an essential watch.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MQQI4UYT9C11.html">A2MQQI4UYT9C11</a><br/><p>Everyone knew how this one would come out, but it was still one of the most emotionally wrenching movies I've ever seen.  The theater was absolutely silent as the story of the 4th hijacked plane on September 11 ended with a blackened screen as United Airlines Flight 93 crashed into a field near Schwenksville, PA.  The use of unknown actors (including some actual participants at the various air and defense command centers) along with admirable dramatic restraint (the famous "let's roll" is whispered) by the director combine to put the viewer right in the middle of the most infamous day in recent history.</p></br><a href="../users/AEMZRE6QYVQBS.html">AEMZRE6QYVQBS</a><br/><p>The lives of the crew and passengers of United Flight 93 were extinguished when the Boeing 757 in which they were traveling plowed into Pennsylvania farmland on September 11, 2001. UNITED 93 pays them apt tribute.<br /><br />This film takes a different approach than A&E's FLIGHT 93 - released almost simultaneously - and is in my judgment the better of two fine films. The dizzying flight from one civilian and military group trying to make sense of the incomprehensible and fast-moving events of that autumn morning helps the viewer feel in his marrow the sheer confusion that reigned. I do not think that confusion should be mistaken for incompetence in a nation unaccustomed to attacks on its own soil, and this film arguably allows the facts to stand without damning interpretation.<br /><br />It is horrifying to watch the passengers' reconstructed predicament on the plane, and FLIGHT 93 does not avert its gaze from the fact that not all passengers might have agreed with the plan to take aircraft back. I am still shaking minutes after the film's conclusion, which starkly mimics the stubbornness of impact.<br /><br />I find the juxtaposition of doomed victims praying the Lord's Prayer minutes before their death with the recitation of Koranic verse by the murderers who killed them unhelpful, but perhaps this bit of poetic license was not--as it might appear--intended to suggest a moral equivalence between those two very different acts of faith.<br /><br />More horrifying than the A&E project, this film should be seen but  younger viewers are not likely to benefit from the horror it so movingly portrays.<br /><br />One might, I suppose, pick up this DVD for voyeuristic purposes. Alternatively, it is a good thing for one hundred twenty minutes to stare evil and innocence in the face, to distinguish clearly between the two, and then to return to real life to live out one's choice.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FDW1SPYKB354.html">A1FDW1SPYKB354</a><br/><p>When I sat down to watch the DVD of "United 93" I knew it was going to be a very good movie (based on other reviews I'd heard about the film and hearing people talking about it) -- but I was somewhat unprepared for the large emotional impact it was going to make. (And a physical impact as well; I was practically sweating bullets by the end of this movie.)<br /><br />"United 93", written and directed with flawlessly-executed craftsmanship by Paul Greengrass, is easily the most powerful, the most riveting, and the most gut-wrenching film I have ever watched in my lifetime. And I cannot imagine it being topped in those categories for quite some time (if ever).<br /><br />In what seems very nearly a literal way, Director Greengrass has succeeded in placing every member of the audience on board that San Francisco-bound United Airlines Boeing 757-200 (N591UA), which represented Flight #93 on the sunny morning of September 11, 2001.<br /><br />Every single frame of film that went through Mr. Greengrass' camera while photographing this motion picture has a "genuine" feel to it. It is so eerily realistic, it's almost impossible not to have your hands shaking while watching this entire movie. I felt like I was among the passengers who were trying desperately to crash into that cockpit and overtake the terrorist hijackers.<br /><br />The actors that the producers hired to portray the 40 passengers and crew members are each to be applauded separately (and collectively), in my personal opinion, for their realistic and spot-on performances in this movie. It's really hard to describe how good this whole cast is. All of the performances from the men and women who share this cast roster will move you to tears. The terror on board that aircraft is so real during this movie, it's nothing short of awe-inspiring.<br /><br />I'm finding it difficult typing this review, after just now having watched the film for the very first time, and having been transfixed by the impeccable way that Mr. Greengrass has brought this horrifying true story to the big screen in a thoroughly respectful, non-exaggerated, and non-exploitative manner.<br /><br />This movie is hard to watch, that is for sure. Knowing that the brutal things we're seeing unfold on the screen actually (and incredibly) did take place above the eastern United States on 9/11/01 is enough to make your head swim, and to literally take your breath away at times too. I found myself having to breathe deeply many times just to make it through the intense scenes of stark terror.<br /><br />It's difficult to watch, yes....but it's also impossible NOT to keep watching this remarkable motion picture once you've taken a look at just the first few minutes.<br /><br />And as far as being technically well-made....this film is probably second to none as far as the subject of "aviation" is concerned. I've seen quite a few movies centering on the subject of airplanes and aviation, but "United 93" is by far the most "technically accurate" movie I have ever seen from the standpoint of realistic airplane footage.<br /><br />In the many scenes that take place aboard the plane which represents the Boeing 757 twin-jet airliner that plunged into a Pennsylvania field at more than 500 MPH at 10:03 AM on September 11th, I felt as if I was watching a real-life hijacking unfold inside the cabin and flight deck of a 757 in flight. The way the plane moves, the way the sky looks outside the cabin windows, the view from the cockpit....everything was absolutely perfect....and extremely realistic-looking. It's as if Mr. Greengrass was somehow able to actually film the hijacking in progress on 9/11. Just incredible.<br /><br />------------------<br /><br />In addition to providing a sparkling Anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) print of "United 93", the 2-Disc Limited Edition DVD set from Universal Studios offers up some nice bonus supplements too, including......<br /><br />1.) A director's Audio Commentary track with Paul Greengrass.<br /><br />2.) "Chasing Planes: Witnesses To 9/11" -- A 48-minute documentary/featurette (only available on the Limited Edition DVD). This is a program focusing on the military and the air-traffic controllers and their response to the national emergency on 9/11.<br /><br />Ben Sliney of the National Air Traffic Command Center in Herndon, Virginia, is featured prominently throughout this well-done bonus documentary. Sliney, who was the National Operations Manager for the FAA on 9/11, plays himself in "United 93" (in what is a fairly big part), and he's excellent in the film too.<br /><br />Incredibly, September 11, 2001, was Mr. Sliney's very first day on the job as the FAA's National Operations Manager. He was the man who initially gave the order to halt all U.S. air traffic at approximately 9:45 A.M. (ET) on 9/11, just a few minutes after American Airlines Flight 77 hit the Pentagon.<br /><br />"Chasing Planes" also features a unique high-angle video clip of United Flight 175 approaching and hitting the south tower of the World Trade Center. It's footage of that horrible moment in history that was taken from an angle that I had previously never seen before.<br /><br />By the way, the "Chasing Planes" documentary on Disc #2 of the "LE" DVD is shown in Anamorphic Widescreen, even though the packaging incorrectly indicates "Full Frame 1.33:1".<br /><br />3.) "United 93: The Families And The Film" -- A very good 60-minute documentary centering on the families of several of the victims of Flight 93. (Anamorphic Widescreen; approx. 1.85:1.)<br /><br />4.) Memorial Pages (text biographies for all 40 victims of Flight 93).<br /><br />5.) A two-minute trailer for the 2003 short film "Twin Towers".<br /><br />------------------<br /><br />"United 93" is a movie that every American should take time out to watch. It's a slice of an American tragedy that will never be forgotten; and Mr. Paul Greengrass has made a truly phenomenal motion picture here. This film gets the highest possible recommendation from this writer.

I'm  gonna look at this as just a film, which seems appropriate enough, considering that that's what it is.<br /><br />As pretty much everyone has mentions, `United 93' manages to avoid pretty much all of the obvious potential  faults it could've had.  Realism is always of the utmost importance, and Greengrass doesn't sentimentalize the situation, and most significantly, the film is devoid of any apparent commentary or moral and simply presents the events flatly, assuming that they will speak for themselves.  I think Greengrass gets perhaps a bit too much credit for his straightforward presentation.  As far as I'm concerned this approach is a bare minimum requirement for the film to be any good at all.  Still, consider this requirement met.<br /><br />`United 93' is essentially two films in one, one excellent, the other okay.  These divisions come between the scenes actually on and involving United 93, and the scenes involving the FAA and air traffic controllers on the ground.  I'm less fond of the scenes on the ground, as they eventually prove to be somewhat dull and repetitive, because they consist of little more than a large number of people talking with one another, trying to figure out precisely what is going on and how to deal with it and so on.  I don't doubt that they're extremely accurate, and they are necessary to the film as a whole, seeing as how there just isn't enough going on in United 93 for it to carry a feature length film, but we definitely didn't need as much of this as we got.  Certainly, these scenes are sharply and professionally done, but there just isn't that much to them.<br /><br />The scenes on the plane itself are far better, though they too could probably stand to be trimmed ever so slightly.  Obviously, there's going to be an enormous amount of conjecture going on in these parts of the film, but it always feels extraordinarily real.  Greengrass does a particularly good job with the terrorists, not portraying them as utterly inhuman monsters, but not falsely trying to excuse their behavior.  The passengers themselves are realistically devoid of characterization--  There wouldn't have been any time for them to really get to know each other, so we see simply see them on the surface, identifying them by little more than their faces.<br /><br />Greengrass uses `documentary-style' filmmaking, meaning lotsa of wobbly, handheld camerawork to go along with some frantic editing in the confrontational scenes.  This is always a dangerous tactic cause if you do it poorly it's incredibly obnoxious, and makes the film utterly unbelievable. (i.e. Scenes shot this way often degenerate into a random juxtaposition of images with no comprehensible relation, and thus become totally cinematic and thus utterly unrealistic, on top of being just as annoying as hell.)  Fortunately, this method is used better here than in perhaps anything else I've seen, as it generates a real sense of chaos and claustrophobia while still remaining fairly easy to tell what's going on.  At it's best, particularly during the initial overthrow and the final rebellion, the film generates a sort of bleak, horrific intensity that has rarely been matched else where.  Of course, it's only operating at it's highest level in a few scenes, since most of the scenes on the plane are in anticipation of the conflict, but these other scenes are more eventful than one might anticipate, and the whole film is effectively suffused with a sense of dread and impending doom.  (One which, I believe, would still be there even if we didn't already know the outcome.)<br /><br />Frankly, I don't buy the assertion of so many reviewers and viewers that this is an `important' film.  How so?  To remind us or convince us that 9/11 was a very bad thing?  I must say, I already thought that.  Still, this is an intense, often fairly moving and very professionally made film that shows the potential of more realistic, less stylized and conventionalized form of cinema. Again, it could stand a few trims that would then heighten the impact, but what is here is certainly effective enough as it is.<br /><br />Grade: B+</p></br><a href="../users/A11KRMIA0ES88I.html">A11KRMIA0ES88I</a><br/><p>Emotional experience. Close-ups of passengers, terrorists and air traffic controllers put us in the events of 9/11. It comes back, planes flying into the Twin Towers and the Pentagon. We recall Todd Beamer and "Let's roll" although his call to arms is subdued. This is a sympathetic portrayal. Even the terrorists are human. They are nervous and shown muttering prayers. They believe in their twisted mission. A picture of the U.S. Capitol is posted in the cockpit, so we assume it was the target of the 4th plane.</p></br><a href="../users/A5A2QE6NECFR5.html">A5A2QE6NECFR5</a><br/><p>I think all of us old enough to realize what happened on 9/11/01 wondered if we could be brave on that last hijacked plane and help kill ourselves over Pennsylvania farmland instead of letting the criminals kill us at the White House or the Capitol. This film lets us sit in a seat in the plane, and in the chairs of air traffic controllers and others who had to try to figure out what the hell was happening that morning. No well-known actors are there to destroy the realism. No on-screen narration distracts from the confusion felt by the characters, all real folks. It's a movie one only needs to see once. When you see it, you get mad and sad all over again. Then you come back to 2007 and realize the guy who made it happen is still alive in Pakistan or Afghanistan or who knows where, more than five years later, probably laughing at our mess in Iraq and at the fact that even in Khandahar and Kabul we haven't fully defeated him. Could anyone have believed, on 9/12/01, that by 2007 Osama Bin Laden and his doctor friend/fiend/spokesman would still be alive and free, while these passengers and that crew are long dead and in danger of being forgotten?</p></br><a href="../users/AZCDCO6KK2T81.html">AZCDCO6KK2T81</a><br/><p>Reviewing this film is difficult as there seems to be several camps at work here that will find fault with whatever one writes about this important film.  I would like to take time to address these camps as in introduction to my review.<br /><br />Some argue that this moment in our history is so terrible, so ungodly, so inhumane and still so raw in our memory that any attempts by Hollywood to reproduce that time is an insult to the memory of the victims and shows Hollywood for all its callousness and greed.  I agree that some passage of time is necessary for us to heal from pain, but we can't ignore that the medium of film is a form of memorial as much as any plaque, statue, or monument.  In addition, one should recognize that film can be and often is a cathartic experience that allows us to express our hurt and, thus, aid in the healing process.  Therefore, it is not, in my view, so questionable for Hollywood to make a film about a fairly recent tragedy, but it is questionable whether boycotting such films serves the purpose intended by those who believe we should.<br /><br />Should we boycott such films as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00012QM8G">Schindler's List</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXTG">Pearl Harbor</a>, and  all other such films based upon true tragedies because one can view them as profiteering off of another's pain?  I would think that it is more important that we never forget the various tragedies in history and film does assist with that.  How about boycotting films about natural disasters, famous murders and murderers or films about those mentally or physically challenged?  Isn't someone profitting off of these tragedies as well?  Shouldn't we boycott them too?<br /><br />I think this is all just too extreme.  Yes, films need to make a profit, but that doesn't mean a film is devoid of purpose or that it can't be beneficial to many outside of weighing box-office receipts.  Can these films, while making a profit, not provide a fitting tribute to those victims and the survivors, and, in the end, provide some comfort?  I think so.<br /><br />The other problem with Hollywood, and it's been around since the silent era, is the viewpoint or vision presented by those making a film.  As far as a film being bias with the writer's or director's unique perspective, or an actor's interpretation of a character (real or not) is a rather moot point as that is a given with ANY film and, quite frankly, any work of art.  It is THEIR take on a topic just as an impressionistic painter is creating his view of something onto canvass.  The medium is different, but both have a right to their perspective.  I do agree, however, that when dealing with great human tragedy one must be very careful in how he interprets and presents facts, but one's personal bias can rarely ever be objectively overcome no matter the medium of expression.  If this is all new to you, then you need to stop watching films completely until you come to terms with this reality as this has been around since the dawn of film making.<br /><br />For those that criticize Hollywood for "taking advantage of the victims and their survivors" let's not ignore that the families connected to this film gave their stamp of approval for it to be made (Hollywood rarely ever even asks for that) and were extremely satisfied with the end result.  Also, a portion of the money made from this film benefits them (via a memorial).  That is rarely done in Hollywood and they deserve some praise for doing that.  So much for callous greed.  This also means that boycotting this film may actually be hurtful to these families that deserve whatever we can give them either monetarily or via a memorial.<br /><br />The other camp in relation to making films about historical tragedies finds that any criticism of the film an insult to the memory of the people in which the film relates.  Sadly, these folks have difficulty seeing the difference between criticizing a film and criticizing people or an event.  I was a bit disappointed with Oliver Stone's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JLTRKE">World Trade Center</a> for cinematic reasons, but I quickly found myself defending my own patriotism in the comment section of that review (that section has since been "edited").  I ran into similar issues when criticizing the recent Disney TV remake of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000059XV6">The Miracle Worker</a> (the true story of Helen Keller).  Criticizing such films does not make me unamerican or intolerant of those with disabilities.  Finding fault with "United 93" doesn't mean one doesn't appreciate what those individuals went through that day.  The film may be based on true events, but that doesn't mean the film itself or the director's vision is flawless.<br /><br />Now there is one other camp at work here, and they are the "conspiracy theorists" who have decided to use this forum not to review a film, but rather to exploit the victims of 9/11 in a manner worse than anything Hollywood could do and indirectly cause much more harm to us than what the terrorists did on that fateful day.  We have the right to freedom of speech, but we are expected to use that appropriately too.  I can't yell "FIRE" in a crowded movie theater without criminal consequences.  In that light, I don't march, shout obscenities, or picket the funerals of our soldiers because I may not believe in a war our country asked them to fight as that is not MORALLY my place to exercise my so-called freedom of speech and is unnecessarily hurtful to others who are already suffering.  This is called using discretion and it's what our founding fathers expected us to use.<br /><br />To read on here, in what is supposed to be just reviews for a film, and find what are merely personal assertions (with little or no facts), propaganda by groups seeking "the truth" (as long as it fits their myopic views), and slander regarding that tragic day on 9/11 without regard for the individuals truly involved is rather disheartening and certainly self-serving by those involved who have little concept of the "truth" other than some website they try to direct us to which often contain little more than hearsay, doctored photographs, and other such nonsense.<br /><br />Even if I agreed with all these conspiracy theorists and "9/11 Truth" groups and I ignored any and all evidence to the contrary and sincerely believed that the events of 9/11 were the result of an "inside job", television special effects, government propaganda, fantasy and so forth, I would NEVER think of so vocally expressing that here, which may be my right, because if I am wrong in my assertion, the harm I would inflict on the actual families and friends of those who personally suffered from the events of 9/11 would be unthinkable to me.  I have read far too many "this was all faked by the government" or "it never happened" comments and "reviews" (I use the term loosely here) that I can't imagine the deep hurt experienced by those who truly did lose loved ones that day even though I am one of them."  For me, personally, this is beyond cruel and literally inflicts more harm than anything the terrorist did that day.  Are we ALL allowed our opinion?  YES, but some discretion is called for in such extreme situations such as those connected to 9/11 and some form of decency, respect, and discretion should be paramount before we open our mouths or type on the computer.<br /><br />Now having addressed both camps and the conspiracy theorist group that have more than made themselves know here by commenting, sometimes viciously, on one's review I offer my perspective on this film.  "United 93" is an extraordinary film that plays out more as a small independent docu-drama than a traditional big-budget Hollywood film.  Paul Greengrass's direction is straight-forward, confident and unobtrusive; however, his script faults in just a few places where some stilted dialogue is present.  His brilliant casting of unknowns (actors or even the real people involved in some cases) was a respectful move in order to not promote a specific star's career and this allowed the focus to be on the real-life characters portrayed within the film with no distractions.<br /><br />In addition, while some have criticized the film for being overly speculative, I found it rather fair treatment of events that unfolded that day as careful analysis of cell/plane calls, witness testimonies (some even by phone), news reports, aircraft recording devices, government documents, and so forth were the foundation for much of what was presented in this film.  Contrary to the callousness of our conspiracy theorists there is no solid evidence for Greengrass to consider of United 93 being shot down or having landed in some secret location.  In fact, all the evidence concretely contradicts these ludicrous notions.  There speculative moments within the film as we can't know exactly what was said and done at all times on that flight; however,  ALL films, I'll say it again, ALL films on true events are speculative by nature and events are often open to interpretations.  I simply found this film to be realistic and fair based upon what was known about that day.  I felt good judgment was used in presenting what happened and what most likely happened that day on United 93.<br /><br />Our heroes, as presented in this film, where very much the way I imagine them to be: ordinary people who were scared to death.  There was no Jason Bourne or John McClane on board United 93, just everyday ordinary people placed in an extraordinary situation.  Some were too scared to do anything, some were in a state of panic, some prayed for deliverance, some just hoped for the best, and some took desperate measures.  ALL were heroes for facing what I would never want to face myself.  Facing death, even when afraid of it, is heroic, especially when it is forced upon us.<br /><br />The film is in "real time" and that heightens the tension and our appreciation for what those poor souls experienced that day.  This allows the story to move swiftly and with purpose as it demonstrates the overall feeling of confusion that occurred that day.  Most of us could not believe what was happening and it didn't matter if we were the everyday guy on the street, a government official, a pilot, or a teacher in the middle of a lesson as I was that day.  We were all caught off guard and in disbelief and this film captures that well.  There are no unnecessary diverging scenes within this film.<br /><br />I found this film to be generally flawless (except for some dialogue problems at times), one of the best of 2006, and a fitting tribute to those who so bravely faced what most of us would find unimaginable.  "United 93" is a haunting, frightening, realistic, moving film, and a triumph of the human spirit.  I know that is a cliche term, but it is most fitting here.<br /><br />In conclusion it important to observe that we all lost something on 9/11, some indirectly and some directly.  As former New Yorkers, my wife and I lost co-workers, friends, and a sense of security oddly found in the skyline of that great city that no longer looks as it did when we last were there.  We both worked in and around The World Trade Centers (I actually witnessed them be built).  I worked at the base in a department store and my wife worked on the 96th floor for a bank.  It's hard to imagine that most of our co-workers and friends from there are gone.  I have yet to return to New York, but I know I will one day; I must.  In the meantime, I find films like "United 93" to be an emotional outlet, a reminder of the fragility of life and the evil man is capable of committing, and the fight to survive that is in all of us.<br /><br />This is why I defend the making of such films on 9/11 and why I'm also so appalled at the callousness of some here abusing their freedom of speech by shouting such obscenities as "this didn't happened", "it's a big cover-up", or "it's all fiction" and back it up with websites that are an insult to the memory of those who perished that day.  I guess my friend present at the WTC didn't see that plane hit it as she said she did.  It was television special effects or a bomb planted by our government to mislead us.  I guess both the flight recorder and those who spoke to loved ones on United 93 moments before the attempt to break into the cockpit had it all wrong as well as they were "shot down by our own Air Force" or "landed safely in a secret location" as our conspiracy theorists claim or have doctored photos to "prove it."  My dad once told me that it is "better to be silent and only thought to be a foul then to open your mouth and remove all doubt about it."<br /><br />According to our conspiracy theorist those of us who witnessed or were otherwise connected to 9/11 have it all wrong and have been fooled by the government that set out this elaborate plan in which it would take thousands to orchestrate and keep secret) to kill thousands of American lives and destroy national landmarks in order to create a war for fun while wrecking the already financially crippled airline industry and putting a death grip on our overall economy that would take years in which to recover.  The same people who would have us believe that utter nonsense are now shouting how we should dishonor those we lost that day by pretending the events of 9/11 never happened and check out their websites to review doctored "evidence."  I think not.  These individuals embarrass themselves and only assist at rubbing salt in a hard to heal wound that was made by the terrorists that clear day on September 11th.  A day that should be remembered as it was and not as we would like it to have been and shame on the revisionists in our society who are nothing more than selfish attention seekers.</p></br><a href="../users/AWG2O9C42XW5G.html">AWG2O9C42XW5G</a><br/><p>This movie is awesome, and it neede to be told of those heroic passangers, who risked thier lives for others and stopped the murderous terroist.

The heroism of the passengers of United Airlines Flight 93 was a major exception.<br /><br />The events are well known to all.  On the day when four airliners were hijacked by radical Islamic terrorists, those on this craft fought back.  After the killers took over the airplane, several of those on board spoke with their loved ones by phone.  They found out about the other airliners that were flown into the World Trade Center and decided to go down fighting.  This is their story.<br /><br />The creators of this movie did a great job of recreating the events of that day.  It is very well done and very powerful.  Every American should watch this and honor their memories.</p></br><a href="../users/A2KG8WLR1AKO12.html">A2KG8WLR1AKO12</a><br/><p>Paul Greengrass's United 93 is a must see film.  It pulls no punches.  The Islamic nihilists are clearly shown to be evil.  The four young men who hijack the flight hate us and everything we stand for.  They are true believers who readily rationalize the brutal slaughter of innocents.  Slashing the throats of the so-called nonbelievers is totally justified in their way of looking at the world.  And no, they are not particularly unique. Millions of Muslims also agree with them.  Do they represent the majority?  There are roughly 1.2 billion believers of Islam residing on this planet.  Even a small percentage of this total is enough to cause great concern.<br /><br />We, of course, already know much of the story before we enter the theater.  The tragic end is not a mystery.  Nonetheless, Greenglass's creation keeps our eyes glued to the screen.  I don't recall even hearing a pin drop.  Around three initially noisy teenagers sat in front of me.  They never uttered a word during the movie.  Needless to add, United 93 is not escapist entertainment.  The passengers are doomed---and they did nothing whatsoever to place themselves in such a predicament.  It was merely the luck of the draw.  Ultimately, a number of the passengers bravely attempt to recapture the plane.  If nothing else, we now know they likely saved our nation's capitol.  I will be blunt.  Do you plan on voting in November?  If so, you are perhaps even morally obligated to view United 93.  The stakes are too high to trust the safety of the American citizenry to elected officials who fail to truly comprehend the threat of the radical Muslims.  Small children should not see United 93.  Anyone over the age of 12, however, should definitely do so.  I plan on purchasing a DVD copy.  United 93 should be seen on at least a yearly basis.  We must never forget what occurred on September 11, 2001.  Sadly, the war on terror is not going away anytime in the near future.<br /><br />David Thomson<br />Flares into Darkness</p></br><a href="../users/A3MV1KKHX51FYT.html">A3MV1KKHX51FYT</a><br/><p>The film begins with a man praying. "It's time." He and his friends depart to Newark airport. Other travelers arrive at the terminal, including the crew. The passengers are inspected for hidden weapons, none are found. The passengers board the flight to San Francisco. An air traffic controller notices a problem with Flight 11 out of Boston. [Delays cost $2,000 a minute.] The radar suddenly loses track of Flight 11 when it is near Manhattan. The see smoke coming out of the North Tower (about 8:45 AM). "I've got a bad feeling about this." United 175 dropped its transponder. Where is it? It crashes into the South Tower~ Flights are halted in Boston, New York, and Washington. Langley is warned about Flight 11 nearing Washington. When will they engage? The President has to make the call.<br /><br />On board Flight 93 one of the terrorists makes a bomb in the rest room. They start stabbing the passengers and enter the cockpit to remove the pilots. Air Traffic Controller hear the disturbance and note the change in direction. They have to get the plane before it gets withing 50 or 60 miles from Washington! "Our time has come" says the terrorist who is flying the plane. "Where are those fighter jets?" The flight attendants try to calm the passengers. "The Vice-President can make the call." The news tells of the attack on the Pentagon. All planes are ordered to land, foreign flights are turned back. Some of the passengers decide to fight back since they have nothing to lose. Where can they get weapons? Others make calls on the air phones. Can they come up with a plan?<br /><br />The passengers attack the hijackers, one goes down. They push a cart against the other terrorist and he goes down. Next the cart is used as a battering ram against the cockpit door so they can attack the last two terrorists. No one can control the airplane so the flight makes an unscheduled landing. It was the only aircraft that failed to reach its target; this saved the Capitol or the White House from attack and destruction. By the time the President authorized shooting down hijacked aircraft it was all over. US airspace was closed, no civilian airliner was in the skies.<br /><br />This film explains why there should be a memorial to the heroic passengers on Flight 93 - in Washington DC. The credits name the real people and the actors who portrayed them. Some actors were the real people who were involved. Could this hijacking have occurred in earlier times when the pilot was required to be armed and many passengers would also be armed? Should the US government have been more diligent? I wonder how they were able to reconstruct the events in the plane when no one survived?

"flight" was more about the all around story,while "united" is more about the air traffic controlers and the passangers. paul greengrass has done a wonderful job,much like ron howard did with "apollo 13", in taking a story that we already know the outcome of and still keep you glued to the seat. with actors that are not that well known he has given this movie the feeling of really being there. the film reminds me of "das boot" the world war II movie about german subs,because the camera is confined to the small set of the plane and you feel the closeness of the walls. this isn't some big hollywood action movie with bruce or arnold,no one lone hero here,just 40 people scared to death but not willing to give up or to let others die if it could be stopped. this is an emotional and deeply moving movie of 40 people who did what we all hope we never have to do,they gave their lives to save 100's maybe 1000's of lives. when it's all over this is a very moving tribute to those men and women. it will remain to tell their story of courge long after we who remember pass away! they familes of these hero's should be proud of these peopl;e</p></br><a href="../users/A5TZXWU8AALIC.html">A5TZXWU8AALIC</a><br/><p>This is not an easy film to watch and yet it felt important to make myself do it.

We have to understand that even though we've all gone back to our normal lives (those who are lucky enough to do that), these monsters are still out there, still plotting to kill the rest of us, still hating with every fiber of their being.<br /><br />They see us as evil.  Imagine what their movie would look like if they made one from THEIR point of view.  The passengers on United 93 would have horns and tails and be engaged in orgies and child sacrifice before the brave hijackers took the vile plane to the ground.<br /><br />That's how they see us and that's why they dedicate themselves to kill us.  That reality should overshadow all political posturing.<br /><br />But this film simply tries to recreate what happened on September 11th, 2001.

Almost as if there had documentary crews on the plane, in the FAA, and scattered among the various military and civilian places covered in the movie.  The movie covers the anarchy of the military and flight controllers trying to handle a totally unique situation, and the brave people of United 93 who chose to fight back.

The costume design by Lorraine Carson, Dinah Collin (who also did the costume design to Greengrass' "The Bourne Supremacy" (2004), "Bloody Sunday" (2002) and also "The Theory Of Flight" (1998), & Liz McGarrity is brilliant and impressive! One of the year's best films! Those who think that they could take the chance of watching this, do it, those who can't, can wait. This is an cinematic, brilliant, masterful and powerful masterpiece! This is just as powerful and brilliant as "The Passion Of The Christ" (2004)!</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6X0DAM87GN4.html">A3C6X0DAM87GN4</a><br/><p>For weeks now we have heard the question asked, "are people ready to see a film about 9/11?" I laughed at the thought of the question. Of course people are ready. Did anyone ask that question during World War 2? Hollywood was turing out movies about the war left and right. Surely audiences members had loved ones fighting abroad. Did any one say, hey wait a minute, there's a war going on, people don't want to see a movie about a war. What about films such as "Since You Went Away" and "The Best Years of Our Lives", two of the greatest films made dealing with how the war effected the home front. Did people shout, "too soon!" Of course not.<br /><br /> "United 93" is one of the most intense, absorbing, touching, heartfelt movie going experiences I have had all year. No movie has touched me in such a profound way since "The Passion of the Christ". "United 93" is more than a movie. It transends comments such as "best film of the year". It is above that.<br /><br /> It should be pointless to go over plot description, so let me discuss my reaction to the film. First of all the movie makes no moral judgements. All the movie does, similar to a documentary, is show us what happened and allow us to come up with our own thoughts. We don't need to be told what happened on September 11th was bad. We don't need to be told the people who hijacked these planes were evil. So the movies doesn't feel any need to state the obvious.<br /><br /> But, "United 93" does raise some questions, only I'm not sure we are suppose to talk about them. I don't want to make "United 93" sound like a political film, it doesn't have a left or right point of view, but political questions will stir in your brain as you watch the movie. For instance, if the President could have been reached, what would have changed? Why couldn't the president be reached? Why did all branches involved not know what the other was doing? If every second was vital, what does the president's famous "seven minute" blackout tell us? Should he have done something?<br /><br /> The truly great movies make us ask questions. Not because they have plot-holes, but because we become so involved with the characters we don't want the film to end. We linger on and on about the characters and the events. "United 93" makes us ask a lot of questions.<br /><br /> Here's one more thing to think about. Remember when "The Passion of the Christ" came out, and groups were afraid it was going to cause anti-Semitism? I haven't heard a word from Muslim groups afraid this film would case race riots, have you? Why is that?<br /><br /> Ever since 9/11 happened people have claimed the "united 93" flight was American propaganda. I don't know enough about the issue to decided whether or not it is or isn't, but, lets assume it is. If it is all a fake, a story the government created to inspire patriotic feelings within us, than strickly as a work of fiction the film is still powerful and emotionally involving. But a bigger question lies underneath all this. Is it okay to talk about 9/11 and ask questions? Will this film push forward a debate?<br /><br /> "United 93" is a film everyone should see. Is it difficult to watch? Yes. I'm not going to lie to you. You may have the urge to look away, but don't. This is a gripping, emotionally draining experience that will linger in your mind long afterwards. It may even take a while for you to decided if it was good or not. But that's okay. See the movie, think it over, and most importantly, ask questions.<br /><br /> Bottom-line: The year's most emotionally draining, heartfelt, intense,and absorbing films I have seen since "The Passion of the Christ". I look at this work of art and feel it is more than a movie. It should be seen by everyone.</p></br><a href="../users/AMYW43AHO16SS.html">AMYW43AHO16SS</a><br/><p>This is a powerful film!  The story is not sugarcoated with obsurd lines or Hollywood inuendo.  It was made as a real time docudrama.  We see the people who actually were there on 9/11; from the air traffic controllers to the military.  We see the chaos that engulfed everone that day.  The only ones who were not in this film were the people who perished on United Airlines flight 93.  What makes that element of the film work so well is that there are no known actors to play the passengers.  Director Paul Greengrass should be commended for not taking the high road.  It's a film that should be celebrated for the patriotic spirit of all Americans who fight tyrany in the face of evil.  A film for all to see!</p></br><a href="../users/A36HBE2C5SQ2E6.html">A36HBE2C5SQ2E6</a><br/><p>This is humanity's finest hour when a bunch of strangers can work together and fight a terrorist group to the death. The group was planning on taking out the White House in a series of terroist attacks that befalled our nation on September 11th. Paul Greengrass tries not to make the film political in anyway. He doesn't bash anyone. He showcases the people that sacrificed their live to save other people. It is a truly outstanding film that had me in tears when I was done watching it. It was a emotional masterpice that held onto you, and didn't let you go to till the end, although you knew what was going to happen, you still wanted the people to live. I respect Paul Greengrass for taking the victims story and showcasing it in the film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LZVU5SRRM3VX.html">A1LZVU5SRRM3VX</a><br/><p>Every once in awhile, a film comes along that is so understated that it blows me away, and this was such a film.  By concentrating on the mundane details that the passengers, crew, and air traffic controllers were dealing with at the time of the attacks on America, Greengrass puts together a stunningly cinema verite representation of the actual events.<br /><br />By using all unknown actors (as well as a few actual ATC staff, playing themselves) the director sensitively portrays the confusion, the conflict, the struggle, and the heroism that ensued.  At its core, United 93 is a human tragedy, and Greengrass' meticulous, real-time recreation of every moment from boarding to impact reminds us of the human impact of the event.<br /><br />The film is extremely intense and realistic, but if the viewer can handle the underlying reality of the film, it is well worth the emotional toll it inflicts on the viewer.  For a more emotionally wrenching tragic/heroic double feature, consider watching United 93 and Oliver Stone's equally intense World Trade Center in one sitting.  You'll be haunted by the ghosts of that terrible day when the world, quite literally came crashing down around us, and recall with terrible clarity your feelings from that day.<br /><br />Some people think it is too soon to open these wounds from which our country is still healing, but these sensitive profiles in courage stand as a fitting memorial to those who lost their lives on that terrible day in our nation's history.</p></br><a href="../users/A21B2TJBWCSK1R.html">A21B2TJBWCSK1R</a><br/><p>On September 11, 2001, four commercial airplanes were hijacked by teams of terrorists and used as missiles to strike twice in New York City and the Pentagon in Washington, D.C. The fourth plane never reached its intended target and crashed in a field in Pennsylvania. United 93 dramatizes the events leading up to and speculates on what happened on this fourth plane before it lost control and crashed into the ground killing everyone on board.<br /><br />The inevitable question a film like United 93 raises is, it is still too soon for a film like this to be made? And if you do make a commercial film about 9/11 what kind of approach do you take that doesn't exploit such a sensitive event and do a disservice to the people who died tragically on that horrible day? What about the families of the people who died? How would they feel about a movie dramatizing what happened to their loved ones?<br /><br />And so it was with much trepidation when United 93 was announced but some of the concerns were put to rest when it was revealed that Paul Greengrass would be writing and directing the movie. He had previously directed the powerful Bloody Sunday, a gut-wrenching docudrama of the Derry massacre in Ireland on January 30, 1972. If anyone could keep true to the facts and not pander to sappy sentimentalism or flag-waving patriotism it would be Greengrass.<br /><br />What makes this film work so well is that it was made outside of the Hollywood studio system and this allowed Greengrass to cast unknown actors, character actors and even actual people who were witness to what happened that day. By doing this we aren't distracted from what is going on in the film like an easily identifiable movie star would. Another element that stands out is the use of hand-held cameras to give a sense of immediacy commonly associated with cinema verite. It also gives a documentary feel early on when we see the plane being boarded and all the work done to get it ready. It is this kind of attention to detail that gives United 93 a certain level of authenticity.<br /><br />United 93 is a film you don't watch, you endure. It is very upsetting to watch (as it should) but is an important movie nonetheless because it shows, with unflinching honesty, what might have happened on that plane based on phone conversations from passengers before they died. United 93 is an important film because we must not forget what happened on 9/11 and what these people went through and the sacrifices they made. This film is a fitting tribute to them.<br /><br />There is an audio commentary by writer/director Paul Greengrass. Greengrass has a tendency to speak slowly and ponderously but is very articulate when he explains his intentions for a given scene or talks about the events of that day. He gets a little pretentious at times but does speak knowledgably about the film.<br /><br />"United 93: The Families and the Film" focuses on the families of the people who died on United Flight 93. Several of them are interviewed and talk about their thoughts on the movie and how they feel about their loved ones being depicted by actors. To that end, we see some of the cast meeting with the family members of the person they portrayed in the movie and it is obviously an emotional moment for all involved.<br /><br />"Memorial Pages" provides brief biographical sketches and moving tributes to each flight crew member and passenger on United Flight 93. This is a great idea and a fitting tribute to these people, amply illustrating how each and every one of them were unique and memorable with their own distinctive lives.<br /><br />Finally, on the 2-disc Limited Edition, there is an additional extra - "Chasing Planes - Witnesses to 9/11," a documentary about the men and women who tracked all the planes on that day and how they dealt with the crisis as it was unfolding. There are interviews with many of the air traffic controllers working that day some of whom played themselves in the movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A18G7GG53G2X8A.html">A18G7GG53G2X8A</a><br/><p>It's difficult to be objective about a film like "United 93," considering it's the first film to present an account of the tragedy that was September 11, 2001. I remember seeing the first teaser trailer for it at the end of 2005 (back when it was called "Flight 93") and immediately thinking about how the public would react to it. One of the greatest public concerns was that, because it was made only six years after the attacks, emotions would still be too raw to allow anyone to focus on anything other than the pain and frustration. I have to admit that I was one of those people; why would anyone want to capitalize on a national catastrophe so soon afterwards? But then the film was released, and I listened to a lot of the reviews, which have certainly been more than favorable. And rightly so. This is not just a movie; it's a horrific reminder of the sorrow that befell America that dark September morning, and in my opinion, it should be required viewing for all of humanity.<br /><br />When it comes to a film like this, it's not a matter of liking it or of finding it entertaining. If it were made with those goals in mind, it would be one of the most offensive, insulting things to ever smear itself on the silver screen. What does matter is whether or not it's an important movie, made to present the facts in an appropriate and informative way. "United 93" definitely delivers in that regard. Nothing is extraneous or melodramatic; it's almost like a documentary in that it's an accurate unfolding of moments that most people have not had the chance to learn about. On top of that, it's so touching that it absolutely guarantees some kind of reaction (loud, soft, or silent). I say this in regard to everyone, not just to the victims' family and friends. Unless you have ice water in your veins, you'll find this to be profoundly moving, especially when the passengers make their last phone calls.<br /><br />Paul Greengrass took the awesome responsibility of writing and directing this film, no small task considering the potential repercussions from the American public. He went as far as to personally appeal to the family members of the ill-fated United 93 passengers, something that took a great deal of courage and determination on his part. I can't say if they all agreed to this film being made, but apparently enough of a consensus was reached. They must have known that he wouldn't make something that exploited their loved ones' deaths; rather, he would respectfully present their final moments in honest, straightforward terms. He opted to not focus on the background stories of the passengers or hijackers (the latter of which I couldn't help but feel sorry for; they were brainwashed to believe that murdering innocent people was the only solution). The best we're given are little snippets of overheard conversations, ones that seem completely unscripted and make use of everyday language. Nothing anyone says in this film seems contrived, and for that we have more than Greengrass to thank; we also have to thank the actors for their realistic portrayals.<br /><br />The air traffic controllers eventually have to figure out exactly what's going on in the skies above; every moment of those scenes is hectic, emotional, and filled with frustration. Things only get worse when the military gets involved, especially since a lot of the information they receive is chaotic and conflicting. When the first plane crashes into the World Trade Center, they scramble like mad to determine whether or not it was American Airlines flight 11, and by the end of the film they still don't know for sure (some reports said that it was still in the air despite disappearing from the radar screen). By the time military action is decided on, another host of problems occur, not the least of which were the unequipped fighter jets and the inability to get hold of the President. They were thoroughly authentic scenes, made even better by the fact that many of the air traffic controllers working that day were cast to play themselves.<br /><br />I don't think it matters anymore if "United 93" was released too soon. Even before its release, some cities were forced to pull the trailer from theaters because it was still enough of a reminder. Now that it has been released, many in all likelihood will come away feeling angry, bitter, and remorseful. Of course this movie is a downer, but it's an important downer, bringing to light the story of the airplane passengers who tried but ultimately failed to take control of their hijacked flight on September 11, 2001. Everything from the casting of unknown actors to the editing all came together beautifully, and the end result is something truly powerful. It's good to know that the first movie about 9/11 was carefully and respectfully crafted. I honestly believe that years from now, people will remember this movie just as much as they remember that awful day in 2001, when so many lives were tragically cut short.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>This could be the toughest review I've ever written. Being a born-and-bred American, I have a few protective sensibilities regarding my home country. When 9/11 happened, I was just as stunned, fearful, and outraged as most of my fellow countrymen, I'm sure. And watching a film related to those events only a few short years after that dreadful day, I could feel those same emotions smoldering within me. Trying to objectively rate this film based solely on its merits becomes a bit sticky, simply because that emotional scar is still so fresh. But I'll do my best.<br /><br />The greatest thing about UNITED 93 is that it's filmed using hand-held cameras, giving the viewer an intimate sense that they are an active party within the movie. This is most effective when we're on the plane (for reasons stated earlier) and get to witness all of the passengers' interactions with each other and the hijackers. The other excellent part is that there isn't one star that we follow, nor are there any big name actors/actresses in the film. Every person is just as important as the next. I applaud director Greengrass' script interpretation and this seldom used method of filming.<br /><br />Another admirable item is that the film shows us how off-guard the FAA and the military was immediately following the hijackings. As the movie moves between the FAA headquarters and the military's interactions with these public offices, we get to witness the incredible chaos that ensued and feel the frustrations as they try to figure out which planes are risks, what to do about them, who has the authority to shoot them down (if need be), and the unavailability of President Bush.<br /><br />The big issues with the movie will obviously be very personal. Each individual will probably feel differently about it. Mine were of manipulation. Since this is still a fresh memory in the minds of most Americans (including my own), I felt as though the film makers were trying to feed off of those memories. This isn't as horrible as it sounds, though. Some of the best films play with our feelings. The risk here, however, is what we do with them. Do we continue to fear? Or hate? Or do we learn from these experiences and move ahead? This film won't give you the answers to those questions, which is both a strength and one hell of a flaw. But it is a well put together piece of cinema.</p></br><a href="../users/A1C9GCHR99WX3F.html">A1C9GCHR99WX3F</a><br/><p>United 93 had to be the most talked about movie in the year 2006, or at least one of them. And lots of questions about this movie, and whether or not that it is too soon after Septemeber 11, 2001 for a film to be made of that horrible day in September of 01. I don't think so, and plus we have had a couple of other ones before this. Just months after the day, we had G&eacute;d&eacute;on and Jules Naudet's 9/11, and Fahrenheit 9/11. And this movie got a R rating from the MPAA, and with very good reason to, so parents please don't let your kids watch this movie until they are old enough, this movie is not for them, and a lot in ths movie they should see, and don't count on a 9/11 film coming out that would even be appioate for them coming out in the future. Since this movie was released in September, tonight I finnaly got the chance to see it on dvd. This movie follows the story of United 93, that was the only hijacked airplanes on the morning of September 11, 2001 that didn't reach its target. Instead United Airlines 93 crashed into a Pennsylvania field. All the actors are unknown, and I would doubt a lot of htem you would have heard of. When this movie came out, and when I saw the full cast list, one of the names that I was surpised to see in the movie, and didn't see mentioned at all in reviews, is Cheyenne Jackson that played Mark Bingham. I know him best for being in the orginal Broadway cast of the Elvis Presley musical All Shook Up that opened up on Broadway on March 24, 2005, but because of decling tickets sales, lead the play to be closed on September 25, 2005. All the people that was on United 93 on that fateful September day died, and just by watching this film makes me glad that I wasn't on one of the 4 planes that day, otherwise I wouldn't be here writing this review. My life would have been lost, and who knows on the 3 other planes, how many people surived that day. And plus I can't even remember the last time I even had to take a plane ride. But still I have to give this a good review, and a recommendation, that if you haven't seen this film yet, that you might want to see this film, whether or not you knew a person that died on September 11th, certainly I have to be sad for the familes of September 11 victims, they didn't dereve to die this way, nor did thier loved ones derseved to lose them this way. I aslo like to reccomend 9/11 (2002), but I haven't seen Fahrenheit 9/11, so I can't tell you if it is even worth a watch.</p></br><a href="../users/A18MBO1U4DPY20.html">A18MBO1U4DPY20</a><br/><p>The last scene was stellar but tell me, is that all that matters?<br /><br />United 93 has a clueless start (the airports, the staff, the government talks) and a great,great build up to a "napoleon dynamite" of a conclusion. It didn't sell consequence but tries to sell heroic significance which I can learn to respect. However, I must say, 9/11 was not a good day and it changed my world as much as it changed yours. United 93, even with a grizzling build up - failed to remotely emotivate me. It was emotionally impotent and quite a few strands (namely - the character build up, the understanding transferred to the audience) were strayed about.<br /><br />The reason I had big expectations from this film is because the particular incident changed a lot of things about our planet. It changed the way we Asians are welcomed in the west (Security checks, dubious random checkings by authorities,etc) , 9/11 brought the world closer and made the minorities more recognizable, a sense of cold dread adulterated with friendly humanity from all sides - - all in all, fills the world today. I had difficulty understanding how exactly the staff realized that the plane had been hijacked. There were a few loopholes I can overlook but the film really disappointed me. The acting is good but the direction, I feel, should have been more subtle yet impacting.<br /><br />Sorry, this film just didn't manage to move me.<br /><br />Harkanwar Singh Anand<br /><br />New Delhi, India</p></br><a href="../users/A2D8CUJPOSRPNA.html">A2D8CUJPOSRPNA</a><br/><p>When one thinks of September 11, 2001, one usually thinks of the War on Terror that it helped spawn.  But the politics of 9/11's aftermath are just one aspect of it, and it is something that writer/director Paul Greengrass (THE BOURNE SUPREMACY) has chosen to sidestep in favor of a gut-wrenching, humanistic approach in his film UNITED 93.<br /><br />United Airlines Flight 93, enroute from Newark to San Francisco on that fateful morning, was the only one of the four hijacked planes that didn't reach its intended target (which, as the film shows, was most likely the U.S. Capitol Building).  This is because the passengers onboard, knowing already that two planes had nailed the World Trade Center and a third had taken out the southwest corner of the Pentagon, quickly formulated a plan to try and take back control of the aircraft from the four Islamist terrorists who had taken it over.  Although their attempt to regain control of the aircraft was doomed to end in a field sixty miles outside of Pittsburgh, their actions saved untold thousands of lives in the nation's capitol.<br /><br />Utilizing a docudrama approach via hand-held cameras, as well as razor-sharp editing, Greengrass, working with a cast of largely unknown actors plus some of the very civilian air traffic and military personnel who were there on that terrible day, made UNITED 93 an intense experience, but one that avoids political grandstanding.  This film is about people, pure and simple--from the people in the civilian and military air trafic control centers faced with a thoroughly impossible situation, to the fanatical hijackers, to the passengers who were determined to stop them.<br /><br />Of course, there are well-reasoned arguments against UNITED 93, that it is too soon for a 9/11-related film to be released now (though maybe FAHRENHEIT 9/11 slipped everyboody's mind).  But exactly when WOULD be the right time?  After all, films about the 1978 Jonestown tragedy and the 1976 Entebbe incident were both made within 18-24 months of those events.  Besides, UNITED 93 is never exploitational--violent, yes, and unavoidably so, but definitely never exploitational.  It is a film to be commended for being a deep human interest story of the highest order, and Greengrass, his cast, and his crew are to be commended for their extremely laudable efforts here.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>I must admit I was disappointed with UNITED 93.  I think the tv movie FLIGHT 93 captured the passengers' plight more than this bigger budgeted one.  While excruciatingly hard and sad to watch, UNITED 93 didn't make me feel as connected with the passengers and crew as I would have liked.  While FLIGHT 93 gave us the names of the passengers, Paul Greengrass' script makes them too anonymous, and I felt too much time was spent on the ground crew and even on the terrorists themselves.<br /><br />I was disappointed even insulted by John Powell's eastern-tinged musical score; I was disappointed and even insulted with the juxtaposition of the passenger's recital of the Lord's Prayer with the terrorists prayers to Allah.  While I support everyone's right for religious expression, I can't find any reason to sanitize or empathize with the actions of these men who were responsible for the horrifying deaths of so many innocent American people.  I don't think this film is as strong a tribute to those brave passengers and crew as I would have liked, and that is rather sad.</p></br><a href="../users/A32AK8FOAZEPE2.html">A32AK8FOAZEPE2</a><br/><p>then you might have some doubts of what really happened to united 93. yes, this movie gave you a picture of the uncommon valor of the passengers on united 93, but to think back, it looks more like a well staged propaganda movie. yes, how could it possible that the cabin recording device would have possibly recorded the conversation in the passenger cabin and outside of the door? and all those cell phone conversations on such high altitude in a fast moving flying airplane? how it was possible to have these kinda conversations to different states and different cities? even without roaming charge or with voice mail they'd still be impossible. we used to got lot of drop called even we are on the ground, standing on a fixed spot or in a moving car. even the best rated cellphone service providers, verizon, sprint...whatever, if the calling areas without enough transmitting pods, we'd lose signals no matter what. and on a fast movie flying airplane? if you don't use satellite phone, it'd be impossible to get a connection. besides, like what i just realized, yes, when i call my mom, i never said first 'hi, mom, this is mr. so and so, your son calling...' did i ever have to mention my full name to my mom when i called her? of course not.<br />furthermore, why there's almost nothing left on the crash site? usually, when passenger airplane crashed on land, there should be a lot of charred bodies, luggages, chairs, parts of wings, usually intact turbine engines....littered all over the places, but why there's only a big hole in the crash site, and then the government bulldozed  and levelled it right away? what kinda cover up is this? then released this totally dramatized tear jerker to digress your logic thinking. what's going on?<br />with these questions in mind, this whole United 93 incident looks more like a staged drama not based on a true story as it claimed.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>My rating for this film is as a "film". I am in no way trying to disrespect the tragedy or the families of the heroes on this plane. I just didn't think this was a very good movie. It's not well executed and when it was over, I was mad and ready for some revenge! Of course this is the intended response and the manipulation of the audience by the film makers is just plain shameful! This felt like a bad TV movie and the viewers can't help but feel sad and angry while watching this movie. It's the equivalent to making a film about Jonbenet Ramsey back when the crime was fresh and having a graphic murder/sex scene showing the poor child's horrible demise! The DVD transfer looks very good, but I liked World Trade Center much more than this.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M5O6UHXO9IBU.html">A3M5O6UHXO9IBU</a><br/><p>I listened to a long interview with Greengrass and he came across as something of a dullard. That is, he had nothing of great import to say about his chosen subject and expected us belatedly to do the work. The result is of questionable merit. After 9/11, the need to compile and endlessly replay Twin Towers footage from every conceivable angle struck me as almost getting off on the spectacle. Likewise here, "Roll up! Roll up! Dare yourself to climb aboard the United 93 Rollercoaster ride of a lifetime! You'll "ooh", you'll "aagh" and leave covered in sweat and tears with your stomach in your throat!" The 'movie movie' type thriller music, especially when the second plane impacts is a dead giveaway in this regard. Since the purpose of 9/11 was to create terror in the civilian population, it seems wilfully perverse to allow oneself to be terrorized a second time, doing their work for them. It is giving them the 'oxygen of publicity' as Maggie Thatcher once put it. I'm not saying it was made purely for reasons of venality. Few films make money and this was definately a hard sell. Nevertheless, I suspect many will be going for the visceral experience alone, rather than for anything edifying (which is, in any case, not there) and must be counted as something of an own goal by the West.<br /><br />I was also minded of 'Hookey' in 'Zulu', whose descendants were offended by the wholly unjustified portrayal of him as a malingerer at Rorke's Drift. A passenger had his life cruelly cut short by terrorists on board United 93.  Was it neccessary to besmerch his memory as a collaborator, and on what evidence? That was really disgraceful.</p></br><a href="../users/A329U9CDUPKXAC.html">A329U9CDUPKXAC</a><br/><p>This movie is fiction. We don't know what went on in that plane yet. The government is still holding the aviation tapes due to the Zacarias Moussaoui trial. They're supposed to release the tapes now that it's over. It's irresponsible to make a movie without allowing enough time for the facts to come out.</p></br><a href="../users/AILBDL6ATVDCJ.html">AILBDL6ATVDCJ</a><br/><p>I just returned from watching "United 93".  With the exception of Mel Gibson's "The Passion of the Christ" I can't remember a movie having such moving effect on me.<br /><br />The entire film seems to be shot with handheld cameras, and this gives it a documentary-type feel.  In fact, it is almost as if this entire thing was captured on video as it actually happened and put in the movie theaters.  I'm sure that is exactly how director Paul Greengrass wanted it to appear.<br /><br />When I first heard this movie was coming out, I had a mix of emotions.  I worried that the film would portray the terrorists as being successful Jihadists that had foiled all of America's best defenses.  That was not the case.  I worried that "United 93" would portray President Bush as a man who failed to lead at such an important time in America's history.  That was not the case - he wasn't even in the movie at all, unless I missed it when I had to leave the theater for a few seconds.<br /><br />"United 93" captures the emotional trauma, the desperate decisions, and the shockingly horrid events that took place on September 11, 2001.  The film is not your classical big Hollywood production.  There are no breathtakingly choreographed, large set scenes.  There is no famous Hollywood hunk in a lead role that you will remember for years to come.  No, this is a movie on fire with raw emotion.  It is a movie that takes you where you know evil seems to have won.  This film shows how brave men and women made sure that it didn't.<br /><br />I'm glad I made the choice to see this film.  It has made me think about how precious life is.  It has made me wonder how people can ever view innocent people as a target of revenge, no matter where they live, no matter how they live, and no matter what they think about my God and my faith.  This film is a tribute to freedom in that the passengers of "United 93" decided to fight on, knowing full well that they might die while doing so.<br /><br />The actors in "United 93" kept their performances on real-life mode, with no one actor stealing the show.  That made the film seem like a documentary (I know, I mentioned this above already).  The last few minutes of this movie are so intense that I actually started to dig my fingernails into the theater chair arms while I was watching.  It's that moving!<br /><br />The movie is also not as bloody or gory as I expected it to be.  I think kids 13 and older will be okay with this film.<br /><br />So that's my review; one of the most intense and amazing movies ever made.<br /><br />See ya next review!</p></br><a href="../users/A1NLZVP501JM5Z.html">A1NLZVP501JM5Z</a><br/><p>That is what we must do, never forget the people that died on September 11, and movies like United 93 help us to remember those who died.  Everything about that day is reccounted slowly and in great detail.  We meet the passengers, the flight operators, and the hijackers.  We see the first reports, the towers being hit, and United 93 going down in a cornfield in Pennsylvania.  It is very emotional and disturbing.<br /><br />The film ends on a black screen, dedicated to those who endured 9/11.  This film is very well made and Paul Greengrass was the perfect choice to direct this movie.  The actors are all unknown, but they all do a good job.  Early in the movie a man almost misses the plane, but just gets there in time, and you know that hes going to die.<br /><br />Overall this is a well-made film and is emotional hard to watch, but you have to, have to never forget.</p></br><a href="../users/A2809U2S14N0K1.html">A2809U2S14N0K1</a><br/><p>Everyone else has covered most of the movie. All I can say is how it effected me. I the confusion on everyone trying to figure out what was happening to being very realistic. I thought the acting was extremely good. When I saw here the situation unfold, I remember how people around me at work related to the situation.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>Though it has been over five years since the devastation of 9/11 the memory lives on, a day no one will ever forget - nor should we.  This viewer waited until UNITED 93 was released on DVD to view it, thinking that watching the film in the security of the home might make it less threatening. But what Paul Greengrass has created in reconstructing those few hours in 2001 that changed the psyche of the world forever is an achievement in courage, in understatement, and in respect  - as fine a memorial as any that has been planned.<br /><br />In using not easily recognizable but very fine actors in all of the roles, Greengrass allows his script to unfold gradually in the relaxed atmosphere of the usual air flight plans and minor delays, conversations heard by all of us as we await a take off of a plane.  Concurrently he shows the four men, whose mission is to destroy 'the oppressors', prepare, pray, dress, and board.  Then he moves into the planning rooms of air control, lets us feel the insidious progression of the hijacked planes, shows us the military response and paralysis, places us back in United 93, and unfolds the recognition by the crew and passengers of the danger in which they have been placed. The acts of heroism seem like natural permutations of human response all the way to the final abrupt dark screen when the plane goes down.<br /><br />The degree of tension Greengrass and his superlative cast and crew convey is almost intolerable: magnify that times infinity power and we have a glimpse of what it was like to be in United Flight 93 on September 11, 2001.  The film is a remarkable achievement and is destined to become a hallmark for artistic representation of historic events.  Highly Recommended on every level.

At the conclusion the audience was frozen in silence. Film making at the highest level. Anger at the blunders that contributed to the losses.</p></br><a href="../users/A17BT73RVRQYSP.html">A17BT73RVRQYSP</a><br/><p>Looking at this movie as just a movie, it was as well done technically and as well acted as any movie I can remember.  I particularly liked the the air controllers in Boston and NY<br /><br />The roles of the the Army officers and the head of airline control were done very well.  The cluelessness of some of the soldiers at the idea that it might be a real war situation while the officers try to get them in the right mindset.  It's not an encouraging image but would be a true one.<br /><br />The passengers on the plane radiated normalcy, we don't see any special stories highlighted, and no attempt was made to even identify them.  This was a VERY powerful device as it stressed that these people could have been any American.  I don't know if the idea of the European passenger wanting NOT to act was a plot device or not, it made me smirk.<br /><br />The actors who played the hijackers were first rate, we of course don't know the mind of these men so the greatest liberties had to be taken with them.  It is a tough role and they pulled it off well.<br /><br />It is Ironic that I saw this movie with my son just after watching Tora Tora Tora.  Even though my father fought in the pacific during the war I found myself reacting very differently to the two movies.  I suspect because one group is reactive (soldiers obeying orders of Japan) and another group who could have at any time decided not to do what they set out to do.<br /><br />As far as my feelings about the movie, I was over a friends house  on Sept 11 playing in a tabletop baseball league.  The planes hitting the towers didn't really phase me as I assumed it was terror, when the news of flight 93 passengers fighting back and stopping that plane from it's target THAT's when it hit me.  The last 5 minutes of this movie fill me with great satisfaction.  I kept finding myself saying don't wait don't wait.  You KNEW that they wouldn't get to the contols in time to save the plane, but you still wanted it to happen.<br /><br />Watch it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R1HAXRNU0QX7.html">A2R1HAXRNU0QX7</a><br/><p>The moment this movie started, I felt my heart start to pound in anticipation of being upset, angry, terrified, and generally put through an emotional wringer.  This is not a "pleasant" moving-going experience.  It's wrenching because for me it brought back many of my feelings from 9/11.  Helplessness, anger, sadness.  But it also gave me new respect for the passengers on United 93, and for many of the people in the air traffic control towers who could do little beyond watch helplessly.<br /><br />The movie is more or less in real time.  We aren't introduced to any characters in a predictable way.  No back stories...heck, no names are given for most of the main characters.  It's as though we are ono the plane or in the tower with the people who were there.  We can't do anything but watch and cringe.<br /><br />Some have said it makes us feel like we're there with the passengers.  I didn't feel that, because I knew I was safe.  But I did have this amazing feeling of wishing I could change things.  I knew that in a few minutes, all these people would be dead, but I was looking urgently for the hope that the story might turn out differently.<br /><br />The movie is well-acted, but it's more about the editing and cinematography.  It's fast moving, and often visually a little confusing.  After all, the director, Peter Greengrass, was trying to be as faithful as possible to the real events, but we don't know what all of them are...just snippets gleaned from phone conversations and minimal transmissions.  The rest was filled in...so one way to handle the gaps in our knowledge is to throw the camera right in the middle of the action, where we're so close that much of what we see are closeups of jostling torsos, and lots of yelling and noise.<br /><br />It's hard to review this film, because we're very close to it still.  But what it does do is remind the viewer again that we were attacked, and that we were attacked not by a rational enemy with a negotiable aim.  We were attacked by religous zealots who truly believe that our deaths are their salvation.  It's important to remember.  It's important to remember that sometimes when we engage the enemy, we don't have perfect clarity as to what they are doing, but we DO know that inaction won't result in a happy capitulation.  I'm not trying to politicize the movie, but that's the first effect it had on me.<br /><br />Best of all, the cast of this movie looks like REAL people.  No great beauties or handsome hunks.  The people who took action sweated with fear or wept with terror.  They weren't commandos on a mission, they were fathers, sons, wives and children who thought first of their loved ones and then of the lives they might save by risking their own.  And they nearly pulled off saving their own lives...but we are quite sure they saved hundreds of lives who would have been lost in our capital that day.<br /><br />The movie is R-rated, mostly for some cussing (not too much, though) but mostly, I would say, for the intensity of the film.  One hundred years from now, when things have changed a great deal in the world, viewers will probably wonder what the fuss was about.  But for a world not even 5 years removed from the event, UNITED 93 is vital viewing.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJPMB7N776WS.html">A1TJPMB7N776WS</a><br/><p>Paul Greengrass has made some terrific movies: "The Bourne Supremacy" for one and the documentary "Bloody Sunday" for another. In his re-telling of the chilling and poignant story of the passengers on that fateful flight "United 93," he once again has produced a detailed, obviously carefully researched story that shows us probably more than we actually want to see: for so much of it is painfully personal and tragic.<br />One interesting choice that Greengrass makes is to stay away, almost completely, from naming anyone on board the airplane. He chooses instead to treat those that successfully overrun the terrorists as a whole: a democratic them against us mentality that robs us from completely investing emotionally in any one in particular. It's a bold move but also one that distances rather than brings us closer.<br />"United 93" begins very matter-of factly: the four terrorists going about their ritual cleansing and prayer in preparation of their horrible deed, at the airport people standing in line waiting to check in, the ground crew preparing the plane, the pilots and attendants kibitzing: very calm, very ordinary...only the terrorists know what is to occur. But more to the point, the ordinary passengers on flight 93 returning home, on a business trip, on vacation who think they are boarding a routine flight, have no idea what they will be forced to endure and to what they will be asked to react. Therein lays the drama of this film: people like you and I transformed, out of necessity and circumstances beyond our control, into heroes.<br />Greengrass films this story as close to real time as possible. The drama unfolds as it happens and the film's genius is that none of this feels manipulated: when the owlish, round-faced passenger says "no one is going to help us...we must do this ourselves" the action unravels naturally...without pretense without manufactured "drama."<br />"United 93" is on many levels horrifying, upsetting and depressing. Yet out of all of this, because it is so well made and acted, let's hope that the survivors of those killed will get at least a small measure of closure if not the release of a full blown catharsis.</p></br><a href="../users/A17JVVAKWEB0M.html">A17JVVAKWEB0M</a><br/><p>On America's darkest day, terrorist cells commandeered four commercial airplanes and aimed them at iconic symbols of American Democracy and Capitalism.  Three planes found their targets.  "United 93" is the story of the fourth.<br /><br />The film covers the entire morning of September 11, with the closest thing to a "lead" being FAA Director of Operations Ben Sliney, whose portrays himself on his first day on the job with a remarkable performance for a neophyte actor.  Several other officials and military personal re-create their roles on that faithful day.<br /><br />Selecting a number of people to play themselves was the first step writer/director Peter Greengrass made to present the events in the film as they truly happened.  Greengrass allows the drama to build itself, steering clear of manufactured moments of melodrama many would expect from a movie about a doomed aircraft.<br /><br />The film also refuses to use hindsight in determining which facts to emphasize and has total ambivalence for the cultural impact of some people/events.  No special significance if given to Beamer's "let's roll" direction that became a rallying cry for America and no reference is made to the group being lead by a hulkish homosexual who helped redefine the image of effeminate gays in a pre-Brokeback world.  Even though those have been two important stories to come from Flight 93, nobody on the flight that day knew it...so the film doesn`t revise reality to acknowledge them.<br /><br />The brilliance of a film like this can be understood by comparing it to the film many would have made instead.  A lesser film would have Brad Pitt or Eric Bana playing Mark Bingham and Matt Damon or Tom Cruise playing Todd Beamer.  The action would have slowed for the characters to capture the focus of the audience and build cliched subplots about lifelong struggles to overcome adversity.  Their final rush to glory would have been a moment of catharsis, as they were able to overcome some fault that haunted them for years.<br /><br />Thankfully, "United 93" is not that film.  It is an unflinching, unromanticized account of the events of 9/11.  Free from conspiracy speculation or total disdain for our enemies (they are confused, naive men; not mustache twirling villains), the film offers little or no politics/values.  Michael Moore fans will most likely not enjoy this movie because it doesn't take aim directly at our government and doesn't spend time blaming America and claiming we created a world where 9/11 was inevitable.<br /><br />People will come away with different ideas about how the morning unfolded.  Some will unfairly say the FAA, NORAD and the military were too slow in reacting to the initial hijackings.  But I believe by showing the events in real time, audiences see how fast everything unfolded, giving little chance of preventing the terrorists from carrying out their first three missions.  The only thing standing in the way of the last were the people aboard United 93.  And on the worst day in America's history, one group of normal citizens banded together to show the resolve and bravery that continues to move a grateful nation and will forever earn them the title of "heroes".</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>"United 93" is a difficult film to watch. Not only because of the difficult subject matter but also because of how director Paul Greengrass handles the material.<br /><br />Naturally, any film depicting any part of the horror of the events of September 11, 2001 is going to be a hot button and "United 93' is no exception. When the previews began playing in theaters, people protested and it was pulled from at least one theater in New York.<br /><br />But the film is very moving and emotional. Writer and director Paul Greengrass ("Bloody Sunday", "The Bourne Supremacy") deserves a lot of credit for showing restraint. We really don't `meet' any of the characters, or learn very much about them, we merely observe them and we watch as the flight crew, the passengers, the air traffic controllers, the military and the terrorists enter the story for the first time. Greengrass begins the film as the terrorists are praying, before they leave for the airport and he doesn't stop the narrative each time someone new enters the story to introduce them, provide back story, motivation or reason. In a conventional narrative film, this is mandatory and the lack of these elements would drive me mad. But in "United 93", Greengrass doesn't use these elements and it forces us to watch the events as if it were a documentary or we are eavesdropping. Because of this, we witness the events unfold with clearer vision, which makes it all the more difficult to watch.<br /><br />Greengrass has populated the film with many less recognizable character actors; I only recognized many of the faces because I see a lot of films. He also asked a number of real life people who were involved in the events of the day to participate, allowing them to recreate their own actions. Thankfully, he chose against casting A List actors in some of the roles, allowing all of the characters to remain even and real, aiding the documentary look and feel of the film.<br /><br />Naturally, it will be difficult for many people to watch "United 93". The director has made an emotional, powerful, restrained film which will not make it easier.<br /><br />But it is an important film to watch. Maybe not today, next week or even next month. But we all need to see it, if for no other reason than to remind future generations because those who forget history are doomed to repeat it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KY68OTSNHM3G.html">A3KY68OTSNHM3G</a><br/><p>Director Paul Greengrass brings the story of United flight 93 to life in this fitting tribute to the heroes aboard the flight who refused to go quietly.  On September 11, 2001, four commercial airliners were hijacked by middle eastern terrorists.  Two of the planes were flown into the World Trade Center, one hit the Pentagon, and the fourth, flight 93, was destined for another target, most likely the White House or the U.S. Capitol, but thanks to the heroic efforts of the passengers and crew, the flight never reached its intended target.<br /><br />This move shows all aspects of that terrible day in September.  From the opening scenes of the terrorists preparing themselves for death to the scenes in the confused and hectic air control rooms, this film revisits one of the darkest days in our history.<br /><br />The story of flight 93 is inspiring and serves as a beacon of light which continues to shine today for those who remember 9/11.  The depiction of the flight in the movie is very good.  The movie begins with the passengers and crew boarding the aircraft for what initially appeared to be a normal flight from Newark to San Fransisco.  However, in the control rooms across the country, a much different story was unfolding.  One of the controllers reported hearing screams and foreign voices from one of the planes.  This turned out to be United flight 11.  The controllers cointinued to monitor the flight until, mysteriously, the plane disappeared from the screen.  This was the first plane to hit the World Trade Center.<br /><br />Meanwhile, aboard flight 93, the four terrorists sprung their own hijacking.  Using a homemade bomb (which was really fake) and box cutters, the terrorists managed to gain entrance into the cockpit and contol of the plane.  Immediately, the terrorists turned the plane around and began heading back east.  Several passenegrs, including the pilot and co-pilot, were stabbed by the terrorists.  Some of the passengers began making cell phone calls to loved ones on the ground, and in the process, they learned about the attacks on the WTC.  Realizing that their plane was probably going to be used in the same way as the ones which struck the WTC, the passengers began to formulate a plan to re-take the plane from the terrorists.  Despite the heroic efforts of the passengers and crew, the plane crashed in western Pennsylvania, about 10 minutes' flying time from Washington, D.C.  No one survived.<br /><br />This movie serves as  a stirring tribute to those heroic souls who banded together and fought to save not only themselves, but perhaps hundreds of others as well.  I was impressed with the coverage of the air traffic controllers and how they struggled with handling the hijackings.  It was both amazing and somewhat heart-wrenching seeing these dedicated people doing their best to ensure the safety of the people aboard the hijacked planes.<br /><br />The acting in the movie is very good.  Christian Clemenson (Tom Burnett), Cheyenne Jackson (Mark Bingham), David Alan Basche (Todd Beamer), and Peter Hermann (Jeremy Glick) give performances worthy of their characters' names. The other actors, especially the air traffic controllers, give rousing performances, also. The story is told with realism, but the viewer gets a sense of compassion as well.<br /><br />I highly recommend this heroic story about forty people who sat down as strangers, but stood up as one.  This movie honors the memory of the fallen with dignity and grace, and their story of heroism in the face of certain death should serve as a message to everyone.  Watch this fine movie and see how forty ordinary people banded together as one.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>`World Trade Center' was, unfortunately, the first of the two 9/11 based films I was able to see this year.  I was so unimpressed with WTC (aside from Maggie Gyllenhaal's wonderful performance) that I almost (and I stress almost) forfeited watching this film.  I'm so glad I rethought that idea.  This has to be one of the most touching and emotionally nerve racking movies I've seen in recent years and is such a triumph for movie making in general.  A lot of people were distressed since it has only been five years since the horrible events that circle this film, but when done as tastefully and as honestly as `United 93' we should be able to look passed our bias and embrace it for the tribute it truly is.<br /><br />Approaching the attack without bias was the one thing that truly impressed me about this film, for it showed both sides of the coin.  While yes, what was done was one of the most horrific acts our country has had to endure this film also gave us a look at the attackers who, while committing a horrible crime were not doing anything wrong in their own eyes.  There were many scenes that showed these men as they came close to their attack, the concern and the worry in their eyes, the panic.  They were scared, very scared.<br /><br />I don't want that to sound as if I condone what they've done because I don't, I just appreciate the way this film honestly portrayed the `villains' sort-of-speak instead of making them appear heartless and confident they appeared scared and panic-ridden.  It's a very commendable thing on the part of Greengrass.  Another smart move was having the film star almost no recognizable faces, so when we are watching this film we feel as though we are watching life, not a movie.  We can't say "oh Brad Pitt won't die" or "I just saw Kate Winslet talking to Oprah about how hard it was to film that scene"...all we can do is watch in horror as these unrecognizable faces deal with the unbelievable.  It's one of those movies, where even though you know the outcome your frustrated with everyone on board hoping they'll do something else, anything else to deliver a happy ending.<br /><br />No, this is far from a feel good film.  It will make you cry, it will make you proud (proud that we have people around us who are selfless enough to try and save others) and it will make you pray that nothing like this ever happens again.  One of the greatest achievements in cinema this year, `United 93' is a must see film!</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>I watched "United 93" a week after watching "Flight 93" again and while I have no problem with multiple tellings of the same story, it is interesting to compare and contrast the two films to better appreciate what is happening in this one.  Both films begin with the terrorist hijackers saying their morning prayers, a grotesque irony that continues to fuel the conflict between radical Islamic fundamentalists and the West.  But at that point writer-director Paul Greengrass sets a different tone for this theatrical film because we do not see any of the passengers and crews at their homes.  Instead we get to Newark Airport and the pilots and flight attendants walk on board the doomed flight, while the terrorists and passengers gather in the terminal.  In "Flight 93" we saw the names on the tickets of the passengers as they went through the final checkpoint, but in this film Greengrass makes no effort to clearly establish names (unless you turn on the subtitles, then names are identified when characters speak off camera).  You may know enough about the flight to recognize which character is Todd Beamer, Tom Burnett, Mark Bingham, or any of the others, but their individuality is not necessary to the story being told.  Greengrass talks about it being a collective experience and that is clearly his approach to telling the story.<br /><br />For me the most memorable parts of "Flight 93" were with the family members on the ground who were giving information and support to the passengers on the plane.  In "United 93" we never see or hear those family members, so the two films compliment each other in that regard.  What Greengrass offers it is place is the air traffic controlling system dealing with the hijackings, focusing on the inability to comprehend what was going on and the confusion as the system tried to catch up with events.  While he hired actors and actresses that would not be easily recognizable to viewers for everyone on United 93, Greengrass got several of the people at the FAA, the air traffic control systems, and even with the U.S. military, to play themselves.  Of course we do not recognize any of them, but the verisimilitude is from their language and their reactions, because what is ultimately important here is that Greengrass is not trying to explain the events of 9/11.  Instead, he is trying to recreate them and to depict the confusion rather than indicting or excusing it.  I think Greengrass makes it clear that even as the bits and pieces of key information emerge as to what is going one, that there was nothing that could be done for the simple reason that events that were unfolding were beyond imagination.  It is not until the second plane hits the second tower that the obvious connection led to the ultimate realization.<br /><br />The use of nonprofessional actors, the refusal to even identify let alone establish key characters, and the improvisational nature of the production, all give "United 93" a documentary feel.  Actually, the more I think about it I would amend that to be that the film lacks a lot of what we would expect in a Hollywood dramatization, so that it does not seem like a movie.  There is a sense that we are there, which is certainly a key part of documentaries, but that the movie unfolds in real time gives it much more of a sense of immediacy.  Technical jargon is being bandied about my lots of people, without ever bothering to explain what it all means, adding to the sense of confusion.  But we know what is going to happen and so we understand the irony that minutes after United 93 took off from Newark, with the tops of the World Trade Center towers visible out the window past one of the terrorists, when American 11 disappears on the air traffic control radar what has happened.  Not that this intellectual knowledge makes the emotional impact any less, because it is out ability to connect the dots and be ahead of the people we see on the screen that provides a lot of the power of the narrative.  The final act of the film takes place entirely on the airplane, where there is a real sense of how quickly the passengers put together the information, decided to act, and then tried to regain control of the plane.<br /><br />In his commentary track Greengrass gets into much more of the details of what happened that day, as well as emphasizing what he was trying to do with these scenes.  So if you want more of an explanation for what was happening, Greengrass provides that to some degree.  The one new element that stood out for me was the idea that one of the passengers knew how to fly a single engine plane, so that there was the hope that with the pilots dead there was somebody who could land the plan, albeit with a lot of help from ground control.  I am not sure what I think of introducing that element of hope, because one of the key elements of the heroism of these passengers was that stopping the terrorists from their objective (certainly either the White House or more probably the Capitol building), was as important as trying to regain control of the plane.<br /><br />While this film does not show the families of the passengers, there is an hour-long featurette on the families and the making of "United 93," so they are present on the DVD as well.  There are also memorial pages for all of the passengers and crew, posted by family members (arranged alphabetically by first name, in another nice touch).  Finally, there is a trailer for the Academy Award Winning Short Documentary "Twin Towers."  What you will not find here are any deleted scenes, although Greengrass talks about an alternative opening sequences set in Afghanistan.  It makes sense that a film told in real time would not have deleted scenes, but we know that there were alternate takes because of the improvisational nature of the film, so I want to applaud Greengrass for putting together his final cut and sticking with it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UKC6QFG9L5GV.html">A2UKC6QFG9L5GV</a><br/><p>On the September 11th, 2001 at about 5PM Moscow's time which is about 9AM in NYC I took a taxi to go home. The radio in the cab was on and the driver told me: "You know, they say an airliner rammed into one of the twin towers in New York". My first thought was: "How is that possible? You can't hit a skyscraper with an airplane, they don't fly that low over NYC. Even in case of emergency they'd rather make it into Hudson river" - as one of the characters of United 93 says. Some time later while I was still in the taxi we heard about the second plane that hit the southern tower. Right off I understood it's a terrorist attack, but still I had this feeling of irreality about what was going on. Even when I got home, turned on the TV and saw both WTC buildings on fire, I couldn't believe my own eyes. "That's impossible - I thought - that just can't be. It only happens in movies". 9/11 was the day everyone understood such things might happen in real life also. It was the first day that sent previous era to past - era of world's relative serenity and carelessness. From that day on we all suspect our telephone calls are being eavesdropped, we have to take off our shoes in airports, and some of us are even being bombed.<br /><br />This total tranquility is conveyed great in the beginning of United 93. The last calm hours or even minutes before the world changed are shown so objectively and impartially as if the filmmakers don't know themselves what's going to happen. And this lull is so frightening from today's perspective. Paul Greengrass made a great film which looks almost as a documentary and which derives much of its power from this fact. This is not a heroic, epic tale of survival and struggle, it's a quiet story about ordinary people who once woke up in hell and just like us refused to believe it all was true. But they had to fight to stay alive and these common people who were on the United 93 - managers, secretaries, sportsmen or whoever else were there - fought to stop this madness. Paul Greengrass took a viewer 5 years back and let him observe everything not from his armchair in front of the TV, but to actually BE there and to experience all the terror and anguish himself. And he succeeded indeed. There are no well-known actors in United 93 so that we can feel all the characters are real people just like us, one of the few familiar faces here is David Rasche, and we catch at him like people on the plane were grasping at him as at a straw because he (as a pilot) was their only hope to survive this nightmare. But although we hope till the very last minute that passangers will manage to win this fight, we are thrown into despair even deeper realizing we already know the outcome.<br /><br />United 93 is an utterly powerful and impressive picture. Probably the best way to pay the tribute to all the people who lost their lives on 9/11. And Paul Greengrass, being a good director, understood he didn't need a blockbuster with Bruce Willis to do that. He just needed a small, modest movie that almost like a documentary showed us real people in extraordinary circumstances and made us feel at least a grain of what they must have felt that day. This movie is recommended to everyone with no exceptions for it's one of the most potent pictures you'll ever see.</p></br><a href="../users/A26BWRBPP4V2WF.html">A26BWRBPP4V2WF</a><br/><p>United 93 is one of the most harrowing movie experiences you're likely to have. This is because, of course, it is based on a real event and the viewer will know the outcome - everyone on the plane dies.  As such, there is no way to know how many of the events depicted on the screen are factual - did the passengers overcome 2 of the hijackers and force their way into the cockpit?  Was the plane headed for the Capitol? (personally, I think it more likely it was headed to the Pentagon, just as 2 planes headed to the WTC)  Was the leader really having second thoughts?  If not, why did the hijackers take so long to make their moves, especially since they were already delayed 30 minutes before takeoff?<br /><br />As the writer and the director, Paul Greengrass speculates on the answers to these questions and presents a logical sequence of events, interspersed with factually verifiable events such as the timing of the WTC hits and the air traffic controllers' conversations.  These scenes recreate the confusion of 9/11 extremely effectively because, as Greengrass points out in the Director's commentary (multiple times), the use of airliners as cruise missiles was simply an inconceivable event.<br /><br />Most difficult to watch, however, are the phone calls home from the passengers on the plane as they call to say good-bye.  Presumably these are the actual words spoken by the passengers, and that verity is extremely personal and difficult to watch.<br /><br />So, if the film is not factual, and does not even claim to be factual, what does it have going for it?  Basically, it feels True.  It never dramatizes the events, and often the dialogue feels "overheard" (even the famous "Let's roll").  The passengers are scared, but in their fear they realise (perhaps the first in the country) what's going on and choose to act.  We never learn anything about them - another correct step by Greengrass, whose goal appears to be putting the film viewer on the plane with the passengers.  They are strangers to us, they are strangers to each other, but they are all in it together and trust each.  Greengrass has been criticized for humanizing the hijackers.  But, of course, the hijackers WERE humans, and to portray them as monsters or psychopaths would deny human nature.<br /><br />Obviously many (most?) will find the film impossible to watch.  For those that can (and you know who you are), you will find newfound respect for the courage of the common man, and newfound sympathy for the people involved - not only those that perished, but those air traffic controllers and others that tried their best in an impossible situation to regain control of a situation they could not have conceieved of that morning when they went to work.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>Paul Greengrass had a hefty undertaking here.  Not even five years had passed since the tragic events of 9/11 took place before Greengrass started filming his tribute to the brave souls aboard United 93.  The horrific events were not only still fresh in the minds of the American public but the subject was sore indeed.  Greengrass was either going to succeed in bringing the American public together in their praise and admiration of his film or he was going to send them running from the theaters in aggravation and frustration and thus risked becoming the director labeled as the one who failed to do justice to such a grave subject.<br /><br />I think we can all agree that Greengrass succeeded marvelously here.<br /><br />`United 93' is a beautifully honest rendering of the tragic day known as 9/11.  Taking an honest look into not only the lives of the `victims' aboard the plane but also the hijackers and the befuddled men and women on the ground, `United 93' is able to reach into the pit of its audiences soul and extract a real connection to the events taking place on the screen.<br /><br />The film opens with a calm and eerie depiction of the four men responsible for this tragedy preparing themselves for their `mission'.  It's the perfect way to open the film for it automatically lets us know who these men our.  What I appreciate about what Greengrass does here is that, instead of shooting for the obvious and making this film all about how `evil' and `sadistic' these hijackers were he goes for the more intellectual route by showing us how `human' they were.  They honestly thought they were doing gods will.  It doesn't excuse their horrific actions, and of course neither does this film, but Greengrass successfully creates human `villains' for us.<br /><br />As effective as the opening is, it's the ending that will really stay with you.  As much as we know how this story ends we find ourselves anticipating the passengers to `save the day' so-to-speak and so when the film abruptly ends we are left heartbroken all over again, as if we are hearing about these events for the first time.<br /><br />Another aspect of `United 93' that is so masterful is the way Greengrass is able to depict the sudden and effortless decline into confusion and frustration, especially when concerning the men and women still on the ground.  As we are led through the events unfolding before the air traffic controllers we are instantly placed in their shoes and this overwhelming feeling of panic and desperation is etched across our bodies.  We feel tense; we feel scared; we feel alone.  By capturing this feeling Greengrass is able to keep the intensity high throughout the entire film, never losing the mood of the film.<br /><br />The performances by the cast of unknowns are fantastic; utterly flawless.  By casting real life airline employees he was able to capture a true human nature to the reactions of the crew as well as the passengers.  Also, but casting no-name actors he was able to capture the raw realism of the events.  There are no recognizable faces here so there is no way we can be taken out of the film so-to-speak.  This way we are always thinking about the people being portrayed and not the actor doing the portraying.<br /><br />I think when speaking of the acting one must point out the brilliance of the four actors portraying the hijackers.  Khalid Abdalla, Lewis Alsamari, Omar Berdouni and Jamie Harding all attacked these roles with fearlessness and confidence.  It was a brave thing, taking on the roles of men who are so loathed, feared and detested in America, but the manage to make these men real and human and thus utterly blew me away.  Ben Sliney has also received a lot of attention and praise for his performance (he played himself).  I must also mention him and his masterful performance; truly grounded and natural.<br /><br />In the end though, this film belongs to Paul Greengrass.  His direction of this film is flawless (that Oscar should have been his).  His tribute is so honorable.  That word seems appropriate for this film; honorable.  It handles the events, not with sugarcoated delicacy but with emotional resonance and realistic humanity.  The film is gritty and raw and abrasive but in a way that captures the heart of the people involved.<br /><br />`United 93' is one of the most controversial films around, and truly one of the most difficult to sit through; but it is a masterpiece of modern film making and is a film that everyone should experience at least once.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JVSIWDF0WT22.html">A1JVSIWDF0WT22</a><br/><p>This is one of those films where you feel you're watching the real thing. I loved the way the director shows us the confusion among the traffic controlers and military personel. I also liked the fact they never try to show the passengers as action heroes but instead as regular people reacting the way most of us would have. By the end my stomach was in knots. Only problem with buying this DVD: who would ever want to see this film in a regular basis ? Not me so I'll pass on what I consider 5 star material.</p></br><a href="../users/A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ.html">A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ</a><br/><p>Why do I think so?<br /><br />There's no Jack Nicholson, no Spielberg, no Peter Jackson, but what it does have is an incredible attention to detail and realism that will have you riveted from beginning to end.<br /><br />Each frame of film captures the heart-breaking moments as the passengers unknowningly board UNITED 93, not unlike any of us would at any occasion, or the hectic job of an air traffic controller and the mistakes that were made, the red tape and numerous hoops that people had to jump through to get things done, all being too late, the insanity that drove the CULTISH Muslim terrorists to murder thousands on that day in the name of GOD, and ultimately the passengers of 93 that realized their fate and did the only thing they could... fight back.<br /><br />UNITED 93 is not to be missed and without question should at least be a nominee for a 2006 Oscar for best picture.<br /><br />The genius of UNITED 93 is that it didn't play like a movie. It's unconventional storytelling method is quite simply, REALISM. The documentary feel. Many of the air traffic controllers and FFA tower operators played themselves, really lending to the realism of the film. The actors didn't play like actors... they are real. They do their jobs and their roles so capably, you don't think you're watching a film. You are watching the real events.<br /><br />Finally, UNITED 93 will pose questions. Like any great film should. Why were the heads of the FAA and the military so slow to react? Why did they doubt when they were told what was going on by a air traffic controller? Why wasn't the government brought into the loop sooner? and finally, how can Muslim men be so brainwashed, that they could believe that GOD, could condone and ask them to MURDER thousands of people who are peaceful, going to work and of many different races (many fellow Muslims) and countries.<br /><br />They have obviously never been to New York City to see how EVERY race, religion, creed and sex is welcomed and has been thriving peacefully for years... together.<br /><br />UNITED 93 is not to be missed.</p></br><a href="../users/A1P2NBM3P3TS2X.html">A1P2NBM3P3TS2X</a><br/><p>I spent a great deal of time over the past 5 years since 9/11 speculating about what might have happened on the United 93 flight after the passengers found out about the morning's events.  Mostly, I questioned whether I would have had the courage to take action as some of the passengers evidently did, or if I would have cowered in a corner, a snivelling coward waiting to die and crying quick and hot tears over a life not lived to its fullest.<br /><br />Among the many emotional responses I had to this electrifying film when I saw it in a shamefully empty theatre the day it came out, "United 93" made me face that question again in a very aggressive and in-your-face way.  This isn't just a story of tragic events.  It is a story of human character.<br /><br />Equally terrified during the day's events were the various civilian and military airline control center employees.  Forced to act quickly and decisively when dealing with partial facts and a rapidly-unfolding terror timeclock, they were having to take action while the vast majority of people in the world were standing around dumbstruck and speechless.<br /><br />"United 93" covers the day's events in docudrama style from multiple agencies' perspectives and every single one of them draws you in and grabs you by the throat.<br /><br />I could hear people in the theatre stop breathing several times.  There was more than a little crying.<br /><br />Much was made in the press about how it may have been "too soon" to tell this story again in such a frank and brutally honest way.  Well guess what -- it some ways it will ALWAYS be too soon, but that doesn't mean the story shouldn't be told.  We all need to watch this to remind ourselves of how it felt to be so scared and emotionally raw.  Don't wait until you've let Time numb you to the day's events.<br /><br />This movie works on every level it intended to.  The fact that it is both difficult to sit through and impossible to turn away from is a testament to not only the powerful nature of the events themselves but also to the filmmakers' unflinching and honest presentation of them.<br /><br />This could have been a sappy melodramatic TV movie that pulled punches and glossed over painful details.  Instead, this film feels more "real" than any film in recent memory.<br /><br />When you watch it at home, please maximize the impact of the experience by recreating the Theatrical experience as best you can:  Turn off all the lights, unplug the phone, go the bathroom in advance, and keep the chatter down.<br /><br />This is too important an experience to treat like just another Weekday Night on the Couch.<br /><br />**** In spite of the fact that I am more convinced with each passing day that the conspiracy theorists about 9/11 may actually be telling the ugly truth, I still will re-iterate that "United 93" is a stunningly powerful work of dramatic cinema.  Whether the significant details are even remotely true or not, it doesn't lessen the emotional impact of the story as told by this film.  Is that disclaimer objective enough? ****</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZOF747O5EB6R.html">A1ZOF747O5EB6R</a><br/><p>"United 93" is probably the most compelling and dramatic work of film that I have ever seen!  It's a roller coaster ride of adrenalin and jagged emotions.  It's also poignant at times and very close to the bone.  Most importantly, it's about an event that was true.<br /><br />I saw "United 93" in Sydney as part of the Sydney Film Festival where it received applause at its end.  This rarely happens in Australia.  This is a film that touches everyone.  It is a film that must be seen!<br /><br />Of course, we all know what happened on 11 September 2001.  Thus, the core of the film has no surprises.  However, having said this, the film so clearly reveals how ordinary people going about their own lives were suddenly thrust into a living hell.  Psychotic religious fanatics had come to believe that by hijacking planes and killing innocent people that this would somehow damage the US and heighten the spread of Islam.  Has collective lunacy ever reached such insane heights?  These criminals were not warriors, they were simply misguided killers.  Their inherent evil, unfortunately, came at the cost of so many lives.<br /><br />This film covers the events of that tragic day very well.  We see chaos as both individuals and government bodies simply fail to adequately comprehend the events unfolding around them.  This should come as no surprise as there would be no one who could have expected criminal stupidity on the scale that was seen on that bright September day.  To all those involved in the making of "United 93", you are owed much gratitude as you have so lucidly told a tale of courage in the face of evil.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>United 93 is an emotionally, realistic, honest work from writer/director Paul Greengrass. I heard the only actors were the people abroad the plane but the air traffic controllers, flight attendants, and pilots were played by real people. This movie is amazing and so harrowing, I highly recommend this film because United 93 is so much more moving than Oliver Stone's stiff and uninspiring, World Trade Center. Greengrass truly wrote a wonderful and moving story and it breaks my heart to think of the real life passengers abroad that plane on that fateful day. United 93 never seems wishy washy, flimsy or contrived in any way. This film is told with class and that's the best word to describe this gut-wrenching film. Please do not wait to buy this movie, it will touch you profoundly. And by the way, this movie should've been nominated for best picture at the Academy Awards, I am glad Greengrass was nominated for director but this movie deserved so much recognition and honor than what it actually got, how sad!</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>I put off seeing "United 93" for a long time, thinking it might be either sensational or self-pitying. But when I finally did sit down to watch this movie, I found it thoughtful and absorbing. British filmmaker Paul Greenberg wrote and directed "United 93" in a docudrama style that hasn't been employed this successfully in decades. He populated the film with real pilots, real flight attendants, real air traffic controllers, and real military professionals, some of them also actors, who lend authenticity to the recreations. The scenes in the air traffic control centers were filmed in real time, as the participants and actors reenacted the morning of September 11, 2001. Ben Sliney, who was in charge at the National Air Traffic Command Center that day, reprises his own role compellingly. The result is an extraordinary film that is at once riveting drama and an important contribution to the continually unfolding aftermath of 9/11.<br /><br />"United 93" recreates 1 hour and 51 minutes of the morning of September 11, 2001, much of it in real time -though the beginning of the film seems compressed, as passengers and flight crew arrive at the airport and board the plane. The action shifts between United Airlines Flight 93, the National Air Traffic Command Center in Herndon, VA, the air traffic control towers in Boston, New York, and Cleveland, and the Northeast Air Defense Center (NORAD) in Rome, New York. The first hour gives us an inside look at air traffic and military professionals as they struggle to understand what is going on and implement some sort of response. The film demonstrates an acute awareness of the systems on which our modern world depend and the fragility that became apparent when a group of determined individuals decided to assault our modernity.<br /><br />No one knows precisely what went on on United Flight 93. Paul Greenberg assumed the delicate job of creating "a believable truth" for an event that is deeply steeped in politics and mythology. Greenberg was up to the task, and "United 93" could not be better. Sensitive without melodrama, suspenseful instead of sensational, reflective but not passive, "United 93" fulfills the need to understand and memorialize the events of September 11, 2001, for the families of the deceased, for Americans of all political stripes, and for a culture that still struggles to put these events in context and to decipher their implications. That's a tall order, and I could not praise "United 93" more highly for delivering on it.<br /><br />The DVD (Universal 2006 single disc): In "United 93: The Families and the Film" (1 hour), some families of passengers who perished on United 93 talk about their loved ones and meet the actors who play their family members in the movie. "Memorial Pages" (text) are a list of the 30 passengers and crew who died on United Flight 93 with a bio of each. "Twin Towers" (2 min) is a promotion of a short documentary about 2 brothers, one policeman and one firefighter, who responded to the World Trade Center on 9/11. The audio commentary by Paul Greenberg is thoughtful and worthwhile, especially the first half. The second half is a bit repetitive. He talks about the film's structure, what he left out and why, technical challenges, and comments a great deal on the film's ideas. He unfortunately doesn't say which parts of the action on board Flight 93 is fact and what was extrapolated. Subtitles for the film are available in English SDH, French, Spanish. Dubbing is available in French, Spanish. DVS is available for the visually impaired.</p></br><a href="../users/A27H9DOUGY9FOS.html">A27H9DOUGY9FOS</a><br/><p>As we approached the end of 2006, everyone released their pick for the top films of that year. I do the same thing every year as I assess the movies that I've had the pleasure of viewing, either on the big screen or on DVD. 2006, in truth, wasn't the strongest year--but there were a fair share of surprises. While many of the blockbusters actually surpassed my expectations with unusual depth or sheer adrenaline, it is many of the smaller films that lingered in my memory. "United 93" was a moderate hit at the box office and received pretty universal critical acclaim, but there was not much expectation that it would fare well come awards season. It was released very early in the year which is usually problematic. However, to my delight--the film was remembered and honored as one of the year's top films and its reputation has endured and grown stronger.<br /><br />"United 93," for my money, was the best film of 2006. Sparse and powerful, this docudrama took about 90 minutes of real time to unfold one of the most matter-of-factly harrowing and heroic episodes put down on film. Far from being a political diatribe, the film documents a real humanity and the commonality that pulls ordinary people together in a time of crisis. Offering almost no commentary, "United 93" just presents the facts of the situation about that ill-fated flight. Reconstructed largely from actual participants and phone records, this is about as close to reality as a narrative film can get.<br /><br />In an audacious decision, director Paul Greengrass does not ask that we know the passengers or ground crew as individuals. You see them in brief, slice-of-life moments as they ready themselves for the day--but there is no backstory, no manufactured drama. It's just a cross section of regular men and women doing mundane things on what will become a most extraordinary day. You will start to know some of the individuals from their actions and their responses, but the film doesn't offer anything extraneous. This simplicity and lack of ordinary storytelling convention sets "United 93" apart.<br /><br />By allowing an objective viewpoint, the film achieves a power that is more inherently real than 99% of scripted films. There is an honor and dignity at work here that's quite unexpected. Even though the film plays with a documentary feel, it ends up almost impossible not to envision yourself in the same situation. As such, "United 93" strikes a real and resonant emotional chord. It's easy to only accept this film as a poignant document of that day and a tribute to those involved. And that it is. It's also easy for those who wish to dismiss it as a cover-up to conspiracy theories to do so. But what I don't want to get lost in any political debate is the fact that this is also great filmmaking.<br /><br />I was more affected by this film emotionally than any other film of that year. And I have reflected on it more often than any other film in recent years. For those reasons, "United 93" was easily my choice for best film of its year. Heartbreaking, Intelligent, Horrifying, Uplifting--It's perfect. KGHarris, 12/06.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JH5J1KQAUBMP.html">A1JH5J1KQAUBMP</a><br/><p>Writer / director Paul Greengrass presents a plausible imagining of events aboard the ill-fated United Flight 93, which went down in a grassy field after the passengers stormed the cockpit rather than allow the hijackers to pursue their objective unchallenged.  This story is interwoven with the events in various control rooms as air traffic controllers and military personnel gradually realize what is happening and find to their horror that they are unprepared to stop it.<br /><br />This film keeps a tight focus on the events of the day, thereby honoring the memories of the fallen by keeping our attention on their plight and their reaction to it, rather than making political points about the big picture.  There is no mention of Osama bin Laden, Al Qaeda, Afghanistan, or Iraq.  The audience becomes observers at the various locations and learns nothing that the actual participants would not have known.  We learn nothing more of the passengers on United 93 than we would if we were fellow travelers on the same flight.  The result is far more powerful than if the filmmakers had strained for effect through trumped up sentimental backstories or political proselytizing.  We are presented with a day of horror and confusion and the nobility of average people struggling to confront it with courage and dignity.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NSUJJCG73IRF.html">A1NSUJJCG73IRF</a><br/><p>Director:  Paul Greengrass<br /><br />Cast:  Christian Clemenson, Trish Gates, Polly Adams, Cheyenne Jackson, Opal Alladin, Gary Commock, Nancy McDoniel, David Allen Basche, Richard Bekins.<br /><br />Running Time: 111 minutes<br /><br />Rated R for language and some intense sequences of terror and violence (although a PG-13 rating is probably more appropriate and the film's producers have appealed the initial rating).<br /><br />There weren't many notes you could take, whether it be in the equilibrious opening or the terrifying denouement that can describe the feelings you endure along "United 93". Ample publicity has been sold on Paul Greengrass' new movie, debating the veracity of its story and whether there was a need for it to be made in the first place. How soon is too soon? How long did America wait to tell of Vietnam's nightmares? You would have been forgiven for thinking it blasphemous to even entertain the idea of shooting a movie on 9/11, yet despite the controversy United 93 is here, and will attract an audience regardless (or maybe even as a result of) its negative press.<br /><br />Shot in real time, on digital camera, "United 93" begins with showing us the terrorists making their final morning prayers, before setting off to the airport. There are no handsome grins, nor are there nasty frowns. These men, if anything, look more terrified than you ever could. Their intentions are hidden behind an obvious human front that continually puts them at odds with themselves. We then shift to the airport's other passengers, none of which are ever given an emotional edge to them. As the film goes on we visit the men and women behind the running of the airwaves - particularly those responsible for what should happen in case of emergencies. Many of the actors betraying these people are the people themselves, who were there on that tragic day. Using non-actors gives Greengrass' film an authentic breeze of dialogue and behavior that never seems forced or embellished. Whilst we never truly get a feel for any individual character we believe every word they say, and truly understand the circumstances they were put in as the tragedies unfolded. We learn how difficult it was to get in touch with the White House, when the people needed their government the most. We also learn of the confusion experienced as these planes went strangely off course before any conclusive knowledge of a hijacking had been established. But the film's biggest power lies in the chilling reenactment of the fate of flight 93. All forms of dramatic irony are completely dropped. We can feel unease just by the soft, subtle touch of the film's score. During the opening the characters act like any man would in these types of totally conventional circumstances. Greengrass does not incorporate a view of hindsight for his audience, instead allowing the film to flow in the moment, with each passing event happening as the characters read it, rather than what the audience already knows occurred. It isn't a movie that allows much headway for dramatic convention, nor does it satisfy are needs for entertainment (which, perhaps, is what "Titanic" was aiming to do). All it ever tries to do, and what it achieves in great effect, is a tribute to the courage and bravery of the passengers and staff aboard United 93.<br /><br />Paul Grenngrass' masterpiece is the anti-"Titanic": there are no star-crossed lovers, no dastardly bad guys, no romantic journeys and absolutely zero poetic license. This is as frighteningly real as a movie gets. The characters of "United 93" are so authentic it verges on the mundane at times. The characters aren't meant to have depth, nor are they meant to go through life-affirming changes. The film is a fine illustration, similar to the faux-documentaries that Greengrass directed in his native Great Britain that documents the haunting ordeal induced by the passengers, and their subsequent bravery in attempting to foil the terrorists. The final sequence is one of the most terrifying set-pieces ever put on film, managing to raise every strand on my body to an electric edge, as the passengers desperately try to kick down the cabin door when, in one blisteringly quick moment of hope, you actually believed they can prevent it. That they can save themselves. And for this reason alone, it is a masterful piece of work, deserving of the highest praise a film can receive. Regardless of what your stance was before the film was released, "United 93" is a film you have to see. You owe it to the people it illustrates, in fittingly faux-reality style, and whose bravery it commends. As a film viewer all we could ever ask of a film is to work as a piece of art. That is all anyone should ever ask. It is, at times, worrying, distressing, haunting and terrifying. But never wrong and certainly a piece of art.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NZAGMAS7N5ZP.html">A2NZAGMAS7N5ZP</a><br/><p>Okay, It's been 5 years since 9/11.And the question comes to our mind whether it is time to do a movie about the attacks or not. In my opinion it is time, people are trying to put the thought of what happened so far back as if it never happened, and I understand the least we want to do is remember that tragic event, but we shouldn't remember it just for the tragedy but also for the day that we all stood up as one. Stood up united. And that's exactly what this movie does. Instead of making it a usual Hollywood movie, director Paul Green grass has managed to deliver something more human, entirely shot in a documentary style. This type of movie should be seen by everyone, and as I said not for the tragedy that occurred to the passengers, but for the historical aspect, and to make us remember that this is a country that stands united, and that we will fight to the last.<br /><br />MY PERSONAL RATING: 5 OUT OF 5</p></br><a href="../users/A10ODC971MDHV8.html">A10ODC971MDHV8</a><br/><p>Filmed in real time using actual United personnel and air-traffic controllers, along with a fine ensemble cast of nonpro actors, Greengrass's ultra-realistic tribute to the victims of 9/11 has the jittery look and flavor of a documentary, though it is largely speculative. Most faithfully, we witness the confusion of authorities on the ground as they begin to suspect that not one, but several planes, have been hijacked, then desperately try to scramble F16s and reroute thousands of aircraft after the first jet hits the World Trade Center. Harrowing to watch and horrifying to contemplate, "United 93" is ultimately an important, respectful film about the extraordinary resolve of ordinary people.</p></br></body></html>

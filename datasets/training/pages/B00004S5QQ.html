But if you do, then THIS IS IT!<br /><br />This is still my favorite black & white classic film of all time (followed very, very closely by CITIZEN KANE.  Hey, I had to chose one, right?)!<br /><br />This film is the whole reason I got a DVD player in the first place.  Nothing looks as beautiful and as crisp as classic b&w cinema.  This was the first DVD I ever bought!<br /><br />Like a Honda automobile, this film speaks for itself, so I won't waste time with a rehash of every praised word that could be said.  Let me say only that when the AFI recently did their list of the top 100 greatest movie lines of all time, CASABLANCA was chosen the most (6 times).<br /><br />Here's lookin' at you!</p></br><a href="../users/A3S98L5B1SR9P1.html">A3S98L5B1SR9P1</a><br/><p>Wow, where to start. Quite simply, this has to be one of the greatest movies ever made. Now realize that this is coming from me, a 16-year-old! I don't consider myself anything of a film expert, but I know a good film when I see one. It's hard to imagine that the part of Rick was originally scripted for Ronald Reagan, but Bogart's performance is flawless, as is Bergman's. I also find it somewhat ironic that it spawned a catch phrase that was never spoken verbatum in the film, but aside from that, wow. A lot of people may find the storyline somewhat dry by today's standards, but I love it. All of the actors have marvelous voices. Casablanca only gets better 'As Time Goes By' (neat little reference, eh?), and I highly recommend it to anyone with a pulse and a soul. If you must see one more movie before you die, it doesn't get any better than Casablanca.<br /><br />Also, Bogart fans should check out "The Maltese Falcon" and "The Enforcer".</p></br><a href="../users/A34PAZQ73SL163.html">A34PAZQ73SL163</a><br/><p>Casablanca is one of the few movies that is every bit as good as its hype.  The story moves at a frantic, but believable, pace.  Like all of the great ones, this film is not tarnished by its age.  The unfortunate thing is that, in 2005, so much of the dialogue has so fully entered our cultural lexicon that the new viewer may be disappointed as to how cliche it sounds.  Yet, none of the lines like "play it again Sam," "...out of all of the gin joints" and "this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship," were ever heard before Casablanca's release. Sure, Bogey is stupendous as is Bergman but what about Claude Rains? He practically steals the title role away from Rick.  His character is incredibly complex and interesting.  It is somewhat amusing as to the favorable spin that the French are given, but we must remember that back in 1941 they were a defeated ally.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ.html">A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ</a><br/><p>Ah, they don't make them like this anymore. The sense of duty, of loyalty,  and of staying where you need to be, regardless of your own feelings, is  what makes this story stand out and shine. &quot;English Patient&quot; and  films with a similar plot can never match up to  this.<p>&quot;Casablanca&quot; is a French city in the middle of the  Middle-Eastern desert, now overrun with Nazis. Humphrey Bogart plays Rick  Blaine, the cynical owner of Casablanca's best-known bar. The only person  who knows anything real about Rick is the piano player, Sam (known for the  immortal lines &quot;Sam, I thought I told you never to play...&quot; and  &quot;Play it again, Sam&quot;) who was present in Paris long ago when  Rick's heart was broken.<p>Years ago, Rick fell in love with a beautiful  woman named Ilse in Paris, who vanished when the Germans invaded. Now she's  back with her husband--Victor Laszlo, a patriot who works for the  underground. Rick is (not surprisingly) angry, even though he still loves  Ilse, and she still loves him.<p>Bogart and Bergman exude excellent  chemistry--you can feel their pain and love. The cast is also blessed by  wonderful secondary characters, such as Sam, who seems to feel sorry for  Rick and Ilse; and Captain Louis Renault, a lovably amoral French official.  There's also a slimy little conman named Ugarte, and a slimy big  casino-owner named Renault, both of whom sell fake exit visas (these  characters, as well as Bogart, can be found in the &quot;Maltese  Falcon,&quot; so watch for them)<p>Rick is a great man: He's hardened and  cynical, but as we watch, he helps people who have nothing for themselves,  and gives away his own happiness. The script also gives him many of the  wonderful lines: when little rat Ugarte asks, &quot;You despise me, don't  you?&quot;, Rick's only reply is, &quot;If I gave you any thought I  probably would.&quot; <p>Though this is rated PG, most kids will be bored  silly by it--there's a lot of talking and angst and romance. Also, there's  one scene where a Bulgarian girl delicately hints at prostitution, but  anyone younger than their teens probably wouldn't pick it up (she only  refers to it as a &quot;bad thing&quot;).<p>The sets are beautiful and  harsh, as harsh as Rick sees the world. The last scene is perhaps one of  the most famous in movie history. Like Audrey Hepburn's &quot;Roman  Holiday,&quot; the realistic and mature approach to difficult situations  are what make this story special. One of the best romances ever  filmed.<p>&quot;Here's looking at you, kid.&quot;</p></br><a href="../users/A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z.html">A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z</a><br/><p>When CASABLANCA was widely released to theaters in January 1943, its producers and Warner's had no inkling that this would become a cinematic immortal. (Events similar to what occurred with Fox's 1951 sci-fier, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JKFR">THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL</a>.)<br /><br />In the seven decades since a never mounted stageplay called "Everybody Comes to Rick's" was adapted for the screen by the Epstein twins and Howard Koch, CASABLANCA has spawned two short-lived TV series, but wisely on the part of filmmakers, no motion picture rehashes. Here we have an ideal cast following a perfect script; a timeless love story that ends happily for no one that's set in a North African stopping point for refugees of a merciless war. Their German oppressors are here as well in these final days before the Allied invasion of North Africa.<br /><br />Former gun runner Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) owns "Rick's Caf&eacute; Am&eacute;ricain", a place that folks of all political persuasions and nationalities gravitate to. His loyal friend and piano artist&eacute; Sam (Dooley Wilson) performs every song but one, that is until Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman) wanders in, spots him at the keys and coos, "Play 'As Time Goes By'." When Rick storms over to chastise Sam for the song he never wants to hear, he and Ilsa are reunited. We soon learn of their affair in Paris and sudden parting while Germans marched in, Rick's hard feelings at Ilsa's disappearance that day, and the love which yet remains within him.<br /><br />All this amid the chaos of other lives, people scrambling for impossible to get papers of transit even as an ever-present enemy heightens their awareness of danger. The Italian Ugarte (Peter Lorre) gives Rick two of these priceless letters just before he's arrested by Louis Renault (Claude Rains), a corrupt police captain. Ugarte dies in custody, leaving an embittered Rick with the dilemma of giving the transit docs to Ilsa and her husband, Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid), a Czech Resistance refugee, or saving them for his own escape. Lazlo selflessly suggests that Rick use the papers to escort Ilsa to safety while he remains in Casablanca. Then Laszlo is arrested by Renault on a false charge...<br /><br />CASABLANCA is the one film that all Classic Era movie fans should own, and the one to be seen repeatedly. It never ages, defying time itself even "as time goes by."</p></br><a href="../users/A18OUQEK7IZ2F2.html">A18OUQEK7IZ2F2</a><br/><p>All-time great is presented well in the Two-Disc Special Edition: two full commentaries plus an entire disc full of extras.<br /><br />Clean transfer, great character actors, timeless story.<br /><br />PLAY IT AGAIN, SAM!</p></br><a href="../users/A34D06JL7LC6MU.html">A34D06JL7LC6MU</a><br/><p>"Casablanca" is a landmark film. It's 64 years old and yet most of the dialogue is still quoted today, it's #2 on The American Film Institute's Top 100 (just directly below "Citizen Kane"), and is a true masterpiece of film.<br /><br />I typically don't watch films from this era, I've never seen a film with Humphrey Bogart or Ingrid Bergman; This is not the most entertaining of several of my favorite movies that are on AFI's list below this film, nor is this the second most entertaining film ever made...But it is an important one; But that's not why I'm giving it 5 stars. The biggest thing I look for when reviewing a film in the quality of entertainment; I don't care how important the movie is, if it's kind of dull I won't rank it that high. This film is a beautiful and entertaining film; The cinematography/lighting is beautiful, the dialogue is beautiful, the acting is wonderful, the film is incredibly influential. Anyway; The movie is set against the backdrop of World War II in Casablanca and takes place mostly in a gambling/gin joint owned by Rick Blaine (Bogart), a distant kind of guy who "doesn't stick his neck out for anybody" and seems to find no enjoyment in life. He runs his gin joint and that's it. After some transfer papers are stolen (and are subsequently being looked for by the Germans) and are given to Rick, the man who gives them to him is arrested shortly after and Rick awaits the gentlemen who will pick them up. That man is Victor Laszlo, who is famous for having spent a year in a concentration camp and escaping; Also along with Laszlo is his beautiful wife Isla Lund (Bergman), who is tied to Rick's past. Back in 1942, the film won 3 Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Screenplay. How it lost (although I'm not sure if it was even nominated) Best Cinematography and Best Actor is beyond me. As I said, I've never seen a film with Humphrey Bogart before but the man is an amazing actor. He has this way of speaking and a way of moving that really sucks you in. Some of the dialogue (although it is great) wouldn't work coming out of other actors mouths; Here, it's perfectly fine. "Here's looking at you kid" and "I believe this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship" is classic movie dialogue that we will no doubt here for a much longer time. This isn't a movie the whole family can rent for a night of Saturday night entertainment; But for film buffs and classic film mongers, this is a film you can't miss.<br /><br />GRADE: A</p></br><a href="../users/A2XRZV63X79YSJ.html">A2XRZV63X79YSJ</a><br/><p>Writing a review of Casablanca is redundant.  Most people interested in film already know this film.  Most think this film to be one of the best, myself included.<br /><br />Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman were both major stars when this film was made but this film took them to an even higher level of stardom.<br /><br />Casablanca is a French province and therefore only under occupational German forces.  This is the place where those trying to escape the war have fled.<br /><br />Rick (Bogie) is the owner of the shady caf&eacute; (and casino).  He fled Paris when the Germans arrived.  He was split away from his love Ilsa (Bergman).  One night in his casino, Ilsa appears.  At first Rick thinks that his love has returned.  Then he finds out that she is married and to the Nazi's most wanted man, Victor Lazlo.  Rick has two authentic travel visas.  The question is are they for Rick and Ilsa or Ilsa and Victor.<br /><br />This is one of the great war movies, one of the great romance movies, one of the a films.<br /><br />This film has two DVD releases: this one and a special edition with additional featurettes.  The question is for each buyer is do you want to spend the extra money for extra featurettes.<br /><br />DVD EXTRAS:<br /><br />Documentary - You Must Remember This - Hosted by Mrs. Bogart (Lauren Bacall) - Excellent<br /><br />Introduction by Lauren Bacall - Again excellent</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZSC81MXLBELX.html">A2ZSC81MXLBELX</a><br/><p>CASABLANCA....The name alone conjurs up visions of World War II, Clandestine meetings, Romance and Exotic places.This film has all that and more. To  sum up this wonderful story(I'm so thrilled about the DVD I want to get to that too), it is the eve of WWII, the Nazi's are moving their way across Europe, forcing thousands to flee.  Many find their way to Casablanca, Morroco, which is under French rule and as of yet is unoccupied by the Nazi's. Most are looking for exit Visa's to get to America but it is easier said then done. Victor Laszlo(Paul Henreid)and his wife Ilsa(Ingrid Bergman)are among those people and it's harder for him then most. He is on the Nazi's most wanted list for leading the Czech Resistance. Rick Blaine(Humphrey Bogart)is his best hope.<br />  Rick, American ex-patriot,doesnt stick his neck out for anybody, until he sees Ilsa. His old flame, that mysteriously left him in Paris,("We'll always have Paris"). Rick still feels the sting of that day,but  as Ilsa's story unfolds he does stick his neck out for both Ilsa and Victor to help them get away, even though he loves her still.<br />This movie has some unforgetable music. including "As Time Goes By",("Play it Sam") and some unforgetable characters. Included in this marvelous cast are Claude Rains, ("Louie, I think this is the start of a beautiful freindship"), Peter Lorre,Conrad Veidt and Sydney Greenstreet. And don't forgot all the unforgetable lines, I've tried to mention a few here. It was directed by Michael Curtiz, and won the academy award for best picture of 1943.<br />  The DVD(Warner Bros) is a Pristeen transfer. The black and white cinematography with all it's shadows and lights that make film noir so dramatic is crisp and clear.I saw no signs of the age of this film.  Ingrid's eyes sparkle as much as her diamond earings.The sound is perfect. The disc includes a documentary hosted by Lauren Bacall with commentary by various people involved with the film. There are theatrical trailers for this and other film noirs and there are English and French subtitles for those in need of it.<br />"Here's looking at you kid"............Laurie<br /><br />also available in 3-pack of oscar greats:<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000087EYC">Best Picture Collection - Epic Dramas (Casablanca/Gone With the Wind/Ben-Hur)</a></p></br><a href="../users/A2C7BOQVFH1HLE.html">A2C7BOQVFH1HLE</a><br/><p>As a true classic should be, this movie is so good that you actually look forward to viewing it again and again just so you can be sure you didn't miss anything the last time you viewed it.  The cast is excellent, the acting sublime, the soundtrack is inspired and the screenplay is also exquisite.  Special mention should be made for actors like Peter Lorre, Sidney Greenstreet and Claude Rains who are excellent here just as they were in other film classics such as "The Maltese Falcon" and "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington".  Although this is not Bogart's best performance (for that you'll need to see "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre"), he still puts in an excellent performance here.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this DVD version is very poor, especially so for the sound quality which is very poor.  The volume levels are very soft and although the picture quality is much better, there is still room for improvement.  With the advent of Blu-ray now, here's hoping that Warner will make the effort to produce a much better restoration project on this film improving upon the picture quality as well as and especially upon the sound quality adding DTS with THX or at least Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround options to really give this film the truly great restoration that it deserves.  Also, the Special Features are really sparse comprising really only of an interesting documentary hosted by Bogart's wife Bacall but truly more and better extras could have been added to this film masterpiece as well.<br /><br />Contentwise there is no disputing that this is one of the best films of all time however this DVD version is not befitting of such a great film and my recommendation is to wait for a much better restoration job to surface which is inevitable at least in the Blu-ray format very soon.</p></br><a href="../users/A1C58YXM2A30CY.html">A1C58YXM2A30CY</a><br/><p>You cannot go wrong with Casablanca!<br /><br /> The story is well-known:  The beginning of World War II, many immigrated to North Africa and points on the African coast, in advance of the German push into France.  From Casablanca, one could, with the right persuasion, hop to Lisbon (Portugal, of course) and from there, escape to America.<br /><br /> The film defies definition.  It's not a drama, yet there are dramatic scenes.  It is not truly a love story, yet there are elements of that.  It's not a statement about immigration, yet many wish to escape.<br /><br /> An escapee of a concentration camp and freedom fighter, Victor Laslo (Paul Henreid) finds his way into Casablanca, hoping to get a plane out and back to the USA and help the Americans (this part of the story was vague).  He brings with him his wife, Ilsa, played adoringly and smartly by Ingrid Bergman.<br /><br /> Ilsa walks into Rick's Cafe Americane and who does she see -- the guy who she had a fling with and dumped in Paris -- and Rick (Bogart) is not over it!<br /><br /> Intrigue:  Black marketeer and competitor, played devilishly by Sydney Greenstreet (Maltese Falcon), wants Rick's for himself.  He also wants what Rick has -- letters of passage to America, which he could sell for a handsome profit.<br /><br /> Rick is torn -- he does not want to get involved with the Nazis that have invaded his bar; he does not want to help Laslo, and most of all he wants to forget Ilsa -- and can't understand why she abandoned him in Paris -- he didn't know she was married -- oops!<br /><br /> Peter Lorre (also with The Maltese Falcon) plays a slimy gangster who bumped off a couple of German couriers and passes their letters of transit to Rick -- who keeps them for himself!<br /><br /> Many famous lines and music have come from this one film:  Play it Sam (no one ever said "Play it again Sam" as is rumored); "This could be the start of a beautiful friendship"; "Here's looking at you, kid;" and "We'll always have Paris."<br /><br /> The DVD set is great.  Not only is the gorgeous black & white cleaned up and theater quality, but the second disk has film critics and film historians in the commentary, including our pal Roger Ebert, who calls this the second greatest film he's ever watched (the first is Citizen Kane).<br /><br /> Lauren Bacall, Bogart's son, Ingrid Bergman's daughter, everyone has a say.  A thorough overview of Bogie's films up to his death in the Fifties is gone over.  The Bugs Bunny cartoon "Carrotblanca" is not to be missed.<br /><br /> See this film!</p></br><a href="../users/AEMZRE6QYVQBS.html">AEMZRE6QYVQBS</a><br/><p>My wife walked into the room this weekend as I was watching the last scenes of CASABLANCA. 'Isn't it amazing how it lasts ...?', she observed of the Bogey-Bergman film that had moved me so. Indeed.<br /><br />She grew up with movies and Hollywood. I did not. I'm just catching up with cultural slice of Americana. There's a reason why CASABLANCA routinely appears in the top ten on lists of the greatest films ever made. 'Amazing how it's lasted.<br /><br />Bogey is superb in his wit and cynicism. As a newcomer to his films, I can't discern whether this accrues to Bogart as actor or, alternatively, to Bogart as beneficiary of superb writers. One thing for sure, after this film I'll have opportunity to form an opinion on that. CASABLANCA will *not* be my last Bogey film.<br /><br />Bergman in soft focus nearly makes the cameraman tremble. In a day when a woman's beauty had to be portrayed by means other than having her remove her clothes, Bergman comes across as irresistible, compelling, a woman worthy of waiting at a train station when everyone except you knows she won't show. Perhaps even the kind of woman who could entice a man like Bogey's Rick to abandon his practiced and protective cynicism. A woman, even, worthing sticking his neck out for. Rick, it is observed more than once, sticks his neck out for no one. It is one of the film's ironic and pivotal lies, for in fact he does.<br /><br />The casting, as many reviewers have observed, is arguably perfect. There is not a slow movement in this film, remarkable in a motion picture with very little of what we would today call 'action'.<br /><br />CASABLANCA is one for the ages. It's astonishing, as the good woman might have said, how it lasts.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>I promise somebody I would watch this before the year end and I was fortunate enough to see this early this afternoon. I was quite surprised when I first watched Casablanca to find that I practically could already quote the last ten minutes. So much of this film is engrained into our cultural consciousness from the countless spoofs and references that have come since then. And for good reason.<br /><br />In World War II, Casablanca is the place where displaced refugees find themselves in. Getting out is the hard part. A cynical American, Rick (Humphrey Bogart) runs the most popular gin joint there. Things are going good for him as he deigns to keep out of business that doesn't concern him. That all changes when a French underground leader, Victor Lazslo (Paul Henreid), comes to town with his wife Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman). It seems that Rick and Ilsa have a past together, and with the Nazis looking for some transit papers Rick happens to have and also trying to detain Victor, Rick finds himself in a tough spot.<br /><br />After watching this I realized that's there's nothing staggeringly original or innovative about this film. It's how human the characters and the plights they find themselves in are, and the dry humor they throw out in the process. The conflict inside Rick whether to look after his best interests or help the woman he still loves is certainly compelling stuff, but that isn't all. There are so many memorable characters, from the ingratiating Captain Renault (played with relish by Claude Reins) to the weasely Ugarte (Peter Lorre). While the story isn't so much about Casablanca, a little bit of everything is worked in. Not the least of which being the sticky politics and smoldering national pride for Nazi occupied France. The romance is also ... well, the reason why this movie is so timeless. And then there's the script. Though there are numerous lines that are justifiably classic, the rest is a rare work of brilliance as well. The dark humor, the slow eroding of Rick's resolve, all result in classic scenes, one after another. It has it all.<br /><br />Bogart and Bergman, a rare pairing that results in one of cinema's greatest romances. What more is there to say? They take what could have been completely conventional roles and make them truly human. A great supporting cast rounds out the crowd; there are more than just two memorable performances given. This was a film done in the old Hollywood studio system by all the rules, yet it inexplicably raises itself above and beyond that. It is a remarkable motion picture masterpiece. If you haven't seen it yet, I whole-heartedly recommend it.</p></br><a href="../users/A37S3ACL57LN62.html">A37S3ACL57LN62</a><br/><p>The first time I saw Casablanca, I didn't understand why everyone loved it. I tend to look at the relationship aspect of films, and in my eyes, the romance between Rick (Humphrey Bogart) and Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) was lacking. On the set, no one knew whether Ilsa was supposed to truly love Rick or not which caused Bergman to play the part ambiguously.<br /><br />However, I finally realized that the relationship was strong because of Rick's love for Ilsa. It didn't depend on mutual affection at all. With this revelation, I was able to see the film for what it was: a masterpiece.<br /><br />Rick own's Rick's Cafe, a seedy bar in Casablanca during WWII. Casablanca is still free from Nazi control, though Nazi leaders swarm the streets. This makes it a place filled with refugees hoping to escape to America. Of these refugees is a leader against the Nazi's, Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid). He brings his wife to Rick's, the beautiful Ilsa. It throws Rick into a tailspin; the two have a lot of history and he's been brooding over her since she left him. From there, he begins to act rather uncharacteristically.<br /><br />No one can deny the cleverness of the script; AFI recognized many of the lines in it's 100 Years 100 Quotes... list. Also recognized in an AFI list is the theme song "As Time Goes By." Thanks to Casablanca, it has become a standard. This is no surprise because it is a beautiful song, and Dooley Wilson's vocals make it very charming. Max Steiner's score is wonderful as well.<br /><br />Overall, this film has a little bit of everything, but blends each seemlessly. There is history, intruige, romance, great dialogue, and excellent music. If that were not enough, on this edition of the VHS is a 20 minute documentary about the making of the film narrated by Bogart's wife Lauren Bacall.</p></br><a href="../users/A1BE1OKY80FUBH.html">A1BE1OKY80FUBH</a><br/><p>I would vote this movie to be amongst the ten best ever- plot, acting, directing, ambiance- it is all there.<br /><br />They do not make them like this one any more</p></br><a href="../users/AGZVS6M8XJGN6.html">AGZVS6M8XJGN6</a><br/><p>Michael Curtiz's "Casablanca" opens on maps while a narrator gives a detailed exposition of the many twists and turns of Casablanca in the French Morocco, as a refugee route from wartime Europe...<br /><br />The Nazi envoy, Major Heinrich Strasser puts it: 'Human life is cheap in Casablanca." Of course because a man may be executed in its crowded market before Marshal P&eacute;tain's portrait or where a charming girl may guarantee an exit visa by spending her night with the Prefect of Police...<br /><br />Rick's Caf&eacute; is the point of intersection, the espionage center, the background for Allied offensive, the focal point as refugees from Nazi-occupied Europe seek to gain exit visas to Lisboa... It is a remarkable place full of adventurers, international traders, informers, spies, opportunist Vichy Police, German officers, all rounded out by a superb black singer-pianist Dooley Wilson, the excellent Sam, Rick's only trusted friend...<br /><br />The interesting club so well organized, leads to an open arena of conspiracy, counterspies, secret plans, black market transactions, in which the games and fights are between arrogant Nazis, patriotic French, idealists, murderers, pickpockets and gamblers around a roulette wheel, where a ball could rest on Rick's command against the settled number 22...<br /><br />"Casablanca" is an adventure film which victory is not won with cannons and guns... The action, the fight, the war takes place inside Rick's walls rather than outside...<br /><br />But who is this Rick? What is his magical power? His secret weapon? Rick is the anti-fascist with hard feelings, the former soldier of fortune who has grown tired of smuggling and fighting, and is now content to sit out the war in his own neutral territory... Even loyalty to a friend doesn't move him as he refuses to help Ugarte, a desperately frightened little courier who is fleeing from the police...<br /><br />Emphatically, Rick says, "I stick my neck out for nobody." But we know he will do just that in a very short time, for into his quiet life comes a haunting vision from his past, the beautiful woman he still loves and bitterly remembers... She is married to an underground leader and she desperately needs those papers Rick conveniently now has in his possession... The cynical Rick's facade of neutrality begins to weaken as he recalls the bittersweet memories of his past love affair, memories triggered repeatedly when the strains of "As Time Goes By" come from Sam, his piano-playing confidante...<br /><br />But "Casablanca" basic message is a declaration of self-sacrifice... War World II demanded all! The words stated by Rick at the airport had their impact: 'The problems of three people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world.' It goes without saying that Bogart is incomparable when he seems most like himself... His way with a line makes "Casablanca" dialog part of the collective memory: 'I remember every detail. The Germans wore gray. You were blue.'<br /><br />Intermixed in this intrigue are all the fascinating and beautifully acted supporting roles... With his customary skill, Claude Rains plays Major Renault, a prefect of police who is like Bogart in many ways... He, too, claims neutrality, but is definitely against the Nazis... He is Rick's most devoted adversary, tauntingly calling the man a "sentimentalist" and delivering his share of cynically amusing lines... When he makes a small bet and is encouraged to make a bigger one, he remarks that he is only a "poor corrupt official."<br /><br />Ingrid Bergman is fascinating as the lovely heroine, the mysterious impossible woman of an impossible love, the tender mood of every man, the love-affair, the quality of being romantic, the traditional woman enclosed by two rivals, symbol of a besieged Europe...<br /><br />Paul Henreid is Victor Laszlo, the anti-Nazi resistance leader, seeking in Morocco the two letters of transit signed by General De Gaulle...<br /><br />Sidney Greenstreet is the black marketeer on good terms with Rick, the rival owner of the 'Blue Parrot,' the acceptable face of corruption...<br /><br />Peter Lorre is Ugarte, the racketeer, the dealer of anything illegal, the killer, driven into a corner by the Vichy police, who has given Rick two letter of transit...<br /><br />Conrad Veidt is the very essence of German rigidity, unfeeling, unconcerned about life, but firmly believing in the foolish ideology of his Nazi compatriots...<br /><br />"Casablanca" covers many highlights: The Marseillaise against the Horst Wessel song inspiring sequence; the blissful days in Paris; Ilsa's emotional words to Rick in occupied Paris; the champagne toast; Ilsa's request to Sam; the poetry of the magic words and the beautiful voice of Dooley Wilson; Captain Renault's words in the airport; and the farewell...<br /><br />The magic that developed from the teaming of Bogart and Bergman is enough to make a new romantic figure out of the former tough guy... To his cynicism, his own code of ethics, his hatred of the phoniness in all human behavior, he now added the softening traits of tenderness and compassion and a feeling of heroic commitment to a cause... They helped him complete the portrayal of the ideal man who all men wished to rival...<br /><br />One can look at hundreds of films produced during this period without finding any whose composite pieces fall so perfectly into place... Its photography is outstanding, the music score is inventive, the editing is concise and timed perfectly... Bogart's and Bergman's love scenes create a genuinely romantic aura, capturing a sensitivity between the two stars one would not have believed possible...<br /><br />"Casablanca" is a masterpiece of entertainment, an outstanding motion picture which brought Bogart his first Academy Award nomination (he lost to Paul Lukas for "Watch On the Rhine") and won Awards for Best Picture of the Year, Best Director and Best Screenplay...</p></br><a href="../users/APZ9MBMUKD2W.html">APZ9MBMUKD2W</a><br/><p>A film for all time!

Anyone who loves film should realy think about getting this DVD for their collection.</p></br><a href="../users/AY69ZK7G6CNYJ.html">AY69ZK7G6CNYJ</a><br/><p>One of the greatest, and certainly one of the most quoted, films in cinema history, Casablanca brings all the essential elements to the big screen - adventure, romance, intrigue, suspense, and of course, evil Nazi bad guys (if you doubt this last one as an essential element, then reference the success of the Indiana Jones films). With a director and cast second to none, Casablanca makes a strong case for consideration as the best movie ever made - cementing its status as a must-see film.<br /><br />The story begins in a place called Rick's, a popular watering hole in Vichey controlled Morocco on the outskirts of Nazi dominated Europe. An important travel hub, Casablanca plays host to innumerable colorful characters with any number of varying agendas. Arms dealers, spies, and revolutionaries walk side-by-side through streets littered with pickpockets. But at Rick's, everyone seems to enjoy themselves. Owner Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) seems content with his life of serving customers and making money until she walks in - Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman), the love of his life.<br /><br />A couple of years earlier, as the Nazis moved into Paris, Rick and Ilsa fell in love. But in the act of fleeing the Nazi advance, Ilsa sent Rick a note at the train station informing him that she could not go with him. She offered no explanation. Now, she was appearing in his establishment with her husband - fugitive and Nazi resistance leader Victor Laszlo.<br /><br />As the hours unfold, and the Nazis search for Laszlo in an attempt to cut off his escape, Rick learns the whole story. When he met Ilsa in Paris she was married to Laszlo, but she thought he was dead - a victim of the Nazi regime. But before she could flee Paris with Rick, she learned that her husband had escaped a Nazi concentration camp. She stayed behind to care for him.<br /><br />Needing help to aid her husband's escape to the United States, Ilsa appeals to Rick. It is clear that they still love each other. But will Rick use his influence and connections to help himself and Ilsa or Victor Laszlo? Will his idealism prevail over his hard pragmatism? The Third Reich is closing in on Victor Laszlo and only Rick can save him...<br /><br />The DVD Report</p></br><a href="../users/A2CW9IQAPFEYLM.html">A2CW9IQAPFEYLM</a><br/><p>Casablanca is simply the most enjoyable movie I've ever seen, bar none. The setting is Rick's Cafe in Casablanca at the beginning of WW II. Everyone here wants out of Casablanca, except Rick (Bogart), who has escaped here from Paris and the woman he's loved and who's jilted him. He is cynical, interested only in himself. Then one day Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman), his lost love, shows up, in the company of husband vc xVicor Laszlo (Paul Henreid), a great Resistance leader. They, too, want to escape to America, but the Nazis plan on stopping him. Through an accident Rick has the only means of getting them out: letters of transit that cannot be rescinded. It's Rick's conscience versus an old love wound; there is some doubt which will win (even when making the movie this doubt remained right up to the final days of shooting), and at what cost.<br /><br />Everything works perfectly in this movie--the cynicism, the idealism, the twists and turns toward the conclusion. Bogart is at his tough-guy-on-the-outside-softy-on-the-inside best; Bergman is lovely; Claude Rains as the police commissioner is witty and almost as cynical as Rick; Sidney Greenstreet is great in a minor role. This movie never fails, no matter how many times viewed. Wonderful!</p></br><a href="../users/A2GPN2VKS8E77C.html">A2GPN2VKS8E77C</a><br/><p>This cinematic masterpiece won 3 Academy Awards in 1943: Best Picture, Best Director and Best Screenplay. The acting as is timeless as the movie itself. Screen legends Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman make the perfect pair as star-crossed lovers Rick and Ilsa who meet again in war-torn unoccupied France. Paul Henreid is memorable as resistance fighter/leader Victor Laszlo. Claude Rains ("The Adventures Of Robin Hood", etc.) is a cross between neutral and non-neutral as Louis Renault, prefect of police. Peter Lorre is subtly devious as the scheming Ugarte. Sydney Greenstreet ("The Maltese Falcon", etc.) is an accessory as Rick's business rival Ferrari. Conrad Veidt oozes pure venom as the evil Major Strasser. The movie works very well, not only in terms of story, but the techniques that were used: flashbacks where almost all of it was music, close-ups of the characters in the right places, etc. Max Steiner (Oscar winner for "Gone With The Wind" four years earlier) composed the score for this bittersweet tale of love, intrigue and patriotism. The movie's only real special features are the original theatrical trailer, trailers for other classic movies starring Humphrey Bogart and a revealing documentary, "You Must Remember This" (the first line of "As Time Goes By", featured in the film), which offers an exclusive look at the making of this landmark movie, hosted by none other than Bogie's wife (from 1945, a year after they starred in "To Have And Have Not" until his untimely death in 1957) and legendary actress, Lauren Bacall. This movie also should've won Bogie the Oscar for Best Actor, Ms. Bergman Best Actress, Mr. Steiner Best Score and Best Song ("As Time Goes By"). One of the movie's final lines, "Round Up The Usual Suspects", was the inspiration for the mind-bending, Oscar-winning film "The Usual Suspects." (Look for my review of that twist-filled thriller later on). This film is, in the strictest sense of the word, a classic. Features the famous line "Here's looking at you, kid" and the timeless song "As Time Goes By." Rated PG for mild thematic elements and some violence.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HJB9J5O5CLPB.html">A2HJB9J5O5CLPB</a><br/><p>I watch this one once a year.  I can't help but notice recently that it is basically a propaganda film in behalf of the American war effort during WW2.  In less capable hands than the legendary Epstein brothers the script could have deteriorated into a jingoistic John Wayne, kill the Germans, flick.  Instead, it gives us some of the snappiest dialogue of American Cinema and the most romantic love story.<br /><br />Bogart's Rick is an American icon.  The tough guy with a broken heart bleeds whiskey.  Ingrid Bergman has hurt him.  She scoots when her husband Laslo, the resistance hero is found to be alive.  Rick retreats to a bistro in Casablanca, last stop for Europe's refuges.  Claude Rains plays the flip flopping Frenchy commandant.  Sidney Greenstreet, Peter Lorie, and a host of Hollywood character actors populate the back lot of Hollywood Morocco.  Every one of them gives the performance of their life.  It's almost like they knew this movie would be very special.<br /><br />Will Ingrid get on that plane with hero Laslo or a hero of love, Bogey?  This is a tough one for the women in the audience.  Convention says she should go with her husband.  He's a brave and kind man.  Or should she stay with capable, tough, unbelievably romantic Bogey?<br /><br />Round up the usual suspects and play it again, Sam.</p></br><a href="../users/AYQF4Z1EQDACU.html">AYQF4Z1EQDACU</a><br/><p>One of the Greatest masterpieces in the history of cinema, unforgetable,legendary,classic.

The performances are flawless. Curtiz's direction is flawless. The story is great. Max Steiner's score is great. There is almost nothing bad that can be said about this film. And most of the world will agree that this movie belongs in the top five films ever made. <p>That being said, why isn't there a special edition dvd? This contains a documentary 'You Must Remember This' hosted by Lauren Bacall. But why isn't there a dvd like Citizen Kane's Special editions, with all kinds of documentaries, featurettes, essays, and commentary by film historians? A definite hindsite by Warne Brothers. One I hope they rectify.</p></br><a href="../users/AY46DEOJJYFTW.html">AY46DEOJJYFTW</a><br/><p>In my humble opinion this is the best film ever. Stellar acting and incomparable chemistry between Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman. Paul Henreid exudes class and bravery. The incomparable Claude Rains. A witty screenplay, taut direction and an emotinal core that builds throughout the film right up to the most memorable ending of all-time. Play it again, and again and again.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AUECYM0M0YSX.html">A3AUECYM0M0YSX</a><br/><p>Just as "Gone With The Wind" raised the costume drama to new heights, "Casablanca" defined the Hollywood romance, with a touch of film noir thrown in.  What's remarkable is that all the contributors to this film did solid work before and after this, but for some reason they only gelled like this once, here.  Or, as Rick might say, "All the productions of all the movies for all the studios in the world, and they walked into this one."  Casablanca has become more than a movie.  It's an icon for 1940s Hollywood.  Or rather, it's full of icons: the trenchcoats, the fedoras, the fog and cigarette smoke, the starry-eyed closeups in half-shadow, the exotic locals and transport planes that whisk our heroes to safety.  Many films since have tried to duplicate the mood of this movie, but none has really succeeded quite the same way.<br /><br />Somehow the role was perfect for Bogart: famous for playing gangsters (he once said he worked his way up from third gangster to second gangster to first gangster), here is is playing a character who is in even more danger, and I think that's largely reponsible for the film's success.  For as a gangster the danger was self-evident; here, as a cafe owner, Bogie had to juggle corrupt police chiefs, cheating gamblers, angry Nazis and fleeing refugees, all while remaining calm, keeping his business open, and, as he so famously puts it, sticking his neck out for no one.  It's not an easy task, but Bogart's Rick makes it look easy; that's the key to his charm and allure.  There's much pleasantness on the surface in Rick's cafe, but there's always intrigue boiling just underneath.  It probably mirrored how a lot of Americans felt during the time.<br /><br />Ingrid Bergman is...well, I hate to use the cliche, but she *is* luminous.  She manages to suggest so much with a glance, a shrug, and both she and Bogart have long pasts that are wisely not dealt with in detail.  (Thirty years later, the creators of "Chinatown" did a similar wise thing with the J.J. Gittes and Evelyn Mulwray characters, leaving much of their past as pieces in a puzzle.)  We can fill in the blanks, which just makes the characters more alluring and appealing.<br /><br />The supporting cast hits all the right notes, with special kudos to Claude Rains for what might be the best acting job in the film.  (Ebert says this in his commentary, and I agree.)  I'm constinually struck by how short Peter Lorre's part is.  I find his lack of screen time a little unbalanced, frankly.<br /><br />Some people call Casablanca the "perfect" movie, whatever that means.  That's a sentimental pronouncement--the film has its share of flaws.  There are some ridiculous plot holes--why would Nazis who put Victor Laszlo in a concentration camp allow him to roam freely in Casablanca once he escaped?; why would letters of transit--mere pieces of paper--stop Nazis from allowing wanted people to flee?  Ebert says we shouldn't dwell on these questions, and maybe we shouldn't, but the fact remains that the whole situation is improbable in the extreme.  The virtuals of the film are such that we don't worry too much about these details however: we just enjoy being invited into Rick's Cafe, and as long as we are in its cozy and fascinating interiors we will forgive certain transgressions of logic.  And the ending is about self-sacrafice in a way that will be lost on much of the younger generation, who oftentimes just see it as a sappy love story.<br /><br />This DVD release is excellent, with a superb print (hardly a nick or speck of dust), bountiful supplements and interesting commentaries.  Ebert's enthusiasm for the film bubbles over, and he dispells many of the myths that have cropped up regarding Casablanca over the years.  The documentary on Bogart's life and career is interesting, especially when the films he produced with his own company are discussed--many of these should be more highly regarded than they are.  People today remember Bogie as the great commercial Hollywood icon, but few realize he was also one of the first "indie" producers, and just like many of today's independent filmmakers he tasted frustration as less-commercial projects floundered.  An interesting bit of trivia: he developed and starred in a now relatively-obscure film about a mobile army surgical hospital in Korea in the early 1950s.  The title he wanted for this film--a title vetoed by the studio because it was too odd and obscure-- was MASH.<br /><br />The Warner Brother's cartoon, "Carrotblanca," is the lowpoint of the extras.  Warner Bros. made thousands of inspired cartoons during its heyday, but this isn't one of them.  On the whole, though, this DVD set has enough extras to satiate even the biggest Casablanca fan or Bogart buff.  Buy this release: it will be the beginning of a beautiful friendship.</p></br><a href="../users/A36EW68H08UOCS.html">A36EW68H08UOCS</a><br/><p>For those who attention spans are are too short or who think of the Matrix as &quot;Deep&quot; - I recommend &quot;Casablanca&quot; - the perfect movie.  Star-crossed lovers have never been more heartbreakingly portrayed than Bogart and Bergman.  The supporting cast and the script are perfect.  The photography is transferred with museum-quality perfection to this DVD.  The movie as it currently exists is so perfect - it is almost inconceivable to consider that up to the end of shooting they toyed with a different ending.  &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; may have a reputation of being called &quot;The Greatest Movie&quot; more often than &quot;Casablanca&quot;, and it is technically brilliant - but the characters of Casablanca visit my dreams often and vividly, and I never dream of Charles Foster Kane and his screen partners.<p>Bogart is perfectly tough and tender-hearted.  Ingrid Bergman is perfectly beautiful and torn between her noble husband and the man she loved earlier in Paris. <p>This movie is, in short - perfect.  I'll not give another film a higher recommendation unless something higher comes along.  To date the film that is superior to Casablanca does not exist.</p></br><a href="../users/A243HY69GIAHFI.html">A243HY69GIAHFI</a><br/><p>For me, the intriguing story of _Casablanca_ is not the story of Rick and Ilsa trapped between the reality of their present and the memory of their past.  <p>No, the truly interesting  story of _Casablanca_ is that which is  revealed in the DVD's supplementary documentary, _You Must Remember This_.  The creation of this true work of art in an environment dedicated to the  mass production of films gives hope to every artist who's had to perform  commercially.  Indeed, one almost comes away from a behind-the-scenes  exploration of _Casablanca_ with an actual appreciation of the way in which  deadlines and pressure can help the artist make a better product.  <p>_You  Must Remember This_ is thus useful for its display of  the whole  &quot;studio system&quot; era in Hollywood.  It gives a good glimpse into  that time and could serve as a useful jumping-off point to anyone seriously  studying the subject.<p>Likewise, the way in which the film's producers and  director led the project is a fascinating exploration of management  science.  The film became legendary, I think, because the people at the top  allowed great flexibility for those they led, and weren't afraid to play  around with ideas offered even on the studio floor.  I think MBA candidates  would do well to look at the way this film was put together for  enlightenment.<p>Still, I can't resist talking about the film itself.  For  me _Casablanca_ is the legend I return to in my own mind whenever there are  romantic crises in my life.  I think that part of the reason that this  movie has survived is because it offers a unique perspective on romantic  disappointment.  Instead of concluding with scorn or hatred of partners  who've left one hanging, it says that people can have noble reasons for  causing pain.  It also says that ultimately pain is eased when one achieves  understanding of the other person.  I'm not sure that any major American  film gives such a positive spin to heartbreak as this one.  <p>It's  thus not at all hard for me to recommend the DVD version of this product,  for the excellent  supplementary documentary alone, and the movie itself,  for the surprising values it discovers in the heart of a morally ambiguous  Morocco.</p></br><a href="../users/A1BJOEQSRX2IBM.html">A1BJOEQSRX2IBM</a><br/><p>This movie is absolute perfection. Humphrey Bogart (my favorite actor) and Ingrid Bergman make screen magic in this movie, Claude Rains is also superb. Filled with lots of now famous cliches; 'Here's looking at you  kid', 'This is the beginning of a beautiful friendship', 'We'll always have  Paris', 'Play it Sam, play As Time Goes By', etc. This is THE Hollywood  movie, probably the greatest screenplay ever written, filled with memorable  dialogue. Easily one of the greatest movies of all time, a MUST SEE. From a  scale of 1-10 I give this movie a 10!</p></br><a href="../users/A27H9DOUGY9FOS.html">A27H9DOUGY9FOS</a><br/><p>One of the greatest movies ever and an enduring American classic is back for another DVD go-around!  Say it isn't so.  In 2003, I snapped up the impressive 2-Disc Special Edition DVD.  In 2008, I couldn't resist going Blu-ray with the comprehensive Ultimate Collector's Edition.  I didn't think that a few years later, Warner would be trumpeting an even more advanced collection.  How many times are we expected to dip into the same well?  I mean, I know it's "Casablanca" but when is enough actually enough?  And to use their own terminology, when does ultimate really mean ultimate?  I'm not going to synopsize the film or offer a traditional review, I suspect if you're shopping this pricey new version that you are well aware of the merits of the film itself.  Instead, I will highlight what is included.  Is it worth the upgrade?  That's an individual answer, to be sure, but if you are an enthusiast who owns the Ultimate Collection or a casual viewer that already has the Blu-ray edition--the conclusion might indeed be "no."  If, however, you have yet to go Blu on this title or are a compulsive completist/collector--now may be as good a time as any to pony up the bucks for this limited edition set.<br /><br />Contents:  This box set will be a Blu-ray/DVD combo pack with 3 discs, the third disc being dedicated to three feature length documentaries.  It is a numbered Limited Edition, only 50,000 will be made available.  The double wide display box contains several new collectibles including a 62 page production art book (with never before seen photos, communications, and archived documents about the film), a full size reproduction of the 1942 movie poster, and four drink coasters.  I love this silly collectible stuff, but what is it with coasters in these deluxe sets?<br /><br />Transfer:  Both the DVD and Blu-ray are boasting new 2012 4K transfers.  Arguably, this is the one aspect that might make me seriously recommend an upgrade.  For my money, though, the previous Blu-ray release is extremely satisfying and competent.  It is NOT a transfer that was begging for a polish.<br /><br />NEW Special Features: 2 Documentaries (about 45 minutes of content total):<br />1) Casablanca: An Unlikely Classic<br />2) Michael Curtiz: The Greatest Director You Never Heard Of<br /><br />Feature Length Documentaries On Third Disc (all previously released):<br />1) You Must Remember This: The Warner Bros.

Watching this classic in 1080p is truly an experience, and I have to praise Warner for providing us with the absolutely best possible transfer this film has ever seen.  There's not a trace of grain or flicker or anything you'd expect from a film this old, and the result is stunning.  If you've seen the movie before, it's time to relive with this remarkable new technology.  If you've somehow missed it on TCM, get cultured and experience one of the greatest films in our history in a way no generation has ever been able to do.  Blu Ray.  It not only improves the viewing experience, but it invites the viewer right into the moment.  With clarity as perfect as this, you forget you're even watching a film and instead feel as though you've tapped into the memories of the characters portrayed.<br /><br />I don't feel the need to mention the movie's plot, as most I'm guessing have either already seen it before or can find that out elsewhere, so I want to end this review with what you are probably most wondering about anyway.  Is the Blu Ray transfer worth buying this for?  If I haven't made it clear enough already, YES.  I've seen some poor Blu Rays transfers, but this is not one of them.  In fact, I'd go so far as to say it's one of the best I've seen.  The extras, though I haven't experienced them yet, look interesting, including an audio commentary by movie critic Roger Ebert.  All in all I'd say that this release is definitely worth getting even if Casablanca isn't your favorite movie of all time.  It is a classic, and it is an experience, and with Blu Ray it's better than ever before.</p></br><a href="../users/A1K94LXX833JTT.html">A1K94LXX833JTT</a><br/><p>Possibly the most popular film around, 1942's Casablanca pairs two iconic actors, Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman, in a story of lost love and reluctant heroism.  Warner Brothers put out an excellent <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009W0WM">2-disc Special Edition</a> in 2003.  (That older set is going to receive new artwork on December 2nd, but it will otherwise be the same.)  This new 3-disc Ultimate Collector's Edition includes the 2003 set and adds a documentary about studio head Jack Warner, along with a bunch of memorabilia.  Here are the announced new features, the ones not included in the 2003 set.  All but the first are memorabilia.<br /><br />-- Jack L. Warner: The Last Mogul, a 1993 full-length biographical documentary (104 minutes)<br />-- 48-page photo book<br />-- 10 roughly 5x7" cards with color reproductions of poster art and such<br />-- 3 reproductions of archival correspondence (a memo from producer Hal Wallis changing the title to Casablanca, a memo from Wallis to studio head Jack Warner urging the casting of Bogart over George Raft, and a letter from the publicity head instructing the publicist to shift Bogart's image from tough to romantic lead)<br />-- reproduction of Victor Laszlo's letter of transit<br />-- passport holder with Casablanca logo<br />-- luggage tag with Casablanca logo<br />-- mail-in offer for 27x40" movie poster<br />-- all in a pretty collector's box with an intricate laser-cut Moroccan design<br /><br />The documentary, which comprises the third disc, is also available separately (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000COF1QW">here</a>).  It was written, directed and produced by a grandson of Warner, and is said (by Variety) to be somewhat sentimental but not to overlook Warner's defects.  It isn't about Casablanca in particular.<br /><br />There are more than enough extras in the 2-disc edition for most people.  I'll list them below.  The video and sound quality of that set are very good, and they should be the same in this new edition.<br /><br />The movie is set in 1941 Casablanca, Morocco, controlled by the Nazi-collaborating Vichy French government.  Bogart plays Rick, a nightclub owner with a past he doesn't talk about and a determination not to get caught up in current events.  "I stick my neck out for nobody," he says.  He comes into possession of two letters of transit, invaluable items to the many refugees seeking passage out of the grasp of the Nazis.  The intended recipients of the letters soon show up, resistance leader Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid) and his wife Ilsa (Bergman).  Ilsa, it turns out, was once Rick's lover, who broke his heart when she left him with no explanation.  Their old flame is rekindled despite themselves, and Rick must decide whether to help his rival for her love, thereby helping the war effort he has claimed no interest in, or help himself.<br /><br />No one expected this movie to be such a classic, and even though it won three major Academy Awards, including Best Picture, it only gained its place as a classic gradually over the years.  Undoubtedly the two stars are a big part of the reason it grew on us.  Bogart is perfect as a cynic who has more heart than he lets on.  Just by being there, Bergman instantly conveys every reason we need to understand Rick's broken heart and feel the force of his dilemma, and she convincingly portrays her own conflict between two loves.  Somehow the movie also gets other things just so.  Several of the supporting actors manage to be morally corrupt and still likable; others are just likable.  The writing, a fair amount of it done quickly, by committee, with no thought of it being great writing, has panache, and hits on several turns of phrase that just work.  All of these things lift up the story of love, higher duty, and the triumph of good over evil, and over cynicism.<br /><br />Here's the list of the features included from the 2003 Special Edition:<br /><br />-- Introduction by Bogart's wife and frequent co-star Lauren Bacall (2 minutes)<br />-- Audio commentaries<br />. . . . . by Roger Ebert<br />. . . . . by film historian/author Rudy Behlmer<br />-- Documentaries and featurette<br />. . . . .

It's a great one, not to be missed.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LEV4H5ZQ55J2.html">A1LEV4H5ZQ55J2</a><br/><p>Perfect audio and video as clear as a crisp on this two disc set.<br /><br />Casablanca is that 1943 wartime favorite love story, with a most unforgettable cast.<br /><br />Humphrey Bogart plays the proprietor of Rick's American Club, a nightclub centered in the intrigue and action of German occupied French Morocco. The French have just capitulated to the Germans and established the Vichy government, a puppet pro-German government, but not all French authorities in Casablanca are in agreement. Claude Rains plays the chief of police and shrewdly entertains the German occupiers, as he continues taking care of number one.<br /><br />Paul Henreid plays a French resistance leader running for his life and hopeful of obtaining exit visas in Casablanca for he and his wife (Ingrid Bergman). But they are not the only ones. Many of the emigres are in desperate need of more money to buy a seat to Lisbon and from there America. The turnover of desperate souls all meet, dine, and gamble at Rick's where they convey the challenge of not knowing how to get out.<br /><br />Casablanca is a love story about nationalism and of people. Rick is introduced as a hard boiled businessman without patriotism or caring. His fellow nightclub owner (of the Blue Parrot) is played by Sydney Greenstreet, also an unscrupulous dealer. And to make the trio complete Peter Lorre plays a daredevil murderer who recently killed two German soldiers to get hold of the diplomatic pouch that contained two blank exit visas.<br /><br />The second disc contains the usual features one might expect; "a tribute to Casablanca", "Bacall on Bogart" - a candid discussion from Lauren Bacall on the life and career of her husband, Humphrey Bogart, and newly discovered deleted scenes and outtakes.<br /><br />All in all, this set is the way to go. The quality of the black and white footage is sharp, the sound unbroken. I already had a DVD of Casablanca but was not satisfied with the video. After viewing this set I threw the other away.<br /><br />Have a look see.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LU79BYMWZEW9.html">A3LU79BYMWZEW9</a><br/><p>In the various special features included in this package, you'll hear the assertion (over and over again) that one of the reasons for CASABLANCA's greatness is that the actors themselves (as well as director Michael Curtiz) were filming pretty much on the fly, with no idea what tomorrow's shoot would entail or how the darn thing was going to end.  Makes sense, I suppose.  If the actors were as tentative and uncertain about the outcome as the characters they portrayed, it could only add to the authenticity, right?<br /><br />Well, of course, and I don't doubt the veracity of this story really, but when you think about it, COULD this story really have ended any other way?  Could Rick and Ilsa really have suddenly announce to Victor Laszlo that THEIR (Riok and Ilsa's) personal desires really did "amount to more than a hill of beans in this crazy world."  Would they ever have been so selfish and crass as to add, "So you just board the plane, Vic old boy and vamoose on out to Lisbon.  After all, you've got your work, your cursed integrity and principles, and you sing a mean version of "The Marseillaise," so take some satisfaction in your mission and leave us lovebirds alone.  We've always had Paris, and now we'll have Casablanca too." In 1942? Not bloody likely.<br /><br />That point aside,  film scholars and critics have every reason to hail CASABLANCA as one of the all-time greats.  It does what the best movies always have done: tells a great story with wit, sophistication, a sense of intrigue, an expression nobility--and doesn't stint on the romance.  It's got it all, and even better, it's totally unpretentious.  Whether or not Bogart and Bergman knew where the story was headed, it's almost certainly true that they did not know how good a movie they were making.  Maybe Curtiz did: he was framing all those gorgeous shots after all, but I believe Bergman's film critic daughter Pia Lindstrom when she says her mother was absolutely baffled by fans' comments for years afterward that they just loved her CASABLANCA.  Though Bergman was never anything less than professional, it's reported that throughout the shooting, the actress was obsessing about her next big part in the more "literary" (and therefore more prestigious) FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS.  She never anticipated that Ilsa in CASABLANCA would become her signature role.<br /><br />And it's certainly one of Bogart's greatest too.  As the special feature on Bogie indicates, he was an actor thoroughly dedicated to his profession, and while his range may have been limited (or his casting options "typed") by this point in his career, audiences knew that he was much more than just a screen tough guy.  His Rick Blaine is indeed evert bit the romantic and the idealist that the cheerfully corrupt police captain Louis Renault (Claude Rains) accuses him of being.  We scarcely need Renault to tell us that, however.  If ever there was a sensitive sould hiding under a mask of worldly cynicism it's got to be Rick--and if there was ever an actor capable of embodying those elements (and all the shades in between) it was Bogart.<br /><br />It's also interesting how much commentary there is in the features about how much an ensemble player Bogart really was.  It's hard to think of a more individualistic screen presence than Humphrey Bogart: yet it's also true that his best roles are in films with brilliant supporting players.  Aside from the aforementioned Bergman and Rains (who is perfect as the prefect),  there are great (co-)star turns by Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre (must have felt like old home week after MALTESE FALCON), Conrad Veidt and the solid, stolid Paul Henreid as Victor Lazlo.<br /><br />The qualified ending is happy enough...for wartime.  Everybody gets to feel good about themselves in the end, as even Renault finds he's capable of something like nobility after all.  About the only people who lose out in the end are bad guy Nazi Major Strasser (Veidt)--and oh yeah, those "USUAL SUSPECTS."</p></br><a href="../users/A3CN9CCJUNIPKT.html">A3CN9CCJUNIPKT</a><br/><p>I'm not a big "top ten" list-maker, but if pressed for an answer, I might have to say that "Casablanca" is my all-time favorite film... There are a lot of contenders -- "Seven Samurai," perhaps -- but it's hard to beat the magic of this grand Hollywood war-noir classic, with its snappy dialog, gauzy black-and-white cinematography and delicious acting.  Plus, it's a great propaganda flick and historical timepiece. Yup, pretty much my favorite.  One downside: I miss the days when you'd see movies like this in the theater and actually have a communal cultural experience with other human beings.  Still, now that I have it on DVD, I looking forward to enjoying it for years to come. We'll always have Bogie and Bacall.

This is a place where everybody tends to gather and has the atmosphere of excitement and familiarity. Rick owns this cafe with its separate gaming quarters. Humphrey plays this character, he owns his space with wit and flat affect, which seems common in his acting. He has been duped in love and is reserved and withholds emotion towards people in general. He finds out that a man who is quite respected in speaking out against the Nazis is coming to his establishment. What surprises him is who this man brings with him. It is the old flame who he loved and crumbled his defenses with her elegance and style. This is played by Bergman, Ilsa. She is married to the famous speaker and writer and Rick is taken aback. They are trying to escape to America. The things I liked about this film are the plush feel to the Cafe and the black and white eloquence of how it was filmed. The bazaar and exciting culture glimpsed with the set of Morroco. The dialog which is known by many, Heres Looking at you Kid and Play it again Sam. The words and how they are said. Bergman reminds me of Nicole Kidman. She is so feminine and respectable to me. I like the way she talks and how she comes across on film. The ending is different than the norm and you wonder if Ilsa was acting somewhat with Rick to save her husband. It seems like it wasn't acting she just was so strong in not running back to Rick on the last scene of their parting. He doesn't reflect his pain on her departure which is too bad, I think his emotional self could have been displayed a little more in this ending shot of his leaving with the constable, even though his character is quite guarded with armor. I liked the drives that Rick and Ilsa took in France, their leisure and intimate togetherness in cafes. Roulette is fun. This is in his small casino. Champagne and caviar, which is eaten on toast points and luscious bubbly swilled. An elegant film all in all.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z.html">A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z</a><br/><p>NOTE: This is a pre-HiFi videotape that has only a linear audio track.<br /><br />When CASABLANCA was widely released to theaters in January 1943, its producers and Warner's had no inkling that this would become a cinematic immortal. (Events similar to what occurred with Fox's 1951 sci-fier, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JKFR">THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL</a>.)<br /><br />In the seven decades since a never mounted stageplay called "Everybody Comes to Rick's" was adapted for the screen by the Epstein twins and Howard Koch, CASABLANCA has spawned two short-lived TV series, but wisely on the part of filmmakers, no motion picture rehashes. Here we have an ideal cast following a perfect script; a timeless love story that ends happily for no one that's set in a North African stopping point for refugees of a merciless war. Their German oppressors are here as well in these final days before the Allied invasion of North Africa.<br /><br />Former gun runner Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) owns "Rick's Caf&eacute; Am&eacute;ricain", a place that folks of all political persuasions and nationalities gravitate to. His loyal friend and piano artist&eacute; Sam (Dooley Wilson) performs every song but one, that is until Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman) wanders in, spots him at the keys and coos, "Play 'As Time Goes By'." When Rick storms over to chastise Sam for the song he never wants to hear, he and Ilsa are reunited. We soon learn of their affair in Paris and sudden parting while Germans marched in, Rick's hard feelings at Ilsa's disappearance that day, and the love which yet remains within him.<br /><br />All this amid the chaos of other lives, people scrambling for impossible to get papers of transit even as an ever-present enemy heightens their awareness of danger. The Italian Ugarte (Peter Lorre) gives Rick two of these priceless letters just before he's arrested by Louis Renault (Claude Rains), a corrupt police captain. Ugarte dies in custody, leaving an embittered Rick with the dilemma of giving the transit docs to Ilsa and her husband, Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid), a Czech Resistance refugee, or saving them for his own escape. Lazlo selflessly suggests that Rick use the papers to escort Ilsa to safety while he remains in Casablanca. Then Laszlo is arrested by Renault on a false charge...<br /><br />CASABLANCA is the one film that all Classic Era movie fans should own, and the one to be seen repeatedly.

There is good reason for this, as you can cut the mystique surrounding it with a knife. It has one of the finest scripts, among other things. The story behind the writing of Casablanca is legendary. Without getting into the details, writers Julius and Philip Epstein, along with Howard Koc, would finish a scene and rush it over to the set in time to be shot; then they'd write the next one. No one knew how the story would end. As it turned out, it ended up one of the classiest and most iconic of all classic films.<br /><br />In Casablanca, isolated from war-torn Europe, political alliances and hatreds are bubbling, but no one can do anything about them, as it is a neutral country. In the midst of this hotbed, enigmatic Rick (Humphrey Bogart) owns the swankiest nightclub in town,  the Cafe Americane. It is a place to meet, drink and gamble, and to listen to Sam's piano playing; but it's also a place to plot how to obtain one of the rare exit visas to leave Casablanca and fly to the New World.<br /><br />One night, breathtakingly beautiful Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) and her stoic husband, Victor Laslo (Paul Henreid), show up in Rick's. Laslo is an international hero, fighting for the  resistance against the Third Reich. They have come to Casablanca because he is being hunted by the Nazis, and Casablanca is about the only place to catch a flight out of occupied Europe.<br /><br />Flashback: the story is a love triangle, but it is innocent enough. Rick and Ilsa were in love in pre-war, romantic Paris. The lovers made plans to leave Paris before the Germans marched in, but on the night they were supposed to leave, Ilsa's husband, whom she had thought was dead, resurfaced; so, she left Rick standing in the train station in the rain with no explanation.<br /><br />Now in Casablanca, Victor and Ilsa need exit visas like everyone else, but the Germans are determined not to let them leave. It is rumored that Rick has letters of transit, which are even better, stolen off two dead German couriers. But no one knows where Rick's loyalties lie. Ilsa uses her old relationship with Rick to try and get them - not so much for herself as for Victor. But Rick is still nursing his wounds from Paris.<br /><br />At the same time, Ilsa is torn between her old love for Rick and her continued love for Victor. Rick reveals that he is still in love with her; but makes a great show of not believing in causes or heroes. Is that really the way he is? Everything hinges on what Rick will do. Everyone thinks they know him, but no one is sure. As the tension mounts, his character is the key to everyone's future.<br /><br />Casablanca is full of interesting and wonderful characters, played by some of the best character actors at the time. Claude Rains is the debonair but corrupt prefect of police and Rick's friend, Captain Renault. Conrad Veidt plays the despicable Nazi Major Strasser. Sydney Greenstreet is his usual mercenary and rotund self as Rick's business competition, Signor Ferrari. Peter Lorre is the pitifully underhanded Ugarte. S.Z. (Cuddles) Sakall is the wonderfully sentimental waiter Carl. Madeleine LeBeau plays the singer Yvonne. Dooley Wilson is Rick's man and pianist, the memorable Sam. The list goes on and on.<br /><br />The ambiance of Casablanca, and of Rick's Cafe Americane in particular, is part of the wonder of the film. Warner Bros. created a world that, even though it was threatening and war-torn, continues to mesmerize audiences. We can't get enough of Rick's or the interesting characters who frequent it. As they say in the film, "Everyone comes to Rick's." We also can't seem to get enough of that classic 1940's style: the dinner jackets, the evening dresses - even the uniforms. The 40's were the apex of sartorial style.<br /><br />There are so many memorable quotes from Casablanca that you could almost reproduce the script en mass recalling them.<br /><br />Casablanca won three Oscars: Best Director (Michael Curtiz), Best Picture (Hal Wallis) and Best Screenplay (Julius Epstein, Philip Epstein and Howard Koch). It was also nominated for Best Actor (Bogart), Best Supporting Actor (Claude Rains), Best Cinematography (Arthur Edeson), Best Film Editing (Owen Marks) and Best Music Score (Max Steiner).<br /><br />Waitsel Smith</p></br><a href="../users/A10ODC971MDHV8.html">A10ODC971MDHV8</a><br/><p>No film has embedded itself more firmly in the collective imagination than this captivating, still-unparalleled romance adventure, which epitomizes everything that Hollywood filmmaking--at its very best--strives to be. Was there ever a more unlikely yet perfect pairing than the radiant Bergman and the world-weary Bogart? Portraying the twilight of civilized society in a foreign place, and the rising menace of new world evils, director Curtiz masterfully juggles tragedy and humor, intrigue and action to tell a timeless story rich in personal and political detail. And what an indelible, heart-catching finale!

Its themes of love and personal responsibility are timeless.  Its simple, straight-forward storyline has enthralled moviegoers for over half a century.<br /><br />In the French North Africa of 1942, Rick Blaine, a cynical Amercian expatriate with a shadowy past (played by Humphrey Bogart) runs the most popular bar in the City of Casablanca.  Casablanca's administrators are under the thumb of the Nazi regime that occupied France in 1940.  On the run from the Nazis come a resistance leader named Victor (played by Paul Hanreid) and his wife Ilsa (played by Ingrid Bergman).  Ilsa is Rick's ex-lover from Paris, just before the war.  The two fugitives seek safe passage to America, a passage they can only obtain from Rick Blaine.<br /><br />The world-weary Rick is disinclined to stick his neck out to assist the two fugitives, but Ilsa pays him a nocturnal visit to renew old acquintances.  She finds to her surprise that she still loves Rick and he her.  She abandons herself to his judgement with respect to her future with him and the fate of her husband.  Rick is left to choose between the love of his life and the fate of a resistance leader who may be crucial to the defeat of the Nazis, a defeat not yet visible in the dark days of 1942.  His dilemma is at the heart of this movie's enduring appeal, as Rick must balance love with personal responsibility for a larger fate.<br /><br />The movie is populated with an excellent and well-sketched cast of supporting players: a corrupt French Police Chief with a heart of gold who is Rick's best friend in Casablanca; Sam the Piano Player, who renders the classic song "As Time Goes by" to a grieving Rick Blaine; Peter Lorre as an unlucky pickpocket, and Sidney Greenstreet as a seedy deal-maker.<br /><br />Among the classic moments in the movie are Victor leading the patrons of Rick's Bar in drowning out a group of obnoxious Nazi officers with a rousing rendition of the French national anthem; Rick ordering "play it, Sam" when Sam is reluctant to play Ilsa's favorite tune; and the goodbye scene at the airport, where Rick makes his dramatic choice and must live with the consequences.<br /><br />This movie is most highly recommended to anyone with an interest in a truly classic, and entertaining, movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>This is a no-brainer.  The only thing debatable about this flick is it's placement in the pantheon of the greatest flicks of all-time.  Personally, as far as it's place in the Bogart canon, I rank "The Maltese Falcon" and "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre" above "Casablanca".  That's not to diminish the film but it just goes to show what an impressive body of work Bogart left behind.  There's more quotable dialogue here this side of Tarantino.  Snappy dialogue wouldn't work if you didn't have the right actors delivering it.  Aside from Bogart and Ingrid Bergman the supporting ensemble on hand here(Claude Rains, Paul Henreid, Sydney Greenstreet, et al.) seemed to have been plucked from heaven.  Essential is an understatement when describing "Casablanca".</p></br><a href="../users/ABO092BYA4VMU.html">ABO092BYA4VMU</a><br/><p>This movie is probably the greatest film achivement ever created by man,  and the romance between Bogart and Bergman will NEVER be matched.  A film this great can never be missed by anybody, and it is a truly powerful, moving, and beautiful film and it still remains so. There is not a false note in acting, story or characterization. This film won richly deserved Oscars for Best Picture, Director and Screenplay (but why didn' t Humphrey Bogart win Best Actor?)<br /><br />The DVD is enormous.

It is my favorite film of all time.  Everything about this film is wonderful.  The set, the drama, the acting, the music, and the cinamatography all whisk you away to another era.  The film has everything a moviegoer wants.  It has action, mystery, drama, romance, and at times it is even funny.  Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman were the only ones I think that could play these roles right.  They were a match made in heaven.  They are probably a better on screen couple than Vivian Leigh and Clark gable.  This is a timeless piece of film that everybody should see.</p></br><a href="../users/A3CFT5LHFCB46K.html">A3CFT5LHFCB46K</a><br/><p>A vast majority of filmgoers have acclaimed "Casablanca" as a classic. The small minority usually dislikes it for the black and white photography, the long since deceased stars, the lack of car chases and the characters bad habits (Drinking and smoking were very common in the 1940's). Many of the scenes in this film have also become so paroided that people have probably seen the spoof before they see the actual scene (Don't get this film's ending confused with the `alternate version' used on the "The Simpsons").  I do agree with the majority vote, but I do so for a reason as well. Here is a list on "What makes 'Casablanca' a classic". <p>Values. This film shows that there are causes worth fighting for and that are worth sacrificing for. You have to take a stand on what you know is right and wrong, even if it means giving up something valuable to you or giving up your life <p>Patriotism. Though not all of us think of "La Marseilles" as our national anthem, that scene in the movie reminded us that pride in one's country could be a most powerful weapon. If I were in the same room with Osama Bin Laden, I would torture him by singing "The Star Spangled Banner". <p>Characters. Many words have already been written about Humphrey Bogart as Rick Blaine and Ingrid Bergman as Ilsa Lund. What about Paul Heinreid as Victor Lazlo, Claude Rains as Captain Renault or Conrad Veidt as Major Strasser? What about Sydney Greenstreet as Senior Ferrari, Peter Lorre as Ugarte, Dooley Wilson as Sam and S.Z Sazkall as Carl? Each of these characters has an important part and-Along with the ones discussed in the next paragraph-only add to the film. <p>Authenticity. The actors and extras in this movie are able to create a convincing environment that resembles French Morocco, unlike some films at the time which made up white actors to unconvincingly look like foreigners. This can be attributed to the large number of refugees that fled to America at the time. Many of the people in this film went through the same experience of running away from their homelands as their characters in this film do, further adding depth to the film. Some people in the audience can also relate to the events and experience these persons go through, like running away from home and having to stay on your feet or watch your back every minute. <p>The screenwriters on this film (Julius and Philip Epstein and Howard Koch) were responsible for the great dialogue and scenes that are affecting, hilarious and dramatic, sometimes all at once. But it was the director (Michael Curtiz) and actors who avoided making them throwaway lines. For example, after Rick shoots Major Strasser, Captain Renault states "Major Strasser has been shot", than takes a glance at Rick as he decides what to do. Than he says "Round up the usual suspects" to the guards. The line would have still been good if he had said it immediately afterward, but it wouldn't have been so emphasized. <p>Another thought I had was in the feelings Rick and Ilsa have for one another. Though, when they were in Casablanca, they still had something for each other, the fire wasn't as intense as seen during the Paris flashback. It's also possible that Rick and Ilsa might have only slept together in Casablanca so Ilsa could get Rick to help her and Victor. Certainly a far cry from the way it was in Paris. If the film had ended with Ilsa leaving Victor for Rick, Ilsa would not only be in danger but she and Rick might not have been as happy with one another (Not to forget that the film would be regarded today as a message to leave your spouse for someone you had a one night stand with). <p>Finally, this movie is just so darn fun to watch. But while it works at straightforward value, many people have nevertheless come up with unusual interpretations. One has the film being a political allegory of the time, with Rick as FDR ('Casa Blanca' is Spanish for 'White House'). Another idea has the ending being a gay fantasy, with Rick dumping Ilsa to have an affair with another man, that being Captain Renault (Bogart does have more screentime with Rains and there is the line "Rick is the kind of man that, if I were a woman, I shall be in love with Rick"). The best thing that can be said about both theories is that they are creative. <p>No movie, in my opinion, is absolutely perfect. There is also no `Greatest movie of all time' in my view. <p>However, "Casablanca" does come close to being both. This film also achieves something that few movies do: It improves with age. Indeed, as time goes by, I will enjoy returning to Rick's more and more.</p></br><a href="../users/AHABFECTNE15I.html">AHABFECTNE15I</a><br/><p>Version: U.S.A / Region A, B, C<br />Aspect ratio: 1.37:1<br />VC-1 BD-25 / Advanced Profile 3<br />Running time: 1:42:34<br />Movie size: 15,49 GB<br />Disc size: 24,28 GB<br />Total bit rate: 20.15 Mbps<br />Average video bit rate: 17.92 Mbps<br /><br />Dolby Digital Audio  English  192 kbps  1.0 / 48 kHz / 192 kbps<br />Dolby Digital Audio  English  192 kbps  1.0 / 48 kHz / 192 kbps<br />Dolby Digital Audio  English  192 kbps  1.0 / 48 kHz / 192 kbps<br />Dolby Digital Audio  French  192 kbps  1.0 / 48 kHz / 192 kbps<br />Dolby Digital Audio  Spanish  192 kbps  1.0 / 48 kHz / 192 kbps<br /><br />Subtitles: English SDH / French / Spanish<br />Number of chapters: 32<br /><br />Disc 1<br />******<br /><br />Introduction<br />Audio Commentaries<br />Documentary: Bacall on Bogart (SD - 90 minutes)<br />TV Special: A Tribute to Casablanca (SD - 30 minutes)<br />Featurette: The Children Remember (SD - 12 minutes)<br />Deleted Scenes (SD - 12 minutes)<br />TV Excerpt (18 minutes)<br />Audio Archive<br />Production Research Gallery (SD)<br />Theatrical Trailers (SD)<br />Collectible Packaging<br /><br />Disc 2 - DVD Single layer disc<br />******<br /><br />Documentary: Jack L.

Staring Humphrey Bogart,<br />Ingrid Bergman and Paul Heinreid, it was originally just another one<br />of the more than 50 films turned out each year by each of the major<br />studios that dominated Hollywood in those days.  It's release<br />coincidentally coincided with the Nazi occupation of France, and its<br />theme and its timeless love story caught the public's<br />imagination.<p>Casablanca in French Morocco is under French rule and<br />one of the places in the world where refuges can get safe passage<br />visas to go on to Lisbon and eventually to America and freedom.  It is<br />seething with intrigue and corruption.  Humphrey Bogart is an<br />ex-patriot American citizen who runs Rick's Cafe, where much of the<br />commerce takes place.  Peter Lorre is a smuggler, Sidney Greenstreet<br />is a black marketeer, and Martin Dooley is the piano player known as<br />Sam.<p>When, one evening Ingrid Bergman comes in to the cafe on the<br />arm of her husband, Paul Heinreid, and asks the piano player to<br />&quot;play it Sam&quot;, he reluctantly plays &quot;As Time Goes<br />By.&quot; This melody which is played throughout the movie, is the<br />glue that defines the romance.  There's electricity between the<br />lovers.  There's intrigue and double dealing.  Something exciting<br />happens in each scene.  And the acting is so good that it brought me<br />right into Casablanca.  The story is always clear.  The danger is<br />always there.  The tension sizzles.<p>One particularly meaningful<br />scene was when some Nazi soldiers gather round the piano and sing an<br />ominous song to the &quot;Fatherland&quot;.  It makes everyone in the<br />Rick's cafe very uncomfortable.  That's when Paul Heinried instructs<br />the orchestra to play the French national anthem, the<br />&quot;Marseilles&quot;. Everyone starts to sing.  The Nazis are<br />silenced.  The music takes over.  I found my eyes filled with<br />tears.<p>The video I rented included a &quot;made for TV program&quot;<br />that featured interviews with some of the original writers and<br />recollections from people working on the set at the time.  There was<br />an interview with the man who did the music. He said that when he<br />wrote that into the script he actually felt tears running down his<br />face.  It was the same powerful emotion that I felt too.<p>The movie<br />was shot in black and white.  It was also shot in a studio in<br />Hollywood.  The airplane scene used a cardboard cutout of a plane and<br />hired midgets dressed as mechanics.  Shot from a distance and through<br />a fog it was realistic and served the same kind of purpose of<br />today's video imaging and special effects.<p>Of course all the<br />principals are dead, but their celluloid images in a timeless classic<br />film lingers on.</p></br><a href="../users/A81P47EIXM8HA.html">A81P47EIXM8HA</a><br/><p>Reviews on Amazon.com can be confusing as they lump reviews for the same movie on every format and version so you have folks complaining about quality next to those doing leaps for joy!  To be clear I just picked up the new Ultimate 70th anniversary box set ahead of release date...and the review that follows is for this edition to help others like myself who may have one or all of the previous editions decide if in this economic crunch dipping into the wallet again is worth it. I rushed to write this figuring at $44 on Amazon.com the price is low now and I'm trying to help those "on the fence" as it were.<br /><br />The movie itself needs no review... its in most peoples top 10 list of all time classics and the volumes of extra features and commentaries are for the most part re-purposed from earlier releases (and spelled out elsewhere so I will not be redundant in listing them) but that isn't always the case with re-issues and I know as I have many duplicate movies because a newer version doesn't contain the featurette or commentary from an inferior previous edition print quality wise... so Kudos to WB for making all previous editions expendable from that standpoint...<br /><br />so... WHAT is different, and is it worth your money?<br />the two featurettes that ARE new ..I appreciate a lot. Michael Curtiz is without a doubt one of the greatest directors ever with an early run of classics with Errol Flynn (Captain Blood, The Sea Hawk, Robin Hood, The Charge of the light Brigade and more) to Casablanca, Yankee Doodle Dandy , Mildred Pierce and even White Christmas just for starters in his resume and it great to have something on him finally. To answer the 64k dollar question YES...the image quality on the new blu-ray is noticeably improved and I'm not even a guy with a massively expensive home theater system and I was blown away by the rich blacks and overall just the brilliant and staggeringly beautiful black and white film I was enjoying..seemingly for the first time at moments.<br /><br />I picked mine up for a bit over 50 bucks and consider it a deal.<br /><br />If you don't really care about Michael Curtiz or a better picture...the old Blu Ray set or even single blu ray disc will be fine for many... but if you are a film fan and a fan of glorious Black & White with lovely play between shadows and light....don't miss it!<br /><br />UPDATE!!  I just found a single disc version of this as an exclusive at Target for only $14.99!!!  Its the same first disc as this set with the two new documentaries...a bunch of the older ones AND the newly upgraded video for a fraction of the price ...so if you don't want the book and the box and the extra DVD ....THIS IS A DEAL. I think had I seen it first I'd skip the box!!!!  Hope this helps...</p></br><a href="../users/AW003H7Z3OCHA.html">AW003H7Z3OCHA</a><br/><p>Casablanca is the 2nd greatest movie of the 100 top  in the last 100 years according to the American Film Institute (AFI) poll of 1998.<p>Warner Brothers Studios produce an abundance of hit patriotic romance features during the War Years (1940's).

The Italian Ugarte (Peter Lorre) gives Rick two of these priceless letters just before he's arrested by Louis Renault (Claude Rains), a corrupt police captain. Ugarte dies in custody, leaving an embittered Rick with the dilemma of giving the transit docs to Ilsa and her husband, Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid), a Czech Resistance refugee, or saving them for his own escape. Lazlo selflessly suggests that Rick use the papers to escort Ilsa to safety while he remains in Casablanca.

What did you do and what did you think, huh?<br />Casablanca. 1942. Defines old school classic. It was directed by Michael Curtiz, starring Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman and Paul Henreid, and featuring Claude Rains, Conrad Veidt, Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre and Dooley Wilson. This movie has a plot that appears to be simple but could possibly be more complicated then life itself.<br />The great Humphrey Bogart plays Rick. Rick owns a bar in Morocco during World War II called Rick's Cafe. This bar & casino is frequented by shady characters from all over Europe. Most of these individuals are looking for one of three things: a drink, freedom, or love. One random night it all changes when Rick's old squeeze walks in and brings all the familiar feelings with her. The only problem is that this ain't no ordinary girl. She is beautiful and she is directly connected to the resistance. Love or liberty? This film asks the big questions in a fun way. It is still going strong today and you certainty don't need special effects to see why. You can practically smell the booze and feel the heartache. Watch it then, watch it now, and watch it tomorrow: Casablanca is as cool as they come.<br /><br />Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she walks into mine.</p></br><a href="../users/A3OXHLG6DIBRW8.html">A3OXHLG6DIBRW8</a><br/><p>Casablanca is one of the classic movie greats. This is Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman at their best, and the supporting cast is full of well known actors of the time (Paul Henreid, Claude Rains, Conrad Veidt, Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, and Dooley Wilson).<br /><br />Set in Casablanca during WW II, the plot focuses on the somewhat upscale "Rick's Cafe Americaine" where a healthy amount of black market deals are made, a lot of liquor is sold, and gambling is a losing proposition for most of the patrons. Casablanca was the hub for refugees trying to get passage to Portugal and the Americas and many of the documents required for transit had to be procured through questionable means. This is where the story takes off with the love triangle between Bogart, Bergman, and Henreid.<br /><br />We have been watching a lot of classic movies with our teens to show them where a lot of the quotes they hear come from, and Casablanca is very rich territory indeed: "Play it, Sam", "Here's looking at you kid", "This is the beginning of a beautiful friendship", "Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she walks into mine.", "Round up the usual suspects", "We'll always have Paris"<br /><br />This movie has everything, including great acting, romance, action, good music, and exotic locations. The cinematography is simply amazing and gives the movie a truly grand feel.<br /><br />This is a classic that shouldn't be missed!

Serious writing, brilliant acting, ravishing cinematography, and unpredictably thrilling story are throughout the picture. Everything that I desire in a film is all contained in Casablanca. When I think of Humphrey Bogart, I think of him as dark, mysterious Richard Blaine, a typical anti-hero who turns out to be a greater hero than imagined. Ingrid Bergman has never been more beautiful. Paul Henreid is just a classic...easily the best role of his career. Sixty-two years have passed by, there will always be Casablanca, and Casablanca will always have a place in my heart. From the start to the end, Casablanca is impeccably made because every aspect as possible in this film is streamed through without any flaw. It stands the test of time as the better alternative of Romeo and Juliet story.

Warner Home Video has honored this wartime romantic drama with an elaborate box set to commemorate the 70th anniversary of its theatrical release.<br /><br />World War II is raging and the Nazis are occupying North Africa, but Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) is sitting out the war in Casablanca as proprietor of the most popular nightclub in town.  The cynical Rick comes into possession of two letters of transit permitting their carriers to leave the country.  To placate Nazi Major Strasser (Conrad Veidt), local police Captain Renault (Claude Rains) detains Czech underground leader Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid), who is accompanied by Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman), Rick's former love.  Old flames are rekindled and Rick plans use the letters of transit to leave Casablanca with Ilsa.<br /><br />The film could have turned out to be a standard wartime drama, but everything clicked:  Michael Curtiz's direction; a fresh and clever script; colorful characters; the chemistry between Bogart and Bergman; a first-class supporting cast (Rains, Peter Lorre, Sydney Greenstreet, Dooley Wilson); a haunting song, "As Time Goes By," that runs through the film as Rick and Ilsa's love theme; and the immediacy of a war whose outcome was still undetermined.<br /><br />Humphrey Bogart, who had previously played gangsters, took on his first romantic lead in "Casablanca."  George Raft had unsuccessfully angled for the role of Rick.  Ingrid Bergman, under contract at the time to David O. Selznick, was borrowed by Jack Warner to co-star with Bogart.  Composer Max Steiner was against using "As Time Goes By" and Warner finally agreed to let him write an original song for the movie, but by then Bergman had cut her hair for another movie and couldn't re-shoot the scenes in which the song was heard.  Sam, Rick's singer-pianist, who performs the song, was nearly made a female, with Hazel Scott, Lena Horne, and Ella Fitzgerald considered for the role.  Dooley Wilson, the eventual Sam, was a drummer and faked playing the piano.<br /><br />No movie has more memorable dialogue.  "Here's looking at you, kid" was voted as the Number 5 most famous movie quote by the American Film Institute.  Other lines that live in memory include "We'll always have Paris," "Round up the usual suspects," "The problems of two people don't amount to a hill of beans in this world," and "I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship."  But Bogie never spoke the line "Play it again Sam."  That was the title of Woody Allen's 1972 homage to "Casablanca."  Rather, Rick says to Sam, who had performed the song at Ilsa's request, "You played it for her.

He seemed to like the film enough until the famous Le Marsailles scene where Paul Henreid's Victor Laszlo rallies the Rick's Cafe Americain crowd (and drowns out the Germans) with a rousing rendition of the French national anthem. At that point my friend sneered with disgust that the scene was ludicrous because the French are a bunch of defeatist cowards who would never show such blatant resistance. I tried to explain to him both the historical context and the importance of the scene to the film. He wouldn't have it -- his mind was made up. Disgusted, I switched off the VCR and told him that if he couldn't accept that scene, he might as well not watch the rest of the movie. I haven't seen this friend in over ten years, so I don't know if he ever saw the whole film and/or broadened his Bill O'Reilly perception of the French. I certainly hope so.<br /><br />What's amazing to me is that several other people I've met have questioned the purpose of that scene minus the anti-France diatribe. Some of them see the scene as wartime jingoism. Some of them like the scene but still think it's unnecessary. One girl in my college film class even said that the scene's purpose was solely to "give Paul Henreid more to do." Mind boggling, to say the least.<br /><br />Up until the Le Marsailles scene, we think we know the characters and their motivations: Humphrey Bogart's Rick Blaine is a world-wearly cynic who was left embittered by his Ilsa Lund's perceived abandonment -- his past as a gun runner to the Republican forces in Spain seems to be a part of him that is dead and buried; Ingrid Bergman's Ilsa Lund is the woman who has callously deserted our hero for Victor Laszlo, though it is clear she is still in love with Rick; Henreid's Victor Laszlo is a cold and distant person who puts everything, including Ilsa, second to his work; Claude Rains' Louis Renault is an amoral bureaucrat whose own pleasures are his only motivation.<br /><br />The Les Marsailles scene, however, puts everything into perspective, giving the characters depth as well as foreshadowing what they will do later in the film. The Germans, led by Conrad Veidt's Major Strasser, are singing German military songs when Laszlo commandeers Rick's band and leads them, the patrons and the staff in a chorus of Les Marsailles that drowns out the Germans. Rick doesn't have to order his band to accompany Laszlo in his rendition of Les Marsailles, but he unhesitatingly gives his permission, hinting that his long dormant idealism is still alive and well. It sets up his memorable sacrifice at the end of the film when he gives up the love of his life for the greater good.<br /><br />The audience, likewise, gains a much greater understanding of Ilsa from that scene. Up until that time, the audience is tempted to wonder why she would leave Rick for this activist who puts his cause above everything, including her. She may still love Rick, but when she gazes at Laszlo during the scene, it's clear that not only does she love him as well, she also believes in his cause and admires the passion and fervor he brings to his work and beliefs. Suddenly, the audience realizes why it's not so easy for Ilsa to simply go back to Rick and why the decision is so difficult for her.<br /><br />Laszlo suddenly becomes worthy of competing with Rick for Ilsa's affections. As much as we root for Rick, we also realize during this scene that Laszlo is a true hero who, unlike Rick, has never lost his passion and idealism despite the horrors he has been put through and witnessed. For the first time, the audience begins to wonder if Ilsa should really choose Rick over Laszlo. Later, when Rick initially denies the letters of transit to Ilsa so she and Laszlo can escape, the audience's sympathies have turned 180 degrees from the beginning of the film. We begin to see Rick as somewhat selfish for letting his own desires get in the way of the cause. When he comes to his senses and not only gives Ilsa and Laszlo the letters, but gives up Ilsa as well, we know that it's the right decision.<br /><br />Louis' later conversion to the side of right and virtue isn't as blatantly foreshadowed in the Les Marsailles scene. However, when the Germans are singing their military songs, he does register pronounced disgust with what he is hearing. He half-heartedly fights Major Strasser's later order to shut down Rick's, saying lamely that "everyone is having such a good time." However, he has made clear with his earlier expression of disgust that he detests the Germans and goes along with their orders out of convenience and not idealogical agreement.<br /><br />Without the Les Marsailles scene, Rick goes from cynic to idealist without any explanation, Ilsa's indecision is inexplicable, Laszlo seems unworthly to take Ilsa from Rick and Louis goes from appeaser to resistor without any warning. The story just wouldn't work without it. The scene switches the focus of the story from lost love to supporting the greater good. It's emotion rivals that of the final airport scene and is absolutely critical to Casablanca. It's so important to the story that I think that the film wouldn't have become the classic it is without it.<br /><br />In 1981, Harry Reasoner produced an excellent segment for 60 Minutes on Casablanca. He pointed out that when Casablanca was released, the Germans did occupy France as well as large parts of Africa, including Casablanca. This wasn't a period piece about events from a long time ago and the emotions portrayed in the Les Marsailles scene were very fresh and very current at the time Casablanca was being filmed. Not only is it absolutely critical to the plot, but it is also a snapshot of the feelings and passions of that time as it was happening. I hope that those who dismiss the scene can go back and, with some deepened perspective, can understand both why the Les Marsailles scene is so important to Casablanca's greatness and what it tells us about what 1942 America's beliefs and feelings were. It might give renewed perspective on our own conflict in Iraq. At the very least, I hope it convinces my friend that the French aren't really so bad after all.</p></br><a href="../users/A3D6TFYRMIV3ZL.html">A3D6TFYRMIV3ZL</a><br/><p>Aaaahhh ... Bogey. AFI's No. 1 film star of the 20th century. Hollywood's original noir anti-hero, epitome of the handsome, cynical and oh-so lonesome wolf (with "Casablanca"'s Rick Blaine alone, one of the Top 5 guys on the AFI's list of greatest 20th century film heroes); looking unbeatably cool in white dinner jacket or trenchcoat and fedora alike, a glass of whiskey in his hand and a cigarette dangling from the corner of his mouth. Endowed with a legendary aura several times larger than his real life stature, and still admired by scores of women wishing they had been born 50+ years earlier, preferably somewhere in California and to parents connected with the movie business, so as to have at least a marginal chance of meeting him.<br /><br />Triple-Oscar-winning "Casablanca," directed by Michael Curtiz, was and still is without question Bogart's greatest career-defining moment, the movie on which his legendary status is grounded more than on any other of his multiple successes.  The film's story is based on Murray Burnett and Joan Alison's play "Everybody Comes to Rick's," renamed by Warner Brothers in order to tag onto the success of the studio's 1938 hit "Algiers" (starring Charles Boyer and Hedy Lamarr). Building on the success of 1941's "The Maltese Falcon" and further expanding Bogart's increasingly complex on-screen personality, it added a romantic quality which had heretofore been missing; eventually making this the AFI's Top 20th century love story (even before the No. 2 "Gone With the Wind"), while second only to "Citizen Kane" on the AFI's overall list of Top 100 20th century movies; with a unique, inimitable blend of drama, passion, humor, exotic North African atmosphere, patriotism, unforgettable score (courtesy of Herman Hupfeld's "As Time Goes By," Max Steiner and Louis Kaufman's violin) and an all-star cast, consisting besides Bogart of Ingrid Bergman (Ilsa), Paul Henreid (Victor Laszlo), Claude Rains (Captain Renault), Dooley Wilson (who, a drummer by trade, had to fake his piano playing as Rick's friend Sam), Conrad Veidt (Major Strasser), Sydney Greenstreet (Ferrari) and Peter Lorre (Ugarte). And the movie's countless famous one-liners have long attained legendary status in their own right ...<br /><br />Looking at this movie's and its stars' almost mythical fame, it is difficult to imagine that, produced at the height of the studio system era, it was originally just one of the roughly 50 movies released over the course of one year. But mass production didn't equal low quality; on the contrary, the great care given to all production values, from script-writing to camera work, editing, score and the stars' presentation in the movies themselves and in their trailers, was at least partly responsible for its lasting success.  In fact, the screenplay for "Casablanca" was constantly rewritten even throughout the filming process, to the point that particularly Ingrid Bergman was extremely worried because she was unsure whether at the end she (Ilsa) would leave Casablanca with Henreid's Victor Laszlo or stay there with Humphrey Bogart (Rick).<br /><br />Little needs to be said about the movie's story.  After the onset of WWII, Casablanca has become a point of refuge for Jews and other desperate souls from all corners of Europe, fleeing the old world with the hope of building a new life in America.  Unofficial center of Casablanca's society is Rick's "Cafe Americain," where gamblers, refugees, French police, Nazi troops, thieves, swindlers and soldiers of fortune come together on a nightly basis, to make connections, conduct their shady business, or simply forget the uncertainty of their fate for a few precious hours.  And presiding over this mixed and colorful society is Rick Blaine, expatriate American without any hope of returning to the United States himself (for reasons never fully explained), officially not interested in politics but only the flourishing of his business, but soft-hearted underneath the hard shell of his cynicism.  From Rick's perspective, everything is going just swell and the way it is meant to be:  he is reasonably well-respected, has a good working relationship with Captain Renault, the local representative of the Vichy government (based on mutual respect as much as on the fact that Renault is a guaranteed winner at Rick's gambling tables and, by way of reciprocation, turns a blind eye to whatever less-than-squeaky-clean transactions Rick may be tolerating in his cafe, always ready to have his police round up "the usual suspects" instead of the truly guilty party of a crime if that person's continued freedom promises to be more profitable); and although aware of Rick's not quite so apolitical past, the Germans are leaving him alone as well, as long as he stays out of politics now.  Until ... well, until famous underground resistance leader and recent concentration camp-escapee Victor Laszlo and his wife Ilsa walk into Rick's cafe, into his place "of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world" - and with one blow, administered to the melancholy tunes of "As Time Goes By," the carefully maintained equilibrium of his little world comes crashing down around him.<br /><br />The movie's recently-released two-disc special edition is unquestionably superior to the prior single-disc DVD; featuring not only an improved video transfer but also, and notably, a new introduction by Lauren Bacall, additional documentaries ("Bacall on Bogart" and "The Children Remember" with Stephen Bogart and Ingrid Bergman's daughters Pia Lindstrom and Isabella Rosselini) besides the excellent "You Must Remember This" already included on the one-disc edition, newly-discovered deleted scenes, treasures from the production history, commentary tracks with Roger Ebert and historian Rudy Behlmer, as well as several audio documents and fun stuff like web links and the "Looney Tunes" homage "Carrotblanca."<br /><br />Not only to Bogart and Bergman fans all over the world, "Casablanca" is film history's all-time crowning achievement, a "must" in every movie lover's collection, and one of the few films that truly deserve the title "classic."  If you don't already own it, the 2003 release of a two-disc special edition is a great occasion to remedy that omission!<br /><br />Also recommended:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006II5I">Algiers</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005O3V9">Notorious - Criterion Collection</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GIXLUW">Humphrey Bogart - The Signature Collection, Vol. 1 (Casablanca Two-Disc Special Edition / The Treasure of the Sierra Madre Two-Disc Special Edition / They Drive by Night / High Sierra)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GIXLVQ">Humphrey Bogart - The Signature Collection, Vol. 2 (The Maltese Falcon Three-Disc Special Edition / Across the Pacific / Action in the North Atlantic / All Through the Night / Passage to Marseille)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FFL2Q6">Bogie and Bacall - The Signature Collection (The Big Sleep / Dark Passage / Key Largo / To Have and Have Not)</a></p></br><a href="../users/AD2BIAIH78QI5.html">AD2BIAIH78QI5</a><br/><p>Paul Henried's last line to Humphrey Bogart points out that the great "Casablanca", lauded today as a romance, was in fact more importantly a propaganda movie. From our vantage point now in July 2003, it's all too easy sometimes to forget that the war was really raging when this movie was made, and that it was by no means certain that America would triumph ultimately against the forces of Nazi Germany. That reich had managed to conquer most of Europe--only England was able to fend off Hitler's machine. So that when Conrad Veidt's Nazi General Strasser asks Bogart's Rick how he'll feel when the Nazis walk into London, Rick's "I'll tell you when you get there" is a hopeful boast that England will continue to hold out. I try to enter into the mind of the times when I watch "Casablanca" to appreciate how the film was helping to allay the fears of its original audience. How awful to have lived during a time when the entire world was at war. Paul Henried's character in 1942 speaks in the future tense--"we'll win"; thank God we look back now and use the past--"we won". <p>Of course, the romance of Rick and Ilse (Ingrid Bergman) is what everyone else is talking about. Probably this is a little anomalous, too, in the usual Hollywood movie--here it's the guy who got jilted, the guy who's crying into his whiskey, the guy who says hurtful, hurt-filled things. And the guy who must turn away love when it's his again. So Rick is a tragic hero for whom things aren't really turning out right. But he does grow in the movie. He learns that he must go on in his own development--before, he had sworn the piano player Sam never to play "As Time Goes By" again, but he has to get past those kind of self-imposed taboos, not only listening to the song again but taking an interest in humanity again. <p>Bergman's Ilse is a more complicated character. She's torn between two men, her husband and her old lover. Other reviewers have said that "Casablanca" is a perfect film, but there is something that's a little off, and that's the relationship between Ilse and her husband, Resistance leader Victor Lazlo, played by Paul Henried. When they have scenes alone, he speaks of his love for her and she vows to stay by his side. It sounds like they've been through a lot together and are truly attached. However, their love is never shown as a romantic love; when he leaves her to go to a meeting of the Resistance in Casablanca, he kisses her on the cheek. Another time he kisses again, also on the cheek. Only Rick kisses her on the mouth passionately. I suppose this will make her look less like a two-timer to the audience, but it's a little too unrealistic to think that a husband will not kiss his beloved wife with any kind of ardor. I think this undercuts her dilemma of having to figure out which man to leave and which to cleave to. She should be truly romantically involved with both men, not merely "married" to Henried, but shown to be in an intimate relationship with him.  Paul Henried is very likeable as Victor, but his character this way is constructed to be a hero without sufficient human roots. His greatest love capacity seems to be an altruistic one.  Ilse's attraction to Rick is that with him, she's paramount while with Victor she places second to his love for the cause. In effect, what happens to Ilse is that she winds up being second with Rick too as he rekindles an interest in the cause himself. It would be interesting to explore what that would mean to her, that the war is robbing her of a fulfilling romantic love with both men. She could either become embittered or she could be ennobled herself, accepting that there is something bigger than herself that must take precedence. Rick "tells" her this at the airport, but it would be more effective if she knew it within herself as well. The film has her leave with her husband, but how will she really respond?  <p>These are plot considerations--what about everything else? Well, the acting in "Casablanca" is first rate all the way. I've always believed Warner Bros to have had the superior stable to MGM, and this movie proves that point admirably. It stands with "Adventures of Robin Hood" as having the best ensemble performance in Hollywood. Of course, appearing in both movies is one of my very favorite actors, Claude Rains. I just saw the movie last night on a pier in NYC, and his scenes consistently drew the most laughs and applause. In a way, he really runs away with the picture and was cheated out of a Best Supporting Actor Oscar. It's the role of a lifetime, and he does all he can with it. Peter Lorre is wonderful in his early scenes with Bogart as the smarmy insecure Ugarte; he manages to convey his wish to impress Bogart with a lot of economy. Sidney Greenstreet is on target as the sensuous Fat Man. Smaller roles such as the wait staff and bar patrons are all well-executed. And Ingrid Bergman is simply luminous as Ilse. That scene in the Paris bar, when she brushes her hand against Bogart's cheek is pure movie magic--star quality all the way. <p>Like just about everybody, I love "Casablanca" as one of Hollywood's very best achievements; I'm on their side, too, cheering all the way.</p></br><a href="../users/A1A87TUBBDPMF0.html">A1A87TUBBDPMF0</a><br/><p>(To the reader: This review is about the original MGM DVD release and NOT about the 2-disc edition just released.)<p>Casablanca!<p>The very name conjures up an exotic mix of adventure, intrigue, heroism, selfless sacrifice, and romance.  Hear the title of this 1942 Best Picture winner and your memory will provide you with images of Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman, Paul Henreid, Dooley Wilson, Peter Lorre, and Claude Rains.  Or maybe you'll hear snatches of Max Steiner's unforgettable score, with its interpolation of Herman Hupfeld's "As Time Goes By" and the stirring strains of "The Marsellaise."<p>Based on the stage play "Everybody Comes to Rick's" by Murray Burnett and Joan Allison, the movie tells a dramatic story of refugees fleeing from wartorn Europe and making a perilous trip to Casablanca in French Morocco. It is December 1941 and that French colony is under the control of "unoccupied France."  Ostensibly neutral in World War II, Vichy France is nevertheless a German vassal state, as the arrival of Major Strasser (Conrad Veldt) clearly demonstrates.<p>Strasser's mission in Casablanca: to stop Czech underground leader Victor Laszlo (Henreid) from obtaining one of two exit visas stolen from two murdered German couriers and escaping from the Gestapo. Having tracked the defiant Laszlo after his escape from a Nazi concentration camp, Strasser is determined to capture the symbol of anti-Nazi resistance once and for all.<p>Accompanying Laszlo is the beautiful Ilsa Lund (Bergman), a young Norweigan student whom he married in secret before he was captured by the Gestapo in 1940. Devoted to her husband and his great cause, Ilsa has been at his side since Laszlo's miraculous escape and sudden reappearance in Paris.<p>Unbeknownst to Laszlo, however, his fate will now rest in the hands of American saloonkeeper Rick Blaine (Bogart).  In the months following Victor's escape from the concentration camp he was reported as "presumed dead." In loneliness and despair, the grieving Ilsa met and fell in love with Rick in Paris shortly before the German occupation began.  For a brief time the lovers were together, only to tragically part ways when news of Laszlo's return reached Ilsa. <p>Now, in the eve of America's entry into World War II, Victor Laszlo's fate hangs on the conflicting emotions felt by both Rick and Ilsa, as well as the shifting loyalties of French police Capt. Louis Renault (Rains).<p>The screenplay by Julius J. and Philip G. Epstein and Howard Koch is a wonderful mixture of romance, intrigue, drama and comedy (the latter provided both by colorful characters and witty exchanges). Director Michael Curtiz and producer Hal B. Wallis made Casablanca as one of many movies produced in 1942, never knowing that it would become a classic of Hollywood's Golden Era.</p></br><a href="../users/A1SVXJZ3386U2D.html">A1SVXJZ3386U2D</a><br/><p>The turn of the century produced a lot of lists including &quot;Best Movies&quot;.  I noted that &quot;Casablanca&quot; ranked right up there with the best American movies of all-time.  Many would argue that it is the BEST movie of all time.  I certainly have in in my top-ten because it is one of those classics where everything came together just right.  The acting is superb and there is a great chemistry between the main characters.  The story-line was exciting, believable, and emotional.  The audience is drawn into the emotion and no one but the hardest boiled eggs among us gets away without a heart-warming or heart-breaking reaction.  The directing is great, the music is memorable, the supporting actors terrific...what else am I missing?  It has it all.  <p>For some the message may be diluted somewhat by time but most of us know from hindsight that this movie takes places in a time of upheaval.  Lives are at stake.  The casino setting is an excellent metaphor for the twists of fate that have affected so many in this corner of the world.  Into this crossroads of humanity come two former lovers who meet unexpectedly.  Their lives have changed since they parted but their love was strong.  What will happen now that they meet again?  This mixture of romance and adventure makes &quot;Casablanca&quot; a movie for everyone.<p>The greatness of &quot;Casablanca&quot; might be best appreciated by speculating on what if the movie HAD been made with Ronald Reagan instead of Humphrey Bogart.  That was supposedly the person the studio initially had in mind for the role of Rick.  Opinions vary on Reagan as President but as an actor he was strictly &quot;B movie&quot; quality.  Make that change or any other of a number of possible changes in the acting, the script, the directing etc. and you would end up with a lesser movie.  That is why &quot;Casablanca&quot; is so loved even after all these years.  It works so well because everything came together just right.  If you have not seen this movie, you must do so.  I recommend that you watch it with your spouse or significant other.  You'll probably always remember the night that you did.</p></br><a href="../users/A2U0DKQPZSD50Y.html">A2U0DKQPZSD50Y</a><br/><p>Humphrey Bogart is one of the best actors all time and his role as Rick solidifies that statement.

This movie has more classic lines than just about any other ever made -- 'Round up the usual suspects', for example. Add to that great actors, starting with Bogart, who really makes this movie. His character is magnetic, compelling, bold and yet tender. Fabulous. Claude Rains as the chief inspector brings humor, wit and a sly intelligence to the role. Watching Bergman is watching the prototype for movie heroines of the golden age... The story itself, from 1942, was ahead of its time, talking about concentration camps in a way that seems almost cliche now but was the first script of its kind then. The bad guys -- hey, they're Nazis! You don't get better bad guys than that. As for the DVD, it's a really, really good print that looks great, with improved sound and an extended making of featurette that was originally made for VHS.

Warner Brothers put out an excellent <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009W0WM">2-disc Special Edition</a> in 2003.  (That older set is going to receive new artwork on December 2nd, but it will otherwise be the same.)  This new 2-disc Ultimate Collector's Blu-ray Edition includes the features from the 2003 set and adds a documentary about studio head Jack Warner, along with a bunch of memorabilia.  This is the only Blu-ray edition.  Here are the announced new features, the ones not included in the 2003 set.  All but the first are memorabilia.<br /><br />-- Jack L. Warner: The Last Mogul, a 1993 full-length biographical documentary (104 minutes)<br />-- 48-page photo book<br />-- 10 roughly 5x7" cards with color reproductions of poster art and such<br />-- 3 reproductions of archival correspondence (a memo from producer Hal Wallis changing the title to Casablanca, a memo from Wallis to studio head Jack Warner urging the casting of Bogart over George Raft, and a letter from the publicity head instructing the publicist to shift Bogart's image from tough to romantic lead)<br />-- reproduction of Victor Laszlo's letter of transit<br />-- passport holder with Casablanca logo<br />-- luggage tag with Casablanca logo<br />-- mail-in offer for 27x40" movie poster<br />-- all in a pretty collector's box with an intricate laser-cut Moroccan design<br /><br />The documentary, which comprises the second disc, is also available separately on standard DVD (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000COF1QW">here</a>).  It was written, directed and produced by a grandson of Warner, and is said (by Variety) to be somewhat sentimental but not to overlook Warner's defects.  It isn't about Casablanca in particular.<br /><br />There are more than enough extras in the 2-disc standard DVD edition for most people.  I'll list them below.  The video and sound quality of that set are very good, about as good as could be for a 1942 film on standard DVD.  The movie was released in 1080p HD in 2006, and it was acclaimed as looking even better, sharper, smoother, with more detail.  The 1080p Blu-ray should look the same as the HD.  Whether it's enough better to matter to you is an individual thing.<br /><br />The movie is set in 1941 Casablanca, Morocco, controlled by the Nazi-collaborating Vichy French government.  Bogart plays Rick, a nightclub owner with a past he doesn't talk about and a determination not to get caught up in current events.  "I stick my neck out for nobody," he says.  He comes into possession of two letters of transit, invaluable items to the many refugees seeking passage out of the grasp of the Nazis.  The intended recipients of the letters soon show up, resistance leader Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid) and his wife Ilsa (Bergman).  Ilsa, it turns out, was once Rick's lover, who broke his heart when she left him with no explanation.  Their old flame is rekindled despite themselves, and Rick must decide whether to help his rival for her love, thereby helping the war effort he has claimed no interest in, or help himself.<br /><br />No one expected this movie to be such a classic, and even though it won three major Academy Awards, including Best Picture, it only gained its place as a classic gradually over the years.  Undoubtedly the two stars are a big part of the reason it grew on us.  Bogart is perfect as a cynic who has more heart than he lets on.  Just by being there, Bergman instantly conveys every reason we need to understand Rick's broken heart and feel the force of his dilemma, and she convincingly portrays her own conflict between two loves.  Somehow the movie also gets other things just so.  Several of the supporting actors manage to be morally corrupt and still likable; others are just likable.  The writing, a fair amount of it done quickly, by committee, with no thought of it being great writing, has panache, and hits on several turns of phrase that just work.  Even the music works beyond what was expected, making "As Time Goes By" unforgettable.  All of these things lift up the story of love, higher duty, and the triumph of good over evil, and over cynicism.<br /><br />Here's the list of the features included from the 2003 Special Edition:<br /><br />-- Introduction by Bogart's wife and frequent co-star Lauren Bacall (2 minutes)<br />-- Audio commentaries<br />. . . . . by Roger Ebert<br />. . . . . by film historian/author Rudy Behlmer<br />-- Documentaries and featurette<br />. . . . .

Even though it was made as an obvious war-time morale booster at a time when America needed it, and these kinds of films were the most commonplace and most wanted kind of entertainment, this particular one turned out to be something very special. Bogart starred in several of these kinds of films, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GIXLVQ">Humphrey Bogart - The Signature Collection, Vol. 2 (The Maltese Falcon Three-Disc Special Edition / Across the Pacific / Action in the North Atlantic / All Through the Night / Passage to Marseille)</a> is full of them, yet I enjoy these films over and over. They are not just some dated WWII epics as so many films of that era come across today. So part of the attraction just has to be Bogart himself, the knowledge that nobody is that tough - yet Bogart pulls it off, and at the same time you can believe him capable of feeling the most intense romantic love possible. Or he can just use women and cast them aside - Bogie always keeps you guessing. Also, Casablanca is just about the most romantic film ever made. Finally, there are those wonderful supporting players - Peter Lorre, Sydney Greenstreet, and the scene-stealing Claude Rains who claims to be shocked that there is gambling going on at Rick's Cafe Americain as he pockets his winnings.<br /><br />If you don't already own Casablanca, I feel it's an essential classic movie purchase, even if you're not really a classic movie fan. However, the only thing changing here versus the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009W0WM">Casablanca (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a> is the artwork and the documentary on Jack Warner. My personal opinion is that, for the value, that is the better buy. Thus I arrived at my rating as follows:<br /><br />The film = 5 stars<br />The value of this edition = 3 stars<br />This averages to four stars.<br /><br />Warner Home Video has slowed down its release of classic films new to DVD this year and retreated to the safer territory of reissuing some of its sure-sellers. I hope that this is just a temporary decision based on the bad economy and not the beginning of a trend.</p></br><a href="../users/AUTBHG6070SL4.html">AUTBHG6070SL4</a><br/><p>I've probably seen this movie more times than any other, and I'll keep watching it, year after year.<br /><br />A lot has been said about Casablanca, so all I can add is my personal impressions. This movie is black and white. Even if color had been available, black and white would still have worked better. The scenes, the closeups of people, they all have some some monumental quality, some kind of skill that's been lost for decades, now. The personalities also stand out in black and white - a resistance hero, a man without a country, a cheerfully venial functionary. Even the DC-3 in the last scene is the icon of a plane, F-15s and 747s not withstanding.<br /><br />No one can claim to be literate if they haven't seen this movie, no more than if they haven't heard Beethoven's Ninth. At the time, this movie was just one among many churned out assembly-line style. Something in it captivated people, though, and keeps captivating them today.<br /><br />Whether or not it's your first time, be captivated.<br /><br />//wiredweird</p></br><a href="../users/A17NFLRFTMYXF5.html">A17NFLRFTMYXF5</a><br/><p>Rick and Louis start<p>A beautiful friendship while<p>Ilsa gets on plane</p></br><a href="../users/AGKPTMTR3UX1R.html">AGKPTMTR3UX1R</a><br/><p>CASABLANCA comes in at Number Two consistently in any list of the "100 Greatest Movies of All Time," usually tailing CITIZEN KANE.  I've seen both. CITIZEN KANE has an indefinable air of confidence in itself that makes it "greater," but in terms of entertainment value, CITIZEN KANE is relegated to film school classes while CASABLANCA belongs to the viewer.<br /><br />CASABLANCA is so full of gifted dialogue that people who have never seen the film know it's lines . . . "You must remember this," the opening line of the theme song, "As Time Goes By," "Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship," "We'll always have Paris," "Here's looking at you, Kid," "Of all the gin joints in all the world, she walks into mine," and "Round up the usual suspects" are cultural markers. Even the scat dialogue, "Play it again, Sam" was the title of a Woody Allen homage to CASABLANCA; that line is never spoken in CASABLANCA itself. The nearest line is, "Play it, Sam, for old times' sake."<br /><br />So much of CASABLANCA is in the casting. Many of the extras and repetoire players were in fact refugees from Hitler's Europe. Humphrey Bogart is the lead, ruggedly, though not impossibly handsome, while his love interest, played by Ingrid Bergman,  has inspired me to sit my son down in front of the screen with the explanation, "That's a GIRL." Claude Rains plays the witty, amoral Captain Louis Renault with a gleam in his eye. Sidney Greenstreet, "leader of all illegal activities in Casablanca, an influential and respected man" makes suggestions, "why I do not know, since it cannot possibly profit me."<br /><br />In the days CASABLANCA was made, lower-budget films were churned out weekly by the studios, in reliance on stock characters, a stable of contract character actors, and quick-drawn scripts. This film has a natural chemistry---not a scene unneeded, a line unnecessary---that lifted it above its origins.  There are other similar films of the period with essentially the same cast. None of them is CASABLANCA.<br /><br />If you've never seen CASABLANCA, SEE IT. You are missing one of life's great pleasures and treasures. For those of you who haven't, it is the story of Rick Blaine, an American expatriate living in Casablanca at the end of 1941. He owns Rick's Cafe Americain, a classy nightclub where the denizens of wartime Casablanca---Arabs, Frenchmen, Nazi soldiers, spies, smugglers, thieves, Resistance Fighters, war refugees, and the merely unanchored---congregate nightly in order to conduct what business they can.  Although once a supporter of humanitarian causes, Blaine is now hopelessly cynical, and sticks his neck out for nobody.<br /><br />This "wise foreign policy" begins to unravel, when the black marketeer, Signor Ugarte (Peter Lorre) is arrested in the cafe for murder. What no one but Rick knows is that Ugarte has obtained two laissez-passer from his victims, exit visas he is planning to sell "for more money than you can possibly even imagine" to the Freedom Fighter Viktor Laszlo (Paul Henreid) and his wife.<br /><br />The plot thickens when the Laszlos arrive. Ugarte has left the passes in Rick's possession, but Rick has no intention of selling them, once he discovers that Mrs. Laszlo is the love of his life, Ilsa Lund. Rick and Ilsa met and fell deeply in love in Paris. It had been their plan to flee ahead of the Germans and marry once in a safe haven, but Ilsa chose to leave Rick at the last moment without any explanation.<br /><br />Rick's cynicism hardens into pure jadedness. Although he is aware that Laszlo is a great leader of the anti-Nazi underground, and though he knows that Laszlo will probably be killed unless he is helped to escape, Rick refuses any entreaties from Laszlo. Only Ilsa's loving heart saves his spirit; and renewed, he sends Viktor and Ilsa safely on to America.<br /><br />CASABLANCA is a true romance. From Laszlo's line to the German Kommandant, "You'll forgive me if I'm not gracious," to Ilsa's tearful explanation of her decision to leave Rick for his own safety, people simply never talked that way, nor acted that way in real life. They never stood on the airport tarmac in the fog saying noble things as they bid farewell forever. But there is something so glorious in the film that we wish we could be Rick and Ilsa. CASABLANCA is its audience, perfected.</p></br><a href="../users/A26JGAM6GZMM4V.html">A26JGAM6GZMM4V</a><br/><p>Only Citizen Kane was ranked higher when the American Film Institute announced its list of "America's Greatest Movies." (The Godfather, Gone with the Wind, and Lawrence of Arabia complete the top five.) My own opinion is that AFI ranked Casablanca higher than it deserves. Nonetheless, the film remains immensely popular among critics and film historians as well as so-called movie buffs. It received an Academy Award as best film in 1943, as did Michael Curtiz for directing it. Bogart and Bergman are joined by an especially strong supporting cast (notably Greenstreet, Henreid, Lorre, Rains, and Veidt). There really isn't much to the plot but the dialogue is first-rate. (Philip Epstein, Julius Epstein, and Howard W. Koch shared an Oscar for best screenplay.) It is tempting to over-analyze this film by, for example, devoting excessive attention to American versus European sensibilities during World War II, the conflict between what Rick and Ilsa want to do with what they think they ought to do, etc. <p>Obviously, the war in progress outside of Rick's cafe cannot be denied although he makes every effort to insulate himself and his clientele from it. There is no shortage of social and political issues and yet, in my opinion, the significance of the film -- and its enduring appeal -- is explained by the development of the relationship between Rick and Ilsa. The final resolution is necessarily somewhat ambiguous, I think, precisely because the relationship between two people in war time faces quite different challenges, obligations, and implications than it would otherwise. Ultimately, having recently seen this film again in a special edition, accompanied by an abundance of supplementary features (e.g.  Roger Ebert's commentary, Lauren Bacall's Introduction, and about ten minutes of additional scenes and out takes), I think the film now has a special symbolic significance which could not have been evident when it was released in 1942. More specifically, it somehow dramatizes what so many of us also struggle with when seeking a balance of obligations to ourselves and to others as well as to certain values which sustain the human race, especially during crises which threaten its survival. Perhaps I make too much of this film but these are among the reasons why it continues to hold special meaning for me.</p></br><a href="../users/A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV.html">A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV</a><br/><p>"And what in heaven's name brought you to Casablanca?" -- Renault<br /><br />"My health. I came to Casablanca for the waters." -- Rick<br /><br />"The waters? What waters? We're in the desert!" -- Renault<br /><br />"I was misinformed." -- Rick<br /><br />Any film buff watching this screen classic today will certainly get a sense of having seen this formula over and over. Howard Hawks remade it in a fashion, and actually improved upon it by putting his distinct spin on it, in To Have and Have Not. While it often gets overpraised because it is a beloved favorite of critics, it also doesen't receive the credit due it. The four strongest performances here, namely Bogart, Rains, Lorre, and Joy Page, who rarely even gets a mention, didn't garner the Academy Award. It can be argued that any solid studio director from this period could have made a great film out of the terrific screenplay worked on by many but credited to Howard Koch and Julius and Philip Epstein, and the fine cast assembled. But it is a film which is more than the sum of its parts, and the reason why it has been copied so often over the years.<br /><br />Bogart is Rick Blaine, doing okay running Rick's Cafe Americain in Casablanca, in French Morocco. Everyone must go through Casablanca to get to Lisbon, and freedom from the turmoil brought about by Hitler's ever growing expansion. Rick runs his cafe and gambling house unencumbered by politics, looking out only for himself and a few close and loyal employees like Sam (Dooley Wilson) and Carl (S.Z. Sakall). Peter Lorre is marvelous as the criminal who worships Rick, and seeks his approval. It is really what happens to Ugarte (Lorre) which turns Rick against the Nazi's and for the French Resistance, though it won't become evident until the film is nearly over. It is perhaps, the most interesting relationship in the film, made more so since Lorre meets his end early on.<br /><br />Ugarte leaves Rick a letter of transit which can't even be questioned, when in pops Rick's reason for hiding out in Casablanca; Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman). Rick's bitter disillusionment with love all goes back to what happened in Paris, where Ilsa left him holding his heart in his hand. The montages were in part directed by Don Siegel, who would direct Mitchum and Greer in The Big Steal, and later become well known for Dirty Harry with Clint Eastwood. Ilsa isn't alone, however, bringing with her her husband, Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid). He is the lead figure behind the movement to rid the French of the Third Reich. They would prefer he never make it to Lisbon. Caught in between is the pragmatic Captain Renault (Claude Rains). He gives a terrific performance, full of humor and larceny. It is never clear which side he is on. Ilsa wants her husband Victor to escape with his life but Rick isn't so ready to hand over those transit papers; not without some graveling and an explanation for the way he was burned by her.<br /><br />Perhaps Bergman was a good second choice for Ilsa after all. The viewer knows she's messed Rick up, and wants it to be righted, while at the same time sensing they don't belong together. Her casting and lack of chemistry with Bogart makes the ending easier to take for me. Before we get there, however, there are some terrific moments from Joy Page as a young wife fleeing Bulgaria and desperate to get she and her husband out of Casablanca. What Rick does to help her out, and get around her making a mistake with Renault, shows the effect Ugarte's killing by the Germans had on him. Rick is at heart a softhearted romantic, which is why he was cut so deeply by Ilsa's getting over on him in Paris. There was a reason, however, and once he knows what it is, he'll come to the same decision the viewer has.<br /><br />Casablanca won the Academy Award for Best Picture, Screenplay, and Direction (Michael Curtiz). Bogart would have won for Best Actor, Rains for Supporting Actor, and Joy Page for Best Supporting Actress in a different time and place. While this isn't the Noir masterpiece many describe it as, it is one amazingly smooth blend of genres which pleases everyone, and makes it one of the great films of all-time. Silent film fans might even catch a glimpse of star Monte Blue as an uncredited American. Bogart and Bergman fans can enjoy watching this over and over, as it is one of those films almost universally cherished by movie lovers.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R6RA8FRBS608.html">A2R6RA8FRBS608</a><br/><p>Casablanca is one of the most essential films you should watch and own in your DVD collection. Casablanca has action, romance, intrigue and much, much more. It's also a story about people suffering in the most desperate of times during World War II when The Nazis were occupying many countries and even had a presence in North Africa where this film takes place. The cinematography and the choreography are excellent. In addition, the acting is superlative and the plot moves along at a very good pace.<br /><br />When the action starts, we see the French Moroccan town of Casablanca where refugees from Nazi Europe come in the hopes of getting a high priced, black market exit visa to Lisbon--and from there, America. An expatriate named Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) owns a nightclub in Casablanca where they serve up the drinks and the local Vichy government official Captain Renault (Claude Rains) turns a blind eye to the illegal gambling there--just so long as Rick lets him win at roulette! At the same time we also learn that two German couriers have been killed--and the two exit visas they had have been stolen by an unknown thief. The Nazis are fast on the hunt for this man, whom they believe to be a big resistance fighter named Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid). Laszlo has been a tough enemy of the Nazis; he even escaped from a concentration camp!<br /><br />One night Victor and his wife Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman) enter Rick's caf&eacute; hoping to buy those two precious exit visas from a character simply named Ugarte (Peter Lorre). Ugarte gets into a fight with some Nazis and he is killed--but not before he slips the exit visas to Rick for some "temporary safekeeping." Eventually the Nazi Major Strasser (Conrad Veidt) confronts Victor and his wife Ilsa in his office with Captain Renault; but Strasser will only let them out of Casablanca if Victor rats on other leaders of the resistance movement.<br /><br />Meanwhile, a whole other story is percolating--and this aspect of the story gets pretty hot, too. It seems that just before the German occupation of France, Rick and Victor's wife Ilsa had a brief love affair. At the time, Ilsa thought that Victor was dead and so she didn't think she was cheating on him. However, Rick gets a huge shock. Just when Rick and his sidekick Sam the piano player (Dooley Wilson) are about to leave Paris for safer ground along with Ilsa, Sam hands Rick a note from Ilsa telling him they can never see each other again and she doesn't even say why. But now that Rick sees Ilsa is married to Victor, Rick finally knows why Ilsa dumped him. But wow, he is upset and angry anyway! He still loves Ilsa; and she loves both him and Victor in her heart of hearts.<br /><br />Although it may seem that I've already written too much, I already left out some juicy details to the plot to keep you interested up to this point. And, of course, this is all very heavy stuff--how will it all turn out? Will Victor be trapped by Major Strasser and the other Nazis and be unable to leave Casablanca? Will Ilsa leave Victor for Rick now that she knows she still loves Rick? What ever does happen to those exit visas that Ugarte gave to Rick--does Rick hold onto them or will he sell them to the highest bidder and get out of Casablanca himself? Watch and find out!<br /><br />The single DVD version of this movie doesn't have too many extras; but you will get a half-hour documentary entitled "You Must Remember This" which is both hosted and narrated by Lauren Bacall. We do get outtakes but they are included in this documentary.  In addition, I believe that if you buy the two DVD edition of this film, you get a much longer (almost 90 minute) documentary about Humphrey Bogart's career also hosted by Lauren Bacall. The two DVD edition has commentaries by Roger Ebert and Rudy Behlmer.<br /><br />Casablanca is a "must-have" movie with outstanding attention to detail; the story is practically guaranteed to have quite an effect on you. I highly recommend this film for fans of the actors in it; and people who enjoy classic movies will cherish this as well.</p></br><a href="../users/A1MX6D3JK6IKDW.html">A1MX6D3JK6IKDW</a><br/><p>Timeless movie filmed  in appropriate black and white. (Avoid the artficially colorized version like the plague). Again,incredibly, I've talked to many who have never seen this film!

OBVIOUS MISTAKE IN ADVERTISEMENT-INGRID BERGMAN,NOT LAUREN BECALL SHOULD BE LISTED!</p></br><a href="../users/AQBRMBQ99ESI7.html">AQBRMBQ99ESI7</a><br/><p>CASABLANCA is rightfully recognized as one of the best films ever made. To me, it is the best film ever made. It has a bit of everything which can be a recipe for disaster but, in this case, it all comes together to work a miracle.<br /><br />It is not your regular war movie. It takes place at the opening of World War II and involves themes and current events from that war but the war is not the star. It is merely the reason that these people find themselves together in the North African town of Casablanca.<br /><br />It is not an action movie although there are a few shootouts, chases and the like. They are a needed part of the story. When the Nazis or their agents come to get you, you run and they shoot.<br /><br />It is not a comedy although some of the greatest comic lines in all of cinema are found in this gem. "Round up the usual suspects!"<br /><br />It is not a musical although the music is an integral part of the film. It plays a minor but important part. "As Time Goes By" was a decade old when this film came out and was never a hit until this film. Now you cannot help but think of this film without thinking of that song.<br /><br />It is not a love story in the traditional sense. There is a romantic story. Two men love the same woman. She loves them both. The ending is a bit of a surprise and you want to cry for the loser all the while understanding why he gave her up.<br /><br />This film is all of these things and none of them. It merely is.<br /><br />It takes place in the North African town of Casablanca which has been flooded by refuges from the German onslaught. Bogart plays Rick, the owner of a saloon who does very well for himself. The town is controlled by Vichy French and the prefect of police is a lovable cad played by Claude Raines. Two refugees, one an escapee from a concentration camp, come to Rick's trying to procure an exit visa that will allow them to escape to safety. The Nazis don't want them to have it. One of the refugees is Ilse, played beautifully by Ingrid Bergman. She was Rick's lover in Paris until that city fell to the Germans. They were going to go away together and then she disappeared, only to turn up married to the other refugee, a famous critic of the Nazis, Tensions are high all around emotions are running even stronger. Someone has to lose.<br /><br />This DVD edition has plenty of special features for fans. There are some outtakes and deleted scenes from the original movie and plenty of interviews as well as commentaries. Don't buy it for these, however. By it for the glory that is CASABLANCA.</p></br><a href="../users/A2P49WD75WHAG5.html">A2P49WD75WHAG5</a><br/><p>Welcome to Casablanca, in French Morocco.  The year, 1942, with the Third Reich at its height in World War II.  But the multi-themed, multilayered movie of the same name, based on a Murray Burnett play originally titled "Everybody Comes To Rick's," well, is the story of people searching for hope in a hopeless world, with mixes of intrigue, danger, the eternal triangle, the rebirth of one's soul emerging out of the chasm of cynicism, and fighting for a broader cause rather than looking out for number one.<p>Amid the teeming masses of those who wait and wait and wait and wait to get their exit visa signed by French police prefect Louis Renault, a corrupt official with a charming air, many of them will go to Rick's Cafe Americain, where there's gambling, dodgy deals, and even an arrest that makes for an exciting evening.  The owner, Rick (Richard Blaine), is an American expatriot who is completely neutral about everything, which is an asset for both the Vichy French and the Nazis.  "I stick my neck out for nobody" he tells Renault, who replies "A wise foreign policy."  However, it's Ferrari, the rotund owner of the Blue Parrot who tells Rick that "isolation is no longer a practical policy."  Renault too shares Rick's isolationist view by telling Major Strasser, a visiting German officer, that he blows with the wind, and "the prevailing wind is from Vichy."  He's just a bureaucrat doing his job, with lots of perks.<p>Enter, or in Rick's case, reenter, Ilsa Lund, with whom he had a whirlwind romance in Paris and with whom he was set to flee before the Gestapo got to him.  Alas, there came "the wild finish-a guy on a station platform in the rain with a comical look on his face because his insides have been kicked out."  Ilsa is here with her husband Victor Laszlo, a Czech resistance leader and key figure trying to unify opposition to the Third Reich.  Ilsa wants to explain about that last day, but seeing what Rick has become has left her disheartened with him.  And Renault is interested in keeping Laszlo in Casablanca, but also in getting some transit papers the black marketeer Ugatti passed on to Rick before his arrest.  Despite Rick's neutrality, he suspects "that under that cynical shell, you're at heart a sentimentalist."  that becomes true when Rick's old wounds are opened, seen all too poignantly when he places his hands in his head.<p>Casablanca is also a place where "human life is a commodity," where the worst elements of humanity cluster, trying to exploit those less fortunate. This is underscored by Ferrari, who swats flies at his place, demonstrating the value of human life in Casablanca.  Casablanca is also a place where the Nazis have outlawed miracles.  However, as things turn out, miracles do not come in the divine sense of the word.  Rather, it is people who become miracles by their actions and convictions of their heart.<p>There are many other characters here apart from Ferrari.  There's the pickpocket, Carl, Rick's waiter and accountant, Sasha, the Russian barkeep, and a Bulgarian couple hoping for their chance at freedom.<p>Although Ilsa's the one that's reawakened Rick's humanity, I'd argue that it's the young Bulgarian girl hoping to get out of Casablanca with her husband and approaches Rick who actually sets him on the road to losing his cynicism.  She asks him "If someone loved you very much that your happiness was the only thing she wanted in the world and she did a bad thing to make certain of it, could you forgive her?...and he never knew, and the girl kept this bad thing locked in her heart.  That would be all right, wouldn't it?"  That brings into mind the flashback seen, with Rick and Ilsa the epitomy of a couple in the throes of romance, and it's quite a shock to see why he's the cynic that he is.  <p>Parts of this movie have been used in other films.  Bogie's speech to Bergman at the ending of Casablanca has been cannibalized by Woody Allen in Play It Again Sam and in the Red Dwarf story Camille, in a very bizarre way.  But the most effective tribute has been the hit BBC series As Time Goes By, taken from the immortal song from Casablanca, with that as the theme song.<p>All the characters and actors are wonderful, with Bogie at his best, Ingrid Bergman at her loveliest, Claude Rains at his most dapper as Renault, and Sydney Greenstreet pulling in another hammy role as Ferrari.  And this was one of Conrad Veidt's (Strasser) last roles, as he died of a heart attack a year later.  This would have been a totally different movie had Ronald Reagan, Dennis Morgan, and Anne Sheridan played Rick, Victor, and Ilsa.<p>I've seen this many times and enjoyed it more everytime.  What do I do when I'm in the mood for this?  Yes, you guessed it...play it again.</p></br><a href="../users/A33L7G4E8CID3.html">A33L7G4E8CID3</a><br/><p>One of the most famous movies of all time, and one of the best, Casablanca is set during WWII, in neutral Morocco.

Ilsa doesn't know that the "saloon-keeper" who runs the cafe is Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart), the one true love of her life whose heart she broke.  When the two meet again sparks fly, and memories of an enchanted time in Paris come flooding back.  So when Ilsa offers herself in exchange for Laszlo's safe transport out of the country, the bitter Rick must decide what's more important: his own happiness or the lives that hang in the balance.<br /><br />This movie is famous, among other things, for the song "As Time Goes By" played by Rick's piano player Sam (Dooley Wilson) and first encountered by the lovers Ilsa and Rick.  Ilsa when she enters Rick's caf&eacute; asks Sam the following:<br /><br />"Play it once, Sam...Play it Sam.  Play `As Time Goes By'...Sing it Sam.  (The line "Play it again, Sam" never appears in the movie.)  Here are some of the lyrics:<br /><br />"You must remember this, a kiss is just a kiss, a sigh is just a sigh, the fundamental things apply, as time goes by.  And when two lovers woo, they still say I love you, on that you can rely, no matter what the future brings, as time goes by."<br /><br />The dialogue uttered by all the actors, especially by Humphrey Bogart is unforgettable.  Here are four of my favorite Bogey lines:<br /><br />(1) "Here's looking at you, kid."<br /><br />(2) "Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she walks into mine."<br /><br />(3) "I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship."<br /><br />(4) Rick is asked by an official what his nationality is.  Rick's reply: "I'm a drunkard."<br /><br />The acting is phenomenal especially by Bogart and Bergman.  Special mention should also go to Clause Rains as the Captain.<br /><br />The photography and cinematography are also well done and enhances each scene.<br /><br />Finally, this DVD (the one by Warner Studios, released in June 2005) is practically perfect in picture and sound quality.  It has three extras: (1) a documentary hosted by Bogart's widow Lauren Bacall (35 min) (2) original theatrical trailer (3) other theatrical trailers of famous Bogart movies.  I found all these extras interesting.<br /><br />In conclusion, this movie has it all: good background music, great dialogue, an interesting story, good acting, and interesting cinematography.  Be sure to see it and discover why it was voted by the American Film Institute the second best movie of all time and why it won three Academy Awards (including Best Picture)!!!<br /><br />(1942;  105 min;  black and white;  36 scenes;  full screen)<br /><br />+++++</p></br><a href="../users/AD9WTAOAFUZA4.html">AD9WTAOAFUZA4</a><br/><p>In a word - magnificent.  A towering accomplishment rarely visualized before or since, and easily one of the best films of all time.  There are insufficent adjectives to apply to Bogart in the role of Rick, and even fewer ways to describe the incandescent, glowing Ingrid Bergman, in what is perhaps her signature performance.

Casablanca I've found that there's lots of people who love the film and will defend it if need be, which is great because it'd be funny if someone wanted to defend let's say, From Justin to Kelly.<br /><br />Rick Blaine owns a bar in a town called Casablanca in the 1940's.  He doesn't really talk to people or share drinks and he barely pays attention to his girlfriend.  Casablanca is under French Vishy control and there's Nazis crawling all over. 2 couriers are killed and papers signed by Charles de Gaulle are stolen. In these papers, whoever signs their name is allowed safe passage out of Casablanca so naturally everyone wants them.<br /><br />All is fine until Victor Laszlo and his wife Ilsa Lund have stopped in the bar. Victor is a kind of a hero fighting the Nazis. His wife however knows Rick personally. They were once lovers in Paris before German troops came in and they split up, leaving him heartbroken on the train platform. So naturally he's upset, like he says: "of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the places of the world she had to walk into mine". And so we're dealing with 2 characters who are conflicted and have to deal with their past and also who gets the papers, which Rick actually controls.<br /><br />A film I think becomes a classic when it almost seems to transcend it's medium, where it's quoted or referenced. Infamous lines in cinema like "hasta la vista baby", "here's looking at you kid", "we all get a little mad sometimes" and music themes like Jaws and Star Wars almost become part of pop culture. Casablanca has quite a few of these with the here's looking at you kid, of all the gin joints..., beautiful friendship and play it again Sam becoming well known quotes in cinema history.<br /><br />Not to mention it's a good film too. There's not a lot of actors/actresses who can tell you so much just by a look. There's a scene where Rick finds out that Ilsa is in his bar. You don't know their history yet just their looks tell you all you need to know. There's some missteps however. There's a scene where Paul Henreid(Laszlo) has a conversation with Rick(Bogart) near the end. Bogart has a long look and almost like assessing this guy and figuring him out. But Henreid just stares blankly almost like he's remembering the lines in his head and it's throughout the film too, he's almost wooden in a way.<br /><br />But, if you ever feel the need to just watch a good film, can't go wrong with this one.</p></br><a href="../users/A26BWRBPP4V2WF.html">A26BWRBPP4V2WF</a><br/><p>These special releases of classic films are fantastic DVD editions.  It's so nice to see these films in all their retouched glory - no more struggling through the grainy VHS transfers, no more distorted sound, etc.  The Casablanca DVD does not disappoint.  In addition to its fine physical reproduction, it is certainly one of the best films ever made.<br /><br />The story (for the few that don't know) - Ilsa and Rick are lovers in Paris at the time of the Nazi Occupation.  They make plans to flee to Morocco, but Ilsa stands Rick up and he has to leave without her.  A year or two later, she finally makes it to Casablanca with a man in tow - her husband Victor, who happens to be an anti-Nazi Czech leader.  This sets up intrigue between the French resistance trying to get Victor away from the Nazis, the Nazis who are trying to imprison him, and the black marketeers who buy and sell exit visas.  Throw in the Rick-Ilsa-Victor love triangle, corrupt Vichy officials, and a healthy dose of humour, and you have a movie that stands the test of time and is more enjoyable each successive viewing.<br /><br />The performances, story, etc. are fantastic.  If the special effects are laughable (and they are!), you don't even notice because you're drawn in and engaged in the story.  The ending is a masterful series of twists, but it never cheats and once you've seen it, it is extremely satisfying but not predictable.<br /><br />Unfortunately, younger viewers are bound to think that the entire film is cliched (as I did, the first time I saw it).  It has been so often imitated that it's unlikely you'll see this before some imitation.  This is especially true of the dialogue - young viewers may even laugh at the cliched lines, not knowing that it was in Casablanca that they all originated: "the usual suspects," "of all the gin joints...," "I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship," etc.  Repeated viewings and the most rudimentary knowledge of cimematic history dispells this problem because the film is so much richer than just its most memorable quotes.<br /><br />This DVD edition has some nifty extras - about 3 hours of Lauren Bacall's reminiscences on hubby Bogart, interviews with film historians, archival footage, etc.  The two commentaries are interesting - one by film historian Rudy Behlmer and the other by critic Roger Ebert.  Ebert's commentary is probably more interesting in that he offers a number of personal opinions (for example, he observes that Henried and Bergman have no chemistry between them, and speculates that Claude Rains's character is meant to be homosexual).  They even found some cut scenes to include.  It's good value for the price, even if you only watch the extras once.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HJZ2KN9YA9L2.html">A2HJZ2KN9YA9L2</a><br/><p>In this movie, an American expatriot who was once a gunrunner, had an intense affair with a mysterious woman, and now runs a highly successful bar in Casablanca, comes into possession of letters of transit.  At about  the same time, the mysterious woman turns up with her husband, a  significant figure in the fight against the Nazis, who is in desperate need  of those letters of transit in order to make a quick getaway.  From this  wildly improbable plot stems quite possibly the greatest movie of all time.  The pacing is brisk, dialogue &amp; performances perfect, cinematography  phenomenal.  When a person watches it, the unlikelyhood of it all fades  away &amp; suspension of disbelief is instantaneous, because everyone  involved knew how to make a good movie.  Personal favorite lines of  dialogue: &quot;Why, Rick, how extravagant of you throwing away women like  that.  Someday they may be scarce.&quot;;  &quot;Tomorrow I will be in here  with a breathtaking blonde, and it will make me very happy if she  loses.&quot;; &quot;I am shocked! Shocked to find that gambling is going on  in here!&quot;<p>The DVD features pretty much the same extras as the  Aniiversary Edition VHS, which is a shame.  It would be nice to have a  commentary by a film historian.</p></br><a href="../users/A1I7GHG2XNYO3J.html">A1I7GHG2XNYO3J</a><br/><p>While the Maltese Falcon has always been my favorite Bogie film, Casablanca is all its said to be and more.

In America, they'd bring only a penny.<br /><br />I can only put it like this:<br /><br />The Good:<br /><br />1. The quality of the film transfer on this edition is excellent and a real pleasure to watch. The shadows, shading and the attention to detail of the enhancement from the previous versions, is stunning.<br /><br />2. This movie has more memorable scenes than probably your own wedding ceremony. Also, this is probably the most quotable movie ever made and one of the greatest.<br /><br />3. The sound is pretty even throughout, there's no drop-out's or places where it comes across to thin.<br /><br />4. The extras on disc 2 are interesting and enough to give first-time viewers a better understanding.<br /><br />5. A really fantastic film for any age, first-timers or repeat offenders. I watch this movie every Sunday, and have done so for about the last 10 years. We look forward to it over here and never tire of it.<br /><br />6. Humphrey Bogart is absolutely magnificent and unforgettable as Richard 'Rick' Blaine, but Claude Rains does have all the best lines.<br /><br />The Bad:<br /><br />1. Roger Ebert's commentary on this is dry, dull and sounds as if he's reading from an essay, rather than speaking about the film candidly as it progresses. I can read this same information on the internet or in a multitude of books, with greater insight. I would've preferred a commentary track from Lauren Bacall over this anytime.<br /><br />2. This sound is only offered in PCM 2.0 and could've been presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 had they wished to invest the time and money. Maybe they will remaster it on the Blu-Ray version when it's released.<br /><br />3. Ingrid Bergman's line "Captain, the boy who is playing the piano, somewhere I have seen him ..." still bothers a lot of people, and even driven some away, which is too bad. It's a shame that during a period of great inhumanity, a little more humanity couldn't have been more equally distributed. Ingrid Bergman should've have been more aware ... but who's to say?</p></br><a href="../users/A2PXHFGJZBNLXB.html">A2PXHFGJZBNLXB</a><br/><p>Obviously there is a lot of hype about this old movie, calling it &quot;one of the greatest films ever made&quot; and all that. My opinion on the hype is this: there are plenty of films out there that have more psychological insight into its characters and explore deeper themes than CASABLANCA does. Despite the fact that it uses a wartime setting and has a cast of various nationalities, it merely uses these elements as a backdrop to a Hollywood-style romantic melodrama. The whole thing is basically safe old-style Hollywood entertainment, but that's really all it is. Nothing more, nothing less. (CASABLANCA is a film that would probably appeal more to older people who feel nostalgia for the &quot;golden age&quot; of Hollywood than to us progressive younger folk.) To call this film &quot;one of the best films of the cinema ever&quot; would be a gross overstatement of its quality, in my opinion. To me, CASABLANCA is hardly that, and I would not rate this high on my own personal list of the greatest films I've ever seen.<br /><br /> The reason I give this movie five stars, though, is that, as old-style Hollywood entertainment, it is pretty glorious. Here is a romantic melodrama that actually had me interested in its characters and situations from roughly beginning to end. The screenwriters and director Michael Curtiz never make the central romantic tensions overblown in any way (something that GONE WITH THE WIND did, to its detriment I think). It all remains nicely down-to-earth, and the actors help make it convincing and fun to watch, especially Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman in the lead roles. Bogart, especially, does a good job with bringing out the sides of his character Rick Blaine, a man who outwardly shows cynicism and indifference, but deep inside still has feelings for Ilsa Lund and really does want to help her and her husband escape the country. (His final sacrificial act at the end of CASABLANCA is one of the most sublime things Hollywood has ever dreamed up.) And of course no discussion of this movie could dare to skip over the now-classic dialogue of this movie, which remains nicely edgy and flavored. (I particularly liked Rick's response to the officer who asks about his nationality, as well as his &quot;I stick my head out for nobody&quot; philosophy.) All in all, here is a romantic movie that never gets soapy, and its honesty of feeling is something to be truly admired.<br /><br /> CASABLANCA remains, to this day, an example of Hollywood entertainment at its skillful best. It doesn't have ambitions to be anything other than diverting, and on that level it succeeds magnificently. Just don't come into the movie expecting &quot;the greatest movie you'll ever see.&quot; Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A3MV1KKHX51FYT.html">A3MV1KKHX51FYT</a><br/><p>The story is set in Casablanca after the fall of France. Refugees crowd the city, waiting to flee abroad. Rick, an American expatriate, runs a caf&eacute; (with gambling in a backroom). This operation is protected by the local Chief of Police. The first funny scene is where Victor Laszlo, wanted by the Gestapo, appears under his own name! Then he is introduced to the Nazi chief! All so polite (can you believe it?) Rick is said to be on the blacklist, with a price on his head. How did he not just escape, but wind up with a caf&eacute;? I suggest Rick made a deal with the authorities, and works as a high-grade informer. Its not an accident that Yugartes is arrested after he shows up at Rick's and confesses. Rick has knocked around way too much to be so sentimental in Paris. The question is whether the Laszlos will be able to escape to Lisbon, and then to America, with the transit papers. Those German soldiers sing "Wacht am Rhein", a 19th century nationalist song. "Watch on the Rhine" was a stage play and a later film.<br /><br />Conrad Veidt portrays the top Nazi with ominous overtones and underplayed evil. Rick shows sentimentality with the Bulgarian couple; was this just a whim or some sort of pay-off to explain a large sum of money? Victor Laszlo escapes from an underground meeting. Wouldn't he be under constant surveillance? There is a surprise ending. Rick double-crosses Louis to let Victor and Ilsa leave. The foggy night creates atmosphere (is fog possible in the desert?). Major Strosser arrives, but somehow lacks his usual retinue and pays dearly for his mistake. [Believable? It echoes the fate of Heydrich.] The real scandal is not that Rick and Louis run off together to join the Free French. It is that nobody escaped from the concentration camps of the Gestapo unless they were turned into double agents. This suggests Victor is now a Nazi agent (read some of the post WW 2 books)! The efficient British counter-intelligence would soon deal with him. Or could Rick really be a triple agent, who uses Louis' affection to escape to Allied territory after effecting the escape of Victor and Ilsa?<br /><br />The charm of this film seems to be its classic restraint and understatement with its stilted language. It has unity of time, place, and action. The film is fast-paced and tightly edited. The Hollywood Production Code supported the happy ending where Victor and Ilsa's marriage continued after their hardships. The cleverness of this film is how it layers sentimentality over a rude reality, like some old-fashioned fairy tale that has different meanings for children and for adults I think the happiness of the performers shows in their stage presence. Many were refugees from Nazi Europe. This makes it a better film than "Citizen Kane" and its cynical performers. One flaw is the story of exit visas which cannot be canceled; no government would do that. 'Force majeure' trumps a piece of paper.<br /><br />[The book "Round Up the Usual Suspects" tells about the making of this film, whose story transcended the usual money-making entertainment.]</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>Casablanca is a good film but not a masterpiece. The story is bit boring but the love triangle is the best part of the film. Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman had incredible chemistry together, they are magic on-screen. This little black & white film noir is a classic but expext some flaws. Take it or leave it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RH7ARWQSUVQV.html">A2RH7ARWQSUVQV</a><br/><p>It seems I have received a number of negative reviews on my interpretation of this film which is somewhat baffling to me.  In fact I think 'Casablanca' is an excellent film but think its quality--and the quality is indeed superb--is largely a product of editing rather than initial planning.  Surely the actors didn't think that they were involved in anything 'special'.  They thought it was just another studio film being cranked out like tanks or aircraft during WWII.<br /><br />This film was, I believe, released in 1945. Therefore, it is, in some ways, a fairly standard propaganda flick [and there were hundreds of them during the War] saved by the presence of Ingrid Bergman, in all her youthful beauty, and the brooding 'Rick' [Humphrey Bogart].  Bergman's beauty is a thing to behold and Bogart's agony is correspondingly miserable.<br /><br />Rick's 'Club Americain' is in Vichy-French controlled Casa Blanca.  It is also a hot bed for intrigue and desperate people trying to escape Nazi occupied Europe. Rick, who is a successful restrauteur, has settled into an alcoholic haze following his baffling abandonment by the haunting Bergman in Paris a couple of years earlier.  Much to Rick's chagrin and surprise, Bergman shows up unexpectedly--along with her husband--in his North African night club.  Rick immediately sinks into a desperate, alcohol enhanced grief as he waits for Bergman to return and explain herself.  Rick's despair is truly a thing to behold and is why Bogart deserves to be rated as one of the truly great actors.<br /><br />Paul Henreid, as Bergman's cuckolded husband, is just too noble for words and the Nazis are appropriately unidimensional and evil.  The cynical Vichy French Inspector is indeed perfect as a man who ultimately finds where his loyalties...and soul...lies.  "Arrest the usual suspects," he orders, as Bogart, walking away with him in the fog tells him, "I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship."  Excellent stuff, really.<br /><br />Ron Braithwaite author of novels--"Skull Rack" and "Hummingbird God"--on the Conquest of Mexico</p></br><a href="../users/A3SFO2GSP5CVSM.html">A3SFO2GSP5CVSM</a><br/><p>First, let's go with the performances of some of the leading<br />characters, and let me start by stating that most of the<br />characterizations of the acting abilities of the actors in this film,<br />by critics, are often quite wrongheaded. Let us start with the three<br />top billed actors, Humphrey Bogart as club owner Rick Blaine, Ingrid<br />Bergman as his ex-lover Ilsa Lund, and Paul Henreid as Ilsa's husband,<br />the Czechoslovakian Nazi Resistance outlaw, Victor Laszlo. Virtually<br />all critiques of this trio leave Henreid as the odd man out, mainly<br />because the film focuses on the love angle between Rick and Ilsa. But,<br />from a purely technical standpoint, Henreid gives, by far, the best<br />acting performance of the trio (and, it's not even close). Because it<br />is the most restrained and understated, however, it usually gets<br />dismissed as stiff acting, rather than good acting of an intentionally<br />stiff character....one need only look at the cheesy scene in the bar, where Victor hears the Nazis singing their song, Die Wacht Am Rhein, and dares to get the band to play La Marseillaise, then look in Victor's eyes, to see that, far from what critics claim, Victor is a man of great passion and principles from the get go, and this break from his usual restraint gains in power<br />precisely because it is a break, but one that seems wholly natural for<br />a man who has been frustrated for the bulk of his scenes in the film,<br />and then feels he is having his face rubbed in it. While the political<br />implications of the scene have lost their resonance (as do most<br />blatantly political gestures in art), Henreid's volcanically restrained<br />performance in that scene has not. And, as an asides, compare that<br />scene with a similar scene toward the ends of the aforementioned Paths<br />Of Glory, where a captured German girl is put on stage, in front of<br />drunken French soldiers seemingly willing to ravage her, until she<br />starts singing a plaintive German tune of a soldier and his lost love.<br />The drunk soldiers quiet down, and eventually start humming along with<br />the 'enemy,' and slowly show that they have not been totally inured by<br />carnage. A comparison of these two scenes (their structure and<br />placement) neatly and clearly shows why Casablanca is mere<br />entertainment, while Paths Of Glory is great art. Simply stated,<br />without the character (in his physical being and internal composition)<br />of Victor Laszlo, Casablanca does not even reach being a good prose<br />melodrama.<br /><br />Now, contrast Henreid's Victor with Bogart's Rick. Rick is rather one<br />dimensional, despite the film's early evocations of depth. His<br />attraction to Ilsa seems quite superficial; after all, in the flashback<br />scenes in Paris, and even those in Casablanca, does he ever speak of<br />higher purpose? Despite some wittier lines....is Rick Blaine sufficiently different from the Sam Spade Bogart essayed in The Maltese Falcon, or any of the rather stolid thugs he played throughout the 1930s? No.<br /><br />That brings me to the last and least of the trio of star performances:<br />Ingrid Bergman's rather mediocre portrayal of Ilsa Lund. First, it's<br />not a bad performance, but it's nowhere near great. One need only look<br />at contemporaneous performances by a Katherine Hepburn, Joan Crawford,<br />Bette Davis, or even Judy Garland, to see how much Bergman pales in<br />contrast. And, it's rather apparent that Ilsa really loves Victor, not<br />Rick, because anyone who's ever really been in love knows that she<br />would have stayed with Rick, no matter.<br /><br />But the biggest thing that prevents the film from greatness is that it<br />simply plumbs no depths, it simply has no great themes. There is<br />nothing in the film that is so overwhelmingly great, technically or<br />performance-wise, that can put it in a class with many of the other<br />highly praised great films of the past. Seen next to Citizen Kane,<br />Tokyo Story, Seven Samurai, La Dolce Vita, or 2001: A Space Odyssey,<br />Casablanca comes up short, way short.<br /><br />On the plus side, Casablanca is quite a modern film, in terms of pacing<br />(and in some aspects of editing), for within the first ten or twelve<br />minutes, you feel as if you know these archetypal characters (for good<br />or ill), as if you'd already had a full movie's worth of them under<br />your belt, and this is part of the reason why the film sucks you in to<br />its vortex, and gets better, subjectively, as it goes on, even if,<br />objectively, it's a fairly static film, in terms of plotting.<br /><br />Film critic Andrew Sarris claimed that Casablanca was, 'the most<br />decisive exception to the auteur theory,' but he was wrong, and wrong<br />for several reasons. First, auteur theory generally applies toward<br />films or filmmakers that are great, and while Casablanca has been<br />claimed as great, no one has ever made that claim for Curtiz. Secondly, greatness is part and parcel of a vision, and vision is, almost by definition, a property only a singular person can have, not a group; thus Sarris's very admission that Casablanca had more than one 'auteur' makes it also outside the scope of auteur theory, by definition, not an exception to the theory....the film lacks vision, and is a stylistic and narrative hodgepodge. Still, it does entertain, and is an interesting piece of Americana. Also, the lower the expectations you have of the film, the more entertaining it seems. Ah, the flicker of illusion!</p></br><a href="../users/A2W3HLHIA9UP4D.html">A2W3HLHIA9UP4D</a><br/><p>I held out for a very long time before watching this film for the first time. With all the hype that comes with this film, as well as many other "classic" films, such as "Citizen Kane", I was expecting a big let down. I'm from the younger generation, and a lot of these old movies made in the 40s, 50s, and 60s, just don't appeal to me most of the time. But I must say that this film wasn't that bad.

Of course, that great ending helps, too!  Studio filmmaking from the 1940's didn't come any better than this, and director Curtiz masterfully handled the action, comedy and romance.

Special mention should be made for actors like Peter Lorre, Sidney Greenstreet and Claude Rains who are excellent here just as they were in other film classics such as "The Maltese Falcon" and "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington". Although this is not Bogart's best performance (for that you'll need to see "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre"), he still puts in an excellent performance here.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this Blu-ray version is a mixed bag especially so for the sound quality which is only slightly better than the dvd release. The volume levels are very soft for some scenes so that you can scarcely hear the dialogue while for others the levels inexplicably increase.  Unlike the great work they did with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0020MMRC0">The Maltese Falcon [Blu-ray</a>] where they used DTS HD MA for the sound here they used just Dolby Digital which just didn't cut it and so overall is a disappointment and an opportunity lost in doing justice to a great film.<br /><br />After waiting so long for the Blu-Ray release it is an anti-climax that we get this mixed bag release with very good picture but poor sound quality albeit both are better than in the dvd release.</p></br><a href="../users/A11C43I615R52G.html">A11C43I615R52G</a><br/><p>I love Casablanca and is one of my all-time favorites. While many may label it as a romantic film, I think is something much more than that. Aside from the great performances of Bogart, Bergman, Henried, Reins and all the others, the film has a certain appeal that does not feel dated and makes you want to see it again and again.<br />It's one of those films that must be in any collection because it belongs to that rare class of films that can be called Masterpieces.<br /><br />I've been wanting to buy Casablanca on DVD (I don't have a Blu-Ray player) but the ultimate collector's edition was very expensive as was the 2003 2-disc DVD (which is repackaged in the UCE with a documentary about Jack Warner). Then, Warner reissue that DVD in a  cheaper box and just cost $9,99!!! It was a bargain for a great film. This 2009 DVD is the same as the 2003. The picture is crisp, clear and perfect. No artifacts and only some minor (really minor) grain in some scenes. The audio is crisp without background noises. The extras are excellent with audiocomentaries, documentaries, and more. A must own edition for a must own film.<br /><br />If you don't own Casablanca yet, right now is the best time. This 2009 edition is perfect and really cheap. Buy it now and you'll always have Paris.</p></br><a href="../users/AV5G37VFE5NVD.html">AV5G37VFE5NVD</a><br/><p>"Casablanca" - oh, "Casablanca."  What could one possibly say about "Casablanca" that has not been said a million times by a million people or more?  Let me ask this: have you seen "Casablanca"?  If you have not, my friend, this writing cannot convey the strength with which I recommend that you purchase - not rent, purchase - this film immediately.  And if, for some reason, you should ask me why, I will tell you that "Casablanca" belongs in every person's cinematic library, because it is quite possibly the finest film ever released.<br /><br />The word "classic" applies to no film, NO FILM, not "Citizen Kane," not "The Godfather," none of these, so much as it applies to "Casablanca."  Every last scene is classic.  Every line is classic.  Everything about it is classic, not because it's an old film, but because it IS film.  "Casablanca" is the very embodiment of why movies are made, and it has all the elements of impeccable filmmaking.  You have a situation with which the audience can sympathize: a man's world is turned upside down when his long-lost love walks into his saloon.  The man is a classic example of the "tragic hero" who was so popular in 1940s and 50s cinema, particularly film noir: on the outside, he's a cynical, cold, wisecracking individual, but inside he's a kindhearted, courageous human being who can't help but do what's right.  That's why, when we discover that the object of his desire has a new man and loves him, we know that she should go off and live happily ever after with him, but we still root for her to wind up with our tragic hero.<br /><br />And no one plays the tragic hero like Humphrey Bogart.  One year earlier he'd delivered a knockout performance as just such a character in John Huston's "The Maltese Falcon," and two years later he'd play an identical character in Howard Hawks' "The Big Sleep" with future wife Lauren Bacall, but no one'll argue that Bogey never surpassed his performance as Rick in "Casablanca."  There's something about Humphrey Bogart that remains unexplained to this day, something that made him so powerful a leading man.  Perhaps it was his effortless cool, or total confidence, or his sour tongue, or maybe just that twinkle in his eyes.  Whatever it was, there has never been a leading man quite so charismatic as Bogart in "Casablanca."<br /><br />But a leading man is nothing without a leading lady, and so we have Ingrid Bergman, one of the screen's most dazzling beauties.  She was at her most dazzling in "Casablanca," another tragic character whose actions are as heartbreaking to the audience as they are to Rick, but in the end they're understandable and we sympathize.  Despite their charm, so many classic leading ladies just let the drama flow in their performances.  But not Bergman.  She put every fiber of her being into her performance, and she breathes so much humanity into the character of Ilse that we can't help but forgive her and sympathize.<br /><br />Equally important is the supporting cast.  It's amazing how vibrant each of the characters are, no matter how small or large their roles.  Claude Rains' character is particularly interesting: he walks the line between the good guys and the bad guys throughout the picture, sometimes swaying to one side and sometimes to the other, but we're never quite sure who's side he's on until the climax.  Rick's employees are just as charming as their boss, among them pianist Sam, played by Dooly Wilson, goodhearted waiter Carl (S.Z. Sakall), and wirey bartender Sascha (Leonid Kinskey).  Sydney Greenstreet, who also appeared with Bogart in "The Maltese Falcon," plays Rick's rival, Ferrari, described by Rick as "a fat hypocrite."  Conrad Veidt is the real villain of the picture, Nazi Major Strasser, and last but not least, Peter Lorre is the thug who sets the wheels in motion.<br /><br />So much of "Casablanca"'s appeal lies in its story and characters.  The story is timeless, romantic, and, of course, dramatic.  The setting is a character unto itself, a mangy hellhole stuck somewhere in the middle of the war, which so far has remained safe from enemy troops, but the promise of occupation grows stronger each day.  The grimness of the war is a powerful backdrop for Rick and Ilsa's love, the shining light through all the darkness.  In Darren Aronofsky's recent film "The Fountain," a character philosophizes, "Every shadow is threatened by the morning light."  That philosophy was cemented in "Casablanca," where good triumphs evil, and it will always triumph so long as people are willing to fight.  The film says that there is goodness in us all; some are destined to see this, and others are not.  In one scene, Rick asks a hero of the resistance, "Don't you sometimes wonder if it's worth all this?  I mean what you're fighting for."<br /><br />The resistance fighter replies, "You might as well question why we breathe.  If we stop breathing, we'll die.  If we stop fighting our enemies, the world will die."<br /><br />Of course, Bogey cracks, "Well, what of it?  It'll be out of its misery."<br /><br />But the resistance man, the movie's "stalwart hero," knows better.  "You know how you sound, Mr. Blaine?" he asks.  "Like a man who's trying to convince himself of something he doesn't believe in his heart."<br /><br />Heart is something this film has no shortage of - that and humanity.  "Casablanca" is as 'human' as film as ever there was.  And though lifelike characters have become a staple of modern dramatic cinema, so many characters in older films felt like just that: characters in a movie, which wasn't necessarily a bad thing for those films.  But the characters in "Casablanca" have a remarkably deep, realistic feel to them.  They each have a story to tell, a life of their own, human feelings, human desires.  Most importantly, they each have the urge to do good in the end, no matter their position in the world.<br /><br />The actual techniques employed in the film are resistant to any criticism whatsoever.  The songs composed for the movie, greats like "It Had to Be You" and, in particular, the (ironically) timeless "As Time Goes By," add so much emotion to the film.  The flashback sequence was possibly the first to ever figure prominently in a major motion picture, and it's one of the most strong and memorable scenes in the movie.  The editing is flawless - tight, concise, steady-paced, exactly what it should be.  Finally, the photography is beautiful.  Every shot is like a painting, a moment to be treasured forever and ever were it not instantly replaced by the next wonderful frame.<br /><br />In all these many, many years since the release of "Casablanca," it hasn't lost any of its power; in fact, as time goes by, the movie may actually become more powerful.  Certainly, no film has ever been more powerful than this, and none have ever been so bittersweetly perfect.  This is the crown jewel of artistic achievement.  This is why we have movies.  This is film.  This is life.  Whether it's the greatest film in history will always be the subject of much debate, but no sane person will deny that "Casablanca" is among the absolute finest masterworks of cinema.  "We'll always have Paris," Rick tells Ilsa in one of the film's signature scenes.  Until the end of time, cinema lovers will always have and treasure "Casablanca."</p></br><a href="../users/A36QYTMMJ0O2IZ.html">A36QYTMMJ0O2IZ</a><br/><p>Many have tried to remake or duplicate Casablanca.  None have succeeded.  It's not hard to understand why either.  How can you remake one of, if not arguably, the best motion picture film of all time?  The answer is simple: you can't.<br /><br />One of the enigmas that makes this film such an incredible feat, is that throughout most of its production, the story wasn't finished.  They had no idea how it was going to end.  Does Ilsa stay with Rick?  Does she go with Lazlo?  And yet, they obviously found a way to tie the whole story together.<br /><br />I simply cannot think of anyone else to play the part of Rick Blaine, or Ingrid Bergman as Ilsa,  or Claude Rains as Capt. Renault.<br /><br />Eveyone knows the story of Rick Blaine, an embittered saloon keeper who never understood why the love of his life, Ilsa Lund, left him high and dry in Paris just before the German invasion.  He's found his entire idealistic world has been turned upside down.  He claims to care about no one and nothing.  "I stick my neck out for nobody!"  We quickly find out that those feelings of love and fighting for justice have never left, but have simply been buried beneath anger and feelings of mistrust.  Is this ever more apparent during one of the film's most touching scenes, when Rick saves the virtue of the young Bulgarian wife who feels their only chance at leaving Casablanca may be for her to sleep with Capt. Renault in order to secure a visa.  Rick's entire staff goes nuts at this beautiful gesture, which Rick dismisses as a simple gesture to love.<br /><br />It really is fun to watch this film for the first time to see how Rick helps Ilsa and Lazlo.  At first, we are led to believe that he's planning to be selfish and take Ilsa back.<br /><br />Humphrey Bogart is nothing short of magnificent.  He embodies one of the most memorable characters in film history.  We see him in the white coat and black bow tie, running his club with a simple coolness.  Bogart made the trenchcoat and hat a signature outfit as well, not only in Casablanca, but in such films as The Big Sleep and The Maltese Falcon.  He is one of my favorite actors of all time, and Casablanca is probably my favorite role, although it's very difficult to decide which is best out of all of his great portrayals.  Entertainment Weekly had him listed as the best actor of all time and the most entertaining.  It's difficult to argue against this.<br /><br />Ingrid Bergman.  MGM made the right move in negotiating for Ingrid, as she was under contract with David O Selznick.  No one else could have played the part of Ilsa.  Bergman is my favorite actress of all time.  She brings such passion and ease to her roles, and yet she plays Ilsa with a calm, cool sense until she realizes she can no longer deny her feelings for Rick.  She loves Lazlo too, which is obvious, but for different reasons.  Lazlo represents the figure battling for justice and a restoration of a broken world back to what it was.  He inspires Ilsa.  However, nobody has brought out a passion or resevoir of feelings from her than Rick.  We know that Lazlo is often occupied, as what he's fighting for is bigger than himself or even Ilsa.  Rick was once like Lazlo, but Rick devotes his feelings to Ilsa, something that she's never known before.  And ironcially, it is Rick who commits the most selfless act, the most loving act in the end.<br /><br />Claude Rains is one of my favorite character actors.  He's simply wonderful.  He can play any part you put in front of him.  He plays Captain Renault with charm and a man who tries in vain to be neutral, but it is obvious he isn't.  Just look at Renault during his talk with Major Strasser.  As Strasser points out that occupied French territories are "honey-combed with traitors." You catch a glimpse of Renault who is not happy with that remark.  You also catch a glimpse of this during the film's most powerful moment: when Lazlo asks Rick's band to play the Les Marseillaise to drown out Strasser and the Germans as they sing the anthem of the Third Reich. That moment in the film when Les Marseillaise is played is one of the most powerful in all of film history.  It still gives me goose bumps when it is played in the film.<br /><br />Casablanca is simply timeless.  This is, as Lauren Bacall states during the documentary feature, the true definition of a classic.  AFI rated Casablanca as the second best film of all time.  I, personally, put it at the top.  It is more compelling than Citizen Kane, in my opinion.  Everyone remembers Rick and you often find yourself visiting Rick's Cafe Americain over and over with repeated viewings, because you simply never get tired of watching Casablanca.  At least, I don't.</p></br><a href="../users/A3CFT5LHFCB46K.html">A3CFT5LHFCB46K</a><br/><p>"It's the stuff that dreams are made of"<p>Okay, so that's a quote from a different Bogart movie. But if one thinks about it, that applies to this movie as well. The casting in this movie is perfect. I mean could we think of anyone else better for the lead roles besides Bogie and Bergman? Had it been Ronald Reagan and Ann Sheridan, this movie would have been forgotten in a week (Not saying that they weren't good actors, just wrong for the parts).  <p>But there are many other elements that all work together and are what makes this movie so great. Perhaps it's the sharp, crackling dialogue. Maybe it is the impressive cinematography and set design. Michael Curtiz's direction or Max Steiner's music, perhaps? Maybe it is the colorful supporting characters played by the likes of Claude Rains, Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet. Or it could just be the countless memorable scenes (Your Pick. My favorite, apart from the ending, is the duel of the French anthem La Marseillaise and the Nazi song Die Wacht am Rhein), but none of which could have been possible without the elements described above.  <p>Although this is good quality DVD, I think a film on the level of excellence and popularity like Casablanca should get more respect than this. The film itself, for being nearly 6 decades old, looks great, although I did spot occasional scratches and grain. There were times, however, when I needed to turn up the sound volume, but it sounded  clear and was free of unwanted noise. <p>Extra wise is where this DVD comes apart though. There is the original trailer and several bonus trailers for other Bogart movies. The main highlight is an impressive 30 minute documentary called "You Must Remember This", hosted and narrated by Lauren Bacall. But here is where my complaints begin. Throughout the documentary are shown (According to the film cover) "Recently unearthed outtakes". However, such outtakes, if they are so important, are not shown as a separate feature but rather are on the documentary. Mostly, however, as a backdrop during the credits or while a certain scene is being discussed. These outtakes could be bloopers, test footage or even deleted scenes. Isn't that important enough to allow a separate extra itself (Perhaps with audio commentary or summary captions)? Also, there should have been some other extras, like  Production Notes or a booklet or perhaps a photo gallery or commentary from historians or film critics. Come on, if Armageddon can get a deluxe, 2-disc special edition from Criterion, than so should Casablanca.  <p>The DVD is worth buying just for the movie alone. But if you desire absolute perfect picture and sound quality or a lot of extras, wait for another edition, whenever that should come.</p></br></body></html>

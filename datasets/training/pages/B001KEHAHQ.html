One needs to remember this is a different Clouseau; Steve Martin was born to play the inept but efficient French inspector.  Peter Sellers was of course a marvelous Clouseau, but do yourself a favor.  Don't compare.  Martin is just as funny, and he's supported by a great cast and a humorous storyline.<br /><br />This time the pink panther jewel is set in a ring worn by bombastic soccer coach Jason Stratham (in an uncredited cameo), which he gives to his fiancee, pop star Beyonce Knowles.  Shortly thereafter Stratham is killed by a Chinese poison dart.  Snooty Kevin Kline (in Herbert Lom's role) sets Clouseau up so he can solve the case on the sly.  He assigns Jean Reno to be his partner and to snitch on Clouseau's activities too.  Reno, usually playing dead serious roles, is a hoot and the scene where he and Clouseau disguised as wallpaper have to prove they are really Knowles' backup dancers is priceless.  Emily Mortimer (so good in DEAR FRANKIE) plays love smitten Nicole, Clouseau's brainy assistant, and she is good too.  PINK PANTHER has tons of sight gags, some of which don't always work, but this movie is purely fun entertainment.</p></br><a href="../users/A9LAPV8XNKZVZ.html">A9LAPV8XNKZVZ</a><br/><p>The worst, most incomprehensible, accents in recent films. English, French and American in a single sentence. A couple of laughs, but no threat to Seller's work.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>This film is alright but nothing to rave about. Steve Martin plays the role of Clouseau very well. I loved his very convincing yet funny French accent. Kevin Kline was decent in the film but it's still hard to picture Kline in a comedy when he usually always does dramatic roles. Jean Reno who teams up with Martin for most of the film really makes the film enjoyable. Martin and Reno were a great comedic team. I can't even really complain about Beyonce on this even though I feel she should seriously stick to her singing career. They limited her role and it worked. She was a decent addition to the cast and remained much more as a small supporting role which I think worked out better for the overall film. I guess she can also add  this role to her resume for being featured in another detective/spy franchise (the other being Mike Myers' Austin Powers as Foxy Cleopatra).<br /><br />There is a funny moment in the casino segment of this film, which revolves around a cameo by Clive Owen even though the scene has nothing to do with the story of the film. And of course Steve Martin's memorable comedic scenes including the "Hamburger scene" and the "Did you just say" scenes.<br /><br />The problem many parents will have with this film is the number of adult jokes that seem to be in the film. I kept thinking to myself "What was this rated again?  Then I double check the disc cover and read PG and said to myself "well it sure had a lot of adult undertones" I haven't seen the original but I believe the original cut had a lot more of them then. I would have to say though the sexual undertones here are similar to movies like "Shrek" and things of that nature. While the parents see the joke one way, the little kids see it another way. If the original film had the over the top sexual content then I appreciate the director, Shawn Levy, for editing it out.<br /><br />Steve Martin made this movie. I don't think no one else could have played the roll like he did. Maybe Jim Carey, but he also is a bit of an over actor. Steve made it happen. The storyline is predictable and it's nothing to shout about. But to chase away long workday blues, then you can give "The Pink Panther" a watch, but if you are tempted to get your hands on the original series and see Clouseau work his magic (like I am) in his adventures by all means go right ahead.</p></br><a href="../users/A27P0MW8TE1JQP.html">A27P0MW8TE1JQP</a><br/><p>IN A DEACADE in which it is cool to hate the FRENCH, remaking THE PINK PANTHER seems a natural. What isn't natural is making the film without director BLAKE EDWARDS (Skin Deep, Sunset, Victor / Victoria) : Offensive stereotypes, less than PC plotlines and of course old Hollywood's even less PC treatment of the women's roles.<br /><br />What of replacing the Inspector himself? What about PETER SELLERS, the original Inspector Clouseau, how can you replace him, in spite of the Trail / the Curse / the Son of the PINK PANTHER having been completed after Seller's passing. Who can fill those shoes? STEVE MARTIN? Maybe. Martin IS a GENIUS of physical comedy; he can do a stupid French accent almost as well as Kevin Kline (what he's in this too, wow!) What about the Chief (Inspector Dreyfus)? Yep, Kline is Clouseau's nemesis and boss. And CATO, sorry, without Edwards to champion "all things un-PC" we lose Burt Kwouk's clever Asian "house-boy", who is replaced by Jean Reno (The Professional) as Clouseau's partner and a satisfying straight-man, Gendarme Gilbert Ponton. Reno, like CATO is instructed by Clouseau to hone his skills by hilariously attacking him whenever possible(this time in reverse).<br /><br />The Story (or lack thereof): After a televised murder of French National Soccer team head coach Yves Gluant (Jason Statham of Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels), where the famous Pink Panther diamond is stolen Clouseau is called in to "investigate." Chief Inspector Dreyfus has picked Clouseau because he is sure to distract the media & mess up the high profile case, so that Dreyfus, can solve the case himself and win France's highest award: "Ze Medal of `onor." Beyonc? Knowles is cast as a pop-singer (quite a stretch there) & girlfriend of the victim, also the femme fatal of the movie who everyone thinks "did it" except Inspector Clouseau: "LEAVE HER ALONE! CAN'T YOU ZEE SHE'S ZEXY?!?!" She sure is Inspector! The late Edwards would have approved. Another hottie Blake Edwards would have included had he made this one is Clouseau's secretary Nicole (Emily Mortimer) another excellent physical comedian. As displayed in her "too close for comfort" scenes with Clouseau. Although the character is another painfully clich?d stereotype, "the girl who is beautiful when see takes off her glasses."<br /><br />Steve Martin plays Clouseau as the late SELLERS (and the late DON ADAMS in GET SMART & the animated INSPECTOR GADGET) did before him: as a moron impressed with his own genius creating chaos and destruction wherever he goes, yet still managing to "solve" the case in the end.. Some good throwaway moments of the movie are scenes where you watch Clouseau struggle with English & etiquette. Like the new Star Wars movies, familiar tunes and visuals tie us to the original saga: the animated Pink Panther & Henry Mancini's immortal theme were both used this way to adequate effect. What isn't familiar about this remake is the absence of foreign-film-feel that Blake Edwards achieved so brilliantly throughout all of the original films. New PANTHER director SHAWN LEVY, who worked with MARTIN in CHEAPER BY THE DOZEN (1& 2), is no stranger to the scene crumbling chaos necessary to let Clouseau be himself. Here he comes through in the PINK, as in the previously mentioned works with another lightweight, moderately-family-friendly-fare (e.g. crude and suggestive humor, fart jokes and language.)<br /><br />This is a funny remake of the classic film series. If you are familiar with the originals it will make you want to put them on. If you're not familiar with the original PINK PANTHER series check them out. In addition to the Pink Panther, there is: SHOT in the DARK, The Revenge of the PINK PANTHER, The PINK PANTHER STRIKES AGAIN, (also filmed by Edwards, some with clips of the late Peter Sellers, some with filler-fools, but none quite as good as the first 5 films: "the TRAIL of the PINK PANTHER," "the CURSE of the PINK PANTHER," and "SON of the PINK PANTHER.") Go ahead and INSPECT them all!</p></br><a href="../users/A2EEUQ81DTY7G3.html">A2EEUQ81DTY7G3</a><br/><p>Viewers who are after a sophisticated plot would probably do well to look elsewhere, but for those of us who like their humor sometimes silly and absurd, The Pink Panther occasionally fits the bill. The movie isn't nearly as bad as you'd think and it certainly isn't as bad as the worst of the original Peter Sellers movies.<br /><br />This new updated version of the Pink Panther  - starring cameos by Jason Statham and Clive Owen and featuring a lovely performance by Emily Mortimer - is rather a vehicle for showing the comedic talents of Steve Martin who talks funny with his fake French accent as he assumes the role of the bumbling Inspector Clouseau made famous by Sellers.<br /><br />The story - or what there is of it - begins when Yves Gluant, (Statham) France's most famous soccer coach (and boyfriend of the beautiful pop star Xania (Beyonc&eacute; Knowles) is murdered in plain sight in front of a huge crowd after leading his team to victory against China. By the time anybody notices that Gluant is dead- the priceless Pink Panther diamond has disappeared from his finger.<br /><br />Enter Chief Inspector Dreyfus (Kevin Kline) turns to Clouseau (Martin) the least competent cop in France to help solve the mystery. Dreyfus hopes that the press will devote its attention to Clouseau, thus freeing him to solve the crime in a less pressured environment. Dreyfuss has also been nominated for the Medal of Honor for the seventh time and this time he plans to win it at any cost.<br /><br />Much of the movie is composed of sight gags, there are lots of people falling over and running into things and generally being stupid. Much of the witty repartee comes from the chemistry between Martin accident-prone Clouseau and the Martin as the snobbish and patronizing Dreyfuss. Both are extraordinarily vulnerable - Clouseau because of his hubris, pride and insecurity and Dreyfus chiefly because of Clouseau.<br /><br />Martin embeds Clouseau with a touch of the innocent and its this innocence that lends the love story between him and his secretary, Nicole (an adorable Emily Mortimer). But the best thing about the replica is how wholeheartedly Martin throws himself into the physical comedy, which is uniformly hilarious. Most of the laughs are pretty juvenile, aimed for ten year olds, with the only really funny jokes coming from a scene involving flatulence and Viagra.<br /><br />The best part of the film is when the opening titles kicks in with an animated sequence featuring a squat cartoon Clouseau and the slinky panther-playing cat and mouse to the strains of Henry Mancini's sublime burlesque theme. The rest of the film is very much direction by numbers.<br /><br />Even the best Pink Panther movies were never great cinema, just great fun; the scripts were vehicles for Sellers' genius, which combined lordly timing with a gift for absurd physical comedy. He was a buffoon, but he was a buffoon with dignity, Martin does a good job of carrying on the legacy, but one sort of wonders why the series needed to be remade in the first place.

You will literally have tears in your eyes during a scene which a speech coach tries to get him to say "I would like to buy a hamburger' Needless to say, he can't. Good family fun, Not great, but cute.</p></br><a href="../users/A2G6GO4O7EVCPF.html">A2G6GO4O7EVCPF</a><br/><p>Steve Martin (The Jerk, Roxanne) fills the shoes of Inspector Jacques Clouseau who is put on the case of the missing Pink Panther diamond which was stolen from a murdered coach named Yves Gluant, played by an uncredited Jason Statham (The Transporter 1 & 2, Snatch),  by Chief Inspector Dreyfus played by Kevin Kline (A Fish Called Wanda, In & Out) who wants him to fail the case. Clouseau gets a partner Gendarme Gilbert Ponton played by the awesome Jean Reno (The Professional, The Da Vinci Code) who accompanies Clouseau on his case. Pretty weak remake only has the hilarious & funny performance by Steve Martin who makes his role his own which is great with some funny moments and nice support from Jean Reno. Beyonce Knowles (Austin Powers 3, Fighting Temptations) is miscast in her role as Xania and it's so is Kevin Kline which is a bit of a disappointment. Martin trying to say Hamburger in that accent was hilarious as was the scene where he eats one. There's an awesome uncredited cameo by Clive Owen (Sin City, Closer) who plays Nigel Boswell/Agent 006. Also starring the lovely Emily Mortimer (Formula 51, Scream 3), Henry Czerny (Mission: Impossible, Cement), Kristin Chenoweth (RV, Bewitched) and Roger Rees (Game 6, Robin Hood: Men In Tights). It was a kick to also see Jean Reno dance. It was weird but memorable. Too bad for this one is all I have to say.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5.html">A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5</a><br/><p>I was pretty reluctant to view the new film because, I love the original series with Peter Sellers.  In my opinion, the first "Pink Panthers" are some of the funniest films ever made.<br /><br />While Steve Martin alone does not match Peter Sellers' comedic genius, Steve Martin and Kevin Kline make up a great duo.  They were several times when I lost myself laughing uproariously.  The film is worth viewing just for the two of them.<br /><br />The plot:  France's well-beloved soccer coach is killed just 3 weeks before the French Medal of Honor.  The chief Inspector of International Police (Kline) realizes he cannot take the case.  So he brings in Clousseau, thus depriving a remote French village of their idiot, and sets him on the case planning to take over at the last minute and solve the crime.  To his surprise and undoing, Clousseau stumbles into the solution.</p></br><a href="../users/A7Y6AVS576M03.html">A7Y6AVS576M03</a><br/><p>This is not a bad one, but a "good one" as Clouseau says several times in this film. It's not a remake of the original but a new story based on the theft once more of the famous Pink Panther diamond and murder of its last owner. One thing about this film is that it gives Steve Martin a chance to act rather than present a variation of his usual self up there on the screen. He does not try to copy Seller's interpretation of the role that he had long established but uses elements from Seller's and his own film experiences to create something new, different yet recognizable. Martin's performance, though strained at times, really comes through in the final third of the film and he shows us a bit of some witt lacking in Seller's performance. Martin's performance is closer to Arkin's in 1968's INSPECTOR CLOUSEAU. You actually have an amount of empathy for Martin and that seems so work and save this film. The titles are good behind the "Pink Panther" theme and the rest of the score even demonstrates some moving innovation at times. In all this is not a bad Pink Panther film. It's familiar but just a little different and updated for the times.</p></br><a href="../users/AW99SBGWEXP0J.html">AW99SBGWEXP0J</a><br/><p>The coach of the French national soccer team is murdered on the field after the game, and someone steals his ring.  The ring contains the Pink Panther diamond, a large and valuable pink diamond.  Chief Inspector Dreyfus (Kline) decides to put an idiot in charge of the investigation so he can swoop in and solve the crime and gain all the glory.  This idiot is Inspector Clouseau (Martin).  Of course, Clouseau may just be dumb enough to solve the case in spite of himself.<br /><br />This is a movie that probably did not need to be made.  The character of Inspector Clouseau is so entwined with Peter Sellers that anyone taking on the role has his work cut out for him.  Steve Martin is not up to the task, but he does not completely fail either.  He does an ok job filling his predacessor's shoe, and does bring some laughs.  Kevin Kline and Jean Reno are also OK in supporting roles.<br /><br />"The Pink Panther" will be enjoyed by many, but it sat on studio shelves for over a year before release, and that is not surprising.  This version has a lot to live up to, and I do not think it is successful overall.  Check this one out on DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/AWG2O9C42XW5G.html">AWG2O9C42XW5G</a><br/><p>this movie is hilarious from start to finish. steve martin is teriffic in this film. i love this movie.  if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do.</p></br><a href="../users/A2T7TZBOTP68C7.html">A2T7TZBOTP68C7</a><br/><p>Sacre Bleu, Steve Martin is not just funny in the remake of The Pink Panther - he is priceless.  This is mostly due to his outrageous French accent.  During the scene toward the end, where Clouseau is working with an American dialect coach to say, "I would like to buy a hamburger," I laughed so hard that I couldn't breathe and had a coughing fit.  My stomach ached, too.  Wow.  That's good stuff.<br /><br />How the mystery is solved at the end is dumb - I wish they had put more cleverness into the whodunnit aspect.  Some mystery lovers may feel insulted at the hastily slapped together resolution.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>Let's face it: certain roles are so inextricably entwined with the actors who made them famous that it becomes almost blasphemous to envision any other performer ever taking over the part.  Judy Garland as Dorothy, Clark Gable as Rhett Butler, Dustin Hoffman as Tootsie, Lucille Ball as Lucy Ricardo - these are just a few of the many characters one would find unimaginable in the hands of any other performer (just look what happened when Vince Vaughn tried to usurp the role of Norman Bates from Tony Perkins a few years back!).  High on that list would certainly be Inspector Clouseau, the bumbling, befuddled, utterly endearing character embodied by the divine Peter Sellars in no fewer than five films beginning with the first "Pink Panther" in 1963 (a film in which Clouseau actually played a relatively minor role).  But Hollywood is nothing if not consistent when it comes to seizing an opportunity to feed off its own legends to make a quick buck, and so we have this new "Pink Panther" film with poor Steve Martin as the one being called on to fill Sellars' enormously oversized shoes.  The results are not impressive.<br /><br />Actually, as an actor Martin can not really be held responsible for failing to live up to Sellars' standard  - who could? - but he can certainly be blamed for the witless, unamusing script he has concocted along with co-author Len Blum.  The set-ups and sight gags are tired and obvious, and there is far too much reliance on stale double entendres when benign innocence is what is really called for.  The corny reaction shots showing the stupefied responses of various characters to Clouseau's series of epic missteps and societal faux pas deaden the comic timing, robbing the jokes of what little potential they might otherwise have had.  Martin's slurry accent ultimately becomes so annoying and grating that his Clouseau quickly wears out his welcome so that all we are left with in the end is 90 minutes of lame jokes and lowbrow slapstick to somehow try and get through.<br /><br />The "case" - involving the murder of a soccer coach and the theft of the famed Pink Panther diamond in a stadium packed with crazed sports fans - hardly merits reiteration.  Kevin Kline has some fun as a vain police chief determined to rid himself once and for all of his most incompetent detective, but Jean Reno is wasted playing the role of sappy straight man to the buffoonish Clouseau and singer Beyonce Knowles reveals little talent for acting in the two-dimensional role of the dead coach's girlfriend.<br /><br />It's hard to know who to be more embarrassed for - Steve Martin or Peter Sellars - while watching this desecration.  But since he isn't around to defend himself, I'll stand by Sellars all the way.</p></br><a href="../users/A155KXFRZCA7C.html">A155KXFRZCA7C</a><br/><p>This flick is a comedy that will entertain a lot of folks, especially those who like Steve Martin. I personally hated the original Pink Panther versions with Peter Sellers from the 60s, and this time around I only went because of Steve Martin. I wouldn't call this Pink Panther a remake, but instead it is its own movie. It's a phantastic comedy and Steve Martin shines. Sure there are all the predictable funny mishaps but there are also quite a few new ideas to amuse the viewers. Basically you can forget about the storyline and things like that, because it's not really about that, instead it's about a 90-minute slap-stick flick and comedy show so to speak. The film barely makes the PG rating and it should be more like PG-13 although there are only a couple of scenes that are at issue. Fact is that it's a funny movie and my wife said she wants to own it on DVD once it's released on DVD. You can take your popcorn and relax as you watch this comedy, and my guess is that most folks will enjoy themselves.</p></br><a href="../users/A3TNM3C9ENUCFW.html">A3TNM3C9ENUCFW</a><br/><p>OK, Steve Martin is a funny guy, and has made some good comedys over the last few years, he's also made some howlers and one suspects that his material choices are cause for the blame. Here is a classic example of a bad idea, you shouldn't fix what isn't broken even if your trying to bring a cult classic to a whole new audience. The main problem is not that the character, is bigger than the actor, rather that the character WAS the actor, and watching Steve Martin, trying to play Sellers, playing Clouseau is a mess. Using the idea that this is a prequel doesn't do him any favors either. A Shot in the Dark introduced Sellers as Clouseau back in 1964, in arguably one of his funniest turnouts, alongside his long suffering boss Dreyfuss (the inimitable Herbert Lom) and a superbly dry supporting role by the late George Sanders. Here Martin relies way to much on some very ridiculous sight gags, and struggles with some awful dialogue as he attempts to recover the famous "Pink Panther" diamond, stolen during a football game at the beginning of the movie. His sidekick Ponton played by the always pleasing Jean Reno attempts to mirror the Bert Kwok character of Cato, only without any of the bumbling pathos of the originals, and even Kevin Kline playing Dreyfuss, can't lift this picture out of mediocrity. One has to tip their hat to Martin et al, for taking on a remake of sorts where the bar had been previously set so high, but wonders if an allegorical character based pastiche would have been more appropriate. The movie has some funny moments, but overall is a real let down. I had expected it to be OK but no where near as good as the original, but even going in with this pragmatic approach, I was left disappointed. A real shame.</p></br><a href="../users/A2I6MHMAZZDCRX.html">A2I6MHMAZZDCRX</a><br/><p>It's the murder that shocked France. Just after winning a very important football match (that's soccer for us Americans), coach Yves Gluant is murdered. To top it off, Yves owned the Pink Panther diamond, and the diamond has vanished. It's a case guaranteed to make headlines for months if not years.<br /><br />And Chief Inspector Dreyfus (Kevin Kline) knows it. Thinking this is finally his opportunity to gain the recognition he deserves, he decides to assign the most incompetent detective he can to the case. Dreyfus will then solve the crime behind the scenes and come in and save the day, making himself the hero.<br /><br />Chosen to be the fall guy is Inspector Jacques Clouseau (Steve Martin). When we first meet Clouseau, he's trying to solve the murder of a man who is still alive, by accusing everyone he meets, including a baby and the supposed victim, of the crime. Who could be better at not solving the crime then that?<br /><br />Of course, Clouseau thinks he's been given a great honor and sets out to solve the crime. He quickly begins making the rounds and coming up with suspects, including the victim's fiancee (Beyonce Knowles) and the soccer player who was first dating the fiancee. Then another murder takes place. Can Clouseau solve the case? Or will Dreyfus get all the glory?<br /><br />I must admit to not being familiar with the original Pink Panther movies. I came into this one with no expectations or preconceived ideas. I don't know if this helped me or not, but all I can say is I enjoyed the film.<br /><br />The plot is good and the mystery is logically solved, but it's merely an excuse for the comedy. Here, the movie shines. Clouseau is a complete bumbler, usually leaving behind ruin in his wake. A group of cyclists have several run ins with him, and Dreyfus has many a painful encounter as well. Additionally, Clouseau is thick headed, usually missing the obvious, even when it smacks him in the head. To top it off, there's the horrid French accent. Not even the other French in the film can understand him all the time, making the movie funnier for us. And the scenes where he is trying to pronounce "hamburger" are a riot.<br /><br />Obviously, for a movie like this to work, the performances have to be good. Steve Martin leads the way as Clouseau, making the dim-witted detective completely believable. Yes, much of the action is over the top, but watching Steve Martin, you easily forget that fact. Kevin Kline gets the thankless job of the straight man, and does a good job with it. The other straight man is Jean Reno, who plays the assistant assigned to keep an eye on Clouseau. He does an outstanding job with the role. Not only do we grow to like him by the end, but he also get some great laughs at the climax. Beyonce Knowles is the biggest weakness in the cast, but she has few scenes and hardly detracts from the overall effect.<br /><br />My biggest problem with the film is the sexual humor. Being a PG movie, I didn't think there would be so much or it would be so prevalent. I was shocked by a few of the gags, especially one involving Viagra. Frankly, not only were they not funny, they also did nothing to advance the story. Either these scenes should have been cut, or the film should have been given a more honest PG-13.<br /><br />Not having seen the originals, I can't compare them to this one. All I can tell you is I laughed from start to finish. By the time the movie was over, my sides hurt. This is a great movie for those looking to laugh; just watch it before you let the kids see it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JVSIWDF0WT22.html">A1JVSIWDF0WT22</a><br/><p>The release of this movie was delayed several times but it does not take a rocket scientist to realize why it finally came out exactly the week AFTER the Razzies nominations. At any rate, Steve Martin has to, MUST be considered among next year's nominees. I don't know if there is an actor today who can take over Peter Sellers' role but one thing is clear, Steve Martin is not it. In baseball terms he "goes for the fences" but an infield hit is (seldom) as far as he ever gets. I just felt sorry for him throughout the movie (as well as for the few people who did manage to laugh during the showing I went to) and sincerely wish they paid him well to do it.<br /><br />The good news is for "Bewitched" which is off the hook as the worst recent remake.</p></br><a href="../users/A7Y6AVS576M03.html">A7Y6AVS576M03</a><br/><p>This is not a bad one, but a "good one" as Clouseau says several times in this film.

Inspector Clouseau and his antics have always been the catalyst for outrageous mayhem and fun. This is true to form from Peter Sellers' approach to the role. That is what makes this film so successful and funny. Steve Martin is the third actor to portray Clouseau (the fourth if you include Roger Moore's appearance in CURSE OF THE PINK PANTHER in which Moore may or may not have been Clouseau) on screen. Alan Arkin played him in 1968's INSPECTOR CLOUSEAU in an intentionally dry fashion. Martin returns to Maurice Richlin's character as honed by Sellers and that seems to work very well here. Christophe Beck's score is admirable and he has Henry Mancini's Pink Panther Theme down in a robust elegiac form.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ.html">A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ</a><br/><p>It goes without saying that no one can ever take the place of Peter Sellers, who will always be the perfect embodiment of Inspector Clouseau, but Steve Martin - a legend in his own right - really takes this role and runs with it, leaving a steady train of laughter in his wake.  I thought the entire film was very funny - lots of slapstick stuff, of course, but also some more subtle humor that played well without becoming pretentious.  Martin's fake French accent was a definite winner, and - let's face it - a fake French accent is the funniest accent of them all (with the possible exception of the Swedish Chef from the Muppets, of course).<br /><br />If you're like me, you've probably wondered at one time or another just how the cartoon Pink Panther and the Pink Panther movies are connected.  Well, you're going to have to keep wondering because I'm still not sure myself.  Sorry about that.  Anyway, in this particular film (loosely based on the original movie in the series), the Pink Panther is an obscenely gigantic diamond that is stolen from the head coach of the French soccer team when he is murdered in the middle of a packed soccer stadium.  Inspector Clouseau is brought to Paris, made a detective, and given charge of the murder case - not because he is the right man for the job, but because Chief Inspector Dreyfus (Kevin Kline) wants an incompetent boob to divert media attention while he goes about solving the case himself - thereby ensuring himself of his long-coveted Legion of Honor award (for which he has already been nominated seven times).<br /><br />Determined to finally prove his detective skills, Clouseau throws himself into the investigation, leaving no stone unturned.  Because justice is justice and France is France, he will not rest until the murderer is caught.  All kinds of hilarity ensue as he unleashes his unique good cop, bad cop interrogation technique on a witness, demands to question a murder victim, endeavors to lose his French accent for some undercover work in America, and generally goes around making a fool of himself without even realizing it.  It's a recipe for constant hilarity.<br /><br />Don't expect a lot from the story itself, as it's thrown together somewhat haphazardly; just sit back and revel in the comedic antics of Steve Martin.  He is at all times the center of attention, although I must say that the rest of the cast is quite good (although  I think Jean Reno's enormous talents are wasted for the most part as Clouseau's sidekick Ponton).  Beyonce Knowles acquits herself well in the role of the murder victim's girlfriend, and Kevin Kline seems to take great delight in his role as Chief Inspector Dreyfus.<br /><br />The bottom line is this: this new incarnation of The Pink Panther is an exceedingly funny movie, and Steve Martin proves himself to be the perfect choice to try and fill Peter Sellers' shoes for a new generation.  I'm not naturally a fan of remakes such as this, but I think even the most dedicated Peter Sellers fan can really enjoy the humor of this film.  It really is a funny movie from start to finish.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>Steve Martin has had a mixed year at the movies. First, the critically acclaimed "Shop Girl", then the successful, but dreadful "Cheaper by the Dozen 2", and now the mixed bag that is "The Pink Panther".<br /><br />Detective Clouseau (Steve Martin), a very inept cop in the French countryside, is summoned to Paris by Chief Inspector Dreyfuss (Kevin Kline). Dreyfuss wants Clouseau to distract the public, leading a fake investigation into the death of Yves Glouant (Jason Statham), the coach of the French soccer team. While Clouseau follows his leads, Dreyfuss will secretly lead the real investigation, find the killer, and receive the glory, the accolades and his long-awaited Medal of Honor. Dreyfuss pairs Clouseau with Ponton (Jean Reno) and they soon begin to investigate the murder of the star athlete, and the disappearance of the Pink Panther Diamond. Some of the suspects include Xania (Beyonce Knowles), international recording superstar (that's convenient!), Yuri (Henry Czerny), the Russian born trainer of the French team and many others.<br /><br />"The Pink Panther", co-written by Steve Martin and directed by Shawn Levy, is a mixed-bag. Some of the set pieces are amusing, but the film is a pale comparison to the classic on which it is based.<br /><br />This new "Panther" isn't really based on the original film starring David Niven, Peter Sellers, Robert Wagner and many others. Nor is it based on any of the sequels starring Peter Sellers. What it is based on is the character of Inspector Clouseau, as played so brilliantly by the late, great Peter Sellers. Why do filmmakers believe they can improve upon original works of genius? This misconception has lead to remakes of Hitchcock's "Psycho", "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner" and many others. These films are classics for a reason. Everyone involved in the film was firing on all cylinders, everything clicked and the film was great. You can't improve upon it. Stop trying and subjecting the public to endless hours of bad films. There are thousands of films that would be more suitable for updates, remakes, etc. Films that were good, but are maybe fading into our memories. Or films with an interesting premise but mediocre performances by people who would became memorable stars. Try remaking more of those.<br /><br />Because Martin and Levy aren't really remaking one of the films, this becomes more of an update or a reimagining. I read that this film is supposed to be a prequel to Peter Sellers' entries, but I don't see how that is possible when this story takes place in present day. Because Martin is basically reconceiving one of the most memorable comedic characters ever created, he has large shoes to fill. Martin is a funny guy and he manages to create some amusing sequences here, but the character never really seems fluid for him. He doesn't seem like he inhibits the life of this character. Everything seemed so effortless for Sellers. Martin is more successful in portraying Clouseau's physical bumbling than he is with the difficult to understand accent.<br /><br />Some of the physical humor is lifted directly from some of the original "Panther" films; a sequence in Xania's bathroom is borrowed from one of the sequels. Martin's Clouseau attempts to keep mentally sharp, by sporadically attacking people. However, Sellers' Clouseau confined this action to his willing servant, providing Blake Edwards and Sellers the opportunity to create more and more elaborately choreographed situations. In Martin's case, he decides to enlist the willing Ponton for this purpose, who quickly ends all of these attempts. Because the bits are so quick, they don't have time to build up to anything.  Clouseau also bumbles his way through many interrogations, while Ponton looks on helplessly. There is one particularly memorable little bit, late in the film, Clouseau and Ponton don disguises to infiltrate a party. The disguises are cute but pale in comparison to the elaborate costumes Seller wore. But Martin always seems a little at ease playing the bumbling detective. It doesn't seem natural for him and it did seem entirely natural for Sellers.<br /><br />Martin tries to assay the memorable linguistic problems Sellers gave Clouseau. While Sellers always seemed to be two or three degrees from normal, we always could get a sense of what he was trying to say; "room" became "rhuum". Martin takes the joke 20 degrees from the actual word and his Clouseau seems to be speaking a different language altogether. His attempts to say the word "hamburger" are amusing, but some of the variations Martin tries are so off the mark, it seems like he is making a joke of a joke, rather than trying something new or trying to be respectful of the original.<br /><br />Kevin Kline's Chief Inspector Dreyfuss is amusing in a low key way. We get the sense he might eventually come close to Herbert Lom's slow burn as the original Dreyfuss; there are definitely hints the character may eventually go crazy, as Lom's character did in one of the sequels.<br /><br />Jean Reno and Beyonce Knowles are pretty forgettable. Knowles is certainly beautiful and does an adequate job with her straight lines, but imagine how memorable the role might have been with a true comedian in the role. The finale, involving a performance from Xania, is entirely too calculated to provide an opportunity for Beyonce to sing and for the inevitable music video to play on MTV. Because the situation is so phony it is of no interest. If it appeared to be an organic moment in the film's story, it would make more sense and appear more natural.<br /><br />Emily Mortimer pops up as Clouseau's new secretary, Nicole. A slightly amusing character providing the actress with an unusual comedic turn. Henry Czerny and Kristin Chenoweth pop up in roles that are almost instantly forgettable.<br /><br />It's unfortunate that Martin is squandering his comedic talents on films like "Cheaper by the Dozen" and forgettable remakes like "The Pink Panther". Martin is a gifted comedic talent and should stick to the more interesting, thoughtful films like "Roxanne" and "Shopgirl". When he makes a film like "The Pink Panther", he is really dumbing down his humor. Also, his former core audience still remembers the classic portrayal of the same character by Peter Sellers. Perhaps, the filmmakers felt that the film would appeal to children, and many parents certainly took their kids to the screening I attended. I don't understand why parents, who are familiar with the better, funnier originals, wouldn't expose their kids to these films instead of this weak remake. Perhaps all of the publicity surrounding this new film is drawing children to it, his new core audience. The physical humor certainly translates into silly fun, worthy of the attention of an eight year old. A dumb eight year old. How much richer their lives would be after watching the original at work.<br /><br />If you have 90 minutes to kill, when the DVD is available, give it a try. But don't waste your hard earned money for a bargain matinee.</p></br><a href="../users/A18G7GG53G2X8A.html">A18G7GG53G2X8A</a><br/><p>I went into Shawn Levy's remake of "The Pink Panther" expecting very little; if the ads weren't enough to generate a laugh, then how can one hope for a laugh when it's actually released in theaters? Indeed, laughter was quite infrequent the day I saw it; I guess today's audiences don't see the humor in physically and emotionally tormenting a Chief Inspector or in breaking wind inside of a supposedly soundproof recording booth. And yet, for its many, many flaws, I have to admit that the film wasn't as overwhelmingly awful as I expected it to be.<br /><br />Still, I can't recommend this film. It's nothing but a mesh of uninspired slapstick, shallow verbal gags, and annoyingly predictable outcomes. In other words: it's nothing we haven't already seen a thousand times before in other lowbrow comedies. I'm waiting for the day when the definition of "remake" veers away from "to dumb down and compromise the integrity of the original." I'm also waiting for the day when Hollywood realizes that remaking every movie released before 1980 is unnecessary. I do feel that certain films benefit greatly from a reinterpretation, especially when the originals were released before the technology, the directors, or the actors were around to do the story justice. But when a film was well made to begin with, like the original "Pink Panther" was, then I only have this to say: if it ain't broke, don't fix it.<br /><br />For this new version, Steve Martin (using an annoyingly exaggeraged French accent) replaces Peter Sellers as Jacques Clouseau, the well-intentioned but incurably inept French inspector. He's called upon by the arrogant and mean spirited Chief Inspector Dreyfus (Kevin Kline) to solve the mystery behind the murder of soccer coach Yves Gluant (Jason Stratham in a very small role) and the disappearance of his obscenely large ring set with the Pink Panther diamond. The prime suspect is his fiancee, Xania (Beyonce Knowles), who happens to be a world famous pop singer.<br /><br />Of course, she's not the only suspect. At one point, one of Gluant's players says to the murderer (whose identity is still hidden), "Oh, it's you." This prompts Clouseau to round up every person in France by the name of Yu, the number of which is more than 27,000. Not surprisingly, this insane method of suspect elimination is not followed up as the plot advances. However, we are treated to one interrogation of an old Chinese woman (who, as you can probably guess, is unable to speak French).<br /><br />At Clouseau's side is Gendarme Gilbert Ponton (Jean Reno), a lower rank officer assigned to assist Clouseau and to keep him at bay (the latter of which he fails at miserably). It's quite obvious who the more competent crime solver in this duo is. Why else would he be able to foil Clouseau's attempts to attack him without warning (supposedly to keep him alert)? Even though they're supposed to be an odd couple, the chemistry just isn't there. It was almost as if they were in two completely different films. Maybe it would have helped if Reno had chosen to make his character a little quirkier as opposed to playing it straightforwardly. He's so bland and uninteresting, and that doesn't fit with a "Pink Panther" movie. That could be one of the reasons why the original 1963 film had so many sequels.<br /><br />When Clouseau learns that Xania has left for America, he decides that, if he's to follow her, he must learn to speak in an American accent. The scene in which his dialect coach tries to get him to say, "I would like to buy a hamburger," couldn't have lasted more than two minutes. So then why did it seem to go on much longer than that? It was enough to make me wish that the entire subplot had been eliminated from the film altogether. It goes absolutely nowhere. And it simply wasn't funny.<br /><br />Another idea that failed to capture my interest involved Dreyfus' secretary, Nicole (Emily Mortimer). It was clear that the filmmakers were trying to show a love interest between her and Clouseau. Some tender moments are shared, but they were too few to warrant serious consideration. It didn't help that Nicole was merely a notch below Clouseau in terms of her display of physical humor. It only goes to show that in comedies such as these, opposite attractions are more interesting than two people who are made for each other.<br /><br />I'm not sure how this happened, but a cameo by Clive Owen as a James Bond knockoff managed to work its way into the film. He plays Agent 006, a suave secret agent hired to hunt down a bandit group that disables their victims with gas bombs. Why they included this character or this subplot, I have no idea; they added nothing to the story, nor did they play big enough parts to leave me satisfied with their inclusion. I really don't think that expanding this idea would have helped the film; like the nonexistent chemistry between Martin and Reno, Owen's role seemed to belong in a different film. I suppose a James Bond spoof would be a lot of fun to watch (films like "Spy Hard"), but it shouldn't push its way into someone else's movie.<br /><br />This 2006 version of "The Pink Panther" came off the same way that most of the original version's sequels did: lackluster and comically over the top (in a bad way). I seriously doubt if this remake will garner any sequels. But if it somehow manages to, then the filmmakers need to pay close attention to the script (it was almost shocking to see in the opening credits that Steve Martin had partially written this film). They also need to choose their director wisely. Not even a cleverly animated opening title sequence (virtually identical in style to those of the original films) can gloss over the disappointing job Levy did. But I think the most important thing they need to do is redefine their definition of an entertaining comedy. Maybe then films like this won't get made.</p></br><a href="../users/A3JPFWKS83R49V.html">A3JPFWKS83R49V</a><br/><p>This 2006 movie remake is a comedy film with plenty of slapstick, sex jokes, fart jokes, and physical- type humor. It offers Kevin Kline and Steve Martin in the main roles and having watched the original Pink Panther and one of the Pink Panther follow ups (Return of the Pink Panther), I can say with confidence that this version isn't very good. With the original Pink Panther, you had David Niven and Peter Sellers in the starring roles in a comedy movie that was fun, original, and entertaining all the way through thanks to the performances and the script. With this version, you have a movie that relies on fart jokes, vases stuck to Steve Martin's hands, bullets falling out of a revolver, and other assorted silliness for its entertainment value.<br /><br />In some ways, one can't help but laugh during certain moments of this film- even when the comedy isn't very mature or very original. Take for instance a scene near the beginning where Steve Martin's Inspector Clouseau character is trying to parallel park his small car between two other cars. There is plenty of room, but the idiotic Clouseau keeps backing the car and moving it forward, hitting the car in front and the car behind and causing the bumpers to fall off of each of the two vehicles. It isn't original and it isn't intelligent but you find yourself laughing anyway. Much of the comedy in the rest of the movie is of the same variety. It does make you laugh a little, but the humor is more the result of the comedy's goofiness than genuine funniness.<br /><br />Among the performers in this movie, the only one worth mentioning is Steve Martin and his portrayal of the French- accented character, the bumbling Inspector Jacques Clouseau. Martin's Clouseau character is confidently incompetent- the type of person who thinks they are right about everything when they are actually right about nothing. Many critics have already attacked Martin because he isn't very much like Peter Sellers- the original Jacques Clouseau. It is inevitable that critics and viewers try to compare this movie and its performers to the original (I'm guilty of this, too), but I don't think it's fair to criticize Steve Martin for not being more like Peter Sellers. First, it would be very tough to match Sellers in playing the role of Jacques Clouseau. Second, Martin's character, aside from the accent, is really a character all his own- a new version, if you will, of Inspector Jacques Clouseau. If anything, Martin's character reminds me of the Clouseau from the Pink Panther cartoons. In fact, much of the comedy in this movie is like that of a cartoon. With the bumping, the banging, and the general physical nature of the humor, it reminds me of old Pink Panther cartoons with a touch of Bugs Bunny.<br /><br />Other than Steve Martin, I didn't find anyone else in this movie particularly memorable. Kevin Kline was ok, and so was Beyonce Knowles. But no one stands out in this movie as someone who has contributed a great performance. Martin is the only one who gets your attention. The goofy French accent and his wild and crazy persona are the only parts of this movie that make it worthwhile, in spite of the sub par script and the slower than average pacing.<br /><br />Overall, The Pink Panther is a comedy with few laughs, weak writing, and even less originality. It scores a few points for Steve Martin's zany portrayal of Inspector Jacques Clouseau, but other than that, the film is a wipe out. It's like a glass of American brewed light beer: Weak- bodied and wimpy but with just enough taste and ease of consumption to keep you from dumping it down the drain.</p></br><a href="../users/A2P49WD75WHAG5.html">A2P49WD75WHAG5</a><br/><p>Ah yes, the Pink Panther films of the 1960's and 1970's.  Peter Sellers, hilarious French accents, pain and destruction gags, the Pink Panther diamond that kept getting stolen, the animated character who appeared in the titles sequence, and that famous theme song by Henry Mancini.  Well, in this latest version of the film, clearly the latter five are present, given that Sellers passed away in 1980.  Despite being identically titled to the original 1964 movie, this is clearly a Pink Panther movie for the current generation and technology, given the use of cellphones and references to the Internet and email.<br /><br />The story?  A French football coach, Yves Gluant, the owner of the Pink Panther diamond, is murdered after the French score the winning goal, the giant diamond which was shown on his fist on the stadium's giant screen TV, missing.  Chief Inspector Dreyfus sees this as the chance to become a winner and not merely a nominee for the French medal of honour.  He plans to have a total nincompoop in charge of a bogus investigation, while Dreyfus himself conducts the real one with smarter people.  Guess who's in charge of the bogus one?<br /><br />The suspects range from Bizu, a football player whose girlfriend, pop singer Xania, was stolen by Gluant.  Then there's Raymond Leroq, the casino owner whom Gluant went into a partnership with, but whose gambling habit irritated Leroq.  Xania, played with bootyliciousness by Beyonce Knowles, is well aware that Clouseau (Steve Martin) is gaga at the sight of her and uses her feminine wiles to... well, maybe divert suspicion?<br /><br />Clouseau is given help in the form of Gilbert Ponton (Jean Reno), someone who is used to following orders.  However, during the investigation, it's apparent that he is more competent than his superior.  And Nicole the secretary gives him encouragement.  Oh, and there's some unexpected help from a British agent who's one digit away from being on top.<br /><br />The slapstick gags that garnered many a giggle or howl are present.  As a nod to Sellers' Clouseau getting his hand stuck in a globe in the first PP movie, Martin's Clouseau sends the globe rolling down the stairs and into the street until it causes some cyclists to crash.  And the pain gags, often at Dreyfus's expense are just as painful, such as a scene where Clouseau flips open his ID badge, only to have the badge fly out and pierce Dreyfus's chest.  Hoewver, Kato, the Chinese manservant who attacked Clouseau randomly to keep the detective on his toes, is conspicuous by his absence.  Here, it's Clouseau who randomly attacks Ponton, only to realize his subordinate is really on his toes.<br /><br />Martin, who also has co-screenplay writing credit, manages the bogus French accent well, and he doesn't fare too badly as Clouseau, but his mannerisms can be overdone, and gags that are meant to be funny misfire.  His failure to pronounce the word "hamburger" leads to an airport security sequence mirroring that of the Bean movie-what's the point?<br /><br />One notable difference is the Dreyfus-Clouseau relationship.  Whereas from A Shot In The Dark, Herbert Lom's Dreyfus was driven to insanity and hated Clouseau, Kevin Kline's Dreyfus is a more rational schemer and gloryseeker trying to get the glory he deserves.  Those wild eyes and that smile are there, but he's not the over-the-top psychopath he was in A Fish Called Wanda.<br /><br />While A Shot In The Dark and The Pink Panther Strikes Again stand as classics in the series, this one is at least better than Revenge of the Pink Panther and the lamentable Sellers-less Curse of the Pink Panther with Ted Wasson.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJPMB7N776WS.html">A1TJPMB7N776WS</a><br/><p>This version of "The Pink Panther" has had a rough journey to the theaters as the powers-that-be at MGM/Sony felt that the original version of it was too racy and that Clouseau (a hilarious Steve Martin) was too much of a letch.<br />After re-shoots, 5 million dollars and delays in the release date from last summer, "The Pink Panther" has finally opened and, though the story is a little creaky it is very, very funny, sometimes even hilarious and Martin's Clouseau is perfect: more homey, less weird than Peter Sellers...but definitely a successful interpretation.<br />The story involves the Pink Panther diamond, a pop singer (bombshell Beyonce' Knowles), a soccer manager's murder (Jason Stratham) and around once again to use and abuse Clouseau, Chief Inspector Dreyfus (a muted Kevin Kline).<br />Some of the racy double entendres were thankfully left intact and Clouseau's relationship with his assistant Nicole (a funny, sexy Emily Mortimer) is warm and witty....something that Sellers's Clouseau could never quite attain.<br />"The Pink Panther" 2006 is a barrel of laughs and yet its comedy is thankfully rooted in the things that make us human: it's a major change from the previous incarnation but a welcome one and an artistic success nonetheless.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KB1H0S7T6JX1.html">A3KB1H0S7T6JX1</a><br/><p>The Pink Panther is yet another take on the well known by now diamond and the goofy inspector Clouseau whose task is to retrieve it.<br /><br />Steve Martin, Jean Reno, Kevin Kline, Beyonce Knowles and the rest of the cast carry out their performances very well.

This spy-comedy was a major success and it begun a series of Pink Panther cartoons theatrically and as a tv-series. People had already seen the James Bond 007 films, Dr No (1962) and From Russia With Love (1963).<br />  The second "Pink Panther" film, A SHOT IN THE DARK (1964), introduced Herbert Lom as "Dreyfuss", Bert Kwouk as "Kato", Peter Sellers, of course, returned as the bumbling Inspector, a role he would continue to play in 3 more films, THE RETURN OF THE PINK PANTHER (1975), THE PINK PANTHER STRIKES AGAIN (1976), REVENGE OF THE PINK PANTHER (1978).  Peter Sellers died in 1980.<br />  They had an idea. With the use of unseen footage of Sellers and bringing back other characters in new footage, they were able to make Trail of the Pink Panther (1982).<br />  At the same time, they were also filming "CURSE OF THE PINK PANTHER" (1983) with Ted Wass (ABC's SOAP) as the Inspector.<br />  10 years later, they tried Roberto Benigni as "SON OF THE PINK PANTHER" (1993).<br />  13 years later, in an attempt to bring back The Pink Panther, Steve Martin was chosen as the new "Inspector Clouseau" after much voice training on Martin's part.

It can't be good, because this film is so bad. No one is doing good work, so they can't be happy. But who is causing the problems? Director Shawn Levy? Writer and star Steve Martin?<br /><br />Anyone who saw Kevin Kline in A FISH CALLED WANDA knows how funny he can be. But in THE PINK PANTHER, he seems almost bored. He is in and out of character - as well as accent - so often that it's difficult to determine just what Chief Inspector Dreyfus is supposed to be: surely not funny, and surely not French. In the original, he is definitely French, and Clouseau is definitely driving him crazy - but not in this version. Here he gets beat up a lot; but that's not what made the Dreyfus character funny in the original - it was his borderline insanity.<br /><br />While Steve Martin seems sincere in his efforts as Inspector Clouseau, they fall flat because the writing - which he shared in - isn't funny. He doesn't understand slapstick, which is the type of humor used in the original PINK PANTHERS - and with good reason, given Inspector Clouseau's proneness to accident. He doesn't even understand his own character. Clouseau is supposed to be a self-deluded dim wit: he believes he's a great detective, but he's anything but. He bungles everything, is oblivious to clues that are right under his nose, and when he does something right, it is purely by accident. Not in this film. In this version, Clouseau actually solves the murder mystery through his powers of observation and deductive reasoning, as well as his knowledge of Chinese. That totally destroys the entire premise upon which the Clouseau character is based!<br /><br />I have to scratch my head and wonder who didn't get it most: director Shawn Levy, writer-actor Steve Martin, the producers - who? I know that remakes are difficult, and especially the remake of two comic geniuses like Blake Edwards, who directed the originals, and Peter Sellers, the original Clouseau. But why didn't they take their cue from the originals and stick to what worked? Now there is an entire generation that will think the PINK PANTHER movies are dumb - as the reviews already indicate. But the originals weren't dumb: they were comic genius at it's best.<br /><br />Just about the only thing in this film that resembles the originals are the names of the two main characters and the fact that most of the story takes place in France. It does use the wonderful Henry Mancini theme music in the beginning. But the story opens with a soccer coach owning the world's largest diamond, the Pink Panther, and wearing it to a soccer game! That's not funny: it's ridiculous, as most everything else in this film is. I don't think Blake Edwards and Peter Sellers need worry about losing their rightful places in film history, or being forgotten. But this film will soon be forgotten, as it quickly finds its rightful place in the discount bin of your local DVD store.<br /><br />Waitsel Smith</p></br><a href="../users/A1J03J0HZ7KU5T.html">A1J03J0HZ7KU5T</a><br/><p>You can remake "The Pink Panther" ad nauseam, but Peter Sellers is the  only Inspector Clouseau - a screen immortal alongside Chaplin's Little Tramp and Tati's Monsieur Hulot.

Police director Dreyfuss decides to assign the most inept inspector he has so he can solve the crime himself without the attention of the press on him. He gives the job to Clousseau, played by Steve Martin, and Clousseau bumbles his way through the investigation.<br /><br />The case at the center of the movie is uninteresting and nothing Clousseau does during his investigation lets the audience in on who might have done it. Clousseau suddenly figures it all out and explains it to everyone in the last five minutes of the movie. My real complaints are with the attempts at humor. Every pratfall and joke is telegraphed. They weren't funny to begin with, but when you know what's coming, it's pointless. For all his bumbling and stumbling, Peter Sellers still played Clousseau with subtlety. Martin plays him too broadly, turning him into a cartoon.<br /><br />I like Steve Martin and think he is very talented. There were some other very talented people in this movie like Kevin Kline and Jean Reno. Unfortunately they were part of a bad movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A23GFTVIETX7DS.html">A23GFTVIETX7DS</a><br/><p>I admit it:  I laughed at the slapstick, sophomoric comedy of Steve Martin's entry into the Pink Panther series.  While Martin is no Peter Sellers, he has his own brand of physical, over-the-top comedy that is well-suited to the role of the incompetent, although ultimately successful, Inspector Clouseau. This movie moves rapidly from one joke to another, sometimes genuinely funny and other times not.  Although the resolution hinges on a hilarious twist that depends on the viewer underestimating Clousseau as much as the other characters do, most of the plot is uninteresting.  There is no suspense - except for when the next laugh will come - but Martin carries the film forward regardless.<br /><br />When a rich soccer coach is murdered in front of a stadium full of cheering fans and his famous Pink Panther diamond is missing from his hand,  an investigation begins.  Wily Chief Inspector Dreyfus (Kevin Kline) wants the most incompetent man to lead the investigation - hence the entry of Clouseau.  Dreyfus wants to uncover the identity of the murderer on his own while the public is diverted by the bumbling Clouseau.  Clouseau, on the other hand, sees the case as the opportunity of a lifetime; he can prove his "superior" detective skills and serve his beloved France at the same time.  Jean Reno makes a superb, droll sidekick as Gendarme Ponton, a man who can only roll his eyes at Clouseau's antics but who develops an affection for the unwitting fall guy.  Together, Clouseau and Ponton tackle the case and its suspects, including the dead man's beautiful girlfriend, played by Beyonce Knowles.<br /><br />Steve Martin is the only actor who could pull off this role owned by Peter Sellers, and he succeeds by taking what Sellers did and modifying it with his individual comedy style.  Kevin Kline is delightfully slimy as Martin's frustrated supervisor. Don't expect anything new or ingenious in this film.  It's all low comedy, from flatulence jokes to the trademark Clouseau accent problems.  A few of the more clever touches, such as the appearance of a James Bond-like British secret agent and the surprising clue that solves the case,  are lost in the maze of one-liners and slapstick.  Still, this was an enjoyable ride, Steve Martin style.</p></br><a href="../users/A37PV5GMP2ILJC.html">A37PV5GMP2ILJC</a><br/><p>Steve Martin is no Sellers<br /><br />but this film deserves a look<br /><br />he does the role in Martin-style<br /><br />with Beyonce as the hook<br /><br />Not all the jokes are funny<br /><br />Some of them fall quite flat<br /><br />The plot is sometimes paper-thin<br /><br />But you'll laugh in spite of that<br /><br />A soccer coach is murdered<br /><br />Stuck with a poisoned dart<br /><br />He's also lost his bling-bling<br /><br />seems at death the two must part<br /><br />Chief Dreyfus wants the glory<br /><br />He lives only for fame<br /><br />He picks the bumbling Clouseau<br /><br />So the fool can take the blame<br /><br />But when things vary from the plan<br /><br />The Chief has Clouseau trapped<br /><br />He makes a grand announcement<br /><br />That he soon will have things wrapped<br /><br />Down but certainly not out<br /><br />Clouseau finds one last clue<br /><br />And at the Presidential Ball<br /><br />He solves both cases too<br /><br />Beyonce's bootylicious<br /><br />Clive Owen proves he's Bond<br /><br />With Kevin Kline and Jean Reno<br /><br />This one's for tout le monde<br /><br />Amanda Richards, July 15, 2006</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER5AYS3FQ9O3.html">A1ER5AYS3FQ9O3</a><br/><p>First off, it was a pretty brave move on Steve Martin's part to take on a role which is indelibly linked with Peter Sellers, a man who was not only formidable, nutty, and temperamental but a  genius when it came to creating pure, innovative (and often impromptu) humor.<br /><br />  Martin is certainly no slouch in this department but I confess that I was a bit leery of his abilities (talented as he is) to hold his own against one of the stronger figures in comedic history. I wondered if he'd fall short in the effort.<br /><br />  IMO, he does just fine, even adding special nuances that are absolutely brilliant, including an accent that is original, not a mere duplication of what Sellers did. He also adds flourishes of his own, reviving the Pink Panther genre.<br /><br />  BUT (and this is not a small point)....the rest of the cast pales in comparison to Martin. Beyonce Knowles (cast a a beautiful pop star..gee,what a stretch) does well enough but has a ways to go before reaching full acting potential. She seems simply typecast as a the beautiful, possibly duplicitous, character. Kevin Kline, one of my favorite actors, has a relatively small role and that was a bit of a disappointment because I'd have liked to see more of him on screen.<br /><br />  While the plots of Pink Panther movies aren't all that critical (playing a secondary role to the humor) there certainly IS a plot here, involving murder, thievery and all that). Whether you care about that plot is another matter. I didn't, preferring to focus on Martin, a guy who seems to hit his stride here. It was pure entertainment just watching him perform.<br /><br />  I think there is a unique freshness to this film and it wouldn't be such a bad thing if the film was compared to the original, each film having their own merits - and flaws.<br /><br />  Humor, of course, is always a bit hit or miss...and very personal. Some people laugh hysterically at things other people simply "don't get." Also, some people just don't seem to like Martin.<br /><br />  What I've always liked about Martin's humor is that it often forces me to think about what deeper meanings under his apparent frivolity. It doesn't seem to be ALL fun and games...although the fun and games are pretty entertaining in and of themselves.<br /><br />  Take a chance on this one. It is NOT for everyone and it WILL leave some people cold. BUt it might be just the thing for a pleasant diversion and some solid humor.</p></br><a href="../users/A2KWQ64TRHB3YH.html">A2KWQ64TRHB3YH</a><br/><p>This remake of the classic Pink Panther films is funny and silly, as it is supposed to be, and entertaining, as well as finely acted, but it is not as good as the classic. Peter Sellers was somehow more ridiculous and more entertaining than Steve Martin. Additionally, there is really nothing new added to this film that was not in the classic. True the plot is different and the inspector stumbled over new objects, but these changes were simply variations of what were in the classic.</p></br><a href="../users/A2A6NH6DPE0VXR.html">A2A6NH6DPE0VXR</a><br/><p>Despite being a little better than I expected, it's still not that great. There's some laughs here and there but the movie is still more stupid than it is funny.<br /><br />  While, I don't know who told Steve Martin that he'd make a good Jacques Clouseau. He has his usual look but with a brown mustache glued on. In some scenes, it appears that it's falling off his face. White hair with a brown mustache looks pretty silly as well. Kevin Kline looks more the part and could have pulled it off better. Yet, he's only wasted in a supporting role.<br /><br />  Martin simply just looks out of place and has been a lot funnier. I do like him as a comedian, I have liked many of his films. I just don't like him in this role. He's totally wrong for the part.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FRKEXDXDN1KI.html">A2FRKEXDXDN1KI</a><br/><p>Immensely funny!  Steve Martin succesfully pulls off his version of Inspector Clouseau and bringing `THE PINK PANTHER' to a new generation.<br /><br />Having grown up watching the "THE PINK PANTHER" films starring Peter Sellers and the popular films directed by Blake Edwards, to tell you the truth, it was hard to see a new Pink Panther film with a new cast and modernized but after watching this film, I was very impressed by the performance by Steve Martin and I couldn't help but laugh throughout the movie and knowing that this reboot of the popular Pink Panther name will definitely be enjoyed by a new generation of viewers who are not familiar with the classic films.<br /><br />The film starts off introducing Inspector Clouseau (Steve Martin), narrated by Chief Inspector Charles Dreyfus (Kevin Kline).  Clouseau is literally clumsy and very much an Inspector that really doesn't have a clue.<br /><br />We then learn about the Pink Panther, a huge pink diamond ring that is worn by Yves Gluant (played by Jason Statham), who walks down to kiss his girlfriend Xania (Beyonce) during a major soccer match.  After the French team wins, the team celebrates but then Gluant is stabbed in the neck with a poisoned dart and dies.  A closeup of the hand shows that the Pink Panther diamond is missing.<br /><br />So, as Chief Inspector Dreyfus is excited about his nomination for the "Legion D'Honneur" (Medal of Honor), he needs someone in the force that he can hire that is clumsy and not really good to dig up what they can on Gluant's murder and the missing Pink Panther diamond and then fire him, so he can take credit for it.  What better person to hire for the role but third class detective Jacques Closeau who is immediately promoted to Inspector.  Hired to keep an eye on Closeau will be Gendarme  Gilbert Ponton (Jean Reno) as the two investigate who may have killed Yves Gluant and who may have stolen the diamond.<br /><br />Throughout the film, we are introduced to major key players who has a motive to kill and to steal but as Chief Inspector Dreyfus hopes Inspector Clouseau to bumble the case, somehow he gets positive media attention for his work.  But all is not good as certain key witnesses are killed or may be up to no good.  Will Closeau solve the case in time?<br /><br />Throughout the whole film, we watch as the entire film is shot through a variety of beautiful locations in France and also in New York.  Each talented brings something fresh to the characters that they play but its Steve Martin showing his comedic wit as Inspector Clouseau and helping make the character as believably clumsy, naive but somehow an Inspector doing his job.  A very enjoyable film filled with a lot of humor and silliness that makes the film's storyline all worthwhile.<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />"THE PINK PANTHER" is featured in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1).  The video quality was very well done as it manages to capture the beauty of France and there a good number of outdoor scenes that were just vibrant in colors and overall, video quality was very good.  I did not see any scratches or dust or artifacting.<br /><br />As for the audio, the audio is featured in TrueHD 5.1.  Although, primarily a dialogue film, I did notice some surround sound being utilized during action scenes and music distribution.  But overall, it is a dialogue-driven film.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />This is where "THE PINK PANTHER" Blu-ray disc shines.  There is a lot packed into this disc.  Included are:<br /># Extended Beyonce Performance: "A Woman Like Me" Plus Commentary - This is one of the songs that Beyonce performed in the film.  This is the extended version of that performance.<br /># Animated Trip - An interesting special feature on the creation of the Pink Panther animated opening.  With all Pink Panther films starting from 60's to the present, all have had animated openings and thus, this featurette goes into the creation of the opening segments and interviewing the people involved in the process.<br /># Audio Commentary with Director Shawn Levy - Shawn Levy really gave a good commentary and definitely good in discussing working with the various talents, the locations of where the film was shot and the various improvising for the storyline and much more.  A lot of tidbits to learn from the commentary in regards to the film.<br /># Beyonce - "Check On It" - The Music video for Beyonce's second song used for the film.<br /># 11 Deleted & Extended Scenes with Optional Director's Commentary - This scene really goes into detail on several segments cut.  There were some major footage cut that utilized a good number of extras, probably cost quite a bit to make or film those segments but were actually cut.  In a way, I agree with the director cutting these scenes no matter how painful it may have been for pacing reasons.  But overall, awesome that there is that optional director's commentary for these deleted or extended scenes.  There are eleven and quite lengthy as well.<br /># Cracking the Case Documentary - A pretty length featurette on the actual filming, working with the talent and knowing how Steve Martin, Kevin Kline and director Shawn Levy worked out a lot of improvisation for this film.<br /># Deconstructing the Panther - A featurette that goes into the planning for the film and what they wanted to accomplish to making it different from past Pink Panther films and creating that same magic for the new generation who may have not seen the past films.  Interviews with each major talent in the film and more.<br /># Sleuth-Cam - Three behind-the-scenes lengthy footage of actual filming of several key scenes in the film. Literally a camera recording the whole process of the director and film staff recording, showing the talent of sections he wants to redo in the film and more.<br /># Code Pink: Animated Graphics-in-Picture Track - This segment features the Pink Panther or Inspector Clouseau (animated) popping up with tidbits on the making of the film.  From references to Steve Martin's moustache, historical facts on locations where the film was shot and more.<br /><br />I really enjoyed "THE PINK PANTHER" film.  Mainly because of what Steve Martin brought to the table.  To say that Inspector Clouseau is an idiot is an understatement.  From the gags of trying to parallel park his miniature automobile and his ability to keep running and backing into the cars while trying to park, to being suspicious each time he walks into a room and thinking someone maybe hiding behind the curtains, his relation with his partner Ponton and his assistant Nicole. There is just this nice chemistry among the talent involved and they just made this film work!<br /><br />As for the Blu-ray release, I was very impressed by the picture quality.  The coverage of Clouseau and Ponton all over France and the beautiful shot exteriors to the overall colors in the film were well-done and the audio quality to hear the popular Harry Mancini Pink Panther theme distributed in different channels through your speakers was quite interesting.  But where the Blu-ray shines is its ability to feature a lot of special features.<br /><br />These special features are lengthy and literally, with the number of featurettes and other footage included, you definitely get your money's worth because so much is included on the Blu-ray disc.<br /><br />Overall, I have to say that this was a very solid and enjoyable Blu-ray release.  Great picture and audio quality and many special features to keep those who enjoyed the film quite busy.  For those who were as dedicated as the Travers version of the film, those "Pink Panther" films from the past will continue to be classics but for the new generation who have no familiarity to those films, the Steve Martin version of "Pink Panther" is enjoyable and hilarious.  So, you'll definitely have a great time watching it!<br /><br />If you are a looking for a fun comedy film, definitely give "THE PINK PANTHER" a try.</p></br><a href="../users/AV5G37VFE5NVD.html">AV5G37VFE5NVD</a><br/><p>Though I had low expectations for THE PINK PANTHER, a so-called "prequel" to the 1963 classic, the film was even worse than I'd expected.  The notion of making a Pink Panther film without Peter Sellers is a ridiculous one, but the notion of casting Steve Martin as Inspector Clouseau is even more ridiculous.  Sure enough, Martin is atrocious as Closeau.  Kevin Kline is not much better as Chief Inspector Dreyfuss.  If there's anyone in the cast that gives a good performance, it's Jean Reno as Clouseau's assistant.<br /><br />The script, by Len Blum and Martin himself, is horrible.  The jokes are completely unfunny.  People slam into things, damage is done, Martin makes a fool of himself; there's even a nice fart joke thrown in for the kids.  Even kids, however, won't find this film very funny.  The plot immediately negates all of the Sellers films, while the murderer is obvious from the start.  The good point of the film was Clive Owen, who has a few short scenes as Agent 006.  James Bond fans will realize that Owen was the top contender for the role of 007 in CASINO ROYALE, though the part eventually went to Daniel Craig.  I originally was a top supporter of Owen as Bond, and thus I loved getting a glimpse of what his James Bond may have been like.<br /><br />Christophe Beck, who composed outstanding music for the television series BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, delivers a completely unextraodinary score.  It's indistinguishable from any other average Hollywood score, which is a pity.  Even Henry Mancini's delightful theme seems misused and hokey here.<br /><br />THE PINK PANTHER is a dumb, dumb film which tries way too hard to make people laugh.  There's nary a brain in its head.  It is very possibly the most unfunny comedy I've ever seen.  Don't hesitate to avoid it.</p></br><a href="../users/AUTBHG6070SL4.html">AUTBHG6070SL4</a><br/><p>Movie remakes are always dicey, and it's often the best-loved movies that get remade. As a result, remakes often fall short of the level defined by the original. Steve Martin's remake is a unfortunate demonstration of that phenomenon.<br /><br />The original was clever, sophisticated, and drily witty. Martin plays Clouseau with broad physicality, funny accents, and a bit of potty humor. In other words, the exact opposite of Peter Sellers. It's like a Barney sing-along trying to imitate Placido Domingo. When called by this panther, don't anther.<br /><br />//wiredweird</p></br><a href="../users/A2TAPL67U2A5HM.html">A2TAPL67U2A5HM</a><br/><p>The Pink Panther (2006) - Special Edition~ Steve Martin is a great remake of the Sellers movie. Steve Martin is amazing as the hapless Monsieur Clouseau, he really should have gotten some kind of award for this stupendous work that he does in the movie. Personally I think he does a better job then Peter Sellers. Steve Martins awful English accent is just about right and he acts the part to perfection. Some of the scenes are instant classic like the farting in the sound proof room and many others. Personally I find this version allot more fun then Peter Sellers then again I am a huge fan of Steve Martin and I consider him to be comedic genius well in league with other greats such as Eddie Murphy and Bill Murray to mention a few. The music is right on the mark. The script is very well written and the dialogue is perfect for this awesome remake. Highly recommended indeed. This is not a movie to missed.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ICHEO78NFE4Y.html">A3ICHEO78NFE4Y</a><br/><p>I can never figure out why Hollywood thinks that they can improve on the classics.  With this film they missed the boat 100%.  I actually felt inbarrassed for the actors.  Why put them in this type of situation where it is just not funny.  There was only one Peter Sellers and when he died he took his humor along with him.  As in "King Kong" and so many other films leave these as classics.  The key word for Hollywood is "classic."  It means just fine the way it is.  I won't view this again even if i was paid to watch it.  It's that bad.</p></br><a href="../users/A2J57EQ9KPGXR9.html">A2J57EQ9KPGXR9</a><br/><p>Steve Martin (a very smart guy who was funny once upon a time) stars in this new version of the original Pink Panther movie. To be honest, I was never a big fan of the original movie but I could watch it without an air sickness bag, unlike this mess.<br /><br />Its not funny. One ridiculous pratfall followed by a stupid joke after stupid joke. Nothing is worse than this type of "comedy". Included in this train wreck is a hip-hop hoochie, Beyonce something-or-other, looking more bored than the audience.<br /><br />Don't Bother.</p></br><a href="../users/A1BJJVV2B5VLUQ.html">A1BJJVV2B5VLUQ</a><br/><p>I dig Steve Martin from back in the days of "The Jerk", "Planes Trains & Automobiles", "Parenthood" and "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels"... even his "Bringing Down The House" was unexpectedly great. But, I have to say that Petter Sellers would be rolling over in his grave upon watching this mess. Sellers was a subtle comic genious. As much as I like Martin, he's simply trying too hard to be funny (as is Kevin Klein). Not to mention the physical comedy aspect of it - the gags just weren't funny. You could tell all the stunt people were on wires. Sure I went into this with some expectations - only because I like Steve Martin and I loved the old Pink Panther movies so much. My prediction - Peter Sellers fans, Steve Martin fans, and fans of the old Pink Panther movies will be thoroughly disappointed. DVD extras are minimal - too bad - Martin's outtakes or a gag reel would've been fun to see. Easily one of the worst movies I've seen in 2006. And, perhaps the worst Steve Martin movie I've seen - right down at the bottom next to "Mixed Nuts" and "Sgt Bilko".

Steve Martin does an excellent job, admirably taking over for the great Peter Sellers. The accent is his own and is very different from Sellers. Though I do like some of the references to the older films like Clouseau and the globe and the trouble his accent can get him into. Instead of manserveant Cato (we live in PC times, though Jackie Chan was considered), we get fellow lawman Ponton, played by Jean Reno, who is a good substitute character. Beyonce is also very good in this, proving, like Queen Latifah, that SOME singers can act. The only character who doesn't get any justice is Chief Inspector Dreyfuss. Though Kevin Kline does a fine job in the role, they've heavily changed how the character was. Instead of going increasingly insane and wanting to kill Clouseau with a passion, all this version does is try and show him up and humiliate him. Though seeing as how this and its sequel are marketed more towards kids than the originals (though plenty of innuendo abound in both), today's parents might find Dreyfuss' deteriorating mental state a little disturbing for their kids. The gags are quite funny, though Clouseau inspecting the room for spies gets and the fart joke is tedious (aren't they all). Christophe Beck does quite well with Mancini's classic theme though I do think its a little over used. While Mancini mainly used it during suspense scenes, Beck seems to use it whenever he pleases.</p></br><a href="../users/A1YB29BIDULEYE.html">A1YB29BIDULEYE</a><br/><p>The original Peter Sellers "Pink Panther" episodes were before my time. So, I really can't make a comparison here.<br /><br />But that said, this movie is certainly good for a few laughs and there are enough serious elements to prevent it from becoming an utter farce. (Not to mention a sub plot on corruption as well as deception.)<br /><br />A murder takes place at a soccer match in France. Chief Inspector Kline sees this as a chance to win a public service award that he has been nominated for several times, but never actually won. His plot is to put the bumbling Clouseau on the case. (He feels that Clouseau will bumble along, accomplish nothing, and buy time for Kline to uncover the murder.)<br /><br />While Clouseau certainly bumbles throughout the story, we see that he is not exactly an utter idiot either. For one thing, Beyonce's boyfriend was the murder victim at the soccer match. And a jealous x boyfriend is a major suspect. But Clouseau knows that this is just a little too obvious.<br /><br />I don't want to say too much and possibly ruin the movie for those of you who haven't seen it. But at about the 2/3 point, the movie stops being funny. And while we may have been laughing at Clouseau's bumbling throughout the movie, we are moved into deep sympathy for him when he is framed and hounded by the corrupt Kline.<br /><br />Granted, we may understand Kline's frustration at his repeated coming close to a coveted award, but never actually getting it. But his actions against Clouseau were not only cruel, but they were illegal as well. (Arranging for him to have a suitcase full of weapons at the airport.)<br /><br />But here the movie gets interesting. Through a number of seemingly bad clues he obtained throughout the movie, Clouseau is able to find out what is really going on. This leads to a climactic chase and final confrontation where we are cheering for the detective we once laughed at.<br /><br />(So, first we were laughing at Clouseau; then we were moved into sympathy for him; and finally, we are cheering him on. GREAT!)<br /><br />To top it off, it is virtually impossible not to enjoy it when Clouseau's corrupt boss gets a major comeuppance. We may have seen Clouseau as a bumbler for sometime, but in one of the last scenes, we can certainly smile and give a sarcastic: "Oops."<br /><br />I'm sure many Peter Sellers fans will be reluctant to accept Steve Martin in the role. But that said, the movie is not bad.<br /><br />I've seen Steve Martin in a few roles, and I consider this one of his best.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NL1KW56O3JR8.html">A3NL1KW56O3JR8</a><br/><p>Overall, the movie is undeniably weak.  As a fan of the original, however, I have to admit that I liked it.  Even so, I couldn't justify spending $16 to actually buy it.</p></br><a href="../users/A34VV92TSLC37R.html">A34VV92TSLC37R</a><br/><p>I have never seen any of the original Pink Panther movies.  Well, I did see Son of the Pink Panther, but I don't think that one really counts (I'm sure Roberto Benigni doesn't think so either...).  The trailers for this film were fairly amusing.  Nothing hilarious, but just enough for me to be interested enough to go see it in the theaters.  I was very surprised by the result on screen.  Truthfully, I was expecting a bland, unfunny, offensive display of Hollywood's desparity for new, original ideas.  What I got was a clever, funny remake of what is widely hailed as a classic comedy.<br /><br />The basic plot of The Pink Panther follows the stolen diamond of the same name.  The diamond was supposedly stolen of the dead body of the head coach of France's soccer team.  The head coach is assassinated in the middle of a victory celebration, and the diamond is mysteriously gone from his finger.  Chief of Police Kevin Kline calls in Clouseau so he will have a patsy to screw up the investigation, making him look like the hero, and he will then win his long sought after Medal of Honor.<br /><br />Steve Martin is truly hilarious as Inspector Clouseau.  There were plenty of scene that had me laughing just because of his ridiculously overdone French accent.  Clouseau is stupid.  And that is the basis of most of the jokes throughout the movie, including a lot of physical humor that doesn't work quite as well as the filmmakers would like.  The physical gags were the least funny part of the money, while Steve Martin was what really saved the film.  Just listening to him have a conversation with another character was well worth the admission price.  And really, Martin is the only source of comedy that the film has to offer, so it is really lucky that he is incredibly funny and talented.  Kevin Kline really isn't the funny of an actor, and is given no funny material to work with.  Beyonce is pretty much there for her looks, not her acting ability, and she plays a fairly minor role in the film.  Jean Reno, as Clouseaus's "sidekick" is humorous at moments, but overall he is just another character necessary to complete the movie.<br /><br />Overall, The Pink Panther is worth seeing.  If you are a fan of Steve Martin, you will absolutely love this film, as I believe it his best in a long time (not that it has much to compete with.........Cheaper by the Dozen), and he is obviously the anchor of the film, and the filmmakers know that and milk his character completely dry.  By the end of the film, I actually liked the characters in the movie, and I walked out of the theater genuinely enjoying what I had just seen.  I don't know why the critics hated this film so much, but at least give it a chance, and I guarantee you at least a couple of good laughs.</p></br><a href="../users/A25UZ7MA72SMKM.html">A25UZ7MA72SMKM</a><br/><p>Steve Martin has done so well in his original roles, I have to wonder why he felt the need to "cover" the Peter Sellers performances of Inspector Jacques Clouseau. There is no question that there is always a risk associated with following up on the performance of an iconic character and series of movies. I haven't kept up with Martin's box office, but perhaps his numbers were slipping and he felt taking this chance was justified in the hopes he would hit a home run. After all, many of Martin's roles bear a great similarity to many of Sellers' roles, so there is a foundation upon which to justify this attempt.<br /><br />I want to preface the remainder of the review by noting that I've been a Steve Martin fan for decades now. Martin was a comedy writer for the Smothers Brothers show all the way back in the late sixties, although he came to national prominence more in his own right ten years later on Saturday Night Live. He went from there to sold out "comedy concerts", and of course a string of movie hits that are always amusing, and more often than not brilliantly funny ("The Jerk", "Roxanne", "All of Me", and more). So I'm predisposed to like anything he appears in. I found this movie a bit bland, despite the HUGE benefit of the doubt Martin is going to get from a long time fan like me.<br /><br />In the original Pink Panthers movies (at least after the first, in which Clouseau was a supporting character that took off), the mystery to be solved is not really the most important element of the story, as would be the case with most mysteries. The mystery is just a framework upon which to hang a continuing series of scenes in which Peter Sellers cracks you up, again and again. This movie shares that philosophy. In the long run, you'll probably have trouble remembering much about the plot, as the movie banks on the ability of Steve Martin to keep you laughing. It works in spots, but in others the pacing just doesn't seem correct. Sellers could take on a scene with a slow boil to a laugh and keep pulling you in. In similar style scenes in this movie, it just looks like comedy in slow motion, and those scenes are a little painful to watch. Some reviewers have said that they don't think Martin was trying to recreate the Sellers' performances. I'm not sure I agree with that. The jokes and slapstick were clearly meant to follow up on the Sellers' films. If Martin was not trying to mimic Sellers, at least the character was written in a very similar style, forcing him to look like he might have been mimicking Sellers.<br /><br />All is not lost, as there are some very funny bits in this film, they are just fewer and farther between than I was hoping they would be. The much promo'd scene where Clouseau is trying to drop his French accent, and the overuse of the word "'ambuger" is indeed a pretty funny sequence, to my mind. There are indeed other slapstick and situational sequences that are funny. However, it is not as funny as Sellers' Clouseau when Sellers was in "the zone".<br /><br />I recommend this as a Netflix queue selection, or catching it on TV, rather than a purchase. I think only a minority of viewers will want to watch this again and again. There are Steve Martin movies I've watched a dozen or more times, but I have a hard time working up enthusiasm to see this one even a second time. And why should I, when I can fire up "Roxanne" and watch him do the 20 very amusing nose jokes (actually about 23, if I remember my count LOL).</p></br><a href="../users/A220FJEQNGMSRN.html">A220FJEQNGMSRN</a><br/><p>The latest and least unsuccessful post-Peter Sellers incarnation of The Pink Panther isn't a particularly good movie, but it's certainly a lot better than Blake Edwards last three disastrous bloody-minded attempts to prove that he was the genius of the series and didn't need Sellers (who, to be fair, had he lived was planning to pull the same stunt on Edwards by replacing him with Clive Donner). Steve Martin certainly doesn't make the part his own but at least he fares better than Roberto Begnini, though the accent is wrong in all the unfunny ways. It doesn't need to be a Sellers impression, but remotely amusing would have been nice, especially since director Shawn Levy hasn't a clue how to stage a decent pratfall, rendering much of the physical comedy lukewarm.<br /><br />Along with being the only one of the series not to be shot in Scope, most of the old faithful setups of the series are discarded - Kevin Kline's rather flat Dreyfuss isn't trying to kill Clouseau all the time (no nervous tic or accidental dismemberment either) and Kato isn't constantly attacking him (though this is reworked as Clouseau constantly attempting to attack his assistant, who effortlessly pre-empts him every time) - with not enough new to fill in the void they leave. Indeed, in a sign of its troubled post-production that saw it shelved for the best part of a year, one of the one of the funniest scenes (a surreal airplane sequence that has nothing to do with the plot) got deleted, as did Dreyfuss' motive for bringing in Clouseau to the case, but at least they're both in the DVD extras.<br /><br />Sadly, Jean Reno is almost entirely wasted as Clouseau's sidekick in the film. Looking like he's just had plastic surgery (it's easy to understand why he avoids the clean shaven look: it's scary in a faceless man kind of way), his only genuinely funny moment is a brief dance routine, which at least puts him one up on the one of the film's unbilled guest stars. In a cameo as a thinly disguised James Bond ("006. You know what that means?" "You're one away from the big time?"), Clive Owen proves that while he may have all the dramatic ability of a block of wood with woodworm in `serious' films, when it comes to comedy he's even worse (think Charlton Heston in trying-to-prove-he-has-a-sense-of-humor mode, only much worse). His delivery of even the simplest lines is astonishingly stilted even by his standards, making you wonder if he's unable to speak English unless it's spelt out for him phonetically. Still, if nothing else his leaden touch proves what an unmitigated catastrophe he would have been as 007, and it's a fairly brief moment in a film that's watchable with a few laughs. There's no reason to watch it other than completism, but there's a lot worse out there.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CQON0P01BITL.html">A1CQON0P01BITL</a><br/><p>I really did not enjoy this until the last part...when they were dressed in disguise to catch the killer and they were dressed in the same design as the drapes...and when they almost got caught and had to act like dancers for the entertainment...that was about the funniest for me in this...not sure if I would see this again!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A3DY46ZABF4CMQ.html">A3DY46ZABF4CMQ</a><br/><p>Remakes, remakes, remakes.<br /><br />Aren't there any creative writers who can make originals anymore?<br /><br />After viewing The Pink Panther, that thought will probably come crossing through your head. If not, then you probably thought this was the funniest movie you have ever seen, and that Steve Martin (The Jerk, Bringing Down The House) is a genius for introducing the whackiest onscreen detective turned inspector.<br /><br />The Pink Panther is actually a remake of the comedy classic starring Peter Sellers (The Party) as the 'original' Inspector Clouseau, a dim-witted detective assigned to some serious high profile cases that he, somehow with a strike of luck and ridiculousness, ends up solving.<br /><br />As the 'new' Inspector Clouseau, Martin fiddles his way through some very funny French accent drivel (especially the part where he's trying to learn how to say the word "hamburger"), laughable attempts to 'teach' his sidekick, a no-joke and far more Inspector-quality type detective Gilbert Ponton played hysterically by Jean Reno (the part where Martin and Reno pretend to be back-up dancers to Beyonce Knowles shows a side of Reno I never expected), about police work, and causing destruction by clumsily rolling a big brass ball through the streets of Paris, burning down the bathroom of Knowles, and unintentionally breaking his superior's, a French minister played by Kevin Kline, bones.<br /><br />Martin has his moments in Panther, but the movie overall just doesn't click into classic motion picture material like its predecessors had become. And as you see, I didn't go into the plot, something involving a big rock known as the Pink Panther getting stolen off the finger of a legendary soccor coach who is assassinated in the beginning, of the film because I found it irrelevent.<br /><br />The movie makes a good passing time but just nothing more than that, and with ending results that are far from spectacular.<br /><br />Mildly recommended<br /><br />C</p></br><a href="../users/A32XW50ILWOXNO.html">A32XW50ILWOXNO</a><br/><p>Because of his involvement  in the "Cheaper By The Dozen" series, Steve Martin's remake of "The Pink Panther" has been pitched as a PG family film with two simulated sex scenes, Viagra, a couple murders and Beyonce Knowles exposing a sheer lace bra in a recording session. Finger-wagging is lame, but then so are Martin and director Shawn Levy for pitching the movie to 12-year-olds. Who else is supposed to laugh when Inspector Clouseau needlessly knocks the bumpers off two cars as he parks his mini-mini Cooper?<br /><br />Martin fails to fill just one of Peter Sellers' shoes as Clouseau, handicapping his performance with a doubly thick French accent and overdone physicality. The bumbling detective is called upon to be, unbeknownst to him, a Trojan horse by Chief Inspector Dreyfus (Kevin Kline, DOA) in the murder investigation of the national soccer coach. Clouseau will draw the media attention and the scent while Dreyfus assembles a crack team to actually solve the case.<br /><br />The killer's identity doesn't matter - Martin and co-writer Len Blum thought so little of the central plot that it's obvious the coach's murder would have been caught on tape anyway - and so we are left with 90 minutes of antics and aimless banter between Clouseau and his assistant (Jean Reno), Clouseau and his other assistant (Emily Mortimer) and Clouseau and Xania (Knowles), the coach's pop-star girlfriend. Beyonce is a total blank, a groomed thoroughbred cast for her hair and cleavage; like Jessica Simpson, she doesn't have a core personality outside the madonna/whore poses she strikes in her music videos. If you look real close, you'll see her lips moving.<br /><br />Kids could care less about any of these things. Most of them will laugh at the "hamburger" bit (which is nothing - nothing - more than a Saturday Night Live skit) and some of the dumber ones will pretend to laugh when Martin's face is buried in Mortimer's crotch. But then they're kids, and know what? We don't have to always judge movies - especially one with nobody in it younger than 24 - by whether kids will buy the DVD, watch it once, then package it sale with a Jessica Alba offering at the going-to-college garage sale .</p></br><a href="../users/A27P0MW8TE1JQP.html">A27P0MW8TE1JQP</a><br/><p>IN A DEACADE in which it is cool to hate the FRENCH, remaking THE PINK PANTHER seems a natural. What isn't natural is making the film without director BLAKE EDWARDS (Skin Deep, Sunset, Victor / Victoria) : Offensive stereotypes, less than PC plotlines and of course old Hollywood's even less PC treatment of the women's roles.<br /><br />What of replacing the Inspector himself? What about PETER SELLERS, the original Inspector Clouseau, how can you replace him, in spite of the Trail / the Curse / the Son of the PINK PANTHER having been completed after Seller's passing. Who can fill those shoes? STEVE MARTIN? Maybe.  Martin IS a GENIUS of physical comedy; he can do a stupid French accent almost as well as Kevin Kline (what he's in this too, wow!) What about the Chief (Inspector Dreyfus)? Yep, Kline is Clouseau's nemesis and boss. And CATO, sorry, without Edwards to champion "all things un-PC" we lose Burt Kwouk's clever Asian "house-boy", who is replaced by Jean Reno (The Professional) as Clouseau's partner and a satisfying straight-man, Gendarme Gilbert Ponton. Reno, like CATO is instructed by Clouseau to hone his skills by hilariously attacking him whenever possible(this time in reverse).<br /><br /> The Story (or lack thereof): After a televised murder of French National Soccer team head coach Yves Gluant (Jason Statham of Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels), where the famous Pink Panther diamond is stolen Clouseau is called in to "investigate." Chief Inspector Dreyfus has picked Clouseau because he is sure to distract the media & mess up the high profile case, so that  Dreyfus, can solve the case himself and win France's highest award: "Ze Medal of `onor."  Beyonc&eacute; Knowles is cast as a pop-singer (quite a stretch there) & girlfriend of the victim, also the femme fatal of the movie who everyone thinks "did it" except Inspector Clouseau: "LEAVE HER ALONE! CAN'T YOU ZEE SHE'S ZEXY?!?!" She sure is Inspector! The late Edwards would have approved. Another hottie Blake Edwards would have included had he made this one is Clouseau's secretary Nicole (Emily Mortimer) another excellent physical comedian. As displayed in her "too close for comfort" scenes with Clouseau. Although the character is another painfully clich&eacute;d stereotype, "the girl who is beautiful when see takes off her glasses."<br /><br />Steve Martin plays Clouseau as the late SELLERS (and the late DON ADAMS in GET SMART & the animated INSPECTOR GADGET) did before him: as a moron impressed with his own genius creating chaos and destruction wherever he goes, yet still managing to "solve" the case in the end.. Some good throwaway moments of the movie are scenes where you watch Clouseau struggle with English & etiquette. Like the new Star Wars movies, familiar tunes and visuals tie us to the original saga: the animated Pink Panther & Henry Mancini's immortal theme were both used this way to adequate effect. What isn't familiar about this remake is the absence of foreign-film-feel that Blake Edwards achieved so brilliantly throughout all of the original films. New PANTHER director SHAWN LEVY, who worked with MARTIN in CHEAPER BY THE DOZEN (1& 2), is no stranger to the scene crumbling chaos necessary to let Clouseau be himself. Here he comes through in the PINK, as in the previously mentioned works with another lightweight, moderately-family-friendly-fare (e.g. crude and suggestive humor, fart jokes and language.)<br /><br />This is a funny remake of the classic film series. If you are familiar with the originals it will make you want to put them on. If you're not familiar with the original PINK PANTHER series check them out. In addition to the Pink Panther, there is: SHOT in the DARK, The Revenge of the PINK PANTHER, The PINK PANTHER STRIKES AGAIN, (also filmed by Edwards, some with clips of the late Peter Sellers, some with filler-fools, but none quite as good as the first 5 films: "the TRAIL of the PINK PANTHER," "the CURSE of the PINK PANTHER," and "SON of the PINK PANTHER.") Go ahead and INSPECT them all!</p></br><a href="../users/A1IWWRZJOXOSYP.html">A1IWWRZJOXOSYP</a><br/><p>I laughed hysterically.  I laughed repeatedly.  I started laughing before I'd finished laughing with the last laugh!  Whether the film is "good" or "bad" is hardly the question, it was funny!  Shawn Levy has directed some comedies like "Big Fat Liar" with Frankie Muniz, "Just Married" with Ashton Kutcher & Brittany Murphy & "Cheaper by the Dozen" with Steve Martin.  Bringing back Jacques Clouseau with Steve Martin was a great pairing.  There are so many funny bits like the ball he clumsily sets in motion that bounds down the stairs of the ministry to upset bicyclists and then it keeps reappearing throughout the film, still knocking down things.  Steven Martin drives the new Chrysler Daimler Smart Car that will be coming to the US next year and parks it hilariously knocking off the bumpers of the larger cars around him and then oblivious of the havoc he's wrought keeps going as if he's perfect and makes no errors.  The DVD deleted scenes where he leans on the molding in Dreyfus' office and knocks it off the wall is so silly!  "That's where it wants to be & we should respect that," he says after knocking it off about the third time.  Then when Emily Mortimer from "Match Point" & "Windtalkers" is hanging a picture, she winds up with Martin's face in her skirt as he twirls about trying to gallantly set her down.  I laughed so hard.  Henry Czerny is a fine actor from "The Exorcism of Emily Rose" and "Eye of the Killer."  As the guilty Yuri, he adds a nice comic stupidity to the crime.  Kristen Chenoweth from "Bewitched" & "RV" bubbles delightfully as Cherie.  Jean Reno from "The DaVinci Code" & "Ronin" does a good job as Gendarme Gilbert Ponton who seems as much spy & conspirator as he does friend & partner.  Kevin Kline does a nice job as the Inspector Dreyfus who hires Clouseau for his incompetence.  The cameos by Jason Statham as the coach and Clive Owen as double-O-six are excellent.  Beyonce Knowles as Xania looked very nice in her dress.  "The Pink Panther" may not have been profound, but it did give me repeated belly laughs.  And that is just what the doctor ordered!  Bravo!</p></br><a href="../users/A1I7QGUDP043DG.html">A1I7QGUDP043DG</a><br/><p>No one can replace the late Peter Sellers, but this movie can hold its own separate limelight. Martin has his own style and clearly enjoys the role (Sellers did not). I loved the pairing of Martin and Kevin Kline. Try to get the DVD with the cut versions at the end. There are many scenes I wish they'd been able to leave in. This re-make of a popular comedy has its own original flavor and really can't be compared with the old Pink Panther movies. Loved it, and will watch over and over again!<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author</p></br></body></html>

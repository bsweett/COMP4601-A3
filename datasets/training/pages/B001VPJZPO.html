The "shock ending" you will be able to surmise from about 20 minutes into the film.  The rest of us will probably be in the dark.  I know the ending would have surprised me had I not had someone who took a course in voodoo/hoodoo and who preceeded to explain to me how the movie would most likely end.<br /><br />Also in reference to the ending, a couple professional reviewers (Roger Ebert for example) have said that the ending makes little sense as you think about it.  True, it might not make sense to people not versed in hoodoo culture, but as I said in the previous paragraph, it makes perfect sense when you think about the myths surrounding hoodoo.  So, don't believe those reviewers who apparently don't know much about that particular culture.  According to my friend, the movie does a pretty decent job incorporating it into the movie.  Of course its sensationalized and reel-ified but the things that happen in the movie are considered parts of the hoodoo culture.<br /><br />That said, The Skeleton Key does a good job mixing the typical ghost story with voodoo culture.  As you learn through the movie, there is a difference between voodoo (a religion) and hoodoo (spells and incantations).  Kate Hudson's Caroline will also learn this as she decides to take care of an elderly man (John Hurt from Alien) who is dying and his wife who needs help.  The story moves from there and if you don't know much about it, I would recommend not learning anything else about it.<br /><br />The acting is, of course, pretty good from John Hurt to Gena Rowland.  Kate Hudson does her thing and actually does a good job playing an atypical romantic lead.  The atmosphere is also done really well with the creepy swamps and the house accentuating the mood.  Unfortunately, for a scary movie and one by Ehren Krueger of Ring fame, the Skeleton Key isn't too scary.  There are a couple jump out moments (in which the camera stays close to Kate Hudson and then moves quickly as someone you're not expecting appears in the scene) but, atmosphere aside, is not that creepy.<br /><br />However, considering some of the poor choices we have had for pg-13 horror films recently (Ring 2, Cursed, Boogeyman, Darkness et al) and some lamer rated R movies (Alone in the Dark and Hide and Seek for example) Skeleton Key does a good job of incorporating a good story with a classic ghost story concept.  I think what I appreciated the most was the lack of CG.  After the deluge of CG created horror, this movie hearkens back to movies like The Others where the mood and terror and, overall, a good story wins over special effects.<br /><br />Not the best, but pretty damn good.  And Kudos for doing a decent job with the subject matter.</p></br><a href="../users/A15YPJLKLZS0MK.html">A15YPJLKLZS0MK</a><br/><p>Occult thriler starring Kate Hudson. Worth renting once. Other than some occult imagery though, I wouldn't give it much praise. Not especially good, nor especially bad. Overall, an o.k. thriller however.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VZLLDNLURGJB.html">A1VZLLDNLURGJB</a><br/><p>The Skeleton Key (Widescreen Edition) (2005)- I give the Skeleton Key four full stars for a good plot, script, direction, acting, and on location footage.  The ending to this movie was totally unpredictable and kept me guessing until the very conclusion. Very good performance by the very lovely Kate Hudson and lots of old New Orleons horror atmosphere.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />By relying on tension and chills instead of boo-moments or a shaking camera, The Skeleton Key managed to rise above the morass of the modern American horror film--even if no one noticed at the time, it's a very effective movie with a fitting conclusion.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ.html">A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ</a><br/><p>Any movie that has Peter Sarsgaard in a supporting role, and fails to show him in any of the trailers, or mention his name anywhere on the DVD box, is confusing to me. On one hand, it's clear that they had the desire to look like a legitimate thriller with a solid cast, but on the other hand, it's also clear that they think their audience doesn't include those who care about thrillers with solid casts. This is the mystery of Skeleton Key.<br /><br />At times it feels like it's not sure exactly what kind of movie it is. Is it another typical horror film masquerading as something deeper by using a well-known female star? Or is it a smaller, brooding film about the fine line between Voodoo and Hoodoo and the dark secrets that can hide in the swamp?<br /><br />Ultimately, it's really a mixture of both. There are the obligatory scenes of Kate Hudson in the shower, walking around the house in her underwear, and the cheesy one-liners that have come to define the horror genre. But there are also some genuinely creepy effects, a good deal of mystery, and a pretty surprising and satisfying ending.<br /><br />The extras on the DVD are pretty extensive and make it a pretty complete package, including 20 minutes of deleted scenes, a brief history and description of Hoodoo and Voodoo, and Kate Hudson telling a ghost story from her own life.<br /><br />Really, I have the feeling that The Skeleton Key is more the product of the Louisiana film legislation that gives huge incentives to production companies if they film the majority of their film in Louisiana than anything else. Start looking for more and more films set in the swamp that may not have received green lights from studios, except that the budgets end up being greatly reduced by this legislation.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UKC6QFG9L5GV.html">A2UKC6QFG9L5GV</a><br/><p>I had a lot of prejudice against this movie. I thought: well, a new horror (must be like all recent stupid horrors) starring Kate Hudson(?!)... When I started watching I was like "C'mon, show me something I haven't seen yet". I was absolutely sure that everything in the film would be secondary, that all the thrills presented there I'd be able to tell right from the very begining. Haunted house? Oh, please... "Boogeyman", "The Grudge"... We've seen it all. The door in the attic clatters itself? Well, it must be some animal jumping at you along with a pinnacle of an uneasy musical theme... So that was my attitude when I started watching. Actually I didn't even want to rent it, but finally persuaded myself since I'm interested in the genre.<br /><br />And I was happy to see the film ended up being totally different from what I expected to see. Kate Hudson (who was always OK for flicks like "200 cigarettes", as I thought, but nothing more) was utterly believable here, I have to say I really liked her. John Hurt was brilliant in his silent role (he sure can give you creeps with just one glance of his). New Orleans atmosphere and nature played a big part in "The Skeleton Key", all the swamps, those trees... Well, you get my point. And finally the story line appeared to be not recycled at all, it was rather fresh and intriguing. Although the film is not that terrifying and disturbing it manages to surprise you. And while I was thinking the pay-off was pretty predictable (I was partly right, but it doesn't diminish the story though), the finale still surprised me. It didn't only ruin the movie as it often happens, it actually boosted its value. I didn't see it coming, I was surprised and finally had a feeling those were hour and a half spent not in vain. If you're a horror fan you'll be pleased to see "The Skeleton Key" while not thinking about it as of a masterpiece. And if you are not you'll still like it, for it is not stupid, it has sense and it's not that scary you won't be able to sleep afterwards. Nice film.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ01Q3070LT29.html">AQ01Q3070LT29</a><br/><p>Caroline is studying to become a nurse. She stayed with a patient, Mr. Talcott, who died while she read him a nice story. Caroline felt the hospital was so insensitive by how quickly they wanted the body to be removed out of the room and they wanted her to put his boxes of personal belongings in the dumpster instead of passing them on to the next of kin.<br />Caroline decides to quit her job and accept a new job as a caretaker at the Terrebonne Parish Manor outside of New Orleans.  There she meets the Estate lawyer (Peter Sarsgaard) and Violet (Gena Rowlands),the wife of the man, Ben (John Hurt) who apparently had a stroke up in the attic where they found him.  Violet isn't too keen of having a stranger as a caretaker for Ben.  She says that Caroline won't "understand the house".  Caroline will have to live in this house, located in the swampland, while Ben needs tending too.<br />  Violet gives Caroline a skeleton key that will open up 30 rooms in the manor.  Only half are used.  She sends Caroline to the attic for some seed packets.  Once in the attic, Caroline finds a hidden door that is moving a bit.  She puts the key in the door when suddenly another door she walked through slams open.  She quickly leaves the room without knowing why the hidden door is trying to reopen.<br />  There are many mysteries in this house that Caroline will have to find.<br />  In Bonus Features, Kate Hudson tells her personal ghost story about when herself and her mother, Goldie Hawn, were in London.<br />  John Hurt also recites you a ghost story, in his talented, dramatic way.<br />  Gena Rowlands will read you a spell for love and friendship.</p></br><a href="../users/A2WX1UESDOLXRE.html">A2WX1UESDOLXRE</a><br/><p>I really liked Skeleton Key. "Liked" being the operative word. It was good up until about the last twenty minutes or so. That's when you figure out just what's been going on and what's going to happen, and it really stinks that you've figured it out. Because the mystery weaved throughout the movie is certainly a good one, a really creepy one, but part of the magic of a thriller or horror movie is the directors/writers ability to keep the mystery a secret until just the right moment. Dang, and this movie was SOOOO close.<br /><br />The movie stars Kate Hudson as Caroline, a hospice worker. She leaves her job because she doesn't like the impersonality of the whole ordeal, ie, old person dies, old person is zipped up in a bag, and then their stuff is thrown out. Where's the caring in that? So she takes a job as a caretaker for an elderly man who has had a stroke. His wife (Gena Rowlands) is also there to help and gives Caroline a skeleton key that opens every creaky door in their creepy Southern, bayou mansion. Caroline soon discovers a door in the attic, containing secrets of magic and "hoodoo." (nope, not voodoo! Hoodoo!) But what does this have to do with the house? It's previous inhabitants? The inhabitants now? This is the mystery, and I won't go any further with plot details for fear of giving anything away.<br /><br />Peter Sarsgaard co-stars as a lawyer, and what little bits of the movie he's in are wonderfully effective: his southern drawl makes you like him but it also makes you leery. Very cool. Kate Hudson is great, though her character gets lost in the plot shuffle, and there was a really interesting little story about how her caring for elderly people relates to the relationship she had with her father. If only more thrillers would take the time to develop character in the way they meticulously nitpick the plot... well, we can only dream. RECOMMENDED.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GKPMHV4U64IY.html">A3GKPMHV4U64IY</a><br/><p>A young health care professional disgusted with hospice care takes a job looking after a dying Southern gentleman.  The lady of the house is very old South but they manage to get along.  To help care for the man she is given a key to the whole house, a skeleton key.<br /><br />But there is one door in the attic that the key will not open.  Soon the suspense of possible ghosts builds and thickens.  Slavery, prejudice and hoodoo seem to be part of what is going on in the house.  Before long lines are crossed from psychosomatic to belief and the story surges forward at a furious pace.<br /><br />The mix of ghost story and magic really worked with the Southern setting and created a truly chilling story.  Not a straight ghost story, not straight horror film, but a unique blend with a fresh twist that really raises the hackles.

It tends to be somewhat sluggish and it doesn't quite move along as it should. Nevertheless it has a decent ending. Overall: GOOD!</p></br><a href="../users/A2VD2D1QHCMF9Q.html">A2VD2D1QHCMF9Q</a><br/><p>A young woman is hired to take care of an ailing old man who lives with his wife in an old, haunting house an hour away from New Orleans.  We know immediately that something strange is going to happen because the music is haunting, and overwhelming.  A bit too overwhelming.<br /><br />As time goes on, odd things happen, particularly with respect to the old man.  Is he really as sick as he appears, or is the old woman doing something to control and sicken him, and if so, why?  There is also something creepy about the lawyer.  Who is he, really.  And, of course, there is the house.  Is it haunted or is there something in there that, in effect, hypnotizes the protagonist into seeing something that isn't there.  Why does the wife act in such mysterious ways.  What is hoodoo and is it real or a fiction?  All of these questions come together at the end of the movie, and in a satisfactory way.<br /><br />The music is annoying and destroys one's concentration, and has the opposite effect for which it apparently was inserted.  I found that the movie would have been more sinister if the music had less emphasis.  Also, Kate Hudson is attractive, and young, too attractive and too young for this part.  She was just not a credible choice for a woman who is to be taking care of an old man, stealthily gong through what could only be described as a haunted house, getting into the "dark arts," confronting the old woman, etc.  This part should have been for someone appearing as less of an ingenue.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NSMQIF1C2VCE.html">A1NSMQIF1C2VCE</a><br/><p>Although the big surprise twist isn't that much of one, The Skeleton Key is still a very entertaining and stylish supernatural thriller, with an all-star cast, wonderfully spooky scoring and great directing like they aren't supposed to do any more. And what's more, it gets the difference between voodoo and hoodoo right.<br /><br />Kate Hudson and especially John Hurt absolutely sell the story, and the entire conceit of hoodoo not being dangerous unless you believe it teases viewers not to believe.<br /><br />Recommended for fans of supernatural thrillers like the Serpent and the Rainbow, the Ring and the Sixth Sense.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDZNPO7U4E6N.html">A1CDZNPO7U4E6N</a><br/><p>The beautiful Kate Hudson plays Caroline. A hospice nurse who's just been hired to be the live-in caretaker of a dying old man and his elderly wife in Louisiana. Personally, being from the deep South this movie ringed way too true for me. None-the-less the longer Caroline stays in the house with the couple events start to occur leading Caroline to believe that there may be something more of a spiritual nature going on. It's that curiosity that prompts her to start digging around into some of the ancient practices of hoodoo. The deeper Caroline gets she starts questioning whether to believe, or not to believe in these practices, or what she's witnessing with her own eyes day by day. The ending was most impressive to me. I hate to spoil it for you if you haven't seen it. However, I saw this movie with my sister, and we both came to the conclusion that the spirits (if you will) in the house were those of the 2 children. We never guessed that the spirits were the 2 black slaves that were lynched on that plantation after being caught by the white owners teaching the black arts to their children. Not only that, they were possessing bodies to live again, but the only way they could do that was you had to believe or have faith in the magic to begin with. I thought it was deep!</p></br><a href="../users/A3FBGZ4E6KGIW2.html">A3FBGZ4E6KGIW2</a><br/><p>I just watched this recently and I was surprisingly pleased.  Kate Hudson does a great job here, as does Peter Sarsgaard and the rest of the cast.  I was not expecting what happened at the end.

This is worth buying, I would recommend it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>Rich in Southern Gothic atmosphere, THE SKELETON KEY is a spooky little movie, far from perfect, but above average for the recent spate of horror films---and it's NOT A remake!!<br /><br />Kate Hudson gives a good performance as a young woman who takes on the hospice responsibilities for a recent stroke victim (John Hurt, effectively eerie).  His wife, well played by the dependable Gena Rowlands, has hired Hudson to take care of her husband until he passes on.  It's not long, though, before Hudson suspects something is going on in the creeky old manor.  She stumbles upon a secret room that strongly hints of hoodoo practice.  Without relying on gore or violence, SKELETON KEY moves eerily along with a twist ending you may not see coming.  Peter Sarsgaard also stars as a young lawyer who tries to help Hudson through.  THE SKELETON KEY is a stylish thriller with enough jolts to keep you on the edge of your seat.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EIK4L9730WWJ.html">A2EIK4L9730WWJ</a><br/><p>The Skeleton Key is just a basic edge of your seat thriller and Kate Hudson does a wonderful job in the movie!!!!!!

Without resorting to the usual stock gimmicks, THE SKELETON KEY works on many levels to frighten and entertain and it succeeds!<br /><br />Caroline (Kate Hudson) is a beautiful 25-year old whose guilt over her absence from her father's deathbed has driven her to seek work in nursing homes (the film's opening sequence with Caroline reading to a dying man is elegant and touching and quite timely) and ultimately to hospice care. Answering an ad in the paper for a hospice nurse takes her to a strange old Southern mansion in which live the Devereauxs - Violet (Gena Rowlands) and her bedridden husband Ben (John Hurt). Caroline passes her interview and at the warm insistence of the family lawyer Luke (Peter Sarsgaard) she takes the job. Violet is a frightening old lady who entrusts Caroline with a skeleton key which opens the doors of all 30 rooms of the creaky, musty mansion - except for one door in the attic. Noting there are no mirrors in the house, Caroline begins to investigate the place and Ben's seemingly terrified state and discovers the forbidden room contains elements of dark magic. She seeks information from her close friend Jill (Joy Bryant) who skeptically informs her that the symbols and paraphernalia Caroline has discovered are factors of Hoodoo - a strange magic whose multiethnic beginnings are in New Orleans. Slowly Caroline challenges Violet for information and finding none, seeks the advice of a Hoodoo woman (Fahnlohnee R. Harris) for answers. The bizarre dark secrets of the old mansion and the Devereaux couple ultimately come into focus and it is up to Caroline to break some spells....if that is possible.<br /><br />With a cast this fine it would be surprising if the film didn't fly and each of the actors creates a credible creature that involves us from the beginning. Yes, the horror story is accompanied by rain storms and thunder storms that serve to heighten the tension and the pacing by director Softley keeps the audience alert and suspicious and ultimately surprised. This is one of the better thrillers released in some time. Recommended especially to devotees of the thriller genre! Grady Harp, November 05</p></br><a href="../users/A2EEUQ81DTY7G3.html">A2EEUQ81DTY7G3</a><br/><p>While the Skeleton Key won't offer up anything new to fans of the Southern gothic ghost story genre, with the proceedings far from strikingly original, the movie, however, is generally well acted, skillfully plotted, and even moderately chilling, and it presents something slightly different in the haunted-house genre. There's also a particularly nifty and surprising twist to the story that most viewers won't see coming.<br /><br />Director Iain Softley sets the story in the swamps of Louisiana and instills the proceedings with a distinctive roux of race and religion that permeates New Orleans and its outlying parishes. Consequently, the Skeleton Key has a swampy, soulful authenticity, and some surprisingly good performances, placing it a notch above some of the mediocrities of the same genre.<br /><br />With its ghosts, dusty, rubbish filled attics, attractive young woman in jeopardy and near-constant rainstorms, this movie is as psychologically spooky and atmospheric as a ghost story could possibly be. Combined with its evocative setting, and a coolly restrained leading performance from Kate Hudson and a truly wonderfully over-the-top supporting turn from Gena Rowlands, The Skeleton Key is quite hip, slick, and suspenseful.<br /><br />Hudson plays Caroline, a young hospice worker and aspiring nurse, recently moved to Louisiana, who is hired by Violet Devereaux (Gena Rowlands), a cantankerous woman to take care of Ben (John Hurt), her paralyzed husband in their rundown mansion in some backwater parish of the bayou. Ben has suffered a debilitating stroke after a visit to the house's attic, now his speechless and spends his days staring out at the picturesque garden from his wheelchair; he's also terrified of looking in mirrors.<br /><br />Violet makes a great ceremony of explaining that she had keys made to all the rooms of the house, which sags with a shabby elegance and lots of religious iconography on the lip of a moss-draped bayou; she gives Caroline the skeleton key, which opens every door, including the one to the attic.<br /><br />Of course, Caroline has no need to ever go up into the attic, but she's a bit of a nosey parker, so her inquisitiveness eventually gets the better of her. Once there, she begins to explore a mysterious secret room beyond a locked door, where once long ago strange and furtive happenings took place.<br /><br />To reveal any more of the plot, would spoil the story, but suffice to say, Caroline gets herself involved in all sorts of supernatural and ghostly shenanigans. She gradually discovers that nothing is as it first seemed, the old man Ben, is being held prisoner against his will, the house is possessed by voodoo spirits, and she herself may even be trapped by their evil spell.<br /><br />The film works, not just because of the gorgeous Ms. Hudson, who manages to imbue Carolyn with a no-nonsense brusqueness and a fearless bullheadedness, but also because Softley manages to instill the proceedings with a Southern Gothic ambience; he also makes the most of Hudson's loaded dialogue exchanges and creepy encounters with Rowlands.<br /><br />Indeed, Rowlands delivers a quietly hilarious performance as the gruff, chain-smoking doyenne of the bayou, who quietly resents the fact that Caroline does not speak with a Southern accent. Peter Sarsgaard is also chillingly notable as Violet's handsome, but also quite enigmatic young real estate lawyer.<br /><br />Skeleton Key is one of those films that you shouldn't think too much about after you've finished watching it; otherwise you'll probably find that much of the story's logic will come crashing down around you. But the appeal of The Skeleton Key lies not in its plot but in its attention to detail, and the way Softley luxuriates in the deeply textured sights and sounds of Louisiana.<br /><br />The director is obviously having fun soaking up all spooky clich&eacute;'s: an old blind lady with a milky stare, a handsome stranger who asks Caroline if she can speak French, pickled body parts, faded photographs of unhappy people in period dress, a stuffed dummy in a blond wig, and a magical circle in chalk and blood. Mike Leonard November 05.</p></br><a href="../users/A6ADO7B6FUVN.html">A6ADO7B6FUVN</a><br/><p>Skeleton Key delivers a fascinating horror film with a chilly atmosphere that forces the audience to peek behind the couch to see that there is nothing surprising sneaking behind.  It is with crawling motion that the film advances while it occasionally brings to mind the southern mood from Hush... Hush, Sweet Charlotte (1964).  However, it does not have any of the gore that director Robert Aldrich exploited in his 1960s psychological haunting tale.  Instead, Skeleton Key slowly builds up an eerie atmosphere that will reach its peak in the final crescendo where the film will subtly shake the audience's perception of reality in a profoundly spooky manner.<br /><br />Detached from society, the film opens in a nursing home; a place where many elderly people seek their final destination before parting from the living world.  Here Caroline Ellis (Kate Hudson) sits and reads out of Treasure Island for a man who is about to take his last breath to the fading words by Robert Louis Stevenson.  Unlike Stevenson who accomplished a literary success and fame left something behind while the man dies a lonely death without anyone caring about his existence.  The scene suggests several different notions, which also has to do with the film's main theme - death.  However, it also taps on the idea of dying an anonymous death, as if the person lived a meaningless or unknown existence.<br /><br />Caroline's desire to become a nurse for the elderly and those who soon will cross into the next world stems from her father's passing.  She missed her father's death, which has caused her to set out on her own mission by providing company to those who are about to pass on.  It is a noble thought, especially when the audience learns about the many people in Carloine's nursing homes that pass away without the care or affection of relatives at the final stage of their lives with nowhere to send the deceased's belongings.<br /><br />Through an ad in a newspaper, Caroline finds a good paying job, as a live-in hospice caretaker.  The drawback with the job is that it is located in the remote bayou south of New Orleans.  Nonetheless, she takes the job with the old couple Ben Devereaux (John Hurt) and Violet (Gena Rowlands), as she is supposed to care for Ben in his final stage of his life after having suffered from a serious stroke.  The couple lives in an old plantation manor that has seen its glory days a little less than a century ago, and where each room has a different lock on the doors.  In order to move around freely in the mansion she receives a skeleton key, as it can unlock all doors of the house.  The skeleton key also provides a symbolic notion of having the power to uncover secrets, which makes more sense in the end.<br /><br />Strange things begin to happen, as the supposedly paralyzed Ben has ability to grasp and occasionally make some form of communication.  Unhurriedly, Caroline discovers one secret after another such as a message for help and a hidden door in the attic.  With the skeleton key, Caroline has the power to unlock the secrets and to find out what is truly occurring at the Devereaux mansion.  Behind the locked door in the attic, she discovers strange and bizarre equipment.  These tools and trinkets including a creepy record somehow connect with hoodoo, a traditional magic that originated in the southern United States.  Hoodoo has its roots in African, European, and Native American folklore and botanical ingredients that a person applies to control supernatural forces to help with everyday life.  However, all of its power is meaningless, as it can only influence people foolish enough to believe in it.  The combination of supernatural forces and strange brews begin to unveil that the old man that she takes care for desperately tries to flee and get her help.  The question is how can she help him, and convince someone to believe her that magic is in the works.  The only person that she can turn to is the young lawyer Luke (Peter Sarsgaard), who first has a hard time believing her.<br /><br />Skeleton Key displays a delightfully frightening atmosphere that intentionally lingers throughout the whole film, yet it also triggers the audience's curiosity.  However, the truly terrifying notion emerges after the film when the audience begins to ponder what happened in the end.  The director Iain Softley exhibits that a horror film can be thoughtful while also revealing that fear can be so much more than simple head chopping and serial killing.  In addition, Softley succeeds to bring together to opposite characteristics such as fear and curiosity that boil into an eerie nightmare that will haunt the audience in a cerebral manner.  Some elements within the film feel a little awkward during its progress.  However, these knotty moments smooth out through the clever ending, an ending that literary delivers the concept - "curiosity killed the cat."</p></br><a href="../users/A25ZVI6RH1KA5L.html">A25ZVI6RH1KA5L</a><br/><p>I really enjoy a good ghost story, and that's pretty much what we have here with The Skeleton Key (2005), a ghost story with a southern twist, one that I think sort of got lost in the shuffle when released theatrically, as I think it deserves more attention than it initially received.  Written by Ehren Kruger (The Ring, The Brothers Grimm) and directed by Iain Softley (Hackers, K-PAX), the film stars Kate Hudson (Almost Famous, Alex & Emma) and Gena Rowlands (Paulie, The Notebook).  Also appearing is Peter Sarsgaard (K-19: The Widowmaker, Kinsey), Joy Bryant (Get Rich or Die Tryin'), and John Hurt (The Elephant Man, Hellboy, V for Vendetta).<br /><br />Kate Hudson plays Caroline Ellis, a nursing student and hospice worker who, after witnessing the demise of a patient, becomes disillusioned with uncaring, corporate medical machine, quits her job, and looks for a position within a household if only to provide care on a more personal level (this is more or less an outgrowth of some unresolved baggage between her and her father, the latter having passed away not so long ago).  Anyway, she ends up taking a position in a decaying, southern plantation house out in the middle of nowhere, working for an older couple named Ben and Violet Devereaux (Hurt and Rowlands, respectively), as Ben has recently suffered a paralyzing stroke, and can barely move or speak. Upon arriving at the Devereaux estate, Caroline meets the family lawyer Luke Marshall (Sarsgaard), the one who actually hired her, along with Violet, who seems none too receptive of little Miss Thang...anyway, as Caroline moves in and goes about the business of caring for Ben, she begins to notice various peculiarities with regards to the house, the most obvious being there aren't any mirrors and there's a hidden door in the room in the attic, one Violet claims she nor her husband have never opened in their forty plus years in residence in the house (what a crock).  Caroline, not buying what Violet's selling, and being the particularly nosey sort she is, manages to open the mystery door, its contents presenting more questions than answers (kind of like when a contestant on the television show "Let's Make A Deal" picked the door with the `zonk' behind it).  After a bit of prying, Violet eventually relates a bit of history with regards to the house and its violent past.  Soon Caroline suspects the source of Ben's condition to be tied to what she found in the attic, and also that Violet may not be the caring, loving, doting wife she appears to be, eventually leading Caroline into a world of hoodoo rituals and beliefs, one populated by spooky characters and sinister motives, not to mention a whole lot of poultry parts, mystery organs in jars, and brick dust...<br /><br />William Hurt is one lucky crud...his limited role had very few lines, entailing him to lay about with a scared and bewildered look on his mug, and included him sitting in a bathtub and having Kate Hudson rub a warm sponge all over his wrinkly body.  Do you know how many guys would pay to have that done?  More than a few...anyway, as I mentioned earlier, I thought this was a great, little film, one that exceeded my expectations, which, honestly, weren't all that high.  I thought Miss Hudson did well in her role, but there were some aspects about her character I didn't care for, particularly her tendency to walk into peoples homes uninvited (a great way to get yourself shot) and just the fact she was a real snoop, the latter illustrated by her efforts to gain access into that secret room in the attic, which she had no business in whatsoever.  Part of this came from her hearing strange noises emanating from said place, but I'll tell you what, that would have only served to keep me even further away from the room as I've seen enough movies to know curiosity kills more than just cats.  One interesting aspect about this film is I think director Iain Softley must have had a real thing for Hudson (who could blame him), as he sure like filming her form in long, lingering shots.  It's funny, as there's like twenty minutes of deleted scenes included on the DVD, and yet the filmmakers managed to retain, intact, mind you, most all of the long, lingering shots I mentioned earlier.  Well, as I said, I thought Miss Hudson did well, but I thought Gena Rowlands' performance was the real treat here...there just aren't that many actresses out there nowadays that can pull off the creepy old bag routine like there were in the past, at least not to the extent someone like Bette Davis, or Joan Crawford could (when I say `creepy old bag', I mean that in the kindest, possible way), but Rowlands managed to deliver.  She works it well, getting her creep full on about three quarters of the way in, right about the time she and Hudson's character were sitting down one evening for some freshly made gumbo (it was about this time Caroline's suspicions with regards to Violet were confirmed).  She never really went overboard, which I actually appreciated as I think it takes more skill to present restrained psychotic than unfettered crazy.  I thought the cinematography was beautiful, the sense of direction strong, and the pacing of the story maintained well throughout the film (the last twenty minutes or so sweeps you up like a strong river current).  One aspect I really liked was how we were presented with a notion of what was truly happening, only have that twisted, and then twisted again, all funneling into an eerie finale.  If you do get a chance to see this film, make sure to take mental notes throughout as once the end is revealed, a lot of little, seemingly random and meaningless aspects of the story will make sense.  I didn't really find this movie all that scary, but it was entertaining.  I am curious about one thing, though...does every movie that incorporates hoodoo/voodoo into the storyline have to feature an old blind woman with the milky eyes?  It sure seems like it...<br /><br />The picture, presented in widescreen (2.35:1) anamorphic, looks sharp and clear, and the Dolby Digital 5.1 audio, available in English, Spanish, and French, comes through richly.  In terms of extras, the DVD is engorged with special feature requiring nearly the same amount of time to sift through as it did to watch the film.  There's like ten featurettes, each running anywhere from two to ten minutes, some dealing with the making of the film, casting, real life ghost stories, a gumbo recipe, the shooting location, the music in the film, and so on...also included are over twenty minutes of deleted scenes (with optional director's commentary), a director's commentary track for the feature, English, Spanish, and French subtitles, and previews for other releases like American Pie Presents Band Camp (2005), The Ice Harvest (2005), War of the Worlds (2005), and Cinderella Man (2005).<br /><br />Cookieman108<br /><br />I've learned quite a few things from this film...people in the south seem acutely prone to strokes, they like to listen to the song "Iko Iko" sung by The Dixie Cups, and using a VW bug to bust through a wrought iron gate is a really bad idea (at least for the car)...</p></br><a href="../users/A2582KMXLK2P06.html">A2582KMXLK2P06</a><br/><p>"Caroline, come feel some southern hospitality, my child".<br /><br />Okay, that's not exactly a line from the movie, or significant in any way.  I just liked the old lady in the film.  :)<br /><br />After watching the Skeleton Key three times, I have come to the conclusion that it contains pretty good suspense, but it's not really a horror movie because nothing ever frightened me in any way.  It was just an above average film with an occasionally unsettling atmosphere.<br /><br />The movie takes place in a house in the southern United States.  Kate Hudson does a pretty good job in her role as the main character, though sometimes her curiosity with the mystery of the house (particularly her obsession with that one room in the attic) sometimes became WAY too much.<br /><br />I mean, come on, if someone taking care of a sick member of your family was ever THAT curious about something in your home, wouldn't you be annoyed by it?  And if that same person persistently kept picking at it until they found an answer, wouldn't that make it even MORE annoying?  Yes!  Of course!  Because what happens in your home is nobody elses business.<br /><br />As for the Skeleton Key plotline, it stayed consistently "above average" for about 70% of the film, and then the last 30 minutes picked up strongly with lots of action and a really good and unpredictable ending.  Not really a horror movie though.  That's the only thing about the film that kind of bothers me.</p></br><a href="../users/A2LR4NR0G8KO7C.html">A2LR4NR0G8KO7C</a><br/><p>If it wasn't for the great cast, this movie would have ended up in the dvd store very quickly. The pictures of the traditional southamerican scenery are nice, but I cannot recall a single frightening moment in this entire movie. Isn't a ghost story supposed to be scary anymore these days? I feel as if this movie could have been a lot scarier than it was. It was like watching North and South with a touch of voodoo/hoodoo.(SARR)</p></br><a href="../users/A1R602SXNGOMJ4.html">A1R602SXNGOMJ4</a><br/><p>The film deals with the adventures of a young care worker in the middle of Louisiana. The atmospheric surroundings, the haunting score, beautiful, spooky photography, and some very good acting by Rowlands and Kate Hudson raise the bar for upcoming "horror films". We're glued to the screen for nearly two hours, as things become more mysterious and intriguing. A few times we're treated to a jolt and a revelation, but what closes the film is bound to ruffle a few feathers.<br /><br />Above all, this is a very good movie, with a script that doesn't cheat anyone and doesn't rely on silly gimmicks. Those factors should portend good tidings for its success in its original release, but it will probably become a classic of its kind. The heroine in distress manages to be smarter than the usual stereotype. She wants to explore the surroundings and solve the problem. The problem is she has no idea how bad the situation might be.<br /><br />Kate Hudson makes a very strong impression in this film. She goes beyond the pretty actress to an accomplished performer who matches up to Rowland's intensity. She navigates the film with an ease rarely seen in today's roster of plastic pre-packaged pseudo celebrities. It is refreshing to see an actress make you care for the character that has so often been portrayed as an offensive stereotype. There no gratitude's screaming scenes here. The film reminds me of "The Others", a movie with substance and intelligence.<br /><br />This is a film that I will highly recommend to my friends, particularly because I want to hear what they have to say about that ending.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>Almost every film you watch requires some level of suspension of disbelief. Some genres (Sci-Fi, Horror, Musicals, etc.) require more than others (drama). I am willing to give any film the benefit of the doubt and fully "buy into" the world the filmmakers attempt to create. Because of this, I expect a lot from the filmmakers in return. If they expect me to take that leap of faith, I expect them to deliver believable characters, an interesting, involving story and to make me laugh, believe, get frightened, whatever the story would dictate. If they do that, I usually enjoy the film. Unfortunately, this doesn't happen enough. If they don't, the film becomes a mess. "The Skeleton Key", the new thriller starring Kate Hudson, is a film requiring a fair amount of suspension of disbelief. The key to unlocking its success is to make everything believable. Does it accomplish that?<br /><br />Caroline (Kate Hudson), a hospice worker in New Orleans, becomes so disillusioned with her job that she answers an ad for a private in-home caregiver in a parish about an hour out of the city. Upon arrival, she meets Violet (Gena Rowlands), the wife of her new patient, Ben (John Hurt). Violet is reluctant to have strangers in her house, a large plantation home that has seen better days, but their lawyer, Luke (Peter Sarsgaard, "Kinsey") insists that she get help for Ben during his last days; he had a heart attack while working in the attic and is now paralyzed on both sides of his body, unable to speak or move. Caroline accepts the job and soon receives a skeleton key that will open every door in the house. Exploring the house, she soon makes her way up to the attic and begins to discover some strange things.<br /><br />"The Skeleton Key", directed by Iain Softley ("K-PAX") and written by Ehren Kruger ("The Ring Two", "The Ring", "Arlington Road"), is that strange thing; a thriller with good performances, good writing, good directing and only the occasional cheap thrill.<br /><br />All of the performances in the film are very good. Perhaps the biggest surprise is Kate Hudson who takes a 180* turn from the "comedies" she has been subjecting us to for the last few years. She does a really good job in this very dramatic role. As a 25 year old dealing with issues of her father's death, Hudson's Caroline becomes a caregiver. Disillusioned by the economics of her job in the city, she takes a job in the country, caring for one man. She soon realizes that perhaps there is more gong on than meets the eye. During the course of the film, she tries to figure things out. Unlike most thrillers or scary movies, Caroline seems to have a head on her shoulders. She doesn't believe in "Hoodoo", an offshoot of voodoo which features prominently in the film, or spirits or ghosts, so when she makes the inevitable trip to the "dark room", in this case, the attic, it happens during the middle of the day. It is still a bit frightening, but at least she has the common sense to not make this trip in the dead of night. As she learns things, she uses this new knowledge to help her. She also asks for help. In most thrillers, the female lead usually lacks all of these traits. This, and the gravitas or her back story, help to give Caroline a resonance, a weight that we don't often see.<br /><br />Gena Rowlands, is, as always, good. Violet is the big question mark in the story. Is she involved in the sinister goings-on, or not? Generally, this type of character would have wild mood swings, one moment, she is evil incarnate, the next, sweet as pie. Thankfully, Rowlands plays it more subdued. What really helps the character is that she is presented as an old woman "set in her ways", "old-fashioned", "distraught over her husband's condition". Because of this, her character is more subtle and there are more shades of gray to all of her actions, which can be attributed to her "set-ways". Even when she is being nice to Caroline, she is a bit abrupt and when she is abrupt, we get a sense there is a shade of kindness. Rowland's performance aids the well-written character keeping us guessing what and if there is something lying underneath.<br /><br />John Hurt's performance is the trickiest because he uses almost no words throughout. The victim of a stroke, paralyzed on both sides, Ben can't move a muscle. But his eyes move, and they dart back and forth, or convey the anguish or terror he feels. At one point, Caroline is bathing him and gets soap in her eye, using a compact to make sure it is gone, she remembers Violet's admonition to keep mirrors out of the house "because they show the spirits walking throughout". Caroline opens the compact and places it in front of Ben's face. When she does this, Ben begins thrashing about. Finally, able to soothe him, Caroline apologizes. It really is amazing to experience all of these emotions through an actor who basically uses only his eyes throughout the performance.<br /><br />The film is very well-written and well-directed. Throughout, writer Kruger and director Softley give us clues, and even a few red herrings, but some of these are so well-hidden that we aren't able to piece everything together until the very end, when the secrets are revealed to Hudson's Caroline. At this point, your mind will click back to all of the clues and you will, hopefully, realize how clever everything is. The ending has a neat little twist, which I didn't see coming, but now that I know what it is, it all makes sense. How refreshing for a film to make sense, to connect the dots through the many layers of the story.<br /><br />Director Softley seems tailor made for this film. His last film "K-PAX" was a mess, but in "Key", he immerses us immediately in Caroline's world, starting the film without any credits of any kind. As we learn about Caroline's back-story, her character becomes more believable and real to us. After she arrives at the plantation, and is given the skeleton key, there are many shots of the interior of locks, as the key opens another door, and Caroline explores the house. This is an interesting metaphor for her learning secrets. The film is also remarkably free of the dumb thriller and horror film clich&eacute;s so rife in other examples. As mentioned, Caroline asks for help, looks around in the middle of the day, and learns. There are also few, if any cheap thrills generated by "stray black cats". There is one scene in which Caroline wakes up in the middle of the night and immediately jumps out of bed wearing only panties and a t-shirt to investigate a sound. If it were me, I would've thrown on a pair of sleep bottoms before running around in a large, dark plantation house. But these types of typical horror/ thriller movie clich&eacute;s are few and far between here.<br /><br />"The Skeleton Key" is a surprisingly well-written, acted and directed thriller complete with a clever twist which is well connected to the rest of the story.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>The Skeleton Key starring Kate Hudson is an interesting horror flick. I enjoyed this film very much, Hudson plays Caroline, she takes care of ill elders. She arrives at a house in New Orleans and strange things begin to happen to the man she is taking care of. A fantastic and scary performance by Gena Rowlands, who knew she could convel such an evil old lady so well. Watch out for the twist ending, didn't see that one coming. Hudson is great as always, she should do more of these types of films. I highly recommend The Skeleton Key!</p></br><a href="../users/A1FG91CM8221X1.html">A1FG91CM8221X1</a><br/><p>Iain Softley's "The Skeleton Key" is a deliciously creepy entertainment for a lazy afternoon or evening. Softley builds the story slowly, marinating us in the spooky atmosphere of a dilapidated Louisiana bayou mansion, until we're just as hypnotized as the hapless heroine. That heroine, played by Kate Hudson, comes to the house to help a tart-tongued old woman (Gena Rowlands) take care of her stroke-immobilized husband (John Hurt). From there, she gets far more embroiled than she'd like in the hoodoo-laced history of the house and its inhabitants. Working from a screenplay by Ehren Krueger ("The Ring"), Softley places the pieces of the story in jigsaw-puzzle fashion; the placement of the last piece knocks you for a loop with a surprise ending you'll be thinking about for days. Hudson--who has much of her mother's charm, plus a certain pizzazz all her own--gives a totally satisfying performance as the heroine; Hurt (in a nearly wordless performance) and Rowlands also are excellent, as is Peter Sarsgaard as the family lawyer. As with all good thrillers, "The Skeleton Key" messes with our minds, rather than our gag reflexes. If you're a fan of "The Twilight Zone" (the TV series, that is, not the movie), chances are you'll love this.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJPMB7N776WS.html">A1TJPMB7N776WS</a><br/><p>"The Skeleton Key" is a good thriller with an expert cast headed by Kate Hudson (Caroline), Gena Rowlands (Violet) and a mute John Hurt (Ben).<br /><br />Director Iain Softley (the stunning "Wings of a Dove") has a great eye for the grotesque and the beauty that lies therein and his mise en scene is cluttered with over-hanging Ivy, cataract-blinded country folk, crumbling mansions with scary attics, sweat-inducing humidity and back-woods depravity vs. upper crust, tuxedoed depravity in the bayou country just outside of New Orleans.<br /><br />There are also great big doses of Hoodoo thrown in to spice-up this boiling Gumbo of a movie but for once the attitude of the film, thanks to Softley and the amazing cast, is one of tolerance and respect: "The Skeleton Key" has the good sense to believe in it's own themes and characters and as a consequence it scares the hell out of us because, despite our better judgment... we start to buy into it also.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ROZK0G84RGMZ.html">A3ROZK0G84RGMZ</a><br/><p>Kate Hudson gives a great performance.  I kinda never paid attention to her work until this movie came along.  This movie is good.  I never expected it to be a spooky type of movie and it was'nt.  It was just an old style thriller with great atmosphere and great acting.  Gena Rowlands is excellent.  The story line is original and very interesting.  I hope a sequel will follow......It's time for my remedies!!!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A155KXFRZCA7C.html">A155KXFRZCA7C</a><br/><p>The acting is very good in this flick and also the photography is exceptional. The atmosphere is communicated well and it's a film that gets by with minimal special effects as most of the thrill is created with crackling doors, surprise images, increased music volume, etc. So it's scary in that sense that a thrill of tension is provided. The story is okay too and it keeps your mind occupied almost until the end.<br /><br />Is this movie really scary that you'll be haunted by it in your dreams? Probably not, although it's a somewhat haunting story. There are twists and turns, but most of them are predictable. The ending is okay, but in no way is it a radical twist that will knock you out of your socks. The story revolves around the Voodoo culture in Louisiana and takes place around a remote Antebellum home in the present time. It's like a ghost story and it's basically a good movie -- a nice surprise for the end of this summer's movie season that must have been one of the worst in motion picture history.<br /><br />I doubt it that this film will make it into my DVD collection, but it's a good flick to cool off after a hot summer day. As mentioned, the photography is very well done with some unique camera angles and there is constant tension which makes it a good thriller.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>I just got back from seeing The Skeleton Key starring the ever cute Kate Hudson. The first 90 minutes or so were good, but I would have given the film only 3 stars if it weren't for the ending. There are a couple of twists towards the end, but the final one is totally unexpected. I thought surprise endings were played out after all of the recent films that have tried to copy the Sixth Sense, but this one really caught me off guard. This film isn't scary in the least, but it is rather suspenseful, has great bayou locations, and Kate Hudson turns in a good performance. Worth checking out in theaters.</p></br><a href="../users/A28WJUJF6D2ULA.html">A28WJUJF6D2ULA</a><br/><p>Atmospheric on-screen southern Gothic sums up this film, as a health care worker, Caroline, played here by America's would-be sweetheart Kate Hudson, relocates from a corporate-managed, assembly line style New Orleans hospice, to a private position in a run-down old mansion in the country. She meets her suspicious, barely cordial employer, the aged Violet (Gena Rowlands)  and is shown the apparently delusional old man (John Hurt),  recent victim of a stroke, for whom she is to care.  There is also a charming but somehow peculiarly ever-present local lawyer who sympathizes with Caroline's unease at this assignment, while at the same time acting as a liaison between her and the subtly superstition Violet. Violet allows Caroline into her home and employ, but imposes some strange rules of conduct on her, foremost among these is that there are to be no mirrors in the house. Caroline undertakes her duties to the best of her ability, while at the same time she finds herself morbidly curious about the history of the gloomy old domicile, scene of past tragedy. Forbidden by Violet to enter the upstairs attic space, Caroline cannot resist doing just that after she comes into possession of an all-purpose skeleton key. And that, as they say, sets off a spooky chain reaction that takes us through the elements of hoodoo, kidnapping, and murder that unwind through the concluding half of the film. There is a twist ending, not on a par with The Sixth Sense or The Others, but a pretty good one, nonetheless, that I'll not give away here, only say that you might guess it before its revelation but if you do, that doesn't spoil the full implication of what exactly has long been going on inside that creepy old house in the bayous.</p></br><a href="../users/A3W13VVBRY5GL7.html">A3W13VVBRY5GL7</a><br/><p>"The Skeleton Key" starts off very, very promisingly: Kate Hudson, Geena Rowlands and Peter Sarsgaard are very fine actors, and director Iain Softley has proven himself with several behind-the-camera successes such as 'Hackers' and 'The Wings of the Dove'. It's got a compelling premise, a fine pedigree and next-to-no competition in the Haunted House Movie genre.<br /><br />What a shame, then, that after a very strong opening forty-five minutes, the movie wimps out and delivers a climax and resolution that could just as easily have belonged to any other substandard horror movie.<br /><br />Caroline Ellis (Hudson) is a jaded hospice nurse with a new job, caring for stroke victim Ben Deveraux (John Hurt, badly underused here) in his own home. She meets and befriends his wife Violet (Rowlands) and their attorney Luke (Saarsgard), and begins to learn something of the Hoodoo superstitions surrounding the house, as things start to go bump in the night.<br /><br />'The Skeleton Key' is beautiful to look at, for the most part - the rainy, washed-out colours of the Bayou remind you very much of horror masters like Hideo Nakata and David Lynch, and as the director, Softley creates a hugely atmospheric visual style with the claustrophobic and flashback elements of the screenplay. Hudson and Rowlands do very credible jobs in their respective roles as jaded young woman and superstitious wife, and the script, like the setting, is languid and slow, but never lacking in eventfulness. 'The Skeleton Key' starts great.<br /><br />And then, sadly, it all goes badly wrong. Without giving anything away, let me just explain that, had Violet never really explained the story of the house to Caroline, and just let events speak for themselves, we might have had some creepy ambiguity spun out of the atmospheric visuals and ambivalent script to create the fear for us. Instead, as with pretty much all the Hollywood horror movies of late, the script decides that no, the audience really must be stupid, so let's spell everything right out for them, just so's there's no confusion.<br /><br />And in a movie that propses to create fear and tension out of the hazy shades-of-grey between superstition and belief, this is a fatal mistake. The latter part of the movie, because it explains everything, pretty much holds up signs to the audience that read "Plot Twist Coming Soon!". It's disappointing, and made all the worse because of an essentially powerful beginning. Flashback scenes are showy and ring false, and the penultimate scenes could be seen coming from a million miles away.<br /><br />All in all, 'The Skeleton Key' isn't really worth owning, and should be thrown over at the video library if you see anything else you think you might like. Southern Gothic it is not, neither is it scary. A big disappointment, this one really could have been so much better.<br /><br />Avoid!</p></br><a href="../users/A3R36DZQEWNVJ1.html">A3R36DZQEWNVJ1</a><br/><p>Kate Hudson (Almost Famous, Le Divorce) takes a caretaking job for Gena Rowlands (Taking Lives, Hope Floats) whose husband, played by John Hurt (Love and Death On Long Island, Owning Mahoney), is sick and cannot talk. What Rowlands said was he was in the attic and then he stopped. Rowlands gives Hudson a Skeleton Key which opens every single door in the place. So, Hudson gets curious as one of the doors doesnt lock but when she gets into the room she finds strange things which look like Voo Doo but then one of her friends tells her about something called Hoo Doo, which is magic spells for protection. When Hudson finds out about the history of where she's working at and some eery secrets, she explores it more. Not a bad idea, ridiculous title and what was so big about the ending anyway? Some people said that the ending was very clever....clever? I hardly call it that....I call The Skeleton Key a muddled suspense mystery...this doesnt even have any scares in it...more like laughable scare moments. Also starring Peter Sarsgaard (Jarhead, Flightplan) whose cajun accent fades a lot in this movie...not an impressive one.</p></br><a href="../users/A30TK6U7DNS82R.html">A30TK6U7DNS82R</a><br/><p>It's nice that Kate Hudson isn't all skin and bones [...], and she looks properly zaftig in some scenes in which, as a nurse, she's required to carry big old John Hurt around the halls of a 30-room mansion and stagger with him as a dead weight around the rain-strewn grounds of the haunted Louisiana mansion where she works.  Kate is sort of good in the part, and afterwards we argued about whether or not she was miscast.  She just doesn't seem like to sort of idealist who gets upset that there's no one to care about the elderly people at the rest home whom, once they die, their things get thrown into the dumpster because their relatives don't care enough to come fetch the junk the deceased kept.<br /><br />Well, she's on some entirely different trip but if you could ignore her motivation, which a weak script fails to supply, or which an indifferent performance by stolid old Kate fails to supply, the movie does have some thrills and puzzles.  Actually Joy Bryant, who plays the black girlfriend, should have have the main part and Kate could have been the pleasure-seeking, hedonistic Bourbon Street dancing queen.  Even Goldie Hawn might have given her character more shadings, for to me, Caroline never really had enough hard evidence to make her take the extreme steps she did, and the whole back story about being too busy to take care of her own father and the way she let him die alone was making her feel guilty about dying men, was silly and an insult to our intelligence, but I can see why Ehren Kruger had to put it in for otherwise there would have been no story.  Or it would have seemed like a "Repulsion" sort of picture in which Kate Hudson's character was just going insane because of sexual repression and not enough dates with men.  And when the only man around is Peter Sarsgaard, a girl has to take care of herself especially if she saw him in FLIGHT PLAN.<br /><br />So why hasn't anyone complained that the movie is really nothing more than a copy cat rip off of the entire plot of BRIDE OF CHUCKY?<br /><br />Hope that isn't a spoiler, but if you've seen BRIDE OF CHUCKY you'll know every last secret of THE SKELETON KEY.</p></br><a href="../users/A10HMPPHWI3V0A.html">A10HMPPHWI3V0A</a><br/><p>I am absolutly, utterly sick of the same old horror movies coming out these days, especially American ones, to me all of them are very similar and there is very rarly a unique one relesed, Over the years (60's, 70's, 80's and even early 90's)there have been some really crazy horror films that are very different from anything ever seen before, I mean dont get me wrong I love horror films but they need to come up with some new ideas and stop making un-original and boring horror films as well as re-makes of classics .... so one thing that really excited me while seeing "Skeleton Key" was that I was watching something different, a new type of horror that was FINALLY after some years trying to do something different and unique maybe it can even be classified as a cult-ish type subject ... voodoo ,possestion ,spells, witchcraft all combined ....Overall I just really was happy about seeing something different.<br /><br />Another thing that bothers me about modern horror films is that they all end in the same way ... (about 95% of the time), and that is that the much weaker longshot winner good guy always walks away in the end victorious ... I'm an old grumpy person and every once in a while I like to see a unfortune ending, though the ending in "Skeleton Key" was unfortunate, there was more lieing there than just that, it was the puzzlement of the ending, the twist, the shocker,...

It's the age-old tale with a twist. Girl has nursing home job, girl quits nursing home job, girl applies for nursing job all the way out in new orleans.<br /><br />But, the big kicker is that the house in which she has to do the "caring" is at an old run down mansion where ghosts may or may not be haunting the grounds. What makes this movie natural is it's approach. You'd think that we would grow tired of the main character, but, in reality, the main character Caroline(Kate hudson) has the same views as the audience and does not believe in mystical voo-doo.<br /><br />What I liked about this film is the fact that you never knew what was going to happen next. The plot and dialogue, I have to say, was very chess-like. Be on the lookout for characters in this one who try to Outsmart each other with the information that they have and the information that they gain.<br /><br />Oh, but my true favorite is the ending of this movie. Totally unexpected and totally orginal.<br /><br />This is a movie you must see. It will definetly give you the willies!</p></br><a href="../users/AG0TA24LI0XV7.html">AG0TA24LI0XV7</a><br/><p>"The Skeleton Key" is one of those pleasant surprises in a movie, where everything works very well and the end result is a pleasure. I will not go into a boring synopsis of the main story as other reviewers always do (after all, these are reviews, not plot outlines).  And I will not spoil the ending for anyone who hasn't seen the film yet. I saw this movie expecting the typical ninety minutes of cheap thrills, and I was very wrong. When it was over I was dying to watch it again. The writing, atmosphere, and acting were dead on. I wish they made more creepy movies like this one. Good, spooky fun.</p></br><a href="../users/A2T049UQONS0OY.html">A2T049UQONS0OY</a><br/><p>I watched this with my wife the other night. She loves spooky flicks like this and developed goose flesh right away, almost in the first scene. I knew she was hooked by the supernatural elements of the movie. I wasn't as enthralled but stuck it out and had a pleasant surprise at the end.<br /><br />Briefly stated, "Skeleton Key" unlocks a lot of mystery and horror for the main players in this supernatural drama -- Goldie Hawn's daughter Kate Hudson, who plays a live in nurse; Gena Rowlands, who plays wife and matriarch to the patient, played by John Hurt; and Peter Sarsgaard who is their lawyer.<br /><br />Right after arriving, Hudson finds something is wrong in her new place of employment, an old Spanish moss laced mansion outside New Orleans. As the plot develops you learn the parties in the movie either practice or believe in something called hoodoo, a variant on voodoo. This is the source of the supernatural drama.<br /><br />Seems the (African American) caretakers in the house practiced hoodoo 90 years earlier with the children of the then homeowners. When the rich white parents and party guests found out, they lynched the caretakers. Or so it seemed, anyway.<br /><br />You dont find out what actually happened until the final apocalyptic scene in the film, where a truly unpredictable and exciting transformation takes place. You will clearly understand what's happened but you may not put it together with the caretakers from 90 years earlier.<br /><br />So, when you rent, buy or borrow this supernatural thriller, keep in mind at the end what happened 90 years earlier. By doing so, you'll be able to knock over all the dominoes in this involving, exciting and entertaining movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DRKVXO300RUE.html">A1DRKVXO300RUE</a><br/><p>This is a highly effective horror movie.  In short, a live-in aid/nurse takes a job at a very remote Louisiana home to care for an invalid, only to find out that the people are not what she expected, with an interesting voodoo twist thrown in.  A nearly constant mood of dread and eerieness is skillfully maintained throughout, and the ending/climax is well orchestrated with a few good twists.  Good acting, a good script and strong production values.  Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A2SLA0SXRQV8M0.html">A2SLA0SXRQV8M0</a><br/><p>This is an intelligent and unusual supernatural thriller. Set in pre-Katrina New Orleans and the Mississippi Delta (there is an excellent use of its locations), it stars Kate Hudson as a caregiver who is given the job of nursing the invalid husband (John Hurt, who, playing a recent stroke victim, doesn't speak a word in the whole film) of Gena Rowlands, who live in a creepy old house in an old plantation. Soon it becomes clear that the Hurt character knows something terrible that he is unable to say. This is only the beginning of a very creepy, unsettling thriller. There is a very intelligent final twist, that holds up on second viewing (many viewers, I suspect, will not get the twist on first viewing). I don't remember seeing such twist in a movie before, but in its supernatural implications (in the possibility it holds in someone switching bodies), it is reminiscent of a nifty H. G. Wells story, the Story of the Late Mr. Evelsham.</p></br><a href="../users/A2JP0URFHXP6DO.html">A2JP0URFHXP6DO</a><br/><p>Skeleton Key is one of the more surprising thriller/chillers that has come along in quite some time.  Kate Hudson is Caroline, a nursing student who leaves a job at a nursing home to take a position in a home health care environment, deep in the Louisiana Bayou.  She comes to the old, southern home of the Devereaux's. This is one of those overgrown, mossy, humid, stifling old homes.  Her patient Ben played by John Hurt is an invalid who has suffered a major stroke and cannot talk or walk.  Gena Rowlands is his wife Violet, a rather abrupt woman who doubts that Caroline can handle the job.  Also in the mix is the Devereaux's attorney Luke who actually hired Caroline.<br /><br />Immediately Caroline notices several strange things about the old mansion.  First, there are no mirrors in the house at all.  Violet brushes off Caroline's questions about this.  Second, Caroline gets a skeleton key that unlocks every door in the house.  While exploring the old attic, she finds a door hidden behind a shelf but the key will not unlock that door.  Again Violet dismisses her, saying the key has never worked on that door and they've never opened it in all the years they've been at the house.  Add to that, Ben seems to be trying to communicate with Caroline, asking for help.<br /><br />Eventually opening that door in the attic, Caroline discovers off books and items, and old records which seem to be intoning magical rituals.  Her friend Jill, a native of the bayou explains this as "hoodoo" an old African magic that only works if you believe in it.  Violet finally admits that many years ago two black servants were caught practicing this magic and were killed by the man they worked for and that the room in the attic was theirs.  Caroline becomes convinced that Ben is under the influence of this magic and is determined to try and help him and soon finds herself entangled in a deadly plot of ancient magic.<br /><br />Skeleton Key relies heavily on its permeable atmosphere and does so very effectively.  The frights are mostly shrouded and hinted at in very Lovecraftian style.  Rowlands is terrific as the slightly sinister mistress with deep secrets hidden away.  Hurt, playing primarily a role with very little dialog is also great.  He conveys more with his eyes and expressions than many actors could with their voices.  Other than perhaps being just a bit predictable, Skeleton Key is a nice little thriller.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tim Janson</p></br><a href="../users/A2PN7Z2VTHICL8.html">A2PN7Z2VTHICL8</a><br/><p>Caroline Ellis (played expertly by Kate Hudson) is a hospice nurse, who, sick of the "assembly-line" treatment of the gravely ill in the nursing homes, accepts a job to care for an elderly stroke victim in a private manor house out in the fecund bayou of New Orleans.  Hired by a lawyer named Luke (Peter Sarsgaard, 'Shattered Glass' and 'The Cell'), Caroline meets with Violet and Ben Devereaux (Stunning performances from Gena Rowlands and John Hurt).  Ben is completely incapacitated from having a stroke in the attic of the old house, and Violet is a no-nonsense woman who acknowledges the need of someone to help her out but prefers her isolation.<br /><br />Caroline takes the job and moves in, taking instructions from Violet on her "remedies" for Ben.  Caroline finds it odd that there are no mirrors in the house, but Violet passes it off as old people not needing any reminders of age.  Even as Caroline attempts to settle into the decrepit and yet intriguing old house, strange events begin to happen.  Ben attempts an escape, somehow managing to get through his window and fall to the ground below.<br /><br />Violet begins to slowly reveal some of the area, and the house's, secrets to Caroline as she warms up to her, telling her tales of HooDoo, a black-heritage form of magic similar to VooDoo.  Violet assures Caroline that HooDoo only works if the victim `believes' in it, but Caroline notices signs of HooDoo protection spells all over the Devereaux's property.<br /><br />Caroline becomes involved deeper and deeper into the sinister and disturbing setting of the old plantation house, and with her skeleton key that will open every door, eventually discovers the part of the attic where Ben had his stroke, and the frightening oddities inside.  Caroline knows that there is something wrong inside the house, and something wrong with Violet's explanation of Ben's illness.  Caroline, having failed to help her father when he was ill, vows to do everything she can to help Ben.<br /><br />'Skeleton Key' is a beautifully creepy movie, set deep in the mysterious bayou lands, using the backdrop of swamps and an outstandingly dark and unique plantation house to set the atmospherically sinister environment for this tale of understated terror.  There is no gore, but what the film lacks in blood it makes up for in spookiness.<br /><br />If you are looking for an intense psychological thriller with a large dose of black magic and a wonderfully twisted ending, then make sure you pick up a copy of 'Skeleton Key'.  Definitely worth a purchase rather than rental.<br /><br />Don't forget to watch the special features on HooDoo vs VooDoo, and the real life story behind the plantation house where 'Skeleton Key' was filmed.  Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A1B05INWIDZ74O.html">A1B05INWIDZ74O</a><br/><p>The cast did a wounderful job starting with Kate Hudson as Caroline, Gena Rolands as Violet and John Hurt as Ben.  John Hurt had the most challenging role. His character Ben is not able to talk in this movie yet we can see the anguish and fear he is trying to show us. Best job of the lot.<br /><br />The film is well written and directed. We are given enough clues throughout the movie to figure out what is happening. But not enough to ruin the suspense. This is one of the few movies I almost had to wait for the end to know what was going on. The story knows how to keep us on the edge of the seat in suspense. And when the end finally does come. We are offerred an extra bang for our dollar when it all makes sense. You will finally see the string of clues that lead to the very ending. Though I must admit you really have to pay attention to figure it before they show you. Good luck, it is worth it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MNMZMM6BGLTA.html">A2MNMZMM6BGLTA</a><br/><p>I didn't expect much but liked it.

The other actors did a well job themselves and the storyline was not confusing to follow. The plot itself is interesting and different, which is always a good thing.

I've noticed some horror movies make it too easy in the end, and some just make it too hard to understand. This movie fell nicely in the middle, so this movie gets a good four stars from me.<br /><br />I recommend it to people to at least watch once- I have a feeling many other horror fans will like the movie as well.</p></br><a href="../users/A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z.html">A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z</a><br/><p>This film is what I would personally classify as more in the horror camp, than in the Supernatural Thriller. The film is unsurprisingly great. The Extras are the definitive element for this  package.<br /><br />The film is basically Body Jumping. If, in my view, the film makers had included more of the material that spooks in LOST SOULS, or even the scarey elements of CONSTANTINE, I probably would like it even more. However, the film makers focus on this being a "Supernatural Thriller" film.<br /><br />The detail in this film is beyond good. All of the Hoodoo and Voodoo elements are the real deal, which is something lacking in some films ( The makeup artists even used protection spells in the trailers).<br /><br />The film shows great details in and around the now "Old" New Orleans. The story is one to be experienced ... certainly, what you don't believe cannot hurt you ... but ??<br /><br />THE EXTRAS: The production features are beyond good. Plenty of detail about what has been done. Even the elements about the background of the film are so superb. The commentary done by the director is masterful, and great exposition. The very nice extras are stories from the leads, who give part of themselves in showing what they have behind the characters of the film.<br /><br />Contrary to what the director says, the pivotal character is not Kate Hudson, but it is John Hurt ...Kate is practically the quiet eye at the center of the storm, but John is part of the storm, and in many respects the reason for the storm.<br /><br />Masterful film ...

The film was a flop at the box office but I think will do good in video. The film has a good story about a women who nurses an ild man in a old southern house that holds deadly seacrets. the movie is not scary and has no jump moments but it's just suspsnfull and spooky. The film has good acting and direction. The downfall is the twist I did not know if it was good or bad and mad me think( I think people will either hate ot love the ending). Overall it was a good spooky suspensfull film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1POFVVXUZR3IQ.html">A1POFVVXUZR3IQ</a><br/><p>A couple of things make this movie a worthwhile addition to the horror/thriller genre: one - the beautiful cinematography that brings to life the creepy lushness of the Louisiana Bayou, two - some very good supporting roles, by Gena Rowlands [the creepy old hag, Violet Devereaux], and John Hurt [as the invalid Ben, Violet's husband], & finally three - the central theme of hoodoo wch is a kind of folk magic. That being said, the story itself centers around the character of Caroline [Kate Hudson] who is engaged as a young caregiver to Ben. She is a stay-at-home nurse, and so has to not only put up with Violet's eccentric character, but also with the spooky atmosphere of the old house she now inhabits with all its sinister undertones. The plot itself is quite interesting...Caroline suspects that Violet is deliberately harming her husband, Ben, and also that hoodoo is involved, so she delves deeper into the subject. She also tries to enlist the help of Violet's family lawyer, Luke [Peter Sarsgaard in a ho-hum role] to help solve the mystery. Let's just say that Caroline finds her cynicism in hoodoo challenged by some of her experiences, and the rest of the movie deals with the aftermath of her involvement with the Deveraux couple. Kate Hudson does not seem to be able to get into her character here, just the usual expressions of fear/puzzlement/bravado, and in my opinion, gives a lacklustre performance. Only Gena Rowlands as the menacing Violet and John Hurt as the helpless Ben lend credence to their roles. The scary effects are few and far between but there is a sense of menace and evil thanks to the way the scenes are set up. The plot twists too will keep viewers interested to know what's coming next. Final verdict: an average thriller dealing with the supernatural ,but definitely worth a look.</p></br><a href="../users/AIMR915K4YCN.html">AIMR915K4YCN</a><br/><p>THE SKELETON KEY reminds me of those old, classic creepers like BURNT OFFERINGS, THE LEGACY, THE SENTINEL, etc. It has that heavy sense of building dread and doom going on. Kate Hudson is Caroline, the young innocent brought into circumstances beyond her control. She goes to work in the isolated home of Violet (Gena Rowlands) and her paralyzed husband (John Hurt). All is somewhat normal, until Caroline finds a hidden door in the attic. That's when the weirdness begins! Caroline begins to suspect that something is wrong, but her rational mind won't let her accept what she fears might be happening. Her suspicions lead her deeper into the personal lives and history of the former residents of the old manor. The rest is a spooky mystery involving murder,  greed, and a supernatural plot that brings the tale to it's dark, twisty grand final&eacute;.

Hoodoo is an old African American magic that only works if you believe in it.) is at play in this southern thriller. Who knew from Voodoo? Caroline Ellis,(Kate Hudson) is a hospice worker who has thought about nursing school and who takes a job as a live-in caretaker in a sinister, decrepit plantation house located deep in the Louisiana Delta. This is a movie that purveys the darkness of the delta within the spectacular views of New Orleans before Katrina.  Brings back memories to all of us. Caroline gradually discovers that nothing is as it first seemed, the old man is being held prisoner against his will, the house is possessed by voodoo spirits, and she  may be trapped by their evil spell.  Gena Rolwands plays Violet Devereaux. She inches her character ever closer to going over the top before reining her back in at the last moment. We believe that she is evil personified. Her husband, Ben Devereaux, is played by John Hurt. He has suffered a stroke and cannot speak or move. He is able to convey via his eyes the menacing horrow that is his, and Caroline Ellis is bound to save him. His acting via his eyes and facial expression is superb. Kate Hudson does a memorable job of playing this role, and her talent for acting is noted. This is a thriller that kept my interest. I was not prepared for the shocking ending, but was not surprised. This is not a movie that would have a so-so ending. This is one of the better thrillers in a while, and is certainly worth your time. The views of New Orleans before the Storm are worth viewing the entire movie and is more that worth your time.<br /><br />This is a movie of characterization, IMO. Each character brings the suspense and moodiness that is needed to sustain the movie.  Gena Rowlands, as always steals the scenes but John Hurt and Kate Hudson more than keep up their end. Voodoo/Hoodoo, all the same, brings the magic to this movie.

It isn't all too suspenseful, either.  What it is, however, is a wonderful mystery tale laced with superstition, that grand Southern culture, and a refreshingly surprising ending.  The story starts out in New Orleans where Caroline(Kate Hudson) is a hospice worker who's grown tired of the "business" of helping people die a nice and easy death.  She takes a job deep in the bayous of Terrebonne Parish at a home where an elderly man, John Hurt, and his wife, Gena Rowlands, live together.  Hurt's character has supposedly suffered a stroke, and Hudson is hired to help him down that last highway in life.<br /><br />Things start to get peculiar when Hudson opens up a room in the attic with her skeleton key.  In it, she is introduced to the sometimes spooky, sometimes bizarre world of hoodoo.  As the rest of the story unfolds, Hudson starts to think that Hurt is actually under some sort of curse and wants her to help him escape his mute and aging prison.<br /><br />I have to admit that the twisted conclusion of this flick caught me by surprise.  Early revelations in the film become clear and, to a degree, very morbid.  There isn't a lot of "BOO!" scares in this flick, nor is there any gore(excepting a little bit of blood and a couple of broken legs).  This flick is simply a good little horror tale that doesn't end up with a bunch of sex-crazed teens getting hacked up or a couple of Asian ghosts making creepy noises.<br /><br />The location helps the story role along rather well.  Being from Louisiana, I've been in a few spots in the woods near my home that just naturally give off an uneasy feeling.  Throw in the hoodoo aspect, and you make the atmosphere that much creepier.<br /><br />Perhaps it deserves three-and-a-half stars more than four, but it is much better than the bulk of the so-called horror flicks these days.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R2ONSLAI3M2X.html">A1R2ONSLAI3M2X</a><br/><p>Living in Louisiana myself, I was excited to see this film.

It's a straight horror film that works far more on atmosphere than actual jumps (though the fan of jump moments will certainly get a few in here), the kind of thing that, as with extreme horror, has had America lagging about a decade behind Japan's horror film industry. Thank your lucky stars, however, that an enterprising group finally landed a deal with Universal, because The Skeleton Key is good stuff, one of the better pieces of horror celluloid to come out of Hollywood in a lot of years.<br /><br />The story concerns Caroline Ellis (Almost Famous' Kate Hudson, who as she gets older looks more and more like Jill Hennessy-- and this is a good thing), a young hospice care worker, disillusioned with the state-run home she's been working for. She accepts a private job about an hour outside New Orleans caring for Ben (John Hurt, absent from horror films for far too long), who had a stroke about a month before she comes on the scene. Ben's wife Violet (Gena Rowlands) doesn't take to Caroline at first; it takes the intervention of the family lawyer, Luke (Peter Sarsgaard, of Jarhead and Boys Don't Cry fame), to convince Caroline to stay on. By the time weird things start happening in the famously haunted house, Caroline has already grown too attached to Ben to leave.<br /><br />The movie is not without its shortcomings, which cannot be revealed without spoilers, but which will be readily obvious to most viewers starting about three-quarters of the way through the film. They are not, however, enough to counterbalance the movie's wonderfully-done atmosphere, fine performances by all main cast members, and a general sense of foreboding. Even better, you'll be spending a couple of hours after the movie sporadically stopping and saying "oh, so THAT's what that scene was about!"<br /><br />A fine piece, and well worth watching. *** ?</p></br><a href="../users/A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ.html">A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ</a><br/><p>Halfway though this movie, I remember everything I had heard in reviews and that it had been slammed by critics and everybody else.  Everybody said it was slow and had a great payoff.<br /><br />Halfway through watching it... I remembered and they were right.  Although, the overall reviews that I remembered were wrong. The ending to this movie made the entire package worthwhile and actually worth watching twice.<br /><br />I went to rent movies. My girlfriend said, "Don't get Skelton Key, I heard it was terrible." I got it anyway and strangely enough, we decided to watch it. By the end of the movie, we were glad we watched it.<br /><br />I won't give away too much, but I will say that the movie is about a girl looking for a life change, looking to take on some responsibilities of her own. She begins to take care of a bed-ridden man and his wife in a mysterious house with a mysterious attic and a mysterious room.<br /><br />Voodoo and mystery give this movie its life but throughout the heart of the movie, it sort of drug... where are we going here? But, once you get to the end of the movie, you'll realize that all that slow going had a reason.<br /><br />This movie had the presence, confidence and dare I say BALLS to be different in a slew of run of the mill movies. It dared to be vague so that the surprise ending WOULD BE A SURPRISE and not be given away too soon.<br /><br />It could have strayed into the unreal and COMMERCIAL in order to please bored audiences, but it stuck to its guns, knowing that the ending would be the payoff and they were right.<br /><br />All I can say is, don't watch this movie with a critical eye, it will do no good. Watch it, absorb it, follow it and you will not be disappointed. If you do that, you will most likely gasp like my girlfriend and I did when the ending delivers its knockout blow.</p></br><a href="../users/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ.html">A12X2J7AVZ04IQ</a><br/><p>This film was entertaining; everytime I thought I knew what was going on, something else happened. Very entertaining. I won't blab away the plot, but Kate Hudson is solid in, what I think, is her first lead role. She handles it with fierce conviction. It helps that she had to deal with the champions, Gena Rowlands and John Hurt. Peter Saarsgard is, as usual, confident and in control. Director Iain Softley handled this film well, and the DVD offers generous extras. It was well thought-out, and the casting of the great Gena Rowlands and the great John Hurt are reason enough to see this film. Don't get me wrong, Hudson is terrific, as is Joy Bryant, as Hudson's friend who knows more than she cares to tell. Fun movie. Check it out.</p></br><a href="../users/A1V3IO23FZFF9L.html">A1V3IO23FZFF9L</a><br/><p>At first I thought that this movie was gonna be a dumb, not at all scary horror/thriller film. By the end, the movie turns into a pretty entertaining movie with a pretty smart ending. The acting is as good as it can be coming from Hudson. An entertaining film from the Big Easy.</p></br></body></html>

In the tradition of WHAT LIES BENEATH and GOTHIKA it makes for an entertaining ride.  Keep in mind, however, there is a difference between a horror movie & a ghost story.<br /><br />As with all Jennifer Connelly movies, the best feature of this one is........er........Jennifer Connelly.  She's my favorite actress and she could make a bad movie look good.  She can also make a good movie better, which she does here.  For all I care, Jennifer Connelly could become the supreme commander of the universe and I would greet the news with enthusiasm!<br /><br />As for the story, it is rather slow moving.  That's not necessarily a bad thing, but don't watch this one expecting things to be constantly happening.  One of the biggest differences between a ghost story & horror film is suspense.  Ghost stories tend to have a lot of it, whereas horror flicks have little or no suspense.<br /><br />If you like  Jennifer Connelly and / or ghost themes, this one is worth checking out.  Besides Connelly, the rest of the supporting cast is quite good also.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IUI3CJUMB7J0.html">A1IUI3CJUMB7J0</a><br/><p>In the tradition of The Ring and The Grudge come Dark Water. The movie tanked at the box office and the trailers did not look good but I wanted to see it to see if it was scary and it was not. The movie is on the boarder lione of beeing a good movie and a bad movie. The good stuff the acting is good, the story is ok and it builds up lots making you think there will be scary moments and a good ending but your wrong. The movie builds up to nothing it's just a dissapointing ending. There are many pointltss parts and charactors to this movie. It's not scary and not worth the watch.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EIK4L9730WWJ.html">A2EIK4L9730WWJ</a><br/><p>Dark Water kept me at the edge of your seat and i like that they use the supernatural side.... Jennifer Connelly stars as a mother that moves into a apartment that is haunted by little girl that ends up dying in a huge water tank on top of a roof of a apartment complex!!!!!!!! I thought that this movie had a great plot and i liked the storyline!!!!!! A lot of people said that this movie sucked and had no story.... So if you like supernatural thrillers then check this movie out!!!!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A2PN7Z2VTHICL8.html">A2PN7Z2VTHICL8</a><br/><p>When beautiful Dahlia (Jennifer Connolly) goes through an ugly divorce and custody battle with ex-husband Kyle (Dougray Scott) over their daughter Ceci (Ariel Gade), she decides to move to Roosevelt Island in order to live closer to the best school for their daughter.  Kyle doesn't care for Dahlia's decision but is unable to stop her from moving into a horrid and weirdly disturbing rent-controlled apartment complex, sprawling and psychologically dark.<br /><br />John C. Reilly plays landlord Mr. Murray, an overzealous and officious man who prefers to avoid problems with the large complex once pushing the hard sell to its tenants.  He repeatedly passes off Dahlia's problems to the building's super, Mr. Veeck (played by Pete Postlehwaite), a cantankerous old man without an ounce of friendliness and more than a little odd.<br /><br />In Dahlia's tiny, dilapidated apartment, in spite of recent paint and both Veeck and Murray's promise of considerable work done, the ceiling in the bedroom begins leaking dark and murky water.  Veeck blames it on two juvenile delinquents who break into the empty apartment above and vandalize it.  Then Ceci's new teacher (played by Camryn Manheim) informs Dahlia that Ceci has an 'imaginary friend' and is becoming antisocial within the classroom.<br /><br />Ceci's behavior inside the darkly unsettling complex becomes more and more bizarre, leading Dahlia to discover an unlocked door to a roof without a railing and a rusted water tower menacing the filthy rooftop.  Dahlia starts to wonder why she is having dark dreams, dreams of her own childhood, and why Ceci is infatuated with 'Nastasha', the girl who lives upstairs.<br /><br />But the apartment upstairs is empty and flooded with gruesomely fetid water, the same water leaking into Dahlia's apartment, so Dahlia forces Veeck to tell her the truth about the absent family from above.<br /><br />'Dark Water' is a very good psychological thriller.  The performances of Jennifer Connolly and Dougray Scott (two of my favorites), along with Pete Postlethwaite, Camryn Manheim, and John C. Reilly are exceptional, their talents bringing justice to the dilapidated and unforgiving eeriness of the apartment complex.<br /><br />The nastiness of the unclean water is presented so expertly that I could actually smell its foulness.  Dahlia's slide into depression and anxiety is very well portrayed as she questions her own sanity in the mess that has enveloped her and Ceci's lives.  The overall creepiness of this movie definitely deserves five stars, along with the photography, script, editing, and director Walter Salles.<br /><br />'Dark Water' is not the fast paced gore-fest us horror aficionado's enjoy, but the stealthy and creeping terror of unstable minds, decrepit architecture, a slow slide into madness, and the unworldly forces of the dead pushing their way into our lives.  A nice surprise awaits you at the film's conclusion, also.  I definitely believe this movie is worth a purchase.  Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>It all begins inside Apartment 9F. This is where a single mother, Dahlia Williams, is trying to make a brand-new start in life. Attempting to escape from a bitter custody battle with her estranged husband, Dahlia moves with her daughter Ceci to a dilapidated, sprawling housing block on Roosevelt Island at the very edges of New York City. This movie has plenty of creepy moments, but not any satisfying jolts.</p></br><a href="../users/A32XW50ILWOXNO.html">A32XW50ILWOXNO</a><br/><p>"Dark Water" is a beautiful, dreary mood piece that wanders around for 90 depressing minutes before it decides it better tell us what in the world's going on. And then it ends. Depressingly. Well, A-plus for consistency.<br /><br />Dahlia (Jennifer Connelly) has recently divorced Kyle (Dougray Scott) and moved with her daughter Ceci (Ariel Gade) to a remote, modernist apartment complex on Roosevelt Island in New York City. Dahlia is troubled, near-broke, jilted. Ceci is a cute, opinionated child who wants nothing to do with the apartment until she looks a dark leak in the ceiling and has one of those ghost-induced changes of heart.<br /><br />Who's the ghost? How will it influence Ceci? Why is Dahlia having nightmares about her deadbeat mother? Why are the landlord (John C. Reilly) and superintendent (Pete Postlehewaite) constantly telling Dahlia to call the other to fix her leak? Why does Dahlia's lawyer (Tim Roth) lie about having a family? Will it ever stop raining? Some of these questions have answers. Some of these questions are just used to maintain the movie's disquieting tone.<br /><br />Rafael Yglesias' screenplay works from Hideo Nakata's original movie; like Nakata's "Ring" series, "Dark Water" concentrates on a single mother and her weird kid in a threatening environment as several subplots - what's with all the scenes at the elementary school? - are designed to go nowhere, and indeed don't. That doesn't make them any more satisfactory.<br /><br />Walter Salles deserves credit for his artful direction - he darkens the edges of the frame and employs long shots to heighten Dahlia's isolation and dawning madness -  and discredit for forgetting to make a dramatic film that fails most of all at its blink-and-it's-over climax. As for Connelly - she's already traveled this territory in "House of Sand and Fog" and "Requiem for a Dream." Yes, she falls apart as well as any actress. But again? Roth and Reilly are paying their electric bills, and the kid acts like an alien.<br /><br />"Dark Water" is one visually sumptuous, meditative, trembling blah, blah, blah of a thing. Horror? Norror.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R2ONSLAI3M2X.html">A1R2ONSLAI3M2X</a><br/><p>When this movie came out on DVD, I was anxious to see it. After a couple of weeks of always being rented out at my local video store, I finally got my hands on it. The whole movie centers around a woman ( played by Jennifer Connelly ) and her daughter who move to a old, run down apartment because that is all they can afford. Dahlia's soon to be ex-husband is not happy with this idea for it will interfere with his visitations with his daughter. After moving into the building, the roof in the bedroom starts constantly dripping dark water, when faucets are turned on, out comes dark water. At times, this movie can get boring. However, there are some tense, suspenseful moments in the film. We all know that Dahlia's daughter is seeing the ghost of a little girl who once lived and died there. The ending of the film was the best part with us seeing the sacrafice a mother will make for her child. It was quite sad at the end. Overall, not a bad movie to watch. The acting was good and it's worth the money to rent it.</p></br><a href="../users/A387BD735MI50R.html">A387BD735MI50R</a><br/><p>I found this to be an engrossing, eerie film. It is set in a place I didn't even know existed - Roosevelt Island in the middle of the Hudson River, just a short ski-lift-like "tram" ride from Manhattan proper. This location, so near and yet so far from the normal workaday world, sets the tone of the movie beautifully.<br /><br />The acting is excellent throughout. Pete Postlethwaite is especially good as the building maintenance man - who may or may not be dangerous. Ariel Gade, the prescient little girl, really made the film for me though. She had an unusual core of wise adult quietude about her that gave her a sensitivity to her new atmosphere. She wasn't the average modern child, distracted with constant trivial wantings and whinings. So she brought a Victorian, 'Turn of the Screw' supernatural intensity to her role.<br /><br />The most unrealistic element of the plot though was the behavior of Jennifer Connelly's attorney. He was actually available to her and sympathetic to her case. Where do you find lawyers like that? I can never even get my lawyer on the phone.</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>This one didn't work for me.  While I enjoyed the first Ring somewhat, and thought the Grudge was creepy, this latest import didn't have any scares for me.  I didn't find it creepy at all, and the ending was rather sappy for my taste.  The Jennifer Connelly character did not invoke sympathy for me.  Decent performances from everyone, though I wasn't blown away by any of the actors.  I would save this for a rental or maybe even the showing on cable.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>I actually saw "Honogurai mizu no soko kara," the 2002 Japanese horror film  (2002) that director Hideo Nakata made from K?ji Suzuki's novel I saw this 2005 American remake.  Things have been breaking even for me in that regard when it comes to the recent spate of Japanese ghost stories, what with the "Ringu" films and "Ju-on."  Of course it is a crap shoot as to whether or not you get to see the better version first.  With "Dark Water" I think the American version by director Walter Salles ("Diarios de motocicleta") is a slightly better made film, but I really liked the coda to the Japanese version more than the "happy" ending of this one ("happy" being very much a relative term under the circumstances).<br /><br />Screenwriter Rafael Yglesias succeeds in Westernizing the story so that viewers unfamiliar with the rules of Japanese ghost stories can get into the spirit of things.  Dahlia Williams (Jennifer Connelly) is recently divorced from Kyle (Dougray Scott) and in a bitter custody battle for their young daughter, Ceci (Ariel Grade), so she moves into an apartment on the ninth floor of an rather dilapidated building on Roosevelt Island.  Dahlia tells Kyle it is because the place is too blocks from a good school, but it is really because it is all she can afford.  Maybe she believes all the shameless salesmanship of the landlord (John C. Reilly) because she has to, but one look at Veeck (Pete Postlethwaite), the building's super, and we know that the place is a hellhole.<br /><br />Kyle claims that Dahlia is an unfit mother because she is mentally unstable.  Does he really think this is true or is it simply gamesmanship?  For that matter, does he really want his daughter or is it payback because Dahlia did not like the fact he is living with another woman?  This is vitally important because divorce in America is the norm, whereas in Japan it is much rarer and has decidedly different cultural significance for the characters.  So "Dark Water" plays off against our personal reservoir of divorce horror stories, cinematic or otherwise.  But Dahlia has a more immediate concern: there is a leak in the bedroom ceiling that is dripping black water.  Veeck refuses to fix it and Dahlia begins to wonder what is happening in the apartment above her own that would cause the water spot on the ceiling, especially as it grows bigger and more ominous.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Ceci's new teacher (Camryn Manheim), is concerned that she is ignoring the rest of the kids in class to play with her imaginary friend whose name is Natasha.  Dahlia becomes concerned too when she learns that a young girl named Natasha lived in the building.  Kyle is moving ahead with suing for full custody, forcing Dahlia to hire a new lawyer, Jeff Platzer (Tim Roth), who works out of his car.  By this point in the film everyone and everything is a potential threat to Dahlia, both in terms of her sanity and with regards to her protecting her daughter.  However, in the end, "Dark Water" comes down to Dahlia having to make a choice, and it is only in the shift in her motivation that the climax of this film loses some of its power compared to the original (the prologue does not come into play as much as it should at the end given the story changes)..<br /><br />For what would still be considered a horror film even if it is more psychological than supernatural for the most part, "Dark Water" has a first-rate cast.  Connelly's best moment usually involve the look in her eyes and nothing she has to say, and casting Grade as her daughter was extremely fortuitous.  Postlethwaite is creepy from start to finish, Reilly does a marvelous job of playing against his previous roles by being so positive, and the almost unrecognizable Roth turns in an outstanding character study as the surprisingly compassionate and competent lawyer.  When a cast can offer the likes of Scott and Manheim in minor roles, you know there is a high bottom to the talent level.  Cinematographer Affonso Beato and composer Angelo Badalamenti create the atmosphere for the horror film, more so than the special effects with all of the titular fluid at the climax, which also speaks to this being an above average horror film and therefore worthy of being checked out.</p></br><a href="../users/A146D2LYLICNLS.html">A146D2LYLICNLS</a><br/><p>Roger Ebert recently said that Jennifer Connelly needs to "lighten up" in terms of what roles she's been choosing, as she has played one unstable and depressed character after another lately (ie: "House of Sand and Fog"). But I think Ebert's comment is unfounded, because this type of role is what Jennifer Connelly excels at. She's one of the VERY rare actresses in Hollywood who has pure talent in addition to being beautiful. I admire the fact that she has been choosing roles that showcase her abilities rather than going the easy way and starring in movies that will gross millions of dollars but limit her acting to "looking pretty for the camera" and not much else.<br /><br />"Dark Water" is the latest example of Jennifer Connelly's superb acting and ability to fully become the character she is playing, in this case a troubled mother still dealing with her own abusive childhood. This movie is much more of a psychological thriller than a "slasher" thriller, although that's pretty obvious going by the trailer. The isolated, ugly and dreary apartment complex adds nicely to the overall gloomy feel of the film. And of course there's the dark water which appears virtually everywhere: on the ceiling, in the toilet, even in the washing machine. I admit that it was slightly overdone, but it doesn't take away from the movie either. Another thing worth mentioning is the music, which perfectly captures the tone of the movie. I recommend getting the soundtrack score.<br /><br />I don't give "Dark Water" 5 stars because it borrows a little too much from other films such as "The Ring" which other reviewers have mentioned. I also found the ending to be too "cookie-cutter" and safe. There were no real surprises. A nice unexpected plot twist would have turned this into a truly great film. But I've said it before and I'll say it again: Jennifer Connelly makes it worth seeing. Can't wait for the DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/A391YPR0NFTCLK.html">A391YPR0NFTCLK</a><br/><p>She was so brillant in this film. Its so good, its very mature and artys thats why people don't like it. And yes its like THE RING because DARK WATER inspired the it! So can people say that THE RING is like DARK WATER not the other way around. (DARK WATER and THE RING were both Japanese remakes if you did not know. But Connelly's work her rivals her work in A BEAUTIFUL MIND and REQUIEM FOR A DREAM. Go see this if you are a mature adult that likes intelligent psychological dramas, don't see this if you are a stupid teen looking for a teen horror date film. Its much more than that and it is a great film!</p></br><a href="../users/A268EEWUXYCA8Q.html">A268EEWUXYCA8Q</a><br/><p>Dark Water is an interesting beast.  As a familial drama it is superb.  It is filled with familiar and every day horrors, drama and tension that one would go through if she found herself divorced with no money and a child.  This is where the film is at the top of its game.  The fear is palpable and Jennifer Connely shows us once again why she is a leading actress of considerable talent.<br /><br />Like in her last great film, House of Sand and Fog, Connely's character is completely isolated and she is really good and showing that isolation and desperation.  You can tell when she picks her apartment that she knows she shouldn't live there but feels trapped by many different constraints.  It is here that the creepy characters effectively create more tension as you never really know the aims and goals of them.<br /><br />Adding to the familial drama is a social and economic drama of living in the apartment.  It creates a downpour of tension that is squeezed out of every frame.  Bad things will occur in this place, you can tell.  Then with the ominous leak in the cieling above the protagonists' beds and the brackish water, the viewer will feel oppressed just as much as Connely and her child.<br /><br />It is here that the movie falters and eventually falls apart.  Like I said, the movie is great as a familial drama, but it is also a ghost story.  But in this case, the ghost story takes the background as opposed to the fore front.  And it's unfortunate because instead of enriching the tension, it detracts.  The ghost story isn't fully fleshed out, partly due to the fact that the story is more enveloped with the drama and spends more time developing that.  In the beginning it works semi-well.  The water holds supernatural foreboding and the flashbacks and nightmares adds to it.  But as a ghost story mystery, which the movie tries to be, it takes its first faltering step.<br /><br />From there, horror film cliches pop up.  An invisible friend, the protagonist feared to be losing her mind, elevators that move on their own, ghostly noises and visages, etc etc.  Granted, some of it, particularly the protagonist feared to be losing her mind, is done exceedingly well but it's been done before.  And, in most cases, done better.<br /><br />Finally, because the ghost story isn't effectively developed, the ending crumbles under too much familial drama and not enough ghost story.  I blame this on the direction of the script.  It's trying to be a ghost movie with a bit of familial drama and instead it's more drama than ghost story.  And because of this, people will be ultimately disappointed.  And it's unfortunate.  I really enjoyed about 3/4 of the movie but was way too disappointed with the last 1/4th that I left the theatre sad that it wasn't executed as well as it could be.<br /><br />A 4 star review is probably too high.  As the drama, it's at least a 4 star if not 5.  As a ghost story it's less than 3.  But the acting was superb, the characters well developed (with the exception of the ghost) and the overal direction in terms of the director was pitch perfect.  Overall, though, it wasn't very thrilling or scary.  And that, above all, is what a ghost story should be.</p></br><a href="../users/AYWSFRCIMOAYE.html">AYWSFRCIMOAYE</a><br/><p>Yes, the movie is dark but it's not scary at all. There's no suspense either. What a waste of time.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JH5J1KQAUBMP.html">A1JH5J1KQAUBMP</a><br/><p>When a newly-divorced woman moves into a creepy apartment with her young daughter, she must contend with sinister neighbors, migraine headaches, a stressful custody battle, and, perhaps, a vengeful ghost.  The cast is very good and the atmosphere is creepy, but there just isn't much to this story.  The narrative becomes confused by some plot elements that amount to nothing--why did the lawyer lie about being with his family?  Was the husband really plotting something with the suspicious teenagers?  It's a decent film, but nothing special.</p></br><a href="../users/A38N7SFDOB3MR3.html">A38N7SFDOB3MR3</a><br/><p>Everything about Dark Water seems broken. The couple's marriage. The apartment. The people. The school. The janitor and owner. Everything about Dark water seems old, weary, confused and drab. Except, of course, for a very pink backpack found by a child on the rooftop of an apartment building. This one source of color and life in the movie points us to the one source of distress and death in the movie.<br /><br />Dark Water isn't a cliche ghost story, and for the most part that is good. The acting is wonderful, but the film still suffers from distracting flaws. Dark Water does drag occasionally, and often wavers between scary and suspenseful and just plain overdone. The major flaw with the film is that too much time is spent staring at the ceiling, literally. This tends to slow down the suspense at times.<br /><br />Another area where this film suffers, although to a smaller degree, is including scenes that have no business being in the film. Certain scenes do not advance the plot, and seem to be included for character development, or possibly to make us think that a certain character might be scheming against the protagonist. For example, there is a scene is which a lawyer talks on a cell phone to a woman, and then the scenes cuts to the back of the lawyer's car. From there, an African American male makes several comments that neither flesh out the lawyer's character nor have any bearing whatsoever on the film. We never see this "back seat man" again. Consider it 30 seconds of wasted time.<br /><br />I have never criticised a film for including useless scenes before, but felt it was needed for a review of Dark Water. There are more scenes than the one stated, including a scene in which the lawyer misleads the woman, and then enters a theatre alone. The scene is pointless and again, a waste of time.<br /><br />Other than this, I found the film to be entertaining, fresh and somewhat suspenseful. It really wasn't cliche or cheesy in the least. If you are looking for a fresh, well-acted ghost story without the modern trappings of gore or cheap frights, Dark Water is a good choice.<br /><br />Total Score (out of 100) = 57<br /><br />27 (out of 50).

"Dark Water" is hardly any different than that, with the execption of decent acting by Jennifer Connelly.  Much of the story line in "Dark Water"  is much like the story line you would find in movies like "The Ring" and "Sixth Sense".  A kid and their parents or a parent or adult figure who slowly begin the realize that there is a ghostly presence who is filled with anger and rage because of something that happened to the ghostly presence in life.  Been there, seen it more than once.  It has been getting old since "Sixth Sense" first came out.  Holloywood needs to find new material for horror films.  Because this movie is no more than an average rental during halloween, if that often.</p></br><a href="../users/A3RB6NQOLOBXYD.html">A3RB6NQOLOBXYD</a><br/><p>Now I have not seen the Japanese version of Darkwater, but this American remake is pretty stale. Jennifer Connelly is a middle aged woman struggling through custody battles with her husband over their daughter Ceci. She starts a new life with her daughter in Roosevelt Island right outside Manhattan, the apartment they move into is old and extremely creepy. Leaks and strange noises are just some of the common problems Jennifer Connelly and her daughter encounter. Now in the opening scene of the movie we see Jennifer Connelly as a young girl waiting for her mother to pick her up from school. Unfortunately her mother forgets about her and she is left to wait with her teacher. Now this scene kinda explains why their new apartment is dripping with "dark water". Later on we are introduced with the caretaker of the building, he is impolite and very rude. Up above Jennifer Connelly's room was a Russian family with a single daughter also. The two parents assumed that one of them took their daughter with them, we later find out that the father split and went to live with his mother in Russia and the mother ran away. Ceci all of a sudden has trouble adjusting to her new school and talks to an imaginary friend named Natasha, (Russian girl). Ceci begins to know about Jennifer Connelly's poor relationship with her mother. We later find out that the Young abandoned Russian girl died on the rooftop and thats why Jennifer Connelly experienced nightmares and hallucinations. The care taker of the building was aware of this death but covered it up saying she was still alive. He just didn't want to let the cops investigate on this tragic death of the young girl. Tim Roth plays Jennifer Connelly's lawyer who helps her gain custody of Ceci and repair the apartment damages. Now the whole point of this ghost story is that the young Russian girl and Jennifer Connelly both had irresponsible mothers. In other words this ghost story pretty much goes unexplained, not too mention there really isn't any "jump out of your seat scenes" althought there is a scene where Jennifer Connelly is wet in a white t-shirt. The movie is well paced and the acting is pretty decent but the whole story line is pretty poor and fails to capture any real suspense. In the long run, this deff. a rentable movie, don't buy it like I did unless your a die hard Jennifer Connelly fan.</p></br><a href="../users/A2WX1UESDOLXRE.html">A2WX1UESDOLXRE</a><br/><p>I watched this movie knowing full well that it's on many critics Top Ten Worst Films of 2005 lists. I don't care about that sort of thing, I'll make my own judgment, but I was aware. And guess what?? How right the critics are this time! Wow! I'll say it simply -- this is not a very good movie. The events unfold well enough to give you seriously creepy feelings, but in the end, I wished I hadn't put in nearly 100 minutes of my time watching something that was truly mediocre.<br /><br />Jennifer Connelly stars as Dahlia, a woman who is dealing with an icky divorce as well as an icky custody battle involving her only child, an adorable little girl named Cecilia. Dahlia and Cecilia move into a new apartment, an inredibly nasty apartment with a terrible leak problem. And this isn't just regular water. It's DARK water. Ooooo!! Spooky! Eventually we learn that the apartment above her own was lived in by a family of three. They, too, had a little girl, right at Cecilia's age. Meanwhile, Cecilia's teacher is concerned because she keeps talking to an imaginary friend named Natasha. You guessed it -- Natasha is also the name of girl who once lived above them. So obviously we have a ghost on our hands.<br /><br />I don't want to reveal to much, just in case you actually want to see this drek and be surprised for yourself. You won't so much be surprised as you will be bewildered. Why does Dahlia do that?? Come on! Why does she give in?? I realize that you have no clue what I'm talking about, but, well, you'll see eventually. Check this out if your looking to be creeped out. Certainly not as good as The Ring, not quite as "okay" as The Grudge, but still perhaps worth taking a look at.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VCPMT1RRS7K0.html">A1VCPMT1RRS7K0</a><br/><p>This movie begins like so many other horror/thriller movies.  In this case, a woman in the midst of divorce and custody proceedings is moving into a new place with her daughter.  The daughter is apprehensive about the move and the mother reassures her that everything will work out.  We wait for something scary to happen...<br /><br />The building/setting is indeed spooky, but nothing eventful happens for quite some time.  There are many boring stretches in the film that may not be able to hold your attention.  I honestly gave this movie a chance, but it simply wasn't scary or all that suspenseful.  It reminded me of "The Ring", but without the good story and lure.<br /><br />There is plenty of bonus material on the DVD, but it's barely even worth watching people speak with such ferver about a movie that falls so short.</p></br><a href="../users/A13DQTXG02HZC1.html">A13DQTXG02HZC1</a><br/><p>This movie might be remembered for THE movie that brought down Disney's profitability this year.  There's nothing wrong with "Dark Water".  Impressive director, screenwriter and cast made this a resolute & intelligent movie.  However, it's missing an important ingredient and the sorely lacking potent ingredient is what prevented the audience from flocking to the cinemas in droves.  "Dark Water" is one of those movie that could be appreciated at home.  The essence of heading to cinema is to scare ourselves witless with those over-the-top soundtrack & gore factor.  "Dark Water" is never meant to be made to target at the younger crowd and thus, the lacklustre result.  Jennifer Connelly's previous movie, "Hulk" shared the same fate.  They are good movies but simply underappreciated.  Pete Postelwaite, John C Reilly, Jennifer Connelly were brilliant here but scary moments were far in between.  Towards the half of the movie, we already could guess the end-result and its plot.  As a result, the movie became the victim of the genre's success as it 'educated' the audience of what to expect.  Please  be mindful that the extras provided in the DVDs are quite negligible.  Commendable movie.</p></br><a href="../users/AW99SBGWEXP0J.html">AW99SBGWEXP0J</a><br/><p>Dahlia (Connelly) and her daughter Ceci (Grade) have just moved into a ninth-floor apartment on Roosevelt Island.

It is also very affordable, and that is not surprising given how gloomy the place looks.  Kyle (Scott), her ex, wants sole custody since he believes Dahlia is an unfit mother.<br /><br />The only problem with the apartment is a leak in the ceiling dripping black water.  The handyman won't fix it and Dalhia wonders why.  At the same time Ceci makes an imaginary friend who may not be as imaginary as she seems.  And the water keeps dripping...<br /><br />"Dark Water" is more of a thriller than a horror movie, despite what the previews may want you to believe.  If you go into it expecting horror, you will probably be disappointed, and that would be a shame.  "Dark Water" is a smart movie whose twists and turns make sense and follow from what has gone before.  Jennifer Connelly is solid as the mom who just wants what is best for her daughter, but has issues of her own to deal with.  The supporting cast of John C. Reilly and Pete Postlethwaite as the apartment manager and handyman respectively deliver excellent smaller performances.  "Dark Water" is a good thriller and is worth checking out.</p></br><a href="../users/A19V0VJMKKRMC8.html">A19V0VJMKKRMC8</a><br/><p>I bought this movie on the release date because I really wanted to watch it and the video store was obviously closed. Off I went to sear's with my money. Worst mistake i'll ever make. It started out strong but by the middle you were slipping into a comatose state. Borrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrring.</p></br><a href="../users/AK1OBVI54SY73.html">AK1OBVI54SY73</a><br/><p>Especially in the first hour or so I felt like I instead got the wrong DVD and was watching a drama that was seriously boring, for I do find most dramas boring. The lead actress whines and whines throughout this movie and it really got annoying, not to mention that the storyline never became too good and the ending was so typical. The whole movie was pretty typical and never was I jolted out of my seat or even surprised for one moment. This movie was dull- possibly because the storyline I feel is very familiar to other films I have seen- which it is.<br /><br />The acting itself is not too strong and the whole movie feels just like a combination of a bunch of other films I have seen. The whole story is boring and not bold at all or fresh in idea. I very much disliked this film and I highly recommend another horror film. This movie is just not worth watching to me. My friends only thought it was okay and it was just that- average and nothing special. Try looking for another horror movie first before trying this one is my best advice.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PMQH87R1H3QU.html">A2PMQH87R1H3QU</a><br/><p>Did u see "RING 2" anyone?/?? this is another lame, stupid scrip and story just like that.

Make no mistake, it's definitely another modern ghost movie, but it takes a more character driven and more purely dramatic approach, so much so that up until the very latest portions of the film the supernatural aspects are almost a subplot.  The film is actually primarily character driven, focusing on the central Dahlia character and her daughter most of all, but still leaving plenty of room for the various minor characters.  Honestly, from a purely practical standpoint, we don't need to know these people as well as we come to, but this, along with the slow plotting of the film, helps generate a greater sense of reality and an overall expansiveness. I don't think this formula would work if it were repeated, horror films simply need to be more horrific then this as a whole, but for a lone attempt it's a fairly different, quite effective experience.<br /><br />'Dark Water' is a remake of a Hideo Nakata film from 2002. This strikes me as a peculiar film to rework, as it is a fairly effective but ultimately unremarkable film.  Also, the original 'Dark Water' has cash-in written all over it:  It's a 'Ringu' rehash directed by the maker of said film, based on a short story by Koji Suzuki, who wrote the original novel on which 'Ringu' is based.  Of course, the remake has got cash-in written all over it too, as well as the mark of the various `Ring' films: Roughly 1/3 of the plot of this film is simply recycled from `Ring/Ringu' while the American `Ring Two' (also directed by Nakata) lifted about a third of `Dark Water's plot.  (And, perhaps more significantly they have most of the same themes and motifs i.e. Girl-ghosts, water, motherhood etc.)  Still, `Dark Water' manages to seem far less reiterative simply by reworking the focus, downplaying the supernatural and emphasizing the human.<br /><br /> The film opens with a meeting between Dahlia (Jennifer Connelly) and her soon to be ex husband Kyle (Dougray Scott).  It's hard to think of any divorce being to pleasant, but things are obviously bound to get prett tough here.  This separation means that Dahlia needs to find a new home, and shortly after this meeting she and her 6 year old daughter Ceci (Ariel Gade) move into a nasty, ultra-bland and rundown apartment complex on Roosevelt Island.  (My brother said this place reminded him of the Soviet built apartments he'd seen in Russia and you can totally imagine that; it's designed to be purely functional and not aesthetically pleasing, though it frankly is something of a failure in the former respect as well.)  This place has got a load of problems, the most disturbing one being the dark, viscous looking water leaking from the ceiling, and strange sound emanate from the supposedly empty apartment above.<br /><br />The film essentially follows the day to day life of Dahlia and Ceci, as things get increasingly weird and difficult:  Ceci soon acquires an imaginary friend whom she vehemently insists is real; Dahlia, who  has an ill-defined history of mental illness, begins to have disturbing dreams and to hear distant voices;  the divorce grows increasingly hostile and Dahlia suspects Kyle is trying to maker her look paranoid, all while the apartment continues to fall apart around them.  This all eventually comes to a head, but not until the final half hour, and I'm sure plenty of people will  lose patience with it.  It kept me interested, though, through the fine performances and stylish direction.<br /><br />Jennifer Connelly is the center of the film, and she does a fine job.  Salles wisely refuses to turn her into a saint, allowing her to be fairly flawed and human, and ultimately more sympathetic.  Ariel Gade is your typical cute Hollywood kid, but what can I say, she's legitimately cute and the bonding scenes between her and Connelly seem very real.  There are also three fine supporting roles from Pete Postelthwaite, John C. Reilly and Tim Roth.  Reilly is the best of them as the total sleaze ball owner of the complex.  He spends the whole film endlessly praising the wretched apartments and dodging Dahlia's complaints.  I couldn't help but like him a little; sure he's slime, but it's his job and he's good at it.  Pete Postelthwaite plays his standard role, the funny-looking foreigner.  He's Veeck, the apartment caretaker something, and Postelthwaite makes him a more interesting character than he has any right to be.  Tim Roth is perhaps the most inexplicable of all of them as Dahlia's lawyer Jeff Platzer.  He takes an odd personal interest in Dahlia's life, yet lies to her constantly for no apparent reason.  One can't help but suspect that he has a romantic in her (I mean who wouldn't, ehh [nudgenudge].... even if she is crazy, so what....) but this doesn't go anywhere.  Anyway, this film is a real testament to how committed acting can bring life and significance to minor roles.<br /><br />This is an extraordinarily depressing looking film, filled with perpetual rain and a color palette extending from dirty brown to rust red.  Roosevelt island is just such a great locale as it is a total industrial wasteland.  It's a block from `Eraserhead' somehow made real.  The film is shot fairly elegantly, though the camerawork and staging are generally fairly unobtrusive.  One major exception to this rule are the dream sequences, which have a bit of flair and choppy editing, alongside some neat effects, like melting walls and whatnot.  Again, the ghostly stuff is fairly by the book, but it's sharply executed.  The climax is somewhat underwhelming but perhaps this is appropriate considering the low-key flavor of the film.  The denouemont is too heavy handed, but it's not that big of deal.<br /><br />Anyway, this is a fairly interesting, well-executed movie.  It's not liable to blow you away, but it's interesting and immersive.  Definitely worth a look if you're into this kinda thing.<br /><br />Grade: B</p></br><a href="../users/AYWAY5MKLAITN.html">AYWAY5MKLAITN</a><br/><p>When I first picked up this dvd, I had high expectations. Who wouldn't? The review on the cover loudly proclaims: "Even Hicthcock Could Not have done Better."<br /><br />That's a pretty bold statement when you think about it.<br /><br />I really tried to like this movie.<br /><br />And, on top of that, after watching it, some would say that it's similar to the Ring. What are you talking about? IT'S EXACTLY LIKE THE RING ONLY IT HAS DIFFERENT CHARACTERS.<br /><br />Let's get all the cons about this movie out of the way first:<br /><br />1. 'Dark Water' is not a very original title for a movie of this magnitude.<br />2. All the characters seem bored or uninteresting.<br />3. There were dream sequences that didn't fully contribute to the plot but were more placed there for artistic style pruposes.<br />4. Half of the movie's Theatrical Trailer was an out right lie. A lot of scenes were not even there that got me so pumped up for the movie while watching the trailer. And that is no good at all.<br />5. The screams and shocks were not huge and loud enough.<br />6. Lastly, if you're going to say that Hitchcock couldn't do better, you'd have to really convince me.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />1. The drama was well-acted.<br />2. The premise was alright but not mind-bending. In fact, the theme has been done before. But you might like it.<br /><br />Final verdict: Dark Water doesn't scare people that easily.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CYOHNGQ1WED1.html">A1CYOHNGQ1WED1</a><br/><p>Jennifer Connelly plays a woman who is going through a bitter divorce and she and her young daughter must find a new place to live. They rent an apartment in a kind of dank, run-down building. There are continuous leaks of dark water from the apartment above and also strange noises. The daughter becomes obsessive over an imaginary friend that has something to do with the apartment upstairs. It turns out there was a little girl who lived there who disappeared a few weeks earlier and no one knows what happened to her. It all ties in with Connelly's issues with her own mother and she begins to wonder if she is going crazy. The water leaks are blamed on a few teenagers that live in the building and Connelly sees her husband talking to these boys. She wonders if he is paying them to mess with her to help in the custody fight.<br /><br />The movie does make you wonder if the things that are happening are supernatural or a set-up and it is a stylish movie to look at. The performances are also first-rate. However, the movie ultimately fails because except for last ten minutes, and one creepy scene in particular, there is no tension or fear. Things happen at a very slow pace and there isn't anything frightening about them for the viewer. The first hour and a half of the movie are dull and it does not build, it just sits there. I love the scene at the end when the daughter is in the bathtub and the mother finally realizes exactly what's happening but it's too little too late to save the movie as a whole.</p></br><a href="../users/A3E5OY3YLZMOA9.html">A3E5OY3YLZMOA9</a><br/><p>Dark water was a movie a lot of people expected to be really good but the truth is it isn't. It's almost like false advertisement because the movie wasn't scary at all and it was very boring and way to long. I fell asleep a after the first half hour and when I watched the parts I missed I knew why I went to sleep. It's the slowest movie I've ever seen, you find is some interest in it to see what's up with the dark water but it turns into being a watered down version of The Ring. Everything is obvious from the beginning, you know why the dead child is torturing the apartment building and after that you just watch to see how she died. The only thing making this movie even a little worth watching is the surprising ending. It's better to see the original Japanese version anyway.</p></br><a href="../users/A3F3B6HY9RJI04.html">A3F3B6HY9RJI04</a><br/><p>The acting is quite good.

It tries to be scary, but it isn't.  It tries to be smart, but it isn't.  There is no tension and the only part with a little bit of suspense was just weird.<br /><br />The Ring was great!  The Grudge was okay.  But this addaption of a Nakata film really missed the mark.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KUUII2GSHN7T.html">A3KUUII2GSHN7T</a><br/><p>I figured any movie with Jennfier Connelly, Tim Roth and John C. Reilly would be worth a view, and if we were to isolate their performances in this film and leave it at that, the movie wouldn't be that bad. But that's not how movies work. Instead, we find ourselves watching a mother - freshly divorced from her cheating husband - and daughter move into a creepy apartment. It has all the makings of a momentously horrifying ending - the overly friendly Super(Reilly), the creepingly quiet maintenance man (Pete Postlethwaite - Keizer Soze's associate from The Usual Suspects), who we later find to be a porn-hound, intensifying the creepiness. There's also two teenage punks who harass Connelly's character, and a water dripping that won't stop. Oh, and a sinister voice that keeps speaking to both the mother and daughter.<br /><br />But that's where the frights end. Director Walter Salles had it all - the dark setting, the great actors - and then he goes and throws it all away. The ending, which I'm supposing was based on the novel, is downright hallow. This was one of the least satisfying endings I've ever seen in my young life.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this empty film, a story with more holes left empty than plugged.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AEYDNYCWH2IZ.html">A3AEYDNYCWH2IZ</a><br/><p>I liked it.

It would seem that something scary was going to happen, and then nothing happened. The movie was extremely slow and anticlimactic just like (The Ring). If you want to be scared, buy (28 Days Later) on DVD. This movie was more of a tragedy then a horror.

Dahlia is going through a divorce (backstory) and is under a lot of stress due to her current situation.  The apartment seems nice at first, until she notices a leak in the bedroom.  From that point, the movie never seems to have any focus.  Are we supposed to be worrying about the leak? the imaginary friend? the obnoxious tenants of the building? Dahlia's divorce?  It's never made clear until the end, when we get the classic revelation of what happened in the apartment upstairs, and why it's affecting Dahlia.<br /><br />Dark Water cannot be considered a horror movie.  The only reason it falls into that category is because the storyline involves a ghost.  There are no scares in this movie.  There are no scary moments.  There is no tension, whatsoever.  Quite simply, this is one of the worst, most disappointing "horror" movies that I have ever seen.</p></br><a href="../users/AZCDCO6KK2T81.html">AZCDCO6KK2T81</a><br/><p>The ever reliable Jennifer Connelly gives another very convincing performance in this atmospheric film.  The supporting cast is perfect and believable.  The direction is clever and well-paced, but not heavy-handed for this genre.  The scriptwriters created terrific characters and believable plot twists in this very suspenseful and eerie film.<br /><br />This is another well-adapted and even improved version of the original Japanese horror flick, but it isn't in the same vein as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006SGYL0">The Grudge</a> although it is influenced by it.  It is much more subdued and darker than that film and is more character driven.  Some may not like this slower, more deliberately paced chiller, but that is what gives it momentum and suspense.  I think it's very well-paced for the genre it falls into which is the traditional haunted house kind of film.<br /><br />This film is worth owning, but not having seen the film in the theaters, I have no clue what was added to this "unrated" edition of the original PG-13 theatrical release.  I can say that I found nothing objectionable in it as sometimes happens with these "unrated" releases.  Less shocking and intense than other Asian horror imports or influenced films, but that made this a fun popcorn film for me and my family as there is no bloodshed, violence, sex, or nudity in this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A10X0JN8KTK89H.html">A10X0JN8KTK89H</a><br/><p>Dark Water is great at manufacturing tension using a contemporary project (apartment) complex as the source of shadows, dim and yellow light, strange noises, and black-colored water. The tension is level almost from the beginning of the movie until the end, and rarely is there a scary moment to break it. Even the comic relief of the daughter is unintentional as she plays with her toys in the bathtub -- although she steals this scene, it is due to her personality, not the script.<br /><br />This film is largely plotless. It's also not entirely a character sketch, as many plotless movies can be. For a horror movie to be a character sketch is risky and quite interesting. For a horror movie to have no plot is downright suicidal. The movie fails mostly because it lacks a believable sequence of events. The relationships between the characters are well-developed and the cast is quite good, but there's nothing for them to do. Look scared, be scary, but why? And the utter non-ending is truly thoughtless -- the film ultimately has no regard for the audience.<br /><br />I suspect that much of the problem has to do with translation. Not Japanese to English, but rather Japanese sensibility to Hollywood sensibility. Something is missing here, a finger on something important. After all, the best horror movies are about our worst fears. Who is afraid of dark water stains?</p></br><a href="../users/A2ASIT0JYIGHTA.html">A2ASIT0JYIGHTA</a><br/><p>This movie has received many bad reviews, but to be honest I really enjoyed it despite it being far from perfect.  The acting from Jennifer Connelly was brilliant as a mother who is trying to move forward with her life but there are things in the past and present which are preventing that. I felt truly sorry for her, which I think was the director's intention. Let's face it, a movie succeeds if you feel for the key characters.  The film is a remake of a Japanese film, and I look forward to seeing that version to compare one day.<br /><br />As a viewer, I was unsure of what was reality or fantasy at times, but that made the film all the more intriguing for me.  I thought the leaking roof was a brilliant storyline (particularly since I had experienced something similar in an apartment many years ago).  Overall, the creepiness of the apartment block was well conveyed.<br /><br />I recommend this movie for those who enjoy the odd creepy film, and for fine acting too.</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>Based upon a Japanese film of similar name, DARK WATER stars Jennifer Connelly as Dahlia Williams, a recently divorced woman who is trying to make a new life for her and her daughter, Ceci (Areil Grade).  An ongoing custody battle with her ex-husband, Kyle (Dougray Scott) hasn't left Dahlia with much money, but she is able to find an inexpensive apartment on an island across from Manhattan.  The apartment is small and somewhat dingy, but the landlord Mr. Murray (John C. Reilly) seems quite helpful, the building is close to the school, and it's in Dahlia's price range.  So she takes it.<br /><br />At first she doesn't pay attention to a small water stain on the ceiling of the bedroom. Then Dahlia notices that the stain grows larger and is dripping dark water.  Then Ceci finds a little girl's backpack on the roof of the building and later her schoolteacher informs Dahlia that Ceci has been speaking with an imaginary friend named Natasha.  The apartment makes strange noises and Dahlia thinks she sees strange kids running around on the abandoned floor above. Her migraines become more intense and she starts having more frequent nightmares about her own troubled childhood. Dahlia believes that it's all connected and investigates into the root cause of all the problems.<br /><br />DARK WATER was marketed in the U.S. as a horror movie. I'm not really sure why because the film isn't a horror movie.  It does have a gothic tone and is suspenseful, but that's about the only connections to the horror genre the film has.  The movie reminded me most of some of the suspense films of Alfred Hitchcock.<br /><br />The biggest complaint I have about DARK WATER is that it moves at a very slow pace.  The slow pacing augments the gothic tone of the movie, but it also makes the movie very difficult to watch all the way through in one setting.  What I enjoyed most about the film was the actual story and the acting.  The lovely Jennifer Connelly is brilliant as ever and John C. Reilly does a great job as the landlord.<br /><br />If you can handle the slow pacing DARK WATER is an average suspense film that is particular fun to watch on a rainy day.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>When it comes down to horror movies, you can either have the types that are more preoccupied with portraying creepy atmospheres and foreboding tension. But then you get the type, which is kind of where we're stuck now, where violence is emphasized - more specifically, graphic carnage-like violence. So when you see a film like Dark Water, you get the feeling that you're going to watch the former right? Well turns out you're getting something a little different and if you're aware of this before watching you might like it.<br /><br />Dahlia Williams is a recently separated woman in a custody battle with her husband over daughter Cecilia. Getting an apartment on Roosevelt Island, Dahlia's problems seem to get worse as the apartment is in rather poor condition, notably a leak in the bedroom. But then, Cecilia starts to talk of an imaginary friend and the apartment upstairs seems to be frequently full of movement and water. But with a husband out to gain sole custody, is she just made out to look crazy or is there something upstairs?<br /><br />Watching a horror film, you genuinely want to feel creeped out and almost be on edge. I'm sure I'm not the only one who felt strange after watching a horror movie, like noises aren't just simply noises and whatnot. Dark Water on the other hand is not a horror movie so much as it is a psychological kind of film where it's a more slower-based tension and relatively light on jump scenes. In fact, what little scares there is they feel somewhat, excuse the pun, "watered down", as if the studio didn't want the film to be too scary or more focused on boo scenes than atmosphere. While the film does have a more slower pace which is rather atypical of the more wham-bam style that we've been seeing lately but it feels like a psychological film mixed with a horror film but trying to figure out which one to use when. As such it feels sort of disjointed and pulled from 2 directions.<br /><br />But just because it might not fit a horror or thriller genre doesn't mean it has to have bad acting too. Led primarily by Jennifer Connelly, she's given the most screen time and luckily she's sympathetic and able to lend gravitas to a character when they're normally known for being either shrieking violets or just sad sacks that cry all the time. It helps too that she's supported by known character actors such as John C. Reilly (Boogie Nights), Pete Postlethwaite (Usual Suspects) Dougray Scott (Mission: Impossible 2), Tim Roth (Reservoir Dogs) and Camryn Manheim (tv's The Practice). They're not really flashy roles but they don't feel useless either.<br /><br />Is it a film that you should check out? Well, that is if you know what you'r'e getting into. Wanting to see a horror movie, or a character-based psychological film? If it's the former, you'll be disappointed but it's the latter you might find that you'll like it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2H22I2RWE0HOV.html">A2H22I2RWE0HOV</a><br/><p>Dark Water is  remake from a Japanese film from years back.  They don't really tote that around, but the movie buffsa will know it.  And being how it isn't original, that is where it comes up lacking.  First off, they push Dark Water at you like it's The Ring or The Grudge or one of those new-fangled hack-slash-scare-and-scream bits of tripe that have been spewing out of the gullet of Hollywood for the past few years.  The New Breed of Horror Flicks.  Well...  The first thing you will realize is that Dark Wateris not scary at all.  I didn't even flinch once.  But once you get past the preconceived notion that you're supposed to be afraid or grossed out or whatever, you realize that Dark Water is actually a pretty good movie.  Filled with dark amosphere and creepy settings, this is definitely not one of those semi-retarded ultra-gore Saw movies.<br /><br />Jennifer Connelly is a recently divorced single mother with past mental issues who finds a place to live in the most god-awfully creepy tenemant in New York.  This place looks like Attica prison turned into condos.  Seriously.  She and her small daughter take an apartment on the ninth floor and everything seems to be going fine.  New school for the daughter.  New job for the mom.  The occasional spat between ex-husband & ex-wife.  And then the leaks begin.<br /><br />This movie is the most straight-forward ghost story you will ever see and when you realize where the story is going, you'll slap yourself in the head.  Duh!  But it does have  freaky ending and that's cool.  Not overly gory.  I like that.  Not that gore bothers me.  When it's used gratuitously for no pupose other than shock-value, that's f*cking irritating.  Definitely a flick worth seeing.  Wouldn't pay full-price for it because it's pretty predictable.  But it's a good mid-range suspense ride.  When you watch the dark, creeping, oozing dark water slittering down from the ceiling, you will cringe.  That's movie atmosphere at it's best.<br /><br />Dig it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK.html">A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK</a><br/><p>Perhaps horror movies should return to the gothic countryside fixer-upper.  "The Ring" and "The Grudge" took place in a city setting, and managed to eek out a chill or two.  However, this movie fails to break any new territory.  Worse, the plodding pace just failed to keep me interested to the end.<br /><br />Dahlia (Jennifer Connelly) is in the midst of a bitter divorce with husband Kyle (Dougray Scott).  Caught in the middle is daughter Ceci (Ariel Gade).  Dahlia insists on moving into a building where weird things are constantly happening.  The excitement builds and builds (a little tongue-in-cheek here) as the movie moves between events caused by people and events caused by something that the movie only reveals at the end.  Thrown into this plot goulash is Dahlia's childhood.  Dahlia's mother abandoned her.  We see periodic flashbacks to help us understand Dahlia's actions.<br /><br />There are a bunch of problems with this movie.  First, too much stuff is going on which means absolutely nothing.  The guy in the elevator meant nothing and he failed to advance the plot.  Yes, he did provide information about the elevator going up to the tenth floor and he did note that someone kept obliterating the writing on the elevator buttons.  Big deal; we already knew that information when he showed up.<br /><br />The teenage boys appeared menacing, but the movie wastes yet another opportunity.  I could go on, but I would spoil the whole movie for you, in the event that you decide to watch this snoozer.<br /><br />The movie did finally wake from its slumber and provide us with a few tense, generally predictable, moments.  However, those few moments were insufficient compensation for the nearly hour and a half wait.  Incidentally, my wife predicted the end of the movie about halfway through it, beating me completely.  After she pointed out the probable ending, I suddenly realized that this movie was terribly obvious the whole time.  Of course, my wife already realized that.<br /><br />I watched the "unrated widescreen edition," which was supposed to be scarier than what was shown in the theaters.  If this movie was scarier, I think many people must have felt that they wanted their money back when they saw this one in the theater.<br /><br />"Dark Water" fails to slake my thirst for a good horror movie.  I think I would rather watch "The Ring" or "The Grudge" again rather than this movie.  If you want to see a real horror in your own home, go look at the dirty dishwater; yes, this movie was that dull.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X15AQVSCKKRG.html">A1X15AQVSCKKRG</a><br/><p>DARK WATER is the American remake of the Japanese<br />movie of the same name.

Speaking of that then there is no<br />better dramatic actress right now than Jennifer<br />Connelly. Even snobbish critics of this movie can't slam<br />her performance in this, she is very , very good.<br /><br />Connelly is become a master of this sort of thing, letting<br />her emotions speak for itself and guide the movie into<br />a dark atmosphere, something she's done quite well in<br />her work (A Beautiful Mind).<br /><br />I liked the movie overall, and I have not seen the Japanese<br />movie, but that's a good thing since people won't<br />be so conceited in comparing both. That said it was much<br />better than "The Grudge" with Sarah Michelle Gellar.

A word of warning: this is not a movie to just plant oneself in front of and half pay attention to if you want to get anything out of it (actually, I feel no movie fits that description but it's particularly relevant here).  It starts slow and takes the time to build up, and one admittedly has to meet it at least part way to fully take in the rewards of this very powerful and very emotional horror drama.  If you spend too much time just waiting and wanting the scares to come in the early portions of the movie (they do come, but later on) you're liable to miss out on the subtle enigmatic ambiguities, the developing relationships and the intricate 'brick-by-brick' approach of the plot building.  Don't get me wrong, I love horror movies that go strong throttle from the get-go ("Dawn Of The Dead", "Freddy Vs. Jason", "Rawhead Rex", et. al.) but this is a very different aspect of the horror field we're seeing here, and one that's no less potent.  The slower pace may have hurt its chances at worldwide blockbuster status, as may have the fact that the dominant relationship in the movie is that of the loving, non-dysfunctional bond between a young mother and her little girl, but neither detract from "Dark Water"'s quality.<br /><br />  The mother, Dahlia (played by the incomparable Jennifer Connelly) and her little girl Ceci (adorably played by Ariel Gade) have fallen on hard times following the divorce of Dahlia and her rather arrogant and unlikeable ex-husband and end up moving into a new apartment building, a rather run-down place, where the apartment in which they end up is experiencing problems with significant water leakage, at first nothing more than another aspect of the building's general weak state of repair but later taking on much more sinister implications.  The source of the water seems to be the empty(?) apartment above their own, and Ceci seems to be developing a friendship with another child who may or may not really exist.<br /><br />Things, circumstances, and characters change as the movie progresses.  At times, the brand of intensity is similar to that in the brilliant "House Of Sand And Fog", Connelly's last movie before this one.  There are moments of lightness sprinkled throughout the dark, many of them involving the aforementioned mother-daughter relationship, and the acting throughout, right down to the smallest supporting players, is first rate.  Disturbing, often sad and tragic, frightening, and gloomy, "Dark Water" avoids being depressing through the liakability  of its leads, through the moments of beauty and compassion and courage, through the sheer quality of the movie and frankly through the bountiful' cute kid' appeal of Gade as little Ceci and the gorgeous beauty of Connelly as Dahlia.<br /><br />The ending (not to give anything away, but...) - I've seen, I don't know, it must be well over a thousand movies and I've never seen an ending even remotely like this.  I will say nothing of it except that it's extremely effective and eternally memorable; a must-witness.<br /><br />Outstanding; one of the year's best.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GMUNBN9HKRZS.html">A2GMUNBN9HKRZS</a><br/><p>I found this film to be more depressing than scary. The bulk of it seems focused on the soul numbing daily problems faced by a recently divorced young mother. I wish to forget the "rat-race" part of life when I am in that darkened dream arena, not be plunged eyeball deep in another's. For the most part, whatever few scares there are can easily be explained by natural causes, provided by the film's storyline. The music and overloud/overdramatic sound effects try desperately to drum up the suspense...but grow tiresome when there are no payoffs in the story. It's got a group of good actors that need a story with an arc that includes tension and release, ups and downs of human emotions, scenes that instill dread and suspense...drama. Not unrelenting depressing existence.</p></br><a href="../users/A1POFVVXUZR3IQ.html">A1POFVVXUZR3IQ</a><br/><p>Having watched the Japanese original a few years before this remake, I hoped this would fare better. Unfortunately, it does not. The original version is much better on all levels, be it acting, atmosphere, and pure terror. This remake is not very scary, but it is interesting to watch, just don't expect chills and scares at every turn. Jennifer Connelly [A Beautiful Mind] makes a beautiful if tragic character, playing the role of a recently divorced woman, Dahlia who leases an apartment in a dingy complex on New York's Roosevelt Island. She is in the midst of a heated custody battle over her five-year-old daughter, Cecilia and things only get worse when she finds the new apartment is anything but perfect. Now, having watched Ms Connelly in House of Sand of Fog, she does a similarly admirable job of portraying an emotionally conflicted character here too. There are some good supporting roles here, e.g. Tim Roth as Dahlia's attorney, and also John C Reilly as the loathsome apartment manager. On the whole, this movie would have been a much better horror story as it purports to be if it had focussed more on explaining the supernatural occurences in the movie than on merely dwelling on the tormented character of Dahlia. But, it is definitely a watchable movie despite its flaws, for it does a credible job of exploring the psychology of complex human emotions & relationships.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>How far would you go to protect your child? We often hear parents say that they'd die for them, but dying is only going so far. What would you be willing to endure in the afterlife for your child ...and perhaps someone else's kid?<br /><br />In DARK WATER, directed by Walter Salles and starring Jennifer Connelly, we get to see exactly how far a damaged mother will go for her child.<br /><br />Dahlia (Connelly) is going through a bitter divorce and custody battle. For her job's sake, Dahlia is forced to move outside the hub of New York City and into a dark, dank apartment complex on Roosevelt Island. With her comes her daughter, Ceci, a ten-year-old with a perceptive extrasensory ability. Or does she have that ability? As soon as they enter the apartment complex, Ceci begins to feel poorly and asks to leave, but her mother insists that they check out the apartment. They soon move in and stranger things begin happening: dark water drips from the ceiling, Dahlia sees her mother (who'd abandoned her) in strange dreams, Ceci talks to an imaginary friend named Natasha, and the elevator button for their floor (#9) is burned or damaged.<br /><br />As the plot unfolds, we learn that the neighbors directly above Dahlia and Ceci's apartment were Russian immigrants who had a child, but neither the child nor the parents have been seen in some time. Did something foul happen to them? Further research by Dahlia's divorce attorney (played by Tim Roth ) shows that the adults from the upstairs apartment are separated and living apart ...but neither of them have their daughter, who's name happens to be Natasha. Where is she? Is she the same Natasha that Ceci talks to in her imagination? Are Ceci and Natasha somehow connected with the dark water dripping from their ceiling?<br /><br />_________________________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />The tone and dark, wet scenes set the tone for DARK WATER in a very revealing fashion. Water plays a vital part of how the viewer perceives much of what is shown on-screen, giving the entire production a rather somber (if downright depressing) feel. This is prime strength of the movie, getting us into how Jennifer Connelly's character feels and why she reacts the way she does (especially after seeing her as a young girl in the opening scenes, waiting for her negligent mother to come and get her from school ...and again, it's raining).<br /><br />Much has been said about this film regarding how much was intended to be psychological versus supernatural. But for me, it was all supernatural. The only part the psychology of Connelly's character played in the film was, again, helping set the tone and as a method for one ghostly apparition to feed off of. If Ceci (the daughter) can see the ghost, then it's not a psychological breakdown on her mother's part.<br /><br />Comparisons between THE RING and THE GRUDGE are pretty obvious, but it didn't detract from my enjoyment of the film. But it did make me wonder about how many other thriller films out there are using the same format now. How about something original guys?</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>Walter Salles has proven himself a formidable director with his successes in 'Central Station', Behind the Sun', and The Motorcycle Diaries': he is an artist unafraid to approach unfamiliar terrain in his growth as a director, yet always proving that the most important element in making a good film is to explore the characters more than just the atmosphere.  Those who find faults with DARK WATER seem to be concentrating on critiques of special effects and manufactured terror machines. Where Salles succeeds in this adaptation of the original Japanese film by K?ji Suzuki (novel) and Hideo Nakata (director) is his concentration on developing interesting and strange people, characters with whom we can identify and thus whose encounters with the 'unknown' feel more intensely internal.<br /><br />The story has been related ad infinitum: Dahlia (Jennifer Connelly) and her daughter Cecelia (Ariel Gade) move from Manhattan away from her recently estranged husband Kyle (Dougray Scott) to a creaky apartment building on Roosevelt Island to the benefit of real estate agent Mr. Murray (John C. Reilly) and under the suspicious eye of building super Veeck (Pete Postlethwaite).  The building and the constant rain are ominous from the start but soon strange events happen that suggest either mental decline of both Dahlia and Ceci or the presence of ghosts.  The title of the film describes not only the bleak atmospheric element that drives the story but also the netherworld that admixes surrealistic phenomena with psychosis. Characters enter the story naturally and comfortably: Jeff Platzer (Tim Roth) offers his legal defense of Dahlia in a manner that belies his mode of existence; Ceci's Teacher (Camryn Manheim) brings reality testing to the fuzzy world of imaginary friends; Alison Sealy-Smith as a supervisor where Dahlia seeks work is one of Dahlia's few kind encounters.<br /><br />Though the pacing seems slow it does march like the descent of a mind into the unknown and Salles manages that well. The film's cinematography by Affonso Beato maintains the grunge effect that intensifies the terror and Angelo Badalamenti has provided a musical score that bears just the right amount of supportive suspense.  But as with other Salles movies the work is supported by truly fine acting and once again Jennifer Connelly proves she can convey much with very little.  Give this film a chance, without comparisons to other films of the genre, and see what Walter Salles can do with a story.

However, I gave Dark Water a second chance and I'm so glad I did! Dahlia is a woman with problems, and this movie lets you make up your own mind whether they are psychological or paranormal. I personally feel like it was a combination of both. This movie just gets better and better every time I watch it. I truly feel like Jennifer Connelly is this generation's best actress, and I feel she's so underrated.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L8HRCM60W0W7.html">A1L8HRCM60W0W7</a><br/><p>I am not typically fond of dark gloomy films illuminated by 12 watt bulbs; reeks too much of B-grade. Still, if one closed one's eyes and thought hard enough, one could find some hidden psychological connotations in this trench cinematography from the bowels of suburban New York.<br /><br />The meandering script tells of a broken family - mother and daughter, and a father scrambling for custody. The custody thing quickly goes nowhere. The little girl has imaginary friends. The dingy apartment in in tatters, leaks and all. There is an element of soaked dreariness about the whole affair. The screenplay seems stylized at first but does a pretty good job of testing your patience from about half its length onward.<br /><br />As a clear attempt to flesh out on The Ring 2 and thus tinker with the horror genre, Dark Water is thankfully removed from your average screamer. It even offers a steady chill or two. But it goofs up royally with its climax -- all three of them. Or were there more?<br /><br />I would probably catch it on cable, with liberal channel flicks, but here's a film that's not going on my Netflix wishlist anytime soon.</p></br><a href="../users/AV6QDP8Q0ONK4.html">AV6QDP8Q0ONK4</a><br/><p>The movie starts out slow.

The apartment is run down (you can almost smell it) and has numerous leaks. Her daughter develops an imaginary friend and Jennifer is haunted by her past, i.e. a terrible relationship with her mother.<br /><br />The landlord landlord (John C.

Meanwhile Ceci's relationship with he imaginary friend intensifies as she tells Ceci things that makes Jennifer unsettled.<br /><br />The movie finally gets to one climatic scene and afterwards you feel empty. Is that it?<br /><br />The acting was fine. The slow build-up was good, but it took up too much of the film. The climax scene needed to be longer.<br /><br />No sex, no nudity, no f-bombs.

From the standard "all wet" cliche to "drizzly drips," I thought of them all.  "Dark Water" is, like a thousand other mediocre flicks these last few years, based on a mediocre Japanese horror flick by overrated Japanese writers about a creepy ghostchild that uses the "boo!" factor to a tiring degree in an attempt to scare the audience.  I'll admit that "The Grudge" actually had a couple of these moments, so did "The Ring," but "Dark Water" has none of this.<br /><br />It drips along at a snails pace with only slight hints as to what is exactly going on.  We're thrown off the trail by Jennifer Connelly's character a couple of times when she seems to be losing her mind.  In this film, she's fighting through a really nasty custody case with her ex, and as part of her struggle, she moves into a bleak apartment complex occupied by a wasted Pete Postlethwaite and John C. Reilly.  Both of these actors are ten times better than this film allows them to be, though Reilly manages to toss a little humor into his character.  Dougray Scott is pretty good as the ex, and Tim Roth turns in the top performance as Connelly's caring and daring lawyer.<br /><br />As the story puddles from dull moment to dull moment, Connelly and her daughter begin to have "experiences."  The daughter has the most contact with "something" in the beginning of the flick, but as it continues, the story centers its focus on Connelly.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this film ends with a literal splash, but not a great splashdown.  Connelly and company were wasted in this boring and uneventful flick.  I'm sure that if you're a fan of the other snoozer "horror" from Japan as of late, you'll probably drink this wet dog right up.  With that in mind, be prepared for more of the same Japanese scares.  If that's your bag, pick this up.  If you prefer your horror with more of an actual story, "Dark Water" will leave you feeling all wet.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R36DZQEWNVJ1.html">A3R36DZQEWNVJ1</a><br/><p>Jennifer Connelly (House of Sand and Fog, Dark City) plays Dahlia, a mother who is moving her daughter Ceci into an apartment building on Roosevelt Island and she is also in a custody battle with her husband, played by Dougary Scott (Mission:Impossible 2, Engima) who wants Ceci to stay in the New Jersey area. Connelly and her daughter get a tour of the place by Mr. Murray, a conniving and convincing John C. Reilly (Boogie Nights, The Aviator). Connelly enroles her daughter into a school two blocks away from the place and everything seems to be ok but things start to happen when water starts to drip from the upstairs apartment into hers. There seems to be a backstory to that apartment and Connelly's daughter picks up an imaginary friend along the way which could lead to some answers. What you'd expect from the Author of The Ring...another story involving a paranoid woman and a creepy kid seeing things but Connelly's performance anchors the movie along with the help of the supporting cast including Tim Roth (Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction) as her Lawyer and Pete Postlethwaite (The Usual Suspects, The Constant Gardener). Also starring Camryn Manheim (The Practice, The 10th Kingdom) and Mums.

This theme from THE RING is given a new life in DARK WATER.  While the movie is certainly spooky at times, I felt like I was watching THE RING all over again.  It's not hard to predict where the story is going, and this lack of suspense makes the movie seem a little lengthy and protracted.  Oscar winner Jennifer Connelly gives a top notch performance as Dahlia, a young single mother who moves with her daughter into a low-rent apartment on Roosevelt Island.  Facing nasty custody charges from her ex-husband, Connelly takes the apartment to start her life anew.  But things go awry when the apartment starts sprouting leaks all over the place.  Water is everywhere in this movie, from the relentless rain outside to the faucets, commodes, sinks, washers, etc.  The psychological occurrences are deeply rooted in Connelly's own past, and as the movie unfolds, we know there is something definitely going on in the dwelling.<br /><br />All this is effectively chilling, but since its predictable, one doesn't get totally involved.<br /><br />Ariel Gade is marvelous as young Cecily; Tim Roth, Dougray Scott, and Pete Postelthwaite are equally effective.  Only John C. Reilly in a basically utilitarian role is wasted as the apartment's manager.  The musical score by Angelo Badalmenti (the man who did the wonderful TWIN PEAKS music) is quite good.

Worth watching.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EEUQ81DTY7G3.html">A2EEUQ81DTY7G3</a><br/><p>The film Dark Water is something of an enigma. It boasts some great acting, strong direction by Walter Salles, and some realistic dialogue - and it's also suitably creepy and morbidly atmospheric, but the payoff, the final climax is also quite small, and the film is ultimately hampered by a setup that takes a little too long to play out.<br /><br />Dark Water undoubtedly has a stirring visual sense, and Salles eloquently sets the creepy mood; it also helps that he's enlisted the talents of some great actors, most notably the gorgeous Jennifer Connolly, who once again proves that she's is one of the accomplished and intriguing actresses of her generation.<br /><br />However, with all its efforts to be an effective and chilling psychological thriller, one can't help feeling that the, the recurring thematic elements in Dark Water are still all too familiar to anyone who has seen any installment of The Ring cycle, or not to mention the recent Amityville Horror. It's just that Dark Water does it a little slicker and is a lot more polished.<br /><br />Connelly plays newly divorced mom Dahlia Williams. Her separation from her husband Kyle (Dougray Scott) has been anything but pleasant and now she's in the midst of a custody battle for her young daughter Ceci (Ariel Grade). She and Ceci have just moved into a depressing ninth-floor apartment in a sprawling block of austere concrete monoliths on the bleak Roosevelt Island because it's only two blocks from one of the best schools in the New York/New Jersey metro area, and it's affordable.<br /><br />But Kyle, believing Dahlia to be an unfit mother - she occasionally suffers from paranoid headaches and is at times delusional - wants sole custody of his daughter. Meanwhile, there's a problem with Dahlia and Ceci's new home: a leak in the bedroom ceiling drips black water. The building's handyman (Pete Postlethwaite) is unwilling to fix it, and the smarmy complex manager (John C. Reilly) is also reluctant to take responsibity.<br /><br />Soon, Dahlia is wondering if the leak may be the result of activities in 10F, the apartment directly above hers. While Dahlia tries in vain to get her ceiling fixed, Ceci begins to converse with an imaginary friend who may not be that imaginary. It's not long before Dahlia becomes so haunted by the spooky goings on that she's imagining all sorts of weird things.<br /><br />She becomes so convinced that her husband is out to drive her crazy that she enlists the help of a smarmy divorce lawyer (a nice supporting turn by Tim Roth). But are these apparitions' just figments of her imagination, a result of the medications that she's taking, or is there something more sinister and supernatural at work?<br /><br />Rather than concentrate on creating suspense, Sales seems to be more concerned with exploring the intimate bond between mother and child, and it is in these quieter scenes that Connelly is really able to shine. The movie's themes of abandonment and the effects of living a lonely and isolated life in the big city are trenchant, incisive, and timely; and the director also allows things to unfold gradually, but this slow progression unfortunately results in a loss of energy.<br /><br />Dark Water takes place in an unending state of gloom. It's New York City and it's always raining, with the sun nothing but a vague memory, the murkiness and shadowiness symbolizing the darkened state of Dahlia's psyche. As Dahlia struggles with her sanity, the supernatural elements weave around her life. Perhaps this is where the film is least successful, as it doesn't have deep enough currents to succeed as a psychological thriller and, as a ghost story; consequently there are times when Dark Water has trouble lifting itself out of the watery muck.<br /><br />Despite Dark Water's apparent dramatic shortcomings, the movie more than makes up for this with it's masses of eerie and ghostly atmosphere. You can almost smell the suffocating dankness in Affonso Beato's redolent, shadow-laced cinematography and in production designer Therese DePrez's appropriately washed-out earth tones. Mike Leonard December 05.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>Hollywood version of 'Dark Water' tries to do something we all long for in great horror films, but seldom get in reality. That is, realistic character and realistic scare, and the film directed by Walter Salles almost succeeds in getting both of them.<br /><br />Probably you should not watch Salles' `Dark Water' as horror whatever your fefinition of horror might be. It does not show many deaths, and its mystery is almost non-existent. The story is not complicated. A mother and a daughter move into an apartment in Roosevelt Island, New York City, but in this small room a series of strange things start to happen, for example, a leak from the ceiling, or sound of someone walking, coming from the room above, where no one should be living.<br /><br />But the modernized ghost story has in its center the characters drawn by novelist/screenwriter Rafael Yglesias (`Fearless'), whose interest does not seem to lie in telling a traditional horror story. Instead, Jennifer Connelly plays the loving mother Dahlia, who is in the middle of custody battle over the daughter Cecillia. Not being able to afford an expensive place, she rents an old apartment room to live with her lovely daughter, but what she is really afraid of is not the dark corridor or dirty basement of the building, but that one day she might lose her daughter. In that case the smooth-talking landlord (John C. Reilly) or grim old super (Pete Postlethwaite) do not help. Or, perhaps, Tim Roth's lawyer who uses his car as office.<br /><br />You see, `Dark Water' is a curious mixture of classic-type horror and classic-type drama. If Dahlia is driven to nervous breakdown, it might be because of the acrimonious fight against husband (Dougray Scott), or because of her own fear that her daughter might be going away from her, or maybe Dahlia's own past that is suggested in the opening. The emotion of some scenes is, some say, more suitable for much more `serious' dramas.<br /><br />Though they are fairly interesting, these aspects of the script about divorce court only weaken the supernatural part of the film, for which it was originally made. We surely see the dropping water from the ceiling, and the black stain that grows bigger and bigger everyday, but that only makes us think that they need a good plumber and less irresponsible super. Yes, the production designs of the building are superb, always creepy enough, but when we are greatly impressed with these spooky images, we forget anything about the not-so-rare story about the husband who left, or the custody fight.<br /><br />It was only three years ago that I watched the original 'Dark Water' (or 'Honogurai Mizuno Soko Kara') in Kyoto's old Toho-theatre, and as far as I can remember, the film didn't show much about the mother's past because it does not have to. Well-crafted as it is, this original film was not a big hit in Japan in spite of its director Hideo Nakata and the original writer Koji Suzuki, the same team who gave us the chilling 'Ringu.' I still don't know why it failed to attract many people, but whatever it is, Hollywood decided on adding materials to the Japanese version. It is laudable that they gave it an intelligent, psychological elements, but if you want a horror to be really scary, and supernatural story more fascinating, intelligence and psychology (and lawyer and custody) may not be necessarily the best choice to do so.</p></br><a href="../users/A3W13VVBRY5GL7.html">A3W13VVBRY5GL7</a><br/><p>"Dark Water" is the 2005 remake of the hugely successful Japanese movie, "Honogurai mizu no soko kara", released in 2002. American remakes of Japanese movies have had varying degrees of success - The Grudge and The Ring, risible sequels notwithstanding, had plenty more good points than bad ones, helping them to stand out from the mire of flash-flash-bang-bang 'horror' movies that Hollywood has deemed fit to release over the last few years.<br /><br />Remakes are a tricky thing to get right: if it goes wrong you end up with what might essentially be a decent movie but is shunned by all and sundry because it's not enough like the original - or else too similar. Gus Van Sant's 'Psycho' immediately springs to mind - a great cast, beautiful direction and an extremely faithful remake which was shot down by critics and the public alike.<br /><br />Which brings us to the first thing I noticed about "Dark Water", it's a very, very faithful remake of the Japanese movie, with some truer references to Koji Suzuki's 1998 short story 'Floating Water', which spawned the original film. Jennifer Connelly's character is developed more, we see more reasons for her apparent psychoses and the nature of her relationship with her ex-husband is further developed. Similarly, Ariel Gade as daughter Ceci is a more well-rounded, fully-realised character than Ikuko in the Japanese movie. None of this characterisation spills over into overstatement, either, which is a nice thing.<br /><br />The script is really very good, there's a minumum of schlocky dialogue and next-to-no verbal diarrhoea or monologing, making this movie a refreshing change from so, so many of Hollywood's recent failed attempts at horror - "Omen 666" and "Silent Hill" immdiately spring to mind as stellar examples of lousy scriptwriting.<br /><br />On the acting front, Connelly and Gade give powerhouse performances as the mother and daughter duo plagued by the supernatural, and I must say, Ariel Gade's performance is one of the best given by a child actor in recent memory. Supporting cast turns are amply provided by the always-watchable John C. Reilly and generally so-so Pete Poistlethwaite. Dougray Scott turns in a great performance as Connelly's ex, his scenes towards the end of the movie make the character more human and more three-dimensional than his Japanese counterpart.<br /><br />Direction is competent, and, in places, very effective. Walter Salles' use of a very desaturated palette and lots of angular shadows lend a real sense of visual isolation to the movie, and, on the whole, "Dark Water" is a visually very pleasing movie.<br /><br />So why only two stars? Well, I am sorry to say it, but "Dark Water" is just not frightening. It does not achieve what it sets out to do, it does not scare us. And that's a big, big shame, considering that most all of the other elements are very solid. Sadly, no amount of decent acting, good direction and a plausible script can save this movie from the fact that it's lost so, so much in the translation from East to West. What made "Honogurai mizu no soko kara" so wonderful was perhaps the ambiguity of the characters, their emotional unavailability providing plenty room for the audience's imagination to manouevre. In fleshing the characters out more, "Dark Water" removes that ambiguity, and leaves us with a very black-and-white retelling of a story where the grey areas should provide the thrills.<br /><br />Disappointing, but you might enjoy it as a rental?</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>Dark Water (Walter Salles, 2005)<br /><br />I was all set to write this great review about how Salles had broken the "brilliant South American directors imported to Hollywood" jinx, how Dark Water was the best remake of a Japanese New Horror film America had ever seen, with seven hundred or so words waxing philosophic on what it takes to adapt a Japanese flick to American audiences and how Salles and Rafael Yglesias had managed to capture it all so very, very well.<br /><br />Then came the last fifteen minutes of the movie, which I am convinced neither Salles nor Yglesias had anything to do with (and I'm not terribly sure anyone else who made the beginning of the film did, either). It's like an alien EMP washed over the set and clicked everyone's brains off, turning Dark Water from an intelligent, scary film into the kind of preprocessed pablum that Hollywood horror films have been made of, in bulk, since I Walked with a Zombie. (For the record, there is almost no doubt in my mind that the hand of producer Roy Lee was far more involved in the final fifteen minutes of this film than the first ninety.)<br /><br />So I'll do my best to concentrate on the first ninety minutes of the film when writing this review, because you really should see that part of it. After that, turn it off and go rent the original Hideo Nakata film from 2002, which has a far more satisfying ending to it. Besides, you should see all of Nakata's movies, which are uniformly brilliant.<br /><br />Salles (Central Station, The Motorcycle Diaries) and Yglesias (Death and the Maiden) took Taka Ichise (To Sing of Love)'s original script (based on a short story-- not a novel, as both the film and IMDB mistakenly tell you-- by Koji Suzuki, the guy behind Ring) and did a good deal of work on it, which may be the first time since the remake craze began that a script has really been reworked to an extensive degree by a top-notch screenwriter. The end result was good enough to lure some pretty big talent, and it all comes together quite well for an hour and a half.<br /><br />Dahlia (Requiem for a Dream's Jennifer Connelly) is presently going through a divorce from her husband, Kyle (Dougray Scott, from the highly anticipated upcoming TV series Heist) that's getting nasty. Caught between the two is their daughter Ceci (Ariel Gade, of the TV series Invasion). Kyle is moving to Jersey City; Dahlia can't afford that, so she goes looking at project-style apartments on Roosevelt Island. Murray (Gangs of New York's John C. Reilly), a slick used-car type, tries to sell Dahlia on a one-bedroom in a building Ceci describes as "creepy," but by the time they've finished looking at the apartment, Ceci desperately wants to live there. No sooner have they moved in than odd things start happening, all having to do with water.<br /><br />Connelly, Scott, Gade, Reilly, Pete Postlethwaite (The Constant Gardener), Camryn Manheim (The Tenth Kingdom), an utterly unrecognizable Tim Roth (Reservoir Dogs), and an even more unrecognizable Elina Lowensohn (The Wisdom of Crocodiles) all turn in wonderful performances in this movie. (Well, okay, every time you see "this movie" from here on out, add "the first ninety minutes of" beforehand.) The only constants are Connelly and Lowensohn, who plays her mother in flashbacks (the two of them constitute a kind of good-and-evil matrix around whom the rest of the film revolves); everyone else is a variable, and all of them play their variability exceptionally well. The horror-film aspects of what's going on (which become readily apparent within the first half-hour, but I still won't spoil them for you if you haven't seen the original)almost take a backseat to the far more human drama of Dahlia's life, both in the present (the divorce, her harrassment at the hands of a couple of stoner punks who live in the building) and the past (flashbacks to the hatred and ultimate abandonment she suffered at the hands of her alcoholic mother). As it should be.<br /><br />Those of you who have seen the original will no doubt have realized by now that much of what I'm highlighting in the remake was nowhere to be found in the original. And this is what makes the remake of Dark Water such a potentially great film; while it kept the trappings of the original, it is very much its own beast, and Yglesias' script seems almost as if he read through Ichise's original a few times, read Suzuki's story a few times for good measure, then sat down to write the horror version of Kramer vs. Kramer, but without the gratuitous JoBeth Williams nude scene. (Which, I feel compelled to add, Dark Water suffers for lacking.) It's an Yglesias script more than it is an adaptation of an Ichise script, and Yglesias is a great scriptwriter.<br /><br />Of course, none of this holds for the movie's final quarter-hour, which exists solely for the purpose of throwing an a whole bunch of cool special effects, and has none of the atmosphere, pacing, and feeling of denouement as the last quarter-hour of the original script does. If you overlook that, this is a film well worth your time. Unfortunately, it's impossible to overlook. ** ?</p></br><a href="../users/A2PIX2K56IZZYX.html">A2PIX2K56IZZYX</a><br/><p>I really was going to give Dark Water 2 stars, but looking back and after arguing with my wife (She really liked it) it's not too bad. I think what swayed me to the 3 star side was the acting, all who are in it do quite well, no over-acting, and with a couple of scene stealers. It seems Dahlia (Jennifer Connelly) is in the middle of a tense custody battle with her ex, he wants her to move closer to him so they can have joint custody, while she wants to move farther away in the city because it's cheaper. She wins (at first) and her and her daughter move to a dumpy, dreary, run-down apartment building in lower Manhattan. Just so happens there was a little girl who was abused and mis-treated by her parents who eventually died, that lived in the apartment right above Dahlia's. Her ghost is not pleased, and soon takes after Dahlia's daughter as the two of them look identical, and she also wants Dahlia to be her new mother.<br /><br />The first 45 minutes are really boring, it takes the movie way too long to get going, but when it does, the last 45 minutes are pretty entertaining. Also, this movie is way to dark, there is little lighting to speak of, and what lighting there is does the viewer no good cuz' you can't see a thing!! I know dark scenes are important to a horror/mystery movie, but not overkill, okay? And of course this got the dreaded 'unrated' tag, which if you have read any of my previous reviews, you know I'm not a big fan of.........at all.<br /><br />As I said earlier, the cast is strong, Connelly plays Dahlia well, a strong, loving mother, but with so many past demons, a brutal custody battle, and her daughter's imaginary friend, she slowly loses control and begins to question her own sanity. John C. Reilly plays Mr. Murray, the owner of the building who talks Dahlia and her daughter into moving in. He is kind of a sleaze but helps Dahlia out in getting her apartment's many leaks and roof damage fixed (These are curteous of our upset little ghost) Pete Postlethwaite plays Veeck, the building's maintenance man, Pete is a character actor who has been around forever and played in over 45 movies. His character wants to somewhat help, but turns out to be more of a creepy guy who plays into the plot more then you will think. Tim Roth, who I've always liked, plays Dahlia's lawyer Platzer, and he is great. He has a meeting with Dahlia in his car, because his office is being "painted" Turns out he has no office and works out of his car, but it's ok, he is still a decent lawyer nad helps in getting Mr. Murray and Veeck to clean up the apartment.<br /><br />Now here is the strongest reason I can give for the 3 stars instead of 2....Ariel Gade, she plays Cici, Connelly's daughter, and she is phenomenal. Besides being absolutely adorable, she is also quite the little actress, and though it doesnt say in the credits, I think she also plays Natasha, the little girl who dies and comes back to take Dahlia and Cici. I say this because they look exactly alike, and that would be something if this little girl was able to play such a strong dual role....I know alot of people like Dakota Fanning, and I do to, she is a hell of an actress, but watch out for this kid, she could really be something.<br /><br />So, ok story, strong cast, very little suspense or horror, I know this is a remake of a popular Japanese movie, and I hear it's much better. I am a huge fan of both The Ring and The Grudge, both remakes of Japanese movies, Dark Water comes nowhere close to those two, but it's worth the 3.79 for a decent nighs's viewing.<br /><br />acting.....4 stars, Connelly and Reilly are terrific, but remember the name Ariel Gade<br /><br />directing.....3 stars, Maybe the director of the Japanese version could have improved this a bit.<br /><br />special effects....3 stars, Lots and lots of water....too much water<br /><br />horror rating....2.5 stars, Very little scares and chills, a few creepy moments, but generally pretty slow<br /><br />quality.....2.5 stars, Way to dark!!! It's very hard to focus on a scene you know is important when you can't see the dang thing!!</p></br><a href="../users/AIIR8E34EDKCQ.html">AIIR8E34EDKCQ</a><br/><p>I'm glad I got to experience this movie in the theater. Sitting there in an almost empty Thursday movie viewing with a friend, I felt what the movie wanted to portray.<br /><br />I loved the emphasis on the wet, dark, cold, goose bump chilling visuals.<br /><br />Dahlia (Jennifer Connelly) was a wonderfully convincing, loving and beautiful to look on film mother to her little daughter.<br /><br />She moved to Roosevelt Island, because it's what she can afford and takes up an apartment in a cold, unsavory and plain gloomy building. From the beginning every scene in the building had this knot in your throat feeling that something is not right, you almost feel an approaching colossos of doom spreading it's dark wings over their entire life.<br /><br />The water theme is constantly running through the movie, from dripping coming from her bedroom ceiling, to the mystery of the apartment upstairs, to the weird super who might be hiding something, to her ex husband who is giving her a hard time and back to her daughter who takes up talking to an imaginary Friend.<br /><br />This was a long, but visually rich movie. Every time I drive on the bridge ( i live in NYC) and see Roosevelt Island, I always remember this movie, and I get goosebumps.<br /><br />This is a great movie to put on a cold, rain night, with a cup of hot cocoa, a blanket and someone to hold your hand while you watch.<br /><br />I love the ending; how everything unraveled and then came together, altho I think I let a tear fall down my cheek, hey I'm sensitive, I can cry easily. So go see it before you judge it, its great.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BPDFR58H9575.html">A2BPDFR58H9575</a><br/><p>Dark Water, the first English language movie directed by Brazilian Walter Salles (Central Station, Motorcycle Diaries) is a very good movie. This is the type of intelligent non-slasher horror films that I enjoy. Its power is not in showing gore and roaring monsters but in the creating the atmosphere of unbearable tension and in making the very familiar everyday things and situations ominous, gloomy, and ready to hurt. Dark Water is also about very real and sympathetic characters, a young single mother and her little girl, and the bond and love between them. It is about real monsters of abuse, negligence, and criminal indifference that could and would affect a child's future life and lead to the tragic event at some point. I did not see the original Japanese movie of which Dark Water is a remake but I found this remake set in the creepiest apartment building on the Roosevelt Island, NY imaginable, a very underrated, good on its own merits and certainly worth watching drama/psychological thriller with the elements of supernatural thriller. Acting is first class. Jennifer Connelly in a truly heartbreaking performance as a recently divorced woman trying to move on together with her little daughter deserves a special mention and respect. John C. Reilly, Tim Roth, Pete Postlethwait, and Dougray Scott all made their characters interesting and memorable. It was nice to see Camryn Manheim in a small cameo. Two young girls also were very good. The camera work by Alfonso Beato, who more recently shot the award winning films "All About My Mother" (1999) "Ghost World" (2001), "The Queen" (2006), and "Love in the Time of Cholera" is amazing. The apartment where Dahlia and Cecil moved, had a strong and scary personality, and could be consider another very important film's character. If I add that the original music to the film was written by Angelo Badalamenti, the usual David Lynch's collaborator, you'd have a good idea of the surreal dark atmosphere of the film. I recommend it but do not expect a pure horror flick. Dark Water is deeper than that.<br /><br />3.5-4.0 of 5</p></br><a href="../users/A30TK6U7DNS82R.html">A30TK6U7DNS82R</a><br/><p>DARK WATER's a good horror film, if a bit overlong, and it's fueled by the passionateb performance of Jennifer Connelly as Dahlia, a woman with mother problems of her own and a history of mental instability (or merely migraines)?  Her intensity is mirrored by her little girl, Cecilia (Ariel Gade), who is like a little "Mini Me" version of Dahlia, and just as exquisite.  I remember this little girl from INVASION, and I hope the poor thing doesn't grow up with hydrophobia after her exposure to dripping ghoulish water in this film and in that ill-fated Everglades based sci fi series.<br /><br />I kept flashing back to Connelly herself as the world's most beautiful little girl actress, in Dario Argento's giallo PHENOMENA, where she had the strange power to talk to insects and make them obey her.  Just as Dahlia and Cecilia seem to be haunted by the spirit of a little girl ghost turned malevolent by the trauma of being abandoned by her mother and father (and possibly murdered by a building super?), it seemed that Connelly's American schoolgirl in Italy in PHENOMENA was also "acting out" from being abandoned by her father, an American movie star on the order of Sylvester Stallone (or Al Pacino).  Thus I think Walter Salles picked out the perfect actress to play the central part in DARK WATER, for so many of his shots recall Jennifer Connelly as a young girl, so that the performance itself is haunted by an earlier performance, and we see like X-rays the bones that made this presence work.<br /><br />I didn't understand if Dougray Scott, whom Dahlia spies talking to two evil teens who menace the building and its occupants, was in cahoots with them for real, perhaps paying them to drive his former wife crazy, or is Dahlia just paranoid?  I'd be sort of paranoid myself, especially if I sat down for a nap and didn't wake up for 24 hours.  Salles and his screenwriters lay on the agony a little thick, but how can they help themselves when they have one of the USA's most expressive actresses to bring their torments to life.  One thing I don't understand about Japanese-based horror films, don't the angry ghosts ever find a shred of happiness, or do they always just want revenge on the living?  If so, why doesn't the little Russian girl go after Pete Postlethwaite?</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6X0DAM87GN4.html">A3C6X0DAM87GN4</a><br/><p>People who walk into "Dark Water" expecting a scary horror slasher film will be greatly disappointed. But those expecting a thought provoking, intelligent, psychological thriller may very well be pleased.<br /><br /> Jennifer Connelly stars as Dahlia, a woman who is going through a messy divorce with Kyle (Dougray Scott) who keeps calling his wife crazy, and we wonder why these two are breaking up. It seems Dahlia did in fact have an unstable childhood due mostly to her mother abandoning her. And forget about the father, he's never seen or talked about.<br /><br /> But Dahlia's childhood is starting her mirror her daughter's, Ceci (Ariel Gade). Dahlia does not want Ceci to feel that she or her father will abandon her.<br /><br /> In an attempt to find a cheap apartment in New York (good luck) she finds one in Roosevelt Island, and as her daughter aptly points out, "that's not the city mommy". Children are becoming so smart nowadays, it must be the internet.<br /><br /> As soon as we see the apartment our first instinct is to run, but Dahlia has to find a place to live and get a job so she will seem capable of taking care of her daughter. Mr. Murray (John C. Reilly) does his best to convince Dahlia that with a new coat of paint the place will look fantastic. And then there's that black hole on the wall that he decides not to talk about. But, oh well, its probably nothing, right?<br /><br /> "Dark Water" is the best Japanese horror remake I have seen. I don't find Japanese horror films scary. I find them dull and boring. I think the structure of the film's are confusing. The characters underdevolped. I didn't get a kick out of either "Ring" movie nor did I enjoy the film "Ju-On". I did however think the American remake "The Grudge" did a good job of making sense of that series. But "Dark Water" is more about the people than the cheap thrills. Director Walter Salles ("Central Station", "The Motorcyle Diaries") surprisingly turns out to be a good choice for directing this type of movie. Like all of the films I've seen from him this one has an appealing look. The colors in the film perfectly match the mood of the movie.<br /><br /> And then there's Connelly's performance. She is turing into one of the best actresses we have. I enjoyed her in "House of Sand & Fog", it was one of my favorite movies of 2003. I was glad to see her win an Oscar for "A Beautiful Mind" and I'm glad to see her in this film as well. Connelly is able to make us care about her characater. She brings out all the inner demons going on, or are they real?<br /><br /> But "Dark Water" does take a few misteps. The movie's conclusion I thought was too abrupt. We were expecting more of a struggle. It builds up a great amount of tension and then very gently drops it all. Though in the end "Dark Water" turns into a tender, heartwarming story. It is really a story about a mother's love.<br /><br /> Bottom-line: Director Walter Salles and Jennifer Connelly takes the recent tend in American remakes of Japanese horror films to a new level. The movie is not about scares and sounds that go bump in the night, but instead is about people.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>If it were not for good performances from Jennifer Connelly, John C. Reilly, Tim Roth, and the guy who played the foreign janitor, this movie would have been lacking the key element that makes this film work. The story is basically the same as The Ring (water is used immensely, little girl killed, etc.) and really doesn't provide any true scares. I liked the atmosphere of the old apartment complex and the darkness of the picture, but this is one to rent on DVD and enjoy for a bit cheaper than a movie ticket price. I enjoyed the acting for sure, but sadly the story holds no water.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FUBUJAIGM87T.html">A3FUBUJAIGM87T</a><br/><p>In "Dark Water", a mother and her little girl move into a terribly depressing apartment building in an attempt to build a life together.  The mother is caught in a custody battle for her little girl.  Strange things start happening in their apartment with the appearance of dark water.  A rather morbid mystery lies deep within the walls of this apartment building and the mother and her daughter get caught in the middle of it.<br /><br />Evidently, this is an American remake of the Japanese version of this film also called "Dark Water".  I saw some of the Japanese film and could not get into it.  Interestingly enough, I had a hard time getting into this version as well, but I did sit through it.  To say "Dark Water" is not scary would be an understatement.  Although the acting is decent, the atmosphere in "Dark Water", while certainly present, is largely ineffective at producing any horror or scares in the audience resulting in a totally uncompelling attempt at a horror movie.<br /><br />Some people may argue that "Dark Water" is more of a suspense/mystery movie (I agree) rather than a horror movie, but the movie comes off as incredibly boring and predictable in that regard as well.  The only thing that even raises an eyebrow is the ending, and even that was rather anti-climactic.  If you're interested in the suspense-thriller with some elements of horror, I recommend watching "The Ring" instead, which is clearly superior to "Dark Water" in every conceivable way.  To be perfectly frank, "Dark Water" is one boring movie for this horror movie lover...sorry, just didn't do it for me. Connelly does a decent job as the mother, but certainly not enough to save this watery mess.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZB8B7VQONZA6.html">A2ZB8B7VQONZA6</a><br/><p>DARK WATER<br /><br />This American film based on Hideo Nakata's original movie [which was based on a book so it may not be completely original] is actually a lot better than most American remakes of Asian horror cinema. The first time I watched this movie I was expecting something along the lines of "The Ring" or maybe the "The Grudge" but was pleasantly surprised when this one seemed more surreal. It does an excellent job with the characters and makes the story seem very believable. I had a good time with this one when with others I was really not much of a fan.<br /><br />Dahlia and her daughter Cecelia are looking for a new apartment on Roosevelt Island in New York City, Cecelia needs to live close to a good school it seems. Dahlia has a new job and at the same time is going through a divorce with a husband that does not trust her judgment. Once they find a place strange things start to happen like a constant water leak that is in her daughter's room. Also add in the strange noises coming from the place above her place and you have a cool little film a brewing. Of course you can't forget that this is a mystery/ghost story at heart.<br /><br />Director Walter Salles does a nice job in letting the story tell its self instead of pushing things along at a fast pace. He also elects to let the characters build on them selves and actually develop, that seems rare now a days. Also writer Rafael Yglesias [also a writer on the Johnny Depp flick "From Hell] did a nice job in this American version. To be completely honest with you I was not expecting a ghost story like this one from this one. I really felt that it would look like every other remake that has come out since "The Ring".<br /><br />The thing that really makes this film interesting is the acting from this top notch cast, every one did a good job on this one. Jennifer Connelly is great as Dahlia Williams and makes the character seem like an actual person. Her daughter is played by Ariel Gade who like Jennifer does a great job which is rare for child actors, especially in this type of film. Of course the ever excellent Tim Roth is brilliant in this film as a lawyer who actually comes to this lady's aid when she needs it. John C. Reilly may steal the show some what as the shady land lord who always makes a promise he can not keep. Dougray Scott, Pete Postlethwaite, and Camryn Manheim all also give excellent performances.<br /><br />As the film goes on it goes from being about pesky neighbors to a ghost story to a crime mystery and it still manages to feel like the same film. This is not the best movie ever and may not be for every body but it definitely will appeal to some. I would recommend this one to any fan of mystery films or ghost stories. By the way the ending to this is excellent.</p></br><a href="../users/AIMR915K4YCN.html">AIMR915K4YCN</a><br/><p>My main reason for watching DARK WATER was the presence of the amazing Jennifer Connelly (Labyrinth, Phenomena, Dark City, Requiem For A Dream). She has a beauty and innocence that I find captivating. As Dahlia Williams, Ms. Connelly has this same charming quality, while going through a living hell. Dahlia is being assaulted on three separate levels. She is haunted by the terrible memories of her childhood, dogged by the insanity of her current, ugly divorce, and plagued by the ghostly happenings in her apartment building. Dahlia and her daughter, Cecelia are in the middle of a black storm of  overwhelming forces. A combination that would drive most souls to despair, most minds to break down. Watching this poor woman go through this ordeal is downright depressing, yet Connelly plays it w/ her usual grace. DARK WATER is a supernatural mystery. Beyond that, it is a story about the undying love of one mother for her daughter in the face of abandonment,  desolation, and mounting terror. I watched it twice, and liked it more the second time around...</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>Dark Water starring Jennifer Connelly had great potential as a psychological thriller but this film is a let down. First of all, the premise seems smart but by the end of the film I am confused by all the chracters never shown in the climax. Connelly is a wonderful actress and she is perfect for the part but I wish her character had more to do rather just puttering around the apartment all day. This film is not terrrible, it's just so-so. Decide for yourself on this one.</p></br><a href="../users/A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z.html">A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z</a><br/><p>I did enjoy the theatrical  edition, but the unrated disc  takes the experience to a whole new level. It is an ambivalent level, since the special features specifically state that  there are "two explanations" for  all the things that happen, i.e.  one psychological, one supernatural. However, this seems to be more of a producers pretensions of grandeur, than a real explanation.<br />It is a film that indulges in more of a character  driven  exposition of the story, so that in that respect, you  have to work more at enjoying the film. It's  definitely not an FX  driven film, but as the special  features  show, there are "FX" done so that the sound stage in Canada can be integrated with the Roosevelt island  background. The sound is totally awesome , in that with a 5.1  system, and the sound turned up, you can experience what is a very edgy film in this unrated version.<br />Play times for the film vary, some say  103, some, like  AMAZON, say 105, and overall this is not clear, but the extra few, or the different few minutes done in this  edit pay off immensely in a very watchable, listenable, and experiential  film.<br />The extras are very enjoyable; they add to the experience of the film, and show in detail, the elements of the almost indie film. The power is really in the casting for the  script, and whilst the editing could have flowed a little  better, the sound covers much of the fragmented editing. And the sound is clearly an additional character/feature to the film ( as is the water, to say the least). The deleted scenes are not many, but at least one scene  should have stayed in ... worth seeing this part to see if the scenes should have stayed the same or not. Whilst the visual editing is debatably fragmented, it might be that the fragmenting expresses a side of the characters experience... but, thats in the eye of the beholder, I assume.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ATTCCO32ZXET.html">A3ATTCCO32ZXET</a><br/><p>Once upon a time, one Japanese horror film translated successfully into a Hollywood production (The Ring, i.e. Ringu).  This film's popularity made many American producers rich, and they were convinced they had founded the new age of Horror in the United States with this formula.  Since then, Hollywood has made three more attempts at reproducing this early success; first by importing and subtitling Ju-on, then remaking The Grudge and now Dark Water.  Dark water is by far the most boring of these three ghost story failures.<br /><br />Oooh, that's harsh you say?  Let's see, in order for a Horror film to be any good it has to be, at the very least, interesting enough to keep the viewer's attention.  The director seems to hope that heavily filtered, moody cinematography will do that job instead of good old-fashioned storytelling.  With a very slow pace and a forgettable story (which I won't bother with), Dark Water loses the audience quickly.  The "gotcha" moments, when they do arrive, lack that visceral impact which Horror fans live for.  About halfway through I just stopped caring for the characters' fates and wished the ghost would push them all into the river or something so that it would be over.<br /><br />Sadly, the crown jewel of Dark Water is the critically acclaimed actress Jennifer Connelly.  She is largely wasted here, although she does a fair job with the material she's been given to work with.  If you're madly in love with Jennifer, I should inform you now that she is shot though so much atmospheric filterage that her gorgeousness is dulled with a dark greenish cast.  And as for you lustful ones, she isn't revealing much skin in this flick, either.<br /><br /> Please, can this one be the last of this tired Horror subgenre?<br /><br />-Andrea, aka Merribelle</p></br><a href="../users/A2B3Z2QHW3V35S.html">A2B3Z2QHW3V35S</a><br/><p>This is a cool movie.

Normally this kind of plot line could be a pit fall for clich&eacute;s and highly predictable setups, but thankfully this movie is in the hands of a skilled director and fronted by likable and funny performers.<br /><br />Rawson Marshall Thurber writes and directs a highly entertaining, low brow, feel good story that utilizes a game most of us played in our youth.  When I played we called it Warball, but it was generally the same.  In the movie, the plot basically follows a charismatic, likeable slacker Peter LaFleur (Vince Vaghn) who owns a lackluster gym called Average Joe's.  Financially he's in over his head, and he doesn't really care.  He's smart and capable, but unmotivated and lacks the confidence.  He's facing bankruptcy, foreclosure and a buyout from the big franchise Globo Gym, run by the feather haired, Fu-manchu sporting narcissist White Goodman (played well over the top by Ben Stiller, but certainly one of his funniest roles).  Lafleur and a misfit group of his gym members decide to enter the professional Dodge ball circuit and go to Las Vegas to win the money needed to keep their gym open.<br /><br />Enter Kate Veatch (Christine Taylor, Stiller's real life wife) as the bank rep who is pursued by Goodman but finds herself drawn to Peter.  So much so she joins his group of underachievers in the competitions, baring a softball pitch cannon of an arm.<br /><br />After a hilarious regional bout with a group a girl scout-like opponents, the group find themselves on their way to Vegas with a chance to prove themselves and win the cash.  The dodge ball bouts are definitely the highlight of the movie.  Anyone who has seen the `Terry Tate: Office Linebacker' commercials can tell the kinetic style transfers well to the big screen.  The climax features a showdown between the Globo Gym and Average Joe's.  The rest of the cast is well placed, especially role of Patches O'Houlihan played by Rip Torn, and the younger version played by Hank Azaria.  The number of cameos is impressive as well; William Shatner, Chuck Norris, Lance Armstrong, David Hasselhoff as the German teams coach and especially funny is Jason Bateman as a former Dodge ball champ turned analyst whose commentary leaves intellect at the front door.  In all, this is a feel good movie for adults, probably more directed at men, but still funny for all.  Using a childhood memory, whether good or bad, and making it funny and entertaining.  For everyone who probably wasn't very good at the game as a kid, this movie will make you believe you can be good at it as an adult.</p></br><a href="../users/A1K31NF81TS0CO.html">A1K31NF81TS0CO</a><br/><p>While not one of my favorite Ben Stiller movies, it definitely was funny.  I enjoyed the comic oddity scenes, with many freaks,and geeks.  I thought the whole idea of Professional Dodgeball, was pretty hilarious.  Does this even exist?  I hear you can't play it on school grounds anymore, but maybe that's just a rumor.<br /><br />I loved the characters in this one, as well as the main characters.  The "Marcia Bradey" look-a-like was also nice. Too bad she didn't have any nude scenes.  I could have continued my adolescent male fantasies into modern time.  But I'm sure you don't want to read about that.<br /><br />The last segment, where Ben Stiller was dancing to "My Milkshakes" was worth the price of admission. It really was extremely funny.<br /><br />I suggest you buy or rent this immediately.<br /><br />MC White said:  Check it out!  It rocks!</p></br><a href="../users/A2EUG9W2IAVCT.html">A2EUG9W2IAVCT</a><br/><p>Though not a classic in terms of Hollywood comedies, Dodgeball does have its moments.  The performances (with the exception of the brilliant Justin Long and superb Christine Taylor) sometimes get over the top and so stereotypical they're unbelievable--but the film's many comedic points keep most of those elements out of mind.  Regardless of its obvious flaws Dodgeball is an entertaining and at times inspirational film.</p></br><a href="../users/ASIA7V7CBSKD3.html">ASIA7V7CBSKD3</a><br/><p>This movie wasn't quite as funny as I thought it would be, but it still had lots of laughs in it.  Lance Armstrong makes a great cameo and Ben Stiller plays a great over the top character once again while Vince Vaughn is in his role of a laid back guy just looking to get by.  Really, if you are a fan of anyone in this movie then chances are you will like it.</p></br><a href="../users/A5KJVGJ43ZDC9.html">A5KJVGJ43ZDC9</a><br/><p>I don't usually go for this kind of comedy, but most of this movie slayed me. Director/writer Thurber makes the movie a winner with flying wrenches, a pirate, and the entire cast getting pelted in the face with at least one dodgeball. This movie is tasteless, crass, lowbrow and appeals to the worst in all of us. My worst laughed its tookis off. The David Hasselhoff cameo alone is worth it. Get off your high horse and see this, and break up with anyone who didnt like it.</p></br><a href="../users/A21B2TJBWCSK1R.html">A21B2TJBWCSK1R</a><br/><p>Let's face it, dodgeball is a ridiculous sport. This raises an important (well, not really) question-can it even be called a sport? On the surface, Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story seems to say yes but in actuality it is an accurate parody of this silly activity that one used to play as a child in gym class. Now, it is televised and played by "professionals." It's time to take this ridiculous enterprise down a notch.<br /><br />The attention to details is a part of what makes this such a funny movie. There is the skewering of the many ESPN TV channels as the tournament is shown on ESPN 8 (their slogan is "If it's almost a sport we've got it here."). The two sports commentators are played with gusto by Gary Cole and Jason Bateman who gleefully spout many funny, off-the-cuff comments that make fun of these kinds of broadcasters.<br /><br />There is an audio commentary by writer/director Rawson Marshall Thurber and actors Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn. Thurber mentions that he wrote the roles specifically for Stiller, Vaughn and Justin Long. Stiller and Vaughn comment on scenes with dry, sardonic humour while Thurber plays the straight man.<br /><br />There are seven deleted scenes with optional commentary from Thurber. He mentions that they were cut for time and pacing. There is some good footage here, including more with Justin (Long) and his dream of being a cheerleader.<br /><br />Also included is a more downbeat alternate ending with optional commentary from Thurber. He mentions that test audiences didn't like it and the studio forced him to re-shoot it, even leaving the production for ten days in protest. This is a rare insight into a problem that he ran into in an otherwise congratulatory collection of extras.<br /><br />"Dodgeball Boot Camp: Training for Dodgeball" features footage of the cast training for the dodgeball sequences. Interestingly, they all had to learn how to dodge and throw the ball like professional dodgeballers.<br /><br />"The Anatomy of a Hit" examines why physical humour is so funny. Thurber explains that the tendency for an actor is to flinch before you're hit by an object.<br /><br />"Justin Long: A Study in Ham and Cheese" features a scene with the actor adlibbing as he mentally prepares himself for dodgeball followed by a montage of many ball hits that he endured for a scene.<br /><br />"Dodgeball: Go for the Gold" has Stiller and Vaughn making a mock-plea for dodgeball to be considered as an Olympic sport.<br /><br />There is the obligatory blooper/gag reel that features the usual blown lines and, not surprisingly, some of the nasty hits that the camera took from well-placed dodgeball throws by Stiller.<br /><br />Finally, there are two theatrical trailers.<br /><br />Dodgeball lives up to its subtitle by being a much better movie than it should have been. Sure, there is the requisite crude humour (gratuitous ball shots to the groin) but also right on the money parodies of fitness clubs and the fascination with sports that have no business being called such. Dodgeball is mindless entertainment but done in an engaging way that is a lot of fun to watch.</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>Well, here is yet another sleazy PG-13 modern-day comedy that also has genuinely funny characters and scenes. For those of us who care it's a shame we have have to put up with the bad stuff if you want laughs out of about any comedy made in the last 30 years....and this is a prime example. By the way, this is an "R" all the way, if any concerned parents are reading this. You need a computer to add up all the sex jokes in here and the last 30 minutes are really, really stupid.<br /><br />Prior to the typically-dumb ending are some very funny moments, mostly provided by Ben Stiller's over-the-top fitness guru, "White Goodman," a man who runs an ultra high-tech fitness center. Vince Vaughan plays the likable good guy small-gym owner who is in competition with Stiller, sort of like David against Goliath, the nerds against the jocks.....another formula that is so often used these days in comedies because it's always fun to see the little guy knock off the arrogant big jerk.<br /><br />Christine Taylor is the token young "hottie" that you also see in these kind of pictures: skinny, pretty, but not exactly the wholesome type.<br /><br />Rip Torn almost steals the show as "Patches O'Houlihan," the old man who helps coach the underdog volleyball team using some unorthodox methods. I laugh every time I think of him. In fact, "Patches" puts the added edge in this film to elevate it slightly above a "fair" rating.<br /><br />A lot of the humor in here is the improbableness of the whole story. Of course, it's an insult to anyone's intelligence but that's part of the charm and one does get a decent amount of laughs for an hour-and-half, so it's not all bad.</p></br><a href="../users/AE4JNORCLW8F6.html">AE4JNORCLW8F6</a><br/><p>A superb cast, super-funny script and lots of fun loaded with physical comedy make Dodgeball a winner. Never a lull in the laughs, this film is an upbuilding, fun flick to share with friends. Rooting for the underdog is an exciting and hilarious experience. Watch with friends.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>I have to say I was quite wary about this film. I'm not Ben Stiller's biggest fan. Never have been, never will be. His humour just does not appeal to me. And I always get him & Adam Sandler muddled up. I swear they're the same guy. Why is it as well that they put a very bad wig and moustache on him, and do their best to make him look like a very bad porn star? Surely he didn't think he looked good?! And I have never seen a film with Vince Vaughn before. The only things I know about him is that he's very tall (and I'm very small, so I won't be standing next to him anytime soon), and he's rumoured to be dating Jennifer Aniston.<br /><br />Isn't Dodgeball a game you would play in primary school? Well, it certainly is now, with the influence of the game. I have to say I would have failed miserably at this game. I have no hand-to-eye co-ordination, and if I have to avoid something (like a ball coming flying at you), then I'd walk straight into it. And how many shots were there in the movie of a poor guy getting hit in the ... y'know? I'm not a guy, but have been told that the pain is indescribable, and you certainly do not get up straight afterwards, and carry on. Now, if I was crossing my legs during the film, what would an average guy be doing?! It's too scary to think about.<br /><br />Was it deliberate that extremely tall people surrounded Ben Stiller? Vince Vaughn must be well over 6ft, and there was also that guy who was "White's" right-hand-man, who's name sounded a lot like Michelle, he was big too. In fact, most of White's team was taller than him.<br /><br />I have to say compared to other reviews, which have compared this to Kingpin & Baseketball, I disagree. Mind you, I wasn't taken by both films (have I seen both?), and much prefer this movie.<br /><br />I loved Christine Taylor in this (Ben's real life wife! Awwwwwww), I was loving the braids, and the way she played against the stereotypical girl in this film. By the looks of some shots, she really went for it! Even if her hubby did break 3 cameras, and also hit her in the face. (I'll bet he was making up for that later.)<br /><br />The film is very fast-paced, and you'll be sitting on the edge of your seat for most of the film, trying not to bite your nails. There's also quite a few cameos, including absolute hilarious turns by David Hasselhoff & William Shatner. However, I didn't get the cameos by Lance Armstrong, Hank Azaria and who is Chuck Norris?<br /><br />The extras are quite reasonable, the gag reel is so funny! But the rest of it is just your usual bog-standard extras. Nothing special.<br /><br />I quite enjoyed this film, and had a good laugh with it. The wig Ben Stiller is wearing though is unforgivable however. Ugh. Poor Christine.<br /><br />I'm all caught up with my reviews now. xx</p></br><a href="../users/AMYW43AHO16SS.html">AMYW43AHO16SS</a><br/><p>I didn't expect this movie to be this funny!  It is hillarious!  Ben Stiller is a hoot as White, the ego maniac.  Rip Torn is classic as the coach of the improbable team.  But what I enjoyed were the cameos by Chuck Norris, David Hasseloff and William Shatner, who seems to have finally shedded his Capt. Kirk persona.  This movie will have you in stitches.  Get ready to laugh you butt off and try not to drink anything while you're watching!</p></br><a href="../users/A3W1JJGJHRPH4Y.html">A3W1JJGJHRPH4Y</a><br/><p>The movie was silly and little crude. The slapstick humor was continuous and almost boring at times. The plot was cliche and most of the jokes were too. However, the cameos were hilarious. The scene with Lance Armstrong was worth the price of the rental. The cynical appraisal of the sports and fitness industry was very accurate too. The movie made me laugh out loud, which surprised my wife. Ben Stiller was over the top, but the role called for it. He was very funny.</p></br><a href="../users/A3IDMLOWLHWNDJ.html">A3IDMLOWLHWNDJ</a><br/><p>"If you can dodge a wrench, you can dodge a ball."<br /><br />"Your about as useful as a poopy flavored lollipop!"<br /><br />- the coach for the "Average Joe's" gives some helpless advice in "Dodgeball"<br /><br />Vince Vaughn & Ben Stiller star in a film that has balls as big as churchbells. "Dodgeball" is the type of sophmoronic comedy that works along the style of "The Bad News Bears", and any other sports comedy, but, without the gross out gags (with the exception of the overweight Stiller scenes).<br /><br />Vaughn owns "Average Joe's Gym", a decrepit, rundown gym that if Joe owned it, he would probably shoot himself. With most of the members not paying there monthly membership, "Avg. Joe's" hasn't made a penny in almost a year.<br /><br />Stiller plays the owner of "Globo-Gym", a "Golds Gym" style franchise, that's preparing to buy out "Average Joe's" and turn the gym into a parking lot. Vaughn has thirty days to cough up fifty grand and save his gym. A plan formulates when the Joe's of the gym decide to enter into a dodgeball tournament with fifty g's as the grand prize. All bets are off when Stiller, & his "Globo-homos" buy there way into the tournament, planning to crush "Average Joe's" financially and physically.<br /><br />"Dodgeball" has plenty of laughs. Vince Vaughn is at his best (you actually root for the poor shlub). Ben Stiller is o.k. as the "Globo" gym owner and has enough retarded arrogance to scare off his real life wife (she's the lawyer turned dodgeball MVP who helps the "Joe's"). Jason Bateman makes a good cameo as a burnt out announcer.<br /><br />The DVD features include deleted scenes, trailers, easter eggs, and director commentary</p></br><a href="../users/A2B3Z2QHW3V35S.html">A2B3Z2QHW3V35S</a><br/><p>Dodgeball has a lot of funny parts, but its not the best movie out their. The only reason I bought this movie was because Ben Stiller, Christine Taylor, and Vince Vaughn star in it. I thought this movie was going to be one of the best. Maybe I'm just not a dodgeball fan. Either way I wouldn't give this movie Five stars.</p></br><a href="../users/AER15RIMV8E6D.html">AER15RIMV8E6D</a><br/><p>This is a very funny film about a laid-back guy named Peter LaFleur, who is about to lose his decaying gym called Average Joe's because the gym across the street, Globo-Gym owned by White Goodman is a lot better. Peter and his friends must raise $50,000 in 30 days in order to redeem the gym, or White will foreclose on it and turn it into a parking lot. The Average Joe's decide to become a dodgeball team, and the winner gets $50,000. Will the Average Joe's beat White's team and win the money? I highly recommend DODGEBALL: A TRUE UNDERDOG STORY!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />A sly satire of the feel-good sports movie posing as a feel-good sports movie, Dodgeball suffers from a phoned-in performance by Vince Vaughn but otherwise features a number of engaging comic actors and scenes--not a great film, but certainly an amusing one.</p></br><a href="../users/A19VMQDCB4HZ9P.html">A19VMQDCB4HZ9P</a><br/><p>What is there to say about Dodgeball - A True Underdog Movie other than it's a no-brainer of a hilarious movie that doesn't aspire to lofty heights. What it does do is come out firing with some of the funniest physical comedy and one-liners since The Farrelly Brothers' Something About Mary. First time director Rawson Marshall Thurber does a good enough job to keep the laughs coming one right after the another to keep Dodgeball from becoming too repetitive.<br /><br />The movie is a riff from the stock underdog sports genre with a Peter La Fleur (played by Vince Vaughn with his usual sardonic wit) having to find a way to save his Average Joe's Gym from being foreclosed by his bank and turned by a rival hi-tech gym next door into a parking lot. Who else would be the perfect foil for Vince Vaughn's Peter La Fleur but none other than Ben Stiller as the former-fatty turned workout fitness Nazi, White Goodman. Goodman's Globo Gym is a state-of-the art, sterile and BALCO-like gym where insults and making its members feel ugly, fat and useless is the way to clean health and the perfect bod.<br /><br />Already, within the first fifteen minutes, we know who to root for and who to boo. In one corner we have the Average Joe's guys played with comedic timing by Justin Long, Stephen Root, Chris Williams, Alan Tudyk and Joel Moore. Stiller's Goodman and his consigliere Me'Shell (Jamal Duff channelling Barry White) with a hand-picked ringer of a dodgeball team he calls the Purple Cobras. With the two sides set the dodgeball carnage begins as Average Joe's must win the Las Vegas Dodgeball Invitational to earn the $50,000 needed to save the gym. To round out the Average Joe's team will be the bank accountant who ends up sympathizing with the Joe's, Kate Veatch (played by Stiller's real-life wife, Christine Taylor) and Patches O'Houlihan (Rip Torn in a scene-stealing role).<br /><br />Rip Torn is hilarious as the acerbic and insane former Dodgeball great Patches O'Houlihan. He pretty much gets all the best one-liners in the movie the moment he appears on the screen. He coaches the Average Joe's team by browbeating them, insulting them and, failing that, throwing wrenches at them to help them in learning the 5 D's of dodgeball: Dodge, duck, dip, dive, dodge. In fact, I would say that if it wasn't for Rip Torn's character dominating the middle part of the movie, I think Dodgeball's constant ball to the groin shots would've gotten old. Instead Patches O'Houlihan constantly gave people watching a reason to laugh out loud.<br /><br />Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story is a movie that the Academy voters will not think twice about showering with praises and awards, but I'm sure most of them will be watching it and laughing out loud like the rest of the movie-going public. Dodgeball is one hilarious, one-liner after one-liner ball to the nuts funny and it doesn't aspire to be anything else but that. This movie will never get old with each viewing and will continue to make people laugh out loud.</p></br><a href="../users/A2JP0URFHXP6DO.html">A2JP0URFHXP6DO</a><br/><p>Dodgeball is nothing new when it comes to its plot.  It's been one of the most commonly used plots over the past 25 years or so with movies like The Bad News Bears, Major League, Mighty Ducks, and Necessary Roughness.  Basically a group of losers comes together to win the big game and save the day.  In this case Peter (Vince Vaughn) owns a run down old gym called "Average Joes".  He's behind on all his bills and hasn't collected membership dues in over a year.  He needs to come up with $50,000 in a month to save the gym from being taken over by his rival across the street Globo Gym.<br /><br />Globo Gym is run by White Goodman (Stiller) a blow-dryer headed, Tony Little-like obnoxious egomaniac.  The bank brings in a tax attorney kate (Christine Taylor) to go over Average Joe's financial records and to fight off the sleazy Goodman who is constantly hitting on her.<br /><br />To save the Gym, Peter and his rag-tag group of gym misfits decide to enter a dodgeball tournament where the top prize is, of course, $50,000.  Problem is the group has no idea how to play the game and little talent until an ancient doggeball coach, Patches O'hoolihan (Rip Torn) comes in as their mentor.  Well you can pretty much guess the story from here, Right?  No need for me to play spoiler.<br /><br />Despite its forula script, Dodgeball has some funny scenes involving its crew of misfit players.  Such as when they try and raise the money by having a car wash...we cut to a scene of gorgeous women in bikinis getting all wet and soapy and a long line of cars waiting...trouble is...that this is across the street and Average Joe's "All male" car wash has only one customer, a big, redneck who keeps paying the young Justin to wash his pickup over and over again.<br /><br />Stiller plays his role way over the top as a dimwitted diet and workout guru similar to the people you see on late night infomercials.  Stepehen Root plays Gordon, a whipped nebbish type not too unlike the role he played in Office Space.  Gary Cole and Jason Bateman are absoultely hilarious as the broadcast team for "ESPN 8".<br /><br />Dodgeball breaks no new ground but it doesn't try to.  You know going in exactly what's going to happen in the end because it always happens the same way in these movies.  But it's a fairly funny ride to get there with some enjoyably screwy performances from Stiller, Root, Cole, and Bateman.<br /><br />Call it 3 1/2 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A34PAZQ73SL163.html">A34PAZQ73SL163</a><br/><p>I almost turned this one off during the first ten minutes but I am now glad that I didn't.  It started out as semi-ridiculous camp and appeared to be a rehash of Zoolander with Stiller playing another outrageous goofball character.  I also could not buy Vince Vaughn as a broken loser.  No matter what he wears or drives, it's hard not to imagine him being a stud. Yet, overall it was pretty funny.<br /><br />Some of the situational and physical humor was hilarious.  The "all male carwash" was a classic and the movie's highlight may have been a 1930s mock documentary, produced for school children, about dodgeball.  When Vince Vaughn tells a girl scout, "you were adopted and your parents don't love you" I fell apart.  Another awesome line is when he confesses that "when you don't have any goals in life you are never disappointed." Other typical one liners are Rip Torn saying "that dyke can play" and Vaughn's "put your mouth where our balls are."  Torn has a ton of excellent lines and it was hard not to laugh out loud at the sight of their team's S&M uniforms.<br /><br />I recommend this one.  It's good, unclean fun and as politically incorrect as it gets.</p></br><a href="../users/AUHG8KSHI529U.html">AUHG8KSHI529U</a><br/><p>So, here is a silly and vulgar piece of fluff that has some moments that are quite funny.  Vince Vaughn is the broke and nearly ruined Peter Le Fleur, owner of Average Joes Gym, and Ben Stiller is the beyond creepy White Goodman, maniac owner of the successful Globo Gym which is right across the street from the failing Average Joes.  White has taken advantage of Peter's defaulting on his second mortgage to get his paws on Average Joes Gym to tear it down to expand his parking.  Of course, Peter has 30 days to come up with the fifty grand to stay the foreclosure and death of his moribund gym.<br /><br />Steven Root plays Gordon, one of the loveable losers whose non-life revolves around Average Joes.  Gordon reads Obscure Sports Monthly.  It happens they can win the $50,000 if they can win a dodgeball tournament in Vegas.  Never mind the expense or taxes, the amount has to match exactly what is needed because it doesn't really matter at all.  It is just a plot device for the silliness which ensues.<br /><br />Rip Torn plays the wheelchair bound Patches O'Houlihan, the minor deity of the sport of dodgeball.  He takes on the loveable losers and trains them to win the tournament.  He offers the classic line of the movie, "If you can dodge a wrench, you can dodge a ball."<br /><br />Don't expect more than goofey and rough humor and you will have a good time.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>"Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story" provides just enough good-natured low brow humor to make up for the fact that the film is not always as funny as it intends to be.<br /><br />Vince Vaughn takes on the role of straight man as Peter La Fleur, the owner of a third rate gym called "Average Joe's" that caters to the....um...how shall we say it?... less athletically inclined, less single-mindedly health-conscious consumer.  Pete's patrons are all "losers" and social outcasts who find Average Joe's the one place where they can find camaraderie and be accepted for who they really are.  The problem is that, through poor business management, Peter has virtually bankrupted the establishment to the tune of $50,000 that needs to be paid off pronto if he is to maintain ownership of the place.  Enter White Goodman (Ben Stiller), the self-made, egomaniacal owner of a top-of-the-line gym across the street who is determined to force Peter out of business and make it part of his own franchise.  To raise the money, Pete and his comrades form a ragtag dodge ball team and head to Las Vegas to compete in the national championships.  When Goodman gets wind of the plan, he forms his own team to take on Average Joe's less-than-average players in a David and Goliath showdown broadcast on nationwide TV.<br /><br />Most of the humor in "Dodgeball" is of the Three Stooges/hit-one-another-in-the-groin variety that works pretty well for the most part, even if it does tend to become a bit strained and repetitious after awhile.  Vaughn and Stiller have a fun time playing off one another, with the former carefully low balling his performance while the latter bursts forth in a no-holds-barred display of manic energy.  Christine Taylor is also lovely and fine as the bank accountant who starts off rummaging through Peter's financial records and winds up as a star player on his team.  The other cast members are all entertaining as well, and the film features a host of effective cameo performances from the likes of William Shatner, David Hasselhoff, Jason Bateman, Chuck Norris, and Lance Armstrong who really makes a mark in his short, but pivotal and well written scene near the end of the film.  But the real acting honors go to Rip Torn as a crazy, wheelchair-bound coach who uses some mighty unorthodox methods to whip the boys into shape.  Torn is the undisputed comic force at the center of the film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IUI3CJUMB7J0.html">A1IUI3CJUMB7J0</a><br/><p>I really enjoyed this film but it dose have amny stupid moments.

A true comedy in every sense of the word it will have you rolling in laughter and remembering your own experiences with the dreaded dodgeball.<br /><br />In a world of infomercials and faultless people resides the perfect man, White Goodman (Ben Stiller). Goodman owns and controls a state of the art health club and spends his life combing his feathered hair, pumping up and electrocuting himself over donut and pizza cravings. With a personality as shallow as his appearance he is a true specimen of gag reflex in motion! Across the street is a run down gym for "Average Joes" run by a hapless man of little ambition, Pete La Fleur (Vince Vaughn). Goodman and La Fleur soon begin a power struggle over ownership of his little gym and the games begin. SMACK! SPLAT! In order to come up with $50K to save the average joes from being eaten alive by White's arrogant conglomeration La Fleur and his gang of misfit members join a dodgeball tournament. With all seriousness the nerds begin to work out with a legend in the sport and after getting hit by iron wrenches and plenty of balls they end up in Las Vegas for the championship. Needless to say Mr. White and his robotic over-steroided team are also willing to be turned into pulp by a bunch of flying balls...Ouch!!<br /><br />Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn are incredible in their roles as very serious gym owners and it is absolutely impossible not to laugh while watching this film. Christine Taylor (Stiller's real life wife) does an excellent job as the girl both over jockulated men eventually vie for. Rip Torn is hilarious as the urine drinking dodgeball legend who eventually coaches greatness from his wheelchair. The gags and stabs at seekers of perfection are downright on the money with plenty of pumped up pecs and abs to fill an egotists dream. The average joes are all absolutely side-splitting with their uncoordinated efforts and messed up lives. The tournament is filled with subtle innuendos directed at everything funny about Japanese, German, Eastern European and Red Neck American athletes as well as that ever present superior being the Bodybuilder! Cameo appearances by Hank Azaria, Chuck Norris, Lance Armstrong, William Shatner and David Hasselhoff offer a few short moments of additional laughs. But the real hero of this film is the dodgeball itself, that red ball that has instilled so much fear in anyone who has ever faced it while hugging onto a wall cringing. I still can't figure out why watching people get hurt in innocent ways is so funny but I dare you to dodge the giggles that come from watching this movie each and every time someone gets smashed by a flying dodgeball!<br /><br />P.S.....Make sure you watch the credits for additional chuckles by Ben Stiller!!</p></br><a href="../users/A1V3IO23FZFF9L.html">A1V3IO23FZFF9L</a><br/><p>Dodgeball is great. Stiller is funny as always (a little bit of Heavy Weights in his character) The supporting cast is great, with Taylor, Roots, Cole, and Bateman. The cameos will also make you laugh. Very enjoyable.</p></br><a href="../users/A25ZVI6RH1KA5L.html">A25ZVI6RH1KA5L</a><br/><p>Dodgeball...I remember it well, back from my grade school days...always aim for the face...or the `nads...and now there's actually league of adults out there playing it on a professional level?  I'll never understand the absurdity of the regressive attitudes tied into taking the simplistic games we enjoyed playing when we were children and turning them into professional sporting events...I dunno, it kinda takes the magic out of being a kid...just my opinion, I suppose.  Written and directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber (Terry Tate, Office Linebacker), Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story (2004) stars Vince Vaughn (Old School, Be Cool) and Ben Stiller (Meet the Parents, Starsky & Hutch).  Also appearing is Stiller's wife Christine Taylor (The Brady Bunch Movie, The Wedding Singer), Rip Torn (The Beastmaster, Airplane II: The Sequel), Justin Long (Jeepers Creepers), Stephen Root ("NewsRadio", Office Space), Joel Moore (Art School Confidential), Chris Williams (Friday After Next), Alan Tudyk (I, Robot), Jason Bateman ("Arrested Development"), and Hank Azaria, the man behind the voice of Moe Szyslak, Chief Wiggum, Apu, Comic Book Guy, Cletus, Prof. Frinkon, to name a few, on the TV show The Simpsons.<br /><br />As the movie begins we meet a character by the name of Peter La Fleur (Vaughn), owner and proprietor of the Average Joe's Gym.  Business could certainly be better, but then Peter seems a soft touch, especially since he hasn't collected dues from his rather unique and distinctive membership (one guy thinks he's a pirate, and swears he'll pay off his debt once he remembers where he buried his treasure) in over a year.  Anyway, seems the bank is in the process of foreclosure, prompted by Peter's competition in that of the highly narcissistic White Goodman (Stiller), who runs the high tech Globo Gym `Here at Globo Gym we're better than you, and we know it' across the street, having designs on acquiring the property, leveling it, and turning it into a auxiliary parking lot for his elite clientele.  Peter learns from bank representative Kate Veatch (Taylor) that in order to save his gym he needs to raise $50,000 within 30 days, a seemingly insurmountable task, but opportunity comes in the form of a dodgeball tournement, one where the team that wins the finals, held in Las Vegas, is awarded a prize of the exact amount needed to save the gym.  Goodman learns of Peter's plan, organizes his own team, including a scary uni-brow female ringer from some Soviet breakaway republic, to ensure his nefarious scheme doesn't fail, but Peter and his band of sorry, uncoordinated geeks, losers, and oddballs finds help in that of 7 time dodgeball all star Patches O'Houlihan (Torn), who signs on as their coach (utilizing some unusual techniques and also having some of the best lines)...will the boys prevail?  Perhaps, but they're going to need some serious help, a little luck, and a whole lot of balls...<br /><br />This movie is worth watching if nothing else than to see Justin Long getting clobbered in the face with a wrench...oh, I know it was a rubber prop, but still, it looked darn realistic, and elicited a strange sense of satisfaction from myself.  I've got nothing against Justin Long as a person, but his character Warren Parker Cheswick on the television series `Ed' was just so darn annoying.  The story is pretty formulaic in terms of a rag tag bunch of misfits rising above their own inadequacies to achieve a common goal, facing impossible odds and adversity every step of the way, but the difference is the various interesting characters.  I thought all the actors did really well, but Stiller kinda needs to find a new schtick as I feel like I've seen his psycho, over-the-top characterization a number of times, with small variances.  I actually like him better when he's downplaying his roles in a self-effacing manner as in There's Something About Mary (1998) or Meet the Parents (2000)...yeah, his character did get a little nutso in those movies, but it was brief, and within context, and worked better in small doses.  I've never been a huge fan of Vaughn, ever since he appeared in that remake of Psycho (1998), but he fit in nicely here as the sort of smart alecky leader and wasn't relied on to carry the film as he got a lot of help from a good supporting cast.  The direction was good, as Thurber kept things moving along at a good pace, although the film did slow down a bit in the third act, despite all the scenes of intense competition in terms of teams battling to get into the finals.  In one of the commentaries, Thurber stated he actually left the film for a week, as the studio didn't like his original ending, which is included as a special feature.  I saw it, and thought it was better than the one used, and I can only imagine the reactions of those who attended pre-screening...oh well, I guess you really can't fight the power.  At least we get to see Christine Taylor kiss another woman, and that's gotta be worth something.  Some of my favorite scenes involved the training tactics used by Rip Torn's character ("If you can dodge traffic, you can dodge a ball."), which involved the scene, as I mentioned earlier, of Justin Long's character's face having an unfriendly encounter with a tool.  All in all this was a pretty silly movie, but highly entertaining, especially if you like to see guys hit in the crotch with large, rubber balls (I know I do).<br /><br />The widescreen anamorphic (2.35:1) picture on this DVD looks sharp, and Dolby Digital 5.1 audio comes through clearly.  Special features include a commentary track with Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughan, and director-writer Rawson Marshall Thurber, nine deleted/extended scenes and an alternate ending with optional commentary by writer/director Thurber, footage (with introduction by Thurber) of the Dodgeball Dancers (Yowsa!), some entertaining featurettes titled `Dodgeball Boot Camp: Training for Dodgeball',  `The Anatomy of a Hit', `Justin Long: A Study in Ham & Cheese', `Dodgeball: Go for the Gold', a blooper/gag reel, 2 theatrical trailers for the film, along with ones for Garden State (2004), and There's Something About Mary (1998), the screenplay on DVD-ROM, and a few, easy to find Easter eggs featuring Stiller in a fat suit poking fun at those who scour DVDs for hidden features.<br /><br />Cookieman108<br /><br />Also, keep you eyes peeled for a lot of great cameos, especially the coach of the German team...nice to see he's still getting work...</p></br><a href="../users/A3S98L5B1SR9P1.html">A3S98L5B1SR9P1</a><br/><p>If you are looking for a fun flick to waste some time, you've found it! This movie has some very funny and unforgettable moments. Sadly and strangely, I found myself laughing uncontrolably at the sight of the red balls pounding people. A cheap thrill that I would recommend if you want a good laugh.</p></br><a href="../users/ANAYSRE3LX8GZ.html">ANAYSRE3LX8GZ</a><br/><p>Dodge ball is the kind of movie you have seen a thousand times about a guy trying to save something for him and hid friends and they happen to figure out a way how to do it that would never really happen in real life, but you know it will in the end of the film, because it's a movie.<br /><br />What's-his-face plays this guy who owns a gymnasium that needs $50,000 to keep his gym, other wise it will be repossessed (or something like that) by the bank. So they try to think up a way to get the fifty grand with a few weeks by any means necessary (legally). They decide they will enter the Dodge Ball competition where the grand final prize money is (wait for it, you'll never guess) fifty thousand dollars!!! Their rival team is Ben Stiller's annoying character who owns a much more stable and wealthier gym who has bought off the first mortgage of Joes gym and plans to turn Joes gym into a car park for his gym that happens to be right across the street. Will Joe get to the final and win the 50k? Or will Global Gym beat them and take over? I wonder???<br /><br />Ben Stiller is not an actor I hate, I did like him in "Something about Mary" so don't get me wrong when I say he is the downfall of this film. He plays an extra stupid fitness buff who owns a major gym. But his character is not funny, and his acting is extremely annoying. To set up a character for the audience to hate is ok, but to make them annoyed and wish he would just get off the screen is another. There is a difference between a villain and bad acting.<br /><br />This movie didn't seem to know which direction it wanted to go in with its approach to comedy in my opinion. Some of it seemed like it was trying to go for average family comedy or kids movie, other parts it would go for the smutty comedy approach, and then in-between here and there where bits of attempted wacky and goofy comedy like a slap stick kind of think. Those elements can work well together, but this new 1st time producer, whoever he is, needs to work out how to blend them properly or never get it right. It's kind of like a kid's first time out drinking booze, instead of sipping something light; he's grabbed everything from the top shelf and mixed a regretting combination. But one day he might learn to not mix his drinks. That's because this movie had potential to be absolutely hilarious, but it failed with the wrong ideas and jokes and didn't come out the way it could have been.<br /><br />The extra features are nothing to look forward to. The out-takes aren't funny, (except David Hasslehoff's, that made me laugh) the deleted scenes are pretty boring, the featurettes are slightly amusing in some parts. The alternate ending is ...eh. The commentary was buggered up because it actualy had JOKE COMMANTARY written on the back of the case. (2 thing's, don't write that it's a joke, it reuins it, and don't tell people there are eggs on the DVD, it's reuins the fact that there supposed to be hidden extras.. oh and 3, make the eggs worth looking at)but knowing it was a joke rueined the thing that I knew was an attempted false audio commantary to make you laugh,well it failed anyway, not much is funny about them arguing and pretending to hate each other and rustling chip packets and drinking beer, might have worked if they didnt write it was a joke on the case already before you've seen it. but then halfway through they decide to play the audio commantary from 'something about mary' which is stupid to do from the 40 minute mark to the very end of the credits, it did become quite boring after the 1st 10 minutes of listning to that half of it. There is a hidden audio commentary in the commentary selection screen if you press right on one of the options and you get to listen to the REAL commantary (WHY HIDE A COMMENTARY TRACK?). Still, there boring. The hidden eggs aren't worth looking at either.<br /><br />Dodge Ball failed to find it's mark because I had a hard time trying to figure out what kind of comedy it was supposed to be? Slapstick? Family? Smutty? or a Kids Comedy? But I could not just sit back and enjoy the film either, too much of it just didn't hit the right mark and was pretty cheap attempts at humour. Surprisingly tho it didn't contain a fart joke anywhere in the movie!!! The movie really needed to finish what it began with certain character elements and little things here and there. I'd recommend you watch BASEketball instead, yeah, watch the movie that this one tried to be in some ways.<br /><br />The movie has no lasting quality. I laughed at a few things the 1st time around. But on the second time around it was pretty stale. Ben Stiller's performance is very hard for me to watch. The humour doesn't last. It could have been such a better movie then it is. The bonus features are a snore fest. Cameos do not save the film, the movie might be a clich&eacute; of sports and to itself, but it's a "seen it before" movie. You have seen the basic element of this movies story line 1000 times. There is probably 2 lines in the whole movie I liked `cause I though they where funny and original, but not lasting or classic comedy.<br /><br />Thumbs down, but to say something good about the film, least it was better then a lot of the other junk released last year.<br /><br />And pretty much everyone I know whose seen this has the same reveiw as me... "I did not like the movie, but I loved the line Rip Torn said" so on that note let me say that this DVD is a iseless as a C*** flavoured lollypop.</p></br><a href="../users/AX9J0U8J6XTCY.html">AX9J0U8J6XTCY</a><br/><p>AS WELL LOADS OF LAUGHS!

That alone seems like enough of an excuse for a comedy about the sport.  And lo, Ben Stiller saw that it was good and he made a movie about it with mixed results.<br /><br />Ben Stiller usually plays sympathetic, frustrated nerds who lose their tempers when things don't go their way.  In Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story, the usual Stiller charm has been dropped and replaced by an arrogant, irritating character named White Goodman.  He is the founder of an extremely popular gym that has plans to expand by taking over extremely uptight, fastidious Peter La Fleur, played by Vince Vaughn.<br /><br />Just kidding!  Of course Vaughn wouldn't play anyone uptight or fastidious.  He's made a career out of playing easygoing regular Joes, sometimes with large vocabularies that betray a hint of intelligence, who don't work too hard and just want to get by in life. When Vaughn is paired with an even more mellow guy like Owen Wilson, it makes Vaughn look animated in comparison and the two become an excellent combination of mellow/acerbic.  See Wedding Crashers for a more palatable mix.<br /><br />But alas, Wilson isn't in this film.  Instead, Le Fleur is backed by a cast of equally lovable idiots, including obscure sportsphile Gordon (Stephen "Red Stapler" Root), clueless Owen (Joel Moore), normal guy Dwight (Chris Williams), the appropriately named Justin (Justin Long), and for some reason that only Stiller understands, Steve the Pirate (Alan Tudyk). Le Fleur falls hard for the lovely Kate Veatch (Christine Taylor and Stiller's wife), a lawyer in the employ of Goodman.<br /><br />How can our just-like-you gaggle of guys possibly beat the overcoifed, hyperactive Goodman?  Why, with a little training from the dodgeball champion himself, Patches O'Houlihan (Rip Torn). Patches is the funniest character in the entire movie.  That's not a compliment.<br /><br />Like the ill-fated Anchorman, Dodgeball is actually more amusing to quote than it is to watch.  Stiller is much funnier as an underdog and makes for a two-dimensional villain.  Vaughn is unbelievable as a successful business owner and flounders without a foil to play off of.  Taylor tries, again, to be the straight woman like she did in Anchorman, but she's too slickly attractive to pull it off convincingly.<br /><br />Thing is, Dodgeball doesn't care if you like it.  Jason Bateman, Lance Armstrong, Chuck Norris, William Shatner, and David Hasslehoff all make appearances, so it's obvious the film doesn't take itself too seriously.  On the other hand, the amusement around these characters being in the movie depends directly on the cultural relevance to the audience.  The Chuck Norris jokes are getting a little creaky.<br /><br />If you watch Dodgeball with your buddies and a case of beer, it definitely earns five stars.  Otherwise it's merely a passable entry in the goofy sports genre.</p></br><a href="../users/ADB8XCKNSDY5Z.html">ADB8XCKNSDY5Z</a><br/><p>This movie was really silly, but I thought it was quite watchable.  I was impressed actually.  I wouldn't mind watching it again.  Usually I don't like Ben Stiller movies, but I laughed at some of the stuff he did in this one.  I guess it may be because I respect antagonists more than protagonists.<br /><br />The plot in this movie doesn't matter much.  No one cares about it.  This movie is for nothing but cheap laughs.  Fortunately the cheap laughs aren't limited to endless shots of people getting hit in the groin.  There's a whole variety of goofy humor.  My favorite part is the black and white short film on Dodgeball they watch.<br /><br />Sometimes the humor gets a bit silly though.  There's a guy who walks around in the film dressed as a pirate for no reason at all.  I thought the whole pirate thing was the worst part of the movie.  Still, it wasn't enough to tarnish the entire work.<br /><br />I'd recommend checking this out for a rental.  Laugh at some parts and not at others.  Go with the flow.</p></br><a href="../users/A457S8SW690NM.html">A457S8SW690NM</a><br/><p>3 and 1/2 stars<br /><br />I am a big Ben Stiller fan and I also like Vince Vaughn. So, I had some big expectations before watching this movie. While it does have a fair share of laughs, it just wasn't very funny. The movie is about Average Joes Gym, a gym that needs 50,000 dollars to keep the building. So, Vince Vaughn and company form a dodgeball team and enter into a dodgeball tournament to get the money. But, squaring off against them are the people from the popular Globo Gym. They square off in a funny tournament on ESpN 8, the ocho. Vaughn and Stiller are good as are the rest of the cast but this movie wasn't as funny as it could have been. This isn't a good comedy to add to your collection but is a worthy rent with some classic jokes. This is a lot better than BE COOl!!!!!!!! This is a solid comedy that doesn't have enough gas to be one of my favorite comedies.</p></br><a href="../users/A18MBO1U4DPY20.html">A18MBO1U4DPY20</a><br/><p>I saw this film with a bunch of friends and we had a blast despite the movie not leveling my moderate expectations. There's not much to write about here. Ben Stiller is somehow amusing  in his MCP mad man way and I thought there were a few average funny scenes.Mind you, I'll watch any Ben Stiller movie that comes out. However when it comes to purchasing , I dont think this movie is really worth owning.Thats all.Sadly there's not much of Dodgeball in it.

Is something really funny, or is not really but seems to be because of a certain action that's going on on screen?. Personally, I love a good, intelligent, sophisticated comedy, but just as much, I love the low-brow, slapstick, juvenile type. In the case of this movie, the slapstickiness and the ongoing pounding of rubber balls on human flesh is just funny in it's own right, but it takes on more meaning because it brings back memories, most of them not good, of the sport back in our school days. Thinking about the horrors of the barbaric sport in gym class and, if you were one of the unlucky ones, remembering being one of the unwilling picked on players who would just get massacred, makes the comedy here more personal. And that much more funnier. Vince Vaughan stars as Peter LaFleur, a laid back slacker type who runs his own little gym, Average Joe's. Which pretty much sums up his character. His gym is kind of slummy with some sad sack clientele. When he learns that he is in debt and owes $50,000 dollars, he must come up with a plan, or he will have to close his place, and hand it over to White Goodman(the hilariously crazy Ben Stiller), a nazi-like fitness guru with a massive gym, and just as massive hair and ego. Peter and his band of misfits learn of a Dodgeball tournament in Las Vegas where the first prize is, you guessed it, $50,000. What a perfect koinkidink. But who shows up?. White, of course. What we have here is a good natured, little underdog story that mostly works. It is by no means a classic, but it is a competent little comedy that is consistent in it's run and it's laughs. It also doesn't hurt that it has a very solid footing with it's good cast. Rip Torn plays their dodgeball coach, who is seen in a 1950's educational type film and is played by an uncredited Hank Azaria. There are a few other cameos here too like William Shatner, Lance Armstrong, Chuck Norris(who is hilariously insulted in the last scene), and David Hassellhoff. The commentators for the sport are played by the always great and welcomed Gary Cole, and the mysteriously uncredited Jason Bateman. Those two are reminiscent of Fred Willard in "Best In Show", and they are just as funny. The regular cast holds things up nicely too. The always reliable Stephen Root("Office Space", "King Of The Hill", "NewsRadio")is great here as a nerdish family man. Justin Long, from "Ed" and the "Jeepers Creepers" movies is hysterical as, well, Justin, the poor kid who seems the bear the brunt of the slamming balls and other airborn devices. Stiller's real life wife, Christine Taylor, also co-stars. And what can you say about Stiller?. He has always been very talented, and his creation of White Goodman here is hysterical. He keeps it interesting and fun when waiting to hear what dimbulb thing he is going to say next. This is a movie that is pretty funny and enjoyable on it's own, but is made so much funnier when we remember the rigors of high school gym class and are able to look back on it and laugh. Well, hopefully.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BT7IC8PT1ZC9.html">A2BT7IC8PT1ZC9</a><br/><p>I didn't expect too much out of this movie.  But it was actually funnier than I thought it would be.

I am sick of hollywood giving us the same three people in every comedy. Harold and Kumar is the best place to go for some fresh faces in comedy and a much funnier and much better over all film experience.

But I knew there would be a double-dip DVD. You know, they release a DVD, and a few months later, they release a better DVD. So looks like I'll be reviewing the brand new DVD!<br /><br /> The story consists of two gyms. The first one is the Globo gym, a giant gym owned by White Goodman [played marvously by Ben Stiller.] And the other is the Average Joe's gym, owned by Peter, and the people who go there aren't normal. Peter. being in debt, discovers if he doesn't pay $50,000, he will lose the gym and White will take over it. After reading about a $50,000 dollar prize dodgeball competion in Las Vegas, he tries to master dodgeball.<br /><br /> If you are looking for a story with great plot and character development, look elsewhere. But if you love a great, funny comedy, see Dodgeball!<br /><br /> This new Unrated DVD is packed with great bonuses. An audio commentary, featurettes, deleted scenes w/ optional commentary, an alternate ending [which sucks], bloopers, and more. A must have.<br /><br /> PS: Press Enter each time White Goodman snaps his fingers [he does it 4 times] during the movie for some Easter eggs, including a second commentary!</p></br><a href="../users/AZ5250G2U795I.html">AZ5250G2U795I</a><br/><p>OK...so Dodgeball relies on alot of formula tricks...ball to the groin, stupified underdogs...you name it.

But the quality casting (Stephen Root proves he can handle any script thrown at him and has an extremely memorable role in this film) and smart directing (The film NEVER takes itself too seriously or tries too hard for the laughs) make this a worthwhile flick.<br /><br />Terrific gift for most anyone.</p></br><a href="../users/AL277B4AQCWBG.html">AL277B4AQCWBG</a><br/><p>The "bunch of losers rallied into a champion team" story is one of the oldest in Hollywood, and this year's incarnation of the evergreen sub-genre is one of the best.  It relies on something extremely simple: the inherent funniness of seeing someone get hit in the head.  Thurber's screenplay piles joke upon joke - both visual and verbal - to the point of near-hysteria, especially during the training sequences and the early rounds of the tournament. Ben Stiller is marvellous as the ludicrously narcissistic/neurotic White Goodman, and the perfect foil to Vince Vaughn's almost somnambulistically unmotivated Peter La Fleur.  The supporting cast and cameos are all great, but in the end it's Thurber's relentlessly witty screenplay that shines.  It has a reassuring awareness of its own absurdity (from the elaborate subtitle, right down to the "Deus Ex Machina" emblazoned on the cash chest at the end), but respects the genre just enough to become one of its shining examples.  Very refreshing, and a step up for Stiller and Vaughn from the surprisingly lukewarm "Starsky & Hutch".</p></br><a href="../users/A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I.html">A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I</a><br/><p>For me, this film to a little while to warm up to. I like films like this, but it really had a slow beginning. But after the first fifteen minutes, it really picks up and is very entertaining. The jokes are funny and what I like most about the film is all the people in it and who make the cameos. William Shatner, Chuck Norris, and even Alan Tudyk who played Wash on Firefly, one of my favorite TV series, is in this film. Overall, I ended up liking this better than I thought I would have judging from the beginning of the film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VCPMT1RRS7K0.html">A1VCPMT1RRS7K0</a><br/><p>Ben Stiller plays White Goodman, a pompous gym owner who tries to take over "Average Joe's Gym", currently owned by Peter LaFleur (Vince Vaughn). The crew at Average Joe's are tight-knit and decide to enter a dodgeball tournament in order to win the $50,000.00 grand prize that will enable Peter to keep the gym open. Patches O'Houlihan then comes along to train the group of hopeless misfits for the tournament.<br /><br />The best character, of course, is Stiller's White Goodman character. Stiller really nails the role of someone whose ineptitude and artificiality will crack you up. You will love to hate White Goodman.<br /><br />Vince Vaughn plays off Ben Stiller extremely well, as usual. These two make a hell of a comic duo and I hope to see more from them in the future.<br /><br />This movie is pretty hilarious and I would certainly recommend it to any Ben Stiller or Vince Vaughn fans.

It is a laugh riot where acting, situations, one liners and a nincompoop plot all merge to create a comedy that's more entertaining than most movies.<br /><br />The one liners come often and are usually laden with sexual conntent. "Useless as a lollipop that tastes like a (male genitalia)" is a line from one actor. Another, recounting the miracles he's seen in life, says, "I've even seen a grown man satisfy a camel."<br /><br />Ben Stiller is protagonist to Vince Vaughn's antagonist in this flick about competing health clubs, good guys and bad guys. Stiller is more in character throughout this movie than anytime I've ever seen him, while Vaughn plays himself. David Hasselhoff, Chuck Norris, William Shatner and Lance Armstrong all play small roles parodying themselves along the way.<br /><br />The title action plays the deciding role in whether the good guy or bad guy will prevail, although everyone knows from the beginning who's going to come out on top. Another one liner about the dodgeball competition is that it is broadcast nationwide on "ESPN 8, the Ocho", a comic parody of ESPN2, which is known in the industry as "the deuce."<br /><br />While there is no denying this is one of the funniest films of recent years, you are warned not to share this video with your kids unless you want to incur the wrath of your wife or answer question all night like, "Daddy, what's a dyke?" The sexual content in this profane film is heavy and consistent. It never relents and takes a new twist at the very end.<br /><br />But it's still a funny movie and more entertaining than 90 percent of the movies out there. Enjoy it all you want but beware its juvenile sexual content.</p></br><a href="../users/A3JPFWKS83R49V.html">A3JPFWKS83R49V</a><br/><p>Dodgeball is a fun and entertaining film that pits two business associates against each other in a battle for respect and survival. Ben Stiller is the egocentric, cocky White Goodman and Vince Vaughan plays his rival, Peter. Both men own physical health centers, but Peter's is in financial trouble and needs a way to make a large sum of money quickly. Peter and his employees decide to enter a dodgeball tournament in Las Vegas with the hope of winning the championship and the necessary money to stay in business. Goodman hears about this and he enters his own team to challenge them.<br /><br />The formula and plot for this movie may seem a little hokey at first. But the movie works for several reasons. First of all, there is the fine cast of characters and diversity of personalities. Vaughn's character is soft spoken and friendly, but also non- expressive and basically an underachiever- the mirror opposite of the arrogant character played by Ben Stiller. Rip Torn is also excellent as the coach for Vaughn's team. His character, Peaches O'Houlihan, is confined to a wheelchair but he doesn't let this stop him from doing what he does best: coaching and motivating his team in a most unorthodox and often hysterical way. And Gary Cole and Jason Bateman add some good laughs as the sportscasters for "ESPN 8: The Ocho", which is covering the dodgeball event.<br /><br />Cameo appearances by Lance Armstrong, William Shatner and others add to the many surprises in this film. And even though the movie is mostly predictable, as a viewer, you really won't mind. There is enough fun along the way to make the ride enjoyable regardless.<br /><br />Dodgeball is, in summary, a fast- moving, fun, entertaining, and mostly predictable film that is humorous and enjoyable from beginning to end. The director, Rawson Marshall Thurber, and the fine cast deserve credit for taking what initially seems like a stupid, "B" comedy and turning it into a compelling, witty, and entertaining motion picture film.</p></br><a href="../users/AYQF4Z1EQDACU.html">AYQF4Z1EQDACU</a><br/><p>It's the ultimate dodgeball tornament for Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn in the hilarious rockin shockin comedy "Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story.

Rip Torn is very funny too as Patches O' Hoolohan. the funniest movie of 2004 and one of the funniest ever, will never forget this film. Ben Stiller is the comedy star of the decade, as Chaplin was in the tens and the roaring twenties,Marx Brothers in the 30s and 40s and Jack Lemmon in the 50s and 60s.

I'm not much into sports, and I remember "Any Given Sunday" seemed to go on longer than the entire football season.  Anywho, sport movies seem to work better as comedies.  "Caddyshack" and "Happy Gilmore" made golf actually look interesting and fun.  "The Bad News Bears" and "Mr. 3000" made baseball fun.  Even "Field of Dreams" made the sport seem spiritual as a movie.  This particular film is funny.  Great comic performances from all the cast.  The film breezes through nicely.  There's even a couple of romances.  Some good plot twists and fun, fun, fun.  Now imagine if t he boys from South Park would have helmed this project...</p></br><a href="../users/A1GD1G8XXPRYQ8.html">A1GD1G8XXPRYQ8</a><br/><p>Funny, stupid, hilarious and extremely entertaining.

It's a spoof of professional sports with some solid actors (Vince Vaughn and Ben stiller, for example) and instead of focusing on an actual professional sport, they focus on dodgeball. I'm sure most if not all of us have played dodgeball as children and can remember how much fun we had, so this movie is bound to bring back memories (as well as spoofing the game) Overall enjoyable and funny movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>Peter LaFleur is a charismatic underachiever and proprietor of a rundown gym called Average Joe's. The facility's ecclectic clientele of decidedly less-than-average Joes is comprised of: a self-styled pirate; a scrawny nerd who dreams of impressing an unattainable cheerleader; an obsessive aficionado of obscure sports; a dim-witted young man; and a cocky know-it-all who, of course, really knows nothing. Peter's humble gym catches the eye of White Goodman, the power-mullet-sporting, Fu-Manchu-d, egomaniacal owner of Globo Gym, a gleaming monolith of fitness. White intends to take over Average Joe's, and Peter's non-existent bookkeeping is making it all too easy for him. A foreclosing bank has stationed attorney Kate Veatch inside Average Joe's to finalize Globo's takeover of the gym. But Peter's boyish charms win her over and Kate joins his team of social rejects to beat the odds, and their own ineptitude,to try to save Average Joe's. By having a showdown dodgeball competition against Globo Gym. From the supporting cast and the cameo's everyone does a top notch job.  It's stupid, sure, but it's so hilarious, you don't care. I could not stop laughing. There are so many jokes in this movie, you don't even have a chance to rest before the next one comes along. This is a comedy, a comedy meant to entertain.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FMJJKSVQDDQ.html">A1FMJJKSVQDDQ</a><br/><p>The fact is, this movie is hilarious. I never expected this to be very funny when I started watching it. The sight gags really work, and the same is said for the humor itself (even though some of it involves people repeatedly getting hit by something). Vaughan, Stiller, Torn, and the rest of the cast really give hysterical performances. But why the four stars? Well, the only flaw here is that certain scenes do seem to slow the film down. But that's about it. The rest of the film is very good. It's a comedy that people with a real sense of humor will enjoy.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KB1H0S7T6JX1.html">A3KB1H0S7T6JX1</a><br/><p>...and they will take care of you."<br /><br />An excellent comedy, Dodgeball, brings to the screen the story of a gym owner and his friends as they take part in the annual Dodgeball tournament in order to win 50,000 dollars and save their gym from a hostile takeover.<br /><br />Vince Vaughn, Ben Stiller, Christine Taylor, and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)!<br /><br />There are also the guest appearances of actors such as William Shatner, Hank Azaria, Chuck Norris, and David Hasselhoff among others, who add a great deal to the overall enjoyment.<br /><br />Very well written and very well presented, it allows for a highly entertaining movie that can be watched over and over again!<br /><br />The pirate was a bit much, but the setting, the plot, the dialogues, the humor, and the music are all wonderful!

The deleted scenes, the bloopers, and the alternative ending are so worth it!<br /><br />In short, Dodgeball is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection (if you haven't done so already)!  4.5 Stars</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn are on top of their game in this hilariously entertaining comedy.  The premise has Vaughn facing eviction from his local run-down gym 'Average Joes' if he can't come up with $50,000.  Across the street is 'Average Joes' nightmare 'Globo-Gym' run by the hilarious Ben Stiller.  Vaughn and his team of losers including a nerd, a pirate, and man who seems to have down syndrum and a teen with girl issues, not to mention the girl the banks sent to repo his place of business (Taylor), deside to enter a dodgeball championship in order to win the money, which brings them to a final showdown with 'Globo-Gym'.  They enlist the help of Patches O'Houlihan (Rip Torn), a master of the dodgeball.  Rip is hilarious is every scene, with one liners like the one I used for my title that will keep you laughing harder and harder.  From start to finish this is one film that will keep you rolling...it's freaking hilarious.  Ben Stiller proves he is box-office gold and comedic genius!</p></br><a href="../users/A2NUHWMHA9XNKV.html">A2NUHWMHA9XNKV</a><br/><p>Hilarious!<br /><br />I have never laughed so much at a movie.

Excellent choice for any film fan!<br /><br /> if you like those silly cory funny movies this is for you</p></br><a href="../users/AVOCNUFOXUCA6.html">AVOCNUFOXUCA6</a><br/><p>In many ways, "Dodgeball" is exactly what you think it's going to be: a slob comedy in the classic mold (like "Stripes" or "Caddyshack"), with the snobs vs. the slobs.  And "Dodgeball" delivers plenty of laughs along those lines.  Despite all of the broad physical humor, "Dodgeball" manages to throw in a number of very subtle and dry gags, and has a lot more intelligence than you might think.<br /><br />However, "Dodgeball" takes a while to get moving.  The first 20 minutes are so lifeless and devoid of comedy that we almost kicked the DVD out of the player and abandoned the rest of the movie.  I'm glad I didn't, because the remainder of the movie is laugh-out-loud funny.  The problem is not Vince Vaughn, but his character and the way he's directed.  You never get the feeling that the character really cares about keeping the gym, so you don't get too invested in whether he wins the dodgeball competition or not.  Further, Vaughn, who is an excellent actor who has plenty of comedic energy, just doesn't display it unless Ben Stiller is on screen with him.  This suggests that the fault lies with the director, who seems like he wanted Vaughn to play it a bit too laid back.  What the role needed was the energy of a Bill Murray or Chevy Chase who can do laconic without being listless, and I'm afraid the director just didn't get that.<br /><br />Jason Bateman steals the movie as the stoner co-anchor of the dodgeball broadcast.  If you've ever seen "Arrested Development," you'll laugh twice as hard, because this character is the exact opposite of Michael Bluth.  Bateman would have been a good choice for Vaughn's role as well.<br /><br />The deleted scenes and alternate (original) ending were pretty good.  I actually prefer the original ending, which is truer to the characters, but I understand why the studio freaked out.<br /><br />Kudos on the Curtis Armstrong cameo!  And you will also enjoy Shatner in his best role since James T. Kirk.</p></br><a href="../users/A1SCD2NYTIAQTY.html">A1SCD2NYTIAQTY</a><br/><p>"Dodgeball" is something from left field on more than one count, and something quite new for Ben Stiller. Neeedless to say, I laughed until I nearly saw lunch again, and laughed some more.<br /><br />The plot is pretty simple: small time gym owner nearly loses gym to big time, flashy competitor who is so full of himself that it defies description. Add a love interest, and some excellent comedy, and you have "Dodgeball".<br /><br />I have a very violent sense of humour, (I thought "Hannibal" was a laugh, just to give you an idea), so "Dodgeball" really appealed to me. As others have mentioned, the "If you can dodge a wrench, you can dodge a ball" scene is priceless in its comedy. To see the poor guy squirming on the floor in abject pain was truly hilarious.<br /><br />Additionally, Rip Torn and Hank Azaria as Patches O'Houlihan are both brilliant. Describing the game as "degradation, violence and exclusion" was genius, followed by more violent humour.<br /><br />Ben Stiller deserves special mention for his performance as White Goodman, the owner of Globo-Gym, the evil rival. Getting way outside his usually anal-retentive characters, Stiller makes a disturbingly good prick and general nasty type.<br /><br />"Dodgeball" has it all: feel good story, violent humour, sexual innuendo, situational humour, satire and just great fun all round. For a seriously good laugh, this movie is the funniest I have seen since "Team America"!</p></br><a href="../users/A1J66TA573ZPRX.html">A1J66TA573ZPRX</a><br/><p>Funny movie.  Christine Taylor kissing that girl was sweet.  Christine Taylor, Scarlett Chorvat, Julie Gonzalo, and Missi Pyle are hot.</p></br><a href="../users/A5TZXWU8AALIC.html">A5TZXWU8AALIC</a><br/><p>To be honest, I resisted watching DODGEBALL because I didn't care much for recent comedies.  I also avoided anything with Ben Stiller after several of his unfunny stinkbombs.  He really needs to be more picky with his scripts because he is a genuinely funny guy (check out "The Ben Stiller Show" to see that).<br /><br />But Stiller is very funny in DODGEBALL, along with everyone else.  I wish there had been more Stephen Root and Rip Torn.  I also loved Hank Azaria's spoof of old educational films on the history of Dodgeball.  After OLD SCHOOL and this movie, Vince Vaughn is becoming the Bill Murray of his generation.<br /><br />Most of this movie is predictable and derivative but it keeps the laughs coming.<br /><br />Funny, funny stuff.  Check it out.</p></br><a href="../users/AQBRMBQ99ESI7.html">AQBRMBQ99ESI7</a><br/><p>Peter owns and operates a neighborhood gym. He is a nice guy but a lousy business man. In fact, he is practically broke. Still, his is the only place accessible to the "average Joe". It does not cater to the "beautiful people". Frankly, it caters to losers. They are nice losers but losers all the same.<br /><br />The problem occurs when a big, corporate gym wants to buy his facility. He doesn't want to sell but does not have the cash to pay off the delinquent note. The only hope is to enter a dodgeball tournament. Nobody from the gym really knows anything about dodgeball but it is their only hope. They are lucky in that they find a former "professional" to act as coach. As predictable as it seems, the underdogs manage to triumph after a lot of unexpected traumas along the way.<br /><br />This film is utterly predictable and uses all the traditional sports clich&eacute;s but that does not matter because it is fun. Enjoy it for what it is: a mindless but fun comedy.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>You find no subtlety here, and you shouldn't try to.  Here is the a comedy with lots of ultimately crude, rude, unsophisticated gags.  But I like 'Dodgeball' because of that, and if you love kind of a comedy like 'There's Something About Mary,' this film is for you.<br /><br />Story?  It's about a bunch of underdogs who need money very badly.  So they join in the national dodgeball tournament in Las Vegas to get $50,000.  That's it, and they form a ragtag team called 'Average Joes' while another team attempt to crush them, called 'Purple Cobras.'<br /><br />Vince Vaughn, cast against type, plays the reluctant leader of 'Joes' and Ben Stiller plays the greedy gym owner named 'White Goodman.'  Add to them, Christine Taylor (Ben's real-life wife) joins in the cast as the lawyer who is sexually harassed by Mr. Goodman.  Is there any depth, subtle touch, or social message?  But should there be any?<br /><br />[SLAPSTICKS AND CAMEOS] Rip Torn's funny dodgeball coach says, 'If you can dodge a wrench, you can dodge a ball.'  Right?  In fact, red rubber balls fly around and hit the characters in the face.  The traditional slapstick comedy like pie-throwing is done in another style, with more energy and vitality, with lots of raucous humor.  Dirty languages abound, and the gags are often very sexual.  Plus, you see many cameos -- William Shatner, Chuck Norris, Hank Azaria, David Hasselhoff (as German coach), and Lance Armstrong -- all of them adding more unexpected humor to the film.<br /><br />I don't say this is the best comedy of the decade, but it is true I enjoyed watching the film very much.  Silly, to be sure, but sometimes, just sometimes, absolute silliness with unstoppable energy produces a hilarious comedy like this.  And as far as the box office figure goes, which exceeded $110,000,000 in USA alone, many people seem to have felt the same way as I do.</p></br><a href="../users/A2A6NH6DPE0VXR.html">A2A6NH6DPE0VXR</a><br/><p>Vince Vaughn (Old School) and Ben Stiller (There's Something About Mary) have fun here in Dodgeball. I always loved playing it as a kid in gym class and have wished it was a real sport because it's the funnest. However this movie has fun making fun of it and shows how easy it is to make fun of it. Besides Stiller and Vaughn having fun in there roles. Rip Torn is great as the manager of Vaugn's team. He has a few screws loose and tells the players if they can dodge a wrench or...on-going traffic they can dodge a dodgeball..lol. Jason Bateman (Arrested Development) also has fun as a dorky commentator. Chuck Norris and David Hasslehoff "or however u spell it" also show up in funny cameos. Anyway this movie is full of funny lines and interesting unusual characters and it's hard not to be entertained by it.</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>DODGEBALL is one of those movies that you read the back of the video box or DVD case and think, "This sounds pretty good. It sounds like it has a decent plot, it's a comedy, and it's got Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn so it has to be fairly good." Then you get home and watch the movie and can't believe how terrible it is. That's how I felt about DODGEBALL.<br /><br />The set up of the movie is promising. Average Joes, a small time gym, has their mortgage purchased by Global Gym. The guy in charge of Global Gym hates the guy in charge of Average Joes. He thinks Average Joes is competing for his business and wants to turn Average Joes into a parking garage. The guys at Average Joes have to come up with $50,000 or their place is gone. That's where the dodgeball comes into play. The World Dodgeball Championships are being held in a few weeks in Las Vegas and the prize for the winning team is $50,000. But things go horribly wrong.<br /><br />There are a lot of funny lines in DODGEBALL. Ben Stiller is hilarious for most of the movie (basically reprising his role of Tony Serkis from HEAVYWEIGHTS but for an adult audience), Vince Vaughn is witty as ever, Rip Torn is a riot as the team's personal trainer who comes out of retirement, and the movie has Lance Armstrong in one of the best movie cameos of the early 2000s.<br /><br />But there's a hitch. Instead of going the high road of comedy DODGEBALL plays to the lowest common denominator and the movie drastically suffers. Foul language, crude jokes, every other sentence is filled with sexual innuendo. There's one scene where a group of young women are washing cars with their cleavage and there's another scene where Stiller's character uses a slice of pizza as Gold Bond. The movie promises to be hilarious, but it turns out to be a cruel, crude joke.<br /><br />If you like the types of comedies that Judd Apatow directs and writes or are a fan of THE HANGOVER, then you'll probably enjoy DODGEBALL. Personally, I like my comedies a little less crude. As for the movie being "A True Underdog Story", that's just part of the gimmick. If you want to watch a real underdog story watch RUDY or MIRACLE.</p></br></body></html>
